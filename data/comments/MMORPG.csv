It is very old and has very out dated graphics. I really enjoyed it at the time where this type of graphics is top notch. The game system is still top notch to me, but I can't stand it's graphics anymore. I am still searching for MMORPG like this even until today."

Best MMORPG I have ever played. It's really sad that MMORPGs today are so casual and protective.

MMORPG,3dylk7,Katalos,7,Tue Jul 21 18:58:54 2015 UTC,I always get confused with VC and Uncharted Waters and Bounty Bay Online...which one is the better one?
MMORPG,3dylk7,archize,3,Tue Jul 21 00:09:21 2015 UTC,"VC and Bounty Bay Online are actually the same game. BBO used to be hosted by Frogster as an EU subscription version of the US server, called Voyage Century that was and still is hosted by IGG. Voyage Century is the original name used by the Chinese server, but the current edition of BBO is the EU region version of the game, being hosted by the original devs, Snail Game, who retained the name for some reason or other.  I couldn't accurately speak to the differences, though. I haven't played either extensively. I can, however, say that I wasn't very fond of the overall ""feel"" of Uncharted Waters, although it's not something I've found a way to put into words."
MMORPG,3dylk7,adag_dot_me,2,Tue Jul 21 02:36:09 2015 UTC,"Uncharted Waters is a Japanese game.  VC and Bounty Bay Online are the same game, but serve different region and have different name. VC is a Chinese game.  Quality wise and fame wise, Uncharted Waters is a better game. I prefer VC."

Hazeron (http://shoresofhazeron.com) was always cool on the surface and has a ton of depth to it but it's a bit impenetrable, which is probably why the community is fairly small. It makes EvE look like child's play and it's unintuitive, to boot. I don't think Civilization Online will come close to being the 4X MMO that Hazeron is, though.  A Tale In the Desert (http://www.atitd.com) was always really cool, being a completely non-combat MMO with the top player(s) on the server voting on new features at the end of each age. Unfortunately, it sort of stagnated and the community got tiny after a while. There's a new company working on it now, though, so maybe we will see that change.  Myst Online: URU Live (http://mystonline.com) is a great, now open source rendition of URU: Ages Beyond Myst that had some great community projects on top of being able to play ages with other players, with some minor, non-puzzle related details in each age becoming permanent until some other player changed them. It was extremely cool but longevity was a bit of an issue and it launched originally as a game that was only available to GameTap subscribers and didn't require a sub on top of it. All of that sort of added up to its eventual (commercial) demise. Fortunately, it seems to be going fairly strong as an open source game."
MMORPG,3dylk7,silentphantom,2,Mon Jul 20 19:15:22 2015 UTC,"Hazeron was incredible, considering the scope. It's too bad that the insane lag and barely understandable graphics pushed many people away.

That's the idea, because users can create content if I understand correctly.) but I don't like how simple all of the classes are. After 30 minutes of playing I can understand what it'll be like forever. What's the fun in that? I could understand more if the game was based on having tons of side content or mini-games like cards, sports to play, or racing or something--but the primary content seems to be combat and collecting loot through running dungeons.    The design of the game is also a bit confusing with moving forts (your homes), and different styles of play. Menus are also a bit hard to navigate.  It's not a classic MMORPG by any means, which isn't really a bad thing, but it didn't seem to give me the same ""fix"" that I usually feel when playing such games.   Overall, Trove feels made for a very specific audience like kids or casuals sick of classic MMORPG progression."

MMORPG,3dylk7,Heavykiller,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:23:39 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say MUDs are dead at all. A fraction of the player base of MMOs? ofcourse. But many of them have very dedicated communities and are filled to the brim with incredibly imaginative worlds that were painstakingly built by volunteers over many years. If you look at games like Dragonrealms, Gemstone IV and Discworld MUD, you'll find that they can have upwards of 300+ active players at a time.  Would I call that massively multiplayer? Definitely not, but it's worth considering that even back in the day when MUDs were relevant, not many more people than that played them. It's a different kind of experience, which suits some people and not others. No one in the community is ""faceless"", and you very quickly gain a reputation and become recognised everywhere throughout the game.  Games with thousands upon thousands of players per server is still very much a modern idea."

Every now and again I get an oddly irresistible urge to drop a few weeks into it. You sail a ship around Europe (and later most of the world) trading and/or fighting. You can also get out of the ship and go exploring and fighting on land, though the systems/gameplay for land fighting are kinda weak.  Honestly it's not a very good game. It has some strong pay-to-win aspects and the economy is beyond fucked due to how the dungeons were handled, along with the fact that there's only one server that's never been wiped. Still though, there's a ton of fun to be had sailing around and exploring, and the combat is actually pretty fun.  It's certainly a unique MMO though, so if you're completely burned out on MMO's, it's definitely worth it to try out."

It's a fun game to play with friends especially. I've always been a huge fan of it because you only play with the keyboard (other than inventory, menus, etc.), so it really feels like a video game. The P2W is not that bad. With enough farming, you can have everything cash players have, so it's nice that it's more pay for quick and convenience than simply pay to win."
MMORPG,3dzrpn,lx_ol,10,Mon Jul 20 21:16:08 2015 UTC,"TERA focuses on an active block skill as well as having an iframe dodge on it's tanking classes. Activating block at the right time and finding places to also weave in attacks is their only form of mitigation (there are no auto attacks in TERA, you just watch a boss's animations and act accordingly - and if you don't block you will take a shit ton of damage, there is no real form of passive mitigation in TERA for any class), outside of a properly timed dodge on certain attacks. Moreover, they can't just use a threat move or two at the start and expect to be good to go. They have to actively maintain threat throughout the fight because they can very easily lose it - and they do if a dps hits a big crit or something, so regaining it quickly is an important skill to develop. They're also responsible for maintaining an endurance debuff on the boss/healing debuff on enemy healers in PvP, along with having a wide array of stuns and other CC's that are an integral part of their skillset."
MMORPG,3dzrpn,Leiloni,3,Tue Jul 21 00:21:17 2015 UTC,"the problem with making tanking harder and more reactive is that it will scare away players from the role, dps have it already easy as it is. Tanking in Tera is very fun but it takes ages to find someone willing to do the job at higher levels"
MMORPG,3dzrpn,Sneezes,6,Tue Jul 21 02:44:50 2015 UTC,On the other hand making it shitty and boring push button 1 to get threat and button 2 for invincible defence mode makes the people who actually enjoy the challenge of a proper tanking style also not sure want to tank. I'd rather it was more complex. That way you know the people who are tanking at least want to be there.

They also have a party member shield buff which prevents teammates from getting knocked down (super armor mechanic). Now, they are replaced, but maybe the game rebalance patch might require them again."
MMORPG,3dzrpn,Hydrolac,3,Tue Jul 21 00:35:39 2015 UTC,ESO kinda has a similar design to what you're describing. It's definitely the most fun and active game I've ever tanked in (for me at least).

MMORPG,3dzrpn,c2fifield,3,Wed Jul 22 00:00:23 2015 UTC,"That's fair, but you do have to manage the threat timers on taunts or else they don't work for a period of time.

MMORPG,3dzrpn,tuptain,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:23:44 2015 UTC,"It's funny that you're asking about out dated tanking mechanics and I'm about to respond with a decade old game... but FFXI still has some of the best, and unique, tanking mechanics of any game.  Here's how a typical pull goes for a coordinated XP team:   The puller shoots a mob, his macro says something in party chat and everyone get's ready to fight. The off tank provokes the mob as soon as the puller gets back into camp to get initial aggro and prevent the puller from getting wrecked by the Incredibly Tough con mob. The tank lines up behind the mob while the off tank holds it. The thief stands behind the tank, who is behind the mob, and stacks two abilities: Sneak Attack and Trick Attack. Sneak Attack makes your next melee attack deal bonus damage and always crit if you're behind a mob. Trick Attack makes your next attack deal bonus damage and transfers all threat from the attack onto the person between you and the monster, namely, the main tank. You can also stack a Weapon Skill with this, and if someone else did a Weapon Skill just beforehand, you can create a massive Skill Chain, with the tank getting all aggro. The tank now has a ton of aggro and will hold it until the mob dies, at which point the puller (who is usually the Thief) walks into camp with another mob.   But even in teams that aren't coordinated like that, tanking can be quite interesting if you're playing, or subbing, the Ninja job. Ninja's are known as blink tanks because they use an ability that makes them dodge the next 3 attacks that they don't avoid through other means, but it has a 30 second cooldown. So what people will do is the tank gets aggro and when he is down to 1 charge left on this shadows, he'll cast it again so it doesn't get interrupted. After going through those 3 shadows, his cooldown will still be on and he'll start getting smacked in his much-squishier-than-non-blink-tank's face. Because of this, the off tank will provoke it off, allowing the Ninja to recast his shadows without getting hit and having the cast interrupted before provoking it back onto himself. This strat leads to parties that never stop pulling because the White Mage rarely has to heals thanks to the main tank never taking damage and the off tank only occasionally taking a few hits."

MMORPG,3dzrpn,Havesh,0,Tue Jul 21 00:33:25 2015 UTC,"It's not a necessity, just a specialized way of exping. Many of the enemy types that you'd normally exp on were weak to piercing, which meant Thief's daggers did a bonus 25% damage. A well-geared, coordinated Thief could take a solid 50% of an enemy's HP in one SA/TA Weapon Skill. It was a good example of an MMO rewarding coordination rather than haphazardly throwing skills out."

It's almost impossible to catch up in this game on the pvp side, why ? Because since 1.7 people start the trend of stacking up AP (pvp point) to buy the new stuff on the next patch. So people sit at 5m point, they almost never go out to not lose their point, or they go out as huge group and roll over solo or small team of player to do their daily quest and go back afk in town.  Since the amount of casual is also really high, there's no longer any challenge on the pve side, they nerf everything 1-3 week after their release because people cry "" so hard"" ""Not enough loot"" "" we want to do and receive everything on first try blablabla""  I love Aion, I just do, the story is amazing, the world is beautiful, the original dungeon are amazing (bu they are always nerf and became shitty stuff you just chain farm) the armor are beautiful etc. But.

I felt so out of my element that I didn't make it through the tutorial, but there was so much life in and around the commonlands on p99 that I was instantly nostalgia bombed.  The ""vision"" of that server adds a lot of charm and character to the community in my opinion.  As part of not being able to get into the official servers, I gave EQ2 a revisit and ended up playing for a good bit.  The leveling experience has improved a lot and makes for good solo content if that's your thing.  It takes a group of friends to do dungeons with to truly enjoy, but is easier to pick up again than EQ1.  EQ1 will take a LOT of adjusting to go back to, but I strongly recommend p99 if you have the patience.  If I'm not mistaken, Velious will be added soon, which I truly enjoyed in its day (possible added bonus for you)."
MMORPG,3dygge,Fauztin_Vizjerei,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:48:59 2015 UTC,Thanks for your comment. I have never played EQ1 so there is literally zero nostalgia for me.

MMORPG,3dygge,Aerowalk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:04:40 2015 UTC,"Ohhh, I just assumed you had played the first.  I've heard a lot of people suggest not to touch EQ1 if you never played it, and I can understand why.  We enjoyed what it was because we didn't know any better at the time.  When I look back or chat w/ friends about the game/gameplay, one recurring theme is: ""How did we ever tolerate that?""  Don't let that sway you against it as there's a reason it's regarded as such a classic...just manage your expectations.  I'm not familiar w/ the instant level 85 thing.  I would guess it's because a lot of people play MMOs for the endgame, but what made the EQ franchise for me is that leveling was as much of the experience as raiding.    But that doesn't mean that you have to do it?  It's probably worth an hour or two to give a new character another chance."

So might as well just monetize it. People who are levelling their alts for the n th time, don't wanna bother leveling from 1-90 again (and grind AA)."

It's not like you are competing with them anyway.   Also, it's not pay to win (as you are actually losing stuff by using it: losing the actual experience of learning the class; being gimped / poor because of not having enough resources at end game, eg. gold, etc; skipping world explorations)   when others work hard for their levels   No, these days MMO is really easy to level to cap. Almost all major MMOs level cap can be done within a week or 2 (or a month on casual play). Besides, parents with kids, or people with jobs don't have the same play time amount as a 15 yo. I won't care if someone wanna pay $50-60 to skip the leveling process and straight to endgame where usually the real game begins."
MMORPG,3dxys5,Fizzster,10,Mon Jul 20 13:24:10 2015 UTC,"I don't particularly like the idea of endgame. I play games to experience the journey, not to rush through and spam the end.  Endgames don't actually keep me playing :/ If the game has no content variation after level cap or if they don't release more content to keep players interested, I just quit. The only reason I've been playing PSO2 for so long (more than two years now) is because I like the cosmetic aspect of it and am always looking into new cosmetic items. More recently I've been taking part on a few events since they've been having them quite regularly, but I don't take part in actual endgame content. My gear can be considered outdated and I have no real interest in hunting for something better.   Now, what I would personally do if I was designing an MMO would be focus on exploration. Drop down a set story line that has the player as the ultimate hero, focus on scattered lore (a mix of how Dark Souls' story is built around obscure lore and how RuneScape doesn't have a single storyline, instead having multiple quests not necessarily related to each other) and reward players for exploring the world instead of punishing them with quests locked by level."
MMORPG,3dxys5,caelumsixsmith,2,Mon Jul 20 15:22:18 2015 UTC,"Endgames are like a bad book endorsement. ""Oh just read the first chapter, you'll like it.""

MMORPG,3dxys5,caelumsixsmith,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:32:19 2015 UTC,"Endgame logic is like... ""You're not allowed to play Fallout 3 until you play fallout 1 and 2."" The skills you get playing fallout 1 and 2 have NOTHING to do with the skills for playing fallout 3 (Isometric strategy games versus first person action game).   If you have to use the endgame to ""justify"" the leveling experience, then the leveling experience is terrible."

MMORPG,3dxys5,caelumsixsmith,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:52:14 2015 UTC,"That's why I use that analogy: it makes no sense.

""Now you get to do something that has negligible overlap with the skills you developed while leveling up."" So it's like having to play through fallout 1 and 2 before you get to play fallout 3, and while you spent time in the same world, extremely little from playing fallout 1 and 2 is going to help you know how to play fallout 3."
MMORPG,3dxys5,securitywyrm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:40:04 2015 UTC,"To be fair, throwing a player in endgame content without proper introduction of the mechanics is asking for them to be terrible. I understand that some endgames require that the player understand their classes, what the skills do and in which situations they can be useful. The problem with linear progression is that not everyone is interested in learning how to play a certain class, or to find their playstyles within that class's boundaries. That said, progress has its role in endgame content as the player learns how to play. Learning the endgame would be very difficult if the player didn't know his roles, what he could do, which skills can be more benefitial, etc."
MMORPG,3dxys5,caelumsixsmith,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:01:23 2015 UTC,"A ten minute tutorial could teach you all the mechanics you need to know for most MMO endgame. ""Push these buttons as they light up, don't stand in the red circles."" By level 30 in WOW everyone ""understands their class"" but they have another 70 levels of grind to go through.  Picture this: What if you do away with the grind towards 'endgame content' and instead have a test folks have to pass, based on skill rather than gear grind, to do various endgame content levels?"
MMORPG,3dxys5,securitywyrm,3,Tue Jul 21 07:29:10 2015 UTC,"Not all endgame content is based on skill reset and character placement, though, especially with action MMOs, something we see a lot of these days. In those, a player that didn't learn how to play a class properly during the rest of the game will be a trouble for the whole party. For example, in PSO2 anyone who dares stepping into an endgame or an important EQ with Weak Bullet has to know how to use it and where to shoot. I've seen a lot of people with access to Weak Bullet not using it at all or not using it properly, making the quest go much slower than what it should. It's noticeable when the person with Weak Bullet doesn't know what they're doing cos everyone gets a little dumbed down, but if they know what they're doing and the rest of the players understand their roles, the quest is much faster.  On your suggestion, FFXI follows a similar idea with Limit Breaks. Starting on Lv50 you have to run these extremely difficult quests to unlock your level cap. I'm not sure if retail has LB all the way up to 99, but I know classic private server have them starting on 50, then a few times again until 75."
MMORPG,3dxys5,caelumsixsmith,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:54:51 2015 UTC,"Ah I should clarify, action MMOs do use the skills from leveling at endgame because you're actually developing your skill as a player. In contrast, games like WOW have a negligible development of your skill from leveling. I tend to think of games like WOW, Rift, and other ""click, start kicking each other's shins, biggest boots wins"" type games when talking about MMOs.   I think a big factor is ""How much does player skill affect the capabilities of your character?"" In games like WOW, it's maybe 10% difference between someone at ""basic competence"" and ""Elite"" with 90% of your character ability being how much time you've sunk into the game grinding gear. In games like Tera and Dungeon Fighter, you can immediately tell if someone is at basic competence or elite from how they move and use their abilities.  I think I got off topic and incoherent :)"

The only game that gave me all three was MapleStory before the content got all sorts of simplified:   Exp-Grind: Hitting the level cap in any game never felt fun to me. I prefer games where leveling up enough to enjoy your character is easy but hitting the level cap is an inordinate task, presuming the grind also has enjoyable gameplay and reasonable loot. The first major raid, Zakum, took 4-5 full parties and groups would have to work around a schedule organized on a popular forum.  Omok is still my favorite mini-game   Currently, I settle for Path of Exile has 1.5 out of 3: An enjoyable grind and half-decent grouping."

Look at GW2, immensely popular MMORPG currently, but some of the easiest PvE i've ever played because of the massive amounts of players that just look to play dress up and get a hard on whenever a new cash shop item is revealed. Thats why the model for gaming companies has shifted from focusing on tough PvE, PvP, etc into whatever generates the most revenue, which is ofc, the cash shop.  That's what started the downfall of casual PvE in MMORPGS Gaming companies stopped focusing on creating difficult challenging content in favor of the cash shop items so the casual players can happily play dress up and look like a bunch of fairies and role play.  Hardcore crowd of MMORPG players are there, but its definitely declined BIG TIME. Casuals now rule the landscape."
MMORPG,3dymal,HinduHamma,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:29:46 2015 UTC,"It really excels in providing a sense of adventure while questing. The questing is very good with full voice acting and the phasing is amazing but IMO this is a single player game pretending to be an MMO. Grouping is almost non existent, there is no real end game, and if you want WvW pvp just play guild wars because that is also B2P, has structured PvP, and they have a new expansion coming out soon.  I am not kidding when I say ESO is a single player game. There is no reason to group because the main story, mage's guild, and fighter's guild quests are all instanced. Then when you hit 50, you find out you have to do the quests you already did again for the other two factions.  The adventure was kind of fun the first time but the VR system blows. In terms of money game is worth it if you get it on sale but I'd rather spend my time playing a game where I got to play with other people."

It's also worth mentioning that subscribing will net you a monthly allotment of their virtual currency (Crowns), and if you subscribe long enough, you can accrue enough to outright purchase the DLC permanently.

Game looks decent enough, but behind all that is just a simple MMORPG with not really many interesting things going on.   I also disliked the idea of having an epic story to go through, only to lose immersion quickly because when the cinematic is done you see countless others when supposedly you were ""the one"". I get it, it's an MMORPG, but it did ruin immersion for me. Generally I'd suggest it only if you're really into Elder Scrolls lore, because they've managed to make the game feel like an Elder Scrolls game atleast. Exploring is a lot of fun.   So yeah, into the lore? Get it. Into solid mmorpg mechanics with expansive endgame? I'd pass :)"

Do you feel like you still want more? If the answer is yes, I would recommend picking it up. Not saying you should support crappy games because you're a fan of the series - ESO is a decent enough game in its own right and your love of the lore will probably make it completely worth it for you.

The crafting is relevant as once you get to endgame, you'll more than likely be using crafted gear that you made, or purchased along with some pieces out of raiding if you decide to go that route.

MMORPG,3dymal,IzGameIzLyfe,2,Mon Jul 20 16:58:47 2015 UTC,"ESO is not p2w int he slightest. As a matter of fact crafted potions are a lot more effective than bought potions. The cash shop is mostly mounts, costumes, cosmetic pets, and some consumables that aren't in any way powerful (like treasure maps). If you choose to pay the $15/month sub, it gives you crowns (cash shop currency), access to DLC if you dont want to outright buy the DLC, and 10% gold/experience boosts. That's 10%, not 100%."
MMORPG,3dymal,newslooter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:14:56 2015 UTC,Imperials absolute monsters when it comed to stamima builds or tanking. I think only in pvp does it matter whether u have imperial or not. But thats not really p2w since i consider imperial edition part of the base game. There is also a new dlc coming up for $25. Which makes eso a pretty expensive game if u wish to play it. But in no way are rest of the contents p2w

MMORPG,3dymal,krisko612,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:24:05 2015 UTC,"As you said t's definitely not like previous installments of the Elder Scrolls series.   Not a surprise though since it's an MMORPG and dev'd by a different team. They've polished a lot of the stuff that was a big issue on release, but like SWTOR, I felt like it was a better single-player experience versus a MMORPG (as others have mentioned).   I bought it back for $15 during that GMG sale, so I think it was a pretty good buy; however, I definitely would not pay full price for the game, so probably just sit back and wait for a sale.   Hell, maybe download SWTOR if you haven't played it and see how you like that. Then after playing, picture reskinning the game with an ES look, some different mechanics (Combat) and boom it's somewhat the same with a more heavy single-player story-driven game."

MMORPG,3dxne7,Ashton187,3,Mon Jul 20 11:41:08 2015 UTC,I remember when I used to be obsessed with trying all the different mmos.  I'd look at a list and they all had something different.  About 8-10 years later and they're all clones now...
MMORPG,3dxne7,tisokan,2,Mon Jul 20 18:22:00 2015 UTC,This is pretty much the opposite of what Ashton is saying. How can they all be clones if they are catering to niches?
MMORPG,3dxne7,LocusOfCharr,2,Tue Jul 21 21:52:25 2015 UTC,Yes there are a few niches and they all copy eachother to meet that niche.  There are many mmos for each niche and many are clones of eachother.  Mmo in itself is a niche is what I got from him.
MMORPG,3dxne7,tisokan,4,Tue Jul 21 22:02:30 2015 UTC,"It's funny, because I can go and look at a list of current and upcoming MMOs, and there is still a lot of variety.  Weird.  It's almost like I'm basing my statements on actually looking at a list of current and upcoming MMOs while you're just crying to cry.  Theme park MMOs will always be more popular.  They are the safer play for AAA."

MMORPG,3dxne7,tisokan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:38:47 2015 UTC,I think you're right.  We're on the cusp of the post-WoW world of niche and small title MMOs that are no longer forced to chase the Warcraft style theme park design.
MMORPG,3dxne7,Gnarlstone,-3,Mon Jul 20 17:11:03 2015 UTC,"Ding ding ding. I doubt we'll see another MMO even touch WoW in popularity. As much as I want to say FFXIV is the 'next big thing,' it just won't be nearly as big as WoW. Not because it's a bad game, but mostly because it isn't the genre that's popular right now. MMOs have definitely stepped out of the spotlight for MOBAs right now."
MMORPG,3dxne7,megaoka,-1,Mon Jul 20 16:48:36 2015 UTC,"Mobas are big that's true. But lately I think some players are starting to feel a burn out on that genre. Much like the MMO genre, new Mobas are coming out and just falling flat next to LoL and Dota. Sure niche titles like HOTS will have some good success and followings since they change the formula slightly. That said, I think it's much more easy to get burned out on the MOBA genre than the MMORPG genre because the games are much more similar.   I won't even barely touch MOBAs anymore. That said, it took 4 or so years to get to this point, so we probably won't see a decline anytime soon. However, I'm not sure it's the NEXT big thing anyway. It's more of a middle phase."
MMORPG,3dxne7,newslooter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:00:09 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you. I've definitely had my fill of MOBAs. 2000 hours in Dota 2 and I never want to see it again. However I feel like if we see a transition happen, it's going to be towards a new game. I play a ton of FFXIV but hoping the game you're currently playing is going to become the ""next big thing"" seems like wishful thinking."
MMORPG,3dxne7,megaoka,0,Mon Jul 20 18:33:32 2015 UTC,"Not just this, but the market as a whole has become a hostile development area. Big names in the industry have tried and failed to make it big.  With the rise of F2P, the players are starting to notice the huge negatives that come with it and are now looking to other payment models. With the current negative trend subs are getting, this removes the capacity to pull in normal investors. Sub models represent steady revenue streams with predictable peaks and dips, but F2P is volatile with its unpredictable nature.  With a hostile market and unpredictable revenue, the market is very tricky to pull investors. And with low investor interest = low development."
MMORPG,3dxne7,Ashton187,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:05:06 2015 UTC,"FFXIV isn't big because it isn't Blizzard. Literally, if it was Blizzard instead of Square Enix people would go crazy and say this is the best game ever."
MMORPG,3dxne7,RektoKyoma,2,Mon Jul 20 18:08:22 2015 UTC,"FF14 also had a hugely disasterous launch with a ton of bad publicity at massive cost to the company. The fact that it's seen any resurgence at all, much less one of this magnitude, is an industry miracle.  MMOs today almost universally function as solo theme parks to max level with optional dungeons along the way. I think that FF14 is much better for having required dungeons, but I also believe that it hurts the population. It also has no PvP, which cuts another market out."
MMORPG,3dxne7,xenthum,4,Tue Jul 21 06:54:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, valid points."
MMORPG,3dxne7,RektoKyoma,3,Tue Jul 21 15:04:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no. There are lots of reasons that FFXIV will never be WoW. Little PvP (and what is there is a joke), failure of a launch with 1.0, poor content updating/holiday events, among other things.   It certainly isn't just because they're not blizzard."
MMORPG,3dxne7,BeepBoopRobo,5,Tue Jul 21 19:49:14 2015 UTC,"PvP point is valid, no excuse about that. But when you say poor ""content updating"" and ""among other things"" I can't help but think you are a hater..."
MMORPG,3dxne7,RektoKyoma,3,Tue Jul 21 19:51:31 2015 UTC,"I played the game since 1.0. The game is fun, but it's super flawed. It's not the next wow.  Have you played the holiday content or compared it to wow/GW2? Have you compared the content release schedule of it to wow?  Holiday stuff in the game is to the point where it's almost insulting. And the content schedule is very slow in comparison.  I'd play the game much more often if they released good holiday content or pvp content."
MMORPG,3dxne7,BeepBoopRobo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:59:56 2015 UTC,"They release new dungeons raids and other features (gold saucer and such, we even got a new class in 2.4) every 2-3 months. In WoW it takes 8 months for a big patch .So yes, FFXIV wins in this aspect. Holiday content is actually not that bad, I experienced the christmas event and it was nice, though I don't think this should be a big factor when comparing WoW and FFXIV. I don't know about GW2, but I am a PvE player and I've heard that GW2 PvE content is lackluster. I read people saying it is completly pointless for them to log after the reach level 80. But as I said I haven't played the game. FFXIV has the best graphics, the best storyline (even though past expansions were amaizing, WoD storyline was a complete disaster) and the best Endgame compared to WoW (so much to do, a real themepark). This is why I think FFXIV is superior to WoW now and would be bigger if it was a Blizzard game, but that's just my opinion..."
MMORPG,3dxne7,RektoKyoma,3,Tue Jul 21 20:12:50 2015 UTC,"None of that is really true. Go look at patch release schedules and compare them. I played wow for 8 years. The pace of content release is much faster in wow.  And the holiday content is big for wow and gw2. They're actually significant. Dungeons, loot, outdoor raids and events, pvp content etc. Holiday content in wow/gw2 are actually things. They happen every month or so. In FFXIV, it's a couple quests and an item or two. That's it. It's not even a comparison. For instance, compare halloween - FFXIV, WoW, GW2  And yes, FFXIV beats WoW in graphics. You're comparing it to a 10 year old game. But the endgame is not as robust in FFXIV as you say it is. Especially not before recently.  And again, a complete lack of PvP is an extreme killer that is a big reason why this game will never be as big as wow."
MMORPG,3dxne7,BeepBoopRobo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:47:47 2015 UTC,"Well you are speaking of what WoW was 6 years ago, which is fair because that's when it was a good game. Since ARR the content releases on FFXIV are sure faster than WoW as of WoD. As I said before, people had to wait 8 months for the ONLY big patch in the expansion. I still think FFXIV is a really strong PvE game atm. I don't know how it was pre ARR but now it's hands down the best PvE MMO in the market by a large margin. I don't think GW2 can be considerer a big MMO (for me personally) because, as I said before, it's PvE is almost non-existent."
MMORPG,3dxne7,RektoKyoma,2,Tue Jul 21 21:15:38 2015 UTC,"Right. It's a fantastic game, but the marketing and hype just isn't there. It's a real shame. There is a silver lining though, and that's the fact it's going to have a stable playerbase for quite some time."
MMORPG,3dxne7,megaoka,3,Mon Jul 20 18:34:48 2015 UTC,"Which I have no issue with at all.   I think back in April there was a survey done showing about 730k active characters. It's nowhere near WoW's population, but that's a fantastic number still for an MMORPG, especially a P2P one.   As you said, a stable playerbase will be no issue and there will probably always be a thriving community on most servers. Couple the playerbase with constant support and the new expansion you get a great game.   Where FFXIV is right now is a great place and I'm very happy they managed to recover after the horrid experience the company and players went through with 1.0."
MMORPG,3dxne7,Heavykiller,7,Mon Jul 20 22:40:47 2015 UTC,"Even if that were true (I'm not convinced), there will still by definition be one that's bigger than all the others."
MMORPG,3dxne7,Seaman182,3,Mon Jul 20 16:27:17 2015 UTC,"Right, but that doesn't mean its dominant. WoW is the western markets most dominate MMO because of its sub numbers. If its numbers where closer to FFXIV's it wouldn't be dominant, just the leading MMO.  Dominant = Exercising the most power, control, or influence"
MMORPG,3dxne7,Ashton187,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:36:31 2015 UTC,"As far as I can see, this is the first time the word ""dominant"" has come up in this conversation.  I assumed the OP was simply talking about the most popular MMO, especially since s/he mentioned GW2 being the ""second spot.""  Still, even after shifting the goalpost I still disagree.

I'm guessing that now that MMOs are a more popular thing overall, there's no way you can make something that fits everyone, because the small groups would go to the smaller MMOs that are more focused towards what they like.  That said, it is impossible to predict the next big MMO. It's impossible to predict the next big thing at all. But it will come, eventually. And it's not going to be a sequel."

MMORPG,3dxne7,faern,-1,Mon Jul 20 16:13:02 2015 UTC,"in my opinion the genre needs to die for a few years, it needs to go back to what it was before WoW which was largely niche.

That's my opinion on the matter"
MMORPG,3dxne7,xeikai,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:13:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly, nothing until probably the next WoW.   Thanks to the over-saturation of MMORPGs (with plenty of cash cows), MMORPGs have become somewhat of a dying genre. WoW, EQ, etc. came in a glorious time when it was something new and fresh with people wanting to try it out, but only having limited options between MMORPGs to play. Now you can choose between hundreds of MMORPGs and a lot of them are just not good. The audience is spread across a ton of games & people begin to slowly lose interest in these game over time depending on whether they're just tired of a lot of these games having the same formula or some other reason.  People say it's Black Desert Online, etc. but that's just not going to happen. I think BDO will do pretty well, but it will gain a niche audience and stick with it. Aside from EQ Next and BDO (I can't really see them taking down WoW ether) I don't really think anymore ""upcoming MMORPGs"" have what it takes to topple the Big Daddy."

MMORPG,3dy5he,codehazza,18,Mon Jul 20 14:21:23 2015 UTC,Because it's new.  That's it.
MMORPG,3dy5he,squidgod2000,10,Mon Jul 20 17:00:55 2015 UTC,"In my opinion the progression system and being mission-based are actually interesting, though I'm not a fan of how damage spongey enemies are."
MMORPG,3dy5he,Kenpokid4,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:54:19 2015 UTC,That's what makes it challenging right? If it was an easy game it would be no fun.
MMORPG,3dy5he,TrickstaSama,7,Tue Jul 21 00:33:58 2015 UTC,Damage sponging is kinda boring to me. I'd rather be more at risk of taking a large amount of damage.

MMORPG,3dy5he,valmendor,8,Mon Jul 20 15:19:19 2015 UTC,There's nothing new on the market and it's summer so people are bored looking for anything to play.   This is a prime example of flavour of the month
MMORPG,3dy5he,Josetheone1,4,Mon Jul 20 15:16:41 2015 UTC,"Hype, hype, hype! Myself? I'll never touch another My.com (Mail.ru) game on principle."
MMORPG,3dy5he,CrowingOne,2,Mon Jul 20 14:49:45 2015 UTC,"The progression is novel, the classes are quite diverse (and you can freely switch), it isn't P2W, it has action combat, and the world-building isn't bad either.  It's not that revolutionary, but why the hell not? It's managed to capture the attention of my Warframe-grinding brother and Eden Eternal-repping girlfriend at the same time, which is quite a feat.  What you said about the areas is true; there are some very large ones with plenty of strangers running around, but they're still instances. The combat criticism, though... That's really something that improves as you progress, especially once you get the opportunity to try out all the game's classes in the simulator.  My aforementioned brother, for example, was about ready to quit until he discovered that some classes don't use ability cooldowns in their mechanics. Given how different the playstyle of each class is, I expect to hear that kind of story a few times."
MMORPG,3dy5he,Seaman182,2,Mon Jul 20 16:46:03 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you guys have only played a short bit. The game gets fun the more you play. The dungeons get so hard that I have yet finished a few of them because people quit. I am at 7k prestige at the moment. There are a few open world maps but it is mostly instance based. The combat has something for everyone. If you don't like one class, change to another without starting over again. That is the beauty of this game. For me, I love the game and will keep playing for some time."
MMORPG,3dy5he,Kaysyn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:55:19 2015 UTC,"Isn't it basically the same genre as Vindictus and Dragon Nest? Some people like the instanced linear Brawler-type action. Not a fan myself, but it'll probably draw those players."
MMORPG,3dy5he,Autumnplay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:22:56 2015 UTC,The difference here is that it's not much of a brawler. I would compare it to instance-based neverwinter. Dragon nest and Vindictus have much better combat.

MMORPG,3dyys8,Lawlta,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:04:14 2015 UTC,"The game has been polished so much but with a focus on the PvE content.  Good things about PvP:    You can PvP only with PvP gear: PvE DS gear has been nerfed inside bgs/arenas and warplots. Queues popping superfast at cap level. Arenas have three brackets 2v2, 3v3 and 5v5 and the new season will be launched right after F2P patch. Prestige (PvP currency) is by far the most rewarding currency in game.   Bad things:    Warplots? World PvP will be back with F2P launch, right now the whole population is on the PvE servers.   In a few words, if you want to PvP WildStar is a really promising game because the combat system is awesome for PvP.  That said I think you'd better wait for the F2P release this fall if you plan on totally dedicating yourself to PvP in Wildstar."
MMORPG,3dyys8,vulcanraven89,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:17:31 2015 UTC,World PvP doesn't really exist cause the PvP server is dead.   There is 1 server left. Most people play exile. It is fun for a small subset of the mmorpg player base.

MMORPG,3dyvyj,begud,3,Mon Jul 20 17:32:56 2015 UTC,"I've been playing the game and I really enjoy it, but I'm looking at it more as a GW1 type game than a true ""MMO"". There are hubs and areas where you get that MMO feeling, but the real fun is in the instances.  I think the game could do well if marketed right. The most important part of the game, the combat, is really solid IMO and a blast to play. They can eventually build all the secondary stuff around that. I'm sure I'll start to get bored eventually, but right now I can't get enough! Cryomancer is a blast!"
MMORPG,3dyvyj,Seasniffer,3,Mon Jul 20 17:44:03 2015 UTC,"The game's combat is fun, but seeing how creative the unlocked classes can be, the starter ones are dwarfed in comparison.  I was going for monk and today I finally did the calulations on what I need to get it. I need like 18k more sparks (in general, not a specific one). So I think I'm just going to get necro the next reset wednesday and get that class first. Just to mix things up and give me something a bit more entertaining to play. Especially if my 2nd week cap isn't high enough."
MMORPG,3dyvyj,PalwaJoko,2,Tue Jul 21 01:26:12 2015 UTC,I am having some issues with how the mouse button combos and targeting interact when mobs bunch up. Playing ranged is a pile of fun though.
MMORPG,3dyvyj,tso,2,Tue Jul 21 02:14:05 2015 UTC,"I honestly looking at this game as a 3rd person Destiny MMO with proper melee combat. The whole futuristic sci-fi/fantasy motif really makes me think Destiny.  I'm enjoying myself but I do see some issues with the overall gameplay and content. I just hit 2k prestige last night and am making my way towards the Necromancer class. My friend is 6k prestige and he is enjoying it, as well, though he does comment on how much of a grind it becomes.  I'm gonna stick with it for a bit. I think this could be a great game given some time and updates. It's a good game with a fair bit of content but not as much as other games like this start out with.  The Alchemist is a lot of fun."

There isn't much creativity as far as quests go, the combat being that it's made for tablets in mind is very limited aka 4ish abilities. Also, traveling through a map is fucking stupid. You cant just walk through the wilderness because of how the designed the terain, you have to pretty much follow a path through every map as far as I can tell.  They have housing, player owned shops and some other cool ideas, open looting pvp, clan wars ect. In the end, its an OK game which could turn into something better but I wouldn't pay to get into the alpha or beta again if I had to do it over knowing what I know now."

MMORPG,3dve1p,Juniterio,2,Mon Jul 20 10:24:15 2015 UTC,I have the same opinion on this game. Had high hopes for rekindling some ultima nostalgia.  Got bored too fast with their Grindy craft system that you are forced into (at least early levels). Combat is boring. They put in moba style combat control... Poorly. Wish I had my 100 dollars back.
MMORPG,3dve1p,vivisi,2,Mon Jul 20 05:23:30 2015 UTC,"They put in moba style combat control... Poorly. Wish I had my 100 dollars back.   I think you've got this the other way around... Sandbox MMOs have been doing simplistic click-to-move combat since before MOBAs existed, and Albion is very much a successor to those games."
MMORPG,3dve1p,Seaman182,3,Mon Jul 20 08:53:05 2015 UTC,"I am familiar with this. However, QWERDF is strait out of the MOBAverse... However moba combat is usually faster reflex exciting with skill shots that matter.  Say it's alpha if you want, but since it's being catered towards mobile I doubt much will change here."
MMORPG,3dve1p,vivisi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:35:06 2015 UTC,No disagreements here; I can't speak to the quality because I haven't played it.
MMORPG,3dve1p,Seaman182,3,Mon Jul 20 16:19:12 2015 UTC,"What turned Mr off a bit was the tablet thing. Not that I'm against gaming for tablets, I'm just a pc gamer and I hate games that are, for a lack of a better description, dumbed down to allow for the wider market. Ports to tablet I don't mind, just not the other way. Still gonns watch the dev though"
MMORPG,3dve1p,KombatWombat1,4,Mon Jul 20 03:39:32 2015 UTC,about a 100 hours here - seems like a great concept but I feel a lot of it is missing something. DOn't know what. Everything feels very basic in it's implementation.  Also - Blog Plug (and now that sounds like a terrible sex toy) - I wrote several posts about it over the last couple weeks
MMORPG,3dve1p,j3w3ls,3,Mon Jul 20 02:08:15 2015 UTC,"You spend most of your time crafting. To unlock the ability to make new weapons, you must craft the previous tier of weapon repeatedly. The same must be done for armor, and several times per tier if you mix armor types or weapons. There are also different tiers of crafting tools. So, to harvest the materials for teir 3, you first have to grind out x-number of novice's pickaxe before you can make journeyman pickaxe. In short, if you want to level up you're spending most of your time gathering at crafting nodes. So if you don't like crafting you won't like this game.  I find it a bit boring tbh. But it fills the full-loot pvp void in my life, and it's something to do why I watch youtube videos."
MMORPG,3dve1p,DrRoxophd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:45:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I could understand why you feel it's boring, but in my opinion I feel like with a player ran everything I like the whole idea that you can still be useful as a crafter throughout the lifespan of the game and there's people like me who loves profiting off the hardwork they've spent.  Where in other games your hardworks fairly good for a while until people out level what you can make whereas in AO everything is player craftable, everything is player grown, etc... for PvPer's you can practically just opt out of doing this once you hit a certain level and make money, gear (& gear unlocks from fighting/farming mobs+dungeons), etc... from just pvping."
MMORPG,3dve1p,DrRoxophd,2,Sun Jul 19 23:00:28 2015 UTC,I actually don't mind the combat. And I like the system of linking abilities to pieces of armor. Around when would I be able to stop crafting stuff all the time? Because that sounds more like my type of game.
MMORPG,3dve1p,j3w3ls,3,Sun Jul 19 23:15:36 2015 UTC,"Once you hit t3/t4 you can pretty much go right into yellow pvp zones and farm mobs and fight other users.  Gaining a lot of silver.  After so long solo is possible, but people tend to group so duo+ or being in a guild becomes a necessity if you want to stick to this style of play (fighting others for for their loot/using the marketplace for items)."
MMORPG,3dve1p,NihiloZero,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:47:34 2015 UTC,"the thing is you don't have to - you can spend your entire time grinding mobs -upping your ability to use higher weapons and armor and earn enough to purchase what you need. Mobs drop a decent amount of silver (plus some decent, and expensive craftoing materials) - more if you find a good spot plus if you focus on combat you can probably gank people for their stuff in the pvp zones"
MMORPG,3dve1p,Kyul,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:11:02 2015 UTC,Certain aspects are necessarily going be more grindy during the earlier stages of a open-world sandbox.  More people will need to grind at the start just so that there are enough items to go around.  And those items will be more valuable during the earlier stages so... it makes sense that people would be grinding.
MMORPG,3dve1p,Downvote56,3,Mon Jul 20 07:54:32 2015 UTC,I kind of wish I hadn't spent the 50 because what I learned from the alpha is that I would rather wait until release for a game like this. There is so much grinding and farming that I feel it's a waste for the month long part.  Closed beta I will definitely shoot for higher than t4 which is where I left off.   It's a really great game and I love that I can play it on my phone.  Excited for release.
MMORPG,3dve1p,skilliard4,5,Mon Jul 20 03:39:51 2015 UTC,"Put over 80hrs into it. I don't get the comparisons to UO. It's top down, sure, but beyond that I don't see it.   I've been griefed and lost 70k worth of gear in a green t5 dungeon. My thoughts on that were.. Boy what a long way to run without a horse. So I opted to die and lose it all to be teleported to the nearest town.   Having said that, I think the game shows some promise - the grind is good. The penalty for death is just a tiny bit too high though. Also, I think there needs to be much more skill required in pvp.. And pve I suppose.  This game will be my next big thing I hope. And I sincerely hope they don't whore out pay 2 win. Pay for aesthetic customizations should give them long term longevity."
MMORPG,3dve1p,HonestTrouth,2,Sun Jul 19 22:17:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I fully agree, I think I've put in about that much time as well.  I feel like the grind is only noticeable when I go back to do things that are tiers lower than I am.  For instance when I hit T4 adept gear for ranger gear and tried to switch to mage + cloth, you can really feel the grind (being tedious), but you never really notice it when focusing on something from start to finish because you casually gain fame while focusing on the other hundred things on your mind.  You pretty much summed up my opinion fairly well."
MMORPG,3dve1p,NihiloZero,2,Sun Jul 19 22:57:32 2015 UTC,"Its fun, but its a small niche game. IMO it's worth trying out when it launches as f2p, but it's not worth dumping $50 just to play in the Alpha unless you have a ton of money to blow on games."
MMORPG,3dve1p,Davidcrone83,2,Mon Jul 20 01:54:38 2015 UTC,"I stopped playing after 2 weeks.  I was really in to it at first. First mmo that got me ""trapped"" in years.  But fact of the matter is, there is no way to advance past t5 unless you are in a guild that owns a red zone.  Can't even craft past t5 unless you have access to a t6+ workstation. Not even in capital cities.   Made it completely pointless to play past the 2 week mark."
MMORPG,3dve1p,harumphhh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:35:33 2015 UTC,When the game develops it's likely that some guilds will open up their territories to create a free space for people -- like has happened at various locations within Eve Online.
MMORPG,3dve1p,illgot,2,Mon Jul 20 07:58:10 2015 UTC,"I love the game and the concept. Personally, I hope the devs don't listen too much to a lot of the negative comments out there. Most of the negativity is just coming from players used to having their hands held through a straight forward progression of quests, or from players who want to play solo...which completely defeats the purpose of playing an MMO.  This isn't a game where you have to do anything you don't want to do. Players are intended to specialize and work with others. Guilds will need players focused on PvP. They'll need players focused on gathering. They'll need players focused on crafting. Sure, there will be some overlap, but in the end, many players will need to specialize in a few things if they want to reach the absolute top tiers.  In theory players will be able to play however they want. Some can focus on crafting plate armor. Others will focus on PvPing in red zones and trying grief others. Then you will have players that focus on PvPing to stop griefers. Some players will make money protecting caravans transporting goods. Others might focus on farming. Some may just focus on trading, going from town to town trying to buy low and sell high (I love town by town AH's instead of a universal auction board).   Albion is placing a lot of emphasis on the in game economy. Hopefully, the economy works as intended and creates real value for players who want to play focused on any of the endeavors they choose. If they can get the right blend of UO, Runescape, and EvE it could be a game I play for a long time."
MMORPG,3dve1p,Kaizermos,2,Mon Jul 20 16:10:34 2015 UTC,"Currently the game has mediocre combat, a boring world, a lot of boring grinding (you need low tier planks to craft high tier planks, so you're always going back to the boring early stages to gather tons of low level materials into perpetuity), zones that barely have anything worth seeing,  player owned real estate all looks the same, cities look identical, characters look identical, zerg guilds have major advantages, and the game lacks so many quality of life features.   I worry that the devs just don't have the game design chops to take this idea and mold it into something good. You can't even zoom out on the world map to get a good idea of how things work. Guild ownership is represented by tiny banners, guild ownership of plots in towns is distinguished by tiny blue borders around plots owned by friendly members, there's a giant button that caused a lot of players to lose their private islands in confusion (the players fault, but why is that particular feature arranged in such a dumb way?), the skill tree has a horrible mix of vertical and horizontal progression that makes no sense, and  the whole thing has zero immersion because the resource sinks are so blatant and so logically weak. For instance, you need to feed a smelter in order for it not to break down. Okay... Kind of dumb that a smelter needs food but whatever... You go and farm some carrots but apparently carrots aren't food in this universe and your smelter won't eat your fucking carrots so you have to take your carrots and make carrot soup which you can then spoon feed to your smelter to allow it to function. Oh, and you need to repair the structure as well. Like I said, it's stupid.   The thing is though, there are zero fantasy sandbox mmos on the market, at least zero sandbox mmos that aren't blatantly pay to win,  so this game has a desperate audience giving feedback and trying to mold this game into something worth playing. Personally, I wish I had my $50 back but there is still a faint glimmer of hope that something decent comes out of this mess.   One more thing that really bugs me is that the $100 founder pack is so much better than the $50 that it's a joke. Oh, and for a game that is so focused on guilds, the guild interface is shit."
MMORPG,3dve1p,Kamarihi,2,Mon Jul 20 16:12:37 2015 UTC,It looked very appealing to me until I understood the skill point system.  I do not like the idea of my advancement behind held back by the time gated skill points or the idea of fighting someone who is held back even more because they are FTP.  I was excited about this game for a week and kept watching streams until this became an issue.

Instead of trying to reduce the trinity like GW2 why not try to expand it with various support roles? What about dedicated crowd control characters? Rather than downsizing in the future the developers need to get creative when making classes and roles.
MMORPG,3dwqg6,Godsopp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:39:07 2015 UTC,and the sheer amount of different buffs you could literally put god mode onto your team but since the swarms of enemies were so high on some maps  even god mode doesn't make you kill everything (unless you was fire/kin you could solo everything on hardest difficulty in 5 man groups as long as you managed cooldowns and didnt overpull and that was a support still being a support just the cc and buffs were so good)
MMORPG,3dwqg6,420Knockout,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:36:42 2015 UTC,"Many older MMOs incentivized social dynamics well through simple mechanics like party-bonuses without eliminating solo-viability, well-designed dungeons, and content pacing through making players run or fly everywhere.  These are all fallen into decline due to stagnation in quest design, fast-travel for player convenience, elimination of grinding in various games (to mitigate bots), and removal of party bonuses to cater to older players who want to solo."

It's like twitter without the hashtages and pictures, but because it's only between your friends it acts as a safe zone for casual conversation that doesn't limit your awareness of other people because you'll regularly see friends converse to other friends.  Many games overemphasize guilds and lack a system to enable individual friendships, Buddies Chat fills that niche."

MMORPG,3dwfw7,ihronn,2,Mon Jul 20 09:15:03 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard it's crap nowadays, and mostly P2W. I tried going back to playing Maple Story Europe just to see what had changed and didn't recognize most of the game due to the ridiculous amounts of jobs/classes. I liked the graphics and the mechanics mostly because it didn't feel like a generic MMO. The class advancement was nice, it made you earn the right to become more powerful, not just by grinding, but by doing special quests. There are lots of quests and if you take some time to read the text you will be amused by the story, but most of them are boring. Party quests (dungeons) are really fun to play with friends or guildies, they have puzzles and sometimes require a certain class to be present in order to advance, you win a lot of exp and nice items, the downside is only one party per channel can enter a Party Quest, so imagine 5 party leaders clicking as fast as they can so that as soon as one party leaves the party quest, another one enters. I didn't make it very far into the game, even though I played almost everyday for hours. I was a kid, so most of the time I had no idea what I was doing, but it was still fun as hell. I'm thinking of playing MS2 if/when it goes global. It has the same appeal the original MS had, a fun and social MMO, and they probably (I hope) won't make the same mistakes they did with the first game. Edit: Punctuation."

MMORPG,3dwfw7,Hydrolac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:04:41 2015 UTC,"I was reading a steam review and it's probably the most accurate review I've read(It's worth the read):  MapleStory is that one game you're probably never going to find another game of its calibre. It has that feel of nostalgia even though you're new to the game. Attractive art styles that are pixelated and 2D and manages to still look cartoony and cute all together draw people in this game with its uniqueness.  Maplestory was in its prime long back when generation Y was around 6 years old(2005 debut). If you compare the leveling from old Maplestory to post-big bang Maplestory, youll notice a huge difference. Its easier to hit level 100, but back then whoever was over level 100 was a god. Old Maplestory had challenging leveling, but once you hit level 50 or something above, you have a really nice sense of euphoria, and then realize you are far from 100, and then strive further. There was no 5.5mil damage cap, since 1k was really good damage.  But enough about old times; Maple has changed. Most people say that the old maple is so much better than the new maple, and while that is true, there are also a lot of points that keep the balance scale even between good and bad.  Of course Maplestory will never be as good as it was back then; it evolves for newer audience because Nexon know the older audience will eventually quit. This is an instant gradification era, people want to level up quickly and not really slowly to the point where it bores them to level up only 10 times a week. So, Nexon implemented an easier leveling system. I personally think that this was the right call, because the game would be dead if they hadn't implemented something to make the levels easier to obtain.  Nexon did milk this game so much that its clear instead of a thick white, but remember that you are the decision maker; you control what you spend on this game. Its possible to get cubes and permanent cash shop items with enough time, which is what all games offer to some degree. I personally think that this game is just ""Pay for Conveinence"" instead, but thats my opinion solely. The reason why I think its pay for conveinence is that even if you had payed your way to the billions of mesos, an average player would still not know what the hell he was doing with it, and blow it on chairs or something useless and non-beneficial.  Don't play this game if you dont like being tempted to ever pay for a Free to Play game. Its not worth it in the end for you, because they will make schemes to try to draw more money. Although this is true, remember that this game, when stripped to just the gameplay, is irreplacable. It doesn't need cash to win the game. Its fun to finally get want you want, whether it be 250, or that overpowered item, or just to meet the good people in a hacker community."

MMORPG,3dwfw7,Neurotics,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:54:03 2015 UTC,"MapleStory was the game that most recall popularizing the Free2Play model in the West through it's cohesive art-style, social atmosphere, and catchy marketing.  It had an excellent base game with:   a long grind to incentivize group parties and attendance of party quests large zones that made the world feel huge profitable (and challenging) raid bosses that I personally remember feeling proud to be in a group for regular runs as a teen Socially-enabling party quests design A myriad of creatively designed items to encourage collecting-mentality Adorable in-game mini-games to satiate bored players Am amazing soundtrack for all of its regions   This was back in 2005-2008 or so. Over the next few years, Nexon riddled it with Pay4Power options and implemented changes that reduced the value of many of the above points.   Percentage-based potions that eliminated resource management or the need for healers in raids Party Quests were overshadowed by new party-verse-party content that left no room for social dynamics Leveling curve was non-challenging, the competitive allure surrounding reaching level200 is gone (they even raised the level cap) Many between-town zones were removed shrunken to claustrophobic dimensions Classes were buffed to absurd levels and make more generic. Party Quests were subsequently changed to be ""more accessible"" which is another way of saying less engaging Older raid bosses became soloable in a matter of minutes...   It really became quite a mess before I left, and one can infer from other posts that it only got worse.  I will never forget the music though - The nostalgia is endless."

MMORPG,3du4gm,adag_dot_me,4,Sun Jul 19 17:50:29 2015 UTC,"Mmm now that's a little complicated. Pretty much every MMORPG has some kind of focus on combat. What I can suggest are MMOs with a higher sandbox appeal, but I don't think there's an MMORPG without combat.   First, I didn't play the previous recommendations, so I'm not mentioning them. Now, let's see...  I didn't play Wakfu properly, as people told me after I complained a little that it has a focus on sandbox rather than questing. I still have to get back to it to explore the sandbox aspect properly, but for the little I did like gathering and ""replanting"" mobs, it seems really deep. No idea if you can craft stuff, though.  I've been playing Black Desert and it seems awesome so far. Been hours (and I really mean hours) I don't fight anything as I've been doing quests to raise my contribution points, a type of currency used in the sandbox aspect. The progress is in the likes of theme park, but once the sandbox opportunities open up you can spend much more time with that and I think later on if you want to make more and more money, that's basically what you're gonna do the most (gathering, crafting, moving goods, selling and stuff).  RuneScape has a ton of quests, but they're not quite in a linear fashion. I guess there are some questlines here and there (last time I played was more than two or three years ago), but not all of them will involve fighting. There are lots of skills that focus on gathering, crafting and such, but as always, to get the better things you'll need to be of a high enough level to walk relatively safely around where you have to gather. The problem with gathering and crafting on it is that it's pretty linear. There is a building system, but it's nothing compared to what you're looking for -- you can make your own house, but you can't actually make it.  Alternatively, games like Terraria and Starbound usually have dedicated servers with support for a large amount of players, giving the game an MMO-ish feeling. I didn't play that much of Terraria, but I know in current Starbound combat is more optional than it was last year, when progression was linear and marked by boss fights.  Oh, and as a side note, click ""reply"" on the lower right corner of a message and your answer will be directed to that person :) For example, if you make a new comment intended for my comment wihtout clicking ""reply"", I won't know what you said cos there won't be a notification saying you replied."

Please don't base it off Nexon na anymore- it's old, and hardly relevant. Even though ms1 is fked up now- especially here, doesn't mean that they are doing enough to maintain games now. I recently quit dragon nest cuz the shtty  devs had no support for NA while the nexon team had to beg for even the little features to be added in.

I don't know much about how vindictus was a while ago, but I know that dragon nest has a lot and noticeable support from Nexon GMs the past year, but nothing exciting the year before that. Wizet is the developer of ms1. So if you're blaming the publisher who has less say in features, then that would be flawed because they have less control over things, but I assume you're talking about devs now. I'm just confused myself."

They reached commercial success with their hit game MapleStory and were absorbed into their publishing company, Nexon America. Nexon developed a franchise system and expanded its services to Japan, China, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, the USA, Europe, Brazil, and Vietnam. Eventually, Wizet reached the global world after having finished developing key features of MapleStory.[1]  In Nexon Japan's 2011 financial deck, Wizet announced that Maplestory 2, a 3D sequel to Wizet's hit game, is in development.  And I tot everyone playing maple already know that nexon=maple. All those inkwell diary by nexon kr is more then shows that nexon kr is the leading developer of maple.

To someone else it could be something entirely different.  So maybe the problem here is the games don't fit your version of what a RPG is."

I want my RPG to allow me to choose between being a fighter, a mage... or a politician, a detective, a blacksmith, a bard etc. Most MMO""RPG"" now are only about combat. It's like calling CoD a RPG because you're ""playing"" a soldier and can min/max your gear.  Same with the story: players should be able to have some kind of implication in the world lore (""I want to defend this city OR let it burns to ashes"", ""I want to save the kidnapped prince... or make a pact with the evil warlock instead"" etc.) In most themeparks, you have zero choice: you must follow what the devs wrote for you."

The leveling process in these games isn't notably grindy, but it's so mindless that I can't see any reason to log in.  I'm not sure what to call it.  Maybe a salmon run?

MMORPG,3drblr,IzGameIzLyfe,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:32:04 2015 UTC,"Basically, it all comes down to:   Don't recruit randoms, talk to people first. Don't recruit during times the guild isn't active. People play on regular schedules. Babysit them for a while. They are most likely new and will need some easing into the guild chat.   Other than that, if that's not working, then chances are your guild is going nowhere. It's usually a good idea to make guilds with a group of people that are active from the get go."

MMORPG,3drblr,Direwar,5,Sun Jul 19 04:03:05 2015 UTC,"Nah.  Drama is a linear function to how much you matter in an MMO. The more you get involved, the more the game becomes less about the game and more about politics. Guilds are a prime example. When you're in a pvp guild, just being good isn't enough. You have to collect a bunch of good people and keep them together and produce synergy to win.  Say the wrong thing at the wrong time and you make enemies with the wrong people, guilds can break apart over the most minor of issues, and rivalries between guilds can get pretty ugly, specially with open PvP"
MMORPG,3drblr,elite5472,-2,Sun Jul 19 04:42:32 2015 UTC,"Not a big deal though, switching teams is easy and any guildmates you like probably will also get tired of the BS and eventually quit and then you can recruit them over.  I also like the fact that I can settle things in PvP court."
MMORPG,3drblr,Direwar,2,Sun Jul 19 04:59:23 2015 UTC,"It's never that easy.  Like I said, it all comes down to how involved you get with the community. Guilds that split and divide all the time never make it far in pvp. Cohesive teamwork is far more important that individual strength."

Sandboxes are about enabling players to make their own content more than anything else. I don't think this stands in direct conflict with a somewhat linear game, at least when you first start playing. As you get more experience, learn more about the game world, you want those training wheels gone, so that you can do cool tricks, but that doesn't mean that they're not useful at first."

I just continuously level up all my stats, get better gear, socialize, etc. I don't think there was ever a point of ""end game"" because it would take forever to get ""max"" at everything. It wasn't until flagship titles began defining that idea with making it a point to hit max level, get gear and do these raids.  I think end-game is definitely raid, etc. oriented, but just because an MMORPGS doesn't have an end-game aspect makes it s bad thing. In fact it's pretty good for the case of a lot of MMORPGs with that constant progression in mind. I played Runescape for years thinking there was no real end and it was fantastic.

But since most MMO's seem to be managed by MBA's mindlessly drooling after WoW numbers, we will probably never see a newly developed MMO with any depth.

I'd say a big reason current theme park mmos are so popular is that they are very well designed carrot on a stick continual reward style of gameplay. Just playing ffxiv its worked out to a level every 2-3 hours or so, there's a clearly defined do this, this, that gameplay and anyone who remotly tries can hit max level. Now I'm not saying that's bad or anything, but ot is very simple spoon fed and doesn't require the player to come up with goals or things to be fun for themselves.  In a sandbox mmo you will have potentially a ton of options and no real guiding force saying to do one or another, in many cases even hitting max level isn't a goal sense it will often be capped behind a large xp barrier or just not be a giant advantage to it. The advantage is that for some players the huge amount of options are way more fun and offer a lot more replayability.   Also raiding is not nearly as huge a draw as ypu might think, I can't look up stats but for most mmos its <10% of players that do raiding and actually clear the content."
MMORPG,3drblr,DivinePrince2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:59:39 2015 UTC,"Potentially is a very key word.  In every sandbox MMO this sub-Reddit obsesses about, 99% of the options are pointless garbage that are only there to obfuscate the zero-level heuristics and confuse newbies.  That's why you have people who say EVE is intimidatingly complex, and then veterans talk about how the game isn't that complex once you get past the initial obfuscation.  It's why UO combat boiled down to: ""Magic Missile, Explosion, Energy Bolt, Flame Strike"".  Or, if you're hunting dragons, Energy Vortex and/or Provocation.  Outside of that, get the fuck out you're useless.  It's why SWG boiled down to TKM's spamming knockdowns and turning krayt dragons from ""group content"" to ""laughably easy solo content"".  Sandboxes are a great case study in the concept of strategic collapse and how, with thousands of ""options"", there are actually only a handful of options at most for a player."

MMORPG,3dsoxm,Altruisa,13,Sun Jul 19 02:10:34 2015 UTC,"Vanilla WoW - Orchestrated a fake wedding in order to kill hundreds of players in Moonglade.  My best friend was the one who opened AQ40 and got the black scarab mount.  After that, no one had ever bothered doing the green dragon shard part of the legendary quest line.  A full group was generally needed to farm the dragons, the quest drop was ~1-5% chance, and you needed 4 of them.  I figured out how to split linked mobs on my hunter and would kite them solo (~5-10 minutes per kill I believe).  I'd usually go spend an hour or two here and there killing them whenever I had nothing better to do.  Fast-forward to sometime during Naxx 40, and I have gathered all four items to hand in the quest.  The culmination of that quest hand in, for those that may not know/remember, was spawning a raid version of Eranikus in Moonglade.  In addition to a raid-style green dragon, the entire city erupts in a swarm of shadow elementals that did nothing but spam off shadow volleys ~500 a hit (back in the days when a non-tank had ~4k hps).  The more npcs/pcs they killed, the bigger they got and more damage they did.  I had no interest in completing the quest, but wanted to be sure to maximize the enjoyment of such an event, which was tough given Moonglade was a place where no one but druids went once in a blue moon.  So the plan was hatched to have my friend announce that he was marrying one of the better known female players from the Horde side (we were Alliance) in game.  We posted on the server forums to allow ample time.  We also went to great lengths to ensure players were decked out in their fashionable tuxedos and dresses rather than wearing real gear.  One guy in our guild even wrote a few paragraphs of wedding vows (he was the officiator after all).  Hundreds of people came.  A few of the raiding guilds even cancelled their raid night to attend.  When everything was set, and the groom/bride were doing the aisle walk, I did my hand in.  There's a bit of a build up to the event actually starting.  To be sure no one was tipped off as to what was really going on, the officiator had the vows macro'd so that whenever quest text appeared (I believe it was a server-wide shout), he rattled off a paragraph of text in order to push the chat off everyone's screen.  Aside from that, thankfully no one seemed to recall what the giant centaur walking down the aisle was the herald of...  The event started.  Shades spawned all over, and with the number of 'naked' players and low levels in attendance, people just started dropping dead.  It was pretty much a slaughter for 15-30 minutes while people scrambled to get back to their bodies and attempt to get out of the city alive.  The shades were eventually as tall as the buildings and bones from people rezzing were scattered everywhere.  I miss that WoW."

My job was to recruit as many people as possible and help get the guild geared out with the best reasonable gear at the time, which was armor from GHA and grinding hasla for weapons.   By the time castles were released I had recruited over 300 people, most were from guilds that collapsed and individuals looking to get in on the castle action.  During that time there was a lot of espionage and general infighting among our faction which pretty much set a line of who were our allies and enemies.    Prior to castles coming out I had a spy in an enemy faction guild feed intel to our enemy guild in our own faction which caused them to fight over resources needed to build the castle.  We had a spot that was free of enemies and was pretty much the first to get enough materials for the castle package.   I crafted the pack and hopped on my donkey, swam under the water to the newly released island when castles were released, placed the castle then went to our allies and secured their spot for a castle as well.  Every single on of our enemy guilds failed in getting a castle even though they had greater numbers and better gear than us.

There also was a time when a coalition of 9 clans didn't let our independant clan take Rune and on the next day, we took Aden, leaving their top clan without a castle at all, or that time when our party of a few dudes in C grade took out some players from the strongest alliance on the server, even though there were more of them and they were all in B/A grade, even with a little S.

There was a boss called Imperator Mar'gok in WoW that was very difficult to beat in a PuG group from the dungeon finder. There was a mechanic where he would place a magical mine underneath a random ranged member and if you stood on the mine it would explode and deal damage to the entire raid. If too many mines were detonated in one attempt it would cause a wipe. I went through so many groups with idiots who couldn't move in time or ended up getting pushed on to them by other boss mechanics. I remember staying up until like 5am for a week straight going from group to group in search of one that could kill him. I had to do it with random people since I wasn't in a guild at the time.   Eventually one morning I found an amazing group and we finally killed the Imperator and I got my first ever Ahead of the Curve achievement. That was a fine day.  Maybe the only other thing I could say that would be as good as that was killing Mythic Brackenspore in WoW as a hunter since I was responsible for using the flamethrowers which gave me a huge DPS increase and meant I played a huge role in killing adds and getting the boss down quickly enough.

My friend and I still laugh and talk about this almost a decade later.   So, back on FFXI in maybe 2005-2006, I was in a zone full of gigas, 2 of which were gigas that only spawned once every 21-24 real life hours, and both dropped good bracelets that were worth a decent chunk of gil at the time. Anyways, I was minding my own business, until I saw a few members from one of the more hated mega-linkshells on our server hanging out around one of the spawn areas for one of those special gigas I mentioned earlier.  This particular NM gigas was a pet-type mob, and as such, if it's pet falls, it does use charm at some point during the fight. The NM gigas called Pallas spawned, and the linkshell of jerks got it, so I figured that is that. A little while later, I see one of the guys from that linkshell running towards the telepad to zone to the lower levels of the tower, with Pallas trailing behind him (I guess one of them got charmed and they started having issues). Without even giving it a second's thought, I claimed the mob, and started spamming to my best bud in my linkshell, ""Holy shit dude! I just took Pallas from BotD, GET YOUR ASS UP TO DELKFUTT NOW!""  Now, in FFXI at the time, travel still wasn't incredibly fast like it is nowadays, so my ninja buddy had to run his ass up the entire tower while I was single-handedly keeping Pallas busy on a DPS class long enough for him to get there. The other group would gladly steal the NM back from me if I fell, so it was a tense situation. I kept asking how close my friend was, watching my hp get lower and lower.   At this point, I was sure the NM was gonna be lost to the jerks from the other LS, but with less than 10% hp left on me, my friend popped up  from the lower floors and immediately engaged it, so that when I fell no more than 5 seconds later, Pallas stayed claimed to us. Being a ninja, he was much more equipped for soloing, and was able to finish the Pallas off, and to our surprise, it dropped the bracelets! That night we both logged off with an extra 4 million gil in our pockets, and our heads held high knowing we were able to take a NM and get the drop over one of the largest, most hated linkshells on the server."

That's even worse, especially coupled with all the things in the game that you are encouraged to hoard.  In ESO, you unlock inventory space through ingame currency.

(a $15.00 sub divided by 30 days).  Imagine being given access to everything in a cash shop for 50 cents (in other words... Imagine just subbing to a game the normal way and being able to play and earn everything). Seems like an amazing deal now, sadly... It used to just be the norm.  This is where we're at now, thank the freeloading f2p'ers out there who made it all possible. You pay, they ride your coattails."
MMORPG,3dtjgq,harumphhh,2,Sun Jul 19 17:36:40 2015 UTC,Ffxiv does fine with a sub and so does WoW for that matter. No clue why you are blaming the gamer...a shit ton of us bought ESO on release and subbed. It was garbage so we stopped.
MMORPG,3dtjgq,matjazmuhic,5,Sun Jul 19 19:27:55 2015 UTC,If you sub to ESO this stuff is effectively free. You get more than enough crowns over time to get it all.

Mmorpg gamers these days are stingy as fuck and they want huge games with great systems, tons of updates, stable servers, and every feature under the sun but they want this game to be free and supported by a cash shop that sells ""cosmetics only"" (fuck that, btw. Cool looking gear should come from playing the game not by swiping your credit card).   It's total nonsense. Until mmorpg gamers learn that quality isn't free, we will continue having shit games. It's no coincidence that FFXIV is probably the nicest mmo on the market (theme park, but whatever you think of theme parks theirs is excellent) and it has a sub fee."

MMORPG,3dtjgq,JakBasu,0,Sun Jul 19 20:06:01 2015 UTC,"The thing is, if you DO sub to ESO, then your DLC comes at no additional cost.  You also get crowns every month as a subscriber.  People who have subbed to the game for a significant period of time will tell you that they are able to buy just about everything the Crown Store offers with their monthly crown allotment.    So really, what you're asking for ($15/month sub with access to everything) already exists."
MMORPG,3dtjgq,Ashton187,0,Sun Jul 19 19:55:53 2015 UTC,"Here is the thing for me, a subscription runs even if i play or not.  Thus i feel obligated to play to get something out ofthe money.  Now i can leave the game alone for days without feeling that i am wasting money."

We wouldnt see half of the cool items since there is no real reason they should even be in the game other than cash revenue.  You cant use this analogy as most of the cash shop items cant exist in a subscription based game.  And people arent stingy because they dont want to pay a subscription, they just dont see the value in it. Especially when you compare it to things like ps+ where you actually get whole games and discounts for cheaper than to play one game."
MMORPG,3dtjgq,skilliard4,0,Sun Jul 19 18:26:44 2015 UTC,You have no idea if that stuff was ready and waiting for release with matching content.  You guessing and then basing your entire argument of that
MMORPG,3dtjgq,Ketku_RiGhT,-2,Mon Jul 20 11:47:21 2015 UTC,With or without confirmation you can't honestly argue against that point. All the mounts and costumes in the shop most likely would not be in the game at all if it was still using the sub model. They might have eventually made it into the game (if the game survived long enough xD) but it would have taken them ages to just add cosmetic crap like mounts if they didn't make money off of them directly.

All mounts now run at the same speed and such so a regular horse will do the same as the Lion mount.   From seeing your responses to others saying the same thing you will probably need to go to a sub MMO like WoW or FFXIV. They get paid through the sub fees so they don't have to add every cosmetic item (or any really but still do) and will allow you to earn them in-game. Those are really your only options and, imo, are justified since these companies have to make money. MMOs are expensive."

MMORPG,3dtjgq,raspberrykraken,4,Sun Jul 19 18:28:39 2015 UTC,i think after 3 years full of free content updates it's okay paying $40 for an expansion
MMORPG,3dtjgq,paradoxpancake,-2,Sun Jul 19 20:30:25 2015 UTC,"SWTOR is free to play, GW2 is to pay once to play and get all the content. They just recently decided to add the whole new guild hall system for $40. So I have to pay $60 to get the game and then pay another $40 to get the guild hall. Which is more its initial price.  ESO is still $60 and its dlc is 2,500 crowns... what is that you ask? Why its ingame currency! Why is it is in that? Well they want you to spend money on in game currency to buy it! Oh whats the actual price that it amounts to? $25 roughly. Why didn't they just tell you that from the start? I don't know, I am not their ""genius"" marketing exec who came up with it.   I guess we could talk about Destiny's price, its DLC being $40 and not to mention the baffling choices behind their red bull being exploited...  The point is if I bother spending all this money on a game to begin with and I have to spend more just to get a small area among other improvements is fucking ridiculous. ""But thats how they make their money!!!"" and thats also how they drive people away. Not to mention the Imperial race is still cut off and to unlock it you need to buy crowns to get it among other things.   The MMO market has let the dlc problems of other games creep in and then people justify its okay to let them do that when its not.   ""Well WoW did it!!!"" Yeah and every expansion was unique, brought a whole new chunk of the game that was actually worth its price.   None of the modern dlc stuff is worth its price."
MMORPG,3dtjgq,Xardos1976,3,Sun Jul 19 18:29:24 2015 UTC,"WoW has a mandatory sub.  ESO does not.  Somebody has to pay the developers for their work.  I don't work for free, and I assume they don't either."

The Witcher Devs are okay with free dlc and still get paid, same with Nintendo adding things to Splatoon.   There are better ways to do these things than just forcing the costumer pay an arm and a leg for things."

MMORPG,3dtjgq,Xardos1976,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:07:58 2015 UTC,Their recent free dlc gave them a whole new area the size of Witcher 2. So how is that not working? How is that not okay?
MMORPG,3dtjgq,Skreevy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:21:47 2015 UTC,"Likely because Projekt Red made the amount it took to create Witcher 3 on day one. MMO's aren't that lucky and they generally have to keep creating new content to keep players engaged. Players really need to get out of this mentality that everything should be free. It costs money to develop a game, especially to do persistent development over time like an MMO requires. The recent DLC being free for Witcher 3 is an incredibly rare example of when they do give back, but Projekt Red was fortunate enough to have made their budget on day one. Not everyone is so fortunate."
MMORPG,3dtjgq,Xardos1976,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:26:19 2015 UTC,"Its not a mentality that everything should be free. Its a mentality that there should be a fair price. If this dlc/expansion for ESO is going to add a skyrim sized map then sure, I'll pay half of the original price of the game. But if its just a small part of a map, plus some new skins and maybe a race then how does that quantify $25?  Just like a 2 - 6 hour game. How does that justify being $60?   WoW's expansions are $50 - 60 a piece and add a plethora of content to justify the prices.   Do you really want to just be like another CSGO and just play hundreds of dollars for skins? Is that how mmo's should make their money?"
MMORPG,3dtjgq,raspberrykraken,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:47:34 2015 UTC,You're also paying $150 or more a year in sub fees (in addition to expansions) to have the privilege to play WoW.  No mandatory sub fee in ESO.  Gotta make money somehow to keep those servers running and devs payed.

MMORPG,3drwy0,tornmandate,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:16:01 2015 UTC,"Well, ""looking promising"" is a matter of who you ask. I can say that none of the games I've thought to look promising have failed on release. But that's because none have released. I never had faith in ArcheAge, BDO, or those other fancy games being hyped.  Also, I think it's very possible for sandbox MMOs to succeed. It's seems more like people have forgotten how to make them. Even here, I constantly see people taking certain features themeparks implemented for granted in MMOs in general. If that's the same thing with the the higher-ups in most MMO companies, it's a very good explanation as to why there haven't been any good sandboxes released. (Really though, Crowfall made almost a million in the first 24 hours of its kickstarter. Star Citizen (Which I'm not too big of a fan of, but it's up there on the more promising MMO list.) has made multiple tens of millions to date. People want sandboxes, no one is just delivering them properly.)"

Still, there is nothing good out there right now, and I haven't played an MMO in a solid year. There are no good sandboxes. (For me, because EVE is too much like a second job, sorry. Not a fan of the spreadsheets.) No, I wouldn't consider DayZ or any of the other small server based games MMOs. I also wouldn't say EVE is dying.

MMORPG,3ds2ck,DarkwingDara,0,Sat Jul 18 23:53:51 2015 UTC,"It IS an MMO, it just doesnt fit you ""image"" of a traditional MMORPG. It is not all instance based, theres open world areas where you can choose to do quests with other players, akin to how GW2 does its quests. Overall its a great game with unique features. I dont get why everyone and their mom salty when a new MMO does something new and awesome, personally, I love it. Not another wow copy ya know?"
MMORPG,3ds2ck,TrickstaSama,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:15:04 2015 UTC,"Technically you're right but really it doesn't feel like an MMO, you have a main hub and instances to go to, everything is instanced nothing is actual open world, and the ""open"" areas you mention are also instanced, once you finish the quests in those areas you're done and can't do anything else there.  I'm fine with that really, what I'm not fine with is that the game lacks variety, I don't remember any MMORPG that I played that forced me to do the SAME instance in my first hours, I'm about 2.5K prestige and already annoyed to see the same instances over and over, same bosses, same cut scenes and dialogs, same boss mechanics, I would expect that from endgame but at the start of the game (leveling)? Thats absurd.."
MMORPG,3ds2ck,KlanxO,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:07:03 2015 UTC,not disagreeing with you but you can complete the zones over again after you leave them & you keep unlocking more instances & regions all the way up to 60k+ prestige

There is no trading with other players, linear progression with very little progression. The item slots are kind of boring. Combat is just holding down the left click and occasionally hitting your abilities that auto target.   Oh and it takes weeks of progressing through the skill tree to unlock different classes.  Honestly it's pretty much a 3rd person destiny game. I thought that game was going to crash and burn when I tried the beta so who knows how well skyforge will do...

MMORPG,3ds2ck,imjax,2,Sun Jul 19 03:55:50 2015 UTC,Well the thing that turns me off the most is the instancing. How exactly is it done? Can anyone wander into your map randomly? Or do you launch a map from the town/something like that?
MMORPG,3ds2ck,EvoEpitaph,2,Sun Jul 19 04:43:10 2015 UTC,"That turned me off a bit too. There is a hub world where everyone hangs out and teleports to the different areas. There are different areas, i cant remember the names. One type are kind of like mini dungeons which can be played with 1-3 people. Another type are regions which are kind of open world areas from other mmorpgs with quests lots of people in these. Some regions are small some a pretty big, dont know how big they get. And there are 5 man dungeons (havnt done one of these yet). When you join the mini dungeon it gives you an option to solo or automatically join a group. You dont need to group for regions people already in these."

That said, I did the exact same zone and quests twice in a row following the gamer's linear quest system. That's horrible! Why would I ever want to do the exact same zone twice?"

MMORPG,3ds2ck,skilliard4,3,Sun Jul 19 02:48:10 2015 UTC,"It's alright.  I'm playing a Paladin and to be honest the combos are pretty weak compared to C9(a similar title), to the point where I get bored.  Not sure if this improves, but basically C9 is vastly more complex combat wise.  Level design is pretty dry.  I have yet to discover anything that surprises or excites me, it's just basically follow the quest indicator.  Nothing really to discover outside of quests.  No ""holy shit"" moments.    Something about it is kind of satisfying though I'm not sure what it is.  It's a good time killer.  Very much like Warframe or Defiance.  Quick in, quick out.  Engine could also use some optimization.  My rig is rated an 8.5 according to the option panel, but FPS can drop to 35fps when people are around.  Amazing MMORPG? No... hardly an MMO at all.  It's like a multiplayer action game."
MMORPG,3ds2ck,laleeloolee,2,Sun Jul 19 04:26:09 2015 UTC,"The action is surprisingly unresponsive, I'll attempt to pull off a combo and will have to mash my mouse or the button several times before an action initiates. I agree with most of the comments here. It feels like a button masher and the combo system is clunky. I like the theme fairly well and the overall animations look interesting enough but things are just 'off' in the game. I hate the 'no target to select' sound when I'm clicking, so unless I disable all UI sounds I have no way of turning off that one annoying part. I believe the game has potential, but it's going to take a bit of work to get there. At it's present state, it won't survive long."
MMORPG,3ds2ck,Love_and_Beer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:44:54 2015 UTC,"For some reason they put in the ability to queue up a skill while another is winding up. This leads to situations where you can end up with another basic attack queued up because are a bit quick on the button. And once in the queue nothing short of a dash of similar can dislodge it. With a well unlocked cryomancer or similar with a lot of fire and forget skills on the keyboard, the queue can be nice. But for combo heavy classes like paladin it gets in the way."

MMORPG,3ds2ck,Yidyokud,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:03:07 2015 UTC,"Skyforge - Action MMO (That's still in OBT) .This is an OBT First impression. OBT OBT  First off, it's a 10gb download. Very small. Comes bundled with the My.com launcher, WHICH if people didn't know is a P2P client, meaning you WILL be streaming data to other clients if you don't close it or limit your upload bandwidth. It also starts up on default. Uncheck uncheck.  UI - Sorta reminds me of Tera, but the fact that there's no cursor unlocking to play around with my UI kinda kills it. Not intuitive. The in-game menu system is pretty easy to navigate through, and integrated social networking support is pretty cool, even though I don't think I'll use My.com outside of Skyforge.  Graphics- Pretty good. AMD support isn't amazing, not getting too many frames even on Medium setting. The fact that you can practically pixelize your game and play it like Minecraft is cool, but not a good substitute for later optimizations I hope are coming.  Combat - Lclick/Rclick combos, as well as skill keys. This reminds me of Vindictus, in that your primary attack becomes a combo for your secondary attack, which changes dynamically based on how many primary attacks you have already chained. The downside of Skyforge's combat system is that it requires a ""Lock-on"" sort of deal, essentially breaking immersion for melee players who love to spam L-click. It doesn't seem to bug ranged players as much. The combat system will become repetitive, but you have a skill range to choose from. But, even then, progression in this game is unlimited, so it'll get boring eventually.  Progression - Very simple. Do quests, level up. Need more prestige? Do instances, get gear. Also, Temples and Adepts speed progression. Haven't delved too deep into it, but hey, it's unlimited.  Misc. - Mechanics are very simple. Disassemble gear, use it to improve boosters. Replace lower level gear to increase progression. Impossible to screw up with Skill Tree, as it only takes time to correct mistakes. F2P shares same progression as P2P, but P2P moves faster. Credit/IG currency--> can be converted into P2P currency. Questing system works like GW2, in that mobs are shared, and quests are Zone based. With the exception of the story quest, of course.  Overall - Fairly casual fun. I feel like a lot of effort was made into fine-tuning every bit of this F2P game and in-game market. It is definitely worth a try, but for me, the combat system is really a dealbreaker for me. I want the freedom to be able to play it like a true Action mmo."
MMORPG,3ds2ck,Dragpz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:24:43 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that the devs saw Destiny and wanted to recreate it. Would you call destiny a mmorpg? hardly right? This one is in the same boat, and actually the game share similarities quite a bit like the inventory system (with your character there), some of the costume designs and the whole main hub->go to instances gameplay.  The combat is quite fun, seems responsive enough and has enough cool animations and stuff to make it engaging.  The progression system is interesting, saw mentions of it being limitless tho should wait and see once people reach the higher prestiges (100K?).  Graphics and sound are awesome, really engaging and most zones feel good especially the first ""open"" area you reach.  The main problem of the game for me is the lack of variety, having to do the same instance (same everything basically) in my first hours of game is unacceptable, when they went with that approach of hub->instances they had to launch it with much more content, the only acceptable time to revisit a place is after you spent a lot of time after the first time you were there and with changed mechanics/quests/ etc, right now it's getting annoying, stall and boring fast visiting the same instances over and over again."
MMORPG,3ds2ck,KlanxO,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:20:07 2015 UTC,"Ok.  So this is the first game in a while that my ENTIRE gaming clan can actually play together.  A lot of them (myself included) have a not so great computer.  So they get definite technical points for the game scaling so wonderfully.  In terms of it being an MMO, I say its fairly close to PSO2, and definitely scratches that itch.    Now, to address a few of the complaints in the thread...  The PvP is... interesting but not well balanced.    The overall design is that you CAN cap certain types of progression for the week (e.g. run out of currency to progress on their leveling grid and not have the ability to obtain more of THAT currency) but then you can push the upper limits by leveling your order (followers because you're a god protector of the people and such)  and by running dungeons to get better gear.   I think I might be able to squeak into the next dungeon up if I get a couple good drops for example.    Not being able to group up for your friend's is somewhat of a misnomer.  I can still queue up for the level level instances without a problem and go help out some lowbies, but I can't join my friend's party directly (as its all managed by a queue system).  Which is to say, if me and my friend both queue at the same time we'll be at the same point in the queue and PROBABLY get into the same instance.    Overall, if you're only able to play a few days per week I think the leveling system and caps are fairly ideal.  Next week I think I'll be able to push through and get 3 classes unlocked and my god form, as well as pushing those classes to the point where I can unlock their class leveling currency, and its fun.    tl;dr: I like it, but it might not be everybody's cup of tea."

You get some exp from Black Spirit quests, but you can't rely on them, especially once you hit lvl 30+. So if you're trying to lvl, either do all kill quests or just go out and grind some mobs that are appropriate for your lvl.

MMORPG,3dsset,IzGameIzLyfe,2,Sun Jul 19 02:59:00 2015 UTC,What is your thoughts on ESO then? I didn't know Archeage was full blown P2W.
MMORPG,3dsset,Kaladinar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:02:42 2015 UTC,"Eso is great if u want an mmo with good story and great soloable content. U can go from lv 1-50 without talkin to another soul in the game. As inviting more players while leveling would only hinders ur progression. Its is truly a great game if ur that independent type that likes to play by urself. It is also a very expensive buy to play game with $60 as box price and an almost ""mandatory"" dlc that is coming ata end of august for another $25."
MMORPG,3dsset,IzGameIzLyfe,0,Sun Jul 19 05:59:39 2015 UTC,"You can get an ESO key for 35 or something like that. Also, the Imperial City DLC isn't really ""mandatory""."
MMORPG,3dsset,babybigger,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:38:49 2015 UTC,"with zenimax recently just voided out all those fraud keys, i wudn't keep my hopes up for the cheap keys. and also the imperial city dlc isnt required to play the game, but when the patch hits, the new dungeons, gears and pvp areas are probably all everyone else gonna be doing. so in a way they almost force u to purchase the dlc."
MMORPG,3dsset,babybigger,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:51:35 2015 UTC,ESO is better than either of these. But I think you could have a lot of fun in Archeage - if you did not care if others are stronger from P2W.

I got full patronage within 3 weeks...only lasted 2 weeks longer because trade route boredom and PvP gankers."

MMORPG,3dsset,Craigerade,-1,Sun Jul 19 16:40:55 2015 UTC,"Agreed -- I personally was limited to a Tigerspine-Solis-Falcorth trade route while picking up rope, grinding flowers into perfume, and training malfunctioning mounts because of the open areas. And waiting for them to cool down was not an option for a more causal player. And questing in those areas is down right stupid. Became fully patronage'd within 3 weeks while still under the F2P limits and could only do those trade runs for 2 more weeks before I quit from sheer boredom and PK'er avoidance."

MMORPG,3dsset,LeRoyVoss,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:37:58 2015 UTC,Archeage is a fun game. It's just that eventually you can't keep up with players willing to spend lots of money. The fact that it has a heavy cash shop and sub is a turn off.
MMORPG,3dsset,MrNotSoNiceGuy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:49:24 2015 UTC,Neverwinter might be alright to play for free to begin with. I wouldn't get too involved or support them though because they neglected everything but reducing rewards and their cash shop and the game quality sharply fell after originally being a very good game.
MMORPG,3dsset,Fliksan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:54:46 2015 UTC,"I'm playing ArcheAge with a light, casual approach right now. I thought it was a p2w mess but I'm actually having fun.  I guess the trick is not to set expectations too high and try to enjoy the game as a themepark with many sandbox elements."
MMORPG,3dsset,ManaPot,4,Sun Jul 19 09:50:51 2015 UTC,"Lol when people say "" I thought it was a p2w mess but I'm actually having fun."" I want to know there level and gear"
MMORPG,3dsset,PVDamme,2,Sun Jul 19 10:46:04 2015 UTC,"Ya pretty much. ArcheAge is great fun until you start doing a lot of endgame things, and you run into your first whale in PvP. Then you realize how stupid it all is, and quit."
MMORPG,3dsset,Neureddcz,-2,Sun Jul 19 21:19:03 2015 UTC,"ArcheAge, no. Not unless you have a credit card with unlimited limit on it. Was a solid game, except for Trion got their hands on it. /r/ArcheAge"
MMORPG,3dsset,PVDamme,3,Sun Jul 19 03:24:25 2015 UTC,"Was a solid game, except for Trion got their hands on it.   Trion made the game a lot less p2w than the Korean version..."
MMORPG,3dsset,Neureddcz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:11:15 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm actually curious about this. How exactly they made NA / EU AA less P2W?"
MMORPG,3dsset,Fliksan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:52:17 2015 UTC,For me personally the worst thing are the costumes that offer stats but decay. You have to rebuy them.  They also sell better gliders than those that you can get by playing in the cash shop.  In general the game has a lot more grinding for players that don't pay in the Russian and Korean version.
MMORPG,3dsset,Neureddcz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:22:11 2015 UTC,"Well, trion did same for mounts as gliders and imho it was terrible, because because it made pvp mount useless. I guess it is similar for kraken drop glider.  Costume change was only good thing trion did, simply because NA / EU community is extremly against costume stats in general.   Problem is that NA / EU economy was destroyed by botters & exploiters so just that pushed legit players into big disadvantage.  Inflation was extremly high if you compare it with korean server and how long they were active.  Also price of APEX skyrocketed because peeps stopped their support for trion and was falling down only while dupe exploit.   So in general I would not be so sure if korean server do have more grinding thanks to economy.   I actually believe trion made AA even worse and less enjoyable for just sub / f2p players then ''all hated'' XL games thanks to all faux pas."
MMORPG,3dsset,Fliksan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:10:25 2015 UTC,I know labor pots have no cooldown on the korean servers.
MMORPG,3dsset,ManaPot,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:17:09 2015 UTC,These 500 labor no CD potions were on NA / EU too.

MMORPG,3dsset,MrNotSoNiceGuy,3,Sun Jul 19 20:49:38 2015 UTC,"Lol XLGames are the ones who ruined the game the most, not Trion, stop barking at the wrong tree. The game was pay2win in Korea and Russia and Trion had nothing to do with those."

MMORPG,3dryo9,Grzeshtoff,3,Sat Jul 18 21:53:33 2015 UTC,Neverwinter  I could get any toon up to level cap in 2 days.
MMORPG,3dryo9,PapaDuke,2,Sat Jul 18 22:07:03 2015 UTC,You mean right now or before the last xpac? Because the leveling now is more than enough to scare new and old players away from that game.
MMORPG,3dryo9,PapaDuke,3,Sat Jul 18 22:08:35 2015 UTC,Trick from lev 60 to lev 70 now is to hammer Spinward Rise as soon as it unlocks. I could still level any toon within 3-4 days.  But End Game is a mess. Either P2W PvP or near impossible PvE T1 and T2 dungeons. Here is a uber twinked GWF with Legendary and Mithical Everything running with an elite group still getting pawned by the Boss of a T2 dungeon.
MMORPG,3dryo9,KillZacular,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:23:00 2015 UTC,That's what i mean by destroying the game. You need to empty your wallet to have any chance even at PvE now. I really hope they fix some stuff with the next xpac but i doubt it'll happen.
MMORPG,3dryo9,Kunaixx,3,Sat Jul 18 22:27:27 2015 UTC,"TBH, I'd say the leveling in Tera now feels really fast. Though I played in the early alpha when it was extremely grindy. I level faster in Tera than I do in most other MMOs though."

Project Gorgon: Right now, it's not very polished, and while I've played it a little while, playing it any more may ruin my experience of the game until it gets more polished. But it's one of the games that's trying to be more or less exactly what I'm looking for. Pantheon: According to MMORPG.com, the game is scheduled to come out in 2017.

A game that doesn't think of itself as a game, but as a world to immerse in. Something that is fun to play mechanically but also gives tons of tools to simply enjoy yourself with, tools for roleplayers and social players.  Personally, thats why I play MMO's, although by ""play MMO's"" i mean ""chasing the non-existant dragon"" nowadays. Every modern MMO feels like some kind of Skinner box with rewards I don't even enjoy. I wish we could go back to how old MMO's work, but the demographic just isn't into that anymore. MMO's have become a quick-fix addiction.   EDIT: I know EVE will scratch this itch (and i've tried it before) but it's so damn hard to get into and I loathe the time-gating that stops new players from being able to do stuff whilst having to pay a sub fee."

MMORPG,3dpo69,norada,2,Sat Jul 18 06:25:59 2015 UTC,"I see. So what do you think drew people to these Taverns?  Based on your comment it seems there was use in stats because of the buffing. I'm assuming there was no LFG system, so perhaps it was a psuedo group finder?"
MMORPG,3dpo69,norada,3,Sat Jul 18 06:28:58 2015 UTC,"I played the game so long ago I honestly forget a lot of it. I just remember the bars were populated and you could even have a player ran bar. I think you could customize your own bar and purchase a stage/performance areas for people to do their dances/songs in. I think if you got a dance/song you would get like a 30minute buff of some sort, you normally would tip the performer also.  Think how food works in some games where it gives you a small buff over time, I think the performances worked like that and you had to find an actual person to perform to give you the buff. I think there was mana regen/hp regen also."
MMORPG,3dpo69,Jaeryth,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:04:57 2015 UTC,I see. Interesting. Thank you.   A sort of buff could heavily help get players to go in there. It's more of a matter on how to get the buffs to rely on other players. Especially since bards and music type classes are so few in number.
MMORPG,3dpo69,SadDragon00,4,Sat Jul 18 07:19:58 2015 UTC,"Hey, I mained a musician in SWG. After the NGE you were able to choose the buff you gave them and people often made a request of which buff they wanted.  Before that we buffed Focus and Willpower only, with Dancers buffing Mind. IIRC you could buff outside of cantinas but it didn't last a long time at all.  The longer people listened to you the longer the buff lasted, though it did cap out after a certain point. But this did keep people inside cantinas.  A lot of people rolled Dancer/Musician for the social aspect, and it also made pretty decent amounts in tips - I remember getting tipped millions of credits by PvPers at a time. If you didn't tip or gave a crappy one it kind of became known and people would refuse to buff you, so it didn't happen often.  Honestly, I think that was the best social experience I've had with an MMO and I still miss it. Emu just doesn't have the same feel."
MMORPG,3dpo69,Jaeryth,3,Sat Jul 18 07:59:10 2015 UTC,Man this sounds awesome. I wish games nowadays tried harder to promote the social aspect through immersion like this.
MMORPG,3dpo69,Xtulu,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:54:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah it was really something else. We also had uninstanced playerhousing early on in the game's lifespan and there was a built-in player cities feature. A mayor could set taxes and place down community structures for the city such as shuttles to other cities, decorations, medical bays, etc.  The housing worked a lot in part due to the planet maps being massive and having plenty of open land, as well as there being an upkeep cost. Traders could specialize in making furniture and there was a lot of it.  Way later on you were able to decorate certain bigger spaceships like a house, and while piloting the ship you could get up and walk around, and you could even have friends in them to help gun/repair the ship. Or even pilot it for you."
MMORPG,3dpo69,Talkplox,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:46:05 2015 UTC,Buffing through dance and music was twice as powerful in taverns I believe.  Same thing in hospitals.  Doctors could give buffs and remove status effects a lot more quickly in those places.   People would line up to receive their buff.  They would group up and go down the group list.  It was well organized.  Something I think would escape the attention of a lot of novice mmo players today.
MMORPG,3dpo69,TheAlphaGareBear,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:49:46 2015 UTC,That sounds awesome. How long did it take for someone to receive a buff? Was it a simple cast or did the person have to play an entire song to the target.
MMORPG,3dpo69,Godsopp,2,Sat Jul 18 17:09:46 2015 UTC,"For dancer/musician buffs, you had to be grouped up with the person and ""/watch"" or ""/listen"" them. You had to watch each performer for a couple of minutes or so to receive full buffs.  For doctors, their buffs are just casts with ~8 second on average cool down between each buff given, there were six of those total. So with the proper consumables, a master doctor could buff someone in less than a minute. Without that stuff, it takes about two minutes. So basically systems are in there to help the community come together. It was so great."
MMORPG,3dpo69,DocHolliday13,3,Sat Jul 18 17:53:36 2015 UTC,"Well, I think it starts with what kind of game you're playing.  I'm a fan of player built cities and a lack of any sort of /whisper or global chats. In a game like that, a tavern would be a great place to meet someone at a pre-set time, or to try and find someone as the tavern owner is probably up-to-date with the goings-ons of the town.  There could be risks to sleeping (logging out) outside of your house, so it would make taverns a good place to settle down for a night while you're travelling.  If it's a game with a robust cooking system that actually matters, taverns could employ chefs to cook food with high-level buffs or food that doesn't go bad for a long time.  /u/norada mentioned SWG and it's Entertainer class. Something like that would be very nice to do in a tavern.  It could be where jobs are posted by players, if there isn't an in-built quest tracker/questing system.  There are lots of ways to handle a tavern to actually make it somewhere worth going. If I'm being honest, I'm really not a fan of your suggestions, as they're just cheap ways of making a tavern somewhere to do stuff that you could put anywhere. It being a tavern should be important to what it does and why you would go there. The problem is that a lot of these sorts of things are handled by other parts of the game. Global chat makes finding people easy, logging out just despawns your character (can't have any risk of losing stuff, that wouldn't be fun, right?), I don't think I've ever seen a robust cooking system, SWG is dead (RIP), and jobs are handled by NPCs and you generally have trackers and a minimap so you know exactly where you're going."
MMORPG,3dpo69,llye,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:51:14 2015 UTC,"a lack of any sort of /whisper or global chats.   I always thought this would be kind of cool. You could even expand upon this and make some cool features to go with it. Like having some messenger birds that you could send around to people and they take a certain amount of time depending on where the other person is. That would make sending messages super immersive, especially in open world pvp."
MMORPG,3dpo69,tornmandate,4,Sun Jul 19 18:21:41 2015 UTC,"Isn't it obvious? The more a game is about end-game loot pinatas, the less it will be about anything else. Even if you COULD make a tavern useful in such a modern MMO, it would be pointless, because it would still be nothing more than just one more way to get more gear.  If you want a real tavern experience in an MMO, first you have to have an MMO that's an actual virtual world experience where gear is just a tool to help explore the game world, and the real rewards are the experiences themselves. In other words, everything that every new MMO released in the last 5 years is not."

Like I said before, that's pointless. If you gotta have some shiny bauble reward to get people to go there, then it's not going to be what the OP is asking for.  People are so focused on loot rewards these days, they've completely lost what MMOs (and video games in general) are really about. Why does every stinking thing have to be about getting some new gewgaw with more stats than the last shiny?  Really though, this explains why all recent MMOs are total shite. MMOs used to be about exploring the world and experiencing the content, and gear was just a tool that helped you explore and see more.   Why can't we just have an MMO where playing the game is the reward?  I'll tell you why. Because that would mean the content actually has to be good, fun, and interesting, and you couldn't force players to just keep grinding the same shit over and over for 6 months. It would mean the devs would have to stop being lazy and taking shortcuts, and actually release something worth playing on its own merits."

MMORPG,3dpo69,tornmandate,5,Sun Jul 19 23:14:57 2015 UTC,"A few things that would make me hang out in taverns:     Automatically turn off all zone chats, trade chats, etc (other than guild) and have only a 10ft radius local chat in effect.   Pub games on the tables of the booths with players being able to bet on the outcomes.   Gain rested XP at an increased rate while online and hanging out in the tavern.   Most importantly, FREQUENT random npc driven tavern events.  The developer should have a list of 100+ random things that can unfold, with some events more common than others.  Every npc in the bar has a chance of getting in a fight with one of the other npcs, and the players get to choose a side and join in (making a large impromptu battleground pub brawl).  Each npc would have a different loot pool.  Other types of events could be wandering rares merchants that arrive from time to time, or things like a swarm of rats or roaches pouring out of the cellar.  Perhaps a fire breaks out, and the players need to help put it out.  The key here is that at least one event happens every 10/15 minutes so that your wait isn't long enough to encourage you to leave.  You could also have the pub events follow the token system, where the pub owner pays you in tokens for your participation and you can cash them in for tiered loot.   Look up the Grim Guzzler from Blackrock Depths in WoW.  If they would have made normal taverns have similar random events, it would be amazing."
MMORPG,3dpo69,seanidor,2,Sat Jul 18 13:08:29 2015 UTC,"To add to this ; I think a small but rather intricate concept would be forcing weapons to be ""left at the door"" of Taverns.  Just kinda makes it feel even more alive..."
MMORPG,3dpo69,tornmandate,2,Sat Jul 18 16:47:55 2015 UTC,"It's definitely the little details that matter.

MMORPG,3dpo69,tornmandate,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:29:02 2015 UTC,"Ten feet is a tad harsh. That's not much over your own length, and you'd literally need to hug someone for that to work. Other than that, any kinds of global chat (which includes trade and lfg chats, among other things) shouldn't exist in a game. It should be area based, with the area not being too big. Basically, they should be within clear vision range, so one could turn to another, if they hear them talk. Mini-games, totally. It's not difficult to think up a small new game, or take an existing one, and apply a little twist based on the theme of your game. Betting on the outcomes is also fine, but this could lead to some hostility and rigged matches. (Which is fine, if your game can handle that.) In fact, even it's just playing for money (in-game money), making it possible for the stakes to go too high can ruin the game a bit. Like this one game had poker as a mini-game, you could literally gain or lose hundreds or thousands of hours of hard earned money in one night's sitting. Good players make easy money, bad players get addicted and lose it all. It's like being scammed. Rested exp is just a bad concept, designed for getting money from your players. That's probably never a good idea to add anywhere. Well, such events would need to be hard-coded into the game, and that takes very long to do. Even if you made 100, or even a thousand, which would take far too long, it wouldn't be long until they're all exhausted. Say you stay at the tavern for an hour every day, during which 5 of these events happen. In the case of a hundred events, it'd take a few days before you see the first repeat, and about 2 weeks, before these start happening every day. By the end of the month, most of the events you've already seen a time or two. In the case of a thousand, you'd see the first repeat after a couple of weeks, a repeat every other day after a couple of months, and by the time the year is up, the events will have gotten stale, despite the amount being so large that no one would make these."
MMORPG,3dpo69,notblack7,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:16:19 2015 UTC,"By all means, stick with the current empty buildings then because the 100+ events might be seen within a few weeks of nightly play.  That's a wonderful reason to avoid adding content to the game.    ,, 10 feet is to keep conversations confined to specific tables or small areas.  Ever been to a packed bar/club? Imagine if every voice no matter where they are in the bar could be heard just as well as the guy across the table from you. It would make conversation impossible, with everyone trying to talk over each other but unable to.  The same would apply to a chat box environment.  Text would move far too fast to read, and you would be forced to join a group chat , removing any role-playing potential.  Better to have people stand in tight clusters, or sit at tables, much like in real life."
MMORPG,3dpo69,notblack7,2,Sun Jul 19 11:45:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is a wonderful reason not to add that content to the game. MMOs take a very long time to make, and chances are they're never truly finished. There's always more that could be added. Unless you're making a Tavern Simulator, there are things way, way more important to focus on. Taverns can be fun without them, because they most certainly will not be fun with them.  I've been in games like that. And it works, even if you can hear everyone. A simple solution is chat bubbles. Zoom in to your table, and see what they're talking. Does it break the immersion that you can ""hear"" someone from the other side of the room? Yeah, sure, but this isn't real life, and comparing the game to it doesn't make for a good argument. 10 feet, or the radius of a table, or something that small just wouldn't work for a regular game. But if you like real-life comparisons, then I'd say I should be able to know what they're talking on the other side of the tavern, since I can read lips."
MMORPG,3dpo69,Frog-Eater,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:11:46 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this is the same, but taverns remind me of the places in major cities near ""necessary vendors"" where people just group and chill out. In TERA, for example, there is Velika central square where a ton of people are randomly standing around, messing with other people, showing off costumes, grouping with guilds, emoting, or just going AFK. It is positioned in front of a bank and trade broker, but people also need to pass by the area by to get to a major quest hub. If you want to get people into taverns, the game could possibly position the tavern at a ""crossroads"" where many people are passing by, and include a popular vendor like: a banker, merchant or trade broker in the tavern."
MMORPG,3dpo69,seanidor,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:49:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah I notice that too. Been playing ESO and Gw2 a lot lately. In ESO people seem to hang out a lot around crafting tables/guild store area. In Guild Wars 2 it is around the auction house (TP), mystic forge/bank, and crafting tables area.  So position a Tavern that's right by it could be a huge part of it. Put certain vendors in it.  But will that cause a opposite effect? Having a ton of people standing ontop of one another talking to the auction house guy. Is that something we really want?"
MMORPG,3dpo69,distineo,2,Sat Jul 18 17:08:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, while many people just do their business and leave, a good amount will still leak out into the surrounding area and just chill there.

MMORPG,3dpo69,MentalNeko,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:22:57 2015 UTC,"I think you need to get rid of any ""reward"" idea. If you want people to hang out in a tavern to talk, it should be because they want to, to have a good time. If it's only to get some loot, some exp bonus, or whatever else, they'll just ignore/troll each other.  You'd need a game that's hard, because easy games attract kids and idiots (that's just my opinion of course, hopefully I'm wrong). There are also kids and idiots on hard games, but less so.  I think you need to get rid of vertical progression too. As long as there's something ""big"" to win by being out there (exp/gold/gear), people won't spend a lot of time just talking to each other.  Maybe a skill progression like in Eve, where you pick some skills to level up, and they level up over time no matter what you do. You could be fighting demons, crafting, hanging in a tavern or swimming at the bottom of a lake, doesn't matter, your ""swordman"" skill will lvl up after 90 minutes. That way people would really do something they enjoy, no pressure.  Basically what you want is an IRC chatroom in a game. Fifteen years ago that would happen a lot, people would just gather together somewhere in the game and talk for hours.

If you want people to hang out in a tavern to talk, it should be because they want to, to have a good time. If it's only to get some loot, some exp bonus, or whatever else, they'll just ignore/troll each other.   I agree that it shouldn't really be about the reward, but there should be a reason go to there. I think it would be better if it's out of necessity. Just like in the ye olden days, people went to taverns to eat and find a place to rest/sleep/relax. People would congregate in that area and interact because, well, there's people there. If that was one of the more reliable places to find information you are looking for, or to find someone to team up with, then it would be even better."
MMORPG,3dpo69,NetSage,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:37:12 2015 UTC,"Taverns are a hub for RP in many MMOs. In LOTRO, Guild Wars 2, SW:TOR and Rift, I've seen people RPing in taverns. The thing about many MMOs now is that it's a rush to the endgame or to new content, many people don't want to pay monthly to hang around in a virtual pub.  There could be many systems in place to make taverns useful. A bounty board (think FF12's bounty hunter thing), message boards, minigames like card games or gambling, dancing, music events, amateur dramatics, competitions. There's a lot that could be done."
MMORPG,3dpo69,MentalNeko,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:14:59 2015 UTC,"Do you think such additions would actually hold players? That's my main concern with those type of systems.  If there's a bounty board they would just come up, use it, then leave.   Mini games and the such may be underused if no one wants to do them. Guild Wars 2, for instance, has a lot of mini games. Yet a low amount of population plays them. The main reason for playing them is usually a daily achievement. I can't remember the last time I saw someone playing the drinking game."
MMORPG,3dpo69,kainsshadow,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:21:47 2015 UTC,"FFXIV has a bounty board outside the new tavern in Ishgard, and inside you buy stuff with the points you get from bounties.

MMORPG,3dpo69,Creslock,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:51:41 2015 UTC,Anyone could make a map in the Foundry that anyone else could play in-game and it would count as a way to grind or level or just play. You could earn AD (the main currency) from just playing a couple of Foundry maps a day (they had to be approved and at least 15 minutes long though -- a good soft cheat filter).  Some bugs and exploits later without any attempt to fix or update (other than nerf them) has effectively neutered it.

Buying it after release actually gave you more from the bonus zen, allowed you to use coupons and it did become on sale for real at a later date, you would have thought they'd give something to the ones who supported early for a promised discount but they'd rather milk what they can.  More recently they've offered account wide companions in part of an offer without actually delivering.  http://www.arcgames.com/en/games/neverwinter/news/detail/9132813-neverwinter%3A-bonus-companion-rewards!  There is of course also the past where they advertised epic companions as the rewards instead of uncommon, given their history you'd think they'd at least proof read what they put out. They're either ridiculously incompetent or deceptive on purpose and trying to save face. I'd probably go with the former."

Coil in FFXIV is on a different level completely imo.  We will just have to heavily disagree on the subject.   Edit: now don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with the game being straight forward and easier compared to other games, that's what their audience wants and enjoys and it's still working for them, it's just not for me."

Runescape still seems like it has its charm that it had over the past years, but it has begun to fall down the Micro-Transactions path, and PvP is pretty much dead in RS3 (where as in OSRS, it's pretty popular, by PvE is meh).

MMORPG,3dpd78,lyridsreign,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:05:44 2015 UTC,"You might be interested in Skyforge. It's kind of like Warframe in the sense you have small missions to go out on for resources to upgrade. There is also what they call regions where you do open world quests but they're not incredibly huge like some MMOs. Since the game just went into open beta, it's going through some pvp growing pains but it's really easy to get matched up with people around your prestige (the leveling/ranking system). Since the only gear you can equip are weapons, amulets and trinkets there isn't a whole lot of gear changing like how WoW is. It's worth a shot. The cash shop is pretty pro consumer as the only real 'power buying' is premium status which works in the same vein of World of Tanks (more resources per mission completed)."
MMORPG,3dpd78,KillZacular,-1,Sat Jul 18 05:38:35 2015 UTC,"Most MMOs separate PvP and PvE so that players cannot easily do both in one set of gear. You are meant to grind gear out for each different play-style. With that said, many of the MMOs will allow you to join PvP matches in PvE gear. WoW in particular though has one of the bigger gaps between the two gear sets which means using PvE gear will put you at a fairly large disadvantage.  I personally cannot at all recommend WoW as a good game as it in my opinion gets worse every year, but it seems to match your style the best and hitting end game is very easy now. I'm personally a more hardcore gamer who likes a tough challenge and WoW just went the opposite direction from my style. FFXIV is the game I moved to and I absolutely love it, but progressing without a great group is near impossible, and the game is far more grindy than WoW when it comes to end game gearing. It has a great story though and much better social aspects."

MMORPG,3dmyr3,ferrin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:40:35 2015 UTC,"All points were reset as the new expac dropped. They gave everyone a free respec.  Finishing the last boss of the final act will indeed start you back at the beginning, but in a harder difficulty with new level ranges. You go from A1->A4 in normal, then repeat in cruel, and repeat finally in merciless. Towards the end of cruel, you'll really start to get a feel for if your build will shine or not. You will also want to start getting your resistances as high as possible (75%) in cruel to help with survivability.  At level 35, you're still a babby witch. Right now, for leveling, a very strong leveling build/skill combination is going a mix of Firestorm and Flame totem, even with hardly any support links. Throwing Added lightning on Flame totem will take you plenty far. I've been using Firestorm + Concentrated effect + Spell echo as well and it has been very effective. Grab a Flammability curse gem and you're set. You can buy most of these gems from the vendors in towns now. Also pick up Herald of Thunder and Ice, run those, and you're golden. If need be, you can use a lower level Clarity for some mana regen, or you can rely on a mana pot.  The attack you are likely talking about is Freeze pulse. It's sort of a ""wave"" of ice that very quickly passes over enemies. The skill is still pretty good, but it's mechanics have changed with the new expansion that will change the way people make Freeze pulse builds. Freeze pulse was very good at ""shotgunning"" but this has been removed in 2.0 What this means is people would add multiple projectiles to Freeze pulse, so that it would shoot 3 (or more) waves, and they would overlap on top of each other. All 3 waves would hit a mob and do tons of damage - this was considered ""shotgunning."" This mechanic is now gone. Only 1 of the waves would now hit even if all 3 passed over an enemy. There is a lot of extra details regarding projectiles and shotgunning mechanics, like the point of origin of the spell, duration, and projectiles ""resetting"" in the case of Spark, but I won't get into that as this post would get insanely long.

I want a game that's more about experiencing the world, that has a PvE focus, where there are a lot of obscure mechanics about the world, where theory crafting isn't all that easy, where just being in the game is an experience in and of itself, where endgame isn't the sole focus - there should be relevant and interesting content throughout the game and it should be expanded upon rather than constant vertical progression. Early FFXI is probably the best example of this type of game. But there has to be design inherent to the things that I mention, for them to work."

It has the same problems as Firefall and Skyforge in terms of getting fatigued with the game quickly, and it focuses way too much on questing. I prefer experiencing the world through gameplay and my independent decisions.  ESO comes much closer to what I'm explaining, than TSW does.  Also, Don't suggest something to people who haven't asked for suggestions.

The only reason I can tell why I'm playing WoW it's because I'm an MMORPG player since I was 11, and I saw glorious days for this genre and saw it die too. I'm tired of F2P shitgames that always turn to be P2W, or are full of hackers, or bots, or unpolite kids.  The monthly fee barrier is a good thing, and the game is not that bad.  As for Heroes of the Storm, well I've lost all my interest for any MOBA game until I got into HotS.  Heroes adds a magnificent twist to the MOBA genre being an objective based game. The main event of each map is actually important to achieve victory and pulls you out of the boredom of running up and down on lanes killing creeps and destroying towers.  Congrats to Blizzard for breathing new life on a genre that imho got quickly boring and overcrowded. And congrats too on keeping an MMORPG alive after these years, avoiding the F2P cancer trend."

I like that they're trying for an open world sandbox game, but the game world is lifeless and boring, the combat is overly simple, and the gathering grind is extremely tedious.  This will be a great game for the mobile market, but for PC users I can see this game being fun for two weeks, maybe a month.   I would HIGHLY recommend Albion Online to someone with a nice tablet, otherwise I would only recommend it to people who are desperate to play a full-loot sandbox game.

There's not very much in the way of guided learning in WoW so you kinda have to figure out what you're doing on your own / with the help of guides or /r/worldofwarships but I'm having a blast learning so far.

Of course it's the usual grindy MMORPG with all those quests you see in a number of different MMORPGs.... but the social aspect of this MMORPG is really amazing. And with the merge coming this coming week, it's only going to get better. I've made some pretty good friends here already.  What would you change? The server stability issues that they're having. They put some nonsense level limits on maps crap patch that nobody likes which is causing these server stability issues. I'd also change the cash shop and make it less P2W.  How much do you play? Do you have a schedule? I play way to much. I play whenever the schedule let's me. It's summer time for me so, I have almost everyday of the week to play all day. Then after summer, I'll get back to my school job and I'll have Monday-Fridays 3:30pm to about 10pm and off weekends.  Would you recommend it? Why or why not?  Despite it's P2W cash shop and server stability issues going on right now, I'd still recommend it. It's still truly a remarkable game to play. Right when you start the game (And after merge) there are going to be TONS of Academies for you to join and you'll be making so much friends who'll be more than happy to help you with questing and things. It's the best game out there to make friends, good friends, and have a great time with others."

MMORPG,3dmyr3,Biohack,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:57:46 2015 UTC,"I'm currently splitting my time between SWTOR and TERA.  SWTOR keeps me hooked due to the storylines and of course, lightsabers.  TERA has a good combat system, but the story is essentially meaningless.  I'm subbed on SWTOR as they have a 12x XP event for story quests going on; I'm F2P on TERA as I can't see a reason to pay anything (which is a point in its favor in the F2P vs F2P game discussions, I think).  What do you like about what you're playing?   SWTOR - The story is great, and there are 8 different class stories, so there's a ton to go through.  The ""stand there and use skills"" style of play makes it a good game for when you don't want to have to 100% focus on the game. TERA - The combat system is what I like about this game.  Once you find the right class for you, even when you have to grind, it can still be fun.  Since there's no story going on, I can have Netflix running on my laptop next to me while I play.   What would you change?'   SWTOR - Bug fixes.  There are cutscene bugs that are still in here since launch.  That and gear clipping is really bad.  I'm more in it for the story, so I'm really looking forward to the new expansion in Oct. TERA - This game feels like it's a model in ""unrealistic body image""; the women are all half naked, and the men are all mountains of muscle.  Most people play female characters to the point that the new class that came out is locked to the two sexiest female options.   How much do you play?  Do you have a schedule?   I switch back and forth between the two games depending on how I'm feeling.  TERA is my go-to when I want to do some grinding and watch some TV.  SWTOR is where I go to when I want some story.  I usually play a couple nights a week, but I'm not on any schedule.   Would you recommend it? Why or why not?   SWTOR - If you're looking for a game with a good story, and you're willing to shell out the $15/mo, I would recommend it.  The game pretends it's F2P, but that mode is so restrictive that if you continue to play, you'll almost certainly want to subscribe.  Use the F2P as a test of whether or not you want to continue playing and paying. TERA - I'm doing F2P and I don't see much point in paying for anything.  Maybe it becomes more of an issue toward endgame, but I'm nowhere near there.  I am a Preferred account, since I bought the game back in the day, so that may be part of the reason.  If you're looking for a game with a combat system where skill and practice are well-rewarded, then this is a good one."

MMORPG,3dmyr3,TharpDaddy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:14:17 2015 UTC,"I was playing Aion, but with Skyforge early access being released last week, that's been occupying most of my game time.  I really like the combat system. I find it's a very nice mix between fast paced actin combat and tab targeting. I hate first person shooters and I find action combat games that force you to point your camera at your target incredibly limiting. Running the group dungeons especially at the ""impossible"" difficulty is very challenging and requires hyper focus on many different things. I really like it.  I also really enjoy the huge diversity in how you can build your characters and also love that I don't have to make any alts and can do everything on one character.  There are some minor things I would change in the game (ffa pvp mode not being based off last hit for example). Doing this would be really difficult and really hard to balance without making the game pay to win so it probably won't happen but I would love a similar game that actually had a player run economy. As it stands now the number of items in the game is pretty small and there is no player to player trading. Also the voice acting can be really bad in some spots and the mouth animations don't match the words being spoken at all.  Whether or not I would recommend it depends on what you're looking for. The game is a lot of fun and I am really enjoying it. The game doesn't really classify easily but it feels like a sort of hybrid between path of exile and world of warcraft. If you're looking for a fast paced actionrpg game skyforge might be a good option."
MMORPG,3dmyr3,nihilist-ego,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:47:24 2015 UTC,"Skyforge. I like sci-fi setting, superb animations, character development scheme, graphics, combat. But character development is too slow -  in F2P mode it takes 2 months to get to end-game (I guess the devs just want to delay the process to finish said end-game).

I like that there is the occasional hard mob hiding in the maps which force you to party up in order to take it down. Most of all however, I like that the game is simple.  The game is currently in closed beta, so things will be added and changed. I haven't played through the whole game (about halfway there) and I've only tried one class so far, but I don't have any major complaints. The only thing that bugs me is that I'd like to be able to zoom out just a bit more.   I've never been the kind of person who spends 10+ hours each day gaming. I've been playing about every other day for a week(more or less) so far for a couple of hours, but I'm going to rush to level cap before CBT ends (for any potential rewards, then I'm going to start a new class before OBT). No real schedule, I just log in when I feel like it to relax.   I would recommend this game. If you're looking for something simple, something to not take super seriously, and if you're not blinded by the ""omg when will something different happen in MMOs already"" attitude, then give this game a shot.

Combat and mechanics of the game are very smooth, aspect that other older games suck at and btw graphics are not everything, ofc they are outdated, the game was originally released in 2008. What attracts me about it is fast paced combat, especially at later levels, when you have most of the skills, good pvp/pk system, the world in the game is quite small which in effect  makes it not as time consuming as if it had huge world plus makes it easier to meet people and there are other small touches that create pleasent atmosphere.

MMORPG,3dlvyj,SanDiegoDude,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:39:20 2015 UTC,Well. The thing is that PoE is based off of Diablo. A huge part of the game is knowing how to properly manage inventory. It would be too easy if they let you buy personal inventory. That's why you can get stash tabs.

MMORPG,3dlktk,LeylinTG,3,Fri Jul 17 16:09:23 2015 UTC,"The classes are very different and some are quite complex. Take the Cryomancer class for example, very basic class, one of the starter 3. As you progress the class retains its simplicity without feeling too dumbed down but but also becomes more complex without feeling like too much to handle. Then lets go to the Necromancer. Its a bit complicated. Necro compared to Cryo is very complex, it has three forms and more to its abilities. I havent played a whole lot of Necromancer because I went straight for the Kinetic (The magneto mage). However, as I said, Necro has Human form where all the basic abilities are available, Lich form which has only a primary lifesteal attack, an AoE scythe attack that gives massive heal depending on how many enemies you kill and an ability that reverts you back to human form. Then there's summoning form which allows you to summon 1 of 3 minion types until you are reverted to normal again. Its a lot and what I said is probably a mess but thats the best I can sum it up as, I really recommend looking into the game as its been great fun for me so far!"

Fair bit of action combat (though it sticks more to the MMO side I think then something like say Warframe), really good graphics, and a slick presentation.  It's less MMO-like than someone might expect though, it's very highly instanced.    You have a hub and teleport between various unconnected small-to-medium instance maps across the world, sometimes with just a group or solo and sometimes with a bunch of players.  There's a bunch of classes, but it apparently takes a while to unlock something else unless you pay.  You can only pick 3 from the get go (Tank/Healer/Ranged DPS).  Seems like it'd get old after a while so probably better to play in small doses and/or with friends."

And it has a shitty group-finder out of the gate. This shit fucked up WoW when they released it in Wrath, and has fucked up every other MMO that has had it as well. No thanks.

I've heard all this same shit before when Mythic Entertainment got absorbed by EA, that article was posted in 2006. A few years later EA forced Mythic to shit out the train wreck that was Warhammer Online long before it was ready and then shut down the studio not long after.   The deal with EA was one that was carefully considered, and one that I am very proud of being able to present to our company. I’ve been around a long time and seen a lot of things in this industry, and I am confident that this deal was the right thing for Mythic...

MMORPG,3dkngx,phancdp,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:02:36 2015 UTC,"well they won't look like horde, they will have a funny mask on.   And the BGs are a sign of the problem, this is a fix to something that is already a problem. Battlegrounds, at least in a MMO immersion game are outdoors. If you remember Vanilla wow, AB was an outdoor fighting area where any number could join.   Battlegrounds took away the idea that you are fighting another world power, and turned it into a gladiator sport rather than a war. Wining any BG doesn't yield anything outside the BG except for gear.  So as you pointed out, BGs are nothing other than gear farming, again a source of problems. The idea that you play eSports and get gear kills the idea of immersion.   Imagine for a moment, a BG area that is not instanced, is in the world, where you fight others on the SAME server, where taking control means something.  They got close when they did the world battle areas back in the Lich King expansion (not sure if they continued it as I left around that time). But the best battle ground pvp that combines immersion is like the zone control battlegrounds. You go to towers, maybe it takes 3 people to take a tower due to guards, and once you take the towers, you gain some advantage. That is the best way to encourage fighting.  Now put those across multiple zones, remove battlegrounds to force pvp into the world, and you have an immersion pvp experience.   Technically my favoriate pvp area before I quit was the island that had both Horde and Alliance in it, I could go out with a few friends and ""gank"", but as soon as you started ganking, 5 others would start to hunt you down, so you call your guild in, before you know it, you have a 20 on 20 pvp going on for a few hours. Yes it interrupts your ""questing"" but it was no doubt fun."

MMORPG,3dnj2i,ThePlaywright,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:20:21 2015 UTC,"I had fun for a while with Guild Wars 2.  Had some key issues that kept me from truly enjoying it though.  Things like Condition builds being useless and heavy armor classes being universally better than other armor types.  Also, the build customization was lacking with lots of traits being useless or broken.  Was difficult to really play what you want to play, as only one or two lines were fully functional / useful for each class.  The way WvW worked was pretty terrible too, as factions just kept flipping key locations in order to trade karma.  All of this appears as though it is being fixed in the upcoming expansion.  So for me, at least, it will be worth playing again.  However with the TESO update coming too... well, it's going to be hard to pick just one.  TESO is the stronger game right now though, in PvP (and PvE in my opinion.)  Heart of Thorns will help even things out... maybe push GW2 ahead (though I'm not sure its limited WvW experience will ever match Cyrodiil's for PvP.)"

MMORPG,3do9tz,GorillaPanic,3,Fri Jul 17 22:05:41 2015 UTC,"What did you enjoy from MMOs that you liked in the past? Good place to start since both games are very different especially from one another. Here's my breakdown just in case:  ESO: Looks great (A LOT better when using shaders like SweetFX+ReShade though) and battle mechanics are fun which is why I think the PvP in ESO is the best part of it. That said though, PvE can be pretty solo, least in my experience. You'll see plenty of people running around when you are on and when you need help killing a rare mob/mini boss you usually can find people to help. Issue I have with it is even with people running around the game isn't too great on supporting group play. Only have it in dungeons and somewhat PvP. Doing quests in PvE with friends is pretty annoying since the quests tend to have mini instances where say a town is on fire and youhave to put it out. While doing this, you won't be able to interact with others much if at all. If you enjoy solo play and a great lore, ESO would be my suggestion. Also, endgame is pretty grindy from what I'm seeing so keep it in mind as well.  I haven't played GW2 in a long time because I hit cap lvl and found the armor and progression system to be very dull. Game is more about looks/cosmetics than actual gear with meaning. They give stats and all but the best weapons in the game (from when I played and apparently is still the same) is a very minor step up from the one below it which you can obtain a lot easier. Only difference really is the ""best"" weapon is a raindbow effect thing when you swing and such. You grind a lot for gear running dungeons that only are cosmetic as well. Not for me. Good side though is GW2 does promote team work and grouping so thats always nice imo. It's an MMO so playing with others should be a priority. Graphics look good (can also use SweetFx on it but never used it back when I played) and more limit to skill bar than ESO so that may be another point for you."
MMORPG,3do9tz,PM_For_Help,2,Fri Jul 17 23:51:16 2015 UTC,"From what others have said, I think either one would be fine for me skillbar wise. As for what I enjoyed about other mmos, I've only truly played through gw1, so my experience is limited to that mostly. I really liked that you could have npcs join you to fill roles in your party. Also, an engaging story is nice, but not necessary if the gameplay is good. I don't mind running through content solo, as long as it isn't too difficult to find a party for group content.  For eso, how much versatility is there for a build? Can I make my own build around my playstyle or is there a strong meta that will limit me to a few different builds that outclass anything else? And final question, how long is it going to take me to get to endgame for each game? While I don't want to rush right into it, I don't want to be feel like I'm just grinding to get to the end."
MMORPG,3do9tz,PM_For_Help,0,Sat Jul 18 00:02:45 2015 UTC,"Hard to say. From what everyone else has been saying, ESO doesn't take too long to hit cap which I do believe. You can Solo PvE pretty easily and don't really need to group besides Dungeons if you choose to do them though you're better off joining a Guild (can have up to 5 btw) and asking for groups there or asking in chat. ESO has a group finder but it's apprently crap so nobody uses it. Still doesn't too bad to find groups though. As for Builds being viable ESO rains supreme imo. You can literally make any kind of build you want and still be viable. Want to be a 2-Handed Sword magic User? Go for it. A warrior of Magic? It'll work. This game does an amazing job at allowing you to do anything you want in any way you want. Specifics only really come into play if you're a hardcore min/maxer player.  From what I remember for GW2 leveling is pretty easy as well. Haven't played since around Launch though so no idea if it changed but, honestly, I definitely had more fun and actually hit lvl cap with GW2. Mind you this was years ago though and nowadays I think I'm worn out from the genre or something. I'm also not very much into the Elder Scrolls series so I've unfortunately lost interest in it.  Either way, you really shouldn't worry about how fast it is to lvl unless it's like the first Final Fantasy MMORPG that came out (I think it's 11) where it takes FOREVER to lvl which is really the only game I've seen take that long to lvl. In this aspect of the games, don't think you can go wrong either way. Have fun and happy cake day."
MMORPG,3do9tz,raiash,5,Sat Jul 18 00:26:57 2015 UTC,"Guild Wars 2 is a completely different skill system than Guild Wars 1. While I can't speak for ESO I could speak for GW2.   There are a lot less skills/abilities to keep track of in GW2 than WoW and GW1. Most of the time you will only have to deal with the 1~0 keys for skills, with F1-F5 (With some in-between) for certain classes. You can swap out your 6~0 skills whenever you are out of combat, as well as 1~5 which depend on the weapon(s) you are wielding (And elemental attunement for Elementalists).  As for actual combat, you won't be standing still for encounters that aren't trash mobs. I won't get into the whole trinity or lack thereof philosophy of the game or the community's berserker mindset. Play it the way you enjoy it and find people who are similar in thinking that way, be it meta or not.  For character customization, it is definitely has a good system going for it. The wardrobe system lets you put on armor skins of a weight class (Light, medium, heavy) onto any piece of armor of the same weight class. Every time you soulbind any skin, it's unlocked for the account. The only limitations are different weights (of course) and race-exclusive armor. Dyes are also account-wide, however you will probably have to save up gold for the most popular colors (The darkest black and the brightest white). But, in the end, you will be 100% effective while being able to wear what you want.  As for actual characters, faces hair and such, there are a decent amount of options, with the gem store (essentially the cash shop) makeover kits having additional options. The biggest catch with the gem store is that you can exchange gold for gems, nowadays the conversion rate is probably pretty high, but getting gold is pretty easy once you're set on a routine.  Lore-wise, the game in its current state is a mess. This is mostly due to the update every 2 week philosophy they adopted a while back, which ended up getting rid of a lot of story content for those who missed it. The entirety of Living Story/World Season 1 cannot be played, though they promised to bring it back in a replayable way possibly with a gem store cost. Season 2 is playable, they made most of the content permanent and instanced, but if you didn't log in the game during those releases, locked behind the gem store. Which entirely, is a huge mess for a new player because we're expecting an expansion soon, supposedly by the end of this year (I believe the financial report suggested a Q3 2015 release).   As for the lore itself, it's pretty interesting, you might want to read a synopsis of the GW1 campaign trilogy + expansion as well as the post-content. As GW2 has been going on, they've been adding a lot more nods to GW1.  Last thing, if you pre-purchase the expansion or buy it when it releases, you get the base game free. They stated that they will be doing this with each expansion they release, including previous expansions."

MMORPG,3do9tz,Autumnplay,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:37:44 2015 UTC,"They're both good games with combat that don't have those huge skill bars you mention. GW2 is more polished because it's been out longer, while ESO is still enjoying the glamor of its recent console launch. ESO has a DLC coming out, GW2 is releasing a full expansion, so I feel like they're both in good places right now.  Both games look good, but in my personal opinion Guild Wars 2's art direction is better and the whole character customization angle is heavily emphasized. It's not like Guild Wars 1 where you had massive build diversity though. Arenanet has been trying very hard to keep classes balanced, which has resulted in a somewhat blander experience.  Personally, I prefer playing other Elderscrolls titles above ESO because I feel like they ""do Elderscrolls"" better than ESO. However, I think that the game must be great for those who have played all the existing Elderscrolls games to death and need more.  Guild Wars 2 is my personal favourite between the two, but  that game is really a hit or miss. You might love it. Or you might hate it. Things are getting pretty exciting with the expansion developments, but unfortunately we don't yet know whether Heart of Thorns will be just mediocre or as awesome as people hope it will be. :)"

ESO has a much more engaging and action based combat system, it's also great for people who don't like to have too many skills, because in ESO you can only have two sets of 5 skills and an ultimate for two weapons (12 total). As for character customization, you can tweak your character's looks quite a bit, but have to stay close to what the race looks like in general (no extreme hair colors, unnatural skin tones or anything like that). As a bonus, there are also disguises that can make you look like something else (eg. a goblin or a skeleton)."

I want that feeling of finally achieving a level after grinding the same mobs in the same area 18hrs a day for a week.  Rare items should actually be rare. (i.e. 0.00001% chance of dropping from a mob that randomly spawns every few days in the world in a public area.)  Only a handful of players in the whole server should have a ""rare item"". Stop making everyone shiny and nice looking, it loses its meaning when everyones ""special"".  Mounts should take at least months of grinding before you earn it.  Skills shouldn't be just given to players. Make them extremely rare drops for good ones, sell them for a really high price from NPC for shitty ones.  Quests should have absolutely no hints or guides or map markers what so ever.  I don't want like ""Kill 10 Wolves in this clearly marked area"", I want ""Kill 1000 Special Wolves that spawn one at a time on a random spot in a huge map, while contesting between hundreds of players.""  Stop making everything ""fair"" for players. Fair just means boring.  Oh and please don't slack off with graphics, that's rather important too.  If there's a game like that, please tell me.

In fact one of the most popular MMO's of all time in a lot of countries Ragnarok Online was based PURELY on grinding mobs because that's what some of the MMORPG playerbase in those countries and areas wanted.  Games are most definitely designed with a very specific amount of grind in them to suit the target playerbase.
MMORPG,3dknfr,sokaroka,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:23:51 2015 UTC,"I'm being a cynic here, but to companies, free users are always the product. Paying customers are the real users. Companies tend to bend over to the paying customers.   Yes, a lot of people do like to keep themselves occupied with multiple things and a simple grind is great as a filler activities to tacked onto others.   For grind heavy games, the idea is that the time saved from grinding generated enough value for users that can, to pay money. The free users are really just service/product used to establish a baseline for paying users to cross.   RO is a venerable MMO from the early 2000s. Newer games are generally as grindy as necessary to make users pay. Whether that means full-time job level of grind to give paying users an edge, or reduced grind to have a functioning economy to net more paying users, the bottom line is that it's a game of fishing for the people making the game. How long the line is depends on the fish they want to catch."
MMORPG,3dknfr,toothpicksmash,2,Fri Jul 17 18:36:23 2015 UTC,"Definitely, that's really just for games where they can make people pay extra though. You claimed that no one designs them with more or less grind but that's incredibly untrue.  With the fucking years and years of development that go into an MMO the amount of grind is DEFINITELY largely considered.  I mean look at games like EVE Online.  If you seriously think they didn't design the game with large scale grindy goals a mass focus then I don't know what to say.  Also you only talk about these games from one perspective. In the Asian markets grindy games are and always will be very large and the companies take that into account.  As well as the age of the target playerbase, if it's F2P/B2P etc.  There's soooooooo many things to take into consideration, it really is a big decision that has a large process through the dev process."
MMORPG,3dknfr,sokaroka,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:43:49 2015 UTC,"Fundamentally, grinding is not even a feature in designing a service or product, it's just a property of a feature in design. You very rarely if ever design anything around the property of a feature. You start off with ""We need Feature A"".  The pitch meets would never say anything along the line of ""gear grind game #15"" with a key feature being grind. The requirement gathering process would also never start off with feature ""X level of grind"".   Instead, something becomes a grind when a feature, such as leveling, is happening too fast for the management to justify the cost of development and operation. Or when content balance is changed, or something is made replayable.  There many scenarios in which a grind can happen, but a grind is a phenomenon that only happens when a feature or activity repeats."
MMORPG,3dknfr,toothpicksmash,3,Fri Jul 17 19:07:19 2015 UTC,Yes I agree but that really has nothing to do with anything I said. They still design the part of the features that becomes a grind and keep in mind how much of a grind that feature will be depending on the target playerbase.  Especially games like Runescape with so many skills to level. The algorithm for xp needed per level and what rate/level you unlock certain things was a BIG thing while designing that game.
MMORPG,3dknfr,sokaroka,3,Fri Jul 17 19:12:51 2015 UTC,"I enjoy Diablo type of games. I like grinding. I can grind for hours. It's like meditation for me. In fact, I'm awaiting the relaunch of a Lineage server on July 31st:  http://www.KingdomsofDeception.com  One of the grindiest games ever, and I love the hell out of it."
MMORPG,3dknfr,Thundercats_Hoooo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:53:46 2015 UTC,"I think it largely has to do with time investment. Traditional MMOs, especially at higher levels, tend to have fairly tanky enemies. In Diablo-likes, it's usually about tearing through a horde but, in traditional MMOs, a single enemy can take time to take down, especially as a low damage class. It starts to feel tedious much faster, and your progress begins to feel sluggish and limited. When you couple this with low xp rates for mob kills, balanced more for leveling through quests, it becomes a feeling akin to slogging through knee deep mud. Diablo-likes, on the other hand, are attuned more to grinding and xp rates are more fair in that regard.  At least, this is what my experience tells me is likely a root cause of it. Others could feel differently."

MMORPG,3dknfr,ronaldraygun91,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:25:30 2015 UTC,"Because in games like Path of Exile and Diablo, when you do a couple of hours of grinding, you're rewarded with some cool shit to try out/put on/trade/whatever, and you slowly work towards perfecting your character.  In typical grindy games, you grind with NO purpose until endgame. The entire early/midgame is just filler for endgame, because it's of no relevance to your endgame character. In PoE you can find items that are usable endgame/worth a crap top starting at level 1, first enemy."

Games like PoE and diablo are designed such that every player is a winner. Everyone will feel rewarded for their grind.  Whereas the typical greedy cash grab mmorpg are design such that every player is a loser. In both cases, the players have to beat the rng. That very minute chance at getting the perfect end game gear. But you don't get that many chance to ""spin the roulette"" in the typical mmorpg whereas in poe/diablo you are constantly spinning for EVERY mob that you kill."
MMORPG,3dknfr,BlackEnchanter,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:48:31 2015 UTC,"If people can enjoy games like Path of Exile or Diablo, where your sole purpose is almost entirely to grind mobs, then why did that become taboo for MMORPG's?   Because exploding enemies, and raining loots are very satisfying, also none of multiple item of the same type can be exactly the same (due to randomise stats).   Thus one can hope getting a better stat item through constant mob grinding.. and yeah, exploding enemies..  PS: the design is also conflicted. Auction House is a staple in MMORPG, it can't work in Diablo / PoE kind of game, otherwise people will just cheat buying the items of AH instead of killing mobs (hence Diablo removed it in RoS)"
MMORPG,3dknfr,Aerowalk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:00:19 2015 UTC,"I would not say it's taboo. Just like any other entertainment option poe/diablo are chosen by a certain kind of person.

MMORPG,3dknfr,KonW,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:00:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah for me there's more to it that just gear in progression. It's a nice feeling when you're in a new dungeon with new mechanics, or when a new zone unlocks with new quests: it gives everything a larger (if a bit artificial) meaning. In ARPGs you usually don't care where you are or why you are doing something, you just kill kill kill.  That's why I actually don't like what they've done with Diablo 3 with bounties and rifts: you just run around checking random checkboxes that are dispersed all over the world without any reason of doing so, with the now way too flexible difficulty tiers. You don't really have a sense of place anymore, and there's never a reason to ever do a quest or progress in a storywise meaningful way. I preferred working toward a single goal in old D3 of clearing the game in every single difficulty to access the next one.  Don't get me wrong, I very much enjoy ARPGs, and I may have a very unpopular opinion, but I guess I enjoy playing a game with a more ""tailored and linear"" progress track than an overly randomly generated one, if that makes sense."

Generally in p2w games, the Dev will design it in such a way that acquiring gear progression to be extremely difficult(to ""encourage"" players to open up their wallet)  Now everyone knows PoE and diablo ain't p2w games. The term loot explosion means that players can grind and ""beat the rng"" eventually as loots comes in great numbers.  However have you ever seen loot explosion in p2w mmorpg? Dev from these p2w mmorpg depends on players not ""beating the rng"" and succumb to item mall purchase to override that rng."

MMORPG,3dknfr,MrNotSoNiceGuy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:23:46 2015 UTC,Because the gameplay doesn't feel like a grind. You also progressively feel like you're getting stronger (mostly in the early/mid game) whereas in MMO the progression happens over a far longer period of time and is often gated.
MMORPG,3dknfr,Jaeryth,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:48:05 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of Ragnarok Online.  The only way to level and get stuff was to grind mobs that often died quickly, sometimes in two skills, yet people had a blast doing it for hours, be it solo or in a group. Hell, some jobs didn't even use skills other than self buffs.  I think MMOs now are too focused on the busy work, pressing buttons and doing rotations over and over, that killing monsters has turned into a chore instead of fun."
MMORPG,3dknfr,piedpeid,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:12:59 2015 UTC,"The difference is in games like Diablo, the enemeis die within 1-3 hits and an encounter generally lasts about 3 seconds. In MMO's, encounters usually last about 10-30 seconds.  In Diablo you're mowing down hordes of enemies, whereas in MMO's you're usually fighting one or two enemies at a time."

In MMORPG's I usually do it because a quest told me to, not because I had that urge."

Dn offers a lot more gameplay wise, and tries to focus on action combat. It's getting a huge revamp in korea for the entire game this month (through everything, and I mean everything). Now might be a good time to pick it up, but no one knows if the patches will destroy the game. It has good populations during peak time like any other game; however, you will probably not find much people to level with in other times. I have played Aura kingdom, and it's kind of a ghetto hybrid. You have to just walk away from the red lines that appear from the ground iirc and auto attack and press a skill. Aesthetically, it's focused on anime, so there's that. It was a breath of fresh air back then though. The art was fun and airy, but it didn't last long."

I believe the max level is 75 or 70 right now, I only made it to 58, 1-55 is perfectly fine. Then you hit 55 and suddenly you're expected to level to 60 through nothing but the daily quests and dungeon grinding, because the next leveling area isn't until 60, and even then it'll probably only get you to 62-63 and you'll have to do the same thing.  The levels don't go fast either, 55-58 took me like 3 days of doing the dailies and 2-3 dungeon runs because I didn't feel like spamming them over and over again. and I still had 12-15 levels to go lol.   Be prepared for a grind if you want to play it, though it has been about a year since then, so they may have toned it down."

BGs are balanced as they can be in an MMO, as you can't be ""outgeared"" in instanced PvP, and you're scaled to level cap.  There's also WvW (three servers vying for control over a giant map with numerous keeps and other objectives - servers rotate every 2 weeks IIRC), which isn't my cup of tea personally, but some folks, like my little sister, had a lot of fun with it.  On the downside, PvE combat may get stale quicker than in the other MMOs.  It's nifty that you can level through exploration and stuff though: there are some rather well designed jumping puzzles in the game."

MMORPG,3dkave,iwanthidan,10,Fri Jul 17 10:08:03 2015 UTC,"I would say ESO or GW2 based on what you've described. Most likely GW2.  GW2 is probably the cheapest to pick up and PvP level is kept separate or does some scaling so you still feel like you can do something (in WoW level matters, level limits which BGs you can access, and at lower levels you're dealing with twinks). The large battles there are potentially larger than in WoW. You can also start another character for PvP fairly easy. (Disclaimer: I haven't leveled in GW2 since they locked abilities to particular levels)  ESO doesn't have the smaller scale BGs with different objectives (like Arathi Basin, Warsong Gulch, etc.), but it has PvP on a scale larger than GW2 (which itself has WvW, which is a larger scale than anything in WoW). So you're a little more limited, but it might be a good choice if you prefer the huge battles, taking keeps, etc. If you prefer (or even want at all) smaller scale battles then GW2 is the better choice."

MMORPG,3dkave,Zeydon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:10:28 2015 UTC,"Problem I have with WvW is that the instant you capture something, it's instantly yours with full HP. No defending your newly captured keep and repairing it, as soon as you capture it no one's gonna bother you until the next zerg comes by.  If I could change it, I would make it so that the castles were wrecked when you capture it, which would force to zerg to either split or force them to defend. You'd get points for defending of course, and you would have to transport the supplies or capture the supply points and they would deliver the supplies to you.   Your group would have to repair while the enemy gets it's force together to either siege you back to recapture it or have forces ready to defend the next point of attack(s). This would force zergs to not be as 'zergy' and just hope from one place to the next without care of the point they captured and actually use more strategy instead of using momentum to just capture capture capture, done."

There are many players who attack players the same level as themselves.  You and others need to stop using the word 'gank' as if the definition of it is to attack low level players. It's not, it used to mean 'gang-Attack' shortened to 'gank' and always means a player who attacks a player in surprise. Just because the option or because that's all you've experienced, doesn't mean it's true.  What can be fixed about this? Use what runescape did, only able to attack players within a certain range of yourself. Make it +/-5 Levels, so if you're level 30 you can only attack 25-35 or at max, say 70, you can only attack players 65-70. This makes the leveling experience for lowbies better while keeping a competitive pvp experience at all levels."
MMORPG,3dkave,xDialtone,2,Fri Jul 17 03:07:04 2015 UTC,"Ahh yes, the holy grail of open world pvp.  Only games I can think of where I had any luck in that department was in TERA, Wildstar, and Vanilla WoW; and even then, those moments were few and far between."

MMORPG,3dkave,Soperos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:01:30 2015 UTC,Just because you don't gank lowbies doesn't mean other people won't. Open world pvp doesn't do anything except ruining other's experience and make trolls happy.

MMORPG,3dkave,Soperos,2,Fri Jul 17 11:06:08 2015 UTC,F2P + PvP + action combat + skimpy armors attract horny teenagers I guess. I usually just ignore the global chat.   If you want good community it's GW2 / FF14 (but then FF14 PvP is just a 24 v 24 v 24 arena and quite limited).

MMORPG,3dkave,1Sweet1Sweet,0,Fri Jul 17 01:12:57 2015 UTC,"GW2's combat is a Hybrid of both, but more action combat than tab targeting.   You can dodge arrows or get out of melee attack by simply stepping to the side or hide behind a pillar.  You don't need targeting when using melee attacks. The only part where GW2 is tab target is that projectiles require a target to hit.   Here is a video that explains the difference between Action Combat and Tab targeting"

MMORPG,3dkave,azrakels,0,Fri Jul 17 03:20:48 2015 UTC,Try Wildstar if you like istanced PvP like WoW.   Try Gw2 if you like zerks/group PvP more.
MMORPG,3dkave,vulcanraven89,-12,Fri Jul 17 12:25:33 2015 UTC,"You sound like you will love GW2. There's 2 types of PvP in GW2: sPvP (Structured) and WvW (World vs World)   sPvP is a 5v5 match set in an instanced ""arena"" type battleground. All the maps are pretty much like Domination where you capture and hold points. There's 1 map where it's like a TDM kinda thing which is fun sometimes. There is no gear difference in this game mode and it's all skill-based. There is ranked, however the leaderboards/ladder system is kinda meh and needs to be reworked, but that's pretty much it. This is where the majority of the PvPers in GW2 hang out and play. WvW is a whole different ball game. WvW can have fights that range from 1v1s to 50v50, and needless to say can be pretty unbalanced sometimes too. However if you love large scale fights then these are a ton of fun to get into regardless. This is a game mode where gear matters, and you can use food buffs and stuff on your character here. The maps for WvW are VERY big compared to the sPvP maps. Also, this is the part of GW2 where which server you pick matters. In WvW, 3 servers are pinned against eachother each week and fight to win in points. You get points by capturing towers & camps, taking the other server's towers and camps, etc. As you do better in WvW your server will move up tiers and get matched up against other servers. Also, each server usually has a bunch of guilds and server websites you can find if you wanted to get into a community.   Both game modes have options for you for both solo play and guild play. I personally love solo roaming on WvW maps, it's one of my favorite things to do in GW2, but doing sPvP with my guildies during off-time is always fun too. I'm exclusively a PvPer and I can vouch for GW2 in that it's the best PvP MMORPG on the market right now for sure. For PvE it still has some options but GW2 does not excel in PvE, I'd actually argue it's one of the worst MMORPGs for PvE. If you want to mainly PvE I'd go with WoW or ESO.  If you end up not liking GW2 then WoW is a good second for PvP but it does have a monthly subscription. I would not touch ESO for PvP until later updates, it needs a lot of work atm and you're better off playing GW2 or WoW for now."
MMORPG,3dkave,I_Browse_Reddit,4,Fri Jul 17 18:05:46 2015 UTC,Yea if your mainly focused on PvP I'd say go with ESO. WoW is good but do you like the fighting mechanics WoW has or would do want more action oriented? That would probably be the big part for determining if you want WoW at all. It has the old-school clickity click attack where ESO and GW2 have action oriented combat so no real standing still.
MMORPG,3dkave,PM_For_Help,-3,Fri Jul 17 23:55:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly go with WoW, good leveling experience, tons of bg maps.modes.. arenas aswell..  Theres open world pvp,duels,ganks..   ESO only got its action combat and class system + graphics.. PVP there is only one map, fighting for castles/keeps ( massive groups vs massive groups ) its repetitive.. no openworld pvp or duels at all..  GW2 leveling is boring as shit, dull map completions.. zones are restricted to that zone levle so you cant be lvl 80 and 1shot lvl 1 npcs.. but pvp is fun.. arenas are there aswell.. wvw is sort of like bg but ESO style.. battle for keeps zergs vs zergs, Like ESO no open world pvp,duels.."
MMORPG,3dkave,Kunaixx,2,Fri Jul 17 01:45:15 2015 UTC,"WoW sucks, leveling experience is just paying money and you get instant max level. GW2 and ESO both have better PvP than WoW. Open world PvP in WoW doesn't mean anything."

MMORPG,3dkave,ITSAFUCKINGFAKE,4,Fri Jul 17 03:08:24 2015 UTC,"First of all, I'd like to say, that none of these games are truly PvP oriented, they're all themepark PvE games with PvP elements integrated into the game. If you want a PvP game, try Lineage 2, Eve, Age of Wushu or Darkfall. That said, WoW has been going downhill for a long time now and starting it now with all of it's downfalls is probably not a good idea, unless you want to play on a vanilla or BC private server. Personally I didn't like GW2, it felt VERY generic and mundane, I really don't understand why the people on this sub like it so much. As for ESO, I just started playing it a week ago and the game feels really amazing, thought through, high budget and high quality. Can't say much about PvP, since I haven't tried it yet, but judging by the videos it looks pretty solid and the smaller scale battles will be coming to the game with the DLC in august."

MMORPG,3dis80,jellomoose,5,Thu Jul 16 21:13:08 2015 UTC,I don't really get the Star Citizen hate that goes on.  Their development is something like 2.5 years deep now?  Aren't there a lot of MMOs that took 5 years to develop?  Would it be better if they just went dark for a year rather than trickling out info?
MMORPG,3dis80,KadeLylath,5,Thu Jul 16 23:41:47 2015 UTC,I've never understood the hate either. It's still young in it's development. It's father along than most games are after 2.5 years.

They also claim that the reason the game isn't pay2win is because all ships have to be earned in-game, you can't buy them with money -- except they keep selling all the ships right now for money, which makes it a moot point."
MMORPG,3dis80,EvoEpitaph,2,Fri Jul 17 00:52:27 2015 UTC,"The hate comes from the fact that they keep pumping out content for their digital storefront, rather than just building the stupid game.   Are you certain that the teams building the digital storefront content and ships are the same teams that could be building the game? I honestly don't think that they are and doing the latter is much harder which is why we might be seeing an influx of ships and marketplace stuff.  I get that people are frustrated but being a game developer doesn't mean you know how to build all parts of a game, especially parts which have never been done before (or so we're being told). Plus throwing more people at the problem doesn't necessarily make it go faster, the logistics and management of the extra people could just make it all worse.   They also claim that the reason the game isn't pay2win is because all ships have to be earned in-game, you can't buy them with money   I'm a little concerned also with the ship sales but the end result will vary wildly depending upon how difficult it is to obtain these ships in the game and how critical these ships will be in the beginning stages of the full release. If on our first flights into freespace we can get ganked by these people dropping absurd amounts on the game, then i'll be very unhappy.  But there's always the fact that the amount of people with fancy ships will be dwarfed by the amount of backers that just own a stupid racer (like the ATI never settle promos) or entry level pledges in addition to the people who pick the game up at beta/release. This would dilute the problem a bit, but we'll find out just how much at release.  Edited periodically for grammar and such (which I'm sure is still horrendous, my bad)"
MMORPG,3dis80,_Aurora_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:36:33 2015 UTC,"I'd say Star Citizen should allow for semi-realistic ""pirate training"" - where a few of the early ingame-only ships have increased aggro and faster speed: maybe something like a ""cargo express ship""? Add lower-level ships not being able to participate in direct PvP with built-in shields and you've got a winner - balancing SHOULD be that a line of these ships exist but they eventually become totally cloaked instead (though they have practically no weapons) so they aren't crazy-OP (siccing pirate armadas isn't that easy) and there's reasonable encouragement to upgrade ""freighter-style"" 'support' type ships."
MMORPG,3dis80,kainsshadow,-1,Fri Jul 17 10:47:30 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure they went quiet due to them having to rebuild the engine. Hard to pump out new content for an engine not finished yet xD

It was going to be the sandbox to end all sandboxes, the game that did everything right that Eve did wrong, etc. Was like a crusade out there.  After that it was mostly because the furious amount of spinning to minimize the way its crowdfunding is being handled in its p2w way.

MMORPG,3dis80,Steftiffe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:10:10 2015 UTC,Lol IDK if I would call it a huge hit but it's.....there. I love FF quite a bit but the expansion is really just that - an expansion on what was already there. Not a whole lot that is new. And the raid that's out right now is far too easy. They will be putting in another one soon and a HM of Alexander (current Raid out) so that will be worth logging in for.  But I like the FF rep. Great game!
MMORPG,3dis80,EQCazik,2,Thu Jul 16 21:16:05 2015 UTC,I think it's safe to say it was a huge hit. Most people have been really enjoying it and the press for it has been great (most review sites have given it an 8 or 9 out of 10). There's been plenty of twitch and youtube attention and the sales of the game have increased quite dramatically over the past 4 months.
MMORPG,3dis80,parraine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:35:16 2015 UTC,"Oh sure it was successful. I would say WoW was a huge hit in it's heyday. I would not say this was a huge hit but it was certainly successful and I did enjoy some of the expansion.

We had a few guildies that hit 50 and stopped playing for a while. Came back after 4 or 5 patches and they had about 10 hours of main storyline to finish and another few hours of story dungeons.   Then, to top it off, they gated the level 60 content behind a fairly difficult trial. They did nerf it about 4 weeks before the expansion dropped and it was insanely easy after the nerf - but still - I have a feeling that lost some players and left a sour taste in some of their mouths. But the expansion was totally worth doing it all just for the flying. The flying in that game is so satisfying. If only there was more things to do in the open world."

The people you see complaining about DFUW having things ""ripped"" from the original game are veterans of the original who think DFUW is dumbed down, less skill based and much less variety in gameplay. The reason behind this is DFO was no skill-cap, unlimited skills and you could play however you wanted, DFUW has a class system whereby you choose a set number of spells from every school in the game to build whatever class you want.   If you decide to play DFUW, I'd wait until the new patch hits next week as the population right now is down super low as people have been waiting on this patch for a long time."
MMORPG,3di1gi,Kiralol,3,Thu Jul 16 13:29:49 2015 UTC,Ahh - that's what I was afraid of but it sounds like DFUW may still be worth checking out. One of the main appeals to me was the seamless world and open/public dungeons. Are those still in existence or did they move to an instanced dungeon model?  That was actually the main feature that drew me in as no other games seem to even attempt that.
MMORPG,3di1gi,Kiralol,5,Thu Jul 16 13:34:23 2015 UTC,"World is 100% open with zero load screens, very large world. The only load screens in the game are recall spells (bindstone recall, house recall), portal chambers ( set locations, teleport around the map for small cost) and loading into the dungeons. Dungeons aren't instanced, if you're in a dungeon there could already be people in there or come in after you, some are very large / confusing.  It's the only full loot pvp MMORPG that I can stand playing, as a UO/DFO vet and having played Albion, Mortal and eve, it's pretty much the only one that is any good imo. DFO was better, I enjoyed it more...But DFUW is a close second, it's not as bad as people make out."
MMORPG,3di1gi,AwwSee,4,Thu Jul 16 13:39:03 2015 UTC,"Well holy shit - why haven't I heard of this/hasn't this game gotten more hype? This is exactly the type of thing people are looking for. I'm sure there are some drawbacks (I know some people really have a strong aversion to PVP) but the seamless-ness of the world could make up for that.   When you say ""load into dungeon"" is it similair to a dungeon in EQ where you have to ""zone in"" but then the dungeon is still open world and many groups can be in there/camp there? That kind of sounds like what you have explained but I want to make sure.   I mean this sounds amazing. Like exactly the game I want to be playing. Is the PVP still open world as well? Are there factions?   Is this game B2P or F2P? When I looked around it didn't look like it was a F2P. Is there a pay-to-win cash shop? That may kill it for me."
MMORPG,3di1gi,Kiralol,5,Thu Jul 16 13:54:50 2015 UTC,"I am with you, game certainly seems appealing. Something must be holding back if there is no player base."
MMORPG,3di1gi,gladudontknowme,3,Thu Jul 16 14:00:32 2015 UTC,Well I am going to give it a try so I will let you know if I find any glaring weaknesses that Kiralol didn't touch on!
MMORPG,3di1gi,3lfk1ng,2,Thu Jul 16 14:37:20 2015 UTC,"Okay it's buy to play and pay to play, but the cost of a month's sub is the same price as the game, the game comes with a month sub. So basically you buy the game and you have 30 days of game time. They also have a cash shop but it's not pay to win at all, in the cash shop you can buy an item called ""D.U.E.L"" which is just like EVE's PLEX, upon use grants the player 30 days of game time, then just weapon skins and stuff. I played for 20 days about 2 months ago and made enough gold to keep my account subbed for 3 months just buying the DUEL's from people.  PVP is 100% open world, aside from in safe zones which are designated starter zones/npc cities, the safe zones only contain noob mobs, nerfed gathering and crafting so people don't stick around in them for long except for safe trading etc. Everywhere else is free game, like 95% of the world is not a safe zone.  Loading into a dungeon is exactly what it sounds like, you go to the dungeon entrance, hit use key, you wait for the cooldown to enter (to stop people just instantly zoning into a dungeon mid pvp or being chased it takes like 5 seconds to channel entering) and then you hit a load screen before you spawn in the entrance of the dungeon. The dungeon is then open world, there could be 500 people in there for all you know.  Drawbacks to the game is the population is toxic, the company is pretty clueless and updates are few and far between. Game is fun, population dwindles hard between patches, but is still enough to play if you enjoy the game."
MMORPG,3di1gi,gladudontknowme,2,Thu Jul 16 14:04:49 2015 UTC,"The population is toxic because the remaining players are like the rotting cesspool filled with shit that is left behind after a beautiful pond has evaporated. All the real respectable leaders, players, and clans that used to drown out the toxic players all quit because nobody has a shred of respect for AV and do not want to be stringed along with lies for another half decade. Darkfall was a great game, needed some changes, but even on the last day of gameplay had a population bigger tham DFUW had. Also main reason DFUW died is that they couldn't handle the huge siege numbers on there servers like in DFO. This meant political conquest and territorial control were fucked and that pissed most true DF vets off."
MMORPG,3di1gi,3lfk1ng,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:55:28 2015 UTC,"Also main reason DFUW died is that they couldn't handle the huge siege numbers on there servers like in DFO.    Bingo! The netcode and hitbox detection in DFUW was a huge step backwards.  Still, DFUW would be a healthy title with enough players."
MMORPG,3di1gi,Kiralol,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:46:49 2015 UTC,"I was recording with Fraps 200v200 people sieges in DFO. I could barely play in 90v90 man sieges in DFUW with the amount of server lag, ping, FPS issues. I did not have 1 single enjoyable large man scale siege. The best sieges were when the main 3 alliances were all dying and the majority of battles over hamlets/towns was about 25 v 25  All they did with the DFO engine from DFO to DFUW was change the textures and force you to use a higher more graphics game. They just upped the minimum settings and said ""look at the beautiful new game we made"", even 12yo's who i hated in DFO were like ""omfg this is the same stupid client you fucking noobs"""
MMORPG,3di1gi,Kenpokid4,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:14:30 2015 UTC,"...and then they forced a complete wipe of all the players by closing the game, promising a better experience, forcing the purchase of a new title, and then they spent the next two years re-implementing features that were already in DFO."
MMORPG,3di1gi,sssnakepit1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:23:45 2015 UTC,That's fairly depressing. AV sounds alot like SoE back in their heyday. Although EQ2 was genuinely an entirely new game to play whereas it sounds like DFUW is the same game with a shiny new textures.   Even still - this sounds like a fairly awesome game. Were people just mostly upset about the way the transition happened from DF to DFUW coupled with the poor performance issues? Is that what jettisoned the player base to other games?
MMORPG,3di1gi,Verde321,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:45:22 2015 UTC,All of this sounds great to me. I suppose I would just need to give it a shot now that I am super hyped for it.   Curious though - are you saying the sub is $60/month? If so - that's a little outrageous. I could get behind $30-$45 but the game would have to AHHHH-MAZING. And it sounds like it is so I think I'm going to give this a go. How intensive is it on your PC?
MMORPG,3di1gi,kainsshadow,2,Thu Jul 16 14:33:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure where you got $60 a month? It's like $15. Not intensive at all, but I have a good pc."
MMORPG,3di1gi,kainsshadow,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:34:31 2015 UTC,Oh my bad - you had mentioned the sub cost the same as the game and I just assumed it was a $60 game.
MMORPG,3di1gi,Kiralol,2,Thu Jul 16 14:36:48 2015 UTC,Sub based.
MMORPG,3di1gi,kainsshadow,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:17:22 2015 UTC,Well holy shit - why haven't I heard of this/hasn't this game gotten more hype? This is exactly the type of thing people are looking for.   My guess is that there aren't actually as many people who want that sort of game as this subreddit would have you believe.
MMORPG,3di1gi,Kiralol,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:10:03 2015 UTC,Factions are entirely player made. Clans (guilds) can form/break alliances at will. Friendly fire on everything. Darkfall is a game that sounds great on paper. I played dfuw for about a year and a half and had some great times. One day I just got tired of playing and never logged in again.   The main thing holding the game back is probably the company that runs the game. Some of them at least seem like they care while others are just totally incompetent. Th next problem is the population and size of the game. The world is huuuuuuuuge. But when there are 2-300 players you can go a long time never seeing anyone else.
MMORPG,3di1gi,kainsshadow,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:50:00 2015 UTC,"Its box price with a subscription of a AAA mmo with the production/funding of a C game. That mixed with zero marketing means no player base. The month that I played it I still was confused and just overall annoyed with the shitty UI that was poorly designed and never updated. IMO if they just had a better UI it would have been a bit better xD. That game though is beyond its chance, it will never reach the player base numbers needed to make it any good. As of right now (or ever really) you would get one fun amazing war maybe every 6 months to a year. Not much interesting in between though :/"
MMORPG,3di1gi,3lfk1ng,0,Fri Jul 17 02:06:38 2015 UTC,I see you added Albion... which is still in alpha testing xD Sorta unfair to base a final judgement on a game not even out yet. Though I agree with the others being pretty meh. Idea behind EVE I enjoy but the combat... so boring. Although if you can't stand the isometric style of Albion then I will give you that but doesn't mean game is bad.
MMORPG,3di1gi,3lfk1ng,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:02:34 2015 UTC,"I never said the game is bad. I just said it's not good in my opinion, in terms of a full loot PvP sandbox. I have a legendary founder's account and I have played it a fair amount in the alpha so far, it's a good game and I enjoy it, but comparing it to UO/AC/DFO it's not the same kind of game. Way too much catering to the non-hardcore pvp crowd, almost no skill to the pvp system that relies almost 100% on gear to beat opponents and a serious lack of risk/reward for PvP. Alphas usually don't change that much from the end product in my experience and since the Devs have already stated the interface/core gameplay won't change because they have to make the game playable/fun on tablets etc I can't see it becoming a good choice for someone like me, who is looking for hardcore full loot pvp sandbox MMORPGs. Which just goes back to my original point that Darkfall is currently the only good choice if you share my taste."
MMORPG,3di1gi,3lfk1ng,0,Fri Jul 17 06:36:33 2015 UTC,Except they are making a full loot sandbox MMO xD They are reducing safe zones for launch. As they add new zones and content tiers they are increasing the safe zones so people can have an easier time getting to new zones/tiers so they can be tested. They won't remain safe zones at launch.
MMORPG,3di1gi,3lfk1ng,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:22:26 2015 UTC,"Still doesn't subtract from the lack of skill based pvp, which is the backbone of pvp games."
MMORPG,3di1gi,xDialtone,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:37:43 2015 UTC,I mean that really depends... I wouldn't consider wow or other target based mmos to be skill based either >_>
MMORPG,3di1gi,3lfk1ng,3,Fri Jul 17 07:44:14 2015 UTC,"It's a terrific game and currently the only of its kind worth the price of admission. If it had more players, I would be back in a heartbeat.   I still miss the DFO elements though but that doesn't mean that DFUW is a bad game. There are a lot of features in DFUW that I wish were in DFO too."
MMORPG,3di1gi,Fudashii,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:43:34 2015 UTC,What were some of those elements? The two main things that interested me seem to be alive and well in this game although from the new patch notes it sounds like they may nerf the cost of re-gearing yourself a little bit.
MMORPG,3di1gi,darkheartsmd,2,Thu Jul 16 15:48:25 2015 UTC,Massive 500 player battles that didn't bring the server to its knees Unlimited Horizontal progression (although it was heavily exploited)    Regearing was never really much of an issue. Anyone who was anyone had multiple sets in their bank and it only ever took about 20 minutes to make a new set.
MMORPG,3di1gi,darkheartsmd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:58:46 2015 UTC,"Damn that is an impressive PVP battle size. I imagine with the population where its @ now, the battles are much smaller?  So the progression model is vertical now? Are there specific talent tree's or something else entirely?"
MMORPG,3di1gi,falloutdc,2,Thu Jul 16 16:40:36 2015 UTC,"It could support large scale battle now, it's just a little too late because there just aren't enough players.  People are waiting anxiously for the possibility of a licensed DFO emulator that is in progress.  Most everyone who was a fan of DFO's gameplay are looking forward to the FFA Hardcore PVP MMORPG title ""Crowfall"" that will be a mix of Shadowbane, UO and Darkfall."
MMORPG,3di1gi,retuxan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:29:23 2015 UTC,"Saw the other reply and that is very sad. I was hoping the company that made this was going to be different than some of the others that I am familiar with but they appear the same. Kinda hurts that it's based in Greece too - they are crumbling.   I did see Crowfall on Kickstarter and only saw a couple of vids. The camera angle looked rather birds-eye and that kinda put me off. Almost like a MOBA.   I will probably play Crowfall if it's any good but from what I understand the content will be rolled out in ""Campaigns"" that reset on an undetermined amount of time. I've heard the number 4 and 6 months mentioned. That is also kind of a killer for me but it's not something that's been tried in an MMO before so it could be neat. Who knows I guess."
MMORPG,3di1gi,bluefootedpig,2,Thu Jul 16 18:12:35 2015 UTC,"The videos of Crowfall are just proof of concept, nothing more. They were made to seek funds during their Kickstarter campaign using premade art assets from the Unity game engine and now they are making the actual game.  Crowfall Like Darkfall, it's offers a large-scale FFA PVP experience. Like Shadowbane it offers large-scale conquest and sandbox base building.  Each round can last for several months and only resets after the win conditions are met. Each campaign has different win conditions and perks as well as varying degrees of difficulty but every time some guild alliance wins the map, the world is wiped, procedurally regenerated to be completely different, resources scattered everywhere in different locations, guilds scattered everywhere, and then the land rush begins again.  Why would they do that? Because the battle for territory, control over resources and finding a premium place to build your keep is invigorating, refreshing and exciting!  The seasons even have an impact on the world as large bodies of water turn to ice in the winters, letting foes freely cross what was once a great fortification strategy in the summer.  Crowfall uses Voxels for everything, think world and building destruction (ala Red Faction 1). Players can dig trenches, carve caves, blow up castle walls, etc etc in order to win a battle and so the war-scarred lands will remain just that until the purge. Outside of battles marring the land over time, players will eventually exhaust the world of valuable resources by logging trees and mining ore just to build their bases and provide for their armies. As the world's resources grow scarce the guilds will start to fight over what's left and pillage eachother or form alliances to strengthen their chances against others. While all of this is happening, an evil scourge is causing the NPCs to get stronger and stronger as time progresses, making it that much harder for players to collect crafting resources until all that is left is to kill eachother (NPC mobs drop crafting reagents, but while rewarding they get exponentially stronger over time requiring larger parties to take them down).  What's cool is that ArtCraft won't implement new content mid-battle for each campaign. So, when a campaign starts, those are the rulse. During that campaign, ArtCraft might annouce seige machines, new spells or abilities, new mobs, new resources to collect but none it will impact the current battle. Once the war is won and map resets, all that new content that has been worked on over the course of many month will then be added to the campaigns ruleset so each wipe feels like a mini-expansion, refreshing in it's own way.  There will be no leveling or dungeons to speak of, the focus is on PVP. It's essentially a 3D version of Risk/ Civilization/ Darkfall/ Shadowbane/ Red Faction.  The game goes pre-alpha at the end of the summer(without an NDA) so there should be plenty of gameplay footage soon."
MMORPG,3di1gi,Kiralol,2,Thu Jul 16 18:36:23 2015 UTC,"Sounds awesome, I really didn't get that much information from the main site or from searching. I was on the line about it, now I just hope there is some decent character customization or race selection. I'm cool with male/female for each one, but I'm not looking forward to playing a hamster as a duelist. I also hope there are different armor/weapon types and looks as well.  This image shows that you can at least choose gender, but looking at it, at least for now, the only customization is skin and and god selection. It's probably for testing and they haven't actually done anything outside the standard for testing, so I still have some hope. I personally just don't like seeing 20 of the same exact looking person running around."
MMORPG,3di1gi,bluefootedpig,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:55:57 2015 UTC,"I think I condensed what I had read/saw and tossed it aside but that actually sounds pretty damn cool. I like that it is PVP-centric but I would have some concerns on gear, stat optimization and if there would even be a character progression model.   I love the dynamic seasons cycle - that's super neat. Somehow I think the NPC's and monsters could end up being avoided all together if there isn't a benefit to kill them. Like if the mats that are dropping become obsolete. But hey, that's what Alpha is for and I do hope that game is kickass.  It could be the next great PVP game. I was hoping they would make some PvE elements that matter more in Crowfall but they should probably keep the focus on PVP and just make a great PVP game.   Still on the search for the greatest Sandbox PVE MMO."
MMORPG,3di1gi,Kiralol,2,Thu Jul 16 18:55:43 2015 UTC,"Still on the search for the greatest Sandbox PVE MMO.   Me too! That's exactly the reason why my guild just dropped GW2 and started playing Nostalrius (A free to play, World of Wacraft emulator with a level 60 cap, 6000 players, 40 man raids, Trinity system). We gave up on all the new stuff, they are all too casual, too linear, or too narrow of an experience to warrant the cost.  I cannot stand the new World of Warcraft but to date the original is still my favorite for PVE.  Shroud of the Avatar from Richard Garriot sounded so promising on paper but with each patch it just seems to get worse and worse on feature creep and lack of polish with no end in sight."
MMORPG,3di1gi,falloutdc,2,Thu Jul 16 19:06:21 2015 UTC,Oh dude we are the same wavelength here. I've been wavering between Nolstarius or Krono's. From what I have heard the Nolstarius server is located in the EU so NA ping is pretty bad. But I do still want to give it a shot and I'd much rather roll with a guild than start alone.  You may have seen me mention this but I play classic EQ on an emulated server as it's my original sandbox home. I actually played WoW upon release (ahh Vanilla I love you) up through the scourge that was WotLK. BC is still my all time favorite expansion next to EQ's Kunark. There was something about BC that was just fucking magical man.   Haven't heard of SoA - maybe that's a good thing.   How hard was the Nolstarius setup?
MMORPG,3di1gi,ImpressiveOctagon,3,Thu Jul 16 20:02:30 2015 UTC,The game is really good but I have never seen a more incompetent team of developers in my life. That is why the population is really low.   I still hold out hope they sell the IP to a decent team.
MMORPG,3di1gi,kainsshadow,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:14:42 2015 UTC,That seems to be the recurring theme here. I may have to hop on this emulated DFO server if it actually happens. Sounds like it would be super solid. We'll see I guess!
MMORPG,3di1gi,kainsshadow,2,Thu Jul 16 20:04:50 2015 UTC,I played it for a month then quit due to the population not being that great also due to the only way I knew how to level was off the mobs and that got REALLY stale quick... Kill the same orcs over and over and over. Would be fun if I could skip the mob killing or do it as optional.
MMORPG,3di1gi,PringlesXD,2,Thu Jul 16 13:53:50 2015 UTC,See that is my jam man. I love that type of a game. I would love nothing more than to grind some mobs for hours and then head off to a dungeon and meet up with some people inside. That is literally the type of game I want to play right now.   Is it pretty intensive on the PC? Would probably need a new graphics card.

I'm not trying to market the game or anything like that, just trying to let people know of a game that they might enjoy.  Open worlds are nice, but they never end up meaning anything unless the game world adds purpose to them. In games like WoW you just end up sitting in town your garrison queueing for bgs and dungeons all day, so after questing to the level cap, the open world loses its novelty. At that point, it's no better off than a hub based MMO with instances.  IMO MMORPGS need to add features like conquering zones or open world events for an open world to have actual purpose.  I'd do a full review, but I haven't played long enough to really know it's long term potential. Perhaps it'll be an awesome game that stays fun for years, or maybe it'll get old after a few weeks and become a grindfest. I'll see soon enough."

MMORPG,3dh3yw,notblack7,2,Thu Jul 16 06:00:37 2015 UTC,"How does it feel compared to Tera, GW2, and WildStar?  I understand there are animation locks similar to Tera or Monster Hunter. That's fine, as it's a design choice meant to set the pace of combat. I'm a big time Monster Hunter player, so I'm sure it won't be that big a deal for me.  But how varied are the actual instances and quests? How much will I be doing the same thing over and over? These are the real questions. ;3"
MMORPG,3dh3yw,Biohack,3,Thu Jul 16 07:16:22 2015 UTC,"Animation lock is more than a design choice. It makes physical sense not to be able to change the direction of your attack after you start it. Most action games I've seen do this (Ninja Gaiden, Zelda, Dark Souls, Super Smash Brothers, Street Fighter), even League and Dota 2 do this for the most part."
MMORPG,3dh3yw,Lawlta,2,Fri Jul 17 01:57:48 2015 UTC,"Animation locks are sort of between Tera and Wildstar. While it isn't as restrictive as Tera(In Tera you're pretty much always locked in place while attacking), and in wildstar there's pretty much no animation locks(except with a few abilities.  In Skyforge, you can move around while attacking a lot, but some skills have animation locks.  One thing that isn't easy to notice in the video is combat is sort of ""soft target"" you have to line up the cursor, but you can't swing without a target that you aim at, so it kinda feels off since you can't technically ""miss"".  As for repetition, it's too early for me to tell-I've only played for a few hours. So far it feels pretty varied, but I can see how it could get a little repetitive. It sounds like there's a good mix of dungeons and instances, so it isn't too bad."
MMORPG,3dh3yw,Zaraia,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:23:08 2015 UTC,"As someone who haaaaates animation locks, I really enjoy skyforges combat. It feels very fast paced and fluid."
MMORPG,3dh3yw,Lawlta,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:38:30 2015 UTC,"Wildstar has better combat, PvE, some form of player based economy, and open world exploration.  Skyforge has the ability to change classes when you unlock them on a single character.  There is a ""market"" but it's just a shop vendor more or less (no AH).  There is no trading of items (that I have seen at the least, and I'm about 20 hours into the game).  Skyforge just released (oops I mean open beta... except there's no character wipe from open beta -> ""release"").  There's a lot of people playing it, so once you get to the content you need to group, the groups will pop.  Also it's free, so you basically create an account and get going, which is nice.  It's a much more casual game right now, considering how long it takes to get to the end-game, and the amount of time involved to unlock advanced classes (that the devs say are supposedly not better than the starting classes, but I've read the contrary).  If I had to give a comparison, Skyforge feels like an updated version of Neverwinter (the MMO) without the auction house or trading.  There don't seem to be a lot of bugs, the companion system is more indepth than NW, the combat is very similar (lost of LC and RC combat), and you can swap classes.  The game doesn't have the holy trinity, but it basically goes like this:   Dungeons:  Need a tank and then dps. Starting Raids:  Need a tank, some supports, and some DPS. Getting comfortable in raids:  Need a tank and some DPS.   So basically you're going to need a tank for everything.  They just removed the healer from the trinity (there is not a class that can heal), but as you start to progress (around the 5k prestige mark for sure) you're going to need a tank to do group content with some ease."
MMORPG,3dh3yw,IrishWilly,6,Thu Jul 16 07:25:41 2015 UTC,"Do not understand all of the games deleting healers nowadays, (GW2, this, Blade & Soul, etc).  Some of us actually -like- hearing, darn it!  glares at newish mmo devs in righteous healy indignation  ;P"

There are a ton of ways to make a game full of interesting tactics and roles that still gets clumped into a 'trinity' description but doing away with it completely means you are removing all sense of teamwork."
MMORPG,3dh3yw,HappyWulf,2,Thu Jul 16 17:03:39 2015 UTC,"The way dungeons have gone for me when tanking are basically:   Get talent that makes all your damage do 400% threat. Attack mob Use shield abilities to help mitigate damage Dodge pounds, front lazers, etc. Handle mechanics like everyone else.   So basically I'm a gimped dps who uses a shield ability and sidestep every now and then.  I'm having fun with the game, but I'm not going to sugar coat what's going on.  I'm looking forward to Wildstar going F2P so that I can get back to finishing its raid content, this will be a nice distraction until then."
MMORPG,3dh3yw,Biohack,0,Thu Jul 16 17:07:44 2015 UTC,"There are still supports in skyforge, it's just that rather than having heals they have buffs and provide shields that block damage.   Skyforge's system is more about avoiding damage altogether (by having supports use shields) than about being able to heal your HP back up. The end result is that it's less forgiving in that you can't just power through and heal back up after a fuck up."

MMORPG,3dh3yw,ILoveToEatLobster,0,Thu Jul 16 17:06:49 2015 UTC,"action combat whereas Skyforge does not.    It's action combat.  For most abilities you have to have something aimed at, but from my personal experience, and everyone I've talked to, it's action combat.   trinity gameplay   You have to have a tank, and some DPS.  There aren't healers, just supports (alchemist and lightbinder) who help stack shields, but that's really it.  No real trinity, just everything requires a tank.  As I've said elsewhere:  The way dungeons have gone for me when tanking are basically:   Get talent that makes all your damage do 400% threat.

So basically I'm a gimped dps who uses a shield ability and sidestep every now and then.   world design, leveling, questing   Everything is instanced with a main hub in both.  NW and Skyforge both have giant maps with multiple quests (SF requires you to pick only some up and discover others).  They both have dungeons.  They both have instanced ""quest"" tunnels (SF you can solo or group queue for it).  The only thing that is ""different"" about this game is that it has the class swapping features of FFXI and FFXIV, and the leveling system of FFX and Path of Exile.  With those extra features, and the smoothness of everything, again, it feels like an updated/done right version of Neverwinter without the AH/trading."

For most abilities you have to have something aimed at, but from my personal experience, and everyone I've talked to, it's action combat.   Skyforge functions like a tab target game using a reticule mod. GW2 is more action combat than Skyforge and GW2 is a hybrid. Skyforge uses lock on targeting, tab target style, and you can't even hit anything unless you have a target. Action combat games let you use your skills anywhere and don't require targets and many don't lock on. Skyforge has unavoidable damage and only allows you to avoid telegraphed ground AoE attacks, the same as FFXIV, WoW, etc. Skyforge also doesn't have any iframes, the dodge is merely a ""move faster out of this AoE on the ground"" skill. It's tab target masked as an action combat game but the mechanics are not action at all."

It's not ideal but there isn't a run back to the quest giver at any point. If you're talking to someone giving you a mission (usually Herida), it's usually to confer about something. Never does it make you go ""hey, Herida! Here are those 20 berries you wanted!"" The game doesn't send you back needlessly and she's mere paces from the main ""portal"" to each of the zones.  The game also regularly sends you to Aelinet to ""upload"" results of missions, the node of which is another few paces from Herida, but it's not like Secret World where it actually feels like it does anything at all.

The huge grind for skyforge and focus on unlocking classes via xp makes advancing there similar to buying raid gear in other mmos. It's an important focus of the game and one in which cash shop players will outpace regulars"
MMORPG,3dh3yw,roiben,3,Thu Jul 16 22:22:57 2015 UTC,"The way skyforge works is that upgrade points are capped so you can only get so many per week, this is true for everyone no matter how much you spend on the game. That means that everyone will pretty much advance at the same rate no matter what.   However, by purchasing a premium account you will earn those points 50% faster meaning it will require less play time to hit the cap. It's hard to say what will happen with end game but right now people are hitting the caps in the first few days of the week anyway.  Also that's just the premium account which is only 15.00 or so a month. Even if you spend $10,000 on the game there is very little (if anything) you could actually do that would give you an advantage in the game."

MMORPG,3dh3yw,roiben,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:13:40 2015 UTC,"so you basically pay for time?    Kind of. Think of it like leveling. Where each week every person can earn a maximum of 5 levels, but those with the premium accounts get 50% more xp.   The game is super convoluted with a ton of different currencies and a ton of different ways to progress your character and there's a lot of things that at first glance would seem like pay to win but really aren't once you see how the whole system works together with the weekly caps.  Give the game a shot and see if you like it. It's funny ever since Archeage I've been hyper paranoid about pay to win, and this game constantly sets of red flags when I read about things. But when I play it and learn the mechanics I realize it's not nearlly as bad as it seems."

MMORPG,3dh3yw,PalwaJoko,3,Mon Jul 20 15:38:50 2015 UTC,"From what /u/skilliard4 said it sounds pay to win, but if you see the full system it's not at all.  It's a little complicated but basically what happens is your gear slots can be upgraded so you get more stats from gear placed in that slot. Each slot has a maximum upgrade rank, and by earning points in the game you can increase the maximum rank. You then need an additional item to actually upgrade your slot to your maximum upgrade rank.  So it works like this. Run missions, get special points, use special points to increase max rank from 0 to 1, use special item to upgrade actual rank from 0 to 1.  Because the special points are capped in what you can earn each week even if someone spends 10,000 dollars on the game they still won't be able to progress any faster than anyone else because the special points will limit the maximum upgrade rank they have unlocked.  Furthermore the items you need to upgrade are really easy to get. Every single piece of gear you get can be broken into the item you need.  Spending money really doesn't get you any advantage. In that respect.  In fact the only reason I would spend money on this game at all is to get the premium account option which will let you get an extra 50% more points per instance. It won't let you go past the point caps, but it will let you reach those caps faster each week."
MMORPG,3dh3yw,athena06,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:54:35 2015 UTC,Its really not since by the time you need the enchantment stones you already have enough.

MMORPG,3dh3yw,roiben,4,Thu Jul 16 19:21:05 2015 UTC,"Only thing that's got me annoyed about the game is the class system. If it's still the same, I choose one of the three ""starter"" classes.

MMORPG,3dh3yw,Endlesscrysis,5,Thu Jul 16 13:18:18 2015 UTC,"If you can get past the instanced aspect (which a lot seem to find hard to do, regardless of the fact that they can spend hours on completing the open world maps), its really fun to play.

The game is a pointless artificial grind, that may be fun to some but it just isn't for me.   This game will not last, the content is just too bare.   There is no crafting.  The only ""gear"" is 4 amulet slots, 4 ring slots and 2 weapon slots.  The ""costume"" system is just a one piece suit.  There is no exploration, it's just hubbed zones with slight bigger but confined open areas.  No open world pvp.  There are no collectables, artifacts, lore items. There is nothing to read to learn about the universe of the world.  This is not and I repeat not an MMO, it's a Online Action Multiplayer game at best.  There is no driven economy, no auction house no player stalls.  The game just gets boring incredibly fast, I won a founder key so have been playing for a week. I do not recommend this game if you're looking for an MMO. It honestly feels like a less fleshed out Neverwinter."

You have to do the same exact instances over and over again both for quests, and to get sparks and other resources you need to get stronger. The combat is ok but not great. As a ranged character, most fights just involve constantly strafing in a circle to avoid being hit while attacking when you can. There's a lot of classes to choose from which is cool, but you have to unlock them first. There are upgrade gems that you find that can only be used with argents (real money currency) which I hate, although you can exchange credits to argents, dunno if it's worth it (I hear the russian version had this patched out). I'll keep playing it, but it's already starting to feel like more of a chore than fun. I hope there's some more to it I haven't seen that will keep me playing."

You have to do the same adventures over and over to cap your class sparks. I regret buying the collector's edition."
MMORPG,3dh3yw,crazyloof,4,Sat Jul 18 04:47:35 2015 UTC,"For those interested, the combat is rather simple but quite elegant. The CC system is nice and light also. Most CC's (Knockdown, knockback, stun etc.) have their own Internal DR's which is awesome as if your class has 2 KD's you can use them both in a chain unlike say Wildstar where all KD for a target goes on cooldown.   Not sure yet how this works in PvP just yet, but hopefully when Open Beta starts proper the battlegrounds/arenas will pop a lot more for full-on testing.  When you hit about 4-5k Prestige the talents and passives really open up and the game becomes challenging in a good way. It's not a face-roll like say GW2.   Also the trinity system is awesome. The Support class reminds me of Protection Monks from GW1 with shields and general mitigation instead simple red-bars-up healing. This is fantastic as it still has a trinity (unlike the nonsense in GW2) but it's 'light'. For most content it's not a requirement but can make things slightly easier. How support should be in this day and age imo...  There's a good layer on depth to the skills and all the classes I've tried out are really good fun so far. A lot of originality in the designs (euro devs ftw).   The purity of the archer for example is refreshing. The knight is awesome and the Necro feels really cool. It feels strong and intimidating but not OP. The Witch is also gonna' be a sleeper hit imo. Feels a bit weird at first but the mechanics are solid. Main weapon is a broomstick which is just... Yeah. Epic.  All of that on top of being completely free to play with a good system. The resource caps, while some people find them annoying, are amazing because they completely control how pay to win the game can ever become. So essentially there isn't any at all from what I can tell. Since everything has limited growth Paying players just get there faster per-week, but they get to the same place as non-paying players...  Game is great. Simple, chilled-out, and fun so far."
MMORPG,3dh3yw,T0miii,2,Thu Jul 16 12:50:04 2015 UTC,"I think the best part about the whole ""trinity"" thing is that while you have distinct classes for each role, you can jump between them outside of fights (or in fights if you have god mode unlocked and ready)."

MMORPG,3dh3yw,tso,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:32:02 2015 UTC,Starter of the 3 doesn't matter just play the one that you think the most fun. The path to monk takes you close to archer and right by necro  so you could pick up 1 or both on the way. But the fastest way would just be ignore the other classes and go straight for it.

MMORPG,3dh3yw,xDialtone,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:06:51 2015 UTC,"Played it for month.  It was heavily promoted here in Russia, so we got bunch of hype for it. Then people noticed limits. Then people noticed that devs are rather strange with their decisions.  Basically, those limits for sparks (thingies used in FFX-like leveling) are really, really bad. Casually playing each evening for three days = hit the limits. Spending 8 hours at weekends = hit the limits.  The only thing i can suggest to future EU/US players, if you're ever to be hit by limits, drop this game for 2-3 months and then enjoy something around of 3-4 weeks of limitless game. But beware of strange balance patches. CBT had Kinetics being cool and nice. OBT had them being so-so. And then problem with oneshoting assassins and inbalanced paladins roze.  Anyway, kinda nice that some game made here is not that giberrish as usual. Seriously, never try looking into other russian MMOs. Theyre horrible. And skyforge is kinda manages to be kind of good, so yeah, give it a shot. But still beware of limits and weird balance changes."

MMORPG,3dh3yw,Plugawy_Nedznik,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:58:58 2015 UTC,"I've messed around a bit with the OB mostly out of curiosity.   For starters, the character creation is so-so. The lack of detailed facial sliders and the lack of range on a number body sliders is really limiting. Make-up is pathetic, with no way to change the details. I just couldn't make a character that I felt 100% satisfied with. I should also note that I didn't really appreciate how sexified a number of the female costumes and character designs are, but then, I am not a straight male, so I am clearly not a part of that target market.   The combat, which I can tell is basically the entire game, feels rather odd. It just doesn't have the sense of impact that a game like Blade & Soul does. You have a lot of actions, but few of them feel very 'weighty'. It's all very basic and spammy. Feels a lot like Champions Online, frankly, and that game was never particularly good in that regard either.   Character advancement looks to be extremely gated. The weekly caps are easy to hit, and not being able to pick more than three classes at the start is one of the most bizarre design decisions I've ever seen. FFXIV doesn't do this and it's got no problems retaining players, so why did they do this? It boggles the mind.   Graphics are impressive, but not for the performance. If I can't run the game smoothly with two GTX 970s at any resolution above 1080p, you probably fucked up somewhere. The game doesn't look THAT good. FFXIV shits all over it from a visuals-to-performance standpoint, quite frankly, with the only notable exception of metal shaders.   Sound effects are... okay, though it seems a bit buggy at times. Music is actually surprisingly decent, but only when they're not doing the whole bog-standard orchestral stuff (I especially liked the training room music).   Overall, it seems like a game that could be a decent time-waster if you have nothing better to do with your time. Personally, I'm unlikely to stick with it for much longer. I'll keep messing around with it to see if it clicks with me at some point, but I find that quite unlikely at this point in time."

Can boost you a few I prestige but that just moves you ahead of the instance curve, and makes it so that you only play with people who have done the same.   In essence there are 3 limiting factors, Mastery, Greatness and Proficiency. All three come from the Atlas, which can not be accelerated or circumvented. Mastery limits the amount you can raise weapon stats, greatness limits your temple ranks, and proficiency limits how good of weapons you can equip.

The design of those above mentioned MMORPGs don't cater to a swath of people like WoW does. They cater to a smaller number of people, which just isn't acceptable in today's AAA market.  It's pretty much the same as with other games really. The only reason we have a larger variety in single player gaming is because they're easier for indie studios, or splinter-studios to make because they are not as expensive as MMORPGs."

MMORPG,3dgdrn,crazyike,4,Thu Jul 16 12:28:42 2015 UTC,"Probably yes, most people will remember AC, UO, EQ, and FFXI because those games constituted a pivotal moment in the MMO genre, setting the stage for future projects and ideas (including what would become World of Warcraft).  WoW, more than any other game, is a true EQ clone (if you look at EQ in its development cycle around the time the WoW project started to really take shape).  But there's still a lot of games before those 4 you don't see people mentioning that much, and even before that.  How many people can recall the name of any MUD?  Or the first iterations of graphical multiplayer RPGs?  Think about a few of those pre-EQ/AC/UO games:  who talks about Meridian 59?  Legends of Kesmai?  Nexus: TK?  Arguably 2 of those games substantially impacted their successors:  Meridian 59 heavily influenced the design of EQ and its ultimate direction.  Nexus: TK was one of Jake Song's early games that was massively successful and was part of the origin of the ""Korean/Asian style MMO,"" he went on to develop Lineage, which a lot of people recall, and most recently ArcheAge.  Yet you here very few people mentioning those games, outside of a handful of folks who remember playing them, and the even smaller number who still do."

Asheron's Call was a great game and my favorite MMO but the monthly updates were not enough to keep even the most hardcore fans around after a couple of years.  People like constantly grinding new levels and new gear.  Personally I hate that type of model and hope that more skill based MMOs become popular as technology advances."

MMORPG,3dgdrn,PalwaJoko,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:49:41 2015 UTC,"It's tough to explain from the ground up, did you have any experience with it?  It was level based but the levels were almost secondary to the skill levels which could be leveled by using them as well as dumping exp into them. The method of choosing your specialized skills at the start was unique as well. Spells that were newer had a chance to fizzle and became more reliable as your skill grew. There were skills that you could dump exp into like run"" and ""jump"" and some other ones that added some interesting elements to the game."
MMORPG,3dgdrn,PalwaJoko,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:58:35 2015 UTC,Nah sadly. So you get exp. This exp can then be spent on particular skill sets. You can also use certain skills a lot to level them up individually?
MMORPG,3dgdrn,PalwaJoko,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:01:28 2015 UTC,"yeah, but you could also dump the exp into stats. Exp just went in this big pool and you could choose what to use it on. All of the skills were individual like UO. So you could have a weapon skill like swords and pair it with melee defense (or maybe choose item magic and buff your armor instead), but there were a lot of cool skills and builds were really varied."

MMORPG,3dgdrn,zackman986,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:14:12 2015 UTC,"The endgame was Just going to harder and harder areas and getting better stuff. There were unique items around to find to through ""quests"" but there are no actual quests in the game. You kind of just needed to know what to do. Like where they key was and how to go about a few things. Where the entrance even was.  The other thing was you could switch to PVP mode which made you always open to PVP. You could see other PVP players on the minimap and it added a really dangerous component.  There were no instanced parts of the game and the map was pretty huge.  You had to live with the choices you made if I remember right. I don't think there was a reset you could just make a new guy.  I'm sure there were optimal builds but it was more to the point of there was some was that you could be too less than optimal."
MMORPG,3dgdrn,PalwaJoko,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:35:18 2015 UTC,"Ah. Well based off what you told me and some personal research I read up about it I can see the following flaws being possible.   Too Confusing for new players. You may think it's not confusing, but the gaming community has probably more than doubled since AC was released. Wouldn't be surprised if it quadrupled. When people make a game they naturally want to try to attract as many player as possible. The old system could have been theorized as too confusing. This also could have been compiled with initial testing with volunteers to confirm this. Sometimes too many choices can be bad. I've noticed that as time goes on, MMOs are giving players less and less of choices when it comes to skills. You either unlock them all at once or they just unlock in tiers.  Too Frustrating. An issue I find with permanent choices is people get annoyed. Say you spend 5 hours investing in something then realize you made a mistake or don't like it. Perhaps 3 of those hours not contributed to something you dont want or made a mistake with. This means people felt that they wasted three hours and now become frustrated and unmotivated.  One Source. A big problem with games that do this system of having ""one"" source of exp is that players will often find the most optimal way to farm them or earn them as quick as possible. Maybe kill this area for 10 hours, then move onto this area for 5 hours, etc etc. I see it a lot. A good example of this is sZone Online. This game has a system VERY similar to AC. You earn exp, spend exp on one of the many skill sets in the game. It quickly becomes obvious that spending 10 hours in the starting town farming dogs is a lot better then moving on with the quest line and trying to level up outside. You also earn a lot more money. So by using a quest system, developers are much more easily able to control the amount of exp players are getting. That's why you see a focus on doing quests in game rather than killing when it comes to exp. AC sounds like it was the oppposite, killing/farmable stuff outside was the optimal way to level up.  The One True Form. Something I notice in these MMOs that allow users to have the ability to get a huge selection of skills is that they'll find a way to min/max what they want and what's best for the game. It may have not been as bad as it was with the original AC, but like I said. The industry changes a lot very fast. Especially now a days with the way wikis and information is online. I'm sure within a month you'd have the ""Best"" build for PvP and ""best"" build for PvE.    I mean those are my best guesses. Companies usually don't make these choices on the fly. They look at data A LOT. They'll look at other companies, they'll do user testing, they'll look at data from previous games they made. They must have saw something or a combination of data from the first AC and other games at the time that made them change it."
MMORPG,3dgdrn,zackman986,2,Thu Jul 16 04:50:29 2015 UTC,"Your points could also be turned around to identify the strengths of the game. I remember some of the hardships from when i first arrived in Dereth (the world of AC) and the steps required to overcome them. Meeting fellow players and working together to stay alive. Discussing optimal character and leveling strategies.  Because the world was so large and there were no instances, the community developed more naturally than in modern MMOs. You would see familiar faces in the towns and dungeons you frequented. There were celebrities and drama.  I've spent thousands of hours in WoW over the last decade but I've never experienced the immersion that came along with playing an early MMO with all of its crude systems and naive player-base."
MMORPG,3dgdrn,Sairo_H,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:02:39 2015 UTC,"That's true, but it's more of a question of if something will make a game successful. A game can be well made, but not make a lot of money. Which the developers never want because they live off of it.   So yeah, chances are they saw something in the data that made them think they wouldn't make a lot of money or was risky to do.   As a side note, from the what i've read/seen of AC, Pathfinder Online sounds like it may be something you players would enjoy. One Pool of exp, killing monsters mainly to gain exp, etc. So if you enjoyed AC and want to support projects designed in that manner, may think about supporting/buying games like Pathfinder Online."

You pretty much just leveled and got better gear, there were a few goals like collecting enough materials to make special armor or weapons. There were dungeons but they were more like indoor areas with more monsters. From what I remember there wasn't any way to reset xp or skills or anything, if you wanted a different build you made a new character.   Also spells required components to cast, if you burnt up a certain component you couldn't cast that spell until you bought some replacements.  A lot of things like that were difficult if you compare it to modern games, for example if you turned pvp and you died you'd drop gear, so you usually put your good stuff on a mule character (which required a friend or dropping it on the ground then logging onto a different character). Hard stuff when I think about it now but at the time I didn't think about it that way, good times."

MMORPG,3dgdrn,thoth7907,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:48:47 2015 UTC,"I loved AC as well. But if I had to criticize it, I'd say some of the systems didn't work out as planned.  For example, the spell economy. It was based on you puzzling out spell formulas and splitting a bonus, say level 6 of some creature magic ""increase stat"" was +25 and up to an additional +10 more depending on how many others had cast the spell. Problem was, everybody reverse engineered the spell formulas (e.g. SplitPea) so everyone had all levels of all the spells (that they bothered to learn). As I recall, the spell economy was removed from the game in one of the patches. After a server reboot, I remember logging in and getting a large bonus that eventually eroded down to almost nothing.  Speaking of spell formulas, that was another very cool mechanism that didn't work out as planned. Every spell cast left clues in local chat about the formula - quick who here remembers ""puish zharil?"" (ack, spelling might be off it has been a while) - but there wasn't enough variance to make the formulas unique enough. Eventually they were reversed and apps came out to do it for you (splitpea).  Burning spell components up was more annoying than anything else. On a magic user, you'd have to dedicate multiple backpacks to hold 50+ of every component. Until they added those unburnable ones (that also took up an entire backpack). I kinda remember a pea splitter (riff off the SplitPea utility) that let you buy compressed components and unwrap them as needed.  Oh yeah, dropping items on death. Annoying and the ultimate result was you just bought a bunch of arch-mage robes from the guy in Mayoi and never though about it again. Basically, a mechanism meant to enhance risk was worked around. Plus over time more and more bound items started appearing, that wouldn't drop on death, etc.  I liked how the experience system awarded a ratio for everything you did, a pool of direct xp and a pool of indirect xp you could spend on stats or whatever. The downside was this let people macro and slowly gain xp. Yeah, a level 50 char that had most their experience in something non-combat wasn't useful, but I remember a lot of mages in mana pools slowly leveling life or creature magic by buffing themselves repeatedly.  I guess that's another minor issue - not all skills were equally useful. It was cool there weren't any classes and you could design you char however you wanted (I had a ""samurai"" no-magic archer/sword char that was fun to play; I fletched all my own elemental arrows, etc.) but the reality was some skills were must-have: item magic (for portal spells), mana conservation (for any magic user), melee defense (any melee/ranged combat and arguably even magic users), life magic (for the prot spells alone), well its been a while I remember needing more but can't remember.  Overall though, I have really good memories of my times in AC. Back when nobody took item magic (didn't realize how useful portal recall was) it was high adventure to hit a dungeon and realize you just had to stay alive. Doing that one staff quest was super fun and I helped a ton of people get it (Impious Staff?). Having lockpick before they took that door out of the subway was great too - I'd show up and see a dozen chars running against the door hoping to lag through, and I'd say ""hey I've got lockpick I'll open it up"". Hehe good times!  I will say that as one of the earliest games in the genre, all of the above systems were innovative. It's always hard to predict how the design will fare when players start interacting with it."
MMORPG,3dgdrn,Zantitrach,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:28:05 2015 UTC,I think a lot of these systems were rather creative but ultimately the power creep present in all MMOs resulted in more annoyances than anything else.   I think the largest issue with the game was mismanagement and the almost nonexistent enforcement of banning for combat macroing.  Once UCM became the norm there was a division between the haves and have-nots.
MMORPG,3dgdrn,PanPsor,2,Thu Jul 16 17:49:01 2015 UTC,Yeah you're right about the macroing!

MMORPG,3dj5y6,Micro2Cuts,2,Thu Jul 16 19:22:18 2015 UTC,"I hear it's nice starting out but gets shitty when you hit veteran ranks, or so I hear. Let me know if I'm out of the loop because I only played beta. I've never had any bad first hand impressions of the game besides bugs which are more or less gone, but I don't see a lot of input in regards to endgame and have yet to hear anything good about it."
MMORPG,3dj5y6,SupaStaVince,2,Thu Jul 16 21:52:51 2015 UTC,"The Veteran Ranks are... weird. A lot of the problems from it stems from the 'endgame blue balls' it gives. The time it takes to get to max Veteran Rank is only ~8 days play time and there is enough game content to always have a quest to do, so it's not overly long or grindy (grind in the sense of having to only kill mobs to progress because content ran out).  One problem is PvP based. Before Veteran Ranks you can join the Pre-Vet campaign which is an extremely balanced campaign because the game scales all players to the same level, it's a wonderful experience especially with new players. Once you hit VR1 though, you get booted from that campaign and have to join the big boy campaign where you now fight against people who are min maxed experts at the game with serious statistical advantages.  Another is just the elongated experience it is. 1-50 is really quick, like 2 days play time. When you get to 50 it's like ""Oh, time for me to participate in endgame!"" and really, you can't. In fact you're barely half way. The reward structure slows down to a stand still because now each veteran rank is the equivalent of ~7 normal levels.  If you go into it with the mindset of expecting that, it's not too bad. You have to think of the game really as 1-65 with the last 15 levels being a doosey. It's still quicker to level up than it would have been in something like Vanilla WoW."
MMORPG,3dj5y6,Zienth,-1,Fri Jul 17 15:05:30 2015 UTC,"The whole questing is the best part of the game imo.   PvE end game is doing small timed raids, they are really short and simple compared to WoW raid and doesn't really drop anything. PvP end game is Cyrodil, the big open pvp map. Usually it's full zergs tho it can be fun. On PC the factions are fairly unbalanced, with last time i played DC was far smaller, EP was the most numerous and AD was close to ep in numbers but more skilled.   The progression, once you reach max level, is the champions points. Everything slowly give them in veteran levels. They are basically extra stats in whatever you want, the issue arise when people grind them like crazy in some specific pve spot (pve aoe grind is by fast the most efficient, doing pvp/questing/dungeons isn't). While there is a diminishing return it's not enough, some people are so far ahead that it will never be possible for non-grinder to catch up before the end cap which will take years to hit for them. When the only end-game is either a timed dps race or PvP, those bonus feel really cheap in a game that was till now mostly skill based, not stats based."

But really, it wasn't ever apart of the original lore."

Blizzard may have been riding on the popularity of Kung Fu Panda when they decided to do MoP as an expansion, but Pandaren have existed in Warcraft since before WoW launched."
MMORPG,3dkvg5,MadBlue,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:55:21 2015 UTC,"I'm only refuting their origin being based on any original lore, and if anything based off a joke that never intended to be lore - but then shoed-in and expanded upon to help ease the eastern market because of politics. --Just don't tell me they were the most requested race compared to others like the Ethereals, Naga, Ogres, Furbolgs, High Elves, or even (lol) Murlocs.  Really, I've got no beef with the Pandas, but in WoW's case it was pretty obvious as to why they were actually doing it."
MMORPG,3dkvg5,Windows9000,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:16:58 2015 UTC,"To be fair, all of those ""most requested races"" have (or lack) features that make it very unlikely for Blizzard to chose any of them as player races.   According to the Wiki, there was speculation that Pandaren were going to be a new Alliance race for Burning Crusade, so people anticipating having them as a playable race predates MoP by a good 5 or 6 years.   As for the ""why,"" there's certainly enough overlap in the interest in Western fantasy and Asian fantasy in the Western gamer population to make an Asian-themed expansion a draw. I mean, look at how many Western gamers also like anime or Asian-influenced Western animation like Avatar. That's not to say that sales in China weren't an influence, but I don't think that's the end-all and be-all of why Blizzard made MoP."

Blizzard certainly didn't make it to improve their relationship with the bloody CPC. Around the time development for MoP got going, popular culture was having fun with tacky kung fu clichés. Look at Western releases like The Forbidden Kingdom, Kung Fu Panda, Mini Ninjas, The Karate Kid (2010) etc. So they decided to revive their old panda-idea. You only need to look at the visual style to see that MoP was catering more to Western audiences than Asian. The problem was that Blizzard miscalculated. Seems most players didn't want to see that. Plus the Pandaren design generally looks off. That's all."
MMORPG,3dkvg5,Autumnplay,0,Fri Jul 17 09:07:46 2015 UTC,"WoW's had huge political/cultural/economical hurdles in China over the years, despite having around 5million Chinese subscribers (that was a link from 2010) - they're a massive chunk of the population and revenue for Blizz, I'm fairly sure they'd like to appease them (this is WarCraft, after all) from any other potential, likely Asian, candidates."
MMORPG,3dkvg5,Windows9000,2,Fri Jul 17 10:20:19 2015 UTC,"Lol - appeasement implies that they have been somehow angered or unsettled.  Blizzard: ""Oh God, Henry! We have angered the Chinese!""

Henry: ""One thing I have learnt over the years is that no one stays angry at teddy bears...""  MISTAKE #1.  I realise what a huge chunk of their players come from China, but I can't think that MoP was only aimed at them. I mean, have you seen it?

I'd argue that this is at least partially because we're male, and see beyond the ""hips and bewbies"" effect of female characters.  Edit: Man, I really worded that terribly. Let me try again.  The straight males among us look differently upon a male character, because there is zero sexual interest in what we see. When we look at a female character, we tend to look at the features we find attractive. This sways our opinion significantly.  And before you get your pitchforks out claiming that ""it's just a video game, there is nothing sexual about moving pixels"", think about it this way: when you see a real person, or a picture thereof, there's nothing left to imagination. You see what there is, and that's it. He/she is either hot or not.  When you see a stylized representation of a human, the ""gaps"" are filled in by your imagination, predominantly pulling from what you'd find attractive in those gaps. It's a bit like ""book is better than the movie"" effect. Since you can't see anything when reading the book, you imagine it. And you tend to imagine stuff you'd like to see.  Wall of text. Jesus."

Generally speaking, I'm one of those guys that plays primarily female characters. My reasoning is a variety of things (gear looks better, better character customizations, etc), but the primary reason is that I'm not really interested in being in the story; I just want to watch it (like an interactive movie). My character is not me, they're just a character in a story that I am consuming, but that doesn't mean I don't connect with them.   It fascinates me that some people have to play a virtual representation of themselves in order to connect with the character.

If I were to create a female character and spruce her up in a way that maybe looks more appealing to me, I'd feel completely out of touch with the character that is essentially representing me in the world.

You don't have to play it like a zombie just because others say it is a good game and you'll like the game at the end, some ppl don't care and others do care about those aspects; what is stupid is to say that he ""can't understand that kind of thinking""(like the guy I answered), I can write a lot more but srsly everything is really subjective and stupid ppl like the one I answered give the worst reasons to play a game."
MMORPG,3df72v,Snoozeypoo,4,Thu Jul 16 05:56:00 2015 UTC,I think your missing the point of his reply or I'm misunderstanding. He was merely saying that easy for not playing a game because of the class being gender locked does not make sense for path of exile. The class pretty much does not matter he could select another class and have the exact same play style mostly. Just a few percents of efficiency off that you wont notice as a casual player.   I agree if you don't like it don't play it but path of Exile the class does not matter much so retrying the game may not be a bad option if that's the only reason you did not like it

I'm a gay male but there aren't a lot of cool or attractive male character models in a lot of the MMOs I've played, so I tend to stick with females. They end up with cooler animations sometimes, almost always they have better hair (the #1 thing I'm gonna be looking at usually) and I feel like male voice actors sometimes end up sounding too over-the-top or cheesy.  I don't like gender locked classes because it's lazy, but overall I don't care too much. If a class sounds really cool and fun to play, I'll try it out even if I have to play it as a smurf or something."

Maybe in a single-player game where you are playing out the character's story, and it's already on rails or something. But when you're carving the story yourself, it is much more immersive, and there's a huge disconnect for me."
MMORPG,3df72v,screampuff,2,Thu Jul 16 00:24:56 2015 UTC,"I don't imagine myself as my character, instead I think of it more as a character that I'm creating the story for, kind of like a comic book, story, movie or TV show where I get to decide what happens, so I don't mind playing male or female.  I'm actually playing TERA and I find it a little hard to play male or female though simply because of how sexualized the characters are. I'm actually playing Elin with my gf, even they are sexualized but you don't need to dress them that way, I find it kind of funny and cute that we're little Elins.  AFAIK the reasoning for TERA is that they're choosing the most popular race/gender combos and making classes for them because without needing to make animations for all genders and races they can pump out new classes at a much faster race. In the past year they've added the Reaper and the gunnner, and in a few months we will be getting the brawler. Do you know any other game with this polish that pumps out new classes this fast? It's a trade-off and IMO is worth it.  I'm not a fan of the Castanic or High Elf female but still wouldn't be against making one if the class was fun, it's just something different from what I'm used to and I'd have to make up a story or something for them. In some ways it can be good because it might get me to play a race/gender combo I wouldn't have otherwise tried."
MMORPG,3df72v,DrFrankensteinx,2,Thu Jul 16 04:17:39 2015 UTC,I felt the same when I started noticing I was only playing mmo's with good paladin classes. Specially after Lineage2.
MMORPG,3df72v,Zeydon,2,Thu Jul 16 16:56:20 2015 UTC,"I can understand where you're coming from.  But TERA seems like the exception to the rule to me.  Most people just play females in that game.  Elin are everywhere, and I'd consider it an unofficial rite of passage to roll one.  Between over-the-top cutesy Elin ,over-the-top boobsy other females, and over-the-top roided-out men, the roided-out men lose.  Yes, I play only male in other MMOs; yes I played mostly females in TERA, after the first month or so anyhow.  Anyhow, here's the reason why they have these sex restricted classes: they're new and it takes a lot of man-power to design those animations.  Skill animations are unique for every class-race-gender combo, so there's a lot of work involved.  Skill animations are a lot more elaborate than in games like WoW.  And an Elin Warrior's Backflip is completely different from a Female Castanic's Backflip.  As such, for the new classes they picked popular races/genders.  The new classes may have more racial gender options in the future, though I dunno when that would be."

Playing a female character in Tera is no different to playing one in Tomb Raider, Remember Me, or Beyond Good and Evil- especially when the narrative elements push them to do things that I personally wouldn't.   First person games where I am in the world, as opposed to watching it, and I have full agency- then I'll play as me, a male."
MMORPG,3df72v,caelumsixsmith,3,Thu Jul 16 17:43:10 2015 UTC,"I also feel the same way and I think it's perfectly normal. One of the reasons I gave up on C9 (aside the fact that I didn't like the gameplay a single bit) is because it has gender locked classes and the character models are terrible. If a game doesn't let me rebuild my twink body on its virtual environment, I stop feeling the immersion. I also want to feel like I'm in that world, like I'm a part of that place and I couldn't feel that way playing as a woman cos I'm not a woman. Nothing sexist about that. Is not our fault that we were born male and that we like to be ourselves in that game world. I guess that's why I never left PSO2 :/  Nothing against those guys who play as female characters, but ""I don't wanna stare at a guy's butt"" is the most ridiculous thing anyone could say. I don't think they know how stupid they sound when saying this -- and I think I just offended a bunch of people."

I absolutely hate games that over sexualize females. Fucking hate them. I tolerated it with Tera because the action was decent enough but once the female only classes came into play, the game started to go to shit. Playing as a female is fine if done tastefully, but their armor is intentionally lacking for the purpose of eye candy for horny gamers. I find it to be weird and it detracts from the overall experience for me."

Nothing looks better than a how woman kicking people's ass... except a terrifically horrible monster ripping people apart but we don't get to play those often.  Male characters just seem to walk either effeminate or super macho which is only a massive distraction for me.  I have kept subscriptions to games just because I liked the look of my characters.

I'm male and I play both male and female characters (roughly half and half), and I've had mains of both sexes. I don't have any specific archetype (for example warrior males and caster females), but I do have some character concepts/names that I recycle in different games, so I often create characters that are similar to characters I've created in other games. I also never take ""MadBlue"" as a character name (unless all characters are associated with that name, like playing a multiplayer FPS). It's my online persona, and my characters are just characters.  There is an aesthetic factor to my character choices though. I don't really like the scowling faces and bulky bodies that are often the default male character choices in many MMOs, so if the only male models are hulking slabs of meat with gorilla hands and a constant war-face, I'm probably not going to make a male character.  In any case, I really don't spend enough time staring at my character's ass for that to be a factor."

NO OPTIONS FOR YOU! And I don't mean the typical ""Bad Guy"" look either with this you often get at MMORPGs. It's a dilemma.

Regardless, they've also said that making animations for all characters took too much time and money but next class they'll try and make it to have all characters made available.   Good on them, but they've already compromised their integrity. I understand that companies can only survive when they're making money, but if you ask them how much time they spent on modeling all the undergarments for the female races, when they could have at least added a male version to those gender/race locked classes...they're just catering to a bunch of horny people.   Another note, only two classes are currently gender locked but that doesn't mean anything.   Well, the Brawler is also gender/race locked.

While yes, males and females have mostly physical differences, they also have some mental ones, but most of both are fairly minor, and I'm not into super in-depth roleplaying for that to matter. It's not like (most) MMOs have any gameplay that would actually use those major physical differences. Overall, I'd say my character's gender choice mostly comes down to which one I can identify with more, and that varies from game to game. I'd be lying if I said it's not more visually appealing to look at a female, but I'm never sexually attracted to them. (I do sometimes squee at how cute they are though.) Aside from the longer hair and huge boobies (which can both be avoided in better character customizations') I'd say I more often than not resemble a female than one of those males with oversized muscles. I'd totally pick one of those bishōnen characters though. Too bad they're rarely present.  I guess what I'd like you to take away from this though is that...

My gender and my looks are a very insignificant part of me.     (Also, a thing I do in MMOs when questioned about my actual gender, is ask them why it matters, tell them I'm actually made from bottle caps, and if I happen to have like an hour of conversation or a few hours of playing together with them just after, with them not further asking what my gender is, I ask them again, if they care to know. If they really do, I tell them. I do expect people to refer to me by my character's gender though if they do not know me.)"

For me it's not so much the actual act of using the gamepad as an input device, it's the freedom that a gamepad gives me in regards to where I can play.  When I was younger I used to be quite content hovering over my keyboard playing games but as I got older, acquired a family, and found myself sitting behind a computer all day at work I can appreciate the freedom to sit on my couch and play.  Tera and FFXIV play fantastic with a gamepad, dungeons included, because gamepad usage was taken into consideration from the beginning.  Now I don't particularly like Tera or FFXIV but I think they do a good demonstration of MMOs and gamepads done right.  That being said, I can appreciate the control a traditional keyboard/mouse setup can give you, but only because that's they way most games were designed to be interacted with.  I definitely don't feel like an inferior gamer because I prefer a gamepad, just a more comfortable one.  edit: grammar, sentence structure"

Outside of regular wireless kb+m, there's that Keyboard and Mousepad combo that Razer has started coming out with (can't remember the name of it now).  So while I get the whole wanting to be away from a desk mentality, the solution to that is no longer the controller only.  I mean I'm not trying to persuade you to go to kb+m.

I thought that KB+M was almost always better and where that failed a proper Fightstick or HOTAS setup could take over. It's not that I actually hated gamepads, I just thought they were useless crap for anything that wasn't a platformer.    Out of curiosity I tried to play FFXIV with a pad once because I couldn't imagine that some players were actually playing the game with that. To my surprise it was actually quite enjoyable and it did indeed change my perception about gamepads used in complex games. I still wouldn't use it for actionfilled group encounters where KB+M can't really be beaten, but for lazy laid-back solo questing while watching TV on the 2nd screen the pad was just perfect."
MMORPG,3dge2t,Alagos77,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:51:15 2015 UTC,"KBM: More bindable keys and quick responsive and precise inputs for camera based mobility and actions that require fast camera input like quickly changing direction while wall running in Titanfall. You also have the freedom of clicking on things, better UI control, and keyboard shortcuts.  Gamepad: Analog over WASD for better movement, but you lose out on the boon of having both fast turning speed and precision accuracy on KBM where as on gamepad you can only have one. In most MMOs, you will often need multiple inputs for a single command. You are at the mercy of the game's target cycling system, harder UI control, and less shortcuts. Also, ground targeting AoE is especially difficult on gamepad at times."

My whole gaming life I've felt more comfortable and immersed in a game if I can play on the big screen with a controller.   Hoping the steam controller (or something like that) is the answer.
MMORPG,3dge2t,Xardos1976,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:33:37 2015 UTC,"Well... The problem with them is that developers can't optimize their games for both. I play mostly with a controller (everything, really) and I noticed games like FFXIV and PSO2 tried to optimize controllers the most. TERA, on the other hand, was optimized for keyboard and mouse, something that made me hate the controller support.   In the long run that shouldn't be a reason for some people to say ""play with a keyboard, MMOs weren't meant to be played with a controller and if you do that, you're stupid"". If that's the case, then MMOs weren't meant to be on consoles either... And FPSs should be played on PC only, cos using a keyboard on a console? Nope, that's unacceptable.  If someone likes the game enough, they can get over poor kb/m optimization, as well as poor controller optimization if that's the case. We are always getting over something we don't like on a game we love and we get used to some gameplay flaw, so it's quite futile to say you wish the game was optimized for you as if the developers had an obligation with you. The fact that some of them give us the choice to play with kb/m or a controller (even though the optimization always favors one side more than the other) should be a reason to celebrate, not to call those who don't share your opinions stupid. In the end what matters is that the player is comfortable with their choice of control, not what others think they should be playing with."

MMORPG,3df19k,CakewalkGlasgow,13,Wed Jul 15 19:32:47 2015 UTC,"The game is great but it isn't for everyone. Chances are if you don't enjoy it early on then it's just not the game for you.  Now I acknowledge that this subreddit is mostly for people that are disillusioned with MMOs and aren't really looking for a new one to play. I've been playing MMOs for 20 years and people here tend to ask for things that have never really been part of the MMO model to begin with. That's ok, there's plenty of variety out there in gaming, it's just about finding what's right for you.   Most of the excuses people make for the success of FFXIV are a little bit parochial and come from a place of ignorance about the game. Some people say the Final Fantasy brand saved the game, yet that didn't really work well enough for FFXIV 1.0, SWTOR, Star Trek Online, LOTRO, or ESO. Most of these games are great, but they couldn't sustain subscription models for various reasons.  People also assume the game is small in the West, that it's somehow mainly an ""Asian"" game. First of all, the game is very western in design. It borrows a lot from WoW and other popular western games. It's very accessible and doesn't have much mandatory grinding at all. The combined European and North American population of the game is much larger than the Japanese part.  In my mind the game has achieved a high level of success due to the fact that it receives an incredible amount of support from its developers. The game is extremely polished: the levelling experience is varied, the graphics are beautiful, the boss fights are epic, and the attention to detail is tremendous. But the thing that really seals the deal is post-launch support. Not only did the developers rebuild the game from the ground up when creating 2.0 while still supplying us with regular updates to 1.0, but they've been releasing massive patches consistently for the past 2 years.   Each patch dwarves the content released for any other game and the quality is maintained. The game released with 14 dungeons and before the expansion it had 31. It had 5 unique trial fights at launch and by patch 2.55 it had 15. It also released 3 casual raids, 2 new hardcore raids, housing, PvP, the Gold Saucer (with a card game and racing), a new class and a host of new systems in regular patches. This isn’t even considering what was added in the expansion. If you enjoy the game then they sure put the effort in to give you new things to enjoy on a regular basis.   This is a game that knows what it wants to accomplish and does a heck of a job delivering it to its players. The hype train never really slows down for people who enjoy FFXIV since there’s always a major patch around the corner promising great new things. We know that this will be a game that will be supported for years and years to come and that gets us excited. Right now I’m looking forward to a Savage mode raid, a new PvP map and mode, 2 brand new dungeons, new story, new trial bosses, Airship endgame content that will let us board the airships our guilds have constructed and hunt monsters in a new endgame zone, a new casual 24-man raid, a snowboarding minigame, PvP seasonal rankings, and on and on…. All of these things are planned to be released in the next 2-3 months."

Not to mention the story doesn't start to get interesting until you hit about level 45.   I agree with everything else you've said."

MMORPG,3df19k,Writer_Man,13,Fri Jul 17 03:44:29 2015 UTC,I think this sub makes FFXIV seem like a bigger game than it really is. Its doing well but its not like it reinvented the MMO genre or anything.

The start is really ... slow."

You don't have to reinvent the genre to make a good enjoyable game, sometimes it's enough to take working methods and improve them and to remove those that are annoying.    I usually try to avoid PvE games because I tire of them pretty fast, but FFXIV had me engaged far longer than I expected. Can't really say why exactly but the game just felt right. Nice art, nice controls, nice encounters, nice classes and a story that didn't annoy the crap out of me most of the time. Everything just fit well together and made the game a pleasant experience.     The word 'polished' I've read from others here actually describes it pretty well. That and it isn't one of those F2P P2W 'let me annoy you on every step you take until you spend some money'-games."

It's rare for MMOs to actually be innovative - and how can they be when all they see is the success WoW had with copying existing games and then just improve and remove a few mechanics. I blame WoW for a decade of dumbed down generic MMOs but that game is out for almost 11 years now. Don't have the energy to stay angry that long.    Besides, with the success they had, who am I to say that they did something wrong? Most players apparently liked it - just like I liked to play FFXIV till PvE got too boring."
MMORPG,3df19k,Alagos77,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:31:06 2015 UTC,"People don't like huge changes and developers need to realize this. Changes have to be slow and not centralized.  The armoury system, the crafting system...these are amazing features but they don't ""sell"" the game. Instead they are just PART of the game.  The downside is that it doesn't have an amazing feature to showcase, but the upside is that it is this that had them create a solid MMORPG. People familiar with the WoW generation have a higher chance of sticking because they don't feel like they are getting one cool feature and a bunch of lackluster features, instead they are getting a bunch of solid, familiar features with little new things (like playing all of the classes on one character, indepth crafting system) to hold their interest when they become interested."

MMORPG,3df19k,Cyrotek,-5,Thu Jul 16 12:35:43 2015 UTC,Are you trying to say that FFXIV has more side content than WoW? The fanboyism is too strong in this sub. WoW has ten years worth of side content: Name me things FFXIV has that wow does not and I will name things that WoW has including QOL things that FFXIV does not.
MMORPG,3df19k,jayrocs,2,Thu Jul 16 15:16:38 2015 UTC,"I think you are not exactly aware about what ""side content"" is.  FFXIV:  Crafting (yes, i count that as content because it actually is useful, fun and you can play as crafter only if you wish)  Chocobo Races  Triple Triad  Gold Saucer  Also FFXIV does not make everything useless as soon as an addon hits, unlike WoW. This means it has actually 20+ dungeons and over 10 trials which are still useful at the start of the recent addon. WoW might have 10 years worth of content, yet no one does everything because it is pointless."
MMORPG,3df19k,Cyrotek,-5,Thu Jul 16 18:00:03 2015 UTC,"I don't agree - but you are right that FFXIV does help out a lot with duty roulette keeping old content relevant. But, the duty roulette is still just a daily chore you must do that benefits new players more than it benefits yourself.  As far as side content goes - if you're going to call a casino and card game content then what about Pet battles, pet and mount collection, rare hunting, and PvP? Let's not forget that people actually get to PvP in wow which is enough content for most people to keep subbing even at it's worse state right now.  So let's get to the relevant dungeons part: Mythic dungeons just got released and time walker dungeons and raids as well. WoW also has more boss battles per raid than ffxiv by a LOT. I think the current trend is 4 bosses per 6 months for ffxiv while WoW releases a raid with 13 bosses off the bat? I love raiding so this is more important to me than side content btw. Also loot lock for all raids that isn't mythic is a plus because I can keep running the raids almost as much as I want without this fake barrier in the way to prevent me from playing.  Look I get it, we have different opinions and I'm in the ffxiv sub (I know this is /r/mmorpg but FFXIV is god here so its just an expansion of the ffxiv sub to me). Wow is old and ffxiv is newer but let's not go around saying that WoW doesn't have side content or impressive boss battles - yeah ffxiv is flashy but are the fights harder? Do they include brand new mechanics that raid bosses in wow never used? I don't think so.   I've tried to get into FFXIV before and I'm willing to give it a second chance later because my friends tell me the end game is better than the sluggish 1-50 but the community here just seems like a bunch of brain washed kids who drank too much of the kool aid."
MMORPG,3df19k,jayrocs,2,Thu Jul 16 18:44:01 2015 UTC,"If your counting mount collection, rare hunting, pvp, etc. side content, then you have to count the same things for FFXIV also. The only thing that sets WoW truly apart is its pet battles. But thats it.  FFXIV does actually have around 30 raid boss battles in a Realm Reborn (7 Ex Primals plus several easier trials, 3 Coils with up to 4 bosses each and 3 24 man casual raids with over 10 bosses together) and got seven (plus six hard modes) in Heavensward at the moment.  Why should FFXIV contain mechanics WoWs bosses never used? I do not get that point at all, sorry. FFXIV never wanted to be ""different"" when it comes to mechanics and it is not its sales pitch to be unique.  FFXIV is not harder as WoW as WoW is not harder than FFXIV. As one who cleared Classic and BC i would say that the hardest content in ARR was maybe on the level of the last parts of AQ40 and around half of Naxxramas if you do not count the needed grinding for stuff like resistance gear and flasks.  The thing is, FFXIV IS actually good. It is not like just its troll army went over here to annoy everyone with a different opinion. Those people are actually surprised as how good this game gets after a while. Like i was surprised even after i told myself never to touch an themepark MMO anymore at all.  Of course it still comes down to taste, but i think you get my point."
MMORPG,3df19k,Cyrotek,-1,Thu Jul 16 20:05:06 2015 UTC,I'll try the game out again soon and maybe the combat won't turn me off as much this time. I really need to see how amazing this game is with the abundance of people like you who praise it so much.  That's not a bad thing and I'm being serious since I've run out of things to do in Wildstar and WoW except for raiding.
MMORPG,3df19k,jayrocs,2,Thu Jul 16 20:09:36 2015 UTC,"What i said, it comes down to taste. I can only recommend to give it a try and not be turned of by the combat immediately.

MMORPG,3df19k,MrNotSoNiceGuy,2,Thu Jul 16 08:42:51 2015 UTC,"Here's my issues with making a separate character for each class.   Managing inventory across lots of characters is a chore. The story is fun to go through the first time, okay the second time, nostalgic the third time, and the fourth time you're saving a certain village from a certain monster it's just a chore. If you party with someone who is cool and add them to the friends list, but you each have 10 alts, there's only a 1% chance you're on the same character pair that has a friendship.   So you can be leveling up some class like ninja or black mage, and someone you know says ""Hey, we need a tank for this dungeon"" which you want to do, so you just change class to your marauder and off you go. No need to hop characters."
MMORPG,3df19k,securitywyrm,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:53:30 2015 UTC,To be fair atleast with WoW you get to do lots of quests when leveling. In FFXIV it is mostly fate and dungeon grinding after you have leveled up 2 or more characters. In that sense I highly prefer Wow's system with basically 3 classes of FFXIV in one (specializations allow for a lot of diversity still). It's all down to preference but I really dislike grinding in any way outside of quests.
MMORPG,3df19k,SirDutchie,5,Fri Jul 17 16:56:59 2015 UTC,"At first I wasn't sure if FFXIV was going to be worth it to me.  The first few levels just killing little mobs and never fighting any 'humanoid' mobs put me off, but you have to get into the FFXIV groove.  If you do, you'll quickly grow to love it.  If you complain about quests and faits and combat, well, it's probably just not the game for you.  Many people hate WoW with a passion, but that doesn't mean it's not a fantastic game for those who play it."
MMORPG,3df19k,NonBritGit,6,Wed Jul 15 22:53:04 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way but apparently end game is very good. I also didn't make it though and gave up around level 43. The combat even as a DPS/Ninja was so slow and boring I logged in one day and just couldn't take it anymore. And the constant zoning/loading screens was also a big turn off.  I ended up moving to Wildstar and loved it - combat is action based, the world was more open, but the population is extremely small. Hopefully F2P fixes that but this game really forces you to actively search for members through chat channels and join a guild. I guess in the end it's the same with both games though - make it to end game and the whole game opens up. For FFXIV that will be the challenge/faster combat which I doubt but people say it does and for Wildstar the whole population is at 50 while leveling 1-50 is lonely."
MMORPG,3df19k,jayrocs,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:50:37 2015 UTC,"The thing with the faster combat consists of multiple off-GCD abilities and sometimes also haste effects (Ninja for example gets a big speed boost at level 45). These are - sadly - lacking in the levelling process, making it feel sluggish. Endgame is further quickened by skill and spell speed on gear.  Personally I don't notice the GCD anymore. The incorporation of off-GCD skills and attention to boss mechanics makes me glad it's not any lower, especially in consideration of the console players."
MMORPG,3df19k,Saibanchou,2,Thu Jul 16 09:38:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah. As a level 60 Dark Knight I get shocked every time I am synced below 50 and the pace goes from hyper-stress to just 1-2-3-1-2-3.

It's not the perfect game, it may not appeal to you, it has its ups and downs as a game like every other game out there, but there are a lot of people who enjoy it, enough to make it a huge success.  And to your last question, FFXIV isn't the first polished MMO we've had in years, it is the most polished MMO we've had in years. Everything in the game just screams polish and care, even if the gameplay elements aren't for you you have to admit that the game is very well put together."
MMORPG,3df19k,lmaonade200,6,Wed Jul 15 22:53:22 2015 UTC,"and having to experience a dozen loading screens whilst running through the starting City was just painful and cheap feeling.   Can we stop with the stupid separated zone hyperbole when every city has only two sections to it? The reason it feels cheap is because it is, though. It's instanced due to PS3 support. The game has a number of issues that can all fall on supporting PS3. Fortunately they don't plan to continue doing so for very long. Possibly as early as 4.0.  As for the zones, Heavensward's are enormous. Probably the largest I've seen in a lot of MMOs. I don't know why people complain about the ARR maps though. They're not huge but they're still fairly sizable and take a good amount of time to run across.   It's not a perfect game. I wish there was more horizontal gear progression and more Job customization, but the GCD is just fine, especially when you hit mid-to-high levels. With the amount of skills any given class gets and how many are not on the GCD, the game would just be a button masher were the GCD any faster.  Anyway, everyone makes a fuss about it because it's an outstanding game despite the few flaws. The story is as good as any mainstream Final Fantasy title and Soken is probably the first worthy composer to follow in Uematsu's footsteps. I've never really liked Hamauzu or Sakimoto's contributions to the series' soundtracks, but Soken has been consistently knocking it out of the park.   The big thing compared to 99% of new MMOs though is simple: It has things to do. You play TERA or Guild Wars 2 or pretty much any game out there besides WoW and you're met with the following:   Level to Cap. Grind dungeons.   That's it. It's hard to stay drawn into a game when, upon hitting cap, you're basically limited to doing nothing but the same content--and for little reason, given the slow pace of major content updates.  Compare this to FFXIV--Every 3 months gets players an enormous new content patch, containing QoL changes, 3-5 hours of new storyline, a new raid tier, several new dungeons, often a new Primal, new housing furniture, new areas like Gold Saucer, new character customization options, etc.  On top of that, the game itself lets you run dungeons, primals, raid, hunt for titles or minions or achievements or mounts, garden, fish, work on crafting and gathering, work on Relic weapon progress, fool around in areas like Gold Saucer, work on Challenge Log weekly, fill out your Sightseeing Log, hunt for Triple Triad cards, decorate your house, PvP...  There's a mindboggling amount of content in FFXIV and more keeps coming at a ridiculous pace. That, and the fact it's polished content, is why it's getting critical and player acclaim, and why three years in it's the only still-surviving traditional subscription MMO, WoW aside."
MMORPG,3df19k,AvalonBright,2,Wed Jul 15 22:58:33 2015 UTC,Your post is on point but let me clarify something. The separation of zones is not because of ps3 limitations. The director yoshi p has stated time and time again that the ARR zone were built that way to give every location meaning rather than large copy pasted zones like they had in 1.0.
MMORPG,3df19k,SaveTheSunF1R3x,3,Thu Jul 16 05:19:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. Also it has more to do with server stability and experience on low end machines in general, not just the PS3. The main cities are designed in a way as to constantly have lots of people in them. Even now in the expansion lots of people still hang out there.   Back when Second Coil of Bahamut was still not available in the duty finder and they released the Ixali Daily quests (not to mention when Odin popped in the same zone) Yoshi-P mentioned that they would avoid putting too many things as popular as those two in one zone in the future. When there were hundreds or thousands of players in the same place there was noticeably slow down in the zone, especially for people on lower end machines. The starting cities are designed to accommodate thousands of players at once."
MMORPG,3df19k,Steftiffe,2,Thu Jul 16 09:55:44 2015 UTC,"Because it's a MMORPG done right. There is no MMO right now i'd rather play than FFXIV. As a raider, I feel like it is the best possible option right now. It isn't innovative or original but it gets the job done better than any other PvE oriented MMO in the market right now. Thats why a lot of people play it and love it."
MMORPG,3df19k,RektoKyoma,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:45:55 2015 UTC,How is raiding compared to WoW? I want to know more about how the raid lockouts work - is it based on loot lockouts like WoW except for the highest difficulty (mythic) which is still instance lockout with your guild?  Do people pug the first tier of the raid and does it maintain it's challenge while running through? I was considering giving FFXIV another chance since I stopped at level 43 but what's really important to me is that at max level I have the ability to raid and run content that matters as much as I want. Hard dungeons and hard raids (puggable or locked with guild but repeatable).
MMORPG,3df19k,jayrocs,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:19:33 2015 UTC,"In terms of lockouts it's fairly similar to WoW. The way endgame progression works is as follows:   When you reach level 60 you'll run a set of endgame dungeons for gear drops and currency (3 that award currency, 2 of which also drop gear). The gear drops are i160 and the currency can be used to buy i170 gear. Using the duty roulette system there are potentially 39 dungeons that are worth doing for currency. There is no weekly cap on the current ""Law"" currency. Upgrading your gear to i180 currently requires doing some Hunts which is basically tracking down certain monsters in the open world for Hunt currency. There's no weekly cap on Hunt currency. There are daily and weekly hunts that are easy to complete solo and more difficult hunts that require larger groups of players to kill. They've said that they'll be introducing several alternative ways to earn i180 upgrade items in the near future. The Extreme versions of the primals Bismarck and Ravana offer i175 and i190 weapons respectively. These are one off boss fights that can offer a decent challenge. They can be run as often as you like and will always drop 1 weapon and a token for each member of the party. 10 tokens can be used to purchase a weapon of your choice. Alexander (Normal) is the first true raid in the expansion. It consists of 4 floors, each with a boss that drops 2 gear tokens for i190 gear. The difficulty is fairly low and most floors can be pugged without too many problems. You can enter as much as you like, but there is a loot restriction for each floor. Once you've won a lot for a gear token you are unable to lot again on that floor for the rest of the week.   On Tuesday we're set to receive a new currency (Esoterics) with a weekly cap and Alexander (Savage). Savage is where the highest raiding difficulty is at and each floor will drop 2 pieces of gear to the common loot pool as well as a token for each member of the party. Once you've completed a Savage floor you are ineligible to receive loot there for the rest of the week, regardless of whether you actually lotted for anything. You are however able to enter again to help others with a slight penalty. If there are one to four players in your party replaying a turn, only a single piece of loot will drop. If there are five to seven players in your party replaying a turn, no loot will drop. Everyone will still get their tokens though.  In 8-10 weeks in patch 3.1 we'll also be getting 2 new dungeons with better gear drops and at least 1 new Extreme primal. We're also getting a casual 24-man raid; these have awarded catch-up gear in the past, but we don't know how this will work in the expansion as almost the entire progression system has been adjusted in some way. There's a new type of endgame system they'll be introducing in patch 3.1 as well which will let us fly our guild-constructed airships out into an endgame zone to fight bosses. We don't really know where this will fit into progression yet, but they've said it will be major endgame content."
MMORPG,3df19k,Steftiffe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:40:57 2015 UTC,Very interesting. I want to pick up a second game to casually raid in and I'm leaning on giving this a shot versus going back to WoW to finish off HFC.
MMORPG,3df19k,jayrocs,4,Fri Jul 17 15:03:34 2015 UTC,"Well - you'd have to get to 60 to see endgame now. But I am always on the search for what your looking for - a massive open world MMO that immerses the entire community. Not a theme-park MMO. FF14 is really a theme-park lobby.   I love FF14 (I have been subbed for almost 18 months and will probably never unsub) but I just can't play it that often anymore because, frankly, it isn't as much fun as other games I have and am currently playing.   The raiding @ end-game is very hard and rewarding though. That's what hooked me and kept me subbed for so long. Now the guild, friends, and fact that my wife plays is what keeps me subbed."
MMORPG,3df19k,EQCazik,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:50:34 2015 UTC,"FFXIV is a game that screwed one of mmorpgs most important parts which is the leveling.  The leveling in this game doesn't give it any justice, it's slow, full of quests and gated gameplay mechanics and very easy.  Most of the issues people talk about when they mention this game get solved at endgame (which is wrong), but for those of you that look for quality mmorpg and have patience (a lot of it), it's really worth the trip to endgame.  The new zones in the expansion are HUGE, multi leveled and have flying in it which adds to the awesomeness.  The combat no longer feels slow as the gcd gets lowered (buffs and spell/skill speed) but most importantly the combat gets complicated (the rotations and the actual boss mechanics) so you no longer ""feel"" slow.  Tons of content and it really feels like there is a lot to do compared to other games where I felt pigeon-holed into specific activities (usually grinding dungeons)."

Where top guilds ruled in FF11 and you never got to do anything unless in one. Most people that play 14 that played 11 do not even realize most of FF14 content is 11 content chopped up and recycled. The expansion is Zilart and Cop Expansions chopped with flying added. Most could not get past it because it was too hard to do and people were not willing to help players unless they were guild leads like me. Only problem I have with this game is everyone is the same. It is not skilled based its all memorization and gear and that is it."

MMORPG,3df19k,lmaonade200,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:04:45 2015 UTC,I personally have never been able to get through much of endgame without being bored. I have resubbed and unsubbed twice. The combat is monotonous in that the rotation is always played a specific way --- I hate this. It is partly due to the fact that characters and their abilities are hardly customizable. There is little to no difference between the rotation of one character class to another.

MMORPG,3df19k,harumphhh,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:03:15 2015 UTC,"In the simplest term, FFXIV is a better WoW. It's for people who wants to play WoW but don't want to play WoW.   The biggest reason for WoW's success, same as GW2's success that FFXIV shares is polish. Ultimately it's just a very stable and smooth game that requires the minimum amount of frustration to get started. They are all designed so people without a lot of times can still play and have a rewarding gaming experience.   Just like WoW and GW2, it's a well made theme park. There are many MMOs each with aspects that are far more interesting than these 3, but as a whole gaming experience they all fall short, hence why people always go back to these 3.   Think of FFXIV, WoW, and GW2 as the Disney World of MMOs. Other MMOs might have a better ride or attraction here and there, but as a complete experience, nothing quite rivals Disney World. For people who enjoys  a solo hike through the woods, or a MMA tournament no amount of attractions Disney World offers would appeal to them."
MMORPG,3df19k,toothpicksmash,3,Thu Jul 16 16:31:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I couldn't make it through having to grind fates and HAVING to do the story quest, yes I know it's a final fantasy game but it wasn't right to me.   I also felt there was no diversity in anything, everyone did the same story quest to level, everyone did the same rotation, everyone did the same everything. For me I enjoy when I can decide to grind for 5 hours straight on the mobs and not be feeling like I'm missing out on EXP because I needed to do the story line.   There's really nothing special about FFXIV. It has the most linear combat there is."
MMORPG,3df19k,Yellow_Tissue,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:27:04 2015 UTC,"This game and ESO (tried both) both rely on their franchise name.

MMORPG,3df19k,opiatex,3,Thu Jul 16 09:12:29 2015 UTC,"Explain to me then why FFXIV 1.0 failed so hard they had to remake the entire game from scratch. It already had the ""franchise name""."

I did say FFXIV is a good game but WoW decline and, most of all, the franchise name, made it reach a higher success than it deserved.  I don't say it's a bad game but it is not as great as people pretend it to be. It's just bland and pretty standard.  Hence, I can't see it having this kind of success without the brand name."
MMORPG,3df19k,opiatex,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:39:35 2015 UTC,"Of course the brand makes a difference, but 1.0 is proof the game itself has to be good for people to stick with it."

MMORPG,3df19k,lmaonade200,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:02:51 2015 UTC,Ok thanx for pointing it out. Just sharing the general idea that it is after all a game that only lost to WoW in terms of popularity so no surprise about the generally positive review.
MMORPG,3df19k,BlackEnchanter,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:09:36 2015 UTC,"I think a main reason that FFXIV is doing well is because they're picking up all of the ex-WoW players. From what I'm hearing from players I've talked too, its similar to WoW in a lot of aspects and has a really good endgame. It's a good game with good graphics and all.  From what I saw these ex-WoW players have been looking for a game to replace their fix for a long time. Since the first expansion came out, this ex-WoW player group has been slowly building up. With the last 2-3 expansions for WoW its grown very rapidly in terms of size.   Final Fantasy was release at the perfect time and has really been raking in these players. It quickly started gaining the public opinion of being a ""hardcore"" game and what not. Similar to what people refer to vanilla WoW.  Now I wouldn't say people are making a big fuss. I mean the data we have access too (which is limited, but it's data none the less) to FFXIV being almost as close to ESO in terms of popularity. FFXIV has world wide acclaim in both Eastern and Western markets, which really helped its rise to popularity. ESO mostly has EU/NA Popularity, but it released on three platforms which allowed it to really come into its own and rise in the ranks in the top MMOs.  The main difference between ESO and FFXIV in terms of popularity is that FFXIV has a lot more hardcore/dedicated playerbase."
MMORPG,3df19k,PalwaJoko,2,Thu Jul 16 03:56:10 2015 UTC,That would be (hmm...do I want to say ironic...? Damn you Alanis Morissette...) because back in the day (when it released) WoW picked up a LOT players from FFXI.

MMORPG,3df19k,dezolis84,0,Fri Jul 17 17:12:45 2015 UTC,Same here.

It's not. It makes me wonder if folks have even played a game with a great story. Sorry, but when half of the main story quest is ""gee-gee-gee, please mister please go around the world and collect cherries and eggs for our cake celebration, and hey, go across the world constantly to talk to these people (but they won't trust you because you're fugly, so you have to do a 30-chain questline for them). Don't get me started on the 50 emote quests you have to do with fairy cunts. God, just kill me. The PVP. Wat. The end game pve. Now I don't know if this has changed much, but I hit level 50 back a couple months after this game first came out. And do you know what your options were? 1 of 2 dungeons. That's right folks. You want good gear? You grind the same dungeon over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over the same dungeon over and ov... The community. I've seen people praise FFXIV for it's community but I've had level 50 characters on two different servers now (Gilgamesh and Goblin), and I have never seen such a cesspool of people around HM titan back when it was a thing. I'm not saying I was the best player. I'm not saying I was the nicest player.

You talk about the content of the endgame at the launch of the game dude... OFC it'll be somewhat lacking, thats why they have content patches and expansions (every game is like that), but now? there are tons of endgame activity and it's barely feel repetitive or a grind.

And then comes the story of the addon which is actually REALLY good because they drop all the boring stuff and move to the interesting ones. True. But i always felt like PvP doesn't belong in a game like this anyways. I always wondered about that much focus on pvp in WoW. It felt wrong to me. True.

Also those since those 1-2 dungeons and 1 hm titan, 15+ new ones plus a whole bunch of boss fights (10+ I think) and raids have been added.

MMORPG,3dd672,Hexadis,41,Wed Jul 15 10:02:28 2015 UTC,"You are correct that modern MMOs aren't designed for you anymore. There are a few big reasons.  MMOs used to target a specific niche demographic. That demographic itself has evolved. People MMOs used to target now has much less time due to change in society, economy, and lifestyle. People that started out on Everquest playing 10 hours has  a family now, the more ""immersive"" activities like finding groups, open exploration, and working towards an achievement is now a negative that eats away at valuable playtime.   MMOs now cater to different demographics. With MMO being very pedestrian and accessible to the general population, they really don't target hardcore players anymore. With more people playing, it means your features are more diluted to fit the taste of different crowds. Games that focus on hardcore players just don't have the userbase and fails until they start backpedaling.   MMOs as a genre is more mature now. Many ""features"" some player talked about from difficulty to ""immersion"" is not so much a conscious choice but accidental. Games don't come from a blank slate. When someone looks to make a MMO, especially 10 to 15 years ago, MMO wasn't a concept most people had. They simply want to build a persistent multiplayer game and looked at existing ones for features that worked and tossed out what they think didn't work. Over the course of the decade, quality of life improved, features get streamlined, production cycles sped up. That means invisible walls, group finders, and games with less downtime. Basically, MMOs used to be a big empty house you can fool around in, now has all the furniture and appliance installed.   The business models also changed. Free-to-Play really changed how MMOs are designed. MMOs used to be long-term investments for players and steady cash flow for companies. With the advent of F2P, designs are more focused on grabbing onto the large spenders and just keep the regular player in a game long enough to keep the whales happy. Most players will spend very little money if any at all in an F2P MMO before moving on, they are essentially products for the large spenders who dumps a lot of money into the game. You want to increase the time a F2P player stays so as to increase the likelihood of getting a large spender. A game that looks and feels populated generally seems a better game to throw money at than a dead or dying one. Features that take time to create gratification tend to reduce the time a F2P player will play a game. This constant stream of easy achievements is to hook them and get more to spend money before moving on."

MMORPG,3dd672,Bior37,2,Thu Jul 16 01:31:02 2015 UTC,"Great post. Have an upvote.  MMORPG as a genre has largely developed beyond the old fanbase, and with every big change comes its highlights and its sacrifices. It's a sad thing for people who enjoyed the genre in its infancy, but stagnation is really never an answer for an industry that wants to grow. Of course, every trend has its exceptions so OP may yet find the MMO for him in the modern era!"
MMORPG,3dd672,lmaonade200,3,Wed Jul 15 18:09:23 2015 UTC,"For each feature OP wants, it's found in a separate MMO. The cost of MMOs are so high, publishers are less willing to deviate from the standard formula and take risks.   Ultimately, the next innovation from MMO will be something, be it economy or technology, that can drive down the cost dramatically. That's when we'll see a lot of the features older MMO players miss and new features never seen before.   Maybe when someone develops and licenses an MMO dev framework or API that's cheap to use or the economy crashes and labor cost goes down."
MMORPG,3dd672,toothpicksmash,2,Wed Jul 15 19:41:24 2015 UTC,"An MMO dev framework already exists.  Hero Engine.  $99/year.  If that is beyond what they can afford, they're not going to be able to make an MMO regardless.  The only positive way labor costs could go down is if companies started opening offices in cheaper locations.  If the economy or industry crashed, it's not going to have whatever positive impact you think it might.  MMO devs are already grossly underpaid compared to if they were utilizing their skills for a non gaming company.  If you cut pay even further, you're going to have a mass exodus of talent, and the MMO industry is going to be left with the kids who couldn't cut it."

I used to love the time spent on Vanilla WoW & FFXI, but I remember how difficult it was and the fact I had to spend upwards to 5+ hours a day just to accomplish anything. These days I can't spend 5+ hours in a day on an MMORPG sadly, but the way MMORPGs have evolved to be a bit more simpler and easier to pick up has allowed me to keep sticking on the MMORPG genre. Thanks to this new streamlined style, it picks up both old and new incoming players.  It's sad as I have VERY fond memories of these games, but I just can't go back and play like I used to before."

MMORPG,3dd672,draica,10,Thu Jul 16 09:21:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not even relatively old and got into the MMO world quite recently, but I agree 100% with that.  Playing Neverwinter I couldn't get my ex to stop saying how much of a great game it was. There were lots of people on every single area and everyone I knew outside the game asked how it was cos they were excited to try it out. It felt like a chore for me. A linear game where you spam fetch quests and level up in a very linear fashion. ""Open world"" with no exploration encouragement, no player interactions, a fast combat that felt too repetitive because that's what you do for hours. Even though I respect people who like this kind of game, I can't understand the appeal.   As you said, a single player RPG such as Skyrim, Final Fantasy (let's not talk about X and XIII, cos neither had open world) and Dragon Age don't rush you so you can spam the end game. They're all about the journey and the things you do on your way to the end. Ironically, modern MMOs feel pretty much like a single player game cos there's no need for actual interaction and you play mostly through a linear storyline to reach the end. I played FFXI on old school server and it was one of the best experiences I had in MMOs. Even though RuneScape was already somewhat easier by the time I got back to it after more than 10 years, it was still rewarding not having to follow a storyline or grinding all the way till the end."
MMORPG,3dd672,caelumsixsmith,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:46:19 2015 UTC,"I agree, especially with Neverwinter. It took me a while to get to max lvl (at the time) but the long repetitive journey was hwat made end game more satisfying.  I'd still play Neverwinter if it wasn't so fucking pay 2win. The combat is really great in that game, and it only has a couple skills.  None of that super complicated multiple skillbar bs."
MMORPG,3dd672,kyoushunsui,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:59:29 2015 UTC,"It would be a great game with a different publisher. It's not built around levelling. Levelling is merely a glorified tutorial, you get to try different skills, 3 or so on each map, and then you're ready for the core of the game, which is dungeons, pvp and solo campaigns.  If you're into elder game that's probably a game you'll enjoy, if you're more into playing alone, then it's not for you. So what?  I enjoyed this game for two years because it has no tab-targetting and ""must keep on with rotation"" bullshit, while not being an easy game. That's not insignificant in my book. Actually I find the core gameplay of neverwinter absolutely fantastic, but what's surrounding it (lack of new content, too many bugs, a greedy publisher that cares only about return on investment and refuses to invest into this game) is why I left."
MMORPG,3dd672,Renard4,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:51:15 2015 UTC,"We're talking about Neverwinter, right? By elder you mean someting old school? I actually prefer RuneScape and FFXI, then. For me Neverwinter followed the same concept of many theme park MMOs, but much worse cos it lacks exploration. The open world didn't mean much at all cos everytime I was running around the same map, doing fetch/kill quests in a linear fashion, killing things every second... There was no time to look around, to explore, to enjoy the world and playing alone or with someone else didn't make a difference for me. In other theme park MMOs we can at least stop to take a breath, look at the scenery, perhaps craft something.  If anyone enjoys it, good for them, but I'm not going to restrain my opinion just cos it wasn't meant for me in some way :/"
MMORPG,3dd672,caelumsixsmith,6,Thu Jul 16 14:14:33 2015 UTC,"I dont think modern features such as dungeon finders are a bad thing, its the world itself that is the problem and the lack of variety of things to do. MMORPGs are wayyyy to themepark now, you literally go from quest hub to quest hub ..dungeon to dungeon..and then endgame raids...for what? To get better gear to do more endgame raids?. There should be a variety of things to do that are rewarding and it should be immersive. What about player economy, character customization, goals that players can set, ect. There should a variety of things to grind in a mmorpg but the grind should be unique and fun instead of this same old dungeon grind.  Look at games created near or before WoW like Ultima, Ragnarok  online, even runescape. These games provided a lot of player choices and never held your hand you were just put into the world and let free."
MMORPG,3dd672,retuxan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:02:42 2015 UTC,"Dungeon finders are bad for the kind of game I want for two reasons:   They absolutely kill any sense of community.  Sure they let you get into dungeons quicker, but you will probably be playing with people on a different server.  You will probably never see these people again and that can encourage all kinds of less pleasant behavior which can range from a simple lack of communication to outright trolling. They are terrible for immersion.  WoW did a great job in its early days of building up the lore around dungeons.  Even something as simple as finding a dungeon is a great way to encourage player exploration of the world."
MMORPG,3dd672,retuxan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:13:55 2015 UTC,"Its 2015 and a LFG website can be put up in a few hours after an mmo's launch if there is no dungeon finder. Look at destiny for example, go to destinylfg.com and you'll see my point. Sure not having a dungeon finder will encourge you to group with the same people and even become friends but technology and the number of players has increased since WoW's early days. Players will and can group up with randoms regardless if the feature is there or not. Wikias is another example of sites that weren't present back then and now they are...killing any form of challenge/exploration/player interaction."
MMORPG,3dd672,faern,3,Wed Jul 15 22:00:42 2015 UTC,Games should absolutely facilitate a way for players to get together with strangers!  I just think the random dungeon finder is the wrong solution to a very valid problem.

It was a hell of a time-consuming one because it took dozens of hours for even the smallest amount of progression, but it was mind numbingly simple.  The only people challenged by EQ1 were the kids and the neckbeards.  That's why EQ1 hemorrhaged customers whenever new MMOs came out.  The good players were looking for an actual challenge.  The neckbeards that had no discipline and couldn't be asked to ever get better at their hobby remained in EQ1 where they knew the game would be easy but it would just ask them to remain an unemployed loser.

MMORPG,3dd672,phancdp,2,Wed Jul 15 19:22:04 2015 UTC,I feel like nowadays everything is endgame so you feel the need to get there as fast as possible because that is where the game really starts. I loved the MMOs years ago where level cap meant something. I was content never getting to max level. I could grind for hours for 40% of a level. But I know us grinders are the minority now and it isn't fiscally dependable to cater to us.
MMORPG,3dd672,phancdp,2,Wed Jul 15 23:03:03 2015 UTC,"Have you tried asking your friends to see if they would like to just enjoy the scenery, quest, and kill 10 pigs everywhere? Or just go to end game and raid asap? Because i dont know about you, but thats what my friends and i all wanna do, raid. If they wanna sit around and go through a journey theyll play skyrim.

Also i found WoW doing quests together way better than ESO. Just couldn't get into ESO.  That actually wasnt a question designed exactly towards you, just MMOs in general, haha. They're not journeys, they feel like grinding. That's why all my friends don't want to get into MMOs. And they're considered time sinks. Nobody likes that.

MMORPG,3dd672,Plugawy_Nedznik,3,Thu Jul 16 04:59:21 2015 UTC,"Well said and I too feel exactly as you do, sadly we are in the minority so games no longer target our interests.   MMORPGs in the beginning were developed and played like an epic tale to be explored and enjoyed.  Finding new and interesting things to do each day you play, slowly crafting your character to become some vision you have him to be.   Today MMOs are designed to be beaten not played, and why is that? Because that's the way a vast majority of gamers attack their games, to be conquered, that's how they get enjoyment out of them. The gamers like me that want to enjoy all aspects of a lifelike fantasy world are becoming a dying breed.   I'm not sure when MMOs became such a competitive genre but I'm sorry that it did.   Someday I hope a company will figure out how to combine the two styles so we can all enjoy a game with a thriving community."

MMORPG,3dd672,Sandbucketman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:51:02 2015 UTC,Yea but there wasn't no lvling as in other mmo  We unlike skills and had I'll/gear score system to progress to harder stuff
MMORPG,3dd672,xeio87,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:39:31 2015 UTC,"TSW is sort of complicated to explain in that there are no ""levels"" as they exist in most other MMOs, but there is still a similar concept.  You earn a Skill Point or Ability Point every so many XP. The main difference from traditional leveling the amount of XP required to get a new point is the same no matter how many points you already*. With no AP/SP cap, no class locks, and no diminishing returns you will eventually unlock every ability.  *Minor thing, I think there is a boost to new players so they can fill out at least one weapon's tree fairly quickly, but I don't recall the specifics, it might just be bonus XP at that level or something."
MMORPG,3dd672,Sandbucketman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:56:21 2015 UTC,"How's that complicated? Skill-based MMOs have been around since 97, some of the most successful are skill-based. Having said that, they do use levels too, but they're hidden (see Ultima, SWG)."

MMORPG,3dd672,Sandbucketman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:11:12 2015 UTC,"and have to play said ""class"" to level it up   This is the only particularly inaccurate part.

Please don't skim over a post and then decide that the content is what you think it is.  There's a ton of MMORPG's out there which have you play multiple classes. Not mandatory,  you can simply swap between what you want to play and level it up(for example Final fantasy 14). This is exactly that same system however for some reason there's some serious denial in the TSW circles that it's not a leveling system which is exactly what it is.    You progress through experience and gain milestones(points) to spend in a tree. Your progression in the game at a certain ""class""(not an actual class, I'm using quotation marks for a reason) is dictated by how many points you have spent in said ""class"" and allow you to unlock bonuses or new skills by spending them.   The only thing missing from this LEVELING system is the word LEVELING."
MMORPG,3dd672,Axiom2000,2,Wed Jul 15 19:43:03 2015 UTC,1 - true  2 - false  the full explanation to why will be long and technical i assume you either forgotten or didn't bother to learn TSW char system in-depth either way i see little point continuing the argument as it gets farther and farther from topic
MMORPG,3dd672,Jespur,0,Wed Jul 15 19:50:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no.  There are levels.  There is no doubt about that.  Go to an area too high for your level and you will get promptly squashed.  They may try to obfuscate it a little, but it's painfully obvious after playing a bit that levels are very much a thing."
MMORPG,3dd672,Excuse_my_GRAMMER,2,Wed Jul 15 20:08:45 2015 UTC,"It's not really levels that screw you, it's gear.  If your gear isn't strong enough for an area you'll have a rough time doing anything there without getting killed.  I suppose if you really squint at it you can call gear progression a level system, but it's really not.  Unless you mean levels in the old school video game stages sense.  In which case, yeah, monsters are stronger or weaker in different areas."

MMORPG,3dd672,Excuse_my_GRAMMER,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:21:55 2015 UTC,The only reason you think that is because the game is developed with that in mind. MMOs nowadays let you faceroll dungeons and because of that they give you gear that's useless in a few levels.
MMORPG,3dd672,Katalos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:06:07 2015 UTC,Yea because that were we spent the less amount of time is lvling   If mmorpg all had to offer was a lvling experience once player hit the cap they will unsubscribe or stop playing (if f2p)   That why to devs they focus on endgame because endgame player are the ones that subscribes for months/years
MMORPG,3dd672,notblack7,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:01:00 2015 UTC,"Yea because that were we spent the less amount of time is lvling   So, basically what I said before. You're playing games designed to get you to max level in a couple weeks (some even less), so you don't spend a lot of time at those levels.  Max level should be something to work towards, instead of the game starting at max level."
MMORPG,3dd672,notblack7,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:00:16 2015 UTC,That what I'm saying Lvling is a chore   In most games I rush to endgame in less then a week and don't even stress gear til endgame   Have you try dcuo? That mmo did it right lvl30 cap but an indept skill point system where you have to clear challenge/achievements   But a lvl30 with 30 skill point vs a lvl30 with cap skill point is a huge differents
MMORPG,3dd672,notblack7,2,Thu Jul 16 02:20:57 2015 UTC,Have my upvote. This is exactly how I feel about the modern MMORPGs.
MMORPG,3dd672,Axiom2000,2,Thu Jul 16 02:33:25 2015 UTC,"The thing is leveling is mostly a solo experience and endgame is where the community really shows itself. You can't expect there to be a ton of people at low levels unless you have a huge game. If an awesome leveling experience is what you want, there are plenty of great solo RPGs that are immersive and take it slow exactly like you want. Most people want to get to the community driven content, the guilds and dungeons, so they want to get to endgame quickly. There is also nothing wrong with leveling quickly in the beginning as it opens up the world faster and gives you more things to explore. No one wants to be stuck in the same area for several hours."
MMORPG,3dd672,newvictim,0,Thu Jul 16 02:40:58 2015 UTC,"Who said leveling is mostly a solo experience?  I love MMORPGs because it is a great way for me to play games with my wife or friends who live half way across the country.  I usually have many alts that I play and level with other people.  The fact that many people view leveling as solo play and that community doesn't start happening until endgame is a result of companies designing their games around this concept of endgame.  If you are feeling ""stuck"" in one area, maybe that area just isn't very fun.  Or maybe you should have the option to go play in a different area if you don't find a particular zone very fun.  This doesn't have to be related to levels for any reason."
MMORPG,3dd672,clicksallthethings,3,Wed Jul 15 18:51:28 2015 UTC,"Like I described, there isn't a lot of people leveling at the same time unless you have a huge amount of people playing the game.  Even large games have population problems at lower levels. I'm not sure what you expect companies to do about it.   I guess its the only way for you to play with your ""friends from across the country"" but many solo RPGs have multiplayers for people who want to play with close friends. A lot of others play MMORPGs to meet new people online and play with them - much easier at endgame.   Finally, from the RPGs you played, usually when do you usually start seeing the capitol cities and when does most of the map become available to you? Around levels 10-30, so it's a good thing for the first 10 or so levels to go by quickly so you can start seeing the rest of the population at all levels. Wildstar has a big problem where you don't see the rest of the population until several hours later which leads to a very lonely early game experience."
MMORPG,3dd672,Villentrenmerth,0,Wed Jul 15 21:48:40 2015 UTC,"You're right.  Low level player populations can be an issue for established games, but in my opinion, making the low levels go by super fast is the wrong way to address the problem."
MMORPG,3dd672,Axiom2000,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:06:50 2015 UTC,I should add that I like taking me time and not rushing to endgame. But I think it is better for the first 10 levels to go by fast and then cap at 60 than it be slow from the beginning and cap at 50.
MMORPG,3dd672,Villentrenmerth,3,Wed Jul 15 22:17:19 2015 UTC,dude - you just described TSW (The Secret World) as the game of your dreams (it has literally everything you asked for except harsh death penalty)   TSW review - http://mmos.com/review/the-secret-world  video review - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQiRDEE82g  TSW is b2p people that already have it can give free trial keys - https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSecretWorld/comments/31g2jp/the_official_buddy_key_thread_all_requests_and/   i copy pasted my response to other people - not spamming just thought it would be relevant for them too

MMORPG,3dd672,Franc_Kaos,4,Wed Jul 15 22:40:07 2015 UTC,I agree.  TSW is a very strong game.  Quite complex.  Very in-depth.  The mission and leveling system are very nicely done. Very recommend.

MMORPG,3dd672,Axiom2000,3,Wed Jul 15 13:47:10 2015 UTC,"I really like Secret World, but that being said, I think it is important to note where it suffers, in addition to where it excels.  Without question, it has some of the most complex, intriguing quests in a modern MMO.  The stories are top notch, the dialogue is on par with if not superior to modern bioware games, and there are some genuinely scary quests and environments in the game.  It's a world that really wants the player to be immersed, and does a pretty solid job at doing that .... HOWEVER ....  It is a themepark MMO in the classic since of the term.  You have your starting zone, you do the quests in that zone, get experience to ""level"" (the leveling system isn't traditional, but it still is a leveling system), you ""complete the area,"" then you progress in the story and move on to the next area.  While the quests are innovative, the gameplay itself is rather ... archaic at this point.  Character controls, combat rotations, movement ... all feels like a lesser version of what you expect from post-WoW clones.  It doesn't really innovate the combat/movement player experience to the same extent that a game like GW2 does.  It plays very familiar, and really isn't up to par with other comparable games.  Again, I really like the game as well, but it is definitely not a perfect game; and while the world is certainly immersive, sometimes actually playing the game can be a bit of a chore."
MMORPG,3dd672,iLikeHotJuice,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:52:52 2015 UTC,It doesn't really innovate the combat/movement player experience to the same extent that a game like GW2 does.

MMORPG,3dd672,caelumsixsmith,-1,Wed Jul 15 19:42:08 2015 UTC,"I have to say beware of funcom games.   I had major issues with them after a 6 month break on age of Conan, and then playing TSW for a few months and taking a break.   Both times characters were messed up, lost levels, had equipment changed/sold/removed, character names changed etc.   I had a level 50 Ranger on AoC and when I returned I got the login message ""That name is in use"" so had to change my character name. When I logged in loads of stuff had been changed and when I queried them about it they said no different IP addresses had accessed my account so I hadn't been hacked and did nothing about it. My character was a lower level too, although I forget what it was now.   While most of the changes were minimal to my account, there was enough stuff going on for me to be very wary about spending any money with them even though the games were fun, so take this as a warning to be careful and not a ""DO NOT PLAY"" message."

It matters only for PVP. Because you will fight in battle grounds only with your dimension people. Other than that anyone can come to your dimension to play with you. Chat is global through all dimensions so you can find people to play with and no one even cares about what dimension he is. When you group up it will give a pop up which says ""you're playing in another instance than your group. Wanna join them?"" :)"

Sooner or later it's going to happen because they actively look for this kind of keys.  It's best to buy the game from Funcom or steam directly. There's no risk of being banned and it's not that expensive given that the base game has 300h worth of solo content. Don't be cheap.

I then invite myself, activate key from g2play and give that account to a friend or random person on internet. So far not a single one said that they were banned.

There is a huge uprising of indie multiplayer games (not your traditional MMORPG, since that's mostly not feasible for small teams wanting to feed themselves anytime soon) that may interest you, however. You will have to make some sacrifices to find a game with longevity though, since you are a MMO veteran and are more set in your preferences."

I couldn't agree with you more regarding endgame, frankly this is one of the things that has become an instant turn-off for me in new MMOs.  I'm just not paying for anymore games that are focused on the good ol vertical grind to max level then endless cycle of gear grinding approach.

MMORPG,3dd672,Bierno,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:19:31 2015 UTC,"No, I watched the transition as WoW turned into a game that I just didn't find that fun any more.  I played WoW for 4 years.  The original WoW had no quest tracking and I can tell you I actually even now still remember the layout of the early zones (couch, cough, Barrens) from spending time trying to find mobs and complete quests.  If you start a new WoW account right now, you will out-level the mobs in a zone before you are even 75% done with that zone's story arch.  Starting with WotlK (I think) quest tracking was built into the game and I can tell you I don't remember much about those zones even though I leveled through them at least 3 times."
MMORPG,3dd672,Biohack,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:48:15 2015 UTC,"I think the last great MMO I played was probably Guild Wars (the original + expansions not the cash cow that is GW2) from starting in the prophecies expansion and levelling through there (yes max level was 20 but max level meant nothing) capping elite skills, vanquishing full areas, get masters on missions etc... the game had everything and then it also had possibly one of the best PvP experiences available. even now if you start a new char and go through the game you see just how polished a product it is/was and that PvE actually had some challenge to it (not just go here and kill 5 mobs/gather 5 items etc...)  THAT is what is missing from the MMO world atm a game that actually has playability and depth (for anyone who has never played GW I would suggest buying it and trying it especially as it is now so cheap and there is still a good population in game apart from PvP which is dead now)"

Prefer looking for a group at the entrance or in town where you atleast communicate with people other than just queue and play and see what happens.  Also the reason why I enjoy the more open sandbox MMO over others such as SWG/ArcheAge  ArcheAge was almost the perfect game for me but the cashshop ruined it for me.  The world is alive because of the conflict that can happen when you do Traderuns.. or even fighting a boss, another guild can come and attack you at the same time.. but i had to quit because of the normalization (no better mount or glider etc)/cashshop (lets give out thunderstruck trees, enchanting mats)/catchup gear (added to the in the game right at launch which made weapon craftsmen pointless unless its the best weapon) etc..

MMORPG,3dd672,jjbanana,2,Wed Jul 15 20:24:30 2015 UTC,"This post is spot on. No MMO has come close to the immersion I felt during SWG. You create your character then select where in the galaxy you want to start. If you choose the wrong planet or city then you will need to earn some cash to buy a speeder or shuttle to the city your friends are at. You buy your speeder and travel to your friends. You are deep in the desert, Tuskin raiders shoot at you and your speeder's engine begins to flame. Luckily there is a player built city with a garage where you can fix up your bike and continue your journey. You go to your map and enter the coordinates of their location. Your friends are out doing imperial missions in attempt to switch factions. You find them, surrounding a camp fire. One of your friends is an entertainer, and is healing your other friend's fatigue with some relaxing music and dancing. Your friend just switched from a Master fencer to a creature handler/ teras kasi and is trying to tame a bantha to eventually turn into a mount for me. After we do a few missions, we head to Anchor head and ask people in the cantina if they know any good armorsmiths. This guy gives us the coordinates of a player house on Nabu. We shuttle over to the space station and travel across the system. Inside the players house he has his own npc vendors that sell his amazing gear. Amazing because the resources were rare and because all his class points were dedicated to crafting and not combat. A few days later we stumbled acrosss him in curoscant with a line of 10 people waiting to have their gear modded by him. We recognized his name since it is on the info of the gear we bought at his house.  Turns out not many people knew the coordinates of his house, where his products were available at a cheaper rate. Awesome find."

The biggest theory is that VR16 fits perfectly with level 65, so they can just convert it to straight levels with little retrofitting, they would just need to rebalance the experience gain (which they have also done with this update). They also add veteran ranks because they wanted to add some kind of progression to the game, it seems they are so opposed to a vertical progression system that they refuse to add higher level items without increasing player levels."

All the servers were full and took from few tries to half an hour to log in depending on your luck. There wasn't any sort of que whatsoever, so you had to keep trying along with writing the captcha to log in.  Unless if you were Premium, which meant insta log in.   Joymax back then did nothing to the bots and people were aware of it and everybody knew the fact that if you paid, you would be safe with your botting.  Terrible grinding and the quests mostly consisted of killing mobs. If I recall correctly at later level they were all over 1000 kills.   Honestly I wouldn't even consider spending time on it, it's just no good considering what the current mmo market has to offer. Unless if you like old stuff that is, but I still can't see any person who has certain sanity left in them playing this game without bot.

Unfortunately it will not have aged well but the game has some amazing concepts such as world bosses that spawned in different areas of the map (timed) people would camp them and socialize while waiting or there were trade runs you could buy good from one town and transport them for profit to another but not without its risks! Players could chose jobs; hunter or thief. Hunter could protect them or thief's would rob them. This create PvP all over the map with people trying safe routes or guilds choosing the insanely risky and obvious routes but with paid protection or guildies. The theme of the game was also unique with two seperate continents to explore with vibrant cities and player trading. There's so many negatives and positives with this game it's worth just trying for yourself and finding a private server that has high population. I wouldn't personally try the official as the company doesn't care about it's servers and riddled with bots etc. My favorite ever MMORPG and have yet to find one to replace it.

MMORPG,3dg955,-shaddy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:26:48 2015 UTC,"Such a fun MMO at the time. The map was great - lots of areas to explore. The thief/hunter/merchant system was top-notch, for example you could steal loot and spawn NPC thieves which could kill one-star traders. Everything just felt so alive because of the fact that different sorts of events impact each other, like bosses spawning randomly along with traders trying to make money in between players trying to grind quests. Nowadays too many MMORPGs have dungeons which really defeats the purpose of having a great map.  The map, the monsters, the spells, items etc. everything looked and felt great, but having to grind SP was way too much work. You couldn't even get to high level even if you played 24/7. That's why I botted, and...it felt great because I could explore the map further. Honestly, it was probably the only game where being high level felt really really satisfying because you could taxi/powerlevel a party - getting paid on an hour basis, you could spawn higher level thieves, fight cooler looking mobs etc.  I'd 100% play it if it gets a remake (not talking about Legend of Silkroad, that game looks shit, I'm talking about a graphical upgrade, removing bots, decrease SP requirements for skills). The game had a rather small English speaking population - it was filled with Turks/hispanics/bots. I logged on a while ago and found out my 30mill of gold disappeared from my inventory, so never bothered to play it again."

Earning all the upgrades for a vehicles and weapons, earning the weapons and what not; it can take a long time. So it felt very grindy.  It also was very...strategy lacking? When I played it (about 6 months ago) it had the same strategy and gameplay it did when it was in released. Zerging. 90% of the players on the maps seemed to be in giant zergs for their respected teams. Small battles were the minority. When attacking the basic strategy was to spam Sunderers (they're vehicles that when deployed, can spawn allies) and place them all over the place as many as you could in areas that were deemed relatively safe. The attackers would then spawn from these and run at the defenders/objectives. The defenders on the other hand would spawn from their invincible spawn points and run at the enemies. See spawn points can't be destroyed. So the defenders just spawn at them, run at the objective/enemy sunderers. If you die, you respawn right back in. They would occasionally place Sunderers to try to flank the enemy zerg.   The biggest ""strategy"" that pissed me off to know end was suicide traveling. Basically in order for zergs to travel fast they would all kill themselves. Then they would spawn at a base near where they wanted to go or back at the main spawn to spawn a bunch of vehicles. But at least the vehicles still had to travel. The last time I played I was having this awesome ~10 vs ~10 person battle. It was really intense because of the horrible spawn system they have in the game (imagine trying to fight a battle where one side has a destructible spawn point and the other doesn't). It finally looked we were about to win. Then out of no where from the enemies spawn point comes flooding out ~50 enemy players that just steam roll this small 10 man squad I was in and destroy our spawn point. The last 30 minutes wasted because the nearby zerg that was nearby killed themselves to spawn rush us. I finally said fuck it and went to go play Bf4 since that experience is actually better.   I'm also an avid pilot. Love piloting stuff. The air combat in Planetside 2 is horrible. It's boring, uncomplicated, low skill floor, and very gear reliant. They introduced this new air vehicle called the Valkyrie that was supposed to be some type of small craft air transport vehicle with minimal offensive capabilities. It blew. It was just a massive failure and still was the last time I played those 6 months ago. It was too slow to be evasive enough so both air and ground targets would blow it out of the sky instantly. It had little to no offensive capabilities so that any aircraft could take them out with easy. Hell even Galaxies (these massive transport vehicles) were eating them alive because they would just run into them.  So yeah, those are my opinions of it. Just thinking about it again is getting me angry.  Of course I implore you to try it for yourself. It is free so there's no harm in trying. It just wasn't the game for me, but it may be for you."

The dungeons were great, but unfortunately at the time at least, you couldn't really grind them for xp to level up. So it was just the god awful questing. The game also had horrible optimizations.

The questing was abysmal at best.  I restarted in June of this year.  I managed to get to level 32 through just instancing (the new Protostar Academy instance at level 10 helped a lot), but that's where it ended for me.  Carbine would have been hard pressed to make a genuinely less enjoyable leveling experience in a game that is otherwise fun to play."

MMORPG,3ddck6,seVan80,2,Thu Jul 16 15:35:45 2015 UTC,"Truth is, despite the boring questing Tera's leveling process is surprisingly more enjoyable because you have a choice of what you can do to get XP. You can spam dungeons, you can select what types of quests and what area of the world you want to quest in, you can just kill monsters all day, you can do dailies or PvP raids. You also level up way faster. Wildstar you are forced to play the story in exact linear fashion, no selection in really where you can go and no skipping main quests. That's the real nail in the coffin for otherwise above average questing ideas. Also you often get only 5-10% XP for MAIN QUESTS which is brutal."
MMORPG,3ddck6,dudekitten,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:54:27 2015 UTC,Leveling prozess ahve been adjusted in Wildstar since launch it is shorter and you dont have to kill that much mobs fro the same xp and to complete the quests.

MMORPG,3ddck6,seVan80,6,Fri Jul 17 07:40:02 2015 UTC,"I felt the same way, PLUS the endgame at the time was ""devote your life or GTFO"" with a bunch of elitists taking over the subreddit, and hearing about how dungeoning was a joke because people would bail the moment somebody died or made a mistake, and it was just one gigantic gated grind.  As a traveling consultant at the time, I was dependent on hotel internet (which is flakey at best) and couldn't set dependable hours...

Apparently they thought that mean dumbing down and that I should go back to WoW. So I quit.  I will try it again when it goes F2P as the game itself was pretty fun, but if I see the same crap, I'm out again."

The lore also seemed boring and I lost interest in quest grinding."
MMORPG,3ddck6,Invincible1,2,Wed Jul 15 19:58:31 2015 UTC,Wildstar shines in it's dungeons and raids.   I completely understand why you find the game boring but honestly you shouldn't write the game off until you've tried a dungeon or raid.

MMORPG,3ddck6,AlsvartrKhaos,7,Wed Jul 15 12:38:53 2015 UTC,My guild died.   The game had little to offer besides raiding and the raiding was fairly taxing. A number of key members of my guild left and because we needed numerous replacements it meant that we had to re-do a lot of content and probably couldn't even match our own progression which demoralized us even further.  There just wasn't a whole lot to do and doing the dungeons over and over to attune people wasn't very fun.

MMORPG,3ddck6,piedpeid,3,Wed Jul 15 14:05:52 2015 UTC,"Boredom mostly.   the story was bland. the characters were bland. combat, while fun, wasn't enough to keep me engaged in the game world.   I didn't like the classes very much, they didn't appeal to me. same with the races. the art direction also wasn't that appealing to me.   Finally, i don't like how carbine handled their launch. it was clear they should have waited to release, but they didn't. their development cycles were bad. they made promises they couldn't keep. as such, i found it difficult to trust carbine to deliver on fixes. they've done a remarkable job of it. but at this point i feel its too little too late. I do commend them for their hard work. but i likely won't check the game out again until it goes f2p. and even then it will be just more to see how far its come and not because i'm seriously wanting to play it."
MMORPG,3ddck6,Onisake,4,Wed Jul 15 15:29:34 2015 UTC,Performance. I don't have the best PC but there's absolutely  no reason it should run as badly as it does.
MMORPG,3ddck6,Melwing,4,Wed Jul 15 16:47:31 2015 UTC,"Performance was bad. I could only get 40-50 FPS in PvP on a high end machine, and I'm used to 120. Gear was rating restricted. We started at 1200 rating and immediately faced opponents in 1800 rating gear (+50% stats) that we had no access to. Also runes were too expensive. Several bugs could be exploited to gain huge advantages in PvP. You could stack certain snares (abilities + weapon procs) to keep a 90% snare up. You could stack healing debuffs to make a target basically unhealable. You could macro trinkets to use them multiple times at once on the same cooldown (instant 100% group heal on every group member). The combat system didn't work for larger groups. 3v3 was fine but in 10v10 you would just create instant death zones with AoE spam and there was no point in even trying to dodge since the telegraphs covered everything. Telegraphs weren't reliable. You could see this by looking at the bots who would aim and dodge differently than players because they knew where the actual hit boxes were. Also your position wasn't getting updated while airborne, i.e. a Warrior would be visually moving during his finisher combo and still get hit by telegraphs aiming at his original position."

Performance is definitely a big problem with this game."

MMORPG,3ddck6,Arcland,3,Wed Jul 15 15:10:33 2015 UTC,"The real major reasons I stopped playing it was because I saw the writing on the wall. WoD was picking up a lot of hype and players who reached endgame were abandoning the game left and right. A few of my friends couldn't even play the game because of the AMD performance issues.  When I played it I got to ~level 25. I thought the general gameplay was pretty boring. I played an Esper and I thought the skill selection system was pretty boring, every thing was a combo point builder or spender, with a few simple on demand use buttons. I thought the 'Everything is telegraphs!' system was really gimmicky, not every single mechanic ever needs to be summed up as red is bad. Also most other recent MMOs use telegraphs, but a lot more sparingly and less gimmicky. I thought the quests were okayish but still lean on the generic side of things, this seems more like an industry wide problem rather than a W* only problem. Esper was a poor choice too, a class that really couldn't move in a game all about moving out of red.  It also doesn't help that I wasn't heavily invested in it. WoW was my main MMO at the time and SoO was just run to death, so I thought trying out W* would be interesting to try out during the WoW downtime."
MMORPG,3ddck6,Zienth,3,Wed Jul 15 17:13:02 2015 UTC,"I never stopped playing, since day 1. I'm at the point now where I pretty much have everything I could farm, grind. Completed both raids + the hardboss boss in the game (hard mode initialisation core Y-83) which only 3 guilds killed so far due to extreme difficulty.  IMO, if you have to time to invest in a raid progression guild, there is no reason you would quit this game, as the raiding scene in WS is the best in the MMO market today.  I agree that the rest of the game is average/decent, while the PvP is lackluster/unbalanced as fuck."
MMORPG,3ddck6,Nightmare2828,3,Wed Jul 15 17:35:50 2015 UTC,"As a new player to the game, I'm giving it a fair shot. Currently level 35 and there were some fun parts (mostly dungeons) and boring parts. However, there are also several things that bother me:   Poor character customization - It is hard to get immersed if you aren't attached to your character and they look like everyone else. Unusual animation/character design - Game feels a lot like ""Rayman."" Everything is so bouncy. Female characters walk awkwardly and have disproportionate bodies. They look like ants with a thorax and abdomen separated by a tiny waist.  Combat gets old - The mobility is nice but in the end the classes I've tried only use the same 3-4 abilities in their DPS rotations (especially Esper and Warrior) all the time, with a little bit of crowd control spread in between. Bosses are fun due to their mechanics not due to the combat... Eight abilities is too limiting IMO.  Too many quests! - You don't get to the capitol city until level 14 which is many hours of game time where you are forced to do the main quest. The quests themselves are varied and can be fun, but it feels like it goes on foreverrrr and you are forced to be in the same area for so long. Leveling is too slow - Doesn't feel worth it to do quests when it raises your XP by 5%. Enemies don't look very threatening and the attack animations for Esper and Warrior are not very exciting. I couldn't even tell what the warrior was doing to knock my opponents down. It is annoying to keep clicking the quest name to find out where you are going. Original controls felt awkward. I had to use the Lockdown mod, which oddly enough makes the combat feel similar to TERA and Invictus."

I thought i was quitting because of the bugs, I thought I was quitting because the difficulty forced people away, I thought i was quitting because i didn't like the game....  but that simply wasn't true.  We had this discussion a while back when FTP came up on my guild forums and that discussion really crystallized my belief about what happened.  I'll repost here what I posted there:   IMO, The progression of Wildstar was supposed to be: get to 50->get crafted/daily gear->Run Adventures for Upgrades to crafted gear->Run Dungeons for upgrades to adventure gear->Run GA for upgrades to Dungeon gear->DS.  The point of the Attunement quest was to be a roadmap, not a foot race.  You were intended to do the attunement almost by accident while you were gearing up.  The problem is, we got to 50, Crafted our gear found out it was BIS and then there wasn't a single meaningful upgrade till DS.  6 months of content was instantly invalidated because there was literally no reason to run it.  There was instantly nothing else to do but raid.  People who couldn't hack it had nowhere to go for an upgrade to get an edge on the content.  People who wanted to man up had nowhere to go because raiding guilds were blowing up over bugs, shit class balance and no content.  Look at all the guilds who folded.  When did they fold?  Right after attunement and the first few raids.  People got bored of raid-logging and the god-awful daily quests.  Without the push to progress through attunement and gear grind there was no point.  It is the same reason why every single MMO has failed  since people started copying WOW.  People may say they want dailies and easy mode... and sure, some do... but real MMO players want grind.  Good grind, Grind that leads to progression.  Wildstar failed to deliver that, Just like SWTOR, FFXIV, and everyone else that has stepped into the modern MMO space.    Just saying ""shits too hard"" is missing the big point.  Back when we all first started playing MMOs and no one knew how to raid, raiding was fucking insanely hard.  But you saw that guy standing in town in full tier gear and you said ""fuck it, I'ma be wearing that shit someday"" and you made it happen.  You leveled up, you spent hours crafting and gathering.  You ran dungeons till your eyes dried out farming drops until you could hack it.  That's what MMOs are about, and that's whats missing.    People dont wax nostalgic about the easy raids in vanilla wow, they remember getting crushed in molten core, they remember running dungeons for days, same with EQ, EQ2, and every other early MMO And ever since that has changed, MMOs have been dying.  It isn't because MMOs aren't delivering casual content, it's because they are trying to pervert MMOs into a fucking mobile app mentality and that isn't going to work.   I've pondered coming back to Wildstar with word of all the bug fixes and things... but they still really never solved the problem.  Outside of raids, what am i going to do?  I can run a dungeon, but why would i?  I can run an adventure, but what's the point?  In all those classic MMO's there was always a reason to be out and in the world and running dungeons.  There were the 1% drop items, there was rep-grid-via-dungeon-running, there was a community of people to play with who were all trying to achieve something out there.... now all we have is the solo quest dailies and things getting nerfed to be ""more accessible"" which, lets face it, hasn't worked in any MMO, ever.    In the end, about the only thing I think will bring me back is a hard-reset.  A level cap increase with new progression, which will hopefully be actual progression not only in difficulty but in rewarding gear and content with replayability.  Beyond that... the game i fell in love with and hyped so hard for so long is no more worth logging into than wow, rift, archeage, SWTOR or any other new modern MMO with solo quest dailies instead of real content."

Meanwhile the type of MMO you seem to be clamoring for is distinctly unsuccessful outside of Korea.  I agree that the itemization was a SNAFU at launch and a detriment to the game though.  edit I also agree with your post further down about there not being as much for an established player to do."

It is also proof that if you stick to your vision and deliver a finished product that is true to that vision instead of caving you can wind up being the second biggest MMO on the market without resorting to FTP or degrading your content to meet some expectation.  Obviously what I said above is colored by my own preferences, but I still stand by it.  I think if Wildstar launched as the game that was with changes I outlined it could have been a Monster.  But instead people are going to say ""look, Wildstar failed because people don't  want a hadcore MMO"" when most people just wanted an MMO with less bugs, Better balance, and relevant progression/a reason to do the available content."

Give me open world immersion on my way to Raiding and continue even when I am raiding. Otherwise like he said, whats the point?    I still don't understand why one of these MMO's doesn't just implement a horizontal progression path in an expansion. EQ did it way back when and every game I have tried has failed to even attempt something like that.

MMORPG,3ddck6,unloco,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:31:00 2015 UTC,"The game right now is exactly in the progression you are talking about, since crafted gear are now bad. You get to 50, grind shiphands for some decent gear, than adventures/dungeons depending of your abilities, than GA, and DS.  The exception to the rule would be to get power-geared through GA/DS as a fresh lvl 50, which is only happening with alts of the few guilds who actually have DS on farm.  I took me an entire year of ~30h a day to progress through GA/DS and farm/grind pretty much I could farm/grind for. There are now pets to farm in dungeons/adventures as well as some unique trophy décors. Contracts are an other new type of grind that I found fun while there was still things to farm with.  But I always figured that if you can't raid, WS is just an average decent MMO, while if you can raid it becomes one of the best."

MMORPG,3ddck6,Nightmare2828,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:13:56 2015 UTC,What guild did you raid with? I quit mid-way through DS because I knew after they nerfed armor penetration gadgets it would be a 6+ month grind to kill the other buggy bosses and eventually Avatus. My guild(Enigma) ended up world first Avatus but many months later as predicted. The fact that the game was so badly tuned was a big issue for me personally. A raid shouldn't last the better part of a year even for the most hardcore progression oriented guilds.  Another issue was their lack of class and stat balance. The lack of Warriors killed my first guild(CKN) as we couldn't progress without competent Warrior DPS(which we only had one of). Things like power link also killed the competitive DPS-ranking side of the game that usually keeps me going through terrible farming/grinding periods in MMOs.

Getting silver medals in dungeons was a massive pain as well as any other part of attunement since no1 was helping another, as as soon as they had completed it they never helped out those who needed it.  Also the skill factor just turned into an ""have x interupt and use it here"".   And the final nail in the coffin was rng based rune slots.

MMORPG,3ddck6,maybebaked,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:27:28 2015 UTC,"As someone who just recently unsubbed having been there since early access my problems with the game generally had to do with the type of content available, the pace new content was being released, and performance.  The content that has been added in just over the year the game's been out has either felt like it was stuff that didn't make it in by launch or has been flat out confirmed to have been. Much of the content is great for newer players, it gives them a path to progress through. As a player already past that point though, vet shiphands were fun for a couple runs and that's it. Adventures are fun for a couple runs, etc.  Dungeons were always fun, unfortunately there are only 5 (6 if counting the intro dungeon). 1 (2) dungeons have been added since launch. After a year +, they start to lose their luster.  Raiding is also fun, but with only 2 raids even if you haven't cleared DS you would like some variety to play around with. Unfortunately the next raid tier isn't coming in drop 6 and there isn't any word of drop 7 going on at all right now. That means it's at least 4 months away if in drop 7. That will have been nearly 18 months without a new raid tier.  So for a player like me, I simply ran out of things I wanted to do. My guild was still progressing through DS (7/9), but raiding in this game is expensive. The options for making money in the game are fairly limited to grinding content I don't enjoy doing. I was spending a fair amount of time doing things I didn't want to do and didn't enjoy just to get to what I did enjoy. I finally burnt out."

MMORPG,3ddck6,DigitalAbuse,0,Wed Jul 15 14:10:22 2015 UTC,"Loved the game, but the end game kept creeping closer and closer and I was not and still won't be a ""hardcore bro"" so I quit after I leveled two tools up to max level. I'd go back if they made it more casual and even through in a LFR type wow thing. PvP was awesome and healing was a lot of fun."
MMORPG,3ddck6,Bigspang88,0,Wed Jul 15 11:38:56 2015 UTC,"All the guys commenting on:  1) Leveling  2) Optimization  3) Gear progression  4) Low population  Will be pleasantly surprised by the game at F2P release, because those are all things that Carbine already worked on while listening on the community.  A dev team who actually listens to the community and even plays with them (yesterday's bgs runs with devs were awesome) is something that really a few games can have.  They always showed interest and passion for the game and this is why I stick with the game even with the bad launch."

Not sure how close they are but they're at least both Android and not locked to the Amazon store.  I've tried a few different MMOs on tablets. Izanagi Online is a fairly smooth experience and, while not ideal, I don't mind it in the least. The biggest problem is that there aren't a whole lot of ""traditional"" MMOs on tablets to begin with. Most are more casual, consisting of auto-battling or are primarily contained within menus.  Order and Chaos was also a good attempt at moving a ""traditional"" MMO to mobile but I had issues with how small the world felt - at launch, at least. It felt like it got too crowded too quickly."

MMORPG,3ders1,Hellthrower,4,Wed Jul 15 18:27:17 2015 UTC,If you plan to PvP the play guildwars. If you plan to PvE play FFXIV - combat is better in guild wars but FFXIV has an actual end game to it so the choice is yours.  You could also just play both and Raid/Dungeon in FFXIV and do PvP in GW2.

MMORPG,3ders1,Juniterio,2,Thu Jul 16 00:29:05 2015 UTC,gw2 is not the typical gear treadmill raid mmo.
MMORPG,3ders1,Micro2Cuts,2,Thu Jul 16 07:36:49 2015 UTC,"Unlikely. GW2 is not designed around perpetual gear progression, and they've tried to do   Starting with the expansion GW2 will get a reworking of their NPC AI, with the goal of allowing for much more challenging encounters, akin to high-end content you'd typically find locked away in a raid dungeon in other MMOs, but it's not going to be tied to a linear progression path."
MMORPG,3ders1,Naqaj_,-1,Thu Jul 16 13:45:45 2015 UTC,No it will not have raids.
MMORPG,3ders1,CMD_TakeDOwn,0,Wed Jul 15 23:40:35 2015 UTC,"Bullshit, they said Challenging Group PvE content will be a big part of the expansion. They just haven't announced it yet but we had a HUGE raiding CDI and most of the peps said   *No RNG  *Instanced  *More roles to fill  *Make healing tanking, boon stripping and other game mechanics more important  On Guild Hall CDI that started even earlier people said they want to have big guild halls map they can customise and they wanted buildings to be actually meaningful - and Anet listened."
MMORPG,3ders1,Juniterio,0,Thu Jul 16 00:23:14 2015 UTC,Notice how non of these things require a progression raid design.
MMORPG,3ders1,Naqaj_,2,Thu Jul 16 13:47:57 2015 UTC,"By raids I think challenging instanced group content, nothing more. Progression is something else."
MMORPG,3ders1,Juniterio,3,Thu Jul 16 14:35:47 2015 UTC,"Well, they offer different things.  GW2 has a heavy focus on PvP. If you like PvP, then it's the game for you! The PvE elements are there but not as in-depth, such as instances being a joke because you just zerg them. Exploration is nice, the world is very pretty, and you won't find as many loading screens as you will in FF14. Classes are also much more open to customization.  In FF14, if you're a paladin, you're going to be the same as every other paladin (asides from gear), so there isn't a lot in the way of customization. However, the PvE is most important here. There's more complicated crafting than GW2, housing, and just other activities to do. The main quest, I feel, is much more interesting than GW2, although neither are stellar. Instances have the holy trinity, and higher level content will require some coordination to complete. Also FF14 is unique in that one character can complete everything in the game, including classes, so you don't need alts. It always annoyed me how GW2 doesn't give you enough character slots for all the classes.  So basically if you're really into PvP, get GW2, and if you're more into a themepark MMO that offers everything but doesn't necessarily excel at everything, then get FF14.   In terms of community, GW2 has more hardcore or elitist people involved, and will overall be more populated because it's b2p. FF14 has mostly casual players who tend to be very friendly and talkative.   Personally, I think FF14 is the better MMO. I like the aesthetic more and the lore behind Final Fantasy. I always felt like GW2 promised a lot that it never lived up to, or the final product came out much less involved than what they stated it would be. FF14 also comes out with large content patches on time, even ones that include new classes, so I feel like you get more bang for your buck."
MMORPG,3ders1,jamiejokes,2,Wed Jul 15 18:37:49 2015 UTC,"Agree with most except a few things. FFXIV excels at a number of things, namely story content and PvE content. Although their ability to offer a meaningful variety of other activities aside from the dungeon grind is something you don't see in a lot of other MMO's. Also the community has quite a lot of hardcore players and elitists actually, as much as any other MMO that focuses so much on endgame group PvE content.  I would actually argue that GW2 doesn't really have a lot of hardcore or elitist players anymore. Most of them left within the first year. It's far more casual in most ways and has been for a long time. Certainly you can play FFXIV on a casual level as well, but GW2 just seems to be lacking a lot of stickiness for an average player and not much for a hardcore player to really, well, be honestly hardcore about."
MMORPG,3ders1,Leiloni,6,Wed Jul 15 20:50:34 2015 UTC,"They are both very different games. GW2 for me is miles ahead of FFXIV, in combat, PVP, exploration, immersion, and sense of adventure.   GW2 offers more variety in content. At max level I can do sPvP, WvW, several mini games, Jumping puzzles, open world dungeons, World bosses, traditional dungeons, Fractals, Open world events and several scavenger hunts. All content allows me to progress.  GW2 is also much better value. It is buy to play and updates frequently.  FFXIV on the other hand has better instanced content right now and if you like vertical progression then you should probably go for FFXIV instead of GW2."
MMORPG,3ders1,atatahir,3,Wed Jul 15 22:50:18 2015 UTC,I've found GW2 updates severely underwhelming ever since release. I would rather GW2 have a subscription and put out as much content updates as FFXIV does.
MMORPG,3ders1,Goronmon,2,Thu Jul 16 03:32:56 2015 UTC,"After getting burnt by WoD, it's hard for me to trust companies to turn the money you give them into content updates. A company like Blizzard makes billions off of WoW, just they churned out WoD :("

MMORPG,3ders1,Bolaumius,3,Fri Jul 17 04:11:34 2015 UTC,Both are very good but i prefer GW2. FFXIV is to much asian-style and i don't like the slow combat.
MMORPG,3ders1,Micro2Cuts,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:24:30 2015 UTC,"GW2 player here who started playing FFXIV three weeks ago. My opinion's slightly skewed because FFXIV is shinier, but I'm finding FFXIV to be a better game right now and I'm not sure if GW2 is going to pull me back in when their expansion comes back.  As someone who enjoys PvE content and stories, the solo-questing in FFXIV has been more enjoyable than GW2. I like the ability to switch classes/roles. The dungeons in FFXIV have been more fun than GW2's. The thing I didn't like about GW2's dungeons is that your character's there to assist the protagonists of the GW2 world and you're some lackey/lieutenant.   The things I don't currently like about FFXIV is the market system. I find the UI for it to be clunky."
MMORPG,3ders1,aninogaming,0,Fri Jul 17 17:04:58 2015 UTC,"ive been playing gw2 and ffxiv (since 1.0) for past few years, got 8 legendaries in gw2 and 2 legendaries in ffxiv.  i would like to say, if you like more group PvP,dynamic playstyle - then gw2 is the game for you. if you like more slow, animation, end game raid etc, then ffxiv. FFXIV's pvp really bad."
MMORPG,3ders1,jasonxjia,0,Tue Jul 21 04:42:46 2015 UTC,"They're both Theme Parks but at least GW2 tries to do something different. Fails at it, but hey. Better than doing same shit as everyone else for the past decade like FFXIV."

MMORPG,3ders1,BuraisonFujii,3,Fri Jul 17 03:09:40 2015 UTC,"As much as I would like to argue that Guild Wars 2 has its redeeming factors, the simple truth, I feel, is that it's not worth devoting any time into after you hit LV80. Considering you can hit 80 in a couple days even casually, I don't feel it has a lot of value. Nothing after the leveling process gives any tangible benefit.   They both have their new expansions, but with GW2's being significantly smaller, only one new class, specializations, and one (admittedly very large) new area compared to FFXIV's 3 new classes, new race, and 9 new mostly large areas, Heavensward's a much more valuable expansion. And with ANet charging 50 dollars for Heart of Thorns, I have difficulty recommending that route to anyone aside from people that highly value grinding for weeks for cosmetic benefits.  Experience: I played GW2 on and off for two years, and the feeling of wasting my time never went away. Got all classes to 80, then saw no reason to continue playing. It's a real shame, because everything other than the content in the game is incredibly solid and polished."
MMORPG,3ders1,enternius,0,Wed Jul 15 18:38:41 2015 UTC,"GW2 is not adding 1 zone, it is adding one region which includes several zones. Expansion is still in development and the number of zones is not known.  Each zone also supposed to have multiple levels effectively doubling or even tripling the explorable area. Zones in GW2 are also much richer and much more expansive than FFXIV zones.  GW2 is also introducing 9 new sub classes (specializations) and 1 new class. One sub class in GW2 comes with a new weapon, new class skills, new trait sets and a unique class mechanic, which is pretty much equivalent to a job in FFXIV."
MMORPG,3ders1,atatahir,-3,Wed Jul 15 22:58:08 2015 UTC,"GW2 is great till maximum level, then it bores extremly fast. FFXIV is the exact opposite.  It basically comes down if your a PvE or PvP player. When PvP take GW2 since FFXIV does basically not have any PvP (okay, it actually does, but it is death) while FFXIV does clearly have the better PvE endgame."
MMORPG,3ders1,Cyrotek,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:46:00 2015 UTC,"FFXIV if you want heavily instanced city (A single city split up into 3+ zones..seriously?)  And heavily instanced and tiny maps  and also, if you're playing from EU, you'll have a high ping to enjoy on top of the 2.5 second global cooldown. As the servers are located in Canada.  Roleplay is very much alive on GW2 as well (Eu side) if you're into that."
MMORPG,3ders1,Sarpy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:27:03 2015 UTC,"That said, I never had issues with fps or lag with FFXIV, but my god does GW2 suffer for trying to stuff so many people into one place.  Cities often suffer a little fps drops, though the grove and rata sum are pretty harsh.  World bosses tank all but the best pcs or anyone running anything past low settings.  Sure, it was instanced, but I don't recall having as many painfully long loading screens in FFXIV as I do with GW2.  Just logging in is a pain.  Load into major city, bring up map and load into desired map, find out what you need isn't on that map and check group finder and join in another map.  Or load into a map for a story instance and then load into the story instance.  Or load into a map just to load into a dungeon on that map.  So many damn loading screens that last too damn long on my SSD drives me bonkers."
MMORPG,3ders1,Ralanost,0,Wed Jul 15 19:48:36 2015 UTC,"Well, I am from Europe and I am connected to European server in FFXIV but i still experience a slight delay in damage applied on mobs, like 0.3-0.5 secs. You kinda get used to it, but it's not like other mmos where damage is applies as soon as the visual effect of your skill takes place."
MMORPG,3ders1,NetSage,0,Wed Jul 15 19:53:31 2015 UTC,This is because currently there are no true European servers.  They are located in Canada with the NA ones right now.  Rumor is they'll eventually get up a EU datacenter since the game is a success but well get used to a bit of latency :P.
MMORPG,3ders1,AvalonBright,-1,Thu Jul 16 00:00:38 2015 UTC,"Oh jesus christ, this is so true. I haven't played GW2 in like two years so I completely forgot about what a nightmare their loading screens are. FFXIV might be instanced but good god at least it only takes a couple seconds to load anywhere."
MMORPG,3ders1,jamiejokes,-3,Wed Jul 15 22:46:25 2015 UTC,"Each major city in FF14 has 2 areas of decent size. I think it's more split on the PS3 version but I wouldn't recommend playing on a console anyway.   The zones are separated by east, north, west, central, etc. with some being very large and others being smaller, island-like areas.   It does kind of ruin the sense of exploring the world, such as in WoW when you'd run from zone to zone. There is a nice variety though. From islands to lush forests, to tundras and sand dunes.  You get over it. Loading screens aren't long and in some situations it can be beneficial to split the areas. Instead of getting lost in one huge main city (my first time in Undercity, I just rage-quit xD), you can simplify things a bit."
MMORPG,3ders1,AvalonBright,3,Wed Jul 15 22:02:19 2015 UTC,tiny maps   Haaaaaaaaahahahahahaha.

GW2 is also a very fun first playthrough, but I don't think it's the kind of game you can play for months on end after you hit the level cap. Once you get your character looking how you want, you're pretty much done.  I should mention I'm a former GW2 player with three lvl 80s."

MMORPG,3ders1,Sarpy,3,Wed Jul 15 20:22:38 2015 UTC,"simple, GW2 only has 5 skills, FF14 is the generic mmo where you have many skills that you need to use in clever rotation with global cooldown instead of smashing all skills for a burst. not saying that GW2 combat wasnt fun, it was great, but ff14 is good as well, and you get used to it"
MMORPG,3ders1,Momoko_Tomoko,0,Wed Jul 15 20:43:54 2015 UTC,"simple, GW2 only has 5 skills   lol  okay you never played GW2"
MMORPG,3ders1,NetSage,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:29:18 2015 UTC,"""gw2 only has five skills""  You mean 10? Utility skills. And even more if you play a class like Ele, switching between elements and such  And most classes allow you to switch between weapons in combat, adding more divercity.  FFXIV may let you pick what weapon skills you want, but, at end-game. You use the same skills as everyone else and use a generic 'build' or you'll just get kicked for not being good enough, so you end up using the same skills throughout the whole of FFXIV.  FFXIV's combat turns into a repetitive rotation that -really- gets dull after a while. in GW2 you have combo's and finishers, you need to plan quite a bit. The rotations are far more difficult and intuitive/situational."
MMORPG,3ders1,Heavykiller,0,Wed Jul 15 20:59:10 2015 UTC,It's a rotation but the rotation gets really long with the amount of skills at the end game. Plus once you fight a real boss rotations get thrown out the window as mechanics will mess you up. Your rotation has a core theme but needs to be flexible in a real fight.
MMORPG,3ders1,Bainik,0,Wed Jul 15 23:23:47 2015 UTC,For me FFXIV far and wide.  I just couldn't really get into GW2 even though I was there from launch.  It's not a bad game but it's not my cup of tea.  FFXIV is a lot more traditional and I find it to be a lot more fun personally.  The only thing I don't like is all the loading screens but they're extremely short and at the end of day you'll probably be teleporting most places and not care.
MMORPG,3dcq6i,Serifan,7,Wed Jul 15 06:23:45 2015 UTC,"I wonder why there aren't communities here funding servers themselves.  Surely if its too expensive to host in Australia for game developers, then they could get folks here to donate extra voluntarily to keep the server up.  I'd happily pay an extra $5-10 a month on top of a subscription fee if it meant I could play games I would otherwise would have to pass on.

MMORPG,3dcq6i,xDialtone,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:49:00 2015 UTC,"It's extremely more expensive compared to other places to set up a data center in AUS for foreign companies than you think because of the Intangible goods act. The fact that internet and telecommunications in AUS is entirely privatized means that companies have to pay even more against the monopolies there because it's not regulated properly. Companies practically have to bribe to set things up in AUS.  Internet in AUS is anywhere between 15-20x the cost of bandwidth compared to Europe and around 10-12x the cost of NA. It doesn't help that EU has over 30 times the population of AUS  Cooling is also another issue, while data centers are cooled to keep the servers cooled, it's harder and more expensive to protect against outside heat as well as weather.  There's a reason that only big companies such as BlizzardActivision and Riot have OCE servers, it's because they have the money to do so."
MMORPG,3dcq6i,sebaajhenza,2,Wed Jul 15 23:19:25 2015 UTC,"But what's stopping them from charging more per month? I'm well aware it's expensive here, and happy to pay more if that's the only barrier."
MMORPG,3dcq6i,SpartanVXL,5,Thu Jul 16 02:05:31 2015 UTC,"Getting a server installed and associated bandwidth costs for a rack in a Sydney datacentre usually isn't worth it for companies. They look at the cost and much rather have aus/nz spend money to play on west coast servers instead of setting up something down here. Only the most popular games will usually bother, like Blizzard or those who started out here (Grinding Gear Games who made Path of Exile is a NZ company, even then they started out with a CA server).  Theres also licensing conundrums, ""digital tax"" as well as internet restrictions that the aussie gov is trying to push which drives most game services away. They take a look at what it takes to get something running versus the population that would pay (overpriced) money to play and go ""Naaaah, not even ay"".  Then again its the way its always been done. Have to live with hoping for a West coast or Texas server. Fun fact, if you live in sydney with a decent connection and routing then you get less ping to Japan servers vs US. FFXIV has a lot of aussies on JP simply because you can get 120~ms to them.  Connection distance picture  Connection with quantum networks  Also there are the naysayers, people who don't want to have a SEA/Aus server because of a community reason or otherwise. Those who dislike being stuck with Thais/SG players and would rather just play with Americans regardless of ping. I still remember the thread on Riot's forums over a Aus League of Legends server and the amount of people that came out of the woodwork that didn't want their accounts on the Aus server."

As for the question of lag, developers should look better into their server coding. I live in Brazil, play on Japanese PSO2 and the only reason I lag at times is because my ISP has been having issues at peak hours. Other than that, I have a pretty smooth experience and the other day actually saw Japaneses lagging more than me (to be fair the whole game was laggy because of an event, but regional players lagging more than one across the ocean is uncanny)."
MMORPG,3dcq6i,Soperos,-2,Wed Jul 15 09:29:07 2015 UTC,It's not a right it's a privilege.
MMORPG,3dcq6i,Soperos,2,Wed Jul 15 11:42:52 2015 UTC,Well technically Australian consumer law says differently but I don't really want to go into it :)
MMORPG,3dcq6i,Soperos,0,Wed Jul 15 12:04:22 2015 UTC,It says these companies are obligated to make Australian servers? Weird.
MMORPG,3dcq6i,Mivimivi,3,Wed Jul 15 13:29:59 2015 UTC,Well no but the way the consumer law is written in Australia you could in theory claim your money back due to the game not being an optimal experience and if you wanted to be that guy you could have a claim but that would be a ridiculous move.
MMORPG,3dcq6i,derkrieger,2,Wed Jul 15 13:58:55 2015 UTC,If it's the law I don't think it's ridiculous at all. You're entitled to a refund.   Btw do you play Albion with a similar name?
MMORPG,3dcq6i,Reindheart,2,Wed Jul 15 16:09:43 2015 UTC,"atleast sound fair. in europe there is this law that state that you can claim all your money back spent on virtual goods even if you used them to the fullest and had an optimal experience. this force companies to remove your right to chargeback money right at the registration phase, but because the right of chargeback: yes or no, is still grey area, many players still do it therefore to european companies are forced to monetize harder the games they publish there. compared to the same games produced on another continent. as a developer and a gamer these laws make me fell like the hobbits into mordor lol"
MMORPG,3dcq6i,Ilandar,0,Wed Jul 15 17:27:06 2015 UTC,Yet another reason putting  up aussie servers sounds like more of a pain than a gain unfortunately
MMORPG,3dcq6i,Haragan,2,Wed Jul 15 15:07:40 2015 UTC,"I know exactly what you mean. Apart from WoW which has Oceanic servers, every other mmorpg seems to have forgotten about Australia despite our relatively large playerbase."
MMORPG,3dcq6i,Ilandar,0,Wed Jul 15 07:36:23 2015 UTC,"SWTOR had three Oceanic servers but BioWare made too many, failed to address the subsequent population issues and then closed them completely instead of merging the three into one.  Planetside 2 has an Australian server but it's struggling due to, once again, neglect from the developer. Login issues have plagued Briggs for years and caused over 50% of the population to quit yet a solution has never been SOE/DGC's priority."
MMORPG,3dcq6i,Cronyx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:57:32 2015 UTC,Planetside 2 is an actual mmorpg? I thought it was like zones with like 50 people in it or something.

It sucks, but money has to be spent where it turns the most profit.    Most games, at least big companies have full teams that do market research, and I'm sure they come to the conclusion based on much information/variables to determine the return for investing in the Oceanic region is not worth it.    Don't take this as me not wanting you to get servers, I know how much crap ping sucks, and I wish every one could have at least sub 100 ping."

It might be cost/effective, but why spend that extra money when they can get your money with the servers they have now?  It's frustrating for sure, and I have a lot of respect for any company that provides servers for their games in Oceanic regions."

I was in a toxic guild I understood after I quit, but stuff like that just bums me out. I also was looking for another guild but couldn't find one that matched up with mine and my brother's raiding schedule.   At the moment I'm searching for an MMO to play after a year or so break from the genre.

MMORPG,3ddrrj,Joe2030,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:12:55 2015 UTC,"It's changed for me over the years that I've played MMOs. Back when I played Everquest and then Dark Age of Camelot, I was new to what an MMO was and the whole experience was based around me discovering the games and their worlds. In Dark Age, I eventually made friends and we all played off and on together until things happened with the game's development that pushed us away for good. Some time later, Warhammer Online released and I met up with the same group for our next chapter.  Not too long into that journey they decided the game wasn't for them. I had my own problems with it, but I could largely ignore them. I had also started blogging about the game and being a part of that burgeoning community outside the game helped to keep me interested. But, with my normal crew gone I had to find a new group and via those blogging connections met up with a gang that I still play games with today.  Anymore we're all hopeful for the next one and we always jump into almost any new MMO, even if we know it won't last, because we know that that first month will be a hoot just because we're together and we love being stupid around each other. In between those new releases (which are getting fewer and fewer) we tend to hop around in whatever MMO strikes our individual fancies, even if we're not playing together."

I can't remember the exact details but I believe the game was being changed into a freemium model. Lots of members were really bummed by the patch and started quitting. The guild leader and few key members suggested migrating to another game, Silk Road Online. Roughly 50% of the guild made it over but it just never felt the same. Having to learn a new game and starting from scratch removed the community appeal. Within a week, everyone stopped logging on and things just died out."

The raid leader was an aggressive self important jerk that couldn't teach anything without insulting you 3-4 times between two ordinary comments... Wildstar isn't that hard but with all the hardcore statements, it appealed to the worst scum of the MMO playerbase.  When my guild died in Neverwinter, on the other hand, I sticked around for a year and a half after that, because I was really good at it and had a decent friendlist. I had a really awesome team for a few months but then two of them left and I was on my own so it was time to make a break for me too.  Now I realize that atmosphere is what matters when you play an MMO."
MMORPG,3ddrrj,Plugawy_Nedznik,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:04:46 2015 UTC,"I've had bad experiences joining a new guild after my old one disbanded in general. They weren't necessarily toxic or aggressive. It just wasn't the same anymore.  I spend, on average, 200 hours on an MMO. That's more than enough time to bond with the ""friends"" you made within your guild. You spent a lot of time talking and fooling around. Discovering new things and working together towards achieving a set of goals.  It just won't be the same if you join another guild."
MMORPG,3ddrrj,Rajron,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:29:11 2015 UTC,"While looking/waiting for a game to play, I decided to give a ""social, relaxed, slice-of-life"" MMO another shot as a last resort. Cough cough, Mabinogi. I never really enjoyed the game, but since I really just wanted a group of people to play with, I joined a guild and concluded everyone is the same there. They're all crazy 14-year-olds. So I left the game for good.   I've spent some time playing the games by PWE, and had bad luck with guilds. The guilds weren't particularly ""dead"", but the guilds I ended up with were small and cliquey. So I left those games too.   Not the same situations as you describe, but similar. If I can't find cool people to play with, I won't stick with a game no matter how ""good"" it is. Yes, even the games that this reddit (and all MMO forums for that matter) recommends over and over. Since I'm rather selective of guilds I do join in the first place, I won't have a reason to stay because I find the game's community to be lousy and I play online games to interact with others."

Web is perfectly usable (though PTT requires browser focus), downloable clients are a better experience for long term use.  For 'get someone in here so we can talk together,' via the web flow, we've found it really fast and easy.  edit: The thing that made it very easy was just being able to paste someone a link, then having them click it and just magically show up in your text or voice chat.

Black Desert Online will allow me, if I want, in focusing completely on just trade. Growing an economic power house of a business. The game itself uses its own engine allowing for it to have amazing graphics. They use a worldwide weather system which is cool to me, where as WoW was just localized weather. The jumping and climbing is probably more realistic than other mmorpgs, since it is a parkour system.

Lots of custom content and higher level cap along with xp & drop rates increased a bunch.

MMORPG,3dev1i,All7hatRemains,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:50:14 2015 UTC,I was looking on the forums and they said open beta is coming out in around 2 weeks or so. I'd estimate around late fall for release.
MMORPG,3ddx19,indelibleinfatuation,7,Wed Jul 15 14:46:53 2015 UTC,ff14 is known to be mediocre in the pvp department
MMORPG,3ddx19,valmendor,3,Wed Jul 15 14:49:05 2015 UTC,"Everything that has been said so far about FF14 is pretty spot on. I actually raided very heavily for a while before Heavensward dropped. It is a visually-stunning game. I mean the graphics are just top notch.  Combat is great and fluid. Dungeons and Raids are very difficult in some areas but for the most part this is where the game suffers. I can auto-pilot every single dungeon as a healer and even some of the raids. It's just so boring.   The problem with FF14 is that there is not any danger. You can freely run through the open world without having to worry about death and, hey, if you do die, you can just insta-port back to wherever you were. That just doesn't do it for me in the MMO space.   And sadly - the PVP blows. This was what finally made me stop playing (I still have my sub as its the ONLY MMO that my wife will play). So I guess I still login and play and see whats up with the guild and whatnot. But it really feels more like a lobby MMO. I just que for my dungeon/raid, do my dailys which I que for as well, and it just isn't all that enjoyable anymore. I usually PVP when my PVE enjoyment stagnates or dies. That isn't possible with this game.  Let's hop they fix the god-awful PVP situation and I can get back to playing some FF14. That said: I am currently playing ESO (on PS4 its immersive as all hell) and on an emulated EQ server as always. :D"
MMORPG,3ddx19,EQCazik,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:09:33 2015 UTC,"The honest opinion is appreciated. Good to hear about some of the cons to it as well.  You mentioned you play EQ, do you know anything about EQ Next? Last I checked it was in closed beta, have you tried it?"
MMORPG,3ddx19,EQCazik,2,Wed Jul 15 18:30:21 2015 UTC,I actually follow that reddit feverishly and it's coming along I suppose. We are still a ways off but I firmly believe it will be made and it will be good. Lot's of naysayers and negative opinions on that subreddit but I do like keeping up and following what the devs/game designers are doing. So it's cool for that.   But no - it is not even in Alpha yet. Landmark (which is the voxel building game) is what they are saying is in closed beta but it really looks and feels like an Alpha as well. You can look at some of the combat and building videos for Landmark. If that's what we're going off of then I think the game is headed in the right direction but they don't even have character models yet or at least they haven't been shown. So we'll see I guess. Personally I am expecting a 2017 release but I hope I'm wrong.   If they take that long to make it then it will be worth it and it will be the sandbox MMO that crushes them all. If they do it right. Black Desert also shows alot of promise. That game looks like it could be insanely good. I just don't have the energy or want to put the effort into trying to play in an overseas market. So I'll wait for Black Desert to come to NA. :D
MMORPG,3ddx19,EQCazik,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:36:01 2015 UTC,"Ahh my mistake; I was definitely thinking of Landmark haha. But I see, still a while for that then.  Black Desert is the one with the incredibly good graphics right? Is there a timeslot for when that finally comes to NA?"
MMORPG,3ddx19,Hydrolac,2,Wed Jul 15 18:43:29 2015 UTC,Yeah BD look's fairly great from what I have seen graphically. There have been some rumblings of us getting a NA release sometime in 2016. I think that could be accurate for PC but they have mentioned wanting to do a PS4 release as well so that could end up getting pushed back. I have high hopes for BD to hit PC next year.
MMORPG,3ddx19,EQCazik,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:30:01 2015 UTC,"I would be wary for BD- at least until everyone sees how the RU version will turn out, or even just more content updates for the KR version. It hasn't lived up to the hype for most people- especially me."
MMORPG,3ddx19,Hydrolac,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:28:59 2015 UTC,Have you played it?!?! I was going to post something on their subreddit and just decided not to as I wasn't expecting a large response.   The impressions I've gotten from YouTube so far make me feel like it'll be good. I like the open world raid bosses. What kind of drawbacks/missed opportunities have you noticed?
MMORPG,3ddx19,EQCazik,2,Wed Jul 15 21:56:03 2015 UTC,"Yep, I have certainly forced myself to play the game over the course of 5 months. Recently stopped playing due to boredom and maplestory 2. There is basically only one open world raid boss right now. Avoid watching any videos before January as those are usually CBT videos. They do not represent the  current state of the game in korea, and I mean this sincerely. That's exactly what I thought would happen months ago. For me, my problem was the very little encouragement for party play. The name of the game is PvP for me, and that led to very mild pve content (mob grindfest, the same EXACT daily boss, and a rotation of previous weekly bosses.) Guild vs guild  was pretty fun at first, and now it has become bland. The new open faction PvP with no penalty is fun, but it seems to just be a lame band-aid for a bigger issue. There is the option of open world pvp. I haven't had much experience with it because there are severe penalties that usually no one would even bother to touch you. If you attack/kill someone, you get a harsh and large karma penalty, and others can easily slay you with little/no penalty depending on karma. You also have to grind a ton of mobs to get back to positive karma, so it's basically pointless to open world pvp. Open world bosses removed, the aesthetics of the game were partially destroyed because of the glowing effects for quests, npcs, and such. Some places can get really neat during certain weather effects. Night time does not feel immersive with all the glowy stuff as compared to the CBT videos. Let me emphasize the fact that you don't really need any party play. You might need a person or two for weekly boss summon scrolls or ones that you find. The one world boss that you can fight spawns every 8 hours, and it isn't consistent (no set timer) You may end up spending up to 20-30 minutes for absolutely nothing. It is of no challenge to fight at all. You just have to do one lame mechanic where you have to run behind a pillar or you die. Potion spamming is a big problem as well for pvp. They have done a few changes to potions to prevent the spamming, but it can all be avoided. It's what makes pvp fights last longer, but that should not be the solution for more immersive and fun pvp fights.  There are a lot more problems that I would not have enough knowledge to explain as well as the one listed. You can find those opinions pretty much anywhere.  On the other hand, the game has beautiful graphics (which could have been a lot more immersive...), but does not really offer much of a PvE challenge at all- grinding mobs is usually what people do when they have finished with all of the node stuff. The node stuff such as farming, trading and fishing can get pretty confusing to beginners. The feature is quite nice since you can make money through all of the means. Investing in certain nodes for monsters can make drop rates up to about 50% higher... you grind more mobs for drops. I never got to test the CBT, but it sounds 3x better than the current state. The sad part is, I've spent the past 7 days playing maplestory 2 the whole day. Why? Because it has given me almost all that I've wanted in black desert- all on a smaller scale, but it is still there. I don't like how people list black desert as ""an another korean grind game"" because it is very casual- as intended from the korean publisher. It is quite true, but you can't just push aside all of the other features it contains.  TL;DR The black desert you saw in CBT seemed to be very deserving of the hype, but with the korean publisher handling NA and- EU? publishing might cause some big trouble. Also, we don't know if pearl abyss (the devs) are restricting the other well-received features for the RU version. Only time will tell."
MMORPG,3ddx19,Hydrolac,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:17:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the write up man. Appreciate it.   Sad to hear, though. I was really hoping that game would present a big challenge. It sounds like all the open world systems and peices are in place but the difficulty isn't? I tend to like grindy MMO's but this doesn't sound like a satisfying grind. It sounds mind-numbing and unrewarding. I will probably just pick it up as PS4 game to play w/ the wife - maybe that'll get her off FF. The killer is the lack of party play. That is really depressing considering the hype this game received.   I think MS2 is a little too cartoony for me.  Back to EQemu!"
MMORPG,3ddx19,lmaonade200,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:07:26 2015 UTC,"Haha, seems to be a large turnaway for ms2 for many people, but it has been the most fun party play I've had in a while- especially with 9 friends (only need 3). Anyway, don't erase bdo off your list just yet, but I am stating the game as I played it over the months. Huge disappointment for me, I even got a new gpu for it."
MMORPG,3ddx19,lmaonade200,2,Thu Jul 16 00:30:40 2015 UTC,"I love FFXIV to death but we should get a few things straight here, the reviews for the recent expansion are to be taken with a grain of salt, I have no doubt in my mind that the expansion content will be absolutely fantastic for me, but reviewers have very little time to actually experience the content, so their reviews are mostly fluff.  Other than that FFXIV deserves a lot of the praise it gets, it is a beautiful game with not only top notch graphics but also top notch art direction and design. Gear customization is not the best I've seen but still fairly robust for a recent MMO. PvP is piss weak, nobody plays PvP because nobody else plays PvP and the developers give it very little attention, the PvP itself is somewhat polished if not unbalanced, but it's the red-headed cousin of content.  I would say it's worth playing, I'm personally having a blast, and yes it does use subscription fees.  If you are looking for a immersive MMO (like world building immersive), there are some other great choices out there also, such as ESO and SWTOR (at least this is what I've heard)"
MMORPG,3ddx19,SaveTheSunF1R3x,0,Wed Jul 15 15:34:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, the game is fully released, it used to have a subscription fee but is now straight up Buy to Play now I believe"
MMORPG,3ddx19,Nightmare2828,2,Wed Jul 15 17:51:28 2015 UTC,Not much i can say that hasn't already been stated in this thread. If immersion is what you're after look no further. However if pvp is your primary focus you might want to wait a week or so to see how our new pvp patch is going to pan out. While many have said that pvp sucks at the very least the devs are actively trying to make it more engaging and we get pvp updates every patch cycle.

The combat system and raids are easily the best in the market, so if you are into raiding, by that I mean 3-4 night a week of 3-4 hours progression, you can't pass over Wildstar :P. It will be F2P in fall (no fix date yet), but you can buy the game which comes with a free month for 10$ on some website, and then buy monthly subscription with ingame money if you play decently, otherwise it would be 15$ a month.  TLDR; if you are into raiding try it now, otherwise i'dd suggest you give it a try when it turns F2P, I'm sure you will hear a lot about it in this subreddit once it happens :P"
MMORPG,3ddx19,Xardos1976,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:45:06 2015 UTC,Ahh okay cool I'll have to watch some Youtube videos of it to get a better idea. Raiding was never my thing though personally so I'll probably wait to try that one out

MMORPG,3ddx19,Plugawy_Nedznik,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:15:14 2015 UTC,"Yep definitely considered that as well, however I heard it was rather mediocre at launch"
MMORPG,3ddx19,Naqaj_,2,Wed Jul 15 15:54:56 2015 UTC,"it had a lot of problems as an MMO at launch (it was a pretty fun played as a single player game though), that they've fixed. There is a ton of phased content in the game, and if somebody was on a different step of a quest from you, you couldn't see them, even in party. This lead to a lot of annoyances when trying to play with friends and guildies. The huge RVR PVP was also pretty badly imbalanced at first too (which really is the selling point for endgame) but they've made a lot of changes that have helped to clean it all up.  It's a fun game, especially now that it's buy to play, and definitely worth it... especially if you can pick it up on sale."
MMORPG,3ddx19,Everspace,2,Wed Jul 15 17:51:56 2015 UTC,"I heard that too.  I didn't play it at launch - I just started on the Xbox a month ago.  I've kept up with news and podcasts over the last year though regarding all the improvements.  But I love elder scrolls so I'm a bit biased.  I'm having a blast so far on the console.  Gameplay is very similar to Skyrim on a console, except with soft-targeting.  Graphics are decent (not bad, not unreal).  Customization is exceptional - there are numerous ways you can build a character.    Group finder still needs work, but they're working on it.  In the last week, at least when your group forms, they now tell you what dungeon your group is ready to do (that wasn't the case a week ago). They still need to probably allow a clearer option to actually GET to that dungeon though.  However, they want to stay immersive and I get that (they'd rather you find the dungeon on your own first rather than just teleporting to it randomly)"

After a quick research on prices, I turned most in excubes and NPCd the rest. In my first playthrough of FFXII I tried to keep a clean inventory, but now on NG+ it's almost madness as I try to keep track of materials and accessories. I guess my best (or worse?) moment was in RuneScape, in which I spent hours organizing my bank.  In PSO2 I just realized I had to choose: either struggle with space when I got 50+ rare drops, or leave most of the untekked items behind. It was a pretty obvious decision. But, my friend called me a hoarder when he saw my ""house"" in PSO2 xD It's usually almost full of decos, but at least I follow themes and decorate as if that was my actual house."

It's a perfect example that I can point to every time I want to explain how female characters are forced into molds that guys never have to deal with.   I'm getting depressed just thinking about it. Sigh."
MMORPG,3db6co,SleepyBurrito,4,Wed Jul 15 02:15:26 2015 UTC,"From what i saw it looked like you could get pretty big as a female but yeah, no where near the size of the males."
MMORPG,3db6co,Saerain,4,Wed Jul 15 03:02:51 2015 UTC,"Did we see the same video...?  I know the whole video is kind of fast, but here's a timestamped link: https://youtu.be/XIk6tQ5SojI?t=51"
MMORPG,3db6co,Zyrusticae,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:47:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, I saw that. I know it's possible to make a non-pear-shaped figure, but the variation on the overall mass slider is still pathetic next to the male one.   Look at that section again, then compare it to the female version. Honestly, I laughed. (Now I'm just disappointed.)"
MMORPG,3db6co,Reptile449,4,Wed Jul 15 16:06:02 2015 UTC,"It looks like you can manually change your characters shape a bit even as a female but the large/muscular/tall triangle is very much toned down for female characters. So you can make your character something that isn't ""Sexy pear-shaped"" but will struggle to really get different body shapes."
MMORPG,3db6co,PalwaJoko,2,Wed Jul 15 02:42:46 2015 UTC,"Is it just me, or did it look like it was changing the height? Not the shape of the body?"

The game used to be very fair to non paying players because you could grind a lot of the material out. I understand they've added drops to the sky invaders, but they kept limiting things that you can buy with your earned daily credits, and turned a lot of it into just paying out of your wallet."
MMORPG,3da46o,JunWasHere,2,Tue Jul 14 23:19:41 2015 UTC,"Your post has convinced me to dismiss Trove entirely.  I have been brooding about it while waiting for a response from support over the fact one cannot delete their character without the forum-suggested requesting for one's entire Trion Worlds account being wiped.   The cherry on top is their FAQ admits character deletion is not available and outright advises people to use their cash shop if they want name change. Utterly unacceptable in today's market, in my opinion.   It's a shame because the content itself seemed like it might be fun for what few minutes I spent in there.    In other news, I requested changes to both a character name and account name for Path of Exile - The requests were completed within a few hours - On their expansion's launch day! How awesome is that?!"
MMORPG,3da46o,Aldaugh,0,Wed Jul 15 01:01:20 2015 UTC,"I have played a lot of Archeage, I ended up putting a lot more money than I should have in it at the beginning, just to make sure our small guild could stay competitive. I knew what I was doing at the time, but I liked Archeage and wanted to advance as fast as we could during the headstart and first weeks of time. Then Trion started screwing up the cash shop. It was already worrying, but we were hoping they wouldn't screw it up. They did, and they fucked the whole economy with the thundering tree addition to the shop. I quit at that point.  Later on, we saw that Trove had the special on getting into the Alpha for only 5$. A guildie and me jumped in and we started playing. It ended up being ""the"" game for us for a while. The grind was still grind, but the daily cubit reward let us cut it down a bit. I ended up spending a fair amount on it, since I was enjoying the experience. Then the nerfs to the items started happening, items that we could previously get via cubits started being changed to cash only. We stuck with it for a bit, but at a point, we had enough, around the release of the Shadow Hunter. I started calling it ""Pay to progress"" after a bit, because otherwise, getting powerful gear to do the shadow arenas was going to take much longer, or you had to hope for a perfect drop.  I came back in and I found out with some changes to gear, the original gear I had that had me pretty much at the top of the charts is now ranking me barely into the shadow tier of equipment as well. Another nail in the coffin.  The trove team was great at first, they were awesome and they listened to the players, but after time, more and more restrictive things were happening to the cash shop.  Twice burned, never again."

I believe same story will be repeated with Devilian, I don't know about Trove, but in my eyes Trion lost enough reputation with their ArcheRage game."
MMORPG,3da46o,Aldaugh,2,Wed Jul 15 14:52:21 2015 UTC,"Regardless of what it is, the point stands that they are a company to avoid in the MMO market. That's all I'm saying.  Edit: When I say screwing up, I say making it consumer unfriendly. It was ""alright"" before they started making the changes, and I wasn't saying that it was a mishap or a slip up. It was intentional, and I know that it was."
MMORPG,3da46o,CainTz,2,Wed Jul 15 21:20:54 2015 UTC,"Except that they did much more than translate the game into English. You had fundamental gameplay changes such as the equalization of mount speed and glider speed, the release of Hasla so early (basically destroying crafting, normal progression, and pvp overnight), the disaster that was the aurora launch, and last but not least the script kiddies using programs to steal all the land in the game.   As someone who was in all of the betas and was a patron for the entire time I played the game - I felt consistently betrayed by Trion; as though they literally DGAF about the playerbase and BARELY fixed issues even when they effected their bottom line! Rank amateurism.  With Trove I played since the Alpha and was able to completely gear myself out in a day. Full shadow gear. I understand that some people want to be able to work towards something a little at a time because of time constraints. While that is fine if achievable by normal gameplay - throwing it all behind a paywall essentially - when it was once free, is not. That is my major issue with Trove. The fact that slowly things that were once free were being thrown behind paywalls, and that basically every update would strip more features away until you are left with a dried out husk hungry for money."

The summoner job unlock quest had you going around the world to look for each and every weather, eg. Day of the week had effects on crafting (crafting was tied to elemental crystals, so using a fire crystal for synthesis had a higher possibility of success/hq result on firesday (this needs confirmation, though))   There were several other mechanics like these in the game. Another example would be the fact that mobs had different conditions for aggro. Undead would aggro if you had taken damage, and from further away if were resting, eg.)

MMORPG,3dc6cd,comboallday,3,Wed Jul 15 03:11:30 2015 UTC,"This sub VASTLY prefers Gw2 to Eso in general so you'll see a lot of bias on that front. Personally I prefer ESO since I like it's combat, progression, and questing a lot better. I have played both, so feel free to ask any questions if you want a little more Eso sided opinion.  As for the PvP questions both open world PvPs are kinda a zergfest, but gw2 has small instanced battles (which I wish ESO had) but you can still find small scale stuff and duels in eso. Both are pretty skill based but have classes where you don't do much (which I hear a lot of the negative ESO opinions coming from). ESO is more hardware intensive in my experience. And the new updates made ESO so much better than before, totally a different beast than beta.  Final note on ESO PvP, I love it. I can go around questing and run into enemy factions, decide to fight, flee or befriend them (sometimes I don't have much of a choice if they're out for blood), and each of these leave my heart racing. Then maybe I see a keep under siege and rush over to go help out by cutting off reinforcements or taking out enemy siege machines. It's just so much different than other games I've played, and I've enjoyed my time in it thoroughly."
MMORPG,3dc6cd,c2fifield,2,Wed Jul 15 08:42:43 2015 UTC,"1: Guild Wars 2 is currently the second or third most-played MMO, the other contenders being FFXIV and WoW.  2: Guild Wars 2 has great PvP. I have a friend that is also almost exclusively a PvPer in MMOs and he absolutely adores PvP in GW2. It's worth noting, you can actually start playing PvP from day 1, as it's all equalized in terms of stats (for structured PvP) and in WvW, everyone is scaled to max level.  3: Guild Wars 2 is fairly skill intensive. You need to know your build, your rotations, and dodging is pretty big. You should also study up on common builds/rotations for classes you DON'T play, since it's important to know how to deal with other classes. I suspect this is common.  4: N/A. I'm only arguing for GW2. Someone who plays ESO can answer this.  5: The xpac for GW2 looks like it's going to increase playability. Don't get me wrong, vanilla is still INSANELY enriching. It's what I'd call an ""experience"" rather than being herded through a bunch of quests. The xpac promises to build upon an already rich experience, with the addition of lots of story, a new class, and a new PvP mode.  6: My wife runs GW2 at 45 fps on what basically amounts to her toaster of a laptop. So GW2 is fairly unintensive in this respect. That being said, good MMOs tend to be well optimized. I have a pretty damn good rig and play on max settings, and the game is just plain gorgeous.  Hope this helps! I also hope someone who plays and enjoys ESO finds this thread and gives some points about ESO, since I dropped it when it was in beta. Didn't enjoy it, but I feel like it still deserves a fair chance."

MMORPG,3dc6cd,Autumnplay,0,Wed Jul 15 12:43:19 2015 UTC,"ESO is... OK.   GW2 is great, and a far more complete experience.   Honestly, this is a no brainer."
MMORPG,3ddd8b,Samve,7,Wed Jul 15 11:38:35 2015 UTC,"Out of the three I hear more talk about GW2, followed by SWTOR."
MMORPG,3ddd8b,caelumsixsmith,-1,Wed Jul 15 11:58:46 2015 UTC,For some reason everyone talks about GW2. But when you are in game/forums everybody is saying the game is dying...
MMORPG,3ddd8b,EvoEpitaph,3,Wed Jul 15 18:09:39 2015 UTC,"If GW2 is dying then so is every other mmo on the market. The expansion is coming out soon too.  That's not to say it's the best mmo currently, but at the very least it's on par with the other big ones in terms of liveliness."
MMORPG,3ddd8b,Heavykiller,0,Wed Jul 15 19:03:32 2015 UTC,"GW2 isn't dying at all, but I think they've kind of hit that point where they've hit the peak of their player-base, so really are just focused on keeping them with all of this content.  It doesn't mean it's wrong to try and not exponentially grow or anything. It's just that at this point most people whom are interested in GW2 probably own it. WoW is doing the very same thing now and still keeps plenty of its millions of subs with its content."
MMORPG,3ddd8b,Autumnplay,5,Thu Jul 16 01:56:46 2015 UTC,"They're all doing very well - any one of those would be a good pick imo. Remember that the MMO playerbase is in a constant state of flux (since you use raptr, if you look at the past year's raptr stats you'll see how they shift around). If you want to be sure to get the absolute most popular MMO, you'd have to go for WoW. With the rest it seems to depend on who released the latest expansion, who did a console launch, who has a content drought, who messed up their cash shop (I'm looking at you, Archeage). You've played all three you say, so which one appeals to you most? What are your priorities in an MMO?"
MMORPG,3ddd8b,EvoEpitaph,2,Wed Jul 15 12:32:28 2015 UTC,"Well, GW2 was a lot of fun, I just feel it lacks content when you reach end game. PvE kinda sucked IMO. The SPvP is fun, but it gets frustrating when some classes are a bit OP. SWTOR was a lot of fun too but I never reached end game. Same thing for ESO. I'm just looking for a game to commit to, that will continue to keep a strong player base."
MMORPG,3ddd8b,EQCazik,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:13:00 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend just waiting for the next big hit, which regrettably might be a while.  Crowfall looks fantastic but that's a year or two out at least."
MMORPG,3ddd8b,Heavykiller,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:08:00 2015 UTC,"FF14 is the opposite of that (I know it isn't on your list but I felt compelled to include it based on how popular it is) in that it is very PvE dominant and really has no PvP scene at all really.   I am currently trying to delve into ESO so I have no comment on it yet and I have not played an ounce of SWTOR. FF14 is legit for PvE lovers, though. Its very instanced which is the reason I don't play much anymore. I thought they might do some more open-world content with the expansion but it is still enjoyable with all the dungeon/raid que's. My immersion comes from playing WITH people and finding them out in the open world. So this game is alot of fun and has great systems in place for an MMO but I just could NOT get immersed. I love that game - it'll always hold a soft spot in my heart but my business and time will go to the next great sandbox MMO.   fingers crossed for BD and EQ:N"
MMORPG,3ddd8b,Theomancer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:12:04 2015 UTC,"Yep, big on PVE and I feel FFXIV is a great game just for that.  I'm actually surprised you couldn't get immersed. I fell in love with the world, sometimes I'd just kind of go into first-person mode and run around the lush forest for kicks. I also found some great people playing FFXIV. Ran into plenty of people leveling up their 2nd or 3rd class that had great advice for me or just simply wanted to buddy up.  I've also just started ESO, but have to wait til I upgrade my OS.  PC can run FFXIV on DX11 great with Vista, but FPS gets choppy as hell on ESO. Bought the Imperial Edition on sale for $21 so no regrats though. From what I've played though it seems like it can be pretty fun though.  I'm with you there on that finger cross though."
MMORPG,3ddd8b,kroktar,5,Thu Jul 16 01:55:07 2015 UTC,"GW2 is the most popular of those three, and it's in the top 3 MMOs currently, I believe -- along with WoW and Final Fantasy, iirc."
MMORPG,3ddd8b,MadBlue,2,Wed Jul 15 14:24:23 2015 UTC,SWTOR = Pay.
MMORPG,3ddd8b,Dystopiq,0,Wed Jul 15 13:24:58 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair GW2 isn't free."
MMORPG,3ddd8b,Zienth,3,Thu Jul 16 03:29:06 2015 UTC,ESO more than likely. It launched on consoles and it sold well.
MMORPG,3ddd8b,TEKPistol,2,Wed Jul 15 16:26:47 2015 UTC,"https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=%2Fm%2F0jt2y_q%2C%20%2Fm%2F02q25c_%2C%20%2Fm%2F04q3kvg&cmpt=q&tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B4  Yep, if he were to choose an MMO solely based on how many active players it has at this exact moment (which is a pretty shallow way to choose an MMO), then ESO would win. That's mostly because the console release and the B2P conversion is generating so much interest that tons of first time players and old time players came back to start playing. Given a few months, it'll settle down and be much more in line with the others. When GW2 release their expansion, the exact same thing will happen to them, and GW2 will be the answer."
MMORPG,3ddd8b,Ethersix,2,Wed Jul 15 17:36:53 2015 UTC,"I just started getting back into SWTOR and I was genuinely surprised at the amount of other players running around me. Starting zone was bustling. I am now level 21 and there's still tons of players running around and doing the same missions as me. I think the biggest issue people have with SWTOR is that they view it as a f2p game then complain about paywalls. It should be viewed as a ""free to try"" game. If you enjoy it and want to get serious about it, then subscribe.  Having played all three MMOs you've listed, I'd say SWTOR takes the cake in terms of amount of content and enjoyable gameplay."
MMORPG,3ddd8b,bstr413,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:15:28 2015 UTC,SWTOR questing was very fun. PvP was a lot of fun too. If you say that there is still a tons of new player (or just low lvl running aroung). I might give it a try since it is free to play.
MMORPG,3ddd8b,DancingOgre,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:08:34 2015 UTC,"He you want a popular medieval MMO, go for WOW. Else try out SWTOR, this game has the best leveling experience as far as i'm concerned."

These two seem to be the most popular MMOs behind WoW for the PC. (FFXIV seems to give them a run for their money.) If you include consoles, ESO (and Destiny) is doing much better.  For all of these, these MMOs have great solo experiences: something other MMOs might want to look at if they want to become popular."

Not in a mental disability kind of way, but rather that he could just think about music an actually hear it. They ended up having him undergo a brain scan once while he was thinking about music and once while he was actually listening to it, and his brain lit up in the exact same way. They tried this with another person, and their brain lit up differently. Now, I'm sure there are some debatable things in the story, and I can't cite any of it, but I thought it was really interesting. I'm going to have to look into it more later today for legitimacy.

Hearing it was going F2P, I bought a copy so I could set myself up and write a guide for my gaming clan.   Gotta say, I really love the game. The combat is fun as heck, and the game just... Bounces. The humour, the visuals, the music - it's just fun. Also the group content is /insanely/ challenging. Even entry level dungeons are filled with guaranteed wipes on your first try because the content really demands everyone pay full attention, work as a team, and optimise their build. It's intimidating, but eventually really satisfying and, again, fun.   Biggest issue I can see in the game right now is the sparse playerbase, and it's a bit of a crippling issue. Queuing for low-level PvP or dungeons can take well over an hour even on weekends or evenings. However hopefully the F2P transition can fix that.   Definitely worth a go, I'd say!"

MMORPG,3dau6y,caelumsixsmith,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:00:35 2015 UTC,"I've been playing since launch, raiding the whole time (first raid is Genetic Archives, second is Datascape), officer in one of the bigger guilds on Entity PVE NA. There are some things some of you might want to know might want to know, just my two cents.  First, Carbine did a great job preparing for launch... a year after launch. They added tons of casual day-to-day content, quality of life improvements, etc, which have really helped make the game more playable and retain more players, but it took a year for them to get their shit straight, which in the end backlogged any development of truly new content. If you like casual, day-to-day dick-around kind of stuff, there's tons at this point - PVP, housing (which I don't like, but man, most people absolutely ADORE it, and for good reason), contracts, dailies, etc.  The combat system is, bar none, the absolute best in any MMO I've ever played, and likely will ever play. And I'm serious. It's amazingly well done, crisp, refreshing, and never, ever gets boring or stale.  With the good comes the bad. I'm a die-hard raider. It's why I play MMOs, and what keeps me playing MMOs. First things first - attunement to raiding is a fucking nightmare. They didn't make it hard so much as they made it time-consuming, tedious, and fucking back-breaking.  Once you hit Datascape, the entire rest of the game gets boring. That isn't to say Datascape is so amazing everything pales in its glorious light. There's just nothing to do in any way to advance, outside of Datascape... which is fairly brutal and unforgiving. Even crafting is completely and utterly useless. Raiding in Wildstar is exhausting - if one person screws up, covering for them is sometimes a non-option. Just call the wipe. This can be frustrating as Hell if you don't have a cutting-edge guild. Latency also has a much bigger impact in this game than it does in your traditional tab-targeters.  Wildstar suffers BAD when it comes to endgame content. It started with GA and DS, the first of which many guilds could clear... and the second one not so much. It took 140+ days for the top guild in the game to down the FIRST BOSS of Datascape. It was ridiculously overtuned, especially when it was a 40-man raid. It's a 20-man now (devs finally wised up and flipped that switch in January), but it's still overtuned, and can and does kill raiding guilds.  My archetype for the game with the best raiding progression was and always will be WoW: Burning Crusade. Heroics, to Karazhan, a 10-man raid that had a very cool story and fun events, followed by two/three bosses in a box, followed by the more difficult raid tiers. And it was a TON of content. Just a crazy amount. Kara, Gruul/Mag, SSC/TK, BT, and finally Sunwell. Just so much amazingly done content. Wildstar? It has GA and DS, and recently added Augmentors, which no one gives a damn about because it has no real place in raid progression anywhere.  So, long story short? Wildstar's gameplay is amazing, best of anything on the market right now, by far. It's just so... perfect. Even healing. I've never seen so many healers in a game, because in WS, healing is FUN. It's all fun. Dashing, double-jumping, telegraphs, etc. Just so well-built.  Top-level content is decent for day-to-day stuff if you're a completionist - reps to max out, PVP to do, costumes to dye, houses to build, pets to collect. If it suits you. I find it tedious, as it doesn't give me a sense of accomplishment, but to each their own.  If you raid? It'll be a fun 4-6 months, maybe, if you can stomach attunement. But eventually you'll just get bored and quit. Because endgame in Wildstar is short, punishing, and after a while, it just stops being fun. Even the story, which had the potential to be really cool, is kind of a drag and competitive.  Even worse, they don't have a mechanism for adding more raid tiers that isn't just ""and now a harder raid."" They've committed to quarterly content drops (which have been extremely weak, to say the least), which doesn't really put in place a means to add more raid content unless you raise the level cap, and that's not something a content drop really allows - it requires a proper expansion, which I can't see happening given the game's performance thus far.  So yeah, take that as you will. Hopefully it helps someone."
MMORPG,3dau6y,Raldoron,2,Sat Jul 18 05:53:26 2015 UTC,Do you think that f2p will alleviate some of these concerns? I know they have touched on the attunement and also have discussed more casual endgame in addition to the hardcore.

MMORPG,3d8z7q,begud,13,Tue Jul 14 12:59:26 2015 UTC,Oh! Internet drama! RSI returning their pledge is a nice counter move.
MMORPG,3d8z7q,Susarian,7,Tue Jul 14 13:58:47 2015 UTC,"Returning the pledges is kind of weird. Maybe not so much for Smart because he went on a crazy rant about it and I can see wanting to put an end to it, but just throwing money at him and saying, ""here you got your refund, problem solved"" isn't the way to do it. But they also returned the MMORPG article writer's pledge. So not only can you not criticise their game, but you can't even write about other people criticising their game? That seems a bit extreme to me."
MMORPG,3d8z7q,GravyBus,0,Tue Jul 14 15:36:49 2015 UTC,"Lends an air of truth to the criticism, regardless of the reality. The optics are bad on this for RSI. They need to get out in front, PR wise.  I've bought popcorn."

[Edit] For those who are allergic to Smart, here're his bulletpoints:   The project slipped it’s original Nov 2014 ship date as promised in the Oct 2012 Kickstarter pledge Almost four (1 year prior to KS, 2 years pledged timeline, 8 months delayed) years, they have not delivered a game; of any scope as originally pitched in 2012 Key people (we have a running list) have been leaving, some for patently dubious reasons Some ex personnel have already taken to places like glassdoor to voice concerns Key modules are either buggy, to the point of unplayable for the most part  (Arena Commander), or put on indefinite hold (Star Marine fps module) Technological hurdles, and the limitations of the CryEngine3 they chose, have only now started coming to light as recently as June’s dev update Chris, as seen/heard in the video above, had already stated, and I quote “the game on the low side was going to be about 14 million dollars to make and the high side, which is where we are at now, is going to be about 20 million” We’re $85m in. No game. They continued to increase the scope of the project, not only as a way to continue raising money through stretch goals, but also thereby putting the project at risk of never being completed as originally visioned; as doing so, makes it a very expensive proposition They continue to crowd-fund and raise money, selling virtual items for a game that doesn’t exist, and based on a TOS that all but guarantees that people who pledge, will have little to no recourse to get their money back, unless they sued and got the TOS tossed (as we suspect that it will, if the FTC doesn’t get there first) by a judge Investigations in the past weeks, and discussions with various people, have led to some very alarming, and disturbing things that, I’m not even going to bother making public – yet."
MMORPG,3d8z7q,Plugawy_Nedznik,3,Tue Jul 14 13:09:44 2015 UTC,"Eh wot? It never had a November 2014 ship date. They've only ever estimated late 2016.  The ""estimated delivery"" dates on pledges on Kickstarter campaign pages are for the items listed for the pledge itself. That's why they're typically different for different pledges."
MMORPG,3d8z7q,Saerain,7,Wed Jul 15 11:04:15 2015 UTC,"as promised   There's that word again. It was a planned date. They never said ""We promise to ship on this day."

MMORPG,3d8z7q,TypoHero,9,Wed Jul 15 03:27:39 2015 UTC,"My take on the points raised by DS:   The original project was planned to be a game with a $20m budget. Of course an $80m game takes longer to develop if you put that money to use.  You can't really count the pre-Kickstarter time as this was just making the demo assets and video. And about for one year after the KS campaign a lot of time was spent building the studios and hiring people. But is you are going to count those years then you would also have to say that a game like Elite: Dangerous which by many of the SC haters is helt up as a glorious example of stuff done right started development on Elite 4 in 2005 and had a tentative release date of late 2008... so that game took 10 years to develop and was 7 years delayed if you want to count it that way.  What dubious reasons? People not wanting to move from Austin to Santa Monica or getting hired to do the ships for the new Star Wars movies are not really dubious to me... plus why did he not mention the people they have hired in the meantime... like the original inventor of the CryEngine among others? Wasn't this mostly just one guy who was kind of fired because he was not good at his job? There is no indefinite hold... that is misleading as it sounds like it would have been put on ice which is not true as development continues. And of course there are bugs.. it's an alpha. What does he expect? Plus at the same time there are less bugs than in many final release AAA games (Batman, BF4 anyone?) Probably true. But besides using an old, outdated engine or building their own engine there was not much of an alterative to CE3. Remember that UE4 was still under development at that time. Development takes time? A lot of the stretchgoals were just additional assets which do not affect the gameplay and backend development in the slightest. They got additional money and could hier additional concept artists and modelers etc. Has only a minor effect on the actual game development.  It has been mentioned a few times in other posts... by people more knowledgeble in this regard.. but as far as I understand it the FTC is not even responsible in this case and will do exactly nothing.  Yeah... I have information about Half Life 3... but I am not going to tell you... ;)"

MMORPG,3d8z7q,MrNotSoNiceGuy,2,Tue Jul 14 15:21:54 2015 UTC,"He doesn't have any valid points. They're just vague attacks that reflect a poor understand of the development process... Which is weird, because he's been part of that process several times before.  The biggest criticism I hear from everyone is ""Oh they're taking so long this is vaporware"".  No, no they aren't. They budgeted 20 million dollars for the game they started out envisioning. They had a timetable for making that game... And then their fundraising EXPLODED and they ended up with what... 80 million dollars?  Now do you think people would be content to see that extra 60 million which is intended to be development money be converted into pure profit? Of course not.  So RSI began adding features to their plan. And those features take time and money that wasn't originally allotted for the game.  He goes on to complain about people leaving the company. Shit happens. People come and go, it happens all the time in the corporate world.  He hits on them for the bugginess of the Arena Commander and delay of the FPS modules. Once again, this is where his (extremely strange) lack of understanding of development go.  He's expecting each of these modules to play and perform like their own individual games. They aren't. They're literally just proof of concepts that are slapped together and handed to people (backers). RSI says ""Hey, here's what we've been working on in a vaguely playable form!"" They're proofs of concept, not games. They aren't optimized, they aren't bug fixed. That happens when they're all joined together in the final game.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it'd be irresponsible for them to spend time making these otherwise pointless modules optimized and majorly bug fixed."

I've managed to get at least 40 hours worth of entertainment out of it just flying around with friends in freeroam, racing, taking out wave after wave of Vanduul fighters and through practice I have greatly enhanced my piloting abilities.

MMORPG,3d8z7q,MrNotSoNiceGuy,4,Tue Jul 14 19:07:28 2015 UTC,"But the thing is is that the original kickstarter basically only included SQ42, with their somewhat overly-extremely successful stretch goals, that initial planned (not promised) date would inevitably have to be stretched to be able to fit all they are actually promising (not just planning). And before kickstarter and actual development began, it was a very very basic idea that he had based on his older games, with non-playable (by anyone) video ""demo"" that I'm not even sure was rendered in Cry, and definitely doesn't resemble at all what it does today.  They never expected 85+million, and right now they're nearly having to completely rebuild the CryEngine into a completely different engine to be able to handle how massive it all going to be, which they are successfully doing, just slower than we'd like.   It's not their fault that development of that scale takes time and is bound to run into problems with an engine that although is the best for the level of detail they want to achieve - it simply wasn't built to handle the massive scale SC will need it to be, so rebuilding it to be able to takes time as well. It's just having to take it's time to be able to happen, but I really genuinely do think it will get there. -- And hell, I even think E:D will possibly get to a similar state at some point, too...

Issue with these crowd funding things though... most people interested already backed it meaning once game actually ""launches"" their games ""sales"" are low because they made most their money before launch."

At this point, I don't think that anything can slow down this behemoth from gathering money as the fanbase defends them every step of the way.  Personally, I am very happy that I did not back this game. My rule of thumb for any sort of ""early"" backing is that I only back something when I am pleased where it is at the moment when I back it, and even then I am well aware that I can be highly disappointed in the final product. To back something that has shown this slow of progress, while demonstrating microtransactions on a scale that I have never seen before, requires the sort of faith that borders on fanaticism.   All the same though, this just means that I will not pay a cent until I see something actually worth having. If the game comes out, and everything ends up being really good then I'll gladly purchase and play the game.   Fans of this game seem to be so defensive because they cannot separate criticisms of the game itself (or the concept of the game, at least, since there is no game yet) from criticisms of the development process/funding model. As of yet, I have to problem with the idea of Star Citizen, just the dev process and funding model."

The FPS module for one, where you can literally get our of your ship and walk around a station and shoot people, boarding other peoples ships, having a crew of players in large ships.

I´m not saying Elite is better than SC, I don´t really follow SC, but as the article pointed out...there is not much to show off on SC front, while Elite is a exiting, completed game. Now, it´s not really complete as there are many things missing that could make it better, but the core is in place and they try to build around that"
MMORPG,3d8z7q,AilosCount,3,Tue Jul 14 15:36:34 2015 UTC,"The point I'm making is SC is wanting to launch feature complete where as by the time Elite comes out with all of its features SC will be out lol.

E:D will probably end up like Eve, grand dreams that never get realized.  At such degrees of over-scoping (which it seems like every space game ends up doing) it's better to release a half-baked product and iterate on it to get at least kinda-sorta where you wanted to be than it is to promise the moon and give us the nothing."

MMORPG,3d8z7q,AilosCount,2,Tue Jul 14 15:50:32 2015 UTC,They have playable modules out but they are more like testing pieces of a whole. There is gameplay of actually flying a ship after climbing in it. If you have access to the modules you can walk around a hangar and see ships that you own already you just can't fly them yet etc.
MMORPG,3d8z7q,kainsshadow,2,Tue Jul 14 15:52:40 2015 UTC,"fair enough. But still, in cases of both E:D and SC all the features you talked about in the comment above, it´s just promises, nothing else. It´s all nice SC want´s them in from release. It´s all nice that E:D launched and wants to add them as expansions. In both cases, it´s promises so it´s on the same level. The point is, E:D at least delivered the core experience, while SC has only fluff so far.   Don´t get me wrong though, I don´t want to say one is better or worse. I can´t. I´m just working with assumptions that were said in the article."

MMORPG,3d8z7q,MrNotSoNiceGuy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:43:24 2015 UTC,"Even how E:D and SC currently stands, besides procedurally generated systems (the best part of the game), a mind numbingly boring artificial trade economy, and a horribly tacked-on RPstory - SC already does have FPS (walking around ship, shooting other's ship/person with handgun), definitely more fun in-ship space combat, and way better lore... And this is just Alpha.  I don't deny that with E:D's budget and method of making one module, polishing it, and selling it as a whole game before moving onto the next module wasn't a bad idea - even though the PowerPlay RP module sucks serious balls storywise - but I'm sure if E:D had SC budget, they probably would have gone the similar ""all encompassing all at once"" direction SC did, simply because they could."

MMORPG,3d8z7q,MrNotSoNiceGuy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:20:37 2015 UTC,"There's little Sandboxy-ness to it, really. The economy is generated, and if buying low selling high - or having your name next to a system you were first to find - is sandbox, then, egh..   And the new PP RP aspect doesn't affect the actual game in any way, it just kinda sits loosely ontop of it - the systems, outposts, and police are always federally controlled regardless of controlling faction - whoever ""controls"" a system is simply for the Rep grind and nothing more, and those systems don't ever change. But I suppose in truth, SC won't be any more ""sandboxy"" in that respect, either. But will be much better told with full voice and animation acting, rich dialog, and immersive story. Not just take this shit, ship this shit, sell this shit, buy this ship to hold more shit, repeat...  As for actual flight fun - it does indeed come down to opinion - E:D feels extremely slow and sluggish to say the least, but I do like their landing over SC - while SC is quick and tight, just don't blackout. Both Newtonian, but both with very different values. But again, that part really is just opinion."

MMORPG,3d8z7q,MrNotSoNiceGuy,2,Tue Jul 14 15:18:30 2015 UTC,"ED is barely a game, its mainly a grinding simulator.  I enjoy ED as well, but acting like its flawless just means you're still in the honeymoon period.  It gets boring fast because the majority of the game is juat spend grinding to get a better ship, or grinding to get enough rep for rep locked ship.  They tried to fix this with power play but in reality they just added an optional minigame to the grinding.  They also have the issues of having peer to peer networking in that game, which results in a shitload of combat loggers, botters and hackers.  Let's also mention the issue of having solo mode being better than open in every single way.  Let's also not forget the baffling phasing system that makes it a random chance to find your friends and makes anything other then mindlessly grinding credits difficult. The ""wings"" update helped with this, but its still sad seeing community events (such as blockading a system) get absolute ruined by solo mode and shitty phasing.  So yes, elite has been released, but it still dosent make it a very good game. I'm saying this as a fan of elite, it needed another year of development. It was released way to early."

Solo mode you can't get pirated by players, hell, its its pretty much impossible to get pirated by an NPC in elite because the AI is so fucking retarded that you basically have to go out of your way to get killed by them. Solo mode you don't have to deal with clogged stations because there's no docking queuing system. Nothing like seeing 5 people floating near a dock spamming docking requests hoping they'll get through first. Solo mode you don't have to fight other players for kills while grinding bullshit. Solo mode you don't have to worry about hackers killing you randomly out in space. In solo mode, you don't have to deal with combat loggers because they decided to go with a Peer to Peer system for reasons beyond comprehension.   It's objectively better, no question. I can't believe you even said that lol   with wings update and everything this claim doesnt make any sense in the first place.   The wings update only fixes wings, and even then its clunky and shitty. The stupid wake system barely works.  I also love how you didn't mention the grinding issue, the phasing issues, the shitty pvp connections, the hacking, the botting, the fact that you can undermine systems by going into solo mode and doing dumb shit to people playing in open.  Lets also not forget Xbox exclusive content, way to shit on the faces of your beta and alpha backers frontier!  It's neat for a bit, during the honeymoon period where you're just learning the ropes of the game, but it has no staying power or depth. It's super easy to get bored of it.

MMORPG,3dcoyp,xAddison,2,Wed Jul 15 06:10:19 2015 UTC,"Ah Fiesta. It was my first proper MMO when I was a teen. At the time I didn't really want to pay for WoW and there weren't a huge amount of F2P options. The game is probably the most P2W, grindy piece of shit out there, but for some reason I loved it, possibly because I didn't have anything to compare it to. I ended up spending far more per month than I ever would if I'd just subbed to WoW and got a better game. Eventually, I'd had enough of Outspark (I think Gamigo runns both EU and NA now?) but wasn't sick of the game and I gave private servers a go. Fiesta's one of those games where private servers are huge, and whilst they do have a cash shop they're often infinitely more reasonable and you can buy things like exp boosts, charms, costumes from NPCs with gold, though that did vary between servers. Now, my suggestions. try out a popular Fiesta Private Server, or give Tera a try. Essentially, every F2P game is going to have a cash shop that tries to get people to buy things, that's how they stay afloat, but out of those I've played recently, Tera has the most consumer friendly (in my opinion)."

Noone can. As far as I have seen, Fiesta seems to have some kind of magical curse or some other deep binding with some sort of devil or some crazy stuff.   Literally every person I know either absolutely loves or absolutely hates this game (given that they ever tried it). Not a single one just says ""Meh whatever"". For myself I can sort of understand how our drawn towards Fiesta (but surely not the delete characters part) I love it myself, even tho I think the P2W is just disgusting.

This also was the only reason why i even played this game for such a long time. It is not like FFXIV where just everyone is friendly and nice it is quite the opposite, most people tend to be quite selfish but thanks to the small community there are a few groups/guilds in the higher levels and everyone pretty much knows everybody or at least their guilds. This kinda creates a family-like feeling and also an much higher incentive to be better than guild XY. Especially due to the open world bosses          Back then we spent hours over hours in the pvp zones and in guild wars just to screw over another guild which annoyed us at a raid and mostly every other guild did the same.  This maybe sounds weird why someone would enjoy such a community but i never was in a guild ever again where the people inside where so friendly, open and helpful to each others. Someone got pk'ed from a group of people? Ah no problem we got your back.  i started this game back in 2008 and quit in 2012, even today i'm still playing with the same people as in 2009 but we changed the game quite a few times and never found something where we stayed for such a long time as in fiesta.

You have the 3d models, the textures, the fonts, and the descriptions of abilities and whatnot.  View your client as less of the software and more a simulation of the game world.  Your installation of the MMO does not contain the server-side logic for buying and selling with vendors, combat, gaining EXP, turning in quests, tracking quest information, or any NPC information (outside of strings, once again).  So, use ArcheAge as an example.  Without the server side logic, you can't log in for starters, there is no server screen, and there is no character creation or validation.  Whatever.  Let's just say you get into the game anyways (somehow).  The world would be completely empty outside of the terrain, static trees, and static housing.

MMORPG,3d6ssn,Aerowalk,7,Tue Jul 14 00:32:44 2015 UTC,"Older games are relatively easier to reverse engineer (due to older technology, and there can be leak codes as well), besides reverse engineering may take a while especially in massive games + requires some truly dedicated group to work on it.    Thus, depending on the game and its dedicated fans, may not even worth it to work on the emulation / reverse engineering."
MMORPG,3d6ssn,Irythros,3,Tue Jul 14 00:48:11 2015 UTC,"Lineage 2 had server leaks, thus L2Off servers.  L2J was made by both packet decryption and analyzing the leaks."
MMORPG,3d6ssn,uplink42,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:43:21 2015 UTC,"Lineage 2 was notorious for having its server files stolen via several leaks, especially on major expansions (interlude, gracia final, high five and later on GoD I believe). So it's much easier to start when you already have something to work with. Hence the term official files.  This doesn't apply to all the shitty java emulators that plague most high rate/br/low quality servers tho, those were pretty much made from packet decryptors (capturing and translating the information your client sends and recieves from the server, this gives you an idea what the server's input and output routines look like) and several things were coded according to people's empirical experiences, which ended up as a bug nest."

MMORPG,3d6ssn,Piamo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:46:27 2015 UTC,"That's one of the big reasons with the EQOA revival project is asking for people that have captured any packets to give them data.  The game will send out a packet.  In the case of trying to cast, say, Lava Burst in WOW, it will send a packet requesting permission to cast the spell.  The first step of the emulation is for them (the emulator creator) to intercept the packet to inspect the packet's structure.  It may send the spell ID along with your currently selected target.  The way they create the emulator is by taking the packet sent by the client software and creating server software that receives and acts upon that packet.  /u/DrFrankensteinx this is also relevant to your question."
MMORPG,3d6ssn,Theomancer,3,Tue Jul 14 00:52:19 2015 UTC,"Fascinating.   I hope there does become a private ArcheAge server without the cash shop -- hell, even an official server. That'd be amazing."

MMORPG,3d6ssn,adag_dot_me,2,Tue Jul 14 08:11:21 2015 UTC,"Someone else gave a really nice response, but I'm going to dumb it down even further just because I want to get it out.  An online game being played out is like a sock puppet play. Your computer (the client) provides the stage for the online game to be played out, it also provides the costumes, props, and setting for the characters to interact. The server is the hands that come up from behind the stage and actually moves the characters and moves the play along. We can't see what's going on backstage, we can only see the hands inside the puppet on stage acting out the play. If we wanted to copy this play ourselves without the server we will either need the script (the source code) or we would need to watch the play enough that we memorize all the lines (reverse engineering the source code). Until you somehow get the script or memorize the script then you'll always need Trion's hands to watch the play."
MMORPG,3d6ssn,uplink42,8,Tue Jul 14 20:33:00 2015 UTC,"Most well designed servers don't use, thus aren't affected by graphics at all. Only the client on your computer. I can't imagine any major MMO has a server that runs a graphical side. Very few even allow dedicated player hosted servers to run the client and the host as one application. Eg. Minecraft's or Gas Guzzlers' vs Terraria's server. If you want an idea of what most MMO servers look like now (multiple console applications taking control of different game aspects, hence why when the ""AI server"" is down but the game still works, AI don't move), you can download the open source Ryzom server and fire it up."
MMORPG,3d6ssn,Irythros,5,Tue Jul 14 07:38:22 2015 UTC,"Servers don't manage any logic relative to graphics. All it does it continously send and recieve information to the clients regarding object coordinates, skill damage calculations, monster AI and whatnot. The client then recieves that information and renders all the appropriate effects/textures locally."
MMORPG,3d6ssn,adag_dot_me,2,Tue Jul 14 08:26:58 2015 UTC,The server has no graphics card.  It does not render graphics at all.  If it does then the playerbase would be severely limited by bandwith and also the game would suck due to latency.  All the server does would be management of data and security.
MMORPG,3d6ssn,Irythros,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:59:58 2015 UTC,"Well, actually, the graphics rendering server-side wouldn't affect bandwidth at all because it wouldn't be transmitting graphics data to the clients, which would hopefully still have said data downloaded.

Even if you do spend that much money, there will be others who have spent as much/more and have been playing longer, hence is inherently more powerful than you. This combined with time-gated advancement, it'll make the game unfun if you are into winning in PvP.  However you quit when the game was relatively new (At least compared to current NA's version).

MMORPG,3daak5,RektoKyoma,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:36:59 2015 UTC,I suggest skipping most of the quests in town at the beginning. Do your main story quests and your class quests and skip the side quests. It's much quicker and more fun to just head outside and kill mobs or do a few FATEs. The side quests in the cities are mainly there to act as tutorials for people who have never played MMOs before and they don't award much EXP.
MMORPG,3daak5,Steftiffe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:35:37 2015 UTC,"hum... you can always just go outside the town and kill things, tho the talking to people is so you get faster xp, and to serve as a game tutorial for UI and types of quest the game uses (doing emotes, delivering items, get to a certain location, killing X mobs, etc) and the lore and stuff.  Also, the starting grind of quest is so you get to lvl 5 fast and at least get another skill to use on combat."

The main quest involves going to talk to the adventurer guild's head, then going to three separate key locations, before the next quest has you leave the city.  You then have to get level 5 gear and wear and you head off to a big battle quests. Nearly every quest outside of the city is a battle quest.  What the hell are you people talking about?  Is this up there with the same stupidity of not being able to read you map that has clear markers for where it goes and what the next zone is with a ""continue"" symbol so you know what direction to go?

You run around and get quests from NPC's, you complete said quests and hand them in for your reward. There's other fun stuff to do in between like FATE's and Hunting Logs at the start. If you find killing stuff the most fun then try out the hunting logs and FATE's. A lot of quests require you to kill monsters too.   Your main source of experience in FFXIV will come from questing though. Luckily FFXIV has a great leveling experience, you shouldn't find it hard to find something to do, you just have so many options early game."
MMORPG,3daak5,Meefius,0,Tue Jul 14 19:23:20 2015 UTC,FFXIV has a great leveling experience? I play the game and i would say its horrible. Sure there are multiple ways to level but they are all grindy and at times even tedious. You don't call a leveling experience great when almost everyone in the game uses a Fate train to level from 41-50 in North Thal grinding the same fates for hours and hours. Yes there are other ways to level but the fact that  so many people use this says a lot about it.
MMORPG,3daak5,skyline385,-1,Wed Jul 15 00:26:29 2015 UTC,Its only terrible once you've leveled your first class and used up all the quests. For your very first leveling experience its very enjoyable compared to other MMOs as there's so much that rewards you with EXP. I didn't feel that my getting my first 50 was a grind... My 2nd and 3rd were indeed very tedious.   I do agree that the FATE grind is shocking after you've maxed your first class though they definitely should improve that. It became more appealing to just start a new character if I wanted to play a different class.
MMORPG,3daak5,Meefius,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:01:49 2015 UTC,None of them. They're all pretty much running around and talking. The leveling experience at least until 30 is not the game's strong point. It's up to you to decide whether or not you feel like it's worth muscling through the slow start.

You had to grind items and levels just to unlock the ability to play with other people, huge barrier to entry.

MMORPG,3d84l3,Hexadis,22,Tue Jul 14 06:40:14 2015 UTC,"People who are busy and can't plan around gaming time often need something that's easy to drop into and out of and subs complicate that. Subs don't include everything. Most sub-games still have cash stores and make you pay for the expansions. I don't like intrusive cash stores or P2W stuff, but there are enough non-sub games that avoid that. Because that $15 a month still costs $15 even when the studio practically abandons the game for a year. Yes, you're paying for a service. But it becomes a bitter pill to swallow when the game you love is charging you for something you feel you're not getting. Whether $15 is good value or not is subjective. For example, kids who are still dependent on their parents find it much easier to access F2P titles, or to convince their parents to get them B2P titles. Why? Because in a family with two kids who want to play MMOs, that $15 a month gets pretty pricey over time. Also remember that in some places minimum wages (even for ""middle class"" people) are lower and a new movie ticket costs $2-$6 dollars. Your perception of value is not universal. Finally, when people complain about the cost of something, that doesn't necessarily mean that they can't afford it at all. It often means that they feel the price is too high for the value they're getting. This means that someone can have an internet connection that costs the same as a sub, but feel that the value they get from having good internet is much better than the value they get from a game subscription.   To conclude, you're certainly not the only one who feels that subs are fine in every way. However, the people who feel otherwise usually have perfectly good, often practical, reasons for doing so."
MMORPG,3d84l3,Autumnplay,2,Tue Jul 14 13:03:27 2015 UTC,"Awesomely put on all points, I'm kind of pleasantly surprised that someone laid out these reasons folks might not be interested in a subscription rather than just the standard assumption of brokeness.  I'd add as an addendum to #3 that you're paying the monthly subscription whether you like the direction the game is headed in or not.  This is a big one for me as I pretty much refuse to continue paying for content that I'm just not interested in.  The best example that springs to mind is ESO, I went back to the game when it went B2P because I'd heard good things about their future plans.  A week or so ago they announced that in fact they're sticking with their original plans and they're aiming to add MORE VR levels, I'm pretty friggin glad that I didn't pay a monthly fee for that."
MMORPG,3d84l3,idredd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:58:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I just think we need to realize that there are a number of reasons the sub-model is not popular with everyone. And people don't have an irrational hate for subscriptions - monthly payment models are common in most aspects of life. But like F2P and B2P, the sub-model has its own list of problems. Some of what you mention in your list mirrors my own experiences. Most notably (I didn't even go into this) you discuss how the payment model influences the game design and how this has resulted in some crazy vertical progression grinds. F2P usually has the problem where design can facilitate P2W, while B2P generally has the problem of reduced/slow content.  Maybe the big question is not which payment model is best (because people will never agree on this), but which games implement their chosen payment model in ways that are constructive to the quality of the game and acceptable to its playerbase.  Btw, ESO adding more VR levels? When did they decide this? I thought they were scrapping those. :\"
MMORPG,3d84l3,Autumnplay,3,Tue Jul 14 14:45:11 2015 UTC,"Haha many a shitty MMO article could have been summed up by the three points you made.

MMORPG,3d84l3,Siigari,6,Wed Jul 15 21:08:50 2015 UTC,"It's mainly the fact that by paying up-front for a month, you feel like you have a responsibility to get the most of your moneys worth out of it. Also, it's just like any other subscription (like a gym membership) where real life can get in the way (eg. your PC dies, you waste your month's money etc).  Still. A lot of the time, people see this sub fee as a large chunk, when you are entirely correct in saying that $15 for anywhere upwards of 10 hours of entertainment in a month is a steal. It's very polarizing though - if you're only moderately enjoying a P2P game, people are very quick to stop paying a sub whereas they might have continued were it a F2P game."
MMORPG,3d84l3,Altruisa,3,Tue Jul 14 13:32:35 2015 UTC,"Much of this boils down to the type of player you are.  I often spend more than 15$ a month on the games I play, but I pretty much refuse to pay subscription fees anymore.  I'll note my reasons below though they're likely to be unpopular around here.   The core issue in the B2P/F2P/Subscription fee debate for me is the issue of choice. In B2P/F2P games I can pay for the content or materials I want, this allows me to show the game's makers what I'd like to see more of. I'm pretty particular about what I want to see in MMOs these days, when stuff comes out that I like I  Subscription fees arguably go hand in hand with game design choices that I don't like.  Sub games need to keep players around from month to month and the easiest way to do that is by implementing grinds, vertical progression and all the stuff we know and love about MMOs (I hate this stuff). I don't play MMOs the way that I used to, I am not into hours and hours of raiding and I enjoy being able to hop into a game, play some, hop out and feel like I've accomplished something.  When I pay my monthly fee I feel as if I'm not getting my money's worth if I don't play like a maniac."

While I agree with most everything else you've said, I think the things players most often purchase are the things they'd rather not see more of.  If you put something in a game that's blatantly overpowered, players are more likely to buy it, despite the fact that a vast majority of people are against extreme amounts of P2W."
MMORPG,3d84l3,SeraphLance,0,Tue Jul 14 21:07:51 2015 UTC,"This, also there is a sense of exclusivity with F2P games with cash shops. Not everyone has access to EVERY costume, so you feel more unique when you buy a special costume from the store for your character and show it off. Same with LoL and Dota2, some players think it is a good thing to start off with a limited champion and skin pool, though they eventually want to be able to earn all the content."
MMORPG,3d84l3,LocusOfCharr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:16:31 2015 UTC,"I actually tend not to buy skins, in a game like LotRO I definitely would/have but I don't think most current MMOs have a good system for gear appearance management so I just don't bother.  Most of what I spend my money on in cash shops is shit like bank space, inventory space, new content/areas/zones and character slots."
MMORPG,3d84l3,idredd,2,Tue Jul 14 14:46:12 2015 UTC,Money man... money
MMORPG,3d84l3,lazycalm2,-1,Tue Jul 14 13:43:28 2015 UTC,This argument just doesn't make any sense to me.  Should you get to play a game for free?  What have you done to earn that?  Should the developers simply be grateful that you are blessing their game with your presence?
MMORPG,3d84l3,lazycalm2,2,Tue Jul 14 19:22:00 2015 UTC,Ever heard of buy to play? Cause that's how every game used to be
MMORPG,3d84l3,lazycalm2,0,Tue Jul 14 20:38:48 2015 UTC,There used to be no such thing as persistent servers with constant worlds where thousands of people could all play together.  Servers to run these huge expansive worlds cost money.  The current big name popular buy to play mmos offset these costs with in game purchases.
MMORPG,3d84l3,Snoozeypoo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:53:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but there's a difference between being greedy and just trying to provide the best experience possible by not going p2w, which most do, I'll give you that. On the other hand, I just think the standard sub cost is too expensive for what players get. It just not justify it imo"
MMORPG,3d84l3,Snoozeypoo,2,Wed Jul 15 04:34:50 2015 UTC,Mainly because I like to play multiple games. I enjoy just buying something and having it.  The biggest issue is features that come out. Take WoW for example. I pay 15 a month and decide I want to take a break. They release a patch that fixes a lot of the issues. I have to pay 15 just to see if it is better for me now. if not I just paid 15 bucks for 2-3 hours.
MMORPG,3d84l3,piedpeid,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:58:42 2015 UTC,This seems like a pretty valid complaint.  What if you had some way to try the game out for a few hours if you were a returning player?  Sort of like a free trial for new players but changed a bit for returning players who just want to see if they like how the game has changed.
MMORPG,3d84l3,runnyyyy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:16:59 2015 UTC,"Would be better than now for sure.  Although, I don't know if that would be enough for me to consider subscription games. I prefer B2P. GW2 set up is ideal for me honestly. Just personal Preference."
MMORPG,3d84l3,mc_secha,2,Tue Jul 14 19:33:10 2015 UTC,"Some people enjoy choosing how much and when to spend money.   When they decide to save their money, they still want to be able to play the game they brought.  Crazy huh?"
MMORPG,3d84l3,Molehole,2,Tue Jul 14 16:34:09 2015 UTC,"subscription fees are just not NEEDED anymore. Running servers used to be a lot more expensive than it is now. Sure you're paying your devs and game masters as well, but the subscription fee used to be needed to keep the servers up.   I hate subscription fees because I feel like I HAVE TO play the game  in order to get my moneys worth."
MMORPG,3d84l3,ItWasDumblydore,2,Wed Jul 15 01:51:37 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest reason is that You don't play for the whole month. At least I have this. I know I play the game for this 15$ because I don't have that much time.  I am wondering why doesn't company try to sell the time actually spent in game, for example you can either buy one month for 15$ or 1 hour for 10cents."
MMORPG,3d84l3,ItWasDumblydore,3,Tue Jul 14 12:30:09 2015 UTC,Because no one likes to rush while they are playing a game. It has been tried and it just makes it very stressful for people. Of course something like 30 hours for $15 could be an alternative choice to $15 a month for players that don't play much.
MMORPG,3d84l3,darkenhand,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:33:24 2015 UTC,I don't hate subscription fee's if I feel like I'm getting content monthly.

MMORPG,3d84l3,Outfighter,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:12:56 2015 UTC,Feels like they would make me want to rush to end game to get max enjoyment.  Like in wildstar you see everyone rushing to end game and probably doing the dungeons once on their way. They have a system where you can buy game time with in-game gold and reaching cap is the best way to get said gold.   Probably become more easygoing when it become just a premium status instead of game time. Also like if I dropped GW2 for a month I can come back to it without a issue since it isn't a subscription base game.

There are still signs of life on the site, but no straight answer on when re-release is coming.  Genesis is ok if you're really desperate for some classic DAoC, but overall not a great server.  Leveling is way too fast, population is constantly dropping, and RvR is a circle jerk.  Really, balance is nothing like live was during the period they're trying to emulate."
MMORPG,3d5oll,BeardyDuck,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:44:32 2015 UTC,"I thought they built a very good emulator. They've been at it a long time.

DAOC clients are available online, since the game it still active."

Yeah, I hear people who played on release saying it was bad. They never went back and disconsider the content released in the two years that followed. If you ask those who played through this content, they'll say the game changed a lot in the course of its existence and that it was rather solid and playable near its end. Also, all players have on information prior to Dalamud's landing is wikia. Perhaps some people would like to actually play through that, or those who enjoyed v1 (not few, btw) would like to go back to it. As surprising as it is, there are people who prefer v1 over ARR.  As for the private server itself, it runs nicely. It's not nearly playable cos there's no content at all, but the game itself runs quite smoothly (I had stuttering on my previous computer, but since this one is a few tiers up, the game is 100% smooth) and I haven't experienced lag."

There was one primal, I think it was Leviathan or Titan, supposed to make its debut on v1, but the developers delayed it until ARR because of the tsunamis in Japan. My guess is that Square Enix failed in bringing people back to v1 because of the fame it gained on release (I mean, how many people would look funny at it after what happened, despite of those who played saying it was a completely different game by that point?), this forcing the shut down. There was even a campaign that comeback players would play for free for a month and the game became F2P for a little period of time before it was shut down, but it wasn't enough.

MMORPG,3d5o0f,toothpicksmash,3,Mon Jul 13 20:43:30 2015 UTC,Most honest answer here: You cannot replace WoW at all
MMORPG,3d5o0f,lazycalm2,9,Tue Jul 14 04:42:59 2015 UTC,"WoW was an exceptional game that almost every popular MMO on the market has drawn influence from. It is an important game to us because for many of us it served as an introduction to MMO games or even Online games as a whole. WoW is irreplaceable, not because of the game as a game, but because of the game as a bastion for memories formed with friends when you were 13 playing vanilla wow until 4 am with your friends over voicechat.   At least that's how it is in my experience. I hate Modern WoW and never play it anymore, but I still randomly hop on for 10 minutes out of habit, in the hope the spark will be reignited."

I have tried most of the major mmo's on the market and a couple I really enjoy (FFXIV and GW2 are both fantastic games IMO) but not for me at this point in my life.

MMORPG,3d5o0f,Evilfetus155,18,Tue Jul 14 19:09:20 2015 UTC,"You can't. WoW is irreplaceable. It somehow still has enough unique stuff to add that you'll never really be able to jump into another MMO and get that exact WoW feel.   However, this doesn't mean that other MMOs can't fill that big orc-shaped void. I left WoW recently too after playing for a decade, because the mixture of either needing to put up with LFR idiots or hours of time for proper Mythic raiding was too much to juggle (and unlike other patches which had adequate non-raid filler, I just wasn't feeling garrisons).  Never played Aion. Rift felt generic, like it really wanted to be WoW but failed. It's still a strong, solid game and definitely worth at least a try.  I've tried every major MMO on the market and my current personal rankings are : 1) FFXIV (it feels like BC WoW with an Anime skin), 2) GW2 (amazing mid-patch game between a sub MMO but no staying power if you like traditional MMO endgames and 3) ESO (my current favorite but ranked lower because of people's complaints about endgames and its bugs/QoL issues.)  Why do I play ESO? 1) Questing is the same as all other MMOs dressed up, like they all are, but the voice acting and choice given in some quests makes it feel more alive.  2) Elder Scroll's lore is great and a real breath of fresh air after the retcon-laden, bad comic book style, eyeroll that is WoW lore.  3) Gorgeous character models, gorgeous worlds. I feel more of a connection to my character, and even to my mount since it has to be trained daily.  4) Exploring and Gathering is fun.  For the social fast twitch gear-grind fix that WoW's raiding used to give me, I just play Diablo 3.  Basically there is no WoW replacement and considering the evolution (devolution?) the entire genre has taken, there probably never will be.  Play a bunch of games until one feels as fun as WoW did."

MMORPG,3d5o0f,ob3ypr1mus,2,Tue Jul 14 05:42:15 2015 UTC,GW2 is an incredible leveling experience. If they ever add something to do in endgame besides PvP or costume-farm I'd make it my main MMO for good.  It just feels like one hits a wall if they like/are used to traditional MMO PvE endgame.
MMORPG,3d5o0f,Oldneovet,2,Mon Jul 13 19:12:47 2015 UTC,Problem with GW2 is that every armor is the same just with different lookout. So there is no point for even playing all the dungeons... After you get exotic set (max week after hitting lvl 80) you just farm to get Ascended and this is no fun. Even with the new update there is no new armor except some legendaries... On the other hand there is lot of story and very good community and these world bosses are just epic... Well good game done wrong (as usual)
MMORPG,3d5o0f,Korysovec,2,Mon Jul 13 19:19:55 2015 UTC,"true, the exotic/ascended armor is just good for running Fractals (basically a never ending scaling series of mini-dungeons) and exotic themselves are more than enough for all the PvE content aside from higher level Fractals, however player customization is a big thing and crafting legendaries and ascended armor are probably the biggest grinds in the game; but when you get to that point where you do get the best armor statwise there's very little to actually do with it since you grossly outscale any PvE content."
MMORPG,3d5o0f,ob3ypr1mus,2,Mon Jul 13 19:33:38 2015 UTC,"When you do get the best armor, you just sit and wait for new act in story mode. Which is great, but you cant build mmo on that.... However this conversation should take place in ArenaNet HQ."

I am currently playing Skyforge, and while it is good, I wouldn't exactly call it a WoW killer. The main reason I am having fun playing it is because I am playing with guildies. And the thing is, this guild was not established solely because of Skyforge, but was originally was one for Aion. But eventually people stopped playing and they moved on to the next flavor of the month. And the next. And the next. And while many MMOs have come and gone, the guild is still here.   What I'm tring to say is, don't look for a good mmo, look for a good guild. That is far more important."

What I particularly like about Rift was the Rift events that get everyone in the whole area collaborating to close them.  I forget the terminology now, but I loved the idea of spontaneous groups and collaboration.  There were some fun people around there too.  SWTOR was fun for a while, the stories are really good.  Lately, I've been obsessed with The Secret World, also an amazing story game and with an overall more mature community, it seems to me, than most other games.    Wildstar's combat system looked interesting but the graphical style was just too bright and cartoony for me.  I couldn't bear the idea of spending many hours in that world."

Rifts are the stand-out, but can be irksome since a private party can shut out anyone in the public party (rifts are not open tap, last I played).  The multi-sub-class could be interesting to some, but the system still suffers from the ""only one configuration works, and if you're not using that you're wrong). Also, professions are very Vanilla WoW.  (I know you said you tried it, but there are standard builds that can take some of ""overwhelmyness"" out of it).  FFXIV - Beautiful game. Interesting spins in class flavor. Story advancement/leveling progression is gated behind mandatory dungeons. Interesting take on Crafting thought eh mechanics are, once again, very Vanilla WoW (grindy).    SWTOR - The lore/world is a nerdgasm. Gameplay is interesting with an ""alignment"" system. Companions are both interesting and irksome (you have no choice who your first five companions are, and the Consular Companions are horrible). F2p is the worst implementation I have seen.    Widlstar - Humorous. Interesting take on using the Bartle Test (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_Test) to guide player involvement in the world. Interesting take on professions. Currency acquisition terribly Vanilla WoW grindy.     I can't talk to end-game because my heart will always be in WoW, so I defer to to others on that count."

It's fun and pretty balanced, but the simplicity gets kinda dull and repetitive - to me, anyway.

Both are games that, if nothing else, tell some really good stories, and are fairly fun to play through with a friend.  They do have their own version of end-game content, but that, in all honesty, will never compete with the quality of WoW.  Instead, what they do offer are stories and experiences that are distinct and unique from WoW.  Also, although FFXIV is likely going to be cited as the next best thing you can experience, personally I did not care for the game.  A lot of what it boils down to is subjective interest, and the world of Azorea (sp?) just simply doesn't captivate my interest.  The lore does not interest me there, regardless of how good the game plays/how polished the end-game content is."

Outside of that, you're basically rummaging through a pile of used syringes in hopes that you'll find a piece of gold.  Just looking at the side bar...  EVE.  FF14.  GW2.  Maybe Neverwinter.

MMORPG,3d5o0f,Havesh,0,Mon Jul 13 22:41:46 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar situation recently, and I was almost giving up on MMO's altogether.  FFXIV made me wish I had gotten into it earlier, I would highly recommend giving the free trial a go, especially if you're a Final Fantasy fan.  I recently converted a friend who plays WoW to FF and they are enjoying it a lot too.  I almost went to ESO or Guild Wars 2 but I couldn't be happier that I found this amazing MMO after trying it in Beta and thinking it was stupid.  Combat seems a little slow at first, until you get more abilities down the track and you can 'weave' abilities that are on and off the GCD.  You can also play all classes/jobs in one character, and use cross-class abilities that you gain for different classes.  Apart from the combat the crafting fits in naturally and is completely optional, and I've recently got caught up with the card game, Triple Triad, that is part of the game.  As a whole, the game is addictive and there are always different things to do, whether it be for the whole day or for less than an hour.  The community being awesome is also a bonus :)  In any case, I hope you find a new MMO home that makes you realise there are still great MMO's out there!  If you ever do try FFXIV go on the Diabolos server and hit me up, I'm part of a really helpful Free Company (basically a guild) so you'll have some place to ask any questions you have!  Good luck!"

MMORPG,3d5o0f,Onisake,0,Tue Jul 14 03:33:48 2015 UTC,"your best bets are FFXIV or Wildstar.   the reason most other games dont' live up to WoW, and why Aion or Rift will never replace WoW, is budget and polish.   Aion and Rift are ok games. they can hold their own. but they don't have the little things that help bring a gameworld to life.   which means you're basically stuck with AAA budget mmos. and that means you have very very few choices.   Carbine has done a decent job of bringing W* back into the fold. with updates, changes, overhauls, etc. the game is going f2p soon, so it's worth checking out.   FFXIV is as good as it gets in the MMO market right now. call that sad, or an inspiration at your preference. but the team at SE is doing almost everything right. FFXIV and WoW are very similar at their very core. but FFXIV is, in many ways, a more mature version of WoW. the story is darker. the character models are less cartoony. the animations have more weight. the game was built from the ground up to more friendly towards busy adults with busy lives."
MMORPG,3d5o0f,shoziku,0,Tue Jul 14 06:01:53 2015 UTC,"I've tried both before and Aion struck me as quite grindy (leveling was pretty slow)   If that was your impression it must have been a very long time ago.  Leveling has been super easy and enhanced for the past several years now.    the general opinion now of Aion is its oxymoronory.  (just made that up)  As it touts itself being a PvPvE game, there are complaints from both sides.  PvP players do not like having to PvE to level up and become competitive.  And PvE players don't like the PvP aspects which are eventually forced upon them.    But NCSoft is suspicious to me right now because they downsized the upper end game (55-65) greatly by removing shitloads of content (PvP as well as PvE content) and replacing it with contested PvP zones.  the world got much smaller in their last patch a couple months ago.  what can they be up to?  It seems ludicrous to downsize and remove content unless they have administrative limitations that require a smaller game."

MMORPG,3d6drg,Shovelbum26,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:06:48 2015 UTC,"Both WoW and FFXIV are good games.   If you like PVP I would go with WoW as it has much better PVP than FFXIV, the best out of any game I have played really.  However, FFXIV has better graphics, and crafting. The PVE side of things are pretty much the same, quests, dungeons raids, but FFXIV also has a lot more side stuff to do such as minigames, hunting logs, leve quests etc. So if you have little interest in PVP then FFXIV would be the way to go."
MMORPG,3d6drg,lianse,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:43:21 2015 UTC,"Between those two games if you like to PvP at all whatsoever play WoW. Also if you want to level from 15-100 strictly doing dungeons you can do that in WoW even as DPS not so much in FFXIV. But since you are a tank it actually doesn't matter either way - you will have instant queues although FFXIV requires you to finish the main story prior to playing the expansion and this is not short.  However, if this is your first MMO game I'd play FFXIV because it's newer has regular content and really teaches you how to play from 1-50 before throwing you into end game. WoW is also on it's decline and if you really get sucked in you may as well play the game that's newer and potentially has a longer life span.  I can certainly see why people enjoy FFXIV but to me WoW is still better. Just my opinion, which doesn't mean much since I am currently addicted to Wildstar."

MMORPG,3d6drg,zachmoe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:23:03 2015 UTC,"If you're a fan of Final Fantasy then I would say no question about it, try FFXIV.  I played WoW for years but recently got into FFXIV, wish I had gotten into it a lot earlier.  FFXIV is heavily focused on PvE and personally I have found FFXIV's much more fun, interesting and rewarding.  It's a really beautiful game and there is always fun stuff to do!  Community is awesome too!"
MMORPG,3d6drg,jshrmstrng,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:00:05 2015 UTC,Try Wildstar with 10-day free trial. It has the best PvE content in any MMO in my opinion.

MMORPG,3d5jg5,xhaku,7,Mon Jul 13 18:15:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it depends more on the server and less on the game. The one consistency I've found between most MMOs is you're much more likely to find a nicer community on RP servers. This is especially true with Guild Wars 2, TERA, FFXIV, and even certain RP servers in WoW. Conversely, PvP servers tend to attract more competitive/assholish types."
MMORPG,3d5jg5,SF218,13,Mon Jul 13 20:01:12 2015 UTC,"Guild Wars 2, no doubt about it for me.  The community alone is one of the reasons I continually go back to the game.  The Elder Scrolls Online community is also very, very good.  Though the starting zones will be rife with immaturity, it basically stays there since those people never make it past level 20."
MMORPG,3d5jg5,FrankReynolds,4,Mon Jul 13 18:36:07 2015 UTC,"They do have great communities, but I didn't find that ""go out and level"" experience from either of these games. GW2 is more of a ""find random people doing the same thing you're doing"" kind of game and although there can be a lot of grouping up, it feels like the objective would be complete either way. This means there is less reason to communicate with one another.  Elder Scrolls I didn't get too far in, but quests felt pretty standard and stream lined. Much easier to accomplish things now-a-days so less grouping."
MMORPG,3d5jg5,DirkaSnivels,0,Tue Jul 14 06:04:43 2015 UTC,"The Elder Scrolls Online community is also very, very good.   Really?  I guess I also stopped before level 20, not least due to what I saw as the absolute worst community I've ever seen in an mmo, (especially EP, though tried all three) and that's saying something.  Not two seconds out of Coldharbour and not even going to begin to recount the discussions I heard, but trust me, they were beyond awful.  Just do not understand why mmo companies don't realize that letting language / discussion like that run unchecked is going to turn away a ton of paying folks.   shrug  To the OP - would say Lotro or TSW have the best communities I've seen.  Would highly recommend! :)"

MMORPG,3d5jg5,Stovakor,9,Mon Jul 13 19:55:09 2015 UTC,"Guild Wars 2 has a great community in general. Most players are willing to help you on your quests/questions/jumping puzzles. It also has a healthy RP community which is increasing rare in mmorpg nowadays.   However, the community degrades if you venture into any kind of train (bosses or any sort of farm) or PvP/WvW, there GW2 community is no better than another back stabbing, bad mouthing, poor sportsmanship mmorpg, but I guess that's the same everywhere."

While you find nice guys here and there, many, especially with dungeons being out for so long, are pretty unfriendly.

MMORPG,3d5jg5,deadharts,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:32:08 2015 UTC,In my experience I find that all MMO's have nice community's once you turn off the global chat channels (that's where most of the ass hole types like to troll and be dickish). Get yourself a good social guild and a group of friends and you will generally have a great time. :)    I am yet to play an MMO where I haven't met any nice people at all.
MMORPG,3d5jg5,Meefius,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:32:56 2015 UTC,The Secret World and Lord of the Rings Online have the nicest community in my experience. It has probably to do with the large proportion of RP that's going on in both these games.  I'm not a roleplayer myself but I think they have a really good influence on server communities.
MMORPG,3d5jg5,PVDamme,2,Thu Jul 16 13:44:09 2015 UTC,"Everyone is going to have a different opinion, and they will typically be biased towards the game they play as well. I personally think FFXIV has a great community, the elitist-to-cool ratio seems to be better than any MMO I've played. For the record, I currently play FFXIV.  I found ESO to be lacking both in population and kindness. Most people I encountered seemed to feel the game was just an extension of Skyrim and did not want to be bothered or were rude.  Guild Wars 2 is pretty good, has decent content and a decent community. However, I did find a higher elitist ratio in that game. Also, the dungeon system just didn't sit well with me. Even at end game, it felt messy and far to free-for-all orientated. And end-game...well...it's fairly repetitive and lacking in my honest opinion.   Archeage has a horrible community. While a lot of the game play elements are cool, it's just chock full of a**hats and bots. Don't go near that game without sanitary gloves and a gas mask, as well as ear plugs and a few spare keyboards (because you will smash them)."
MMORPG,3d5jg5,Taffu,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:42:06 2015 UTC,Just started playing FFXIV and the community experience so far has been great. Joined a FC with members that gave me loads of tips and such.
MMORPG,3d5jg5,Grewen,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:33:05 2015 UTC,"Guild Wars 2 definitely. I usually see veterans helping out newer players, buying them sets of gear, giving them combat tips, even going as far as mentoring a new player all the way to max level.  I also see players saving GW2 keys that goes on sale to give them out in raffles, contest, or just because.  Dungeon groups are okay, so long as you join the ones that are listed as ""casual"" or ""all welcomed"". If you join a dungeon group that specifically wants a fast or meta run, and you don't meet their requirements, they are going to boot you.  GW2 also encourages cooperative player in the game design. The system allows node sharing, so you don't have to fight over material spawns or mob spawns. They also award your for helping out fellow players.  The pvp scene is competitive, so not surprising to see a jerk here or there."

MMORPG,3d5jg5,sylviidae,2,Tue Jul 14 12:08:29 2015 UTC,"Sorry to bother you on an outdated thread, but could you please share what is so unique about land ownership in Puzzle Pirates?"
MMORPG,3d5jg5,Villentrenmerth,2,Thu Jul 16 16:13:18 2015 UTC,"No problem! Where to begin... Let me give some background information. You have your crews, which is similar to a guild. There are ranks, such as pirate, officers, and captains, and upon achieving a certain fame (gained by pillaging or running a shoppe), you can join or create a flag with other crews (like an alliance of guilds). There are many Flags in Puzzle Pirates, and they all compete for some of the main prizes in game: an island. Yes! Players manage each and every habitable island in the entire game. As governor of an island, you have the power to create shoppes, manage taxes, and trade your local resources found on your flag's island. Some islands are home to thousands of Pirates (other players), and are quite massive.   Besides governing islands, you have shoppes. Every shoppe in the game is player owned and managed, AND it is a physical place on the map that anyone can walk up to and enter. Each owner can declare other pirates as managers, and together they gather the resources (via trading with Pirates from surrounding islands or pillaging trade routes) and they also set the prices. Yes, it is truly a player ran economy. Shoppes need labor however, so they pay hourly wages to Pirates to work at their shoppe (pay accumulates whether you're online or not, each pirate has a certain number of labor hours that can be used each day). If a pirate managers their shoppe poorly, it can even go out of business! All shoppes must pay property taxes each week to the Governor of the island. As I said before, the tax is set by the governor. There are iron mongers, ship  builders, tailors, apothecaries, carpenters, and distilleries. That's the basics of land ownership.  Another part of ownership is ships. Every pirate needs a ship. As you work your way up the pirate world, you can build your own ship, each varying in size and fire power, and you can customize then with paint and furniture to make it unique.   If you ever want to give the game a try, just pm me and I'll meet you in game and show you the basics! It has a great tutorial system in place as well. Everyone is extremely helpful."
MMORPG,3d5jg5,auzzimvp,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:33:35 2015 UTC,Thank you for this extensive information.  So basically: Sim City - Pirate Edition? It sounds awesome.
MMORPG,3d5jg5,Villentrenmerth,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:05:59 2015 UTC,"It is very awesome, but it isn't for everyone unfortunately. The community is very friendly and mature."
MMORPG,3d5jg5,auzzimvp,0,Fri Jul 17 00:24:35 2015 UTC,"Extremely dependent on your personality...  FFXIV: Feels like an anime meetup. Everyone is extremely nice, but kind of weird. Since most players take a casual approach to the game, this sort of social community tends to flourish.  GW2: Almost everyone I know who plays this game plays it for the PvP only. As I spend my time in PvP, you tend to hear things like ""y u so bad"" or just the genuine rage when your team is getting thrashed. Aside from those players, PvP requires a lot of teamwork and is a lot of fun when you meet the right people.  WoW: Adults who wish they were in high school or children who want to sound like they're in college.  Edit: I just noticed you mentioned loving the RO community... in that case, pick up FFXIV and find a good guild. You will spend more time sitting around your guild house talking to your teammates than you will actually playing the game. I loved the RO community way back when. I would not want that anymore, but if it's what you're looking for, I would recommend FFXIV 100%."

MMORPG,3d7da6,CondorInternational,3,Tue Jul 14 02:24:32 2015 UTC,"I've played both games so here is what I think  ESO  Crafting- The crafting in this game is pretty amazing becuase its actually worth doing. The reason being is because the gear you craft is just as good as the gear you find. There are even some special sets you can make that have unique effects.   DUNGEONS/RAIDS the dungeons in this game are very story driven and has a lot of dialogue to go through. IMO this makes the dungeon feel more alive and you can get very immersed in into the story. The dungeon designs are also pretty neat and unique compared to other MMOS I've played. The boss fights are pretty epic and enjoyable once you get the hang of them. There are also 12 trials which are just small team raids. I've never done these but I've heard they are fun ass hell.   CLASSES/RACES- there are only five classes to choose from and 10 races. If you've played any elder scroll games the races won't be a big surprise. The classes include dragonknight which uses fire based attacks. The Templar which uses holy attacks. Socrcerer is basically a mage. Finally you have your nightblade which is just a thief/assassin. You have your stereotypical classes, but like I said you can make your character how you want, so you are not limited. The great thing about the class system in this game is that you can make your character however you want. You can be a sorcerer dual wielding two swords and have a staff as your secondary weapon. Or a Templar wielding a staff and a bow. Sure those builds might not be the best, but it's fun as hell to try out different things while exploring or leveling.   EXPLOARATION- This game has a very big and beautiful world to explore thanks to the graphics. Exploring the world can be fun because there are interesting places to find. There are mini bosses to fight, public dungeons to explore, side quests scattered across the maps, and just beautiful scenery. The only thing that I dislike is that even though the world is beautiful it feels rather static and less dynamic.  GUILD WARS 2   CRAFTING- I have tried the crafting in this game and it is pretty interesting concept. Instead of just gathering the materials and making a helmet. You have to first make the helm base, then the helm lining, and finally you need a vial of blood to make the helmet, so extra steps are required to make your new helmet. Another unique thing is that yo need to discover new recipes by combing different parts that you created to make a new piece of equipment which can come with better stats. It is pretty entertaining trying to find new recipes.   DUNGEONS- Sadly there haven't been many new dungeons lately. They are also story driven, but not as immersing as ESO. Every boss you kill drops a chest and a other chest appears giving you ransom loot. It's loot whore paradise. The dungeons are rather easy if done in story mode, but if you do them in explorable mode they are tougher and comes with a whole new story to it. The bosses and the map layout are all different. There are also different paths you can take which chooses what bosses you fight. The fights are fun, but a lot of times can just be zerg fests.   CLASSES/RACES- There are four races and 8 classes in this game. the races are rather unique apart from your typical human. There is your charr, a big ass lion. The norn, a barbarian looking mofo. Asura little alien creatures. And sylvari,which are plant people made out of the earth. The classes include warrior, guardian, thief, ranger, necromancer, mesmer , engineer, elementalist,  and the new class that's coming soon revenant. There is a lot of choice when  it comes to picking a class. I really can't tell you much about mesmer or elementalist since I've never played them. There isn't as much depth in skills you can use, but there are combos you can create if you know to do them. Like putting down a fire field then shooting an arrow through it creates fire arrows.  It's pretty fun to find out combos. There is also a lot of customization due to all the different skins you can find. It's called fasionwars2 for a reason lol.   EXPLORATION- the most fun thing to do in this game is exploring the world.  The developers really did a good job with the environments. There are jungles, icy planes, volcanoes, deserts, forests, swamps, and many more. There are no quests instead in each zone there are hearts which requires you to do certain take to complete it, but you aren't required to do them if you don't want to. You literally get xp for everything you do. you get a lot of xp by just discovering new locations, cutting down a tree, completing dynamic events. The dynamic events are also very fun to do because they are started randomly and everyone in the zone can help you complete it and you all get your own rewards. There are also jumping puzzles which are hidden around the zones which require to complete so  random entertaining tasks with a treasure chest at the end.   Overall I enjoy both games, but as of recent I've been playing guild wars 2."
MMORPG,3d7da6,R3lentless,2,Tue Jul 14 11:01:40 2015 UTC,This pretty much nails it. Is there any news on when the VR system from ESO will be removed? That's the thing that killed the game for me - I just hit a wall.
MMORPG,3d7da6,punter007,3,Tue Jul 14 11:28:28 2015 UTC,VR is no longer being removed. In fact they are increasing the VR cap to 16! I hit the wall exactly as you described and it is the one thing that turns me off whenever I think of going back to the game.
MMORPG,3d7da6,Zienth,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:15:20 2015 UTC,"The designer said they're still planning on removing them. It's disheartening to see they're delaying it even more, but it looks like their higher priority is to push content before more system wide changes. The last major update was only a system wide change update and the community is getting really antsy for new stuff to do. They're also significantly reducing the XP needed to go up in VRs as well as increasing experience rewards from a lot of sources, so the wall is at least starting to crumble."

MMORPG,3d7da6,Trestar11,6,Tue Jul 14 18:04:23 2015 UTC,"Probably not the best person to answer this (my tastes aren't in line with the mainstream), but:  I put about 25 days /played into ESO when it came out because of the DAoC inspired PvP which blew me away. Joined a top PvP guild, entered Cyrodiil and never looked back (managed to get ~15th in line for Emperor, which I'm simultaneously proud and embarrassed of). Had an absolute blast, but I did not care for the PvE as it was hyper-linear and too story driven for my tastes (I'm not into story in an MMO). I actually ended up doing the AoE mob-grinding routes to level and because the class and combat systems are so good (IMO), I actually preferred that to the available story/quests.  As far as Guild Wars 2, it's so casually focused I never could play it for more than an hour or so at a time and ultimately never actually got into the game. I think my highest level character is 14...It just bored me. It's one of those games that has to barf a reward at you every 2.5 seconds, and nothing about it even remotely appealed to me. Be that as it may, there are plenty of people that would tell you Guild Wars 2 is one of the best MMO's currently available, but I'm certainly not one of them.  My vote: ESO for the unique PvP and if you like story driven PvE. Also I much prefer the class/combat/char build systems in ESO."
MMORPG,3d7da6,naiets,3,Tue Jul 14 03:05:14 2015 UTC,"I may have to give ESO another chance or something. I played in Beta and shortly after launch, but I never leveled past 20 on anything I made. If the PvP is that great, I might push through.   However I heard all that veteran rank stuff is insanely grindy. Will veteran ranks impact PvP?"
MMORPG,3d7da6,punter007,-1,Tue Jul 14 03:37:55 2015 UTC,"Veteran Ranks will be removed in the future, being phased out by Champion Points.  Veteran Ranks will most definitely affect every aspect of the game as there are VR equipment and VR crafting. When phased out by CP, VR gear will be reworked to scale with max level 50, although no details on exactly how they're going to do it.  Champion Points, which are now already available, are a sort of infinite leveling-past-max with passive buffs, like Skyrim where you got Legendary specs that in time you can max out all the trees. They do affect PvP but not to the extent of gear and builds."

MMORPG,3d7da6,naiets,3,Tue Jul 14 11:24:20 2015 UTC,With over 4k hrs on GW2 (~166 days) and over 90 days on ESO I honestly still prefer GW2 WvW over ESO Alliance War. That said I like both games. Both have improved a lot since launch as well. Honestly I think they both kinda have the same flaw of no real non PVP endgame other than just doing stuff over again. That doesn't bother me much seeing how the PvP is the part I mainly play.
MMORPG,3d7da6,sardonyxdragoon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:21:10 2015 UTC,"GW2 is the most fun PvP I've ever had in 10 years of playing MMOs. I hate to say it but you're missing out on at least as much fun as you had in ESO, especially if you're not into PvE. Join a big sPvP and WvW focused guild and there is lots of good fun to have. The magic of GW2 is when you're fighting as a group. A lot of people say that GW2 is inferior since it lacks a trinity system, however the combo field system shines when you have a group of people who know how to play their build."
MMORPG,3d7da6,Micro2Cuts,-1,Tue Jul 14 06:06:21 2015 UTC,"I am on the boat with ESO, mainly because GW2 classes lack identity and the gameplay is very much about ""getting the biggest numbers so you can win"". It's all DPS or bust.  ESO PvE is for the most part very easy but group content still require people to fill roles. Healing in the game is relatively easy but satisfying, and being a healer main that makes me very happy."
MMORPG,3d7da6,Misiok,2,Tue Jul 14 03:50:47 2015 UTC,"I'm currently playing both atm, here's my 2 cents. eso: im only lvl 15 and just unlocked the second weapon bar, the game for me is much more enjoyable if i stop and smell the flowers(or pick them..) and really let the quest stories flow(read into all the quests, don't just skip them), i find when i try to rush and skip the quests and just try to hurry i lose my feel for the game and switch to gw2. Also, with eso i am really hard pressed for money atm, which frustrates me because the only way I've found to make enough for a mount is to steal large amounts of items, which i always fail at and get caught...without a mount i feel walking around everywhere can be slow, but i hear there's a skill in cyrodil to help you run faster.  gw2: I've enjoyed everything about this game, only draw back is it feels that everybody playing has been on for years and has the most badass gear and cosmetics already and i'm this lowly geared warrior trying to break into endgame. I'm still trying to figure out how to get geared at the endgame atm, slowly making progress. However, the leveling experience has been the most fun i've ever had leveling in a game and I am very happy about the one time pay to have such an enjoyable experience. Also, pvp is loads of fun."

MMORPG,3d5nlw,Kenpokid4,2,Wed Jul 15 14:09:31 2015 UTC,"I don't personally mind Race locked classes as it makes sense due to characteristics of the race depending on lore. We even see games where even if gender based classes in lore are not used in the actual game itself. Warcraft for example, male night elves were the only ones to be druids while females could be Priestess and Wardens. Thankfully, they didn't go with gender based classes.  Races though,  Dwarves are less arcane while having the the affinity towards production (blacksmith, leathermaking)   Elves who are more in tune with spirits and better with crafts (alchemy enchanting)   Humans who are around the middle and well rounded   Sub Races like Drow who are more martial (hand to hand) over arcane or Barbarians clans who forsake arcane magic for shamanistic if that.   This is why usually in a lot of RPGs Holy magic (Paladin, Clerics) are usually not elves, which in turn has classes such as Druids and Elvish gods (if they believe in any) are more natural compared to the gods of Man and Dwarves. Basically the separate belief over Faith and Spirits."

I think Tera went a nice way there, the classes all have different animations depending on race and gender combo... It's a lot of work, though."

MMORPG,3d5nlw,paradoxpancake,-3,Wed Jul 15 19:28:25 2015 UTC,That's strawman. Riven and Katarina are champions and they're not really classes so much as they are established heroes. The fact is that Tera has limited males to the same classes that have been around since release (which has been a few years now) while limited new content exclusively to those with female characters. Not everyone wants to play a female avatar.

What if TERA called Elf Gunners a new ""character"" instead of a new class? The fact is En Masse is not some evil company bent on preventing males from making new characters. They didn't have the budget to make an entire new class so they made a partial one. It is entirely optional, males still have 7 entire other classes to play, and furthermore it is all cosmetic. What if WoW decided to release 3 new classes entirely for females tomorrow. How ridiculous would it be to quit the game for adding content?"

MMORPG,3d49zx,Tyestor,2,Tue Jul 14 08:29:11 2015 UTC,"As others have said, WoW currently has Australian servers.      There are a few others that used to from memory: Ultima Online had them Warhammer Online had them which is why I kept playing until they shut them down. Star Wars: The Old Republic had them but given the games implosion they also got shut down after a couple of years.     I really wish Tera had them but obviously never going to happen now. I can't bring myself to play any of the upcoming 'action combat' mmo's without them because it's just frustrating. Tab target games you can at least  compensate and be competitive/useful."

MMORPG,3d49zx,Tyestor,4,Tue Jul 14 03:33:51 2015 UTC,that wasn't the question.
MMORPG,3d49zx,willxcore,-1,Mon Jul 13 19:00:41 2015 UTC,GW2 doesn't have localized servers. AFAIK US servers are hosted in Texas and EU servers are hosted in Germany. That doesn't stop Oceanic players from having a good time. Tarnished Coast and Sea of Sorrows (server names) have a VERY healthy Oceanic population that contributes a TON to the performance of the servers during WvW seasons. We were literally paying people in gold to stay up and command groups in the middle of the night to defend against the hordes Oceanic players on those servers.
MMORPG,3d49zx,Tyestor,3,Mon Jul 13 20:36:58 2015 UTC,OP is asking for oceanic servers. this means one of two things.   servers hosted in the oceanic region (OP is asking for this). servers marked as oceanic.   gw2 has neither.

There was nothing else that I could work on.), Final Fantasy XIV on PS4 (very flashy but very monotonous). Dark Souls 1 & 2 (awesome gameplay and storyline but the online portion wasn't satisfying enough for me)  What is your playstyle (Casual,Semi-Casual,Hardcore)?: Semi-Casual.

Modern day RS (As in not OSRS) isn't all that grindy these days unless you want to experience the most cutting-edge content, and it's arguably one of the most content-rich games to exist.  While the game is focused very heavily on a rock-paper-scissors combat triangle (Ranged counters Magic, Magic counters Melee, Melee counters Ranged), the combat system actually works quite well, especially since the Evolution of Combat changes."

MMORPG,3d49db,Brisholine,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:02:51 2015 UTC,"Life is Feudal seems to be pretty close to what you want.  Elder Scrolls Online is slightly realistic. You can go around pickpocketing and stealing in towns or just straight up attack the townspeople. If you want to craft something you have to either find a recipe or experiment with different ingredients, you don't just automatically know things. If an enemy is trying to cast a spell you can shove them to cancel it. Though it still has its fair share of unrealistic features like fire not even phasing the enemy, etc."

Something with semi-heavy to heavy character creation. And maybe hotbars similar to GW2, where there are not ability heavy like FFXIV and WoW. A decent veriety of classes to choose from, or something like Flyff.  Though its highly unlikely and not really needed, anything that supports controllers similar to FFXIV.

It is currently subscription, but you can buy it from Gamestop for $10.  This is a really good deal, as it comes with one of three items that you can only get from buying the physical copy.  These items sell for a decent amount, and can buy you up to 3~4 months of play time (you can spend in-game currency to buy game time).  It is the most challenging content, and some of the most fun I've had in an MMO.  You don't have to worry about having a thousand ability bars and a 10 button rotation to be good.

For me, when I queue for dungeons, my longest queue is like 5 minutes at most.  There's also people throughout the game doing the lvl 50 events.  I'd say expect a solo experience while leveling (there's almost no grinding needed while leveling) which helps you continuously get acclimated to end-game playing (like stacking interrupts to get moment of opportunities to interrupt their cast, to do 2.5x the damage).  You can queue for dungeons while leveling, and every now and then they should pop.  Because of RL reasons, I've been playing super casually, but if I had the time, I'd be raiding.

I've spent a lot of time playing RO, and although it had issues it was the best balance of PVP/Meta/PVE content for me personally. I've since played Dragon Next, D3, Wow for a bit but didn't get into it. Then gave up and just played some FPS.  What is your playstyle (Casual,Semi-Casual,Hardcore)? I'm a pretty hardcore player in the sense that I will want perfect items, with the perfect roll to maximize my mini/max damage, I get nerdy over those things and I used to spend a lot of time with RO coming up with new builds and calculating my damage/resistance to get the perfect balance.  I like PVP more then PVE, but don't mind having a fun boss fight with a cool team.  I also just enjoy sitting in a town talking to people and making friends, helping overs with items/gears/builds/grinding  Any preferred mechanics?  I really enjoy games with a deep meta, loads of class/items/cards. I feel the possibility to find new builds/status/combos is great. I also enjoy PVP that needs skill to win, one game I briefly played was Dragonica and no matter how skilled you was if your gear wasn't as good you would lose and I hated it for that.  Anything specific you want to exclude? Dragonica, DN, WoW."

I enjoyed WoW most around Wrath, now the phasing is ridiculous.   I've played WoW, SWTOR and some random ones here and there. Always go back to WoW  I'm pretty casual. Enjoy raiding in a non serious environment.   No pay to win. I'm down for a sub if the game is good."
MMORPG,3d49db,Brisholine,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:17:11 2015 UTC,Since you always seem to go back to WoW then maybe consider giving RIFT a try. It's pretty much WoW without the subscription.  Final Fantasy XIV is also another game that many WoW players have migrated to.

What games have you previously played?: Started a ton of MMOs, didnt stick with one, although I played LoTRO a lot. What is your playstyle (Casual,Semi-Casual,Hardcore)?: Not casual, not hardcore either. I play a lot, but I also have a job.  Any preferred mechanics?: Lots of crafting, I don't mind grinding within certain limits. Grinding a few hours from time to time is no deal-breaker, but it also shouldn't be too mind numbing. Preferaby with a lots of things to do besides combat, for example housing, guilds, events, exploration, achievements, crafting.  Anything specific you want to exclude?: It should be a MMORPG, not something like Eve, I wanna play as my character and feel him progress. Also it should not be a pay to win game. I have no problems paying for a game, paying for vanity etc or paying a subscription. I don't view xp booster as pay2win, but items that give you extra stats are, no doubt.

Preferably something that works minimized or off screen, so I don't have to dedicate too much attention to it.  What games have you previously played?:   Eve, WoW, GW2, most F2P titles.

MMORPG,3d49db,Brisholine,2,Tue Jul 14 13:36:34 2015 UTC,"Runescape is usually the game of choice that you can just ""afk"" and do other things while playing it. It doesn't require much attention unless you're working through quests.  Albion Online is like the grown up version of Runescape.  The Elder Scrolls Online and RIFT both have many different skills to level up that don't require much attention. However, other in game activities require slightly more attention."

Albion looks awesome and has been on my eye for a while, but I don't buy into early access / founders packs.  I've been looking into TES for months, but I don't know anyone playing it and just don't feel like putting down the cash for such a time investment i'm unsure of (although I still have 3mo of WoW x.x)  I played RIFT for quite some time and really enjoyed it, but the end game was a bit dull and I've had my time with that world."
MMORPG,3d49db,Brisholine,2,Tue Jul 14 14:49:17 2015 UTC,"/r/Runescape is super helpful and they have clans that you might be able to get into. There's also other resources on there like tools so that you can keep Runescape in the background while doing other things like watching videos, etc.  I've been playing TESO for awhile now and I've been having lots of fun just playing by myself. The quests are actually interesting, it's not your standard ""kill 10 of these"" kinds of quests. You're actually accomplishing things when you do them. I waited for a sale before I bought it though."

What is your playstyle? Not having to stress, but relax and enjoy the enviroment while questing.  Any preferred mechanics? Good character customization, not a lot of pvp. Good class variety is great.  Games Played: TERA, WoW(Mostplayed), Aura Kingdom(Liked it a lot), Path of Exile(Loved it, but got kinda bored of it), Trove(Loved it), Neverwinter, Guild Wars 2, SWTO, Eden Eternal(Liked it a lot), Spiral Knights, runescape(liked it)  Preferred Genres (Fantasy, Sci-Fi, etc.): I can try anything, even tho I'm not a Sci-Fi fan.  Pricing Model: Free to play or any steam games. I have some cash on steam that I could spend. No p2w, but an item mall is cool.  Favorite Features: Crafting, enchanting, gathering, skill tree  Eastern or Western: Both is good  Combat Type: A fun variety of spells and attacks would be cool, combat styles like TERA and WoW are fine.  Preferred Perspective(eg FP, Over-the shoulder, isometric etc): Over-the shoulder  Graphics Preference: They don't have to be ''top-notch''. Decent graphics is fine.

I gonna start the List backwards: I just want to exclude P2W, because it's boring and stupid.  Preferred mechanics: This is the core im looking for. Im looking for a Pet Mechanic, which lets you train your pet to do stuff, or use a program to use this Pet. RagnaroK Online had this mechanic a long time ago and it was awesome, but i would love to have something bigger. More in the direction of ""the pet is doing the work while i watch"" kinda game.   Well the requiered Playstyle doesnt really matter. I've played so many MMO's before that i dont want to write the List down. Its long ... and it contains most of the well common MMOs.

The most i remember Wow,Flyff,Lineage 2, Wildstar,Ragnarok Online, RO 2, Wildstar, FF 14, ESO, Skyforge, Archeage, Rift, GW2, Eden Eternal, Aion, name a F2P and i probably played it    What is your playstyle?: As stated before i can play 4 hours every day for 2 weeks and next i can play 4 hours in 1 week, but if i like the game, i play it intensively    Any preferred mechanics?: I like streategy game so i realy love to manage things, like housing, farming, fishing etc, i'm a total anime fan and i like ""action"" combat still, it bust feel ""fluid"" (for example, ESO combat, for me, isn't fluid. Tera and wildstar are a lot more fluid)    Anything specific you want to exclude?: ARCHEAGE, Pay to Play, and most P2W, if it's a light p2w i don't mind."

Definitely keep on eye on it for when it does go on sale next because it's entirely focused on adventuring.  The quests are very involved, you'll never get a quest that says ""kill 10 of these."" As for the support class, you could be a templar and spend all your skill points in restoration staff and restoring light skills. Or if you want more of the buffing support class you could be a Nightblade and spend your skill points in siphoning skills. You can even still get a restoration staff as a Nightblade and be a healing/buffing rogue as strange as that sounds."

MMORPG,3d49db,molever1ne,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:42:44 2015 UTC,"What are you looking for?  I'm looking for a game that has the following:   Fun/interactive combat  I'd prefer to stay away from the ""stand in one place and hit the hotkeys of the most efficient rotation"" style of combat. Guild system that will actively draw me into a group.  In other words, something that is more than just a more efficient way to get a PUG going.  Defending territory or having some other reason to be in a guild. Free to play is preferable, as long as it's not pay to win.  I'm okay subbing, but I really prefer the model of GuildWars or The Secret World where you buy in and then there's no monthly fee and you just pay for content updates. Not horribly grindy.  Some grind is expected, but if the gameplay is fun, grinding can be, too. An economy where crafting can be relevant.  This isn't the most important, but I do like to make things.   What games have you previously played?   Star Wars Galaxies (wonderfully free-form, but a terrible grind.  Also ancient history now) Star Wars: The Old Republic (great story, but the combat is very 'meh' to me and there's no real draw to joining a guild) World of Warcraft (never made it past ~40) Lineage (Played a long time ago and barely remember it) Lineage 2 (Same as Lineage) Guild Wars 2 (Currently have an active character, but I don't really play.) The Secret World (I LOVE the setting, I just don't really care for the gameplay) EVE Online (Another one where I love the setting and the corporation mechanics; I'm sure I'll be back someday.  In the meantime, I'm looking for something a little less cutthroat) Tera (The combat was pretty fun and depending on the class, I didn't really mind grinding.  I just don't want to pay $15/mo for it.  On top of that, the guilds seemed pretty limited.) WildStar (Fun, zone-based combat.  Fun art style and a decent housing system.  Something I might go back to if the community is still viable.  No real point to joining a guild, though.) Archeage (kinda forgetable, really) Defiance (okay gameplay, but something that I definitely find to be ""okay because it's free"".  If I had to pay I'd be very unhappy)   What is your playstyle?  I'd describe myself as a casual to semi-casual player.  If the game is good, I might be on every evening; I just won't be held to a schedule and I don't want to spend 5 hours doing a raid.  The common thread that has kept me from staying with a game is that often the fun/$ ratio isn't quite there.  A game with a deep guild system where there is a point to joining up, and where I can actively help to benefit my fellow guild-members would be a huge draw.  It's what I love about EVE, I just EVE to be more stressful than I want in a game I use to relax.  Thanks in advance for any tips/advice!  EDIT: Added a couple more games I've played."
MMORPG,3d49db,Brisholine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:05:39 2015 UTC,"The Elder Scrolls Online is definitely what you want. You can dodge roll around in combat, shove people when they're trying to cast a spell, most abilities require you to aim, and you'll definitely be moving around. From my experience it's not pay to win in the slightest. You level by grinding quests but they're extremely involved and very interesting/fun. The crafting system is immense just like any Elder Scrolls games. From my experience it's slightly hard to get into because you have to find recipes in order to craft most things but it's still rewarding when you get to actually craft things.  I'm not really familiar with the guild system however. I haven't made it far enough into the game to experience guilds."

What games have you previously played?: WoW, GW2, Albion Online, Archeage, and EVE are the games I've invested the most time into with Albion being my favorite- but as it's still in alpha I'm looking for something to tide me over. What is your playstyle (Casual,Semi-Casual,Hardcore)?: Semi-Casual/Hardcore depending on how invested I get. Any preferred mechanics?: Skill Trees preferably where one meta doesn't rule them all. Skill based PVP and gear inflation at a minimum- it's ok if it's there so long as it's not to the point where one tier higher makes you a god to anyone with less. Anything specific you want to exclude?: Anything with a cash shop directed at getting players powerful faster- exp is fine, gold is fine, but directly boosting their power or efficiency is a massive turnoff for me.

MMORPG,3d49db,sunkzero,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:03:03 2015 UTC,"What are you looking for?: MMO with decent PvE and good PvP; prefer fantasy but am open to sci-fi or other genres; nice graphics (although don't have to be top quality 2015 standard!) and decent choice of gear for customising character appearance; preferably something like AA would have been without the p2w nonsense; something that encourages group play (and pretty much requires for the ""best"" in-game activities) but allows a little solo play when wanting a quiet session  What games have you previously played?: Most of them, am an MMO addict :P  although I suspect I've missed some decent sandboxes as I was playing all themeparks until very recently  What is your playstyle (Casual,Semi-Casual,Hardcore)?: Semi-casual on average. Some weeks I'll play a lot, other weeks I'll log on once and just grind up a few craft mats for an hour  Any preferred mechanics?: Sandboxie, group play encouraged, decent pve and pvp, reasonable population so I can find a guild (and not a population that are a bunch of elitist assholes), housing/guild housing/in world cities etc a huge bonus; lots of choice to customise outfits on the character also a bonus  Anything specific you want to exclude?: p2w; pointless grindfests; asshole community  Am considering giving UO a whirl but I'm not sure of how active it is"

Albion looks interesting, but I'll wait for release and some early comments before I dive into that.  I'm not sure WS is what I'm looking for at all - I played it on release and got bored with the poor quests and is one of the few MMO's I've played where I gave up before max level, and it's not really what I call a sandbox either.

MMORPG,3d49db,i55hungay,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:26:35 2015 UTC,"What are you looking for?:   ANY online game that allows me to be a child character. Doesn't matter if it's an MMORPG, MMOFPS, or MMO of any other kind.      What games have you previously played?:   Latest was Eden Eternal. Doesn't quite have what I need.      What is your playstyle (Casual,Semi-Casual,Hardcore)?:   Casual and Semi-Casual, I guess. I have a life, so I don't get harder-core than that.      Any preferred mechanics?:   Whatever do you mean? I'd prefer 3D, so no MapleStory and other old-school sidescrollers.      Anything specific you want to exclude?:   Anything that's not 3D. Also, anything with inconsistencies, like Eden Eternal - the inconsistency that turned me off was seeing a CAR as a mount in a world where we mostly fight with swords, axes, bows-&-arrows, and magic.  If I get to be a child character in a game that has cars, that game's setting also has to look 20th century or later. I don't settle well with games that have a few 20th-century elements, but mostly elements of magic-fantasy worlds and centuries past. I need an MMO world to be more CONSISTENT, so no anachronisms without good reason (i.e. a time-traveling sub-plot; something that makes sense to have a 20th-century object in a 15th-century world, or vice-versa.)  Also, let's not have Tera, because there's no boy race to complement the Elin. I'd like to play a boy character first."

It'd be interesting to play a character who doesn't have to carry around a heavy shield, but also doesn't flail a second weapon in the offhand.  What games have you previously played?: I'm honestly somewhat of a newbie here, I've tried a few before, and I'm furthest into Mabinogi, 9Dragons, but I've never found a stable group of mates to play an MMO with so I've never been able to properly situate myself in a game.  What is your playstyle (Casual,Semi-Casual,Hardcore)?: As a gamer overall, I'd love to say Hardcore, but because of my lack of experience in MMO's I'll have to say Semi-Casual?

I'm a fan of pretty much all aspects, PvE, PvP, Casual content (Housing, crafting (sometimes), etc.)  What games have you previously played?: Wildstar, ESO (those are the two biggies, I've played them and I loved them to death), dabbled in GW2, DCUO, Champions Online, (also a fan of superhero games, I love the genre), plus too many F2P MMO's to count.

I'm a fan of PvP as well so fun battlegrounds/arenas are always a plus, but not necessary. Another biggie is INTERESTING QUESTING/LEVELLING.

MMORPG,3d49db,blitzgun2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:21:26 2015 UTC,"What are you looking for?: A 'standard' MMO, probably fantasy-ish themed (like WoW). I'm honestly not sure how else to describe it.   What games have you previously played?:   Aika. Not well-known but I loved it, but stopped playing it since it was so pay-to-win and also the game was just dying WoW. I liked it fine, especially since everyone was on ~equal level since it's pay-to-play instead of free-to-play-but-pay-to-win, but I'm not sure if I want to continue since I'd have to keep buying expansions and I've been hearing some drama about it anyway. By the way, if anyone wants to give their opinion on going back to WoW, feel free! I played a few months ago with the Christmas deal that was like $15 for everything excluding Warlords of Draenor (spelling?) so I got up to level 90. ElSword. Fun game, and I wouldn't say there's anything wrong with it, per se, but I guess I prefer a true 3D game. Mabinogi. Honestly didn't really like it since I felt so ""slow"" and I was absolutely terrible at the combat system--I blamed the combat system and how bad it was but it's possible I was just bad.   What is your playstyle (Casual,Semi-Casual,Hardcore)?: Semi-Casual. I like PvE. I'm not the biggest fan of PvP so I definitely don't want a game where PvP is on all the time and people can kill you anytime they like (side note: Aika was like that but due to the unique mechanics I won't get into it was a lot easier to deal with). I like being good at the game, high-ranked, good items etc. But I can't sink years of my life into it since I'm at school and so on.  Any preferred mechanics?: I love mechanics that complexify the itemization process. e.g. crafting, enchanting, anything that can make items more unique for characters. Obviously I like PvE. I also like a little bit of ""off-topic/time-waste"" stuff to do like fishing although it doesn't matter too much. I'd prefer a combat system that is somewhat in-depth (read: I love having 50 different skills to use in combat). Edit: Also I'd prefer that it's harder to level up so that the histogram of user levels is actually moderately spread out.  Anything specific you want to exclude?: Extreme pay-to-win games. I'm OK with free-to-play (which by definition have to make money via an in-game store that sells things), but the p2w can't be so extreme that it's like ""Pay $9 and you instantly get this armor set that otherwise you'd have to grind for 4 weeks to get."" Also I'd prefer a game that's either getting a larger userbase or is at least going strong. I don't really know how to explain it but I hate the feeling of playing a game you know is going out of business and the world just gets more and more empty and fewer and fewer users are logging on.  So yeah, any comments are appreciated. Especially on if I should continue WoW; and what about ESO? Any good?  Thanks everyone! <3"
MMORPG,3d49db,RustyDoctor,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:25:45 2015 UTC,"-What are you looking for?   Anything really, I love MMO's, I absolutely love fantasy.  -What games have you previously played?   Rift, ArcheAge, WoW, GW2 (For whatever reason, GW2 crashes after 5-10 minutes of play), Wildstar (got stale fast for me).  -What is your playstyle (Casual,Semi-Casual,Hardcore)?   Casual, though, if I do get into a game I can develop a hardcore play style.  -Any preferred mechanics?   Fun. No, but really, I like to craft, I like end game content, be it PvE or PvP, so long as it's enjoyable. I don't mind a grind, but not to the extent of FFXIV, it feels a lot more grind yourself to death than others, to me, anyway.  -Anything specific you want to exclude?   There isn't anything I really want to exclude except for Pay-To-Win. Also, floaty animation, not really a fan but it doesn't bother me too much.  (just a side note: Considering taking up Rift or ArcheAge again, anyone able to give me some insight as to how these games have developed? I played some Rift on release, never raided though, in ArcheAge, I enjoyed myself, a lot, I played the beta and a bit at launch but nothing since, if someone could give me a brief summary of what's changed, that'd be awesome.  EDIT: Formatting."
MMORPG,3d49db,krisko612,0,Sun Jul 19 10:31:29 2015 UTC,"I used to play MMO rhythm games such as O2Jam and DJMax back around 2006-2007 before they were both shut down. The reason I played them was not for the multiplayer or social elements, but simply because I was looking for great rhythm games to play on PC, and both games (especially DJMax) served that need very well.  I don't have that much interest in the social aspect of MMORPGs, though I wouldn't mind running into a few human players here and there. If I was simply looking for a new RPG to play, regardless of the MMO elements, which one would be the best? I've heard that SWTOR offers strong single-player content, but given the reportedly up and down state of the game I'm not sure I want to invest in that. I remember one of my roommates in college buying it then a couple months later it went free to play. I tried WOW in the past but gave it up after 10 minutes of play as it was doing absolutely nothing for me.  I would prefer something where I could avoid crafting and PVP as I have little interest in those. Just some fun combat and an engaging storyline will do."

MMORPG,3d4aw8,Ashernrao,2,Mon Jul 13 12:17:53 2015 UTC,Skysaga is really good but at the current pace the open beta will be ready in 2017 while Landmark I doubt it will ever be finished (as EQNext I mean).
MMORPG,3d4aw8,Mantequillaaa,2,Mon Jul 13 15:28:50 2015 UTC,"Oort just looks like Minecraft with a mod pack.  Don't know what all the hype is about.  Trove is loads of fun until the incredible grind sets in.  You must grind until your eyes bleed for every single thing in the game.  Nothing wrong with grinding, but Trove's grinding feels as brain dead and unsatisfying as you can get.  SkySaga is the most unique, gorgeous game and has the most potential of any of these.  I keep wanting to get back to it, but hey, Terraria 1.3 just dropped...."
MMORPG,3d4aw8,NonBritGit,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:52:39 2015 UTC,"Trove is fun but it gets very repetitive.  The biomes and dungeons feel small and it has that typical problem with hack n' slash type games where you just get flooded with too much rng gear and you have to stop every 5 min and clean out your bag.  People who like Diablo style games will probably love this though.  I'm of the old school, where I find it more satisfying to adventure for hours for that one piece of amazing gear.  More like Zelda or Ultima.  Skysaga on the other hand has better pacing IMO.  The biomes are quite large and the maps have ""fog of war"", making it so you have to actually explore the maps to discover interesting locations (you can't just open your map).  When you get a good piece of gear in Skysaga it's exciting.  Also fun is when you finally find that hard to get keystone colour that doesn't match your biome, allowing you to make a key to get to a new biome type.   I'm a huge fan of  this system as it promotes exploration.  The starting island is much larger than Trove's housing space as well, allowing you a lot of land to build on.    Although still in alpha Skysaga is shaping up to be a more substantial adventure game it seems.  It's like Zelda meets Minecraft."

MMORPG,3d3ile,kainsshadow,4,Mon Jul 13 08:56:58 2015 UTC,"I still remember last year when I got to play in the closed beta and was telling all my friends how it would ""kill all other MMORPGs"". For a few days/weeks, I was continuously preaching to everyone how great it is and that it's everything we ever needed.  I quit 2 months after launch.  It feels horrible. The potential was there but certain decisions the devs made (or didn't) killed it for me. I'm still upset about it."

MMORPG,3d3ile,sinni800,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:06:38 2015 UTC,Not that I know of. Since getting into alpha wasn't cheap I assume there are people out there that could have the resources to do it but at the same time if they had the means they could have just used their money in the retail game and became a god anyways so why would they want to? haha idk either way private servers are a long way off dream if they ever become a reality. Takes a lot of time and data collection to make one.
MMORPG,3d3ile,kainsshadow,2,Tue Jul 14 14:55:09 2015 UTC,"Yep... But I sure hope the community takes vengeance if it's that bad. Maybe let it die, then make a private server and let the thriving begin. I know it's gonna be a few metric tons of work, but the way I see people complain, it could be damn worth it."
MMORPG,3d3ile,sinni800,4,Tue Jul 14 18:34:46 2015 UTC,ArcheAge is definitely one of my favorite MMORPG but cashshop destroyed the game..  Star Wars Galaxies and ArcheAge are my top 2 MMO I played  use to like World of Warcraft but it became super casual and Garrison singleplayer basically  TERA was alright but endgame was boring and didnt had the freedom to do stuff like ArcheAge/SWG
MMORPG,3d3ile,Bierno,2,Mon Jul 13 17:18:11 2015 UTC,"It was basically ""Here's all these amazing new things we're including. Have fun..."" Oh, btw, they're all locked behind paywalls"
MMORPG,3d3ile,TypoHero,3,Mon Jul 13 18:31:25 2015 UTC,Those god dam RNG boxes... I mean a lot of f2p games have them but AA literally locked EVERYTHING cool in the shop and shoved it in those boxes... thats where I just said F**K IT.
MMORPG,3d3ile,kainsshadow,2,Tue Jul 14 02:52:09 2015 UTC,"To be fair until the trees which was pretty far after launch the boxes were almost purely cosmetic.   They just gave you random items from the cash shop with a chance to get lucky and get a pet.   Even then the game balanced itself out with costs overnight albeit if you had been hording thunderstruck trees you would of been pissed.   I know im in the minority but I see AA's system of Plex or Isk or what ever they called it very much the same as Eve Online, you can pay to win if you want to but you dont have to.  That being said I probably spent $400+ on it because I was in a guild that was trying to dominate the server and needed max labor on all characters at all times....so perhaps im not best to judge.  Either way I quit after that new continent came out because dark runners wernt needed in the 10 man raid because melee were so severely disadvantaged and I couldnt be bothered trying to regear a ranged class after spending 12 hours a day for months on it."
MMORPG,3d3ile,A_Sleeping_Fox,3,Tue Jul 14 11:00:36 2015 UTC,"I never said boxes were p2w i said lockig all cool mounts and costumes behind a gamble box is just a shitty thing for a company to do. And i would say spending 400 bucks to help your guild dominate a server is the very definition of p2w trash xD i had no issuewith being able to pay for the subscription with in game gold, it was the fact that you could pay for your sub and then STILL feel necessary to spend more and more just to stay competetive. The game made you feel like you needed to spend more to get ahead and it was definitely true. Youre bringing up systems that are not p2w by themselves but the way trion did it they were very much so despite it.  Edit: just to add the fact you got archeum in those boxes after they ninja nerfed its drop rate in game made them very much p2w as well but im not gonna argue over it lol"
MMORPG,3d3ile,kainsshadow,2,Tue Jul 14 11:34:33 2015 UTC,"My mistake sorry I get what your saying now and yeah I probably spent over $400 but still even if the cash shop didnt exist I would of spent that on gold from 3rd party sites anyway. The existance of the cash shop really just made it easier to buy directly from Trion than China.  I've been playing MMO's for 17 years and every time i've gone hard in a top guild we all have to succumb to china, its just the only way to stay competitive. Hell I was buying gold in the 90's in EverQuest just to stay ahead heh.  I agree with a lot of what you said but think the largest issue is that in a game with crazy rng and having crafted items tradeable which are best in slot you create a culture of throwing money at the slot machine to get the best gear and that pisses people off.  Most of us want high end raid gear thats no drop being best in slot, not slot machine maybe it will blow up maybe it wont crap."
MMORPG,3d3ile,A_Sleeping_Fox,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:51:20 2015 UTC,"Basically RNG based gear and cash shop doesn't make it fun or ""difficult"" to get. It just turns it into gambling where frustration is the most common outcome.

MMORPG,3d3ile,kainsshadow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:58:23 2015 UTC,"Haha thanks for letting it slide and in games other than Archeage it really makes little difference other than the initial race, most MMO's have bind on pickup as the top tier gear so that gold buying is irrelevant, at very worst your using it to buy gems/socket things.  Totally agree RNG based gear is a crappy system and AA could really do with some more end game PvE thats tough but is top tier.  Now if you want to be able to regrade your no-drop top tier raiding gear that you spent months aquiring, well power to you, but simply being able to buy the best with gold is a crappy game we both agree."
MMORPG,3d3ile,A_Sleeping_Fox,0,Tue Jul 14 17:48:48 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more :( I mained Darkrunner, enjoyed the open world PvP and played that shit like 8 hours a day.  I was even f2p, I played with Hasla gear and heroic GHA, and I was even considered one of the good PvPers on the east side.  ... until the game went completely p2w... still trying to find a game to replace it, but just spamming CS GO and LoL now"

The things that would have to change for me to come back... :|  I'm still searching for something to fill the void, but none of the current MMO's appeal to me. Maybe I would get into GW2 but I'm too short on cash to afford both game and expansion. My WoW phase is over, TERA is too much style and too little substance, I don't like FFXIV at all, ESO is mindnumbingly boring to me. What else is there, Wildstar maybe? Meh.   Filling the time with other game genres now, at least I have some titles to look forward to this year.

MMORPG,3d49ua,whyufail1,2,Mon Jul 13 17:37:20 2015 UTC,It's basically Phantasy Star Online...and that's why I love it.  My only complaint is the spark cap is REALLY low.  I didn't play very hardcore at all...and I hit it yesterday and now have to wait until Wednesday. (I had friends who hit it on day 1)
MMORPG,3d49ua,SOLIDAge,3,Mon Jul 13 19:27:08 2015 UTC,"That's relatively subjective to what each person considers ""hardcore"" and what style of play you're doing. I put about 10 hours in or so from Friday afternoon and over the weekend and have plenty to go before hitting the cap. I was going mostly through the quest line and playing in the open areas which give fewer sparks. Someone playing twice as long at that pace would hit the cap(but would have also spent 20 hours out of 72 playing just Skyforge which is...concerning). Then again, someone could potentially reach it in half the time I spent grinding nothing but spark missions with multipliers.   Point being, you can't really balance it against every type of play, and balancing it against only the most extreme cases makes the cap pointless. It is however necessary for two big reasons. One, it reduces the p2w potential (boosts have a limit to which they will provide benefit with them in place, as does converting argents to credits as your credit upgrades are called to a degree by certain sparks) The second being just keeping people from burning themselves out/killing themselves trying to grind out a progression system designed to play out over the course of a few months, in a single week. Say what you will, but if you allow players to ruin the experience for themselves in the grind for power, they absolutely will, and then blame the devs for it."

MMORPG,3d0dqw,lojician,4,Sun Jul 12 17:38:33 2015 UTC,If you actually read/listen to the quests they're really good. Of course they tend to boil down to killing/grabbing/solving something because there's not much else possible.
MMORPG,3d0dqw,c2fifield,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:21:55 2015 UTC,Well presentation matters a lot in these things. If you walk to some trigger that makes some bandits attack a town that can be interesting. If you walk to a field and bandits are wandering around aimlessly waiting to be killed less so.
MMORPG,3d0dqw,lojician,2,Sun Jul 12 19:49:03 2015 UTC,"In that sense I think you would like this. There are a good number of quests where the mobs are pretty static, but there are tons of other, more interesting ones as well. I personally like the mix they provide since I do like the mindless kill/fetch quests now and again if I'm feeling lazy or impatient, and can do real ones when I'm in the mood."

MMORPG,3d0dqw,pupunoob,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:18:47 2015 UTC,"Um they're totally different games so I wouldn't go in expecting either. Think a story better than skyrim (IMO lots of people probably disagree) with much better combat. The gameplay is definitely more mmo than elder scrolls, but you can still loot and explore a ton. I could probably help more if you explained why you liked oblivion better?"
MMORPG,3d0dqw,c2fifield,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:26:24 2015 UTC,Is it action combat or tab targeting?  Edit: I just liked deviating from the main mission mostly and just doing stupid shit.

MMORPG,3d0dqw,dominoid73,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:15:45 2015 UTC,"You can tab lock on, but it's more action based combat with no cooldowns other than ults. And yeah you can do a lot of that in it."

Rise: The Vieneo Province is truly staggering, an ""MMOSIM"" with one fully modeled planet, a ridiculous amount of economic features, and realistic travel to space, but the community was never really there from what I've seen. They tended to purge old accounts and I'd never seen more than 100 active at any one time. It seems to still be trudging along in obscurity with 48 currently active accounts. It really needed a large community to get to where it wanted to be.  Project Visitor/10six is pretty awesome. I rather liked the PvP-oriented, MMORTS-like gameplay and it's still around with a small community.  Eskil Steenberg's brilliant co-op survival game, LOVE, is still around and I rather enjoyed that one. That game is still stunning, with its painterly look, and the AI is extremely impressive.  I enjoyed Clan Lord and Arindal back in the day but man, were they a grind to level in. Took weeks to even unlock your class specialization, if I remember correctly.  There was this game called Wizards and Champions that I played quite a bit when it existed. The creator also made, I think Realm Lords(?), which was supposed to be a great PvP MMO but the community never happened. Seems he's working on a second one which could be awesome.  Also, I haven't played it extensively but it seems Auteria is still going, which is impressive."

Also, the server release, if I recall correctly, was fairly complex to set up and the guy who released it was a pain about it and didn't provide instructions. It's a bit of a miracle anyone got a new server set up. Also disappointing that he bought it but didn't apparently get the source code so there were no fixes/upgrades that could have possibly happened, sadly.  Shame Phylon didn't work out. I tested it and quite liked it at the time though it was very PvP arena focused and might have done better without the MMO-oriented parts."

MMORPG,3d34ek,bman_7,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:04:00 2015 UTC,"Nowhere Else and Beyond. It's a quite basic browser MMO, has pixel graphics, and unfortunately hasn't had many updates the last few years. It used to be slightly popular about 5 or 6 years ago, there would often be 10-20+ people on during the day, but since then the number of players has gone down, now there's usually only 2 or 3 people on at once.  I think it would have been great if it stayed popular. It has some features such as crafting your own items with an item that spawns randomly once a day, and being able to make your own island and create towns, NPCs, and quests. But hey, it's still up, there's about a thousand quests that have been made, so if you're interested just google it."
MMORPG,3d34ek,TheMantello,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:24:37 2015 UTC,"Played a game called Graal on the player-run server Unholy Nation back in 2003-ish.   What really made the game shine was how the server was completely player ran, and offered a HUGE amount of customization. The characters consisted of sprites, and anyone could make a new sprite sheet for a custom head or sword image, send it to the server admins, and have their artwork uploaded to the server and available to be shown off to everyone. You could become popular in the community by producing quality graphics and doing commissions.   The game had a scripting engine called gscript which was super easy to learn, but complex enough to produce some high-quality server systems. The level editor was also quite intuitive and available to everyone who downloaded the client. Combat was entirely skill based, which a ranking system for ""spars"", a formal duel between players.    Lastly, the server staff were actually players themselves, so a lot of the staff were teenagers. This lead to a lot of drama and some quirky stuff that you generally do not see in MMORPGs. I was friends with the head scripter of the server and he would exchange exclusive, custom made items for masking some sprites for a side project. Running around with a unique, one-of-a-kind Acid gun was pretty fun. There was always drama between the staff and usually spilled out in global chat, providing entertainment for the masses. I highly doubt you would see that in another other kind of MMO.  Sadly, the company that produced these playerworlds entered the mobile market and changed how the servers were run. Now the game has turned into a glorified chat room for preteens."

MMORPG,3d34ek,Svalaef,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:08:55 2015 UTC,"For me, it would be Blade Mistress. It was an unusual game. There were no classes, but you could spec your character to be more for fighting, crafting weapons, or making totems (items that buff you). So most people had a fighter and a crafter character. Weapons scaled based on how much ore you used. As a result, some swords were seriously massively. The whole game was made of tiles that multiple people stood on.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWT_Fb_XAsM"

MMORPG,3d21zp,DirkaSnivels,5,Mon Jul 13 02:46:01 2015 UTC,I might have actually bought into Albion if ArcheAge didn't burn me so bad. That game pretty much ruined any other games chance of me buying a founders pack ever again :(
MMORPG,3d21zp,kainsshadow,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:10:05 2015 UTC,"Well, it will be out of its 2nd alpha in about a month and most likely entering closed beta in 2 months.

I have friends who play it, but if it goes south and I don't like it, guess I'll be saying ""hi"" to Albion.   What bothers me about playing alphas and betas though is the fact there will inevitably be progression wipes, as necessary as they are. And the way Albion is set up, that could really hurt a guy like me because of my personality. I hate starting over. Even if the experience I get out of it would give me an edge in a specific trade, doing it all twice just doesn't sit well with me.  I wish you luck, I might cave and join you sometime."
MMORPG,3d21zp,DirkaSnivels,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:00:00 2015 UTC,yeah at least in AA alpha they only wiped at the end. Albion still should have a couple wipes comin. Though to be fair AA alpha there were times they should have wiped lol

MMORPG,3d21zp,Kunaixx,2,Mon Jul 13 01:52:11 2015 UTC,"Tibia PVP was... something different. These days, PVP is meaningless in most MMORPGs. It's basically ""PVP grinding"" in some way. You PVP for fun and that's pretty much it.   Tibia's PVP is really simple. The difference is that you kill people to defend yourself, your friends or your guild. PVP is personal. If someone is pissing you off, you can kill him anytime, anywhere.   Because your death is meaningful (losing items/experience, well, especially in the old days), PVP is extremely stressful at times. Guild wars are FAR from being friendly, and it creates a ""cool"" atmosphere in the server. Some people are seen as the bad guys, and some as the good guys."

MMORPG,3d21zp,Railander,4,Sun Jul 12 23:06:59 2015 UTC,"You have got to be kidding me about this 'pvp is amazing', pvp in wow is at the worst state it has ever been."
MMORPG,3d21zp,Darkperion,0,Sun Jul 12 23:18:27 2015 UTC,"im not sure how long you've pvp'd in wow, but wow pvp is definitely very good.  correct me if im wrong but i think you've been led by the opinion of the masses that played wow back in the day where the game was all about leveling and not about endgame content and now that blizzard has shifted the game's values to the former everyone who was fond of vanilla keeps talking about how the game is now focused to casuals, how easy it is, or how unbalanced it is (it is not).  this current season is shaping up to be probably the most balanced season ever, and in terms of balance it has always been getting constantly better over the expansions.  that said, the ""fun"" element has been debated a lot this expansion and i have to agree that its not as fun as TBC and Cata. the current design focuses on only doing significant damage during cooldown windows, meanwhile doing irrelevant damage outside of cooldowns, and the great majority of the playerbase finds this design boring (me included).  all taken into consideration, wow pvp is still very good and overall still the best MMO out there by a big margin."
MMORPG,3d21zp,Tomalek,5,Mon Jul 13 04:04:59 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how you can say wow pvp is very good, when the best players have quit the game over the last expansions due to pvp getting worse and worse... there is almost no competition for top ranks in pvp anymore, not like it used to be in tbc and wotlk when wow pvp was at its peak. For me wow pvp was the best a mmo has ever seen, but that's far far in the past."
MMORPG,3d21zp,Railander,2,Mon Jul 13 11:45:58 2015 UTC,"Atleast you tried to be constructive man and I honestly appreciate that. I still have to disagree though. I've been playing WoW since WOTLK and got Glad title while playing NOT FOTM composition since I always hated them. Right now it's simply IMPOSSIBLE, believe me man. They fucked up PvP so hard and made it so meaningless it's not even funny anymore like it was in Cata (remember fury?), it's just sad now. They should've hired some professional players to get their hands on balancing PvP instead of putting on their spot some random noob. My opinion :)"
MMORPG,3d21zp,Tomalek,0,Mon Jul 13 21:40:31 2015 UTC,"i have played since TBC and also got Glad in Cata and i agree to disagree.  i will say it again, while the game is reasonably balanced, it is NOT fun. balanced doesnt automatically make something fun nor compelling to play. other highly rated players also agree on that. right now the problem with pvp has nothing to do with balance and everything to do with the meta and how you are supposed to play out games. this cooldown-centric playstyle is very boring."

MMORPG,3d21zp,lazycalm2,-4,Mon Jul 13 06:08:04 2015 UTC,"i'm neither defending nor attacking. i commented that balance is good but the gameplay/meta is unfun. the pvp community collectively agrees on this, there are a LOT of voices right now giving advices on how to fix the current boring meta.  to make it clear, balance doens't automatically make a game good. rock-paper-scissors is as balanced as you can get, doesn't make it much compelling to play for more than 2 minutes."

All these features doesn't need any unique or special gameplay, is the same as WoW, more slow and more technical, relies heavily on positionals, telegraphs and juggling between GCD and off-GCD. These features aren't unique too, but allows different, more challenging and ""theatrical"" fights.

It never varies from that combination, which is ideal for people who want to watch and play their game and not watch their cooldowns.  FFXIV allows you to attain a rhythm, while in WOW a large number of the classes do not allow you to do that due to the large amount of reactionary secondary skills.  Maybe you just don't like moderately paced combat brah."
MMORPG,3d74ly,FatherPride,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:57:21 2015 UTC,"Has nothing to do with cool downs. It's just the movement and switching targets. It feels like you are meant to stand still during combat, and move occasionally."
MMORPG,3d74ly,MrNotSoNiceGuy,-7,Tue Jul 14 01:24:25 2015 UTC,"Instant cast skill have 2,5sec GCD's like every other spell lol, what you probably meant was off GCD abilities but literally EVERY SINGLE mmorpg have off GCD abilities, i hate when people say that the off GCD abilities in FFXIV offsets the slowness of the combat wich is not true at all, because all MMO's have off GCD abilities.   Everything you said after that seemed like you were saying ""i want to play a slow game, i dont like playing a fast pace reactive game"" and thats where you loose every1 reading what you said :D"

MMORPG,3d74ly,MrNotSoNiceGuy,-1,Tue Jul 14 07:54:49 2015 UTC,"Mobas is not a twitch based game what are you talking about...

MMORPG,3d74ly,lianse,2,Wed Jul 15 07:49:47 2015 UTC,"I have played both and have enjoyed both but personally think FFXIV has the slight edge over WoW and so have recommended it in the past to friends and family for this reason.  I find the combat in FFXIV somewhat slower because of the 2.5sec GCD but that is literally the only difference and it does not bother me at all, I quite like the slower pace. The graphics beat WoWs hands down, the crafting system is much more involved and fun.   The only negative for me is the PVP which is not as good as WoWs but having said that I am not much of a PVPer so I can live with that, but I would not recommend the game to someone who I know loves PVP.  It is down to personal preference really and what you like, to some it will be a good alternative to WoW but to others it would not."
MMORPG,3d74ly,Uodhn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:04:11 2015 UTC,"Don't forget also that FFXIV does have 2 different control types. ""Legacy"" is a holdover from the (really bad) 1.0 version, but ""Standard"" is your default ""WoW-Based"" movement (where the S key is a backpedal, and not a full turn around and run). Not defending the game, just most people don't realize this."

MMORPG,3d74ly,MrNotSoNiceGuy,2,Tue Jul 14 06:18:46 2015 UTC,"There's Line of Sight as leunchu mentioned, but furthermore you do not want to get hit by AoE spells and sometimes you need to kite your enemies so moving is integral provided you want to live.

Especially as a healer in arena if you are just standing still, you'll just be a target dummy.   Now of course moving in a tab-target isn't as important as in for example Quake as you mentioned or anything that requires manual targetting, but gaining ""nothing"" from moving is just.. eh o.o"

In pve there is no bad really bad classes and pvp is about skill. Watching a streamer win all his duels using starter pve gear instead of his full pvp gear proves that point and there is multiple streamers that did it.  Also, there is no need to do dailys. Doing dungeons will net enough money, there is playing the trader too or simply investing some money if u are short on time. Dailys are a small part and doing the gathering stuff takes like 10minutes a day.  Other than hta i agree on your summary, u really need to ping the poor optimization out more cuz its a real bummer for anybody not on highend current gen i7."

IMO leveling is really quick with all the XP boosts they give you as well as dungeons that there is no need to grind. It has a really fun combat system and fighting BAMs can be challenging and satisfying. Just exploring the areas without questing all day long is also enjoyable. But you will always find people trying to ""beat"" the game as soon as possible and then complain how grindy it is."

MMORPG,3d222a,giditaldrainter,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:16:21 2015 UTC,"I found questing quite fun in TERA. Maybe I'm just used to those grinding quests. It was fun exploring the map by following the quests as the quests make you explore the entire map. It could be hard to soloquest everything though as some classes die easily, such as the sorceress. The game got boring when I reached about level 50 on my sorceress because the mobs become insanely hard to kill, I swear the HP on the mobs increase exponentially with their level. There's only so much burst a sorceress can do before getting out of mana/hp. Exploring the various classes was also a fun thing to do. The skills of each class feel very satisfying to get and use. For example the fire nuke on the sorceress which you get later in the game is one of the strongest damage spell in the game so the game makes you want to level up. However, after having played the first 30 levels for 5+ times on multiple characters I got really bored of starting over. It also doesn't help that they let the Reaperer class get to level 50 for free - feels like leveling my older characters was for nothing."

While the combat is great the community is by FAR the worst i've ever experienced on an MMO. No one helps you out. I spent 4 days looking for a guild only to be ignored by everyone in general chat. EVERY single quest is also Kill X amount of Y. If you don't mind playing a single player antisocial game it's great but i like having a sense of community in the games i play."
MMORPG,3d222a,Leiloni,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:58:29 2015 UTC,"I spent 4 days looking for a guild only to be ignored by everyone in general chat.   People aren't ignoring you, it's just that this community has never done guild recruitment via general chat (generally it's frowned upon as only something bad spam guilds do). Don't expect people to do everything your way. Take some time to figure out the community and how they do things instead of being so arrogant. If you want to join a guild, you need to do the work instead of expecting people will do it for you.  In TERA you have several ways to find a guild. 1. Forums - both server specific and guild recruitment forums. 2. Guild search section of the website. 3. Guild listing in game. Each of these three things will have guild advertisements where you can read through and find one that suits you. From there you will want to apply and speak with a designated member. 4. One last way to do it is to meet people in game. Endgame TERA, most organized/skilled PvP and PvE content is done via premade groups. Often these are formed via the manual LFG system (shortcut Y I think in game?) where players form their own groups for things. These ads will also often appear in the LFG chat channel. Meeting and playing with people in this way is a great way to make friends and find new guilds, since you can play and chat with them to see if you like them before deciding to join."

MMORPG,3d3dsi,OnePunkArmy,2,Mon Jul 13 05:02:46 2015 UTC,gank = when several players attack you at once (ganged - either in PvP or Player Killings). spike = usually refers to sudden hit of massive damage (damage spike).
MMORPG,3d3dsi,Aerowalk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:11:57 2015 UTC,A gank can also refer to a player using any major advantage to defeat another player quickly.  Attacks from stealth are often referred to as ganking.  Attacking players of a low level or those who are unable to fight back is also ganking.  Attacking someone who is busy with their PvE encounter is often called ganking.
MMORPG,3d3dsi,zylli42,0,Mon Jul 13 07:30:40 2015 UTC,"Gank is a suprise attack (GANg + attacK).  Although it doesn't really mean it has to be 1v5.    Spike refers the an upward trend on a plot of damage over time graph.  We rpg players long have gotten used to using averages to compensate for RNG and time constraints.  So we talk about dps (damage per second) and DoT (damage over time) and etc.  The more variance the damage can roll is ""spikier"".  Damage that relies on critical hits (like 25% for example) will be Spike damage."
MMORPG,3d3dsi,seicar,0,Mon Jul 13 06:20:12 2015 UTC,"Spike is generally used to refer to a large burst of damage.  If you're looking at a graph of damage and you suddenly see a huge climb, it resembles a spike in the graph.  This may mean a sudden series of crits or procs.  The person who says it is up-front damage is wrong.  That's alpha damage, not spike damage."
MMORPG,3d3dsi,Moxx-yBinshner,-3,Mon Jul 13 07:47:37 2015 UTC,"actually, you guys are missing what spike is. Its a really old, i dont know, tactic? used in almost every team pvp game.  For example, you start the 5v5 pvp. You dont focus anyone, you just spread your damage/survive for a few moments, so the enemy cant focusheal/contron effictively. Leader counts from 5 to SPIKE, and on SPIKE the entire team targets one person and use their hardest hitting skill on that guy. Thats what spike is in the OP's context."
MMORPG,3d3dsi,Pewly,2,Mon Jul 13 06:52:02 2015 UTC,The OP didn't specify any context.  A spike could be referring to a PvE encounter where a boss does sudden damage to the tank.  It could also be a PvP encounter with one player who uses a series of burst-damage attacks to defeat another.

MMORPG,3d43hj,rafapisco,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:46:53 2015 UTC,"largely depends on the nature of the magic.   There would also need to be pretty compelling evidence, lore wise, as to why weapons dont' exist.   It might be fine to say that traditional weapons don't work against mages because of shields, magically enhanced armor, or auras, or w/e. but unless everyone is a mage and those magical barriers are passive and cannot be brought down for any reason, that doesn't really hold up.   it also depends on what you mean by 'magic only' does this mean there are no melee classes?   as a core concept there isn't anything wrong with it. execution is everything."
MMORPG,3d43hj,Onisake,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:12:17 2015 UTC,"When I am talking about magic only, I am talking about using magic for melee and ranged combat. My only doubt is that I think people like alot to have a weapon and see they character with them. I don't know if the lack of weapons would cut my player base in half or not"
MMORPG,3d43hj,Onisake,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:49:31 2015 UTC,"i don't know about cutting it in half. but melee magic is basically just hand-to-hand.   I think some people have greater affinity for physical classes/weapons. so i'm sure you'd lose some player base. but at the same time, focusing on magic can give you more interesting power scope.     why do you want to remove weaponry? are you also wanting to eliminate heavy armor?   from a resource standpoint, there are advantages. but in a proper MMO i'm not sure it would do well. some people like to sling spells. others like to smash things with a big axe.   but it also depends on the type of MMO you are building. is this a sandbox? is the focus more on combat or crafting? 2d or 3d? PvE focus or PvP focus?   from an obvious standpoint. yes. some people won't play the game because everything is magic. but what are your goals for a player base? what size are you thinking?   seeing as you're asking here, it implies this is an indy project with limited budget. a goal of a couple thousand is pretty realistic. but if you're fresh and new you shoudl really start smaller and not go for a project as daunting as an MMO. maybe create a few games to try out specific engines to help refine them. IE: a standalone game/app that will showcase the crafting or casting system. etc."

MMORPG,3d43hj,Onisake,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:25:09 2015 UTC,"The world doesn't have to be without weapons, just the players. NPC's and mobs can use them. When it comes to melee magic, I thought DA:I had an awesome idea with the Knight Enchanter. Creating a magical sword when he/she casts the attack skill for it. Also for more of a hand to hand type thing you could always go with the Psylocke type of attack.   It all depends on you and how you want your game to be. If you want magic only but want people to feel more melee you could make abilities like the Sorceresses from Black Desert. Have it be more just a close range magic that give the impression of melee. Sky's the limit."

MMORPG,3d43hj,Ciciro,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:58:00 2015 UTC,The idea is to restrict the player to eight skills. These skills could be DPS/TANK/BUFF/DEBUFF/HEAL etc. The idea is to let someone specialize in one of the roles or mix between them.

MMORPG,3d20pv,Ambelon,2,Sun Jul 12 21:54:39 2015 UTC,"Definitely more pvp oriented. The pve was serviceable but nothing amazing. The world was a fun one, tho, and I especially enjoyed the pvp tank mechanics and collision detection.  It had it's fair share of problems early on, and while public quests were a pretty novel idea at the time, as the game lost subs those became kind of obsolete.  I do think it could have been pretty great if it had stuck around. I don't have any first knowledge of the private server but I've heard it's decent - not a ton of players but they are working hard on it and seem to have a lot of dedication.  I'm not very hip on the warhammer lore past the obvious things, but I LOVE LOVE their version of orks and goblins, and the fun of making a black ork is totally worth the minor investment of ""nothing"" if you feel like checking out the private server just for fun if you're thinking about it.

Random world events (like FATEs in FFXIV and Orange random quests in GW2) were first done here iirc.   It was a decent game, but there was just something about it (and every other mmo post the first few years of wow) that didn't spark my interest for very long. Questing was pretty standard fare tbh, but it had the best theme park pvp id seen at that point.  If it were still running id probably not resub to it, but if you are interested in more pvp orientated games, you could try Archeage or wait for Black Desert."

The instanced PvP (or whatever it was called) was enjoyable, but nothing too creative. In the end I made it to about level 50 and quit because I learned I'd just have to grind the world pvp to gear up, and the novelty of that had long  worn off.  I kept waiting for it to go f2p because some of the instanced pvp levels were pretty fun, but they never did it. To be honest you're better off playing today's flavor of the month MMO than 2008's."

Oh and we will just ignore Bright Wizard issue that was verging on ridiculous for months and months. But they had a great guild system and the Public Quests were fairly unique at the time.

MMORPG,3d20pv,MaxSwagger,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:14:06 2015 UTC,I thought it was good. It was what they called realm vs. realm. Basically your team would take over all three zones and initiate a city take over. Problem was that the city was hard to coordinate and kind of sucked. Also it blocked out scenarios (the arena battles) which was the best part of the game. I felt like this was game where thee patches never addressed some the major issues. I never played wow but it definitely wasn't a pve focused game.  He pve content was linear and rigged to take you directly to the final level and there were only a hand full of dungeons.

Nothing of that sorts will come out anytime soon anymore. We are seeing a lot of indie MMOs of which probably 80% will die, since it's very difficult and expensive to run an MMO and those studios usually overpromis and can't deliver then.  The biggest of the upcoming would probably be Camelot Unchained since it's run by a experienced team and with Mark Jacobs someone, who delivered one phenomenal (daoc) and one mediocre game (Warhammer), but still has 100x more experience then most of the ""kickstarter projects"" out there.

MMORPG,3d1dao,dragon870,21,Mon Jul 13 07:27:52 2015 UTC,"Fuck no. I spent $200 on the game like a retard and I still can't touch the pay2winners.  I don't mind pay to advance. I've dropped several hundred on the game Warframe so I don't have to grind for whole months to get the Warframes and weapons I wanted. That doesn't mean I can go into conclave (PvP) and win. The people who spend more time in the game can easily have better stuff for both PvP and PvE.  Archage was fun until I realized I need to spend THOUSANDS on the game to stand a chance against the other people who do. What did I get for my $200 invested? Not much. More than I wanted to grind, but nowhere near enough to compete with the rich kids who spend thousands on the game.  Fuck Archeage. I play video games because I'm stuck working 60 hours a week to pay bills. I want to escape this bullshit capitalistic society where the rich have all the money and all the free time in the world. I play games to escape that. MMORPGs are great because no matter who you are in the real world, you can be just as good as the biggest heroes in the game. Not in Archeage. In Archage, if you are a millionare with plenty of free time in your real life, you can carry that over to the game.  That is retarded. I wasted $200 bucks and felt stupid. I can't imagine the poor people in worse conditions who wasted time on the game only to realize they can't compete unless they are rich in the real world. What a depressing realization. The world is unfair and it sucks to think about it. It's completely ludicrous to play an MMO where the people who are rich in the real world can excel FAR BEYOND what others can. Not only is it unfair, it also breaks the immersion. When someone destroys an entire caravan single-handedly in Archeage, nobody thinks 'Wow that guy is so awesome he must have spent a ton of time on the game!' Everyone instead thinks 'Great we got killed by some rich griefer.'   That was a very disgusting aspect of the game. Pay2win is bad enough, but it's fucking despicable when you need to spend THOUSANDS to compete.  Fuck that game and fuck the rich nobs who like it."

MMORPG,3d1dao,faern,3,Sun Jul 12 22:00:11 2015 UTC,"you can be just as good as the biggest heroes in the game.   I understood and agree with pretty much everything else you said besides this point, my main issue with games these days though is that EVERY player is a hero. GW2? Everyone is a hero, Warcraft? Everyone is a Hero. Aion, Neverwinter, Rift, Skyforge (somewhat), Starwars, Tera, Vindictus. I could go on. I honestly would love games to move from the concept that every player is the same as everyone else. Every player should not be made equal or be the same, but the people at the top should not be the people who have the deepest pockets.irl   I think that's where Archeage went well, especially in Alpha where the amount of gold you earned/had supported the cost of your land and not the hope that people buy taxes/apex from the shop so you can afford it and if not you pay 5-10$ for them or waste an entire days worth of labor to do so.  The major strong point of archeage, is that you didn't have to go around saving everyone. You could be that farmer, that blacksmith, that crafter or broker or trader. You could hire other people as mercenaries to help protect your investments.   That was a strong point of ArcheAge, but because of the greed of Trion with labor, labor potions, tax certificates, thunder trees, RNG loot boxes, it became 'who's willing to invest more into the game so I can keep playing'.    I really hope you got your refund, they offered them and many players on reddit and the forums expressed ways to get your money back besides through just Trion. I paid the 200$ + an extra 50 or so and made quite a bit of money when I sold my land off some players. I honestly made enough money from that game and earned my investment into it to help pay another semester in college.  If the game kept the housing mechanics in Alpha as well as not kept the old class builds by not messing with healing, the game would of kept being great and Trion just wasn't in it for the money, It would of been a good game."
MMORPG,3d1dao,xDialtone,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:34:25 2015 UTC,You understood me correctly. By hero I meant that - overpowered players. I agree with you about that being an issue with many MMOs these days. Look at WoW for example. Back in Vanilla WoW legendary weapons were special. People knew of the players who had these actual legendary weapons that glowed and shit.  Now everything looks fantastical and every player wields immense power. By stating that it's unfair that I couldn't also be one of these players in Archage (By comparison to pay2win players) I wasn't implying that I WANT the game to have super powerful players in the end-game.

MMORPG,3d1dao,Karegohan_and_Kameha,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:25:38 2015 UTC,"Tried playing it again the past few days after stopping a while ago, outside of the gods d/c me every ten minutes, the constant problems with popins (not a card issue) and how much more PW2 its become since its first few months I just uninstalled again.  I had a lot of fun when it was first released from building your first clipper to doing the scarecrow farm quest but its current state just makes it impossible for me."
MMORPG,3d1dao,Jindail,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:14:16 2015 UTC,was fun in alpha tho...never had this much fun in any game sailing with the guild and pvp in the ocean  sigh.
MMORPG,3d1dao,HyperST,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:44:28 2015 UTC,Piracy was so much fun in alpha. Reputation meant everything. It was an information broker's dream... Then beta changes dropped.
MMORPG,3d1dao,KadeLylath,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:03:34 2015 UTC,Starting over at level zero with a cash shop? Not a chance. I already spent too much on that game. I spent at least $600 and I'm still equipped like a carebear farmer. RNG sucks.
MMORPG,3d1dao,AmethystSC2015,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:29:08 2015 UTC,"Another server won't save the game. Because of how taxes work, the price of apex and certificates are going to be way to high this late into the game and there isn't enough population, unless every server merged into it, for it to matter at this point. If it was the old system of how taxes work as well as had a decent player base still, it would probably work. The people who move there will either be the players with multiple accounts, or people hoping to get some land and then realize they can't pay for the cost unless they waste every last drop of labor crafting certs. It's just not going to go well."
MMORPG,3d1dao,xDialtone,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:39:46 2015 UTC,no
MMORPG,3d1dao,MegaRaichu,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:34:27 2015 UTC,I might depending on how the cash shop is managed at that point. I still have most of the currencies from founder's pack and honestly AA was one of the best MMOs I'd played - and I was especially bummed when it got ruined like this.
MMORPG,3d1dao,naiets,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:49:52 2015 UTC,After the terrible experience with ArcheAge beta and an even worse experience with Trion's so called customer service I'll never touch another Trion Worlds game.
MMORPG,3d1dao,Gnarlstone,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:08:36 2015 UTC,Considering the screwups they KEEP making? No way in hell even though I've dropped close to $1000 in the short-time I was there. Never before have I been that disappointed in a game.

MMORPG,3cz0xy,j3w3ls,3,Sun Jul 12 01:56:46 2015 UTC,"It boggles my mind that anyone continues to give Derek Smart money, despite his failed attempts to produce a quality game after all these years.  While the scale and depth of the Battlecruiser series was to be commended, not one of his games has ever released in a non-buggy state. He has continuously promised features that were never fully implemented, and has promised the mysterious ""Universal Combat Online"" which became ""Galactic Command Online"" for years with nothing to show for it but screenshots and a short 30 second trailer that both look like they came from 2000.  Now here he is tearing into Star Citizen, likely because they got all of the attention and money, and after his numerous failures nobody takes him very seriously anymore. He even took the opportunity to try and market his own game, talk about how smart and great he is, and then dismiss Star Citizen's goals as unachievable in our lifetimes simply because he wasn't able to achieve any of his.  The man can't even accept criticism without bans and legal threats: https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140217/10000126251/game-dev-derek-smart-again-responds-to-negative-review-making-vague-legal-threats-banning-commenters.shtml  Yet he feels entitled to bash Star Citizen. He's a complete joke, and will continue to go down in game development history as one."
MMORPG,3cz0xy,yamamushi,3,Sun Jul 12 04:57:22 2015 UTC,"most definitely in it for the attention haha - but then I also think he has a few valid points. It's like the crazy guy on a box, yelling obscenities and incomprehensible gibberish. yeh, it's mostly noise but sometimes they have those moments of truth."
