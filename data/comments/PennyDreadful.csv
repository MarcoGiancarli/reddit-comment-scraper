PennyDreadful,3e4sex,mtempissmith,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:21:57 2015 UTC,"Obviously, it would be a very different show. the time period is very much part of the atmosphere of 'Penny Dreadful'... a somewhat similar series set in modern times would be the U.K. version of ""Being Human"", i suppose."
PennyDreadful,3e1pqm,Lysmerry,15,Tue Jul 21 07:38:51 2015 UTC,"Life as a 19th century prostitute must've been almost unimaginably difficult. Brona tells Ethan many times that she doesn't believe she has any good in her. Could her lack of empathy have existed then? Maybe, but her life is constrained by being a poor Irish woman in 19th century London, and soon enough she is simply too ill to carry on. Had she been killing Johns for some period of time before? Is this essentially broken aspect of her soul what attracted Ethan to her in the first place? Certainly it attracts him in Vanessa, so it isn't too far fetched to imagine he might've seen it in Brona as well.   Once Victor revives her, she presumably goes through the same process as John Clare and Proteus. Her memories are hidden, and gradually return to her. We notice this as her accent wavers every so often. Her tortured relationship with patriarchal English culture slowly returns as well, but now she finds herself in the position of a true outsider. She is already dead, and she knows it. Lily is now endowed with a freedom that Brona never had: she can do whatever she wants, nothing worse can happen. Her immortality is litteral but also figurative: she can't be ""killed"" because she isn't alive. There is significant foreshadowing of this realisation, in the scene where she is being ""dressed up"" by Victor, and when she meets Dorian.  She realises Victor is weak. His addiction to morphine and his essentially empathic character rule him out as a potential ally in this new reality. She attempts to recruit John Clare, because she assumes he is like her. However, he too is proven to be morally weak compared to her, unwilling to do what is necessary. Thus she finally meets Dorian, who like her is a sociopath outside of society. Unlike her, Victor or John, Dorian has the social standing and power to bring her manipulative and cruel tendencies to fruition. Her arc is at its peak. Initially abused and unable to act in society, she has transformed herself, by the power of Victor Frankenstein's revival, into a true monster capable of wholesale destruction and control over the lesser lifeforms.   All in all her journey is precisely that of the Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. An gentle, weak outsider is turned into a powerful monster, who can evoke only fear and revulsion. The book was meant to illustrate the transformative power of science, and how it can turn the natural spirit of man into something awful. Penny Dreadful choses to follow through and provide Lily (Frankenstein's creature) with a powerful new postion in society. When Mary Shelly was writing, the Romantics assumed that once something was corrupted and ugly, it would be ""natural"" for humans to attempt to destroy it. However, since the rise of fascism and soviet communism and neoconservatism (in other words, sexy self-aware totalitarian dictatorships) we have seen that the corruption of power, even drenched in blood, can still be incredible alluring. It's no coincidence that fascism has it's roots in the kind of wealthy dilletants personified by Dorian Grey.  Victor Frankenstein is still useful to Lily, and she knows he will have no other choice but to help her. After all, she only exists because Victor was coerced into helping John Clare. Victor has no more support network, all the strong people in his life having either collapsed into themselves, been killed or departed for the most distant parts of the known world. He is hopelessly addicted to morphine, on a self-destructive trajectory. His abject submission to this self-destruction is what will keep him in Lily's orbit, blaming himself for all the evil she commits as well as all the pain she endures. Victor is our own failure to stand up to the banality of evil. He is our fear of change and of the unknown, and through this fear he allows the worst in the world through.   As others have pointed out (if someone can provide sources for this, i know it's somewhere on this sub), Vanessa did not defeat the Master at the end of the season. It's possible she delayed him, but it is much more likely that she played directly into his plans. The Horsemen of the Apocalypse are here, possibly embodied by the Lily/Dorian pairing. They are true agents of evil, much more so than the Nightcomers or the vampires, because they have the power to pose as members of society.  Sorry for the wall of text, comments or replies to this theory are more than welcome."
PennyDreadful,3e1pqm,orthocanna,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:50:44 2015 UTC,fascism and soviet communism and neoconservatism   LOL
PennyDreadful,3e1pqm,cfl1,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:17:52 2015 UTC,literally speechless.
PennyDreadful,3e1pqm,orthocanna,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:31:06 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the well thought reply. A lot of great insight there. Just wondering- why do you think Victor would continue to help her? Do you think she will play with guilt and threats, like John Clare did? Because he's truly losing himself into the drugs, and at this point it seems like Victor's creations have caused him so much horror he would be apathetic to their suffering and not willing to make amends like he did with JC.   It would be interesting if she needed him and offered him something tangible- like money or drugs- and he took her up on it in his desperation."
PennyDreadful,3e1pqm,orthocanna,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your kind words. Now i'll use that to make some pretty broad leaps, but stick with it this might make sense:  Tl;Dr: Victor can't stop himself believing in the essential good of man and nature, and the merging of the two through science. Brona and Dorian will use this to their advantage, and also exploit his guilt at having created her in the first place. Plus he still sort of wants to have sex with her.  The shows main villains (aside from the Master) represent the stages of evil within human culture/history in relation to 18th, 19th and 20th century Europe. The vampires are essentially the primitive, destructive, dog-eat-dog of pre-civilisation. They form a pack, directly linked to each other. They are unsophisticated in their targets and the way that they terrorise civilians. They represent marauders, barbarians and general lawlessness.   The witches represent relgious and feudal domination. They have a rigid aristocratic power structure, that one can go up in, especially by destroying those above. It's sort of hinted that the only thing keeping the younger, more subservient witch from usurping the leader is her physical inability to destroy her and her lack of contact with the Master. Consider the plot of Macbeth or any other story of medieval intrigue. Consider also the Catholic Church or old European Monarchies, where the leader (Pope or King) were the only ones with privileged access to God.   Finally, we have Lily and Dorian. They represent the sort of fascism that arose during and just after the First World War. Fascism was an attempt to unite the forces of society under one common banner. The way this manifested was mainly through the wealthy industrial capitalist class forming an alliance with the colonial aristocracy. Dorian represents this aristocratic trend, with his great age (though he is still younger than the witches) while Lily represents the newer but equally powerful industrialists who were created thanks to the advent of technology and science. They present a beautiful, elegant side to evil and live within the traditional ""halls of power"".  Victor is the populace, transfixed by their beauty and elegance while essentially rejected from their world. For Dorian and Lilly, the powerful and the elite dance in perfect harmony, oblivious to their ultimate goals. Both Lily and Dorian make comments that are very reminiscent of the idea of the Superman, first written by Nietzche and then picked up by Hitler and the Nazis. The idea is that some poeple can make themselves invincible, conquerors of what the desire through the power of the Will applied in the world. Victor represents the romantic notion that there is good in all of us, and domination for it's own sake has no inherent good. He has virtually no will left in him, and is helpless in the face of his own creations. His only chance at repmption is to either destroy his creations or join them, and thus elevate his own soul to their level.  Or the show could take a more realistic tack, and show him dying of an overdose within a couple of years."
PennyDreadful,3e1pqm,friggengenius,2,Wed Jul 22 12:18:53 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. At the end I could only think, ""That escalated quickly"". She made some comment that indicated she had known what she was since she woke up. If that's true that means she remembers Victor smothering her and she probably puts together pretty quickly that John Clare was the reason for her current situation. She also said something about him fondling her in death so she may have been plotting something wicked ever since she woke up. I'm hoping we'll find out next season. I was also waiting for the Ethan shoe to drop all season since she managed to run into almost every other person she knew as Brona. I'm suspecting he will be put in a position next season where he has to fight her or join her. The thing I have to keep reminding myself is that although we see these characters as the heroes of the show, they're all fairly bad people."
PennyDreadful,3e1pqm,chromaticburst,2,Tue Jul 21 17:41:34 2015 UTC,"Huh? John Clare is deliberately cruel. It's the defining feature of his character. In most episodes he reminds Victor that he will always find and mind fuck him. He snapped Van Helsings neck without any remorse because he doesn't value human life (though in actuality the writers said it was to show the audience that no character was safe). There's been so much hate for emo Clare because he's a hypocrite. He's the character with the most people that have cared for him, but he isn't appreciative and he indulges in acting out. I liked the end of S2 because Brona and that evil family were a mirror of his own misanthropy and cruelty and he finally understood how shitty he was. So my vote is that it is a side effect of being resurrected. There seems to be a God that hands out souls in this universe. We don't know what is animating Frankenstein's creations."
PennyDreadful,3e1pqm,nelly676,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:52:23 2015 UTC,"i think the idea stems from the fact that she has her memory this time. When she gave a speech about that one husband/fiance (cant remember) that violent would have sex with her and then her mother would not defend her, she felt helpless. the shows reocurring theme is the monster within, this Brona is the Brona she wanted to be, the tyler durden syndrome. Brona now feels like she has a second chance to be the person she wasnt and actually take charge and do shit, her act while retaining her memory was to see how everyone around her was going to treat her, and she got infuriated because no one would tell her the truth, thus continuing to make her feel helpless."
PennyDreadful,3e0hf2,lll1l1l1llll,17,Tue Jul 21 00:34:35 2015 UTC,Pros:  Incredible Acting.  Incredible Writing.  Incredible Costume Design.  Incredible Set Design.  Incredible Musical Score.  Incredible Art Direction.  Incredible fully- realised concept.  Incredible setting and world building.  Incredible standard of characterisation.  Cons:  Some people would say the plot isn't fast paced enough as the narrative is often occupied with the incredible characterisation.  It's worth it.
PennyDreadful,3e0hf2,writersblock4,2,Tue Jul 21 00:46:38 2015 UTC,"Look no further, this nails it."
PennyDreadful,3e0hf2,2tidesaday,2,Tue Jul 21 03:41:25 2015 UTC,What he said. and no Cons. I enjoyed the hell out of it. It's an amazing series.
PennyDreadful,3e0hf2,zetzuei,2,Tue Jul 21 05:26:13 2015 UTC,"Well said. To me, there's no cons."
PennyDreadful,3e0hf2,Mcn1011,4,Tue Jul 21 19:28:35 2015 UTC,Pros:  Interesting universe  Unique takes on literary monsters  Nice visuals  Interesting gory imagery  Cons:  Overly concerned with maintaining dramatic tension  Outside of a few key climactic moments the plots move DREADFULLY slow  At the end of season 2 the mysteries to the characters origins/role in the universe is still largely unknown  Sembene is never given the development he rightly deserved  Can't overstate how often it feels like the show isn't covering any ground at all  Certain plots seem to be stuck in circular fashion  Aren't allowed to post dissenting opinions on this sub without negative karma
PennyDreadful,3e0hf2,HoldOnMagnolia,3,Tue Jul 21 14:19:53 2015 UTC,"Pros: what writersblock 4 said. Plus many likable characters battling internal demons as opposed, or in addition to, a 'big bad' which makes it stand out among standard TV fare.  I don't think I have ever seen a character like Vanessa Ives, who I consider the main character, anywhere. A woman who is tortured, sexual, religious but with a dark side would usually be portrayed as the villain, but she is kind and sympathetic. I have no problem with the pace and I love the character development even though I'm usually a sucker for plot.  Cons: I know I am alone in this but I really dislike the monsters. Not Frankenstein's monsters, but the weird CGI screeching vampires and hissing bald witches. Vanessa's bouts of madness, Sir Malcolm's guilt, Chandler's past are horror enough. I think the show almost knows they're underwhelming and tends to gloss over them to develop the characters."
PennyDreadful,3e0hf2,Lysmerry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:55:35 2015 UTC,"Well, that's true. I didn't liked the witches plot, but thankfully they weren't focused in them. Besides that, PD is perfect."
PennyDreadful,3e0hf2,Mcn1011,2,Tue Jul 21 19:32:47 2015 UTC,"Pros already covered by writersblock4.   One con I usually read is the plot not moving until the season finale episode. But doesn't mean you should skip it to the end. While Penny Dreadful falls under the ""Overcoming the Monster"", the show doesn't actively seek it and more often reacts to its environment. And I understand that this frustrates audiences who only follow the story.   On the other hand, the character study is lush and if you like the characters, you wouldn't really mind certain episodes that linger too long in unmasking them."
PennyDreadful,3e0hf2,vvyn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:41:42 2015 UTC,I'm not going to repeat what has been already said but the reason the second season plodded more than the first is the first season always has to survive business cuts before it can expand its universal territory. The first season is faster paced and exciting because the show has a lot of ground to cover as far as establishing the full basis of each character mythos.  The second season allowed the show to explore themes among the established environment and give more of a slow burning build and book feel culminating to a dramatic conclusion within the Gothic horror/romanticism context.   I think it's a really amazing show that deserves much praise for how insightful the dialogue is and how tragically flawed the characters are.
PennyDreadful,3diuuo,IdontSparkle,18,Thu Jul 16 16:59:15 2015 UTC,"Utterly nonsense. Not surprised. Every year these narrow minded people choose the same boring and mainstream shows all over again. AHS doesn't deserve all those noms IMO (I'm big fan of it, though), but last season sucked again, sadly. Finn Witrock was the only good thing about FreakShow.   Also, Lena Headey got nominated for that ""Shame"" scene, even when she used a body double....wtf. This is how it goes: popularity > quality.   Anyways...PD is too sophisticated for simpletons."
PennyDreadful,3diuuo,Mcn1011,5,Thu Jul 16 19:26:58 2015 UTC,"SHAME!  Sorry.  I love Lena Headey as Cersei and I don't blame her for using a body double. Her performance was great regardless (imo). Emilia Clarke's nomination is a joke, though. Also, the episode  “Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken”, which contained the most awful fighting scene I've seen in a long time (Sand Snakes) got nominated for best directing. Wat. I hope GoT doesn't win in any of the main categories because season 5 was so weak overall. /rant"
PennyDreadful,3diuuo,nyanni,4,Fri Jul 17 13:59:58 2015 UTC,"I believe Lena was pregnant and showing at the time. Emilia hadn't done much this season for her character even though this should've been the season she did her best acting given the source material, but yeah other than ""Hardhomme"", this last GOT season was incredibly underwhelming. I think the writers just missed the context and importance of key literary moments in ADwD.  Eva Green however has been killing it since season 1. When she seemingly conjures an enchantment I really believe she is doing so. When she is caring and empathetic I genuinely believe she cares for the person sharing the scene with her. She is fantastic and people are missing out on a great performance by her."
PennyDreadful,3diuuo,Kuze421,5,Fri Jul 17 16:36:43 2015 UTC,"When she seemingly conjures an enchantment I really believe she is doing so. When she is caring and empathetic I genuinely believe she cares for the person sharing the scene with her.   Yes, this is astounding. For a character so otherwise surreal, she makes it real. Like the possession episode in S1, I've seen plenty of horror movie possessions/exorcisms and this could have been just another one, but it wasn't. It didn't feel horror film-esque because it wasn't overacted. She had a lot of precision in her movements/expressions/vocalizations. So many other actresses would have overacted the crap out of that. This role could only have been played by Eva."
PennyDreadful,3diuuo,DucksAreMyFriends,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:35:47 2015 UTC,The episode from season 1 really should have put her on the Emmy Nomination radar. Even the last couple of episodes from the first season exemplify her acting chops by showing the haunted soul that has been tortured by demonic possession like you had previously mentioned. She just has it. It also helps that she is incredibly charming and gorgeous making her  spititual contortions and expressions that much more jarring.

The exact mechanics of how that would work haven't been revealed yet but based on the the information we got in the season finale, it seems it's not something that requires her physical body (after he gains her consent) since Lucifer only seemed to need her soul (his plan wasn't going to kick into gear until after Vanessa died, having lived her life f  with Ethan).   The prophecy of the Apocalypse revolves around three key players: The Demon (Lucifer), The Scorpion (Vanessa) and The Wolf (Ethan). Ethan's exact role hasn't been revealed yet but Hecate's pitch to him and Lyle's comments about how Lucifer seems to fear him made it sound like he's the deciding factor in the war for Earth and Heaven: he can choose to side with God and destroy Lucifer, or he can side with Lucifer and kill God. Which side he'll choose is up to him. Hecate wants to tag along for the ride because 1) she thinks she can pull him over to Lucifer's side, which she's already committed to, and 2) she wants to be a part of what she sees as the winning side in the war to reap all the benefits that would come along with it."

This is where Penny Dreadful's mythology expands on the Biblical one. Rather than having one fallen angel, there are two, who are brothers.  The first brother is Dracula or Amun-Ra. He was cast on Earth, and feeds on the Blood of humans for immortality. The vampires work for him and they kidnap Mina Harker to lure Vanessa in season 1.  The second brother is Lucifer. He was cast in Hell, and feeds on the Soul of humans for immortality. The witches work for him and they kidnap Sir Malcolm to lure Vanessa in season 2.  Either of this brothers, if they mate with the Mother-Of-Evil/Amunet/Eva Green, can become so powerful, so as to overthrow God from Heaven.  However, Amunet is protected by Lupus Dei (Wolf of God) / werewolf/ Ethan. As long as Lupus Dei is around, neither brother can get to her."

PennyDreadful,3d5b9d,jgonz85,19,Mon Jul 13 17:18:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I'm understanding you fully.  The Cutwife told Vanessa only to open the book as a last resort if her God had forsaken her. Vanessa opened it and used its power to murder that one man with his dogs.  She has been praying all her life for God to protect her and now that she opened the book and found its power, and her power along with it, she realizes that she can't count on God to protect her. She wants to stand up for herself. This was shown in her battle with Lucifer and why she makes peace with who/what she is, and that she is ready to use that power to protect herself. At least that's how I interpreted it.  The book itself was probably more of a gateway, allowing her to tap into those powers, and may or may not be a spellbook considering she knows how to speak the Verbis Diablo."

I know she has been pushed around for too long, but it didn't click as well with me.

So if he is the only one good for him because that is a lot of work.   I know the new star trek reboot movies had writers.... That were never credited for their work on the movie. They were pissed to say the least but its hard to fight against that.   I know this because I am friends with plenty of working writers. John logan wears a lot of hats for this project it seems. Creator's don't always continue writing on their own shows. So good for him....I hope next season is a bit more focused.   I always think it's personally better to be working with the guy who is not only the writer but is also producing and more because his intentions for the piece are never lost in translation. He is making exactly the piece he wants to make and nobody is redoing his work. Writer/directors are in my opinion the best kind of combination to make interesting engaging pieces.

Transcribed it myself:  In the great war for the heavenly throne we were vanquished, so God looked down on his defeated angels and found us to be evil angels, so he cast us out. He took us by our winged backs and raised us over his head, thence did he fling us from his heavenly throne and cast us down to Earth and to Hell. So we were cleaved apart, two brothers cast out to two realms. One brother to Earth and the other brother to Hell. And thus will be said in eternal enmity, my brother on Earth to feed on the blood of the living by night, and myself in Hell to feed on the souls of the dead. Both in an eternal quest for the mother of evil, who will release us from our bondage and allow one of us to reconquer heaven and topple God from his bloody throne. And so will a darkness reign on Earth in Heaven, everlasting. And so comes the Apocalypse."

PennyDreadful,3cttsx,Nannypea,5,Sat Jul 11 02:12:02 2015 UTC,"Not a biography but is written in the Bible -   http://www.gotquestions.org/Satan-fall.html  Question: ""How, why, and when did Satan fall from heaven?""  Answer: Satan’s fall from heaven is symbolically described in Isaiah 14:12-14 and Ezekiel 28:12-18. While these two passages are referring specifically to the kings of Babylon and Tyre, they also reference the spiritual power behind those kings, namely, Satan. These passages describe why Satan fell, but they do not specifically say when the fall occurred. What we do know is this: the angels were created before the earth (Job 38:4-7). Satan fell before he tempted Adam and Eve in the Garden (Genesis 3:1-14). Satan’s fall, therefore, must have occurred somewhere after the time the angels were created and before he tempted Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Whether Satan’s fall occurred a few minutes, hours, or days before he tempted Adam and Eve in the Garden, Scripture does not specifically say.  The book of Job tells us, at least at that time, Satan still had access to heaven and to the throne of God. “One day the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them. The LORD said to Satan, ’Where have you come from?’ Satan answered the LORD, ‘From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it’” (Job 1:6-7). Apparently at that time, Satan was still moving freely between heaven and earth, speaking to God directly and answering for his activities. At what point God discontinued this access is unknown.   Why did Satan fall from heaven? Satan fell because of pride. He desired to be God, not to be a servant of God. Notice the many “I will...” statements in Isaiah 14:12-15. Ezekiel 28:12-15 describes Satan as an exceedingly beautiful angel. Satan was likely the highest of all angels, the most beautiful of all of God's creations, but he was not content in his position. Instead, Satan desired to be God, to essentially “kick God off His throne” and take over the rule of the universe. Satan wanted to be God, and interestingly enough, that is what Satan tempted Adam and Eve with in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:1-5). How did Satan fall from heaven? Actually, a fall is not an accurate description. It would be far more accurate to say God cast Satan out of heaven (Isaiah 14:15; Ezekiel 28:16-17). Satan did not fall from heaven; rather, Satan was pushed out of heaven.  Recommended Resources: Angels: Elect & Evil by C. Fred Dickason and Logos Bible Software."

I can definitely see Dorian and Lilly working together in their new immortal partnership potentially as the leading ""villains"" of the next season, as I too saw the reemerging themes of the immortals coming to conquer mortals as heavily pushed by Lilly. The first reaction I got to seeing them both in white was that they had somehow taken a step in the direction of a marriage to each other, whether literally or just symbolically with their meshed perspectives. But the idea of having a slow build up to the four horsemen and an eventual apocalypse with them together as the pale horse of Pestilence sounds fantastic.

The detective who's been giving him a hard time in the last episodes of the season even went so far as to say he found out his real family name, that being Talbot.  Which if you know your wolfman lore, probably means Ethan is really Lawrence Talbot (of old monster movie Wolfman fame) or some other member of that family who's inherited the curse."

PennyDreadful,3coy8l,ittakesaredditor,2,Fri Jul 10 21:49:17 2015 UTC,"It seems like he's done his own fair share of normal brutal killing, but my bet is that someone in one of the tribes he helped exterminate was the original werewolf that bit/cursed him. My other guess would be that he ended up being used by his father afterwards as a sort of combat tactic: unleashing him on a full moon into whatever camp needed to be taken care of. I guess we'll have to wait and see how his relationship with his father is, though I imagine they want him back so bad because he's a valuable asset.  Edit: I'm also infinitely glad that they went for a more classic Wolfman take than the becomes a wolf-type werewolf. The latter just seems silly and much less imposing."
PennyDreadful,3coy8l,ProjectMayhem92,2,Fri Jul 10 21:59:01 2015 UTC,My other guess would be that he ended up being used by his father afterwards as a sort of combat tactic   I suspect it's a genetic thing and hereditary.

PennyDreadful,3cmira,ThatScotchbloke,14,Thu Jul 9 01:45:50 2015 UTC,"To me, John's scenes are the best part of the show.  His lines are so beautifully written. It reminds me of the writing in Deadwood a little. I hope he has many more scenes."
PennyDreadful,3cmira,Ch1ef_,9,Thu Jul 9 02:27:59 2015 UTC,"He's very well written. The viewership, myself included, seemed to have trouble getting a handle on him. He seems to want to be loved so much and then acts like a total monster to everyone around him (with rare exception). You can see the abused/abuser mentality in the writing. I like the character very much but I don't fully understand him."
PennyDreadful,3cmira,Gnorris,6,Thu Jul 9 06:59:10 2015 UTC,"he hasn't understood himself either. He keeps trying to insert himself, a square peg, into a round hole. Men and Women fear him, his creator abandoned him, his supposed consort ridiculed and cuckolded him. The failure of this last venture/attempt, that of a lower class working man minding his own business was the last straw...He had his no country for dead men moment.   Out there on the desolate shore without the unrelenting influx of sights and sounds that serve only as painful reminders of what he is not, what he cannot never have, he may find some measure of peace.   After all, this season was all about Knowing who/what you are   If and when he returns he will be more than a match for the manipulative Lilly. His rage against Victor might turn to apathy and if the weak willed Dr is lucky, maybe even pity."
PennyDreadful,3cmira,UrbanGimli,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:45:57 2015 UTC,Well put. Although I don't see Lilly as his foil. He wasn't wronged by her outside of some well earned mockery. He was the one that demanded her purpose be his bride.
PennyDreadful,3cmira,Gnorris,2,Thu Jul 9 21:36:21 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking that whatever else happens,  they will be eachother's undoing next season."
PennyDreadful,3cmira,joegekko,4,Fri Jul 10 03:12:39 2015 UTC,"Caliban's motivations are complex, but understandable. His characterization actually sticks pretty close in spirit to Shelley's Frankenstein:  The creation, abandoned by his creator, is an unlovely thing and utterly alone. (Back when the original book was written, physical defects were seen as moral defects, blights upon the soul as well as the face.)  He's also cursed with intelligence and an appreciation for beauty. The world that he wants nothing more than to be a part of shuns him. In turn, he grows to loathe people as much as he craves their company. The creation, the creature, steadily becomes a monster as he eventually pursues Frankenstein. He is a twisted Adam in search of an Eve, ultimately a reflection of the society that ""nurtured"" his formative years with hatred and disgust.  And he's completely, horribly aware of his monstrosity.  He tracks down Frankenstein, demanding a companion. (Interestingly, in Shelley's version, the monster demands someone as hideous as he is so he might have someone to properly mirror -- and therefore love -- him. Lily is the opposite of these things in all ways; Caliban's entitlement for his match to be beautiful and to love him has backfired spectacularly.)  Fearing what another creature on the Earth might mean, Frankenstein drags his feet and eventually destroys the monster's mate. This, in turn, leads to deadly retaliations, then an icy revenge chase at the ends of the earth.  Barring the destruction of the monster's bride and the mutual death bit at the end of the story, there are a lot of similarities.  tl;dr Caliban is what you would call a product of his environment."
PennyDreadful,3cmira,i_bite_right,3,Fri Jul 10 10:09:19 2015 UTC,"His lines are so beautifully written.   This. Seriously. His lines are so so good. And also, Ives says this to him:    Of my friend, I can only say this: of all the souls I have encountered in my travels, his was the most... human.   And how can we forget the long monologue from first season:   Of another being, looking into these eyes, upon this face, and recoiling not. But how could that happen? For the monster is not in my face, but in my soul. I once thought that if I was like other men, I would be happy and loved. The malignance has grown, you see, from the outside in. And this shattered visage merely reflects the abomination that is my heart. Oh, my creator, why Why did you not make me of steel and stone? Why did you allow me to feel? I would rather be the corpse I was than the man I am. Go ahead. Pull the trigger. It would be a blessing."
PennyDreadful,3cmira,avinassh,2,Fri Jul 10 07:10:59 2015 UTC,"I think its because I've read a lot of gothic novels and The New Prometheus that my tolerance is really low for John.    I loved Deadwood, too, but I can't bring myself to sit through the rants again for a re-watch."
PennyDreadful,3cmira,Werewomble,6,Thu Jul 9 05:10:41 2015 UTC,"He seems to be way too much of a narcissist to want to recover some kind of relationship with him. Specially if they're going by the self-centered Dr F from the book, and not form that awful DeNiro adaptation (in which she wants to conquer death after being traumatized by the death of his mother), he just really want to be as close to a god as possible. With that being said, he will need somebody with experience in killing John's own kind - one minute of silence for ""friend"" Proteus. Probably something involving Vanessa... Maybe Brona/Lilly will do something to her, since she's Dorian's 'one that got away'? I mean, John would go ape to ensure V's safety right?"
PennyDreadful,3cmira,M5Tark,3,Thu Jul 9 03:53:19 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't see the good doctor getting all lovey dovey over John anytime soon. I think it's more likely Victor will want him as an ally.
PennyDreadful,3ciso1,nelly676,22,Wed Jul 8 06:13:22 2015 UTC,The Emmys do not like genre television. The sheer popularity of GOT had forced that get acknowledged. I think it would be awesome but it's unlikely. I hope to be wrong though :-)
PennyDreadful,3ciso1,ladyhelga,6,Wed Jul 8 06:22:14 2015 UTC,"I agree 100% with you. GOT has some nominations for the acting but they are pretty rare and is not a huge contender for best drama even if nominated. And look at Orphan Black : every year everyone on the internet acknowledges Tatiana Maslany's performance but she has yet to score an Emmy nomination.  Also, Emmy awards suffer from a lot of inertia : nominations don't tend to change that much season after season (although this season Breaking Bad is gone) so newer niche shows have even more of a difficulty to score any nods."
PennyDreadful,3ciso1,Nicollass,5,Wed Jul 8 14:32:43 2015 UTC,Yes Orphan Black is the best current example. Buffy is another older one though I'm sure there's plenty.   You're are right about the inertia. Shows that have a great first season will get nominated for the rest of their run no matter the decline in quality.
PennyDreadful,3ciso1,ladyhelga,2,Wed Jul 8 15:03:08 2015 UTC,"However, Lead Actress might be the category with the more new names, or at least the one where things can change the most.  Claire Danes and Robin Wright are 99% sure to be nominated.  Michell Dockery has been nominated for 3 years now and Kerry Washington for 2. Julianna Margulies has also been nominated several times for The Good Wife. Last year the only new one was Lizzy Caplan for Masters of Sex.  This year Viola Davis is all but guaranteed a nomination for How to Get Away and Taraji P. Henson might also be nominated for Empire  Add all of the other potential candidates that might deserve a nomination : Tatiana Maslany, Elisabeth Moss (Mad Men Final Season), Keri Russell, Ruth Wilson (who won the Golden Globes) ...  That's a tough crowd."

As Alan Sepinwall said on his season one finale review: ""Mainly, though, I'll watch this strange and creepy show for however long it will allow me to enjoy Eva Green's work as Vanessa. She's extraordinary, completely grasping the tone of this work and finding a way to play a realistic character while also launching into these over-the-top fits in a way that matches the simpler stuff"". http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/season-finale-review-penny-dreadful-grand-guignol-not-without-my-daughter#Z5xYhmmYwUF1XuRf.99"

PennyDreadful,3ciso1,sageicedragonx,4,Wed Jul 8 06:50:52 2015 UTC,"I said that in another thread but last season Penny Dreadful wasn't eligible for the Emmys because the show didn't have enough episodes released before the deadline for the nominations (they had 2 instead of the 6 they needed). That is why Eva Green wasn't nominated.She wasn't forgotten or anything, she just wasn't in the ballot.    This year they are eligible for the first time and for the first season. Eva Green submitted the Séance Episode.    Timothy Dalton is eligible under Lead Actor in a Drama Series, all of the other regulars are under supporting. In my opinion, Eva Green is the only one who might be nominated (as well as a couple nominations for costumes, production etc) but the competition is really strong this year."
PennyDreadful,3ciso1,Nicollass,3,Wed Jul 8 14:28:41 2015 UTC,"After Battlestar Galactica was snubbed for acting, directing, and music, I gave up completely on the Emmy Awards.

PennyDreadful,3ciso1,CarlSpackler22,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:57:33 2015 UTC,I agree with many of the comments here on how the award shows don't acknowledge shows that are not considered to be mainstream. This show has wowed me from the first episode. Eva Greene absolutely deserves an award for her performance as Vanessa Ives. She is enthralling. I never bother with awards shows anyway I find them boring and too political. It's a shame that this is the way they work and so many great shows and actors are often missed.
PennyDreadful,3ciso1,Rubyshae,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:06:21 2015 UTC,"I think Eva Green deserves it but I don't think the show does, if that makes any sense."
PennyDreadful,3ciso1,mrelram,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:18:10 2015 UTC,"Are you aware of the politics behind these award ceremonies? I don't think the lack of an award affects anyone (actors). Look at Leonardo DiCaprio, he doesn't give a shit that he's never gotten an Oscar. Why? Because he knows an Oscar is merely recognition, but by who really? It doesn't change the fact that he's had amazing moments in acting. Eva Green's seance scene in S1E2 was the greatest scene I've ever seen in modern television, especially a supernatural show. If she doesn't get an award, it doesn't change the fact that she's easily one of the best actresses around. (Eva if you're reading this, please call me!!!)"
PennyDreadful,3ciso1,iPwNfUl,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:39:47 2015 UTC,"An Emmy would be the most prestigious by far, but Eva Green has already received a number of awards and nominations for her portrayal of Miss. Ives: Satellite Award, Critic's Choice Award, Fangoria Award, IGN Award etc.  Also, I don't know much about the ""culture"" of the Emmys, but there may also be some of the same kind of stuff you get at the Oscars where genres outside of drama are notoriously snubbed in the Best Acting and Best Picture categories. Just a theory but something similar may be at work here as well."

Kind of like this being the Avengers movie and now each individual is going to shine in their own roles (hopefully in season 3?!)"
PennyDreadful,3cf8tl,HumarThePridelord,3,Tue Jul 7 16:36:20 2015 UTC,"Good thoughts! I totally agree with your assessment. Many complained that the season moved slowly, but I reveled in the slow reveals and looking for clues. The slow burn and delayed gratification is exactly what makes it one of the best shows on television."
PennyDreadful,3cf8tl,unephemeral,2,Tue Jul 7 18:35:50 2015 UTC,I'm personally most interested in Ethan's journey and newcomer Hecate.   I think its pretty obvious Hecate will be making her way to America and will play a big role in Ethan's journey and eventual escape from his father's clutches.   I'm really happy they didn't kill of Hecate. Sarah Greene's portrayal of her is just so subtly otherworldly. It's fantastic.
PennyDreadful,3cf8tl,ZeroTheCat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:24:23 2015 UTC,"I think you are on point with the theme, punctuated by each character having more than one name. Which one is real? My feeling is that season three needs to have them reconcile who each of these names represent to them. For example, ,""Ethan"", the creation made in London, needs to make peace with his American-self and his Id-nature (touching on that metaphorical theme you mentioned).    Television today has hit a cultural high point, imo. Hannibal is visually stunning. Game of Thrones is it's own perfection. American Horror Story has become increasingly character driven with each season. Penny Dreadful fills it's own place and with Senebe's death, I would argue it's the sweet spot between those three shows as now we know main characters can die.     With character interactions like those between Mr. Clair and Vanessa, powerful performances like Bronna/Lily's, and crisp writing and visuals Penny Dreadful is my favorite show now.    I really want to know what method of storytelling they're going to use in season three. Dracula was written as a collection of papers haphazardly gathered and assembled (by Mina). I expect something along those lines to unify characters on three different continents."
PennyDreadful,3cf8tl,cteavin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:29:30 2015 UTC,"Your remark about it not being a plot driven show is interesting; however, if it weren't plot driven why build up to a storyline conclusion at the end of each season. Each seasons endings seems to quick or did the build up just take too long? I think not on the latter. The writing is inconsistent. Vanessa may be the focal point but her dialogue is inconsistent. John Clare's dialogue is much more developed."
PennyDreadful,3cf8tl,renosr,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:39:21 2015 UTC,"They all ""know who they are"". Now, we get to see how they cope with that. I'm excited to see what that will bring.   I think the next season will be about ""walking alone"". Malcolm is alone, having lost his family, girlfriend and butler. Vanessa, having rejected both Dracula and Lucifer but accepting Evil, will also walk alone. Hecate has ""moved out"" of the coven and is alone. Frankestine too."

Lilly and Dorian were so wicked, but they talked all nonchalant. I think that is why I loved this scene so much. It was so casual for Lilly and Dorian.

PennyDreadful,3ce4ba,DucksAreMyFriends,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:46:56 2015 UTC,"I think she's an exotic and a mystery to him. I think his interaction with Brona and Angelique showed that he had a taste for tragedy in romance. But since I really don't like him, it's not enough to make me care.    Honestly I thought the way he handled Angelique was more than amoral and that it made him seem more evil than anything. Then he's pretty much just evil at the end of the season. Both neutral Dorian and evil Dorian are boring to me though. I think the witches had more character than Dorian, yet now I'm stuck with him."

His significance in relation to Victor is quite profound, I think.   The reason Caliban (I still prefer to call him that) is interesting is because he is always seeking someone who understands him, someone whose own pain cements a kinship with him. Vanessa is one person who meets the requirements, but she also has a deep kinship with Caliban's own creator for this very same reason, and should Caliban reach out to Victor, he would find the similar creature he has been searching for... which unknown to him is the only thing Victor seeks as well. Caliban is Victor Frankenstein, in a sense. I love the hell out of that. Neither want to face the other because it would mean facing themselves. Which is one of the major themes of this season, if not the whole show."
PennyDreadful,3ce4ba,DucksAreMyFriends,7,Mon Jul 13 20:54:55 2015 UTC,The half faced guy (skinner?) was really well written and acted. Very menacing. Also the Lord that was killed by his dogs. Such a posh turd. His death made me smile.
PennyDreadful,3ce4ba,kill_monkey,2,Tue Jul 7 12:49:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah the guy killed by the dogs, as soon as I saw his face I was like, ""This asshole needs to die."" lol  It was very well done."
PennyDreadful,3ce4ba,AppleAtrocity,4,Tue Jul 7 18:32:34 2015 UTC,"I cannot stand Dorian. He's so selfish and definitely ammoral. Unlike Lily though, he's more boring evil than anything else. Also the actor portraying him looks too much like a little boy to me."
PennyDreadful,3ce4ba,msolaris,9,Tue Jul 7 09:38:40 2015 UTC,"Which makes him perfect, in my opinion.  Dorian the literary character is supposed to be 100% amoral for most of his story, he has lived a VERY long life, is 99% certain that it will continue for much longer, and as such has no fear of consequences, so he does whatever he wants, and damn the rest.  He is also supposed to look incredibly young, because that is when he was frozen."
PennyDreadful,3ce4ba,Cer0_Grav,6,Tue Jul 7 14:46:44 2015 UTC,"The Putneys were just awful. They helped turn the tide completely in my feelings about John Clare (well, that and his relationship with Vanessa)  I know there's a lot of hate for Dorian, but I think that the character is absolutely being played to perfection given what he is now known to represent in the storyline. I liked him less, ironically, when he semeed to care at least a little (first season, mostly). I'm actually really interested in where John Logan takes him in light of the fact that he seems so amoral and awful and emotionless, yet clearly his partner Lily has a lot of deep and awful and terrifying emotions. If written well, it should be fascinating to see two evil immortal psychopaths with completely different emotional compositions and pasts try to make a partnership work."
PennyDreadful,3ce4ba,unephemeral,4,Tue Jul 7 18:43:09 2015 UTC,Lily is pretty bad.   Lavinina can suck a fart out of her dead fathers ass.   Dorian is also so painfully vain and immoral I can't wait for someone to drive a knife through his portrait.
PennyDreadful,3ce4ba,ZeroTheCat,5,Wed Jul 8 00:25:56 2015 UTC,"I think John Clare was about to take the Putney's offer when Mr. Putney suggested he's be a father figure to any new freaks, but when Mrs. Putney chimed in you'll be ""King of the Freaks"" Clare snapped with rage killed them both. Mrs. Putney was a cheap detestable woman. Mr. Putney was portrayed well and was likable in his own way. Their daughter played on Clare's weakness and need for romantic love and betrayed his kindness for her. They deserved what they got though."
PennyDreadful,3ce4ba,renosr,3,Wed Jul 8 00:36:52 2015 UTC,I don't think he would have accepted their offer. There's no way he'd subject himself to the abuse and mockery of being in a freak show after all he's suffered already. I have to wonder though if he always knew he could break those bars?
PennyDreadful,3ce4ba,ThatScotchbloke,3,Thu Jul 9 01:54:42 2015 UTC,Gotta go with Dorian on this one after the way his relationship with Angelique played out. Lavinia Putney would have to be a close second.

PennyDreadful,3ce4ba,i_bite_right,5,Fri Jul 10 10:15:31 2015 UTC,"Not a fan of Dorian, he seems to me to be an extraneous character. Brona/Lily is my hate-dar too. I've never been a fan of Billie Piper and her horrendous Irish accent was like nails on a chalkboard to me, and her horrendous posh, ""daaaaahling.."" type accent is equally grating."
PennyDreadful,3ce4ba,Malevolencea,2,Tue Jul 7 21:43:43 2015 UTC,"Lily. She oozes to much hatred and cruelty. She's been acting like a sweet kid for so long and now the charade's over she's throwing everything back in Victor and Johns face. She's like a high school girl that pretends to be your friend only to share all your embarrassing conversations with everyone in the class. In the same vein of thought, the Putneys daughter is almost as detestable. This is made even worse given that all John wanted from her was friendship. The Putneys are indeed rotten bastards though."
PennyDreadful,3ce4ba,ThatScotchbloke,2,Thu Jul 9 01:50:15 2015 UTC,"Every character is portrayed so beautifully to the extent that no matter how despicable they are meant to be, it would be near impossible to detest them. However, if you threatened to tie me up and force me to watch ""50 Shades of Grey"" on repeat, I would immediately yell out Dorian Gray, no pun intended. The moment he murdered Angelique... It was completely unnecessary. It was based on his assumption that she would not be able to accept him and that his secret would be revealed. He is nothing but a manipulative bastard. And kinky, never forget kinky."

There's so much to unpack in that narrative: the subtextual incest, the possibly cursed family, the creepy and sentient location ... I'd like to imagine that Madeline would be much more interesting in Logan's version too.  (I may or may not be working on a fan fiction involving their incorporation into this universe. Ahem.)  And if Edgar's not to taste, Hawthorne might be. I'm fond of the short story ""Rappaccini's Daughter,"" mostly because it's such a wild premise.

In other words, the characters didn't know what Mrs. Poole had over Lyle, so he told Frankenstein to keep his Jewishness a secret, something not uncommon at the time, to make it look like that was what Poole had over him in order to keep his homosexuality hidden -- though I think it's clearly an open secret."
PennyDreadful,3ce3ce,cteavin,2,Tue Jul 7 21:34:14 2015 UTC,"I think the blackmailing was mentioned in episode 2?

I have a folder with quotes and i think 1/3 of them are from PD haha.   Scientifically speaking, life's nothing but a series of chemical reactions.

While it is arguable he is a monster, he is easily the most realistic character on the show. I would not blame him for his actions. He was created to be a monster. It takes great courage and determination to work towards having the sense of humanity within him. He probably did not kill her as he knew deep inside, she has a good heart. She's just acting out her parent's wishes. After all, they did take care of her despite her disability. Who else would hold on to such a burden? (Keep in mind the time period)"
PennyDreadful,3ce5jw,iPwNfUl,13,Tue Jul 7 06:04:00 2015 UTC,I thought he left her alive satisfied that her life was about to become very terrible once she realized her parents were dead and she is going to be a blind girl with no caretakers.  I thought if he might verbally confront her though to explain how ugly she was to him or such.
PennyDreadful,3ce5jw,zeCrazyEye,9,Tue Jul 7 07:17:46 2015 UTC,"That was my takeaway from the scene as well.   Between her and the parents, I'd even go so far as to say that she was the worst. Whereas the parents were always standoffish, she feigned kindness and compassion just so she could see him suffer for her own amusment. Can you imagine the life of a blind girl with no one to care for her walking the streets of London in 19th century? Her living is a fate worse than death."
PennyDreadful,3ce5jw,Aggar,5,Tue Jul 7 09:49:21 2015 UTC,"I felt that by the time Lavinia showed up, he had fully realized the monstrosity of what he had done and he was kind of shocked by it. He chose not to kill her when he could have because he doesn't want to be a monster. To me, it had more to do with himself than with Lavinia."
PennyDreadful,3ce5jw,Lucidize,3,Thu Jul 9 11:49:36 2015 UTC,"I also think he pitied her, saw that she was as much a prisoner in the world as he was. JC sees the world poetically, he knew full well what would become of her and the justice in that.    I think we saw his humanity when he let her live. Arguably, he killed her parents to prevent them from filling those cages. She couldn't do that if she wanted to. She was harmless but corrupted."

PennyDreadful,3ce5jw,Lysmerry,2,Sun Jul 19 10:04:25 2015 UTC,"Caliban is monstrous, but I don't think he's depraved in his monstrosity. He doesn't seem to enjoy it. Killing Lavinia was a possibility but I don't think he would've raped her. That's ... that's a bit far, even in light of his assault toward the actress in S1.  I've always seen him as one of the most fascinating characters because he's continually grasping for a world that denies him any inclusion within it. He's a contradiction: he loves the world and he hates it, he has a capacity for good and a great propensity for evil, he admires beauty but can only be ugly.  One of the most touching, terrible lines he had was when he said that Pandora's box should hold a mirror. All the ills of the world are in Man, he seems to say there, look no further. And he should know -- the world and the people in it made him what he is.  In light of all that, it was a total surprise that he didn't kill Lavinia after she trapped him. Maybe it will be a turning point for him."
PennyDreadful,3ce5jw,i_bite_right,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:26:22 2015 UTC,"I think him not killing her was a very conscious choice. It showed that he had gained more control over himself and his urges, and though she had betrayed him, and was mocking him, he had the decency to walk away. I don't think he's the raping type either- he wants to be accepted for what he is. He kissed that actress earlier in the show for the same reason he put on the crazy makeup to impress her- he thought that was how it was done. But he quickly backed away, horrified, when he started to attack her."

PennyDreadful,3cdshc,DrPantaleon,2,Tue Jul 7 11:57:48 2015 UTC,"agreed. although by 1891/2 there would have been many other revolvers, the key is the fact that he has to cock the hammer back before each shot. In single action revolvers the trigger only releases the hammer and pulling the hammer back revolves the cylinder. In double action revolvers the trigger pull after the initial shot cocks the hammer back as well. It is also very appropriate for a shooter in a Wild West show due to the weapons historical importance, even though it's not that old a model.  In the classic westerns the fanning of the hammer to fire more shots quickly is widely seen but only really effective in single action revolvers. You can see this in the classic spaghetti westerns featuring Clint Eastwood."

It was designed for the U.S. government service revolver trials of 1872 by Colt's Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company – today's Colt's Manufacturing Company – and was adopted as the standard military service revolver until 1892.  The Colt SAA has been offered in over 30 different calibers and various barrel lengths. Its overall appearance has remained consistent since 1873. Colt has discontinued its production twice, but brought it back due to popular demand. The revolver was popular with ranchers, lawmen, and outlaws alike, but as of the early 21st century, models are mostly bought by collectors and re-enactors. Its design has influenced the production of numerous other models from other companies.  The Colt SAA revolver is a famous piece of Americana, known as ""The Gun That Won the West"".

PennyDreadful,3ccwry,bionix90,2,Mon Jul 6 22:52:54 2015 UTC,"I disagree about John Clare. His murder of Prometheus and Dr. Von Helsing in Season 1 and his repeated threats to Victor show that he's not pure of heart but a selfish creature at best. True his love of poetry, intermittent remorse, and conversations with Victoria were very well acted (Rory Kinnear might be the most theatrical of all the cast). Victoria's comment about his humanity I think is the most accurate. He has shown the widest range of human emotions (again H/T to Rory Kinnear)."
PennyDreadful,3ccwry,renosr,6,Mon Jul 6 23:36:13 2015 UTC,"I think to piggy back off of this, then what if OP changed the last bullet point to:  JC is the most human inside, showing the widest range of emotions, while DG is the most dead inside, lacking any kind of emotions?  I think that fits perfectly. DG is this amoral, soulless man with JC is just a constant emotion rollercoaster."
PennyDreadful,3ccwry,ThyFemaleDothDeclare,2,Tue Jul 7 02:32:11 2015 UTC,I think that describes it pretty well. The Creature seems to be haunted by his actions while Dorian seems indifferent to his crimes.
PennyDreadful,3ccwry,DrPantaleon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:00:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think the only time Dorian seems to have shown any emotion at all was in his confession to Angelique when they met that Vanessa broke his heart, ""such as it is"". John Clare/Caliban feels almost too much. He's transitioned from being so self-centered to caring for others, especially Vanessa."
PennyDreadful,3ccwry,unephemeral,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:38:43 2015 UTC,Is JC caring for Vanessa romantic in nature or platonic as it were? Has he changed since his and Lily's coupling?
PennyDreadful,3ccwry,renosr,2,Tue Jul 7 23:21:35 2015 UTC,"I think platonic, but that's just my take on the characters. I think that despite Victor's abandonment, he's taken on Victor's compassion, which exists despite how horrible he can be. I don't think he's in love with Vanessa or she with him, I think it's just an extension of the tenderness that exists within her and within Victor when he's not being awful."
PennyDreadful,3ccwry,unephemeral,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:36:05 2015 UTC,"John Clare retains a capacity for goodness, Dorian Grey has lived so long that he's essentially amoral.  Edit: meant to reply to /u/ThyFemaleDothDeclare"

PennyDreadful,3ca2dl,DucksAreMyFriends,3,Mon Jul 6 08:23:38 2015 UTC,"That whole sequence showed the kind of happy life that Vanessa once envisioned for herself, what a part of her would still love to have, so it's not surprising that it included a smiling photo of her and Ethan on their wedding day."
PennyDreadful,3ca2dl,bicoolano,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:57:37 2015 UTC,"No, I think what the original comment was referring to was that people in that time period didn't smile in photos. No matter how happy they were.   Honestly though, the way it's framed it seems more like a candid or cut from a larger wedding party photo so I personally found no fault with it."

PennyDreadful,3ca2dl,Indigocell,2,Mon Jul 6 21:26:12 2015 UTC,It was probably in the background during the experience of having a happy family that the fallen angel (would we just say Lucifer) was luring Vanessa with.
PennyDreadful,3ca2dl,Canadian_in_Canada,2,Tue Jul 7 00:26:01 2015 UTC,"I didn't remember they showed that picture in Vanessa's dream sequence. Actually, I saw it on that Behind-the-Scenes video they uploaded on YouTube few hours ago."

PennyDreadful,3cbppz,sageicedragonx,4,Mon Jul 6 22:41:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it would be interesting if we perhaps got the intervention of an Archangel or something to help renew Vanessa's faith for that impeding battle with Hecate and Lucifer."
PennyDreadful,3cbppz,ddddamn,3,Mon Jul 6 23:16:52 2015 UTC,"It would be too stupid for the creators to kill him so early. He is the prince of darkness after all. I personally don't believe she will ever kill Lucifer even at the end, but perhaps banish him to the hell he came from never to make contact with the earth to influence it again. Either that or God rolls down his window and shoots him in the face. I just don't think a mere mortal, no matter how powerful has the power  of eliminating some one like Lucifer. They are saving him for the end for sure..Dracula should be contended with soon I hope. He is the asshole who put us on this journey in the first place. Time to buck up Dracula.... The penny dreadful team of monsters and men are after you. Just as soon as victor stops being a drug addict and everyone comes back from their holiday in all the other countries."
PennyDreadful,3cbppz,iPwNfUl,3,Tue Jul 7 06:00:30 2015 UTC,To be honest that whole battle made me question if the demon the witches were serving was in fact really Lucifer. It seemed like a demon vs. another demon or other higher being (Vanessa) and the demon was tricking Vanessa into thinking they were both something they weren't.
PennyDreadful,3caoc2,NDIrishB13,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:40:10 2015 UTC,"Plus, it keeps with the show's theme of only ever really hearing Satan through some form of Vanessa.   I didn't notice that.  Interesting..."
PennyDreadful,3cabnu,Jhnexus,17,Mon Jul 6 09:57:06 2015 UTC,"Well, looking back at Egyptian mythology Amunet is the partner of Amun, but she is also Neith, the Mother of the Gods, including Amun, and the primordial creator of them all.  In the end she's the one who sits in judgement on all the Gods and who decides their ultimate fate. As Amunet she is Amun's consort but as Neith she is a lot more than that and he bows to her. She's also sounding a lot like Lilith, the wife of Lucifer at times. They keep using the Amunet name but I really think they are setting her up to be more like Lilith, and by Lilith I don't just mean Adam's defiant 1st wife. I mean as in Lilitu, the mother of all demons which is what Lilith was originally. The whole Adam's First Wife/ Bride of Lucifer thing actually comes later. In a lot of the original tales she simply spawns the demonic world herself..."
PennyDreadful,3cabnu,mtempissmith,4,Mon Jul 6 11:12:29 2015 UTC,"While I don't know enough about Egyptian mythology to dispute what you're saying about Neith, I’m not really sure about Vanessa being set up to be Lilith, I mean she may very well be but I kinda want to offer some points. (Just a disclaimer: Jewish mysticism and apocrypha in general is a pretty complicated thing) To add to what you're saying, though I don’t think there are any references to Lilith being Lucifer’s wife, she did end up marrying and having demonic kids with the Archangel Samael who may have been the serpent in the Garden of Eden and also the devil (still a loyal angel of God though) and the show may have conflated Lucifer and Samael/the Devil as in most media. However, Lilith as the mother of all demons (and even the marriage between Lilith and Samuel) came about centuries after the story with Adam during the Middle Ages. All uses of Lilith/lilitu/lilit before the story with Adam (or before any of the Abrahamic religions) only referred to generic female demons or filthy animals. I just don’t see any connections between Vanessa with Lilith yet. The closest thing I can think of and this is really stretching it is that Lilith supposedly had a thing against children and babies and Vanessa aided in abortion but that is an incredible stretch and I personally wouldn't read anything into that..."
PennyDreadful,3cabnu,mr_tobacco_user,3,Mon Jul 6 12:59:53 2015 UTC,"Which makes  me wonder, as you brought up Jewish mysticism..it was revealed that Mr. Lyle is Jewish. Possibly important? Idunno!"
PennyDreadful,3cabnu,Malevolencea,3,Tue Jul 7 22:01:57 2015 UTC,"The whole scorpion thing brings to mind Serket but I don't know if the whole ""Amunet"" thing is there just to distract us from the truth."
PennyDreadful,3cabnu,ddddamn,5,Tue Jul 7 14:41:04 2015 UTC,"The big theme this season has been the empowerment of women. Look at the Nightcomers, Evelyn, Brona, and even Vanessa.  This was Vanessa tossing aside the idea of being the bride of Lucifer, subservient while he rules. This was her saying that SHE was in control, and she rejected his vision. She's embraced who she is (Amunet), and wants to chart her own path. She has no fucking clue what that path is, but she knows it is for her to decide."

PennyDreadful,3cabnu,NinjaPixies,2,Mon Jul 6 19:28:27 2015 UTC,"She's the mother of evil. While in the prophecies she's a prize to be won by one of the brothers, Vanessa has decided she's powerful in her own right."

Gives me hope that he might do something heroic before he dies.  I know a lot of people here seem to hate him for being whiny and waxing poetic all the time. I can't help but like him."
PennyDreadful,3c9iqg,Indigocell,3,Mon Jul 6 21:33:50 2015 UTC,"After two years I am finally adding another famous literary character   Betting right now that will finally be the introduction of Dracula. I'm guessing he might also be central to the plot of what brings them all back together, if it doesn't end up being the Dorian and Brona story line."
PennyDreadful,3c9iqg,yer1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:39:50 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  I was thinking he had made a brief appearance in season one, but as someone pointed out in the season finale thread, those were just his minions.  I'm very much looking forward to this."

Looking forward to season 3, seems like will sets up individual stories...hmm...new literary character? Will be Dracula? Though he isn't new, it would be nice to see him properly introduced. Jonathan Harker? Jekyll and Mr. Hyde? Gosh, gonna will be a loooong wait. Hope it stays sharp."
PennyDreadful,3c9iqg,cteavin,2,Mon Jul 6 15:16:16 2015 UTC,"Dracula has already been indirectly introduced, so I'm hoping it's not him.    We saw a mummy in Mrs. Pools doll collection, you think they might go that route? If they're using an existing character, I'm going with the inspector as Dr Jekel and Mr. Hyde. If they're introducing a new actor, it might be the Phantom but I think it more likely that they pick someone from Edgar Allen Poe, or -- God help us -- Lovecraft.    I hope they don't make it a vampire. If they do, at least go with someone classic like Camilla."
PennyDreadful,3c9iqg,renosr,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:09:27 2015 UTC,"I found the duel between Vanessa and Lucifer to be under written. That story lines' ending was too simplistic and solve too quickly, as much of Vanessa's storyline seems. However, I sill have hopes for the show I wish Eva Green was allowed to stretch more as an actress. Except when she was possessed (great acting on Eva's part) her character still seems to repressed like the Victorian age.  Eva Green, Rory Kinnear, and Billie Piper's performances were all excellent this season."
PennyDreadful,3c9iqg,PTgoBoom1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:50:18 2015 UTC,"While I also understand why some would hate John Clair, I like him a lot. Way back in the middle-ages, when I was in college, we likened the Creature to mankind after the fall: abandoned, lonely & dearly missing the peace & beauty of living in the ""Creator's"" love.  Yet, he is freakishly strong & destroys shit--sometimes without meaning to. His love of poetry makes sense: poetry is a boiled down version of human emotion & thought and, in a way, so is he.   Vanessa totally gets his yearning for ""light"" because she is the ultimate outsider & is also yearning to ""live in the light"", so to speak. I love, love this show. I have never thought so much, nor had such interesting conversations with strangers about a TV show ever before!   Also, RIP Sembene: WTF??!! Broke my heart. Will he be back? I'm kind of torn between wanting him back and not wanting him resurrected in some cheesy, overly contrived manner.   *sigh. 'Til next year. :)"
PennyDreadful,3c9xd1,Inkshooter,14,Mon Jul 6 06:27:52 2015 UTC,"If that is what the writers want then I understand it and support the decision, even though it would make me sad.    The most important thing for next season though, is that the next time we see Sir Malcolm, weary after his long journey is that he's regrown his beard."

PennyDreadful,3c9xd1,Khancer,5,Tue Jul 7 05:00:47 2015 UTC,"Who says they stay in London? What if Vanessa and Victor go to America? Next season honestly has no bounds. They can take the characters wherever they want. I'm down to just ride it out and not worry about it.  I have complete faith in John Logan to write an incredible and impeccable story that will show me the world in a whole new light as he has done the past two seasons. I can honestly say that my favorite tv show is Penny Dreadful. Watching his show every episode is like a spiritual awakening. Every time I watch an episode, I recognize these beautiful themes of humanity that make me marvel at this piece of art that he has created. I have even found answers that I couldn't find in my own life that he has answered. This man has literally changed my life and how I view it. He truly inspires me.  The series won't be over next season. Nine episodes is enough for John to tell his story. Season 4 may be 12 episodes, it just depends on how long the story is. Who knows? Maybe all next season the characters would be separated, fleshing them out more only to be reunited at the end. You say that that would be bad television, (and even though I absolutely love when the team is together, and have never seen a tv show where I liked any team apart) who is to say John Logan can't do it right. Everyone needs to confront their demons on this show. For Ethan, it is his shit in America. For Malcolm, it is his dead family and now righting some wrongs. For the Creature, it has been about being human and being accepted by the world for his uniqueness. For Victor, it is his guilt he feels for creating monsters. For Vanessa, it has been about accepting her darkness and the duality of her nature (which she has this season).   I have faith John will give us a good story no matter where the characters are. So, I'm not gonna worry about the season until season 3 actually roles around."
PennyDreadful,3c9xd1,NinjaPixies,5,Mon Jul 6 07:03:29 2015 UTC,"I can't see it ending next season. There's way too many possibilities. We've yet to see the other fallen angel (probably Dracula), Dorian and Lily could take up a good chunk of time, Hecate's still out there. The show could go anywhere from here. I can't wait for next year. I'm honestly more eager for it than Game of Thrones (which I feel has lost some of it's magic it had at the start.) or the Walking Dead. I can't see how the Creature would come back. Why would he? How would anyone reach him? I hope he does. Maybe the loneliness will prove to much for him but even then I don't see why he'd go back to London. He will return at some point though. He has to. He's just gone through a major arc. He killed the Putneys but spared their helpless daughter and was horrified with his own actions. He's clearly got a conscience and his interactions with Vanessa has shown him people are capable of accepting him. But the only way he's coming back to London is by his own accord."
PennyDreadful,3c9xd1,ThatScotchbloke,2,Mon Jul 6 13:28:51 2015 UTC,"I think we're going to get a huge flash forward and spend some time with those characters isolated. The real question is what will unite them: I predict Hecate will bring our Wold to Vanessa -- and maybe even Dracula.   I think time on the ice will lead Mr. Clair back to London to either seek his creator or combat his bride.     I wonder if they are going to start the new season off with these characters already together and we learn about their recent past through flashbacks, or if they will correspond through letters. It would be in keeping with the original novel for Dracula if they did."
PennyDreadful,3c9xd1,cteavin,2,Mon Jul 6 16:17:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think this series is anywhere near its end, as long as showtime keeps giving it the green light. It isn't clear where we'll go from here, but that doesn't mean it's at its end, that's just good storytelling.   Your predictions for the third season are sound, but do not forget that this show is quite incredible at surprising its viewers. The Lily plot line this season was out of my grasp as far as predictability goes. John Logan seems not to write the show as it goes along, but he seems to have an outlined vision for the whole of the story, which sets him apart from other writers, and the less clear it is what he has up his sleeve the more incredible a job he's doing keeping us guessing."
PennyDreadful,3c9xd1,DucksAreMyFriends,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:30:48 2015 UTC,"I agree we are probably far from the end.  Showtime is notorious for keeping shows around for many seasons, sometimes even after the best seasons are clearly behind them (See Dexter, Californication, maybe also Shameless).  I want at least a couple more seasons of Penny Dreadful but I hope they don't run out of ideas and then just keep making episodes, as can easily happen. Knocks on wood"
PennyDreadful,3c9xd1,GreenMtnStateOfMind,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:17:23 2015 UTC,"I can't see this being less than 4 seasons due to how much story they need to cover and how many baddies they introduced. I see this going up to 5-6 seasons, but no more than 7 due to not wanting to drag the audience out in that manner. there are only so many things you can do before it starts looking like The Originals."
PennyDreadful,3c9xd1,sageicedragonx,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:23:11 2015 UTC,The 9 episodes might include a 2 hour episode.    I think this season will change the main setting  to an Island from another famous gothic story.
PennyDreadful,3c9xd1,Kelpszoid,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:00:14 2015 UTC,"Dr. Moreau's?  I don't think so.  The country is already represented by the Creature - with his backward-looking interest in the Romantics and his name, borrowed from a ""peasant poet"" whose reputation had faded by then.  The contrast is with the technological futurism of the city.  I mean, we could see Dr. Moreau and some of his creations, but I don't think the show will move its thematic center to there."
PennyDreadful,3c9xd1,cfl1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:37:07 2015 UTC,We shall see.    That boat that mr. Clair was on sure looked inspired by the woodblock prints of the Rime of the Ancient Mariner. He also looks like Marlon Brando in that Moreau version.  The show creator mentioned Dr. Moreau.
PennyDreadful,3c9xd1,Kelpszoid,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:02:49 2015 UTC,"The Egyptian mystery-babble might be just a part of setting the stage for the missing, great pulp fiction monster: the mummy. Think about it for a while. We have Dracula in the shadows somewhere, the werewolf and Frankensteins monster, even a bunch of witches. What monstrosity which fits the penny dreadful/pulp-theme could they possibly throw at us?   Mr Lyle sure needs something to cheer him up and become his crowd pleasing, purring self in the next episode. And what could cheer up Mr Lyle more than an exotic new egyptian mummy to exhibit at the museum?  Plus, with the mummy as the main monster of the next season, the (middle eastern) religious plot theme can be explored more in depth. And the role of Satan/Dracula could be widened.  Edit: Mr Clare was seen on a ship in the Arctic. The monster and his creator ended their days up there among the snow if I remember the book correctly (?). So it's possible that both Mr Clare and Victor will disappear in season 3."

Lucifer wants Vanessa to complete the prophecy from Season 1. If Lucier/Amun and Vanessa/Amunet reunite completely, the world is blanketed in Darkness for him to remake has he sees fit. He doesn't want to torment her, he just wants her."
PennyDreadful,3c9jp9,McCStacks,6,Mon Jul 6 03:54:34 2015 UTC,It may be Dracula...but I am a fan of Mr. Hyde. IMHO Mr. Hyde has never been done correctly in fiction. He is usually portrayed as some type of monster. He is actually Dwarfish and looks younger than Jekyl. I hope the series plays up that fact if they use him.
PennyDreadful,3c9jp9,Pksoze,2,Mon Jul 6 04:12:09 2015 UTC,"Definitely not Dracula. The character, although never seen, has been referenced heavily since Season 1."

PennyDreadful,3c9jp9,16intheclip,2,Mon Jul 6 15:21:14 2015 UTC,The inevitable introduction of Dracula was already a given. Logan was clearly not referring to him in the recent interview.

Besides Jekyll & Hyde (which will probably be Frankensteins plot in S3) there really isn't a lot of prominent gothic horror they could draw from that would make a lot of sense. Maybe some Poe stuff, but that's about it - everything else has either been touched on or wouldnt fit."
PennyDreadful,3c9jp9,16intheclip,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:40:04 2015 UTC,"Well whoever it is, it's just definitely not Dracula haha. Logan already revealed Dracula's story as a major arc, it doesn't make sense to tease him again, or even be so secretive about something already known. We all think it is Dracula because it is the most inevitable. Fair enough. But don't forget that this show is full of surprises, Logan has also stated before how he hopes to maintain that element of surprise throughout so that fans can never be able to predict the plot."

All the possible character development that could naturally be written for them lies within other pre existing characters. Frankenstein already suffers guilt from his abominable creations whilst Ethan fears the thing he himself changes into, both traits you'd see in Jekyll. Dorian grey is already the embodiment of a creature contorted and corrupted by excess and sin which is often what Hyde is a representation of. Whilst Clare looks similar to how you'd imagine Hyde.

PennyDreadful,3c9rk5,sageicedragonx,2,Mon Jul 6 15:17:32 2015 UTC,The only thing I was disappointed this season was the pacing. It was slow slow slow...CRANK UP to 11 the last 2-3 eps. Some character deaths were too sudden even though they have spent a lot of time building them. Other than that I thought it was fine. This is what happens when you have a lot of characters to get through. Pacing becomes harder.

Sure, proteus happens to be the name of a sea god and it has meaning to the characters former life, but the way he chose it was just picking a word out of a book. John Clare, who I still prefer to call Caliban as I feel John Clare is just his chosen alias, actually picked his name as a conscious representation of his thoughts and feelings. John Clare's poems are like writings from his own soul, so you could argue that his choice is more meaningful and self-aware than Proteus'."

I wouldn't be surprised if she goes off the deep end. Maybe not this season but the next.  I want to see Ethan catch brona being alive...that would be awesome. It would tear Frankenstein from the group into isolation just like his monster.   I see sir Malcolm a broken man after this season and Dorian finally coming together as the real reason for his existence. I totally wouldn't mind lily and Dorian tag up for next season.

Although Ethan is going to need some victory to counter balance his devastation when he finds out about Sembene. And it would be great for Lyle to do it with that tiny gun.  Basically, anyone but Victor, I guess - he has a whole other thing to worry about in Brona/Lily.  I can't wait to see Vanessa battling the fetish. Is she taking on the Master directly?  She usually doesn't get to do that fully clothed and ready for battle.  Eva Green is everything - it's going to be phenomenal.  Please let Ethan get some love from Vanessa.  He's going to break without it. She needs to be his protector for a bit, and rebuild him.  I do love Sarah Greene so I'm conflicted about Hecate getting her comeuppance.

Maybe Sembene was one of the native Africans who assisted the Europeans when they came over, cuz those were totally an archetype (why risk the safety of your village of you can just rat out the poor fuckers next door?). My guess is he was scarred and subsequently shunned for his dealings with the white men and Malcolm took him in when they met. He's ashamed but accepts responsibility for his actions, because the scars remind him every day. That would explain his loyalty to his beliefs and secrecy about where he's from, y'know?"

It was actually quite common throughout the history of many regions to scar the faces of criminals as a form of punishment/humiliation. There were different symbols for different offenses, done in a way that you would know what crime that person was guilty of without having to question them about it. Although I'm not sure if the circular cheek scarring as seen on Sembene really was an accurate symbol for marking a slave trader in Africa, the show did not make up this concept.

PennyDreadful,3c20m1,mtempissmith,5,Sat Jul 4 02:20:05 2015 UTC,"Probably not Joan of Arc per se, but it may be a witch trials reference. There was an Englishwoman named Joan Smith who married a guy named Clayton back in the 1600's who was condemned to death as a witch. Her case was based on her supposedly blighting animals as I recall. Something that witches supposedly did back then, a plot PD has also used. She and her husband both actually died. Joan (or Jeanne or Jehanne depending upon locale) is very common name in the witchcraft trials literature. She's probably based on a few cases and suspected witches actually. I've read a lot of the case literature and witchfinder's manuals and you will find a lot of ""Joan the Witch"" references in them.

Joan Clayton was virtually executed in the show for the same stuff, because the townspeople were blaming her for all the cattle dying, due to her witchcraft & abortions.  It seems like it's less & less likely that the intention was for her to be interpreted as Joan of Arc, which is a bit of a bummer."

PennyDreadful,3by7mk,sadcatpanda,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:52:08 2015 UTC,"It's definitely its own show, and for that reason alone, it's worth the watch to determine if it's truly your thing or not. I have little doubt they'll ""amp up"" their formula or anything like that. I don't mind the lengthy character studies the show offers, but some rather more action more often."
PennyDreadful,3by7mk,SaltyKyle,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:36:37 2015 UTC,"I am currently binge-watching the second season so I can watch the season finale on monday. Just finished the fifth episode. I can tell you: Things are messed up! In a good way. During the first one or two episodes I was sceptical because I found it a bit corny but by now the show has really picked up. This is the only show that continuously makes me gasp and shout at the tv, besides Game of Thrones."
PennyDreadful,3by7mk,DrPantaleon,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:12:19 2015 UTC,"Awesome in my IMO.   The character development in this show is just about the best I've ever seen.   I think they have a great balance between plot, action and characters."

First 2 episodes didn't like that much...but I kept watching and WOW, Penny Dreadful is superior in every episode. It's better than 1st season, in my opinion and that's hard to say for how much I loved 1st season. So, I recommend you to check it out!"
PennyDreadful,3by7mk,Mcn1011,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:41:39 2015 UTC,It's slower and less about them hunting things and more about them being hunted. They expand on backstories and show us the outcome of Victor taking Bronas corpse. I didn't enjoy it as much as the first I must admit but I still think it was a good season.
PennyDreadful,3bx44t,acindron,14,Thu Jul 2 21:40:47 2015 UTC,"I thought most people hated Caliban. I've certainly never seen him be a fan favorite. For me, I hated him from the moment he killed Proteus and wish he'd just go away or die. His ""poor me, make me a girlfriend because I'm such a freak (when he's not even that hideous)"" attitude has gone on for far too long. I tend to root for the bad guys too but he's just insufferable.  I think my favorite character is Dorian and I'd love to see him engaged more in the central plot. It's sort of a waste of the character to have him on his own for so much of the show."
PennyDreadful,3bx44t,living_vicariously,8,Fri Jul 3 00:19:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the guy who lost half his face had a more confident, can-do attitude than John Clare, his hangups and delusional whining make him hard to like or worry about."
PennyDreadful,3bx44t,fangsonwangs,5,Fri Jul 3 06:04:11 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to comment that Roper (the guy with half the face) wasn't reanimated in a middle aged corpse having to learn about society and become accustomed to life without his deformities. If I ever became disfigured sure I'd become jaded from people looking at me but I'd understand most of it, probably having been guilty of doing so myself. Caliban never had that experience so all he knows is most of London views him as a freak and with disgust.  With that said I do get how it can get tiring after so many episodes of Caliban playing the sympathy card."
PennyDreadful,3bx44t,mario0318,3,Fri Jul 3 18:01:38 2015 UTC,"Well, the thing I don't like about The Creature is that he is very angry and feeling pain about Frankenstein, every time he is like ""i'm gonna kill you bla bla bla"" but when he falls on creatures like our Vanessa or Lavinia (the blind girl ;) he is like a child who don't know what to say. But I do hope his character will change after the lock up."
PennyDreadful,3bx44t,MetstheThird,3,Thu Jul 2 22:02:53 2015 UTC,"that's how the creature is in the book, he HATE frankenstein, seethingly so, but is VERY sensitive and very eloquent, but gets VERY angry when he is rejected. while i believe this adaptation of the character is the closest to the books ive ever seen, It still is missing something."

PennyDreadful,3bx44t,fangsonwangs,2,Thu Jul 2 22:04:19 2015 UTC,"Frankenstein is someone I want to root for but he's just weird sometimes. He seems to be getting closer with the group and I think he'll be better for it. Maybe Vanessa will mediate between them at some point.   When she's not possessed or scared she's super charming and up to be a buddy for almost everyone, but victor and John Clare are like her little brothers. When she interacts with them, they seem more disarmed and comfortable than with anyone else, and the fact that she's female doesn't get them choked up and awkward like they do with others. Its all cute even if I don't like them that much."

PennyDreadful,3btlww,colemarie10,5,Thu Jul 2 18:10:19 2015 UTC,They better not kill him. Waste of a character if they did. He would have also been a literal magic Negro trope...
PennyDreadful,3btlww,sadcatpanda,2,Thu Jul 2 10:01:05 2015 UTC,"Sembene is just in shock unless the show tells me otherwise. And if it does say otherwise, he's just hiding.  To our second question: yes, I've wanted to know more about him since he showed up on screen."
PennyDreadful,3btlww,i_bite_right,2,Sat Jul 4 12:05:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not against the idea of him not being dead, but I think it would be a good way to kind of keep me attached to this show. If you look at all the central characters, there are very few who are actually human. Even the ones who are seem to have some sort of secrets, like Dr. Frankenstein and his undead or Vanessa who, well, no one is quite sure of.  I know everyone really wants Sembene to go super saiyan and reveal that he was in fact the most powerful of them all but was keeping it hidden, but I like how he is portrayed as a mere human, someone who can stand with the rest of the characters because that is just the type of strong character he is. No bells and whistles, just pure man, one of a stoic nature, and one who has been through enough in life to be able to not take shit from anyone or anything.   If he dies, then great, I'd be filled with a bit of grief and sadness but in the end I'll keep watching the show because of the bittersweet memories of him.  If he lives, then great, but they risk upping the cheese factor of the show, which thankfully, so far they've been able to avoid or do well with (at least for me) but who knows how long that will last?"
PennyDreadful,3btlww,ddddamn,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:24:10 2015 UTC,"Almost all of the main protagonists are human, chandler is a werewolf but he doesn't control it and it doesn't benefit him in fighting, when he fights, he does so as a human with guns. Sir Malcolm is definitely human and only fights with guns too, franky can't even fire a weapon. Vanessa is least human of them all, she always had a connection with magic and evil. The rest of them had none, and franky doesn't count as anything supernatural because what he did with reanimation, he did It with science, so anyone can do it. They are all humans who are dealing with this shit and trying to survive. Only Vanessa and Ethan have a bit of magic about them."

PennyDreadful,3btlww,chronaden,-14,Thu Jul 2 12:33:06 2015 UTC,Because this series often has parallels and themes. The bite mirrored the previous one. In the previous one the bitten one came out unscathed. Sorry if this concept is too much for you.
PennyDreadful,3btlww,PalermoJohn,6,Thu Jul 2 13:02:34 2015 UTC,Dorian healed because he is Dorian Gray. Not because of some silly idea of parallels.

PennyDreadful,3bssod,acindron,3,Thu Jul 2 21:42:19 2015 UTC,"it actually did when she was yelling at the creature, and i think her memory came back at ball, because that is when her attitude changed."
PennyDreadful,3bssod,Dashrider,4,Fri Jul 3 05:27:38 2015 UTC,It is hard to tell if she completely remembers being Brona. I think she may just have pieces of her old memory.  Her accent does briefly revert when she pummels Caliban while giving her speech.  Her hatred towards men may be her remembering her life as Brona. She possibly doesn't remember Chandler at all and would be interesting to see how she reacts when they inevitably meet again.

So I'm quite content with them turning Lily and Dorian unto the villains next season. At least we finally would get some Dorian payoff.   I also wanna see Sembene alive and well and bad ass as ever with a motherfucking flashback episode.   Also, more new characters that fit in with this world and mythology from fiction, not just new characters that are purely for the show.   And actually, to be honest, much as I'm surprised to say this, the occasional monster of the week episode wouldn't hurt.   And Sir Malcolm back to being his commanding, leading self. I liked him best in the pilot. We need more of that.  Most important of all, I want more ACTION. I love the show, but it spends too much time building up and not enough delivering. We need more to happen throughout the season to really justify ten episodes."

He's been so gentle, but he's had that many people hate him or be terrified of him that after this it may break a part of him. With some encouragement from Lily, he'll be the perfect vengeful puppet."

PennyDreadful,3boabv,fangsonwangs,2,Thu Jul 2 04:08:05 2015 UTC,I think Lilly and Dorian will visit the exhibition and see him there an so release him.   I think Caliban should  maim and disfigure them so they know what it's like to be a freak. The girl will never be able to marry because who could ever love a monster. Beauty and the Beast style

So I think he'll be there for a while and he might even find a love interest in one of the freaks.    If time does pass, then Lily and Dorian could find there way down there in search of amusement. There's no reason for Frankenstein to go, or any other character. So if he doesn't bust himself out I think it's likely there'll be a new character.    What happens to the family? I think he should kill the parents and crush the blind girl's hands."

PennyDreadful,3bjcif,hahaheeheehoho,7,Tue Jun 30 01:00:43 2015 UTC,"Oh what the hell, might as well put it all up. It's a fabulous poem, even for Byron...I like part about the unholy altar...shiver, sigh, grin...  Darkness By Lord Byron (George Gordon) I had a dream, which was not all a dream. The bright sun was extinguish'd, and the stars Did wander darkling in the eternal space, Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air; Morn came and went—and came, and brought no day, And men forgot their passions in the dread Of this their desolation; and all hearts Were chill'd into a selfish prayer for light: And they did live by watchfires—and the thrones, The palaces of crowned kings—the huts, The habitations of all things which dwell, Were burnt for beacons; cities were consum'd, And men were gather'd round their blazing homes To look once more into each other's face; Happy were those who dwelt within the eye Of the volcanos, and their mountain-torch: A fearful hope was all the world contain'd; Forests were set on fire—but hour by hour They fell and faded—and the crackling trunks Extinguish'd with a crash—and all was black. The brows of men by the despairing light Wore an unearthly aspect, as by fits The flashes fell upon them; some lay down And hid their eyes and wept; and some did rest Their chins upon their clenched hands, and smil'd; And others hurried to and fro, and fed Their funeral piles with fuel, and look'd up With mad disquietude on the dull sky, The pall of a past world; and then again With curses cast them down upon the dust, And gnash'd their teeth and howl'd: the wild birds shriek'd And, terrified, did flutter on the ground, And flap their useless wings; the wildest brutes Came tame and tremulous; and vipers crawl'd And twin'd themselves among the multitude, Hissing, but stingless—they were slain for food. And War, which for a moment was no more, Did glut himself again: a meal was bought With blood, and each sate sullenly apart Gorging himself in gloom: no love was left; All earth was but one thought—and that was death Immediate and inglorious; and the pang Of famine fed upon all entrails—men Died, and their bones were tombless as their flesh; The meagre by the meagre were devour'd, Even dogs assail'd their masters, all save one, And he was faithful to a corse, and kept The birds and beasts and famish'd men at bay, Till hunger clung them, or the dropping dead Lur'd their lank jaws; himself sought out no food, But with a piteous and perpetual moan, And a quick desolate cry, licking the hand Which answer'd not with a caress—he died. The crowd was famish'd by degrees; but two Of an enormous city did survive, And they were enemies: they met beside The dying embers of an altar-place Where had been heap'd a mass of holy things    For an unholy usage; they rak'd up, And shivering scrap'd with their cold skeleton hands The feeble ashes, and their feeble breath Blew for a little life, and made a flame Which was a mockery; then they lifted up Their eyes as it grew lighter, and beheld Each other's aspects—saw, and shriek'd, and died— Even of their mutual hideousness they died, Unknowing who he was upon whose brow Famine had written Fiend. The world was void, The populous and the powerful was a lump, Seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless— A lump of death—a chaos of hard clay. The rivers, lakes and ocean all stood still, And nothing stirr'd within their silent depths; Ships sailorless lay rotting on the sea, And their masts fell down piecemeal: as they dropp'd They slept on the abyss without a surge— The waves were dead; the tides were in their grave, The moon, their mistress, had expir'd before; The winds were wither'd in the stagnant air, And the clouds perish'd; Darkness had no need Of aid from them—She was the Universe."
PennyDreadful,3bjcif,mtempissmith,4,Tue Jun 30 01:48:46 2015 UTC,I'm still hoping Sembene makes it out. Seems a shame to finally give him some goddamn backstory and then erase him.

PennyDreadful,3bjcif,StoicBanana,2,Wed Jul 1 21:54:16 2015 UTC,Looks like Ethan slashing Evelyn.
PennyDreadful,3bjcif,AvatarJack,2,Tue Jun 30 16:13:44 2015 UTC,"I was just watching (obsessing) over this promo and focused on the Dorian scenes. In the first, it looks like he's giving that seductive look to Victor (foreground, blurred, but - I'm 99% sure that's him). In the second, it looks like Victor (again, 99%) is watching him dance with Lily (might assume this scene would come before). If Victor is going to confront Dorian, knowing what Dorian already knows about the situation (Victor knows Vanessa, Brona was with Ethan, Ethan got his heart broken by Brona last season and went to  Dorian for comfort, Brona is now ""Lily Frankenstein"" and suddenly immortal and superstrong and was ""Victor's cousin"" though we think Dorian knew the truth all along, and at least up to now Victor doesn't know Lily's true nature... this could be really, really good. Especially if he's going to attempt to blackmail Victor. Seems like Dorian knows a lot of secrets other than his own thanks to his seductive ways.  I have too much time on my hands, I guess ;) Is it Sunday yet?"
PennyDreadful,3bjcif,unephemeral,2,Wed Jul 1 19:12:17 2015 UTC,"The Dorian part is what grabbed my attention. Although you might be right that he was talking to Victor, my first thought was that he was talking to somebody who looks like Dorian himself...  Edit: I think you are right, it is Victor."
PennyDreadful,3bjcif,DucksAreMyFriends,3,Thu Jul 2 01:02:44 2015 UTC,"In one of Victor's room-induced hallucinations, I would imagine. I mean, Lily's dancing with Dorian did trigger jealousy and feelings of inadequacy that would be alone fodder to torture him with, I think."
PennyDreadful,3bjcif,CraftyAitrus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:09:29 2015 UTC,"My thought was that maybe this happens after the other scene Showtime released where Victor was in the carriage with Ferdinand - my assumption being they somehow leave the castle and Victor, armed with his hallucinatory revelations that we know not what, goes off in search of his wayward children. Then again, who knows... this is what happens when one has too much time on their hands before the season finale of what has become their favorite show to dissect and obsess over!"
PennyDreadful,3bjcif,unephemeral,2,Fri Jul 3 19:05:49 2015 UTC,Amen to that. Do you ever just stand there in the shower running through all the details over and over again?
PennyDreadful,3bjcif,DucksAreMyFriends,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:50:15 2015 UTC,"I actually got someone who hadn't been interested, and was tired of listening to me, to watch the first two episodes of season 1 with me last night. I hadn't seen them in a year, and now of course we either know or can speculate knowledgeably on so much more than before - and I was absolutely astonished at the amount of foreshadowing of this season that was contained in last. Little throwaway phrases and shots. For instance, in Episode 2 ""Seance"", I noticed that Vanessa sensed Dorian in the doorway before she ever saw him. She did the slow turn towards him, but he had never said a word and she was at least 20 feet from him when her head snapped up a little and her eyes widened.  At the time I didn't even notice - I knew who Dorian was in the literary sense of course, but he had always seemed extraneous to the show other than to gather everyone's secrets while seducing them, haha - but now it seems VERY significant in light of the Dorian screentime since Angelique."
PennyDreadful,3bjcif,unephemeral,2,Fri Jul 3 20:23:01 2015 UTC,"Very interesting! I have been wanting to go back and watch season 1 from start, now I also want to write down all the moments of foreshadowing as I watch.  But do you have any other examples?"
PennyDreadful,3bjcif,DucksAreMyFriends,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:08:40 2015 UTC,"Much of it has been alluded to recently, like when Rusk mentioned the whole ""searching for a beast"" bit. Ethan was clearly shown to be drawn inexorably to Vanessa even though he didn't know why - he was skulking around the house even though he couldn't make himself knock on the door, then he finally did and of course after their banter about the demimonde - and Ethan's very firm conviction in it, which seemed to not surprise her in the least - he chose ""The Lovers"" card, which had two points that I hadn't caught before - 1, the image on ""The Lovers"" is The Scorpion about to sting an upturned mouth. Also, Vanessa had already chosen the card before Ethan picked it up, after she told him not to choose impulsively. Dorian mentions at Lyle's party that he (mysteriously) only had received the invitation that day - he'd never met Lyle before that. He and Vanessa were like magnets from the second she sensed him in the other room, in the doorway, and she clung to him during the seance - when Madame Kali breathed ""Amunet"" her grip on him got even tighter.  bla bla bla tl;dr I'd love to hear your thoughts for sure. I hadn't found this subreddit until just a few days ago, I had been boring all my friends to tears, so it's nice to have a place to blather :)"
PennyDreadful,3bjcif,unephemeral,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:34:39 2015 UTC,"YES. Right after I posted the comment asking for more examples (and before I saw your reply) I went back and watched the first episode myself and I came here precisely to add the detail about The Lovers tarot card! That's a big one. Side note, I'm also surprised how much of a douche Victor was in the beginning. Makes me realize how much his character has grown, how much his terrible mistakes have humbled him. I think he's changed more than any of the the other characters (not counting Brona, obviously.)  There should be a retrospective thread for each S1 episode, that would be so amazing.   And having people to discuss it with is a blessing. It doesn't matter how sharp you are, this show is one of those where you need to discuss and dissect it to make sense of it sometimes!"
PennyDreadful,3bjcif,DucksAreMyFriends,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:23:41 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely be down for an epic rewatch!  Victor's descent into addiction and the love and care Vanessa has had for him both have been huge storylines for me. That's why I'm not as grumpy when the storyline seems slow... generally, I'm learning more about the characters. Not one of them is one-dimensional, as over-the-top as they seemed at first. Victor was so pretentious, arrogant, and then... he lived through some crazy crazy stuff and had to admit that science really didn't have all the answers, at least where the Victorian Scoobies are concerned.  I'm actually nervous about tonight... everything I've read from John Logan's mouth leads me to believe I'm going to be wandering around for a year with jazz hands.

In many ways Vanessa is the soul of the show, she is a wholly original creation in a medley of literary classics, is a unifier and the source of dramatic tension. Her death would be clumsy storytelling.  I think Ethan will survive as long as Vanessa does, he being a dramatic pairing with the main protagonist.  I don't think Sir Malcolm will survive, but his death will come at the end of the series as he reflects on all of his losses.  Perhaps Caliban would die once he learns what it means to be human, and be accepted for his humanity, giving his narrative arc a sense of completion.  I think Frankenstein will survive, learning to live with the burden of the pain he has inflicted on his tragic creations.  I think Lily will be the main villain of season 3 and die at the end of it.  Of course, we can't deal with Dorian Gray without his character arc culminating in the destruction of his portrait and loss of immortal self.  I don't think the death of Lyle will serve any purpose towards the 'major dramatic quest' of the series and therefore his death will just deprive the show of its much needed comic relief."
