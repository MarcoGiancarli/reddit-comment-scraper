geography,3duiop,aamirislam,5,Sun Jul 19 16:39:01 2015 UTC,"I can explain some of Boston, I live here so this is just what I've heard, not positive if its accurate though... Alliston-Brighton was annexed by Boston but Brookline clings to its independence even though it really should be annexed. Charlestown is culturally part of Boston even though it's on the Cambridge side of the Charles River. East Boston is the same way, except it's on the wrong side of the harbor.   A lot of this makes more sense when you look at how much of Boston is infill. This gif explains it really well."

geography,3duiop,describingthesky,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:49:46 2015 UTC,Didn't they do that when they consolidated the 5 boroughs?
geography,3duiop,chrispmorgan,2,Sun Jul 19 21:15:45 2015 UTC,"It tends to be state by state but, generally speaking, the big western cities wanted growth wherever they could get it and had control over water infrastructure, which developers needed even though they didn't want to pay property taxes that cities needed.   My sense is that the ones that became enclaves were situations where the land the owners were already on the wealthy side and could pay more for water service. I'm thinking of Piedmont (Oakland; which turned down annexation by ~8 votes), Highland Park/Univ. Park (Dallas).  Don't know if Burbank/Glendale (Los Angeles) had a similar story but you'll notice that Los Angeles annexed all the way through the San Fernando Vy and took the effort to get down to get the port but didn't bother to annex much of what is ""South LA""."

Since deregulation and the forced breakup of the company, regional carriers have controlled original AT&T assets such as this massive regional switch. There are large satellite switches, too, some of which I've gotten to see firsthand. (One used to be located a few blocks away in the basement of another building.)  Verizon controls several main switches on the East Coast."
