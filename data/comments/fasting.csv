Then weight yourself and measure body fat over every few days consistently to look for a decreasing body fat % with weight trend."
fasting,3e3v10,UncleTomandJerry,-5,Tue Jul 21 19:30:05 2015 UTC,Yes.  Our bodies are designed for feast or famine.  Read Dr. Jason Fung's blog post on the subject: https://intensivedietarymanagement.com/caloric-reduction-vs-fasting-part-9/
fasting,3e3cdo,WaterFastB4,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:15:52 2015 UTC,"According to the Wolfram Alpha Weight Loss Calculator (google it to see for yourself) if you were completely sedentary it would take you 44 days to lose 30 lbs. This is a rough estimate, I also assumed you were 25 years old, but if you do the calculation yourself with accurate numbers I know it won't vary too much.  This is very, very long term fasting. For someone at your height and weight (which was similar to mine, so I have a little experience with your goals and starting weight), you've got extra lbs you want to drop, but you're not technically overweight. This long of a fast is not for you, especially if you have never fasted before. I highly doubt somewhere at your stats is going to be able to fast for over 40 days with no lasting health issues coming out of it.  Here is my recommendation- if you've never fasted before, fast for 1-2 days at first to get a feel for it. Those two are the roughest. After the fast, rest for a week or so while eating raw fruits, veggies, yogurt, easily digestible natural foods for the day after, then stay at maintenance calories/slight calorie deficit for the rest of the week. If the first fast went well and you were able to have the self-control to not binge and eased yourself back into a healthy diet, maybe try 7-10 day fast. This will get that jump start you want for your weight lost, and more importantly, reset your body to get used to healthy foods. Then after that I would suggest a refeed of ~3 days starting with fruit/veg juices and natural, no sugar added yogurts, then raw veggies, then some rice/beans, and finally adding meat in at the end. Gradually increase calories over these three days, and eat every bite slooooowly. The goal of this is to get your stomach used to eating again, and ease yourself into a good diet, rather than the stuff you are eating that made you unhappy with your body in its current state.  You have to crawl before you walk. Baby steps. Fasting is not just some way to easily drop 30 lbs in a month, and is impossible to do so unless you're very overweight (which you're not). Take all my advice with a grain of salt- I'm not a fasting expert or a medical professional. (I've only done 3 fasts of 2 days before, currently on my fourth at day 4 of 10) Do some research, scroll through this sub and educate yourself. It is 1000x more important for you to use fasting as a tool to help fix your mental and physical relationship with food, which is most likely the source of your weight gain. Crash-fasting with no practice just to drop 30lbs is treating a symptom, not the root cause.  If any other people with more experience fasting have advice/corrections to this, I would greatly appreciate it, as I am midway through my first big fast myself, and am still learning."

fasting,3e3cdo,LiamNeesonsMegaCock,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:16:13 2015 UTC,"The calculator won't work on mobile, not sure if it's a technical issue you're talking about. Yeah if you've done 3 days before then you're ok to jump to a longer fast. As for how much weight you would lose on a 20 day fast, probably a little less than 1 lb per day, after you regain water weight once you start eating again.  I would shoot for 7-14 days for your first long term fast, just to be safe. You're technically at a healthy weight as it is even if you're carrying extra fat around, and you really don't want to risk health for quick weight loss. I wouldn't say your previous fasts were unhelpful- even though they didn't help you lose weight, you already know what it's like to fast, and have gained the experience! That's pretty invaluable in my book :)  With moderate exercise, it'll only lose you another 1/2 lb per week to be honest. It takes roughly a 3500 calorie deficit each week to lose a pound. I would definitely not recommend it- the first few days cravings are pretty rough plus exercise makes you hungrier after, and after that your blood pressure is so low that it's really tough to maintain. It might not be worth it unless you're trying to maintain fitness level for an upcoming race or something.  I would really really recommend you accept that your body is the way it is right now, and you're not going to be able to find a quick fix for losing weight. Focus on taking it one day at a time. You WILL fail if you try to push yourself beyond your limits and lose the weight as quickly as possible. Use the fast as a jump start for weight loss and getting back into a healthy diet, and then work on scraping off 0.5-1 lb per week by logging food and calorie counting until you meet your goal.  I'm 5'4'' 23 years old, female, starting weight 145 also, currently on day 4 of my first 10 day fast, so we're in a similar boat, and might have some of the same experiences. So if you have any questions about your first long term fast, I'm pretty much going through it right now :)"

This may be difficult but pretty worth it imo. I'm so used to this by now that I don't get too hungry at all. When I do eat I get full very fast and feel satisfied, all while staying in a caloric deficit.    I would recommend trying out a full fast for 3 days and seeing how you do with that. Like I said, I find full fasts great for losing weight and IF for maintaining weight. You haven't gained a pound, which for me before fasting would be a victory in and of itself"

The less time you are eating, the more time your body has to use your body fat stores and regulate your appetite.  Every meal triggers insulin and even a small amount of insulin will prevent your body from using body fat.  I am very insulin-resistant and only lose when I eat one meal a day.

fasting,3dy3xk,SondraRose,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:51:47 2015 UTC,"Yo! I am a huge fan of IF and have definitely both lost weight and gained weight on it at different times. Here's what has helped me lost fat efficiently:   Definitely record your intake, but also plan it out ahead of time. Write down a basic ""map"" of what you'll be eating and when during your feeding window.  Along the lines of 4 Hour Body, eat the same-ish things every day. For example, I break my fast with a protein shake, wait 90 mins, then eat a giant salad and my cooked, major meal. My final meal right before the end of my FW I allow a ""treat"" that's still fairly healthy. This set up with the consistentcy makes follow-through significantly more likely.  Weigh yourself every goddamn morning. Write it down in your food log. Keep track of it down the side of a page in there.  Cut out grains if at all possible. This has been huge for me in losing weight and also staving off hunger. Don't just work out in the final hour, but try to get in a little activity during your feeding window. I've found a 1 mile walk after-dinner (biggest meal) but before my final snack at night to be awesome for reasons NOT calorie related. It quells hunger, helps insulin levels, and aligns the mind if you will to losing weight."
fasting,3dy3xk,kidnappedbandit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:27:21 2015 UTC,"calories in - calories out = what happens.  if you are not losing weight, you are overeating.  It's VERY easy to do with these, because you are sitting there anticipating food, you mentally get hungry, you overeat.  SLOW DOWN your eating and STOP eating once you are no longer hungry.  Not full, just not hungry.  There's also water weight to figure in.  All the metabolism, ""types"" of food, times for eating, etc are all bullshit.  Ditto with the eating 6 times a day.  It's a combination of keeping yourself from being as hungry during the day and non-counting calorie counting.  Also if you've been lifting or building any muscle, it will add weight.    If you want to keep eating, go with a grilled small chicken breast that's been brined and marinated in ovenight, or a 200g fillet of salmon cooked with a little olive oil.  Garnish either with some nutless homemade pesto.  Have some lettuce.  Eat pretty much as much celery as you want.  And that's it.  That's your meal, eat it nice and slow and enjoy every bite of it, snack on celery.  If you're lifting, be sure to have your protein and supplement your magnesium, potassium and calcium.  What I have learned in my own experience, is that calorie counting fails for most people every time in the long run.  They (myself included) will stick to a regime, and then find an excuse to stop, or get lazy, or cheat a little then a little more, or get close to goal weight and eat more as a ""reward""... so many excuses, and it's so easy to fall off the wagon.  a few ways I have seen work:   People who for whatever reason ENJOY the change in diet and stick to it because they are no longer mentally counting. (these are unusual) People who admit to themselves they can't handle it and turn to the gym and running or swimming to ""make up for it"" constantly, making the gym and sport a part of their lives.  These people tend to have not been fat for long. People who are borderline psychotic and dream up silly ideas in their head about why things work the way they do.  It's like 12 steppers who dream up silly reasons why they have no will power of their own. People who change by eating the same kinds of stuff, but just far less of it.  I have seen GREAT results from 5:2 both friends and family who have been yoyoing.  The mental awareness of ""no food today"" just kills the hunger, as you are not expecting food, or anticipating it.  You create the deficit to gradually lose, or maintain."

You must track EVERY SINGLE BITE OF FOOD. And don't forget to log your exercise. You can work your ass off with exercise if you want to earn a special meal or treat.  I found that keeping carbs fairly low and getting plenty of fiber made it a lot easier. You gotta stick with that calorie goal every day though. If you happen to go over, take it out of the next day's allowance. Don't make it a habit. After a couple of weeks of calorie restriction and exercise it does get much easier.  I do fast but it's to alleviate health issues, not lose weight. It was MUCH easier for me to purposely lose weight by watching calories and exercising. Fasting puts stress on the body and I can really feel it... I get clenched up after awhile. You have no energy when you fast, literally. You really shouldn't be doing physical stuff when you're not eating... and this 16/8 thing... doesn't really sound like fasting to me anyway. I don't consider anything less than 24 hours to be a fast, but that's just me. It sounds like what you were doing was making yourself so hungry that you binge like crazy when you're allowed to.  I realize that losing 2 lbs a week might sound like too slow of a pace, however it is a pace that you can more easily maintain in the long run. There are fewer ups and downs emotionally when you maintain a steady diet and steady exercise. It just makes more sense, imo.  But, yes, to answer your question... you were most definitely overeating. That's easy to do when you're eating lots of fats.  Also, after exercise you will want some carbs. Glucose is what you want. It stops your muscles from wasting away after heavy use."

fasting,3doxsq,PM_me_cyborgs,3,Sat Jul 18 01:38:15 2015 UTC,"It might be too many potentially volatile ingredients to break a fast with.   Maybe try spreading it out with just fruit, then, just soy milk, then, just protein powder, instead of eating all three at once. But if this is the first time this has happened and it has worked before, then I'm not really sure.  Also, out of curiosity, what do you spend your time doing when you're fasting? Like, activities, things you do for fun, things you read and focus on?  And why 7/2? How much (caloriewise) do you eat on those two days?"
fasting,3doxsq,evanescott,2,Sat Jul 18 08:08:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the suggestion. After I did as the other commentator said I was feeling good enough and managed an apple but nothing else sadly.   On my fasting days I live life as normal. I walk 2k every other day on the trails, as well as volunteer at the SPCA walking and grooming the dogs three days a week. When I'm at home I'm mostly sedentary, reading, Reddit, movies and crafts. As far as motivation goes Reddit is my main source. I've been lurking up until now with my main account but decided to make this one yesterday and jump in.  I do 7/2 mainly out of nessessity. Ideally I would do 3/2 but I have a regularly scheduled overnight with my parents (both aging, both would lose their minds if they knew I was fasting) where I get all of their housework done and they insist on feeding me. I usually end up eating between 2000-4000 cal when I'm with them - just depends on what they decide I have to eat. Because of the stomach pain yesterday I only had about 625 cal, but today I'm sure they'll make me make up for it."

fasting,3dj7o4,sfted999,6,Fri Jul 17 16:56:34 2015 UTC,"Just my opinion...   1) Drink when you're thirsty and even more when you're hungry. Water intake is going to vary by person (I have never liked the 8 glasses a day crap). Drink when you need to and listen to your body. Dehydration is an easy thing to notice. 2) You can definitely still study. If it's your first time, you may have some mental challenges (due to hunger) that draw your attention away, but you can fast and work full time easily once you get into the groove. 3) Supplements to help you with what? Some will probably disagree with me, but I continue my regular supplementation when I fast and don't do anything special for the fast. 4) Sure? Seems like a waste of a day :) You are better off getting a hobby or putting extra time into studying... anything that will take your mind off the hunger. Sleeping will probably just be crappy since you are hungry. 5) Don't look at it as messing up. If you break down and have a snack, just continue after you snack. Not a good habit of getting into if you're trying to overcome the mental affects, but you didn't undo the entire fast because you ate something. Celebrate the small victories. Fasting 90% of the 7 days of your first fast is still a great personal win. You can use that momentum to plan your next fast and maybe shoot for 95% (or 100%!).   Good luck! Keep us posted."
fasting,3dj7o4,alittlebitmental,3,Thu Jul 16 19:55:06 2015 UTC,"Here's my advice...   Start with shorter fasts, and build up from there. As the others have said, try a one day fast first (and see point 2). Remember that the biggest battle is a psychological one. Fasting is actually quite easy, but your mind will rebel against it. It is much easier to build up from one day fasts than it is to start with a longer one. Always listen to your body, and don't be ashamed of ending a fast early if it doesn't feel right or you feel unwell. I have ended a number of fasts prematurely for these reasons. Make sure that you fully understand how to end a fast. In particular, look into refeeding syndrome. It is a real and dangerous thing. Prepare for your fast properly. I find that fasting is much easier if you can clear your bowels in the days before (you get fewer feelings of hunger). My technique is to take psyllium husks (or high fibre foods) in the days leading up. Try and keep yourself busy during your fast (see point 2). Do what ever you can to distract yourself. The first few days of any fast are the hardest   In answer to your questions..   how much water should i drink a day and what time should i be drinking   I just drink when I need it. Remember that dehydration can feel like hunger.    can i still focus on study while doing this fasting   Most definitely. In fact, once you get used to fasting, you will find that your mind becomes so much clearer. I do a lot of intermittent fasting for this reason.   any suplement that can help me   Most people don't take supplements during fasting. In fact, ingesting any food/supplements might make your fast harder   if i'm feeling terrible hungry can i just sleep the whole day?   Sure, but you will actually find that you need a lot less sleep during the day.   if i mess up can i just start over the next day ?   I would leave it for a few days before you try again.

fasting,3diukx,BattleWhisk,3,Thu Jul 16 16:57:23 2015 UTC,"Just be sure to start slow. You have to give your digestive system a chance to get up and running.   For most successful resumption of regular consumption, start small: veggie broth and herbal teas; melons next (but be careful, the joy of fresh fruit can be tempting to binge on--take small bites and wait many minutes in between); to go with fruit, enjoy soft greens like spinach, romaine, etc. I would avoid heavy fats until following day.   Just take it slow. Listen to your system. Give it a chance to get things running again. Don't worry about counting calories.   Listen and you'll know what you need.

I'm not convinced it's sustainable long term but there's also no harm trying it. I'm more curious as to why you've had trouble with with the other methods. You shouldn't need to go to such an extreme at all, so something is wrong here.  I used to do 20/4, then 36/12 and currently do 44/4 (I think I calced that right lol, Eg I eat 1pm-5pm Monday, 1pm-5pm Wednesday and so on).  Did you count calories at all? Calculate your TDEE?   While both keto and fating are great for weight loss but they're also not magic, it's still important you're not eating more calories per week than your weekly TDEE. If your weekly TDEE is 14000, it doesn't matter whether you're doing keto and fasting if you're still eating 15000 calories per week. It's harder to eat over your TDEE using these methods, but not impossible.  One other thing to note is for a lot of women the 2 week span around their period (from around the week before till the week after) they'll retain more water than usual which can throw off the scales and make it seem like you're not losing, so maybe 1 month isn't enough time to confirm whether it was working or not for sure."

The mean decrease in BMR (12.3%) almost exactly paralleled the mean decrease in body weight (13.3%).   Which was less than 3 months. Not quite 7 days, I know, but it falls in line with the established observation that fasting, and caloric restriction as a whole reduce BMR over the long term. I'd argue that the time when BMR begins to drop from it's initial peak & hormones like ghrelin adjust accordingly isn't far from the 5-7 day mark, however I can't say I've found study results, or at least measurements of BMR at less than a month aside from the aforementioned source."

A systematic review.  Abstract  Severe dietary energy restriction is often used for overweight or obese individuals to achieve rapid weight loss and related health improvements. However, the extent of putative adverse effects on eating behaviour is unknown. We thus systematically searched seven databases for studies that assessed binge eating before and after severe dietary energy restriction (low or very low energy diets) in overweight or obese individuals. Fifteen clinically supervised interventions from 10 publications (nine of which involved only women) were included. Among individuals with clinically relevant pre-treatment binge eating disorder, severe dietary energy restriction significantly decreased binge eating in all four interventions involving this population, at least during the weight loss programme. In contrast, no consistent association between severe dietary energy restriction and the onset of bingeing was found in 11 interventions involving individuals without pre-treatment binge eating disorder, with four such interventions showing significant increases, two showing no change, and five showing significant decreases in binge eating. We conclude that clinically supervised severe dietary energy restriction appears safe and beneficial for overweight or obese individuals with pre-treatment binge eating disorder, and does not necessarily trigger binge eating in those without binge eating disorder."

The lowest satiety score was white bread alone.  There was a progressive linear relationship between the satiety score and the amount of vinegar ingested.  Another study showed that vinegar ingestion resulted in slightly lower caloric intake through the rest of the day (approx 200-275 calories less).  This effect was also noted for peanut products.  Interestingly, peanuts also resulted in a reduction of glycemic response by 55%.

With your height and weight, you don't fall into any of those categories. Most estimates for first week of fasting have people losing 1 - 2.5 lbs per day, capping at around 15 a week. This is going to heavily depend on your age, your water weight retention, regular caloric intake and exercise levels.    Now most of the weight you lose at first will be water weight. But, after your body enters ketosis, it SHOULD start consuming fat for energy. However, as body fat levels drop, most people tend to see a rise in muscle loss (as although you are working out, you're not supplying your body with protein to rebuild any muscles you tear).   I think you'll be looking at 5lbs of loss in the first week. Consider that when you being eating again, a lot of the water weight will return. However, your ability to resist hunger and the reduction of cravings should assist you in being more mindful of what and how much you do eat.    If you didn't already, it's recommended that you ease yourself into a fast (similar to how you should break a fast). Cut out any processed or junk food and stick with the basics in the day or two leading up to your fast - fruits, broths, juices, etc.   Good luck! Not making it the full week isn't failure. It takes time to adjust to these changes. You've probably been eating 3 meals a day for 20 years. That's not an easy habit to break."

Don't expect fast results.  Day 3 will be hard. You have to keep drinking water and persevere! Add some lemon/lime to it but do not break. Keep at it!   When you break fast, do NOT gorge. You will never see results. Fasting will not solve everything, nor do diets. A simple caloric deficit will help you out after you finish your fast to continue losing weight slowly.

fasting,3cuwuf,hastasiempre,5,Sat Jul 11 11:39:47 2015 UTC,"Basically if you are in good general health (without an inflammatory process going on and respectively with already alleviated natural defense mechanisms activated) it won't hurt. Though if your diet is KD (ketogenic) it won't help either e.g. the Inuits/Eskimo don't eat any antioxidants and were pretty fine for centuries before s/o decided to ship them some Big Macs and Coke. i.e. before they started eating carb-laden foods. If you eat carbs mainly you'd better make sure your diet has plenty of anti-oxidants, that's why Asians where TAD (traditional asian diet) is above 50% carbs perform pretty good in the longevity charts (Singapore, Hong Kong, Makau, etc) as they use a lot of anti-oxidants (green tea, berberine, etc. etc.) and also they use maltose instead of glucose which is 1/3 of the GI (glycemic index) compared to glucose."

fasting,3cuwuf,hastasiempre,3,Fri Jul 17 06:10:01 2015 UTC,"I've been subsisting on espresso and water when fasting and it was pretty OK, it helps you kill the hunger urge, so I believe something as black tea will do the same. Def not detrimental as I'm still alive. What I meant by my post is that in healthy subjects taking antioxidants might not have a cumulative positive effect while in stress it may exert negative ones as we already have natural defenses increased.  EDIT: Also both are diuretics which help increase uric acid clearance, a marker of LKB-1 AMPK and co-factors activation and purine nucleotides (protein) disposal as result of increased autophagy."

It's not a real thing.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation_response  Water fasting works because it's zero cal.  not enough nutrients is death.  the brain requires glucose and to make it the body requires protein.  having a bite or two of protein will keep your muscles from falling apart.  people die from this shit because the brain sacrifices things like the fucking heart, or electrolytes are all messed up.  Have your 4700mg of potassium, 800mg of magnesium, some calcium and your sodium, and have a bit of chicken breast, or salmon, or fuck it, 30g of protein powder and your muscles wont waste away.

fasting,3csn8p,BlackOpz,2,Fri Jul 10 20:58:49 2015 UTC,"Whoa! Most normal people have enough reserves to last for weeks without food with no ill permanent effects. Sacrificing the Heart, etc wouldnt prob happen to average person until 40+ days into it. What the body eats for protein before it gets to the vital organs is the beauty of fasting. Also the protein loss slows after a couple days. During my last 3 week fast I estimate I lost 1.5 to 3 lbs of muscle at most. It was a small muscular setback (that I put back on pretty quickly) but the pure permanent fat loss of 20+ lbs was worth it.  ""Autodigestion during fasting During fasting, your body will ""autolyze"", or self-digest, its most inferior and impure materials and metabolic wastes, including: fat deposits, abcesses, dead and dying cells, bumps and protuberances, damaged tissue, calluses, furuncles (small skin abscesses, or boils), morbid accumulations, growths, and amazingly, various kinds of neoplasms (abnormal growths of tissue, or tumors). In ""Fasting and eating for health"", Joel Fuhrman, M.D., notes, p. 10: ""The fast does not merely detoxify; it also breaks down superfluous tissue - fat, abnormal cells, atheromatous plaque, and tumors--and releases diseased tissues and their cellular products into the circulation for elimination. Toxic or unwanted materials circulate in our bloodstream and lymphatic tissues, and are deposited in and released from our fat stores and other tissues. An important element of fasting detoxification is mobilizing the toxins from their storage areas."" New cell growth during fasting is stimulated and accelerated as the required proteins are re-synthesized from decomposed cells (during autolysis). Thus, your serum albumin reading - blood-protein level - remains constant and normal throughout your fast, as your body very smartly uses protein and other stored nutrients where needed. Again, Germany's late Otto Buchinger, M.D., after supervising over 100,000 juice-fasts, eventually concluded what is clearly stated in the book, ""Fasting: the Buchinger Method"", page 22: ""The need for protein diminishes during the fast, until in the second week, it has been reduced from 100 grams to from 15-20 grams a day, and this amount is, in fact, quite sufficient while fasting."""

So think of it this way - a runner who took a few pain meds after their foot started to hurting on the run. They wouldn't feel the pain then, but later on the things they weren't able to feel will come through with a vengeance and they may even hurt their foot worse because of it being numb.   I just worry. If you can get off the meds first before fasting that would be best. Especially since fasting is a very mental and spiritual endeavor, we have the opportunity to work through all of the stuff that may be blocking us from freeing up emotions & being at peace. Anti depressants seem like you'll be floating on the water relaxing when a big alligator swims in the undertow beneath you, if you can't dive in deep, you'll never be able to wrestle it to the shore and float peacefully again.. if that makes sense. It may not be life threateningly dangerous, but it's all about what you want to accomplish through fasting. So if you can't get off them right now, at least cut down the dose.

All the bloggers who talk about their refeeding always describe significant temporary weight gain out of proportion to the calories they are eating - that is because they don't have the right balance of nutrients.

But you can't beat a calories in/out approach if weight loss is your goal.   Don't bite off more than you can chew, it's tough to adjust to ADF at first. I assure you, stick to <500 calories on your down day and you will most definitely lose weight. Don't over complicate it.   If you want to improve FITNESS, then of course do exercise. But are you trying to be a better athlete or lose body fat? If you have to choose between eating less or doing exercise. Eating less always wins for weight loss.   There is a post on here where a guy ate whatever he wanted on eating days and consistently lost over 10 pounds a month for a year and kept it off. He did not exercise."

I once went to a convention where a group of cardiologists were asked if milk was good or bad. It was split 50:50. I wasn't sure, but I have the answer now:  Here is a recent study showing that milk is a driver for diabetes. It is related to the proteins and activation of metabolic pathways - mtorc1.  Milk does not do a body good -   But cheese and yogurt do:   Most recent evidence has been provided that fermentation such as in yoghurt or cheese production destroys or attenuates the exosomal microRNA signaling of milk [93]."

fasting,3cm71c,rcpbubi,2,Thu Jul 9 00:11:15 2015 UTC,Today (Day 3 for me) was extremely easy. It was basically one of those days where you feel you dont have to eat ever again. I have pretty high energy and ended up being quite productive. It amazes me how fast I slip into comfortable fasting these days.  I can feel the mildest of headaches (bloodstream toxins on their way out) but its not hampering me in any way. Also this time was weird in the fact that when I DECIDED to fast and even before I started I could feel my body shifting to 'fasting mode'. Normally it takes me 2/3 days for hunger to vanish. This time it happens on Day 2. Its almost like my subconscious took my intent to fast seriously and started shifting to fasting mode.  I've fasted numerous times and I swear it never fails to amaze me.  The lack of desire for food always puts a smile on my face when I think about people that are struggling with DIETS!! If I could only convince them to stick to fasting for 3 days they would 'get it'.   Today I mentioned I was fasting to a friend and he replied that the longest he could fast was 8 hours. I tell EVERYONE (and they see my results) but refuse to try it. I have yet to convince ONE person to forsake food for a couple days. I wish they could realize the health benefits they're missing. Are Twinkie's and Cheetos THAT good? (Speaking as a person that has a SERIOUS Cheese Popcorn Addiction)  EDIT: RCP - Yep at day 2 you're in a rough spot (especially if this one of your first fasts). IF you cant hang on maybe try a fresh squeezed juice or broth. Fasting can be ROUGH and leave you with very little physical or mental energy. Today I feel fine but yesterday even my thinking was fuzzy and I found it hard to concentrate. Sounds like that's where you're at. If you can try not to eat for another day and drink some chicken broth or fruit juice. It might be enough to help you make it through this rough patch. The first 3 days is when your body releases a load of toxins that dirty your blood and make you feel miserable.
fasting,3cm71c,BlackOpz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:20:36 2015 UTC,That's awesome dude! Keep it up!  How often do you fast?   Yea I always tell myself to be prepared for days 2-4 but damn it is much harder while going through them. I've looked a lot into fasting every other day.  I just started getting a little dizzy too but im sure that'll go away soon.  Edit: forgot to ask a question. Wouldn't the chicken broth/ fruit juice break my fast?
fasting,3cm71c,BlackOpz,2,Thu Jul 9 04:39:41 2015 UTC,Yea the broth would break the fast but if that 'hits the spot' for you then you could slip back into fasting with minimal damage to your final results even though it would re-awaken your stomach and start the cycle over again from scratch (the bad news). At least it would be an attempt to try to hang on without actually eating since solid food will fully reawaken your stomach. I typically fast 2-3 times per year of varying lengths. I try to do at least one 2-3 week fast and maybe a couple 1-2 week fasts generally at the begin or end of  the year and one in the middle (like now).  Also in the 2-3 days before the fast if you cut back on junk and reduce your food intake to small healthy meals the first 3 day detox goes a LOT smoother. I used to binge before fasts but all it does is load you up with toxins that make those first 3 days MISERABLE. I basically only eat once a day (with a late nite snack. usually yogurt) and I even cut the size of those meals down going into a fast. Its really helps.

fasting,3cepys,jadelw27,2,Tue Jul 7 10:08:14 2015 UTC,"Hey. First off, I know exactly where you're coming from, and it's not easy, at all. In my household, my father verbally abuses everyone and it's 1% from become physical too. Everyone shouts, nobody talks. Yelling, negativity, putting someone else down, you name it. My brothers are adopting this type of behaviour and my mum has become kind of depressed because of this. It affects everyone, even the dog feels the vibes.   My advice? Don't tell anyone your plans or your goals or dreams. They'll try to kill it, even subconsciously. If you want to fast, do it. And more: create a bubble around you, a meditation bubble, where you will allow NOBODY to bother you. Whatever they might throw at you, you won't allow it to affect you. Ghandi followed this type of thought, read up on his fasting techniques and his strength to overcome everyone that was against him. It's tough, I won't lie. But it's not impossible. And once you're fasting for many days, you can tell yourself it's like a superpower, you can do it better than them, right? :) Don't let them get to you, focus on YOU and YOUR goals. Sometimes household issues die down after a while. Be patient, try and help out (if that's possible) and don't let them get at you, things will turn out ok in the end, they usually do.

That's how much your body uses a day to function while being completely sedentary (basically if you were in a coma). 1 gram of fat = 37 kj. So if you eat 0, then you can lose 210 grams of fat a day. That's 0.46 pounds a day. So that's half a pound a day. However that is only when you don't move at all. You could bring that number up just by getting out of bed.  So in 30 days you could lose 14 pounds of fat if you are in a coma and therefore exerted no energy. You could almost double that by being active.  However, you will notice a bigger drop because not only will you lose fat, but you will lose muscle mass and you will lose waste and fluid weight."
fasting,3ccr4q,lunarbridge,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:20:38 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry I'm bad at calculating this, would you mind doing it for me?   Not moving, I'd lose 0.46 lbs a day. If I get 500 calories from eating peanut butter for 50 grams of protein to try to maintain some muscle mass, but burn 600 from small workouts, what would be the results?  body data for reference Male. 18 y/o. 6'0. 174lbs. Thank you so much."
fasting,3ccr4q,puddlejumper,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:20:11 2015 UTC,"So you're eating 500 calories but burning 600?  Means you can add 100 calories to your BMR, which takes it up to 1950 calories a day to maintain.  That takes the amount of weight you can lose a day to 220g a day which is 0.48 pounds a day. It's a very small difference. It's the difference between eating a slice of bread or not. It may have an effect that I can't calculate though, and that is that it may help prevent your BMR lowering as much as your weight starts decreasing substantially."
fasting,3ccr4q,BlackOpz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:36:46 2015 UTC,I'd estimate anywhere from 20-30 lbs of fast depending on your body. You can keep about 60%-75% of the total weight loss from pure fat after the water comes backing into your body with the carbs. Also you wont lose a TON of muscle. After the first week protein need taper down to about 20g per day. So you will lose some but its not extreme.  During my last 3 week fast I lost muscle but it wasnt very noticeable.  https://dorothysager.wordpress.com/2012/10/05/am-i-losing-muscle-during-a-water-fast/ http://www.leanhigh.com/weight-loss/diet-reviews/fasting-for-weight-loss-how-much-muscle-will-you-lose

You ended your fast as this was happening and its just waking up again. No biggie. It takes about 10 days to 14 days for your body to clear junk in your intestines. You havent reached that stage. Your stomach is just re-activating (plus bowel movements are stuff you ate about 3 days ago so you're just reactivating and pushing out your last meals from 3 days ago).  http://www.allaboutfasting.com/breaking-a-fast.html

However, I have an exam to study for until the end of this month which is adding stress... therefore I'm thinking of doing a proper fast afterwards, HOPEFULLY 5 days. If I can make it I'll see if I can extend to 7 days, then who knows, maybe 10 days!  Definitely want to do this 1 or twice a year, it seems so beneficial and medicinal.

What I want most is to feel normal - I want to be able to walk around and be physical without forcing myself to put one foot in front of the other. Do you know whether this will happen?  What I've understood from my research is that consuming anything hinders the fasting process.

fasting,3c94nq,BlackOpz,3,Mon Jul 6 03:25:29 2015 UTC,"Google this: ""phinney volek sodium magnesium"" to understand why you might want to consider sodium/magnesium/potassium while fasting.   You are detoxifying plenty by fasting, but you are also losing minerals needed by the body.  Here's what one of those Google results says: ""As you start dumping water, you'll lose minerals such as salt, potassium and magnesium as well. Having lower levels of these minerals will make you very, very tired, lightheaded or dizzy, give you muscle cramps, and headaches. This is one of the most common of the low carb diet side effects, and it can be avoided for the most part by making sure you get enough replacement minerals.""  Yes, that's about low carb keto, but the same effects are induced by fasting, even more so."
fasting,3c94nq,geeyore,-1,Tue Jul 7 19:32:39 2015 UTC,"Of course you're losing minerals but your body will start eating tumors, abscesses, etc to get them:   ""When fasting the body not only begins to break down adipose tissues for fuel, it also begins to leach out minerals. The first places called upon to release mineral deposits are extraneous tissues like abscesses, fungal growths, and deposits in joints. This is one reason that many people get relief from arthritic conditions during a fast. The body also breaks down fatty deposits in blood vessels, along nerve paths, and on the outside of organs. This helps reduce inflammation in the body. I don't understand the whole process of reducing inflammation, but it is supposed to be one of the great benefits of water only fasting. If supplements are taken, then the body will not catabolize accumulated wastes and unnecessary tissues for their mineral content and the body will not experience the same healing potential"""
fasting,3c94nq,BlackOpz,3,Tue Jul 7 20:51:18 2015 UTC,Which research or book does that come from?
fasting,3c94nq,geeyore,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:07:50 2015 UTC,"another source but they all basically cite the same info. This once cites the MD and his book. MANY sources and diff MD's say the exact same: Googling ""water fasting abscess tumors"" bring up tons of data on this:   http://www.soilandhealth.org/02/0201hyglibcat/020127shelton.iii/020127.ch5.htm ""Autodigestion during fasting   During fasting, your body will ""autolyze"", or self-digest, its most inferior and impure materials and metabolic wastes, including: fat deposits, abcesses, dead and dying cells, bumps and protuberances, damaged tissue, calluses, furuncles (small skin abscesses, or boils), morbid accumulations, growths, and amazingly, various kinds of neoplasms (abnormal growths of tissue, or tumors). In ""Fasting and eating for health"", Joel Fuhrman, M.D., notes, p. 10: ""The fast does not merely detoxify; it also breaks down superfluous tissue - fat, abnormal cells, atheromatous plaque, and tumors--and releases diseased tissues and their cellular products into the circulation for elimination. Toxic or unwanted materials circulate in our bloodstream and lymphatic tissues, and are deposited in and released from our fat stores and other tissues. An important element of fasting detoxification is mobilizing the toxins from their storage areas."" New cell growth during fasting is stimulated and accelerated as the required proteins are re-synthesized from decomposed cells (during autolysis). Thus, your serum albumin reading - blood-protein level - remains constant and normal throughout your fast, as your body very smartly uses protein and other stored nutrients where needed. Again, Germany's late Otto Buchinger, M.D., after supervising over 100,000 juice-fasts, eventually concluded what is clearly stated in the book, ""Fasting: the Buchinger Method"", page 22: ""The need for protein diminishes during the fast, until in the second week, it has been reduced from 100 grams to from 15-20 grams a day, and this amount is, in fact, quite sufficient while fasting."""

fasting,3c94nq,BlackOpz,0,Tue Jul 7 19:43:56 2015 UTC,This is a Water Fasting THREAD!! If you eat ANYTHING that spurs digestion you're not Water Fasting since the point of WF is to 'turn-off' the stomach. If you're not digesting the vitamins then theres no point since they would just sit in the stomach. Of course your body digests them and diverts energy from healing/detox to do it. The OP is trying to do a pure water fast. They have concerns and I have experience water fasting and can relate to what they may be feeling. Just giving my informed 2 cents.   Of course you will get GREAT benefits from such a program and if I were to do an extended fast (30+ days). I would prob break it every month or two and do a nice healthy refeed for a week but I agree at some point you have to get nutrients into your body. For most people its not a critical issue until they're well past 30 days on a water fast.
fasting,3c94nq,geeyore,3,Tue Jul 7 20:57:16 2015 UTC,"Points taken. With one exception. Adding minerals, vitamins, and bullion (for salt) to a fast does not make it a ""low-cal diet."" That's simply ludicrous. The minerals keep one from being depleted, which is what the OP describes."

I've tried most fasting variations (binging before, exercise during, distilled water, filterwater, tap, breaking with bad foods, good foods, etc.) I've noticed differences in each approach and have refined MY approach. Water type is one for me that made no difference in results.

fasting,3c748k,BlackOpz,2,Mon Jul 6 05:16:10 2015 UTC,First 3 days are the hardest. You cells start to release the crap that they stored when your liver and kidneys were overwhelmed by toxins (similar to how your body stores excess calories in fat). The flood of crap in your bloodstream is what makes you feel 'off' and is possibly giving you headaches. Energy raises and lowers during the fast.  Its actually an ilusion though. Your body stores energy then just as quickly depletes for its own purposes. So some days you'll feel good but dont think its time to run a race. Just sit on it and allow your internal system to use that energy for detox and healing. I just started a 7 day at midnite.

fasting,3c105v,areich,3,Fri Jul 3 19:47:38 2015 UTC,"I just completed five days of the fat mimicking diet.  The claims they make about slowing aging, etc. similar to real fasting are probably a lot of hooey, but it was neat to restrict calories so severely for five days.  It's real tricky to get the proportions of protein, carbohydrates and fats just right and keep the calories at the right level.  I made a spreadsheet of a handful of simple foods I have on hand and tweaked the amounts of everything each day until the numbers were right.  Weighing everything eaten is essential.  I like to drink, but there is no way to fit alcohol into the diet.  I'm no vegetarian, but found a vegetarian approach easiest.  Fats from olive oil on salad, nuts and whole milk.  Anyway, the fast mimicking diet was a fun challenge.  It's good to take a break from bad food habits, and if it actually does what they say it does, then all the better.  I plan on doing it again in a week.  It should be easier the second time around."

Then I changed my eating and did the whole /r/keto thing and that changed everything. Are you familiar? Because if you 'fat adapt' it's a breeze. Fasting from a standard american diet is kind of miserable as your bodies crying out for sugar, but when keto adapted it's a smooth transition into both fat loss and fasting.  If I can fast anybody can. Keto's the secret."
fasting,3bzwnf,istara,3,Fri Jul 3 22:31:49 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I was thinking! However I'm having a hard time just staying away from sugary carby foods (I'm not kididng, this literally is the worst addiction for me, no tabacco or drugs compare, for me, to sugar). I was thinking of eating keto when I am on non-fast days. Fasting should kickstart me into ketosis, right? I could transition slowly, but I'm far more susceptible to failing straight up on sugar than if I go hardcore and fast first."
fasting,3bzwnf,ALexusOhHaiNyan,2,Fri Jul 3 23:12:53 2015 UTC,"Ehhh.   Keto is like a detox from sugar. Craving? Eat fat. Still craving. I just said eat, more, fat. I eat a slice of butter or spoon of coconut oil without blinking. Definitely start your day with bullet proof coffee.   Look. At the end of the day you obviously need to detox off sugar. And that's not going to be easy. My friend who does those lap band surgeries for obesity maintains it may be as long as 8 months that your body is trying to regain weight loss. So this isn't going to be easy. But   Right now you need to switch your priorities - master keto first, then fast as a stall breaker - perhaps PSMF instead as your body goes into crisis mode and hangs onto fat stubbornly. I suggest you read the FAQ and top comments at /r/keto :   You might experience 'keto flu' at first days, PISS (Post Induction Stall) weeks later, make sure to take enough electrolytes (Magnesium), fat comes first, and again - read FAQ to avoid other rookie mistakes. Then once your inducted, fast. You could even try a PSMF (Protein Sparing Moderated Fast) that body builders do right before competition. Ie; No carb, fats, and only a little protein, and some filling (fat free) veg to shed fat and maintain muscle. And then fast.   But Keto's not as easy as flipping a switch. It may take as much as two weeks to do so. But I can assure you that sugar cravings will go away and it will be an eye opening experience. You've got to be patient with this and inform yourself better before doing so.   The brain reacts to sugar similar to cocaine. So I empathize. Once we all get on the same page with that the sugar industry is going to catch hell. They've already hired the exact same firms that represented Big Tobacco in the 80's because they know a war's coming to them."

I might do as you suggest, thanks! I am familiar with keto and did 2 successful months of keto, but somehow I fell off the wagon and spiralled into this sugar cycle again... Not trying to justify it, but a combination of school stress, parent stress, some really bad personal stress and exams didn't help at all.  It's so hard to kill these cravings again seeing as now I'm at home for the summer with my family, who ALWAYS have sugary cereals, bread and always make desserts with sugar. I skip that whenever I can, but always, ALWAYS, after a couple of days, I cave and have some. That's why I thought a good body shock and sugar detox, such as a fast which I admit is drastic, would kickstart the whole process. I'm planning to adopt keto for life, really. Or at least, no sugar low carb.  And I can't wait for the storm that's coming to the sugar industry."
fasting,3bzwnf,istara,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:48:22 2015 UTC,"Ah. Pardon the assumption as I didn't know wether or not you had done Atkins/Keto before.  Also, I know that feel. You're in the god damn lions den and I certainly know how that sucks. After a year of politely declining my sisters baked goods and desserts that she would leave for my ill Dad and I - I eventually lost it and started screaming at her to stop. Finally she paid attention.   Anyways. I'm not sure what to tell you. My two (or seven) bits is this :  Until you can be free of the sugar shack just try to eat Low Glycemic until then and prioritize your cheats. Personally I can't remember the last time I ate a chip, etc for a snack - it's all almonds, nuts, salami, etc. Eat sugar the least, then refined flour. Want a sandwich? Rye bread if you must. I would avoid sugary cereal and soda like the plague of course. But there's also some evidence that keto has a honeymoon factor. If your going to lose the weight - do it hard, do it proper, and don't look back or you'll gain it back. Apparently it only works once or twice before your body starts getting wise to your trick.    Get cookin'. Because you'll need when your on your own and you can start introducing your own foods to have around now. How much easier is it to resist the sugar when you have sugar free alternatives?   Lastly when you cheat? Don't binge. Eat mindfully and slowly. After two savored, thoughtful bites what else is there to know about something you ate? After that try a 'fat bomb' of good butter like Plugra or Coconut Oil to calm you down.  But I know it's hard. And you don't have a unique problem with sugar - we all do. The problem is - we're surrounded by it at school, work, play, and worst of all home. So much so it makes you want to scream. Wait a tick, I did. It's a cinch when you live on your own - just don't buy anything carby. Done.   Anyways. For what it's worth. You might try getting someone in your family to read Why We Get Fat by Gary Taubes. It's impossible to make it through that book without thinking differently about what we're told is healthy, and it's easy to read.  Your in a difficult position. Too surrounded by sugar to really do keto effectively. And if you did you might risk the chance of squandering ketos effectiveness via the honeymoon weight loss that comes with the initial try. You might be young enough that exercise would help. But the reason I would be careful about fasting with your diet is this.   After a sugar binge is the last place you want to fast. It can lead to something called Reactive Hypoglycemia. Your blood sugar drops so violently your body goes into crisis mode. I did it once and felt crazy.   Tl;DR For now I'd recommend Low Glycemic diet - which will most likely become the new governmental guideline of the future. And intermittent fasting Ie; Eat within a certain window of the day - dinner's easiest. You may be young enough that you can lose weight with just that and some sprinting exercises."

I'm going to take up intermittent fasting with just dinner each day, it seems the most socially accepted and easiest.  Seeing as I'm at home, there are many high carb sugary things (such as cereal that my brothers eat, and many other junk foods) but my mum does keep high fibre and some low-carb options. I guess if I just stick to the low-glycemic options, after a while it should be easier and become a habit (I hope so anyhow).

I had a similar issue to you, and flavoured carbonated water proved to be a godsend until I trained myself not to succumb to the last minute binge fest.  For what it's worth, I do intermittent fasting (day off/on); you may want to start with that too before you go for a 3 day fast. In my experience, if you're trying to get rid of stubborn fat without fully addressing the root of your cravings, you may find yourself making 3 days and then you'll most likely just binge once you start eating again. Except it will be worse because your metabolism will be slow as hell. I actually got fatter when I fasted for 3 days, whereas intermittent fasting helped me get cut more than anything."

I've practiced meditation for the last few years and have noticed that physical states like hunger or tiredness are really temporary waves or states that arise and vanish and don't really leave a trace ie they're quite illusory and bullshit really. You can be super awake half an hour later as you said, if you simply ride out 'tiredness' - You were never tired to begin with, it's not some permanent state that needs alleviating or needs some response, you don't need to respond and you can see it disappear. Same with depression, happiness, whatever - mental states are obviously a lot trickier than physical, but they have the same characteristics in my opinon - it's just a matter of training yourself with the adequate tools so that you remember these words at the right time and apply them to your experience 'oh yeah, this will pass'   If you can be super hungry one minute, and then an hour later there is no hunger and you didn't eat - what then was the hunger? it really does feel like bullshit, like a trick your body uses.

Don't make excuses for one bite because something is delicious (isn't the not giving into what we want right then and there one of the points of fasting?) BUT don't beat yourself up over it either. Great thing about the short term nature of fasting is you can restart easily.   Try again and don't allow yourself ANY food (otherwise you're just being extremely calorie restrictive but not fasting). Given that you are doing a longer fast you may want to give your body a couple days to recover before jumping back in.   *edit: I should clarify that I'm not being critical that you didn't last ""x"" amount of time - how long you fast is up to you.

When fasting there's no such thing as 1 bite.  4 days into a fast anything you taste will BLOW YOUR MIND with how good it tastes. Usually this starts of a chain reaction of 'small' bites until you've eaten so much that you say forget it and throw in the towel. I'll be breaking my 7 day fast Monday and know everything I'll be eating for the next couple days. (Yogurt, Watermelon, Grapes, Boiled Vegetable Broths)  I also second the advice to wait a few days.

If you need the minty flavor or some kind of refreshing scent/taste add a few drops of essential oil mint or something. It's like $12 and it goes a long way. I just wanted to recommend this because it's been two years since I've used regular tooth paste and my teeth actually don't hurt anymore when I drink something cold, which was kind of really frustrating. haha, mostly use baking soda and oil pulling with cold pressed coconut oil.

It is ""cheating"" to take a multivitamin while fasting? I wanna have my body switch energy burning modes, but I don't wanna suffer from vitamin deficiencies, or will my body get its vitamins from the stored glucose and fat?"
fasting,3bi0tm,ThainDC,3,Tue Jun 30 17:24:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, after reading many articles over a long time, and unless you're doing a REALLY LONG FAST (which I wouldn't recommend since you're doing it the first time, maximum should be 5-7 days I guess), you don't really need a multivitamin. Actually, if you're taking a multiv. which dissolves in water, it most likely has dextrose in it which is sweet and going to unleash the cravings monster. I suggest you set a certain amount of time, not ""as long as I can go"" because there WILL be a point where you go ""ah fuck it, I went X amount of time, I can break whenever I want"" but if you have set to 3 days, which is a good amount, then you'll be much more satisfied AND reap the benefits. Don't worry about anything! Just drink lots of water, as much as you need, and occupy yourself :) Good luck!"
fasting,3bi0tm,ThainDC,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:09:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for replying! I will definitely limit this first fast to maybe 4 to 5 days. I also had a question of what to eat after a fast. Do I go back to eating a calorie deficient diet of 1400 again as usual, or do I slowly build back up to it? Watch my carb intake, fat intake, etc...?"
fasting,3bi0tm,ThainDC,2,Tue Jun 30 18:23:16 2015 UTC,"First off, I'm not an experienced faster, but I HAVE read a LOT about this, so I do know a few things! What I'm trying to say is, whatever I reply, it might not be all 100%, I'm just going by all the info I've read over time! Anyhow, as far as I know, refeeding is almost more important than the fast itself. Many people recommend refeeding slowly almost as many days as you fasted. What one should consume is usually something very ""light"" for your gut, such as steamed vegetables, pureed vegetables, some watery fruit such as melons and very little, like the size of your fist, eating small amounts every 2h and building it up over a few days. The first meals are the most important since what you want to do is repopulate your gut bacteria with good stuff, so some natural greek yoghurt is also a good choice. I'll warn you that it's REALLY HARD to not gorge on junk food or massive amounts of carbs as soon as you start eating, but it is actually, personally, the hardest part of the fast, refeeding! If you can master that, then you will benefit 100%. Many people fail to do this and binge on junk food, which basically just erases any progress you might have made during the fast (my opinion again).  Personally, I will break my fast with maybe some greek yoghurt and then some sauerkraut, both excellent foods for your gut bacteria. Then everyday I will add some more food until I build up to my TDEE value. I also am staying away from sugar and going as low carb as possible, as sugar is basically just a drug and a culprit to many maladies (just check out /r/keto for more info on that). Good luck!!!"

The only I recommend is always eat after the workout, is when you can eat a lot of carbs and your body actually need it. After that, you can fast all that you want.

fasting,3b2utx,Deforges,3,Thu Jun 25 14:56:53 2015 UTC,I think that 1 day of eating would make it very hard to get back onto the fast and probably be harder than fasting straight through. The deal is once you are past day 3 or 4 it's easy not to eat. For me the urge to eat came back around day 15 but some last until day 30 or longer. It depends on how much fat stores you have. If you are overweight it will be the easiest weight loss of your life if you can make it past the first few days.   I've posted several threads of the fasts I've done (longest is 15 days) and everyone of them has been rewarding. I was more fat than I needed to be and the process of fasting helps me regain control of my will power and it really does make you feel great. The 15 day fast I did was an experience that I will not ever forget for good reasons. Not many people can handle a 3 or 4 day fast much less 15 days so if you get past 4 days you will be in rare company. Good luck!

Each pound of fat is around 3500 calories meaning he actually only lost about 6 pounds of fat and the rest being water weight.  The keto-diet is well known to make you shed a whole lotta water weight since your liver doesnt store any glycogen that holds on the aforementioned water, when you're in a ketogenic state.  He'd maybe gain a little since protein does in fact retain a little bit of water, while fat holds none."

fasting,3ayl2f,taxallfats,2,Wed Jun 24 20:08:49 2015 UTC,"Very possibly and I am totally ready for that to happen.  As I said, I was not looking to the fast itself as a source of weightloss but rather a mental jumpstart into Keto...which will be my source of longterm and reasonable weightloss.  However, Keto is basically no carbs (less than 25g carbs/day or so).  Eating carbs is a big reason we retain so much water.  Carbs and sodium.  When you first go on Keto (even without fasting), you actually shed a ton of water weight just like you do when you are fasting.  This is actually one of the reasons that low carb diets often appear to do so much better than other diets.  There is a lot less water retention in low carb diets.  So while I am fine with gaining back some of that water weight, I actually think that I won't gain much of it back because I am going right into Keto dieting.  Hope that makes sense."

But I've upped my water in fasting to about 4-6 liters per day (that includes some bullion and coffee). Down about 4 pounds in 4 days, kind of what I expected.   But I don't think it's water weight at all, since after a lengthy keto regime there isn't much more water weight to lose. Pretty sure my inputs are equaling my outputs (i.e. trips to the restroom).  For someone going directly from normal-carb or high-carb nutrition (150 to 250 or more grams/day) I'm sure the water loss would be fairly impressive over the first few days of fasting, just as it is with keto."

A cup of bullion morning, afternoon, and evening with some added Morton's ""lite"" salt has been helpful (Morton's ""lite"" is 50 percent potassium chloride, an electrolyte like sodium). It's prudent to include added salt and potassium (as above) due to electrolyte depletion, which causes headaches and maybe some other annoying things. And lots of water (I'm doing 4 to 6 liters).  I don't plan to go to 30 days as for me this is just an experiment to discover whether fasting will break a keto stall. That seems to be happening.

It does include 1 day of fasting but it focuses more on changing up calorie allotment per day to keep your metabolism boosted. I adjusted mine (on day 3) to where the max amount of calories is 1000 and it goes down from there. I am also keeping the fasting day once a week.  Personally, I've gone from 161 to 150 in 2 weeks (5'4 F) just by cutting down to 1000 cals per day on MyFitnessPal and doing C25K weeks of running back to back.

fasting,3ax5k8,diamond_sourpatchkid,2,Wed Jun 24 05:28:30 2015 UTC,"To me personally fasting means abstaining from any thing that our bodies can take nutrition from. 500 cal a day isn't really fasting since your body might not even deplete its glycogen stores in the liver, which is the first stage of fasting. This happens within the 24 hour mark."
fasting,3ax5k8,cherokeee,2,Wed Jun 24 11:39:50 2015 UTC,"My rudimentary understanding is that actual water fasting induces the following metabolic processes over the first several days to a week:   Increased epiniphrene and norepiniphrene (adrenaline) Increased human growth hormone (HGH) Decreased insulin Ketosis   All of these are natural human adaptation processes that are invoked through fasting, and transition the metabolism from using food as a source of energy, to using stored body fat. These are natural processes developed through the evolution of homo sapiens.  To my understanding there are several issues with the 500-calorie non-fasting diet:  1) The production of ""adrenaline"" and HGH will be impeded if not entirely eliminated because of those 500 calories. Both hormones provide some extra metabolic energy during fasting, although it's much more complicated and sophisticated than that.  2) If the 500 calories are carbohydrate (125 grams, approx. 5 ounces), there also will not be much (if any) ketosis. Your body will burn all of those carbs prior to stored body fat.  You could probably get the benefits of ketosis if you spend your 500 calories on 1/2 stick (2 ounces, 55 grams) of butter per day, but it doesn't really sound appetizing or like ""fasting,"" does it?"

Differences between both over 1 day would be very minor but extend the time and WAMMMO Fasting pulls ahead as the smarter choice. #1 because after 3 days you lose hunger and fasting becomes healthier and easier than 'extreme dieting' where you'll be hungry all the time.

As you get cleaner and in subsequent fasts this diminishes as there's less garbage to clean up. (now I dont even get headaches in the first couple days anymore).

fasting,3avex4,WillyToulouse,4,Wed Jun 24 01:52:56 2015 UTC,"Ok I will start. First thing you have to know is your kcal intake to maintain your current weight.  TDEE Calculator  This is just an estimate, so I always reccomend to use sedentary and start there.  After this you have to know that there are 4 basic macronutrients.  -carbohidrates:4kcal  In this category there are also fiber which are soluble and insoluble.  -Soluble fiber attract water and form a gel slowing down digestion which means that helps you feel full. Some sources are: Oats,apples,cucumbers,celery....  -Insoluble fiber have a laxative effect and these fibers do not dissolve in water,  and speed up the passage of food and waste through your gut. Some sources are:whole wheat, whole grains, seeds, nuts, barley, couscous, brown rice, zucchini, celery, broccoli, cabbage, tomatoes, carrots,dark leafy vegetables, raisins, grapes...  -Protein:4kcal This are fundamental for maintaining and building muscle. There are many studies but 0.82g/lb is the upper limit for a better body composition. Some argues that even .64 g/lb is sufficient. There are complete and incomplete protein, but you do not have to worry about that.  -Fat:9kcal There is no absolute guideline of how much fat is good in your diet. Typical values are seen as .4 g/lb as minimum, while others say .3 g/lb. Fat is also beneficial because it can slow digestion and makes you feel full longer. There are many kinds of fat.  Trans fat:fried food.  Avoid this since can increase LDL  Saturated fat:Red meat This is not bad and is fundamental for correct hormones production. So is cholesterol.  Monounsaturated fat:This is the one found in many vegetable oils. This can improve blood cholesterol levels and blood sugar control.  Polyunsaturated fat:this essential fatty acids since your body cannot produce them and has to get them from other sources. Omega-6:Found in nuts and vegetable oils Omega-3:Found in fatty fish like salmon or  What really matters is their ratio which should be In a perfect world, this ratio should be about 2:1 for optimal health and function, in reality this ratio is difficult to reach.  -Alcohol:7kcal This is a different type of macronutrient since your body sees it as a toxine and so it will suspend other activities in order to expel it.  Once you know your tdee you know how much you have to eat to maintain the same weight.  To lose weight you have to eat less than your tdee.  In a pound of fat there are 3500 kcal, so eating 500 kcal less every day in a week will give you 1 pound of fatloss. Incorporate weight lifting to minimize muscle loss.  To gain weight, eat at a surplus. Since it's easier to lose fat than gain muscle, when trying to gain weight go slower. 0.5 lb a week will give you 50:50 muscle/fat gain. 0.25 lb a week will give you a better muscle/fat gain. So the slower the better. If you do not lift weights >90% of your gain are going to be just fat.  When you start fasting you are going to lose 5-10 pounds in a week or even in a smaller timeframe. That is mostly water since 1 g of carbs retains 3-4 grams of water, so do not freak out if after start eating again you put on 10 lbs in a few days, it's just water since as I explained earlier you will not be in a kcal surplus unless you pig out every day after stop fasting."

It's funny how humans, instinctively through religious and pagan rituals, knew we had to fast to remain in optimal health. We lost that somewhere along the way.My guess is the McDonaldization of the world.  The greatest benefit of fasting is the amount of neuronal autophagy that occurs."

It's only when you actually food restrict in some way that you realise how much your life (mine anyway) is built around the pleasure and variety of food.  If I can give any advice, it's to develop slightly fussy and discerning tastes (which fasting may help with as it resets your sweet tooth a bit and clears up your tastebuds).  Craving an expensive bar of chocolate, that you only eat 100g of, rather than cheap candy that you eat by the pound/kilo, is really helpful. It really cuts down your eating if you actively want high quality treats and get no pleasure from cheap junk."

The migraines were terrible. Dealing with the unpleasant side effects towards the start of a fast is bad enough on its own, withdrawal symptoms on top of that can be a real challenge.  I suggest quitting the cigs and alcohol about a week before starting a fast, so that the withdrawal symptoms are past their peak. You'll want to talk to a doctor, though, especially about tapering off alcohol. Those withdrawals can be dangerous because you can have seizures.  All that said, I definitely recommend a fast to help cleanse your body and eliminate these cravings. I just think doing it all at once will really put you through the wringer."

Just weight myself. 202.5 lbs. Lots of junk getting flushed out I am sure. I am hungry, but nothing crazy. Mainly kind of bored, especially at work. Getting lunch was a great way to break up the day and with that gone it is just lone and tiresome. I find myself drinking a lot of different tea's simply to have a different taste in my mouth.  I am going to do this for at least three days. I have business event I am going to on Thursday and I will have a drink or two, thereby technically ending my fast, but I might continue to not eat until the weekend.   I definitely like the idea of intermittent fasting and think I will incorporate this into my normal routine. For me it is about the self control and losing some weight. Not a fat guy by any means, but deff want to bring things under control."

fasting,39u15b,Notathrowaway211,-2,Sun Jun 14 21:05:18 2015 UTC,You should look up the definition of a fast.
fasting,39u15b,sanshinron,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:14:32 2015 UTC,"Definitions are changed, because religions require people to fasting, and most are mentally weak and cheat. Muslims are supposed to fast during Ramadan, but they changed the rules so that they can eat at night, so they wake up before down and stuff themselves with large amounts of food. Christians are supposed to fast, but they changed the rules and now they only don't eat meat during fast. This has no basis in old teachings and more importantly it's not considered fasting from medical standpoint. You will not get the health benefits of fasting when consuming so many calories. ""Sustained fasting""... Sounds like you're lying to yourself. But I applaud you for trying. Real fasting is really not that hard and I encourage you to try it."

If you intend to fast for more than a day or two, you might want to consider limiting the number of carbs you eat in the days leading up to the fast. This would allow you to enter into a state of ketosis more easily. You could replace the Shreddies with something like psyllium husks. Check out /r/keto if you want more info."

I had some broth and apple cider this morning.  I understand what you guys are saying, that juice fasting is not real fasting, especially the way I am doing it with the occasional glass of wine or a smoothie, and I am violating the purity of ""the fast"", which is meant to cleanse and heal body and soul and raise one to a heightened spiritual awareness. I would counter with, there is more than one way to do it and I'm doing it my way like Frank  Sinatra, this forum isn't that busy with only a few posts per day, I am actually ""in the game"" playing and you all are on the sideline critiquing my form.  And this is actually working for me. I've lost 6 lbs so far.  It's 100 times easier doing it this way than a strict water fast. So I will keep doing it a few more days."

You may as well ditch the juice and have a Mars Bar for the same calories.    which is meant to cleanse and heal body and soul and raise one to a heightened spiritual awareness   I'm not someone who believes this kind of shit with any diet.

I broke the fast with salad, spinach, baby bok choy and sugar snap peas. Hopefully I will develop some better eating habits.  This was a useful experiment and I hope to repeat it about once a month.

You at least want to be consuming protein in the postworkout period and fats are generally a good idea (from animal tissue). I have been following a schedule that looks like this:  M/W/F/Sun:   -Wake up, pound breakfast, high carb most important, some protein content and fat content of secondary but still meaningful importance  -Continue with my day. Have another meal similar to breakfast. Eat to appetite  -Resistance training in the afternoon  -Carbless post workout. High protein of critical importance, low carb fibrous green vegetables fine although not technically carbless  Tu/Th/Sat  Fast upon awakening until the following day when I wake up. Perhaps 30-45 minutes of low intensity steady state cardio. Ends up being about 30-36 hours fasted depending on when I stop eating the day before and when I wake up for breakfast. Nice to prepare meals on the fasted day for easier consumption on feast day.  Nice toggle for health, insulin sensitivity, longevity, retaining muscle and strength. Not a true ADF since I like the weekly schedule and training 4 days a week but still retaining benefits from the Sunday carbless postworkout."

It's another tool among many effective strategies.   One important caveat about this experiment is that it wasn't a randomized trial or anything like that.

An increase in HR is by no means unusual and any shaking or nervousness you experience is usually a result of the withdrawal from stimulants such as coffee, tea, condiments or alcohol. It may also be caused by the release of these stimulants/toxins into the bloodstream during your fast.  Remember that throughout your fast your circulation system is an integral part to the breaking down and removal (via ketones) of fats and other stores. Additionally, the release of old toxins back into the bloodstream can cause similar effects to the ones they had when you first ingested them. Caffeine is a perfect example. It could well be a combination of the caffeine and the increased need for toxins to be released through the blood that is causing your heart to work harder. You may also experience headaches etc if you are susceptible to them, but all abnormalities will pass once everything has moved out of your system."

You have to go into it feeling 100% confident, because that confidence will only go in one direction while fasting. I am lucky enough to be in a situation where I don't have to work for a few months so I am spending this time with family and friends.  I won't be staying in one place for the whole fast, but will be travelling quite a bit.  Whenever I hear of people who say they're going to work and live their everyday lives while fasting... that's more than I would be able to.

Seeing 90% health left feels a whole lot better than 10% damage done. Even further 10%health left is much more re energizing than 90% damage done.   5 days of 60 done? How about 55 days left instead of 56 days left. Seeing that number get smaller everyday will be like slaying a dragon when it's all said and done.

And if I try to take a warm shower during that time I feel like I'm going to pass out...  I actually just remembered that I blacked out for a second one time and hit my head on the bathroom counter.

No way!"" please remember that statistically most of us have some kind of parasitic bacteria in our gut. It is possible that when you stop eating they release toxins to force you into eating. You can and you should do a fast, but before you do, start with plant-based detoxifing diet, slowly reduce calories over the course of a 7-10 days, and during that time take some herbal medicine to kill parasites or even a normal medicine. Also, go to sauna. When you start a fast, take laxatives to speed up emptying of the digestion tract. GLHF :D"

Take one tab and split it into about 4-5 bits throughout the day. Caffined versions may help. I wouldn't suggest taking it all at once - you'll pee it out (hence luminous yellow vitamin pee).   You might find as well that diet drinks help you. They contain phetamyline (might have mispelt that) as an artificial sweatener which helps with mood, and the sodium content will help replenish electrolytes."

Something that used to help but is a little hard in that state is like a stomach massage, lightly, to sort of move stuff around in there, or wherever it feels uncomfortable. I don't know if it was just concentrating on that that made the nauseousness less noticeable, or if it actually did something.. but thankfully i was able to get back to work those times. sometimes moving art all just makes it worse.

I was also a religious studies major and full admission someone who was never able to complete a religious fast.

Mostly I'm intrigued by how I've been able to be hungry, not staving but just mildly hungry for the first time in my life. I'm actually embarrassed about my past excuses and failures during religious fasting now.   Thanks for engaging in a dialogue about the spiritual side of fasting. I know lots of people want to shy away from mixing religion with anything, but I've always had a profound mind, body, soul vision of my health.

fasting,38c06q,YoRaps,3,Sun Jun 7 19:37:14 2015 UTC,"It would be good to practice short bursts of fasting beforehand to get your body and mind ready for it. It could be as simple as skipping breakfast or not having that late night snack. Push that hungry feeling for like an hour more than usual so you're accustomed to it. Reduce your portion sizes so you're not jumping into it with a stomach that likes being too full. It usually makes the hunger worse.  Have something low GI before your fast to keep your energy higher longer.  The hard bit is overcoming the first wave of hunger that's really strong but once you pass it, the hunger will be there but won't be as annoying. Just keep busy and drink lots of water whenever you're hungry. There might be a few more waves even in that short period but they get easier.  Concentration/mental acuity levels vary person-to-person and can range from your brain is on way too many drugs to you've just achieved Nirvana. There's no way to tell other than to actually try it. Take one thing at a time. People around you will usually give you concessions knowing you're doing the fast so don't worry too much.  Listen to your body and don't ignore the physical signs of pain or if you're fainting and it's interfering in life.  Good luck on the 40-Hour Famine!  Also, you're allowed to have sugar and basic food in small portions like rice. It might be good to have some if you've never fasted before to keep your energy up."
fasting,38c06q,Pandantica,1 point,Wed Jun 3 08:13:05 2015 UTC,"Some good ideas there. I realised i have to get the money in on Wednesday which means doing the famine this weekend. I can practice tomorrow and I guess thats about all the time I have to practice? Should I go without food until dinner? A few months while ago I tried a mini fast, not having breakfast and lunch but having a slide of bread with jam at around 5pm before dinner a few hours later, so I have tried a little bit of this before  Also how much food is basic portions be in say slices of bread over the time? Is like 3 slices a day about it?"
fasting,38c06q,Pandantica,2,Wed Jun 3 08:41:45 2015 UTC,"I think that wouldn't be a bad idea. Be sure to have a snack before dinner if you can't push that far without going full on at it and enjoy your last meal/day before the fast.  The rules are pretty mixed on eating and dependent on the people around you. Some say you shouldn't eat at all, some say very basic things like rice only and just one serving (1/2 cup) for a 24 hour period if you're a younger person. My friend who did it at your age just had one serving of plain boiled oats with nothing on top. So usually no more than one standard serving.  It really depends on the limits you want to make and how willing your donators are based on them which will give you a better answer. Some will give more because you're fully fasting, and less because you're 'cheating' in their eyes. Most are usually happy that you're imitating a person in poverty which is the whole point of it."

fasting,38awmx,WhiskeyFist,4,Thu Jun 4 21:00:11 2015 UTC,"Fasting will definitely cause your body to use stored items and it will cause your metabolism to slow down after a few days, but it does not shut down.   A two day fast will likely not effect your metabolism, and will only remove the glycogen (sugars) stored in your liver and empty your waste system. This will make you feel lighter and even look slightly slimmer.   A 5 day fast will clear your liver and waste stores, and also start drawing on fat reserves. You will definitely not only feel lighter, you will have lost some fat too, but by the end of it your metabolism may have slowed a little. Unlikely by too much though."

Basically, as the other comments have stated, a long term fast will definitely fuck up your moods and dramatically increase your seizure risk.  Furthermore, the dosage of your medication is prescribed in consideration of your physical measurements (build/BF%/weight etc) as well as your diet.  I would recommend either A) tapering* off your meds before attempting a long term fast or B) stick with intermittent short term fasts. Definitely talk to your doctor before you change anything having to do with your Rx, though.  *It's important to taper off slowly, extending the taper over several weeks under your physician's direction.."

A far better plan would be to combine something such as intermittent fasting (16/8) or warrior diet (20/4) with your gym work outs. Train fasted in the morning if possible, then don't eat till the evening - whichever fits your life better. Trying to train after 20 hours of not eating and dieting will probably make you feel very shit though.

fasting,386nd2,mur218,0,Tue Jun 2 15:26:16 2015 UTC,"In my opinion fasting reduces your conciousness. The science behind it is your brain requires something like 30g of glucose each day to function - and it must be glucose. As your body begins to to utilise body fat for fuel, it also releases adrenaline-like compounds.  When I don't eat I feel high, people frequently say they have more energy.  You tend to feel dizzy and light headed. I find I actually become quite talkative ~16+ hours in to a fast. It's 5pm i'm still at work I havn't eaten since 9pm yesterday and I'm chatting much more shit than usual almost like I'm drunk it's almost dangerous.  If you just want to experience what its like to fast, go for it, but you'll feel like shit to begin with. You need to ease into it. Push back feeding times by an hour a day. Start by skipping breakfast then have a late lunch, when you feel sick, eat. I used to find not eating would cause migraines for myself.  I wouldn't say I feel at piece fasting. I feel time goes quicker, I feel busy and focused. I'm almost feel ""on auto pilot"" and experience depersonalisation. I do this so regularly days of the week don't matter to me any more."

I assume the headaches and dizziness are coming from an electrolyte imbalance, so the sodium/potassium and multivitamin are crucial to avoid these pitfalls. Also, excess water could make these issues worse, so I'm limiting the amount of water consumed in one sitting. The sleeplessness happens anytime I don't eat within 10-12 hours before bed, so it's really just a lack of food issue. I'm hoping the Valerian root and melatonin will help combat the problem."

fasting,3818ds,moonlapse,7,Mon Jun 1 14:30:02 2015 UTC,"Loss of Lean Mass: While my numbers may suggest that I have had a slight decrease in lean mass, I think that glycogen stores and associated water content may partially account for the deficit.  Another factor is that I was using a bioelectric scale to do my measurements during the fast, which are notoriously inaccurate and prone to fluctuations based on various anatomical conditions.  Based on my understanding of nutritional ketosis, there is a fairly low level of proteolytic gluconeogenesis as the body preferentially uses fatty acid stores for most basal metabolic needs.  As far as I know, prolonged fasting is actually rather muscle sparing as long as there are available fat reserves and the body is fully fat-adapted. This change happens very quickly — within the first 3 days of a fast.  For the remainder of the fast — particularly after several weeks of adaptation — the brain and heart use ketone bodies as the major source of fuel, until fat stores run out, at which point protein degradation occurs.  “Only 40 g of glucose is then needed per day for the brain, compared with about 120 g in the first day of starvation. The effective conversion of fatty acids into ketone bodies by the liver and their use by the brain markedly diminishes the need for glucose. Hence, less muscle is degraded than in the first days of starvation. The breakdown of 20 g of muscle daily compared with 75 g early in starvation is most important for survival. A person's survival time is mainly determined by the size of the triacylglycerol depot.” (section 30.3.1 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22414/).  So that means during a 30 day fast, one could expect perhaps 225 grams of muscle loss in the first 3 days and 540 g over the next 27 days — a total of 0.765 kg, or approximately 1.68 pounds of muscle.  That’s really not a whole lot of muscle loss.  I am somewhat skeptical about whether that would destroy someone’s mad gains — and if so, that it can’t be quickly recovered post-fast.  Intuitively, it makes sense that in a state of starvation, the body would prefer to conserve as much lean mass for as long as possible since that could make all the difference in the ability to hunt or gather resources necessary to secure actual food for sustenance.  It seems to me that cannibalizing lean mass would be counterproductive and an absolute last ditch effort, only to occur after all usable internal fat stores have been depleted.  I’d love to see some peer reviewed articles on this topic that show otherwise."
fasting,3818ds,ishamm,6,Mon Jun 1 02:49:34 2015 UTC,"Vitamin/Mineral/Electrolyte supplements: In terms of liquids, I primarily had water, but also occasionally supplemented with green tea or herbal tea — just for some flavour variety.  Every morning I had a glass of water that contained 3 grams of potassium chloride (commercial salt substitute) and 5 grams of sodium chloride (refined table salt) along with all my pill supplements.  A few of these do list things like dextrose, sucrose, lactose, and gelatine as ’non-medicinal ingredients’, so there was probably a very small amount of calories/sugars ingested from that.  It didn’t seem to affect my state of nutritional ketosis at all (see included graphs).  Morning:   1 x Generic brand multi-vitamin for women 2 x Magnesium citrate 150 mg 1 x Folic Acid 1000 mcg 1 x Vitamin D 25 mcg 1 x Probiotic (30 Billion) 1 x Vitamin B12 1000 mcg 1 x Vitamin B Complex + Vitamin C (35 mg B1, 15 mg B2, 5 mg B6, 10 mcg B12, 300 mg ascorbic acid) 1 x Calcium Carbonate 500 mg   Before Bed:   2 x Melatonin Plus tablets (1.5 mg melatonin, 100 mg L-theanine, 15 mg L-5-HTP)   I’ve included all of the associated biometric data plots taken during the fast.

fasting,3818ds,MuffinPuff,3,Mon Jun 1 16:04:40 2015 UTC,"Plan for breaking fast: I don’t plan to break my fast by breaking ketosis, so I won’t be eating a bunch of fruits and juice, which seems to be the popular thing to do.  On day +1, I plan to drink 1-3 cups of bulletproof coffee (340 calories per cup) and maybe have some bone broth.  I’ll slowly start adding some protein back into my diet over the following few days, starting with egg whites and moving up to chicken, tilapia, and tuna, meanwhile continuing with the BPC.  On Day +1, I’ll probably stick to under 1000 calories and I’ll probably move up to 1300-1500 calories for the following days, depending on how my digestive system is feeling.  I’ll still be monitoring my blood ketones and glucose for at least a few weeks following the fast.  I’ll also be continuing my full vitamin, mineral, and electrolyte supplementation regimen for at least a week following the end of the fast.  Future goals and next steps: My fitness/aesthetics goal going into the fast was to drop fat mass. Once the fast is over, I planned to go back to my maintenance calories (~1500/day) or a small surplus (~1600-1700/day) and see if I can either start a recomp or a very very slow bulk to get down to maybe around 12-14% BF.  It’d be awesome if I can get my lean mass up by maybe 5 kg over the next year or so.  I’m not sure how much lean mass I’ll be able to put on since I’m not on gear or anything.  I figure if my lifts are improving, my lean mass must also be increasing.  Form should follow function, right?  I’d like to continue working on improving my main lifts, get stronger, get better ab definition, work on my back definition, and most importantly (for me) get some decent progress on my posterior chain and quads.  My squat form (low bar), ankle flexibility, and hip flexibility all need work.  Currently, I take a fairly wide stance and I want to work on reducing that distance and getting more hamstring/glute activation in the hole.  I want to hit 135 pounds on bench and finally graduate up to the 45-lb plates.  I’m most happy with my deadlift progression and would like to hit a 300x1 on that within the next year.    Since I ultimately plan to maintain a relatively low body fat percentage (12-14%), I don’t think I’ll ever be able to safely attempt a 30 day fast again, unless I deliberately packed on a bunch of fat pre-fast — which would be completely counter productive to my long term health and aesthetic goals.  I’m really glad I had the experience and I’ve learned a lot about my body and what I am capable of.  I definitely feel very self empowered.  I may still do 7 day fasts here and there for IGF-1 reduction, but that’s probably the longest length I’ll do — which makes me sad given how positive my experience with longer fasts has been."

As an aside, I also have a ton more weight than you to lose (see: infant to care for, meaning lots of baby weight). Do you mind me asking why you want to lose exactly 2 pounds? You are already quite light for your height, I only ask because when I was much younger I always had ideals in my head about what number on the scale would make me happy. As I got older I realized I just always lowered and lowered my number as I reached these arbitrary goals I was setting for myself because  I was never happy with my appearance as I reached all of these numbers on the scale. I only became happy with my appearance once I stopped worrying about the number on the scale that nobody ever sees and started focussing on my fitness and abilities. At my lightest I couldn't even do one good form pushup, but then I switched my focus to weight lifting and while I gained several pounds of muscle my appearance improved drastically. I never thought I could be happy at such a 'high' weight but I was actually just as slim and could do thirty good form pushups in a row and was even able to do two or three good form pullups. Anyway, I just thought I'd ask about the 2lbs just in case you were going through something similar."

fasting,37vxfu,areich,2,Sat May 30 22:19:56 2015 UTC,"Freshman 15:       The ""freshman 15"" is an expression commonly used in the United States and Canada that refers to an amount (somewhat arbitrarily set at 15 pounds, and originally just 10 ) of weight gained during a student's first year at college. In Australia and New Zealand it is sometimes referred to as First Year Fatties,  Fresher Spread,  or Fresher Five, the latter referring to a five-kilogram gain.  The purported causes of this weight gain are increased alcohol intake and the consumption of fat and carbohydrate-rich cafeteria-style food and fast food in university dormitories. Many dining halls in American universities are all-you-can-eat style and offer copious dessert choices. In addition, lack of sleep may lead to overeating and weight gain, because it lowers the level of leptin. Other causes include malnutrition, stress, and decreased levels of exercise. All of these factors can affect each person in a different way. Studies confirm many of these causes. Colleges and universities have recently been cracking down on this common problem and are trying to educate people on how to prevent it. This problem has grown so much that students are focusing on how to stop the freshman 15 before it happens.   Despite how commonly the Freshman 15 is asserted, an Ohio State University study showed that the average college student gains only two to three pounds in his or her first year. Additionally, it showed that college students did not gain any more weight than non-college students of the same age, and that the only factor that increased weight gain was heavy drinking.

Spinach has a really high level of histamines, and I'm going to be eating low-histamine foods for a while because although I am hoping to 're-set' and heal my body by the end of the fast, eating a low-histamine diet has helped my in the past in terms of having negative skin reactions when I eat.

Within the first 24-48 hours of calorie deprivation, the body depletes its glycogen stores from muscles and the liver. Then it starts breaking down protein within muscles and fat to produce energy. During that process, the body’s metabolism slows down in order to conserve energy. Finally, hormonal reactions will fluctuate.  You muscles go catabolic, which is why i avoid greater than 48. edit: wouldn't fasting more than 36 hours be defined as something other than ADF?

My opinion is this article is describing the benefits of a lack of carbohydrates, which by definition is also true during a fast, but can also be true if you stop eating (or eating very many) carbohydrates (grains, sugar, fruit, milk, starchy veggies, processed foods, etc)  I didn't read more in the series, but as far as muscle goes, when fasting the body does detox, and part of that process is to kick out the less healthy cells, which includes muscle cells.  So while I would argue it's true you do start to lose some muscle, it's only purging cells that need to be purged.  Having said that, if you fast for a loooong time, you will start purging healthy muscle cells as well. But this is well beyond the several days fast. This happens after several weeks of fasting. And even then, if you continue to exercise, the effect is not significant."
fasting,37dwo1,jeremyvaught,1 point,Wed May 27 19:13:12 2015 UTC,"A fasting person will inevitably burn some muscle, and that will start straight away, because the body needs a little protein on a daily basis. If it is not coming from food, it just have to come from the body itself.  The good thing is that after the muscle glycogen is depleted, the body enters ketosis, which is a protein sparing mode. It is hard to tell exactly how much muscle will be burned. This is a good description of what happens to the body while fasting, and it gives the number of 20g per day.

The best part about fasting is how the digestive system takes a break so energy is used elsewhere. If you need something in your stomach to sleep trying broth.

I think the best I can say is that I treat the inflammation itself as a symptom (manifesting within the digestive system,) caused by foods and whatever else is put into and broken down by the body, which in turn creates further symptoms such as inflammation outside the digestive system, i.e rosacea, and of course all of this is prey to and exacerbates mental stress which in turn can exacerbate inflammation. There's a lot of new and good research out there about how our digestive systems really do effect the rest of our bodies in a huge way. It seems as though a lot of researchers are gravitating toward this idea. And I'm sure there are lots of researches out there who have studied this for years, having been frustrated that general practices don't take notice.

fasting,371kvw,Moistbanana,2,Sun May 24 00:30:51 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend taking fat burners on a water fast. One of the benefits of water fasting is detoxing/healing, and since taking in any substance that requires digestion (anything other than water) will force your digestive system to stay active, your body won't be free to focus on other things. I don't know if it would be a good idea to get in the way of your body's natural processes and add this artificial stimulant into the mix. It could potentially have adverse affects.  I wouldn't do any intense cardio for the same reasons that I'll mention below, however, mild/light cardio should be fine. Just don't overexert yourself. If you're interested in the healing process in addition to the weight loss aspect of fasting, then you really don't want to cause any additional stress on your body. You definitely shouldn't bother strength training during a fast. First off, it's impossible to build or define muscle when you aren't consuming calories and protein. Second off, when you exercise, your body needs energy immediately, and since it's easier to convert muscle protein to glucose as opposed to converting fat to ketones, it will use your muscles for energy instead of your fat (since there's no food in your system to use as fuel). You'll just be wasting your time and energy doing any kind of strength training, and it will likely do more harm than good. You don't want all your hard earned work to go to waste by losing muscle instead of fat."

fasting,36sfma,jammonit,1 point,Fri May 22 10:26:17 2015 UTC,"Hyponatremia:       Hyponatremia (American English) or hyponatraemia (British English) is low sodium concentration in the blood.  Normal serum sodium levels are between approximately 135 and 145 mEq/liter (135 - 145 mmol/L). Hyponatremia is generally defined as a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and is considered severe when the serum sodium level is below 125 mEq/L.    Too little sodium in the diet alone is very rarely the cause of hyponatremia, although it can promote hyponatremia indirectly and has been associated with Ecstasy-induced hyponatremia.  Sodium loss can lead to a state of low blood volume, which signals the release of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH). [citation needed] ADH release leads to water retention and dilution of the blood resulting in a low sodium concentration.  Many conditions including congestive heart failure, liver failure, kidney failure and pneumonia are commonly associated with a low sodium concentration in the blood. This state can also be caused by overhydration from drinking too much water because of excess thirst (polydipsia). Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) is common in marathon runners and participants of other endurance events.  13% of the athletes who finished the 2002 Boston Marathon were in a hyponatremic state, that is, the salt levels in their blood had fallen below usual levels.

Normally, I feel energetic and awake, but I basically spent the past 3 days in bed watching TV and reading. I took a light walk on Sunday and was completely winded by the end. The main thing I'm concerned about at this point is driving to and from work. On Friday afternoon, I was so tired driving home that I had to struggle to keep my eyes open. So that makes me worry. I'm not sure why I feel this way -- it's possible that I've done too many fasts within a short period of time and that my body hasn't built up enough strength to undertake such a long fast. I'm not sure.   Anyway, I'm going to finish out this week and see how I'm feeling at the 2 week mark. If I'm still feeling this way, I might just have to listen to my body and stop there. I really want to make it to 3 weeks, but I also don't want to push my body too hard just for the sake of reaching an arbitrary goal.   One thing that I found interesting: Over the past 2 days, I only lost 0.8 of a pound, so my weight loss has slowed down dramatically. I was so excited to see myself back in the 130's this morning, but nope, my body won't give me that satisfaction yet :p I'm obviously doing this for more reasons than to just lose weight, but 0.2 of a pound in one day... really?? Haha I think it might be because I've been trying to drink more water, so I'm not too concerned about it. One thing I will say, though, is that all of my sugar cravings have completely disappeared! I was thinking about how it would feel to eat chocolate (my weakness), and it honestly didn't even appeal to me. I've been craving eggs, salad, and sushi like crazy! I'm really looking forward to ""indulging"" in some healthy foods once I start eating again. I bought a watermelon over the weekend in case I need to break my fast next week. I've read that watermelon is a good way to break a water fast.   If I don't make it all the way to 3 weeks, I really hope that you can still get there so you can tell us all how it goes!"

The closest I've gotten is 136 with zero-carb combined with ESE and walking five times a week.   I've never managed to do a water only fast longer than three days, so I'm already impressed that you've done a fast for 12 days! I wish you the best of luck and health for the three week fast!"

You want to be sure the water has some form of essential minerals (K, Ma, Na, Fe) becuase if you were to drink nothing but purified water it can actually strip you of electrolytes if in a prolonged fast.

fasting,36ibrb,biogeekgrrrl,1 point,Wed May 20 05:20:24 2015 UTC,"Adding any type of sugar calories into your diet during a fast could prevent you from reaching stable nutritional ketosis -- which makes the entire fasting process much easier.  Drinking juice could kick you right out of ketosis and leave you back in the induction phase (keto flu) -- which is all kinds of sucky.  That's why it's generally recommended to do water-only -- plus supplementing with essential electrolytes like calcium chloride, magnesium citrate, potassium chloride, and sodium chloride, as well as all the essential vitamins/minerals."

fasting,36hbzs,1836,3,Tue May 19 15:49:40 2015 UTC,"Hey, CorduroyCanary, you're on the right track. What you're doing right now (essentially fasting 23 hours a day) was written about in a book called ""The Warrior Diet."" Just keep doing it! For now, that's all you need to know. Don't worry about lifting right now. Just keep walking and stick to one meal a day. Don't worry about the body fat percentage from the scale, those are notoriously inaccurate.  With all that said, I'd very, very highly recommend checking out a book called ""Eat Stop Eat,"" by Brad Pilon. He goes into the many health benefits of fasting, and recommends a very practical strategy (taking a 24-hour break from eating every 3-5 days) that I believe is sustainable over the long term—long-term stability being the single most important factor in any diet's success. So, think long term and sustainability, and remember that you're in this for the long haul, so whatever you do, it needs to work with your lifestyle and particular needs. Don't try to get rail thin overnight. It takes time. Be patient (as much as that sucks). But you can do it.  At some point, you'll want to figure out how many calories you burn in a day vs. how many calories you eat in a day, but don't overcomplicate things.  The main thing is, you need to eat less than you burn. By only eating one meal, you make that real easy, plus you get to have a filling meal at the end of the day.   Good luck man. Let me know if you have any other questions!"

I don't see ketosis as being some magical state to enter for the sake of entering it.  My arguments for doing an occasional 3 day fast include: * Rest the digestive system, allow it to heal * Reset immune system: Immune cells appear to be consumed during the fast and regenerated post-fast. * Encourage body to consume weaker / damaged cells for subsistence during fast. * Potentially enable a reset of gut bacteria. * Redefine one's psychological relationship to food.  One final benefit that I find intriguing: There are some recent medical studies that have examined the benefit of a 3 day fast prior to chemotherapy. They are discovering that it can reduce side effects and potentially improve the efficacy of the chemo. So on top of all of the other benefits, confidence in my ability to fast gives me an extra option if god forbid I ever have to stare down the specter of cancer."

One day in the office there was pressure to eat chocolates, I ate a small flake before going gym an hour later, felt very ill / hyperglycemic and had to cut my work out short. I assume the difference in blood sugar levels was too rapid of a change.  Strength is the same, endurance has improved. I'm not exactly stronger, but my 1rm feels easier and no more sticking points, probably just from practise and neurological adaptations. Muscular definition is increasing due to fat loss, cardio endurance is up and noticeably improved.  At the weekend after a 1 hour weights work out, I ran 6k on a cross trainer with heart rate goal of 160 (difficulty adjusts to reflect heart rate) and felt great during it, could have gone on longer. Overally I just feel alot stronger and fitter. I'm currently training 6 days a week, easy for me to do 5 days a week as theres a gym around the corner from my work. I go for 40 minutes at a time and try to just stick to one main exercise. My current routine Sunday push, Monday pull, Tuesday legs, Wednesday push, Thursday pull, Friday legs, Saturday off/cheat day breaking a fast as midday. Weights last about 20 minutes then I throw in some intervals cardio for good measure.  I always train fasted and I've been eating a lot of calcium recently as I read a study that it aids in noticeably reducing belly fat whilst dieting. I supplement during the day with aspirin, caffeine, and tums callcium supplement every morning which helps a lot.  Probably going to run a DMP cycle to take me to single digit body fat, currently sitting around 10-12%, leanest and strongest i've ever been - and I've been a fat fuck at 270lbs and a skinny weakling at 165lbs (2 years later) during my life."

For example yesterday I ate 2 pieces of toast, one of those small lite cans of tuna, a sugar free red bull, about 600ml of water and a small handful of chocolate bullets. Yet I gained 200g. At the very most my calorie intake was 750, and that's being generous on the bullets.  Since I've been doing this for months, I'm wondering if my body has just adapted. Am thinking of having a high calorie day to see if that helps afterwards."

I did one a few months ago (although I did allow myself tea and vegetable broth) and I lasted 2.5 days. It's HARD. rewarding, but hard, so if you're not super motivated don't get into that. What I think would be a lot, lot, lot more helpful would be setting up safety nets. Meaning: find good substitutions for the things you like and have those in the house instead. Talk about your health goals with somebody that has the task to stop you when you want to go buy fast food. Learn to cook good healthy things that taste good and BELIEVE ME, the world's full of really, really delicious healthy recipes. I think ultimately the way I win over my body is out of sheer stubborness. My body will not be in charge of me! It will not control me! It will do as I say, it won't be the other way around. Mind over matter.   always have healthy food around you. when you REALLY want fast food, write it down and promise yourself you will have it, just not that day. have maybe a cheat day every couple weeks.

If there are concerns with dehydration, drink more water, water will make you feel full. If feeling full is the issue, use blend spinach, or lettuce and drink that. I would also recommend vaping vs smoking to avoid hunger. My point is use any stimulant wisely to avoid hunger, cycle through stimulants to not create a depence any of the stimulants."

fasting,35nmjb,jaffycake,-6,Wed May 20 07:46:35 2015 UTC,"Anything other than plain spring water is not fasting. The symptoms one experiences during a fast is simply the body healing and cleansing itself, most people break their fast because they want to get rid of the symptoms, however having symptoms lets you know that you are not done fasting/healing.   Colonics are not recommended because they only flush out the lower part of the colon where most of the stuck waste material is much deeper. Colonics also flush out the good bacteria in the colon and stretches it out, the benefits do not out weigh the cost. Fasting long enough will enable your body to clean the colon out by hydrating yourself enough during a fast.  psyllium husk are actually micro thorns your drinking that cut up your colon. Sure it cuts up the waste material in your colon and helps losen it for extraction, but it also cuts your colon up, it is much better to let your body heal itself naturally. Almost all the time, when we try to interfere with the natural process of healing, it only slows down the progress.  Also anti depressants should not be taken during a fast I would recommend you wean yourself off it before you start a fast. I truly believe the body plays a large part in ones happiness and if you fast long and safely enough your body will not only heal but also balance out the chemicals in your brain and hormones than anti depressant aren't needed.  Anything less than 7 days will not have much of an impact however anything more than 7 days without supervision is not recommended. It is much better to do a single 3-4 week fast than many small 2 days fast added up to 3-4 weeks."

fasting,35nmjb,jaffycake,-4,Wed May 20 07:43:53 2015 UTC,"The fact that you say fasting is starvation already shows there is very little understanding of the processes that go on during a water fast. The body doesn't go into starvation mode until all of the adipose tissue has been used and that can take up to 6-8 weeks on a person with 10% bodyfat.  Fasting is the most efficient way for a body to heal itself. Fasting itself does not heal anything it just creates the most optimal environment for the body to heal. There is literally no other way more efficient for a body to heal that I know of. Medicine only covers the symptoms, and diet is basically a less efficient way of fasting.  Healthier foods generally take less energy to digest which in turn enables more energy for the body to heal. Fasting has help numerous people with depression successfully under supervision of course."
fasting,35nmjb,magnus777,4,Thu May 21 00:11:39 2015 UTC,"Starvation is a severe deficiency in caloric energy intake.  ""Fasting is the most efficient way for a body to heal itself.""

You talk about ""medicine"" as if fasting to ""heal"" is not medicine, but fasting to treat the body is exactly that, a medicine. ""Healthier foods generally take less energy to digest"", I'm extremely confident this is not true at all and you haven't defined your opinion of ""healthier foods"".  I think fasting is great, but the things you say and the way you talk about it reek of spiritual beliefs rather than scientific fact. You talk about healing and make claims which are more about what you'd like to believe than anything else. If you want people to take fasting seriously drop the crap and talk about facts."

Healing = To restore to health. I know fasting is the most efficient because nature is perfect and you cannot improve on it, that is a fact.   The very definition of medicine ( A substance, especially a drug, used to treat the signs and symptoms of a disease, condition, or injury.) means that it is not healing the cause but treating the symptom where as a fast is addressing the cause.  Im not sure why you are extremely confident that healthier foods are ""not"" easier to digest. If you even thought about it for 1 min it would be pretty obvious. fruits, vegetables(healthier foods) are obviously easier to digest than donuts, cakes and bacon(non healthy foods).

What I am saying is if you or anybody tries to improve on nature with our minds than it will always be less than perfect. If you throw a 30 yr old man in a pool who with his mind ""thinks"" he cannot swim, than he will drown. If you throw a 6 month old baby in a pool the baby will naturally turn his/her face upward and float because the baby does not try to improve on nature. The baby simply lets the body perfect his/her own survival.   Also I've talked to experts in fasting on diseases such as polio and they can be heal with fasting. Anything that can heal will heal with fasting and nothing else (against nature) would be more efficient."
fasting,35nmjb,magnus777,-1,Sat Jul 4 17:58:09 2015 UTC,"It's all about self-discipline and will-power. If while you're fasting you feel all those things you said, it probably means your body is in a deep state of detox. You need to conquer the hunger, find things to try and distract yourself, and most of all believe in yourself, the second you don't believe you can do it, that's when you will give in.  Don't eat anything, at all, no psyllium husks, nothing. Eat the psyllium husks on the days preparing for the fast. And that's another thing, prepare for the fast. If you've been eating badly, and you suddenly fast, you will struggle, a lot.  In your 3 days preparing for the fast, cut out sugar, dairy and gluten/starchy/grain foods. On the last day before the fast, try to eat as little carbs as possible, this will help your body go into ketosis faster.  During your fast, the first 2 days are the hardest, once you get to day 3, your body will go into ketosis. Here was were you went wrong, you ate psyllium husks, which contain carbohydrates, which prevent your body going into ketosis. Ketosis is when you start feeling energetic and the hunger subsides. Ketosis is a state where your body starts to energize itself from fat stores, when it realizes that there are no carbs coming into the system, so the husks are a big no-no.  Once you start fasting properly, and really paying attention to your diet, you probably wont need the antidepressants any-more.   I also really would not recommend doing a yoghurt fast, or enema. From the research I've done, dairy is something to avoid, there are much better pro-biotic foods, like fermented vegetables. If you want to do a colon cleanse, do the master cleanse or something like that. A pure water fast is also one of the best ways to go."

fasting,35ds5j,K-nan,2,Sun May 10 03:04:37 2015 UTC,"I've done two 30 day water only fasts, which has many wonderful health benefits, but weight loss is not one of them. You will lose about a pound a day on average, but when the fast is broken appetite soars--high. It takes a lot of discipline to keep a low carb diet after fasting, which is what is necessary to prevent regaining all the lost weight, and more. Fasting every other day, eating a clean healthy diet days on, is an easier way to lose weight unless you are older or insulin resistant."
fasting,35ds5j,dustyboo,1 point,Wed May 13 12:53:35 2015 UTC,"The longest water fast I've ever done was 12 days. I lost 18 pounds. I would strongly urge you to read up on how to properly break a water fast (if you haven't already done so). It's incredibly easy to gain all of the weight back if you go straight back to your old habits. HOWEVER, if you slowly ease into a healthy eating routine, you can not only keep the weight off but end up losing even more. The main point is that breaking the fast properly is even more important than the fast itself -- you don't want all your hard work to go to waste. But it is possible to keep the weight off. Aside from gaining a few pounds of water weight back, I managed to keep off most of the weight from my 12 day fast, which was 8 months ago.   PS - Don't listen to the people who have nothing positive to say about fasting but haven't actually experienced it for themselves. There's a difference between fasting and starvation (which only occurs once all non-essential body fat and damaged tissue has been burned for fuel)."
fasting,35ds5j,velinxs,1 point,Tue May 19 16:11:00 2015 UTC,I'd recommend starting off with 7 days if you're just trying to detox then just adjust your diet from there. You'll find you will need much less food to fill you up and the fast will reset your tastes buds so you can learn to enjoy a healthier diet.

Next day I also drank some tomato and apple juice with a soup and at dinner I chose 2 potatoes with 2 pieces cauliflower.

fasting,3567px,ebrau36,1 point,Thu May 7 13:25:46 2015 UTC,"Good point, I have always identified certain allergies myself but I suppose I could see an actual doctor. Thats what they are there for!"
fasting,3567px,kameeleun,3,Thu May 7 13:46:46 2015 UTC,"Histamine is largely what's responsible for the physical effects of an allergic reaction. Fasting is a stress on the body, and stress triggers our bodies to release histamine. Severe stress alone can cause a enough of a histamine response that you could seem like you're having an allergic reaction out of nowhere. Some foods also trigger our bodies to release it's own histamine, and stress will further increase this release of histamine. Finally, some foods themselves contain histamines. Cheese is one of these foods that itself contains relatively high levels of histamines. Some people are also relatively less able to break down these histamines, due to lower levels of a certain enzyme.   Very likely your body was under a little stress from the fast, and you may just naturally have lower levels of the enzyme needed to break down histamine, or for whatever reason the fast lowered this enzyme.   It's possible that for you cheese also has some level of histamine releasing effect on your body and then it was increased by the stress of the fast. So it's possible you've had a mild cheese allergy all this time on top of the histamine that's actually in cheese, or it's possible the histamine levels in cheese are normally not severe enough to trigger the symptoms of an allergic reaction without added stress. The only way to really tell is to see an allergist.   Just curious, were you eating real cheese or a 'cheese product'?"
fasting,3567px,FrogZombies,1 point,Tue May 12 23:13:18 2015 UTC,I've been doing the 5:2 fasting thing with two days of restricting my calories to 500. On my second fast day last week I ate a HUGE raw spinach salad and an hour later promptly threw it up. In researching it seems that I may have had a histamine reaction to the raw spinach. I never thought about the fact that the fast might put extra stress on my body and add additional histamine.
fasting,3567px,Chipware,1 point,Wed May 13 13:02:05 2015 UTC,Your explanation makes a lot of sense.  I actually ate one of those mini babybels. They say its a real cheese but I would consider this more of a cheese product. I am a huge cheese lover and typically eat a higher quality of cheese but have found these to be an easy snack.  The odd thing that I have seen is that people who are allergic to something tend to crave/love the thing they are allergic to. I am worried this is the case here. I already gave up bread for my keto lifestyle & I think giving up cheese would be devastating!  I do think  the smart thing to do is to see an allergist.

I've fasted for 10 days and 5 days earlier this year and am now 6 days into a water fast. I have a 6 yo, 4 yo, 2 yo, and I work part time from home while caring for my kids.  There are a few things I've learned that have made this fast a lot easier.   1) Freezer meals. I prefer crockpot freezer meals, and I use them with a crockpot liner so there's less clean up. I found a lot of recipes on Pinterest; this has made my life so much easier in general right now. I usually take a few hours on a Saturday and make 10-15 meals, tripling most recipes.   2) Anything to take housekeeping duties off of you. Use paper plates, catch up on laundry beforehand, let general tidying slide on low energy days, whatever works for you.   3) Easy meals for the kids that aren't tempting for you. I don't keep certain foods in the house because I know I'll binge on them, this is doubly true during fasting. I made several batches of muffins and froze them for breakfasts for the kids; I picked recipes that don't tempt me. I also compromise during fasting and get convenience foods like frozen waffles and pancakes. We don't have these during normal life, and fasting is helping me to regain my health, so I see it as a very temporary trade off. We eat mostly keto during normal life, and I try to make most evening meals keto for my husband and kids' sake, which is easy with the crock pot meals.   I hope that helps, and good luck! It's definitely a different set of challenges to fast while caring for young children, but you can do it. :)"

I did not take any vitamins as I read that it could activate your digestive tract which you want to let rest.  The last few days, I felt ready to be done the fast but that was probably because I knew the end was in sight :). The last half of the fast I felt a constant emptiness in my stomach.  On the 40th day I believe I finally felt true hunger, Tugging sensation in my stomach and back of my throat. It kind of felt like I wanted to throw up. I also had a sore throat the last 3 days so I might have just been sick.  I broke the fast in the middle of the night after the 40th day, I was having trouble sleeping. I got a headache which was alarming because I never get them, ever.   So I had a glass of apple juice mixed with water. And continued drinking apple juice the rest of the day. had about 2L of it.  Today I continued to drink my apple juice and had some water melon for dinner, I can feel my digestive tract starting to wake up again."

No thanks, I'd rather see more research into curing cancer and other real subjects.  Being used as primary care in China is not a logical argument.

Nothing you can really do to help that.  Your body has enough fat reserves to keep you healthy and energetic during the juice fast, not to mention plenty of carbohydrates, and your body can create small amounts of amino acids that will keep you healthy. If you are anemic, protein deficient, or iron deficient, talk to a doctor and they may have you supplement protein.

In general, the body does not work off of such fixed time schedules. There is variability in everyone and everything.  On top of that, what kind of scientific study produced evidence of this 20th day hypothesis? Not saying there might not be a kernel of truth to it but I doubt it's significant enough for you to stress about having ""failed your mission."" And if your mission was 21 days, you were only taking about 1 day of your brain being in its ""healing"" phase.  As for Dr Sarno: I read his book ""The Divided Mind"" and generally agree with his theories. However, the underlying argument is that your mind will create pain to avoid acknowledging a psychologically difficult issue. But your mind doesn't choose something randomly, it chooses something that is somewhat compromised. Look for other factors impacting your back and theoretically your TMS will move to some other part of the body. (Invariably easier to tolerate than back pain.)  I've dealt with back pain and hip flexor issues myself and have done a lot of research on it. Obviously, if you're overweight, eat poorly and don't exercise, that should be your starting point, not addressing possible TMS. After that, my questions for you is:  Do you sit a great deal in your job? Work on breaking up extended sitting sessions. Sit less. Walk more.  Do you stretch your hip flexors daily?

I've just started trying the Egoscue method and have seen real results:  http://www.4hourlife.com/2011/10/28/the-4-hour-body-reversing-injuries-the-egoscue-method/  Unless you're consistently addressing all of these issues, I wouldn't start reaching for a TMS resolution.  Finally, if you really want to dig into the weeds of back pain and what can help it, this eBook is well worth the $20:  https://www.painscience.com/tutorials/low-back-pain.php  eBook TL;DR: No treatments (massage, acupuncture, core exercises, etc) have scientifically been shown to resolve back pain. Back pain is largely stress related made worse by a sedentary lifestyle. Stress can lead to trigger points which can be released via foam rolling. Focus on destressing, mobilizing and releasing trigger points.  Fixating on TMS = additional stress."

If I've just gone multiple days without food, a smoothie seems a bit rich for the system.  I followed the instructions from this page when I broke my 5 day fast:  http://www.allaboutfasting.com/breaking-a-fast.html  I took things real slow and followed the (general) food progression over a 36 hour time period with tiny portions: Watermelon, unsweetened apple sauce, chicken broth, plain greek yogurt, overly steamed veggies, raw veggies and hummus, salad, eggs and beans, plain cereal with milk, beans/corn/shredded chicken mix from crock pot. While refeeding, focus on chewing everything really well.  I had zero problems with my digestive system.  The slower (and more natural) you go, the better. Also, keep in mind you are doing more than just filling your stomach or refueling your energy system. You are introducing food to your gut bacterial system. Theoretically the fast ""resets"" your gut's bacteria to a certain degree, hopefully to a more positive/healthy state. You want to introduce food in a manner that reinforces that positive state rather than sabotages it. This is why I used greek yogurt, something I've never eaten. Granted, science's specific understanding of gut bacteria is still very limited, but we know enough to know it's relevant. Gut bacteria outnumbers the number of cells in your body by 10x."

fasting,333ez3,allthingsketo,3,Sun Apr 19 03:40:18 2015 UTC,"Fasting worked for me. I had four brain surgeries in 2012 for something called idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). I'd had headaches for about a decade but didn't think anything of it - my job was quite stressful and everyone gets headaches right? Wrong.  I had a tube inserted into my brain to drain cerebrospinal fluid into my belly. And it all went pear shaped from there. I got sicker and sicker until I had the tubes and valves removed in late 2012. Although I felt better, I still had headaches and was prescribed topamax and fentanyl. I'm sure these made my headaches worse.  The headaches themselves, as bad as they were (my neurologist thought they were cluster headaches), weren't really ""headaches"" - I'd try to explain to my specialists that it felt as though my eyes wanted to pop out and my head would explode. Not the same as a headache, really. It is even now difficult to explain to anyone who hasn't experienced it.  Anyway after more than 18-months going nowhere, I came across a guy in the UK who developed something called the Perrin Technique. He's an osteopath and has treated ME/CFS for years and years. He described the headache his patients report as, ""not really a headache, more like a feeling that their head will explode and their eyes will pop out."" And bingo was his name-o.  His theory is that the headaches are caused in part to the lymphatic system malfunctioning, due to any number of causes, but basically the body is overly toxic from various sources. The lymphatic system interfaces with the glial cells and the blood brain barrier to break down complex proteins and other toxins from the cerebrospinal fluid so that the kidneys can handle them for expulsion. Backed up lymphatic system = too much CFS = severe headaches. Sounded legit to me.  So I went to see a dietician who advised me to try a fast, to speed up the natural detox processes. That was last October and I have been headache free - I mean zero headaches, not an hour - since then.  If you want to pm me I will be very happy to exchange details with you. If not, good luck with your fast. I advise against water fasting though as you need to be a bit more gentle with your body and feed it still even though you are giving yourself a rest from digesting solid foods, which is the key in my opinion."

fasting,333ez3,CactusInaHat,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:36:23 2015 UTC,"Cluster headache:       Cluster headache (CH) is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, severe headaches on one side of the head, typically around the eye.  There are often accompanying autonomic symptoms during the headache such as eye watering, nasal congestion and swelling around the eye, typically confined to the side of the head with the pain.   Cluster headache belongs to a group of primary headache disorders, classified as the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias or (TACs). Cluster headache is named after the demonstrated grouping of headache attacks occurring together (cluster).  Individuals typically experience repeated attacks of excruciatingly severe unilateral headache pain.  Cluster Headache attacks often occur periodically; spontaneous remissions may interrupt active periods of pain, though about 10–15% of chronic CH never remit.  The cause of cluster headache has not been identified.  While there is no known cure, cluster headaches can sometimes be prevented and acute attacks treated. Recommended treatments for acute attacks include oxygen or a fast acting triptan.  Primary recommended prevention is verapamil. Steroids may be used as a transitional treatment and may prevent attack recurrence until preventative treatments take effect. The condition affects approximately 0.2% of the general population,  and men are more commonly affected than women, by a ratio of about 2.5:1 to 3.5:1.

fasting,32y557,eatsardines,2,Sat Apr 18 01:40:21 2015 UTC,"Have you been tracking your calories?  One of the best things to start with is knowing your TDEE, which is your total daily energy expenditure.  Knowing this, you can adjust your meals to fit that mindset.  ESE will help you get to where you want to go and a lot of when you will be able to get depends on your understanding of your body.    In trying to loose weight, the biggest weapon that you can wield is control over what you put in your body.  I am sure you probably have run on the treadmill trying to get some cardio in and found out how long it takes to burn 300 calories.  It takes forever!  Having control over what goes in your body is a great thing because it helps you appreciate where your are trying to get to more because of the work involved.  A different approach you might look at is /r/leangains as well.  It is another form of IF (intermittent fasting) that gets more into lifting windows and gives a more structured plan to eating and lifting habits.  My experience with ESE is that it was a great starting place to help understand my body better.  I was on ESE for a handful of months until my goals shifted.  It worked well for me and prepared me for diving deeper into really looking at my eating habits.  One thing that I want to say is that you are doing are great job.  There are not many people who even get to the point that you are at and I think because you have begun to take control, I think that's awesome!"

For your body tissues and bones to heal you need a mineral and nutrient dense diet, with an increased amount of protein. It is a lot of work for your body to heal big injuries.

It seems to me that is the exact opposite of what you would want when you are trying to heal from a major injury.    Eating to achieve a proper intake of protein (there is a lot of protein in bones) and calcium seems like the best course of action to me. But, checking with your GP or an orthopedist will likely be your best bet."
fasting,32wfma,Nostalginen,6,Fri Apr 17 07:29:53 2015 UTC,It has helped me but I'd say my bigger success came when I started Intermittent fasting. I have an 8 hour eating window and 16 hour fasting window. It has helped with discipline as well as allowing the same number of calories in a day but in 8 hours which means that I can have a lighter meal and use the extra calories for if I want a larger snack.   There are times when I am full but have calories left over and the part of my brain that wants to over-eat will turn on and be totally satisfied AND I  still within my calories for thr day which makes me feel on top of the world!

fasting,32wfma,Tamaraofarabia,2,Fri Apr 17 09:13:07 2015 UTC,"Try not to think of it as reclaiming self-discipline but as getting back in touch with your hunger. Intermittent fasting can help you get more satisfaction out of your meal(s) by ensuring you're truly hungry when you eat, which enables you to stop when you've had enough. The problem with bingeing is that you stop feeling hungry, food becomes less satisfying, and then it feels like you need more and more to stimulate your senses in the same way.  I recently switched to IF as an experiment to address some binge eating episodes and it was incredibly effective. I've been eating 1200 calories during one evening meal. During the day I feel liberated from the need for food, and during the evening I am completely satisfied by eating a big, relaxing meal (with no guilt). It's a gamechanger."

fasting,32isxu,catchupmustard,3,Tue Apr 14 03:13:04 2015 UTC,"I meant for this to be in PSMF   That would be correct - when I saw the title, I immediately thought of PSMF. But please read their links first, I believe some of your questions are answered / explained thoroughly   As long as I get atleast 50 grams of protein and try to stay low carb, will my body burn mostly fat or is it 50% fat and 50% muscle loss?   Definitely not 50/50. On PSMF you lose next to no muscle if you do it right. Should be all/almost all bodyfat.   is weight training better than extended walking (1 hr walks versus light weight lifting)?   There is no doubt here, weight training is better for muscle preservation.   will more exercise just mean more muscle breakdown or is it possibly to maintain/build muscle on a PSMF?   I believe PSMF is all about maintaining - no breakdown. It is very hard to build muscle being on a severe calorie deficit though - I'd say next to impossible. But if you lose fat, your muscle becomes more visible, so it actually may seem as if you gained.   is low carb better and does this mean I should avoid fruit?   PSMF is all about eating mostly protein so it means both low carb and low fat at the same time. So yes, avoid fruit. You ideally should be in the state called ""ketosis"", where muscle preservation is best and the body takes most of the energy from body fat breakdown. To achieve ketosis you should be eating, ideally, no more than about 30g carbs per day, maybe less due to smaller body size.  Won't comment much on food, except that if you aim for ketosis, then probably skip the grapefruit and check the shake for carbs. 15g protein is 60 calories and your shake is 150, where does the rest come from?"
fasting,32isxu,Evgeny_,1 point,Tue Apr 14 08:03:54 2015 UTC,"Once you are keto adapted, your body goes to great lengths to preserve muscle for two reasons: it is metabolically inefficient to use muscle for energy and why would your body turn to muscle when it has huge stores of energy (fat) to use?    That being said, low calorie diets recommend a certain level of protein intake to replace the muscle that is naturally turned over as protein cannot be created from out energy stores (fat)."
fasting,32isxu,DrPeterVenkman_,0,Tue Apr 14 13:54:09 2015 UTC,"Less calories always means more weight loss. How much fat or muscle you are going to lose depends on many factors, yet you will always lose considerably more fat than muscle.  While PSMF may sound good on paper, on practice it does not turn out as well. Controlled calorie intermittent fasting is a much better option for fat loss. Ketosis is not essential unless you either enjoy it and/or function better under it. In other cases it will only destabilize and slow you down."

fasting,32fh73,TeslaModelE,4,Mon Apr 13 11:05:11 2015 UTC,"I've done a 48 hour fast during the week. The key for me was a lot of water and a lot of sleep. I didn't have a problem during the day as long as I had a solid 8 hours of sleep in the evening and did very light activities (yoga, meditation, tidying up, leisurely walking, etc.). Temptation is a different story. I'm not very social in my office so it's easier to thwart the onslaught of food-related offerings. But, I would advise that you do NOT tell people that you are fasting for non-religious purposes. They will try to make you feel like crap for it AND they will tempt you because people kinda suck (yes, even your friends)...so be cautious/conscious of that. Like the other guy said, 36 hours in is kinda like a breaking point. I talked to myself A LOT. Convincing myself that I wasn't even hungry was almost like putting myself into a trance; KEEPING myself in the trance was the hardest part.............................and now all this talk makes me want to fast now lol. Good Luck!"

fasting,32d5d0,Metatrons_Cube,1 point,Mon Apr 13 07:15:31 2015 UTC,"I've been successful with fasting. Water fasting is the same.  Don't go by calculations. Just look in the mirror. You will find that your weight will stay the same for days on end, but randomly a chunk would just come off. Don't look at the weight, but maybe once a week. Use your mirror as a gauge.  Exercising always makes weight-loss faster. Always. You'll lose fat loss, and potentially some muscule loss since you are fasting, however, it can be regained, so no worries there. Also, try lifting weights. Weight lifting increases lean body mass, and you'll be shedding weight. Walking 1 hour a day is definitely great. Light lifting is fine. If you get light headed or feel weak, then do not try at all. Supplements that you are taking are not going to cut it. You need multivitamins. Those with high dosages are best. Don't go for cheap kinds either. Search the internet for real good quality multivitamins that is well known."

fasting,32a7jo,idcjustneedanaccount,1 point,Sun Apr 12 00:09:00 2015 UTC,"Good job on your fasting. Here are a few pointers that will rapidly help with your weight loss:   Drink organic green tea. Do not add milk or sugar. Organic green tea contains ECGC which raises your metabolism, and thus will help you sweat more and lose weight. The same goes for black coffee. It will give you a huge burst of energy at times when you need it. Just a small two or three sips is enough for me when I'm fasting. Take advantage of naps. If you get extremely hunger pangs, then just take a nap even for just 30 minutes. Keep drinking tons of water. I drink 1 gallon/day. Keep exercise to a minimum, however, try standing up as much as possible. Do not sit/lay down unless you want to sleep.  If you can, then exercise immediately before sleep. That way you'll be burning calories while sleeping. This is by far my biggest secret Eat a spoonful of raw, organic, hard-pressed coconut oil every day. It contains good fat which fights off the bad fat. You don't ever gain weight from it. Take fish oil or krill oil supplements. You will do wonders for body fat.  Take an high-quality multivitamin. I only buy from the company Garaden of Life, because I know their quality can't be beat. This goes for 7, 8, 9: Do not buy these if you aren't going to buy real organic raw natural vitamins. If you can't afford them, then just don't buy any. It's worse for you to take vitamins that are synthetic. They go straight to your pee at best. Remember, diet is only 1/2 the part. Diet + Exercise will give you fastest results. Sweat more. Even if you're just moving and re-arranging the house, just do that. Just stay on your feet.   I am here for you hun. If you ever just need to text at any morning, day, or night, then I'd be happy to PM you my number. I will hold your hand all the way through, and encourage you. Just let me know.   Fasting is great for your health, and just avoid those people who claim otherwise. In terms of weight loss, I went from 220 to 180 in 1 month by intermittent fasting + exercising twice a day. So, there's potential. Good luck!"
fasting,32a7jo,redwildcherry7,2,Sun Apr 12 15:12:45 2015 UTC,Exercising while fasting while just burn muscle. The point of a water fast is for purification and weight loss. Why introduce black coffee and green tea when they are acidic?
fasting,32a7jo,fastifguy,2,Sun Apr 12 16:04:24 2015 UTC,"Regardless of fasting, exercising will always be beneficial. Burning muscule vs. fat will depend on how you exercise. Lifting weights will ensure that lean mass stays on. I stress that both diet and exercise is required for optimal weight loss results. Fasting will get the job done, but at much more slower pace.  Apple cidar vinegar is also acidic, but it is still encouraged to sip throughout the day. The same goes, in my opinion, with ECGC and coffee. As I pointed out, they raise your metabolism, and will assist in weight loss. We should be cautious of ingesting to much acidic drinks while fasting, but sipping black coffee/green tea has benefits nonetheless."
fasting,32a7jo,redwildcherry7,2,Sun Apr 12 16:10:27 2015 UTC,Drinking black coffee and green tea will just stress the adrenal glands more and may cause cravings during a water fast. Strength training may be good for preserving muscle during a fast but not cardio.   That is my experience at least.

fasting,31vt7m,kameeleun,3,Thu Apr 9 14:14:18 2015 UTC,"Will you lose weight? Definitely. It's just a matter of willpower in terms of keeping your healthy eating and fasting going for more than a couple of days. The first few days of fasting will be incredibly sucky and the first few days of eating you'll have intense cravings. I think it's important that you follow healthy eating on your non-fasting days because it will weaken the cravings over time.   Fasting will also allow you to reach ketosis faster than regularly eating, but it will be a very tough week or so. Low carb eating is difficult as it is so if you feel weak or sick I would recommend adding some healthy carbs with a low glycemic index to your diet. These will help curb cravings.   Also another important thing to note is that you can do alternate day fasting while consuming 0-500 calories, if you find that eating nothing is just too difficult and straining I would recommend increasing calorie intake and filling up on leafy greens and lean meats as they are low calorie and nutrient rich. It is an achievable diet and weight loss plan, but it's all about sticking to your goals.   Also, the weight will come off quickly at first and kind of stall, then once again come off quickly if you increase calories for one day of the week. I don't know why, but that's how it works for me. If you want to calculate potential weight loss, just find out the calorie deficits for the days you are fasting and multiply that by the days of the month, divide by 3500 (3500 cals in a pound) and you'll see the predicted results. It'll come off faster at the beginning though. Good luck!"

fasting,31uggg,Jam_pol,4,Wed Apr 8 06:16:03 2015 UTC,"My quick question is how long can I fast before my body starts burning muscle along with fat?   Unfortunately, your body will always use a little muscle when you fast, because proteins / amino acids are not stored in the body, but are required by the body.  You actually lose a little more in the beginning of the fast, and less after about 3 days, when your body switches to the protein sparing mode.   The only other potential source of glucose is amino acids derived from the breakdown of proteins. However, proteins are not stored, and so any breakdown will necessitate a loss of function. Thus, the second priority of metabolism in starvation is to preserve protein, which is accomplished by shifting the fuel being used from glucose to fatty acids and ketone bodies  Hence, less muscle is degraded than in the first days of starvation. The breakdown of 20 g of muscle daily compared with 75 g early in starvation is most important for survival.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22414/  The good news is that short periods of fasting were shown to increase growth hormone, so recovery should not be a problem. For the longer fasts, I have no idea.   Fasting enhances growth hormone secretion and amplifies the complex rhythms of growth hormone secretion in man.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC329619/"

As already noted, you lose more during the first days, then you enter ketosis and your body will become more effective in conserving muscle mass.  Here is a decent source that describes the processes during prolonged fasting:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22414/   The effective conversion of fatty acids into ketone bodies by the liver and their use by the brain markedly diminishes the need for glucose. Hence, less muscle is degraded than in the first days of starvation. The breakdown of 20 g of muscle daily compared with 75 g early in starvation is most important for survival.   So, for 20 days you may expect to lose 3x75 (first days) plus 17x20 (following days) = 565g muscle.  Makes me think that to minimise the muscle loss it is a good idea to enter ketosis before starting the fast (essentially stop eating carbohydrates, or keep under 20g per day, for 2-3 days before the fast begins)."
fasting,31om67,Evgeny_,2,Tue Apr 7 07:35:20 2015 UTC,"You should expect lightheadedness and bloating. It is very, very difficult to go from fasting from short periods (3 days) to long periods (30+ days). If I were you, I would make my goal 7 or so days instead of 30.   Typically your body will deplete fat stores before it goes for muscle so I wouldn't worry about losing much muscle mass until after you've lost a significant amount of fat. Unfortunately, your brain requires energy from proteins (your muscles) so you will be losing small amounts of muscle mass throughout the process to feed your brain. Good luck."

If you are hoping to accomplish a longer fast of several days, I am a advocate for doing a test run with a one day fast. Try it out, get used to the feeling. Wait a few days (5-7) before diving in to the next phase. If you're feeling brave, go ahead into your full fast. Or if you want to build up more tolerance, try a two-day fast the second time around  Also, timing when you start may be crucial for some folks. For myself, I get better results when I begin my fast after walking up, skip all meals through that day, and then break the fast the next morning.

So when I first get hungry I'm somewhere at the 12 hours mark.  Actually, the most important thing for me is to plan beforehand around family, work and social functions. I'd rather know that during the fasting days there are no friends visiting, no work functions or any other events scheduled that generally include social eating.

Who knows? Do what works! It is scientifically proven that the scientists expectations can influence the results of an experiment, so this kind of middies the water a little.   The keto diet does seems to do wonders for people. So does a high carb vegan diet. Or just eating healthy in general. Physically/biologically yeah they all produce different outcomes, but being fit and toned is usually common with them all to varying degrees depending on what 'type' of outcome you're looking for. Having the label, just calling it a diet/lifestyle and strictly sticking with it while maintaining a positive mind-state and working out will all produce positive æffects.. It all depends on what works for someone. I don't eat meat so keto is out of the question, but it's great that you noticed such a positive result and I've gotten the same from high carb vegan before.  Detox. It's a really hyped word, I feel like a more acceptable way to describe it would be 'to cleanse'. The way I see it is, when we eat alot of 'junky food' stuff that really isn't helpful either way and put on muscle / fat with it, our minds and bodies aren't going to operate as efficiently as say, someone who eats nothing but veggies, fruit, meat, dairy, seeds etc.  I really do understand where you're coming from when saying that you just aren't seeing the evidence.

I've never tried to do a really long fast, 5 days is my max, but I've experienced the deprivation-binge pattern over and over again. I've recorded my weight daily for 5 months and it is very spiky. I think part of my primal brain is fighting me when I fast. So I have almost giving up the idea. Instead I try to become more aware of what I am feeling. If I'm not hungry then I dont eat. And maybe I'm more thirsty. And maybe I'm hungry but I only need a smaller portion. Does half the meal satisfy me?  And maybe I'm feeling hunger but its kind of  pleasant and I dont need to address it. And maybe its an insulin response to eating some carbs and it will go away in an hour. I could make a flow chart. I've found a pattern that works which is to eat a big breakfast mid morning, skip lunch and have a small late supper. My weight has completely stabilized within a pound over the last 6 days. It is still much higher than I would like. What I would like to experiment on is moving the ""big breakfast"" later and later each day. So I am fasting but its only for about 12 to 16 hours at a time.  Maybe I could up this a little to 24 or 36 hours. This is intermittent fasting but I dont like the term. I would like to get to the point where I could lose a little weight each day without the spikes. I think this is better for weight loss. I think a series of shorter fasts, a pattern to become a habit, may be the way to go."
fasting,31bguj,denverguy2,1 point,Sun Apr 5 06:48:18 2015 UTC,"This is actually what I am doing - fasting every other day. I try to set realistic goals for myself, and I know how hard fasting for even three days is, so I can't even imagine three weeks. Fasting every other day is not so bad. Yes, I get hungry, but I always tell myself that it's just ONE day. I feel like fasting this way really curbs my craving for sugar (my weakness).  I am curious about others' experience with this type of fasting. Did the weight come off easily? I don't have a lot of weight to lose (10-15 lbs), but I would like to lose it."
fasting,31bguj,beaniebears,6,Sun Apr 5 06:51:28 2015 UTC,I do 3 week fasts 2X per year. It gets easier each time and I lose a little over 1lb per day and keep about 80% of it off after I start eating again. I also do IF and basically only eat once per day plus a snack. Its like anything else. Its a habit that gets easier the more you do it. (Also my 1st fast was 28 days so I broke in the HARD WAY!!) - I'll update this with my last reddit journal.... (I started it on day 9 just cause I felt GOOD until then...)  Fasting has MANY benefits beyond weight loss. MANY. I'm the oldest of 6 kids but look the youngest (and prob the healthiest) BUT the HEALING that happens midway of a long fast is just amazing!! It never as dramatic as the deep scrubbing and repair that happens during your first long fast but its the reason I fast.  http://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1utvzw/day_9_of_21_slooow_motion/
fasting,31bguj,BlackOpz,1 point,Sat Apr 4 12:37:29 2015 UTC,"Your metabolism certainly must slow down enough at the end of 3 weeks that you won't be losing 1lb per day at the end of it. How much do you lose per each 3-week fast? How long have you done it? Assuming you are not overweight to begin with, and conservatively say that you lose 10lb per 3-week fast, you'd be dropping 20lb per year, which will get you really underweight if you have been doing it for more than 1 year."
fasting,31bguj,shitalwayshappens,4,Wed Apr 8 14:24:59 2015 UTC,True but thats the average at the end. 21 days I lose 25ish+ lbs. It never leaves me underweight because I usually fast during the times of the year I'm heaviest (New Year after the Thankgiving to New Years overeating). I dont lose 20 pounds per year and keep it totally off.  The fasting gives me a underweight starting point that makes me look a bit thinner than normal. I exercise 5x per week so it just makes me look just that more fit. I'm usually running/lifting and resume my normal healthy diet so my weight rises and stabilizes comfortably in a very lean muscled way. (Its a summer look).   In the fall or when I'm deep into programming (like I am now) I let my weight rise naturally as I allow myself to indulge a little since I know a 3 week fast is coming up. Since I exercise I just become heavier/lighter version of myself at diff points in the year BUT...  I do IF and only eat once a day and maybe a smaller portion later if I get hungry again. So my daily lifestyle never overloads me with calories in the first place.

I barely broke my fast this morning so I'm sure my body needs time to get back to its normal self. I can hold a conversation with out running out of breath and do some stuff. It's when I start to try to do a bunch of things at once when I slowly start getting ""out of breath"".  I did read about someone who could not hold a conversation with out running out of breath who went to the er but that's not my case and every time I eat I can feel myself getting stronger."
fasting,319dzc,Sulla123,1 point,Fri Apr 3 04:44:45 2015 UTC,"I'm too lazy to look up the specifics and I'm on mobile. But when we experience ""air hunger"" and end up breathing fast/hyperventilating,  we blow off the carbon dioxide causing ph to go up (become basic). We call this respiratory alkalosis (blood becomes slightly basic in response to a stimuli causing acidosis). The autonomic system causes this process is response to metabolic acidosis. What causes metabolic acidosis? Well I imagine Keto acidosis, as it is in the name. I'm just pulling from my acid/base class if I remember right.  I don't have experience with extended fasts because I do IF. I've never been in keto. But I think that maybe your body will adapt over time. If this is your first extended fast maybe it will take a few more times. Next fast you do you might try easing into it over 3 days or so. Slowly dropping all carbs out so that you ease into ketoacidosis.   Best of luck"

While you probably won't be too calorie deficient because your body has fat stores, you may not have enough vitamins, minerals, and protein to build new muscle and bone. An occasional fast won't hurt, but you wouldn't want to stunt yourself by not eating enough."

fasting,30o9sh,Reignofmongo,3,Sun Mar 29 05:00:39 2015 UTC,"This is just my opinion, but fasting to lose weight is suboptimal.  Fasting to give your body a break, to rest the stomach, pancreas, liver and kidneys, not to mention your spleen and large and small intestines, is great - you will dump a load of material your body would probably prefer to not hold onto, and you will find that your body will start to repair itself once you're not spending so much energy on digestion.  The weight you lose while fasting is in my opinion a byproduct of that cleansing: your colon will have a chance to partially empty, and your body will need to carry less water as a result. There will be some fat loss and some muscle loss - more muscle loss the more anaerobic exercise you do while fasting.  If weight loss is your only goal - and it's a good one, don't get me wrong - then I'd suggest you're doing a lot already to replace your body fat with muscle, and to reduce your overall weight.  Longer term fasts are usually for the morbidly obese and those seeking healing benefits from a digestion rest.  All that being said, you should try a longer fast out. If you do, I'd suggest you target a seven day fast, and go easy on the exercise - be gentle and see how you feel. You will lose muscle whether you exercise or not so be prepared for that. You can always grow it back! And your body will tend to break down the more aged, less healthful muscle first, so in a way you're upgrading your body faster.  My other suggestion is to keep reading as much as you can absorb, and to reflect on what you're doing regularly.  All the best - good luck."
fasting,30n4bh,tosh123no,3,Sat Mar 28 22:20:40 2015 UTC,"How long did you fast for?  Assuming you fasted for a week, give yourself a couple of days to get back into the eating pattern you're targeting.  When you break your fast, do it with a fruit like papaya or watermelon. Don't overindulge - chew the fruit thoroughly to aid your digestion, and remember your digestive system has had a relatively long break and as resilient as it is, will appreciate incremental steps.  Try to find some decent digestive enzymes to help get back into eating. You can take them just before or just after eating - it doesn't matter too much.  Have a few slices of fruit at first, the a few hours later have a few more.  The next food I break with is cooked vegetables - just one or two types, usually carrot and onion, which I cook in a soup. Drink the broth too. Avoid any of the more fibrous veg at this stage, like broccoli and cabbage.  The next food can be raw veg, like lettuce and spinach. I wait until the second day for this. You can keep having small amounts of the fruits and cooked veg from before as well. And you can introduce the more fibrous veg back as well.  I usually start to feed my body with a tablespoon of olive oil or coconut oil from the second half of the first day of the break.  If you're a meat eater you can reintroduce protein on the second day, starting with eggs, cooked how you like. Try fish first, then a day later chicken, then a day later beef or lamb etc.  Just keep listening to your body. Don't overindulge or you'll just undo all the good you've done!"

Is it possible to cure body odor with a water fast?   That's hard to say from experience because we get used to our own smell, however poor diet apparently plays a big role in body odor, and when you're fasting you're not eating a poor diet.   Does anyone have any tips or advice to help with the hunger??   The hunger comes in short spells for 3 days, after that it doesn't return until your body actually runs out of nutrient reserves.

In this regard, would a dry fast, a water fast, and a fast that includes water, tea, and black coffee be metabolically equivalent?   I would assume that in terms of fat loss, the fast including coffee and tea would be the best. And in a dry fast, is it true that you reach ketosis more quickly than a water fast?"
fasting,30ianj,fastifguy,2,Fri Mar 27 19:21:12 2015 UTC,"Caffeine stimulates the production of catecholamines, which bind to the receptors on fat cells and trigger fat mobilization by activating hormone sensitive lipase, which then shuttles the fat out of the cell to be burned off, so in terms of fat loss, including caffeine would hurry things up I suppose.  With dry fasting, I'm not sure about entering ketosis quicker than a water fast, but the actual weight loss is faster because in order to get water, oxygen from the air bonds with hydrogen in your fat, so you would be consuming fat quicker, fat for water and ketones instead of just ketones. In this respect dry fasts aren't that dry really."

I'm dry fasting now, 20 hours in. I'll drink water when my body tells me to.   Also do dry fasts impact mental function?   Nope.   How long do you do dry fasts for?   I've only done 2 days dry before, 25 days on just water. I'm dry fasting now, I don't know how long it will be for but I'll drink water at some point then maybe alternate between wet and dry every 3 days for about 3 weeks I think?   Finally if a dry fast and a water fast are 0 calories why would a dry fast have more fat loss?

Watch your sugars, carbs, snacks, juices, and exercise a few minutes everyday, and do not overeat. That's the best bet for you.

I can remember months ago before fasting that I could smile as big as I could without having that 'stretchy' feeling.  This makes me think I lost much weight in the face as well. That's why I believe my smile looks different or feels different.  Now, I want to re-gain that weight back in my face, do you think it's possible to do this the healthy way?

Next, if you ARE morbidly obese, you should only do this with approval and supervision.  You will lose lots of lean body mass.  That is probably contrary to your overall objective, whatever it is.  IF you are sincerely looking to do something like drop a lot of weight in a small amount of time, then you should take a look at some of the calculators out there that show the minimum daily caloric intake and protein intake to prevent it from happening.  For me, it was something like 500 calories, but I don't recall the protein part.  If weight loss is your goal, pay /r/keto a visit.  The place is filled with success stories and great support.  I kicked off the year with a water fast of, I think, 6 days, then went 500 cal (once I discovered that I was doing more harm than good) for a few days, then went full-on keto, using numbers from the keto calculator.  I'm shedding pounds like nobody's business, and gaining muscle at the same time.  I went on an 18 mile bike ride yesterday for the first time in about a year, and feel great.  I've been eating a lot of really, really good food.  It is enjoyable, you just need to make some subtle changes and keep at it; time is what makes it work!  I weighed 214 lbs at the start of the year, and was at 185 the day before yesterday.  At that rate, even a much larger person should be quite pleased with the progress.  Please seriously reconsider such a long fast.  People do die doing extended fasts!  Certainly that isn't your goal."

Regarding losing lean body mass, please take a look at this.  I have not vetted the article, but it is saying about the same thing I had read and was told by others during my last fast.  You may wish to look at the references themselves, or find other articles on the subject.  What is your age and weight?  150 lbs is not very much at all, unless you are quite young or of a low stature.  Even at that, it is hard for me to think that fasting for weight loss would be in your best interest.  Rather, you'd be much better off pursuing a longer-term strategy for ideal health.  You want to replace your older eating habits with healthy, sustainable ones.  Doing a diet, such as keto, while meticulously monitoring your caloric intake and expenditure (by using myfitnesspal, and perhaps something like a FitBit), will incredibly enlighten you to what is going on with your body, and help very much to guide you towards healthier eating.  Again, I see the success stories every day, and it is for damn sure working for me.  You may wish to subscribe to /r/loseit as well, though I will say there don't seem to be the successes there nor the, oh, same mindset as in /r/keto.

fasting,2zyuk3,modernbenoni,1 point,Mon Mar 23 12:06:33 2015 UTC,In a water fast you get no protein. Without protein your body can't repair muscles as they get damaged through wear and tear and any other exercise. You absolutely will lose a lot of lean body mass. At 150lb 40 days is way too excessive and is a huge step up from the 7 days you're used to.

It was unsupervised, and I too was used to shorter fasts. I worked my desk job all during the fast.  As others have said, the main thing is to listen to your body. You can have a goal of 40 days, but be prepared to stop and feed yourself if natural hunger sets back in. If you continue past that point, you could literally starve yourself.   After day 2 or 3, you will be in solid ketosis and therefore the majority of your lean body mass will be spared. Your body does not cannibalize its lean muscle if there is fat to use.  Please let me know if I can share insight from my own fast! It was an extremely strenuous but powerful time for me, and though I'd never do it again, I'm extremely glad I chose to go through with it."

There are not necessarily more risks, though the body weakness during the fast might hit you harder--you would just need to know when to stop the fast.  Natural hunger, I have heard, is a hunger sensation in the throat that cannot be ignored. I personally have never hit this. However, if you have fasted for a long period of time, your appetite drastically fades--I definitely think you would notice if it suddenly strikingly returned.

Something to take into mind is that you should be drinking a broth or a drink that contains potassium.  Try heating up some water and adding in a little bit of KCl.  On day four is where I experienced the worst stuff.  I woke up that morning and I was feeling a little weak.  Along with the weakness that I had just shaken off, I was feeling rather tight and had a bunch of cramping in my legs.  This was due to not having enough potassium, though.  I broke down that afternoon, because I hadn't had anything to busy myself with, which left me with my body producing thoughts about food and whatnot.  I ate a half of a rotisserie chicken, a medium 2-topping pizza from dominos, a whole order of their cheesy breadsticks, and an order of cinnamon sticks with icing.  It was not pretty but damn did it feel good to be eating again.  I commend you for having more discipline than I.  If I can ever work myself up to it again I will try for 1 week.    For the future I would recommend finding a partner to fast with, making sure you are taking a multivitamin each day along with some nutrient broth, providing yourself with things to do and enjoy, staying clear of an taxing physical activities, and trying to sleep as much as possible.  I know exactly what you are talking about with the constant waking up in the middle of the night.  I'm guessing this is your body trying to tell you to get up and find some food for it.

With IF, it generally works because you end up with a caloric deficit.  You will still need to make sure that you are sitting below your TDEE on your non-fasted days and that includes the weekends.  You can eat, you should be sensible about it though.  IF is not a magic pill and it will test your will power, especially when you first start out.

Taking on too much too soon can sometimes crash so definitely be aware of that. In the end I guess I recommend whatever works for you, but again those alternate fast days are going to be tough at first specially if this is your first real go at fasting. Like nomore04 said.

Depending on how my body reacts to the 5:2, I may decide to adjust if it seems to difficult.   I will definitely figure out a calorie deficit plan. Honestly, until now, I hadn't given it a lot of thought due to the fact that I typically only end up eating enough to maintain my weight (if not a little less).

Starvation led to considerable alterations in basal metabolism including a significant (mean 3.6%) increase in resting metabolic rate.   It takes about 60 hours for the signs of slowing metabolism to show.  It is true, though, that if you decrease calorie intake for an extended time, your body weight will decrease and you metabolism will indeed slow a little. So, you may go from consistently losing to stalling. Maybe this is the reason for the ""starvation mode"" myth. In this case you'll have to recalculate your new calorie requirements.

fasting,2zeakw,Evgeny_,7,Wed Mar 18 06:59:21 2015 UTC,"From what I understand your body will only go into starvation mode (i.e. burn significantly fewer calories as before) once it's really at a very, very low weight and you are, quite literally, starving. And that makes sense, because the laws of thermodynamics are just that, a set of physical LAWS that don't change just because you eat at a deficit for a couple of months or fast for a while.   One reason why so many people believe in the starvation effect is because during fasting or during a low calorie diet the body loses quite a bit of water, that is tied to the glycogen reserves in the liver. As soon as they start eating back at maintenance the glycogen reserves fill back up again and so does the water that's tied to it, leading to an increase in weight. Because the scale reads more, they think they must have gained fat because they messed up their metabolism."

For most of us if its 24 hours or less you're fine."

I know that I fast every night for probably 13-14 (between finishing dinner and having breakfast the next morning). But what about during waking hours? Is an 8 hour fast anything? Does it need to be 12  or 24 hours or more before it is really effective?"
fasting,2zeakw,just_pure_energy,2,Wed Mar 18 18:23:56 2015 UTC,"I've been counting calories and intermittent fasting for a few weeks averaging 19/5.  Its not a multi day fast but the principles are similar.  There is a metabolism shift, in the sense that your body has to adjust to a new feeding schedule.  It will be uncomfortable in the beginning passing your habitual mealtimes, but if you stick with it the hunger goes away.  You fast every night when you sleep, your body just adjusts and burns more fat.  In the morning your body expects that calorie rush, but once it knows that isn't coming anymore (a week? everyone is different), it'll just stay in that fat burn mode and you'll feel fine.  As for slowing ones metabolism and starvation, what happens is someone who has never fasted before goes from a multi-meal day full of carbs to a salad for a week straight, and their body freaks out.  They are use to pumping out insulin and the body can't adjust to such a large caloric energy need from fat oxidation that quickly so it breaks down muscle to get sugar.  It slows down your metabolism, makes you weak, because your body thinks it may never eat again so it clings to every calorie.  And the person feels TERRIBLE and they say fasting doesn't work!  You still have to eat enough calories, just at a TDEE deficit, in order to lose weight.  No, fasting won't break your metabolism.  It isn't magic. It takes discipline and willpower, as all weight loss does."

fasting,2za4tq,91jf,4,Mon Mar 16 21:58:41 2015 UTC,"I really want to fast more often. Something like one 24 hour fast per week and a couple of 3-8 day fasts in a year.   This is close to what I'm doing recently. I fast 36 hours once a week, and a longer 4-6 days fast every 3 months. I also lift and exercise in the morning in the fasted stated. Anecdotally, I notice no negative effects on my performance, including working out at the end of a 36-hour fast. So some science below:   However, I'm concerned about losing muscle mass and strength.   Don't be. There is some good evidence gathered in Brad Pilon's book ""Eat Stop Eat"" - a great book on short term fasting.   Research completed back in 1987 found that a three and a half day fast caused minimal impairments in physical performance measures such as isometric strength, anaerobic capacity or aerobic endurance13. In other words, they found that a three-day fast had no negative effects on how strongly your muscles can contract, your ability to do short-term high intensity exercises, or your ability to exercise at moderate intensity for a long duration.  Ref: Knapik JJ, Jones BH, Meredith C, Evans WJ. Influence of a 3.5 day fast on physical performance. European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology 1987; 56(4):428-32  Another study performed in 1988 found no change in soldiers who were exercising until exhaustion either right after a meal or after fasting for three and half days14.  Ref:Knapik JJ, Meredith CN, Jones LS, Young VR, Evans WJ. Influence of fasting on carbohydrate and fat metabolism during rest and exercise in men. Journal of Applied Physiology 1998; 64(5): 1923-1929   Now the following three references are technically not about fasting, but a low calorie diet. Still, this is evidence that drastically reducing calorie intake does not necessarily cause muscle loss.   Research on men and women undertaking a very low calorie diet found that even with a 12 week long diet consisting of only 800 Calories and only 80 grams of protein per day, the people in the study were able to maintain their muscle mass as long as they were exercising with weights three times per week.  Ref:Bryner RW. Effects of resistance training vs. Aerobic training combined with an 800 calorie liquid diet on lean body mass and resting metabolic rate. Journal of the American College of Nutrition 1999; 18(1): 115-121  In another study, men restricted their caloric intake by eating 1,000 Calories less per day than they normally ate for 16 weeks. They took part in a weight training program 3 days a week and were able to maintain all their muscle mass while losing over 20 pounds of body fat!  Ref:Rice B, Janssen I, Hudson, R, Ross R. Effects of aerobic or resistance exercise and/or diet on glucose tolerance and plasma insulin levels in obese men. Diabetes Care 1999; 22: 684-691  In yet another study, women undertaking a reduced calorie diet for 16 weeks were also able to maintain their muscle mass by training with weights three times per week.  Janssen I, et al. Effects of an energy-restrictive diet with or without exercise on abdominal fat, intermuscular fat, and metabolic risk factors in obese women. Diabetes Care 2002; 25:431-438   Finally, there was a more recent study which found out that 24 hour fasting greatly increased levels of Growth Hormone both in men and women. These are some great news for all fasting athletes out there!  www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110403090259.htm   Routine periodic fasting is good for your health, and your heart, study suggests  This recent study also confirmed earlier findings about the effects of fasting on human growth hormone (HGH), a metabolic protein. HGH works to protect lean muscle and metabolic balance, a response triggered and accelerated by fasting. During the 24-hour fasting periods, HGH increased an average of 1,300 percent in women, and nearly 2,000 percent in men."
fasting,2za4tq,Evgeny_,1 point,Tue Mar 17 07:57:31 2015 UTC,Say more about the 3-8 day fast! Curious what turned you onto the longer fast. Just water -- or restricted calories?
fasting,2za4tq,eatsardines,2,Thu Mar 19 07:02:30 2015 UTC,"Essentially, I'm convinced with the benefits of short-term (up to 3 days) fasting - there was a lot of research done and overall results are positive.  However, I didn't find much on long-term fasting - i.e. 10 days or longer. There is a lot of anecdotal evidence though, with people reporting all kinds of diseases healed and in general clear state of mind, lack of hunger and a lot of energy.  One of most entertaining pieces I read was ""Starving your way to vigor"" (which can be found at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/notablenotes/0Fb-owCiTYk). The authour describes his own experience, and also the story of the doctory Henry S. Tanner from the 19th century, who stumbled on fasting when he decided to starve himself to death because his wife left him. Instead, he cured himself of his illnesses and went on to promote fasting.  Anyway, I just want to eventually experience myself what is it all about. ""Trouble"" is, I luckily have no ilnesses I may expect to be cured from, but I'll settle with a clear mental state and lack of hunger if it happens. :)  Yes, ideal approach is just water, but I drink coffee from time to time. But no calories. I've only fasted up to 4 full days so far, but I expect to extend this by about a day every 3 months."
fasting,2za4tq,Evgeny_,1 point,Thu Mar 19 14:07:03 2015 UTC,"I loved that Harpers article. Read it a couple of years ago when my dad was fighting cancer. One of the most interesting insights for me was why there is such a (relative) lack of funding for such a (relative) promising treatment/medicine/life: It's hard to market fasting...""Bullet proof coffee"" is probably the only ""brand"" I know that's tried -- and they've done an awesome job selling coffee + butter.   I'm full on IF and regular 32-36 hour fasts. I'm also trying to deadlift 4 plates and get much stronger on my bike. So not sure how to balance the fuel + strength + cardio triangle. Conventional wisdom is that you should bias one, might be able to juggle two (LG/IF) but no way is possible to do all three at same time: HIIT + Deadlift + Fast... What do you think?"
fasting,2za4tq,eatsardines,2,Thu Mar 19 17:58:29 2015 UTC,"Please don't mistake me for an expert here. :)  But my personal opinion is that conventional wisdom is right in the sense that if you have multiple disciplines you are trying to get better at, you will not get as good in any of them, as if you concentrated on one.  Ok, that sounds like a mouthful. Let's say your ""full potential"" is 250kg deadlift, or maybe 1:30 1km trial on a bike (I totally don't know how they measure bike performance).  So that's what you can reach with perfect training, but you have to select one.  On the other hand, if you train for both, maybe you'll achieve 220kg deadlift and 1:45 trial time.  But you will be a more ""well rounded"" athlete. So, either peak performance in one discipline, or being balanced across more than one but peaking in neither. It's a matter of choice.  I don't see LG/IF as a limiting factor. Maybe you will not be able to push as hard as you'd like every time, I'm not sure.  I actually eat and train close to LG on weekdays: gym is around 7am, fasted, first meal is lunch around noon. I fast from late on Monday until around noon on Wednesday, and Tuesday is day off from training. But I don't train for strength (as in 1RM) anymore, and my main 2015 goal is achieving a handstand so I frequent /r/bodyweightfitness :)  Edit: sorry - looked at your history and I remember your thread on Anti-Fragility in /r/leangains.

I had a lot of difficulty with this last one, so while I'd like to work up to a full 7 days at some point, I think I'll stick to 72 hours for now, and wait until the summer, when I find I'm less hungry (winter tends to be a chow-down time for me, especially given the cold climate I live in) to try for longer (perhaps 4, 5 days at first). I also find it hard to go beyond 3 days because I become so lethargic it's hard for me to work, so fasting while at work isn't that practical at this point, even with a sedentary job."

I had some medical issues I thought fasting would help me out with, and indeed I feel pretty good now compared to last August.  3 days every three months is fine on top of your IF. You will probably find, as I have, that your relationship with time will change: once I had these ""breaks"" hard wired into my calendar, the time between is just long enough to pay attention to an aspect of my life I want to work on. This last quarter it's been exercise and meditation; the one before that was about quitting wheat and some other processed foods; the next quarter?

I understand that this means consuming small amounts of artificial sweeteners, etc, but alas. It was helpful and refreshing. Tomorrow I am repainting my childhood bedroom with my mom. Should be pretty mellow and a good thing to do!  Oh and hunger was bad at points today but I just distracted myself or walked away from food in order to forget about it. I did not do any intense exercise today. May try to jog or at least go for a long walk tomorrow.   I also did a lot of reflection. I laid on my back at one point and 'checked in' with all parts of my body and 'asked' them how they are doing and what I (my mind) could do to improve the time that we spend together. It may sound crazy but it was really helpful and meditative for me. For example, my toes want me to wear proper sized shoes when I run so that they don't lose their toenails. And my stomach was frustrated but thankful for the rest time. Skin wants to be stripped of oils less. Overall, this exercise provided insight and kind of weird intuitive stuff for me.  I also thought a lot about what's going on in my life that is bringing me down, that I'd like to improve on, that I need to face and deal with... Pretty uncomfortable but felt productive.

The type of IF that fits me well is to eat every other 24 hours. I usually make the cutoff at 2pm. So from 2pm until 2pm the next day I don't eat anything, then from 2pm until 2pm the day after that, I eat pretty low-carb paleo.  I'm a long time advocate that the body has two fuels, carbs and fat, and if we eat low enough carb for long enough, we will become 'fat adapted'. Becoming 'fat adapted' takes a few weeks, around four to six. So you will be a bit sluggish for the first four or so, but then as your body re-tools to be good at turning fat into fuel, you will notice the shift and life will change for the better.  So having said all that, when you are fat adapted, you will eat a lot less generally. A couple of summers ago I was doing CF three times a week, riding my bike to work (and to CF) six days a week for 20mi a day. For one month I ate only lunch. I made it a big salad, or bacon and eggs, or avocado on a burger with sweet potato fries, etc. Something different every day since it was my only nutrition.   But again, I ate one time a day, every 24 hours, for one month, with plenty of exercise both CF and cycling, and it was fantastic. I lost those extra pounds, I was never hungry, and life was good. BUT, I think this was possible only after I was fat adapted.  My $.02, hope it's helpful!  UPDATE: Oh, one more point about the migraines. As you probably know, MANY things can be the cause of migraines, so it's impossible to say now you will be affected. BUT, when fasting, your body heals itself in ways it simply cannot when it has continuous calories. Second, I've read about and talked to many people that had great success in the migraine area by going strictly paleo, so if you aren't very strict with your paleo (being a CFer, I am making an assumption that you eat paleo) I would say to do that for sure. I can't eat paleo and especially low-carb paleo and eat three meals a day, it's just too much food.  So I would think that fasting can only help the migraines. Having said that, I know people that their migraines got worse before they got better, so there is that, unfortunately.  UPDATE 2: OH!! I can't believe I forgot to say this. Absolutely stop eating wheat if you do. That alone can cause migraines, not to mention all the other negative health issues with wheat."
fasting,2z5o7k,jeremyvaught,2,Mon Mar 16 18:21:24 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the well-thought answer! I had no idea wheat caused migraines! I usually eat whole grain, but its good to know still. As for the paleo diet... my diet is protein based, but I don’t follow  paleo strictly.  Right now, I have fasted 16hrs, and im on my feeding window, till 8pm (its almost 5pm right now). I had a good lunch, medium sized really, and have been munching on almonds/ drinking a lot of water.  I  don’t feel hungry; overall I feel good but very sleepy/dizzy. .. I just got a migraine but I’m going to wait till 6pm to see how I feel for a work out.  I don’t like lifting heavy weights when I’m dizzy. I’m going to have dinner around 7 and then fast till 1pm tomorrow again.    The 24hrs IF sounds interesting and I would like to try it, but I feel like I need to ease into it! This week, at least, I’m going to keep the 16/8 schedule, maybe reduce it to 20/6.  I’m just worried about Crossfit; once I didn’t have lunch and did a heavy snatch and got so dizzy I almost dropped the bar on myself! And something similar always happened when I skipped lunch for whatever reason. With IF Im going to teach my body to… survive on less, I guess.  Be more effective with what it´s getting.  When you say that the body survives on carbs and fats, what do you mean by fats exactly? Like fatty food? I don’t eat greasy/fried/calorie-saturated stuff and try to eat as less carbs as I can (my weak point are sweets! :\ ) Does  Fat adapted would mean for my body to survive on the fats it has already stored? Also, when you fasted every 24hrs, what kind of food did you eat? I’m assuming it had to be a very filling meal, around 600cals maybe? I´m going to try to get it up to that point eventually :)"
fasting,2z5o7k,jeremyvaught,2,Mon Mar 16 22:03:30 2015 UTC,"Good questions.  First, wheat can be the cause of your migraines, I'm not saying it is without a doubt. Maybe even before you do much fasting you should check out Whole30. It is a program where you eat super clean for a month, and slowly add back less clean food one at a time to find out what is causing issues with you. It's a great program.  I totally get you don't want to lift heavy when dizzy. :) That's just survival.  So here is what I'm hearing by what you are saying. I'm hearing you say you get low blood sugar pretty easily, which is causing the dizziness, especially with less food. So let me talk again about fat vs carbs because it's very related to the dizziness/food stuff.  So as I said, there are two fuels that the body uses, fat and glucose (carbs). When you are eating carbs, your body uses that to fuel itself. And what it can't use, it stores as fat. However, if carbs are low, like less than 20-50 grams a day, that isn't enough to fuel your body, so it switches to fat to fuel itself. Fat fuel however is less efficient than glucose fuel if your body isn't used to it. (think if you have ever bonked on a long endurance exercise, that is the body running out of glucose and switching to stored fat)  So if you force the body to fuel with fat instead of glucose, it gets better at it and your capabilities on fat fuel go way up. The other advantage is that you don't have blood glucose drops that cause dizziness.   Sugar (carbs) are pretty new to us humans. We are designed to run on mostly fats and protein. The carb abundance of today is totally unnatural to us, and the result of this is a whole other discussion. For now, I'll just say it is horribly bad, and I encourage you to look more into that.  So what do I mean by fat? I mean fat you consume as well as stored fat. Quality fat that you consume is things like avacado, coconut oil, almonds, quality saturated fats like those that are in grassfed beef, etc. You are correct in avoiding fried foods, that's not good fat.  So being fat adapted means you would be fueling your body with consumed fat as well as stored fat, yes.  The food I eat on my IF is low-carb paleo. So whole foods (nothing processed) like bacon and eggs, salads, fish, berries, nuts, meat, etc. No (or very very little) dairy, grains, sugar, starchy veggies, legumes, etc. Standard paleo stuff.  I don't count calories. If I count anything, it's carb grams. But on low-carb paleo, you can eat as much as you want. IF simply doubles down on the benefits and adds more. Fasting is much more than simply eating less, your body does many wonderful things while fasted that it doesn't do under caloric load.  I believe everything I've talked about here is also talked about in the whole30 book. It's the best overview of all the nutrition things I've learned in the last five years, which is VERY different that what I was taught previously, and for the most part is still being taught to everyone that doesn't look deeper. But there are some things starting to shine through like the cover of Time magazine a few months ago with a story about how we're wrong about saturated fat and the USDA earlier this year stating there is actually no evidence that consuming cholesterol affects heart disease, despite that that is exactly what they've been saying for generations. Again, these are whole other discussions for another time, but they shed light on the fact that what we've always been told about nutrition may not be accurate.  Finally, if I were to say two things to do right away, they would be   Stop eating wheat Stop eating sweets   Finally-finally: Wow, this was long. :)"

fasting,2z5o7k,nomore04,1 point,Tue Mar 17 01:45:49 2015 UTC,"Hey soliloquios,  Its great that you want to do a fast. Good for you! :)  First off I will say that I am not qualified to give advice but can provide some anecdotal thoughts that might help you.  I think with any change/big change to your diet, you should ease into it slowly so that you are comfortable with the effects and have the confidence to either continue what your doing or change it up.   1) Regarding timing of meals, If your current window of eating is 12hrs then I would reduce that to 11hrs, 10 hrs, 9 hrs etc and see how your body reacts and how that affects your training.   2) 16/8 is good. When your ready go to a 18/6 arrangment.  3) Typically they mean a Water fast only. Drinking only water during the fast. If you haven't entered into ketosis much in your life then the first few days of the fast will be a struggle, I would advise taking time off working out and work so that you can rest during this transitional period.  4) I'm not sure about the migraines. I would look into what causes the migraines and how your diet changes affect it.   Good Resources Youtube - Dr Alan Goldhammer Youtube - Tanglewood Fasting Center  I say all of the above as I think too many changes to quick will burn you out and also it is interesting for yourself to do incremental changes to see how your body reacts   To sum up, Dont believe anything I say, You should do your own research first and feel comfortable with whatever changes you want to make.   Good luck, Fasting is awesome! :)"

fasting,2yt8fn,Sleeveless9,2,Thu Mar 12 19:00:11 2015 UTC,Breaking a fast is HARDER that fasting. Once you get into the fast its easy because your stomach is OFF. Once you turn that puppy back on then you have to deal with biological cravings and the psychological temptation to EAT EVERYTHING!! it took me about 3-4 long fasts (2-4 weeks) before I broke a fast in a manner I was happy with.
fasting,2yt8fn,BlackOpz,2,Fri Mar 13 14:06:50 2015 UTC,You're never as polluted as the first couple times. Its not that it gets easier as much as it gets less painful until its basically a non-issue.

fasting,2ypxgk,WaterFastLoss,3,Wed Mar 11 20:53:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, unless you start feeling bad then stop. No, not unless you want to. Impossible to predict because it varies very much between people. Also note that a big part of what you'll loose will be water weight which you'll gain right back. You can do anything and everything. I think pure vitamins won't break the fast so be careful that you're not taking vitamins with added sugar. As a human being I advice you to stop using weight loss diet pills but I have no idea about the effects they have on fasting. Not if you hit ketosis. Have you ever fasted before? If you haven't then you'll probably experience mental clarity/cognitive focus that you've not experienced before and I hope you realize what your anorexic/bulimic behavior stems from and that this fast will help you get over it.   But first and foremost be careful and listen to your body."

I think women are supposed to hit ketosis around day 3 and men about a day earlier (or was it the other way around, can't remember). You can get into ketosis by doing a low carb diet (less then 50g of carbs a day for 3-4 days) and I once hit ketosis by accidentally (wasn't trying to hit ketosis) eating low amounts of carbs for a few days and then fasting for 17 hours (ate an hour later then I usually do because of work, I do IF).  You will definitely not only hit it if you exercise."

Fasting for six days is hard and you don't want to tax yourself anymore than necessary, otherwise you simply won't be able to stick with it. Also, keep in mind that being in ketosis isn't the only way to lose weight, so don't worry too much about hitting it as early as possible. So many people lose weight by simply going on a calorie deficit, which you will be in from day 1."
fasting,2yougm,dotaslayer,13,Wed Mar 11 16:09:33 2015 UTC,Your fast will start with a much bigger blood sugar crash.  This means the first day will be hungrier and more unpleasant than it would have otherwise.

Last time I did 21 days I lost 14 kg! How did I put them back on? A lot of food :D I started binge eating right when I was finished. It was hell and heaven at the same time! I didn't start slowly... I ate maybe 4000 kcal first day. The night was hell, but the body quickly adapted to the normal routines next day! I didn't really care that much about the weight... but now I do! I have 25 BMI, I want it on 20 :D I 21 days dont do it... then I will continue till I hit the mark. And I will be careful about what I eat the next days after fasting. Slowly build up calories.  I learned so much doing it. It is totally mental thing. I could totally trick myself to feeling like the worst day in my life, but if I focused and tried to tell myself I have never felt better etc. etc. I really felt awesome... the psyche is weak and very receptible to everything... that is of course good and bad...

The main difficulty I've experienced has been mental - the realisation that the next time I eat will be next week. That's a fairly depressing thought but I'll try and take it one day at a time.   Hopefully I don't have any problems getting to sleep because I normally struggle to get to sleep when I'm this hungry. I've drank 2.25L of water today and I'm hoping to have around 3L of water tomorrow. I'm expecting tomorrow to be extremely tough but I just need to get through it and hopefully it'll get easier after that.

fasting,2ymrii,OnACoffeeBreak,1 point,Wed Mar 11 14:29:06 2015 UTC,"Ok, its basically a fad diet that I invented.  I bought a cheap 2-pack of wrapped processed cheese slices - 32 slices, each 70 calories, mostly from fat.  Every two hours, or whenever I think about food, I have a slice or two.  So probably about 6-8 slices per day, totalling 400 to 600 calories. The advantage I see is it helps keep me in ketosis. I don't get the insulin response I would get from carbs or protein. So I can enjoy the taste without craving more.  And its easier than doing a strict water fast.  I really don't have the will power to do a strict fast more than about 2.5 days.  I'm going to try this as an experiment and see where it goes."
fasting,2ymrii,OnACoffeeBreak,0,Thu Mar 12 02:59:38 2015 UTC,"I see.  What is your diet like otherwise?  I find the cleaner I eat the easier fasting is as those useful nutrients are still in my body for days.  Processed cheese slices is what I would consider junk food, so if the rest of your diet is along those lines maybe that's your problem.  Up the ante on quality foods and I bet you can go farther.  Just my two cents.  If this works for you there is no reason to change anything."

Everything went as expected on day one:   slight headache that comes and goes. Water helps. intermittent feeling of hunger, but I had no problems not partaking in a basketball-related pizza party at work and hanging out with the family at dinner time difficulty sleeping happens every single time on day 1. I am a light sleeper to begin with, but on day 1 I sleep even lighter.    Went for a short run/walk yesterday afternoon. Felt good afterwards.  Not going to step on the scale until the morning I break the fast. Plan for day 2:    get as much work done in the morning at the peak of mental/physical energy walk at lunch yoga at night time rebuild wife's PC since the parts should be arriving this afternoon"
fasting,2ymrii,OnACoffeeBreak,1 point,Thu Mar 12 12:16:16 2015 UTC,"Day 2: pretty normal fasting day. No real hunger pangs. Minor headaches from day one are down to feeling like some pressure.   Tried taking a 30-minute nap in the afternoon, but wound up laying in bed for 20 minutes unable to sleep. Still felt more energetic after it. In general, I seem to have more energy than on my first 8-day fast three years ago.  Did 30 minutes of yoga and 20 minutes of bodyweight core circuit. Less than usual, but didn't want to overdo it. This much felt good. Walked for 30 minutes.  Slept better than at the end of day 1. Overall a pretty mellow fasting day.  Plan for day 3: run/walk 30 minutes at lunch. Avoid family drama."

The good news is that by day 3 you will lose a lot of your hunger.  They were medically supervised though, in safe conditions.  One of the things you really need to watch out for is fainting and getting a head injury, falling down some stairs, etc.    I doubt you will want to take a walk after 4 days or so.  In my experience I just felt like laying down and conserving energy.  My brainpower was dialed way back as well.  If you are on any medication you need to be very careful.  For example if your blood pressure drops a lot and you are taking medication for hypertension that could be a problem.  I have heard that three days on your own is safe and doable."

fasting,2y38eo,FastingFatty,2,Fri Mar 6 01:25:55 2015 UTC,"Can you explain to them that at the end of the day you get the same calories as they do, or as many as you need? I'm assuming you just want to eat at maintenance now so it shouldn't (hopefully) be too hard to convince them that you're eating enough.  You have a couple of choices.  5:2 seem to be easy to hide for them if they won't listen. You eat normally or even slightly above maintenance 5 days a week, and then you eat under 500-600 calories twice a week.  Second choice would just be a simple noon - > 8pm, 8 hour eating schedule. That can't possibly sound crazy to anybody. Eat dinner and lunch with them and a little inbetween if needed."

fasting,2y38eo,Vaztes,2,Fri Mar 6 07:14:56 2015 UTC,"16/8 and 5:2 both work great. I think it's just a question of which is easier for you to get away with, so to speak.  5:2. It's less strict in terms of counting calories since it's simply harder to overeat when you almost eat nothing for two days. If we're to assume your maintenance is 2500 then you'll be down 4000 calories at the end of each week. If your maintenance is even higher- you'll lose even more.  The usual 500 calories less than maintenance a day ends up at 3500 a week, so 5:2 is just as effective if not even more so for a guy your height and weight. It also does allow you to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner if your parents are that strict. As long as you can find two days in a week to fast."

Do you have a paper trail to show it is not an eating disorder but a methodical and logical approach to lifestyle changes that will benefit your health? People with eating disorders are not worried about being healthy. Demonstrating it is for your health is probably the best argument.   Are you still in high school? You could always skip school lunch and breakfast most days to get to a 20:4 fasting schedule.   You could also bargain for things like ""if you want me to eat , then I want us to buy healthier food options"" or ""I will eat 3 meals a day with you but I get to determine the number of calories I consume as determined by scientific calculators of caloric needs.""  Are your parents out-of-shape? You could challenge them to count their caloric intake for a day and see just how much they consume and show them what a healthy range is.   Bottom line: try to be patient and turn this frustration into a growing experience for everyone involved."

Nah just finished school, but yeah could probably get away with skipping them both as I'm usually out during the day either working or doing fun shit  My mother is convinced we eat healthy, which is pretty bs looking at some of the shit we eat, especially portion sizes that I used to get served before I started serving my own portions. And the fact that both of my parents are out of shape, especially my dad, is largely overweight (formerly obese) and had lap-band surgery to lose weight, but overeats and ends up vomiting his meals up every night, a worse eating disorder than I apparently have IMO. I feel like I'm basically giving myself a natural lapband surgery, shrinking my stomach and appetite through fasting, but for some reason that's not okay but forcibly shrinking a stomach with operations is...

Getting back to a healthy weight range via fasting is not a bad thing. The worst thing that might happen is losing some muscle through the drastic weight change but even that can be fixed pretty quickly through exercise.   At least you got as far as you did before they stopped you!  Good luck to you sir! Hopefully you can reach your goal weight via other methods.

fasting,2xwcua,Gimbalist,6,Wed Mar 4 11:48:24 2015 UTC,"I had a brief look and I personally would not recommend these sources, except the last one.  They contain a mix of actual correct information with pseudoscientific nonsense and a bunch of buzzwords.  First source, for example:   Most people starting a fast begin with an overly acid blood pH from the typical American diet that contains a predominance of acid-forming foods. Switching over to burning fat for fuel triggers the release of even more acidic substances.   Well, this just does not happen. The whole acidic/alkaline diet theory has no scientific base whatsoever - the body keeps the pH levels of blood very tightly regulated.  The second source starts more or less ok, but quickly deteriorates into the ""toxin"" territory.   The muscles may become tight and sore due to toxin irritation. The legs can be the worst affected as toxins accumulate in the legs.   The whole ""toxin"" thing is pretty much quackery.  This is a brief article that explains it well.  http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/dec/05/detox-myth-health-diet-science-ignorance  In short - if you want to talk toxins, at least give me the names of some. What specific toxins ""accumulate in the legs""? Can't name even one? Thought so. Might as well use ""evil spirits"" in place of toxins.  The third source has toxins right in the very first sentence.  The last source seems to be the most reasonable and only briefly mentions ""toxins"". It is also the only one to mention any scientific studies at all, but unfortunately references are only available in the printed book by the author. But a brief google search confirms that these studies do exist.  Interesting, how one study he refers to as ""severe toxic contamination has been shown to be significantly helped with fasting"" actually is about a specific substance, PCB, and it was a poisoning. Now in this context it is completely valid: they name what the exact toxin is, and they can measure its levels before, during and after fasting. This is science."
fasting,2xvrt6,cliteratimonster,4,Wed Mar 4 06:26:55 2015 UTC,"Hi there. Fasting needs to be planed. You have to have a schedule, similar to your work out plan. I'm no doctor, but if oyu are used to go to the gym 4 times a week, your body should be used to that. However, during fasting I would recommend to not push your limits. Remember you don't get the amount of ""fuel"" to do as much as you do normally. So a reduced work out should be okay, if you stick to your schedule and drink and eat what matches your fasting. If you go for a water fast, I would recommend to talk to your doctor first or do it together with a friend. During that time you should listen to your body. Messure your pulse is one way to see how you are doing."

Headaches for me indicate low sodium and a sip or two of beef broth cures it within minutes. I just hold the broth under my tongue for about a minute. You don't need the whole cup.   I've done a 15 day fast and I was practically worthless after about day six so I timed it around being off work. I could not workout after about day three, I had zero energy. But some people report more energy so I think it may be my overall lack of body fat. But that 15 days has changed my life and eating habits. I have more energy and will power for everything.   Since I started doing a 48hour fast once per week it's been really easy especially when compared to the 15 day fast. No headaches and no real hunger or loss of productivity. I feel really good the days after the fast and all my blood lipid parameters have been outstanding.

Understand that the mind will often adopt the needs of the body as its own.  The mind is a problem solving tool, so it needs problems to exist.  It also tends to exaggerate problems, b/c it only sees the world in terms of problems and obstacles and challenges.  There is nothing wrong with this, that is the function of the mind, but don't be fooled into thinking your mind knows best.  When the mind adopts a problem of the body it takes a minor issue and makes it an international crisis.  Your stomach is empty and you are hungry.  This is just a physical sensation.  Your body is sending a gentle reminder that it would like some food.  Compare this to the feeling of a broken leg.  That is not a gentle reminder.  Your mind takes your stomachs gentle reminder and creates an emergency out of it.  Your mind says we are starving, eat soon or we will die.  However, if you ignore your mind and listen to your body, it is simply saying food would be nice, but we are okay down here.  Make a habit of listening to your body directly."

When you get diagnosed with diabetes, they tell you that it is a degenerative disease and that nothing you can do will make it better. You are doomed to go from medication to medication until you need insulin, and then you will need higher and higher doses. If you manage to live long enough, it will eventually take your feet, destroy your organs, and give you heart disease.  I have always been overweight, and I have been on every diet there is. Maybe it's just me, but I find fasting easier than dieting. I don't feel any hungrier on a fast than I did on some of the extreme diets I tried, and the results are better. And there's something magical about the fourth day. I feel lighter. I am seeing numbers on the scale that I never thought I would see again. And I know that at the end of the day on Friday, I'm going to get that cheeseburger or super burrito, and I don't have to feel guilty, because I've earned it."

When it came back just as strong, I decided to end the fast.    I've pretty much been on a cleansing diet for the past 3 weeks, eating only a basic vegan diet.  I started the vegan diet for other health reasons as an experiment.  I haven't gotten the results that I thought I would, but I plan on sticking to it another couple/few weeks.  I had figured now would be a good time to try a longer than 24hr fast, but I think I'll try again later when I'm more mentally capable, too much going on right now.

I'm curious about other lifestyle choices you make,   This fast is to help me gain perspective to make the right decisions and changes for my lifestyle.  I can tell you that an enormous amount of what my life is and has been has been driven simply by attempting to satisfy my ego.  Also, when I wouldn't satisfy my ego I would go into in denial as to the reasoning why it wasn't satisfied.  The desire to satisfy my ego has not helped me grow at all.  We choose to let ourselves suffer based on our desires.  If we don't get our desires we kick ourselves before we think to analyze if the desire was actually something worth wanting.    up to the fast and during, ie, are you celibate before/during this time?    I am celibate in this time from as many pleasure seeking activities as I can.  The idea is to listen and process my inner self without the constant chatter from the body demanding this and that.     How much exercise or physical activity do you exert?   I did a really intense workout on day 3 and felt amazing but once ketosis set in I'm mainly sitting or lying down and staying warm.  Walks are highly recommended.  Gets your breathe deeper and you can go as slow as you want for comfort and contemplation.    Do you read books on fasting and diet during the fast, or have other ways of mentally keeping yourself focused?   I've been mediating 2 1-hour sessions a day to really tune in to my body.  This can be very difficult in the days where the aches are present.  Really, anything other than lying down with your face smashed into a pillow is hard during that time.  Reading is good, I've been reading Discourses by Epictetus as it's in the spirit if self contemplation.    NO CHEATING food wise.  If you eat the smallest bit of anything after ketosis you become savagely hungry and makes you feel awful if you don't eat more.    This last one is the toughest for me, especially across several days.    You've really gotta hit a turning point where you are willing to do whatever is necessary to be truthful to yourself.  Usually we spin some kind of reasoning to break the fast early.  Paying attention to the root of the thought can teach you not only about that train of thought but other situations where you also found yourself tricking yourself into doing something that wasn't something you'd feel good and right about in the long run.  Trust yourself and you will unravel wondrous riddles in yourself."

Suddenly I was eating constantly, and no amount of food or pain was convincing enough to stop.   I eat fairly healthy. The meals are home made for the most part, and almost always organic.

I had a similar period like that once when I did an internship in a new city, didn't know anyone, hated my job, had no hobbies whatsoever, no money to go out to museums and other places, and also no imagination to come up with something fun to do that didn't cost money. I was very lethargic and food was literally the only thing during those weeks that I looked forward to. Fortunately, my internship only lasted 4 weeks and when I was back in my regular environment with friends and hobbies, food just naturally became less important.

I fast 3-5 days per week almost every week. I take potassium, magnesium, Vit-D, calcium supplements. The minerals are to keep the leg cramps away and I take the D because at my latitude there aren't strong enough light rays (UV-B, I think but I could be wrong) to create D in my skin from October to March. Since I have been supplementing with D I get fewer colds and flu during the winter. I do plain water fasts and lots of it, another reason I need the mineral sups and they don't upset my stomach like a multi or other vitamins such as B. I do drink black coffee in the morning while fasting because I am an addicted to caffeine and don't like the ten-penny-nail-thru-the-eyeball headaches.   Also, I found juicing makes it harder for me but YMMV. I was on a 4 day fast once, shooting for 5 and had water with lemon and it was over, I had to eat so now I avoid that till the end.  I think broth would be a refeed when you decide to break your fast.  If you are just starting keto I'd drop the carbs for a while before embarking on any fasting.

fasting,2wwbum,PastaFrenzy,3,Tue Feb 24 15:30:30 2015 UTC,Yup!  You of course can plan when you want to eat on your feed day.
fasting,2wwbum,fastinguy11,2,Tue Feb 24 16:25:38 2015 UTC,Any tips on refeeding after a 3 day fast (assuming I ever do one)? I heard its easy to get sick or nauseous.

If you look on /r/keto you can see a lot of people have this amazing rush of energy and adrenaline/endorphins when they finally break into ketosis :)  I agree, the ""euphoria"" is an amazing feeling.

fasting,2wk2bl,nateliason,2,Fri Feb 20 18:48:13 2015 UTC,"Great article and it mirrors my experiences exactly, especially pertaining to the coldness sensitivity.  I am known for walking around the house with a t-shirt while everyone else is shivering in their sweaters but during my water fasts, from day 7 and on usually, I am wearing a full winter coat indoors during the winter months  The only difference between your fasts and mine is the bowel movement that happens on day 3-4 which is usually quite messy.  Oh.. and I also agree with your points on re-feeding (especially in regards to fruit ingestion) I have no medical evidence to back up this claim but my reasoning was right in line with yours when you consider the sugar spike levels.    I usually go on extended fasts, but I am going to attempt intermittent fasting on a 5/2 day cycle to see if that can improve my weights at the gym.    Great article and thanks for taking the time to write it"

It would be really awesome to know if 2000 calories is maintenance for you, then you can add cardio or some exercise to burn an additional 200 calories so you can eat the same amount of food, or cut out some if you feel you're up to it.  Just keep in mind, it's mainly calories in vs calories out, IF is just a tool to help with calorie control, but you still need to be in a deficit."

Someone recommended I do this and I realized I was eating more than I thought I was even though I was using measuring cups and tracking calories. Now I'm measuring in grams and ounces and seeing progress again!   Its a pain in the ass to be this precise, but it pays off to thoroughly check yourself. You don't have to do it every day though, you can eye ball it after a few days, then when you stop seeing progress again, spend a day measuring your food again to check your accuracy.   This is a new thing I'm trying out, maybe it can work out for you too!"
fasting,2wfldq,guyjeb,1 point,Thu Feb 19 21:48:31 2015 UTC,"I don't lose weight from fasting either, because I eat enough to compensate for it when I'm not fasting.   Try lowering your calorie intake by 100 and see how that goes. If it's not working, lower it again.   You could also try extending your fasting hours if you think that would help."
