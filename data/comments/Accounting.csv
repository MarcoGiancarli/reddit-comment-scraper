Accounting,3e49xy,zimmie41,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:40:25 2015 UTC,"Larger firms may need to hire 20 new staff, and they like to train new staff in groups, as it is the most cost effective.  So if your only method of attracting new applicants is your website you may not get enough qualified applicants  within a relatively short period of time to fill 20 positions.  Active recruiting seems to common with a lot of businesses that need to fill a large number of positions quickly.  The call centers in my area are always holding recruiting events on the campuses in my area.  They opened a nanotechnology center and held a few recruiting events.  It is pretty rare that anyone needs to hire 20 psychologists, or 20 historians, or 20 English teachers."

For me anything more than three hours in a single stretch and I start seeing the words rather than reading them and my productivity craters. Consider taking more breaks during the day so that you're not staring at the same thing continuously and not retaining anything.  As for study practices, getting questions wrong now is unimportant. Your goal with those is to read and understand the right and wrong answer explanations. That's what they are there for; if you're reading and understanding those that's a win. It means that you are less likely to miss it on the real exam; in addition, the questions on the exam will tend to be shorter and more focused than review questions."

Accounting,3e4ggx,Charityb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:10:20 2015 UTC,No problem! The questions in review are more for teaching purposes so you will frequently get questions where you have to calculate three or four different things or back into multiple missing variables. In the real exam they will frequently just give you all the information you need explicitly rather than making you puzzle it out. This will save you a lot of time relative to the review course.

If your goal is to transfer to something more prestigious in public, start networking inside your own company and building that professional reputation so that you can do that.

Almost no student comes in with the experience requirements already met so that won't affect you in terms of being able to get a job; as long as you make it clear that you will b eligible to sit for the exam soon (the end of the upcoming semester is very soon) you will be fine for internships and/or full-time jobs."

You earn your way in through high grades, technical meeting attendance, and community service. High accounting GPA shows employers you are good at learning, and the technical meetings and community service with BAP shows that you can be dedicated to doing something that is above the minimum. Most firms consider BAP students to be the top students at a university.  Accounting Society is usually more of a social club, depending on your school. At my school, there were no requirements to join, and members were not required to do anything at all. However, it's still worth a space of your resume.  You will miss out on the Beta Alpha Psi technical meetings at your school, unless they are open to non-members. These are very important networking opportunities. Does your school's AS have meetings where they invite recruiters? You won't be able to go to BAP regional and national meetings, which are amazing.  But it's not the end of the world.

That's a pretty big differential to make up in a struggling job market. If you're lucky and you get a nice 120k start up salary on Silicon Valley it's still only 30k or so more than staying in public (by then 4+years experience). Would take 10+ years to recover.  That's a long ROI for getting a lucky job. The only rich lawyers I know is one that great paying job after school or two that had a family law practice.   Maybe I'm ignorant on it all.

Also, look into your state's unemployment guidelines. Some states will grant you benefits after a certain period of time after voluntarily leaving your last position if you have not found work.

Accounting,3e3227,needaccountinghelp52,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:04:43 2015 UTC,The extended warranty is revenue that needs to be accrued over the life of the 2-year contract.  The replacement parts cost needs to be adjusted from expected to actual costs at year-end.
Accounting,3e3227,squat_some_more,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:12:57 2015 UTC,Yeah so I have 3282000 as the cash/AR you receive while having a revenue of 2320500 and unearned revenue as 961500.  So it is accrued over the 2 years along with 4 years for the other 900 people.  So this adjustment would be a change to the outstanding warranty liability instead of a change to revenue?   Dr Warranty Liability 178550  Cr Warranty Revenue 178550   EDIT:  Ok I think I understand what you mean from the first statement that is the extended part would be accrued over the 2 years meaning the 660 x 900 is a different revenue?  So the warranty unearned revenue would be (1050x350) + (900x660) = 961500  EDIT2:   DR Warranty Liability 5200  CR Warranty Revenue 5200   (expected 183750) - (actual 178550) = 5200?  EDIT3: Ok it seems like none of those are right I am now completely confused :(
Accounting,3e3227,squat_some_more,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:23:02 2015 UTC,Wait... I read that wrong. The cash from extended warranty sales is a liability until the 2 year period starts. No adjustment needs to be made for that. Revenue cannot be recognized until the 2-year extension starts. The JE should be:  D: Cash/AR  594000  C: Unearned Warranty Revenue 594000
Accounting,3e3227,squat_some_more,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:51:51 2015 UTC,"I am so confused can you explain what exactly is happening?  I know you did 660x900 = 594, 000 but why exactly are you doing that?  From my understanding you already got the cash for the additional 2 year warranty and it is simply placed under unearned revenue which was recorded in the previous JE now what I don't understand is what this adjusting entry is.  Shouldn't it be   DR Warranty Liability 5200  CR Warranty Revenue 5200 since you actually paid less than the actual amount?"
Accounting,3e3227,squat_some_more,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:57:46 2015 UTC,"OK, the JE from the sales of the $660 extended warranties are liabilities until the extension period starts. The earliest ones start in 2016. Thus, no revenue from extended warranties will be recognized in 2014, as it is all unearned. (This is a service contract.)  Costs from replacement parts must be offset against the allowance for replacement parts (liability), which is $350 per machine sold. Since 1050 machines were sold, the allowance should be $367500 at 2014 year end. This account needs to be debited at the end of the year by the actual costs of replacements."
Accounting,3e3227,threequincy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:18:18 2015 UTC,So let me get this straight you have an allowance account which should be 183750 at the end of the year since you have it for 2 years.  But you only reduced it by 178550?  What is this question asking me to do.
Accounting,3e3227,threequincy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:37:59 2015 UTC,You only reduce it by 178550 because that's the actual cost of replacement parts.   The extended warranty is actually there to throw you off.
Accounting,3e3227,threequincy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:44:23 2015 UTC,"So what would be the journal entry for this?  Like the journal entry for the answer to the question?  I don't even know what to do because the previous question was   Using the Revenue Approach, prepare the journal entry to record the warranty costs incurred during 2014.   And I put    Dr Warranty Exp 178550  CR Inventory 178550   And it was correct.  What am I doing now???"
Accounting,3e3227,threequincy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:53:45 2015 UTC,"You are confusing a regular warranty with an extended warranty.   For regular warranties, a customer pays nothing extra to you for repairs performed during the period covered by the warranty. You anticipate that there will be repairs needed, which will certainly cut into your profits made on product sales, so in order to accurately reflect the profitability of those sales you have to accrue a warranty expense (Rev - exp = Gross profit). The expense is valued at what you predict will be the warranty repair costs you will incur for the products you have sold. You then accrue a contingent liability because you may be obliged to actually pay that amount down the road. The liability is reduced when you actually perform warranty repairs.  Thus, you have the following (generic) entries:  To accrue the warranty expense inccured as the result of sales during the year:  DR: Warranty expense XX  CR:Warranty liability XX  To reduce the liability as the result of actual repairs during the year:  DR: Warranty Liabilty XX  CR: Cash             XX  For purchased extended warranties, a customer pays you a flat fee to continue providing repairs if needed beyond the period of the regular warranty. They are essentially buying a service on top of the product they bought the warranty for, so what they pay must be some kind of revenue. But since that service has not yet been delivered, the revenue is deferred. Thus, to record the purchase of extended warranties:  DR:Cash            XX  CR: Prepaid revenue            XX  Prepaid revenue is a liability as well, but it has nothing to do with the warranty liability from a regular warranty, They are fulfilled by entirely different economic events. In the case of prepaid revenue from extended warranties, you would think that the deferred revenue is recognized with the performance of actual repairs. This is not the case. Under GAAP you recognize the revenue on a straight line basis over the years covered by the warranty unless there is historical evidence that the revenue can be recognized in a different manner. The recognition of the revenue does not reduce the warranty liability accrued when the regular warranty was accounted for, they are completely different things.     Thus, at the end of each year COVERED BY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY, you'd make the following entry  DR: Prepaid Revenue (total prepaid rev divided by numer of years covered)  CR: Warranty revenue (same amount)  EDIT: What /u/squat_some_more was getting at is that the prepaid revenue does not get recognized at all during 2014, the reporting period which the question is asking about. Remember, the extended warranties kick in after the period covered by the original warranty. The original warranty goes from 2014 through 2015. The customers bought the warranties to cover repairs in 2016 through 2017. Thus, you do not recognize any of the prepaid warranty revenue  on Dec 31 2014. All that is going on during 2014 is a) stuff related to the regular warranty, so you just make the adjustment to the Warranty Liability in the amount of actual repair costs incurred. b) the purchases of the extended warranties, so you accrue the prepaid revenue for that and debit cash collected."
Accounting,3e1anw,alittletaxcurious,10,Tue Jul 21 04:46:06 2015 UTC,Where is the uniqueness?
Accounting,3e1anw,fekkai,2,Tue Jul 21 05:06:15 2015 UTC,"1) They are starting earlier and earlier, we have started putting together databases for FRESHMAN! Which I think is so crazy but it's happening. That doesn't mean you're late though, you'd just be going for a 1st year associate position rather than an sophomore leadership program or internship.   2) LinkedIn is fine but can be impersonal since tons of people do it. It's never a bad move but it shouldn't be your only move. My guess is emailing the recruiter would be the best and most effective way but phrase the email in a way that asks about what the firm's about rather than all your accolades and tax experience.   3) My experience with coming from a non-target is limited (my office right now is mostly people from the target campuses and/or experienced hires), but just in general, you want to get in touch with the recruiters from your closest office(s) whether you want to stay in the area or not. They are the ones who will put you in touch with professionals and invite you to events. You won't be working with recruiters, so after building the rapport with the recruiter, make sure to get to know as many professionals as you can, and having a professional vouch for you during the recruiting process will be very valuable  4a) I would say yes, there generally is an issue just showing up to another school's event. Many events the firms put on are school specific and are limited to that school's students. But as touched upon in #3, if you build rapport with the recruiters, they may say it's ok to come over to one of this school's meet the firms, or invite you to some of the firm-related events off campus. You want to ask about these but not demand.  4b) Don't be too aggressive about it. You seem driven but it needs to be controlled drive and not bang the door down drive. If you think about it, that's probably the one common trait between you and everyone else recruiting, literally everyone's looking for a job. So you want to differentiate yourself from those that are just throwing resumes and touting how great their summer experience was with accounting for their dad's restaurant. I'd say collectively the 4 firms want coachable people especially with the entry level associate positions. Those who are too aggressive can seem harder to coach in the limited face time you have with recruiters/professionals. You want to balance sharing your work experiences with getting to know the people, it'll help you more easily make the decision as to which firm you'll want to work for as a side benefit.   tl;dr You will need to be a little bit more proactive than someone from a target school in getting in touch with recruiters, but while we like finding people who are driven like you are, we generally don't like bang the door down aggression during the recruiting process."

Accounting,3e1jvr,VariableInterest,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:01:46 2015 UTC,Yeah the CFA is no joke. I'm not saying the CPA is but the CFA is long and computational in ways the CPA is not.  Bluntly if you don't have a finance background or don't like hard math the CFA is going to kick your ass. The designation has increased in prestige repetitively recently and can in some cases. definitely be a requirement for FA work.   Source: Master's in Finance/undergrad in Accounting currently sitting for the CPA. Decided this because 1) I can do the math but I don't like it 2) I dont see myself wanting to be a FA.
Accounting,3e1jvr,Dag-nabbit,2,Tue Jul 21 14:51:02 2015 UTC,Financial Analyst is a very broad term...a wall street analyst is much different than a financial analyst in a corporation. The CFA charter is much more well known within the investments community...doesn't give much advantage for PE/IB. So my suggestion is to think long and hard about what type of financial analyst you would like to be.   I have an MBA in Finance and I'm currently awaiting the results from the level III CFA exam. I currently work in profitability analytics at a bank.

Work with your universities career services.  In addition to providing leads, they can help beef up your resume.  One of things I would add is software you have experience with.  If your family business uses QuickBooks, make sure that is on your resume.  If you used any professional software during your internship, such as Prosystems, Peachtree, Creative Solutions Accounting, etc., add that to your resume.  If you are only interested in large multinational firms it might not make as much of a difference as they will generally have a training program.

Accounting,3dzpvx,Blu-,3,Mon Jul 20 21:03:08 2015 UTC,"You passed the exams...definitely look into what else you need to do to become a CPA (experience and education requirements mostly). Your state board will have this information at NASBA.org  Also look into if your exam scores expire (ie you passed all 4 but you need to experience and education within a certain time period or you have to retake it.) Not saying this is the case, but I don't know how that works and could see it being a problem.  Get a resume together. If the college you graduated from has an alumni or career service, see if they'll take a look at it/make recommendations. Ask if you can still apply to jobs through the career website. See if their is a school-wide career fair coming up that you can meet with potential employers and give a resume to.  Also, as it has been said on this sub before: big 4 is not all that exists in accounting. Look at mid-size and local public accounting firms (slightly less pay but they treat you more like a human on average). Look into industry jobs if they pay well and have advancement opportunities."
Accounting,3dy8az,ZotiBulku,6,Mon Jul 20 14:43:27 2015 UTC,"I'm a PhD and professor of accounting at an upper-tier teaching school. u/Tamerlee is right. A PhD is required. The only exception is for tax attorneys who have a JD (which is considered by some schools to be an equivalent terminal degree).  CPAs aren't mandatory, but a lot of schools, especially midrange ones, will tick that in your favor.  About working with students... it depends HEAVILY on the kind of school you want to join. Research schools (big names like U Chicago,  Harvard, any big state school) will have you teaching very few classes (as few as 1-2 per year in some cases) while you're required to make a high number of A-level publications in order to get tenure.  Ironically, schools that pay slightly less will have you teaching much more and have reasonably relaxed research requirements. It's these kinds of schools where a CPA would be most helpful.  I did an AMA on the process and perks of becoming an accounting Ph.D. You're right. It's an awesome lifestyle. Feel free to PM me with any questions. We have a serious shortage of tenure track accounting professors and I'd be happy to offer any encouragement I can."
Accounting,3dy8az,thedistec,5,Mon Jul 20 20:19:05 2015 UTC,"Depends on the university. Some schools have people with Masters doing the teaching, but they're not on a tenure track and generally do something else (or are solely adjunct, which sucks).  Tenured-track professors have PhDs, do significant amounts of research, are involved in the administration of the college/university, and do in fact do a lot of ""number crunching"" in their research. Also, the job can be incredibly stressful when you begin considering funding, research requirements, defending your research, etc....  There's no free lunch, and becoming a professor after spending 5 years on your PhD definitely isn't the ""easier alternative."" But those who do it are generally incredibly passionate, and love it."
Accounting,3dy8az,No_Help_Accountant,8,Mon Jul 20 15:01:55 2015 UTC,"I believe I can shed some light on this topic, as I helped recruit and hire accounting professors at my university.  To become a tenure-track professor, a PhD is required. This is true of all universities within the United States. You can become an instructor without a PhD, but you will be paid much less and work more hours. You would be considered adjunct faculty. You do not want to be adjunct faculty.  A CPA is not required (at least, not at my university.) However, generally you would have your CPA by the time you get your PhD. We do have one professor who does not have his CPA, and he is one of the best professors we have.  PhD's at my university start at ~$150,000 effective pay (lower than the nation-wide average), teach 3 accounting classes in the Spring and Fall, and teach 2 accounting classes in the Summer. They are required to publish research articles every two years.  I used to chat with several of them in the department office, and many say that they feel like they are retired. It is much less work than public accounting."

It sounds like an awesome job. If you can stick out the 4-5 year program, getting a job as a professor making 150k a year is pretty much guaranteed.    Lots of schools want their professors to have professional experience, so a CPA is a big plus. The main requirement is a PhD. You can teach without one, but you won't be a professor."
Accounting,3dy8az,doctorbuttons,3,Mon Jul 20 16:26:07 2015 UTC,"I have a follow up question, since I, too, have considered this career route.  Has anyone worked on their PhD gradually while still in public accounting, or do you really have to go the full-time student route?  Also, are there any programs in which you can get paid to do your PhD research, like in many other disciplines, or will tuition all be out of pocket for an Accounting degree?"
Accounting,3dy8az,No_Help_Accountant,4,Mon Jul 20 16:42:46 2015 UTC,"The amount of energy, and overall structure, of a PhD program pretty much dictates full-time. I can't imagine a part-time PhD, as it'd probably take 10+ years to complete. Many PhD programs explicitly state that they require full-time enrollment, it's just in its nature.  Most PhD programs are free to the PhD student (in that you work/do research for the university/college), and also pay a living stipend (not a lot of money, but enough to ""get by"")."

No, if you are good enough that they want you as a PhD student, you are paid to be there. It's more of a ""launch to your career as an academic"" than a living allowance. Being a PhD is much different than being an undergrade/masters student. In fact, you are not really a ""student"" anymore, you're a developing academic.   Also, almost no one could afford to become a PhD if there wasn't some kind of stipend. It takes all your time, and you'd be living with no income."
Accounting,3dy8az,thedistec,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:54:02 2015 UTC,"If you are accepted in ANY reputable PhD program, in any discipline, you will get free tuition and a stipend. This is part of the reason the programs are so competitive."

Accounting,3e0b0h,Furples,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:02:04 2015 UTC,It's important to have one and appear to actively use it. Beyond that I'm not sure how important it is. I just made sure to fill out the profile as best I could and add my classmates. Now I look at it maybe twice a month.
Accounting,3e0b0h,calacast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:26:01 2015 UTC,"LinkedIn may not be as useful coming out of school, given on-campus recruiting, but I think it's used much more after you're already in the workforce.  Many corporate recruiters use LinkedIn for experienced hire.  I was at a Big 4 before LinkedIn was around (yes, I'm old) and we used to get phone calls from headhunters.  I would imagine that recruiters/headhunters would use LinkedIn the same way.  I'm not in public accounting anymore but I still get recruiters contacting me about job opportunities."

Accounting,3e0b0h,Tamerlee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:05:52 2015 UTC,LinkedIn is quite important.  Many employers will google you to see what pops up.  You don't need anything fancy but you should at least have your picture andsomewhat current info on there.  Also makes it easy to keep in contact with people you meet.  Edit: spelling
Accounting,3e0b0h,LifecanbeTaxing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:13:16 2015 UTC,"Don't know how much LinkedIn profile views affect recruiting, but it is definitely something to have regardless.  In my case, no recruiters come to my school. I reached out to a recruiter on LinkedIn who's email was on their page. They passed my resume along to the campus recruiter and now I have a big 4 internship upon completion of my senior year coming up. So depending on how hard you try to network on it, it could get you a gig like in my case. I am very fortunate but i believe it could work in many people's favor if they go above traditional recruiting methods."

He point blank told me it was normal for head hunters to send messages to people once they complete their exams and all that stuff.   Is linkedin worthwhile   I think so. It's like a dynamic CV, as in, don't update it when you're looking for a new job, update it when you've learned a new skill, it's much easier to later transcribe everything to paper, plus if anyone's looking for the skill you just acquired you might be hit up!"

I am an IT audit intern currently but have done extensive tax work in the past. I feel that this had a lot to do with getting the position that I have now.  Generally, firms larger firms including the big 4, have you intern the summer before your FINAL year in school. So unless you have extra credit hours, you most likely won't intern with a big 4 until after your senior year. Still network and get your name out there, and possibly even get into the development programs that many firms have to make you a shoe in for the internship in the future.  There are still tons of opportunities that you can find in the mean time in the private sector, such as fortune 500 companies, that give you extremely valuable experience, help you learn, add to your resume, and also add on a nice paycheck."

Accounting,3dycoq,mrpkd,3,Mon Jul 20 15:16:19 2015 UTC,"I'm telling you this - you're never going to get a 40 hour week again. I've done government and public accounting - I'm in a private company now. At a bare minimum I'm doing 45 hours a week. Month-end close will always require overtime. SEC Reporting has more peaks and valleys of balls to the wall busy/nothing-to-do because of the hard deadlines for filing. Public is way heavy during audit times, a little less so in the non-audit times but relatively a ""grind"" too.  For me, the private industry world was sort of the best medium between public and government, but now that I'm married getting older - I'm thinking about a return back to government. Sometimes the money just can't replace work/life balance.  If you don't feel challenged in your federal job - consider a transfer somewhere. DCAA is really great, I always talk higher about them.

When the jerk principal told firm management about me, she told them about the co-worker too. Needless to say, that experience soured us both on that company and we went elsewhere.  One of my college friends worked in HR at the company - I had lunch with him and told him what happened. I'm not sure what he did with that info, but he was less than thrilled to hear about it.

And she constantly needed help to get that done.  Same guy also never saw my skills progress and would have me send his daughter vitamins via international fedex.  Well, he gave me a closed and taped box that I had to ask if I could open so I could correctly disclose what I was shipping.  The whole process took me 3 hours.  He had some other poor employee ship a sail for a sailboat that was 10 feet long.    I had to chase him and hound him every Thursday to sign the checks.  I had to send some out fedex by 3pm and would give him the check run at 10am and sometimes be down to the wire with fedex waiting for me.   He was not working, we heard him making personal calls all day.  Then when the company was shutting down, he spent all day on the phone talking about starting a sailboat rental business while we all heard clear as day and we were stuck working until the work transitioned.  He honestly looked like a dog had just started talking when I told him my next job was at another company as a senior accountant.  He thought I was nothing but a data entry drone.  Last I heard the owners were refusing to pay out his final pay-to-stay bonus because of the wife on the payroll thing and that he wasn't doing any real work.

I had the normal winter busy season, but also had a summer project with an upcoming deadline. Before I got stuck on this project I had booked a trip to Vegas and asked for the time off.   On the day I was supposed to fly out, I got suckered into coming into work that day. The manager on the job knew my situation. Flight at 3, already requested time off. I agreed to come in for a few hours.   By 11, I could tell he wasn't happy with the progress being made. I reiterated that I would do what I can but am starting to push the limits to how long I can stay. He asked if I could do a few more things. Pain in the ass things.   By 12:30 I was getting nervous. I still had to go home, collect my luggage and get to the airport. Manager still not happy with the progress. This is cutting it WAY too close.   By 1 PM I had enough. I am not screwing up my trip for this. It's impossible to get a direct flight from Portland, ME to Vegas, so if I miss my first flight I might not be able to easily rebook. I send a quick email at 1 with my status and take off. BARELY make the flight - the woman at the check-in desk said I may have already used up all my luck for the trip (she was right).   I got back the following week and he was not very happy. Said he told the partner in the account and was considering documenting this ""incident"" for my EE file, and told me the firm wouldn't have me if I thought this was acceptable behavior. Whatever.

Accounting,3dzgw4,_The_Intern,2,Mon Jul 20 20:01:10 2015 UTC,3.1 is fine. It's not competitive for Big 4 but that means that you have to emphasize your activities and prior work experience more and spend more time on the networking/recruiting events. Your main focus will be landing interviews; once you get past that you're good.  Is 3.1 your accounting GPA or cumulative? If your accounting or major GPA is higher you can put that on your resume as long as you clearly label it as such.
Accounting,3dzgw4,JoeClarksville,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:33:44 2015 UTC,"3.1 is both, so no bueno. Is a 3.1 enough to say Grant Thornton or CRI or the like? I'm not sure that I want to Big Four due to how absolutely awful everyone makes it out to be."
Accounting,3dzgw4,JoeClarksville,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:21:52 2015 UTC,"That should be fine. You can check specific GPA requirements on your school's on-campus recruiting page or by talking to a recruiter. Because you have some good experience and a lot of involvement they could be more flexible with you if you're just below the cutoff.  There's nothing wrong with not going Big 4, but don't let the crazy stories dissuade you. A lot of people make it sound as if only Big 4 employees bust their ass and the rest of the accounting field is straight 9 to 5, but the truth is busy season is busy season. You could run into a bad supervisor/team anywhere. Instead of buying into the horror stories, keep an open mind and try to meet people at every firm that you might be interested in, big or small. Don't obsess over Big 4, but don't let people tell you that working at Grant Thornton or McGladrey is somehow inherently easier than working for EY or Deloitte."
Accounting,3dzgw4,boogpowell,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:28:59 2015 UTC,Big4 usually has a minimum GPA to even apply.  Idk what that is at the moment but when I interviewed it was 3.4 for your Major GPA and 3.0 for overall.

Accounting,3dye2h,I3lackcell,2,Mon Jul 20 15:41:27 2015 UTC,"Are you saying that you already have a MAcc? If so, it would be a serious waste of your time to get another degree; the only point in a master's degree is to get another shot at recruiting and fulfill CPA requirements. If neither of these applies to you, move on and get a job. You should absolutely contact your recruiters to determine if their companies have specific educational preferences. Chances are they will say no but it may put your mind at ease."

If you are looking at specific big 4 clients, here is a good start.  It is likely that if the firm is the auditor, then they probably do at least some tax work.  However, it doesnt mean that other firms in the area dont do tax work.    Its worth noting that when i said i wanted to move to Chicago, I literally just said I wanted to move to a larger city.  I said nothing about clients.  You are a student, you really dont even know what kind of work different industries would entail."
Accounting,3dyaus,I3lackcell,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:45:35 2015 UTC,"I 2nd this. To add a few more cities/states: NJ/PA/MA - pharma/life science. NY - media in addition to FS. SF - FS and media in addition to tech. LA - media/telecom. SJ - tech/biotech. FL - real estate, hospitality. TX - oil/gas. Also almost every major city has decent sized real estate and hospital clients.  In general, don't choose an firm/office because they have a specific client since there's no guarantee you will be put on the client (assume most of the things they tell you during recruiting is crap). It is however fine to pick offices and firms based on your industry interests (make sure you are actually interested in the industry you choose or else you'll be miserable). e.g. PwC is strong in FS and pharma, EY is strong in airlines and tech, Deloitte has a mixed bag, KPMG lowballs whenever possible"

I think you're probably fine; the bigger question is going to be quality/length of work experience and GMAT scores in all likelihood.

And if you want to be self-employed, you would definitely want to do tax, and some people simply hate tax. Oh, and there's that CPA exam, which isn't that hard by itself, but studying for it is time consuming. Seriously. Do IT consulting or something.

I even know one who went back to working for $10/hr dead end job after he got his BSCS degree....at least if you have accounting degree you can probably make a minimum of 30k/year and actually have a job doing accounting stuff which means you will eventually move up over time.

Self-employed CPA's need to have a lot of tax experience and very little audit experience.
Accounting,3dx2u9,Threewalldream,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:55:42 2015 UTC,"My husband is a computer science major; his starting salary was $14K higher than mine was, and his compensation contains far more bonus options. Not gonna lie, it stung when he found out how much his offer was for after I had gotten my master's and CPA, compared to his BS.   Personally speaking, I switched to accounting after getting my BA in chemistry because I didn't really want to go through a grueling PhD program and deal with that job market and starting a career 10 years after the rest of my peer group. All of my calculus, physics, and science courses are 100% wasted as an accountant. Overall, I'm not unhappy about the career switch, but I will say that if you enjoy math type stuff then CS would be a better choice for you. I miss being able to use my brain in that way - accounting and auditing certainly isn't mindless, but it's very different than how you think in science."
Accounting,3dx2u9,Embrace_The_Fluff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:18:05 2015 UTC,"I'm a senior accounting major and I was actually a computer science major for my first 3 semesters before switching. I was not very good at computer science because the projects were very open ended, it was not like accounting where you follow the same rules over and over again. The structure in accounting is what appeals to me. CS was just too much for me to wrap my head around, never mind the mathematics. Don't pick accounting because you like math. Youll do addition, subtraction, multiply/divide, etc. But you will never encounter calculus or anything like that. Basically if you can make it through junior high math without failing, you know more than enough math to do everything in accounting.  You will definitely make more money with CS if you stick with that. But like others have said, programming is super evolving and you would have to stay up to date on everything. Not sure how you will be self employed unless you open your own small tax practice. If you do that you will need lots of clients to actually make money, which is highly unlikely after spending a few years at a large firm. At a large firm you will likely not be doing anything you will see daily at a small one.   At the end of the day, if you are good and comfortable with CS, I would definitely stick with that. If I had the brains to understand it, I would still be majoring in it."

Accounting,3dtv6d,vanadium3,2,Sun Jul 19 22:26:56 2015 UTC,"Salaries are very different in my area (so is the cost of living).  I worked for private companies and never worked for the CPA because I didn't 'need it' and I didn't make enough to cover the costs of maintaining it.  I totally regretted that later because now I'm trying for my CPA.  I might have just had bad luck but I got tired of the stress of private accounting.  My income only came from one source and if the company wasn't doing well, I was not getting a raise.    I enjoy public accounting because for once my work is a revenue-earning position so I am valued and raises are given joyfully instead of begrudgingly.  We work for many clients so if one leaves or goes under, oh well, plenty more to keep us busy.    I am also surrounded by accountants who understand why what I do is important and why it really does matter if a bank account is balanced or inventory is counted.  I'm surrounded by a wealth of expertise and am not struggling on my own to figure things out.  I took a slight pay cut when I switched jobs but was back to my old salary within the year.  I have gotten excellent raises every year.  My firm aims for anyone to double their salary in 5 years and are 100% transparent on how your compensation is decided and in the end we get 60% of our billings.  I do work overtime during busy seasons but I also can work less at other times and set my own schedule.  I was terrified of tax work before this but now that I have training, tools, and resources, I really love it.  How did I get to my firm?  They were the CPA firm for my last company.  They saw the quality of the work I provided and when I asked if they were hiring, they snapped me up.  So I do recommend helping with financial statement preparation with the current firm that does them.  Impress them and then see if they will hire you or know of any openings.  I don't know how many firms are as great as mine are in these areas but you should ask current employees of any firm you consider out to lunch and see what they have to say."

You're gonna take 3-4 years to get CPA in Canada so you'd be waiting an awful long time to jump to Senior from Junior as it's getting to the point where you need a designation to get into a Senior role.  However, public accounting experience actually looks really good on a resume. You get exposed to so much over quite a few industries. For example, you don't even see let alone touch financial statements until you are a Senior in industry, and that takes at least 3 years to get to if you go down the industry path. In Public, you're put on financial statements from almost Day 1. Your exposure to tax is going to pay dividends down the road for you when you start going after Controller type positions  Stay in Public, you'll be qualified for Senior Accountant jobs in about 6-12 months, and the fact that you'll be enrolled in CPA will only help you in getting there."

First you need to figure out how you learn.  For me, its practice. I have to do problems...i cant just read a textbook.  So i just practice as many problems as i can and I understand the reasoning behind the calculations-- why i am subtracting this and why i am adding this (not just memorizing formulas, understand the logic behind things).    Second, actually be awake and focused when your studying.  There's no point in studying if your not concentrating.  If that means having caffeine or candy or whatever then do it.  Third, if there is an accounting lab at your school, use it.  I was a GA myself and i tutored in the accounting lab and at mine we had answers for all the assignments and can pretty much explain anything you don't understand.  You don't even need to have a question...you can just sit in there and do homework and if something comes up you have a personal teacher whose sitting there with nothing better to do.  Lastly, go to summer leadership programs and get an internship.  I didn't know about any of this shit when i was in school. Your on this site so that's already a step in the right direction.  Go find how to apply for them and go to them and ull probably have a job lined up for when you graduate by your junior year.

Tips that work for me:   Don't study the day before the exam. The reason I don't is it makes me more anxious about the test. At this point you should have everything in your head that you can fit. Doing some last minute cramming, while your stressed, can be counter productive. You won't be doing as well because you are stressed out and the mistakes you make will just hurt your confidence about your mastery of the subject knowledge. Vice versa, if you can't stop yourself from ""cramming,"" study areas that you know you are strong in. This can lead to a confidence boost that will translate to a better performance on the test....Seriously, it has been proven that confidence about material DIRECTLY correlates to higher test scores. There are some really neat studies out there if you are interested. Eat and hydrate, WELL, the day before. It will help alleviate any stress the day of the test. Do something physical.

Our firm tends to over work on those kinds of engagements, in particularly if we know the bookkeeper is not experienced.   So I get the file, trial balance does not balance..  Cash is out by more than $200,000, payroll withholdings don't match by more than $50,000, wage expense is not even close to the T4 slips that were issued....  Client swears inventory is spot on (I have doubts).  The liability accounts are all nowhere to be supported and despite asking the bookkeeper for statements several times we don't get them for months.   In the end, it's a matter of plugging shit and trying to make it work out as best we can.  Several times I went back to the partner because I did not feel comfortable making that large a plug myself, several times the partner contacted the client to talk about the issues.  In the end I manage to get the balance sheet to tie to external support documents, but the income statement.... At this point, it's basiclly fiction.  This is the third year the company's books have been like this.  The bookkeeper was recently arrested for cocaine trafficking (the businesses owner knew this!).  We advised the client that they needed a new bookkeeper because this one was not up to the task.  In addition she could easily have been steeling and he would have no way of knowing (she had signing authority).  The partner on the file was very insistent that this bookkeeper was a bad idea.  Client kept the bookkeeper, changed accountants.  2 years later we find out that she was charged with taking more than $1,000,000 over the span of 5 years.  RV businesses went into receivership.  No idea how the RCMP sorted that mess out, but I', kind of glad that we were not involved.  Word on the street is that the accountant he switched to did not get paid for the last engagement.  As far as we know, he was not fucking or taking coke from her.  Her mother was an old family friend and he was reluctant to fire her because of the personal relationship.  Her criminal record made it impossible to get hired elsewhere and he felt that he would be leaving her in the lurch.. It's sad because he was just a nice man, just a little soft hearted.

Accounting,3dtyps,erikib,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:08:39 2015 UTC,"The partner is correct.   5   Governments also establish funds and reserves that are not supported by assets. These are designations of accumulated and/or annual surplus / deficit to reflect a policy purpose, to assist with fiscal management or to demonstrate compliance with legislation.  6   Separate reporting on the financial statements of funds and reserves not supported by assets would be inconsistent with FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION, Section PS 1201, and RESTRICTED ASSETS AND REVENUES, Section PS 3100.  7   Therefore, when a government chooses to provide information about any funds or reserves, it does so only in the notes and schedules and not on the statement of financial position. The creation of, addition to or deduction from funds and reserves does not create a revenue or expense, and would therefore not be reported on the statement of operations.  These are not net liabilities because while the [Chief and ]Council may have designated these surpluses or future revenues for such a purpose, this is not binding in the same way externally restricted funds are. [Chief and ]Council can simply go ahead and pass a new resolution changing the planned spending, as opposed to, say, instances where MACA funding gets blown on operations or something and there is a requirement to utilize new funds to pay for the capital assets those funds were earmarked for."
Accounting,3dtyps,B-rye8888,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:52:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you! However I'm not talking about presentation of reserves to disclose earmarked accumulated surplus or net assets by board/council to be set aside for future expenditures. I understand that funded reserves cannot be negative, nor are they externally restricted (externally restricted would be liabilities as deferred revenue). The nature of those reserves are that they are earmarked net assets, thus they have positive balances. This also means that those reserves are funded by existing assets at year end.  This is probably what the partner meant. What I'm asking about are unfunded reserves which, by their nature, have negative balances, due to the fact they are ""liabilities"" to be funded by future revenues not existing financial assets.  Such unfunded reserves are disclosed in the accumulated surplus note separate from funded reserves.  I see you're making reference to the Department of Municipal and Community Affairs (MACA) of the NWT government. I should have made the distinction with the partner between funded vs unfunded reserves."
Accounting,3dtyps,B-rye8888,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:00:41 2015 UTC,"I still don't think we're talking about the same thing. There are no journal entries, because you're not reporting anything in your statement of financial position. If you have a 'reserve' that is not supported by assets, you merely disclose it in the notes or schedules.   If you were to be doing something like in Schedule B of these financial statements, then you might have a ""administration"" or ""general operations"" segment/fund that you would transfer surplus/deficit to. I have seen where this is presented with opening accumulated surplus/deficit by fund, and therefore this would still result in a ""positive"" balance (i.e. you would debit surplus out of the general fund and credit the new fund) for the next fiscal year. This is regardless of whether assets have been designated to that fund or not in the meaning of PS 3100. This is an equity allocation, whether it's specifically funded or not has no bearing. It is possible for such funds to have negative balances where expenses exceed revenues and/or amounts are transferred between programs."
Accounting,3dtyps,B-rye8888,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:37:44 2015 UTC,"Hi, My apologies for the confusion.  When I previously said net liabilities, I meant conceptually, not legally, as I understand that all internally restricted accumulated surplus or reserves are set internally, not externally.  The example you have provided re: Schedule B or PS 3100 is not quite what I'm asking about.  For an example of what I'm asking about, see note 8(a) on page 20 of these financials regarding the accumulated surplus note.  You can see there are negative balances for particular ""unfunded reserves"" which, in this case, relates to liabilities of the organization to be funded by future revenues rather than from existing assets at year end.  This is critical information to communicate to financial statement users.    I'm not sure that I agree with your comment that no journal entries would be made to record reserves, since many organizations have sophisticated chart of accounts where they maintain separate ledger accounts for each reserve (be they positive or negative balances), even when it's just disclosed in a note and not on the face of the SFP.  Thanks again for your helpful input.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.  But I still contend that unfunded reserves can have negative balances, where funded reserves must have positive balances."

Accounting,3dtvlf,trktrner,2,Sun Jul 19 12:25:29 2015 UTC,"T0 represents an immediate payout while T1 is at the end of the period. So $100,000 project which generates cash flows of $25,000 would have T0 as -100 and T1-4 as 25 and you should get a 0% IRR and a negative NPV (unless you have a 0 discount rate).   Not exactly sure what your second question means. The Capital Expenditure should be included when you pay the cash for it i.e. at T0 and then if it requires regular maintenance then that too. Anytime this capex saves you from a cash outflow (so saves cost), then it's the same as a cash inflow. Be sure to read up on opportunity cost and sunk cost to make sure you do this right. Also don't forget salvage value.   So a $100,000 machine which needs maintenance of $25,000 every other year and would save the company $40,000 annually for 10 years would be T0: -100 T1: 40 T2: 40-25 T3: 40...T10: salvage value and last savings"

What's the purpose of the platforms (sorry, I'm not as tech-savvy as I want to be), are they for internal use or to be sold?  As others have said, when a business develops software to be sold to the public, most development costs are deemed, ""Research & Design"" expenditures and have to be expensed. The general rule is that once development has reached what FASB calls ""Technical Feasibility"", further development costs can capitalized until a ""product master"" is developed. Once you have a product master, any further development costs go into inventory. Most of this information I found in the FASB Codification>Industry>985 - Software.

Accounting,3dr0lx,Leighe,21,Sat Jul 18 23:44:57 2015 UTC,"Tips to help learn/retain information on the job:  1) When you're being taught a new procedure, take notes.  Write down steps for yourself to follow later.  Write down even the mundane details that you are likely to forget later.  Try to write your notes as if you're writing them for someone coming in to your role later on -- that way when you've forgotten the context of your notes, they still make sense.  Keep your procedural notes in a binder or Word document (or other medium that works for you) so that you have your own little work ""bible"" that you can reference as need be.  2) Practice basic bookkeeping while learning procedures, and take every opportunity to write out journal entries when you can.  If you have to, make T-accounts and journalize that way until you can mentally wrap your head around accounts.  Practice regular/frequent transactions so they become second nature (e.g. payables, receivables, bank transactions, expenses, etc.)  Realize that bookkeeping is basically just figuring out a two-piece puzzle each transaction.  What is your debit, and what is your credit? You may have more complicated transactions that require multiple journal entries, but generally its pretty simple.  3) Memorize the default Debit and Credit accounts so that doing the journal entries comes more easily (e.g. if you know that one side of your journal entry is already a debit [i.e. a deposit to a bank account], then you know you must be looking for an account that would make sense to credit).    4) Don't be afraid to Google things.  Most people don't seem to realize that a huge part of being ""good"" at something is knowing when to turn elsewhere for help or answers.  Being able to find your own answers to questions is a huge part of being perceived as competent.  If you're not sure if your googling has provided you with a good enough answer, go to your supervisor and ask.  Instead of saying ""How do I do X"", say ""I am not sure how to do X, but my planned approach was Y.  Do you see an issue with this or have a different suggestion?""  5) As a CPA student (in Canada) you should have access to a copy of the CPA Handbook and the FITAC publication (Federal Income Tax Collection of forms, publications, and rulings).  While you are working, keep a list of what you did that day.  Then in your own time, go through your CPA Handbook and the FITAC to review WHY you are doing what you are being told to do.  6) Keep at least the following lists, daily:    A list of tasks you need to complete that day (check them off as you go) - Use the un-checked items to start your list for the next day A list of the mistakes you made A list of new skills you learned   Each of the lists serves a purpose.  Your To-Do list keeps you focused and on-task.  It makes sure that things don't fall through the cracks which can cause you to be perceived as inefficient, forgetful, or an under-performer.    Your Mistakes list provides a way for you to note your frequent errors and correct them.  If you notice you are routinely forgetting that one check-box, you can come up with a strategy to make sure you don't (e.g. when you prepare that particular form, your first step on your procedural list is to add a sticky-flag to that check box to make sure you don't forget it).  If you eliminate common errors, your accuracy and completeness increase substantially because with 1 correction you fix a problem that frequently occurs.  Your ""Skills Learned"" list provides you with some context so that when you have a bad day with a lot of mistakes, or when you need to prepare a resume, you're able to go back to your ""Skills Learned"" list and quickly see how far you have progressed.  I hope this helps you."

At the moment it seems that your responsibilities match your job title. Look at the accountants in your company: how did they get there and what are they responsible for? Do you even want to do their job?  My advice would be to speak to your line manager and make your ambitions known. Ask for more training and responsibility. Also, you should apply for any internal accounting positions.   I am also wondering where the line is drawn between being a hard worker that achieves results and being a sucker for torture.   There is no hard and fast rule, 12h days during year end are not uncommon in this world. The question I'd be asking is whether this amount of overtime was allowed by the management (incompetence, deliberate under-staffing to reduce costs) or accidental (people leaving etc.).   My advice would be for you to re-evaluate your current position in this company: Is there a clear and defined path for me to get to the next level? Is my comp adequate? Is my manager someone I can learn from? Does the company have a track record in supporting and developing staff?

Accounting,3drj7e,myayensandpounds,5,Sat Jul 18 19:35:59 2015 UTC,"He definitely makes a very good case for eliminating business taxes. Many other countries have already realized that it is a smart idea to set business taxes at 0% to lure in businesses then they tax them indirectly. For example, a business will be taxed at 0% but the wages they pay to employees will be taxed. Then there are certain countries, like UAE, that only tax certain business entities like banks, energy companies and hotels/entertainment. Income tax does not exist. The taxes that do exist are more based on consumption, one being rental income tax.  However, taxes/regulation is only one aspect of business. Sometimes there are other factors that are more important, for example, access to skilled labor or specific type of labor."
Accounting,3drj7e,rasdfaskdfajsdf98,3,Sun Jul 19 00:02:01 2015 UTC,"The issue seems to be that businesses will just move wherever the taxes are lowest or can most-readily be taken advantage of. If all countries set their corporate income tax to 0%, then none of them would be able to attract corporations any more than the others. In an increasingly global economy, the best strategy would probably be a more global corporate tax."
Accounting,3drj7e,Hotshot2k4,2,Sun Jul 19 01:01:08 2015 UTC,"Having a global tax is something that I think would cause more uproar than anything and also cause corporations to not do business in that country. If the U.S. taxed a company on their global sales when they sell very little inside the U.S. the corporation would not do business with us anymore and end up hurting our economy. If you are saying that every country should have a global tax, think about those repercussions. First off it would never happen because not every country will be on the same page but theoretically let's say it is possible. Then corporations might end up paying 50+% in taxes and then there is no incentive to globalize. Each company would strictly so business within its own countries borders. So Apple would do business in the U.S. We would never have had Toyota cars."
Accounting,3drj7e,ImMrAllStar,2,Sun Jul 19 01:14:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think either of the options you described were what I had in mind.

Like google operates in just about every country but we don't really get along with Russia or China. Also each economy isn't compatible with each other. Another thing on the lines of subsidies, it would then turn into countries basically paying corporations HUGE sums of money to incorporate in that certain country.

Accounting,3drj7e,ImMrAllStar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:17:02 2015 UTC,"True and if the tax is based on equitable distribution then we can get the tax revenues to be distributed based on population instead of economic activity. That would be a huge advancement for countries like china, india and african countries that have high population but low economic activity."
Accounting,3drj7e,rasdfaskdfajsdf98,3,Sun Jul 19 02:36:55 2015 UTC,"This is very amateurish and completely misses the core issue.   Different countries adopt different economic models. They offer varying levels of service, absorb different costs, and charge different rates of tax. A company moving their economic activity to a country with a lower tax rate is no more wrong than them changing any other supplier.    The problem with the tax avoidance is the economic activity does not change, only where they pay tax. Services are provided by the high-service, high-tax country whilst taxation is paid in low-service, low-tax country. Certain countries do not attempt to compete on any service/tax basis, they operate as parasites, charging tax rates which would be unsustainable except that another country is providing all the services. Some of these countries even have a regular tax rate for companies operating there, and individually negotiate a separate one when merely acting as a tax base.   Tax needs to match economic activity. Profits are taxed because profit (the true profit) is the only measure of economic value added. Entirely taking taxes from investor income does not work because investors are international and dividends are not necessarily paid at the time or the place the profit is generated. Entirely taxing payroll does not work because employees are only one of the factors of production."
Accounting,3drj7e,davegod,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:39:30 2015 UTC,"True but you have to look at how tax havens operate. They generally have little to offer outside of low taxes and for many of these countries they are desperate for labor demand. For the ruling classes in tax havens they full well know that an unemployed work force is also a population that is prone to protesting/revolutions etc.   Also the tax haven model is a sure way to increase the wealth of the country's inhabitants. Singapore and Hong Kong being good examples. However, the tax haven model seems to be losing steam since so many countries are using tax incentives. If the country isn't a complete tax haven then the country will probably have some sort of special economic zone. Practically the entire growth of China has been fueled by China creating special economic zones and allowing western companies to build factories there. Most of the companies operating in those zones have some sort of preferential tax treatment and some of them are even subsidized by the Chinese government! Maybe the company will get lower than normal electricity rates, or rent-free factory space.  If a company wants to maintain its businesses then they must make sure their business climate is competitive. Your average investor or business owner could care less about some service or welfare program. The only services or welfare programs they care about are program that directly benefit them."

Depending on the size of the company, it wouldn't make sense for the cfo to leave to work for an accounting firm.  They would take a paycut in most cases.  Here's an extreme example for you.  Would you go work for your maid service that cleans your house in exchange for them to hire you? No, they are a service provider and you are hiring them.

People learn differently, some are tinkerers at heart and don't ""get it"" until they fumble through it and then they suddenly click. Some need heavy explanations, some don't know what they need.   Reflect on yourself too. Sometimes you tend to explain and train the way you get it- make sure you're not being biased and assuming how you understand is how everyone understands. Ask them questions to gauge their understanding as you go.  As I've started training people I've noticed I over explain and confuse people with small details that maybe are not necessary to get the job done.  But I'm a firm believer that spending more time up front explaining and guiding saves you review time down the road.

There are plenty of jobs as an accountant (which is unusual for South Florida because from what I gather, there aren't a lot of jobs for others). The thing about South Florida is that it's middle-market. There are only a few big public companies to fight over. As far as travel, I don't think they really leave the state unless they request it.  Advancement in public here is the same as everywhere else. I like the people I've worked with so far but it is definitely a bit hard to make friends in Miami in general. You'd probably just have work friends.  Housing is kind of outrageous, but Boston probably isn't a lot better.  Traffic is horrible. Takes me 40 minutes to go 8 miles into downtown in the morning.

By removing them your score would be dinged because your total available credit would be lower meaning your utilization of available credit would be higher (you want this low as possible). I can't remember for sure but I think the act itself of closing accounts may negatively impact your score (google it).   TL;DR - The average age of your accounts does not have as huge affect on your score as utilization (credit balance/available credit)  As far as airline cards, if you're only flying domestic US Southwest has a card via Chase that for $80 gives you miles with your purchases and hey give you enough points when you sign up to buy two round trip flights as a bonus.

Accounting,3dr6yc,secthrowaway121,5,Sat Jul 18 17:51:42 2015 UTC,"'Illegal' is a weird way to phrase this. In general there is nothing illegal about making a bad strategic decision; if there was the people behind New Coke would be on death row right now. As far as ethics go, I think it depends on what they are disclosing about this on the reports they supply to investors. The investors should be getting reports on cash flows, spending, and profitability periodically; they'll be able to see beyond the top-line revenue and most investors don't focus on that number anyway. If profits are negative or cash flows from operations is negative for a long period of time that'll be a huge red flag to a sentient investor (assuming that this isn't a start-up or something).  As a consultant I definitely feel you on the frustration of when you design and develop an elegant solution to a recurring problem that a client is facing and after spending all those hours on it they look at it and say, ""Nope, thanks, but we like doing what we're doing."" But it's not illegal as long as they aren't misrepresenting the costs of their marketing strategies. It's also not fair to suggest that they're ""inflating"" revenue if the revenue they're reporting represents genuine sales. They might be over-spending on marketing but when you say ""inflating"" revenue to an accountant we think, ""phony sales"" or ""fictitious customers"" or ""channel stuffing""."
Accounting,3dr6yc,JoeClarksville,3,Sat Jul 18 18:11:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!  Yeah, it's definitely not illegal to make stupid decisions haha. And since we don't know how they present the data to their investors and board, I don't think I can say for certain if they're engaging in illegal practices.  My belief, from everything they've indicated, is that they only report their bottom line to shareholders.  And since their non-ad spend channels are doing better than expected, they can use that surplus to artificially inflate revenue in ad spend channels while staying within their overall target ROI. So, I think they might be misrepresenting the costs. I mean, if they want to tell their board and investors that they spent $1 for $0.50 in revenue, feel free, it's not my job on the line. But I think they report on all channels combined, which would absolutely disguise their intentionally horrible strategy.   I have zero doubt that deception is the intent here, they've pretty much stated as such, I just don't know when it crosses the line to illegal."
Accounting,3dr6yc,JoeClarksville,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:26:29 2015 UTC,"No problem!  I'm not sure either. I'm not a lawyer and the disclosure requirements for small companies and their lenders and investors are generally what they negotiate between them. I agree that what they're doing is dumb and dishonest but there's a lot of ""dumb money"" out there and there are a lot of investors who really won't ask why they aren't being shown the fundamental information that most companies show to investors and creditors.   It's hard to know 'illegal' or 'not illegal' without knowing what information the company is obligated to provide; usually when you are going to a VC firm or something like that they will contract for certain performance metrics and indicators so that the money doesn't just disappear into a black hole. Based on what you described there could be some funny business going on though, either from a dishonest management team alone or a dishonest management team plus gullible/inexperienced investors."
Accounting,3dr6yc,hoyeay,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:10:23 2015 UTC,I don't know if this helps but don't investors usually only ask to see GAAP compliant financial documents (and not the tax basis/accounting side?

Accounting,3dr6yc,potatogun,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:34:35 2015 UTC,Not enough detail but it's common to focus on top line for investors.  CAC and LTV come into play as metrics. The difference of $20k in revenue seems so little a trade off to the user acquisition if the resultant ARPU and life time feeding LTV are decent. If not you have a problem to fix where it doesnt make sense to ramp paid acquisition.  So ultimately hard to say without knowing the details.

I understand maybe passing an important message off to a second pair of eyes to proofread, but god... it's email.  That being said, I've never worked B4 and absolutely hated the short time I spent in a corporate public accounting office. I can't stand office politics, so whether or not it would be beneficial to you to email around and ask for projects might be better answered by someone else. If you were MY employee, I'd love it, provided you really did have a lull and weren't slacking on other projects you were responsible for.  EDIT: Sorry, I read that over and it was worded more aggressively than I meant. I'm not trying to put down B4 or corporate offices, they're just not my cup of tea. My short answer is yes - absolutely ask your manager for projects, and if they don't have any, see if you could ask around to other departments for ways you could contribute.

Accounting,3dqavo,davegod,2,Sat Jul 18 13:37:47 2015 UTC,"In response to your post, here are a few email hints/tricks/whatever that were taught to me by a writing consultant that I'll share:  Keep the email short and sweet. People are generally lazy - I know I am - especially when it comes to reading emails. People skim. They get the jist.  Put the most important item first. If they only read a single sentence before they had to run to a meeting, what do you want them to absorb? Put the details after - they'll get to it if they actually care about the topic.  Keep it simple. Use bullet points. Spread items out. I don't want to read a looooong paragraph to then attempt to understand what the point of the email was. I can't imagine others do either.  Don't lose your voice. When an email goes through a revision through a manager - it can start sounding like you just scribed exactly what they said. Keep it in your tone - it's your identity.   Keep in professional. Your voice doesn't mean you have to have ""man"" or ""mate"" or ""dude"" in it. However, also don't sound like a robot. Instead of saying - ""Is there a time in which you would have the best availability?"" just say, ""When are you available"" or ""What day and time work for you?"" If it's not something that you would say aloud - it will read just as awkwardly.  ""That"" is a filler. Re-read your emails and parse them down. Anytime you see the word ""that"" used, think if it is actually needed.   I see shite emails from co-workers and managers all the time. I see this specifically from the older management (read: partners) that use one finger to type. These people's emails are still using @hotmail.com. Do you really want to accept all their email edits without a second thought?  Eitherway, I'm not an expert. Just hoping to give additional perspective. Most people in the world aren't that bright - me included. If you want to get better - read a book and practice technique.  Here is the site of that consultant I had (thanks corporate america for paying for that). http://www.curryyoung.com/  Edit Above .. ""(thanks corporate america for paying for that)"" has a ""that"" which I should have deleted. I think it shows you should ignore my advice and keep doing whatever you are doing. I am a former audit robot."
Accounting,3dqavo,davegod,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:24:10 2015 UTC,"Third years needing revisions? Sure for contentious issues, but not anything standard. As a newbie it shouldn't take too long before you're good when just sending basic emails requesting information to non-senior staff you're familiar with.  Writing professional letters is an art. A good professional letter on a difficult matter should be something to behold.   Additionally, a perfect letter to one client could be much too formal/direct/whatever to another, or in another circumstance.   It does get easier as you gain confidence in your expertise and experience dealing with clients."

Accounting,3dqavo,Kitchner,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:57:19 2015 UTC,"Keep the recipient in mind.  People have a habit of writing things that they want to say, instead of thinking about the recipient understanding what you think he needs to, and also what he will want to know. Before you start writing, imagine having a conversation with the client instead.   The initial sentences should introduce the letter's nature, importance and tone, which should be consistent throughout.  It should be concise - short and to the point. No waffle, other than a brief nicety. No jargon.   Must, should, and ought mean very different things."

Basically basis is what the asset/stock/whatever is worth in your hands, or how much you spent on it, how much you have invested in it , or whatever.  what you will be doing in a problem is ""selling price"" minus ""basis"" = ""gain"" (if positive) or ""loss"" (if negative).

Accounting,3dr64x,JoeClarksville,2,Sat Jul 18 19:30:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. What I meant to say is, when you sell the asset you take how much money you sold it for and subtract your basis and the difference is your gain or loss on the sale."
Accounting,3dr64x,meulab,2,Sat Jul 18 19:48:49 2015 UTC,"No.  You're taxed upon the difference between the value of the consideration received less the basis (this is your gain or loss), but only upon a realization and a recognition.  You need both.  Realization = you sell it. Recognition = the code says you have to recognize the gain.  As the value goes up (think a house that you own), you're not taxed on anything.  It isn't until you sell the house that you'll calculate the gain by taking sales proceeds, less your basis.  The difference is your realized gain.  Then, you go further say see if the code says that you have to recognize the gain and pay tax.  Normally you do.  However, for personal residences, which is a defined term, you may not have to recognize the gain.  Same issue thing for like kind exchanges (section 1031 in the code)."

My work life balance is so good that I can go to the gym 5 times a week, study for CPA exams, and put in a solid hour or 2 of videogames every night. The pay is decent, started out at about 55k a year and I'm now at about 64k (up for another promotion soon so it may change) and I have been working there about 2.5 years.... I love private. Forget all that public nonsense. I like to enjoy my life. The funny thing is I went private because I didn't meet the reqs (grades) to work at a CPA firm."
Accounting,3dp5gq,IamRedRush,6,Sat Jul 18 06:31:02 2015 UTC,"This. This right here is what I did. Jumped straight to industry as a cost accountant starting around $50,000. 40 hour work weeks (with one long day a month for close and two long weeks a year for inventory), 3 weeks PTO (4 weeks next year). Had time to study and take CMA exams - now CPA. It's great."

My graduating MACC class sent nearly everyone to public/B4, except for the international students that didn't have the right work visas and then 3-4 people that ended up working for Uncle Sam.

My grades weren't good enough to get into public, I had no interest in it at the time, and desperately needed something. I realized I wasn't getting anywhere in A/R and left to be a Junior in the entertainment industry with only a small raise (33k/year). I ended up jumping to a Project Accountant at a medium construction company for $50k/year..and sadly that only lasted a year as everyone got laid off.   After going back to my old Junior job part time, I got an offer to work Public (small) for $40k/year. The salary sucked, along with taking a $10k/year pay cut but I have found it to be really worth it. You learn so much in public, the hours certainly aren't bad (OT is rare and Friday afternoons off in the summer isn't a bad deal). Sure the pay sucks but it is going to be worth it for me in the end now that I have my CMA-CPA designation (Canada).  I wish I started out in Public, I felt I would have grown my career much faster had I done so."

At UCF, there's 50-100 active BAP students any given semester.   But that's probably only 10% of all accounting students.   BAP students usually go public, and probably a 1/4 or more go Big 4, and most non BAP students go industry.   For some reason, industry doesn't seem to recruit as heavily as public does though.   Our few corporate recruiters I can think of are Siemens, Disney, Verizon (the heaviest recruiter of anything right now, they're snatching up everyone, even trying to recruit non business degree holders such as myself - don't yet have my MSA) AND Wyndam something or other."

Accounting,3dqdv3,Sawyerscience,7,Sat Jul 18 12:55:53 2015 UTC,"An associate's degree in accounting is pretty worthless. I have one, and it makes for a nice wall decoration. I recommend going to a community college to get your accounting prerequisites out of the way, though.  What are your career goals? Do you want to become a CPA? Since you already have a master's degree, a master's degree in accounting for non-accountants will probably be the way you want to go. You will not be able to fulfill the education requirements for a CPA license at a community college."
Accounting,3dqdv3,Tamerlee,2,Sat Jul 18 13:01:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying. I like the idea of earning a master's but getting the 6 pre-requisite courses out of the way will take two years because they are sequential accounting courses. I'm currently waiting on a response from the university regarding these pre-reqs. I'm interested in earning some sort of certification. Whether it's a CPA, CMA, or CISA or some combination of the three I'm not sure of quite yet. I just don't want a master's degree to take me four years to complete when I could have earned a lesser degree and still make at least what I would be making if I were teaching public school again."
Accounting,3dqdv3,ExplosiveGonorrhea,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:30:36 2015 UTC,"U/tamerlee is correct. But, really since your previous degree isn't business related at all, you're most likely going to need a lot of base level prerequisites that you should take at a community college if you can get a discount. Most likely a business calculus, two principles of Accounting, maybe even a B-law course. All accounting classes build upon each other, so it can be a pain in the ass if you want to do it quickly, because you most likely won't be able to.   Additionally, states have different requirements if you want to get a CPA license. My state (Texas) says you need 150 credit hours with 30 of those hours in upper level accounting to be eligible. So, you can either get a master's in accounting or have a BS in any field and take the 30 upper level courses to be eligible.  You can be very successful with just a BS. It really depends on where you want to go with your life and also, the quality of your life. You can see in this sub a ton of people that work in public, slogging through financial statements, working a ton of hours and just hating it, but loving the money. But, not everyone feels that way. Hope this helps and good luck!"
Accounting,3dqdv3,mattjh831,2,Sat Jul 18 14:02:05 2015 UTC,"Echoing above, one option is to look up what you need to become a CPA in your state, forget the MACC degree, and just take courses that will meet state requirements for a license. Worked with a guy (B4 Senior) that did that (BA in Philosophy, no MACC). He was a CPA/CISA."
Accounting,3dqdv3,ExplosiveGonorrhea,2,Sat Jul 18 14:09:57 2015 UTC,"You're so right. This is the way to go IMO. My university had combined sections for their Macc degree and the master's students just had a project at the end of the semester. I'm sorry, but if I'm paying master's tuition, I want the curriculum to differ a little than a bachelor's student. Call me crazy."
Accounting,3dqdv3,I3lackcell,3,Sat Jul 18 19:04:16 2015 UTC,"What kind of job do you want, 40 hours a week or 60+ hours at times during busy season?    For the first I would suggest a bachelors degree that covers all the pre reqs for the CPA.  You can also use campus recruiting this way.  The only reason I wouldn't do the associates is that you are unlikely to qualify for the CPA, which I feel is very important.  Going this route it's possible you could end up with an industry job.    If you are willing to work 60+ hours for a few months a year, then I would go into public.  This means big 4, regional or small firms.  I would still say bachelors while paying attention to course selection for CPA.  There are also some masters programs that do not require ANY previous accounting knowledge."
Accounting,3dqdv3,I3lackcell,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:06:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for commenting. Are the 60+ hours during tax season? The master's program near me requires 6 courses which isn't too bad. I've only been able to locate this one program so far but I'll keep looking. I want to attend most of my classes in person.
Accounting,3dm2ou,LucidOneironaut,10,Fri Jul 17 11:04:50 2015 UTC,"I'm currently a Big 4 senior.  I know I don't want to go the partner route, so trying to plan the best time to jump ship.  I'll be up for manager in a year.  I had an interview yesterday for an internal audit senior position at a public company.  Pay would be about $10-15k more with better quality of life.  I currently have zero SOX experience and this position would include a ton of that, which I assume would help on my resume down the road.  How worth it is sticking around Big 4 to get that manager title versus SOX exposure?  Everyone within Big 4 says make manager but they may just be sad they are still there too."
Accounting,3dm2ou,ratbastrd05,11,Fri Jul 17 12:25:04 2015 UTC,"I always recommend that people jump as a Senior, but there are others that would disagree. If you don't see yourself being partner, definitely start looking by the time you have 1 year as manager under your belt, at the latest. I have found that the number of varying opportunities that are available to you significantly decrease once you become manager, and it takes significantly longer to find a new role once you reach manager.  However, to each their own.   EDIT: BTW, This is always a controversial topic. Feel free to get a dialog going below so we have some other insight for people to review."
Accounting,3dm2ou,taoiseach41,2,Fri Jul 17 13:44:55 2015 UTC,"I want to throw some words of caution out there:  I have seen plenty of people who screwed themselves over when they jumped ship in their promotion year or when they were up for promotion very soon. Usually happens in B4 when they are about to hit manager or even senior. What happens is they make $50k and get sick of B4 life so they'll either make a upward/lateral move to Senior Accountant($65-70k), or at best an Assistant Controller role for an extra $5k...maybe a controller role at a small company for $80k/year if you're lucky.   If you stick it out that extra year and actually make manager you have way more exit opportunities from B4. One girl I know barely made it to manager and left to go to industry in a middle management role in a large company. Meanwhile, people who jumped at the first chance they got, are still stuck in Senior Accountant/Assistant Controller roles and 2+ years later  are still waiting for promotions because industry moves at a slower pace than public. The beauty of it is if you wait for that promotion, you'll be at a higher level making the same money as someone in industry.  If you can't stand B4 anymore, get out by all means, just be careful. If you time it right, you can get two promotions in quick succession -- one when you're at the firm and the second when you jump ship."

So instead of 20 people applying to 10 jobs maybe it's 5 people applying to 3 jobs.  Unless your plan is to leave big 4 for sure I think it's worth sticking around until you don't see progression and/or can't take it.  Being a director is a great job at the big 4 also, it's not only partner."

Those are very different areas of experience to have."

In industry, if you start as a Junior you'll be waiting a good 3 years for Senior....longer if you started at AP/AR clerk, whereas it takes 2 years max to hit Senior in B4, even shorter in some cases because turnover in public is so high. I knew a girl who was dumb as a brick in Canada and made Senior after barely a year at a B4 in Canada...and she wasn't even doing her CA.

Feel free to get a dialog going below so we have some other insight for people to review.   I've heard the rule of thumb is to exit public accounting after years 2,3, or 5. That's when you can effectively maximize your bump in pay.   You make a great point that many don't think about at this level in their careers: there's tons of jobs out there for staff and seniors...but as you go up the ladder in accounting (manager, director, controller) there's less and less jobs out there. It's like going up a pyramid. So people who make senior manager often find that they ""wasted"" a few years in public when they could've moved to industry."

I chose to work on private companies for a variety of reasons - one being that I'm from a rural spot and if I ever want to go back to having a rural life I think my experience will be more applicable. Secondly, because I'm in startupville, most companies here are privately owned. When they go IPO (Like they ever actually do), they'll get a ton of consultants anyway. They need people with a variety of experience - not someone who has audited the same company for 35 months doing cash.   Etc...etc... I think the variety of experience you get on a private client (ie; you are the one associate that does 80% of the FSLIs) is more useful than controls testing after controls testing.  Also, some clients do quarterly reviews / controls testing for sub to parent requirements - so it's the same form with a lot less of an admin headache that SoX brings."

Having passed CFAL1 I can say that the CFA would be useless for anything related to Sales and Trading. S&T generally relies on technical analysis which is barely touched upon in the CFA curriculum. Additionally most people who pass all three CFA levels can do much better than PWM. I generally see people with the CFA working in Equity Research, Portfolio Management, or operations at a fund. CFA teaches the basics of fundamental analysis, which is useful for investing and researching; not trading."
Accounting,3dm2ou,ASitl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:54:19 2015 UTC,"ER is a good point, but how does portfolio management differ from s&t / pwm?"
Accounting,3dm2ou,AmIAManOrAMuppet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:49:23 2015 UTC,"So I am speaking in broad strokes here because obviously PM, S&T, and PWM could encompass a very large number of jobs. The only thing that 'portfolio management' explicitly means is that it's your job to manage some sort of group of financial assets for other people (it doesn't supply any information on the strategy used to generate returns on that basket of assets).   In general though people who talk about portfolio managers are talking about the managers of a mutual fund or some sort of investment partnership. The investment style in these basic funds is generally fundamental analysis; think discounted cash flow model, porter's five forces, growth potential, and other qualitative considerations. Your picking a stock or bond that you think will grow in value in the long term.   A job in sales and trading would rely more on technical analysis than fundamental analysis and that's why the skill sets aren't the same. The guy in S&T is probably setting up bollinger bands, analyzing where the stock price is in relation to a 30-60 day moving average, or using some other statistical analysis to make trades in the short term. A S&T employee doesn't care about the actual value of the underlying asset, they are generating returns by predicting the supply and demand of an asset in the market in the short term.  So basically the difference here is fundamental vs. technical analysis.  Fundamental Analysis: Find assets that are under priced based on their growth prospects or value, buy those assets, and sell them when the market prices them appropriately (or the inverse via shorting).  Technical Analysis: Observe patterns in the market and try to exploit them for profit in the short term.  Technical analysis isn't really covered in the CFA material outside of some cursory introduction and basic techniques.  I also mentioned PWM. I think my delivery of this point was clumsy. I didn't mean to say the CFA didn't have skills that could be used in PWM, because I think it does (especially when combined with the CPA but that's another story), but that most people who earn the CFA can achieve higher paying/more prestigious jobs than in PWM.  I see the jobs in PWM as mostly sales jobs. Sure it's your job to manage the tax structure and investment strategy for wealthy people but that basically just involves investing them in mutual funds where someone else does the actual stock/bond/asset picking and creates the investment strategy. My understanding is that a PWM job for most people is just cold calling potential clients and trying to sell them your services."
Accounting,3dm2ou,babyballz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:23:19 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that the institutional investing type jobs you are referencing as fulfilling the ""PM"" role would still fall under the larger S&T umbrella (along with HF, pwm, prop shops, etc. etc.).  Is that not true?  Is the PM designation more of a stand alone classification?"
Accounting,3dm2ou,wannabetechexec,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:53:19 2015 UTC,"Sales and Trading is a very specific business segment at an investment bank. The Sales team sells assets or trading ideas to clients. The trading team makes proprietary trades for the Investment Bank. Goldman Sachs has a large Sales and Trading group. You can't invest in a Sales and Trading group (keep this in mind at the end).  Private Wealth Management is completely different (and definitely not under the same umbrella) and can either be a business segment at a bank, or at a standalone firm. Northwest Mutual is a standalone Private Wealth Management company. JP Morgan also has a PWM arm. They are basically financial advisors who sell a bunch of junk insurance products.   Portfolio Management (or the 'Portfolio Manager' job title) is also under a completely different umbrella. These are people who manage mutual funds or hedge funds. This is an example of a portfolio manager (this is the first fund that came up on google, I have no idea who this other than the fact that she manages this mutual fund): http://www3.troweprice.com/fb2/fbkweb/management.do?ticker=TRBCX  Basically people will come to her with investing ideas (in this case probably just 'hot stocks' which is lame) and she will make the ultimate decision where to invest the money in the fund. Note that while a trader in S&T is trading with the banks money, the portfolio manager is managing a group of investors money.   Carl Icahn, George Soros, Bill Ackman, etc. are all portfolio managers (more specifically, hedge fund managers, but really there is no difference here); their funds have money from outside investors, and they invest the money as they see fit. Obviously their strategies will be more complex than the mutual fund linked above, but the general idea is that people give their funds money, they invest the money, the amount of money in the fund increases, and then people take money out once there is a substantial return."

I switched last year to a top 10 firm and I didn't get a big bump in pay. Also, I'm still considered an associate even though I should be at a senior level. This summer I've been senioring some jobs and have taken on more responsibility. My question is what should I expect to be getting paid? I'm five years in, in the northeast making 65k a year.

Accounting,3dm2ou,90210z,3,Fri Jul 17 15:19:07 2015 UTC,A lot of times this comes down to just feeling out the situation. Yes you can blow it and have a company rescind their initial offer and take offense by you making a counteroffer. My theory is that if you feel they have made a pretty decent offer and you really like the opportunity then just roll with it. But if you really feel low-balled then it won't hurt to try. Also if you're working with a recruiter then that recruiter might have a feel for how the client deals with it. I have some clients that I know for a fact they lowball initially and I ALWAYS make a counter. I hate playing that game but that's how they do it.

Got let go from another local firm last year because they were overstaffed. I have been in touch with recruiters in my area, but no job openings have thrilled me. I applied to some jobs (apart from the recruiters), got some interviews, but no offers. Those jobs I applied for were a long shot I guess, i.e., moving into a ""Finance Manager"" role at private companies.  I'm not sure I will get promoted to senior staff this year. I'm not sure what to do with my career right now. I feel very ready to take on managerial responsibilities and I would like a pay bump, but the public firm I am at seems to be somewhat stingy (no bonuses) and slow to promote. I feel like I was shafted in the salary department when I had to make a lateral move from one local public firm to another last year at about the same salary.  Question:  Any advice on what to do if I AM or AM NOT promoted to senior this year?"
Accounting,3dm2ou,Pestilence_XIV,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:32:14 2015 UTC,"If you dont have your CPA work on that first. My question is: why have you not been promoted already? You have 4 busy seasons, you should have been promoted by now. If you're not promoted I would talk to your current firm's management about what the realistic timeframe for that might be. Let them know you're ready. Let them know you want it.  See what they say. If you are promoted, then you should stick it out there and get at least a year of actual managment experience under your belt. Yes you are underpaid as well."

It was promotion time when I was let go from the previous firm in 2014, but we had a large 3rd year staff class and they weren't going to promote everyone. The ones they didn't promote, they let go. I feel like I can be a bit timid when it comes to sticking up for myself (I am my own worst critic type thing). BUT I feel very ready to run engagements and I have (not many, but I ran a review of a manufacturer 2 years ago) but I don't have a ton of experience with that. Bleh.  I'm assuming I was not promoted at this new firm since they figured they needed some time to see my work and evaluate my performance.  Any thoughts on what a fair salary might be?

""The Revenge of the Nerd"" - this person was bullied throughout school, but probably mostly because they're an asshole and not because they look like a dork.

They stay out of the drama, but participate in the happy hours, etc. They don't brag or act like they are as knowledgeable as they are, and tend to pass the praise to the people on his/her team.

Accounting,3dmrwi,taxtaxi,3,Fri Jul 17 21:05:03 2015 UTC,Looks like I can recognize myself here.
Accounting,3dmrwi,snakesnake9,3,Fri Jul 17 16:16:36 2015 UTC,"I've got a few (all based on people I've seen at my firm):   The ""Audit is just my day job"" person.  They've usually been around a while, often times even longer than the partners. Their exact age and start date is a mystery to most as nobody was working there when they joined. They're usually manager or senior manager level and that's all they'll ever be but they're fine with that. They might have seen everything and know every trick in the trade but audit is just a background activity for them. Most of their life takes place outside of the office. Usually they have a fulfilling family life, possibly a side source of income from some wisely purchased rental properties and once it's 5PM, they're out the door to do what they really want to do in life. They don't stress and they don't make other people stress but they do get the job done.  The ""Whiner"". They hate everything about audit. They whine about how much they hate their job and how they want to do something else. But despite all that, they are in fact lost puppies as they don't actually know what they want to do with their career. As such they stay around for surprisingly long and don't take any steps towards an alternative career since they don't know what that should be. So they're still here but hating it. A miserable existence.  The ""Lifer"". These are the people who live and breathe audit. They know the audit file and IFRS references by heart (which fortunately for the rest of us, they're happy to share) and even take pride in it. They truly love the process of auditing and make their way up the ranks quickly. If the performance review comes back anything below 'above average' they'll be furious. All the company slogans they know, every initiative they're a part of. Their working hours are far longer than everyone else's, evenings and weekends are commonplace. Their Linkedin profiles are bare bones to non existent since they don't see themselves as anything other than as a partner in their current firm.  The ""Phantom of the department"". Nobody knows this person exists. They're always out at a client site with a small team. They don't talk to many other people, you almost never see them in the office and they don't go to socials. You can be in the department for years without knowing about the existence of this individual.  The ""wannabe banker"" (I categorize myself in this subgroup). They're only in audit because they couldn't get to an Ibank straight from university. Excel skills are good due to having taught themselves how to build financial models, often have their own (real or virtual) stock portfolios. Spend a lot of time polishing their Linkedin profiles and do everything possible to not make themselves seem like an accountant/auditor.  The ""how did they get promoted"" person. They do minimal work (and often take credit for that of others), come in late and leave early, know very little about the client or the audit work. For someone who's been in accounting/finance for several years, their grasp of Excel is basic to say the least. Yet somehow they still end up getting promoted.  The ""spinning their wheels in place."" These people have fallen far far behind on their accounting exams, often a year or more behind their peer group. They haven't really progressed upwards in their responsibilities and still do relatively basic work. If anyone were to be let go for performance issues it would be them....yet somehow they're still here.  The ""social butterfly"". Though their work might be mediocre and their technical knowledge spotty, they are the life of the department. They spread and generate gossip. They organize socials and are generally pleasant to be around. Everyone likes them.  The ""how did I get here?"". These people are relatively competent but not as passionate as the ""Lifers"". They progress up the ranks in an orderly manner but this might not be what they really want to do. However just like the ""whiners"" they also don't know where their real interests lie and as such stick around."

Accounting,3dow3g,payrolzolz,6,Sat Jul 18 01:22:22 2015 UTC,"Totally depends on how reliable your in-house bookkeeper/payroll is. For small companies, I always advise ADP because your liability and expenses are handled, and you don't get into any sticky situations. Let me tell you from personal experience, you do not want to screw up payroll withholdings and payments to the state and feds. It will not end well. They are not forgiving. Doing payroll is not something easy that anybody can do, if you're going to do it in house, make sure that the person you have doing it has an excellent track record. Doing the checks each week seems really easy, but at the end of the quarter when you go to report it, it can suddenly seem rather daunting. Just make sure you have a good system in place."
Accounting,3dow3g,svane,2,Sat Jul 18 03:06:30 2015 UTC,"As someone that deals with ADP, I'm going to advise against it but it also depends on the size and situation of the company you work for.  Your mileage may vary with them; they have a fantastic sales team that will make you want to buy the bridge in the middle of Arizona, but we've had more than a few instances where hours were incorrectly reported, pay was shortened for people (not fun to explain), and liabilities were not accurate.     Are you multi-state?  Do you have a lot of employees (50 is the magic number)?  Those are good questions to ask and have a feel for future expansion.  Payroll is more than data entry; a lot of people will automatically assume all you do is press ""yes"" on the computer and it spits out paychecks.  Each state has its own rules, its own quirks, plus caps that can change multiple times during a year.       Overpaying on a Federal level does not equate you getting a refund more often than not.  Explaining to your boss why he or she paid out an extra amount because you didn't calculate the cap right is not a position you want to be in.  Even worse is when you didn't pay in enough.  Payroll to some can be easy in certain situations; there are those of us out there that actually like it.  But its more than just punching in numbers to a spreadsheet or program.  Often it is outsourced just to take the headache away and so the hours can be better spent elsewhere.  You will, however, still want someone that knows the rules and regs to review your payroll regardless."
Accounting,3dow3g,Dhajjfas,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:44:26 2015 UTC,"Exactly. ADP is great if you are working in multiple states as well (construction, for example) and I agree, if you have under 50 employees. I've yet to have any serious problems with them. I enter the payroll all online. I've been very happy with them for years. But I'm usually comparing it to someone else's massive inhouse failure!"
Accounting,3dow3g,svane,2,Sat Jul 18 03:59:54 2015 UTC,ADP sucks and it's expensive. Find yourself a small quality local CPA/payroll service company with a good track record. Much less costly and better service.

Accounting,3dow3g,limited_comments,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:14:52 2015 UTC,"Depending on the size of the organization and the number of employees you would have to track, payroll can be incredibly time consuming, which is why there are payroll service companies, they wouldn't exist if they didn't provide a benefit.  We have a staff of about 120 and we outsource payroll.  Even then our accounting assistant that handles payroll spends a large portion of man-hours a week on it.  A small company with less to track may be easier, but a small company would also be paying an out-sourced processor less too.  In short is is outsourced because it can be tediously time consuming and occasionally complex, (occasionally) best left to specialists, keeping organization man-hours free for organizational value added services."
Accounting,3dow3g,Tomek1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:25:55 2015 UTC,"I was recently on a 401k audit and saw a client using ZenPayroll, basically a silicon valley startup that competes with ADP and offers way better pricing.  Its $25/month plus $4/person/month and the client told me they prefer it over ADP.  Might wanna check that out.  But yes, as others have mentioned, the IRS and the states are very unforgiving about messing up Payroll and it is very easy in some states."
Accounting,3dow3g,maerabug,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:09:41 2015 UTC,Outsourced payroll typically includes the tax forms too. Tax forms will take/waste hours of your time quarterly/annually. The $100/month or whatever for paychex/ADP is worth it.

All of the other majors in the college of business at my university were completely worthless unemployment generators.  Of course, there are exceptions to this. If you know you want to specialize in a certain industry, it can help to have a degree related to that industry. There is a partner at my firm who has a degree in Electrical Engineering. He specializes in energy clients.  Do a hobby major. Take random classes you enjoy. Go throw some discs, play hacky sack, and lift some weights. Seriously, it doesn't matter."

Econ can be hit and miss; there are some Econ programs that are very quantitative and rigorous which makes you more marketable for those roles when compared to the more theoretical Econ programs. This probably depends a lot too on the reputation of those majors specifically for your business program; your recruiters will probably know which one is most valuable.  That being said, International Business is never a bad choice. I wish I'd taken more classes like that when I had the opportunity. You may have a good study abroad opportunity and it's a very good major if you have a lot of interest in other countries. Honestly, I don't think you can make a mistake in this area. I know that for me a Marketing/Accounting double major would stand out if I were reviewing resumes, for example. I think the most memorable combination I saw when I was helping out with on-campus recruiting was an accounting major with a dance minor. Kickass interviewer too."

Accounting,3dnjbs,Smalltimeaccountant,9,Fri Jul 17 18:42:32 2015 UTC,Good advice so far.  Another suggestion: Create a closing schedule.  Get it circulated to all parties involved and chat with them.  That way they know what is expected and when.
Accounting,3dnjbs,allbeefpatties,2,Fri Jul 17 19:40:52 2015 UTC,I agree. It's a great way to use Parkinson's Law to your advantage.
Accounting,3dnjbs,MadCapitalist,8,Fri Jul 17 21:23:46 2015 UTC,"I suggest implementing a hard close immediately. I used QuickBooks at my most recent job, and I would close each period and protect it with a password. That's the first thing. You will drive yourself crazy if people are constantly making changes to prior periods.    Secondly, I believe in being extremely methodical. I had a checklist of all the recurring journal entries that I needed to make each month (e.g. adjust prepaid expenses, accrue expenses, accrue/defer revenue, etc.). Most of these journal entries have a very similar structure from month to month, so I had journal entry templates saved in QuickBooks and great supporting spreadsheets that made preparing the entries much easier. The key to speed is to make it very systematic.    I also believe in being extremely disciplined. Every single balance sheet account was reconciled to the penny every month. A few times I took jobs with companies that were way behind on their reconciliations. I found that the best way out of that kind of mess is to make a line in the sand and make sure that all accounting activity is reconciled from this point forward, even if the prior period activity hasn't been reconciled yet. If you don't do it this way, it is extremely difficult to ""stop the bleeding.""    I also designed spreadsheets where I could export trial balances to Excel and just plop into a worksheet that would automatically populate financial statements. It was a huge time saver.    So basically take a look at each step of the process and see how it can be streamlined and automated as much as possible."
Accounting,3dnjbs,MadCapitalist,8,Fri Jul 17 19:03:21 2015 UTC,"I manage month-end closing.  I agree with the guy above on hard closing.  I create a journal entry template in excel that I fill in to make sure I haven't missed anything.  I also keep excel templates of prepaid amortization, WIP accruals, ect.  This is all stored on a dedicated network folder that holds each months closing support.  It becomes an automatic process after a few times if you stay organized.  I suggest writing down you process the first time you do it.  Each month make improvements and streamline the process.  Don't try to go to fast at first or you will fuck it up and look like a dummy."
Accounting,3dnjbs,OGaccountant,4,Fri Jul 17 19:25:05 2015 UTC,"Awesome, that's basically the steps I've been trying to take(catching some resistance from current staff that is used to doing things one way).  I've implemented a hard close on both our ERP system and our A/R software(Tracked in a separate system and moved in the G/L later).  The main problems now are: almost every step in the process is manual, from A/P through to any closing entries.  Number 2, we're trying to self insure.  In order to self insure, they want to see three years of audited financials, which means my line in the sand is 2012 lol."

Accounting,3dnjbs,iamdan2000,3,Fri Jul 17 20:51:30 2015 UTC,Wow. There needs to be some hard set deadlines. Closing out a month 3 months later is absurd. We have 2 days for p n l accounts and 3 days for balance sheet accounts. And we only have 2 weeks after month end to reconcile our balance sheet accounts. If you don't get your entries done by then then tough shit. Fix it the month after and book retroactively. Everything's pretty much on lockdown after the deadlines.  I sympathize with you. Its going to be quite the project
Accounting,3dnjbs,allbeefpatties,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:58:04 2015 UTC,"We try to reconcile as we close the month.  The obvious examples are bank accounts.  But pre-paid expenses and accruals can be reconciled as you're closing.  You should have a schedule (fancy spreadsheet) for each type and then you can reconcile the amount on the balance sheet vs that schedule.  Make changes as needed to reconcile.   But if you're pro-active, you should know what the balances will be heading into month-end."

Accounting,3dolhq,KnightCPA,2,Sat Jul 18 12:43:06 2015 UTC,"For advisory/consulting, you don't need CPA or accounting, but you should have at least taken a few classes. Even if you have a high gpa, good grades, and the classes, consulting interviews from companies like Accenture involve case studies, so do note that you definitely need to be able to succeed in those if you want an offer.  Note, I graduated in Econ and I'm in Big 4....you should have taken accounting classes along with your Econ major to be honest and you could have gotten a Big 4 offer...it's not like your major had to be accounting, you just needed your 150 units (which is not difficult) your soft skills are probably lacking as well, so you need to work on that if you are getting interviews, but no offers."

You need to figure out first if you're doing management consulting (companies would be Bain, BCG, Mckinsey), or advisory/accounting (Big 4) before you figure out whether you could get a Macc/Masters in Finance/etc, but there are some pretty good Macc schools where you don't need a background in accounting..my friend was an english major , did photography/poetry for a decade, and then went back to a Macc program and now works at PwC.

What makes you believe that? I can't think of many actual companies (non-consulting firms) that need a full-time, year-round, in-house ERP guy. That's why they hire consultants for that type of thing."
Accounting,3dnzf1,ZCPA2,3,Fri Jul 17 22:31:07 2015 UTC,I would say most public companies have ERP/system teams...
Accounting,3dnzf1,Expertinthis,2,Sat Jul 18 13:30:43 2015 UTC,"That's what I was kind of wondering. My thought process is that a ERP consultant would get a broad understanding of different businesses inventory, ecommerce, accounting systems, and supply chain issues. They also would have a broad understanding of their IT set up.   So similarly to how an accounting company doesn't need in house auditors (well IA but that's different), but it sets you up to be on revenue recognition/controller/CFO route.   I thought that ERP consultants may take you down a similar path. The thing is it seems like way way less people start out as ERP consultants so it's kind of hard to find out what the career path looks like.   That was another thing I was thinking in my decision, there's 150+ audit positions filled in my city each year, but it seems there may only be a handful ERP consultants. None of the B4 have ERP consulting in my city. But that would mean less people are competing for those CIO/COO jobs compared to CFO. Granted I would probably need a MBA to get there."
Accounting,3dnzf1,speier,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:43:18 2015 UTC,"Most ERP consultants I know either stay in the area or move into IT internal audit.  From IT IA you could move into an IT management position then to CIO but I can't think of an instance where someone went from ERP consulting to CIO.  Perhaps if you made it to the project manager level in the ERP consulting firm then you could cross over to CIO.  To use your accounting firm example, firms with ERP systems are generally large firms so the people they are looking for CFO are probably going to be senior managers or partners.  So you are talking 8+ years in public accounting before crossing over into C-suite."

If you don't feel comfortable excluding it, put down 2 GPAs, 1 major and 1 overall.  And 'major' GPA to me is just the classes required to obtain your degree.  I double majored and my major GPA was the average of all my classes required for the 2 programs.

Accounting,3doakj,TheDudeAbides31,2,Fri Jul 17 22:11:44 2015 UTC,"Married, filing separately will put you and your wife in the same tax brackets as filing single and will disqualify both of you from many tax credits (though you may not qualify for any without children.) While you may make smaller payments on student loans, you will likely both pay just as much, if not more in taxes. Additionally, you will be paying more in interest on your student loans due to smaller payments. This will make paying off your student loan take longer.  It is worth looking into, but I wouldn't get your hopes up."

Since I'm a teacher and qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, the balance on my loans will disappear after 10 years (or 120 qualified payments).   Also, under my current plan, I'm schedule to pay off the entire $57k in 10 years. If I go the Pay as you EArn route, I will have only paid off a total of $37k after 10 years, with the remaining $20k forgiven by the government with no tax penalty.

Accounting,3dn601,accountingquest,4,Fri Jul 17 17:04:26 2015 UTC,"I'd say that those books would not be of much use to you even if they were from Canada. Your professors are going to assign comprehensive textbooks and study materials for you, more than you'll probably want. Start with what your professor assigns and if you are having trouble you can ask questions in office hours, study with peers, and ask questions online (even here!). There isn't too much value in school for studying unrelated notes for other classes before you even start."
Accounting,3dn601,JoeClarksville,2,Fri Jul 17 17:11:07 2015 UTC,"We use GAAP standards in the US (used only in America), Canada uses IFRS (probably with its own little twists sometimes). Many ""rules"" are very similar, but there are differences too. However, since we've been trying to switch from GAAP to IFRS American students have been learning IFRS as well. So in your textbooks you should have explanations/rules for IFRS used in Canada too. In any case, just enjoy your free time now because hell is coming."
Accounting,3dn601,taxtaxi,3,Fri Jul 17 17:08:38 2015 UTC,"Also Canada doesn't only make use of IFRS but also ASPE (Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises). Public companies must use IFRS while private companies typically use ASPE but can elect to use IFRS instead. So the textbooks your cousin gave you will be missing this whole component and equal emphasis is placed on both standards in Canadian courses.  Also its great that your cousin went through the trouble but like JoeClarksville said, they probably wouldn't be much use to you since you'll be assigned course textbooks and trust me, you will be busy enough with those."

The US as far as I know call their framework ""US GAAP"" but and framework that is accepted as the relevant practices for the jurisdiction or industry you operate in would be considered to be the generally accepted principals for that area. Therefore even though you are learning ""GAAP"" in your highschool class you are learning the basic principles of accounting that likely apply to all frameworks (US, IFRS, etc) and as you learn more in university you start to get into the more specific principals that differentiate the different types of GAAPs."

Section 179 shows on line 11 of the K-1 but that also shows on Sch E p2.   If the company made 600M, without anyother info, 600m will be taxed whether they withdrew any or all.   For S-corps, its the net income that is taxed, not the amount withdrawn."
Accounting,3dmtl1,whitemonkey11,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:35:29 2015 UTC,"Schedule E is where you report the ordinary items of income passed through to the shareholder by the S Corp.  It is not the only schedule where S Corp items of income show up though.  For instance, interest and dividend income would be reported on Schedule B.  1231 Gains would be reported on Form 4797, etc.  Also, the S Corp's income is reported and taxed on the shareholder's return whether it is distributed or not.  In your example, if the company showed a $600M taxable profit and distributed $150M to the shareholder, the shareholder still has to report and pay tax on the $600M profit.  The fact that they only got $150M in cash doesn't matter.  The $600M in profit increases their basis int he stock of the S Corp, and the $150M distribution reduces it.  If their basis at the beginning of the year was zero, they'd have a $450M basis at year end.  If, next year, the company breaks even and distributes $450M to the shareholder, they don't have any income to report,  as the distribution is just a tax-free return of basis."

Long hours seem less bad if the group generally gets up and moving at 10am.   We have so many people that are follows Judaism pretty strictly, so if you have to be home or whatever for sabbath at 6pm, does it make sense for you to have an hour commute from Brooklyn or NJ to get in at 10am and leave at 5pm to get home in time? Or does it make more sense to work remotely? From that, a lot of non-Jewish people decided to work remote Fridays as well. I'd say we have maybe 60-70% attendance on most Fridays. If I want to work remotely I do. I'm in today, but that's by choice.   It's not really seasonally dependant. We are ramping our our 2nd busy season already, and the office isn't exactly packed today. People are working, but not from the office, from their apartments or whatever.  Again, it's really dependant on the office location and the group.

I don't think he meant staying until Senior Manager/Director/Partner level.  (The former is actually a fairly common approach for people in public accounting. Most people after a few years -- if they hadn't already -- decide if their goal is to stay and try to become a partner, which involves buying an ownership interest in a firm -- or to use the experience and contacts they have within public accounting to jump ship after a few years to position outside of public accounting.

Accounting,3djq73,Rjpbubbleboy,15,Thu Jul 16 23:49:55 2015 UTC,"Because anytime I mistakenly answer one it results in a really fucking awkward conversation and sometimes I throw things around the office.  Here's how the call usually goes:  ""So are you happy with your current position?"" as I'm sitting in earshot of my entire team and half a dozen partners.   ""Yeah, I can't complain. I enjoy the work and love the people I work with. I'm pretty happy with where I'm at.""  ""And do you mind me asking how much you make currently? I'd like to put you in front of some companies where I promise that you could get 10-20% more and have better work life balance."" - That's where I hang up the phone, and I block you.  Here's the thing - If I want to look around, I'll call you. For some reason, recruiters seem to think that everyone is always unhappy where they are and are always looking for the next greener better pasture. What really pisses me off is when I tell you I'm not interested and then you proceed to continue sending me bullshit emails listing jobs that either a) are not in my industry or b) I'm not remotely qualified for. And then you fucking call me again in a week to ""follow up on our discussion about my great opportunities."" If you can't follow instructions or even give the appearance of having your shit together, I sure as hell am not going to trust you to try and find me a job that I'll like. Oh, and when you send me a message on LinkedIn and can't even get my damn name correct.  TL;DR - Because recruiters are terrible at what they do 99% of the time, so I stopped paying any attention to you."

Accounting,3djq73,theburnoutcpa,5,Thu Jul 16 22:18:12 2015 UTC,Honestly computanti hit the nail on the head. You should confirm if someone is at work before you start asking them about their job. I stopped answering recruiters after the 2nd or 3rd phone call asking if I'm happy with my job while I'm sitting in the middle of the office. Just ask them if they are interested in further discussion and that you will email them or call them on lunch/after hours.
Accounting,3djq73,JoeClarksville,9,Fri Jul 17 02:08:36 2015 UTC,"Are you coldcalling people at work? If so, it's not uncommon for people not to answer random calls from numbers they don't recognize at work when they are busy or preoccupied. I know personally I can go for hours without even glancing at my phone if I'm backed up with client meetings or presentations. In addition, if you're calling to a big firm phone system bear in mind that most of us are not in the office at all and maybe 30% of us know how to receive those calls from elsewhere.   Anyway, I don't want to tell you your business. Just make sure your voicemails get to the point, and are not too rambly or unclear or hard to follow. Don't sound too rehearsed; maybe have a loose script with just some key bullet points that you need to get down. I'm sure there's nothing wrong with you as an individual -- coldcalling is brutal because of the low response rates for everyone who does it -- but it's something worth considering if you think that you are having more trouble than is realistic."
Accounting,3djq73,teetopp,5,Thu Jul 16 21:09:23 2015 UTC,"It's not that your customers don't like the money you're offering, its just the constant pushiness to fill jobs that might be poorly suited or even worse than the jobs your customers have. Changing jobs is a pretty big decision, and it requires a lot of thought on the part of your customer, who usually has to juggle a lot of deadlines and internal pressures on top of hearing your sales pitch. Most of them will jump ship at some point, but at that point, they'll reach out to you or anyone else in vast undying army of the recruiters."
Accounting,3djq73,elpachucasunrise,3,Thu Jul 16 20:59:41 2015 UTC,"That's a good point also. A lot of times recruiters focus on the benefits of the job rather than trying to find jobs that make sense for the individual. The challenge may come from the fact that recruiters don't necessarily understand the industry that they're recruiting for or have enough insight into the mindset of the people they're recruiting for, at least when they first start out.)  They obviously can't tailor a job opportunity to a stranger, but not everyone working in Big 4 public accounting is interested in working at a hedge fund or knows anything about hedge funds (even in New York)."

Accounting,3djq73,Vlakmir786,5,Thu Jul 16 22:03:55 2015 UTC,I have no idea what your messages read like. But all the ones I get are from recruiters who clearly haven't read my profile. They are just spamming people's linkedin messages. There is nothing in my profile that would suggest I am qualified to work at a hedge fund yet I get messages about positions at hedge funds all the time. I'm going to ignore any recruiter who is sending me random jobs without considering if it would be right for me.
Accounting,3djq73,outaccountant,5,Fri Jul 17 00:54:43 2015 UTC,"So the reason why I don't respond to most linkedin messages is the majority of them basically say they have this great opportunity as so and so role in so and so industry. Every opportunity that every recruiter has is a great opportunity and that is not enough for me to act upon (i.e. no one is gonna lead the convo by saying you have a shitty opportunity so saying it is great doesn't tell me anything).   What would get me to at least reply is if the salary is stated or whether the role was a promotion. In my case, any lateral move will likely result in a pay cut or a minor increase of maybe 5k or less. This is how I filter through the messages quickly. This is just in my case though but it should provide you some insight."
Accounting,3djq73,ASitl,5,Thu Jul 16 23:26:13 2015 UTC,"Spend 1-2 more minutes per message by personalizing it to that person. Pick out something in their experience that actually relates to the job you are recruiting for. State exactly why you think it is a great opportunity, and don't forget to explain why it is a great opportunity FOR THEM. Also, asking them a question, like if you want them to expand on something in their profile, will show that you read their profile and are interested."

If you have very good opportunities, the goal is to find high rated staff/seniors.  Also, offer to work with the person with no strings attached, you will completely respect their decisions, and will never push client interviews on them.  When you find potential clients, write them an e-mail including the client prepared information, potential salary, etc.  Even offer to just have a quick call, and be open to putting you on a list of top candidates as jobs come across your desk- create research for them, let them decide to contact you if they see something that sparks their interest.  We want to be able to read about potential opportunities and speak to our network about it before wasting anyones time.  I spoke to one recruiter and this was a bother of mine.  I want information to help decide if I should give up my year after year top ratings to work in private, not just take the current opportunity on your desk at the time.

Linfield is a real school with a real campus and it has been there since 1858.  It is accredited and has a good online program for accounting majors.  I'm a Linfield alum.  After law school, I planned to take the prerequisite classes to sit for the CPA exam.  They will give you a certificate if you complete the core classwork.  However, I found that by paying a slightly higher application fee and taking two extra classes (as well as transferring units), that I could earn a B.S. in accounting.  I thought it was worth it, so I went for the degree instead of the certificate.  I didn't do the online program.  It wasn't available when I was there, so I took evening and weekend classes at their satellite campuses in Oregon.  So take a good look at Linfield.  It is not one of those phony for-profit schools and has a good reputation.  Linfield also has one of the top Division III football programs in the country, so if you like football, you'll have another great team to follow.  Finally, the customer service at Linfield is excellent.  To graduate early, I wanted to take a class and its prerequisite at the same time.

Accounting,3dl82a,pizzaburgers,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:20:57 2015 UTC,"No offence, but this topic has been covered a lot. Try searching or using a FAQ. Generally, you will need 3.2 GPA above to be considered for public accounting jobs anyway. So essentially I'll lay it out in a few easy steps: 1.) apply to accounting program, be sure to look up the prerequisites for the CPA program and complete those courses to be eligible to get your designation 2.) (optional) do an internship or co-op term(s) 3.) Participate in what is called accounting recruit in september to network and apply for jobs  4.) If you obtained job in step 3, proceed to step 5. If not, you will apply to various organizations in the industry offering accounting roles. 5.) Apply to the CPA program in your region. Find said region here (https://cpacanada.ca/). If you are with a firm they will walk you through what you need to do here and may even pay for your courses. If you are in industry it will be a lot more involved process for you to get your work experience documented and may have to pay for CPA courses out of pocket. 6.) See the doors open and choose something that interests you  Regarding your comment about moving to another city. I have tried to do this and it is difficult to do if you do not have contacts in the city in which you are trying to move to. It is also difficult because it can be difficult to get into recruiting events if you are not with the local university. That said it is possible with effective networking and a strong application. The location also makes a difference: Toronto/Vancouver are incredibly competitive and will be hard to get a job even if you are at a target school, other cities which people may not want to move to and a have smaller ""white collar"" base are easier such as Edmonton, Winnipeg, etc. Hope that gets you started."

Accounting,3dkhg3,kes1410,3,Fri Jul 17 00:20:19 2015 UTC,"*I'd prefer to go into managerial accounting; however, it seems like I need my CPA, or a lot of experience, to even get started in the field. Am I just not looking hard enough, or am I right?   They are extremely rare without experience, but they do exist. Example: http://www.gillig.com/#!positions/cz6k   *I graduated with 126 credits. Should I be looking to get the rest at CC, or go to get my Masters? Then should I be trying my hardest to find a decent MAcc program, or is an MBA going to suffice?   If it's been 1.5 years, and you haven't been working in accounting, I would HIGHLY recommend the MAcc. It's hard to get a job after being out of school with no job in accounting. Recruiters will be skeptical.   *I didn't have an internship.   Me either. You're fine.   How much is my GPA going to matter   A lot for your first job. Which is another reason I suggest the MAcc route. 3.1 isn't terrible, but it isn't amazing.   *How easy is it to get a CPA job?   Are you talking about a job in public accounting that will lead to you getting a CPA license? Quite easy for graduating accounting students who will have 150 units. You can't get a ""CPA job"" without being a CPA. This requires you to work for 2 years under a CPA and pass the uniform CPA exam.   What is the normal amount of time to stay with the first firm that hires you?   I don't plan on leaving. A lot of people leave after 2-3 years. This really depends on your career goals.   *What is the typical amount a CPA firm will pay for a CPA.   This implies you have two years of work experience, 150 units, and have passed all four parts of the CPA exam. If you are asking how much you will make as an auditor or tax accountant at a public CPA firm, $42-65k. This depends on your region and the size of the firm you go to work for. I live in a low COL area, and started at 47.5k as a tax accountant. They paid for all fees related to the CPA exam.   My adviser made it sound like the CPA exam is going to be crazy difficult - like if you don't take a really good prep course, you're probably going to fail (yes, I do understand you need to study). Was she exaggerating?   No. The CPA exam takes ~400 hours of studying to give you an ~88% chance of passing. It takes a lot of work, but I wouldn't say it's difficult work.   *When should I start looking for CPA jobs? I know that I'm getting the in game a little late, would it be best to wait until I get my credits, or should I start ASAP.   Right now, but they won't let you start working until after you have 150 units. Did you not network while in school?   *How do you apply for CPA jobs? My adviser told me to just send in applications wherever I can basically, but I am always use to having to look for job postings. I just want to follow proper etiquette   Most people are recruited out of your school's Meet The Firms recruitment event in the Fall. Did you not go to your accounting club meetings? Typically there are a few dozen firms that give presentations each semester at those."
Accounting,3dkhg3,Tamerlee,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:41:03 2015 UTC,"You keep saying 'CPA job,' I'm going to assume you mean a job in public accounting.  In terms of your question to managerial, I'm sure there are jobs out there but entry level not on track to getting your certification/having it the options will be limited/less desirable. Doesn't mean you can't work your way up.  With essentially 2 semesters to go to 150, you might as well do a MAcc and get the added benefit of recruiting opportunities. And the MAcc would suffice instead of doing an MBA, not the other way around. Also, you would probably want to leave the option open to do the MBA later in case that's something you want to pursue. It's not recommended that you do your MBA without experience as most programs that will take you now aren't worth it.  Not having done an internship won't hurt you but it won't help either.  Your GPA isn't spectacular but you should be able to work with it, especially if you just leave your cumulative off of your resume and just use your major GPA.  As long as you network, you should be able to find a position in public accounting, you're grades are there, you just need to be on track, or give the appearance of being on track, to complete the CPA exam. Typically the large accounting firms will reimburse you for the cost of Becker (or a program of equivalent cost, but Becker is the gold standard and to my knowledge is the priciest), and your exam fees on top of giving you a few days to sit for exams. They won't reimburse you for multiple study materials, that's overkill and it wouldn't be worth your time to do multiple study programs. Smaller firms will pay for some of these things. Not sure they would pay for a MAcc, maybe an MTax if you choose to go that route (but it doesn't sound like that's what you want to do).  The exam is probably the hardest test you will take because of the sheer amount of material. It takes people 3 months (if they do nothing but study all day) to a year on average to complete the exam. The pass rates hover around 50%, that includes retakes so the first time pass rate is lower.  If you do a MAcc, start looking this fall, that's when accounting firms do their recruiting. If you're school is decent they should be bringing the recruiters to your school and you can bump elbows with them at networking events and interview on campus. If not, you should seriously reevaluate if you want to be doing a masters program there. You can send your resume to recruiters cold but you'll be one of hundreds and will probably be glossed over."

So, for CLEP exams, the credit actually has to be transcribed by the university you graduated from. You can't graduate with your bachelors, and then go to a community college as a non-degree seeking student just to have your CLEP credits added to a separate community college transcript. However, it is acceptable to take actual courses at the community college after you've earned your bachelors degree, even if these courses are not going to show up on the transcript of the university that granted your bachelors degree.

Accounting,3dkrl8,Tamerlee,2,Fri Jul 17 01:53:39 2015 UTC,"Masters is a good fallback plan in case you don't get a FT offer from the internship and are left job hunting out of school. So make sure you're ready to go for fall 2016 (take gmat, apply) and you can always just not go/defer.  As for employers paying, there may be a catch, such as being required to work there for at least x more amount of years."
Accounting,3dkrl8,bluntwrapper,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:07:14 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry about pursuing a Masters in Taxation right away. Focus on your internship and obtaining a position at the firm or another firm. Learn the ropes for a year or two before pursuing the Masters. Most firms won't have expectations of you to get a Masters...the few that do won't push for it until you are near Manager level. In any case, your new employers will want you to focus on passing the CPA exam before a Masters in Taxation"
Accounting,3dkrl8,growthsourcecfo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:10:33 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you want to do.   Are you a tax person? Maybe you want an MST.   From there: do you want to become a tax lawyer? Maybe knock out MST in a year, get half a decade or more of tax experience while doing to law school at knight?  Do you have the credit required for the Accounting/General Business?   No need. Then if you want to get an MBA, you can start work earlier and get into an MBA program a year earlier.   Do you want to become a 6 figure or quarter million dollar accounting research professor?   You want to get a Masters before PhD.   The answer is tailored to your goals."

Accounting,3difji,llakes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:34:23 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you can also tailor the fairly standard skillset above to you (rather than just listing skills). For example, you have really strong verbal communication skills as a result of dealing with clients and dealing with difficult situations [clients] successfully. Strong organizational and team work skills as a result of work in a fast paced environment where you are required to work with the kitchen etc in order to deliver the client's order in a timely fashion, etc. I work in an audit firm and participate in the whole recruiting thing. What I realize is that what you did the past few years is not really relevant, it's your ability to sell yourself that really matters. Make sure you hit up any career fairs your school [or community] might hold as well because face time matters a lot as well!"

I know I landed my first public accounting internship because I said I love helping people and customer service.   The only problem is public accounting is not a 9-5 job. It's the means to a really really well paying 9-5 though.  Also to note, busy season is Jan-Mar and these internships are much easier to get and will really help your career blow up. Most kids don't want to push back graduation and look for summer internships, and there are less summer internships because their is less work.   Large firms will make you go full time to do a spring internship (and will pay around $30/hr for your time).  Small firms will allow you to go to school and work around 30 hrs around your schedule, which is pretty rough (and will pay you around $12-$20/hr for your time).  That's what I did and it was extremely helpful. You will need to at least get some accounting classes under your belt in the Fall so that they know you are serious about the profession."

I ended up with a 'duties' and 'skills utilized' section for each job.  I then summarized those skills at the top of the resume above my education.

This is because of a psychological concept called ""rationalization"" in which we need to justify our poor decisions after the fact the incredible opportunities that big four offers. With big four firms, you get to audit publicly traded companies and have global name recognition. How much do these really matter? They're the only things we have, don't try to take them from us.

Personally I haven't run into too many companies that only hired Big 4 alums; in fact, after a few years I find that people aren't super-interested in hearing about where you started working at age 22. The goal should be developing a strong professional reputation and networking as hard as you can.

Of course governmental and not for profit is worth reviewing too especially if you didn't study it in college. Look over the items relating to shareholder's equity as well, including the statement of cash flows, transactions in a company's own stock, and other details that may trip you up. In addition, don't overlook topics relating to IFRS.   Don't forget to consider the foreign currency accounting areas as well as the topics relating to business combinations and investments.

Accounting,3dijw3,fekkai,4,Thu Jul 16 15:39:09 2015 UTC,"Make sure you keep a PDF screenshot of the payment receipt. NASBA doesn't allow you to access them after payment and you'll have to dig through bank statements in order to retrieve adequate documentation for reimbursement.  As for your question, no it's not anymore time-consuming or expensive. But that depends on how your state charges your fee."
Accounting,3dijw3,teebowtime,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:43:53 2015 UTC,Are they not responsive if you call the number they provide on their website for requesting CPA exam fee receipts?

Accounting,3dijw3,ninjacereal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:46:39 2015 UTC,"Well for me I never got an actual receipt, just an NTS.

Accounting,3dijw3,teebowtime,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:50:28 2015 UTC,I think he's saying if you didn't retain the receipts when they were originally sent to you it might be hard to get NASBA to send you another copy. I took the CPA exam while I was in college so all of their original correspondence is in my school email which I don't even remember how to access. There is a number online to help retrieve the receipts but it's possible that they aren't very responsive when you reach out to them.
Accounting,3dijw3,JoeClarksville,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:58:38 2015 UTC,"I'll just throw out that I definitely agree with the practice of keeping records as you pay.

Accounting,3dijw3,sylvir,3,Thu Jul 16 19:19:21 2015 UTC,Your NTS expires after a certain amount of time. I'm in California and our NTS lasts for 9 months. So if we don't take the exams we registered and paid for then we have to reapply and pay the exam fees again. Different states have different NTS expiration periods though I think.
Accounting,3dijw3,net_gains,2,Thu Jul 16 16:21:16 2015 UTC,"Here in Nevada, it costs $100 the first time you sign up for a section, whether it be for all four or just one. The second time you sign up for one, it's $50. This is excluding the actual test fee. So it's advantageous to sign up for as many as you can take in one window because it will save you the extra $50 fee."

The difference is in the application fee for each exam. If you register for one, I believe it was like $60. However, if you register for all four, it was $120 total, effectively making the app fees $30 each. There's also a discount for applying for  2 or 3 at a time.   Hope this helps."

The case interview might have been the problem because of the comment they made about your business acumen but it's hard to tell.   Did you get any other feedback? If not, one thing that always helped me was to do some mock interviews through my school's career and resource center. It's common not to get any meaningful feedback in the aftermath of a 'bad' real interview but a mock interview will help you get a feel for where your weaknesses are so that you can work on them for your next recruiting cycle."

At least you completed the internship. I know people who got fired during their internship. One thing I cannot stand is people telling someone to consider private/some kind of alternative (nothing against alternatives, just as respectable and challenging) as if they will never succeed in public when it's still so early in your career.  Having internship experience on your resume is better than without. When do you graduate? How many more fall recruiting seasons do you have left? Reflect honestly on why you didn't get an offer and improve. Be prepared to talk about your internship experience, may include if you got an offer or not and why. No availability is a good reason for small firms, industry/specialty reasons may be applicable to B4 but then you would have to explain why you're interested in a certain industry. Recruiters want to make sure you're competent and not receiving an offer after an internship is a bit of a red flag, but how you interact with them will trump that.  Also, keep in touch with those who liked you, including recruiters, other interns, staff, seniors, managers, etc. Add them on linkedin, call/email every now and then as you see fit. Text if you're comfortable with that. Hell, I have some on fb."

This will usually only happen if you have multiple B4 offers and are using that leverage to move up your start date.    If you are set on starting in January, I would take the offer you are getting from the midsize  If you dont care about starting this January and can wait until summer, then where do you want to work?

I'm not sure how coveted they are, or if they are extremely boring or career limiting or what, but hey, 100k, government benefits, close to your home and 40 hour work weeks - not a bad gig. Not an ""amazing"" gig - but you'll definitely be able to live.  And to those that say 100k isn't enough in the bay area - honestly, it really is.

Accounting firms are ALWAYS, I repeat, ALWAYS, hiring. Ido u are a solid candidate they will make room for you, if they don't then fuck them and move on to the next company.

Accounting,3dgxtc,omfgtoast,2,Fri Jul 17 01:51:13 2015 UTC,"If you go to a school with a strong accredited accounting program, then I would say you don't need the masters. My perspective on it is that its a great consolidated way to wrap up your CPA required education. There are some co-workers of mine that went the masters route, but most just get the CPA hours outside of a masters program and dive into public accounting just fine. I honestly don't see any noticeable advantage from either route, except for resume padding. Firms care more about the CPA than the route you take to get it. As for your other questions, definitely join a firm prior to taking the exam, they will typically pay for the prep classes and the exam. And yes you can get recruited outside of schools, however most recruiting events happen within universities. Reach out to recruiters for information."

Free lunch everyday, partners take me out to client facing engagements, senior managers have invited me over to their houses, all the intern events are fun and full of free booze and food, everyone is super nice to me, and I get paid more per hour than just about everyone in the office. This is in contrast to the TC1s and TC2s that stay until around 6-7pm despite it being ""slow season."" I'm a full year away from graduating and will most likely be offered another internship for next summer so I can be pampered once again.  So I guess what I'm trying to say is that the recruiting process is awesome and there is absolutely no hurry to rush into working your life away. Enjoy your youth and consider staying as long as you can in school. This is assuming your grad. program is affordable. What is and isn't affordable depends on your financial situation.  If I were you and I could afford it, I would enroll and push really hard this fall to network and land myself an internship for next summer.

The amount of hours to get a high rating is likely close to 200+ hours the course of a year, not counting extra outside time. (socials you didnt want to go to, making sure you are doing XYZ, looking for more work, doing other people's work, etc).   You probably get like $5/hr in terms of a time to money perspective.  You also don't need to be highly rates to be promoted - you just need to get good performance reviews.  I've never heard that it's worth being highly rated. In fact, everyone that was highly rated told me it wasn't worth trying to do. They got a few extra bucks, a few high fives, and they still aren't dating anyone because they don't have time."

Accounting,3dgnck,Kaldazar24,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:35:06 2015 UTC,"Depends on which year you're in. Generally freshmen/sophomores go for SLPs and juniors/seniors go for internships.

Other B4/firms should have a page like this too."

It seems more likely the performance/behavior that resulted in the low rating is common knowledge, resulting in less client work as there are better options in the office to schedule.  edit for a little bit of advice/optimism(?): if you want to stay there and/or potentially have someone refer you for a new position then you should work on the performance issues directly, ask each person you report to if you're doing better and what can be improved on further, and generally try to have a positive attitude."
Accounting,3dezjk,JoeClarksville,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:05:58 2015 UTC,"No need to apologize. I can't speak for everyone in my firm, but I have definitely heard my senior manager talk nonchalantly about what rating they intend to give another staff even though I as a staff have nothing to do with the review process. I have also heard people talk openly about the fact that someone is on PIP. As far as whether the problem is my behavior and not the review, this very well may be the case, which is why I am not making the case that I didn't deserve the bad review. I think you are on point in saying that I messed up and I need to turn it around if I have any hope of staying."
Accounting,3dezjk,sound311system,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:11:23 2015 UTC,You can look for another job without actually quitting. I get what you're saying about continuity; I actually don't think you have to jump ship as soon as you get a bad review but it's always a good idea to have a backup plan so that in the event that you (God forbid) actually do get fired you're not scrambling to update your resume and get your CPA hours signed off or all of the other things that people who get got completely off-guard start worrying themselves over unnecessarily.
Accounting,3dezjk,rasdfaskdfajsdf98,2,Wed Jul 15 21:58:30 2015 UTC,"You can look for another job while working definitely, you never know whats out there. I'm just saying from what I've seen, PIP is just an extended way to push someone out. Additionally, working at one of the firms is stressful enough without the added worry/stress of this thing looming over your head. You're so early on in your career, if you jumped ship and went over to another Big 4 and hung out for a few years...no one will care and you'll get some weight off your shoulders. After leaving public, I can't believe all the stress I let get to me while I was working there. Life is too short.   Edit: From what I've witnessed, once you're actually on a PIP...getting off of it is almost more driven by politics rather than performance. You will work hard and maybe get an average review but if you don't somehow genuinely befriend or schmooze with those who control your destiny...it may not end well."

I have never heard of that. What was your feedback like?  Also your managers were definitely aware of this waaaay before now. They provided feedback to you as second level reviewers didn't they? And when a PIP is started feedback is gathered from the teams you work on too.  I wouldn't worry too much about being UNA during the summer, it's not entirely rare."
Accounting,3dezjk,zeevenkman,2,Wed Jul 15 20:30:15 2015 UTC,"The engagement I am working right now did not factor into my review as I was not working on it a month ago when the ""review year"" ended, but yes, my managers literally told me to take time to study for the CPA instead of looking for work to do.  The funny thing is, all of the teams I had worked on during the year gave me average ratings on the actual engagement reviews, but ultimately the review committee decided that ""although [my] reviews showed evidence of significant progression, my performance was not consistent throughout the review period.""   On a side note, I feel my actual rating may have been heavily influenced by a senior manager that I was told in no uncertain terms resents the fact that I was given an average rating on his engagement and thought it should be lower."
Accounting,3dezjk,sound311system,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:29:27 2015 UTC,"Your current engagement team is telling you to go home or was it one of the average reviews?  Were your ratings in line with the actual feedback? I know sometimes teams give a ""low 3"" instead of a 4 (if 1 is the best and 5 is the worst) by giving written feedback instead of reflecting it directly in the rating. Was it one major review that came out negative while the others were normal? It sounds like the senior manager wanted to give you a 4 instead of a low 3 and may have been over-ruled.   It's not the end of the world, but if you're not getting work and even when you're assigned you're being told to go home that's not good. I've never heard of anyone getting told to go home on a consistent basis (except for one kid who had a mental breakdown and ended up on a leave of absence for a couple months...)."

My written feedback definitely noted some issues but my career counselor was genuinely surprised that it translated to a below average rating. Yes you are exactly correct about the situation with the senior manager being overruled. I was told first hand from other people on the team that this is what happened."
Accounting,3dezjk,zeevenkman,2,Thu Jul 16 16:37:05 2015 UTC,"Well one and the same on the go home/stay home thing - but there's a further question there, did the rest of the team seem busy or was it really just slow? That helps define the situation a little more too."
Accounting,3dezjk,maerabug,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:56:33 2015 UTC,"When I rolled onto the engagement I asked the staff that I would be replacing about the kind of work he had been assigned during his last few weeks there. He told me that he had spent more time picking up lunch for the team than he had spent on any actual audit work, and he was serious. I am not ruling out the possibility that it is a coincidence and I am reading too much into it, but I have never seen an engagement anything like this."

If you are top rated at your current firm, you can be top rated at another firm too and will do well. The firm growing, in my opinion there is little value, career-wise for you unless there is a specific industry you're looking to get into. B4 is B4 regardless of growth, firms 6-10 will never be Big4 unless there are some huge mergers--if its firm status you are considering. Plus, a growing firm means more work for you as they struggle to find staff in a shrinking pool of accountants. Also, people tend to get raises when they move to another firm.

Maybe it's true that your college profs were biased and that hurt your performance, but recruiters aren't going to want to hear it because it will sound like a lame excuse. You're not always going to agree with your boss's every thought or belief in college or out of college and it doesn't bode well if your performance drops because of stuff like that.   I would take a few minutes instead to assess your performance; are these four bad grades a one-off or is it part of a bigger problem you have grades wise?

What salary should I expect as an experienced associate in tax in NYC?

Accounting,3dewez,Jfrenchy,2,Wed Jul 15 20:59:32 2015 UTC,"KPMG released a ELI5 on this.   I think there is a lot more nuance than what is presented in the notices. For example 2015-47 specifically states that not only does the investor have to have the right to request changes to the basket but has to have actually done so, no such language is in 2015-48, so it casts a much wider net. In addition, 2015-47 is very specific in what is included, going so far as to define substantially similar. Again, no such language in 2015-48.   An unintended consequence of very literal reading of this could be that a option on an index, like the S&P 500, could arguable be brought into 2015-48, although in a NYCPA conference the service was fairly clear that it was not intended. Clearly the option references multiple securities, and clearly there is rebalancing of those, and it can be argued that the rebalancing is done by an agent of the holder, without a clear 'substantially similiar' definition, that could be argued that it would be included.

There have only ever been ~45,000 people that have held the CMA designation globally. Currently, there are ~660,000 active CPAs in the United States alone."
Accounting,3ddglr,Tamerlee,3,Wed Jul 15 13:49:14 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize how low that CMA number is, oh boy"
Accounting,3ddglr,alzer9,4,Wed Jul 15 13:55:51 2015 UTC,"Which, unfortunately makes it a self-reinforcing trend - you have fewer people representing and paying dues to the licensing body, which is in turn is less able to promote their certification."
Accounting,3ddglr,JoeClarksville,5,Wed Jul 15 14:10:10 2015 UTC,"The CPA is a license though while the CMA is ""only"" a certification. It likely has more prestige because it is conferred by a governmental body rather than a private certification group.  (This is a shaky analogy, but it's like the difference between a driver's license and, say, a student access card from a private college. It's hard to find a place in the U.S. that does not consider a driver's license to be a valid ID, but it's hit and miss if they will take a student access card even if it also has your picture).  CPA confers certain professional standings -- they are the only ones who can sign audit opinions and they are among the specific classes of professionals who can practice before the IRS. So there are at least some jobs where a CPA is not just required by the employer but required by law; there are no jobs where you have to be a CMA, which also helps weaken its cachet. There's still a lot of value in a CMA but the fact that the CPA is backed by state and federal law and the CMA isn't is a big one."
Accounting,3ddglr,Bezit,2,Wed Jul 15 14:23:46 2015 UTC,"That 660,000 number seems super high. You're telling me 1 out of 600 Americans is a CPA? I guess that's not too high of a number."
Accounting,3ddglr,Tamerlee,4,Wed Jul 15 18:09:06 2015 UTC,"I was reading up on that. I think what I would do is get the CPA first then the CMA. Can't hurt, right?"

Accounting,3ddglr,JefemanG,5,Wed Jul 15 13:55:02 2015 UTC,"I am currently a cost accountant and a CPA.  I've never officially used my CPA a day in my life.  From here my progression would be to say a plant controller position or in a smaller mfg company a general accounting manager position that still had strong focus on manufacturing process.  In general you'd be in good position to move up in any manufacturing company because you'll be deeply involved in likely their second largest P&L item (COGS) and one of the larger B/S items (inventory).  You'll understand the nuts of bolts of the business that a pure G/L accountant may not.  As others have said, a CPA is not per se required, but is very helpful.  #1 is signaling.  It tells your bosses you can figure out the basics of pension accounting for CPA exam, you can probably figure out their convoluted Overhead model.  #2 You will touch on areas of financial accounting.  As I said above, inventory is a big thing, is it properly valued from a financial statement perspective.  You're in a plant, so you will deal with recognition and valuation of fixed assets.  And #3, not to be understated you can speak auditor.  Most auditors took a semester of cost accounting 2-3 years ago and remember a couple vocab words.  You will be able to translate their strange requests to your non-CPA co-workers.  Trust me, it happens."

Abolishing permanent non-dom is a big step which will take some time to digest, change in taxation to 19% has loads of group follow on impacts and residency, the world wide debt cap will always be an issue as will transfer pricing.  On top of that they've changed the way Performance Fee's will be taxed which is more than serious for a large part of the country.   If we go either further to impacts from Europe, Luxembourg has a new Limited Partnership (SCSp) which managers and tax evaders will seriously need to consider a restructure and the new ELTIF regulation. ELTIF isn't specifically tax but the combination of ELTIF + Retail Investors will double the tax queries on the inbound and W8's filling in wrong my various Grannies around Europe.  To move onto speculating, the upper tax rate of 50% is a hot topic and the move to 45%. Increase in tax boundaries in current budget might for Personal Allowance and additional tax boundaries are unlikely to nullify the call for 45% rate.

Checklists that you can actually check off using a touch screen display, and mark up documents you snapped pictures of above on the screen. A software that is intelligent enough to take an Excel file that hasn't been pre-cleaned up and turn it into something usable, i.e. converting an Excel file of the trial balance into an easily uploaded file into the audit software (I had too many clients that took a whole day to make the trial balance in the right format to upload)."

Accounting,3dec0t,rasdfaskdfajsdf98,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:04:23 2015 UTC,"I took a forensic accounting class in my undergrad. The teacher was also the founder of his forensic accounting practice. There is two sides to fraud detection: quantitative and qualitative. The quantitative side is called forensic analytics, basically using software to analyze the financial data. This method is only useful if the books aren't being cooked or the fraud is being committed by a lower level employee. If the fraud is being committed by high level management/owners then analytic detection will most likely be worthless. That's where qualitative research comes into play. With that method you have to use your Sherlock Holmes skills to detect fraud. For example, just think of a fraud where the owner of a burrito shop is under reporting cash sales. How would you detect that? Forensic analytics might provide a little bit of clues if the owner isn't smart with accounting. However, what if they are smart with accounting? Forensic analytics will be worthless. In that case you might have to research utility bills, perform direct observation etc.  The teacher had one case like that, the owner of a popular mexican food place was being investigated for underreporting sales. Turns out the owner was indeed underreporting cash sales and he was able to do it by buying supplies with cash from wholesalers and by creating an extra water/electricity line to his building. The purpose of the water/electricity line was to reduce the electricity bill/water bills. He knew that investigators would check the utility bills and if they saw that the bills were increasing while sales were not then it would be a red flag. The only reason he got caught was because the landlord told investigators that one of the nearby units had new plumbing installed and the investigators were able to connect the dots.  Going forward, the usefulness of forensic analytics will be diminished as frauds get more sophisticated. All the smart criminals know that investigators are going to be looking at financial data to detect frauds."

Yeah and the professional judgement often gets overlooked by computers. Many people fail to realize that technology enhances the work a professional can perform, it does not replace the professional. Computers simply perform the brainless functions of accounting which gives more opportunity to the accountant to perform higher level work. So in essence,  the work that gets automated by a computer gets replaced with higher level work."

I just got out of school with my B.S in accounting (only 120 credits) and decided not to pursue my CPA because I was tired of school and just wanted some real world experience so I could decide whether the CPA was worth pursuing later on or not.. So now I work as a temp at a large global company doing AP Processing within the live testing of their new ERP system... I'm concerned about my prospects afterwards and whether or not to stick with accounting or go towards a more IT-type career.  Where are you at with your schooling?

What's our office going to do, fire him and tank the entire audit?  Being a reliable worker so that people trust you'll still get your work done only goes so far. There will always be idiot superiors who take a hardline against vacation during busy season, and it's best to beat them by reserving the time in advance and forcing them to play on your terms."

Your managers and seniors might be able to get you an area of responsibilty that will work around the schedule.

I definitely sometimes feel like I can't handle it - but not in the stressful or hours sense - my office really isn't that bad.

TAS doesn't pay a helluva a lot better (it's higher but it's not like consulting pay), but the work is more interesting and doesn't pigeon-hole you as much. I think you'll be fine if you start looking after hitting the 2 year mark. As the others have said, it's not too late to be pigeon-holed and it's not too soon to seem like you couldn't hack it.  In the interim, have you considered asking a transfer to another city? I totally am with you on the accounting pay really sucks in major cities. I worked in one of the T5 most expensive cities in the US and it was absolutely asinine how horrendous the cost of living adjustment is. My friends in southern cities, where the prices are legitimately 2/3 that of that city are only getting paid 4k or so less than I was, and still had the nerve to complain about their pay. What a joke.   I recently reached out to other B4 firms and now, I'm in a smaller city making AS MUCH as I was in the old, T5 most expensive metro I was living in, work slightly less hours/more flexibility, and have MUCH better working relations with my peers compared to the mega office I was previously at. Maybe my situation is unique and I got lucky, but my opinion is that smaller offices have many of the B4 benefits without as many of the drawbacks. It could be an option if nothing tickles your fancy jobs-wise and you need to get out of SF"
Accounting,3d9vdl,hoverbikes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:31:26 2015 UTC,"Yup, another city has certainly been a consideration.

It's kind of depressing....  My girlfriend is here and I'm not sure if her job skills let her move nearly as much. We have talked about moving because we would like to have a yard....  SF is honestly one of the main reasons I've been considering a coding camp - that and their pretty great job placement statistics / salary averages. However, I am not entirely sure If I want to jump ship and dive into more education. That's a pretty big commitment.

Like what if trial by combat was an acceptable retort to a court briefing. Tax payers, from what I see, leave a lot of money on the table, and the complications and loopholes only apply to those making $90k plus. So it's not really like you need a CPA to pay your taxes, you need one to get out of them.  So who would simplifying the system benefit? Not the government, because they'd collect less. Not the rich, cause they'd pay more (in theory, less loopholes). Not the accountants, and not the lawmakers. A 'simple' system effectively removes incentivizing behavior, such as home ownership, moving for a work, paying off student loans... etc. A simple tax system is akin to anarchy.

Where do you think the tax burden goes...? Away? Who do you think most government services funded by taxes benefit?  Don't know if you've thought this one through...

We all know that we do more than taxes, but taxes are a big thing.  I think it would be awesome if we had to do less tax work.  I also think it would be awesome if we had to do less audit work.  The regulations that are currently in place are the epitome of the broken window fallacy.  Setting up laws that make work may keep people employed, but it doesn't increase productivity.  In fact, I'd say that crap like a complex tax code and SOX hurt the industry because accountants don't have to innovate.  The mandated business rolls in without any effort, and it's killing us.

Accounting,3d8g80,o8008o,2,Tue Jul 14 13:35:40 2015 UTC,I'd imagine you'd have states increasing their income taxation significantly to pay for items once provided for by the federal government and whatnot and it would then be suddenly obvious why we need federal income taxation.

Accounting,3d9bk8,thatkindofparty,3,Tue Jul 14 14:45:23 2015 UTC,"I have never worked in actg/finance in PDX, but I am originally from the area, so I may be of some use for your questions.   I don't have exact numbers. From my experience, however, Portland is kind of shitty for pay relative to CoL. The west coast is generally an expensive place because of the mild climate/natural beauty and PDX is considered the cheapest of the major western cities. As such, it's a bit of a double whammy where companies pay you less relative to how much rent, etc. truly is. I don't know what managers, etc. make, but based on what my friends at F500 companies are making out of school, it's somewhere north of 60k (which is solid for a first job) and for public it's around 52k (not so great). Perhaps someone can add more or you can try to extrapolate from there for manager level pay. Otherwise, I'd check glassdoor.com. PDX is still cheap enough that if you're making close to 100k, you should live comfortably in the suburbs, especially if your company still has upward mobility from there. Honestly, there aren't a ton of jobs in PDX, which is why I left. The big companies with significant presence there are Nike, Intel, Precision Castparts. There are a lot of other random manufacturing/forest related product companies like Schnitzer Steel, Blount International, etc. If you can get a position at one of the big 3 I mentioned, PDX is a solid place to live. There is a burgeoning tech scene there, so if you like startups, it could be an OK place. That said, it's still in it's infancy and whether or not any of them can really gain much traction remains to be seen.  In case anybody cares about Public Accounting there or for future searches, as far as firms go, KPMG is usually tops since they have most of the tech companies and have the most audit revenue from what I've seen (no, I don't work for KPMG and am not trying to boost a non-""Big3"" firm, but am simply stating facts that KPMG does great in this city). PwC is usually second choice and they snake some people because they have Nike as well as a few other big companies. Deloitte is third by a narrow margin and they have some big utilities as well as Precision Castparts/Columbia Sportswear. EY is actually smaller than some of the 2nd tier firms because they are late coming into the marketplace among other factors. This is based on my research there when I was considering it as a destination. PDX has a very ""unique"" culture. I think that if you make an effort and can take up some of those activities that are popular there, particularly anything outdoors-related, I think you'll be fine. I've seen people originally from the south fit in just fine there because they enjoyed the super liberalness of the city. If you're a hardcore conservative, I'd strongly caution against it because the culture of the place absolutely does not take kindly to republicans, which is unfortunate. You can still live there, but be prepared to stay silent or not voice too much dissent to the politics there as I had to when I was there.   Hope that helps a little bit. If you have more questions about lifestyle, etc., feel free to PM me or just respond to this post. I might be of more use in that arena."
Accounting,3d9bk8,wannabetechexec,2,Tue Jul 14 15:24:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks, very useful.  I would honestly say that pulling $60K right out of college is pretty damn good, so here's hoping that managers make a little more than that.    As for culture, I consider myself a fairly liberal guy, but I think I have a limit.  I'm not planning on living on a beet farm or making my own clothes.  And I probably look down a little harshly on people that shop at Whole Foods exclusively."
Accounting,3d9bk8,wannabetechexec,2,Tue Jul 14 16:09:03 2015 UTC,"I think you'll be fine then. PDX isn't somewhere like the south where people will casually make conversation with you. That said, if you make the effort, especially at work, or by joining activities, I think it's easy to meet people.  As for the salary, I'd say that if you make around 90k+ as a manager, you'll be fine and should be able to raise a family in a solid suburb like Beaverton as long as you're not a lavish spender."
Accounting,3d9bk8,Vlakmir786,2,Tue Jul 14 18:05:08 2015 UTC,public it's around 52k (not so great).   man....SF is like 58k starting now.

Accounting,3d9bk8,wannabetechexec,2,Tue Jul 14 19:46:48 2015 UTC,"52k is just okay for PDX, but hell yeah it's way better than <60k anywhere in California lol.

Accounting,3d9bk8,deathoreldona,3,Tue Jul 14 20:22:38 2015 UTC,"Hello.  I'm an accountant who lives and works in Portland, OR.  I got a job in the field before I even finished school in 2013.  The industry seems like it's always in need.  I think an experience professional with a CPA such as yourself won't have much of an issue finding a job here making between 60 - 80k if not more depending on where you land. I'm in manufacturing myself, but from what I can tell, there is no one industry that seems more prevalent than another.  I haven't done any kind of research though.  Just going off what I've seen from other folks I went through school with. I think it would be harder to get an interview if you weren't in the vicinity, but other than that, it should be a pretty even playing field.  I've never heard of Portland being associated with the word ""insular"".  I've seen and heard the exact opposite of that though.  People like ""different"" here.    That all being said, Portland is a great city, growing very very fast. If you are coming, don't dawdle.  Rent and real estate are only going up in price with no sign of leveling. Take a look at r/Portland as well.  As long as you aren't from California you might get some good advice there."
Accounting,3d9bk8,deathoreldona,2,Tue Jul 14 16:04:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I think the biggest thing I'm worried about is that it's like Austin, in that there's so much competition for jobs that employers can pay $10-$15K below what is being offered in other markets, but that doesn't seem to be the case.  And by insular, I guess I meant in the sense that y'all don't like Californians, lol.  So, same as Texas.    Edit: I'm from Austin/Central Texas, and live in Houston now, and it feels like anytime I meet someone from Austin (usually by way of Cali), they won't shut up about how great Austin is and what a cultural barbarian I am for living in Houston.  Is Portland the same way?  I guess that would be my other concern--the smug factor."
Accounting,3d9bk8,DrizzyDrake_3,3,Tue Jul 14 20:08:21 2015 UTC,"You are probably going to find a certain kind of smugness wherever you end up going, but I have found that attitude rests mostly within the native population.  The nice thing about this city (probably most cities) is that there are enough transplants to alleviate that kind of feeling for the most part. The California thing is, I feel, relatively recent (maybe in last 2-5 years) and is mostly due to the new Oregon Trail along the I-5 corridor.  Californian's arriving by SUV load raising housing costs along the way.  I can't tell you for certain how accurate that is, but I can say that it is a general feeling among many people living in Portland looking for an affordable place to call home."

If it helps you, our small firm trained an ACA from A levels, he went as an experienced hire to PWC for 4 years then exited as any other big 4 trained would into industry.

Since your degree was Business Administration with an emphasis on Marketing I don't see it being an issue as long as you got all the required units and specific classes done. Here in CA you need X units in accounting, X in business law, X in ethics, X in business etc. etc. I would check with PA/NJ to see what each state accounting board requires and then just make sure you have all those classes!  Good luck - I wanted to be a marketing major as well but quickly found out how hard it was to get a legit job out of college compared to Accounting where it was almost a guarantee."

Accounting,3datdu,duckbrah,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:28:29 2015 UTC,"ial in some wa   The finance double major will get you nowhere, especially if you plan on starting with an accounting firm. Every other guy at most large schools has a finance double major and taking those classes would mean a pretty hefty workload if you're also taking upper level accounting. If your GPA doesn't improve by next year, I would rethink majors just to save your parents some money in having to pay for multiple retakes and stuff, unless you're taking out loans and don't mind paying off more. Have you even taken any accounting courses yet? If you take intro to financial accounting and find it difficult, intermediate will be 3-4 times the workload of that class in the same period of time.   edit: I read below where someone calculated your max GPA with straight As from here on out. My recommendation to you is to transfer to another school where they wipe your slate clean (something I did), and start fresh GPA wise while still keeping the credits you earned. I also suggest thinking about taking a year off to think about your life and mature a year. The reasoning behind this is that you're not going to change from a 2.3 freshman student to a mature 19 year old 3.5 student in one summer."

If you go to a ""unknown"" school, it's best to get your CPA out of the way and keep your GPA high. Having experience in bookkeeping already will be a huge boost.  Edit: I think QB is SUPER easy - chances are you will be making deposits, writing checks, receiving payments, reconciling bank, credit cards and loan accounts. This stuff isn't hard but it is a bit time consuming which is where the need for bookkeeping comes into play."

Accounting,3d9t1u,JoeClarksville,2,Tue Jul 14 22:32:09 2015 UTC,Check the experience requirements. It's hard to get a feel for 'normal' for bookkeeping because it's so experience based; an experienced bookkeeper with a lot of knowledge of accounting information systems can pull down a lot. Someone with no experience and just academic knowledge of accounting and bookkeeping may be able to luck into a high paying position but for the most part they are just looking for experience. Jobs like that can be pretty competitive solely because companies are usually shy about taking a risk on an inexperienced bookkeeper creating more work for them. It's definitely worth checking out the positions you see on Indeed but also look into some temp agencies for placements if those don't work out.

Either the loans go through and Euros start flowing, or they pull the plug and start printing drachmas.  It's hard to seem them keeping the status quo for more than 2 weeks, but there are no guarantees.  So from a credit and collections perspective, I think your best bet is to just sit and wait.  This is beyond your customer's control.  Sending them harassing e-mails or cutting off subscriptions won't get you paid any faster.  But also you want to look forward beyond the immediate concern, if Greece does go to drachma will your customers still be credit worthy?

Accounting,3da7zc,Kitchner,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:54:57 2015 UTC,"As an internal auditor if I was asked to look at this I'd look at it from a risk point of view asking these questions:  How many customers are effected?  What is the total amount of the Greek customers?  What is the income of the company? What percentage of all income are these Greek customers?  How well does the business know these customers? Do we trust they can pay or come to an alternative arrangement?  How important do management feel maintaining the relationship with these customers is?  How is this issue being monitored? Who is keeping an eye on account balances, and which managers are receiving reports on them?  Has management identified a point where the customer's accounts will be suspended until they pay? How do you make sure this will happen?  Does the company have insurance against AR balances?  If these customers make a small percentage of your overall income it's basically a tolerable risk. Management need to identify the balance amount at which they can no longer tolerate the risk and if that point is hit no more products or services are provided until the balance is cleared.   There should be clear instructions that the customer is not entitled to order any new products or services beyond your existing arrangements.   If the amount is material, management should also be investigating alternative payment methods beyond cash.   You should also be trying to figure out what happens if Greece is kicked out of the eurozone. Would the company retain their cash as euros (which is good) or would their cash become a new currency (which is bad). They may not know but what assurances can they provide that the euros will be there to pay with?   Ultimately this is a risk management issue. The important thing is the risk has been assessed,  management have been informed, and they have decided how much risk they will tolerate before pulling the plug."

On top of that I'm in my busy season until early August so I can really only get good quality studying done on the weekends, but I still believe it's feasible so you should be just fine. Before you start looking at module 0 really take a look at the competency map and the knowledge supplement to the competency map ( the knowledge supplement basically gives examples of technical knowledge you should know for each competency). Consider what you truly believe you don't feel comfortable with given the rating of importance of that topic on the competency map for core 1, then focus most of your attention on those topics. Also, for Core 1 I really reccomend the densmore competency map study notes. If you purchase it it comes with 2 big books with tons of good info and concise notes based on what is deemed to be important with regards to the competency map, so you can use it to study for all 4 exams. Its not as expensive as the study course offered by them either, so its a good cost effective option for you.

Accounting,3d9ptr,Abig4intern,4,Tue Jul 14 16:28:29 2015 UTC,You should use the time to get CPA exams out of the way. They aren't a breeze and are much easier to complete compared to having to work and study.

Accounting,3d9ptr,its-an-accrual-world,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:51:59 2015 UTC,You shouldn't have to repay your loans for the first 6 months after you graduate (unless you have non-federal student loans). Obviously you will still be accruing interest though.

It probably wouldn't look great if it got around to the firm you accepted an offer from heard you were interning elsewhere and the firm(s) you apply to are unlikely to take you anyway once they hear that you've already accepted a FT position.  Since you need a job, maybe look for something temporary that you can leverage your accounting background to make a little more like working as a teller at a bank."

You'll work during the days and have free time during the evenings and weekends. Your coworkers will want to hit the bar/pub after work some nights for happy hours, so you can socialize with them then.

The DC area is served by the Mclean offices.  Use linkedin, and apply on the big 4 websites.    I personally wouldnt move to DC.  The cost of living isnt worth what you get for it.  If you work big 4, you are likely in Mclean meaning that you wont live in DC unless you want a 60 min commute on a good day, even with the silver line."

Accounting,3d8txq,I3lackcell,2,Tue Jul 14 13:24:02 2015 UTC,"The issue with the DC area is that you can live far outside the city and only see minor decreases in rent.  Mclean is 10 miles outside DC, yet you still pay $1500 for a 1br in a shitty apartment, or $2200 in some new ones they just put up.  You can live in Chicago for MUCH cheaper, and I prefer that city a lot more.  It wouldnt be a huge deal if you paid a huge amount of rent to live and work in DC, but that isnt the case.  You are basically paying a ton to live close to DC and maybe visit on weekends."
Accounting,3d8txq,mclean_throwaway,2,Tue Jul 14 13:40:29 2015 UTC,"I currently live in DC and am looking to transfer offices after being here for only a year. I echo what Blackcell is saying basically. DC has a lot of good aspects going for it, such as the free museums, culture, etc., but the traffic and overall cost of living significantly diminish these benefits IMO, especially on a B4 salary.   McLean isn't significantly cheaper than DC in terms of rent, etc. and the worst part is that if you want to commute into DC for the weekend, you'll either have to sit in traffic and pay sky high parking fees once you're in downtown, or you'll have to rely on the metro which is not only stupid expensive, but is extremely slow and unreliable. For how much love the metro gets for being extensive, which to be fair it is, people neglect to mention how they either screw you over on price during the ""peak hours"" or how you sometimes may have to wait 20+ minutes for a train on the weekend because of never ending ""construction"". And the traffic, don't even get me started on how packed I-395 or I-66 are at all times of the day it seems lol.  If you want a big city, I think that Chicago, Houston, Dallas, or Philly are the best bang for your buck on a non-manager level accountant's salary. Aside from maybe developing a skill-set with NFPs/government clients, I don't think DC has either the exit opps that even more expensive places like NYC/SF have nor the overall QoL factor that smaller B4 offices have. Personally, I'm looking to transfer to a smaller office because, based on my discussions with friends in those offices, they work slightly less hours and those offices are more focused on developing people as opposed to megaoffices like DC that are pretty much a revolving door all year with long hours to boot."
Accounting,3d8txq,sylvir,3,Tue Jul 14 14:40:21 2015 UTC,"I worked almost 3 years in the Metro DC area, transferred out, and have never regretted a day.  The height of my current traffic consists of a 10 minute increase in time to get home.  Also, my experience is that DC is too expensive to attract inbound investment and the industry (healthcare, govcon, etc) isn't rich in outbound operations.  But then again, I wasn't in a Big 4.  I had to transfer south to join my firm's international tax practice."
Accounting,3d8txq,I3lackcell,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:40:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your perspective, I'll probably expand my search to include Philly and Chicago.

You just need to take a sick day or vacation at your current job."
Accounting,3d8txq,wannabetechexec,2,Tue Jul 14 15:19:03 2015 UTC,"Based on my experiences, sometimes the B4 firms are so desperate for staff that they might not even require an in-person or will instead have you interview with a partner at the office local to your area. This especially true at the associate level since you're not really ""the face"" of the firm like you are as an experienced senior/manager (this is a direct quote from multiple recruiters).  I'm fairly low on the totem pole and wanted to change coasts. My interview process only consisted of 2 phone interviews and 1 very casual in-person interview with a partner in the area to make sure that I could interact with people live without doing anything stupid.   I wouldn't let distance hold you back from applying elsewhere. If they want you bad enough, they'll find a way to make it work/fit your schedule."

Active duty military get BAH (housing allowance) which is indexed to housing prices in the zip code.  So yes they don't have to worry about housing prices.  GS employees do get a COL adjustment but its not nearly enough to make up for the housing prices in large cities.  For example a GS-7 will bring home 39K in Podunkville, Kansas.  A GS-7 in DC takes home 43K, a 4000 dollar adjustment.  Price of 2 bed apt in podunkville is 700 dollars.  In DC that same apartment is 2000 easily.  Not to mention the other stuff like parking, ridiculous food prices, insane taxes.  The only reprieve you may get as a GS employee for housing is getting into base housing, but you will still be paying rent at a slightly subsidized price."

If it's a museum, they could display it and keep it on the books as an asset.   If the organization intends to sell it, they would recognize the selling price as income, then recognize an expense at an appraised or estimate value.

Any other type of industry is much better for opening other doors once you leave. It's why when you're a fund accountant you get fund accounting job offers and if you're not you really don't.

My audit experience was mega complexes (on the scale of Goldman, JPM, etc.). But the in-house people do ""shadow accounting"" to be another check on the admin. They also handle complex presentation and disclosure issues. At some small shops, they may have a hand in investor relations or general ops (but I imagine this is less common).  I ended up jumping internally at my Big 4 to TS, but I did interview for half a dozen in-house fund accountant jobs in the hedge space. People were very up front that (at least in NYC) you need to be prepared to jump funds every few years to rise through the ranks to CFO, etc. They seemed like decent jobs, but I decided the fund accounting world wasn't where I wanted to be long-term."

Each day I must reconcile the trades for the day and pretty much any other activity that would affect the price - such as income or fees.   I am also responsible for preparing year end financials for the funds which is probably what you are currently auditing. Half of my day is spent working to reconcile my funds. The other half is working on projects or helping clients with questions about how the accounting works for their investments. (I work for a stable value manager so there are a few more accounting/reporting requirements).  If you don't mind ""redundancy"" a little you won't mind it.

Most of them are in the hundreds of millions range, with some smaller venture capital funds thrown in when I have capacity.  A lot of your questions I'm able to answer from personal experience working with clients and former coworkers who went private.  I'm curious if you're looking for additional input beyond what you've already observed, or if you have no baseline?  I would expect that after three years you have a rough idea of what fund accountants do.  To answer your questions:  -My coworkers who left at the senior and above level seem to enjoy it.  They ended up as assistant controller level positions.  A coworker who jumped ship at the staff level seems sort of miserable, largely because advancement is more difficult and delayed.  -Actual work (not exhaustive): investor relations (if not covered by the admin), deal with auditors (some admins are terrible so we end up going to the fund for a lot of things), monthly/quarterly closes, review of NAV packages, review (possibly prep) of YE FS, daily cash and position recs, dealing with side pockets and investment activity, expenses, internal control related busy work.  -Pay is typically slightly higher at funds, but you do not have accelerated career progression, especially at already established funds.  You also get a sweet bonus if the fund does well.  You work around fifty hours a week, but the schedule is much more rigid.  You can't really take ad-hoc PTO days.  -As I mentioned above, progression is slower since you're going to be waiting to replace someone ahead of you most of the time.

I wrote a couple of essays on why I wanted to do audit and tax for that summer.  I spent 6 weeks in my main service line, then 2 weeks in my second service line.  I think that was pretty standard for everyone that did it.    My only advice would be to not be afraid to ask what you specifically want to rotate on. Because you could request an advisory rotation and be put on something within advisory you have no interest in."

I went ahead and did that, because I needed money so fucking badly. The only regret I have is not enjoying that summer more, since I have been working almost 100% full time since. Also - at my old firm we had 4 new hires linked to start in Oct and we brought two in early which gave them a bit of a headstart on the social part of the office and just getting used to working 9-5. If you don't need the money and you have some fun shit planned or that you want to do I would do it versus start working. If you do need the money or want to impress them then start earlier.

Accounting,3d6anf,TheNumberMuncher,2,Mon Jul 13 21:24:55 2015 UTC,To better answer the question...When you receive the inventory does the title transfer to you? More importantly what happens if the inventory doesn't sell? This sounds like a type of floor plan agreement but I'm not sure.  Basically if you can tell me what you do when you receive the goods it should be fairly simple to figure out what you do when you sell them.
Accounting,3d6anf,fustercluck1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:31:42 2015 UTC,"We receive them into inventory at zero cost.  The company we get them from has, at the point they send it to us, already written it all off as scrapped.  I don't know how they handle the payment from us on their end or what they call it. Anything that we do not sell, we can scrap at any time.  I guess we could technically tell them we scrapped it all and would owe no payment. They are completely trusting us to accurately pay them based on what we sell.  But we do, so they don't have anything to worry about. I just have no idea how to treat this payment.     We have just started this arrangement this year so I'm not worried about past tax filings.  For first quarter, the payment was put against COGS but we can re-class it easily. I thought about immediately putting 45% of each sale into a liability account. I've been looking into it all day and have come across opinions that go both ways between COGS and an expense but I can't find anyone addressing a situation like this.  It's all either sales commission or consignment. Thanks for answering."
Accounting,3d6anf,fustercluck1,2,Mon Jul 13 23:39:24 2015 UTC,It would definately be sales commission then. You completely own the goods and the 'cosignor' already relinquished any claim to the inventory so it's not consignment.  So debit commission expense and credit a liability for money owed. You'll have to reclass from cogs because the cost of your inventory is 0 so you have no cost of goods sold.

Accounting,3d4bam,o8008o,3,Mon Jul 13 13:24:08 2015 UTC,"Truth. Had an 8th-year senior last year, most miserable person I've ever met. There are rumors of a senior in his 50s at one of our offices."
Accounting,3d4bam,No_Help_Accountant,6,Mon Jul 13 14:53:04 2015 UTC,"WHY?!? I can't even imagine. Move to a smaller firm or something...My firrm had 2-3 ""long-term"" seniors, and all of them were managed out."
Accounting,3d4bam,ctr2010,3,Mon Jul 13 16:13:20 2015 UTC,Oh I've seen people start as a staff with one senior and eclipse them to become their manager 5-6 years later.   That being said that is the exception not the norm.

Accounting,3d4bam,Threewalldream,-8,Tue Jul 14 01:34:46 2015 UTC,"TIL my partners handled it correctly. They laid off people by their start date, they laid off people who had started most recently. Only issue is we have a lot of managers now with not enough people to lead."
Accounting,3d4bam,BorinToReadIt,20,Mon Jul 13 13:55:24 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, why is this correct? Wouldn't it make sense to get rid of under-performers during this time?"
Accounting,3d4bam,poopadoopaloop,8,Mon Jul 13 14:34:42 2015 UTC,I believe he/she is under the older mindset of company loyalty.
Accounting,3d4bam,Threewalldream,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:49:16 2015 UTC,Well it's true. If you're a manager you're a whole hell a lot more likely to stay longer. It's not hard recruiting more associates and I received the highest salary in my city because of it.
Accounting,3d4bam,Gypsiee,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:56:05 2015 UTC,I don't think I agree that taking up space in an organization for a longer period of time makes someone more valuable.

Accounting,3d64ru,stolli93,3,Mon Jul 13 20:42:40 2015 UTC,"It all depends on what you want to do.  The general federal group will have the most exit ops, but you also have more people applying for them.  The work can get boring.  International is great if you want to go overseas, its usually more consulting based, but exit ops are only okay.  SALT is said to be international but in english and without the international opportunities.  SALT and international groups can vary by firm and location, since sometimes you will get dragged into compliance while in others you do 100% consulting work.  M&A can get you to travel around, but it can also be hard to break into since its the flashy thing that every college grad likes."
Accounting,3d64ru,I3lackcell,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:22:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. Depends on what you want to do as well as your location. For example here in SF, SALT and INTERNATIONAL are hot hot hot for jobs."
Accounting,3d64ru,SFGetWeird,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:52:43 2015 UTC,I'm hoping it stays that way in SF.  I am looking to come out there in about 2 1/2 years.

Accounting,3d64ru,chomu1,2,Tue Jul 14 00:39:46 2015 UTC,"Depends on your group and office. You could also be doing a fair amount of structuring. It also depends on the partners'/group's/office's mix of strategic vs. PE clients; you could have a mix of the 2 or weigh heavily on one or the other. If you have a ton of strategic clients and get staffed on long projects, you might not do any DD for 6+ months at a time.  Again, this all just depends on the office and group, so no, it's not just all DD unless you're specifically in an office that happens to be all DD."
Accounting,3d64ru,JD2013Tax,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:40:53 2015 UTC,Ive enjoyed when I worked on M&A projects.  I kind of like due diligence.

Accounting,3d64ru,boogpowell,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:14:28 2015 UTC,"Asset mgmt groups (RE, PE, hedge) have a lot of exit opps in NY at high salaries.  You will get a mix of federal, intl, SALT in these groups.   I agree with others that Fed also has good exit opps in NY.  However, I would think PE/hedge shops pay more."
Accounting,3d64ru,AMG_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:50:34 2015 UTC,"Long term and most broad exit opps, anything Federal, especially Partnernships and pass throughs so you can go to an AM firm later on. But it's pretty boring.   I wouldn't go into IT unless you've got your law degree. The CPAs are doing all the compliance. M&A is DD and the groups are very small."
Accounting,3d64ru,I3lackcell,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:55:41 2015 UTC,You do not need a law degree to do international or SALT. There is usually a mix in those groups and my experience has been that they dont care if you are a lawyer or CPA when handing out client assignments.

Accounting,3d64ru,JD2013Tax,2,Tue Jul 14 04:05:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. If you've got B4 provision work experience in NY/SF/LA or any major metro area with a lot of corps, you're not going to have a hard time at all finding a corp that will hire you."
