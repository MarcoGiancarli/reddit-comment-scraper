The Dota2 SFM FAQ states:   Will the Dota 2 SFM replace the standalone SFM?  No. The version of the SFM in Dota 2 will stay in Dota 2, alongside Hammer, the Particle Editor, and the other tools. There are currently no plans for it to ship as a new application, and it will not replace the existing standalone SFM application.   So the standalone SFM (the one most of us use) will not be upgraded to the Dota 2 version. Bad, huh? Well, I thought this means that TF2 will at some point be upgraded to Source 2 and that's how the standalone SFM will get all the sweet upgrades from the Dota 2 SFM.

If you felt like doing something similar again, you could perhaps make a red light coming from demoman's grenade.

SFM,3drsgm,SquidCubed,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:58:01 2015 UTC,Super late reply but - are you loading the copy provided in the TF2 files from the Gun Mettle update? That one uses a BSP packing method not recognizable by the engine version SFM uses and so you'll need to unpack it. This thread over at TF2maps.net goes over it in more detail (and also says how to decompress the map). Though your best bet is to download it from somewhere instead of ripping the one shipped with TF2.

SFM,3dqng1,Friendly_General,2,Sat Jul 18 21:59:20 2015 UTC,I don't know if SFM allows this but other tools (like Blender for example) allow you to overlay a reference image so you can match to it. If you overlay the various frames of a video you can match the action pretty easily.   Try recreating various types of characters using this method and eventually you should be able to learn to animate your characters without a reference and get the results you desire.

If it's not all straight, make sure the whole Timeline is selected (it should be by default all green) and move the timeline playhead to somewhere where the model scale is correct.  Then under the Procedural tab click and drag the 'Playhead' all the way to the right to make the scale match up the rest of the project."

Move the camera to an angle where the pyro is clearly the main point of the poster   Also zoom in on the pyro and pull the camera back. This will decrease the FoV, while keeping him in the frame.  Make the image brighter, you can tweak it to your own liking later in post processing.  If you want the particle effect to be more intense, copy and paste it a couple of times until you are satisfied.  Try using a rim light. The result may be marginally better.

SFM,3dl05p,foreskinfarter,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:14:17 2015 UTC,"EDIT: Sorry for the huge block of text, tl;dr is at the bottom.  Honestly though? This doesn't look nearly half as bad as some works I've seen that people used as actual paid comissions.   I can see what you were trying to do in this poster, and I don't think it deserves all the negativity and self-loathing you put onto yourself for it. Instead, you should ask for constructive criticism and advice to make your posters better rather than just beating yourself over the head. You can't make any progress that way.  So here's a couple things that I think could be better about this poster in specific, if you do decide to improve it:   The poses on the character models look pretty static. While you did convey the movements they were doing, they still look a bit plain and statue-like. Instead, try to over-exaggerate your poses. In a high action shot such as this one, characters should look like they're really in action with almost over-the-top poses that can help bring it to life. There's no harm in messing around with character's limbs to see what looks best. In fact, in one of my own favorite posters, I made the sniper's pose by complete accident and stuck with because it looked better than what I had in mind. For an example in this poster in specific, the spy could probably be mid-vault over the barrier with his legs just crossing the top of it to look more alive. Also, the scout could possibly be crouching down low looking over the side of the crate. Just remember, it's better to make your characters look more over the top and exaggerated than underwhelming and static. If you're having trouble with figuring out how a pose should look of if what you did looks too awkward in your shot, try re-inacting the pose in real life and pay atention to what you look like, or try grabbing some reference images off of google. For instance, the spy could look like he's jumping the fence like this (ignore how goofy he looks though) with the gun in his free hand pointed back at the cops. Mess around with the location, position, lens, and depth of field of the camera. With the current shot, it does a decent job of conveying the scene, since it shows both of the characters (and their actions) as well as looking over the background to show what's going on. Just never be afraid to experiment. Maybe the camera could look good looking a little bit to the right and adjusted accordingly to still fit the characters and background cars in the scene, rather than just a straight shot down the road. Also, adding DoF (depth of field) could help a little bit in this poster by slightly blurring out the background cars a bit to help the viewer direct their focus on the main characters in the shot. You've got some good lighting down in this shot, mostly around the spy. However, the lighting still looks a bit weird. A simple rule to always follow when applying light to characters is a technique called Three Point Lighting. It can be applied relatively easily to basically any foreground character in your shot and helps your characters pop out and look cool. When using lights, be sure to also mess with the color sliders a bit. No actual light in real life looks 100% white, so it looks a bit weird in SFM. Always try to decrease the colors a bit to compliment the character's colors (for example, a key light on a red spy might look good if it were a very light shade of red). Lastly, adding some volumetric lights can help add just a little bit more to your poster. To add a volumetric light, simply create a new light, right click on it, and select ""enable volumetrics"". What this will do is it will make the entire cone of light visible as opposed to just illuminating the surface (think of like how a desk lamp would look if there was a bunch of dust in the air with the light). You can use this to create a subtle misty or foggy effect to your overall poster if you place it over the entire shot and turn down the intensity and the volumetric_intensity to a comfortable level. Playing around with the color sliders is key for volumetrics, too. It may not help for every poster, but it certainly can help in many of them.   Sorry for the big wall of text, but that's as much advice as I can remember off the top of my head. If you'd like, you can PM me or add me on steam about anything you'd like to talk about if you need some help. It just seemed like you were too down and depressed about your work and I thought I'd like to help you out a bit.  Oh, and also check out these guides as well, they really helped me get started with making SFM posters:   SFM Tutorial #1: Making a Nice Poster SFM Tutorial #2: Cinematography (If you were to check out any of these, I'd recommend this one the most) How to make an unusual poster: an easy worded crash-course   Just always remember: Experiment with everything, and enjoy what you make! that sounded really cheesey sorry  TL;DR: Experiment with as much as you can, make your characters look exaggerated, mess with the camera settings to see what looks best, use three point lighting if you can, experiment with volumetrics and lighting colors. Oh, and don't get super-frusturated if your poster doesn't look the way you want it to. I have to give up on a lot of posters myself because I don't think they'll look any good. Just keep trying and you'll get it down in no time."

SFM,3di3pb,StallordD,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:28:18 2015 UTC,"I'd like to think that it's either a camera issue or my computer just simply can't properly render AO for me, however, I might find out in a couple of months upon getting some hardware upgrades. But if you have any ideas on how to counteract it yourself, I would love it if you could tell me."
SFM,3di3pb,StallordD,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:23:32 2015 UTC,"If you have a hard light on them, try changing the shadow filter size down a bit so the shadows are ""harder."" Additionally, messing with your AO strength, radius, and bias in the camera settings can help make the pools of black smaller and tighter, thus making it less grainy in the final render. It looks to me like your camera is set a bit too strong in terms of AO, so I'd bring it down a bit, especially with how bright the scene in general is."

SFM,3dhtor,flamablep,2,Thu Jul 16 11:44:06 2015 UTC,"This looks pretty good! I just have one or two things to say. Firstly, angling your letterboxes is a pretty interesting thing to do, but when done to too extreme of a degree, it can just make them look lopsided. This is also a static shot, so having a angled letterbox that would more so imply action than an Engie sitting in the cold doesn't really serve the scene. Secondly, I like the blue filter as an artistic choice, and I think it could definitely stay, but you should definitely tone it down a few notches. As it stands, your blue filter is swamping out your other colors and reducing the color contrast and quality of the poster.  Hope I could help a little, and beyond those two criticisms, this really is a fantastic piece.  (As a little sidenote here, and this is more a personal nitpick than a legitimate criticism, but your watermark is a bit too intense, and it can draw attention away from the poster. I suggest just using a translucent gray version overlayed over the actual image and not the letterbox.)"
SFM,3dhtor,SpeakNoBullshit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:23:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback!  Both or your criticisms are completely fair; subtleties aren't exactly a strong point for me. The letterboxing does make it feel a little too dynamic for slouching around.  As for the watermark, I'd intended to dial the opacity down a fair bit, but forgot to, as for the location, I agree that placing it in the shot would be a better choice.   Ta. :P"

For example, at 1:16, the guy raises his gun. But the upperarm bone is the only thing that moves. He looks like a robot. There is also no anticipation and fall off. At 1:19, is the hand to hand fight. It looks good, but is too slow. Other than that, the concept, choreography (needs better animation to really show it off), and particles were really good. If you cleaned this up I'd post this to /r/globaloffensive.  EDIT: Based off your youtube videos I'm going to assume you are a beginner (your oldest SFM video was 4 months ago). And to that I say huge props for finishing a project. I've been using SFM for about 1 and a half years and I finished a video with my own story or ideas. All I've done are posters and recreations.

There are some really talented SFM artists that use no post-process at all, Maxofs2d has done artwork without any work outside SFM, same as Valve. But doing a movie/animation is entirely different as to say a poster, where manipulating lights is far more easy for a poster, than in a movie, where you are moving it around to fit a moving camera in a moving environment.  I do get what you're saying, but you do not have to use photoshop when finished in SFM, as you can come up with something great in SFM that does not need any post process."

You say SFM posters are easier and don't need post-process. Give me the testimony of one professional photographer (or someone who works with rendering) who says that. You might think it's good enough, but it can always be improved in post."

I'm speaking of artwork, and what I've seen that has not been edited in a third party software, somtimes, those kinds of artwork looks fantastic. I speak from experience, I've used Photoshop for more than 5 years, I only use it to fix something I cannot either fix in SFM or do not have the time or energy to go back and do a re-render. ""You say SFM posters are easier and don't need post-process"", I never said so or even intended to say so. All I am saying is that, making something that is a still frame and does not require a camera to make it feel like a 3D-universe aka an animation, you do not have to fiddle around as much as you would've doing for an animation. Yet again, I speak from experience.   So TL;DR  You do not need to use a third party software like Photoshop to ""enhance"" your image, you can use SFM just well enough if you are good enough. Some prefer using photo editing software, I don't, you make it seem like it's obligatory, when it is not."

It's good to cover up mistakes or enhance a scene, but you should not rely on post-processing entirely. I'd recommend to others to, get a good look in SFM and enhance it in any photo editing software if wanted/needed. Sometimes you can make a poster look even worse with post-process."
SFM,3dhjw0,Maximal113,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:58:53 2015 UTC,"SFM does not even somewhat begin to offer the suite of tools available in Photoshop to enhance a poster. SFM's suite of tools in terms of color and contrast correction is almost entirely limited to filters, which, honestly, look quite bad, and are rigid and hard to tweak. Most in-engine effects you see done are completely jury-rigged, like a volumetric light for fog, or like using painted greenscreens to letterbox. Photoshop also has numerous filters to help improve the style of a poster, or add additional effects, such as wet clothes on a character. Once I am done manipulating the 3D environment, Photoshop is what allows me to tweak what I see through Camera 1 without using SFM's clunky methods, and do so better than SFM will allow."
SFM,3dhjw0,jediyoshi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:06:08 2015 UTC,This isn't correct. There's color correction. Color balance. Saturation. Brightness. Hue. Per channel (RGB) level editors.

It feels unnatural and breaks the image a bit. The door behind the spy is brighter than the spy and draws your eye away from him. Same goes for Blu Intel. The front of the truck cab intersects the Spy's form behind him and muddies the composition The spy's left hand and the back of his head are both lost in darkness because of a lack of rim light or adequate background light for contrast.

SFM,3ddgxx,-Josh,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:20:47 2015 UTC,"The sun height doesn't make it seem like it's a sunrise, you'd want it just about hitting the horizon for it to look like one. The rim on the spy doesn't seem to fit the sunlight color."
SFM,3ddgxx,9joao6,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:50:20 2015 UTC,"Rim on the spy is actually from the light from the ""sun"" that I put up (which is in the same place as the sun in the map, but I put it there and put some volumetrics on it to give it the feeling of bloom and so that it blew out the highlights in that area), so it's the same colour. It's just that it blew out the highlights where it hit him.  Unfortunately, I had ton work with where the sun is in the map as that's where all the map shadows originate from, so if I put the primary light from any other place, all the map shadows were wrong.   That being said, I wonder what happens if you put a light in the skybox...."

SFM,3ddgxx,ClintonM0,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:24:01 2015 UTC,"If this looks a little over-processed to you, I was going for a cross-processed look. It's a technique in photography where you process one type of film in the chemicals meant for a different type of film (typically when you process negatives in a transparency's chemicals or vice versa).   The result of cross processing is that the image is over saturated, it has a serious colour cast (often green, yellow or red) and  it's pretty damn grainy."

SFM,3dg1cp,ClintonM0,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:57:59 2015 UTC,"Alright, found the most likely problem and a solution.  The problem should be lying within the particle's orientation type.   Instance the particle system if you haven't already. Edit the particle system definition of the particle component that fades when the camera gets too close. The renderer of the particle should be render_animated_sprites. Click on the render_animated_sprites renderer to view its settings. One of the settings should say orientation type, which should be set at 3. Set it to 2."

It's the first video that I've actually stuck with for more than 3 hours without getting depressed and quitting. However, at this stage, I'd call it more of a proof of concept than anything else.  It is my first time doing any keyframing using the graph editor (rather than posing and smoothing with the motion editor), save for a small animation I made and posted here yesterday.  To do:   Improve lip-sync (anyone got any tips?) Animate the medic's body Clean up the blocks' trajectories (particularly that line piece in shot 4 which speeds up after it moves) Fix the minor continuity issues (e.g., the NEXT queue missing from the first few shots and having nothing on he last shot) Sync up the animation to the beat more Smooth out the camera"

At a point in time I made a pose, then went to another point in time, moved my work camera and made another pose, then I previewed my work using shift+mouse cursor while cursor is in viewport. I can also modify animation in a car to be faster/slower/whatever just deselect roottransform so he stays in a car.  Or If it is possible, copy camper van, and make it invisible, and remove any movement in first camper van and animate things in it without it actually moving, then add camper van movement as a last step by  just copying roottransform samples of moving invisible camper van."

SFM,3ctv15,Combustable-Lemons,4,Fri Jul 10 18:59:44 2015 UTC,"That scout is me. The babyface was so much fun. So much fun. Once, combined with bonk, it could change the game when your base was getting absolutely spawn camped by a stacked enemy team. And it made people focus more on playing for the objectives, and build up their defense to protect the intel. What's more, babyface scouts were still highly vulnerable to soldiers and sentries so they weren't invincible. Players just had to care about beating them as a team.  Now it's nothing more than a novelty.  I haven't played more than once since the update."
SFM,3ctv15,GrubFisher,5,Fri Jul 10 22:26:43 2015 UTC,"It was also super op.  Sentries are avoided, as any other scout would do and to be honest it's far too easy to dodge projectiles with that speed or just getaway after taking damage."
SFM,3ctv15,GrubFisher,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:31:05 2015 UTC,"Guess I never played on maps where it was a problem.   I mainly played on turbine where you can not escape sentries as a babyface scout. Nowhere to jump to, no way to scum it -- a well-placed sentry (or more accurately two) deep in the base beats a babyface scout every time on turbine. So if there were no sentries in the enemy's defense, it was a problem for them no matter how tight into your base they had gone. If there were sentries in the enemy base, it was a problem for you. It actually encouraged teamplay. Because once the enemy guys regroup and have a strong defense, it encourages your side to get it going as a squad with synchronized attack and support classes. It's the only way you'll penetrate because babyfaces then get swatted away like flies. More helpful mic talk too. Game quality goes up for everyone in that scenario. So what appears to be an imbalance actually builds balance, and creates a stronger team-oriented direction for the match. And it is Team Fortress.  sigh  Maybe they should've made better maps to accompany all the new weapons they've been releasing. But who the hell am I to suggest such things, I suppose."

SFM,3cjimp,ClintonM0,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:02:38 2015 UTC,"Don't jitter the camera too much. If you want a shaking scene, it's best to animate it manually. Jitter should always  be kept to a minimum, especially for the camera.   Posing and animating just takes time.   You'll really need to plan the videos you make, perhaps draw up a draft, or write down a play/script along with all the dramatic techniques. Otherwise, it's a mess, and there simply couldn't be any part that the audience would ""like"", since they can't keep up on what happens 99% of the time. Anything you share on the internet, whether it be a test or a project, will have an audience. They demand amusement, and not a waste of time. Quality over quantity."

SFM,3c6nu9,CommissarGray,2,Sun Jul 5 10:02:30 2015 UTC,"The animation and camera work were pretty decent for a first time film. You'll really need to work on lighting, and you should learn to create particles with the particle editor. The use of a wide FoV at the beginning wasn't really necessary, since wide FoV's are often used for wide shots that emphasise the setting.  It's not all about the technicals either. Keep in mind that your goal is to entertain the audience."
SFM,3c6nu9,ClintonM0,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:22:08 2015 UTC,"Apart from the yellow glow in the cockpit, I avoided doing the lighting entirely since I have practically no clue how it works and I was never any good at lighting anyway. Any good tutorials for it? As for particles - Same situation. Do you tell them when to start relative to the entire timeline or the clip they are in? I couldn't work that out.  Personally, I'd disagree with the wide FOV thing - Although I'll agree that they find most of their use in establishing shots, I find they can also be useful for engrossing a viewer in a busy scene, especially when used in conjunction with a slow track-out shots like this. The wide view wraps the viewer up in the scene and also stops the mise-en-scene being all squished up together. ....But that might just be me talking out of my ass."
SFM,3c6nu9,ClintonM0,2,Sun Jul 5 12:07:09 2015 UTC,"In thia scenario, a wide FoV would've been good if an anamorphic 2.35:1 resolution was used for the shot, while keeping all assets within the screen space.  Lighting is fairly easy to pick up. There are tutorials on setting up a technique known as Three-Point Lighting. Using particles shouldn't be difficult either, and is explained in Valve's official tutorials. Creating your own particles is where it can get challenging, but it's not entirely necessary to learn unless you're thinking about creating a large project."
SFM,3c64p1,hyperjumpgrandmaster,2,Sun Jul 5 04:47:04 2015 UTC,"The parts you animated are good, but remember that when a body moves not the ""close parts"" to the movement will move. For example the lower body area (hips, legs etc) are not moving at all. If you want to create a realistic looking animation the best thing you can do is stand in front of a mirror and actually act out what you want the model to do. Closely look at what moves a lot and a little in the whole body."
SFM,3c64p1,ecaflort,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:12:01 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! I definitely plan to keep refining this. I'll give the mirror exercise a shot.
SFM,3c64p1,ecaflort,2,Sun Jul 5 18:18:28 2015 UTC,if you have a camera then film yourself acting it so you can have an easy (and slowed down) look at it during animating!

SFM,3c5lbo,TheCodingEthan,4,Mon Jul 13 10:42:19 2015 UTC,"As everyone always rightfully says, we all have SFM and we can do our own posters. If you want to make loadout posters, you'll have more luck on /r/tf2, but if you want my personal opinion, loadout posters aren't a good way of improving. Unless you spend 3 or 4 hours on a single poster to refine it to the best of your skills, you'll improve very slowly.  Also, being able to paint or killstreakify items is no longer really considered a selling point. Nowadays, it's like putting ""THREE-DIMENSIONAL GRAPHICS!"" on the back of a video-game box. If you want to attract more attention, you gotta get some points of interest. Everyone can do custom poses, but what poses can you do? Can you do custom particles like dust or fog? Are you familiar with the color wheel and how to use it to your advantage? This all boils down to how pretty can you make do with the limits of the Source engine. That is what you should aim for.  Lastly, you'll have more luck with requests if you show some examples of your work.

SFM,3byekt,Topesc,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:31:10 2015 UTC,"A lot of your poses are very obviously paused animations. While using this technique isn't a bad thing, it just makes you look like you don't know how to pose characters. Take a look at something I've done. The Pyro uses one of the base poses that come with SFM, but it's hard to tell, because they're not in the exact same pose. So, what I'm saying is, using base poses is fine, but make sure it's hard to tell."
SFM,3byekt,BioOnPC,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:05:44 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. I'm assuming you paused the pyro's flip initiator animation and rotated the hands? I've started using rigs and I'm getting better at manipulating the characters.

Imaging what you would do to pull of a standing jump like that and animate it: you would first crouch down, pulling your arms back, and then throw your body forward, jumping, and then land and crouch again for the landing, pulling your arms forward, and then perhaps stand up again. I think it would look a lot more natural if you did this"

The nature of profanity and harassment of the SFM community, including many of its key members. I'll keep myself out of a bias on this case for now, since its use was rightful but ultimately against Steam's Code of Conduct. If the thief was any smarter, a lot community members would have recieved a legitimate report. In the future, we should keep our tracks covered. The power of the community. It's no longer the small community that a good amount of us had known. The support towards removing this thief was quite insane, and it's just going to become more powerful as time goes on. The more renowned members of the community are going to need to take more responsibility in handling events like these, instead of being one of the crowd. Our purpose in the community. This one's going to be very controversial. It sometimes felt like some of us have forgotten why we make films in the first place. Watermarks and other related anti-plagarism features have been suggested towards the community. For at least 99% of us, we make films for the fun of it; recognition is a secondary factor. We strive towards the best quality we could possibly create, a quality that we will not degrade for secondary purposes."

SFM I thought it was pretty A-OK :D My main comment is that I found it rather dark, I don't know if that's because of something on your end or mine, but I found it a bit hard to follow what was going on as a result. There's a camera slider called ""TonemapScale"" that lets you adjust the brightness (or lack thereof) of a shot, you might want to consider playing around with that. Last but not least, Nice job trying out so much lipsync! It's kinda rough around the edges, but hey. Personally I found Valve's official tutorial on lipsync to be incredibly helpful for getting acquainted with the lipsync controls.   Blabla I've talked a while. Happy SFMing!"

It's an option when you right-click on the lights in the outliner/animation editor. Basically, it gives the lights a volume that can be used to create interesting shadows, light shafts, ambient haze, etc. However, the way the source engine calculates volume and shadows often gets in the way of the desired result, and shadows and coloured light often look washed-out.   The background is blurred because I used the camera's depth of field settings (focaldistance/aperture).   Hope this helps!"

They all have this slow ""flow"" and movements. He animates all the models in the same way, and also it's a way of animating very strange. I repeat, not saying that he's bad.  How you should do animation if you really want to achieve something:   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmm0FEiy8MqrVFlit0Y6mPg   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1umWYFZdqOrKuhR0ALig5A  https://www.youtube.com/user/ModestCube/videos   https://www.youtube.com/user/Murraythis/videos   https://www.youtube.com/user/COBMetalHead/featured  """"""  2 - """"""I still don't get why you guys upload tests that you do while you're learning. I have a lot, but a f**** lot of animations that I haven't upload because I was able to understand that it hasn't anything to offer to any spectator.  Just saying, that if you upload it when you're still learning, there will be 2 types of comments:   1- Comments like mine, that will not feel good to you, and I also could tell you that you did horrible, but just because it's your first time, so it's normal, and nothing to worry about.   2-Then, there will be comments that will tell you how good you did, but this kind of comments suck, because if they tell you this, is because they just want to make you feel better, or they are even worst than you.  So, my personal advice is, don't upload this kind of things, just create them for your own, and if you want some advice, get a friend that has a lot more experiencie than you, and upload the video as hidden in youtube to show him.  You should upload things that you would enjoy watching, and others too. Things that could impress.  Do what ever you want, but just remember, don't take negative comments as mine too seriaously, and keep working to improve if it's really what you like and enjoy, and also, don't take positive comments like ""good job"" or things like that, because you'll maybe think that you are doing the best that you can, or you'll think that what you're doing is the best way to do what you did, so you would not improve.""""""  3 - [(Talking about walking animations, but it can be applied to any kind of movement that you want to do)]:   """"""First, you create the base poses, so maybe if it's a 10 seconds clip, for example, you create the 4 or 3 basic poses that this model is going to need. Then, you create more poses between the first blocks you made. Then you do the same again, and again, to the point that when you run the animation, you see it like you perfectly understand the movement. Then, you have to work to make it smooth and fix all the stuff that you need. It would be something like that the last blockin process:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l92zhUcsXjk (This is a very advanced one)  You can do it all with graph editor, or with motion, or with both. As you wish and prefer.""""""  //////////////////////////////////  I think that I have more comments there, but I don't really want to look for them. So, I'll just tell you that to get good at animation, you have to animate. It's simple. Remember to not be scared of starting very complicated animations that you feel that you'll not be able to do. Try them anyways, even if you know that the result will be horrible. Also, if you learn something about cinematography would help you a lot.   http://floobynooby.blogspot.com.es/2013/12/the-cinematography-of-incredibles-part-1.html  Here you have an amazing post of 3 parts. This is the first one, just go through the pages and get as much knowledge as you can.   Just work hard, don't upload shit, be more worried about what you learn than the impressions that you'll cause. Upload the things that you would watch if you haven't done them, and be patient. You will sometimes feel that you're not good at this, or you just get bored or something, maybe it's because you're just animating without a plan. To do animations, you need a plan, a mental map of the poses and the movements that you want to achieve with the perfect camera angles, illumination...

Going to be animating some relatively simple movements when I get the time to.  The tutorials aren't going to be exactly on how to animate a certain action, rather the aspects I keep in mind when planning any similar type of animation. Thus, these tutorials will most likely show a process that isn't as straight-forward as what you'd normally see in a typical step-by-step guide.

When you have a long distant shot you want to keep the movement of the camera low so the viewer can see what's happening. Most movies stay away from the record, at least not for the main character. You want to learn how to hand animate, it makes the movies a lot more quality. You needed some effects for the muzzle flash on the sniper. And the death scene, I like the little spin at the end, good touch. Good job, good luck!"

It should be one beam that shows for around 0.2 seconds. That particle works for me at least.  Most of the time the particles with ""ambient"", ""flare"", ""sparks"" or similar words at the end are child particles of the main particle system and most of the time placing those in your scene won't do anything because they have no emitter and need their parent system.  Also I haven't found a particle system that spawns a lot of the beams, but you could just create a lot of them and set the starttime apart by like 0.1 seconds to have a similar effect to start with."

Then, each bone should be staggered with a common interval, meaning that a keyframe is split up in terms of timing, according to how far down the bone is in its chain.

There's a distinct lack of lighting.  No shadows, not much contrast.  You didn't use SSAO, which can help a surprising amount when it comes to lighting on that characters. You used a DoF filter instead of using SFM's built in DoF, which looks miles better when used correctly (which isn't hard to use correctly, either).  Note that when you do, right click and increase your DoF samples to at least 128.  Contrary to what it says, it does not only affect the DoF quality. At least you made a custom pose rather than using a stock one!  However, it does have many issues, namely his hand holding the pistol.  Also, what's he looking at?

What you want to do, is select the piece(es) of cloth that you want to animate. Then, go to the end of how long you want to have the cloth move. Once you get there, move it up just a tiny bit. Next, press the plus sign next to the transform bones on both of the bones of the cloths you want to move. Then, use jitter, and pull it about 1/8 full of the bar. (Just like pull the slider just a bit is what I'm saying.) Then, use the smooth slider once or twice on it. This right here is a perfect example of the result of this process: https://youtu.be/3M1KmFmnkGc  Now, keep in mind, this should be used only for things like Wind blowing, or running.

SFM,3apnsv,SzotyMAG,2,Mon Jun 22 14:12:39 2015 UTC,"Even though the problem is fixed, I think some explanation might be helpful.  Polygons in 3D graphics are usually one-sided, meaning they only get rendered and affected by shading from one side. Thus, a light shining on the correct side of polygon would affect the shading of the polygon on both sides, while a light shining on the wrong side would not affect it at all. The use of $nocull 1 in Source engine materials does not negate this rule; it simply forces rendering on the wrong side of the polygon."

SFM,3aji3h,BanD1t,4,Sun Jun 21 07:10:46 2015 UTC,"There are only trading and items benefits. Everything else is exactly the same.   In TF2 community F2P is mostly used as a measure of skill and playtime, not investment of money. So a paid player that walks into walls and barely hits anyone (and without good hats) will be called a F2P.  The term came from the update that made TF2 Free-to-Play and gave a colossal influx of new players (usually wearing a Gibus and Pyrovision goggles since they're the easiest hats to get) who didn't know how to play properly so a lot of veteran players were mad.   but my understanding is that most paying enthusiasts are doing something else, which opens up a much larger world of available maps.   There are custom maps, custom game modes, and a lot of different mods which are not run on official servers (where most of the new players end up), also there is a competitive scene with some custom maps and weapon restrictions. But this is not restricted to paid players.  In other words, if a paid player got a F2P account with the same weapons and hats he wouldn't even notice.  TL;DR F2P = noob not F2P = has restrictions"

SFM,3aglzb,RydialH,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:52:16 2015 UTC,Something you can do also is: * Run Task manager * Find your SFM window * Right click it in the task manager--> Maximize and that should make it fullscreen :D
SFM,3aglzb,RydialH,2,Wed Jun 24 07:15:18 2015 UTC,"Alright wow hmm... I can't say I know what's happening. I played around with mine a bit and got this - my actual SFM window over my SFM window preview. What this leads me to believe is that you have a realllllly tiny SFM window floating around somewhere on your desktop, perhaps hiding off to one corner of your screen or another (or your other monitor if you have that). I hope this helps! I also wonder if you've figured this out already aha  I'll keep thinking on it"

SFM,3a7pg0,nicerafi,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:43:47 2015 UTC,Looks like the Dota models use .vmdl instead of .mdl formats.  Not sure what the significants of that is (cloth physics?).  So you might have to convert them unless I'm wrong.
SFM,3a7pg0,l4d4d4d,2,Thu Jun 18 21:40:16 2015 UTC,You can use crowbar to decompile the models and use the tools in the Reborn Tools Beta to import the models back in.  example of scout being put into source 2 through beta tools  edit: and here is one of scout's animations  edit 2: video!
SFM,3a7pg0,GoldtexTwitch,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:02:13 2015 UTC,Ugh.  I was hoping Valve would automate the process for source 2.  Oh well.  Thanks for the instructions.

The in-built maps are incomplete, with missing particles, and opening up .vmf files in the new Hammer wrecks the texture mappings.  A lot of assets are packed in .vpk files too now. Not cool."

Yep, I don't actually know the precise meaning on reddit, but when I say something and some people are just taking some sentences out of context and throw insult at me it don't really change my mind about what I imagine kids trying to make posters and getting mad at the first not enthusiastic comment.   this is not what came out of your OP.   Most of people just don't get the precise meaning of a sentence, they read, then they put their feelings in the understanding, and finally,  maybe subconsciously, they extrapolate the whole stuff.  It's mostly about emotions and feelings than the actual value of the content. It's not because I said some people are doing shit that I'm actually telling theses people they are doing shit.  But heh, not like it's the first time I come across this kind of misunderstandings, and I guess it's even worst in english."

You made yourself clear, which I respect. This, is what should've been in your op, but we make mistakes. I'm glad at least no one got hurt. ;)  I must agree, it is quite the sensitive topic now that you think of it.  Take care!  /u/Maximal113"
SFM,3a5yxg,Hayden11121,0,Thu Jun 18 15:05:58 2015 UTC,"Well, as I said, I'm pretty used to this kind of discussions actually, I'm never trying to please others at all costs, so sometimes I'm answering in a ""harsh"" (that was ""raw"" meant to) way, without actually having the feelings usually associated with theses comments.  I know it's not really the usual way of talk, it caused me some problem even in my real life, but it's also a way to keep the pragmatism all along, and keep focused on the actual goal I'm trying to achieve. It's also a way to see how people reacts to theses comments, if they can split the constructive part from the negative comment itself, if they will accept they are not perfect, and nobody is. For me it's a good way to see if the author is actually worth the time spent analysing his work and not just a kid who only seek attention and comments that will only please his ego.  It's a bit more complicated but it's a long debate and I'm not perfectly good in english so I can't actually explain it fully."

I don't care if I hurt your feelings, I don't care if you stuck to your narrow minded attitude, I did nothing wrong except explaining why some people might get bored of all theses wannabee lazy animators.  And regarding MY stuff, I don't owe you anything, it's not like I'm currently unemployed, I have other hobbies and I came to the conclusion making shorts is not enough rewarding at all. Spending months for one minute video is something I won't be doing again, but again, I'm not begging for attention with shit quality content.

I mat go back and adjust the entire pose at some stage as its not exactly correct. The angle at which the guns are pointed needs to be adjusted heavily as well. I've also lost all definition of the edge of the Flamethrower as well, so adjusting the point may help with that when re-lighting."
SFM,3a7veg,ClintonM0,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:33:11 2015 UTC,"So I've been looking into backwards compatibility with the new SFM.   Here's my words: If you have a major project, Dota or not, don't try porting it into the new SFM. There's very little backwards compatibility in the new SFM, with texture bugs for old .vmf/.bsp maps and different lighting systems, forcing you to relight your scenes."
SFM,3a7veg,eirexe,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:00:33 2015 UTC,"Makes sense, because SFM2 runs on Source2"
SFM,3a7veg,TheRealHandSanitizer,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:29:55 2015 UTC,"Models probably aren't compatible, but I wouldn't discredit the idea of porting the animation sequences between the 2 versions and then attaching the new models to the old sequence."

Considering right now you can't even launch the new SFM beta without running Dota 2, I'd say they are different projects entirely and you may not be able to port due to rigging concerns or just plain map concerns.  However, Valve could plan ahead which is a possibility, but wasn't stated."
SFM,3a7veg,eirexe,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:44:49 2015 UTC,The Dota 2 SFM runs on source 2 (and has bene called internally SFM2) that's why most of your stuff isn't compatible.
SFM,3a6l10,MastaAwesome,3,Wed Jun 17 17:03:58 2015 UTC,"Now I would recommend, of course, looking at 3 point lighting. But I would also drastically lower the map scale lighting as much as possible. Now here is where things get tricky, because now you have to relight everything, but it is much more in your control. From the looks of it there would be more light on his back from the background than so in the front, or you could dramatically have a helmet on his head hide part of the light that would hit his face, then make a close up where the light goes into his eyes as he says something dramatic.

SFM,3a6l10,Miki9559,3,Thu Jun 18 07:37:01 2015 UTC,"1st scene is actually good. Only thing is that you should fix jaggy movement of heavy's head and read something about ""three point lighting"".  I really like dynamic, sharp shadows. Can't see them in Your video, basically there are no lights at all after 1st scene. This makes whole scene feels kinda.. flat, empty? Oh. And about camera movement. 1st scene looks great, I can't complain... but at the end? Too chaotic movement and camera FOV is too big. Because of that it doesn't feel like a movie. U used graph editor to animate it, don't you?  0:19 - I don't like this part where you zoom in the camera(change fov) and move it closer to heavies. It makes this weird effect: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_zoom  And please, don't consider me as a jerk who is hating your video. It has a lot of potential and I'm just saying what I think about it. I'm also animating in SFM, I actually teach ppl how to use it. Cheers"

Too many times on this subreddit, though, I've seen people stop posting either because they don't get feedback or they get nonconstructive feedback.  Yes, some newcomers make rookie mistakes. However, there are people who don't have time to go through the many tutorials out there, or the time to spend more than ""a few solid hours"" on a poster. Even if someone worked on something for less time, I think they still deserve helpful critique.  I use SFM because I want to have fun. I don't want to work at Pixar, but I have ideas that I want to create and share with others. Maybe others feel the same way. In that case, we shouldn't downgrade their work and make them avoid this subreddit or SFM altogether.

The grass doesn't cast shadows, the robot from the moon map isn't casting shadows, even the rock in the background to the left isn't casting shadows. Even the dog!  Source was never really meant for filmmaking in the first place, it is a videogame engine after all, but now that Source 2 is officially out for Dota 2 Reborn, maybe Valve will port SFM over it. And I say maybe when what I really mean is dear god I hope they do because SFM looks so bad compared to so many other engines.  Some people may think I'm being unfair. When people ask ""what's the upside to SFM over Blender?"", most people, including me, say ""realtime previewing"", or ""speed"", or even ""WYSIWYG"". But really, is that an upside? It might just be a... sideside... yeah IDK, but my point is, being able to preview your movie in real time is nice and all, but that just means you can see all of the ugliness in real time. And that's the movie you're gonna render. Sure, DoF can fix a few things, but... not really.  I dunno. About to go obsolete, I doubt it.

Textures needed to be loaded separately, but Source2 was converting them to right format on the fly.  It was supporting OBJ, FBX, DMX, SMD, where SMD and OBJ was only for props, and FBX and DMX for characters, animations(if i remember correctly, someone please confirm).   The only problem I've had was importing smd file for character model. It wouldn't rotate it's default pose correctly (model was lying on the ground) and wouldn't load bones. Oh, and missing Eyes shader.  ...but it was quite long time ago (year or so), so it probably works better now. :V"

Maybe too much contrast? Sorry, I can't be more specific.  Also, I think that cropping a foot out in both of your posters is weird. The second more so than the first, because only half of the left foot is showing, which looks somewhat incomplete. There are guidelines on this stuff in photography, and I think they should be considered in any portrait. If you want to focus on the upper body, my suggestion is to show only the upper 2/3rds of the body. It's subjective, though :P  Everything else is fine, in my opinion. I like the text added in your first poster... very cool placement. And I really think your second one looks fantastic, maybe because I'm biased towards the color blue. Either way, I like what you've submitted so far."

If people are that salty over some video game metal when what they should be doing is having fun, what's the point?

I don't know if that's what it's supposed to look like, but it looks a little weird to me.  Another thing is the wrench in the Engineer's hand. It's a bit hard to see, and it's partially covered by his head/hat. Also, you might want to make it as clear as possible what he's doing. The pose could be interepreted in multiple ways: him about the strike the sentry, him rubbing the wrench against his head in confusion (even though I understand he's smiling), or him just looking at his sentry in pride. However, it's hard for me to tell what you wanted. It's pretty much about posing, which DummiesBelow already talked about, but that's my two cents on it :)  Your poster looks good, though.

Focal Distance and Aperature - It lets you focus on an object and slightly blur the background and foreground.  Lighting - Search 3 point lighting  Posing - Not sure if this is a Valve made pose, but assuming it is, try and make your own custom poses, it's the main draw for SFM. It makes things feel more alive. This looks like a screenshot from the game with better lighting.  Resolution - The image looks grainy. This could just be Steam compressing it, but if it isn't, try rendering at 1080p. Tutorial here"

SFM,39mfh6,Luke_Kepler,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:26:21 2015 UTC,"This grain is actually ambient occlusion. Its grainy because you use default, cheap post process settings.  To fix this you have to do one of this: 1) Set ""motion blur"" to at least 64 2) Set ""depth of field"" to at least 128 (RMB on primary viewport -> render settings)  I usually set both to 128 when rendering quick posters. Remember that by increasing it you are also increasing render time. Not painful when you are making a poster, but very painful when you render an animation. Cheers"

The shots are also jumping around the scene and there's no relative objects or points of interest for the viewer to recognize.  Look into the 180 degree rule, often referred to as ""the line"". When the man turns around to look at the Pyro he breaks this rule because of the position of the camera."

Next thing that happens is you try animate for the first time and realise you've made a blob. After trying over and over again, you find out you've been doing the whole animation process wrong all along.  For now, I'd just recommend you get used to the SFM interface and how keyframe/graph animation works."
SFM,395bcm,ClintonM0,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:04:35 2015 UTC,"You're right. I tried animation on SFM before this video, all the stuff just came out very awkward and unnatural. I understand this comes with practice, but it seems the CS:GO models are simply not suited to animation without a great amount of time required. Hopefully someone could change that. Your animation certainly looks like it's getting there, keep it up! :)"
SFM,395bcm,ClintonM0,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:40:58 2015 UTC,"I think it would be good to know what practice actually does. More experienced animators are able to appropriately apply more animation principles (you should search them up) into a character's actions, and are able to plan fluent movements. There's nothing that's making it physically impossible for a beginner to make fluent animations. Being able to tell if the animation you have in mind works the way you want it or not is the key thing that differs an beginner to a veteran.  Also, a very important thing to note is that audiences won't simply want to just look at a few minutes of computer animation. Since SFM gets very close into film and creative freedom, you'll finally be able to use those notes you took down in your high school English classes. If you ever start a decently sized project on SFM one day, this is probably the most important tip I have for you.  On a side note, it's been a long time since I've publicly posted an animation onto my channel. I've been just busy working on a team project.

However, it looked weird when the camera moved with the Spy when he says, ""It was not there."" Sorry I can't give better criticism than that, but right now I'm a bit preoccupied with final exams.  A few more things... Cigarette lights aren't usually that bright. I suggest giving a very faint glow, but mostly use the same lighting you used on Gray Mann. Also, with close-up shots, you might want to use lower FOV, because it looks a bit off.  Your cinematography, though, is really good (I think that's the right term). I especially like the shot of the two of them just standing there after Mann says, ""I see."" Nice music, too, even if it was minimal. You also did a pretty good with the timing of everything... I find that to be the harder parts of animating.  I might come back to this and give better feedback, but in the meantime, nice job :D I actually liked it a lot."
SFM,390div,hobiruke_hobi,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:28:13 2015 UTC,"Ok, Part 2! Honestly, there's not much to say, and I'm probably nitpicking at this point.  From around 0:43-0:46, it looks odd when Mr. Mann sorta just stares at the camera. I understand that the focus is on the Spy lighting his cigarette, but it would look more natural if he just maybe moved a little--like his eyes. You probably wanted him to not look at the Spy so that he could then look and ask ""What?"" later on. However, it might be more effective to instead have him move even more when he says that. He could look even more furious when he questions the Spy, and then try to cover up his emotions, since they seem to be discreet and meeting in secret. Or, that's the impression I got, since they're not facing each other.  Hopefully that made sense. Again, that's just me being nit-picky. One more thing, and that's the volume of the sound. The dialogue is very soft compared to the train, and it's hard to tell what Gray Mann says in the beginning. It's another minor detail, but it could improve your video by a smidgen."

Don't be worried if your animations look ridiculous due to exaggerating.   An idea on how a character should be animated in a scene is quite crucial for a relevant animation.

SFM,3906pj,ClintonM0,2,Tue Jun 9 00:44:27 2015 UTC,I guess the only tip I can give from my recent SFM experience is to have some sort of anticipation  before the character does an action.

Pose for the flames to be off to the side, and this will allow for actual dramatic lighting with deep shadows. Also, reframe your camera! The composition is sloppy and loose.

Regarding the effects, smoke, lighting - especially in the first one - they are made in photoshop or similar 2D software. You can achieve some good quality with SFM, but the particles are just way better than the ones in SFM, because you cant really edit them, increase luminosity for example."

Unfortunately I don't know much about exporting taunt animations so I can't help with that problem, but looking at the Content Tree path I see the 'sourcefilmmaker/content/usermod' which doesn't exist. You may be able to change that to 'game' instead and it may work, but i'm just guessing there.  Good luck!"

SFM,384kgv,9joao6,6,Wed Jun 3 21:44:18 2015 UTC,"Hello. First of all, best of luck with the project.  From the SFM FAQ page:   Q. Can I make money with this tool?  Yes, but not if you’re using Valve’s assets in your movie. The tool is free for non-commercial use. You can use Valve’s game assets (things like characters, props, particles, textures, and sounds) to create movies and images to share with the game community, as long as what you create is free. We’re not giving you a license to commercialize our assets. However, if you do not include any of Valve’s assets in the movies and images that you make, then there are no restrictions on what you do with your content and you can make money with it.   I'm not sure if this counts towards Kickstarter pledges, but it's helpful info.  Also, I would highly recommend making it seem more professional.   MERCENARY MANN AND BOSTON BOY is an unofficial comic a series based in the Valve universe!.   Couple of grammar mistakes. Also, either pick TF2 universe or Valve universes if you're going to include other IPs.   BUT THERE WAS ONE PROBLEM. A kinda big one. When I was 'surfing' one day, riding the proverbial waves of this vast ocean called the internet – you guessed it – that same shark ate my computer*   None of this matters, nor has anything to do with the project itself.   (Please don't sue me valve, I love you <3)   And this won't help you either.  What I'm basically trying to say is that despite being a nice idea, this could very easily end up in /r/shittykickstarters if you don't polish it quite a bit. Add more example images at the very least, to show what degree of skill you've earned since the last poster.  One last thing...   and awesome lighting effects!   Why even mention this? Out of all the free 3D software out there, SFM has the ugliest lights due to just being projected textures, and having lighting as a selling point is just silly."

SFM,37th8e,Lemthur_Drye,1 point,Sat May 30 06:47:23 2015 UTC,the angle of the left foot on the far right sniper seems really messed up
SFM,37th8e,MrPeachie,3,Sat May 30 18:02:42 2015 UTC,"Cool concept, and the color is nice. The posing is very awkward though, and makes each character seem stupid and borderline derp-comedy. The lighting and content suggests this is supposed to be dramatic though, so improve the poses to bring the piece together.  Some other nitpicks:   The two loadouts on each side are too small, and there's tons of wasted space in the composition (I'm looking at you, glaringly large bottom left corner!).   If middle sniper is supposed to be lit by that cigarette, it shouldn't be casting a shadow of his hand. This gives away the light source and ruins the effect. I actually did a very similar type of lighting on an SFM piece I did last year, here's an example:  http://i.imgur.com/8bfT0yD.jpg  For the jar on the left, I used 4 different lights all pointing at different spots on the sniper to make it seem like the jar was glowing, when really it wasn't.  I did some more effects like this on a couple others so you can see how it works depending on where the source is:  http://i.imgur.com/XSPO4AV.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/fLQ6Y.jpg  I do lighting like this for a living, so I love talking about it! Let me know if you have any questions."

SFM,37th8e,TTLego,2,Sun May 31 07:03:43 2015 UTC,"I'm a cinematographer in real life, so I definitely know my lighting! SFM has very limited capabilities in terms of light parameters, so I end up using three or four separate lights to make an effect that I can do in real life with one or two sources. Still though it's a blast to not have to worry about running power, rigging stands, and dealing with spill, color shift, etc.   I was thinking of doing a tutorial actually, but didn't know if anybody would be interested! Maybe I'll give it a go this week."

SFM,37th8e,TTLego,2,Mon Jun 1 06:33:24 2015 UTC,"This was just a little something to get back into the swing of things after about a one month break. There probably wont be any more improvements or adjustments made to this, sad to say.  But I'm curious, what about the poses makes them look so stupid? Most of the poses (left and right) are just slightly modified stock poses, so what about them is so bad? I know I shouldn't ever use stock poses, and I rarely do, but I just couldn't seem to get the poses to work entirely freehand.  And for the massively empty bottom left corner, I would love to have some crashing waves hitting it, but I couldn't find any, otherwise I  would. I find it hard to have anything happening against a rock of that size that actually makes sense, so if you have a suggestion, I might test it out.  Thanks for the constructive criticism, Lem Drye"
SFM,37th8e,C47man,1 point,Sat May 30 17:16:27 2015 UTC,"The main problem is that the poses are unrealistic in terms of weight distribution and natural movement. Sniper on the right, for example, is supposedly running, and yet his torso is essentially a straight vertical line. People don't run like that. For example, look at how Hawkeye hunches over a bit while he is running. It adds a sense of speed and power. You can still have the spine straight if you tilt it over though, for example, let's look at another Hawkeye shot. His body is straight but they tilts his entire frame a bit to lend a sense of power and movement. Also notice his bow form. The bow and drawstring extend parallel to the arm holding the bow. In your image this is not the case, and the bow is drawn away from the holding arm. This makes it seem awkward.  So in addition to those fundamental posing errors, you also have small pose errors like the sniper's left foot being impossibly angled upward to the point it is glitching and we can see through his pants. Similarly, his two legs seem to be oriented in different directions.  Ok, middle sniper guy. He is supposedly leaning on his rifle, but his body doesn't lean towards the rifle at all. His arm is just sort of up there, and there doesn't seem to be any weight. Try standing up for a second and leaning on your chair, or your rifle if you have one sitting next to you. Notice that your body will lean slightly towards it at the hip, and that your leaning arm will point back towards your body, not away from it. This is the best example I could find.  Also, I only realized on second viewing that his trigger finger is red hot, and not a cigarette! Sweet idea, but try posing his hand so that it is more obvious it is his finger, since right now the glow effect itself almost obscures his finger.  The left side pose on the rock is the best one in the composition, but not quiiiiite right. When shooting a rifle, one leans into the weapon, while your sniper is leaning slightly away from it. The backbone from his hip to neck should be going forward, but it seems it is slightly backward. Does that make sense?"

SFM,37dwvi,Spektugalo,2,Tue May 26 22:35:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the very kind words :) Yeah, in a way this was my very first own project, but I reworked it again and again for very many hours, so once I figured out something new, I went back and tweaked everything once again. Thus, this project came into being over the course of many weeks or even months, it was pretty much learning by doing.  It was a real pain with my old laptop though, even without any lighting and rendering options I only had <15 FPS and had to do the lip synch with a copy of the character in an empty corner of the map to gain a few more frames. Now that I have a new and much more powerful laptop, I can actually preview everything with all the nicer rendering options.  I also noticed that I feel quite comfortable with facial animation, but still have a hard time to do body animation, so I kinda worked around a few flaws by just partially using stock animation for certain parts of the limbs.  Also, the cord of the telephone was such a pain to animate, because the joints are in reverse order of what actually would be convenient to animate (the 'parent joints' start at the box, not at the receiver, so adjusting it to the medic movements was more than tedious :P)  In a way, I have only done three projects so far: The SFM tutorial, this Bohemian Rhapsody and then I helped another member of the SFM community (PalmliX) with some lip synch for one of his projects. But that was two years back; I was a student back then and had quite a lot of free time on my hands, now I am rather busy, but I'd love to continue the project at some point (especially now that SFM runs really smoothly); I'm just not sure about the body animation, that still seems like a beast to master (or at least to make it look decent).  @Mr0ll3: I think back when I started to work on this, the heavy voice actor thingie didn't even exist yet; who knows, maybe I'll just do that at some point :D  tl;dr: I'm very grateful for all the nice comments, maybe I will find the time to continue it some day."

SFM,37idjn,LachyB2000,3,Wed May 27 21:19:41 2015 UTC,"Great to see you've taken the time to develop and use the constructive criticism from your previous posts, I haven't got much else to do today, so be warned for a lengthy paragraph on my own tweaks and opinions which I may take into consideration when creating an image such as this. Whilst the concept is nice, the main issues I have with the image, would be; slight composition (Taking into consideration the use of focal lens, aperture and subject), posing, and lighting. Along with a few other tips I hope to be able to provide, which could prove useful to you. When going through these points, I hope the links I happen to provide can help support you in the process of development when creating more images in the future!  Composition: Whilst the composition of the image does at first glance, seem correct, you will most likely always want to follow one or another rule of composition, this can be in various forms, but the two most common would include the, Rule of Thirds or The Golden Ratio. With the most common of the two, being the rule of thirds, this allows a strong aesthetically appealing visual effect to the viewer, and in comparison to your image you can see how the Blue Spy and Sentry are in line with the rule of thirds in comparison to the Red Spy, which would be why my eye is drawn towards the Blue Spy more, this would lead me onto the use of the focal lens and aperture, as since my eye is drawn towards the Blu Spy more, I would expect him to be in focus especially due to the detail you have taken when expressing facial expressions, and the eye contact he is making to the other subject. From Personal experience, framing the image, I would have created this as an Eye-Level Shot, due to the fact that the low angle shows a sense of power, yet the power between the two characters is indifferent, due to the Red Spy seaming more confused throughout the situation, providing the confusion to the audience. Supporting this, I very much like the use of aperture, you have within the frame, as it emphasizes the narrative of the image, and creates a stronger sense of depth. But as stated before, I would have personally liked it,if the Blu Spy, portrayed as the main subject, was in focus as well, as I see him as the more important representation of the narrative, seen within this Example   Posing: From the transition of your Original Image, to this Updated One, I can't see much changes and manipulation in posing wise. Whilst I must state that the fact you use custom posing for your first poster is tremendous by the way, but do not feel afraid of using sequence tools for additional detail, such as hand poses as not only can the hand be a bitch to express and move, but with the such variety of sequenced hand gestures provided, you can achieve a vast range of emotion's while offering that extra bit of detail. A tip, that has always assisted me when posing my characters within images, is too use reference images. Like seen within this one example of My Own Poster, I used the reference image of the iconic ""Spiderman Jump Pose"" not only due to the iconography linked with the character, but due to the strong posture and articulation which can be achieved and seen. Replicating an existing pose, not only develop's your vast skill set, but allows you to think outside the box. In your own poster provided, references such as This, offer a realistic, yet dramatic, interpretation on the posture, I sense you're hoping to achieve. Overall the posing for a first attempt is great and I hope these points help you develop over time, that being said custom posing, is something that can only be improved on by my experience of practice!  Lighting: I can see that the introduction of lighting has been used, including the basic Three-Point Lighting technique, but either due to the brightness of the map, or the intensity of the lights, this has not been put to full effect. Tip: You can always turn down the Map Scale, by manipulating the ""ToneMapScale"" bar presented within the camera itself. Along with the use of Ambient Occlusion, this tutorial goes into depth about how not only you can improve posters, but the aesthetically qualities it provides, such as the various depth & tone you can achieve. I would strongly reccomend checking out the Jimer Lins channel as a whole for some strong support and guides to quick access tools which you may not have known about in SFM!  In conclusion, I see this as a very strong first poster and the fact that you have developed the poster, shows your initiative and love for the software itself. Whilst I see some points which can be improved, I do strongly enjoy the concept and how you have presented the characters within the frame itself. I can only see your posters getting better as time goes on, if you hope to continue with SFM itself! I hope this has helped you in some way and wish to see more work you create in the future!"

SFM,37e6e3,LachyB2000,1 point,Tue May 26 23:44:54 2015 UTC,"Looks very good.  Seems like you already have an idea of how to pose models. I would consider lowering the field of view a lot and zoom in. Helps create a more dramatic scene. Also, consider using lights to further the dramatic effect. Many guides on somthing called 3 - point lighting are all over the internet. I would highly suggest looking into it. Adjust the  area of focus on the camera so the background is becomes blurred, as this will centralize the poster on the spies, while also seeing the sentry in the background. Lastly, you may want to learn how to use particle effects so you can simulate the electricity of a sapper. You don't have to worry too much about this since this is your first, and particle effects are for users with a bit of experience.  Overall great first poster.  Keep up the good work"

But, the bugs are consistent.  A player shouldn't have to do this, but after about the second or third level you will completely understand how to compensate for the bugs and it actually becomes quite a fun game. Very similar feel to Sonic Adventure 1 and 2."

SFM,373o6g,Maximal113,1 point,Mon May 25 16:13:22 2015 UTC,"Well I didn't know how to put it exactly, but that's actually precisely what I as thinking about when I said ""profesional"". I also do my own posters and I kept thinking it would be so great if someone actually studying human poses would see and react to my work since it all is based on my intuition. I already posted mine in this sub but if you feel interested to point out the flaws here's the album: https://imgur.com/a/HA55n Sorry if it's hard to relate since the art in Warframe is so unique. These are very mysterious characters, never talking or taking off their helmet. It's not even confirmed they are human."
SFM,373o6g,Aerial_1,2,Mon May 25 17:06:23 2015 UTC,"Really great composition, fantastic lighting, fabulous particles (and don't get me started on the backgrounds :D) and the poses are just perfect, looking natural and quite stiff, which it should be seeing as they have quite the full on armor.   One thing that did catch my attention was pictures nr.8-9, his pose seems off from the whole situation. How would a covert ops spy look like in a situation like that? Probably leaned towards the wall next to the opening, also leaning a bit outwards to get a glimpse of what is currently happening. What it tells me however, is that there is a janitor watching an army patrol rather than an opposing force ready to kick some robot ass! (Weird similarities, but you'll probably get my drift.)  A great tip from someone like me and many other artists, use your own body as a template.   You cannot stand on your hand with your back twisted into oblivion? Well, wouldn't be such a good poster then. What you can do (now, this goes for simpler poses and such, and not super agile poses, though possible if agile.) is often what looks the best. Take photos of yourself, use a mirror, or just look down/up on your body to see what goes where without breaking any limbs.  Whew, sorry for all this text, but long story short, your posing is not a major destroying problem, nor is it much of one either, but holy shit you can make some fantastically beautiful pieces, continue what you are doing and you'll amaze me even more!  Cheers,  /u/Maximal113"
SFM,373o6g,Maximal113,1 point,Mon May 25 17:53:00 2015 UTC,"Aww, thanks! I really need all the text I can get from a person like you. I couldn't have done them like that without huge passion for the game lore and art. I need all the feedback! Also I actually did try posing myself because it helped me understand how the weight is distributed in different stances. Will surely do it more.   As for the stiffness. I am not sure I was going specifically for that. Without going too much into details, these armors are kind of a mix of biological and mechanical constructions. Most of the time it appears like a rubber that is bond with the wearer and most importantly the game calls itself ""space-ninjas"" so the characters are incredibly agile and acrobatic even with that armor. I think I was simply trying to show them composed and calm, standing in static poses and fitting in the narrow frame that I set up to do. In game and lore they are actually based a lot on eastern culture, meditating, stealth (again ninja), melee combat mastery... Is it still okay for them to be stiff or should I give them more freedom?"
SFM,373o6g,Aerial_1,2,Mon May 25 19:26:45 2015 UTC,"It is okay as long as the artist believes it is, that said being you. I actually like the stiffness they have there, as they're not in motion or as it seems, not needing to be in motion. But don't be afraid of testing new things. When I want to save some manpower, I usually hide one thing or another or make some thing sloppy, just enough so it is not too noticeable.  I'd love to see more from you and maybe even give some critique if you insist. As of the time I'm writing, I'll be off to bed, watching some Archer and thinking I can animate, but I'm too lazy to.

SFM,375fw3,CrayonNip,1 point,Mon May 25 01:12:53 2015 UTC,"They all look very nice :D Since you insist on getting advice, though, here's what I personally think you could improve on.  A lot of your lights look the same. It's not bad at all, but I find lighting to be one of the most fun things to work with. Maybe play around with intensity or colors! Your ""first try at SFM"" has this  bright pink light that stands out and, in my opinion, looks pretty cool.  Your loadout type of posters are all good. The ""still practicing custom poses"" looks fine for the most part. For that picture and the ""different loadout"" one, I think you could do more to tell a story. How does the Soldier feel looking down at his enemies' bodies? And what's going through the heads of Spy or Sniper (besides the knife)? You could maybe show that more through posing and emotions.  However, these aren't major things. Really, your posters already look great. A way you might improve is by thinking of the story behind the poster. Maybe the second picture could be more interesting with the Engineer having a frustrated or enraged look on his face, and Spy smiling smugly with a nonchalant pose, because it says something about the characters and situation.  Anyways, fantastic job!"

SFM,375fw3,hobiruke_hobi,1 point,Tue May 26 01:00:47 2015 UTC,"I think you should just try different lighting until you find what you like best.

They are essentially the same thing, but lenses try to mimic real world cameras so people using sfm can have a set value to what lenses are for what situation.   Example, I read a guide online about real world photography, that says 8mm - 15mm is good for wide shots, so I use SFM's 15mm lens, that tries it best to mimic its real world equivalent."

SFM,36vxky,-Josh,7,Sat May 23 02:42:49 2015 UTC,"I got out of bed to reply to this. I'm a fashion photographer and I can properly nerd out about lenses.  So, I sort of ramble here. Remember - none of these are rules, these are guidelines to help you find the right lens length for what you're trying to do.  Lenses are so important. As much as possible, they've tried to make lenses in SFM mirror their real world equivalents, but because they're just software, naturally they're not the same.  The number before mm (which is just milimeters) is known as their focal length. It's all a bit more complicated in real life, but think of it this way:  Imagine a hole that's a certain size (make a hole with your thumb and first finger and you can actually do this). Now imagine you move that hole close to your eye. You can see quite a bit out of it when it's close. This is a short focal length - the short distance between your eye and the hole means you can see lots.  Then move the hole away from your eye. Notice how you can see less stuff through the hole. This is equivalent to a long focal length. This is why these numbers make sense when you talk about lenses.  So, short focal lengths are wide view, long focal lengths are a narrow view.   Short focal lengths, or wide angle shots, have a lot of uses. They can distort reality in subtle ways. You can carefully elongate limbs, and give something a dream like feel, twisting our natural understanding of proportions into something that just looks a little off. You can make rivers sweep, low and wide with the mountains spreading along the background. Anything below 28mm for me is a low focal length.   The human eye is considered to see the world in a similar way to a 35mm lens. I tried explaining this, but after writing a paragraph and a half I realised it added nothing. Just take my word for it. So lenses of this focal length are often considered to be the most ""Naturalistic"" looking lenses and are often used for human interest stories and journalism. They can provide a natural feel of an onlooker that is there but does not disturb, merely observing. It is a very neutral choice, but not one to be underestimated. I would always start with a 35mm lens and work out if you don't know where to begin with a scene, especially if you want a crowd shot.  (Note, I really wanted to include some Robert Capa, that last photo bears the description ""FRANCE. Biarritz. October 1936. The convention of the Radical Socialist Party. The Party was deeply split when some members of the party used the Fascist salute, while others used the Communist one."" he also took this photo of the Normandy Landing).   Just as wide lenses tend to distort, long lenses have their own features. Here's a portrait of Bill Clinton (I was searching for a different one, but hey), this one was taken with quite a wide lens. Notice how the nose seems to pop out from his face. When we get to something like 50-80mm lenses we see something different happens.   If you want to get in super close, stop moving the camera closer and use a longer lens. It's a pain in the arse to actually move, but you will get far better results. An 85mm lenses are a nice sweet spot for an intimate portrait. 50mm lenses are more casual.  Now, at this point I want to talk about Bokeh. Notice how the subject is in focus, but the background isn't? You probably think of it as Depth of Field. DOF. Because SFM is software rather than real life, it has to simulate DOF. Which is a shame, because it's so inherent to photography and film making. When you want to put emphasis on a character, you can do so much of it with changes in depth of field.   But in real life, depth of field is a funny beast. Have you ever wondered why photos like these look like they're just toys? Depth of field is the answer. Unfortunately, explaining why is cumbersome and I don't want to waste words and I started explaining how using different apertures to cut off light--- nevermind.  When you compose a scene with a wide open background, use a small amount of depth of field to make it feel more natural as the background just gently fades off, which will give your subjects a bit more pop. God, saying it like this is so wrong, but in SFM you literally have to add DOF using software, so whatever.  But when you start using a longer lens and bring your subject closer to the lens you should use use more background blur to further isolate the subject (if that's what you want to do stylistically). Doing this sort of thing can really isolate a someone and you can make them feel very lonely. Or alternatively make two characters feel very intimate. Romance will often involve using shorter depths of field (more blurry) to indicate that these two people are in their own world and it induces a soft, dreamlike quality when you go a little overboard. Wedding photographers will go absolutely nuts with shallow depths of field.   But if you want to be a master cinematographer there's something you should know.   Longer lenses (can) have shorter depths of field. So a really long lens (something like a 200mm lens) can have a much shorter DOF than an 18mm lens. Because physics. Also, DOF effects things that are closer to the camera more. So something super close can either be in focus with everything else out of focus, or be really out of focus as the focus is on something further away from the camera.  Use depth of field accordingly, make it feel natural and people will be more drawn into your work.   Or alternatively, abuse the weirdness to make something special."
SFM,36vxky,Sketchmatters,1 point,Sat May 23 00:43:08 2015 UTC,"Oh man, that was great to read! All of this stuff is great to know too, thank you so much for adding to this! Is it alright with you if I add your comment to the FAQ as well?  Also, about the DOF, I know SFM has a focal distance feature that makes backgrounds blurry when you use it, as shown here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqeWpPZIOwM Is that not good enough to simulate DOF?"
SFM,36vxky,-Josh,1 point,Sat May 23 01:33:00 2015 UTC,"Man, I wrote a whole comment then accidentally closed it when I tabbed out for a source photo.  You can absolutely add my comment in, just credit me using either here or here  Basically, DOF in SFM is super limited and very backwards.   Aperture is literally backwards - in reality a lower aperture number means a shorter/shallower/smaller depth of field. So f/1.4 has a MUCH shallower DOF than f/8 or f/22.  You can't make DOF very shallow at all - I would like to have a shallow enough DOF that I can have the tip of the Spy's knife in focus, but the handle out of focus.  FOV doesn't seem to have any bearing on DOF at all. This may not seem problematic, but when combined with point 2 is seriously limiting. In real life, the narrower your FOV the shorter your DOF. In SFM, DOF is only affected by how far away something is. This is problematic because it means you need to use a very wide lens if you want to get in close and get a crop shot. I would love to do portraits of the Mercs where their eyes are in focus, but their ears are out of focus, but I can't do it because of the limitations. They don't have any serious lighting bokeh as far as I can make it work. When a real light is in the background and out of focus - they do this. Essentially become these round circles. You can also see some weird stuff going on around the edges, which happens due to physics of bending light, lens coatings and more. But if you stop down the aperture a little bit, you can get some interesting things where you can see how many blades the aperture has, which can add a slight feel of realism as the bokeh isn't just over-smooth.Though some lenses (like the Summiluc 50/1.4) are praised for their gorgeously smooth bokeh.   So... no. Not really. It's better than nothing, it adds some cinematic qualities, but the DOF in SFM is really limited."

The examples you used are perfect, and I appreciate that you took the time to explain what they should be used for too! I had a poster I created a few days (wanted to use it to help me with an art piece I wanted to draw) and the lens distorted the perspective of everything in an awkward way, but I wasn't sure what to do about that - and now I know why! I had the FoV slider pulled all the way to the right, and that's where the problem started. This has helped me a lot, and I'll definitely be keeping this stuff in mind for my future stuff, thank you very much!

I have a little background in drawing so knowing my program, I took the color from the background and colored over the edges. That made it a little blocky around the fingers from my (slightly messy) coloring, so I then did a little bit of a rehash of similar colors around the fingers to make it blend in better with the background. You can still kind of see where I changed things, but you have to really be looking for it.   I also took a blending tool to a lot of the really hard edges so it would look ''cleaner'' and more semi-realistic. I did that around where I added/took away some portions of the fingers so that the shadows would look more natural. c:  I could try to show you if you wanted?

Then, you create more poses between the first blocks you made. Then you do the same again, and again, to the point that when you run the animation, you see it like you perfectly understand the movement. Then, you have to work to make it smooth and fix all the stuff that you need.

You can see that as a thumbnail, the poster looks ok, but when zoomed in to its actual size, it's very distorted the closer it gets to the edges. That's your Field Of View, and by default in SFM it is set to be very high, and that's because it works better for working with the Work Camera, however, for the final product, you want to set the actual Camera's FoV to be lower. Click on the Camera in the Animation Set Editor, and to the right there should now be a Lenses tab. Choose a slider that you like, and drag it all the way to the right. Most people go with 35mm and 50mm, which work very well. You can also drag the fieldOfView slider to set a custom FoV. Pose yo fingers and face! It is clear that the Scout is not holding the bat; both his hands are wide open and the bat is just floating there. You don't want that, now do ya? If you're using a rig, you can open the Fingers group on the Scout model to pose them. Always pose them! It's been a while since SFM has been released, and at this point everyone knows how a default hand looks like. Also, pose your faces too! Seriously, it's worth it in the end, and again, everyone knows a default face when they see one. Light yo scene! It's clear that the only light in your scene is coming directly from the camera, as no shadows are being casted, and the bat is only being lit up from the front. Not only that, as it is just white. You don't want none of that! Das' ugleh! This might help you out. Also, take a look at this to learn what kind of color schemes you should use! Extremely helpful and I found out about it really late, so learn it now and SFM will be so much more easy down the road. Position yo camera! One neat trick (doctors hate him!) that you can do to make your scene look better is by using the Rule of Thirds. Here's a tutorial by Zach Scott, which you might know as the Saxxy winner for Bad Medicine! It's very easy to learn and once you get it, you'll see the scene getting together much more nicely. Alternatively, you can use what is know as the Golden Ratio, which guides the viewer's eyes to the focus point by using other objects as a ""path"" for the eyes to follow. Both of these make your eyes ""snap"" to the right places to look at, choose whichever you like the most! Blur yo distant things! In the camera, use the focalDistance slider to set the focus point by putting the pink square inside what you want to focus on, and then increase the aperture slider to blur it out. You'll only see the changes in the Clip Editor, so press F2 if you want to preview it, and F3/F4 to go back to the Motion/Graph Editors respectively once you're done. Don't forget to actually increase the quality, or else the background will look very ""drunk"" and duplicated! Right-click the viewport > Render Settings > Depth Of Field quality, and set it to 256 (or higher, but usually it's enough for low aperture scenes; higher than that may be unnecessary and takes longer). Post-process yo picture! Many people skip this step, which is fine, but I really recommend using something like Paint.NET, GIMP, or even Photoshop if you have it, to edit your scene. Add some contrast, bring up the blues on a cold scene or the reds on a warm scene, get some vignettes going! It adds a lot more life to a scene. Experiment different stuff, see what works and what doesn't.   And don't forget, be original! Original ideas can be crazy-good if you do them well, but if you're here to just be another loadout poster creator using stock poses all the time, then you may not get much attention.  Good luck! And have fun; remember, it's still in Beta, so crashes will happen from time to time. Don't get too frustrated and save often! Seriously, saving in SFM takes no time at all, so do it after everything you change and you will have no issues! :D"
SFM,36n478,fr3fou,2,Wed May 20 16:26:17 2015 UTC,"The posing of the character looks fine but the overall shot could use some more work in terms of lighting and fine tuning...   Adjust Camera: Nothing seems to be in focus or highlighted. The hand with the gun in it seems most important to me and it's blurry, perhaps it was a mistake, perhaps it was your choice. Either way, atleast 1 element should be in focus and high-lit to add emphasis and meaning to the shot.  Overall composition of the shot: When you make a poster, the viewer's eye should directly fall upon the main object of interest in the scene. But right now in this scene, there are too many elements to look at, which is distracting. For example, the sniper's bright and yellow max head and the kritzkreig are both very bright objects so my eye keeps wanting to look at them both. But it's confusing because neither of those are in focus and the music set is slightly more in focus. Now, I'm looking at 3 objects continuously. And then there's that hat on the left which seems very weird. It looks like it's partly inside the staircase and not resting on it, it's tilted on it's own axis.  Lighting: The lighting could use a lot more work as I mentioned before. Try setting up a studio light setup or a 3-point light setup if you wish to call it that. Play around with the colors, intensity and focus points. The slightest of changes can make a huge difference to the shot in terms of mood and overall quality itself.   Hope this helps! :)"

SFM,36dgkf,Tyrannax2000,1 point,Mon May 18 14:45:40 2015 UTC,"The main issue here is definitely the poses. Neither the spy holding his cig nor the guy holding the shotgun look like either anatomically possible or straight-up comfortable. Stand up and do the poses yourself like you'd want them to be. Hell, stand in front of the mirror. Look at how all of your body is posed, especially the arms, and replicate it. You can see that the spy's lower arm is dislocated and the guy holding the shotty has his arm way too lifted, something you wouldn't see in combat.  Alternatively, google images for drawings and references if something doesn't look right.  Also, just a tip, always pose hands. At this point, everyone knows a default, non-posed hand when they see it, like the Heavy or the guy waving at him.  Lastly, make sure your lighting matches the scene. Spotlight are behind the spy but he doesn't even have a rimlight: all of the light seems to be coming from behind the camera (excluding the map lighting). And since most of the scene is red, tinting it slightly red to achieve a ""bouncing light"" effect helps."

SFM,368fam,MasterJAD,7,Mon May 18 16:58:47 2015 UTC,"I'll try to be constructive.  Your images lok really grainy and low quality, as do the textures. I don't know what resolution you are rendering at so I'll assume it's an issue with imgur.  Your FOV is disgustingly high in every single poster. Lower it.  I love your custom poses, you put a lot of work into something most other poster makers ignore. Nice job.  I see you've lesrned to use DoF which is awesome, good on you for taking initiative and actually learning how to use a program before using it.  I dont know why, but your models and textures are very low quality. I'd look into putting them back to max.  Check out other peoples posters and learn from their mistakes, it helps a lot. :)"

I don't really know what looks good FOV wise. But I'll look into it.  Posing it what makes a poster, to me. It's the very thing that shows the viewer what emotions the subject is feeling, so I tend to stress a lot over that. I know it's not that great as is, but I'm sure I'll get better with more time.  I didn't really notice the model and texture quality, since they look similar to what's in game for me.

Select that rotation axis (x/y/z), plot down two keys (M), do a random rotation on the second key to get a rough value (to see if it is positive or negative). Then, select that key and check its number (there should be two fields just above the graph: left is frame, right is the value you want).

Do something fresh, start off with a bang, instead of starting off as another basic loadout poster creator. (I'm not saying they're bad, but they're nothing new either.) Watch Jimer Lins' Tips Of The Day, they're very useful for someone starting off, as well as Zachariah Scott's videos (mostly his Drunken Tuts). Experiment with lighting. No seriously, learn the basics of how lights work or else you'll get shot down. Rule Of Thirds. It's a basic composition rule that allows for the user to focus on what you want them to with more ease. Google it, love it. Low FoV. SFM cameras have a Lens tab that you can choose different milimeter lenses from. Default SFM camera have an extremely high FoV, making things look distorted, so drag the 50mm slider all the way to the right to get a much better look."
SFM,35puvo,9joao6,2,Tue May 12 15:13:58 2015 UTC,"Definitely this. Also,   No seriously, learn the basics of how lights work or else you'll get shot down.   I don't have a link, but I think MaxOfS2D did a very extensive look at how lighting in SFM works, including uberlights, and what each slider on lights do.   Default SFM camera have an extremely high FoV, making things look distorted, so drag the 50mm slider all the way to the right to get a much better look.   On this, I did a quick comparison of the different mm lenses in sfm for a quick comparison, if anyone is interested  On what to do first, just have fun and toy around. I would recommend working on posters first, as it's a slightly less complicated task, but the key thing is to have fun while figuring it all out. This was the first thing I ever did,"

SFM,35m5c4,Rezlier,3,Mon May 11 17:13:13 2015 UTC,"The pose isn't too bad, considering it's your third poster. One thing you may not know is you can actually make the Soldier's helmet invisible by right clicking on his model in the animation set editor (I think that's what that window is called? The one where the list of all your models shows up in after you add them to your scene), right clicking Soldier1, going to 'change bodygroups' and making the Soldier's 'helmet' bodygroup 'none'. You'll still be able to lock other models to the Soldier's helmet if it's invisible, you just won't have the helmet clipping through the other hats you may want to have him wear. It'll be how he looks in the game when you change hats.  As far as next steps for your future work, look into lighting techniques and using ambient occlusion (AO). Also, if you create an animation set for your camera, you'll have a lot of new variables to mess around with, which can really change how your posters turn out. Though, I would watch some tutorials on those before you try them out."

SFM,35m5c4,vosqueej,1 point,Mon May 11 18:32:16 2015 UTC,"Very nice to see you're experimenting. Keep it up!  The lighting in the second and third edits is better for sure- harsh white lights that are focused directly on your subject can really take someon out of enjoying a poster unless used in the right context. Softer lights are normally better, as you've done here.  Most posters really get the most bang for their buck by using multiple lights to help highlight their subjects. They don't all have to be super bright, but having a backlight and a fill light can really help make a good poster a great one. An example of how to set up three point lighting can be seen here. Lighting is my weakest skill for posters in SFM, but the way I understand it your key light should be the brightest one of the three (notice I didn't say max brightness!), your fill light should be your darkest light, and your backlight should be somewhere in between those two. I could be wrong about that though, try experimenting!  One other small thing to note, try either widening the FOV of your key light or moving it back a bit so that the Soldier's entire body is illuminated. See how his right hand is in the dark? You spent all that time posing it, you definitely want to make sure people can see it clearly!"

SFM,35h8hd,Deslonic,2,Sun May 10 10:53:34 2015 UTC,Oh the irony!  I'll keep that in mind; lighting is not my strong suit :P

SFM,35ht04,MIK136PARKS,5,Mon May 11 23:54:03 2015 UTC,Import the taunt sequence then put your playhead/play cursor at the section where he is sitting down then go to the playhead slider and put it all the way to the right
SFM,35ht04,VenaTusk,1 point,Sun May 10 17:32:24 2015 UTC,Alright. Will try it out when I get the chance.

SFM,35hoyv,uWotinFokM8,1 point,Sun May 10 15:18:37 2015 UTC,You must've messed around with the Advanced Settings on the export menu. Show us a screenshot of them please.

SFM,35h2w1,MrPeachie,1 point,Tue May 12 00:43:30 2015 UTC,"nice, but there's something kinda plastic about the lighting."

SFM,35ftdb,thatbooisaspy,1 point,Sat May 9 23:01:42 2015 UTC,Hmm... This might have something to do with the 'width' or 'edge' settings in the light properties.   Try reducing them if they're turned up?
SFM,35ftdb,_radioteque,1 point,Mon May 18 20:43:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah I already tried that, to no effect. I believe it only affect gobo textures."
SFM,35fx3f,spy2331,1 point,Sat May 9 23:36:28 2015 UTC,"Hi! It is recommended you use Imgur to host your poster albums, as the Reddit Enhancement Suite seems to deem your link as a single image only. :)"
SFM,35fx3f,9joao6,2,Sun May 10 00:15:26 2015 UTC,"I made the imgur album, http://imgur.com/a/tDHgG, do I change so the title links to that?"
SFM,35fx3f,9joao6,1 point,Sun May 10 09:20:24 2015 UTC,"If reddit allowed for such a thing that'd be great! This is just a tip for future posts, don't worry about it. Thanks for complying though, we appreciate it!"
SFM,35dym9,flamablep,2,Sat May 9 12:02:39 2015 UTC,"Nice posing.  Lighting could be better tho, more highlights etc :)"
SFM,35dym9,NSBanga8,1 point,Sat May 9 18:59:58 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback!  I've been trying to work on my posing as a milestone; I think I'll give lighting a proper go next time. :P
SFM,35fip4,Rikoray,1 point,Sat May 9 21:22:50 2015 UTC,"Hi! So my personal take on this is, if you're planning on doing animations with keyframes and all, do not use the Motion Editor. In my opinion, you can do pretty much everything so much more easily with the Graph Editor. Plus, editing stuff when you've already done some work in the Motion Editor is extremely hard and not fun at all. With the Graph Editor, you have full control of every tangent and its curves, not to mention you can still use the Jitter, Zero and Playhead presets if you choose tangents to use them on.  /u/9joao6 always recommends the Into The Graph Editor! tutorial series on YouTube, and I can definitely agree. It's a super well made ""tutorial"" (more like an explanation, really).  TL;DR: The keyframe things you want to do are in the Graph Editor. They don't seem to do much in the Motion Editor. Select a bone, move playhead, click the Add Bookmark (keyframe) button, move bone, repeat."
SFM,35fip4,uWotinFokM8,2,Sat May 9 22:23:35 2015 UTC,"Hey ! Thank you for the answer and the link, i'll check that.  I know that the keyframe are in the Graph Editor, but now  I follow the officiel tutorial and don't know how to ""save"" a movement. :(  And I want to use the Graph Editor, but there is a problem : When I try to move a model in SFM, the model become deforms, how to fix that ?"
SFM,35fip4,uWotinFokM8,1 point,Sat May 9 23:09:49 2015 UTC,"Keyframes are what save bone rotations and movement. I don't understand what you're trying to say there?  As for the deformation, that's because models that don't have a rig applied to them need to have each bone rotated, not moved. Apply the rig_biped_simple to a character if you want to move hands instead of rotating the arm to position the hand."
SFM,35fip4,uWotinFokM8,1 point,Sat May 9 23:13:59 2015 UTC,"Oh ok. It's just that in some tutoriel I saw that the guy don't touch at all at graph editor and make bone animation with Motion Editor. Why Can I rotate a arm in the motion Editor with rig_hand_R and rig_elbow_R, and not in the graph editor ? (It's just moving the hand, not the arm like in motion editor). In graph editor, i need to rotate to anime if I don't have rig, and move when I have a rig ? Sry if the question is dumb."
SFM,35fip4,uWotinFokM8,1 point,Sat May 9 23:20:41 2015 UTC,"You can't rotate an arm in any of the editors if you have a rig attached, only by moving the hands. You must've added it after testing the Motion Editor. Once again, in both editors, moving a hand when you have a rig attached moves the arms accordingly. If you don't have rigs attached, you'll always have to rotate the arms to move the hand."
SFM,35fr3k,Chester_T_Molester,3,Sat May 9 22:40:49 2015 UTC,What is wrong with the floor?
SFM,35fr3k,UnknownSouldier,2,Sun May 10 02:56:41 2015 UTC,It's supposed to be the shallow water in the intel room in ctf_sawmill. The Sapper is floating.
SFM,35fr3k,Lobot23,1 point,Sun May 10 03:08:42 2015 UTC,Oh its hard to tell
SFM,35fr3k,UnknownSouldier,6,Sun May 10 03:10:52 2015 UTC,"I think what you are trying to achieve would be easier if you used a rig.  Right click on the engi in the animation set editor and select add rig -> rig_valve_biped_simple  Also, right click on the viewport and adjust your render settings to get rid of the grainy thing."
SFM,35fr3k,Davidn14,3,Sun May 10 00:09:28 2015 UTC,"Adding to that, Engi looks kinda weird because his upper body is upright. OP should make his spine bend slightly forward for a more natural feel."
SFM,35fr3k,Julian1224,1 point,Sun May 10 01:49:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's good advice. I struggled a lot with his kneeling pose, and while it's not awful it does look kind of awkward and also unnatural. Thanks for the suggestion!"
SFM,35fr3k,Julian1224,2,Sun May 10 18:28:07 2015 UTC,"You're welcome, lad. Anytime."
SFM,35ea73,laser001,1 point,Sat May 9 14:28:05 2015 UTC,I think it would've looked better with the Demo actually behind the letterboxing. Popouts don't work for all posters and this is one of those posters.

SFM,35ch3i,TedFartass,2,Sat May 9 04:08:17 2015 UTC,"I like the movement. The camera gets a little wonky with clipping.  Something that should be suggested to all starting animators is to never start with a huge project. 2 minutes isn't necessarily 'huge' but you should try to pour more quality into shorter animations to start out with, then use what you learn to make longer animations.  It's a good start."
SFM,35ch3i,TedFartass,1 point,Sat May 9 02:04:54 2015 UTC,You're right. Right now I'm trying to think of an idea I can make that's pretty short. Thanks for the feedback
SFM,35cfct,Rikoray,1 point,Fri May 8 23:37:28 2015 UTC,"If you drag the Chell model on top of the Portal gun model in the Animation Set Editor, it'll lock every shared bone between the two models and set Chell as the parent. After that, select the Portal gun model and drag the Zero slider.  As for shooting, I think only Chell has/needs the animations to be imported, which the gun mimics by moving the same bones."
SFM,35cfct,9joao6,1 point,Fri May 8 23:54:58 2015 UTC,"Omg indeed, I lock the gun model to Chell and drag the Zero slider and it's working very well, thank a lot ! But can you explain me why ? I mean, what the Zero Slider do, and why I it take the exact good place in the Chell hands ? But thx !"
SFM,35cfct,9joao6,1 point,Sat May 9 16:11:21 2015 UTC,"The Zero slider copies the parented bone's position and rotation, and applies it to whatever you're Zeroing."
SFM,35cfct,9joao6,1 point,Sun May 10 00:14:18 2015 UTC,Oh nice ! Thanks
SFM,35cfct,9joao6,1 point,Sun May 10 01:23:35 2015 UTC,"Thank for the answer. I will try. But you speak of ""bones"" ; It work even if the model doesn't have rigs ? (I tell you what when I'll tried)  Other question : (off topic) do you know how animate things like Wheaetley, GLADOS, turrets, Atlas... ? There are such objet, I don't know how the Portal SFM make ? (Except download a premade rig)  Thank you again"
