subredditoftheday,3dllpd,Respectfullyyours,7,Fri Jul 17 06:59:14 2015 UTC,"Fun fact about monks and beer: Doppelbock was invented to serve as a ""liquid bread"" for monks to consume while fasting during Lent.  A (most likely apocryphal) story says that the brothers were worried that the beer was too indulgent to consume during fasts, so they went to ask the pope about it. They loaded a barrel onto the back of a donkey, and during the trek to Rome, the beer sloshed around and got heavily aerated. By the time it got to the pope, the doppelbock tasted like vinegar and cardboard, so he told them to go ahead and drink as much of it as they wanted."

It reminds me of a quote: ""I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time."" GRRM said something to the effect of ""You take what you've written and you re-read it, and then you throw out 99% of it except for this one part that's absolutely as perfect as it could be. You do that a few times then send it off to the editor, and then you realize that you have to throw out 99% of it all over again.""  There's a lot of stuff in a fanfic like this, and a lot of it can be thrown out, of course. It's just that it's easier to write fast and edit never than it is to prune down that into a manageable work."
subredditoftheday,3ddpkb,bitshoptyler,6,Wed Jul 15 20:57:12 2015 UTC,Yeah but a lot of these fanfics takes up to 6-7 months for even 1 short chapter to come out (i\I'm looking at you fuzzy!). its not like they're just throwing a bunch of crap out there. these stories are insanely long and written over the course of a few years.

I always had a bad taste in my mouth with earlier anime fanfics I tried to read until I heard of a fanfic that combines MLP with fallout.  At first I assumed it would be more on the MLP side of things (such as happy go luck and goofy) then the main character proved me wrong pretty quickly (the entire time during the house scene with the raiders my mind was blown).
subredditoftheday,3ddpkb,Protteus,24,Wed Jul 15 18:39:30 2015 UTC,"Fimfiction.net in general is a high step above Fanfiction.net. The advent of a featured box which bases its metrics on popularity, rating, and comment/vote frequency means that it's easier to see good fics (ignoring the fact that the box is about 1/2 crap at any given point).  On top of that is merely going to the browse and sorting by rating. Fimfiction makes it relatively easy to find the good fanfics, whereas Fanfiction.net is frankly an outdated steaming pile of horseshit.  Honestly, the MLP fanfic writing community is pretty unique among just about all other fanfic communities. Due to fimfiction.net actually judging some metric of quality, and due to the early days before fimfiction.net, when one had to have their story approved by editors on EquestriaDaily.com to get noticed, there's been a huge emphasis on quality of writing within the fandom.  I'm one of the more popular authors on the site, and up there a lot of people run into each other sooner or later. There are a lot of popular authors within the fandom who are career authors, bachelor's degree English graduates, or published in magazines/books.  The fandom's writing community is actually quite a remarkable training ground for authors."

We're always very careful when selecting our Trumen, and they go through an extensive screening process. We read through their entire backlogs. Any mention of a user being underage, having any issues with drugs/alcohol or history of mental illness immediately rules them out, as we want to avoid all this stuff.  In addition, if any of that stuff comes out during their period as Truman, we immediately transition away from them.

I explored many of the questions and thought experiments in my research phase, and nothing anyone has to say really upsets me, because I have investigated them all and have a response to everything.

From another comment:  I've done these features a lot. One thing I like to do with my features is to try to make them humorous. Now, when I took this sub I thought about making it all serious, but then I thought that that would be wrong. I thought the best way to show my respect to the community and the people was to include a joke, and that was the one I thought of. A not-so-subtle misdirect. I had quite a few people that are a part of your community look it over to make sure it wasn't too much as that was a big concern of mine. I tried to make it clear early (Breaking the internet, E! network, etc.) as a concern was brought up that it was still a little too close to home to be funny. It got to the point where I heard the joke was clear so I ready to go with the feature. Hope that clears it up."

I got that it was a joke about the Kardashians, but that ""joke"" also closely mirrored language used by oppressive bigots more interested in protecting their feelings than the lives of the oppressed. Ergo, I did not find said joke humorous.   Then when I express my displeasure with the ""poorly executed sarcasm"" I am told I didn't read the entire post [which I did], told about your intent, and told that I should be okay with this 'joke' because ""a number of trans people"" looked it over (guess what - the trans community is not a monolith).

subredditoftheday,3cjrvf,darksiderising,2,Wed Jul 8 21:57:35 2015 UTC,Care to elaborate? I guess I don't have the experience where someone makes a bad/distasteful joke and it impacts me so negatively in a lasting way that I tell them they should not have said it.   I recognize we probably have different experiences and perspectives when it comes to deprecating jokes.
subredditoftheday,3cjrvf,nohandsfootball,12,Wed Jul 8 22:08:34 2015 UTC,"Well I don't think it should've been said because it was a bad joke, as many ""bait and switch"" jokes are. It's like the boss who tells his employee they're fired, waits a few beats, then says, 'haha just kidding!' While some people may laugh it off, it's not really that funny to fuck with people's emotions, which is a bit different than fucking with their expectations. There's a nuanced line there, and unless you're 100% clear that you're doing a great job handling it - it's best to avoid it. OP has received many comments on /r/transgender that show not everyone appreciated the negativity in the intro.    The joke also doesn't work for me because a lot of people are critical of Caitlyn Jenner precisely because she is attached to the Kardashians. They claim she is doing this for the attention, that the reality TV got to her head, she's crazy, reflective of everything wrong with America, etc. They say similar things about non-famous trans people too.   Finally, given the recent backlash against the SCOTUS same-sex marriage ruling where we have so many conservatives and others complaining about how ""gay marriage is being shoved in their faces"" - the joke falls flat for me.   Maybe others wouldn't connect all those dots, but it's much easier to tell people to ""move on"" when you're not part of the group of people who are constantly oppressed and belittled, by the media, government, and society."
subredditoftheday,3cjrvf,epic93,0,Wed Jul 8 22:25:13 2015 UTC,"With due respect, it sounds to me like you're describing a situation where you just didn't like the joke. That's fine. I just don't understand your call for a retraction or chastising them for making a joke that was a very minor part of the post and seemed to be in good fun."
subredditoftheday,3cjrvf,nohandsfootball,7,Wed Jul 8 22:35:23 2015 UTC,"I don't view the joke as a minor part of the post. It takes up the entire introductory paragraph and it's a quarter of the OP's non-interview content. The rest of the piece is also somewhat problematic, in that OP focuses on Caitlyn Jenner being the reason trans people are in the news.  While that's true to some extent [in that Caitlyn is probably the most famous trans person and her celebrity is generating additional press], trans issues have been in the news for a long time. People just haven't paid attention to things like the LGB community throwing a trans inclusive ENDA under the bus, the murder and assault of trans women of color, the holding of trans people in the wrong cells, etc.   But now /r/transgender is the sub-reddit of the day thanks to Caitlyn Jenner's celebrity! So we trans folk should ignore the negativity of the intro, we should ignore that a rich white celebrity's every move is the reason people are even merely talking about us (and a large part of what people are saying about us), and we shouldn't take exception to jokes we don't like because they're ""just in good fun."""
subredditoftheday,3cjrvf,epic93,3,Thu Jul 9 03:44:22 2015 UTC,"You're right. I don't know a lot about the tans community because that is a lot of people with different thoughts and feelings to know. Every point of contention that showed how little I know was met with two sides at odds. I wrote this feature in part for the sub and in part for my sub here. I certainly didn't please you or the people that agree with you, but I pleased the others. As before, not liking me or my writing is your right, but I honestly think you are treating me like an enemy as opposed to a misinformed ally, and I think that is unfortunate.   If I am wrong, though, and you still think of me as an ally great. Hopefully we can continue from here peacefully."

subredditoftheday,3cb00v,ZadocPaet,47,Mon Jul 6 14:32:04 2015 UTC,"I really don't like it when a smaller sub gets linked on /r/bestof, because you tend to have a massive amount of upvotes that follow, but they tend to ignore things like replies that point out that the original comment is completely wrong. They also tend to favor length over quality...basically someone who sounds like they know what they're talking about, as decided by people who may only have passing familiarity with the subject.   I haven't seen that using np really does anything. All the meta subs have the same problem to various degrees. It would be really nice if reddit actually coded it so np links don't allow you to vote."
subredditoftheday,3cb00v,bamgrinus,16,Mon Jul 6 17:20:19 2015 UTC,I used to mod a sub that got hit by /r/bestof a few times when it was small. While it generally lead to chaos in that thread it was amazing for growth as many users would subscribe while they visited.  Overall kind of a net gain

subredditoftheday,3cb00v,bamgrinus,4,Mon Jul 6 17:40:32 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, you know what - I just learned it's PURELY a CSS trick and has nothing to do with Reddit.  ARE YOU SERIOUS THOUGH? I always thought Reddit admins enforced this on their end for some reason. Like even if you visited an NP link and saw the buttons they would be ""shadow votes"".  I cannot believe admins have not been more participatory in preventing brigading."
subredditoftheday,3cb00v,CrasyMike,8,Mon Jul 6 17:45:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, seriously.  Having rules against brigading and no mechanism for subs to stop it is quite silly.  I know reddit has developers, but it's really unclear to me what they work on."

The same goes for r/gaming but in a way bigger matter, what is gaming in fact?   If you like Halo you may not like Elder Scrolls aswell. So why should you be flodded with content from one topic? The same goes for things like TPP.  TPP evolved pretty fast it's own culture with own memes and stuff unrelated to pokemon too, so why should it be in the pokemon subreddit only?

For someone to write a post decrying FizzBuzz is the opposite of their view of the problem.  Likewise, Medium.com is a well respected site and OP self-submitted.

For getting every essential gameplay feature, 5 million are needed, for making it a real and extensive open world, 10 million are needed.  Sony is not funding the game as in: we pay whatever this game needs.

subredditoftheday,3alt0e,nguyen_,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:27:56 2015 UTC,"""Every (essential) gameplay feature"" is my wording; I thought it would make the difference clear: the feature aspect is about the core game(play), the open-world aspect is about the game world.  Yu Suzuki’s answer:   I will say this: if we reach the $5 mil mark, one of the things I really want to do with Shenmue 3 will become a reality.  At $10 million, it will truly have the features of an open world.      […] in what fantasy land is any sort of open world game achievable with 10mil?   I think you can even have an open world game for much less. It always depends on what exactly you understand under ""open world"" and what you want to achieve, right? I can’t find it right now, but I think Yu Suzuki said somewhere that, given a ""low"" budget, he’d prefer to make the world deep instead of huge."

I still have absolutely no idea how they plan on delivering something worthwhile with the Kickstarter budget. If Shenmue III only hit the bare 2mil target, with no outside funding, I am 100% positive we would not get much of a game at all.   People tend to greatly underestimate what it costs to develop a game. Skullgirls needed to raise 150k just to add a single character to their game. Just the legals and logistics is staggering.   Those answers from Yu Suzuki about what he can do if certain targets are met still doesn't necessarily mean that it requires that much money to do it. More like, it sounds more like those are benchmarks from Sony to commit more money, but people are saying now that Sony is only taking care of promotion for the game.  All that said, I have faith in Suzuki. I pledged immediately."

You need to know when to drop your big hitters and when to fluff an pass, the key is to have more cards, or better in general, than your opponent so you have more choices. Spies, weather and other special cards can turn the tables pretty quickly. At first you'll probably be very weak, that is until you have a better deck, composed of synergizing cards like Spies/Decoys/Medics or cards that double their strength if placed with an identical card on the table, when you'll get the hang out of it and be mostly luck and a bit of strategy."

I've been subscribed for over 2 years. It's been really dead recently relative to how active it was back then, and RES development has also slowed lately. Odd choice for sotd."
subredditoftheday,38sj8c,andytuba,2,Sat Jun 6 16:20:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, activity is definitely in a lull right now. It'll probably go crazy as soon as we get the next major release out, which has been far too long."
subredditoftheday,38sj8c,allthefoxes,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:33:19 2015 UTC,RES Development is done entirely by volunteers. It will have ups and downs
subredditoftheday,38sj8c,ares_god_not_sign,2,Sat Jun 6 16:27:38 2015 UTC,I understand and sympathize. I'm not criticizing RES or the work the volunteers do on it. I'm saying that a subreddit without a lot of activity is an odd choice for subreddit of the day.
subredditoftheday,38sj8c,allthefoxes,2,Sat Jun 6 16:32:34 2015 UTC,Gotcha
subredditoftheday,38sj8c,ares_god_not_sign,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:33:09 2015 UTC,"Nah, I just get defensive when someone threatens my babies. Haha  We actually featured them 4+ years ago. http://redd.it/hijb0 I just wanted to revisit it, and remind the masses of what a great ultility RES is.  This was basically a PSA for those who still haven't gotten on board."
subredditoftheday,38sj8c,honestbleeps,2,Sat Jun 6 16:39:40 2015 UTC,Fair enough. Nobody can argue with PSAs about RES.
subredditoftheday,38sj8c,JustLogginMyThoughts,2,Sat Jun 6 16:54:56 2015 UTC,"I'd just like to take this as an opportunity to more properly point out that /u/andytuba has shouldered an immense load while my new job has consumed pretty much all of my free time over the past 4-6 months.  I do plan to get back to doing more with RES, but Andy has done a metric crapload of work while I've been unable to, and deserves recognition for that. He has done a lot to clean up and rewrite parts of RES, and has implemented TONS of great features, bug fixes, etc."
subredditoftheday,38sj8c,blind__man,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:31:33 2015 UTC,"This is why I didn't want to assign any names to my post. I didn't know who did what and to what extent. Didn't want to offend anyone. And you shouldn't fret, you done enough to get tons of real life karma many times over."

subredditoftheday,387ztt,Lurlur,29,Tue Jun 2 14:36:04 2015 UTC,"It's a great sub.  I made a post a year or so ago, and I was judged to be the asshole.  I realized it was true, that I was an asshole in the situation.  I then made a post realizing I was an asshole, and I got a flair ""No longer an asshole.""    It's really never a circlejerk.  There's lots of different opinions."
subredditoftheday,387ztt,Diarygirl,9,Tue Jun 2 15:19:09 2015 UTC,"Interesting... I feel like its more impressive if you are deemed ""Asshole"" than not because then it means that you are an honest storyteller.  They always say ""There's his side, there's her side, and then there's the truth."", if you're able to tell a story that still paints you as the bad guy, you're probably a pretty truthful individual, right?  Anyways, neat sub... I just hope nobody takes the results too seriously either way. Seems like a fun thing rather than a definitive judgement of the situation and surrounding issues."
subredditoftheday,387ztt,LeRawxWiz,8,Tue Jun 2 15:53:14 2015 UTC,"If you read a lot of posts, you'll see that many of our commenters have a sense for when the OP is leaving something salient out.   We often ask for more info, and get it (as the sidebar requires).   Many interesting posts are decided based only on details that come out in discussion.     But yours is a valid suspicion.  This is why I think one of the most effective applications is for people to discuss arguments that began and are entirely contained on reddit.  If you link to the argument, (or show it in a screen capture), the entirety of it is there.  It has happened that we've discussed that kind of conflict, and the other party was even notified and contributed to the discussion.   Lastly, people who are interested in the answer for their issue are usually very forthcoming.  They try to tell the whole story and sometimes go on and on to achieve this."
subredditoftheday,387ztt,flignir,3,Tue Jun 2 16:12:23 2015 UTC,That's awesome. I'm glad you have so much passion about the community too! These subs are always the best while they are still small but active. Sounds like the subs in its glory days!  I'll definitely check it out.
subredditoftheday,387ztt,LeRawxWiz,10,Tue Jun 2 16:45:19 2015 UTC,I assume it's 50% /r/offmychest/ 50% /r/confessionbear/ and 100% /r/thathappened/.
subredditoftheday,387ztt,Jew_Fucker_69,4,Tue Jun 2 15:58:12 2015 UTC,"There are some of those, mostly written by clearly younger users.  But a lot of them are legitimate misunderstandings, where people aren't sure where they stand. The commenters are pretty good at teasing details out of the OP if their story sounds a bit just so."
subredditoftheday,387ztt,gwhandle,6,Wed Jun 3 01:13:51 2015 UTC,"The very concept of this subreddit seems terrible for a place like Reddit. With all the sloppy pop psychologists running rampant here trying their damdest to social engineer their fellow Redditors, one should never trust any advice regarding personal interactions."
subredditoftheday,387ztt,ivebeenhereallsummer,8,Tue Jun 2 15:30:40 2015 UTC,"Ah, but it's not advice. It's an external perspective on something that's already happened."
subredditoftheday,387ztt,ivebeenhereallsummer,2,Tue Jun 2 15:33:25 2015 UTC,I already perused the posts there. They can't help but throw in their own advice.  That subreddit is also heavily leaning towards posts regarding intimate relationships. Looking for outside opinions on relationships in Reddit is terrible idea. You are presenting a one sided and highly biased story to a crowd  with notoriously polarized views on relationships.
subredditoftheday,387ztt,iEATu23,3,Tue Jun 2 15:50:37 2015 UTC,"I briefly check out /r/relationships every once in a while to see what people are doing, lol.  And I always see people presenting their own side of the story and everyone is gushing over how unfortunate they are. But then later in the comments they start talking more and it's obvious that they have serious issues. That doesn't really make anyone on that sub to change their mind because it's basically a support thread. It's only like that for threads complaining about their significant other and how they were wronged. It's an immediate red flag, like ""oh here's another one. Are they delusional? Yep delusional, again."" There's no point even opening up those threads because you'll be downvoted if you say anything against the OP.  The difference with /r/AmItheAsshole is that it doesn't look like threads are created, subtly asking for support. And people start off to ask more questions about the person. Not only that, but the OP is coming to the subreddit to find out both sides of their own story. Although maybe you have a point. People are typing out more words including advice instead of explaining their viewpoint."
