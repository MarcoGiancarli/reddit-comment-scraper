plastidip,3e4xl3,Sawcyy,2,Wed Jul 22 00:02:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can mask off designs on top of dip, but you have to let it cure for a couple of hours before masking. Be sure to use quality tape (3m comes to mind) as much of the cheap stuff will leave a residue. The thinner the tape, the easier it is to mask off complex shapes. I would use paper for the bulk of the masking, cut out your flames and then use tape to seal the edges.  Rattle cans will work okay for the flames potentially, but I'd still recommend a gallon and sprayer. And no, one gallon is not enough for a car. Ever."

plastidip,3dmlhf,gearhead2,2,Fri Jul 17 15:26:10 2015 UTC,"If you want it glossy your best bet will probably be the TopCoat. Buy a quart of it and you can simply dip the openers in to coat them (going to back to the original ToolDip origins of the product). Because the topcoat is so thin, you'll probably have to dip them 10-12 times each to build up a good thick layer. You'll want to hang them after each dip.   If you can't get the quart, then the glossifier in cans is really your only option unless DYC is still selling clear PDS in gallons. None of these should yellow over time, but all of my dips have been pigmented so I can't verify this."

However I don't see the pieces I did as high contact points. So it should last stupid long.  The handle is on the inside of the grip so it's not like it gets directly pulled on.

plastidip,3de69e,atvking,5,Wed Jul 15 15:56:10 2015 UTC,"Not too hard. Practice makes perfect. The videos from DipYourCar on Youtube are the holy grail of dipping and technique. I'd probably remove it just to make dipping easier, plus you'll be able to get a straight shot across the trunk without worrying about overspray down the sides or something. Spoilers are awkward sometimes. Check out this subreddit's wiki. There's an article on it. White is a pain in the ass to keep clean. I vote orange if you want something that'll pop, and I think Subarus do well with bright colors."
plastidip,3dek2q,Ryan71695,3,Wed Jul 15 17:35:01 2015 UTC,You can easily do a bike in rattle cans. The pieces you're doing are smaller than a car fender so you won't really see any streaking if you take your time on it. Unfortunately I haven't been able to find a smaller sprayer to bridge the gap between rattle cans and the full size gun. Airbrushes are just too tiny.
plastidip,3dek2q,code-sloth,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:37:40 2015 UTC,"Also, buy a dip nozzle/tip from dyc that you replace on the cans, its supposed to have a better spray pattern/flow. I sprayed my rear and back bumpers and it only looks slightly bad because the wind was strong that day even though I had the truck pulled up in the garage, I didn't have it shut for ventilation purposes. But if you really can't justify rattle cans but want to save on a sprayer, buy a Wagner sprayer from lowes or amazon. I hear Amazon is doing a huge sale today only.

plastidip,3czpkr,Josephbeck17,2,Sun Jul 12 06:28:57 2015 UTC,"I think you'll have a rough time if you try to tape the bow tie.  Spray right over it and peel it when it's dry.  You can use a little blade to start it on an edge, but just peel the rest.  It will be much cleaner.  As long as there's a little edge, the dip will peel cleanly.  Just make sure you pull it AWAY from the rest of the dip, as opposed to pulling it parallel to the remaining dip.  If you're new at this and you mess it up... just spray it again.  I got the hang of this way quicker than I expected to.  Once you get a feel for the way it behaves, it should make sense.  As far as those silver parts you want to leave... It doesn't look like there's a sharp enough edge on that for a clean peeling.  Tape may be the way to go with that.  When you're using tape like that, make sure that the dip is still a little wet on the edge when you peel it.  I start by just lightly spraying near the tape for the first couple coats and then filling that part in on latter coats.  If it's too dry to peel, freshen it up with another quick coat and peel it before it dries.  If it's still a little wet, the undercoats will come off pretty easily.  I always just take the wheels off to spray them.  I would recommend that.  One more piece of unsolicited advice:  Use many (four, at the minimum) thin coats rather than a few thick ones.  Don't worry about the undercoats getting to dry to peel-- as long as the top is wet, you're good.  If you use less than four coats, peeling it will be a major pain and you're going to be busting out the goo-gone."
plastidip,3czpkr,Tercel_of_Terror,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:50:34 2015 UTC,I think you should dip just the lowered portions.
plastidip,3cxtqc,Kjgoggs,3,Sat Jul 11 19:15:36 2015 UTC,"Apply wetter, closer and fast motion coats, you have to see a wet surface to have a good finish. This happend because you applied it too far from the wheel. I did this mistake before and didn't have to start from scratch, I just applied a thicker coat on top. Try that on a small affected surface and see if you're satisfied with the end result to obviously prevent starting from scratch. Also, remember to clean the nozzle every time you apply a coat."
plastidip,3cxtqc,tehsalt,2,Sun Jul 12 04:33:04 2015 UTC,"What did you do as far as prepping the rims for dip? Also cant really tell if the dark patches are the rim showing through the dip, or if its dust thats collected on it."

They were exceptionally clean, and though I am spraying outside under a canopy in the shade I have not seen too much dust collecting on the surface between coats (every 15-25 minutes or so). The dark patches aren't the rim showing through because I had a very uniform nice gold up until the fourth coat. I suppose it could be dust, but it seemed to happen as soon as the fourth coat went on and the rims didn't look dusty before that last application"

Put on the fourth coat and all of a sudden very textured and discolored. The wheels were very clean to start, I've been spraying 6-10 inches from the wheels. First layer was very light. It looked very even and great until the fourth coat. Can I fix it? Or does it need to all come off? Planning to apply Glossifier. The only thing I can think of is that it did get pretty hot here (80+F) by the time the fourth coat went on..."
plastidip,3cxtqc,motrvatd,3,Sat Jul 11 19:18:26 2015 UTC,"If the air was dry and hot, the dip was drying before it hit the surface. You can level it with another thick but careful layer, maybe in the morning when it's cooler outside. It should liquefy the previous layer and settle things out."
plastidip,3cvujp,NismoBro,2,Sat Jul 11 05:08:44 2015 UTC,"Toss the Armor All. It's crap for whatever it touches, dipped or not. Obligatory plug for /r/Autodetailing ;)   It's possible that the tire shine stained the dip, especially if it was relatively fresh (as opposed to several days old). You can clean it then spray dip over it and it should be fine. Armor All is just greasy crap and washed off over time. Tire shine isn't quite the same. What brand was it?"
plastidip,3cvujp,code-sloth,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:21:45 2015 UTC,I wouldnt be able to tell you the brand because my buddy just sprayed it on without me knowing. but ya that armor all stuff is all crap. The tire shine seems like the same greasy texture so im hoping over time it'll just go away. even if the dip is a few days old i could put a new layer over it? or would i have to do a few more coats?
plastidip,3cvujp,code-sloth,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:47:49 2015 UTC,You could give it a few days to see if it wears off. If not you can clean it the best you can then add a light then a heavier layer to cover it.

Yeah, I get obsessive about the taping, but it makes the rest of it quick and easy when it's taped right.  The key is not to tape it all the way to the edge, so there's a little strip to peel after you strip the tape.  It makes really clean edges."

plastidip,3clu1y,code-sloth,5,Thu Jul 9 03:16:30 2015 UTC,"That's what you're supposed to do so the base layer gets a good grip and everything melds together.

Worst thing you can do is spraying dip as if it's paint and just slathering it on everything. Yikes."
plastidip,3clu1y,chrizbreck,2,Thu Jul 9 03:24:02 2015 UTC,"Aye when I was dipping around my car I would finish one round and roll right into the next because it took enough time, and it was like 100000 degrees in the sun.   45 second downtime just seemed odd to me. When I went to fast on my recent wheel job I had bubbles and all sorts in the center cap.

plastidip,3clu1y,chrizbreck,2,Thu Jul 9 03:28:12 2015 UTC,I thought about doing it that way but on the test run (on another object) it would lift the plasti dip along with the masking tapes. I think there's a sweet spot where too quick and it creates runs but too slow and it rips.

plastidip,3cm5cn,insane08,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:57:50 2015 UTC,"Hi all, Just recently discovered dipping and truly amazed something like this exists. Just bought my first car few days ago [Mazda 3] and really want to get into this. It's all black and thinking of getting white dip to achieve something similar to the image below. Excuse the horrible paint job I did but having the side of the hood / emblem and the side view mirrors all white with black car...what do you think? Would you suggest something else on a 2015 Mazda 3 sport? Also this doesn't void warranties correct?"
plastidip,3cm5cn,code-sloth,2,Wed Jul 8 23:59:34 2015 UTC,Dipping or wrapping doesn't void any warranties. I finished dipping the hatchback version of your car last weekend to look like a warplane.  This is a vector of what you seem to want when seen from the front.
plastidip,3cm5cn,PorchMonkeyMadness,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:54:07 2015 UTC,Thanks for  the vector image that looks pretty cool. I'll have to explore the colors and might even switch it out to stripes. Planning on doing this tomorrow so will report back. Thanks again
plastidip,3cm0qp,evenlynapparently,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:21:35 2015 UTC,"Because acrylic clear isn't going to lay down nicely and the thinners in it are liquefying the plastidip, then it's all drying together. That's why it looks so bad.  Don't put clear coat over dip. It may come off now, but in a few months it'll be a total bitch to remove. Just don't. Use the right product for the job."
plastidip,3cm0qp,code-sloth,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:30:02 2015 UTC,"Your point about the thinners liquefying the plastidip makes sense. But then how are others managing to get good (looking) results using clear coat?  It becoming hard to remove later on doesn’t worry me so much.  Also, the Glossifier doesn’t really seem to give the exact finish Im after and I really hope to avoid spending $30 on another can Im going to get little use from, when I already have a nearly-full can of Acrylic Clear sitting un-used."
plastidip,3cm0qp,code-sloth,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:23:48 2015 UTC,"No idea what they're doing. I'd never put clear coat over dip. Wax yes, but acrylic no.  You can get the TopCoat for a more paint-like finish but it'll never be as reflective as actual paint. If you don't mind it being permanent and you want a high gloss finish, why bother using dip in the first place? Just paint it."
plastidip,3cm0qp,chrizbreck,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:24:34 2015 UTC,"Mainly to keep the “removable” factor. By all reports, using a clear over the top of the PlastiDip makes it more difficult to remove, but not impossible.  So Im just learning now about the different types of clear coat; Lacquer and Enamel. Apparently spraying a lacquer clear over an enamel paint is a big ‘no no’. Fortunately the paint I had sprayed the lacquer clear over in the past, was an acrylic lacquer paint (rather than enamel as I stated before). (Im pretty new to the whole painting thing and am still learning the terminology)  On further research, nearly everyone who has used clear coat over PlastiDip (and actually specifies what type of clear), has used enamel clear. Im starting to think my problem is that the lacquer clear Im using reacts badly with the PlastiDip, whereas enamel clear would be ok.  My other project involves dipping a piece that I have previously painted with the acrylic lacquer paint and acrylic lacquer clear. I decided to do a test run on a spare piece of trim I had laying around. I painted it using the same method as before, which turned out great, hit it with the dip and the whole lot cracked and cannot be peeled without also pulling up the paint/clear underneath. This makes me that much surer that the lacquer clear is the culprit.  I’ll keep this updated with any further findings, just for future reference for others who might be attempting something similar!"
plastidip,3cmrl1,Detroit4g,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:57:39 2015 UTC,I think it would pop a bit more if you peeled the planet like this. You also probably need more coats. Three isn't much.
plastidip,3cmrl1,code-sloth,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:59:13 2015 UTC,Can I apply more coats as it is or do I have to re do it completely?
plastidip,3cmrl1,code-sloth,0,Thu Jul 9 03:13:54 2015 UTC,As long as it's clean you can put more coats down. I'd start kinda light then build up a heavier coat so the lower layers can liquefy slowly without causing drips.
plastidip,3cli5u,bsundell,4,Wed Jul 8 21:00:27 2015 UTC,Yes just make sure the surface is cleaned well. The new dip will bond with the old and come off as one when you remove it.
plastidip,3cli5u,lukeskywakka,3,Wed Jul 8 23:09:06 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty interesting situation,  it'd be nice to ask the previous owner if they used the proper amount of dip (1 can per rim)  because if it is too thin it won't peel well and itll be an absolute pain to peel  If it is too thin I would dip over them,  do 1 can per rim,  and hope the new dip bonds to the old dip and adds the proper thickness."
plastidip,3cglci,2vulgar,3,Tue Jul 7 19:19:19 2015 UTC,"Don't take this the wrong way but I think that Anthracite with multiple coats of glossifier on top would have been the better choice. The charcoal dip looks like... well, charcoal grill paint, flat and boring."

plastidip,3c4kye,revolttrain,2,Sun Jul 5 03:32:36 2015 UTC,I've done 6 cars outside. They all came out great. You do get a lot more fuzzies between coats and you have to be diligent in blowing off each segment before you spray to remove anything that landed between coats. I use a large car awnings with tarps around all sides.   If it's really hot or humid you're going to have a hard time getting a smooth coat.
plastidip,3c4kye,wei-long,2,Sun Jul 5 00:04:46 2015 UTC,"I've never had an issue with dipping outside. I've made sure I was away from trees or plants that drop their leaves and my results have come out well.  I've dipped rims for two friends. When these photos were taken I did the dip job on the Prelude over a year before hand, and for the S10 it was 2 or 3 days after having dipped the rims.  http://i.imgur.com/6n5IwWh.jpg http://i.imgur.com/2Wsew5E.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/tETqgtN.jpg http://i.imgur.com/y9BNMdQ.jpg"
plastidip,3c4kye,TheDovahkiinsDad,2,Sun Jul 5 11:37:56 2015 UTC,"My first 3 dips (1 - 2 - 3) were done outside and I had no issues. But there are some big issues to be aware of.  1) If it is windy, even a little, abort. Wind will make the finish uneven resulting in texture, splotchy coverage, or both.  2) If there's even a small chance of rain, abort. Water in wet dip will mess your job up, doesn't matter if you're 1% or 99% done, although the former is less costly ;)  3) Start early. Sun and heat are your enemies. This means you want to have prep done the night before, and the car parked in the garage so you don't have to wait for dew to dry.  4) Blow all dirt/dust/debris off the driveway before moving the car into place. Then wet the driveway down to further prevent dustups.  5) Keep you sprayer base out of the sun. If it gets too hot, it will blow heated air through the gun, and your dip will dry mid-air causing texture on the car and clogging the nozzle.   6) The open air will dry the coats quickly, so be fast on the tape pull after the last coat. I pulled in sections after spraying, rather than waiting until I finished the whole coat."
plastidip,3c4zqm,1-10username,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:05:17 2015 UTC,"They aren't really comparable like that. They are two different products and do two different things.  The glossifier doesn't change the color of the base coat, just changes it from matte to gloss. Gives it a bit of a sheen and smoother look.  The metalizers actually add a color to the base coat. The silver metalizer literally just adds a somewhat glitter like appearance. The final outcome depends on what color your base coat was.   It's really your opinion on what looks better, and they both probably do about the same for protection."

plastidip,3c4gus,always777,2,Sat Jul 4 18:13:17 2015 UTC,"Your coats are way too heavy. Do each line with 50% overlap of the previous line. First coat should be 10% coverage, looks like your car is just super shitty. Second coat, 25%, still should look more like the base color than the dip. Third should be to 50% coverage, starting to look more like the dip color than the base. Fourth coat should take you to 85%, barely any base coat coming through. Fifth coat should be light and take it to 95%. Sixth coat should be very light and quick. Taking you to full coverage.  Each line/pass should be done with an individual press of the trigger. Otherwise you'll get heavier coverage on the ends. Spray left to right, pause,  down for 50% overlap, right to left, pause, repeat.   Edit: especially on a small area like you say, each pass should take maybe three seconds."
plastidip,3c4gus,blazefalcon,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:28:54 2015 UTC,"how far should i hold the can from the surface? i think i was doing maybe 4-5 inches, would that explain why it ended up so heavy?"

plastidip,3c4gus,THEYCALLMEDUNN,2,Sat Jul 4 18:35:01 2015 UTC,"It's perfectly okay to use cans for small areas. Always spray in in warm environments and it's always a plus let the cans sit out where it's warm outside or in the sun for a few minutes. Shake up the cans real good. I can't remember if it says to shake for a full minute but if it does, there's a reason. Dipyourcar.com also sells an attachment for cans that helps with keeping your hands/fingers from getting sore and a replacement trigger that has a better spray pattern."

plastidip,3bym2g,SuchWastedPotential,3,Fri Jul 3 19:26:47 2015 UTC,"Avoid telling your mother that her impressions are wrong. Rather, show her how your impressions are accurate! Plasti-dip something that you have complete posession of (something other than a car, more than likely) to show her what the product is like. In specific, the peleable properties of it. I think that if she sees what dip does in person, she may be more open to the idea of putting it on a car she has major financial investments in.   Furthermore, plastidip also protects the OEM paint of the car, being that plastidip acts as a protective coating.  Above all though, don't push too much, and tell her she's wrong for not letting you do it. Won't get you anywhere good. Don't mean to be a nanny or nothin'. Just tryna help."

Ask her if you can try it on the spare tire to show how it works. Do a good job so it's a nice clean spray, then peel it when it's all dry.  If that's not an option, show her some Youtube videos of Fonzie peeling cars and wheels. Is the car used? You could spin it as being a protective layer that'll hide imperfections as well."

plastidip,3bwulr,code-sloth,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:30:32 2015 UTC,That's not too bad. You'll need a black base coat for using those pearls and that's easier to do with rattle cans. Once you have solid layers of black you can hit it with the pearls using the Preval sprayers.
plastidip,3bwulr,code-sloth,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:37:34 2015 UTC,I should be okay with leaving the rims on the car too right? I don't have a wrench of any sort and I'm not sure if just a straight old tire iron would be alright with putting a wheel back on.
plastidip,3bwulr,shakra81,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:45:34 2015 UTC,"You'll be fine, just put a plastic grocery bag over the rotors to keep your brakes clean and make sure the bag isn't touching the wheel itself, otherwise it'll stick to the wet dip.

plastidip,3bwulr,shakra81,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:48:12 2015 UTC,Buy yourself a 4 way tire iron if you don't want to spend the money on a torque wrench. They are fairly cheap and you can get more leverage to loosen and tighten bolts.

plastidip,3bazgj,DoubleSetOfTeeth,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:55:05 2015 UTC,If they're small spots I'd just clean and spot spray it. If it's seriously ripped up I'd respray them.

plastidip,3bav7x,mango-roller,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:01:34 2015 UTC,"I would wet sand all the areas with the paint chipping and then try to color match the sanded areas after priming. Unless you plan on removing the dip some day, I would guess that the paint job wouldn't have to be perfect as long as it's smooth with no runs.

plastidip,3bav7x,THEYCALLMEDUNN,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:45:23 2015 UTC,Oh that's a neat idea. Where would you want the red pieces? You could get some red pinstriping tape to do fine outlines along the edges. Shooting it black and doing the bat symbol in red wouldn't be hard.

But you can definitely tell that there are spots where I messed up. Some red is showing through in spots, bubbling, and also the damn bugs kept landing on the fairings while I was painting. So I have lots of touchups to do and I want to do red accents in the crevasses. I'm kind of liking the matte finish but originally wanted a gloss finish. I bought the glossifier for it already so I might just test it out to see what it looks like.   What's the best way to touch up the dip? should I sand it just a little or peel and completely repaint it?"

plastidip,3b7acq,code-sloth,2,Fri Jun 26 15:38:44 2015 UTC,Gloss black or aluminum wheels would be clean and subtle. I don't think you could get away with bright colors on SUV wheels unless you're going for something outrageous across the board.
plastidip,3b7acq,code-sloth,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:44:23 2015 UTC,Thanks. What do you think of the two tone being gloss black up to that bottom line?
plastidip,3b7acq,code-sloth,2,Fri Jun 26 15:45:55 2015 UTC,If you can get the TopCoat type of gloss I think it'll look pretty slick. Red on the bottom would show dirt more often and it might be a little bright with the white on the upper section.

plastidip,3b4wmi,code-sloth,3,Fri Jun 26 00:17:52 2015 UTC,I've dipped emblems and rims before but I'm thinking with such a large edge a stripe would start to peel much quicker?
plastidip,3b4wmi,amoore109,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:24:52 2015 UTC,"Did my hood with two stripes, tape everything off. Just tape the entire thing. Spray, let dry for 10 mins. 6-8 coats or so. I used glossifier because it also kinda seals everything, and gives it a little shine. 2-3 coats of that. Make sure the last coat is super heavy and take the tape off immediately, and your edge will be nice and crisp. I have shots in my post history if you want to see what I did."
plastidip,3b4wmi,code-sloth,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:14:26 2015 UTC,"No, that's not how dip works. Unless you scuff it or rub against it frequently it shouldn't start peeling."

plastidip,3b2ta7,code-sloth,3,Thu Jun 25 14:54:52 2015 UTC,"No, go by uniform coats. So if you're doing Base/Pearl/Gloss:   Roof in several layers of Base. Rest of the car in Base. Let it all dry.

plastidip,3azcgx,tuttigoo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:40:19 2015 UTC,"Either seem like they'd be fine, though the second with the adjustable nozzle sizes might be better. The dip gun has a 1.5mm nozzle if I remember correctly. The 2.6mm one seems like it'd put down way too much product at once."

plastidip,3auztl,Schnurks,9,Tue Jun 23 18:50:36 2015 UTC,Chrome looked a bit better IMO.
plastidip,3auztl,KennyOfBlok,4,Tue Jun 23 19:17:33 2015 UTC,Yeah the lights have chrome in them as well and may be throwing it off. Debating baking them open to black them out or buying another set. The chrome grill and bumpers were too much of a pain to keep clean and speckle free.
plastidip,3auztl,fullnelson13,4,Tue Jun 23 19:55:55 2015 UTC,If you wanna spend some money on the headlights you should have them retrofitting with hid projectors. I'd gladly assist you with that.

plastidip,3auztl,Jooceyjooce,2,Wed Jun 24 00:25:38 2015 UTC,The XLs have the blacked out grille and bumper but I think it's slightly different between the two parts. Think the XL has black going all the way up to the grille?  Point is yeah you're right. The chrome was just a pain. Both practically and my own taste. The lights are still off as it is. Was wondering if I shouldn't peel back both bars in the grille back to chrome to tie them in more?
plastidip,3auztl,damnyou777,2,Wed Jun 24 00:37:41 2015 UTC,"I think leaving the bars undipped would look better, as would not blacking out the emblem. I like the look of an emblem being blacked out if you can still see the brand, like a Lexus or Honda, but the Ford Emblem should be left alone IMO. You're just left with a black oval in back. It looks blank."

plastidip,3ax4zr,josvan84,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:43:24 2015 UTC,"Sorry I'm late to the party but I just saw this post.  This can happen with a spray gun or rattle can.  3 things have caused this texturing for me in the past (I use gallons not rattle cans).    1)The dip was improperly thinned and is coming out too thick.    2)You are spraying too far away from the vehicle and it is drying before making contact with the surface.    3)The air temp/humidity is causing it to dry before it reaches the surface.   Then only way I have found to fix this without peeling is:  1)Get some Xylol/Xylene and a few foam rubber rollers.  2)Dip the roller in the Xylene, make sure it is covered but NOT dripping, ring it out if needed.  3)Slowly and gently drag, dont roll, the roller across the textured surface until texturing is level.  4)Spray a new coat over the fixed area.  Please not this is a pretty involved process, and is better for small fixes than large areas, but can fix a large area if done properly.  Personally I would just peel it and re-dip it, just remember you won't cover up texturing with more coats, you will just make the texturing more noticeable, hope this helps."
plastidip,3ax4zr,jld420,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:34:51 2015 UTC,Thanks for the replies. Im going to try the xylol and a roller to fix it this weekend. If that doesn't work I'll peel it and spray it again using your guy's tips. Thanks again for the help.

You obviously have the tools to take one off at a time (and if you don't you should seriously buy a jack and lug wrench, not just for this project but in case you ever get a flat). Taking one off at a time, you can still complete it in an afternoon. Hell, you could dip one wheel per day for 4 days and there would be no difference in the way they looked as long as you used the same methods.  Also, no problem on the lugs. When you take a wheel off, just set the lugs aside. It will look better with them undipped anyway."

plastidip,3avzje,code-sloth,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:16:35 2015 UTC,You can do them while they're on the car. Just put a bag behind the wheel to cover the brakes and index/playing cards against the edge of the wheel and tire.

Dirt or water causes dip to look funky. It could be that the cans weren't shaken up enough.  What color were you spraying?

plastidip,3at3qm,dvargas1123,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:55:33 2015 UTC,"1 can per wheel and 4 for the hood (roughly a quart). So 8.  Clean the wheels thoroughly, and dry them even more thoroughly.  Sand the edges of the clear coat until you can't feel the transitions anymore. Once the surface is smooth, clean and dry it. Then you can dip.  NOTE - I do not recommend dipping horizontal surfaces like hoods and roofs with cans. They are not designed to spray that way and they have a small fan, you are very likely to get stripes and drips. If at all possible, remove the hood and spray it upright."

plastidip,3aqg31,tbare91,3,Mon Jun 22 18:06:20 2015 UTC,I wouldn't do it in direct sunlight if you have the option not to. Pretty sure it says not to. You can also try making sure the can is far enough away. I was to close and ended up with that texture on my first dip.
plastidip,3aqg31,kelsofb,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:14:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, peeling and re-spraying is a way better idea. Also, how many coats did you do? If you do too few it can cause it to show up this way."
plastidip,3aqg31,kelsofb,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:11:03 2015 UTC,6 coats. But now that I think about it they weren't super heavy. I just read some where that my first couple coats should be lighter  then do longer sprays for heavier coats
plastidip,3aqg31,LT_BrownSnout,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:23:19 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's exactly how you should do it. The first 2 I usually make very faint, just enough to show a little color. Then the remaining coats I make a little heavier until it's complete. Good luck on the next round."
plastidip,3aqg31,Alias052443,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:48:34 2015 UTC,"6?! No. You don't need six coats for really any dip project. 1st coat fast but cover, 2nd slow and full, 3rd coat to finalize. 20 minutes between a coat. Done"
plastidip,3aq9bo,maketroli,3,Mon Jun 22 17:03:11 2015 UTC,Gasoline will dissolve and discolor dip because it acts as a solvent. You can use paint thinner like xylene or naphtha. Most hardware stores should carry them.

I did the hood one day, a few days later, the trunk, then I got fed up with waiting and I did the whole rest of the car. I think it was somewhere like 2 or 2 1/2 gallons, I used the dip from home depot and I thinned it myself"

plastidip,3adl9s,code-sloth,2,Fri Jun 19 12:16:46 2015 UTC,It also depends how heavy you load the clear carrier with the balloon pearls. Color matching the base to the pearl will make it more vibrant and require less pearl for the same effect/coverage.
plastidip,3adl9s,timewasterextreme,2,Fri Jun 19 12:20:42 2015 UTC,"In most cases, its definitely going to end you in some shade of gray or silver. I saw a Mercedes not too long ago with ballon white over gunmetal gray and while I think you could see the pearl more easily, it did appear more like silver, rather than white.

plastidip,39um2f,superboots,5,Sun Jun 14 22:36:46 2015 UTC,"I bought 3 cans of Electric Lime Green from the Full Spectrum colors that aren't supposed to fade in the sun.  I cleaned the wheels very thoroughly by spraying simple green directly onto them and then scrubbing with a rag, used more simple green with a toothbrush to get tough spots and angles, then rinsed well with water and dried with an air compressor.  Things I'll do differently next time:  Buy more than 1.5 cans per motorcycle wheel, there were a lot of weird angles and tough spots for me to get, I wish I would have bought 5 cans minimum.  I used dip release on my sidewalls, I wish I had actually put the tape down against the sidewall though instead of leaving it hovering over it (you can see what I'm talking about in one of the album pictures), it made it so there was some dip under the tape but not enough to easily peel off.  I think putting a bolt through the axle hole in the tires and suspending them vertically while painting them would have made it a bit easier, laying them down wasn't too bad though.  Don't bump the rim with the plastidip can while trying to get hard to get places.  Go lighter for the first coat, very light. I had a couple small runs.  Keep your grubby hands off the wheels when putting them back on the motorcycle, after getting them all dirty I finally came to my senses and wrapped some shop towels around the wheel and tire and put tape around it to hold it on, then I could grab it without worrying about getting black grease all over the new plastidip.  The finish isn't very smooth in a lot of places, I think it's a combination of me not doing a heavy enough final coat because I was running out of dip, using the last bit of dip in the can which seems to come out a little rougher, and not keeping the cans warm enough.

plastidip,39um2f,EastPhilly,2,Sun Jun 14 22:49:37 2015 UTC,"Looks great. I was thinking about doing this at some point. But I love the grey/blue of the fz so I want mine to look like that.  Edit: I'm surprised it took more that 1 can per wheel. Car wheels typical are 1 per, but I guess you only really need to dip one side of them."
plastidip,39um2f,BaggedTaco,2,Sun Jun 14 23:37:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Yeah, I thought I was smart thinking car wheels are typically 1 can, but I have to do both sides, I'll get an extra can to be safe. In reality It's both sides, plus when you're spraying the spokes a lot of the spray is actually going past them, probably only 25% of it is hitting the spoke. I think it's more surface area than a car wheel plus less dip actually making it onto the wheel = you're going to need at least 2 cans per motorcycle wheel, I'll be ordering at least 5 next time."

Remove this you will find torque screws, the ""real"" star pattern. Go ahead and unscrew those, don't worry, they are made so they don't fall out.

plastidip,39qgkl,mango-roller,5,Sat Jun 13 21:51:31 2015 UTC,Not everyone had that option. If I were to do my wheels it's either one off at a time or all on the car. Living in a city makes doing most work in a car very hard. It took me double the time to each and wax the side of my car facing the street than the side facing the sidewalk.
plastidip,39qgkl,EastPhilly,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:15:29 2015 UTC,as we here in norway have two sets of wheels (summer and winter) its easy to just mount the other set while working in the garage :)
plastidip,39qgkl,lqskins,3,Sun Jun 14 17:20:40 2015 UTC,There is no real reason to take them off the car unless you intend on doing more than just the face. It's just a matter of personal preference.

plastidip,39m8rp,maketroli,4,Fri Jun 12 18:53:46 2015 UTC,lawn guys came and started mowing while I was spraying in the garage.
plastidip,39m8rp,ggrillo,3,Sat Jun 13 13:54:11 2015 UTC,Water.... I dipped my car after a rain storm. I dried it thoroughly (i thought)but once I started spraying water trickled from the housing on the fog lights and tail lights and bubbled the dip. I also had a few drops of sweat fall from my arm when spraying the roof. I did the thinner technique on the finger to fix that.
plastidip,39m8rp,cupcake9,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:07:35 2015 UTC,"good to know, then the car should be completely dry."
plastidip,39m8rp,mr_burnzz,3,Fri Jun 12 19:46:11 2015 UTC,"The main thing to worry about is dust and other contaminants. Your work space should be very clean so when you're spraying, shit isn't flying around. I'm thinking of making a kill room like Dexter because it's so hard to make sure they're isn't any dust and crap.  Another thing which is my opinion is that applying a top coat with flakes doesn't look good if your car is old."
plastidip,39m8rp,chrizbreck,3,Sat Jun 13 00:36:25 2015 UTC,Pulling the tape.   I knew you need to do the last coat heavy and pull it quick but I didn't understand how quick. I did my last really heavy coat all around the base of the car then went to peel and it was already wayyyy too late.  It needs to be spray and pull.
plastidip,39m8rp,chrizbreck,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:59:47 2015 UTC,"sorry, I did not get you, you mean: the last coat should be heavy, once you finish the last coat, you should pull it out fast ? what do you mean by pull ? maybe you mean peel it off fast ? how fast ? I am not clear with it."
plastidip,39m8rp,It_Was_Lag,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:36:09 2015 UTC,Sorry. You should put that last coat on heavy and while it is still very wet pull the tape. Don't give it any drying time. That will help get a clean line.
plastidip,39m8rp,It_Was_Lag,2,Sat Jun 13 21:05:15 2015 UTC,"Are you using a spray gun or cans? Don't. Avoid using cans, I learned the hard way.  When you're painting, spray the same way for every coat. i.e. On the roof; paint from the front windshield to the back windshield (using pull-push method or whatever it's called), Don't try to go from the passenger side > Drivers side.   Crossing the pattern makes it look weird.  No idea if that makes sense at all, but I hope it does."

plastidip,39m8rp,Topikk,2,Sat Jun 13 20:38:39 2015 UTC,Me and my fiancé dipped in our garage the first time. It was good weather but springtime means there's shit floating around in the air. We're going to have fans blowing air out of the garage next time so it doesn't land in the wet dip and cause little specks and imperfections in the dip.
plastidip,39m8rp,Topikk,2,Tue Jun 16 15:41:58 2015 UTC,"Trying to dip my spoiler in cold temps  I live in MI and it was getting late (some point last yr), temps were dropping.

plastidip,39m8rp,tbare91,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:54:15 2015 UTC,"The first time I tried doing hard tape lines, my failure was two-fold:  First, I didn't make my last coat heavy enough for the thinner to re-liquify the previous coats. Secondly, I waited about two minutes before peeling the tape off.  The results were awful, and required a complete peel and reapplication."
plastidip,39m8rp,gougs06,0,Fri Jun 12 19:27:43 2015 UTC,"so, in every single coat, the amount of Plasti Dip I must apply, should be heavier ? lets say: 1st coat: soft, 2nd coat: heavy, 3rd coat: heavy++ ? and you said you wait only 2 minutes, how many minutes should I wait ?"
plastidip,39m8rp,tbare91,2,Fri Jun 12 19:45:40 2015 UTC,"I use Fonzie's latest instructions for coat thickness, regardless of what I'm dipping, and it seems to work very well.  The first two rounds are tack coats, meaning dry, and only shooting for ~50% opacity.  Every coat after that is a wet coat, but not so heavy that it drips (this kills the dip job).  If you're doing hard tape lines, such as racing stripes (or anywhere else where the tape line will be the final edge of the dip), make the last coat very heavy, and start peeling the tape almost immediately while it is still liquefied.  It starts drying quickly, and your line will get gnarled."

The dip bridged that gap. So I ended up having it pull up. If I were to do it again I would take a tooth pick and immediately after a coat run it through and break those gaps to get the edges cleaner. It was my first dip, but I had fun and the stuff is forgiving."

plastidip,394d5p,Foreigncarwhipper,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:18:40 2015 UTC,"well the bigest issue is your spray fan size. Cans just dont compare to guns, that is why a gun is recomended, among other reasons.   To best help you. 50% overlaps, each pass, the Can won't want to spray if you hold it parallel to the roof, but you will get texture if you hold it at say a 45 degree angle (again, where guns benefit users)   to make dip smooth you want to have your last coat/s wet. this means dont make it run, but when you go look at your roof after applying the last coat it should be all wet and shiny still. you do this by 50% overlaps and taking it slow, then maybe maybe maybe going back to the 1st side and re-wetting it so it dries level.   in the end, its hard to do with cans and its why it isnt recomended, but you certinly can do it, if you understand what i am saying and put it into use you should have a good end product!"

plastidip,394d5p,timewasterextreme,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:23:56 2015 UTC,"You'll get this striping if you aren't holding the nozzle of the can perpendicular to the surface you are spraying. Imagine this line | is the roof of your car.  If your spray pattern comes out like this | then you will have a heavier stripe at the bottom of the spray fan, meaning that point of the fan was closer to the surface. likewise, if it looks like this /| then the top of the fan was too close.   another problem is if all of your coats start at the same place and have the same overlap, you'll get the same striping.  I like to lay coats down alternating pattern, left-right/top-bottom, starting on different sides of the car each time to reduce this issue.  Even on vertical surfaces, like doors, it can happen. THis is especially evident in the pearl/metal flake where the ""pigment"" isn't entirely uniform. You'll get obnoxious striping through the clear coat.  You can try spraying a light coat of naptha or mineral spirits over the roof first and see if that helps smooth out any built up texture you may have developed.  Good luck."
plastidip,394d5p,timewasterextreme,2,Tue Jun 9 19:29:08 2015 UTC,Thank you! The whole fan angle stuff makes perfect sense that if part of the fan is too close then it will lay down heavier dip and stripe. This is really helpful. I appreciate it!

plastidip,38x0n8,SuperJimmyK,3,Sun Jun 7 19:41:21 2015 UTC,Could I ask you and /u/Harmonic_Content how you guys pulled off the look?  I have an 04 WRX wagon I wanna do the spiderman theme for and am having trouble figuring out how I wanna do the webbing/spider logo.
plastidip,38x0n8,EconamWRX,2,Fri Jun 26 19:36:42 2015 UTC,I did simular as /u/Harmonic_Content. Just a base of black under the Sapphire Blue but I used the aluminum plasti dip with 4 red tints into it as a base before I applied the Red pearl. As for the webbing I used a sharpie and free handed it. And the spider symbol I experimented with something called frisket paper. It's a low tach clear plastic that can be laid over your dip then I used a little portable projector I had to project an image into it and then an exacto knife to cut out the symbol. Then just taped things off so I didn't get over spray and sprayed it on.
plastidip,38x0n8,SuperJimmyK,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:48:56 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! The first step was the base coats, the red on the bonnet and black on the boot, then I let that cure for a week. If you do red, learn from my mistakes, and use a base coat like gray before the red. The red has terrible coverage, so a neutral solid base will help the red cover, and you won't have to use as much.   The next weekend, I used 1/4 inch pinstriping tape for the webbing, it was super cheap and I thought it would be much easier than taping off over the dip to spray more dip. It was super tedious, and took hours, but I still stand by my thought that it was better overall for my skills. The logos were from a graphics guy that sells decals on Amazon. I chose those because he was willing to work with me and ship them same day so I would get them in time for my install. He was great to work with, and loved the final product (he asked for pictures).   The striping was the toughest part for me, but going slow and steady won out in the end."

plastidip,38vo3p,timewasterextreme,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:23:24 2015 UTC,Did it in the drive way. Took all day to do the truck and a Honda fit. Both were already cleaned and the truck was masked while we dipped the fit. I used the DYC pro kit sprayer for all of my dips.   Figure 5 gallons for a truck and you can pull the price off their website. I also bought during a 20 % off sale.   People spray brake calipers all the time and those get hotter than my truck ever could. They are also one of the dirtiest parts of a car and it seems to stick well there.   Before I peeled it we went off roading through some thick brush and it didn't even tear the dip.

plastidip,38uu3d,code-sloth,0,Sun Jun 7 01:33:38 2015 UTC,You have to remove any masking that's touching the dip while it's still wet otherwise it'll bond to both surfaces and rip instead of letting go.

plastidip,38uu3d,LukePilot152,2,Sun Jun 7 15:32:39 2015 UTC,Reason it's such a common mistake is because most of the tutorial vids on YT don't actually tell you to do this - just switches straight from applying the dip to peeling the tape.

plastidip,38uref,g00f,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:33:34 2015 UTC,The main reason I got it was so i could take it with me when i moved. Never had any issues of disconnecting or bunching up. Looks really nice at first then gets dirty. I need to pick up everything off the floor to pressure wash it but the cutouts or whatever they are called work great and water just flows out of the garage after. I didn't want to do the epoxy since i couldnt find one that was diy friendly that would last. I dont want to have to redo it every few years.
plastidip,38uref,g00f,0,Sun Jun 7 14:03:42 2015 UTC,Personally I epoxied my floor and it cost about 1500 cad but I love it and Driving on it all winter with salt on the roads didn't do a thing to it. It was called enviro epoxy and I did  it in a closed garage en never got so much as light headed strong and safe to use
plastidip,38uref,Andrewiovanna,2,Sun Jun 7 02:23:42 2015 UTC,"Floor coatings are tricky.  You can't just use any old paint on a floor cause you have to deal with weight, stains, and in a garage, hot tire pickup.  Basically when you have hot rubber pressed down on a painted garage floor from your large car, the paint will adhere and lift up with the wheels.  I'm assuming that since plastidip can peel so easily off a dipped surface it wont hold up against tire weight.  I worked at a Benjamin Moore retailer for a couple years until recently, there's a few decent concrete products in their corotech line that should do the trick."

You need a lot more cans than just three for each panel. The rattle cans lay down a much thinner coat than a proper gun does, which is why you're not getting a very good finish. Cans are for small things.  I'm pretty sure the Double Duty is close to what DYC used to sell before they created the dip gun. It was okay and did its job. I prefer the dip gun but I only do dip and not paints.  I think it'll mostly matter what tip you can get for the gun you choose. Dip is very thick compared to most paints so you'll want a 1.5mm to 1.8mm tip otherwise it could choke."
plastidip,38od4h,code-sloth,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:09:10 2015 UTC,"My main issue is that I can either spray the cans farther away and get a ""uniform"" finish - but it all feels like peach fuzz and attracts dirt/pollen VERY quick. The other option is to spray closer for the smooth finish, but because the spray pattern on the cans is so narrow it'll come out streaky (even when trying a 50% overlap, it's a real pain)   Are the tips on the Wagner models interchangeable or adjustable? I've read about preferred tip sizes for dip but it's one of the subjects I'd like to learn more about. Thank you for your help."
plastidip,38od4h,code-sloth,2,Fri Jun 5 15:46:00 2015 UTC,"The little red nozzles you can get for the cans help a bit, but they hurt to spray after a while. Your fingers get sore.  The FAQ on the Wagner site answers the tip question:    What size nozzle comes on the Control Spray Max?   The size of the nozzle on an HVLP sprayer like the Control Spray Max is not measured the same way as an airless sprayer spray tip would be. With this type of HVLP sprayer, the nozzle is a standard size and you will change the thickness/viscosity of the material you plan to spray by following the chart in the manual. This allows a single nozzle to spray a variety of materials.   You'd have to thin the material you're using based on its viscosity rather than changing the tip.  IF you want to use the gun for multiple types of materials, an Earlex 3500 used to be the crown jewel for dipping and has more durability than the lower end Wagners that DYC used to sell. It's a little more pricey but you may be able to find it on clearance somewhere."
plastidip,38od4h,absntmindedprofessor,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:01:11 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting design, thanks for the info. I was briefly looking into the Earlex and the modern DYC sprayer that they sell (I think Earlex makes that too?) but the 3500 seems hard to find and I worry the DYC sprayer wont work well with enamel paints since it was made with plasti dip in mind. It is an awesome design though after watching the video on it. I think I'm gonna go ahead and roll with the Spray Max, thanks again for your help. I also checked out your xB, good luck on that it looks sweet so far!"

plastidip,38gmr5,thedeepfriedboot,14,Thu Jun 4 02:04:28 2015 UTC,"Hey everyone.  So, thanks to the post by /u/code-sloth here months ago, I have been playing with the idea of turning my Suburban into a SHIELD response vehicle. As summer approached and ComicCon season came upon us (this was my first big con), a few friends and I finally made it happen. The gallery attached is what a month of hard work, obsession, and a bit of disposable income became. We made lots of little mistakes along the way, but overall, we think things turned out great. We have had a lot of good feedback so far, including from the Tucson Highway Patrol. At a red light, the officer motioned us to roll down the windows. We thought we were in trouble, but it turns out he thought it was awesome and wanted a picture!   Here is a video of the truck at the Con with the front strobes running and the PA system playing the SHIELD theme song (sounds crappy due to camera mic being overloaded by concert down the road).  Here is a walk-around video of the truck (not all of the 3D printed center caps are installed)  Finally, here is the truck playing the Godzilla roar in our hotels parking lot over the PA system. It sounded amazing reverberating through the parking complex. We played it after someone shouted ""Hail Hydra"" at us.  Anyway, with Phonenix Comic Con over, the truck is now back in Tucson with me. I cannot wait until the Tucson Comic Con to show it off at again. Anyone know anywhere else I should take it?"
plastidip,38gmr5,code-sloth,5,Thu Jun 4 02:11:59 2015 UTC,You'll get attention on the highway with it. You have the front gear too so don't be surprised if people start moving out of lanes for you. It's fun as hell to daily a SHIELD vehicle.
plastidip,38gmr5,code-sloth,8,Thu Jun 4 02:27:49 2015 UTC,"Oh, ya, trust me, I have been seeing that happen. There are four types of people we have encountered:  1) People who know of SHIELD, and love the truck, and start freaking out and giving us thumbs up, want to take pictures, ect...   2) People who see the truck, and give us disapproving looks as if ""Seriously guys? Grow up!"". (We just started flailing around to music in the car while staring directly at them in response)  3) People who think we are cops or work for the government. They usually slow down or change lanes.   4) There was one case where someone got angry, tried to honk as us (he was hitting his steering wheel, but the horns seemed to not work), and was shouting at us from in his car. We have no clue what was going on with that person. Perhaps he was upset that he thought we were cops?"
plastidip,38gmr5,code-sloth,11,Thu Jun 4 02:39:46 2015 UTC,"Most people are 1 or 3. I figure if someone can recognize SHIELD enough to be part of 2, they have no room to scoff at nerdy people. Kids freak the fuck out over it and coworkers at my current job (programmer - we're all nerdy as fuck) were in love with it.  I worked a federal job for a little while last year in a secured building and had a fun reaction. I pulled up front to run in some paperwork and left the xB idling in the fire lane (yeah yeah, bad - but I was 20 ft away). The lot cam security guy caught it and started panicking thinking that there was a department visit of some kind because it looked like a government vehicle. He ran out to the front desk and asked me ""What branch are you from?""  ""Uh...I'm in <low clearance section>.""  ""Wait, what?""  ""I work in <low clearance section>. What's wrong?""  ""But your car has a department logo on it. You're not here for an inspection?""  His coworker looked over my shoulder, saw the xB outside, and busted up laughing. ""You idiot that's from the Avengers movie. SHIELD isn't real."""
plastidip,38gmr5,code-sloth,7,Thu Jun 4 02:52:32 2015 UTC,"Ha! That is great. At one of the client sites I work at people have been taking pictures of it and were freaking out a bit as well. I also took the truck to the dealership today to check on my other car (in for warranty repair) and the service advisers were having fun with the lights and PA system on the truck. They were shouting at their coworkers over the PA system. When people recognize the vehicles, they certainly do seem to get a lot of amusement out of them."

You're right that the opening is really narrow and I'd be concerned about how the spray would get onto the sides evenly. You'd be spraying across them instead of at them, if that makes sense.  Dip is cheap though, so you can pick up a can for 6-8 bucks and give it a try. Maybe if you turn the can toward the inside wall as you're spraying it, the stream will go where it needs to."

The can recommends naphtha with either toluene or Xylene to remove the dip. They are used to remove latex based paint so they should not mess it up, I am not an expert though. You should be able to find it at like a home depot or something similar where they sell latex based paint. Though if your clear coat is pealing off you would need to repaint the wheel any ways to fix it.  ?  So it would seem"

plastidip,382ds1,wickedchowda,3,Mon Jun 1 15:25:09 2015 UTC,"Glad I could help.   Here's another tip:  In the DIPYOURCAR YouTube videos, you always see Fonzie go light on his coats and that might be perfect for a humid climate but if you're dipping in a dryer climate like summer time in Arizona, you have to lay it on THICK. Like you almost want it to run kind of thick.   So keep that in mind when you dip. If it's humid, light coats are ok. If it's super dry, go heavier otherwise it dries before it can fully bond and self-level."

If your going tohave both camo green and black visable then remember to let the black cure for about an hour before you put down any tape lines on it, then peel that tape line when the last coat is wet"
plastidip,37rfgm,Manicaeks,2,Fri May 29 20:05:19 2015 UTC,"Just curious why you got the clear and the topcoat? What kind of end result are you hoping for? Matte, satin, glossy? The clear won't come out as good as the topcoat will. I'd suggest buying more topcoat, not use the clear, and if you want a satin finish once you're done spraying the pearls mixed in with the topcoat you'll be set. If you want a gloss finish you'll want some extra to spray at least three coats of topcoat only for a high gloss finish.  The topcoat is thinner than regular dip and you need to spray wet coats, but you need to be careful not to spray too wet otherwise you'll get the runs. It's easy to get runs with the topcoat with and without pearls.  If you haven't watched the DYC Complete Guide I would give yourself some time to watch it and probably a couple of the other videos where they do pearls just to see how it's done."
plastidip,37rfgm,mikron2,3,Fri May 29 20:34:12 2015 UTC,I used 50/50 of matte clear and glossifier. It came out beautifully with the pearls.
plastidip,37rfgm,slapstix,2,Sat May 30 01:25:16 2015 UTC,"I don't doubt it at all, and 50/50 matte clear/topcoat would probably come out really well too. To me the topcoat is miles ahead better than the clear and glossifier from my experience so I wouldn't use anything else for pearls or gloss anymore, but that's not saying that mixing glossifier/matte clear or matte clear/topcoat won't give great results too. That's just me though, neither way is right or wrong, and having so many ways of accomplishing the same thing is what makes it fun."

plastidip,37rfgm,slapstix,2,Sun May 31 18:43:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I read that satin looks good with pearl and that its a 50/50 mix of topcoat + matte clear. Is this wrong information? If I do the satin mix, should I still do 3 layers of top coat on top?"
plastidip,37rfgm,mikron2,2,Fri May 29 20:55:32 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard the 50/50 mix of matte clear but it doesn't mean it won't work. If you want satin for sure, you do not need to spray the three coats of the topcoat only, that will give you a glossy finish.  Here is an example of pearls mixed in the topcoat only that they didn't spray the topcoat only afterwards and it's got a nice satin finish.  Just from my experience if you want a true satin pearl finish, I'd go the topcoat only route. While I haven't mixed the matte clear and topcoat, I'm guessing it would end up with a result closer to matte than satin, and it may affect how it feels afterwards too. The topcoat feels like clear coat especially with the Blou Dip Mist or DipCoat applied after, and the matte clear may reduce that result."

Tape off and/or cover your fender, brake rotor, and caliper (don't do what I did and forget the rotor, dip will dry and glue it in place, making it pop when you drive and scaring you shitless), and spray.   Remember, 50% or more transparent the first coat. Do several coats, the rims get a lot of abuse. I recommend glossifier after 4 or 5 coats. Really didn't care for matte rims after a couple days. They just look terrible when they get dirty.   Good luck!"

plastidip,37n4zr,code-sloth,2,Thu May 28 22:06:56 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. So you'd want the joints to be bare while the tubes are dipped?  You could actually cheat with how you tape them off. One narrow strip of tape around each tube where it goes into the lug, spray your dip, then peel the tape when it's wet. You'll have a gap between the tubes and lugs so when it's all dry you can peel the lugs."
plastidip,37oonz,DrProfScience,1 point,Fri May 29 04:54:20 2015 UTC,"You can get glossifiers to spray on top to look like a shiny paint job.  Would recommend a hand wash and then use a wax and grease remover, ideally in a garage so there is less dust on the car afterwards.  If you are a quick learner, then you should catch onto it quick, but I would still buy extra dip in case you have to redo a panel. Headlights are fine to leave off, as you can just peel those however I would suggest taping windows and headlights anyways. Also make sure to remove the tape when the dip is wet for nice lines and so you don't pull the dip up  Not that I can think of now"
plastidip,37oonz,R3411y,1 point,Fri May 29 12:21:33 2015 UTC,"Yep, you'd spray it like any other dip. Glossifier and the super glossy TopCoat are much thinner though, so you might want to practice on a hood or something to get a feel for them."
plastidip,37oonz,code-sloth,1 point,Fri May 29 13:01:53 2015 UTC,"You don't want to be too light or too heavy with the glossifier, it requires a slightly different spray technique.

plastidip,37c979,Joshua_dun,2,Tue May 26 15:51:24 2015 UTC,"Well, you can get some goo gone, wwd40 or dip dissolver and go to town scrubbing it.  Personally, I'd take it off, soak it in one of the above and go to town on it with a pressure washer.  That said, I have no idea if any/all of those are safe for a firearm finish, though I suspect it's tough enough for all 3."
plastidip,37c979,lqskins,1 point,Tue May 26 17:24:54 2015 UTC,"Easiest way would be to remove the handguard.  If you can't peel it after you remove the guard, you can use WD-40. The WD-40 shouldn't mess with your finish as long as you clean the guard after you're done."

plastidip,37961g,ngaaih,2,Tue Jun 2 01:50:21 2015 UTC,looks like you had the same problems I had when painting a bike.  it's so hard to apply a consistent coat.
plastidip,37961g,tagrav,1 point,Mon May 25 22:19:48 2015 UTC,Yes I did but I like the way it looks! This was really a test run for future paint jobs

plastidip,378xlb,SouperButtz,2,Mon May 25 23:38:05 2015 UTC,Could be that prices differ depending on locale. Or perhaps you were looking at a standard color?

plastidip,3795s4,smelllikespirit,1 point,Wed May 27 01:22:00 2015 UTC,4 identical rims that i bought at different tire places   Holy shit!
plastidip,3795s4,mango-roller,1 point,Wed May 27 02:44:00 2015 UTC,Yeah i bought one once during an emergency because i got a flat with the bent 18 in rims that came with the car when i bought it. Kept getting flats after repairing the rims so i decided to go look for the other 3 to complete the set. They are pretty standard looking rims. They look identical except two are missing wheel caps so I cant say they are the same brand but they do sure look exactly the same.

plastidip,375wkc,LesaneCrooks,2,Mon May 25 08:08:57 2015 UTC,Xylene is a paint thinner. All I did was put some in my gun and did a very light coat across the whole car. It things and 'melts' the paint down to create a much smoother and glossier effect.
plastidip,375wkc,MightyBulger,3,Mon May 25 22:26:18 2015 UTC,Wear heavy duty gloves and a respirator. Xylene is no joke.

Door jambs will require masking. Most likely the dip will be dry by the time you get around to opening the doors and taking the tape off, so with a qtip or with some gloves on, sparingly apply some thinner along the seam of the dip and the tape as you are removing the tape.   Final results give you something like this: http://i.imgur.com/lWLJkwI.jpg"

plastidip,36w6lx,davros_,1 point,Sat May 23 00:11:08 2015 UTC,They are bumper quick releases.  Drifters use them to quickly remove and attach bumpers. Stance guys like myself use them to hold bumpers on after they've removed the joining brackets/hardware in the wheel wells so that we can stuff our wheels and tires in there without rubbing.

plastidip,36wtpc,PeteFord,2,Fri May 22 19:45:46 2015 UTC,"Yes you can mask things to get a two tone line or do stripes. Use blue painters tape and pull it off carefully while the final coat of dip is wet so the dip won't dry and cling to the tape.  In general you don't have to do a lot of prep work with dipping. I don't mask my headlights, tail lights, fog lights, or door handles. The only parts I mask and cover are the wheels and tires, windows, and windshield/wipers. i take my license plates off so I don't have an ugly rectangle on the front and back. If I'm doing a design or something I'll mask appropriately.  A canopy won't affect the dip."

What I don't know and I'd really like to find out are the ramifications on customers who pick it up in Nevada and take it home. The whole reason they restrict the high VOC products is because of problems with smog. Some areas like LA actually have even more restrictive regulations than the state.   I'm pretty sure I read some exemptions about up to 2 cars per  year can be ""painted"" at the personal level, but I suspect these dip shops operating in California are probably risking heavy fines if they get discovered."

plastidip,36j3b9,hurtsboyhurts,10,Tue May 19 20:03:55 2015 UTC,"We have had material costs of a dip on a car exceed $650, so materials aren't always cheap.

plastidip,36b113,cumslikepeternorth,2,Mon May 18 15:22:50 2015 UTC,"The all-metal is expensive, but has a very long shelf life and is the best body filler out there for when you have a deep repair to do on a car that is not worth a full on resto, with welding in new sheet metal.  Practice with the liquid hardener before using it on the repair.  You count drops, not lay ribbons of hardener like cheapo bondo.  Less is the way to go.  Also this stuff sands like a dream.  You can get feather edges so that the repair will look seamless.  Buy good sandpaper too.  Always start with a less aggressive grit.  Sanding gouges are worse to fix than the original repair in most cases.  Amazon is your friend for sourcing this stuff.  Read the reviews and ask questions if you are unsure.  Bodywork is an art.  It will take time to get the feel for it and products you prefer to use.  Also, buy a cartridge resperator.  Like they sell at the paint store.  Just make sure to get the filters for organic fumes.  Paint and filler fumes are not something to breath in regularly.  Protect your lungs and eyes and then play with the materials.    Good luck and remember to ask questions, we've all been there and know most likely how to steer you through what you want to accomplish."

plastidip,36b113,KrazeRyo,2,Mon May 18 16:21:41 2015 UTC,"Process,   We power washed the hell out of them and got rid of most of the flaking paint, then sanded with 60, 150, then 400 grit sandpaper. just an FYI THIS TAKES FOREVER!  These rims could have come out better if we had more time to dedicate to them, but time constraints did not allow that to happen. You can see in the after pictures that the height difference between the stock rim paint and dip is noticable, but it certainly looks better than peeling silver paint.   Other options:    I have used aircraft paint stripper to remove clear coat from a rim before, if we had removed all of the OEM paint first it would have come out better Sand blasting, if at all possible it would bring the rim back to metal and allow the dip to go onto a smooth fresh surface. More time/sanding. This is what is really needed, I would dedicate a good 1-2 days to properly fix these, possibly use some bondo to fill the curb rash, video can be found on youtube Here I would always try this first, and move onto more expensive options if this fails   Overall, the owner was very happy with it and loves the new look!

plastidip,36bmif,Imgettingscrewed,1 point,Mon May 18 03:29:06 2015 UTC,It's mostly practice. You have to move quickly with pearls since clear/gloss/TC is thinner than normal dip. If I get a run in something it's usually because the spray was too heavy or I was too slow.
plastidip,36bmif,code-sloth,1 point,Mon May 18 03:37:28 2015 UTC,It's just that when I move quickly I seem to get orange peel texturing maybe that's just as good as it can get and they use good camera work on the DYC videos but I thought that they were getting it pretty smooth
plastidip,36bmif,Imgettingscrewed,2,Mon May 18 04:00:36 2015 UTC,"Keep practicing and you'll get better at it, though sometimes everyone has an off day.

plastidip,36be8p,Traberjkt,1 point,Mon May 18 00:30:01 2015 UTC,Dip is awesome. Fully endorse it. Get the DYC sprayer and pick up a couple gallons of a color you like and start spraying!

plastidip,36be8p,Grimsterr,1 point,Mon May 18 04:29:57 2015 UTC,"The hardest part about dipping your car will be that you, based on your plates, live in California. You can't get gallons shipped to you. There are authorized installers in California but that will cost more to have it professionally done. If you know anybody in Arizona or Nevada you could have it shipped to them from DYC or KPP then figure out from there the best way to get it to you.  Pick a color and also get a gallon or two of DYC Topcoat to get a glossy finish. They recommend at least 3 coats for a high gloss finish. Either tape off the chrome or peel those pieces once you're done.  If you haven't checked out the DYC Tutorial on youtube, I highly suggest it."
plastidip,36be8p,mikron2,1 point,Mon May 18 23:00:08 2015 UTC,Yeah I went around and got some estimates. Top was 1200 for glossy topcoat and 700 was the best.
plastidip,36be8p,mikron2,1 point,Mon May 18 23:19:57 2015 UTC,"$700 for the topcoat doesn't sound that outrageous to me. You'd be looking at close to that if you bought everything yourself and don't have to worry about spending a day of work prepping/spraying. It's fun, but if I had an installer in my area that I was confident would give me the results I want for $700 I'd probably do that instead of doing it myself.  Good luck, and post pics once you're done!"
plastidip,36be8p,mikron2,2,Mon May 18 23:25:31 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info! Me and my brother are considering possibly waiting maybe a month and doing it as a summer project. If we don't then I will have it done most likely. Again thanks for the information!

plastidip,367jdz,fixmefixmyhead,1 point,Mon May 18 04:49:54 2015 UTC,"Turtle Wax Ice, Blou Dip Mist, DYC Dip Coat will all work. From what I've heard Dip Mist and Dip Coat are better than the Turtle wax. There's been debates on whether dip coat/mist are waxes or not, but they do similar things in protecting the dip from marring, scratches, add a little gloss, and make the finish feel much smoother."
plastidip,367jdz,steve2166,2,Mon May 18 23:03:30 2015 UTC,"have you ever tried this on dipped wheels? I drive a black mustang with the wheels dipped black, the wheels are a little too matte for me in comparison and i put glossifier over them. Maybe I should try the wax to bring out the black a little more?"
plastidip,367jdz,steve2166,1 point,Tue May 19 05:15:52 2015 UTC,"It works the same on wheels, but it will only add so much shine on matte dip even with glossifier. If you want a glossy finish get a quart of the DYC topcoat. If you don't have a sprayer, you can also get a Preval sprayer to do the wheels. One coat would make them a semi-gloss/satin, with 2-3 coats will make them glossy. They will feel much smoother too, particularly after using dip coat. I tried both glossifier and topcoat, topcoat is so much better, I'll never use glossifier again.  The problem I have with mine is they get dull from brake dust, other than that the topcoat is really glossy, the dip coat makes it really shine and really smooth when they are clean. Check my post history, I've got a picture of my wheels after the topcoat, and another of my car dip with the same wheels in the picture but on the car."
plastidip,367jdz,xjescobedox,0,Tue May 19 05:46:57 2015 UTC,"I used Turtle Wax Spray Wax. It did exactly what dip coat seemed to due on the DYC video, but for $24 less/bottle (+$9shipping)."

But hey if you like it then who cares. If not then it might be that you used cans. I bought a sprayer and 4 gallons of paint. I personally would never do all cans on my car, just for touch ups. It was my first time dipping and I wanted to use whatever would make it look the best. paid 130 for the sprayer and 220 for 4 gallons, then tape, masks, and buckets. so 350-400$ for a fresh new look on my car was definitely worth it."

It's more understandable if they're wrapping a full detail into that with paint correction...but for under dip that's just silly. The customer wouldn't even see the polished paint.  You could do it yourself for $300 and that's including the cost of a sprayer. Do you have to park on a street?"

plastidip,35vkus,jasonfifi,3,Wed May 13 21:51:06 2015 UTC,I dipped in my driveway. $1k is just way to expensive. Most standard full flat dip jobs I have seen are about $600.

plastidip,35vkus,jasonfifi,2,Wed May 13 21:57:47 2015 UTC,"A power washer and WD 40, or any type of oily fiery substance just melts dip to where it comes of with no issues.

You could easily lay down plastic painters mat and drive over it to protect the concrete. Since I was out in the sun in north Texas the coats dried so quick I got 6 coats on the entire car in under 4 hours (I would imagine you will have the same type of weather in AZ). It was a nice day with no wind so I didn't have any problems with dust. If you use the sprayer make sure you don't point it at anything covered in dust and you wont have any problems.

plastidip,35vkus,TheDovahkiinsDad,2,Wed May 13 21:56:55 2015 UTC,"I suppose if I do that and build a make-shift paint booth it would be less than half the cost of having those guys do it... paint + the $125 canopy i'm looking at would still only be around $500.     However, if I add in gloss (since a paint job would have gloss/clear coat) it would be half the cost.  Re-do it in 3 years for the same price.  That means if the paint job would last longer than 6 years, it's still a better deal.     I'm willing to bet if you took care of a paint job the way that the dip needs to be cared for, it would last longer than 6 years.  Even a mid-range paint job.     Just wondering if plasti-dip is largely for the fun factor of changing color every few years, or protecting nice factory paint jobs, or economical.  I'm thinking that last one is not a huge factor in the long run."

plastidip,35vkus,pirates_never_lie,1 point,Fri May 29 20:03:29 2015 UTC,"Well their dip pricing is outrageous. You could do it yourself, 3 times, before it started to cost 1k for a dip job. As far as dip versus paint, dip can get torn and is temporary, but can very easily be kept on for a long time if it is done well and maintained well. Paint is more permanent and is shinier usually. I would recommend dipping it simply because there's so many options for color, and if you don't like it, you just peel it off and try something else. Just think about it, estimate $400 to dip your whole car. You could dip it 3 separate times before it costs as much as a paint job. And the dip could last for many years easily."

The result was quite good so I never bothered with the latter option, and the Plastidip is still going strong a year & a half later.  I chose plain old black and went through 2 & ¾ spraycans as the rims are only 15"" and also a very simple design. I took them off the car obviously but didn't bother masking anything. After a few drives the flex in the sidewall made the overspray very easy to get off anyway.  Lastly, here's a nicer pic I took at a French car festival in Melbourne, Australia."

plastidip,35n8od,naturally-baked,0,Tue May 12 00:24:41 2015 UTC,why would you paint your wheels on your car?  You're bound to overspray your entire car by doing this.   Not saying it can't be done without overspray.  I'm just saying it's really easy to take wheels off and if you are trying to do custom work like painting your wheels I hope you know how to remove them.

plastidip,35kj6r,djrasras,1 point,Tue May 12 16:48:18 2015 UTC,Yes that's correct.  I used water based air brush paint so it didn't harden the dip. That way peelability wasn't effected.

plastidip,35mpor,Azume01,1 point,Sun May 17 02:28:54 2015 UTC,a quart should be plenty.  I had full coverage after a few coats but i used half a gallon and 25g of pearls.
plastidip,35mpor,code-sloth,3,Sun May 17 07:03:30 2015 UTC,Tire mounting machines will chew dip off wheels so removing them to dip would be pointless. Just stick index cards or playing cards in a fan around the lip of the wheel and you'll be fine. It's easiest to do that if the wheels are off the vehicle and laying flat on the ground.
plastidip,35mpor,mikron2,2,Mon May 11 19:52:23 2015 UTC,Thank you. I thought it seemed a little counterintuitive. The guy telling me this also does it on the side as a business and I'm also trying to be sure he isn't feeding me shit so I'll just pay him to do it.

plastidip,35mpor,mikron2,1 point,Mon May 11 23:17:43 2015 UTC,"I was told by someone who dips that because I have low profile tires, not only do I need to remove the wheels from my car before I spray them   You don't need to, but you can. I've done 18""s and 19""s with low profile tires both on and off the car. I prefer off but it's about the same work either way.   I need to remove the tires prior to spraying the rims.   I wouldn't recommend this at all. You're likely to damage the dip when the tires get mounted back on the wheel. Although I sprayed mine with the tires on, I had to have one tire removed and re-mounted due to a bead leak, and it fucked up the dip so I had to respray that wheel. It may be more durable if you have the tire off, because there won't be any possible dip connected to the wheel and tire in the gap, but you're still running the risk of damaging during mounting from the machine and the tire itself rubbing against it.   He also said that because my rims are the size they are, he would dip the whole thing rather than spraying the front.   I did my 18""s just the front of the wheel without any problems. You had to really look to see that they were aluminum colored on the inside. It's not something you have to do because of the size of the wheel. I'd say it more depends on the design of the wheel than the size and how easily you can see the original color on the inside of the wheel.   I've tried to research it but I haven't seen anything about low profile tires changing the process. Is there any truth to this?   Not from my experience. Dipped 18""s and 19""s wheels on the car, off the car, tires always on, did the front only a couple times, did the inside and front a couple times, the tires and size made no difference.   Frankly, I don't think I can fit my hands through them well enough to cover my brakes with something anyway.   If that's the case it's probably easier to remove them, spray, then put them back on. If you want the lugs to be the same color i used a cardboard box from Costco, flipped it over and cut a cross into the box for each lug to sit in so I could spray them all in one place standing up."
plastidip,35mpor,mikron2,2,Mon May 11 20:05:34 2015 UTC,"I added a picture of the rims on my car to the post.  The guy that I've been dealing with wants to charge me $350 to take the tires off, dip them, and balance them after putting them back on. I was also told that because my current rims aren't matte already, I will need to either buff them or prime them."
plastidip,35mpor,mikron2,2,Mon May 11 22:27:01 2015 UTC,"From what you've mentioned in this post, I'd stay away from this guy. He's full of shit, and overcharging you. You do not have to buff or prime your wheels to dip them and get a matte finish, the dip is matte on its own unless you use glossifier or the DYC topcoat to make them glossy. Do it yourself, it will cost $30 tops and take a couple hours of your time. Get the tires rotated and balanced (I'd probably go somewhere else, but that's your call) then take them off, dip them and be on your way with some extra cash in your wallet.  Have you watched the DYC video on how to do them yourself? I've linked the video to the latest wheel tutorial, but if you haven't checked out their channel, spend some time watching and you'll get a much better idea of what does/doesn't need to happen when you dip and how badly this guy is trying to screw you."
plastidip,35mpor,code-sloth,1 point,Mon May 11 22:51:11 2015 UTC,"Sorry, should have been clearer, he's telling me the dip won't stay in place well because they're not matte already.    I'm due for an oil change soon, I can have them rotated and balanced then, save myself a separate trip. I will definitely not be going to him. After what's been said here, I don't think he's ever going to touch my car.   I've got the DYC video bookmarked for reference. I watched it last night but I suspect I will be referring back to it."
plastidip,35ljhy,Vok250,1 point,Mon May 11 14:20:27 2015 UTC,"Dip can't match the shine of paint, so you'd probably wind up dipping the entire car to have it match as one color and finish."

If it's the former, you might be able to cover it with a piece of tape or a decal after dipping if it happens to show through.  Start with light coats then slowly build it up. Dip is self leveling so it'll hide a lot of scratches and might at least minimize the really bad one."

plastidip,35fe48,Perseus0001,1 point,Thu May 14 18:22:23 2015 UTC,"Great looking car.  I am a first time dipper, and I would like to recreate this look for my WRX. If you don't mind can you give me a quick run down of the gallons and colors used? (ie. 2-gallons of X for base coat and x grams of ____ pearls in X gallons of top coat.)  Thanks in advanced"
plastidip,35fe48,Perseus0001,1 point,Tue May 26 17:07:15 2015 UTC,"Sure, I used a gallon of gunmetal grey as a base coat to even out the color (I peeled some of the car for bodywork). Then I did 1 1/2 gallons of the new top coat with 150 grams of the deep sea blue pearl. Then 1/2 gallon of pure top coat. If I could do it again, I would have bought one more gallon of the top coat, and done 2 full gallons of pearl with another full gallon of top coat.  Make sure you buy more dip then you need, it's always stressful watching those gallons go empty fast XD"

plastidip,35gqw2,Dudebythepool,2,Sun May 10 04:51:41 2015 UTC,"you could fight th efading with glossifier (fade blocker!) or the new top coat, but it will fade, the full color spectrum color electric lime green is very similar and doesnt fade"
plastidip,35gqw2,dvargas1123,2,Sun May 10 05:05:45 2015 UTC,The BLAZE line of dips do not last long and will fade quickly.   These are a more lasting option: http://www.dipyourcar.com/Full-Spectrum-Colors/  I had the Koi Orange and it looked great for a long time.
plastidip,35gqw2,Harmonic_Content,2,Sun May 10 14:42:41 2015 UTC,"They (I believe) got rid of their blaze line, and are bringing it better fade resistant fluorescent colors."

plastidip,35e6s8,football2106,1 point,Sat May 9 20:28:24 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely say outside is not ideal. The winds were at 15 mp/h according to Google, which I definitely believe. I just tried to spray in between gusts and it came out pretty well.  In a paint booth I'm sure this would have came out absolutely gorgeous. As it stands now, it's good, but if you're right up on it and looking for imperfections you can find them."
plastidip,35e6s8,Oh-Tang,1 point,Sat May 9 20:34:31 2015 UTC,"It was extremely windy today, so I'm really surprised with how well the dip job came out. It will need some touch up with a rattle can tomorrow due to some small errors in masking, but otherwise I think it looks fantastic!  The paint and body panels were mismatched in color and looked pretty shitty before hand, I think this is a massive step up!"

plastidip,35f0gs,PSNDonutDude,2,Sat May 9 18:37:33 2015 UTC,"Dip doesn't fade. The Blaze colors do but they're hopefully being phased out because they're not UV stable. Dipping a whole car with cans is going to streak and look terrible. I know you say you're good, but you just can't avoid stripes over a large surface and the layers you put down with cans will be a lot thinner than what a gun puts down. That A4 is matte red. They had dipped it purple previously then dipped normal red over that. That's why you see purple underneath as the dip is being peeled. I think their shop lights back then weren't very good so it looks darker than it would in the sun.   If you want a darker red you can use Nebula Red pearls or add black tint to red gallons."
plastidip,35f0gs,code-sloth,0,Sat May 9 19:14:34 2015 UTC,"Sighhh, I suppose I should get the sprayer, I already have a compressor... And I assume the gallons would be cheaper than the rattle cans. I wonder if there are any tutorials on how to darker it slightly like they have the video. I don't want it too dark.  Thank you though! I appreciate your feedback."
plastidip,35f0gs,code-sloth,1 point,Sun May 10 15:05:47 2015 UTC,You can pick up a tint kit that comes with clear dip and tint bottles for experimenting with colors. I'm in the process of figuring out a rust color.

plastidip,35bd3a,TugboatR-D,5,Fri May 8 18:12:49 2015 UTC,"Dip is cheaper and temporary.  Wrapping is more expensive but lasts longer.  It really depends on how long you plan to have the car that color, if you're ok recoating, and how glossy you want it."
plastidip,35bd3a,CoasterCOG,1 point,Fri May 8 18:33:10 2015 UTC,I never saw the point in wrapping after seeing the price tag. Why not just paint?   Dip is def the way to go though.
plastidip,35bd3a,TheDovahkiinsDad,4,Thu May 14 18:28:12 2015 UTC,"It's less work, easy to clean, and you can power wash all your truck's dirt off without any problems. If you do scrape it, just wipe off the scrape and spray over it with a rattle can for an instant fix. Can't do that with vinyl!  Plus your wife could pick any color she wanted. There are tons of pearls and colors to choose from."
plastidip,35bd3a,code-sloth,2,Fri May 8 18:16:06 2015 UTC,"I've had my 97 ram dipped for close to 2 years now, I offroad and get it covered in mud at least once a month. All I've ever had to do was touch up the rims a few times when I had my tires rotated."

plastidip,35bd3a,cigr,2,Sat May 9 04:33:15 2015 UTC,Dip it!
plastidip,35bd3a,snaxdip,1 point,Sat May 9 17:23:58 2015 UTC,"I've dipped my car twice, and have the roof and trim wrapped currently. I prefer the dip personally.   The vinyl was $300 for the roof and trim, where I can dip my car with the top coat for the same price. The installer quoted me $2,200 for a full car wrap and I've got an 03 Passat which should be similar in size to the A4, and the truck would likely be more expensive. You're looking at throwing down ~$5,000 to wrap both depending on local installer prices. Even if you paid somebody to dip both, you'd likely be saving about 50% over the cost of wrapping.  The vinyl does look closer to OEM paint, but the new DYC topcoat narrows that gap considerably. The gloss vinyls scratch pretty easily too. You can see some of the light scratches on the vinyl from the installation, but that may just be a negative on the installer I picked not the vinyl itself. I've read about cleaning the vinyl, and it seems more fragile than dip as far as cleaning goes. I get mine hand washed so I don't worry about either the dip or wrap, but the dip seems able to handle more abuse. Really the only thing I get concerned about with the dip is accidentally getting something on it that will re-liquify it and mess up that spot, but like others have mentioned, it's quick to fix if you have leftover dip."
plastidip,35b0vp,DizzerPilot,2,Fri May 8 16:36:04 2015 UTC,"You should be good if you sand it down and feather the flaking areas. You can keep the dip on until you're ready to get the paint repaired, which is what a lot of folks with less-than-pristine vehicles do."

plastidip,3552md,TheSammichDude,2,Thu May 7 04:13:52 2015 UTC,"you dont need it, but it is easer and reccomended. And radiant red is a pearl, pearls cant be applied directly over eom paint, they need a base coat. So you should use a base coat of black or red. If you do red I would do 2 gallons gunmetal, 3 gallons red, then 2 gallons of pearl mixutre.   For a black base coat just do 5 gallons black"
plastidip,3552md,dvargas1123,2,Thu May 7 05:13:52 2015 UTC,7 gallons seems like a lot. I have a small car but I only used 4 gallons total.
plastidip,3552md,CalebisReal,3,Thu May 7 05:28:35 2015 UTC,"5 gallons is recommended for a car your size, and you cant look at it lke that. It isnt 7 gallons i recomended, its 5, what i mean is that pearl gallons dont count twards the thickness/peelability gallon count.  the new top coat and the 50/50 matte clear/glossifier mix are not thick enough to be sprayed on their own and require a base coat. for that reason, they dont count as coats or gallons, they are simply added effects to your dip. for example, on a grill if I do 5 coats black and 4 coats gloss, i still only have 5 ""peelable"" coats."
plastidip,3552md,dvargas1123,1 point,Thu May 7 05:39:32 2015 UTC,I'm picking up what you're laying down. However I only did two gallons of base and then two gallons of pearlized and it peeled just fine
plastidip,3552md,CalebisReal,2,Thu May 7 05:48:04 2015 UTC,"okay, and I guess you can do less. I just always do whats reccomended by the chart guide for car sizes"
plastidip,3552md,dvargas1123,1 point,Thu May 7 05:56:32 2015 UTC,"You might be able to get away without using GMG basecoat because your car is orange, but in general as rare as it is, whenever there is a staining issue on OEM paint it seems to always be caused by red. Ultimately, if you can use GMG and then use red on top, that's still the ideal route to take just as a preventative measure."
plastidip,352fe4,SuchWastedPotential,6,Wed May 6 15:20:49 2015 UTC,That's not bad. I heard it's good for a top coat because it's thinner and gives less texture.

plastidip,352xe9,ViperBite550,3,Wed May 6 20:27:34 2015 UTC,If you spray from too far away you get a texture but it's more like an orange peel than what you posted.
plastidip,352xe9,code-sloth,2,Wed May 6 17:41:27 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely no expert on Plasti-dip, but would something like this work as a base layer before you sprayed the plasti-dip?"
plastidip,352xe9,freythman,1 point,Wed May 6 20:06:54 2015 UTC,"This was my first thought as well, there's also wall texture in a spray can that will give a slightly different pattern. You'll probably wanna sand the controller a bit to rough it up first. Then do a layer of the ceiling or wall texture and finish with several coats of plastidip to ensure full coverage."
plastidip,352xe9,ChadFromWork,1 point,Thu May 7 00:40:59 2015 UTC,My only thought is does this dry brittle? Hopefully someon who has used it can chime in or you can dig through the reviews to find more info. Something brittle under plastidip is probably going to degrade pretty quickly bumping around on hard surfaces such as a table.
plastidip,352xe9,FishnLife,1 point,Thu May 7 04:40:27 2015 UTC,That's a good point. Hopefully someone can chime in that's done this or something similar.

plastidip,352xe9,TheDovahkiinsDad,1 point,Thu May 14 18:29:43 2015 UTC,You could try spraying it heavy while having the piece hung up so it'll drip a little?
plastidip,352xe9,Ezra_ILA,1 point,Wed May 6 18:15:32 2015 UTC,"Ideally you would need something that's smooth, possibly slightly soft, holds its shape, and strong.   I'm thinking you could mix up some epoxy (check to make sure that it won't melt the plastic) and use a needle, safety pin, or toothpick to place little ""drops"" around the controller. It might be kinda time consuming, but it'll definitely be solid.   If you could get a reliable sputter with the right texture on your plastidip spray, that would probably be ideal. I've had this happen to me when the nozzle is slightly clogged. Maybe you can mess with the nozzle in a way to get a controlled spray? Then you'd just spray plastidip over that after its mostly dry and the texture will show through the subsequent layers.   As a disclaimer, I'm no expert. These are just some ideas that came to mind.   Edit, also just came across info on stock texture that's used on guns: http://rdprecision.net/do-it-yourself-stock-texture/"

plastidip,34xrgf,pineapple599,1 point,Tue May 5 13:11:26 2015 UTC,DYC actually has World Rally Blue pearls that are almost an identical match to Subaru's World Rally Blue.  Do a base of Light Blue Black then hit it with the pearls mixed into the glossifier or TopCoat gloss. I'd go with three gallons for the base (probably on the high side but it's better to have extra than not enough!) and one gallon for the gloss/TC since the latter is incredibly thin compared to normal dip.  Edit: The suggestion for the base color from /u/lqskins is better!

You could get one of those unfolding canopies and drape plastic down the sides to make a mini paint booth so you're at least protected from two or three sides.

plastidip,34xrgf,lqskins,1 point,Tue May 5 14:58:46 2015 UTC,Watch the weather for the least breezy day and you should be okay to dip in the open. Make sure you put plastic down and drive the vehicle onto it so you don't dip the parking lot itself.
plastidip,34xrgf,code-sloth,1 point,Tue May 5 15:42:38 2015 UTC,For sure. Would I be able to get away with 2 gallons if I didn't do the roof?

Then use problably only 2 cans and 2-3 coats of the graphite metalizer.

plastidip,34belb,nkyglv,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:24:14 2015 UTC,"Satin is usually a 1:1 ratio between matte dip and glossifier. If you want a pearly coat, the balloon white pearls will probably get the right finish. You can order a pre-mixed quart of TopCoat with whatever pearls you want to experiment with in small scale to see what works. For white pearls you'd do a matte white base then spray the pearl-loaded TopCoat over it.  Glossifier takes a bit longer to cure and yeah, it does seem to stay sticky or tacky until it's done. I've found that letting it cure in the sun for several hours then waxing it helps keep it smooth. In the spring and summer though it can be hard to keep clean in that time window.  DipCoat is essentially spray wax."

plastidip,3465em,dim_unlucky,2,Tue Apr 28 16:41:30 2015 UTC,"the knives will not cut cleanly, they will catch and drag the dip, ive tried it before and it is a pain. you do have a little more time tht you are giving yourself. i would say you have about 1-2 minutes to peel it all off, not soemthing like 20 seconds. I would still try to do the design if you like it. and remember, it you find that youve only reoved half of the tape you needed to and it is drying, just grab a piece of paper, cover what you already peeled, and give the remeining tape another coat to re-wet it, you can do that asoften as you need until all the tape is peeled"
plastidip,3465em,dvargas1123,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:20:26 2015 UTC,"Trying to cut dip doesn't work out well. You're more likely to scratch through to the helmet's surface when doing that.  You used nice fat stripes of tape, so here's what you do. Referencing picture 2, lift the top edges of the tape strips and slide a long horizontal piece underneath them, so you can peel the one horizontal piece of tape and that'll start pulling all the vertical strips.  Do the same to the bottom, so you have two horizontal strips under the edges of the vertical strips. That should let you pull almost all of the tape cleanly. Any lingering pieces can be coaxed up with the tip of a scalpel.  The only finicky part is the section in the character on the right that has those tiny boxes. For that I would lift the tiny tape bits and slip a couple threads under the tape, then press it down again. When you're spraying, hold the threads out of the way of the dip, then pull the threads at an angle to get the tape to peel off nicely.  ETA: When peeling tape, you generally have a window of about 15-30 seconds before it starts latching onto the masking. Keep a steady hand and don't panic when peeling. It's tape on dip, not a wax strip on hairy legs :P"
plastidip,3465em,code-sloth,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:22:10 2015 UTC,"""Trying to cut dip doesn't work out well.""  So, does that mean you should cut and peel before it dries? (serious question, I'm new to this)"
plastidip,3465em,jodyllano,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:09:48 2015 UTC,"Dip is a liquid before it dries so no, you can't. Tape needs to be peeled before the final layer of dip dries though."

plastidip,345qma,Synssins,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:51:47 2015 UTC,2 gallons per color if you want to be safe. If thinning about 1.5 should do it.  1 gallon of gloss on top unless you do a black all around then do a white color pearl on top.
plastidip,345qma,Dudebythepool,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:10:56 2015 UTC,"Oh this'll be a fun one. For the record this is what you're working with, correct? I'm thinking 2 gallons would cover it with a flat color, so we can use that number as the minimum for how much dip you'll need.  A few questions:   Which flake/pearl were you thinking of doing for each color? What color is the car right now? White sometimes requires a base coat of gray otherwise it'll take a crap load of dip to cover properly. Which type of gloss were you thinking about doing? There's the normal glossifier and there's the new super shiny TopCoat version."
plastidip,345qma,code-sloth,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:13:05 2015 UTC,"This specifically is what I'm working with, but yes you have it right.  The current color in the image is the current arrangement on the car. The lower black is already plasti-dip and I'll need to peel it.  The DYC guys recommended ""Black Betty"" for the black, and ""Balloon White"" for the white.  I want as much pearl as I can get in the black, as it is below the bodyline and will be very subtle.  I want shine. Lots and lots of shine. :D  For the record, the car was featured in a news story on Plasti-Dip."
plastidip,345qma,code-sloth,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:31:11 2015 UTC,"Oh that was you! That's rad.  You can technically shoot the white pearl over the white paint, but I'd be concerned about how well it would peel later. I'd lay down a base of flat white on the white, then shoot the TopCoat with the balloon white mixed in. That'll give you the super shiny, super pearly white. Himalayan White might work too.  Black is the same case. Do a flat black base then shoot the TopCoat with the Black Betty mixed in. If you want it to be more eye-catching you might want to look at the Jet Black microflake.  Black Betty: https://twitter.com/DipYourCar/status/466227320093548544  Jet Black: http://i1307.photobucket.com/albums/s583/Rhysispieces/null_zps814b9947.jpg  Getting two gallons of each color plus one gallon of TopCoat for each pearl/flake color would keep you covered. It doesn't take that much TopCoat to do a whole vehicle because it's so thin, but you do have to build up layers of it. You could probably get away with splitting a gallon of TopCoat between the two colors if you wanted. It's the most expensive dip per gallon, haha.  For how much pearl to order, check the product pages. At the bottom it should tell you how many grams to mix into a gallon. It varies between pearls and flakes."

plastidip,345qma,code-sloth,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:05:58 2015 UTC,"Can you apply a light pearl over a flake? I really like the effect of a pearl with the pop of the flake. There was a car that had a paint job with the two at a show last year that I was drooling over.  Quantities in pre-thinned sprayable:  Two gallons of black  Two gallons of white  One gallon of topcoat for the black pearl/flake  One gallon of topcoat for the white pearl  I don't need to spray any additional layers of topcoat over all of it, do I?  Let me lay the process out to see if I completely understand. Spray flat coat of each color, covering completely. Do I apply the same full 3+ layers as if I was planning to leave it flat?  Mix Black Betty (or Jet Black flake) into topcoat, apply 2-3 coats over flat lower half.  Mix Balloon White into topcoat, apply 2-3 coats over flat upper half.  Drink beer."
plastidip,345qma,code-sloth,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:42:33 2015 UTC,"Yup. There's actually a pearlizer dip that works similar to the glossifier. You lay down your base/colors/whatever, then spray it with pearlizer to give it that soft glow finish. It comes in gallons or cans, so I'd do a little testing to see what combination looks best.   Quantities in pre-thinned sprayable:   Two gallons of black Two gallons of white One gallon of topcoat for the black pearl/flake One gallon of topcoat for the white pearl   I don't need to spray any additional layers of topcoat over all of it, do I?   Nope. You could but I think the limit for the super glossy effect plateaus at about 6 layers. Anything past that and I don't think you'll see much of a difference with adding more.   Let me lay the process out to see if I completely understand. Spray flat coat of each color, covering completely. Do I apply the same full 3+ layers as if I was planning to leave it flat?   Yes. Your base is going to make it so that you can peel it later if necessary since just spraying the TopCoat with pearls on the paint would be a nightmare to peel off. Pearls generally require a solid base for reflection purposes, too.   Mix Black Betty (or Jet Black flake) into topcoat, apply 2-3 coats over flat lower half.  Mix Balloon White into topcoat, apply 2-3 coats over flat upper half.  Drink beer.   Pretty much. To keep from having to mask and unmask and re-mask the top and bottom sections I'd probably do the two halves in two stages:   Tape off upper section. Spray black base on lower section. Spray black pearl/flake TC. Pull masking. Beer. Let dry for a day. Beer. Tape off lower section. Spray white base on upper section. Spray white pearl TC. Pull masking. Beer. Let dry for a day. Beer. Grin like a madman while peeling the headlights and tails.   This isn't far off from what I'm doing to my xB next month for Jurassic Park, but unlike you I'm doing a gradient between the two colors so I don't get to mask off a nice line, haha!"

Would it make sense for me to get another quart or two of the white/black/topcoat to experiment with prior to spraying the car?
plastidip,346noa,Standaloneoak,1 point,Tue Apr 28 18:52:09 2015 UTC,"the problem with thinning your own dip is that in that 14.5 oz can is only 14.5 oz of pigment. Going at a 1:1 ration means your turning that into 29oz sprayable. I know in the video it was only 24, but what im saying is that there is literally half as much pigment in the thinned dip as apposed to ready to spray plasti dip. This means that it will take more coats to cover and will not be as ""black"" or whatever color you thin. It is recomended to add at least 1 or 2 drop in tints to this if you do this yourself, that will equal out the pigment load, but it also costs just as much as buying sprayable gallons.   Also just a safety tip, always wear a respirator, I use a 3M respirator every time i spray, even when i just do rims in the driveway."
plastidip,346noa,dvargas1123,2,Tue Apr 28 20:30:11 2015 UTC,"As mentioned in the description, I am aware of the pigment transparency issues. I wear a double filtered respirator most of the time, but the wind was blowing away from me, so I didn't wear it. Not smart, I know.  Also, there really isn't 14.5 oz. in these cans. I probably could have rinsed out a little bit more using the thinner, no way it was another 2.5 ounces though. There was almost exactly 12 ounces in it, despite the advertised 14.5 oz. ;)"

Dip will let go of the tape when it's a liquid, which will give you a nice sharp line."

The last coat, however, should be a little bit heavier, and you want to pull the tape immediately after spraying that last coat, so the tape doesn't adhere to the dip. Generally, if I am taping out lines that I want to pull with dip, I spend less time between coats, do more coats and lighter, and it usually turns out better. Less time to dry means less time to adhere to the tape."

So I tries to spray closer to get a better finish and it still did the same. The other two emblems came out nice. When I also went to peel this one off the plastidip wanted to come off the chrome.

plastidip,33wxuf,ecig-vapist,3,Sun Apr 26 12:36:36 2015 UTC,To do a full car dip especially with no experience can be pretty challenging. Would you be using a spray gun or working with cans? Typically doing a full car with cans is especially difficult and even many experienced dippers end up with visible spray lines. If I were you I would definitely start by spraying a speed shape to get the technique down where you are confident that you will be able to get a smooth finish. I would say that a full car dip including prep and curing time for an inexperienced dipper could take up the bulk of a day.  I would also go on YouTube and check out a few videos. Fonzie of DipYourCar gives great tutorial videos that are very helpful.
plastidip,33wxuf,Giggity_Guy,1 point,Sun Apr 26 13:50:08 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you are using an HVLP and bulk dip from the sound if it. Spraying your car is not paticularly difficult. Spend some time watching the DYC videos and soak up all the little tips and techniques and you should be fine.  It is a rather large project, especially the first time. It will take at least a full day. I'd recommend taking 2 days. Clean and prep the car on day 1. Spray on day 2.  Make sure the car is completely dry before you spray, you can use the turbine and hose from the HVLP setup to blow in all the cracks and crevices to make sure they are dry. Identify any spots that need to be masked. Out of your masked spots identify those places where the tape isn't directly on a seem. Those places will need to be peeled while wet. Try to plan out your final coat, spray along those edges last, getting them nice and wet (not so much to run) and then peel them.  I'm on my 3rd color from last year with no noticeable damage to my paint.  Good luck, and have fun!"
plastidip,33wlz9,lokilocke,4,Sun Apr 26 09:19:20 2015 UTC,"Essentially,  Yes.  Keep an even spray,  avoid drips and do many light coats instead of trying to drown it in one go.  Also your spray pattern should be like painting a car,  start the spray before the object and hold down till you pass it.  On the rattle cans more squirts out on first press/release"
plastidip,33wlz9,code-sloth,1 point,Sun Apr 26 10:25:20 2015 UTC,Thanks. I guess I just treat it like regular aerosol spray then. I don't need a primer or anything if painting directly on plastic (3D printing lends a 'stripey' look to the plastic since it's built up in layers. I'd like those layers smoothed down)?
plastidip,33wlz9,h0och,3,Sun Apr 26 11:16:07 2015 UTC,"Dip doesn't have a primer so yes, you'd just clean the surface and start spraying."

plastidip,33vduc,screwthis0125,2,Sun Apr 26 00:48:08 2015 UTC,"They made a video on this on their channel. Clear coat makes it a pain to remove pasti dip as it makes it come off in small parts rather as a whole sheet. Many people have shown that pasti dip survives pressure washers at their highest psi, so I doubt soup and some rubbing would remove it."
plastidip,33vduc,Howard1997,2,Sun Apr 26 02:24:22 2015 UTC,I dipped the wheels on my Jeep last fall. There were times this winter when I was going through the car wash weekly to knock the salt off. My wheels still look as good as the day I dipped them.
plastidip,33vduc,harv4276,2,Sun Apr 26 04:49:08 2015 UTC,"Dipped my wheels without a clear coat (either matte clear, glossifier, or top coat) and wash them with soap and water normally with no ill effects."
plastidip,33vduc,snaxdip,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:31:37 2015 UTC,"That's a new one. Automatic car washes aren't particularly pleasant for any vehicle. Even the touchless ones are kinda ""meh"" because they don't do a very good job and their detergents often strip wax.  If your factory clear coat has decayed and flaked/burned off to the point that you'd need a total respray to fix it, I wouldn't give a crap how it's washed. It's beyond any maintenance at that point, and soap won't make a difference.  You can take a dipped vehicle through a touchless car wash just fine though. I do it in the winter to knock salt and grime off periodically until I can take care of it properly in the spring."
plastidip,33vk72,blkphtm,5,Sun Apr 26 01:12:53 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure OP means this is where they dip things, not that they necessarily dipped the tabletop itself. Though with as much dipping as some folks do, that would be a casualty eventually haha."

Hmm, so you drive [this thing]. Usually folks with brighter wheels will have a more subtle body color, or vice versa so the vehicle has some visual balance to it. I'm not sure what kind of blood red you're working with - some instances look like garnet but others look very bright like fresh blood.  Something on the gray spectrum might suit you. A metallic aluminum or anthracite could be subtle to not detract from the wheels but still look clean."

plastidip,33tbsq,code-sloth,1 point,Sat Apr 25 21:32:45 2015 UTC,"It honestly looks very close to [Light Blue] or [Flex Blue]. You could probably get a tint kit and screw around with blue/white to get the right ratio for it as well (kinda pricey to play with two gallons of material versus the cheap tint kit).  Generally pearls need a dark/black base, but the only pearl I see that's close to what you want is [Sazuka Blue]. I generally wouldn't spray pearls over a colorful or bright base because it'll wash out some of the effect.  How many coats you need depends on what route you take, whether you're using pearls or not. For the TopCoat at least it's pretty universal to want 3-5 coats of it in addition to whatever base you've put down."

plastidip,33qe64,code-sloth,3,Fri Apr 24 17:53:01 2015 UTC,"The Blaze orange is an older version that fades from UV exposure, just so you know. Koi orange is the replacement for it that doesn't fade."

Is the glossifier my only option or are there additives to help?   The dip wiki has you covered.   Since it is protecting the paint would you advise to put a few additional coats to the front area to reduce rock/bug damage?   I usually go a little heavy on the front end for full vehicle dips.

I dip in a buddy's two car garage and his house has that annoying column in the middle of everything too. Unless you're doing something like a ye olde Buick or land yacht that should be enough space. Open one garage door and put mosquito netting across it. Have a box fan or two blowing air from inside to outside. A respirator is absolutely required. I'm a Toyota/Scion woman so I can't help you there! Matte white is a pain in the ass to keep clean. It's pretty for shows but I'd never put it on a daily driver. If you want something subtle but different, look at the Nebula pearls (if you're interested in pearls) or hunter green. With any color you can change it slightly with tints, so you can control how light or dark it is. If you're dipping a dark color, you probably won't need a base coat. If you're doing something bright like white or yellow, a gray base is the golden standard. Pearls often require a black base. All dip will have a matte look by default. For an A4 I'd do 3 gallons depending on what you're doing (and if it'd need a base). Until you want to peel it off. Someone just posted a picture of their vehicle with a perfect dip job two years later. It works, but only use smoke on them. Don't use solid colors."
plastidip,33m3fy,code-sloth,2,Thu Apr 23 17:53:59 2015 UTC,"I'm relatively sure that the gray base coat is no longer required for white. Since the change over to the new PDS formula, you can start straight with white. Fonzie dipped a black car on the release video."

plastidip,33lgx4,TheDovahkiinsDad,2,Thu Apr 23 14:48:45 2015 UTC,Honestly I don't ever advise using cans to dip a car. No matter what you do it'll turn out low quality and your coats will be much thinner than using a proper gun. I'd save up for a new gun then dip when you have it.

plastidip,33fpxf,vrynice,2,Wed Apr 22 16:46:57 2015 UTC,You really don't want to use glossifier or the high gloss topcoat on anything you're dipping by itself. They're meant for finishing a dip job by going on top of existing PD.

plastidip,33d327,code-sloth,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:39:54 2015 UTC,Why do you wait so long? Isn't the dip good and cured after like 6 hours? And to the touch in 1 hour?
plastidip,33d327,Imgettingscrewed,1 point,Tue Apr 21 16:25:51 2015 UTC,It's still a tiny bit soft after several hours (like you can leave a fingerprint on it but you can't smear it) and it'll cure in the sun for a day before it's really set and can't be scratched. Like I said I'm a weekend dipper so doing a vehicle's full color one weekend then the stripes/vinyl the next just works with my schedule.

Second there is a touch of texture where I had sanded some chipping paint and didn't get it smooth enough. I might respray the front for that. And finally above all be patient. I rushed the very end and got a run, luckily it is in a non obvious spot.   The other tip is to watch the DYC videos again and again. I am certain my car looks much better than it would have without those videos. Overall i am happy. It isn't perfect but much better than the failing paint I had from a cheap paint job years ago."

plastidip,33aqn1,Blackg0ld,1 point,Tue Apr 21 03:54:45 2015 UTC,Mix then filter. I didn't filter once with a big bucket of dip and the job came out feeling like sandpaper.
plastidip,339fwf,riding_the_future,2,Mon Apr 20 18:33:12 2015 UTC,"DYC is the king supplier, yep.   I've used a Wagner paint sprayer and I've used the DYC sprayer. Honestly I prefer the DYC gun because it atomizes the dip better so you get a smoother coat. The Wagner or a hardware store sprayer isn't bad by any means, but if you're able to afford it I'd opt for the DYC one."

plastidip,3390y5,nikki109,2,Mon Apr 20 16:46:06 2015 UTC,Here is a wheel with anthracite topped with glossifier. I think it's really close to what you want.  http://i.imgur.com/PEYkulT.jpg
plastidip,3390y5,code-sloth,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:08:20 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's it! Guess I'll be ordering some anthracite and glossifier. I'm going to just spray it over the gunmetal. That should be ok right? How do you apply the glossifier? When the dip is completely dry? It's got some bad reviews on Amazon for bad application etc,  but I'm thinking that may be user error."
plastidip,3390y5,code-sloth,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:40:23 2015 UTC,"The Amazon reviews on the glossifier are hilarious because people don't know what to expect or how to use it. It's not going to give a paint-like finish by any means, but it'll be shinier than....not being shiny at all, haha.  Yep, you're good to spray it right over the gunmetal. Just clean it before spraying so you're not adding a layer of dirt/dust in the mix.  You spray gloss when the dip is dry usually. It's much thinner than normal dip so it's easier to screw up and cause drips, so stick to thin coats of it and build it up. The shiny effect tops out at around 3-4 coats or so from my experience."
plastidip,3390y5,code-sloth,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:46:04 2015 UTC,1 can of glossifier should be ok for 4 rims?
plastidip,3390y5,dvargas1123,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:59:24 2015 UTC,I usually do two cans per four wheels depending on the size. It doesn't go on like normal dip so you don't have to use that much of it.
plastidip,3390y5,dvargas1123,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:00:52 2015 UTC,"I've used anthracite many times, here it is on 3 rims that I have done, all topped with 2 coats of glossifier.   1  2  3  edit: you can also use pearls for this. black base and order a quart of the new top coat with your desired pearl mixed in, use a preval sprayer or the DYC gun to spray it on"
plastidip,3390y5,oCaptainCaveman,2,Mon Apr 20 17:29:49 2015 UTC,That's it. Thanks! Any tips for glossifier application?
plastidip,3390wj,OrignialTropics,11,Mon Apr 20 16:45:44 2015 UTC,Apply a small amount of paint thinner to the little tears and run your gloved finger along the rips. The dip will liquefy and level itself out. Or you can spray some more dip on that area to get a similar effect.
plastidip,339kwa,Samsonite_02,2,Mon Apr 20 19:08:20 2015 UTC,Fonzie has you covered [in this video]. You might also want to put plastic over your fenders depending on how breezy it is where you're spraying just to keep overspray to a minimum.

plastidip,3370qk,blusplatt,2,Mon Apr 20 03:15:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if it will blend the actual color like paint. Try it on something before you commit, I guess. Or you could order the anthracite gray."

Gold metalizer might make it pop a little more but the normal gold on its own looks great, in my opinion. A more matte gold next to the pop of the red paint will look pretty posh."

plastidip,3338t3,Dudebythepool,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:52:02 2015 UTC,"No worries! It's always good to make sure you know what you're getting into with your car :)   The larger scrape near the tail light might show through a little depending on the color you choose, but otherwise no, I don't think any of that will show up. Darker colors will mask surface imperfections better than brighter colors like yellow or white.  The large crack in the front bumper does need to be repaired, yes. Nothing will cover that.   i dont understand why they wouldnt need to be sanded   Dip is much thicker than paint, so it fills in the surface more than paint would. Deep scrapes will show through (again, depending on the color) but shallow surface damage like keying and rock chips won't. If it would give you peace of mind to sand those areas, go for it but it won't really affect the dip."

It's been a while since I've used metalizer, but they're translucent and pretty thin as a top coating so I don't think it would darken the blurple too much. Here's a thread with pictures of violet metalizer over black: [link]. And here's the video with blurple and gloss: [link]  Looking at the thread and video, I think you're on track. I'd test dip something like a hubcap or scrap piece of metal/plastic to check that the metalizer doesn't make it darker than what you want."
plastidip,32ytxe,code-sloth,1 point,Fri Apr 17 21:28:29 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for the info! Will upload pics if it looks good. (Cry if it doesn't)"
plastidip,32uwas,sokkrokker,2,Thu Apr 16 22:25:33 2015 UTC,"I use this same sprayer, it sprays well once you find a good notch for the distance and it's easy to clean. I would suggest every time before and after you use it, put a little thinner inside the hopper and spray it out to clean it"
plastidip,32uwas,Knock-emDead,2,Fri Apr 17 10:28:54 2015 UTC,"Do you think its worth it? If this gun is $50 and DYC is over $150... I would love to save $100 but not if im going to run into issues, or bad coverage."
plastidip,32uwas,pineapple599,1 point,Fri Apr 17 11:46:03 2015 UTC,I've used both and the DYC gun has better atomization (making the dip droplets super tiny for a smoother finish) while the Wagner can pump out more product for thicker layers. I only upgraded because I had to leave my Wagner at my parents' house when I moved across the country. I'd still recommend it for folks who are only doing a one-time full dip or just giving things a try without a larger investment. If you run the Wagner down you can always upgrade.
plastidip,32uwas,code-sloth,2,Fri Apr 17 13:48:11 2015 UTC,It will just be for my car and 2-3 times I will probably do it.
plastidip,32uwas,pineapple599,0,Fri Apr 17 15:12:12 2015 UTC,"I haven't run into runnage or bad coverage yet, only issue I've ever encountered was user error, not sprayer issues once you find the right range of distances you should spray at"
plastidip,32uwas,Knock-emDead,0,Sat Apr 18 01:17:08 2015 UTC,That's the same thing I did when painting cabinets. Cleaned the gun out with thinner.

plastidip,32uwas,Blackg0ld,1 point,Tue Apr 21 02:15:10 2015 UTC,What size nozzle do these come with?
plastidip,32uwas,pknipper,1 point,Fri Apr 17 01:44:27 2015 UTC,"It comes with one control finish nozzle that adjusts to 3 positions (vertical, horizontal, and round spray patterns). There is a variable trigger to set spray pattern width from 1/2"" to 10""."
plastidip,32uwas,Ryurain,0,Fri Apr 17 02:19:20 2015 UTC,He means nozzle size cause plastidip usually requires a >1.5mm nozzle to spray correctly
plastidip,32uwas,pknipper,1 point,Fri Apr 17 03:54:12 2015 UTC,I just measured a 3mm diameter. Apparently this is what they used in the beginning of the DYC youtube videos.

plastidip,32uwas,stniesen,1 point,Fri Apr 17 11:47:02 2015 UTC,How do you have amazon fix it?
plastidip,32txmn,ShimSladey,3,Thu Apr 16 18:08:14 2015 UTC,Correct. You'd just do enough to cover the black. I'd guess half a can per wheel depending on the amount of coverage you need to make the teal pop. Maybe 2-3 wet coats. Just make sure you clean the surface really well before spraying otherwise you'll have a....bad time.
plastidip,32txmn,code-sloth,2,Thu Apr 16 18:10:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would make sure to clean just like any other dip. When you say wet coat, do you mean just heavy coats?"
plastidip,32txmn,code-sloth,2,Thu Apr 16 19:37:00 2015 UTC,Yes. Since you already have a base down you don't have to go into it with super light coats. The coat you put down should look wet though not to the point that it's dripping or running.
plastidip,32txmn,dvargas1123,1 point,Thu Apr 16 19:47:55 2015 UTC,"if you go in with a neutral color like gunmetal grey you should only need 3-4 coats of intense teal, and it will ""pop"" a little better over the lighter base coat"
plastidip,32qqo9,SuchWastedPotential,5,Wed Apr 15 23:19:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah they have been around,  mostly people have had bad experiences with it,  but they offer a few unique shades, some people like that. Everybody who I have seen have success with it has used a plastidip base coat first"
plastidip,32qqo9,dvargas1123,2,Wed Apr 15 23:36:03 2015 UTC,Well that's silly considering it costs more than plastidip. The one benefit is having access to some of these colors without having to order them.
plastidip,32qqo9,dvargas1123,2,Thu Apr 16 00:53:27 2015 UTC,"exactly, but i beleive duplicolor only guarentees their product for 3 months, but if you use a plasti dip base, which can last up to 5 years, you can keep the color for the same amount of time as dip."
plastidip,32qqo9,code-sloth,2,Thu Apr 16 00:56:30 2015 UTC,Do they guarantee the adhesion or the color for three months? I'm curious to see if this is even UV stable.
plastidip,32qqo9,dvargas1123,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:03:13 2015 UTC,"thats a good question, im guessing adhesion becuase that why the dip base would help, but i actually dont know that"
plastidip,32qqo9,flyingliz45,4,Thu Apr 16 03:38:49 2015 UTC,"contrary to the other people here, my buddy used it to two tone his miata,  hasn't had any issues with it, and quite a bit easier to peal. I used it on my tiny, round door knobs and after 2 weeks it begun to peal off the corners and completely lifted up. maybe a bit too easy to peel."

plastidip,32q8ui,daludidi,2,Wed Apr 15 22:13:17 2015 UTC,"I used about 6 coats of white plastidip, I would go 7 if you have the extra product.  make sure you are laying the 50% overlapping sprays.  White doesn't cover as great as other colors especially over a dark color.  Good luck."

plastidip,32q8ui,steve2166,1 point,Thu Apr 16 00:16:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, be careful around the window trims and make sure the rubber seals aren't overlapping the paint.  You want clean edges, also make sure to mask off all areas headlights and tail lights etc, and spend a lot of time to be careful with the masking.  Prepwork is real important."
plastidip,32q8ui,ArtisticAquaMan,2,Tue Apr 21 15:18:55 2015 UTC,"did you use the new high gloss top coat or glossifier, and did you apply more gloss after by itself?"
plastidip,32q8ui,sokkrokker,2,Thu Apr 16 06:17:33 2015 UTC,I used the high gloss top coat and 75 grams of balloon white.  I only bought 2 gallons of it so I mixed in a 50/50 with the white then another 25 with half a gallon of the high gloss.  I used the final gallon of just top coat afterwards which got me barely to 3 coats.
plastidip,32tuzy,Standaloneoak,3,Thu Apr 16 17:49:26 2015 UTC,"just a warning for the future, glossifier is no where near as thick as regular colors. that half coat of black and 4 gloss will not peel well at all in the future, I know it peeled fine in the video but that is because it  was 2 hours old and you went heavy on the areas you needed to peel. in 6 months this will be baked on and most likely wont peel off in a clean sheet. while the finished result looks good, you could substitute glossier for matte clear to get nice thick coats of dip on the tail lights, then gloss over that."
plastidip,32tuzy,dvargas1123,2,Thu Apr 16 20:13:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the heads up! I already removed it since it had a run, though, and this car doesn't get driven. It was just a demonstration :)"
plastidip,32tuzy,code-sloth,2,Thu Apr 16 20:23:51 2015 UTC,"While it looks nice, I really wish that people wouldn't try to tint their tails with matte black. It's very dark during a sunny day and makes the lights hard to see unless they're very bright LEDs. That's why they made the Smoke line.  If you're only doing it for a show, sure. Just peel it when the show's over. But on a daily driver? I don't like it."
plastidip,32tuzy,code-sloth,-1,Thu Apr 16 18:05:49 2015 UTC,"The whole point of this video is to show a way to substitute the smoke line. As the video shows, you can still very clearly see the lights during both day and night. It's one very thin coat of black. It could easily be compensated for by switching out inexpensive,bright LED bulbs, but it's not necessary, as you can still clearly see the lights"
plastidip,32tuzy,vashtyler,4,Thu Apr 16 18:11:26 2015 UTC,I aware of why you made the video - you said it in the first 30 seconds. I'm just voicing my dislike for people using matte black to tint lights instead of using smoke as intended.
plastidip,32tuzy,freakofnatur,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:13:33 2015 UTC,I wish people wouldn't tint taillights at all. It is unsafe and detrimental to the function of the lights. There are better ways to have dark taillights without covering them.
plastidip,32rul3,zerobuddhas,1 point,Thu Apr 16 05:08:21 2015 UTC,How long are you holding the nozzle down for at a time?

plastidip,32rul3,DaBeticEnt,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:19:50 2015 UTC,I've done it by accident before when touching up part of a wheel. The cans will drip if you spray too long at once.
plastidip,32rul3,code-sloth,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:22:45 2015 UTC,When you are done spraying you should clean the nozzle with acetone to prevent paint from drying inside and messing up future spraying

plastidip,32o16l,myst123,3,Wed Apr 15 09:28:28 2015 UTC,"I believe that the texture is primarily caused by the cold.  Next time let the cans sit in a bucket of warm water,  you will see how much better the dip sprays.  Second,  your coats should be 1-2 light,  2 medium,  and at least 1 heavy.  This heavy coat is where the primary smoothness comes from.  What you want to do is ""drag a wet edge"" plasti dip self thins,  and providing a last heavy  even coat will smooth out every other layer and the finish will look smooth.  Also,  you can use dip coat or turtle wax ice spray wax for added protection and smoothness.  It will help protect from scratches and marring,  and make the surface slick to the touch,  rather than rubber feeling"
plastidip,32o16l,dvargas1123,2,Wed Apr 15 12:02:09 2015 UTC,"Yep seems you're right and I should have warmed it up.  I peeled it all off, kept the cans in hot water and resprayed. Holy crap that makes a huge difference.  So much easier to get smooth and consistent coverage and dries heaps faster."

For the body I'd peg it at 2 gallons of camo green. I don't think you need a base with the camo colors.  Edit: Just saw your post mentioning that you want to do an entire SUV with cans. No go, dude. Very bad idea. It'll look like crap and your hands/wrists will be killing you."
plastidip,32higj,code-sloth,2,Mon Apr 13 21:18:45 2015 UTC,Ok thanks for the help... if I am going to be using the gallons method I have two questions...   Can I get them in (somewhat northern) Canada without blowing my budget through the roof? What additional equipment will I require? Air Compressor?
plastidip,32higj,code-sloth,3,Mon Apr 13 21:22:47 2015 UTC,"Despite being close to America's hat, I'm not in your neck of the woods so I'm unfamiliar with pricing in Canada. Another poster may be able to help in that regard, but I know there are folks up there who dip so it can't be that difficult to obtain.  You'd need an air compressor and HVLP spray gun with a 1.5mm-2mm tip. If you find a distributor for DYC in Canada they can probably get you the DYC sprayer system which is what I use. You can also go to a hardware or paint store and pick up the appropriate hardware."
plastidip,32higj,NadaPlakat,3,Mon Apr 13 21:27:01 2015 UTC,"note: still new to posting to reddit, not sure how to get this text under my post up top!  Anyhow here is my idea, I have no equipment so I would prob have to use spraycans! I am wonder if anyone else who has done similar jobs can help me approximate how many cans I would need. Id like to do the rims, grill, roof, and roof trim all black (unsure if I should do glossy or matte, any recommendations?). As well as the body of the car in camo green, I may look into other colours but I am 90% sure this is what I want!!!  If this goes well maybe I could open a thread or spend some time helping others do up simplistic design ideas they have for their rides to better plan out before they go ahead!  Thanks in advance, you guys rock!  ps: THIS guy posted here as one of the top post was my inspiration!"

You can use the Dip Coat from DYC or just regularly spray wax your vehicle to keep water from lingering on the surface.

Won't harm dip, doesn't reek to high hell, hasn't caused any staining."

Not so much that it will run, but good and wet so that the dip will liquify enough to be able to pull a clean edge.

If it's not peeling nicely, solvents like citrus cleaners, WD-40, goo gone, etc will dissolve it so you can powerwash it off."
plastidip,32dbzi,pineapple599,1 point,Sun Apr 12 21:07:44 2015 UTC,"There's a DYC video that covers olive drab green and has a formula for it [here]. One gallon each of camo green and camo tan, plus five tint bottles of yellow. That makes two gallons. For the hatchback I'd lay down a gallon of black as a base coat just to ensure that it's easy to peel in the end. Then mix your green and spray that on top.  You could get creative and try to mix up three gallons of OD green, but that would require ordering four gallons of dip and you'd wind up with two half-full cans at the end, plus you'd have extra yellow tint bottles laying around."

plastidip,32anjd,MacTechReviews,3,Sun Apr 12 02:39:41 2015 UTC,you can peel just the emblem if the emblem is not attached to the rim.  A pic would help. You certainly can go back over it. Basicaly what you would do is just use what you have now as a base and start over. Do the whole rim black and then reapply glossifier to the whole rim. that would match the absolute best.

plastidip,322qfx,code-sloth,1 point,Fri Apr 10 02:46:38 2015 UTC,"Yup, just make sure the stands are rated for above your vehicle's weight and they're under the right frame points.  Do not ever carry the vehicle's load on only jacks. That's very dangerous."
plastidip,322qfx,Paradox1989,1 point,Fri Apr 10 02:53:50 2015 UTC,"And make sure your on a firm fairly level surface. Concrete is best, asphalt is ok but in hot temps jackstands can dig in and sink depending on the quality of the asphalt.   If you jack a car up on asphalt and especially if you have to do it on dirt put a section 2x10 or 2x12 under each stand to spread the weight and prevent them from sinking in while under the car."

Electric lime green over black Base coat? Maybe with a clear coat, changes the way it looks very slightly  The normal green Hunter green,  this to me sounds the most close option.  I think there's a flurro green, which is way out there.  Those are my suggestions"
plastidip,31virx,dvargas1123,1 point,Wed Apr 8 14:50:25 2015 UTC,"The Monster Green and neon green both are prone to UV fading and are way too bright. I'm thinking about getting Electric Lime green and adding a green and black tint or two, or mixing it with a little Hunter green to darken it just a touch.  I'm doing a gray base because the green and yellow both have poor coverage and my vehicle's red pinstripe would show straight through. Still debating on whether I'll do the gloss top coat or regular glossifier. Tempting to do the former so I have an excuse to mess with new product, haha.  The reddish brown stripes are another problem but brown isn't hard to mix up and tweak."
plastidip,31virx,dvargas1123,0,Wed Apr 8 14:57:27 2015 UTC,"From what I remember the uv fading does help with the flurro aspect, making it look closet to jurassic green,  maybe the electric lime green with the gray Base coat and black tint would be your best choice. Not too familiar with the new top coat, but maybe gloss and clear to get a satin look?   I'm sorry but you're on your own with the stripes haha"

plastidip,31vbhs,amoore109,4,Wed Apr 8 13:13:27 2015 UTC,"Nope, but if you want a bright red you should probably put down a gray or silver base coat. If you shoot the red straight onto the black it will look a little darker."

If you don't remove the tape it should still give you a nice edge, but there's no need for the white Base, if you somehow mess up its gonna be very obvious.

plastidip,31n1cq,dvargas1123,3,Mon Apr 6 16:58:27 2015 UTC,"nope, just once. Plasti dip uses thinners to attach and liquify the layers under it. On the 5th coat you should go fairly heavy and it liquifies the lower coats. This makes it easy to pull the tape, and is why you pull when the last coat si still wet. Fonzie did a small camo video using this technique and it demonstrates what I just said very well, here is the video"

plastidip,31liuk,SuchWastedPotential,0,Mon Apr 6 23:48:54 2015 UTC,"Yep, just don't get any dip on the pads or rotors."
plastidip,31liuk,code-sloth,-1,Mon Apr 6 14:50:15 2015 UTC,Depends on how much heat is generated. I know 6 piston ones melt the dip 1 and 2 piston were OK. Haven't done 4 yet
plastidip,31liuk,Dudebythepool,3,Mon Apr 6 14:28:33 2015 UTC,Why would piston count matter? The only thing that matters is how hot your brakes get. Personally I think dipping brake calipers is stupid. Just get the proper coating for it.
plastidip,31liuk,240ZT,-5,Mon Apr 6 16:34:50 2015 UTC,More pistons is more heat
plastidip,31liuk,Dudebythepool,2,Mon Apr 6 20:43:06 2015 UTC,Is that a fact?
plastidip,31liuk,240ZT,-4,Mon Apr 6 20:44:01 2015 UTC,Heatgun on the 6 piston wasn't even needed since dip started bubbling
plastidip,31liuk,Dudebythepool,3,Mon Apr 6 21:21:46 2015 UTC,I don't know what that means. That has no correlation to the temperature a brake caliper will generate. A car with 6 pistons and great brake cooling may have less brake heat than a car with no cooling ducts and single piston calipers.
plastidip,31liuk,240ZT,-3,Mon Apr 6 21:26:51 2015 UTC,So why would 6 piston calipers cause dip to bubble while none of the others did?
plastidip,31liuk,Dudebythepool,6,Mon Apr 6 21:34:10 2015 UTC,"I assume the variable wasn't isolated -- the conditions weren't controlled enough to accurately say the piston count, solely, caused excess heat."

Color shift pearls are a big hit, but there are also many solid color pearls and micro-flakes etc. Dipyourcar.com has everything you will need, also, dipyourcar on youtube has soo many videos about all of the products plastidip has and it is the best go to place to learn how to use this product correctly.   To acheive this color i used 5 coats of black as my base then got the GC-47 alien pearl, mixed that into 10oz of glossifier, and put that mixture into a preval sprayer, so I didnt have to use my car gun, and sprayed 2 coats of that pearl over the black base."

plastidip,31hldw,nixonbeach,0,Sun Apr 5 05:19:40 2015 UTC,"I would suggest spraying a clear lacquer of some sort over the desk before you spray the dip. This will make it peel much, MUCH easier if you decide to remove it to do something else with the top. You will also want to use a LOT of coats, as the top of a desk has a lot of stuff slide around and get tossed on it, and the more dip, the better the protection from tears and other damage."

plastidip,3156gz,FrankieSchiffer,0,Thu Apr 2 02:03:35 2015 UTC,"read over the stickied post on top for most info.   it really is easy. Make sure the cans are warm. I can notice cans getting colder while im spraying and the spray patern is negativly affected by it. take your time. Make sure you do 2 light coats first. Dont go too thick on your last coat. ALso, you will see as you dip that as the cans get emptier they spray differently. A new full can will hav the best spray pattern. I always order 1 extra can and do the last coat with the full can becasue it sprays better."
plastidip,3156gz,dvargas1123,0,Thu Apr 2 02:23:44 2015 UTC,Make sure everything is VERY dry. Blow air through any gaps or cracks you see. If there is any trapped water it will make the dip bubble. And remember rubber can absorb some moisture.

plastidip,30tqcu,code-sloth,0,Mon Mar 30 20:50:05 2015 UTC,"Yes sir! It isnt geared for that though atm. The roads where I live are too bumpy, and theres not a track I can use for that near. (ignoring the fact that im not that brave) Its a lot of RC  though, my fastest speed is 56mph. Not much, but decent for in a neighborhood. I got it on impulse after having a rustler for ~6-7 years. The rustler happens to be dipped black. I wanna do the wheels on that but the motor died finally after 7yr :/  Id be interested in seeing the bodies youve done! A tip on the wheels, tape off the rubber. The dip bonds really well with the tire, hence the white still on mine. I was doing donuts to get it off, but the batteries werent fully charged."

plastidip,30rbbl,LiterallyPizzaSauce,1 point,Mon Mar 30 01:32:12 2015 UTC,"I Would really recommend taking off your emblems in order to get good lines.   Mask off the parts of the car that aren't going to get any dip during the process. Put down your white first. You'll probably need quite a few layers for solid coverage. Tape off you circle and cover everything else with newspaper/plastic.  On the exact edge of the circle put a second layer of tape, this second layer of tape is going to create your clean line. So make sure none of the first layer of tape is showing at the edge. Since you already have some dip down, do a very quick semi-solid layer of red. Before it dries you need to pull off the second layer of tape you put around the circle. It is fucking important to do it quickly, wait too long and you'll have a shitty edge. Wait til it's dry. Put a second layer of tape around the circle again and repeat until your happy with the coverage. Follow the same principles while doing the stripes but I would suggest that you only do one or two stripes at a time. By the time you would spray all of them the first ones would be too dry for a nice line."
plastidip,30rbbl,LiterallyPizzaSauce,1 point,Mon Mar 30 01:43:21 2015 UTC,Thanks for the detailed write up. I also wondered if red spray paint over the white dip would work. The masking would certainly be easier. I might test that on a spare piece of metal I have.
plastidip,30rbbl,LiterallyPizzaSauce,1 point,Mon Mar 30 02:41:19 2015 UTC,"As long as the white is dry when you start on the red, you'll be fine. Just make sure you do at least three coats of red"

plastidip,30rbbl,code-sloth,1 point,Mon Mar 30 05:32:16 2015 UTC,Just get an extra can of glossifier and go over the whole thing after it's finished. I think it would look a lot better with a gloss finish

plastidip,30rbbl,code-sloth,1 point,Mon Mar 30 06:06:43 2015 UTC,Why retape the circle between the layers of red? When I've done multilayer stripes I haven't retaped and the end layer came up sharp just fine. It's easier to pull once than twice.
plastidip,30rbbl,code-sloth,1 point,Mon Mar 30 02:09:20 2015 UTC,Just personal experience with solid lines. When I pulled while the last coat was wet it still had a shitty line. Redid it with new tape every layer and it came out really nice.  But I also could have been doing it wrong

For the short list  Rims: clean with degreaser, completely dry, put garbage bags over the break disks and calipers, and dip. Be sure after the 4th coat to rotate the car forward 1/2 rotation   Grill: be sure to stick some cardboard or something behind the grill to protect the radiatior, tape about 1 inch away from the grill, unless you want it to be super close like if you dont have a gap.

Why not get black and yellow dip, lay down the yellow on the sripes, then tape off and do the rest of the vehicle black?"

You just need to use a break cleaner on the caliper to completely clean it before.  Prepping is just masking it off, you might want to do more than average coats, ID say about 5-7.

Something with a large flat surface (stock steelies for example) or wide, flat spokes can be done while on the vehicle. Something with thinner spokes or more angles seems to be better off the vehicle so you can move around it without being upside-down against the car.

You might want to use a pearlizer or metalizer spray on the dip after you spray the white if you want it to be shiny and not just a flat color.  Just a note...it will never look as good as a helmet that is designed to be white...but it will suffice."

For anyone getting in to it definitely give the more close up jobs like this time to cure before masking, I'd suggest an hour in the sun before applying any painters tape. Any warm color will benefit from having white underneath it - so if you are dipping more than just your car, pick up some extra whites.    When you are masking small surfaces, bend the corners of your tape as you apply it so you never need to 'scrape' the tape off, especially when its still drying.

plastidip,2zskbk,Dudebythepool,1 point,Sat Mar 21 09:42:18 2015 UTC,"I would recommend just buying online. Spray could work but may not. Its likely already thinned since its in aerosol form, but the thinner used is made to evaporate quicker."

plastidip,2zskbk,bigmancrabclaws,0,Sat Mar 21 14:46:38 2015 UTC,Yes you can. I'm used a 1:1 ratio of the can of dip and then filling the can full of thinner and then mixing. Work decently and laid out nice and smooth
plastidip,2zplhs,dustindblack,1 point,Fri Mar 20 15:56:27 2015 UTC,What size tips on the guns you already have
plastidip,2zplhs,Dudebythepool,1 point,Fri Mar 20 16:10:12 2015 UTC,you can use your compresser setup witha 1.8 size tip. That is all you will need to spray. Your compressor setup will be a better spray setup than the DYC gun. The DYC gun is a single turbine setup with about 3psi. I doubt your compressor setup is worse than that. the higher the pressure thhe better the atomization of the dip and the smoother the surface.

plastidip,2znvmr,damnyou777,1 point,Fri Mar 20 13:34:35 2015 UTC,"It's not the easiest thing to spray. It was the first time I had sprayed it, and sprayed wheels with the DYC sprayer so it was a lot of product coming out a lot faster than spraying with rattle cans on wheels and that was an adjustment. The hard part is laying it on in wet sheets without overspraying. Not wet enough, you'll get texture, too wet and you'll get the runs."
plastidip,2znvmr,AmericanPicklers,1 point,Sat Mar 21 01:27:01 2015 UTC,Did you add pearl to it or is it naturally shiny? Clear underneath or just black?
plastidip,2znvmr,busstees,1 point,Fri Mar 20 16:08:14 2015 UTC,No pearl. Rattle can black underneath then the DYC top coat to give it the shine.

plastidip,2znvmr,dvargas1123,1 point,Fri Mar 20 18:13:25 2015 UTC,is dipcoat the same thing as the plastidip glossifier?
plastidip,2znvmr,wgas,1 point,Fri Mar 20 22:41:28 2015 UTC,"No, dipcoat is a sort of spray wax (for lack of a better term) that makes dipped surfaces feel slick and adds protection against scratches/marring. Glossifier is clear plasti-dip that adds a gloss finish. I didn't use any glossifier on the wheels, instead I used the DYC top coat which is also another gloss finish plasti-dip."

plastidip,2ytl8o,code-sloth,0,Thu Mar 12 18:59:58 2015 UTC,Looks pretty good but I think you held the can too far from the tank as there's some texturing on it. Not bad for a first shot though and curved surfaces can be a pain to learn on.
plastidip,2ytl8o,throw-dis-bitch-away,-1,Thu Mar 12 18:33:41 2015 UTC,That's the hand painted barbed wire the previous owner did. It was already textured on the white paint job so I knew it would leave a texture but I didn't mind.
plastidip,2ytl8o,code-sloth,-2,Thu Mar 12 18:37:07 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about the rough texturing on the tank, not the barbed wire itself. If you look at the picture you posted it has an orange peel like texture at that angle."

plastidip,2ysl9h,yourgirlsbabydaddy11,1 point,Thu Mar 12 14:49:18 2015 UTC,"What this guy said.  In general, any metallic color works well.  I'd probably go with some sort of gray/anthracite/gunmetal on your car.  While gold can work well on a silver car, it generally looks better on wheels with thinner spokes.  The face of the factory wheels is so big, you don't want to draw a lot of attention to that.  Bright colors rarely work, and are overly flamboyant.  You usually have to have that color elsewhere on the car, so it doesn't look completely out of place (see GT3RS for an example).  Black just looks cheap, and you often lose the design and depth of the wheel in it."

If you put dip over peeling paint, when you peel the dip you'll rip up all the paint with it. It makes for an unstable, uneven surface that's not good for dip.   Fix the paint (sand it down, touch it up, whatever you want) so it's a level surface then clean it and spray.  Make sure that you wash and clay to remove all wax before dipping so it can stick properly."
plastidip,2ycmcy,code-sloth,1 point,Sun Mar 8 17:12:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info and yeah it seemed way more fit to post it here rather than there. So make sure there's no wax on it when I'm going to spray it right? And I found a spray can of touch up paint online I think I'm going to buy just to take care of the peeling paint on the rear bumper(of course sanding it down and all, just have to figure out how to).  I'm pretty sure I'm gonna have the whole front bumper repainted.  Someone spray painted the grille inserts matte black although and now that is wearing away.  I like the piano black/chrome that's the original color, is there any way to take off that spray paint without damaging the paint underneath? This is the touch up paint I plan on buying, not many places carry it. http://www.automotivetouchup.com/touch-up-paint/saab/2005/9-2x/ Also does it matter if there's spots where the car traded paint with another and some minor scratches?"
plastidip,2ycmcy,code-sloth,2,Sun Mar 8 18:06:53 2015 UTC,"I'm a mod here and I'm a regular over there so if anyone posts a dip question odds are I'll find it at some point.   So make sure there's no wax on it when I'm going to spray it right?   You got it. Wax repels water and dirt, which makes for a dip-unfriendly surface. I've sprayed dip on a freshly waxed hood for shits and giggles before and it was a very...messy experience. Doing a wash with dish soap is common practice for stripping layers of wax, and if you follow up with clay you'll have a nice contaminant free surface. If you want to be really thorough you can do a wipedown with some diluted isopropyl alcohol right before dipping.  I usually detail the car fully the day before and start dipping the next morning, so the IPA wipedown removes any dust or dirt that settled overnight too.  Your plan for spraying the touch up paint is spot on (and I think /r/projectcar might have resources for that). It doesn't have to be perfect, just smooth and stable for the dip to adhere to.  I don't think you can remove the cruddy spray paint without damaging what's under it, though Google could prove me wrong."

And I'm planning on going with the dipyourcar.com professional car kit, is that a good choice?  I know I'll need the other pearlizer gallons of course.  And would you recommend the dip coat protective spray?"
plastidip,2ycmcy,lqskins,1 point,Sun Mar 8 18:42:52 2015 UTC,"DipCoat is worth the investment. There may be alternative spray waxes, but I use the dip coat on mine religiously. Not only does it improve the over all look and feel, its biggest advantage IMO is helping keep it clean on the next wash. Dirt and grime comes off dip with dipcoat better than it does without.   I had the misfortune of driving through some tar while a new road surface was being laid down, and I was already picking out my new color cause I figured that it was a done deal. DipCoat provided enough of a barrier that I was actually able to get it off without ruining my dip."
plastidip,2ycmcy,code-sloth,1 point,Mon Mar 9 15:19:10 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info!  I'll definitely be buying it then.  Does it feel smooth like an oem paint job or does it have a distinct texture still?
plastidip,2ycmcy,polarbearrape,1 point,Mon Mar 9 22:32:00 2015 UTC,"It definitely slickens it up, but its not OEM level smoothness no."
plastidip,2ycw31,TheCrispyCat,3,Sun Mar 8 18:34:38 2015 UTC,Plastidip on my rims lasted a whole two yrs before they started to peel off. 1.5 yrs longer than what I had expected

plastidip,2ycw31,littlembarrassing,3,Mon Mar 9 14:58:58 2015 UTC,drive through washes are terrible for your car in way more ways than damaging dip.

plastidip,2y342x,Dronicusprime,3,Fri Mar 6 01:04:44 2015 UTC,Lol no. The bottoms need to be slick to slide on the snow. Plastidip is not slick.

plastidip,2y3ugc,ShimSladey,7,Fri Mar 6 04:48:19 2015 UTC,"I would say that the coats were either too thick or there was not adequite drying time, i just dipped rims and emblems in the cold also and i needed to wait much longer between coats for the dip to dry."
plastidip,2y3ugc,dvargas1123,5,Fri Mar 6 05:00:34 2015 UTC,Its probably safe to say there was not enough drying time allowed mixed with too thick of coats. That's what happens when you rush yourself.. I'll strip and dip tomorrow! Thanks for the help.
plastidip,2y3ugc,dvargas1123,3,Fri Mar 6 05:23:41 2015 UTC,"no problem! i have also had luck using a hair dryer to quicken things up, but it is very important to only do this once the dip has started drying. Dip needs the thinners in the newest coat to liquify the lower level and madke it smooth. If you use the hair dryer on the dip right away it will end up very very textured becasue you wont be allowing the thinners to liquify the lower layer. You should wait until the glossiness goes away and the matte black begins to show more. Again thats only if you use it, good luck tomorrow!"
plastidip,2y3ugc,brendanjeffrey,1 point,Fri Mar 6 05:29:44 2015 UTC,Yeah too thick for too slow drying time.  Had this same thing happen when I coated my engine cover really heavy to get too thin dip off.

plastidip,2y406u,code-sloth,1 point,Fri Mar 6 16:51:51 2015 UTC,I happen to like the black much better. It gives me the ability to add some uniformity to the car. Can't plastidip too many things bronze on a silver car and it still look good.. I agree on the gas cap after taking a look at my car for a long while. Already removed and on to the next project. Thank you for your critique.
plastidip,2y2m19,amoore109,3,Thu Mar 5 22:25:01 2015 UTC,"Nope, no ill effects. Be careful when peeling the tape off that you don't catch the new edge (between the new/old) and start pulling up the old. I use blue painters tape and will stick it to my shirt before sticking it to the dipped surface just so it doesn't grab quite as much. It'll still give you a sharp line though."
plastidip,2y2m19,code-sloth,1 point,Thu Mar 5 22:35:44 2015 UTC,I would wait at least a week for the base coat to cure before you apply tape for an accent line
plastidip,2y2c7w,coperphage,1 point,Thu Mar 5 21:14:28 2015 UTC,"you can leave it on as long as it looks good, and that meanas you have to take care of it. Many people have had it last over 2 years, ive even heard 3 years. I personally have had my grill dipped for 2 1/2 years now. If you want it to last very long, you need to make sure you apply enough product to begin with, there is a chart showing how many gallons/vehicle size. After your car is dipped witht he appropiate amount of dip, you will want to use Dipcoat (spray wax, watch the youtube video on it) and then wash it about one every 2 weeks. I would only hand wash, mechanical car washes can be rough on dip, and while it might not tear, it might scratch/mar the surface of your dip. Good luck"

plastidip,2x1h4w,CalebisReal,1 point,Tue Feb 24 22:19:22 2015 UTC,It's not a good idea. It is generally recommended that you always have a base coat between your paint and any dip containing pearls.   I'm afraid you are gonna need some more dip.
plastidip,2x1h4w,lqskins,1 point,Tue Feb 24 23:35:12 2015 UTC,"You can use any dip as a base coat. The pearl mix is a waste of money as a base, but if you've already got it, go for it. Black will cover up any other base color.   On my most recent spray, i had 2 gallons of tan left over so I used that under the black base for my pearl top coat."
plastidip,2x1h4w,timewasterextreme,0,Wed Feb 25 15:01:45 2015 UTC,"i would use black first, as 2 layers black, then the 2 gallons of blue, then the rest of the black.

Alternately you could wait for the new Dip pearl Top Coat to come out and use a pearl like hyper black or hyper titanium to get the color you are looking for.

With the worst case scenario is having to use xylene to remove the rest. One thing that I would try considering how small the paint job is.   Try an acrylic paint over the thick dip. Its a water based paint so it wont harden like enamels so as long as it actually sticks to the dip, it should come off much easier."

plastidip,2w7p6s,mango-roller,1 point,Wed Feb 18 20:27:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Nope, it's just faded. I'm thinking of getting Wipe New for the trim and  some Plasti Dip Glossifier to make it shine like new again."

plastidip,2w5541,kroon,3,Tue Feb 17 01:23:12 2015 UTC,"Since my tires are new and i want to swap out for 16"" rims down the road once i need to buy new tires i figured I would at least get rid of the plastic silver color that i hate so much.  Then i realized that door handles were the only thing chrome on the whole damn car, and i hate chrome. So both are a nice matte grey color.  I think the silvery plastic interior is going to get the same treatment in the future."
plastidip,2w5541,tbare91,1 point,Tue Feb 17 01:23:25 2015 UTC,I am interested how the dip will hold up on the handles being used.
plastidip,2w5541,code-sloth,1 point,Tue Feb 17 02:30:04 2015 UTC,On the backside there is a strip of electrical tape to give a contact point of something besides of where the dip is a bit thin.
plastidip,2w5541,Guano-,2,Tue Feb 17 15:00:27 2015 UTC,Don't see many Scions in here. I agree that the silver they used for the wheel covers and interior is ugly as sin. This summer I'm redoing my pillars and headliner to finally be rid of it everywhere.
plastidip,2w5541,code-sloth,1 point,Tue Feb 17 15:07:19 2015 UTC,After doing the small pieces it really takes me back to painting cars with my dad.   I'm thinking a matte orange for the whole thing down the the road once i get the rims i want.
plastidip,2w5541,Guano-,1 point,Tue Feb 17 15:26:29 2015 UTC,Scion xD owner. Yes those hub caps are ugly. I am definitely dipping mine soon as the weather warms a bit. I have already done my emblems in black.   Just an opinion question for you. I have a white scion. Should I go white or black with the hub caps?  I also plan to do my side mirrors black.
plastidip,2w5541,Butterblanket,1 point,Wed Feb 18 22:17:03 2015 UTC,I also have a white Scion and I opted to dip them black because it's easier to keep tidy. I'm tempted to see how white would do though after winter and road construction have passed in my area.
plastidip,2w5541,uncleawesome,1 point,Wed Feb 18 22:21:22 2015 UTC,"Looks sharp, I like that red in the front. I always think black blends to much into the tires, white just seemed like a good way to go to make it pop."

plastidip,2w4khw,Hob0d4n,2,Mon Feb 16 22:40:26 2015 UTC,"Never heard of anyone using that before. I know Naphtha is well recommended and some people use a mix of Naphtha/Xylene that's heavy on the Naphtha. IIRC the mix used in PDS is Naphtha, Toulene, and Xylene. Any reason you want to use this specific thinner? Is it the only thing available in Cali?"
plastidip,2w4khw,Call_My_Lawyer,1 point,Tue Feb 17 00:21:19 2015 UTC,"I think so? I'm not sure, stupid California laws.  I looked for thinners on Lowes and Home Depot and this was the closest substitute to Xylene. Is there another thinner that I can use in California?"
plastidip,2w4khw,SuchWastedPotential,2,Tue Feb 17 01:01:13 2015 UTC,You can't even get paint thinner in California? Here in America we use toluene to clean our floors and xylene to brush our teeth.

plastidip,2vxx7c,DarthRTFM,2,Sun Feb 15 04:41:18 2015 UTC,Rustoleum's PlastiDip from what I understand..
plastidip,2vxx7c,tuck3r53,2,Sun Feb 15 05:19:49 2015 UTC,Both are thinner than plastidip but peelcoat is thinner. Also they reccommend taking off in 3 months. It seems to lay smoother to me
plastidip,2vxx7c,DarthRTFM,1 point,Sun Feb 15 06:35:23 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I love that gunmetal look, doesn't even look like dip."
plastidip,2vxx7c,DarthRTFM,1 point,Sun Feb 15 09:11:55 2015 UTC,Tbh it isn't rubbery like dip really. It's probably more like a sprayable vinyl
plastidip,2vxx7c,dvargas1123,2,Sun Feb 15 09:36:06 2015 UTC,"That could be very awesome. It looks like it's very smooth. I want to do my wheels, and I've got pillar pieces inside that would look good on.   Thanks for the info guys!"

plastidip,2vxx7c,BZJGTO,1 point,Sun Feb 15 05:22:28 2015 UTC,I haven't seen the graphite plastidip in person but it's harder to use if it's like the other mettalizers
plastidip,2vzqtz,TheOtherAlchemy,3,Sun Feb 15 18:47:12 2015 UTC,"For fixing the peeling on your rim, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T0jEvxxTzE  Either use the dip fix it kit like Fonzie does in the video or you could use Naphtha. Just assuming it's a simple color, if you have a special pearl on it you might just want to peel and respray."
plastidip,2vzqtz,Call_My_Lawyer,1 point,Sun Feb 15 19:41:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah no, I have special color or anything. It's just a flat black with a couple coats of gloss. I'll give the kit a try and see what happens. Thanks for the tip!"
plastidip,2vzqtz,dvargas1123,2,Sun Feb 15 20:15:18 2015 UTC,"plasti dip is fine with heat, many people put it on exhausts and brake calipers with no problem.

If your garage is heated i would say about 10-15 minutes between coats, if it is cold, you should warm the cans in hot water, then allow 30-45 minutes to dry. remember to shake the cans for at least 1 minute and spray from 6-8 inches away, and do 4-5 coats, more is better!"
plastidip,2vxqqn,dvargas1123,2,Sun Feb 15 03:34:36 2015 UTC,Awesome!  Thanks!
plastidip,2vxqqn,Ezra_ILA,1 point,Sun Feb 15 03:42:12 2015 UTC,What enhancers are you throwing on the black? I did the outer plastic trim on a trailblazer that was faded from the sun i just threw like 4 coats of matte black on it and just let like 5 minutes between each coat or less since it was 75+ degrees outside and dried rather quickly. I guess it just kind of depends on the weather where you are
plastidip,2vxqqn,Ezra_ILA,1 point,Sun Feb 15 03:36:31 2015 UTC,I'm in va. I got the black for a base. The matte black.  Then I got the metalizer enhancer.  It's going on a gunmetal truck. So I thought that would look nice
plastidip,2vwvln,kumquat_juice,2,Sat Feb 14 22:03:03 2015 UTC,You can mix your own colors using the tint kit and an airbrush or Preval type sprayer. You can't really make your own aerosol cans.
plastidip,2vwvln,code-sloth,1 point,Sat Feb 14 22:14:36 2015 UTC,"Good idea. Does this mean I could pretty much to go a home depot, have them mix the colors, and set it up myself?"

plastidip,2vqyle,bainbridgeny,5,Fri Feb 13 15:31:15 2015 UTC,Looks good! Smart move going panel by panel. A lot of bad rattle can jobs come from people trying to spray the whole car at once which can get streaky but yours looks on point so far!
plastidip,2vqyle,turbo_ppsshhhh,3,Fri Feb 13 14:06:35 2015 UTC,Thanks man! For me to avoid the streakyness i found that the first 2 layers if done in very light coats will help prevent this.
plastidip,2vqyle,code-sloth,3,Fri Feb 13 15:33:06 2015 UTC,What kind of process are you doing? Looks really good for rattle cans
plastidip,2vqyle,turbo_ppsshhhh,2,Fri Feb 13 10:54:35 2015 UTC,"A slow and patient one, maybe a panel or 2 at a time starting off with obviously a good masking job (I slacked here and there as you can tell) and then for the first coat/layer I start off very light same with the second and by about maybe the 3rd or 4th coat I start to crosshatch and get only the spots that didn't get as much coverage as possible. And of course make sure you get all those edges and nooks and crannys real good. Practice makes perfect."

plastidip,2vqyle,THORGNASH,4,Fri Feb 13 14:49:10 2015 UTC,I use it with a shop towel thats durable to give the surface one more good clean if any last minute items may have gotten on there from the trip from the car wash to my house.
plastidip,2vqyle,Joethemofoe,-2,Fri Feb 13 15:36:07 2015 UTC,I'm guessing to even out screw-ups or drips. I usually go with mineral spirits but thinner works as well.
plastidip,2vqyle,THORGNASH,3,Fri Feb 13 15:22:42 2015 UTC,I did the same with my Mazda but instead of plastadip I used bed liner and I stopped halfway it looked pretty stupid
plastidip,2vqyle,Joethemofoe,3,Fri Feb 13 12:14:03 2015 UTC,"So, how did you get it off?"

plastidip,2vqyle,AngryAmuse,3,Fri Feb 13 14:50:53 2015 UTC,"How many cans would this take, Price estimate? Just curious."
plastidip,2vqyle,Bootleg_Fireworks2,3,Fri Feb 13 17:27:47 2015 UTC,"A good can per panel roughly, for me at least so no where near as much as $300 in cans. Maybe $150. If that."
plastidip,2vqyle,Fiver2,0,Fri Feb 13 21:15:55 2015 UTC,A small car probably $250-$300 in cans.
plastidip,2vqyle,Fiver2,2,Fri Feb 13 17:51:13 2015 UTC,Cool. Less than I thought.
plastidip,2vqyle,wei-long,3,Fri Feb 13 18:03:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah but for slightly more you can get a gun and gallons to spray it easier, faster, and with much better results so it really isn't worth it."
plastidip,2vqyle,mango-roller,3,Fri Feb 13 18:46:41 2015 UTC,"I have to say I agree and disagree. It all started with my hood, something different since it had very bad sunburn.

plastidip,2vm8sw,bajablazer85,22,Thu Feb 12 04:09:58 2015 UTC,"it is very very very hard to avoid streaking and you need a lot of cans. PLastidip is not like paint where you spray until the color changes, you NEED thick peelable layers. 11.5 cans = 1 gallon of product, a coupe takes 3 gallons, sedan 4, small suv 5, and large suv six. there is no way around those numbers, that is what you need to get the job done.You have a subaru forrester, that borders 4-5 gallons considering it is between a car and small SUV size. that is $322-$399 worth of cans @$7 each.  here is a $130 gun that will work with dip, and here are California certified installers that will sell you gallons of dip, 3 gallons from them is prob 60-70 each for black, so for your car thats $240.   SO For $322 - $399 you can spray-can you car and have debatable resuts or.  For $370 you can buy a gun at homedeopt, 4 gallons from a California certified installer, and do it right."

plastidip,2vm8sw,dvargas1123,1 point,Thu Feb 12 06:14:34 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely a numbers guy, and for the sake of conversation I put together a spreadsheet to factor in all the costs related for aerosol vs gallon cans.  It includes the dip, applicator (spray gun for gallons, trigger nozzles for aerosol), and shipping. This doesn't include stuff like masking tape because that's a constant with either option.    Shipping rates are to Reno, NV for the gallons where I can still legally ship them, and to my town in CA for aerosol.  The reason I chose to ship the gallons to Reno is: the California dip suppliers are all in SoCal...I'm not about to drive all the way down there for plastidip.  I would ask if they'd ship to me, but you'll see in my last paragraph why I'm not even gonna bother.  For a 3 gallon dip, I'm seeing gallons being $30-$50 more expensive.  I decided to estimate for 5 gallons to see if the theory of buying gallons (read: buy bulk) would pay off.  For a 5 gallon dip, aerosol catches up but gallons and a sprayer are still $20-$30 more expensive (I know, that's pennies when you factor quality difference).  At this point, I would choose gallons and a sprayer.  At the end of the day, I'm deciding not to dip my car at all.  Best case scenario with gallons and a sprayer is ~$350 and that's not including masking supplies.  I'm guessing I'd pay around $400 -$450 to dip my car in the color scheme I wanted to do.  To me, that's a lot of money for a plastidip paint job - but that's just my opinion."

plastidip,2vm8sw,wei-long,3,Fri Feb 13 16:15:55 2015 UTC,Every car i've seen pictures of on the DYC forum of people dipping their cars with rattle cans looks terrible. It's almost impossible to avoid streaking.
plastidip,2vm8sw,lqskins,2,Thu Feb 12 04:42:11 2015 UTC,Why can't OP get gallons in California?
plastidip,2vm8sw,wei-long,3,Thu Feb 12 14:40:07 2015 UTC,"The VOC rating of plastidip makes it so that they can's sell it in that volume in the state. Quarts would meet requirements, but the cost of manufacturing a new SKU and the higher cost ($25 or more) would not be offset by sales."
plastidip,2vm8sw,lqskins,1 point,Thu Feb 12 15:25:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% convinced it couldn't be done financially. We were able to come to $20 a quart plus shipping and still coming out ahead. Of course we weren't paying ourselves directly for the time recanning, nor was the intent to manufacture quarts, but rather to resize gallons. So that may be an issue for DYC, but I'm sure they can secure gallons and quart containers for far far less than we could.  The bigger issue is that you can't explicitly state or bundle quarts for dipping a car. You can't sell say.... a 12 quart car kit. That's specifically restricted in the quart exemption for high voc products. No bundling intended to circumvent the restriction. So DYC wouldn't be able to sell bundles of quarts in any way shape or form.   The only legal approach for quarts is to just sell them as quarts to everyone and hope that savvy California buyers figure out that the could buy any number of quarts they want just as they can aerosol cans, which could end up with a significantly smaller volume that you would want."
plastidip,2vm8sw,wei-long,2,Wed Feb 18 20:44:50 2015 UTC,"I'm basing my comments off of the first (maybe second?) dip cast where fonzie says they talked with Performix and the price would be close to $25 a quart.   Again, I'm not saying they can't do it. I'm saying if Performix thought they could make money selling a qt SKU they would.   Likely solution will be a low VOC version. That is also future-proof if  A) other states follow California's lead  B) California or other states further restrict the volume allowed at the current VOC rating."
plastidip,2vm8sw,ghostpoisonface,1 point,Wed Feb 18 21:55:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. Ultimately I would imagine it wasn't worth the hassle because the low VOC variant is just the better way to go all around. There really would be no reason at the manufacturer level to put together an assembly line for quarts when they could be putting that time, energy and capital towards low VOC product."

plastidip,2vm8sw,code-sloth,1 point,Thu Feb 12 15:27:35 2015 UTC,I tried mine with rattle cans first. I bought like 17 cans and it looked bad. You could see lines everywhere. I bought one gallon and it looks good after that. You really do need to get a sprayer
plastidip,2vm8sw,bon_mots,1 point,Thu Feb 12 15:13:45 2015 UTC,I did my 2000 camaro with 11 rattle cans of matte black. If you do rattle cans get the trigger adpater to save your fingers and to keep a consent flow.

plastidip,2vjlsx,rcthephotoman,3,Wed Feb 11 17:21:55 2015 UTC,Well just take a razor blade the the outer edge and then peel it off. I also think the emblem should show. It would pop more. Just look at the Explorer with the black grill. It looks sharp!

plastidip,2vjlsx,mango-roller,1 point,Thu Feb 12 13:28:50 2015 UTC,"I left it on, there is lots of space behind it.. so I worked a trashbag in behind the stuff, sort of how you work a bag behind a rim to spray it while its still on the car.  You just have to be very careful that the bag doesn't touch the back end of the rim, or the plastidip will stick to it, also make sure the dip is fully dry before trying to feed the bag back through the grill."

plastidip,2v4x00,Pedalphiles,3,Sun Feb 8 05:18:27 2015 UTC,"Could be, but I could've swore it was completely dry. It does make sense though. And I think my fix for the problem is getting plastidip and trying it out again."
plastidip,2v4x00,Pedalphiles,2,Sun Feb 8 13:10:19 2015 UTC,"Haha that was my fix too, it just didn't spray the same at all and came out a very different color than I expected. I got the red flexidip and it was a true orange when I applied it. I'll stick with the proven plastidip for now!"
plastidip,2v4x00,jdalty,5,Sun Feb 8 14:05:05 2015 UTC,"The reason you got those results is because I can clearly see that you did not: apply even coats, LET IT DRY, or prep your surface at all.  The same results you have received can be found in plastidip if you follow the same steps."
plastidip,2v4x00,Experiencestuff,1 point,Sun Feb 8 06:29:24 2015 UTC,"I know what you are seeing, however I took the pictures after trying to fix the problem many different ways, I initially was doing even coats up until the 4th when this started, then just soaked a few spots once I was resolved to having to peel it all off anyway.

plastidip,2v4x00,Fiver2,5,Sun Feb 8 09:53:37 2015 UTC,"What happened here was not the fault of the dip. This happens when the dip has dried to fast. So for instance, if you sprayed black dip on a red car that has been in the sun and left it to dry in the sun, this would happen."
plastidip,2v4x00,sammygirl1228,2,Sun Feb 8 01:59:10 2015 UTC,"Hmm, could be. I mean I'm in Florida on a patio, no ""direct"" sunlight, and I think the high today was only low 70's, not to mention I had the spoiler (which was what I was painting) off of the car for at least a few hours. I thought it would've been perfect since that's what the can itself stated as ideal temps for drying. But I could definitely see that being a cause."

plastidip,2v7327,midcut03,2,Sun Feb 8 15:20:30 2015 UTC,"Dip isn't nearly as reflective, but lighter colored surfaces will cast a reflection on the windshield that can be distracting while driving. Stick with a darker shade of dip (black, silver, navy blue, etc) and you shouldn't have any issues. I've dipped a small part of my dash white and I have a white toy car that sits in front of the steering wheel, but I couldn't imagine dipping the entire dash a bright color.  It's light that goes from dipped surface > windshield > eyes that you have to worry about, not dipped surface > eyes. Hopefully that makes sense."
plastidip,2v7327,code-sloth,1 point,Sun Feb 8 18:58:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. It's not a very reflective finish at all, satin at best, but bright colors could be an issue. I have the front part of my dash taken out of my car to be dipped, but it's the part that faces me, and won't reflect in the windshield, so it shouldn't be a problem.   Stick with the darker, less visually distracting colors, and you should be fine."
plastidip,2v7327,Harmonic_Content,1 point,Sun Feb 8 21:02:56 2015 UTC,"Any color other than a dark gray or black will likely reflect, but if you stick to a dark color it'll work great. I dipped the dash in my Miata black and it's held up to the sun and a large amount of dust without much complaint, save for a singular, tiny heat bubble that's welled up over the course of a year during a hot Texas summer.  That being said, the reflectiveness of the black dip isn't much different from an unpainted dash in either direction, so it's neither a gain or loss."

As for other ideas, the charger's body lines are awesome and really work well with dip, you can dip the indents on the hood, along the scallops in the doors, spoiler, roof, front grill, anything. here is the hood indents and body scallops done. You can also fill in those hood indents like this this one laso has that lower section of the bumper and the grill dipped.  Also if he has a black charger you can do the mopar stripe, starting in 2011 dodge offered a mopar edition charger with this stripe  You could also do the grill and lower grill to liik like this   ALso, those 2 stripes over the front fender are poplar on Dodges and you can also try this back stripe as well here  I know you said he doesnt want to paint the badges but black badges in the bif led tail light looks awesome here"

plastidip,2v2bxa,MikeOxMALLbro,3,Sat Feb 7 04:57:06 2015 UTC,"Depends what color you're planning to do and what color your car is now. A dark dip on a light colored car requires more coats, so a gallon would be a good place to start. PlastiDip's site says 4-5 coats on any size vehicle is recommended and makes it easier to peel off because it's thicker and more dense. That said, I have no idea how many gallons an SUV would take, but for multiple coats I'd buy at least two gallons, then 1 gallon of a pearlizer or glossifier for the top coat if you're going that route.  PlastiDip 's site says you can dip in any weather, but I would say to at least do it in weather above freezing. Paint doesn't adhere well to cold surfaces.  This might help - link to FAQs on their website I see they're having a 20% off sale now until Sunday at midnight, so it's a good time to buy.  Also, take before and after pics!"

plastidip,2v2bxa,code-sloth,1 point,Sat Feb 7 20:08:32 2015 UTC,"A chevy equinox will need between 4 and 5 gallons according to the dip chart Since this will be your first experience on a whole car I recomend buying 5, if you mess up its much easieer to peel 5 gallons than 4. Plus, you will want it thocker to stand up better against the elements and it provides more durability.   The whole job shoud take 2 days becase you HAVE to wash you car the day before and let it dry COMPLETELY. you dont want any moisture or any places moisture gathers will lok like this   the second day you should blow out all the crevaces with compressed air or use the turbine on the DYC gun, then prep, mask off windows and lights, cover the rims, and spray, that shoud take about 2-3 hours"

plastidip,2v2bxa,code-sloth,0,Sun Feb 8 03:26:19 2015 UTC,"Optimal weather? Not super cold or super hot/dry. Folks have dipped from 40F all the way up to 100F. If you're comfortable being out in whatever weather it is for 30 minutes at a time, you can probably dip in it.  How long would it take? I set aside an entire day for prepping and dipping a full vehicle. Your first will always take the longest. After you learn from it you can pick up the little things and get quicker/better."

plastidip,2uedx0,dvargas1123,1 point,Sun Feb 1 17:06:44 2015 UTC,I'll make a new post with some photos of the car and how bad it is when I get some. Thanks heaps for help and input!
plastidip,2uedx0,dvargas1123,1 point,Mon Feb 2 03:02:49 2015 UTC,no problem!
plastidip,2uedx0,dvargas1123,2,Mon Feb 2 03:14:27 2015 UTC,Alright so I've encountered a problem..  dipyourcar.com don't seem to ship to Australia. Bummer.  Went to local auto store asked about gallon worth of paint $150 per gallon.. Uhh Nope.  But he said he could do a deal with me - 8 cans of plastidip + the spray gun attachment ($29.99 per can) for $200 Is it still worth plastidipping it with the cans?
plastidip,2uedx0,dvargas1123,1 point,Tue Feb 3 04:08:38 2015 UTC,"uuuhhh.. it depends on your skill-set. I have seen a few good results with cans, but many bad results also. this was done with cans, however, so was this so for $200 its a lot of a risk, but again in the end, if you mes sup, itll peel off. Now make sure you do enough coats. I would use a rule of thumb that 1 coat with a can is half that of a gallon. So normaly cars need 4-5 coats, with cans i would suggest 8-10 coats. With 50% overlap on each.Also, 8 cans is not enough ot do a whole car.. a whole car needs like 20+ cans. If you were to just do the problem areas, ex. hood roof trunk (if they are the poblem areas) it may be enough to cover.  Also, i know dipyourcar.com has a secial spray nozzel, it sprays a wider patern which would help cover larger surfaces faster and more evenly. Idk if you have acess to that in Australia but if you do it is like $1. Best of luck either way!  Edit: also warm your cans in hot water no matter the temperature outside, here is a video showing the difference in spray"
plastidip,2uedx0,dvargas1123,2,Tue Feb 3 04:20:44 2015 UTC,oh okay..  I had a chat to the guy and he told me that a friend of his did his nissan wagon (larger car) and he did it with 18 cans. Although he painted over the windows and that.  So I think 8-10 cans for a smaller car like a mx-5 will do the job. yeah I have learnt a lot of tips and tricks whilst doing my research :P
plastidip,2uedx0,SuchWastedPotential,2,Tue Feb 3 05:07:28 2015 UTC,"for an mx-5 you could probly do 8 cans if you have a convertable, but again, focus on any bad areas 1st. But also find out f anybody can get gallons there, you can use full strength gallons to dip a car, you just mix 1 gallon dip to 1 gallon thinner. puzzelman on youtube does that almost exclusivly. Also, here is the plastidip Australia facebook page https://www.facebook.com/PlastiDipAU maybe you can find something better, i see a deal he has $25 each or 4 for $80 which would be cheaper than what you found, also there is this where they are $20/can then shipping  hope this helps!"
plastidip,2uedx0,code-sloth,2,Tue Feb 3 05:24:25 2015 UTC,yeah the problem with that is the gallons of plastidip are like $150+ and it would need 2-3 gallons for the car.  So i guess getting the plastidip as cheap as possible would be ideal!
plastidip,2uedx0,Experiencestuff,1 point,Tue Feb 3 06:09:08 2015 UTC,"yes but 1 gallon of full srenth dip yields 2 gallons of sprayable dip. you pour the full strength into a 5 gallon bucket then mix in 1 gallon of thinner, that makes it 2 gallons of sprayable liquid, and for 150 and the gun itll yield the best result"
plastidip,2udfv3,_pollos,3,Sun Feb 1 03:29:18 2015 UTC,"Do black as the base, and depending on the size of the bike I'm going to guess around 4 cans of black and one or two of the chameleon. You don't have to layer the ""pretty"" top coat heavily since the black base will be solid enough."
plastidip,2udfv3,code-sloth,3,Sun Feb 1 15:08:27 2015 UTC,"You'll lose most of the cans to overspray, since all of the surfaces are round tubes. I did a set of mountain bike wheels (just the rims) and used 1 can on each to get 4 coats."

plastidip,2u9myr,RussianHoneyBadger,2,Sat Jan 31 14:24:21 2015 UTC,I think he also dipped the trim that runs from his mirrors up to the top of the windows. Probably figured that it was easier to just cover the whole thing just in case.

plastidip,2u9myr,MCCornflake1,-1,Fri Feb 20 22:33:42 2015 UTC,"Nice look, OP. But you really didn't need to cover the whole car like that. Nice thing about dip is even if you get overspray on the fender, it wipes right off."
plastidip,2u9myr,ocarr23,9,Sat Jan 31 12:40:05 2015 UTC,Maybe he wanted to see what black rims would look like on it before he shelled out to get painted rims.
plastidip,2u9myr,ElectronicFlesh,6,Sat Jan 31 04:16:12 2015 UTC,There is absolutely nothing wrong with that? There are dipped Ferraris and Bentleys. Dip isn't for cheap people or anything. Maybe this guy is just protecting his stock rims?

plastidip,2u3rtt,JDChesser56,4,Thu Jan 29 19:42:36 2015 UTC,"2 coats of black for the base. after that dries you need to get one of those cabinet liners (sell at supermarkets for $5) cover the area with the liner and spray a light coat of gunmetal grey and then a light coat of silver metalizer (1 light coat each, otherwise you will seep through the material and ruin the pattern) remove the liner immediately after applying the coat of metalizer. Let dry and then apply coats of glossifier until the achieved look is reached."

plastidip,2u23oo,CryoSage,1 point,Thu Jan 29 10:39:53 2015 UTC,I'm considering doing this to my suzuki. How much dip did you use for your bike?  And have you had any problems with it rubbing off in the tank/balls area?
plastidip,2u23oo,cpt_fart,3,Thu Jan 29 14:02:09 2015 UTC,"I did this with rattle cans. I used 6 cans of the cobalt blue base to get about four layers. I should have used 7 or 8 cans to get a more even application. Pay close attention to the edges and make sure you know which parts of the fairings have their inside visible (my side fairings are visible from the tank, and the back of the front fairing above the gauge cluster. biggest mistakes I made).  I used two cans of metalizer for the two coats. And three cans of glossifier for the 4 coats I used. Then finished everything off with the dip spray/wax from dipyourcar.com.  I'll probably peel it off in 2 or so months and redo it. I learned a lot from the first time around, so the second time should be better. Trust me, the bike looks worse in person. The angle I posted was carefully chosen.   I just did it earlier this week, so I don't have many comments on durability of leg/crotch areas rubbing it. It does catch my jeans more noticeably. I expect it could last up to a year if you are careful, otherwise at least 6 months. The dip spray for protection is a must. It makes it shiny and slick.  Also, peel any masking/painter's tape BEFORE the final coat dries. I ruined my tank with this mistake."
plastidip,2u23oo,cpt_fart,3,Fri Jan 30 04:42:08 2015 UTC,"I bought the dip from dipyourcar.com on the black friday sale. I spent roughly $100 on the whole thing by the end.  For prep, I removed the fairings and just washed them off. Didn't sand anything."

plastidip,2tzo6v,maxfic,4,Wed Jan 28 18:52:37 2015 UTC,"Throw some cheap tarps or plastic down under the car, it will be easier than trying to clean the floor when you are done.  With the cramped sides, be careful not to drag the hose or extension cord across the car when you are trying to work in there.  If you have a helper, have them keep your cords out of the way so you can focus on spraying.  I've had my lights closer to the car than that.  Never hurt anything."
plastidip,2tzo6v,tubetraveller,1 point,Wed Jan 28 20:46:20 2015 UTC,This is huge. Keep the air hose away from the hood /trunk as you walk around. The corners are where I usually bump with the hose.   With that tight of space you'll want to walk the length of the car facing fore/aft with the gun in front of you spraying to the side in order to get enough distance between the gun and the car.   Definitely lay something down on the floor. Might want to do the walls to the height of the car if you are worried about overspray.   Good luck and let us know how it turns out.
plastidip,2tzo6v,timewasterextreme,1 point,Wed Jan 28 21:12:47 2015 UTC,"Make sure you get a good mask. The cheap dollar ones aren't good enough. You can get a 3m respirator from Lowes for about 30, and they are totally worth it. Having the light on will be helpful to see and shouldn't affect the drying, so don't worry about that. As for the space on the sides of your garage, it does look pretty cramped, but it should be enough to maneuver yourself and your gun around to spray"

plastidip,2tthh5,ItsTotallyObvious,7,Tue Jan 27 07:14:56 2015 UTC,"Plasti dip is gonna run a significant amount cheaper than paint, but at the moment you're not going to get the super glossy sheen like you do from paint and clear coat (though I guess that's being addressed early this year).  Plasti dip,  as you know, will be nice and let you try out a lot of different colors easily and removes without any damage to the underlying body work, unfortunately, that also means if you have to drive in some rough environments (off road where the big rocks live) it's subject to being torn or damaged, though given the car type, it's unlikely.   Please note, I'm new to dipping myself, so take my answers with a grain of salt. I do not claim to be an expert, and if anything I said is wrong, feel free to correct me, I like learning new things."

plastidip,2tthh5,Harmonic_Content,2,Tue Jan 27 08:40:28 2015 UTC,"The points he makes are good ones. PlastiDip is cheaper than paint by a mile, more forgiving to apply as an amateur, easier to repair if there are scratches or tears, and will protect the paint underneath. It's easy to remove and reapply if a mistake is made, and if you don't live in CA, there are a ton of options available for pearls and other custom color/finish combinations. The high gloss top coat from Dipyourcar.com looks pretty shiny, which is coming out soon, but is still not as shiny as a good paint + clear will get you.

plastidip,2tthh5,timewasterextreme,1 point,Tue Jan 27 13:17:22 2015 UTC,"If you are looking to customize the look of your car, nothing beats it. It's about 1/3 the cost of having it wrapped in a single color vinyl (if you have someone spray it for you).  You do need to lay it down pretty thick to get the longevity and durability out of it. Also putting it down thicker helps when its time to remove it as it will mostly come off in one big peel/section.  Don't let mechanics with greasy hands fondle it (especially the lighter colors), don't get gas or other organic solvents on it, don't run it into any chain-link fences or drive on trails with lots of scratchy branches!  Other than that common sense stuff, its great!! I'm on my second full dip on my truck and my coworker has dipped his car 5 times now!"
plastidip,2tthh5,DickNervous,3,Tue Jan 27 13:56:51 2015 UTC,"Plasti-Dip Pros:   Much cheaper than paint Less prep work required. Basically needs to be smooth and clean but not to the extreme you need with paint. Plasti-Dip is thick (compared to paint) so it will hide a lot of things that paint will highlight.  If you don't like the color, peel it off.  Much easier to clean up mistakes or overspray Easy to fix if it gets scratched or you mess up.  If you don't feel comfortable doing it there are ""shops"" popping up all over the place that will do it for you at a fraction of the cost of a typical automotive paint job.   Plasti-Dip Cons:   Somewhat limited selection of colors compared to paint unless you mix it yourself.  Currently can't get that super-smooth, super-shiny look you do with paint, but they are working on that.  Not quite as durable as professional paint job with a clear coat (but as stated above, much cheaper to fix) Upon a close inspection nobody is going to mistake it for a ""real paint job"", but honestly, who cares if it looks good.    Bottom line is that unless you are planning on entering the car into auto shows that are based 100% on cosmetic looks, there is no real reason NOT to try Plasti-Dip.   The absolute worst case scenario is that you absolutely hate it and want to get a ""standard"" automotive paint job. If that happens you will be out a few hundred bucks (tops) that you spent on the Plasti-Dip. But I have used Plasti-Dip (as a complete novice to painting cars) and seen what it looks like when done right. I will be shocked if you do the Plasti-Dip and decide that it's not good enough."

Make sure you get someone who knows how to tune this engine, these engines are tricky to tune and if you tune it like a normal car you can run into some serious issues. If you haven't upgraded the charge piping, that is a recommended upgrade as the higher boost can cause the stock ones to pop off pretty easy. ZZP is the site I recommend for getting stuff."

I've done it in cold weather with and without keeping the cans warm; it makes a huge difference in how it sprays. When they were cold it came out thick, and chunked up the nozzle. With warming up the cans it sprayed normally. Just keep an eye on the spray distance for texture, you may have to adjust based on the outside temperature. The drying time will also take longer between coats, but it's doable."

It came out looking just like a real paint finish and he was able to peel it off after. His work was on a flat piece about 12"" square so I don't know how the peeling would translate to a wheel. I imagine if you keep the real paint thin enough it will peel just fine.   Hope that helps. If it doesn't peel you can just use dip dissolver or goo gone to get the dip off."

plastidip,2sy5zt,TOWN_CLERK,1 point,Mon Jan 19 21:11:03 2015 UTC,"While I can't comment on gold, I've done a thick coats of black dip, then went overtop with a satin black spray paint a few times because the PD black turns to gray after a while.  This was on a plastic, chrome clad section of a grill, as well as on my spoiler; it came out kind of pebbly, but I went over it with a rag and ""sanded"" it to a flat finish.  After that I was really happy with the results, and held up through 2 winters before I changed to another grill; it peels a bit harder, in that it sometimes comes off in small bits or will be tougher to pull at - when it comes off in bits though it seems like you need to pick at it 60 times before you get a bigger peel off (so satisfying).  Haven't tried GooGone or anything yet.  I've also tried PD + a satin black paint/primer mixture. This gave it a much more textured feel to it, almost like bed liner but nowhere near as rough or noticeable if that makes sense.   I tried this method on my winter wheels with a gloss black, and when up close it looks orange peeled in some spots  Clear coat on it is fine too, but ended up making it look a bit dusty, or slighty frosted or something; made no difference when I peeled that off too  I think if you try testing it, it wont be that bad - but using dip on dip is always gonna give the best results"

plastidip,2s2ruq,AmIStonedOrJustStupi,2,Sun Jan 11 17:58:05 2015 UTC,You can try the non-spray dip and a small brush like one that would be used for nail polish.  A non-dip possible solution would be to get a cheap tool drawer liner or something and some spray adhesive. Use an Xacto knife and then apply. That would be a much bigger pain tho.
plastidip,2s2ruq,RevRagnarok,0,Mon Jan 12 01:48:46 2015 UTC,"You could try spraying the board with glossifier, but it looks like a really sharp image on a foldable board, so you'd wind up with a frosted board that peels as soon as you fold it :/  The pieces are too small to really spray, but you could possibly put rubber feet on the bottoms so they're not as easily nudged.  If you wanted to go balls out, mount the board to a metal sheet (or have it printed onto a metal sheet) and put magnets on the game pieces. That won't budge for sure."
plastidip,2s2ruq,code-sloth,1 point,Sun Jan 11 18:56:31 2015 UTC,"You could try spraying the board with glossifier, but it looks like a really sharp image on a foldable board, so you'd wind up with a frosted board that peels as soon as you fold it :/   Actually, the player boards don't fold so do you think the surface would be non-slip like I'm looking for?

plastidip,2s2ruq,code-sloth,1 point,Sun Jan 11 23:16:57 2015 UTC,"That could work, though any dip is going to give a frosted appearance so the board's image could become distorted or less detailed. Those numbers look really tiny."

plastidip,2rz1fs,WoodlandFox,1 point,Sat Jan 10 22:09:46 2015 UTC,"Tough to answer. I've gotten to the point, after 8 dips, that I mask very minimally, mostly just windows. That usually takes an hour, if I didn't each the truck that morning. With a helper to mix and refill cups of day it took a about 4 hours to do.   We can usually do the truck and a car in the same day if I have my tent set up and my truck masked the night before."

plastidip,2rwru9,Nathan002,1 point,Fri Jan 9 23:25:22 2015 UTC,"put the cans in warm water, as long as the dip is warm it willvspray fine. Drying times should be adjusted to about 45 minutes btw coats tho.."
plastidip,2rwru9,dvargas1123,1 point,Sat Jan 10 19:24:47 2015 UTC,"The dip temperature is only a small part. The air and surface temperature matters too. Too hot or too cold, the solvent flashing process gets messed up and you can get strings when you lay it down. Plus if the air or car is too cold, you can get runs and drips and drying times are much longer."
plastidip,2rwru9,at_spaces_end,1 point,Wed Jan 14 14:41:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly you can but i wouldn't. Drying time in between each layer will be 40-60 mins. i always do at least 4 layers. so that's over 4 hours of work. For the best looking job i would wait for a day where it's 70 deg or above. Also try not to do it on a day where it just rained. The dryer the air, the better."
plastidip,2rwru9,coolkid1717,1 point,Mon Jan 12 17:41:19 2015 UTC,"If you're dipping outside, I'd try and wait. The cold makes the solvents in the dip flash much. This is also why you can get runs and drips in cold weather. If you're dipping in a garage make sure the air temp is between 65-70 degrees F. Same goes for your car. Doesn't make much sense to have a warm garage if your car has been sitting in the cold right up until you spray."
plastidip,2rwru9,at_spaces_end,1 point,Wed Jan 14 14:45:35 2015 UTC,Yes. I dipped my car twice in 30 degree weather and it came out great. Its just takes longer to dry.
plastidip,2rwru9,Blackg0ld,0,Thu Jan 15 05:22:20 2015 UTC,"Can you?  I just...I had to make the pun. I am not sorry.  Anyway, yes it's possible to dip in the cold but I wouldn't recommend it. Dip gets weird in the cold and takes longer to dry, which means it can drip and shift more. Plus your fingers go numb, which makes it difficult. Cold air is usually pretty dry too, so spraying can be hit/miss if it gets stringy mid-air.  So while yes you technically can, and some folks have gotten good results with it, I wouldn't. Save dipping for warmer weather."
plastidip,2rwru9,code-sloth,0,Fri Jan 9 23:42:49 2015 UTC,"I live in freezing cold...Iowa and am planning on dipping my shit.

Would this be a waste of money?"
plastidip,2rwru9,timewasterextreme,1 point,Sat Jan 10 08:16:52 2015 UTC,Also make sure the car itself is warm. Doesn't matter if the paint and air are warm if the steel car is still frozen.
plastidip,2rwru9,code-sloth,0,Sat Jan 10 17:02:04 2015 UTC,If the garage is reasonably warm (around 60 or so) it should be fine.
plastidip,2rwru9,at_spaces_end,1 point,Sat Jan 10 13:55:54 2015 UTC,"As long as the car is the same temperature, otherwise the heat energy that would go towards the solvents flashing will get sucked into the car and your dip will take forever to dry/cure."

plastidip,2rnykx,coolkid1717,1 point,Fri Jan 9 00:55:47 2015 UTC,"I had a friend who was charging $100 for all 4 wheels. And people were paying thinking that was cheap. If you don't tell people how easy it is, they assume it's hard because it looks so well done.  He would do 4-5 heavy coats per wheel. And if they wanted a color other than black or silver he did 2 heavy base coats of matte black."
plastidip,2rnykx,alphadetailing,0,Mon Jan 12 17:45:39 2015 UTC,"Not really a crazy price considering it is 1-2 hours of work, and I'm assuming your friend was supplying all of the necessary materials."

plastidip,2rnykx,coolkid1717,1 point,Sun Jan 18 23:26:17 2015 UTC,"You'll be fine doing it yourself. Its really easy. If you find after you spray a layer that it looks splotchy with little dribbles, don't worry. The paint naturally will level out and it will dry even. Though if you do notice that the can is not spraying a fine mist then the paint could be too cold. A trick is to put the cans in warm water in between sprays. Warm paint sprays much better."

plastidip,2ri3zn,THORGNASH,3,Tue Jan 6 12:49:18 2015 UTC,"If you put it on right, it should peel off. Albeit, OP may want to put it on a bit thicker cause it does tend to grip matte finishes a little stronger."
plastidip,2ri3zn,lqskins,1 point,Tue Jan 6 14:25:04 2015 UTC,As long as its a year old it should be completely cured and shouldn't be a problem.
plastidip,2ri3zn,Fiver2,3,Tue Jan 6 13:34:20 2015 UTC,What? Powder coat is done immediately after the bake  The dip won't do anything to powder coat   Powder coat is more durable than normal paint
plastidip,2ri3zn,VDuBivore,1 point,Wed Jan 7 02:00:40 2015 UTC,"Ture, but I always say a year for any coating because I don't know the circumstances it was applied under. Powder coating itself is hardened immediately after its cured in the oven but that doesn't mean that its adherence to the metal created a good bond. So a year guarantees that any bad coating job would have failed by then. I imagine a scenario where I tell someone ""its fine"" but the bad coating job is blamed on Plastidip instead."

plastidip,2r7tti,marteroth,5,Sat Jan 3 17:31:15 2015 UTC,"Looks like an interesting plan. I would advise against using the Blaze green (or any Blaze colors, really) because it will fade from UV exposure and look splotchy and weird after a month or two. The Full Spectrum colors were developed as a replacement and they're still pretty bright. My car for reference.  Dip gets weird during temperature swings. When it's cold, it takes a longer time to dry, which can make wet coats produce an unsightly ripple effect if the layer of dip is on  vertical surface (wet dip slowly shifts down and makes a line like slathered paint). If you're careful you can avoid it, but you might want to take the wheels off the vehicle to dip them and minimize that effect.  Keep the cans warm (putting them in hot water helps!) and the spray itself should be fine. Don't neglect to keep your own fingers warm either - spraying when numbness is creeping up your wrist either from being cold or being strained makes for crappy motor skills and a crappy dip job. Fingerless gloves are handy.  For the matte black part, you could actually spray clear instead since you have a black vehicle. It'll make a frosted effect, which will appear matte on paint. DYC reference here"
plastidip,2r7tti,code-sloth,1 point,Sat Jan 3 17:39:45 2015 UTC,I like that clear frost idea. I may do that at some point. My Mazda is all blacked out and I think the Friday look would be sick.

plastidip,2qvz7h,ImperialAgent,2,Wed Dec 31 06:41:44 2014 UTC,"I didn't use glossifier, it's probably because it's new? I've read that you can shine up plasti dip with spray wax and some even use tire shine. I did 5-6 coats. Wanted to make sure I could peel it lol."

plastidip,2qvz7h,Geoffmp2012,1 point,Wed Dec 31 18:18:03 2014 UTC,I guess it would depend on how many coats you do. it's water based and not oil based like armor is. My plasti-dip doesn't look to bad afterwards. Although that stuff is very expensive for cleaner but it has UV protection which is nice.
plastidip,2qvz7h,ImperialAgent,1 point,Wed Dec 31 18:50:34 2014 UTC,Looks like they used the glossifier

plastidip,2quoho,ImperialAgent,1 point,Wed Dec 31 18:01:57 2014 UTC,"Yeah that purple with that silver isn't very complimentary, especially if there aren't many accents on the car it self.

plastidip,2quoho,mango-roller,1 point,Wed Dec 31 18:07:18 2014 UTC,Absolutely not black - that's too much contrast. The tires are black enough. I do think a gold or bronze dip would do wonders for this car's rims.

I wasn't entirely sure how it would turn out but the colors seem to work. I'll probably go back to black in a couple months because I really like that look but this is a nice look too.
plastidip,2quj6f,coolkid1717,1 point,Wed Dec 31 04:14:34 2014 UTC,Thank you for not doing black. Black rims on a black car = too much black.

plastidip,2quj6f,coolkid1717,1 point,Sun Jan 18 03:37:51 2015 UTC,Love the color. I always get excited when i see a car with dipped rims other than black or silver. I did mine metallic blue a little over a year ago. I do think you went a little overboard with 6 base coats of black. For mine i just did 2 heavy coats of black and then 4.5 coats of metallic blue and it was fine. Also a tip. Put a UV protectant spray on it. My blue has faded noticeably after a year and a half with it on. It's doesn't look bad it's just that as it faded it got darker and less metallic looking.
plastidip,2quj6f,coolkid1717,1 point,Mon Jan 12 18:07:13 2015 UTC,"It's only six coats of black because they were dipped black for a couple months prior and when I did this I added a coat to the existing dip.

plastidip,2qo0vr,reddRad,2,Mon Dec 29 01:56:58 2014 UTC,"Problem is, you can't just spray a small area as a patch. There's no way PlastiDip will match any paint. It's better than rust, or whatever you've got there, but if you want it to look better, you'll want to do the whole hood. If you're going to change the hood eventually anyway, why not just spray paint it?"

plastidip,2qhvyk,JoelAtWar,5,Sat Dec 27 02:15:19 2014 UTC,Masking and peeling when wet would probably be your best bet.
plastidip,2qhvyk,Renegradenick,6,Sat Dec 27 03:04:01 2014 UTC,Buying black vinyl would be a lot easier
plastidip,2qhvyk,Ryurain,5,Sat Dec 27 06:44:10 2014 UTC,"that's exactly what I was thinking. black vinyl would cover that in a few minutes. no overspray, no taping, no mess."
plastidip,2qhvyk,greenbabyshit,3,Sat Dec 27 08:45:47 2014 UTC,I'm working on a friend's Lexus GS300. He wants all the chrome gone. This chrome lip on the front is almost flush with the red part. If I just dip and peel off of the red paint I'm sure it will take it off of the chrome as well. So I'm considering dipping it and then scoring it with a razor blade  before I peel OR masking right to the edge of the chrome and then peeling the tape while it's wet.
plastidip,2qhvyk,rlsands1997,1 point,Sat Dec 27 02:17:41 2014 UTC,Tape along the border between the chrome and the red paint so there will be an edge and you can easily peel excess.
plastidip,2qhvyk,reppinthe509,2,Sat Dec 27 03:07:21 2014 UTC,I think since its flush with a very small gap this method won't work well.
plastidip,2qhvyk,rlsands1997,1 point,Sat Dec 27 05:55:51 2014 UTC,Well that's what he went with.
plastidip,2qhvyk,xRockerr,6,Sun Dec 28 17:24:49 2014 UTC,"Like the previous comments suggest. Mask off all the red area, then spray the chrome, and peel the tape off right after you spray. You will have to mask off the area each time you apply a coat, but its the only way to get clean lines."
plastidip,2qhvyk,AMACop_YouIdiot,3,Sat Dec 27 03:27:30 2014 UTC,Copy that. Thanks
plastidip,2qhvyk,wangstar,6,Sat Dec 27 03:48:12 2014 UTC,"That's the best method. tape a super clean line (err on the side of paint, it's better to cover some paint than to leave chrome exposed) and peel right after your last coat."
plastidip,2qhvyk,coolkid1717,7,Sat Dec 27 04:46:08 2014 UTC,"Key word last coat. You don't need to peel each time, plasti-dip re-liquifies the layers underneath it, so you should only need to peel once."
plastidip,2qhvyk,Yellowlime1029,3,Sat Dec 27 10:42:21 2014 UTC,just make sure to give it about 10 seconds or so to get to all of the layers
plastidip,2qhvyk,samydlight,1 point,Sat Dec 27 17:16:30 2014 UTC,My friend tried to do his chrome. The paint wouldn't adhere well and he eventually gave up.
plastidip,2qhvyk,Yellowlime1029,1 point,Mon Jan 12 18:20:11 2015 UTC,"If there's a space between the chrome and the red you could leave a little room on the red and spray the amount of coats you normally would into the the red as well. After your done and it's dry, peel the part on the red and if there is a space between the chrome and red, it will peel clean. I've done it a million times and its key to dipping clean.   Edit: is there any particular reason this got downvoted?"
plastidip,2qhvyk,bjones83,2,Sat Dec 27 08:31:12 2014 UTC,Why did this get down-voted. This is the Actual proper way to do this without peeling the chrome part.   you need to leave a little red so that you have enough plastidip that you can pull off. If you mask it ALL you will have the crevasse filled with dip and it'll show.   these guys call themselves Proffesionals. Link i dont know how to start it at 2:10 but start there and watch.
