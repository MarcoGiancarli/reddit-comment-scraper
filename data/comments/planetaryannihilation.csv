The Uber notes are usually poorly organised, with almost everything included under Polish/Bugfix regardless of what it's for. We prefer to reorganise this so you can find updates in areas of real interest to you. We'll normally summarize what the updates are and draw attention to anything of interest. Where new elements such as maps or Commanders are introduced we'll include an overview of them. For new gameplay features we'll look to include a video. We add additional items to the notes as discovered by the community, be it known issues not included in the official list or changes of interest to modders not noted by Uber. We link back to the official thread as well, so even if you don't want any of the items we offer it's literally only one additional click. We link to what a PTE is and how to install it, something Uber haven't always done. The link to the PTE guide in the official thread wasn't there at the time the thread was created.   I don't see it as self-promotion, we genuinely try to offer value above and beyond what Uber provide."

And symlinking is fixed, cursor is fixed, crashes seem rare. I'm not sure what you mean with lighting, though there is an AMD brightness bug going around, but that includes Windows users.

That obviously didn't happen but that's mostly to blamed on Iran meddling with Iraq and on Iraqis themselves. Sorry for all your wasted tax dollars and for the Americans that lost their lives.  Internet in Iraq is most free than most countries in the region. But unfortunately there are indicators that this is slowly changing.  Also Internet in Iraq is very poor in terms of performance and bandwidth (with the exception of Kurdistant region). This is due heavy reliance on wireless as a last mile medium as a proper telecom infrastructure is practically nonexistant.

Obviously the game has been patched several times since release and I believe all the features that people wanted in the 1.0 version are now in. In that reguard the game has ""recovered"" beautifully.   If you are referring to the reviews/community (they are kinda linked) then it's a slightly different story. At the time of me typing this, the steam reviews are at mixed, with only 69% (heh) positive reviews. In addition, many of the negative gaming press reviews of the original 1.0 release version remain unchanged, which does the game a great disservice.   Additions like a ranked ladder and single player have broadened the appeal of the game, yet I fear many don't even give it the light of day due to the lingering negative reviews. At this point there isn't much we can do, but the modding potential and niche audience means there's a good chance this game will keep a dedicated community for a while to come, and we can only hope it grows bigger and better with things like steam sales.  that answer your question OP?"

Game needs soul to atract players.   ""Mindless robots continue their programming to do war for ever and because of them there are no more civilizations/interesting-things ANYWHERE in the galaxy""    huge, massive Yawn. The most boring setting ever. Why would mindless drones fighting each other for no reason and no goal be interesting?  Why are we fighting? oh no reason, because boom and boom is cool and lets smash planets because thats awesome. And while all that really is cool, if we are just doing it for it's own sake it becomes boring way to fast.  The game needs a campaign. Conquer the galaxy mode is nice but the game mostly needs a campaign with a story thatmakes us care for some of the systems we are fighting in. Planets do not feel like worlds at all but like pointless billiard balls I care nothing about. It might as well have been a bunch flat featureless maps connected by warp portals.  How about adding in biological civilizations that started recovering after the grand robot wars? maybe have multiple tiers of civ. Tribal, medievil, industrial, space age. But never as advanced as the robots. maybe have a game mode where is to protect them and their homeworld until they advanced to the point of space age."

planetaryannihilation,3ca1ba,typtyphus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:43:52 2015 UTC,It's the same game.  Just with a story and compelling singleplayer mechanics.  Does no-one wonder why the commanders woke up in the first place?
planetaryannihilation,3ca1ba,Pag_Elodea,10,Mon Jul 6 22:24:05 2015 UTC,"Since when do we need a reason to blow up stuff? I personally don't think a campaign will attract players. Look at Grey Goo it has a campaign and is newer then PA and has even less active players then PA.  But anyways, the game is still getting better every patch, multiplayer is fun, there are fun mods. Sure things could be better. But Uber is still an Indie Dev not like Blizzard. They made a pretty awesome game from scratch in a small timeframe and a small budget."
planetaryannihilation,3ca1ba,PRoeleert,2,Mon Jul 6 16:30:37 2015 UTC,"Grey goo's failure had not much do to with the campaign.  SC2 has proven beyond dubt that a compelling, storied singleplayer does alot for your bottom line.  If you were able to get data from blizzard regarding sales vs multiplayer activity, you would see huge singleplayer presence.  Michael bay also shows that explosions only get you so far."
planetaryannihilation,3ca1ba,Pag_Elodea,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:29:42 2015 UTC,Single player sold Starcraft copies and netted them a ton of money. That doesn't mean a multiplayer only game is doomed to failure.

planetaryannihilation,3ca1ba,robber364,6,Mon Jul 6 07:45:31 2015 UTC,if you think there's no strategic depth then you've obviously not played much.
planetaryannihilation,3ca1ba,otterfamily,3,Mon Jul 6 14:42:18 2015 UTC,Well there is some depth lost by having identical factions. In that respect he is correct. Now of course you have to actually balance those factions.
planetaryannihilation,3ca1ba,eponabestpony,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:59:48 2015 UTC,How can depth be lost by not delivering a feature that was never promised? They never promised separate factions.

There already are factions among the commanders if you bother reading Uber's blog posts. I'm sure they had plans to turn that into something before the money ran out.  I'm also sure they have a business plan right now; I'm just not sure it contains what you want. Be sure to apply for a job if you think you can be a better manager of ""a tight budget""."
planetaryannihilation,3ca1ba,pesco,0,Mon Jul 6 15:01:17 2015 UTC,I have no idea why you felt the need to lash out and to read tonnes of shit between the lines that I never said.

I assume you are invested (time and kickstarter) and therefore consider anyone that does not carefully though the line to be a problem that you need to attack.  Feel better now?
planetaryannihilation,3ca1ba,sadzora,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:11:01 2015 UTC,"I just meant that I think asking for a story and soul now is either pointless or the same thing as saying they're not doing their job properly which IMHO isn't fair.

planetaryannihilation,3ca1ba,sadzora,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:58:40 2015 UTC,"okay, your assessment makes more sense. Because you just described a totally different game with way more emphasis on story and flavor than PA ever promised. This game is exactly what it was supposed to be, a competitive strategic RTS."
planetaryannihilation,3ca1ba,otterfamily,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:01:41 2015 UTC,"Yes. I Know. That doesn't in anyway invalidate what I said. You seem to think it did.    The question was, is pa recovering. I said no it is not because it ONLY caters to the competetive crowd and therefore remains a niche game."
planetaryannihilation,3ca1ba,sadzora,0,Tue Jul 7 07:08:00 2015 UTC,No no Uber should add 3 new factions and put in a huge story and a campaign with prerendered cutscenes and pay my rent!

I wanted this game to be what supreme commander was SUPPOSED to be but all we get instead is 'planets' and not much of a story."
planetaryannihilation,3ca1ba,sesstreets,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:09:21 2015 UTC,I think Ashes of the Singularity may be what we've all been waiting for.  http://www.ashesofthesingularity.com/  Looks amazing.
planetaryannihilation,3ca1ba,rcat256,0,Mon Jul 6 14:50:28 2015 UTC,Now that they have the ability to do area commands in FA Forever....it's a LOT better/closer.
planetaryannihilation,3ca1ba,Cheeze_It,3,Mon Jul 6 22:53:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think the setting is the biggest problem in the game, the robots keep fighting forever because they were created to do that, and their creators disapeared long time ago. Makes sense to me.  I think the initial reviews hurt the game and people forgot about it, even when it has improved a lot since release."
planetaryannihilation,3ca1ba,alselgar,2,Wed Jul 8 21:08:17 2015 UTC,"the game is very noob unfriendly, the player base is formed by addicted. I remeber in one of my first game being against some sort of youtuber/streamer, all the other players knew him,and of course I got stomped in a few minutes. the single player is a joke, it could not be there.  if you are ready to get in the meta,read a lot on wikis, be part of the ''competitive players'',whatever this term means, then you may like it.  I mean, they say this game is so competitive it's the perfect competitive rts,if you are into that I suppose it's great.  otherwise i'd spend the money on something else, I may be a casual player, but something like starcraft or supreme commander was way more fun to me."
planetaryannihilation,3ca1ba,Aumanidol,2,Tue Jul 7 00:30:02 2015 UTC,I think this game can be a great entry into the RTS Genre. It has a single race with a diversity of units so players are not overwhelmed. It has a simple tier 1 tier 2 system that avoids confusing upgrades. And it has a huge Macro game focus that includes unstoppable end games so you don't have to play forever. Vs other rts it does lack identity and Micro play but I think the game is well made.
planetaryannihilation,3ca1ba,elitemage101,2,Tue Jul 7 02:21:33 2015 UTC,"I played a lot back in alpha and beta about a year ago and really loved it mostly cause I loved Supreme Commander. I recently tried to get into again but there seems to be a serious lack of players, hardly any servers ever up.  Reading through some of these comments and it seems like the community that still exists and plays is comprised of the ultra-hardcore players. I'm worried for potential new players because when the playerbase of a game stagnates like this and the only active players left are the <50 god-tier players, noobs are going to get stomped and not want to give the game a chance. OR even if there's a new guy who might be decent, I'm worried about the existing players not recognizing his username and making the assumption ""this guy must be new = he sucks I don't want to play with him cause I'll lose and it'll suck"".  This is pretty much how the community around Warzone 2100 (another, IMO, great RTS albeit a very old title) is, I just hope it isn't like this for PA."
planetaryannihilation,3ca1ba,tehrand0mz,2,Wed Jul 8 01:38:43 2015 UTC,"PA is a very strong game at the moment. I love it. That being said, it's not a soft and fluffy game. It's a lean, mean competitive RTS, and that's the overall meta that Uber is pursuing with the balances. There's no campaign because it was never part of the plan, so if you want single player, there's not a lot to do. The galactic war was a good idea for a roguelike RTS experience, and I think it's pretty fun.  But the main offering is in competing with other humans. The traffic's not so great because of the keyboard jockeys who decided to vent their childhood frustrations in their steam reviews, but it's pretty easy to find some games online (at least in EU). Matchmaking seems to have picked up a bit more recently, and you can often find 2v2's, big free-for-alls and other fun formats.  The development team has improved in their communication and they're still adding content. Art development is done, so don't expect dinosaur factions or clowncars, but there's some fun stuff in the works that should add some more layers.  I'd say it's worth it at 30$ or whatever it's at right now, and it's a steal anywhere below that."
planetaryannihilation,3ca1ba,otterfamily,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:39:51 2015 UTC,The traffic's not so great because of the keyboard jockeys who decided to vent their childhood frustrations in their steam reviews   So THAT's what you call people with a differing opinion!
planetaryannihilation,3ca1ba,ArmyOfDix,3,Tue Jul 7 16:32:34 2015 UTC,it's not so much about differing positions. I'm referring more to the sheer volume of people who're mad that features never promised didnt make it into the game (surprise surprise).
planetaryannihilation,3ca1ba,otterfamily,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:40:47 2015 UTC,"It's a great game, but looking at the steam charts, player retention still seems to be bad. I think the root cause is misplaced expectations of a ""typical"" RTS. PA is designed for one thing, competitive multiplayer, and that isn't clear enough. You get people wanting an AI that turtles just like they do, an engrossing story, a hand-holding campaign, lots of novel and fancy unit designs; I think that's most of it.  Add to that that the graphics and more importantly all the standard maps are a bit stale and boring. Also holy shit, why don't they integrate some of the ""standard"" mods already. Other than that, it's pretty awesome. ;)"
planetaryannihilation,3ca1ba,pesco,-1,Tue Jul 7 22:34:15 2015 UTC,"Unless you are into the ranking and competition tables, PA is pretty much a big fuck you to people who want a fucking single player product that is functional like we were promised ages ago on Kickstarter."

planetaryannihilation,3ca1ba,The_DestroyerKSP,6,Mon Jul 6 07:29:20 2015 UTC,"I assume he's asking whether it has recovered from all the negative press/butt-hurt surrounding the less than stellar 1.0 release, to which I would say kinda. Obviously the game has been patched several times since release and I believe all the features that people wanted in the 1.0 version are now in. In that reguard the game has ""recovered"" beautifully.   If you are referring to the reviews/community (they are kinda linked) then it's a slightly different story. At the time of me typing this, the steam reviews are at mixed, with only 69% (heh) positive reviews. In addition, many of the negative gaming press reviews of the original 1.0 release version remain unchanged, which does the game a great disservice.   Additions like a ranked ladder and single player have broadened the appeal of the game, yet I fear many don't even give it the light of day due to the lingering negative reviews. At this point there isn't much we can do, but the modding potential and niche audience means there's a good chance this game will keep a dedicated community for a while to come, and we can only hope it grows bigger and better with things like steam sales.  that answer your question OP?"
planetaryannihilation,3ca1ba,robber364,3,Mon Jul 6 07:42:16 2015 UTC,"It is still missing a bunch of promised features.

planetaryannihilation,3bk7ea,spartan2600,3,Mon Jun 29 22:06:26 2015 UTC,"There isn't a way to repair your save if you lost in a hardcore Galactic War (the data was deleted).  Hardcore is no longer the default option, so if you start a new war your save won't be deleted when you lose (unless you opt into hardcore mode).    I am not aware of any bug where the game un-pauses, however if you are playing on PlayFab servers the game will shutdown if no users perform any action for a while (I am not sure what the timeout value is... maybe 20 minutes).  If you play using a local server you can pause the game as long as you want (I have left games paused for more than a day).  It is unfortunate that you lost your save, but you can cheat if you want to accelerate your next GW to about where you were before.  Just run the client with the --devmode command line parameter.  You can set the flag from the uberlauncher or from steam."
planetaryannihilation,3bk7ea,ezerek,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:58:58 2015 UTC,Was there a reason not to save it before hitting Pause? Were you able to return to the war and just redo the battle on that last system?

Seriously, the booms can do some serious work, if they're supported, but you sacrificed about 200 booms to his infernos over the course of the game. If you feel the need to send something unsupported in, then just build dox. otherwise you're going to need to either scout, or support your booms.  The boom rush with no support may have worked lower in the silver ladder, because you're often facing Tower balling turtles, and booms can clear a base on their own if that's the case, but even if all he has is 5 dox, you'll lose all your booms in that kind of unsupported rush.  As a general rule, unless you know for a fact that the path is clear of units, you can't send naked booms. However, if you had used your army to gain vision and fight and then sent booms, they would have cleared his army nicely."

planetaryannihilation,3ax52m,Probe_for_thought,4,Wed Jun 24 05:23:10 2015 UTC,"Depends who you're fighting. If you get caught rushing orbital by them spotting your launcher or with radar, and your opponent knows how the game works, it's quite easy to counter. He could setup an umbrella and at this point you probably don't have much ground defense since most of your econ went into the orbital that failed.  I wouldn't recommend doing it unless your opponent is a real noob in which case a decent ground assault would be a faster win."
planetaryannihilation,3ax52m,ndm250,3,Wed Jun 24 07:01:42 2015 UTC,"In a FFA on a multiplanet system with only a single starting planet then I'd say that, yes, it can be. In a 1v1? Only on a large planet where you're far apart.  In both cases it's going to depend on what the starting planet looks like in terms of metal compared to your system expansion opportunties."
planetaryannihilation,3ax52m,Quitchy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:37:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, anchors do really small damage in my opinion and they have a medium time to build. They also don't have much range and a single umbrella can take it out from it's attack range. You'll probably need 4 fabrication units just to put them up fast enough and they will drain a good amount of resources. However despite this, it is satisfying to do against bots. xD"
planetaryannihilation,3ax52m,Fearmydonut,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:26:18 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this still works, but orbital fabricators can deconstruct commanders and umbrellas faster than they can build them.

planetaryannihilation,3ax52m,otterfamily,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:48:17 2015 UTC,"Not viable if your oponent is any good. I'd say in the current meta it's a bad habit that sometimes pays off, not a viable strategy.  eg, if I scout that you're going orbital rush, then I'll inferno drop you most likely. The resources you've wasted on orbital mean that any army I send will be better than any army you have. I just need to get it there before your orbital pays off. And if you are doing orbital as your second factory, that means it'll take about 3 minutes to finish.  That's plenty of time to switch to pelican transports and organize a drop.  The success of the orbital cheese is reliant on your oponent not scouting you. If you're counting on your opponent making a mistake, then you're just building bad habits. It's too easy to scout in PA to get away with something like that."

planetaryannihilation,3alpkq,Sorian,13,Sun Jun 21 17:21:51 2015 UTC,"No, it is not. You are always dealing with a set income. Blowing it on 30 fabbers early game is wasting production that could be going into combat units and structures. Early game you only need a few fabbers to run out and claim mass points around the map and set up satellite bases as the game warrants. Otherwise your commander does most of the building, at least until you have T2 fabbers.  How do you learn how to play? Simple -- pull up the game and watch the top ranked players play. You can view their replays in the bottom right of the main game screen. Emulate their openings and watch how they react to threats and manage production. Keep an eye on how their economy is going. Write out a build order for the start of the game and stick to it until it's memorized, then tweak as necessary.   Only by watching the pros and lots of practice will you improve."

This will help you understand how your opponent reacts to what he sees, and how much or little he knows about your troop movements.

The frantically excited ones are similarly biased in the other direction. It's great that you had a few hours of fun and that's definitely valid information to have about the game, but it doesn't say much else.  My review, which I might post to Steam at some point (I don't have the game there, yet), is that it's a great competitive RTS with a very solid design.

But that's not classic ""lag"".  +Hint: I had problems with the steam version a year ago, which was lagging even on small planets, but haven't tested the new version. I use the Launcher from their website, it takes very long to start the game, but once it runs, it is lag-free.  I like it very much, the updates improved a lot."
planetaryannihilation,3a9hd6,kyl3r123,5,Mon Jun 22 21:59:10 2015 UTC,http://steamcharts.com/app/233250#1y Could do better I think if the game wasn't performing so badly for many. Yes it might be a case of them having incompatible drivers and what not. To go through your computer to make sure it should work is a step a lot of people just won't take.
planetaryannihilation,3a9hd6,MuNgLo,2,Thu Jun 18 12:20:41 2015 UTC,"The game is on sale for 5 bucks where I am, I'm going to go out on alrg here and assume that a bunch more people are going to be buying it"
planetaryannihilation,3a9hd6,Gentlemen_Cake,3,Thu Jun 18 13:01:09 2015 UTC,"I got it for 7.85 here. I've been trying to give it a fair shake, and honestly, it felt like a crappier version of SupCom until I got to a single player game with multiple worlds. Then it got fucking magnificent."
planetaryannihilation,3a9hd6,TanyIshsar,2,Thu Jun 18 20:20:24 2015 UTC,Yeah can't really argue with the prize right now. :) Got one friend to buy it and another even had it on his wishlist but ended up burning through the steam sale budget before he got around to PA. The one that bought it has to go through his computer for driver versions and so on though. Seems he had problem with performance. :/
planetaryannihilation,3a9hd6,MuNgLo,2,Thu Jun 18 13:48:01 2015 UTC,I can't believe I paid full price for it a year ago. 5 bucks is a reasonable price for the game and would be well worth it. $30 however is pretty steep. And not worth it imo
planetaryannihilation,3a9hd6,PurpleNuggets,2,Thu Jun 18 18:02:47 2015 UTC,Hah. I kickstarted it. Still haven't gotten that t-shirt.
planetaryannihilation,3a9hd6,Spekingur,-2,Thu Jun 18 18:24:25 2015 UTC,Well reddit in general is filled with overly picky loud-mouths at the best of times.

planetaryannihilation,3a6x4m,Quitchy,8,Wed Jun 17 18:28:42 2015 UTC,"Is it a worthwhile buy?    I just checked out the wiki to see whether the digital deluxe edition add on is worthwhile, and the wiki is completely outdated and incomplete.  That's generally a really bad sign for a game's health.  This sub also seems pretty dead.  Are people still playing at all?  I was interested at the reveal, but the game's fallen off my radar in the last few years."
planetaryannihilation,3a6x4m,HandofWinter,7,Wed Jun 17 19:02:21 2015 UTC,"For less than $5 US.. absolutely!   The latest updates are really nice. The game is still being actively developed and refined. Galactic War is single player and totally fun, if you are not into multiplayer..  If you are I think the numbers of player will rise after news of the update starts to spread.. but I can be a bit of an optimist at times."
planetaryannihilation,3a6x4m,DeVoh,3,Wed Jun 17 20:07:54 2015 UTC,"It's not running Starcraft 2 numbers, but it's trundling along OK. Certainly I don't have an issue getting a game when I want one.  The game moved wikis at some point, which led to its demise. At this point I think there are about four different wikis."
planetaryannihilation,3a6x4m,HandofWinter,3,Wed Jun 17 19:28:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback, I think I'll jump on it at $5.  I've paid more for coffee.  If I even get a few good games out of it it'll be worth the price."
planetaryannihilation,3a6x4m,DeVoh,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:38:19 2015 UTC,wonder if we can get the old wiki's pulled..  ask the owners to pull them kind of thing. I agree more than one wiki can be confusing.
planetaryannihilation,3a6x4m,Kerhole,7,Wed Jun 17 20:09:31 2015 UTC,"I regret buying it.  YMMV at a $5 purchase price though.  Multiplayer was kind of fun but when I played there was no way to match with people of equivalent skill.  I'd either get rolled in 3 minutes or do the rolling.  Neither was fun.  It was also pretty dead overall, there were maybe 1-5 games, total, with open lobbies when I wanted to play online.  Balance was an issue as well.  The single player campaign was terribly implemented as well.  You basically just move from system to system fighting the AI there, pick up a randomly generated item, and then move on.  My worst memory of the campaign was when I was unlucky and never got any orbital units from the randomly generated rewards.  I had to fight a faction ""boss"" who's army was spread across multiple planets.  It completely covered one I didn't spawn on, and thus without orbital units, the game was effectively a dead end  I couldn't land because they'd spot me, and they didn't attack."
planetaryannihilation,3a6x4m,DeVoh,6,Wed Jun 17 21:42:53 2015 UTC,"Just a counter point to this is that the development is still ongoing. So even valid complaints are becoming less as the game continues to improve. Sure we all wish it was perfect now, and not down the road.. but I really have enjoyed watching it improve step by step and all the info sharing from the devs.  Been a  fun ride."
planetaryannihilation,3a6x4m,DeVoh,3,Wed Jun 17 21:58:38 2015 UTC,"Also a second point /u/Kerhole, was that the GW with the latest release? I agree the old GW was not much fun.. but I really like the new released version that came out last week. Now you get a choice of three techs.. it's MUCH better"
planetaryannihilation,3a6x4m,Cheeze_It,2,Wed Jun 17 22:06:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, even at full price.  The game is great."
planetaryannihilation,3a6x4m,DeVoh,10,Wed Jun 17 23:30:16 2015 UTC,Woot!  got my third copy of the game.  Now to have a LAN game night  :D

planetaryannihilation,3a76ft,marsbat,4,Wed Jun 17 19:33:19 2015 UTC,"You need to do the same thing, build a ton of metal extractors all over the map. Do it as fast as you can. They will try to destroy and take your metal spots. Try to stop them from doing this; the best way is to launch raids and attacks of your own. Do so as early as possible. Remember that in the beginning you might not have much of an army, but so don't they!"
planetaryannihilation,3a76ft,Kohr-Ah_Initializer,4,Wed Jun 17 19:40:19 2015 UTC,"In addition to the other comments, here are some more tactics you can try:   Set one bot factory to build doxes infinitely, then give the factory ""patrol planet"" orders. Now the doxes built there will patrol all over the planet - whenever they find an enemy mex they will attack it.  This can prove particularly frustrating for your opponent when they're a human. Sit groups of 1-3 units in areas with multiple metal spots, especially around your opponent's base. When he sends a fabber there to expand, your units will destroy his fabber. Build ground & air turrets (or even mini bases) in high metal density areas to deny them to your opponent and to protect them for you. Regularly scout out your opponent's base/forces to see what he's up to. If you can see he's expanding in a certain direction do your best to stop him. If you can see he has lots of air fabbers, send out some fighters to destroy them.  Radar coverage isn't as good as scouting visually, but it's very important. If you can see radar blips appearing over metal spots, you know he's expanding there and can send in a few units to take care of those mexes."
planetaryannihilation,3a76ft,davedontmind,2,Thu Jun 18 13:08:16 2015 UTC,"Just as /u/Kohr-Ah_Initializer said, expand expand expand! Everywhere there's a group of 3-4 of MEs set up a small base with a bot/tank factory."

I havent seen someone throw a game this hard in a long time.  He's an old TA hand I think, because for whatever reason this was the legitimate meta in TA days, to just build fabber balls. And this guy for whatever reason just doesn't want to try anything else. It made sense on metal maps where you don't need tactical control of the map, but it makes no sense at all in PA.  Easy win, funny replay. The analysis is kind of overkill given that he handed you the game by just building fabbers, but fun to watch anyway."
planetaryannihilation,39ly93,otterfamily,2,Sat Jun 13 10:11:08 2015 UTC,I don't think he actually knew about your proxy base. I think he just wanted to build metal extractors and chose the wrong spot.

It just sounds tedious.  The design of the gameplay is that you're supposed to ultimately protect your commander, and I like that, because it opens the door to more ways to win, where you dont need to win a war, but soemtimes just snipe a com.  But that's just my .02$. I think that you could probably develop a mod for this though."

planetaryannihilation,3929k3,Kinjuru,2,Tue Jun 9 04:32:07 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. I cant really see its strength. The thing is that if I just scout a little bit, I know whats going on in his base. I send 4 AA airs and I wreck most of fabbers in the enemy base. Even if he made bobmers to attack me - building a bomber takes more time than building an AA, I can easily defend against that, as long as I have air factory as a third or fourth thing in the build order. I can see it being strong in a way where you build proxy bases, air fabbers are faster than any other fabbers. In order to maintain this strategy, you have to build a lot of defenses in your base, which makes you be slower than your enemy. While he is still building essential thing in his base, I can establish my proxy base. I actually played another game that involved this strategy, the person I was playing with actually knew how to use it better. Ill post that game on YouTube through talking over replay. I think that game shows the flaws in this strategy.  I mean, I want you to prove me wrong :P So if you have some valid points I didint make, then do so!"
planetaryannihilation,3929k3,otterfamily,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:38:54 2015 UTC,"An air starts' strength lies in it's ability to expand your metal income insanely fast, yes it easily countered but that's the risk you take with it. Balance that out with normal units, as you always should and give your opponent plenty to do and it's gold. Even though you may lose a lot of air fabbers, in the end, they more than pay for themselves! As well as the 8 million tanks rolling through your opponents front door."
planetaryannihilation,3929k3,Kinjuru,3,Tue Jun 9 06:29:42 2015 UTC,"the fact that it is easily countered is what makes it weak. If your strategy relies on your opponent playing badly, then your strategy is bad. You should always assume that they will scout and raid and play optimal, otherwise you're building bad habits for if you rank up.  I'm more in favor of Air fac 2nd and transporting out a ground fabber to set up proxy/metal. That way it's harder to counter and it's a lower investment and you dont delay the ground war. In addition, you're in the air game without the delay of building air cons fabbers, so you have, on average more AA/bombers than your opponent if they get fabbers before they scout."
planetaryannihilation,3929k3,otterfamily,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:01:36 2015 UTC,"If your strategy relies on your opponent playing badly, then your strategy is bad.   First air doesn't rely on the other player being terrible, it exploits the fact that there is at least a full minute in which you can establish air dominance and a sizable metal lead. Strong early air also easily shuts down early raiding and expansion attempts by the opponent for around another two minutes, at least! The enemy can obviously push back out of it but in doing so, may potentially cede a lot of pace and map control to you. At which point, as long as you can maintain the initiative and keep the pressure on you've as good as won. If you sit on that early advantage, like so many do, you will get punished hard for an air first start. Thus, it's weakness.  I'm not saying it isn't risky but the risks are manageable enough for a sensible player.  Difficult, yes but manageable. :D"

planetaryannihilation,38t2kg,MajorasAss,2,Sat Jun 6 20:57:57 2015 UTC,"Generally we want the ""chocolate"" faction to have similar actions as the vanilla faction, but the way the units perform these actions will be different.  It's not as simple as being more defensive or offensive, it's going to behave like an alternative for the vanilla roster. You can still win if you build only vanilla units, but you have the OPTION to build the new awesome units (because new units are fun).  EDIT: I just want to clarify that the faction will not actually allow you to build vanilla units with the same faction, it will be like sup com where you pick your faction in the main menu (commanders will be bound to different factions)  Basically a giant DLC expansion."
planetaryannihilation,38t2kg,Nicb1,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:10:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah the current implementation of the faction system works like this: If you pick for example the raptor commander you get the vanilla unit set to build and all that, but if you pick the aeson commander you get access to all the new faction units and structures (you cannot build vanilla structures and units with the aeson then).  And Kiwi I'd prefer if we used the term expansion over dlc :)"

planetaryannihilation,38t2kg,Kohr-Ah_Initializer,2,Sun Jun 7 00:55:44 2015 UTC,"So I think you would be well-advised to split it into a client mod that is purely cosmetic (changes looks but not stats or mechanics) and a separate mod for the rest. That way the new looks will be usable by anyone in any game. If you are hoping (one can dream) to get Uber to include your work in the main game, that might also make it easier."

planetaryannihilation,37sojo,FractalJaguar,4,Sat May 30 07:20:10 2015 UTC,"I'm totally with you, I think the game's bugginess and stability is probably the single biggest issue holding this game back from wider acceptance.   There are obviously game/balance issues but then, people will be arguing about that until the end of time itself.  I pretty much consider this par for the course and I love the current meta direction leaning towards full spectrum solutions but I digress.  The game crashing or breaking in some new and interesting* way after every 3 or 4 games isn't a very positive experience for the less obsessed and/or tolerant. Contemporary gamers have a much higher expectation of competence, quality and stability from their titles.   *Enraging"
planetaryannihilation,37sojo,FractalJaguar,2,Sat May 30 20:27:09 2015 UTC,"You put it great Kinjuru, the tweaking of balance over fixing actual bugs is a sign the course isn't going to change and I don't expect it to...

Games like this need a decent fan base if they want to continue past the release date.   The game might be great now but no one is looking because the flair of releasing something new is long dead.  In a sense no, it's not dead, it's just very very small. It will die soon though."
planetaryannihilation,37r2pl,TimeDoesDisolve,6,Sat May 30 04:53:51 2015 UTC,It definitely has massive unfulfilled potential. I just don't know if Uber has the commitment or capital to fulfill that potential. If I were filthy rich I would personally put up a few million to see this game expanded on and polished to be the masterpiece it could have been.
planetaryannihilation,37r2pl,Cats_n_Porn,-1,Fri May 29 20:57:03 2015 UTC,At least they realised they got burnt when they tried to make the other RTS. I imagine the SMNC community helped us realise what uberent were more inclined to do (drop it and move on as the damage was already done to the community).
planetaryannihilation,37r2pl,forumrabbit,30,Sat May 30 05:30:50 2015 UTC,"For me yes.  I am a huge and I mean huge Total Annihilation fan and PA was very disappointing.

planetaryannihilation,37r2pl,Saxi,16,Fri May 29 19:08:55 2015 UTC,"My sentiments exactly.  Some features never did, or are still being constructed - but they did fulfill a lot. The massive one that is still missing in my eyes is the 40 player promise with 100's of units. I think the max is still around 10 without mods and I still think it was a dick move to count buildings under ""units"".  You can have huge planets, but nobody plays on them because of performance issues which are still being improved on with every patch. You can have water planets.   I''ve honestly not played since the game was still in beta or Gamma, whatever the fuck that was, but I'm very surprised you cannot find a game within 30 minutes of searching.. the players might be all converging under a mod which dosnt show in the vanilla server browser or using match making?"

I still get the emails about new things, but it's nothing mindblowing. I guess that's why it fell off the radar. Also, your right about the optimization. Even with just a 1v1, the game gets very difficult to play late in the round.  And to the multiplayer thing, an occasional match would pop-up for a minute or so, before going away. So, I guess there are a few people in search, but not the amount I was expecting."

The TA communities thirst for a new TA successor dosnt help either."

All I ever did in TA was build doom bases and try to defeat AI opponents with mass artillery and nukes (and the occasional Krogoth).  So for me, I feel I've gotten my money's worth on PA and I'm glad I have it around to play a random game every so often.  If I had paid $90 or whatever it was in alpha for this game, however, I'd be very disappointed."

Most of the features you list as missing are in the game. Planet size and water worlds at least. The matchmaking can not possibly take 30 minutes. I've never waited more than 5.

planetaryannihilation,37r2pl,Stickman2,15,Sat May 30 05:26:31 2015 UTC,"No  In fact they just released an update yesterday.  It does have a fairly small MP community.  I'm not sure how small, personally I find myself waiting for games for about the same amount of time as when I played FA.  That's about 2-6 min on average, I play M-F in the 8-10PM EST time block in 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, never touched 1v1 ranked.   Massive planets   You can go fairly large, but there are performance issues.  I haven't tried a very large planet in a while so I don't know if performance has improved or not, but I'd rather have a system with a few smaller planets and a gas giant than 1 big planet.   All water planets   These exist right now, you just need to create them in the system designer.   Galactic War   I can't find any quotes right now, but I think at one point it was supposed to be both MP and SP.  I'm not sure if that meant a MP coop version of the SP Galactic War or if it meant something more like TA's Boneyards (which I think is what PA really needs on the MP side)  An actual campaign with a story line was never a planned feature, in fact they explicitly said there would not be one.  I do think the game needs more polish, but the devs continue to work on it, until we reach the point where the polish updates stop, I'm going to stick around."
planetaryannihilation,37r2pl,FractalJaguar,13,Fri May 29 23:43:48 2015 UTC,"I'm enjoying PA. I was big into TA back in the day, when I was in high school and could play as much as I wanted.  The fact that I can press a button in the lobby and a few minutes later I'm in a ranked game is awesome. No fuss about which map or what rules set. My rank isn't important. Enabling me to squeeze in a quick game after I put my kid to bed is so valuable. And every game I play I can learn so much from because of the Cronocam. I'm still learning orbital combat.  The mix of units is pretty finely tuned. The rock-paper-scissors minigames of unit interactions are rich and well balanced at this point.  I'm a beta backer, btw. Just recently I figured out how to make the controls work for me, cuz I'm special. I use a Mac and a Dvorak keyboard. So I had to jump through a lot of hoops to become efficient. Client-side mods are super helpful for that. Because modding is supported out of the box, and I can use those mods in a ranked game, I've gotten a lot of mileage out of my play style.  Uber is doing a lot of things right. Big planets with a trillion units? Meh. Give me strategy, tactics, fun, and quick games and I'm happy."
planetaryannihilation,37r2pl,davedontmind,4,Fri May 29 19:57:26 2015 UTC,"Good! I'm glad to see a little light in the darkness and see that someone is enjoying it.

planetaryannihilation,37r2pl,lodvib,3,Fri May 29 20:16:48 2015 UTC,"I think the learning curve might be an issue. The player base is not trying to improve themselves. There are many resources available.   this for example  The gameplay has become boring because the player base are noobs. Because the price keeps dropping, people view the game as less worthy of self improvement. People are not going to work hard for the win if they are not motivated.  I think most people in the top ranks of 1v1s can see the competitive potentials of the game.  I don't think the games sucks, the players suck."
planetaryannihilation,37r2pl,dom314,3,Sat May 30 04:15:23 2015 UTC,"It is most certain not 'dead'. Plenty of people still playing it. More would be nice, but I never have to wait long to get a game (and you can always play the AI, offline too).  1300 radius planet is massive enough. But you'll need a better system to play it, so you won' see it much. But you can make a huge planet and host a game and play. Also, you can play on water only planets. There used to an official ranked map which was only water.  You waited 30 minutes and never say a match 'show up'? Something wrong there. Check out palobby.com, there's always games being played and people looking for games. Obviously there are peak times for each timezone though.  If you want to play a game, let me know! :P"

The question is a trick similar to a tactic the Republicans/FoxNews use here in the US to spread their FUD. If you ask the same false question enough people will believe it to be truth. I am NOT saying that is your intent. Hell I even agree with your point. I don't know the solution to the problem, just that the more people ask the question the more it will become reality.  Uber did put out an awesome update just two days ago, https://forums.uberent.com/threads/release-build-82293-now-live.68906/#post-1088757  please check out the improvements and give PA another shot. The best way to keep PA from dying is to keep coming back and playing a game here and there. When you did you made one more person available for a match. So kudo's for coming back and giving it another shot.  Uber has many more improvements / updates in the works. They discuss them a little more in the Uber forums, but we are always asking them to be a little more forthcoming with updates so people can see when the feature they care most about will be implemented. These last updates were ""Uber"" complicated and took some time to implement, hence the long delay in an update."

The reason they aren't buying it is because of its overambitious scope and consequent horrible launch and comparatively lackluster quality. The reason for its overambitious scope is that the developers fooled themselves into thinking they could deliver when people kickstarted it to that scope.

planetaryannihilation,36v8oo,davedontmind,6,Fri May 22 14:33:10 2015 UTC,I did not know about the rocket bots nor ships. That is hella useful information.
planetaryannihilation,36v8oo,davedontmind,3,Fri May 22 16:26:25 2015 UTC,"I just checked on pa-db and it seems the bombers can't.  You need either the Bluehawk rocket bot, GIL-E sniper bot or the Stingray missile ship to shoot into the orbital layer.  (Note there's a bug on the pa-db site, where it says ""ital"" instead of ""orbital"" for the ""Targets:"" line of info)."
planetaryannihilation,36v8oo,poor_leno,2,Fri May 22 16:58:06 2015 UTC,"So after digging around in the game files some, it seems like GIL-E's cannot shoot anchors. The GIL-E has two weapons: A sniper weapon, which works as expected, and a beam weapon, which is able to shoot at the air and orbital layers. But the beam is set as an ""anti_entity"" weapon, which I can only assume means that it can only shoot specific entities (couldn't find much documentation on this).   If we keep looking around in the weapon spec there is a list of ""anti_entity_targets"" , which includes bot tactical missile, advanced bomber, and tactical missile launcher ammo. What I take away from this is that the GIL-E can shoot those types of ammo, destroying them, but that's all the beam can do. The only reason it states that it can shoot orbital is that the ammo of both of the tactical missiles live in the orbital layer. So pa-db is not wrong, it's just a little misleading.  I have not tested this in game, so if somebody wants to prove me wrong, go for it!"

planetaryannihilation,36ppwf,KaladinRahl,15,Thu May 21 03:26:30 2015 UTC,"UI mods yes. But none of them give unfair advantage, and you can customize your UI to suit your playstyle as well. You'll just need to install PAMM.  The only mods available in ranked are things like alternate visualizations of eco, default factory settings (like looping instead of one off - this is a button you can press, but some people like default looping factories without pressing a hotkey), mods for custom hotkeys, there's one that adds buttons to shut down/turn on all factories.  The whole idea behind PA is that it's a game of massive scale where the limitations are meant to be tactical, not UI based. It's not meant to be like starcraft 1 with imposed UI limitations. And there's nothing game breaking available in the UI mod  arena."
planetaryannihilation,36ppwf,otterfamily,3,Thu May 21 06:36:19 2015 UTC,Id say that the mini map mod that alerts you when you're under attack and where is a tad unfair. I think they allow that in ranked.

planetaryannihilation,36ppwf,otterfamily,5,Fri May 22 07:44:40 2015 UTC,It's only UI mods. So no game changing things. It's like saying omg they allow someone to use gaming mice/keyboards so unfair.
planetaryannihilation,36ppwf,PRoeleert,6,Thu May 21 06:13:04 2015 UTC,"No, that's different.  Because an action is still one action.  Autofactory totally changes that by automating a bunch of stuff to give someone an APM advantage.  Doesn't matter if it has 'downsides', it is still providing a function that is basically cheating in the context of ranked games.  What macro can you bind on your keyboard/mouse that can automate a function as well as create new ones?  'gaming' mice and keyboards don't change the way you have to gather information either.  Alerts minimap is an incredibly powerful advantage to one player, if not 'cheat'.  It should by default be in game, but untill then there is no way to argue that it's not a game changing thing."
planetaryannihilation,36ppwf,Pag_Elodea,2,Fri May 22 02:33:34 2015 UTC,"I dunno because you have gaming mouse you can click faster.

planetaryannihilation,36ppwf,Abu_mohd,0,Thu May 21 10:05:18 2015 UTC,There's mods that build stuff automatically on idle units...if this isn't unfair against people who don't have the mod then I don't know what is.
planetaryannihilation,36ppwf,DeathByDenim,1 point,Thu May 21 15:46:30 2015 UTC,"Ah, that one. Yeah, it's somewhat outdated now that Uber has infinite build queues as /u/MajorasAss mentioned. It still has value as it tries to manage the eco somewhat, but it's limited. In fact, it can only control factories that are visible on-screen.  It often gets in the way of what you really want to build too. Especially when you have your factories on infinite build. Also it doesn't react to threats such as discovering your opponent has a massive bomber fleet and you need AA immediately for example. I think you are better off without it personally. You get alerts nowadays too when you have build a factory. And there is the idle fabber/factory UI in PA now too.  Good example though. That mod is really the closest you can get to manipulating game play. There isn't quite a mod like it as far as I know."
planetaryannihilation,36ppwf,MajorasAss,0,Thu May 21 18:57:55 2015 UTC,You can set that with the infinite built button with no mods at all

He had no anti-air forces on the side you were attacking at last, so I'd first do away with his ground defences with help of bumblebees covered by those anti-air planes, I forgot the exact name..  Strategy seems reasonable and I startle at how you managed to stay calm through the match. Good work!  What's the name of this system, by the way? Video quality (my download speed isn't much of a catch) is so low, text on screen is barely legible."
planetaryannihilation,36ifnj,meater11,3,Tue May 19 16:57:52 2015 UTC,"I haven't played much with it myself, but if you go to settings -> keyboard, there should be a whole wack of keys that delete and modify structures (CGS), as well as edit metal points and such.

planetaryannihilation,36gkpc,Remotayx2,6,Tue May 19 05:47:43 2015 UTC,Very well-written review.  I share your view that the single biggest problem that the game has right now is its New Player Experience - I'm hopeful this is something Uber will address in the near future to improve player retention after the Steam sales that cause spikes in interest!
planetaryannihilation,36gkpc,TheWrongCat,1 point,Tue May 19 08:55:25 2015 UTC,"Yep, single biggest flaw is the lack of tutorial. It could really do with a proper interactive one from Uber - arguably, with help from the community.  I have to say I am really surprised why, even now, there still isn't an official tutorial, and a good one at that. It seems like such a major oversight and I reckon it has caused many players to just leave the game. With any luck, they will come back if a good tutorial is released."
planetaryannihilation,36gkpc,FractalJaguar,1 point,Tue May 19 13:48:53 2015 UTC,Agreed. I've been playing the game with friends for a while now. The game is a lot of fun. It just has to be easier to pickup and learn. It's very daunting for new players.
planetaryannihilation,36gkpc,FractalJaguar,1 point,Tue May 19 20:16:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah it must be very daunting for them. I just don't understand why it has been this long without an official tutorial. Uber must be prioritising other tasks over a tutorial, which does seem odd. Surely having a larger playerbase increases your chance of more sales, through word of mouth etc?"

However, we don’t have access to Uber’s true Sandbox mode for cheating. Upon 1.0 release we will have access to the true Sandbox mode. In the meantime, Uber has granted us access to some of its capabilities through a server mod.  The Planetary Annihilation cheats mod allows players to fudge the numbers and do things like take control of the enemy team, copy and paste in units, delete units, spawn an Avatar Commander, and more."

I'd like to see developers playing and commentating the game."
planetaryannihilation,369h1g,TheWrongCat,2,Sun May 17 22:17:09 2015 UTC,I'd like to see developers playing and commentating the game.   /u/sorian does do this from time to time.

planetaryannihilation,369h1g,ellister,3,Sun May 17 20:19:50 2015 UTC,"A NEW GAME MODE, holy hell. 400 hours of the same destroy enemy commanders, I'm about done. Here's a gamemode idea i've had for a long time:  It's about a black hole generator (bhg) that will destroy the entire galaxy. There are 2 teams (no names for them yet) the bad guys and good guys. The bad guys have a bhg that will go off in 20-40 minutes.   The good guys have to destroy the bhg before the time runs out, the bad guy commanders don't matter. The bad guys have to protect the bhg and let it go off. They can destroy the good guy commanders to win, or they could focus hard on defending the bhg. It's like Counter-Strike but the bomb is already planted and has a fuse of 20-40 minutes. The bhg will have an astronomical amount of health. It should be able to withstand a dozen nukes and two asteroid impacts. It would take more than 5,000 BOOM bots to destroy it. Perhaps the bhg has anti-MetalPlanetLaserAnnihilator technology with it.   There would be a lot of balance kinks to work out and other things that need to be thought out (like if the planet gets asteroid'ed... will the bhg just float above the crater?) but I think it could be fun. People say PA has the same strats over and over again, but with this new game mode and two teams there is going to be some new and different strats."
planetaryannihilation,369h1g,FrequentPilgrim,3,Mon May 18 20:36:01 2015 UTC,"The issue may have more to do with player retention than initial marketing, but both need to be addressed. The majority of players don't know about Planetary Annihilation Mod Manager, and truthfully i think the things PAMM introduces are essential to the quality of the game. It's very hard to be competitive with a vanilla UI setup, and the game is built for competition. PAMM should be integrated with PA to a larger extent. If i didn't find PAMM then I don't know how long I could have grappled with the controls in frustration."
planetaryannihilation,369h1g,FractalJaguar,1 point,Mon May 18 19:07:42 2015 UTC,"I Kickstarted this game in part because of the promise of a brand new game engine that would be written to support modding, and the modders for this game are great. PAMM and mods like HotBuild 2 and PA Stats have really increased my enjoyment of the game. I've been using mods since late alpha to the point where i just consider them part of the game now; I can barely remember which ones I have installed!"
planetaryannihilation,369h1g,FractalJaguar,3,Tue May 19 12:35:39 2015 UTC,"I think the game needs a few more major updates and bugfixes, perhaps a new game mode or two (total annihilation/destroy everything, instead of destroy commander, perhaps?), good support for competitive 1v1 and perhaps competitive 2v2 as well, numerous other things that are mentioned elsewhere.  And then, crucially, the game needs a huge wave of publicity. They need to push to have journalists who originally reviewed the game, review it again. A lot of important features were missing at launch and led to bad reviews, and some of those are in the game now or at least are currently being tested, such as save/load. A lot of people wanted save/load, I think. Promote the game again, show off the new features, show that the game has been in continual development since launch. Get casters and content creators to show it off etc. It /is/ a great game, very enjoyable to play and it creates fantastic in-game moments at times.  I think with more updates and improvements, coupled with publicity and media coverage, the playerbase will increase, due to new sales and players returning to the game that they previously abandoned.  I'd be curious to see figures for number of sales vs number of current active players!"
planetaryannihilation,369h1g,yakcyll,3,Tue May 19 12:33:41 2015 UTC,"For those who enjoy RTSes, maybe a custom game highlight. Add variety to the original formula; I've noticed quite a few fun server mods, just a pain to set them up and you never know if you'll find a match. For newcomers... no idea. I think simply better advertising would do the job. An expansion, even a community one (although it'd have to be of outstanding quality), would give an opportunity to promote the game again."
planetaryannihilation,369h1g,MuNgLo,4,Wed May 20 07:37:33 2015 UTC,DLC with a biological alien faction.  BAAM!

I understand the engine already supports this type of game so its just a matter for it to be exposed to users. Mod community would also love it as it'd allow creating mods emulating some of the classic games PA is based on."
planetaryannihilation,369h1g,langile,1 point,Sun May 17 15:26:57 2015 UTC,"Good idea. If something like this were made, it would make a good excuse for re-launching the game on Steam and getting more players."
planetaryannihilation,369h1g,Kinjuru,4,Sun May 17 15:28:54 2015 UTC,Flat maps? soooooooooooooooo boring. You can actually be legitimately sneaky on spherical maps. Feint and raid sensitive areas while an opponent is distracted. Route around and utterly ignore frontal defenses if they become a problem. It also takes real skill to maintain map awareness and force flexibility in the face of 360 degrees of potential threat.  Flat maps are for the weak!
planetaryannihilation,369h1g,Quitchy,2,Sun May 17 23:33:58 2015 UTC,"The majority of people who look for a rts game aren't looking to be the best and outplay people via sneak attacks, and the flat map option would widen the playerbase (even if they are weak)."
planetaryannihilation,369h1g,Noobymcnoobcake,1 point,Tue May 19 16:02:45 2015 UTC,"RTS games have had the same boring two-dimensional flat maps for 20+ years, there are hundreds of them and they continue to be made even now. If safe, boring flat maps that you only need to think in one direction at a time are what you want, then there is an extremely large selection of games that already do this.  I backed PA because I felt an RTS played on three dimensional, spherical orbital bodies provided  a much needed and long neglected advancement of the genre. An advancement that presented a unique challenge that every single RTS that I've played over the years could not.  As far as I'm concerned flat maps are old hat, nothing wrong with that but I've been there, done that and the t-shirt no longer fits... time for a new one, a better one. Fuck flat maps, seriously."

planetaryannihilation,369h1g,FractalJaguar,5,Sun May 17 19:13:23 2015 UTC,It only failed because they released an unfinished game. Seriously if they waited a few more months i am sure they would have had it funded.

planetaryannihilation,369h1g,delta_wardog,2,Sun May 17 21:59:12 2015 UTC,"I didn't back Human Resources based purely off the pitch, and nothing to do with Planetary Annihilation. I genuinely believe that HR didn't quite have that certain something that it needed to get off the ground. It was an interesting concept, but it is hard to back a concept without seeing gameplay. It worked for PA because of the team behind it and the love for the games before it (TA and SupCom).  Sometimes I wonder if I should have backed the game purely in the hope that it would have led to more investment in the PA engine and money for Uber in general, but I thought that was a bit of a stretch in the end."
planetaryannihilation,369h1g,Kinjuru,1 point,Tue May 19 12:37:58 2015 UTC,"I don't want to argue why HR flunked; I think I backed it because I liked the concept and I can imagine it would have succeeded with proper timing, i.e. after a successful and well-supported PA.  But I realized that it was absolutely right for it to fail. Uber would have abandoned PA had it turned out that HR was making money and PA wasn't. Their business would have dictated it. Talk of having ""a seperate team"" and such is a smoke screen to cover the base. The kind of lie that isn't technically false."
planetaryannihilation,369h1g,corobo,3,Tue May 19 18:35:39 2015 UTC,"Undoubtedly correct.  Many people LOVED the ideas presented in the Human Resources kickstarter, but after playing what the company considered a release-worthy PA game, there was no way people were going to fund it, believing they'd just get more of the same treatment."
planetaryannihilation,369h1g,Quitchy,1 point,Mon May 18 08:50:27 2015 UTC,I think the way the ladder functions needs some work. I would make the  facing of higher league players  an optional and deliberate decision by the players themselves. And/or having people more aware of the rank of their opponents and the resulting consequences of  the match in question.
planetaryannihilation,369h1g,corobo,1 point,Sun May 17 23:45:17 2015 UTC,"I gotta be honest I think they have to start over marketing-wise. I believe, at least for me, the hype fizzled out when they had their first non-early-access release and the community shat all over it saying it was unfinished. It's also really hard to find decent actual game play footage anywhere. A lot of it is the commentated pro game event sort of play, which doesn't really show much of anything (They are often zoomed out to the planet view, I can't see any of the game from there! Might as well be showing me a spreadsheet of the play-by-play!). I know it sounds silly too, and it is, but I've not really seen any of the big faces of strategy mentioning it either (think TotalBiscuit, etc). Makes you wonder what it's missing to not draw those types in  I love strategy games, I even own PA. Heck I backed at the $90 level way back when. I've just got no drive to actually reinstall it and give it a go. I feel like I've missed the boat on PA, anyone playing now is going to be a top level player I'd stand no chance against. Instantly losing a strategy game is boring.  This is all just my own opinion of course, I can't speak for anyone else  Edit: Having just had another look for videos, the planets seem tiny! I don't know whether that was just bad luck on my part but wow. It's like Sim City all over again, there's nowhere to build anything!  Do you pretty much have to be on separate planets to play this thing? What's the point in ground units?"

planetaryannihilation,368e11,dom314,3,Sun May 17 05:03:43 2015 UTC,"Uber 7 I think? Really though I don't deserve that rank since I am super rusty and it's more because there are currently many Uber ranked players that are inactive.  If you are really keen on learning to play this game well, the way I started was by watching lots of videos, especially POV(Point of View) videos. Play multiplayer, people are stronger opponents than AI. Join a clan, it's fantastic way to find like-minded people.  There are many factors that dictate the state of play. Map control is a really big factor, because more map control -> more metal -> more units. I say map control is important, but it's not the only way to win. Spending too much of your economy on getting more economy can set you behind an opponent with less aggressive expansion and more aggressive unit builds.  Generally speaking, large maps means heavy eco is better; while smaller maps make an emphasis on unit production stronger.  The biggest tip? Have fun, take every loss as a big opportunity to learn, use that amazing chronocam and learn from your opponent. It's hard to learn the balance of all the competing trade-offs, but watching others play, and seeing how they beat you is a great way to fill in those blanks."

planetaryannihilation,35z2h8,MrMusAddict,4,Thu May 14 18:38:51 2015 UTC,"Don't play galactic war, it isnt good way to learn to play atm, just play skirmish. You can adjust your or enemy economy rate in lobby if you feel like it. Also, it's really usefull to use ChronoCam after game and see what enemy did and what you did and then try to figure what you did wrong. One common mistakes is to do too many fabbers, too few factories and not to expand.  edit: This seems to be pretty good, just ignore the proxy base thing, its not that viable anymore. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d64NelBT3CU"
planetaryannihilation,35z2h8,Jonuz,2,Thu May 14 19:05:53 2015 UTC,"Ok I will throw out a couple pointers.  First, building much base defense is usually a bad idea.  In general Defense in this game is just not very powerful.  Second is that you want to be always sitting at as little metal as possiable.  If you are maxing out your storage that is wasted money.  Third is that the AI is actually quite good in this game they put a lot of time into it.  Its not perfect at all but very beatable.  Finally I will say that you can watch replays of the top ranked games right from the game client.  This is a great help to learn starting build orders and see how very good players manage their econ/ expansion.  One of the things that is very very different from say starcraft is that you massively expand early here.  A metal extractor pays for itself very quickly vs. a command center and SCV's in starcraft.  Watch some vids and it will really highlight the differences for you.  Edit, also you can change the AI difficulty when in the game setup of a you V A.I. match."
planetaryannihilation,35z2h8,Vorsmyth,2,Thu May 14 18:58:43 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend starting off by doing AI skirmishes on normal difficulty and just doing single planet systems. Get used to the idea of making an army quick. Remember, if you're in the blue for metal and energy, that means you need another factory pumping out troops, green is ideal. And while you're playing try to keep in mind that at least half of the metal reserves are yours, so don't be afraid to get them/take them away from the enemy. I'm still not great at it, but raiding seems to be essential too. Keep your enemy on his toes and wreak as much havoc as you can to keep things level. The best part about this game is the fact that your armies can be ginormous, so take advantage of that. It doesn't matter if you have advanced factories and a small advanced army if a mass of Bolos and Doxs come over the horizon and lay waste to everything.  Edit: One thing that that's helped me a lot is taking advantage of the fact that your factories tell you when they aren't producing troops. You can easily click on the little icon for it in the bottom left corner of the screen when it pops up and tell it/them what to make on the fly. I never let my factories stop producing, they're running round the clock so long as I have the economy to support it. The same goes for fabrication units. If they're just sitting around doing nothing they'll let you know and you can select them quickly and easily."

It will help you learn how to play while actually watching. I highly recommend that you don't watch replays at first. Watching a replay gives you all the information at once. But in the beginning your not really gonna understand whats going on. It will be to much until you get a couple of wins and feel confortable with the basics and tactics. instead I would Highly reccomend you watch battles from the players perspective. Look for ones where they commentate on exactly what they are thinking of when they do it. That helped me alot more. After you get an idea of whats going on and how it all works you can start watching replays on PA Matches and in game and you can see how others do it.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc_ihFXaEZ8

planetaryannihilation,35z2h8,wakko15169,0,Fri May 15 00:11:40 2015 UTC,Basic Strat - Build Bot Factory first. Have bot factory build 5 Fabs. Build 2 metal extractors. Build 2 Energy Plants. Build More factories. Build MORE MORE MORE FACTORIES!! Basic economic concept is build more factories until your econ tanks and then build more econ. Eventually you will learn when to build more econ so you never tank. But the best laid plans always fail on execution so just do your best. Hope this helped you.

planetaryannihilation,35xrwc,FractalJaguar,4,Thu May 14 12:11:06 2015 UTC,"if they turtle, you win automatically by expanding and boxing them in. You don't need to rush to get victory. If your units are dying in bad trades, then you need to stop making the trades.   Victory is spelled in metal nodes. If you have more than he does you've won already, so you just need to let the game go on long enough that that metal lead becomes an army of a significant enough mass.  When faced with a turtler, you just claim all unclaimed nodes, they're yours now. You build up factories, and mix in a splash of inferno and bomb bots for the eventual push, and you just make sure he can't pull any hail mary's like a nuke, inferno drop, etc. Box him in and just build up mass then push in.  Sacrifice the occasional fighrer/bomber/scout by running it into his base just to keep tabs on what he's doing. If he's turtling in a small area, set your air factories to do a patrol around his base (select factory, hit patrol, hold shift, and draw a wide circle around his base - dont click and drag as that will send them over his base, just click draw a circle so they patrol it). This way you can be sure that you'll catch any attempt to leave the base to harass you.  If you see him going t2, you just start t2 and you'll finish it before him because of your metal lead. If you see him going orbital, same thing, you'll beat him to it. If you see nukes, don't panic unless he has a gas giant or some other income source supporting his base. If you invest 1-1 on nukes vs army, army will win. And given that he's given up so many metal nodes to turtle, it means that it's not going to be 1-1 nukes vs army since you have the lead.  Invest in a couple builders to set up walls some distance outside his base, and set up radar so you can see unit movements within his base. This way if he tries to push out, you can see him coming, position your units behind the correct walls, and push him back.  Turtling's a losing game, you just need to keep your patience and take all of the metal nodes that he's giving up on by turtling. Let him make his mistake, and don't throw away units - eventually you'll eclipse him. Just box him in, scout what he's doing, and claim all the metal you can."

You just need to know that, counterintuitively, playing a bigger galaxy is easier because you find more tech between fights. The other thing to realize is that this game is a always a race.

planetaryannihilation,35qt17,FloobLord,5,Tue May 12 22:41:37 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling the game was more about the engine than the experience, they clearly invested a lot in developing the tech behind the game which - impressive as it is - didnt necessarily translate into a compelling experience.  The biggest problem for me is despite the trailer, the experience is a bit bland. The units dont have a lot of personality, it's all a bit samey. It's obvious they wanted to address this with their second project with this engine tech... it's a real shame that game didnt get funded.  A single faction again makes this worse. People enjoy choosing a side and learning it, competing against those on the ""other"" side. I really think Uber underestimated the psychological investment that people develop when choosing a faction.

The burden is on Uber to make a game that people are ""overwhelmingly positive"" for, not on gamers to love whatever they trot out.

planetaryannihilation,35r0xg,FloobLord,6,Tue May 12 21:13:26 2015 UTC,"Those three (teleport, astraeus, and unit cannon) are the only way to get troops to another planet.   There are three more ways to destroy a planet- nukes, haleys, and catalysts.   Nukes- End game weapon, can be fired between planets. Slow to build and expensive. Can be defended against with Anti-nukes, which can each shoot down three nukes. Good idea to get an anti-nuke up ASAP, that screwed me this morning.  Haleys- Big engines which can be used to push moons into planets, destroying large sections of them. Look at the planet list in the upper right. Hover over the planet- if there is one or more icon's under the name, you can move it with that many Haleys. Once you've built them, click the dropdown list and there should be a button next to the name. Click it, then select the enemy's base you want to destroy. The problem is that Haleys also destroy the moon, so if you had a lot of stuff there, get it off first! Sometimes this can get a little glitchy.  Catalysts- Some systems have ""metal planets"" that look a little like the Death Star. Land some T2 fabbers on the planet and start setting up catalysts at the blue boxes around the north pole. Once all 5 have catalysts on them, you can destroy planets the same way you use the Haley, except the Catalyst is much more efficient. Basically a checkmate. A lot of matches evolve into a fight over the metal planet.  Happy Annihilation!"

Shame about the memory leaks and performance bugs that never got fixed.  I still get frequent unit path finding bugs, V shaped terrain seems to still capture units which is pretty basic path finding stuff.

planetaryannihilation,359oe5,Quitchy,3,Fri May 8 07:24:12 2015 UTC,"Added stuck detection for AI area build task.   Does this mean my commander will stop randomly getting stuck on buildings when assigned tasks? I hope so.  Overall these seem like solid tweaks to make the AI more competent. That said, they still need better reaction plans. For example I send in an air strike team that doesn't take out the commander, but it does cause serious damage. The AI will sit on its ass and not consider building some AA's (or keeping its commander near those AA turrets) in preparation for another strike.  Same with nukes. I'll nuke their base, they have time to rebuild, and... don't build any anti-nukes. I have to assume it's prioritizing other things first, but strikes and nuclear drops should push those defenses closer to the top."
planetaryannihilation,359oe5,NEREVAR117,2,Fri May 8 09:25:03 2015 UTC,"It will come down to whether it can afford it. The AI will build AA based on how it feels its anti-air compares to your bomber forces. If it's nuked and doesn't have an anti-nuke it will heavily prioritise building one. The worse the AI's intelligence (scouting) the worse it plays because it doesn't have good visibility of the threat, rather like a real human player.  And the area build thing is likely AI only, not unit behaviour. I expect it means the AI will assign it to something else instead."

planetaryannihilation,359wqe,Boogiewoo0,1 point,Fri May 8 15:48:04 2015 UTC,"That's not been my experience with the laser. It's more like players are bogged down mid-war and someone rapidly builds the catalyst in a couple minutes then blows everyone else away very quickly. If you get 30+ fabbers on it, it takes little time to construct.  The whole thing feels a little cheap."
planetaryannihilation,359wqe,TheChance,3,Fri May 8 16:29:51 2015 UTC,"I confess that I haven't played in a really long time, but my take has always been that, if there's a metal planet, it's everybody's job to keep each others' fabbers off it.

planetaryannihilation,359wqe,DeathByDenim,2,Fri May 8 13:21:55 2015 UTC,It's easier to understand if you see it in terms of game modes. A system with one annihilaser means it's a King of the Hill match. A system with two or more annihilaser means it is an economy race.
planetaryannihilation,359wqe,ValluZXC,1 point,Fri May 8 14:35:08 2015 UTC,It's meant to end the game. You're supposed to make sure he never finishes building it.

Click a building, then look on the right side of the screen. You'll see at the bottom of the sidebar something that looks like a stop sign. Click it. Now it looks like a recycle sign. This is infinite build. Always do this. Build a fabber- unit on the far left. This is how you build anything- they are key to winning. There's a bunch of unit types in the fabber menu- from left to right they are Orbital, Naval, Air, Bots, Vehicles. All are viable choices. I tend to start with bots because they are versatile and cheap, but a lot of people prefer vehicles because they are tougher.   (Hint: Don't neglect Orbital! It's expensive, but very powerful. Become a master of the orbital game and a lot of people will fall because they ignore it.)    Top right are Metal and Energy. You can only build metal at certain spots- build it constantly and defend them well. Energy you can place anywhere- Assign a couple fabbers to build lots and lots of these. Click and drag to build multiple buildings.   (Hint: Hold down shift to tell the fabber to build more things once it's done with the first set.)   Top center are your Metal and Energy reserves. Simple rules- green is good. Red is bad- build more Metal or Energy buildings. Blue is bad, too. Immediately below the Metal and Energy buildings on the fabber menu are Metal and Energy storage. Remember I said blue was bad? Blue means you're wasting resources. Build a few of these to store them in. You only need a few. Once you've done that, you'll want to get T2 up (the blue buildings above your normal factories). It's expensive, but powerful. I'll let you figure most of that out on your own, but once you have a T2 fabber, build an Anti-Nuke ASAP and make sure your Commander is near it. They take a while to get up and getting nuked really wrecks your day.   That's the basics! I know this looks like a lot right now, but play a couple games against a ""Normal"" AI and it'll all seem easy soon enough!  (A few more HINTS: Cntrl-click a unit in a factory to make it build one of that unit immediately. Useful when you need a scout or a fabber fast.  In the center panel of the fabber menu, bottom right, is an Umbrella. It shoots down orbital units, it's pretty sweet.  Right next to the Metal and Energy buildings is your radar. It won't work without energy ;-)  The combat fabber bot is better than you think. It heals your units, making them last longer. Plus, mines are fun. A little expensive, but fun.  I didn't really cover defensive structures here, they're in the center panel of the fabber menu. Build a lot of them. Walls are useful early game, but get flattened later game. A lot of people here sneer at turtles (defensive players with lots of walls and turrets), but IME an all-offensive player is easily defeated once you get in their base. The trick is finding a happy medium.)"

I have an option to toggle lock poles (I think this is from a mod? can't remember.) So i align north at the start of a match and then go free camera to play. If i start getting disoriented ill toggle lock poles on and off really quick to go back to the orientation i began with. This is the best method I've found and after a while it becomes second nature and you'll start needing to align less often.  And good question about Queue up units. Hotbuild allows you to press keys to select which units to build. Theres also a way to bind ""Select all factories on screen"" to a key . SO when Im in the first 3 minutes I can easily press F1 (not default binding!) then ""E"" to spawn a fabber quick. Start thinking about setting up simple build ques that you set to endless loop as your longterm solution to this. I find that for every factory that I build the first of (first bot factory, first air factory, etc) I make a fabber as part of the endless loop to always be supplying up without having to think about it. just make it sparse so you dont overbuild fabbers which will hurt your eco."

On the other hand, there are sometimes options. Blob of Dox? Hit it with Bumblebees. Orca fleet? Meet it with Barracudas. Bolo army? Throw up some walls.

That came from maneuvers, raiding, micro and counters. If you assume that both players expand at the same rate, the difference that will express itself in victory is between how they react to changing tactics, how well they raid their opponent, and how they micro their forces.  And I've totally seen massive back and forth between two players of similar skill level. A good player doesn't just march a blob unless that's the best move. there is a massive amount of depth to how to manage your units, how to mix them together, when to split them, and there are most definitely one off tactics (inferno drop anyone?) that can completely flip the poles on a fight.  If you're losing consistently to a ""larger blob"" it means you're not scouting, expanding, spending and raiding enough. Personally I love that PA doesn't have a buildup phase like SCII, the action starts instantly, and every action can tip the tide."

planetaryannihilation,32ttm0,TechStack,4,Thu Apr 16 18:19:28 2015 UTC,"Yes! Out of all the features they said they were going to implement, multi-monitor support is the one I want the most. I hate having to use the PIP, obscuring part of my view when I have 2 other monitors going unused.  My ideal implementation would be the ability to create as many new views as I want (like additional PIPs) and be able to drag them around (across all monitors), and resize/minimize/maximize them."
planetaryannihilation,32ttm0,davedontmind,-6,Fri Apr 17 09:44:55 2015 UTC,Do you also want 1 FPS per monitor too? It seems like one of those things you would use for 30 seconds then never use again.

I never suffer from frame rate problems in PA using the Picture-In-Picture. I don't see why being able to put the PIP on a 2nd monitor would make a massive difference to FPS - it has to render the same amount of information, albeit scaled somewhat larger.   I'd also love the ability to enable as many additional views as my system can cope with (on as many monitors as I want).  In my experience, the only performance issues I've seen have been server-side, when there are significant amounts of units. Client-side performance hasn't been an issue for me at all."

planetaryannihilation,32buj3,Khalys,1 point,Tue Apr 14 04:35:49 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend just playing AI skirmishes to begin with. I think learning the 1v1 game teaches you a lot about the game, how to handle your economy, etc. You can then use that knowledge to great effect in team games and FFAs.  Galactic War is due a big update soon, I wouldn't touch it until then personally. It is far from finished and still, I think, a bit buggy.  Pick a map like Forge, do 1v1 AI skirmishes on Normal, and then go to Hard, Relentless, and Absurd as and when you get better.  Last time I tried the AI I had to bump up the Absurd setting to at least 2x eco boost to make it challenging.

In low rank the battle are quite slow so players have a lot of time to react. And fo this dynamic gameplay lokie you said you need APM ^

The effect of running slightly into the red on metal is fairly negligible as floating metal  will have a similar effect on overall production. That said, where metal consumption is stressed, I have experienced a significant slowdown in production. I can only theorise that the production slowdown is linked somehow to the efficiency stat and no longer limited to just power stalling."

I think its because of the 10-1 rule aka you should be making 10 comments for each post.   Second bomber snipes are annoying as shit but are a solid reason as to why you should own the air game. Proxy bases with fighters on constant production are usually a good idea if your scouts are finding mass bombers as they can intercept snipes quickly. Static AA around your base (flak cannons to deal with snipes) are also good. If you plan it well enough and you dont just fold in the airgame department youll never get successfully sniped with bombers (fucking ssx spam is a different story however, anchors and avengers dont kill them fast enough)"

planetaryannihilation,3249vc,Raymanic,1 point,Mon Apr 13 06:36:47 2015 UTC,"Kinda harsh to say Uber were 'wrong' about balance. There will always be room for different playstyles and so on. Uber were awesome enough to write the engine in such a way that it makes modding quite easy, allowing for the Realm and others to completely overhaul unit and building data and come up with rebalance mods that have a particular theme."
planetaryannihilation,3249vc,friendlydonger,4,Tue Apr 14 13:21:08 2015 UTC,"Whilst in sense I do see their idea to make their own style of balance, I just feel it is wrong because it has led so many units and features subject to power creep, as well as having complete unbalance in certain areas. Etc Infernos being completely useless outside of a Pelican Hotdrop scenario, levellers victim to insane power creep, Skitters completely outclassed by firefly, T1 Bomber is still god forsakenly OP, Dox work every map while bolos are situational, Only 1 AA ground unit and its ineffective against bomber spams and snipes, Defences being useless because Sheller creep is able to win the game, Orbital is still a 'Who has more avengers' instead of a proper rock-paper-scissors matchup like ground war, T2 completely invalidates T1 (with the exception of spinners), as well as a  whole variety of other issues."
planetaryannihilation,3249vc,FractalJaguar,2,Fri Apr 17 14:32:13 2015 UTC,"I dont have an issue contering any of these... And flame tanks are meant for close quarters, on a small moon or rock they rule. Also as a t1 siege weapon they do their job if you have to break a bases defenses, unless he got t2 but t2 is supposed to own t1. Same with spinners and fireflies. Build some t2 fighters if your opponent has got so far ahead in the air game. You cant expect any tactic to always work. Spinners are great, fireflies counter that tactic, t2 air and air defense counter fireflies. But if you have superiour eco, something like 5 times as much as your opponent you can build enough fireflies to rule all land, as it should be. There should perhaps be a t2 air defense units for vehicles and armies. A flak cannon of sorts. Fireflies can take out flak cannons in great enough numbers but it is very costly."
planetaryannihilation,3249vc,FractalJaguar,1 point,Mon Apr 20 06:31:03 2015 UTC,"1) Infernos are not useless. They tank damage like a boss so they're great for drawing fire, great for protecting commanders against boombots etc.  2) Levellers are a bit crap, yes. Not sure what you mean by power creep, but the turn rate of their turrets means you have to micro them a bit and I thus avoid them. Urgh! They used to be great!  3) Skitters aren't outclassed by fireflies! If you go vehicle factory first, they're your scouting option, and they work just great. Why do you think fireflies outclass them? Yes I think they ahve a bit more range, but that's it.  4) t1 bomber isn't OP imho.  5) I strongly think dox need to have their AA capability removed. Bring back the Stinger!  6) point defence is intentionally weak i think and I like it that way.  7) Orbital definitely needs work, agreed with you on that one. Apparently the Orbital Overhaul mod is pretty good but from what I've seen I think it might go a bit too far.  8) T2 should invalidate T1? I'm ok with shifting to T2 entirely if the game is long enough. I know some people want T2 to be functionally different to T1 so you're forced to use both, but I really don't see how that works.  Anyway I don't think Uber have done much 'wrong' regarding the balance. Yes they've made a few mistakes and some units are a bit weak and so on, but I'm confident that over time they will settle on something really good. And if people fancy a different kind of game, they can use balance mods or make their own.  edit: formatting"

planetaryannihilation,320k28,Boogiewoo0,3,Thu Apr 9 17:08:27 2015 UTC,"I think that might be my problem- I tend to use T1 fabbers well into the late game, so maybe they're sucking down power but not really contributing.

There's always SSX, unit cannons if you're having difficulty penetrating the orbital layer. Don't forget about the catalyst laser either... well, this gets back into effective usage of resources. I think SSX drop might currently be the efficient kill once things get ""out of hand"" so to speak. They can take multiple hits from an umbrella and deal quite a bit of damage.   I would think SSX would be harder to defend. You can have a nearly unlimited density of SSX, but you can only place as many umbrellas as you have space for."

We don't have numbers on the playerbase except for Steam stats, and so many people play using the Uber launcher that those numbers aren't really reliable. Arguably, Steam users are more likely to leave the game (casual players, basically).  So don't be all doom and gloom dude, the end isn't near. What we need is for some major updates (this latest one with save/load and GW save/load is a critical one), and then some publicity work from Uber.

planetaryannihilation,31d2xn,Quitchy,1 point,Sat Apr 4 09:13:23 2015 UTC,"That is true, there's a lot of counters to hard defensive, where defensive has a faint chance to make a comeback."
planetaryannihilation,31d2xn,otterfamily,3,Sat Apr 4 14:48:57 2015 UTC,"Nope. They're fine. You just didn't attack him properly. Boom bots would take down that wall right away, because the primary problem those turrets have is re-targetting time.  So just throw a wave of booms, and then your tanks will actually hit the turrets. Firing at a wall while a turret fires back is going to always be a bad trade, so the solution is just to not make the bad trade.  But basically the reason that the t3 turrets arent overpowered is that in order to get them (and be sure that they're only fighting t1 from you - and therefore not getting shelled), he had to abandon the whole planet, meaning he loses anyway.  Half of the metal on the planet is yours by right, and then you only win by taking more than that. Giving up what's yours in order to turtle is never a winning strat."
planetaryannihilation,31d2xn,_Ev4l,2,Sat Apr 4 14:19:36 2015 UTC,"I disagree, those are top end turrets(tier 3 turrets) walled in at some places. It does not get any better than that (aside from an anchor). Meanwhile your sending tier one units at them and expecting it to cheese on through.  Do they need more buffs? no. They are fine right now they serve their purpose(they can actually defend a location imagine that), they also put you at a disadvantage (its hard to expand once you placed them).  In my eyes they'd only be broken if you could chain turret to an enemy base or expand via turrets which both are not viable. If you could do either of those, then yes; it is too much.   Lastly, there are many forms of counter to these types of bases aside from throwing units at it, such as: nukes, halkins, pelters or catapults will make quick work of those structures from afar."

planetaryannihilation,3171t6,beefzilla,4,Thu Apr 2 15:38:32 2015 UTC,"On land it's primarily about composition, and also how Queller uses Dox to shutdown early expansion. Notice how orange responds to losing the air war by putting out Spinners.  On naval you'll note Queller gets in the water a lot faster and doesn't suffer from the vanilla AI issue of sucking on the northern island.  On orbital you'll see Queller much quicker about dominating planets it owns and launching invasions on a scale vanilla doesn't. A good point to note is when Queller green lands on the metal planet look at what vanilla has and imagine whether it would stand up to what Queller just put through the teleporter."

But, it's been my own fault for not scouting my opponent very well; if I had, I'd have seen what he was up to and prepared better air defence.

I would like to see the inclusion of asteroid belts that are the only objects that players can build Halleys on.  Moons and planets would be too massive for Halleys to work.  However, if you and an opponent both have enough Halleys on separate asteroids, and your opponent launches theirs at a target, you can launch yours on an intercept course.  You counter their smash by smashing your asterioid into theirs.  The countersmash would fail if their target was close enough, and your counteroid wasn't able to get there in time.  Their roid impacts with the target, and yours is now in a new orbit, which may or may not impact with other planets/asteroids."
planetaryannihilation,30eczp,funny_little_birds,3,Thu Mar 26 20:16:06 2015 UTC,"Could have big asteroids that are scripted after between X and Y minutes (so there's a window of question) that they will split one or two little asteroids off. The little ones can be halley'd, but the big one can't and is too unstable to build on or send orbital units to (asteroids hit them and blow them up). That way, as soon as the little asteroid breaks off there is a race for dominance to claim it and build Halleys. If two broke off then there's a dash for them, or more.  This would make it a gamble to wait for an asteroid play as plauers would be kinda unsure if it would even pop, or be controllable when it did. It would also make this a more long game strategy, though the time that must pass for the asteroid splits could be set to 0 or infinite, or maybe set at 5, 10, 20 minutes, or never. Or maybe set to crack sometime randomly between 10 minutes and 40. There's a lot of possibilities...and this may be way more complicated than what the devs have in mind. It would make for a neat mod."

planetaryannihilation,30b03d,Quitchy,2,Wed Mar 25 22:25:17 2015 UTC,"Invasions are good. Some factors outside my control, such as the way it doesn't land a fabber above the spot of its first build, and not rallying troops to teleporters on planets where there's no other threat. But that's outside my control. The biggest problem is that it will invade without intelligence, leading to invasion stalls.  Queller doesn't like sending fabbers to invaded worlds because I think the orbital fabber is interfering with the check. Even then it would only send one and then rely on factories to make more. I think I have a hack which will improve the situation.  Not sure of orbital radars ending up at gas giants is a bug or the AI collating its forces at a central location for distribution. I think the former so I'm putting in a workaround for that too.  Late game economy is a little rough, but I think that's because it won't send fabbers to worlds it invades so it can't continue to grow its economy. It's also not using gas giants as well as it could so I'm working on that."

planetaryannihilation,302ic1,DeathByDenim,2,Mon Mar 23 23:29:03 2015 UTC,"This game is a bit different from Supcom and TA in the sense that the commander has more starting metal and energy. The commander himself creates 20 metal per second, and energy as well. You can build 2 factories without even making any metal extractors and you'll have enough metal for them just from the commanders metal production. Another thing is factories are a lot more efficient than assist building (at level 1 at least), so you want a lot of factories instead of assist building. Another change is that fabbers use more energy than in games like supcom and TA. (this is just my initial impression)  You really need at least one factory for every 2 metal extractors, +2 factories to spend what the commander makes. So this is why when the game is 7 minutes in the other guy probably has factories everywhere.   if you go to http://pa-db.com/ you can see exactly how much stuff costs, how much is produced etc."

But I wouldn't mind having less problems with pathfinding. :/ While GW is severely neglected I do think it is correct to prioritize save/load and balancing before making big changes in how GW works. It really needs something like techpoints to spend on a techtree to balance out the randomness of looted tech.

The first 4-5 minutes are very important, try different strategies out to see how you can get out as many units as possible. This is called starting build, if you didn't know.  In most cases your first ~5 factories should be T1 factories, and you seldom want to build more than 5-6 fabbers during the first ~5 minutes.  Remember that aggression is important in this game, use your early units for stopping your opponent from grabbing metal extractors. That way you'll win just by having more metal to spend in factories than him.  Always build moar stuff; grab metal, build power, build factories..."

planetaryannihilation,2zlhoq,DarkDosman,3,Thu Mar 19 16:04:04 2015 UTC,"Personally I feel the game is lacking unit variety.  TA had lots of unique units that had different battlefield roles.  Perhaps not all of them necessary or vital, but it meant there were different strategies to try.  SupCom was the same, plenty of different units to choose from, many of them specialists that weren't exactly useful all the time but could make a difference when used correctly.  PA has the same few units for each vehicle type (the scout, main attack, artillery and heavy) as well as a few extras that fill specific roles but perhaps aren't available in every factory (AA, suicide bomber) but nothing anywhere near the variety its predecessors had.  Orbital feels boring.  There is one unit able to actually attack other units, the rest are just space buildings.  The space launch animation is awful, the graphics for the orbital paths are terrible, the space buildings all look similar and boring, the gas extraction jig with its weird pipe especially so.  Also, the terrain generator doesn't have enough parts to build interesting maps.  It just splats a few brushes down and leaves the rest as empty plains.  Terrain is, at best, a hindrance to base building.  It provides no tactical advantage as there is so little of it its completely inconsequential to unit pathing.  Finally, it in no way lives up to the promotional video shown off when the kickstarter began.  The art style is way more boring than the nice cartoony graphics they showed, there are no asteroid fields, I don't get nice three stage rockets that will take my commander to a new planet (instead you get a crappy looking grabby claw which can apparently fly to the surface and then back to space, making me wonder why it even needs to use a launch vehicle to reach space in the first place), I don't get a unit cannon that can fire my units to another planet and I don't get those cool looking jetpack robots.  We don't even have the gameplay promised in the original pitch.  Where are the forty man matches that go for hours?  That sounded epic.  Granted we can have large matches, but they are often over in an hour or two.  Perhaps that's to some players' tastes, but it's not what I pledged for.  So, TL;DR: The game still feels half finished.  The units feel place holder, there's no unit variety, the planets are boring and we still don't even have the units and buildings shown in the original promo video (eg. unit cannon can't fire between planets, at least it couldn't last I checked)."

It may end up a pretty good game, but its not going restart RTS games. The spherical multi map concept just make the gameplay too difficult for the casual player to get into it as a competetive game. Competetive gameplay exists, but there are a few reasons preventing it from growing."
planetaryannihilation,2zlhoq,Gunshinn,5,Thu Mar 19 22:14:28 2015 UTC,"just my opinion, but I dont think that is even the issue. there are lots of rts games people arent great at playing competitively but they still love playing it anyways.  the problem is that the game was pitched as ""if you liked supcom, you'll love this."" it really isnt anything like supcom. other than being able to zoom out and see icons for units, and having a commander unit, they are nothing alike.   supcom had more fun base building with stuff like adjecency bonuses, and other defenses. turtling was much more viable, but in PA the way to win is to play super duper aggro. memorize the most productive build order and just spam units. win on economy. there just isnt enough micro and small scale tactics.   the single player is also not particularly fun. (i havnt played in a while, so maybe they changed it) but i found it utterly stupid to have to unlock different the different units and stuff. effectively cutting out half the content on each play through is not a good way to add content to a game.   the whole point of single player/skirmish modes is to give players a chance to use all the units...it should be a little bit sandboxy in that regard. PA doesnt make it easy to test things out or try new units that you really want to play with.   i also feel like there arent enough unit types. the game just feels like an arcade rts without enough depth or complexity."
planetaryannihilation,2zlhoq,fight_for_anything,5,Fri Mar 20 01:52:13 2015 UTC,Are they ever going to implement asteroids?
planetaryannihilation,2zlhoq,fansgesucht,1 point,Thu Mar 19 19:54:37 2015 UTC,"No need, they wouldn't be filling any role that isn't already there. Unless they were to implement large-scale interplanetary space battles and therefore allow an asteroid belt to be a whole other kind of battlefield (sort of like how gas giants are orbital exclusive)."
planetaryannihilation,2zlhoq,Lurking4Answers,1 point,Thu Mar 19 23:34:41 2015 UTC,"Well sure they dont fill a role that has not been filled, but the concept would certainly be far more interesting than the stale gameplay interplanetary nukes provided."

planetaryannihilation,2zlhoq,ColaColin,2,Fri Mar 20 12:49:17 2015 UTC,"I actually think it should replace the interplanetary nuke rather than coexist with it =/ make nukes a resource worth fighting over, rather than just resource sink."

planetaryannihilation,2zlhoq,DeathByDenim,2,Thu Mar 19 18:13:42 2015 UTC,"I dont think that still completing roadmap 7 mount after release can be considered as adding new stuff.

planetaryannihilation,2zlhoq,Zorro_347,2,Thu Mar 19 18:38:38 2015 UTC,Why are you getting the Early Access feeling?   Can't speak for OP but to me the space part still feels like an alpha.  A simple 2D plane for everything in space with free unit movement could be so much more enjoyable.
planetaryannihilation,2zlhoq,Dushenka,4,Thu Mar 19 18:19:57 2015 UTC,"They've discussed that before and said something along the lines of it being too much of a distraction to have free range space battles like that along side the multi-planet land, air, and orbital battles already taking place. They want the battles to be focused around the planets and asteroids, not random points of empty space"
planetaryannihilation,2zlhoq,HellHat,3,Thu Mar 19 18:30:15 2015 UTC,"That's ok, but in this case they shouldn't go boasting around how PA is the next big RTS of epic scale.  IMHO, the game still feels like you play on one map. Except that map is now parted into sections with a big empty in between. All pieces are more or less the same and play the same.  PA is just another RTS, with fragmented maps."

However I can offer minor tech support to the second issue you mentioned.  The black screen is likely the game crash but skype still running is indicative of it just being the game. The black screen and not being able to quit it is due to fullscreen mode. Try ctrl+shift+escape to bring up the task manager window which will allow you to close PA process. Also try alt+tab to switch to the desktop or other windows which will minimise the game window. Hopefully this will atleast allow you to continue without rebooting.

I spawn on one, the enemy spawns on another. So I build up my planet so I have lots of resources coming in and a space transport so I can get to the other uninhabited planet and start making a FOB. So my bright idea is to send my commander to said new planet. So without checking which planet to send it to I click a spot on the planet and set it to upload automatically while I keep working on my main base. About 5 min later every unit and structure explodes....  Yep I dropped my commander in the middle of the enemy base and forgot about him...  I'm an idiot"

I wanted to scout his place out without instantly dying, so i got 40 or so pheonix's out and popped them over his planet.  Wasnt really paying attention as i was going to expand to another planet when I heard that we won. Thought the enemy team suicided their last comm because they were bored or something.

To be honest, I was sure the game had died back in October when updates had largely ceased and the lobby was empty 90% of the time.  Since Jables took over as the lead developer, though, Uber have made (and continue to make) great strides in updating the game. They've not only come through on Kickstarter promises like the Unit Cannon and save/load, but also added cool stuff like the terrain editor, and have taken suggestions from the community on improving the balance of the game.  The size of the player base is decent right now; it's been better but it's also been much, much worse. I don't play much ranked, but I can find casual games to join most of the time."

planetaryannihilation,2yq7g5,Demonox01,2,Thu Mar 12 04:11:11 2015 UTC,"That was the thing: you don't have access to fighters unless you have orbital tech.

planetaryannihilation,2yq7g5,imkrotchy,1 point,Thu Mar 12 08:41:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have ran into this problem with a battle that has 4 moons, each with a ton of metal and 4 enemy AIs. The game starts out fine, and I easily destroy the first AI. The problem is that I don't have orbital tech, so for the AIs on the other moons I have 2 options: out-turtle and nuke them all, or rush them.   If I try to out-turtle them: This strategy is the safest and probably would work the best. The problem is that the game grinds to a halt after a while, and then the game starts to break. I had an enemy fabber doing nothing in orbit with one of my ion cannons trying to shoot it and only missing. Then the game breaking issue, my antinuke failed and the enemy nuke got through and hit my 5 nuke launchers and a ton of energy plants as well as all my fabbers. Meanwhile I see an antinuke spinning around rapidly in circles in the air. The game pacing is so slow that it would take literally hours to rebuild.  If I try to rush them: I might take out another AI, but it is hard to attack the enemy while defending my moon from the enemy that just keeps spamming astraeus drops and fabbers and anchors in orbit. By the time I have taken out 2/4 AI, I now need to send massive amounts of astraeus to the enemy moons, which is difficult since they don't all arrive at the exact same time and often get shot down by massive antiair patrols and orbital defense. At that point I pretty much lose, as I didn't go for the turtle build and now the remaining AI has enough resources to nuke me into oblivion (and slow down the game to a halt).  Unit cannons should help, but I think the orbital tech should at least become more common as a battle reward or preferably orbital tech should unlock orbital factories and anchors, leaving you with astraeus, orbital fighters and fabbers that can build teleporters. I think that makes the most sense as orbital tech is pretty much required in this game to prevent stalemates, and it would make sense if it worked like the other factories except with the initial tier unlocked. (What I mean by that is that for example vehicle factories you need vehicle tech and for tier 2 vehicle factories you need tier 2 vehicle tech. Orbital tech should be the same, except with tier 1 already unlocked.)"

It should also be noted that anyone who has taken Attacking an Entrenched Opponent (Offensive Strategies 105) will easily get through any defenses erected by a player who has merely taken T101, and neither course has any prerequisites other than General RTS 100 -- which should be remedial to anyone who has ever played AoE2 or any other RTS, which is generally assumed.

planetaryannihilation,2yi1vo,otterfamily,6,Tue Mar 10 07:46:45 2015 UTC,"Star fort:       A star fort, or trace italienne, is a fortification in a style that evolved during the age of gunpowder when the cannon came to dominate the battlefield. It was first seen in the mid-15th century in Italy.  Passive ring-shaped (enceinte) fortifications of the Medieval era proved vulnerable to damage or destruction by cannon fire, when it could be directed from outside against a perpendicular masonry wall. In addition, an attacking force that could get close to the wall was able to conduct undermining operations in relative safety, as the defenders could not shoot at them from nearby walls. In contrast, the star fortress was a very flat structure composed of many triangular bastions, specifically designed to cover each other, and a ditch. In order to counteract the cannonballs, defensive walls were made lower and thicker. To counteract the fact that lower walls were easier to climb, the ditch was widened so that attacking infantry was still exposed to fire from a higher elevation for a while, including enfilading fire from the bastions. The outer side of the ditch was usually provided with a glacis to deflect cannonballs aimed at the lower part of the main wall. Further structures, such as ravelins, tenailles, hornworks or crownworks, and even detached forts could be added to create complex outer works to further protect the main wall from artillery, and sometimes provide additional defensive positions. They were built of many materials, usually earth and brick, as brick does not shatter on impact from a cannonball as stone does.   Star fortifications were further developed in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries primarily in response to the French invasion of the Italian peninsula. The French army was equipped with new cannon and bombards that were easily able to destroy traditional fortifications built in the Middle Ages. Star forts were employed by Michelangelo in the defensive earthworks of Florence, and refined in the sixteenth century by Baldassare Peruzzi and Scamozzi. The design spread out of Italy in the 1530s and 1540s.

If brown were to launch 3 nukes at him, though, he'd be in trouble.

planetaryannihilation,2yi1vo,davedontmind,2,Tue Mar 10 07:42:42 2015 UTC,i thought it wasnt finished yet. but what if the nuke was aimed at the corner? then they could just pour through the gap and ignore most of the defenses.
planetaryannihilation,2yi1vo,hungdonkey,5,Tue Mar 10 07:53:40 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong, but I don't think you get the anti-nuke missile icon over the anti-nuke icon unless the missile has finished being built.  And if the nukes hit an edge or corner beyond the range of the anti-nuke (although it looks to me like the one in the picture is aimed at the centre of the base) then, indeed, it would put a huge hole in the defenses.

It is worth a purchase, but for your first RTS game, it can be hard to get used to with the spherical maps, and multiple planets.

planetaryannihilation,2xwr3a,keithjr,5,Wed Mar 4 14:37:13 2015 UTC,PAX is a very expensive undertaking - companies only exhibit there if they feel there is potential to gain additional exposure and potential income by doing so.  I had tremendous fun on the PAX East booth last year (they even let me cast a few games) but I can see that the perceived benefit of maintaining a booth at this stage in PA's development cycle might not be as great this year.  I'd be very surprised if a few Uber employees didn't head over to walk the floor for a bit though - hopefully they'll see this thread and let you know!

planetaryannihilation,2x3zr0,Already__Taken,1 point,Tue Mar 3 01:07:31 2015 UTC,"HR looked like a good concept and people would've back it. Except that people had backed PA and were unhappy that it looked like Uber were already thinking about starting to work one something else without properly finishing PA. They felt betrayed and out of principle shouldn't back HR, until PA was finished.  I think Uber have learnt by this and are close to finishing the game as originally laid out.   Personally, I would like to see Uber re-KickStart HR once PA is complete. I think it would have a better chance."
planetaryannihilation,2x3zr0,Wookovski,1 point,Thu Mar 5 14:38:42 2015 UTC,"Since it used the same engine with similar goals of scope we could have seen much improvement with both games. However ""what could have been"" isn't an area you get to tread once you're still building a community backed game.   I just hope they see it as a reason to step it up as opposed to stop trying.   I'd like to see PA grow with more polish, then Uber should put out a DLC which basically makes a new game. Like how battlefield did back in the day of bf2:spec ops or Bad Company 2/Vietnam. Something that isn't intended to move the whole community onto more a ""Look what we could do"" piece.   With that I think people would back to hell out of something like HR."
planetaryannihilation,2x3zr0,Already__Taken,0,Thu Mar 5 16:15:08 2015 UTC,So the game was (like MWO) feature incomplete at release.. ouch..  Did those features from 'after release' go in before or after the HR kickstarter started?

planetaryannihilation,2x3zr0,Jonuz,4,Wed Feb 25 19:05:11 2015 UTC,"Well, PA was released 9.10, offline play was released 10.10 and HR was cancelled 20.10, so most of the new stuff was released after HR cancelling but HR kickstarter was released only less than month after PA. However uber had to fire lot of people after failure of kickstarted so we can assume that those were people who would had been working with HR.  And then we got this: http://steamcommunity.com/games/233250/announcements/detail/130926883009479794 [tl;dr: today, we announced a new Kickstarter for a strategy game called Human Resources. Plans for Planetary Annihilation’s development will be unaffected. Human Resources’ team is a separate team.]"

planetaryannihilation,2x3zr0,Quitchy,12,Wed Feb 25 14:44:57 2015 UTC,"The ""reputation"" Uber got was for SMNC, a game they continued to support for seven months after the PA Kickstarter went live. They continued to support it despite the fact that they never made any money from it, it fact it was nothing but a money loser for them. And it's not like they've taken the servers down like EA.  Basically, it's a reputation invented by idiots."
planetaryannihilation,2x3zr0,robber364,4,Wed Feb 25 14:28:59 2015 UTC,"To be fair, some of the negative feelings sprung from their decision to release the game incomplete in the first place. The negative reviews that the game received at the time of 1.0 were generally bad, but fair at the time. Now the game is fine, but the reviews aren't changing. I love this game, but that decision has effectively limited the growth of the community, maybe even permanently."
planetaryannihilation,2x3zr0,robber364,2,Wed Feb 25 14:57:27 2015 UTC,"Coming from the outside, I would say that my impressions of Uber are very much colored by reading about how they kickstarted a new game before they had finished delivering missing features from the kickstarter of the previous one.  I actually view it as a good thing that projects like HR and /r/TransverseTheGame fail - companies that crowd fund games have to learn to deliver on their promises if they want to crowd fund anything in the future.  It's a shame that Uber and PGI didn't think they had to deliver before starting a new kickstarter, but I think the lesson is one the games industry has to learn.  Stand and deliver on your past promises or pack it in."
planetaryannihilation,2x3zr0,Quitchy,5,Wed Feb 25 15:04:38 2015 UTC,"Fair point I guess, but as someone who has watched this thing unfold from the start you should give uber a bit more credit than that.   A common misconception is that uber rushed the launch of the game so they could say that it was ""done"" and move on to HR. What actually happened, was they promised a boxed copy of the game to some of the tiers of kickstarted backers, and had to meet a deadline with the publisher they had for that. I don't know the specifics (i.e. If they were legally bound to hit that deadline, what their options were, etc.) but I can understand how it happened anyway. It's easy to say in hindsight ""well they never should have made an agreement like that"", but they had to to make good on the kickstarter.   The release of the HR kickstarter was poorly timed as well, but there is a reason for that too. At the time, most of the art assets for PA were done, and uber had the decision to either fire them, or get them working on something else. They had an excellent idea for game with a unique art style and they went for it. Good ideas, bad timing.   I dunno, maybe it's just how closely I have been able to follow PA vs The MWO thing, but it seems disingenuous to equate uber to PGI, as I don't attribute the state of PA to malicious intent."
planetaryannihilation,2x3zr0,Quitchy,2,Wed Feb 25 17:57:44 2015 UTC,"I was unaware that they trapped themselves by setting a deadline to ship the physical copies.  Assuming it's true (in the sense of it was a true hard constraint they couldn't work around), it's an unfortunate own-goal by the company that snowballed with the HR kickstarter."
planetaryannihilation,2x3zr0,nateious,4,Wed Feb 25 18:16:03 2015 UTC,"This is the issue with Kickstarting your game, people don't understand game development. If they waited until they had delivered all elements of PA they'd no longer have the art team necessary to do HR, because the art side of PA was completed long before the engineering side was. See inXile's Torment Kickstarter video (which is also an example of how to do this).  I would agree that Uber really made a mess of how they positioned themselves in the Kickstarter, and releasing the game as a 1.0 at that time was a big mistake."
planetaryannihilation,2x3zr0,Gunshinn,2,Wed Feb 25 15:27:01 2015 UTC,"I think the problems run deeper than that, and that they aren't limited to the consumer side of the equation - the companies doing kickstarter projects are also very much to blame for putting out wild lists of claimed features and then letting them drop when it gets too inconvenient to follow through.   Some of it is just bad apples like that Maksim Pashnin guy who kickstarted confederate express, allegedly was the airbnb squatter. He tried to early access a second game called knuckle club, but to date hasn't delivered on either game! Others like Peter Molyneux (sp?) complained that he felt he had to exaggerate and promise features that would never come out to have a successful kickstarter campaign for Godus, and we can see how that turned out.   Similarly the developers of elite dangerous decided to not bother with an offline mode (which they stated would be in during the kickstarter) but waited until ~1 month before launch - I feel it would be wrong to buy that game until and unless they deliver on the offline mode, since supporting a developer that plays bait and switch sends the wrong message to the industry. Piranha games of MWO infamy did things like pitch their game as being a 1pv simulator but then forced 3pv in as the default view mode and stripped out the simulation elements to 'broaden the appeal' while simultaneously telling people who had backed the original feature list that they were no longer the target audience (though they couldn't get a refund, of course....).  Also they decided to kickstart a second MMO while the core persistent universe of their original game was 2 years late, and hadn't come out yet!  The balls to do that while claiming they were making great progress....   Yes many studios do make mistakes with their staffing and utilization of talent so we get lovely things like DLC, followed by day 1 DLC, followed by on disc DLC, now followed by starting new games before the previous one is feature complete, but frankly I think this trend needs to be stopped.  The best way to stop this trend is to make sure that companies who do any of the above find only failure in subsequent kickstarter campaigns.  A few high profile scalps nailed to the figurative wall will dissuade scam artists and underachievers alike."
planetaryannihilation,2x3zr0,Already__Taken,3,Wed Feb 25 16:34:41 2015 UTC,"I think it's more that consumers are incredibly naive about the realities of game development, and likewise several companies have been naive in how they approached the matter with their customers."

You can certainly preview all available spawn-points in the map editor, and it might possible to set one-per-planet, which would force the AI to take one on another planet.  If you're looking to just play around, you can severely handicap the AI by setting their eco multiplier in the lobby (that little number next to their name usually at 1.0) to 0.1 or 0.2, which will cripple them, and slow their expansion down dramatically."

planetaryannihilation,2wkyga,BrianPurkiss,8,Sat Feb 21 06:46:43 2015 UTC,"A wild Brian appeared!   I'm still here. I lurk here and on the forums. I slowly became less and less active for a variety of reasons.  It started with getting bored of the game. The balance was quite poor, and casting games got boring because most every game was pretty much the same. And since I had been going full throttle in the PA Community for over a year and a half... geeze, or is it coming up on two years? I got way burnt out.   Not to mention running PA Matches was a ton of work. PA Matches is a MASSIVE website. I built, wrote, and maintained the entire thing. I took it from no one knowing about it, to over 2 million pageviews within 14 months. It was incredible. It was just a lot of work. I had asked for help on several occasions and no one really stepped up. PA Matches still gets a ton of traffic though.  As for casting... Casting is a big ordeal. It takes up several hours of my time to find a video, record a video, edit the video, export, and upload. And since I wasn't enjoying the game, I stopped casting.   I hear the balance has gotten better, so I've been meaning to come back, but nowadays I'm very busy with Shallow Space.   Shallow Space is a 3D Space RTS game that I'm helping build and it is awesome. I am so dang excited about this game. We have a Kickstarter coming up at the end of March, so it's less than a month away! Building a Kickstarter marketing campaign is a lot of work. My mornings and afternoon are work, and my evenings are Shallow Space, and my weekends are Shallow Space with a little bit of casual video gaming mixed in. I have very little free time these days as all of my free time is taken up by Shallow Space.  If y'all want to know more about Shallow Space, check out the website or watch some of our videos. Again, we have a Kickstarter coming up in about a month, so I'd love it if y'all subscribed to the newsletter."

planetaryannihilation,2wkyga,BrianPurkiss,2,Sat Feb 21 04:03:10 2015 UTC,"Shoot, some of your Roadmap statements look like they were taking serious note of what happened with PA.   I've taken a lot of notes of what went wrong and well with PA. Because Uber certainly did a lot of things right, there were other areas that could have been done better."
planetaryannihilation,2wkyga,IOwnTwoDogs,2,Sat Feb 21 04:15:05 2015 UTC,"Yeeeep. I love the game, the style of play quite appeals to me (though I'll admit I have been spending a lot of time on large water planets with a couple moons at most, lately), and I've yet to regret my KS backing. That being said,   there were other areas that could have been done better.    On that note, though, I feel that same about Generals, RA2 and 3, SC2, etc. Seems doubtful I'll ever find a game that's absolutely perfect, so I can't really fault Uber for it. They may have been a bit ambitious to start, but whatever - it's been fun from the get-go and is only getting better, so I'm not upset.  As for Shallow Space - kind of strikes me as a Homeworld meets Elite:Dangerous, yeah? I'm liking this general trend towards 3D space stuff, maybe when (if) EA gets their shit together Generals 2 will incorporate something like this. Imagine being hooked into an Oculus Rift and switching on-the-fly from the traditional RTS overview to a cockpit view of a starfighter?! God damn that would be so cool"
planetaryannihilation,2wkyga,BrianPurkiss,2,Sat Feb 21 04:33:55 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of inspiration from Homeworld, Nexus as well. Neither James or I have played much of Elite:Dangerous, so if there's any similarities, it's coincidental. We did both play a lot of Eve, so we are pulling from that. :-)   Imagine being hooked into an Oculus Rift and switching on-the-fly from the traditional RTS overview to a cockpit view of a starfighter?! God damn that would be so cool   It would be cool, but pointless from a gameplay perspective. You can't control multiple fleets stretched out across a solar system from the cockpit of a single starfighter. It would be a gimmick at best.   However... since this is combat across a full 3D environment... And the camera can move around, up down, left and right... imagine using oculus rift for that. So the camera point of origin could be anywhere... including in the center of battle. So look left, right up, down, and behind you and there are ships flying around all over the place shooting each other. Now that? That would have more practical application AND would be cool.   That being said... let's be realistic. Oculus Rift support would be amazing, but expensive. We'd have to get a lot of funding in order to be able to do something like that."
planetaryannihilation,2wkyga,Apropos_Username,1 point,Sat Feb 21 05:20:53 2015 UTC,"It's really awesome to see someone trying to fill Homeworld's shoes and it looks like you've made a lot of progress already. I think you're dead right about the cockpit idea, but I think you're underestimating the opportunity to be had with VR:   So look left, right up, down, and behind you and there are ships flying around all over the place shooting each other.   ...and you would be able to walk (or move your head around) around the battlefield. The mouse selection metaphor might fall apart in head-tracked 3D but replace it with a 3D positional input system (like Razer's Hydra, Valve's new controller or whatever Oculus plan to release) and you would get epic immersion and control. Imagine this, this or more accurately walking through the battlefield like this.   That being said... let's be realistic. Oculus Rift support would be amazing, but expensive. We'd have to get a lot of funding in order to be able to do something like that.   I hope you're just trying to use this as justification for a high Kickstarter goal, because I can't see how it would require too much extra code; just wrap the boilerplate Oculus (or one of the other incipient HMD) SDK calls around your existing rendering code and take the HMD pose into account when calculating the view and projection matrices. It would be more expensive in terms of graphics throughput, but I would have thought that one advantage of a game set in space is that you don't need to throw polygons away on complex landscapes.  I'll probably buy your game in any case, but if you guys don't take this genre to VR somebody else will."
planetaryannihilation,2wkyga,BrianPurkiss,1 point,Fri Mar 6 10:53:16 2015 UTC,"VR support is way more than just ""wrapping the code."" If it was that simple, everyone would do it. And right now VR is a very small market, if we went for a very high KS goal just for VR, it would backfire because very few people actually have VR right now."
planetaryannihilation,2wkyga,ryati,0,Fri Mar 6 14:24:02 2015 UTC,"Brian, glad to hear you are doing well and the new game looks cool! I enjoyed PA Matches and was sad to see the site updates slow down, but I can understand why it happened. The game has changed a lot for the better (not that it was bad...).   If you want to get back into the community, maybe you should look into becoming a contributer at another PA website. This could let you take a more relaxing look at the game without constant updates and website maintenance. Good luck whatever direction you take!"

It's certainly not the spiritual successor to TA or SupCom we were promised, and in it's current state doesn't keep my attention. Why am I still subbed? On the hope they actually so things like address orbital and make the game complete, instead of a ""released"" alpha version with incomplete game mechanics."
planetaryannihilation,2wkyga,Gunshinn,3,Fri Feb 20 20:47:07 2015 UTC,"I still think the game has a lot of potential, especially with the changes of dev team members, so i am keeping my eye on it.

planetaryannihilation,2wkyga,NorseGod,-4,Fri Feb 20 21:29:18 2015 UTC,"Ehhh, they said the same about Rome 2. But no real fixes until Attila came out."
planetaryannihilation,2wkyga,Gunshinn,3,Fri Feb 20 21:53:41 2015 UTC,"Problem is that The Creative Assembly have only been putting out rehashed versions of the first of the total war series for a long time. The only thing they really do is upgrade the graphics and change the scenario a little. The core mechanics stay the same as much as the call of duty games do. It seems to me that they are more after the money than having a genuine passion for great RTS games.   Uber on the other hand have a vested interest in making sure this game works. The results of having a broken game can be shown by the failed kickstarter. If they had put more effort into the balance and competetive aspects before releasing the game, i and many others may have been interested in supporting that game (i already forgot its name). However, they seemingly pissed about doing various things that really did not help foster a better and bigger community, and therefor the game fell on its ass, and may not be able to recover, even though they genuinly seem to be putting a lot of effort into the balancing now (should of happened last year).  I think my biggest problem is that they have a direction for the game that was a bit too abstract and forced the game to play out awkwardly. Orbital gameplay is just plain awkward and seemingly uninteresting. Alpha was much more fun."
planetaryannihilation,2wkyga,NorseGod,3,Fri Feb 20 22:03:56 2015 UTC,"Agreed, orbital is painful. It feels much less like a cohesive space game and more like a game of several separate ""island"" maps linked together by this ether at their edges. Some units can jump from map to map, but there's nothing in between. I wanted space battles, they delivered Stargate.  The community had even shown through mods what orbital could be and Uber still seems to say, ""Meh, that's not in line with our original vision. Even if it's what players want."""
planetaryannihilation,2wkyga,MajorasAss,2,Fri Feb 20 23:34:43 2015 UTC,"What orbital needs is something other than ""spam Avengers"".  How would space battles even work? Units have to go on paths to ride gravity slingshots. Multiplanet systems are already a tedious slog, why make it worse?"

Perhaps branching this further to allow spectators to draw and ping players so they can mentor. Although this should have restriction options on visibility to stop spectators cheating.  There should be an option to highlight units so they can quickly evaluate unit compositions and numbers rather than just guessing by sight. As far as I know you can currently only highlight over individual units.  A quick snap to comms, that have been hot keyed or something to see attacks. Also an on screen interface with current comm healths.  Also, an option to increase text sizes, mainly the economies and unit counts. I'm fed up of watching twitch and casts where I cannot read these values. It'll be useful especially when people cannot cast or video in 1080 or above resolutions.

Have a factory putting out 1to5 spinner/tanks but need more tanks now? Just control click as many tanks as you want and it will get inserted to the beginning of the build queue without messing up the ratio for continuous build.

planetaryannihilation,2w3skp,FractalJaguar,3,Tue Feb 17 12:29:57 2015 UTC,"Economy is at the bottom of the skill pyramid (http://exodusesports.com/guides/the-planetary-annihilation-pyramid/ for a reason. It is the foundation of everything you will do and build). Constant expansion, constant growth (strive for it). Grab ALL the mex! Expand to ALL of the planet! Production. Loop your build queues. They might eventually run out if you don't loop them. Infinite loop mod switches it on by default, since you can't do that yet in the vanilla game). Spend your metal income. Don't store it, don't waste it, SPEND IT!! :) Storage is necessary only in large games when you want late game build power with loads of fabbers. It is also necessary if you are doing so well that you are wasting so much metal that it is a no brainer. Scouting and radar coverage. Major mistake that a lot of beginners making is committing resources (e.g. a large squad of units) to a doomed endeavour, because they didn't scout) - examples: trying to do an inferno drop with pelicans, failing to scout and realise they have air superiority send and forget a bunch of land units without scouting first with air to check for turrets/mobile units. Doesn't have to be with air, but it will in variably be quicker, especially at the start and on a large planet. Consistency, as OP says, but not just with raids, with everything. You should be checking these things constantly, like every minute:   Your commander (use the hotkey) Idle fabbers (hot key or GUI)  Idle factories (hotkey or GUI)  Camera anchors  Control units  everything else that's going on ;)"

planetaryannihilation,2vz4z8,NCEMTP,3,Sun Feb 15 17:35:01 2015 UTC,I agree to this. Top 10-replays is a great place to steal starting builds.
planetaryannihilation,2vz4z8,JonasMod,5,Sun Feb 15 19:03:27 2015 UTC,"Keyword to search for is ""starting builds"".  During the first 3-4 minutes i usually do this:  Commander: Fac, Mex, Fac, Pgen, Fac, Pgen, Fac, Pgen...  1st fabber: Mex, Mex, Mex...  2nd fabber: Radar, Mex, Mex, Mex...  Then use all factories for building armies, and remember to defend those two fabbers and replace them if they die. After ~6 factories you want some more fabbers, and when you get more fabbers you must get some additional energy."
planetaryannihilation,2vz4z8,JonasMod,2,Sun Feb 15 15:38:53 2015 UTC,"This is a good vanilla build, though I believe the most recent patches favour taking your first fabber and putting them on Pgens.

planetaryannihilation,2vz4z8,Wookovski,3,Wed Feb 18 11:34:08 2015 UTC,have your factories NEVER STOP building units. thats an easy first off. the second one is easy though. you see that metal income? if it's blue build another factory. if it's blue then what metal your gaining is not being used and is simply evaporating into the wind.
planetaryannihilation,2vz4z8,AGmukbooks,1 point,Mon Feb 16 14:55:14 2015 UTC,"Use your commander for factories and power. Your commander can support 2-3 factories on his own without any metal or power. Use your fabbers to gather metal, and eventually power.

Nukes apparently get a single check upon entering atmos, and they don't trigger again.  Easy fix imo: nuke triggers Antinuke, game checks again after 1s (or however long the coded in intercept time is), if nuke is still alive, game attempts to fire another antinuke. Repeat until nuke is dead, explodes, or you run out of antinukes.   Also it feels like antinukes have a REALLY low ""is there a nuke"" poll rate. More than once has a nuke just about embedded itself in the ground before my antinuke noticed it and destroyed it."

That was always a stressful second. The experimental nuke launcher also required 2 anti nukes to destroy each of its missiles, ughh.  I think if the anti-nukes are designed to occasionally miss (should be much less than 10%), then nukes should occasionally be duds. It's only fair.  ...but I don't think that's a decent design idea for them anyway, so I digress."
planetaryannihilation,2vxl4l,NEREVAR117,6,Sun Feb 15 15:00:32 2015 UTC,"Definitely a bug. Me and my cousin like to fight against the AI and, eventually, the anti-nukes will just freak out and stop protecting us. Which really sucks because 80% of the time PA's AI abandons all strategy in late-game and switches to mindless mass nuking.  It really bums me out when the nukes flies right on in, blows up half my base, and I see my anti-nukes spinning in circles in the air. :T"
planetaryannihilation,2vxl4l,NEREVAR117,2,Sun Feb 15 05:09:34 2015 UTC,Late game multiplanet; AI edition: Nuke enemy base repeatedly. Occasionally send a single orbital fabber to build a teleporter. proceed to not activate teleporter before roaming units destroy it. Stack units in base endlessly slowing down the game. (up till last patch) End game by bringing commander to enemy planet in austraus(?!?!)
planetaryannihilation,2vxl4l,NEREVAR117,3,Sun Feb 15 05:58:24 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, that's exactly how every battle goes! Does the AI not know how to respond to late-game interplanetary battles?  For me the AI never builds anti-nukes (or it will only build one or two) despite me sending nukes its way. Even worse, after I discover the AI's base and nuke it once, it'll keep its commander in the exact same location for me to nuke again. Or the AI will build a ton of orbital fighters but keep them all centralized instead of scouting the planet for my invasion. It's weird."
planetaryannihilation,2vxl4l,charles_barkley_bot,3,Sun Feb 15 07:18:15 2015 UTC,"To be fair, on a single planet, the toughest AI would be a very tough fight, but I can't actually blame the devs for the AI not being all that great late game.   Say we talk about inner SOL system, that's what, 7 occupiable planets? Assume you lock down one right off, and the AI are on other ones. That's 6 planets that the AI would need to dynamically respond to attacks to; and if there is one thing computers are terrible at doing themselves, it's being dynamic.   It would be nice if they added in a thing of ""send x avengers when I send a orbital fabber"" and fun things like that. And give them the ability to use unit cannons. Hell, use the nuke targeting code for the cannons, it would work well enough.   I don't so much want the AI to be harder, I want it to be smarter."
planetaryannihilation,2vxl4l,ndm250,3,Sun Feb 15 07:28:13 2015 UTC,"I really respect the work they've put into the AI in this game -- primarily the fact it actually has to see things via scouting to know it's there, and doesn't have magic cheating vision like most (all?) RTS's do. But it still shits on itself late-game. I've played dozens of matches against the AI and only twice did it effectively branch out and hunt me down properly. Those matches were pretty intense and fun.  There's numerous small tweaks that would be relatively easy to implement that would make the AI much more competent, like my previous example of not having all your orbital fighters camping in a single group. There's multiple big problems with that (wasted resources, not protecting your whole planet, single nuke wipes our your orbital defense/offense, etc). There are plenty of examples like this which, if rectified, could really polish up the AI."
planetaryannihilation,2vxl4l,Entropius,1 point,Sun Feb 15 07:40:35 2015 UTC,"True that is, thankfully the devs do seem keen on tweaking the AI every patch, and I guess it was already a bit too difficult at the lower levels, as they made normal and hard easier in the last patch if I recall.   I guess those of us that play the hardest AI are just saps for grueling punishing games. But hey, the better the AI, the closer it gets to players, which means better training for PvP. Kinda."

planetaryannihilation,2vxl4l,engaffirmative,3,Sun Feb 15 06:04:53 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't even mind if that was the case, but you can overlap coverage and since only one anti fires now, overlapping doesn't do anything if so...

Different seeds will still generate planets with roughly the same characteristics.  You can't edit a planet's heightmap right now. That is fully determined by the seed and height range; no way to change it. This also means that you have no direct control over where biomes occur.  What you can edit is a planet's CSG, which is made up of brushes like mountains, valleys, etc.; with a little practice, you can use these to form artificial terrain like bridges, tunnels and canals.  To edit the CSG, metal spots and landing zones on a planet, you first have to put the planet in ""advanced edit mode"" using the dropdown at the bottom left of the system editor panel. You can then use the buttons there to enable or disable specific editing capabilities, which you can control with the keybound functions.  There are some more advanced things you can do, but this should be enough to get you started."

Thank god for double speed I guess.  And then he had the gall to call the last remaining players noobs, when he was the first to be defeated. Because he neglected to keep a couple of dox around his comm to protect against the boombots that he knew were coming. Still, I didn't play so I shouldn't criticise."

The lack of nukes was ridiculous, frankly, as well as the lack of expansion. It was just a raw upload, no editing, nothing. Custom server games are rare so I figured it was worth doing just to put it out there.  As for my gall, the last remainign players were not making good decisions. I'm quite the noob at FFA, i rarely play them, more of a 1v1 guy, but those players were not playing well at the end. Jonuz (pink) destroyed me early on cos we spawned next to each other, he's a good platinum player, we ended up engaging cos there is so little metal on this planet (my design). It forces you to engage early. So that coupled with my failure to defend against a second boom bot rush, which I knew was coming, was my downfall.

As you said in the chat, dynamic alliances would've been a good idea too, allow you to focus your efforts better in the early game. It's also not as though I am particularly skilled or anything, I just watch a lot of casts. If I don't win or lose in 10 minutes, I don't know what to do so I'd probably end up like red.  As for the map... I like the metal layout, but I think that this boring (ie asteroid) geography doesn't help the game. More varied terrain also forces the players to make strategic decisions. Of course, it's harder to balance for so many players that way."

And for protection from other attacks I add in multiple anti-nukes, flack turrets, and a squad of t2 units.  Don't forget that Slammers (the T2 bot that can be fired from the UC) can move & shoot underwater too, so don't put your commander in the middle of an ocean and think he's safe.

As far as I know, and as it looks to me it's aim was to create a repolished Total Annihilation, with a twist on the map being planetary (planetoidy, as the ""planets"" are really just unnaturally round asteroids, so small).  At this, it failed hard. My opinion of course. So what was the actual aim?"
planetaryannihilation,2v8fnc,lepron101,3,Wed Feb 11 09:32:18 2015 UTC,To create an economy based rts which allows you to manage stupid numbers of troops and smash up planets

planetaryannihilation,2v8fnc,Griclav,6,Sun Feb 8 23:56:58 2015 UTC,"If you enjoy RTSs, I would recommend PA because it kinda breaks some of the RTS tropes.  Firstly, micromanagement isn't as big of a thing in PA.  Good micro will help, but macro is waaay more important.  Secondly, on a single planet, the standard turtle is broken.  There are no corners to hide in; and thirdly, some of the end game things you can do are unbelievably epic in proportion.  For the things you asked about: yes the devs do updates pretty quickly, and generally with fixes the community has asked for, and with a really great support system for reporting and fixing bugs.  There are a few problems, like the singleplayer being a bit tedious and the AI not being very good, but it is one of the best, if not the best RTS I have played in a long time, so I would put it on a similar ranking as Civ V is in turn-based, ~9/10.

I played a lot of the original Total Annihilation but knew very little about Planetary Annihilation before I bought it, besides the fact that it was interplanetary and you could crash planets into each other. Overall, while there are a few nitpicks I have about it, I like it quite a lot. Most of the game is very very similar to the original TA.  My only main dislikes are the sizes of the planets (the average size is a little too small for my taste; I miss fighting on a flat surface.), requirement for internet to play (even singleplayer), and the frequent UI crashes (basically the game will stop responding to your input; if you see the screen begin to flicker, press F5 to reload the UI. it doesn't work every time though)."

Wait for optimizations, the AI is very demanding since it is quite good. And then you will be facing gpu bottleneck due to heavy cpu usage(most games dont even use much cpu but with PA thats not the case at all, and thats not a game issue, the game is just not another assasins creed from ubisoft, the calculation are demanding) Bottom line, its out, its working and even if it can be made quicker, the devs will do it fo' so' I myself fashion a 4770 i7 cpu and 970 msi gtx gpu and havent yet seen a slow down.

planetaryannihilation,2v8fnc,killerwife,0,Wed Feb 11 20:39:03 2015 UTC,Beat it how so? 6 cores at 4.5 GHz versus 4 cores at 4.0 GHz seems pretty weighted towards my FX-6300...
planetaryannihilation,2v8fnc,lepron101,2,Wed Feb 11 20:43:42 2015 UTC,"first of all, hyperthreading, that means I have 8 logical cores, and 6 cores stack worse than multiples of 2 usually(unless a very specific programming design), and its a newer generation, which means more operations per minicycle, i.e. one operation out of the 4,5GHz does less than one operation out of the 4,0GHz, this is an alchemy on its own"

planetaryannihilation,2v8fnc,rogersmithbigo,3,Mon Feb 9 21:14:18 2015 UTC,There are no draggable waypoints? Oh god. You would think they grabbed the already working UI and not take away from it but add stuff.

According to Steam I've got about 300hrs of fun out of it so far, so I think that even at the higher price I paid for the beta it's well worth it.  To the OP: if RTS games like Supreme Commander are what you enjoy then this is, IMO, a fantastic example of that genre of game. You could do a lot worse."

planetaryannihilation,2v9c81,UristMasterRace,2,Mon Feb 9 02:50:19 2015 UTC,"Happens to me aswell. I have all drivers up to date. And my system has an i5 4670k, two 770 gtx in SLI and 8gb of ram. No other games ever freezes on me unless it is a common bug, but PA freezes on me every 3-4th game. It seems to depend on the size of the system but some times 4 planets is enough, and it can happen early in game. Often it will freeze when a big player is killed too, but this I think is unrelated.  If this is a bug then I hope uber is working on it cause this has happened to me consistently for a couple months, and a released game shouldnt have such huge bugs."
planetaryannihilation,2v9c81,DeathByDenim,1 point,Mon Feb 9 03:18:19 2015 UTC,"PA doesn't work well with SLI. I'm surprised PA is running for you in that way actually. I am not entirely sure what the cause is, but I think I heard that is seems to be in the NVidia drivers (source). Also PA uses OpenGL instead of DirectX, which is what most Windows games use, which could explain why it only seems to happen in PA.  Another possibility is that you are simply running out of memory. PA can be quite a memory hog. Especially when you have large systems. Four planets for example can be quite large if the planets themselves are also large. I upgraded from 8GB for that exact reason (though I went a bit overboard to 24GB, oh well). When you say freeze, your whole computer freezes? Or just PA?"
planetaryannihilation,2v9c81,davedontmind,1 point,Mon Feb 9 18:32:35 2015 UTC,"PA freezes, then a small window comes up saying PA doesnt answer, and the option to close the program. My computer never freezes due to this, but there was a period where my computer would blue screen due to PA. I found that was due to a nvidia driver issue that I resolved by going back to a driver that I knew worked. Now I use the newest drivers tho, and there are no blue screens. My ram may not be enough but I can play on systems with 10 huge metal planets with no crash, it only takes a long time to load in all those polygons and a lot of stuttering in the first few minutes. So I know RAM isnt the biggest issue here. I can try turn of SLI, but i didnt buy two gtx 770 to run only 1 :/ Hope they fix this, graphics cards are expensive and my hardware shouldnt be the issue. I'll consider upgrading my RAM tho."

planetaryannihilation,2v203d,UristMasterRace,5,Sat Feb 7 02:57:57 2015 UTC,"Bots are great for early game, they're fast and cheap- excelent at raiding, or attacking expanding fabbers. Vehicles, while slower, are great and powerful. Bolo rushes are deadly, and groups of infernos can take out large chunks of bases (and commanders)"
planetaryannihilation,2v203d,The_DestroyerKSP,3,Sat Feb 7 03:03:43 2015 UTC,Mobile artillery units are also GREAT for early-mid turtles.
planetaryannihilation,2v203d,Lurking4Answers,7,Sat Feb 7 03:56:23 2015 UTC,"T1  Bots are cheap as all hell. Bot fabbers are the cheapest fabber with the same efficiency as vehicle fabbers, and combat bots are insane early game. Bots also have the combat fabber which is unique to their category, which is insane in prolonged planet sieges and base sieges. Not to mention that Doxes can shoot everything, and grenadiers are getting buffed to the heavens. Only real disadvantages is the lack of a really fast scouting unit and no anti-air (doxes are horrid in an AA role btw).  Vehicles are much much more expensive, but much tankier, have a close up unit for both tiers (inferno,vanguard), and have the spinner.  Bots are absolutely dominant in open engagements, and vehicles are dominant in engagements with choke points (lava planets are infamous for choke points) and against dug in enemies (infernos quite literally melt walls and eat turret rounds for breakfast) and so forth.  T2  Bots fill a utility/specialist role, with slammers filling a rapid deployment/assault role (basically dox 2.0), gil-es functioning as a long range fire support, advanced combat fabbers being super-medics, and bluehawks filling a mobile artillery role. An army of t2 bots is really versatile, minus the no anti-air.   Vehicles on the otherhand have a very specific role in T2, Siege units. Shellers being mobile artillery, vanguards being bullet sponges (run them with T2 combat fabbers and they will never die) and levellers being capable of being very versatile, dealing enough damage to one-shot all T1 units in the game. Run an army of all 3 with some spinners and either t1 or t2 combat fabbers and youll be taking bases with ease."
planetaryannihilation,2v203d,Raymanic,3,Sat Feb 7 09:28:52 2015 UTC,"Your first factory should be bot. 3 fabbers then spam dox. This lets you harass early on and keep them on their toes. Later, you can get either another bot factory or start on vehicles, because they have much more meat on their bones and damage output. I recommend at least a bot factory in a game for Combat Fabricators. They increase survivability extremely well and can now build walls (note: they can be used in water, so you can make an unkillable Orca or Leviathan.). T2 bots are also nice because Slammers have torpedo launchers and Bluehawks have tactical missiles, which can now hit orbital.  TL;DR: Bot -> Vehicle -> T2 Bot -> T2 Vehicle is a nice strategy.  If you want more help/training, add me on Steam. I'm in a clan called Angels' Court (AC) which is dedicated to teaching people how to play."
planetaryannihilation,2v203d,MarkusGordathian,2,Mon Feb 9 05:12:53 2015 UTC,"I'd say something here, but it's pretty well covered. Basically you can make a lot of doxes very quickly :3"
planetaryannihilation,2v203d,QuantumVexation,2,Sat Feb 7 13:35:51 2015 UTC,To play doxs in 1v1 you have to rush them out faster than you can think as well as keep sets constantly raiding. Watch the first round of the final of the clopsey 2v2 to see a good tanks v dox battle (on my phone so can't link but look for zaphods channel sure it's on there). There has been a balance update since but nothing that would majorly effect the argument.
planetaryannihilation,2v203d,NotATurtle27,2,Sun Feb 8 17:55:20 2015 UTC,"Vehicles are great in small squads but bots are best en masse.  e.g. Vanguards and Shellers are great in small squads and can disrupt multiple units at once but in numbers it lacks the killing potential of bots. But swarms of Doxes, Slammers and Gil-E's can mess up armies smaller than it irrespective of how powerful it is but in fewer numbers the vehicles have less trouble taking them out"
planetaryannihilation,2v203d,Spearka,2,Mon Feb 9 13:43:21 2015 UTC,"Check out the stats.  e.g: Dox Bolo  The Dox has less health, but moves faster and requires less metal to build (and so gets built quicker).  The Bolo is slower to build, and slower to move, but does more damage and has more health.   In my opinion the Bolo is a much better unit on the whole - not only does it do more damager but you get 1.6 health per metal spent on it, vs the 0.8 of the dox - twice as much health for your metal! But the faster speed of the Dox makes it better for early game raiding."
planetaryannihilation,2v2z7r,Wookovski,3,Sat Feb 7 11:05:21 2015 UTC,It's would be an interesting stat. I usually notice the difference on the lava planet because of the mirrored effect changes which side the cluster of 4 mex are.

It takes a while to get used to, but it's worth it.  While in non-locked mode you can press 'n' (I don't think I've rebound it...) to ""straighten up"" the planet, so you have north side up. It's useful if you talk to people on voip, bc you can say ""attack coming in from the south""."
planetaryannihilation,2v2z7r,sound-of-words,1 point,Sat Feb 7 12:54:22 2015 UTC,You can just rotate the map so the enemy is always south of you. I have standard angles I always switch to on every map. usually so that my opponent is to the right/left. Sidescrolling feels more natural to me I guess.
planetaryannihilation,2v1yve,the_Demongod,2,Sat Feb 7 02:45:19 2015 UTC,"Narwhals and Torpedo launchers are their only counters, as narwhals are the only units able to hit subs (at the same time subs are super super weak and can get easily get killed when found). Basically the naval meta atm is narwhal/barracuda spam (orcas are too expensive and were nerfed way too much, and by the time you have a sizeable orca fleet the enemy had leviathans which can fight orcas at a 5 to 1 ratio.  Bombers wreck hard once they're detected as well."

I don't like the idea of having LoL/Dota/HoN gameplay in PA where people jump in and out of LoS all the time.

planetaryannihilation,2ux22t,Chocrates,1 point,Thu Feb 5 22:33:34 2015 UTC,This would be a lot cooler if you put a screenshot behind it so we can see where things are.
planetaryannihilation,2ux22t,The_Infinite_Monkey,3,Thu Feb 5 23:07:24 2015 UTC,Thats the issue...  The mouse is focused on the center of the screen because you are moving focus to the center of the screen. I doubt not using hotkeys is going to change anything.
planetaryannihilation,2ux22t,machello,1 point,Fri Feb 6 00:03:06 2015 UTC,"Im thinking that if I use wasd for the camera (im currently using MMB) then the mouse movements shouldn't be as focused on the center of the screen, so you could get a much better idea of where the mouse is going."
planetaryannihilation,2ux22t,Guest___,1 point,Fri Feb 6 16:15:35 2015 UTC,One screenshot would not do the trick... It would be pretty much meaningless to show where the focus was at one point while showing where the mouse was throughout the match.

Is it possible to custom paint/erase terrain? Is that in keybindings as well? Also where is that menu found? I only seem to have metal spot edit mode (which doesn't turn them blue or let me move any).   Would it be possible to say, make a map with bare deserts, a water ring around the middle, or a mountain barrier? Start with a seeded map and delete any features or erase any terrain there may already be? If you lower the seed number, would that just make a bare-er planet?  Sorry I know that's alot, but I'm really enjoying this game and just started playing with my roommate. Would love to figure out how to custom mod planets for terrain.

Another nice one is F, which select all of the idle fabbers.  Oh, and control groups. Press Ctrl+<num> to group units. Pressing <num> select all those units. Pressing <num> twice will focus the camera on them as well. <num> ranges from 0 to 9.  There are actually a whole bunch under Settings -> Keyboard and I mean loads! :)"

planetaryannihilation,2ul25a,davedontmind,1 point,Tue Feb 3 04:15:22 2015 UTC,"Don't forget you can change the keys around to best suit your needs. Browse the hotkey settings (see also my comment on hotbuild2 elsewhere in this thread)  see what commands are available, and assign them to keys you can remember and/or reach easily.  I've moved idle fabbers to F1, because I use 'F' for its mnemonic value for other things, and because I find F1 easy to hit quickly.  Another good keybind to setup is the one that toggles factories between one-off and infinite builds (I like it on the key above TAB) because you'll often find yourself switching to infinite build mode, and a single keypress is much easier than the clicking you have to do otherwise.  Other useful keys are the camera bookmarks.  Use shift-number to remember the current camera position, and alt-number to recall it. Set bookmarks at important locations (e.g. your base, your teammate's base, your enemy's base...) so you can get there quickly."

planetaryannihilation,2uljtr,DoxBox,7,Wed Feb 4 00:37:12 2015 UTC,"Dox hate walls, their pathetic attack damage even as a group makes them extremely vulnerable if they hit a wall and need to blow down the wall. AOE explosives (Leviathan, Holkins etc) can kill multiples of them in seconds, a single inferno allowed to get in firing range without taking damage will kill an entire army of them, and vanguards when you hit t2 automatically put dents in armies, hell even the inbuilt alt-fire weapon on the commander can end a dox rush. Also if the dox are getting micro'd to the point where they are dodging bullets and kiting enemies then thats time the enemy comm isnt paying attention to the rest of the game aka the perfect time to bomber snipe/laser platform snipe/inferno hotdrop. Scouting often like a good player will make you aware to their movements. Also remember that even though dox can hit air units, are units are fast and can dodge dox bullets, so 10 or so bumblebees sitting in base to deal with dox (which you should build if your scouting properly enough that they are dox spamming). Dox rushing ruins early economy as well seeing the enemy team would dedicated all their mex to spamming dox in their 5 or so factories, so that gives you the opportunity to fend off a few attacks, get t2 before them, then rush them with vanguards, shellers, kestrals, slammers and gil-es."
planetaryannihilation,2uljtr,Raymanic,2,Tue Feb 3 08:15:48 2015 UTC,"Not sure your RTS background, but Dox are like Marines + Zerglings from Starcraft. Literally these units can run around and be annoying in small numbers. In masses they will blow through walls and if someone is dedicated to harassing basses they can build long ranged cannons to break down walls while the Dox give vision and then eventually storm in. Also its not about winning with the Dox, but getting far enough ahead that you can expand or tech up. Dox are very fragile and cheap, but they are too versatile. I can move them around to scout and attack. Cannons + Dox = You win (in my experience)."
planetaryannihilation,2uljtr,vincentgray16,2,Sat Feb 7 06:19:43 2015 UTC,"PA could use proper unit counters. For example, there could be a vehicle with about Bolo range dealing little damage in a decent AOE. This would counter Dox spam but with properly tweaked stats be weak against Bolos and most other units. That's just one way to do it."
planetaryannihilation,2uljtr,protissniper0,2,Tue Feb 3 15:15:05 2015 UTC,well... one teir two turret can destroy about 50 doxes out of a hundred a teir three turret will essentially destroy the entire dox army if it is surounded by a small box wall

Different tutorials also exists on youtube, I think.  Also, if you are playing 1v1s: I usually choose between 1, 2 or 3 fabbers in the beginning, not between 3 or 7. (this is something the top players do as well)"
planetaryannihilation,2uerwv,JonasMod,4,Sun Feb 1 15:07:21 2015 UTC,"you definately need a decent starting build, then you will produce stuff more efficiently. A common start from old balance was:  Commander builds: 1 factory, 1 metal extractor, 1 factory, 3 power generator, Spam factories  1st factory builds 3 fabbers, first 2 go expanding on metal extractors, 1 stays behind on power generators.   This build still works in the new balance although it is possible to do other starts now and everyone is still experimenting with the slightlier more forgiving economy. This start though is very simple and should get you plenty of units out quickly"

planetaryannihilation,2uerwv,davedontmind,1 point,Sun Feb 1 18:35:24 2015 UTC,"If you hold down the Shift key when you give an order, it gets added to the unit's list of orders.  e.g. select unit, right click somewhere, shift right click somewhere else and the unit will move to the first point then move to the second. Select your commander, tell him to build one factory, then hold down shift and tell him to build another, keep shift held and tell him to build a row of power generators and he will build the 2nd factory after he's finished the first, then move on to build all the pgens.   You can queue up as many orders as you like (although it can be a little frustrating if you create a large sequence and right near the end forget to hold down shift for one of the steps...)  You can also use this feature to give a sequence of orders to a factory, which are then inherited by all units that the factory builds. e.g. give a factory a sequence of move orders followed by a patrol order (keeping shift held down all the time) and each unit that emerges will follow the waypoint path and end up patrolling."

planetaryannihilation,2ufryr,otterfamily,1 point,Wed Feb 4 13:49:53 2015 UTC,Targetting is hugely finnicky. It seems to be targeting whatever planet is closest to your cursor when you click and it's concept of what object is closest seems wonky. For example you can have the cursor on top of a moon and it will still select the planet or vica versa. I can't remember if targeting is exactly the same as with Haley's. If it is the planets are represented by a blue circle with a dot inside and will display as a solid blue circle when targeted.

I mean, it's only 4 months after official release, and I'm not sure what else people are expecting from them. They've delivered at this point.

I blame the gaming community for their insatiable crack-addict like appetite to have new and fun things and to have them now without any regard for what goes into game development, and I blame Uber for not properly planning their pace of development and not taking into account the behavior of the gaming community.

But Uber didn't listen at all. They'd been very, very silent to the community for weeks and months leading up to ""release"". Almost everyone was totally fine with them taking more time actually finish the game. No one was screaming for them to release - except the management at Uber.   Besides, ultimately, the game has become what they have promised and what the Kickstarter video showed; just not as soon as the community would have liked.   Uhhhh, something tells me you weren't around this sub, or the forums, before the game was ""released"". We certainly weren't screaming for them to get it out the door already. I'd actually be happy with the development of PA if this was still the alpha/beta stage. It was Uber that kicked it out the door by having their ""release"" for an unfinished game, causing the media to pan the game in reviews, causing sales to plummet and the online community to fall apart. Everyone on the forums were crying for them NOT to release. Uber dun fucked up bad, don't put that on the community.

Anyway, Uber always had in mind that updates are updates and game will be updated for a long time, and release is just one step in game development, not the end. For me the game was great and it is even better now, and will be even better in the future. Probably many people expected PA to be more singleplayer oriented and were dissapointed that most fun and stuff is in multiplayer, because thats how the game was made.

The media will review the game in that state and make their judgments. To call it released and then go ""hey, how fine the community isn't waiting for us to finish"" shows a naivete about how the entire process works.

This can be really tough for some people because until you get how the economy works, a lot of people just perform really badly and then blame the game, when it's their meta that needs work.  Another problem would be people coming from TA or SupCom, where turtling and tech was the general solution to most battles. PA is a lot more about expansion and agression (just inherently based on the balance and the aims of the developers).  PA is currently a really well fleshed out game, but I think a lot of people have bad expectations, or don't see failure as an opportunity to learn, so they just keep trying to play the game they liked with TA and SupCom despite the fact that PA has a different meta."

planetaryannihilation,2u7j5w,Gunshinn,2,Sat Jan 31 12:42:15 2015 UTC,Release was definitely not 'solid'. The game was missing so many features and dont even talk to me about the lack of unit balance.

Games tend to average about 20 minutes, so it's not that hard to do without it.  Beyond that, if you like RTS games (specifically Total Annihilation), you'll probably enjoy this.

The game is quite a memory hog though; 8GB is required if you want to play offline, but in your case that shouldn't be needed. AI is pretty good, especially in skirmishes. The lack of build options available in Galactic War can sometimes lead to odd behavior, but it's getting rarer. AI is pretty tough to players who don't know what they're doing. Difficulty setting aside, you can make it easier for yourself by setting the AI's economy multiplier lower in the skirmish setup. That slows down their expansion and unit production."

planetaryannihilation,2u7j5w,Xanoxis,-3,Sat Jan 31 01:37:09 2015 UTC,"Personally? No. I was an early access buyer and was following since the initial kickstarter.  Due to its nature Planetary Annihilation is not a very good RTS. This is probably mostly due to the fact that there is no traditional map, or ""levels"" to the game environment. Instead the spherical procedurally generated planets combined with sadly barebones orbital gameplay means that you can't really basebuild like you could in Total Annihilation or Supreme Commander, the games often seen as PA's predecessors. Let alone setup battlelines and push with intelligent planning.  That doesn't mean that PA can't be fun to the right kind of person. But in a strange way PA almost performs more like a MOBA style game than an RTS. It's all very frenetic and based in aggressive expansion. Not in strategic buildup and tactical formations of units. Instead you just spam all the buildings, all the units, and pick more than one vector of attack to win. Plus assaulting a planet with traditional forces is really grindy and not fun at all. Things like the teleporter were made OP to try and compensate for that.  It's all simple but frenetic macro all of the time in a bad way. You need strategy for a Real Time Strategy and sadly PA lacks a lot of that for the average RTS player. But the developers are still trying to evolve the gameplay at least. And there are some half-decent mods out there.  But that's just my opinion. Your mileage may vary but it was one of my worst purchase decisions.  P.s. I recommend Grey Goo though and Homeworld Remastered is coming out in a few weeks. Save your money and get that instead! =D"

Bitch about the 1.0 release being tooearly or the RAM hungry UI but goddamn... people just want more of the same it seems"
planetaryannihilation,2u7j5w,NCEMTP,0,Sat Jan 31 01:51:21 2015 UTC,"Hey I bought the game before it was finished. I took the risk and I knew there was a chance the design would not work out, at least for me. I'm not asking for a refund or anything. That doesn't mean I am not entitled to my own opinion, nor sharing it with others so they can judge if they want to purchase it or not.  There are many RTS players, veterans, who don't like the way Planetary Annihilation plays even with the patches since launch. I love me some classic C&C, CoH or TA. Not to mention some weirder RTS titles like Perimeter. But Planetary Annihilation just isn't very fun for me because of the reasons I just stated.  Fuck me for having an opinion right?  Uber already got well above the RRP from me during the beta. I'm not going to lie to myself and others just to justify that purchase. If you enjoy it then GREAT! But not everyone who bought it does."
planetaryannihilation,2u7j5w,NCEMTP,2,Sat Jan 31 02:00:56 2015 UTC,"I mean, when you refer to ""spam"" what do you mean? Isn't that true in TA and SupCom? Don't you want the most amounts of units possible?"
planetaryannihilation,2u7j5w,Avestier,0,Sat Jan 31 02:10:22 2015 UTC,"Not the same. In FAF in particular there is a great deal of unit variety. Multiple tech tiers and multiple epic units too. Along with up to four factions. This makes it far more in-depth when it comes to rock/paper/scissor type unit selection. In addition due to the 2D and carefully designed nature of the map it is very important in past TA-style games to build up base defences and create chokepoints etc.  By comparison in PA there really are no chokepoints, no purpose to careful basebuilding especially on maps with multiple planets. And worst of all, everyone just ends up spamming the same unit groups and it's more about who can macro their eco/production first, as opposed to actually thinking strategically about what they are building and where they are sending units.  Some mods being developed are helping to change that, but fact is the vanilla game in PA does not have the same amount of strategy as its predecessors do. Many fans of SupCom are just continuing to play FAF or even Zero-K, which is FREE, and don't fucking bother with PA.  PA isn't necessarily a bad game, I just think its design was overambitious and comparing it to TA/SupCom gives people the wrong idea. It's more about pure and fast macroing, without any focus on micro and no real deep strategy in most matches."

(maybe 3v3 4v4 5v5) To make a workaround for small playerbase you could use a global chat and a ladder challenge mode like on old ladders for other games. You find opponents in chat then challenge their team on the ladder. Maybe pick the playersize in the challenge.

The other way you would do this would be with a teleporter. In the last update these where made a lot more expensive. If you know that planet is uninhabited, and you aren't making a full scale invasion and sending a tone of units. Just to show you the numbers, an Astraeus costs 400 metal, outside of the factory. The orbital fabber cost 1600 metal and the you have to build the teleporter which costs 800."

planetaryannihilation,2u2q7b,philoscience,1 point,Fri Jan 30 01:07:54 2015 UTC,Step number 1 is getting 2-3 air factories pouring out bombers. Step 2 is getting some basic groups of avengers spread around the planet to stop any orbital fabbers. Step 3 is total planet coverage by umbrellas. Step 4 antinukes.
planetaryannihilation,2u2q7b,DeathByDenim,1 point,Thu Jan 29 15:55:50 2015 UTC,Don't forget the antinukes or you'll be sorry. :)
planetaryannihilation,2u2q7b,philoscience,1 point,Thu Jan 29 16:23:01 2015 UTC,Actually I find it depends on the size of the planet. I favor an aggressive playstyle so generally on any controlled planet I would spread out my resources generation all over the planet. That way even a coordinated nuke strike is only a threat if it hits my com. So yeah antinuke wherever my com is but not all over :)
planetaryannihilation,2u2q7b,DrMonsi,1 point,Thu Jan 29 16:24:44 2015 UTC,"what i sometimes do is load my comm up on a hornet and let it patrol all over the planet. this way, if there are not like 100 nukes at once incoming, it's almost impossible to get him. of course the planet has to be fully covered for this to work, but this way you got your comm more or less safe from being nuked or hit by unit cannons. from times to times your enemy may get a lucky hit and you die, but in my eyes it's still safer than let the comm stay on the same place and may be seen be some random undetected radar satellites, especially if you haven't got the ressources (yet) to build a whole lot of defensive stuff around him."
planetaryannihilation,2u3w14,Vasilcin,6,Thu Jan 29 18:43:58 2015 UTC,"This has been fixed, but the change won't go out until the next build (not the build that went out today).  Thanks for the feedback."

Right now the game just overrules landing zone placement completely and makes up its own landing zones.  Can this be pushed out faster?  Not having this is what currently prevents me from playing the game. I am not interested in multiplayer ladders (only the occasional lan play at home with close friends).  I only care about single player campaigns and large complex scenario's. Right now I can't do this. (the randomly generated ""campaign"" existing right now is not a worthy single player experience.)"

planetaryannihilation,2u1yh8,JonasMod,1 point,Thu Jan 29 08:39:40 2015 UTC,I find it really depends on your intelegence on the planet. Try and find something they don't have defences for. A good strat is: adv radar to check for umbrellas then unit cannon just out of range.

I also recommend advancing your front line offence AND defence closer towards their own, allowing for rapid attacks.  Adding more bots doesn't always make the game harder (assuming they are all on separate teams) so give it a go sometime!  Also keep in mind to try out playing against an AI on a single planet system AND a multi-planet system since the AI greatly changes its play-style for both situations."

planetaryannihilation,2tqfvu,sesstreets,3,Mon Jan 26 20:42:19 2015 UTC,Same here. I dislike the lack of experimental units like even the krogoth or the huge artillery gun from supcom. This game feels like it's trying to make ta into a lol experience.

planetaryannihilation,2tqfvu,beefzilla,2,Mon Jan 26 22:15:40 2015 UTC,"I miss Big Berthas too. You gotta think, why aren't they in this game? I suspect it's because you can just nuke stuff from across the planet, so why need Berthas? Because the big guns are cheaper to operate, and you can't stop them with anti-nukes. You have to build behind some large geological structure to protect that portion of your base. Problem with PA is that there really isn't much in the way of ravines, basins, valleys to build inside, and not too many mountains to hide behind.   I'd still love to see greater variety in terrain. That would make PA feel more like TA. Otherwise I look at a map and just see choke points like in StarCraft."

planetaryannihilation,2tqfvu,jablestown,1 point,Mon Jan 26 21:06:40 2015 UTC,"It doesn't look like it'd be very easy to use, but SupCom does have a map editor.   It could probably be modded in, but the 'planet' maps are pretty integral to PA. It takes some getting used to, but they've really grown on me. You could (by the way) just make a large planet with lava or something on one hemisphere. That way, you could still keep the whole arena in sight.  (also, you can set PiP to mirror mode, which keeps it pointed at the side of the planet opposite the main view. Might help)"
planetaryannihilation,2tqfvu,Tenocticatl,2,Mon Jan 26 21:43:58 2015 UTC,"SupCom map editor was never meant to be released, so never was polished at all. We just released it for fun after we shipped. PA one should be much more user friendly."

planetaryannihilation,2tqfvu,Tenocticatl,2,Tue Jan 27 11:48:29 2015 UTC,"Official flat maps are a probably not. Game was designed around planets, and would require major changes to make them to a quality we could officially release."

planetaryannihilation,2tqfvu,Wookovski,1 point,Mon Jan 26 21:47:33 2015 UTC,"Same here. I know it goes against the whole design, but I just find it a bit annoying and unsatisfying to have to manage this gigantic 3D frontier. Then again, I only play comp-stomps alone or with a friend."
planetaryannihilation,2tqfvu,AGmukbooks,1 point,Tue Jan 27 06:15:53 2015 UTC,I remember hearing somewhere that the ability for flat maps is in the game (just not easily accessible).

planetaryannihilation,2tu6ug,BlondishMist748,6,Tue Jan 27 13:36:15 2015 UTC,"Fan out across the few not occupied territories first to pick up the free techs. Then pick single planet systems to start fighting on, don't got multiple planet systems as you will lack the advanced tech that these games evolve into.  Then you need to focus on quick t1 base invasions that are similar to 1vs1. style of play. Balance is fair, it's meant to be a challenge, you just need to adapt style of play."
planetaryannihilation,2tu6ug,DavidQuestioned,1 point,Tue Jan 27 13:55:09 2015 UTC,"I do go to every system where there is no enemy. But I still have only three slots (logic) and I got no addtional slots. So what I got was complete bot tech, the 300% storage upgrade and an upgrade for my commander to move faster and have more health.   I picked a system with one gas giant (which you cannot fight on) and one small planet. So it was one planet 1v1.   I started by building a factory and few building bots. I have build energy plants and metal extractors in the closes area.  Next up I have build several factories, each building a different type of unit, on loop. Efficinecy was 100%. But I was not able to build advanced because of the lack of metal.  So I have started two outposts, ussualy three metal extractors, walls around them and defense against the enemy.  At that point I was able to build my advanced factory.  Problem was the enemy has everything, he had land tanks and bombers, so he, zerg style, bombed my entire army, and bots die very quickly.   Thankfully my defenses were enough to destryo some of his bombers and he retreated. So I started bulding my army, again.  But that was too late. I was unable to aquire more metal extractors, thefore I was limited to one advanced factory. And the production is very slow, plus five normal factories running.   It ended with him doing it again ,this time he had ten times the amount of bomber and just bombed the shit out of me.  This is not a strategic challange, this is dumb throw everything you got at the enemy."
planetaryannihilation,2tu6ug,the_unfinished_I,6,Tue Jan 27 14:03:03 2015 UTC,"I was going to say that sometimes the technologies you get are a bit of a dice roll, but you should've been able to win that match with those technologies. It's meant to be a challenge."
planetaryannihilation,2tu6ug,TheGreatFez,-1,Tue Jan 27 14:21:22 2015 UTC,"Challange and a middle borderline cheating AI is a difference. I am gonna try to lower the difficulty, but at that point AI is no challange at all."
planetaryannihilation,2tu6ug,TheGreatFez,3,Tue Jan 27 16:38:17 2015 UTC,"First off what level are you playing these GW's on?   Second, from what you are telling me, you need to change your strategy. The reason he is beating you is mainly because you have built an advanced factory. In a 1 v 1 planet, its all about the zerg rush, if you are not harrassing the enemy and stopping their expansions, they will overpower you regardless of your technology level.  Try this again but do this instead: Have your commander insta build 2 factories, 2 powerplants, 2 factories and then power plants. Your first factory needs to build some fabbers (I prefer 5 but some people opt for 3) And send them to get metal extractors (your commander should never get metal extractors, too much moving which is not efficient). Second I build 3 scouts, and then loop doxes, grenadiers and combat repair bots. I prefer a 4:2:1 ratio. As soon as the scouts are out send them to patrol the entire planet. Continue expanding metal extractors and have all your factories building the que of your prefference. When you find the commander HARRASS the crap out of them, take whatever you have and go attack their metal extractors. After a short while you should have a decent army to wipe them out.  An advanced factory takes a LOT of resources and is meant to be for a longer game. The time you spent trying to build up enough resources to sustain the Advanced factory production, they would have built an army way stronger than any of your defenses/army.  I have yet to lose with this strategy in 1 v 1 on a single planet. You have to build fast though so it might take some practice."
planetaryannihilation,2tu6ug,thetinguy,0,Tue Jan 27 17:11:36 2015 UTC,"This is not as much of a strategy as mindlessly throw shit at the enemy.  I have won with the same strategy in a skirmish 1v1. I don't remember the exact number, but I absolutely destroyed the AI. He didn't even touch me. I had take over nearly the whole planet and he was unable to hurt me anywhere where it hurt.   The way I did that match for example is following. The start is the same. I never use the commander to build metal extractors unless they are right next to the spawn point. I get my basic base going, I build some defenses. And I throw some really weak bots at the enemy. As I have air units I scout with them and keep updates on what the AI is doing.  I build an army strong enough of defense. And keep poping them on loop from several factories. I really like ordinary land units. After I get my economy strong enough I pop down an advanced factory. I build my ""elite"" squad of really tough and powerful units. And continuesly I expand with advanced bulders. While still attacking the enemy with weak units. Building a radar is obvious.  Next step is base 2 and 3. This is my strategy from SupCom (this was the only way to defeat the most difficult AI there, at least for me).   I make two squads of few attack units and two builders. Send each of them to a certain point on the map.   And in no time I surround my enemy with walls. Therefore I stop his expansion to other bases. He cannot move and I can slowly take him down.  The problem in GW is that I don't have the tech necessary. Or I have ONLY the advanced factory for Air and it is impossible to use it.   The GW I describe in the post I played on Hard."
planetaryannihilation,2tu6ug,thetinguy,2,Tue Jan 27 17:26:04 2015 UTC,"Well I mean it is a strategy. A simple one. But a strategy none the less. This can really shine though if you are really good at micromanaging battles and maneuvering your units to weakspots.   Yeah hard is a bit tricky, it can be frustrating. But thats the thing about GW. It isnt meant for you to go and just fight a random battle over and over again, you have to make strategic decisions on what tech you want and how you want to play the game. You could be super unlucky and have to change the way you normally play because you dont have the tech and got only like 3x storage and commander upgrades, or you could be super lucky and get exactly what you need.  At the same time though, I am sure they are still doing a lot of balance changes so it could be that the bots are too weak compared to air and land. But thats a different discussion.  It is my personal preference but I never try to go advanced Factories in a 1 v 1 on one planet. It just isnt fast enough, I feel like you can build 4 more T1 factories and pump out units faster than by taking the resources and time to build just one advanced factory. I guarantee that in that time, the enemy would have produced a large army like you stated. ALTHOUGH the bombers coming in and wiping everything out was probably really terrible to deal with.   I dont particularly like that this works for me, but its the fastest way to beat the simple 1 v 1/singleplanets. I think the real strategy shines in the multiplanet and multi commander fights"
planetaryannihilation,2tu6ug,thetinguy,3,Tue Jan 27 17:52:01 2015 UTC,"You keep saying it's not strategy, and you are wrong. Just because you lost does not mean there is no strategy."

In SC2 some pros use just a few units early to gain an economic advantage. I think you're looking for 'late game' action, which is harder in GW until you get more tech. Try AI skirmish instead if you don't want to be limited in tech. Also, u get more 'free' tech in larger GW sizes. Try uber, last time i got 5 full slots before i had to face an enemy"
planetaryannihilation,2tu6ug,mrob507,0,Thu Jan 29 23:15:20 2015 UTC,"If I throw units mindlessly on the enemy, constantly, I win. No problem.

I have gave up on GW, so I am gonna stick to skirmish matches, maybe some multiplayer if it will work properly, it crashes quite often."
planetaryannihilation,2tu6ug,jg1rock,2,Thu Jan 29 23:49:10 2015 UTC,"Hmm, well that may work for AI (i hear its still being tweaked so maybe soon it will match or counter that simple strat), but it definitely wont work on a smart opponent! the value you can achieve by sneakily killing off fabbers or energy plants with a few dox is a great way to gain an early advantage."

I have a problem with the bullshit Galactic War is and it's mechanic of giving you tech.  In a skirmish battle I beat the crap out of the hard AI.   I know an unfinished AI when I see one. Uber is wiping their ass with our money, releasing an unfinished game that already was in early access unfinished has no excuse and they should be ashamed, but they are not.

Battleships aren't troop/vehicle transports."

planetaryannihilation,2tm7p9,Hazzman,2,Sun Jan 25 20:33:00 2015 UTC,"Okay fair point.  Then the point of a battleship IRL is    a giant platform covered in big guns   that can defend the troop/vehicle transports.  Look, it's something along those lines.  You send in the battleships to kill off all the other ships so you can send in your ground troops."
planetaryannihilation,2tm7p9,NCEMTP,3,Sun Jan 25 22:57:44 2015 UTC,"There aren't even any battleships in service anymore. The USN basically demonstrated that battleships were outdated technology back in the 1940s when we ruled the Pacific against Japan with carrier-based aircraft and submarines, while the Japanese had a heavier focus on battleships...  The role you describe is played by missile cruisers and submarines today, which support aircraft carriers and troop transports...but really just carriers.  It is further postulated that today's carrier navy will be shown to be outdated come the next major conflict. Antiship missiles are a lot cheaper than ships, and with air power being what it is...it's hard to say what will happen on the seas. Of course shipping by sea is still far far more efficient than air...but thankfully in the game we don't have to deal with logistics, really.  The trick to navies being useful isn't rivers, it's planets that are primarily water, or with better lake/ocean generations. I've seen a few pro replays on almost fully ocean maps. They exist, and navies work there.  Naval transports? You have air transports. Support them with ships.  But my planes will get shot down! Okay, use a unit cannon, or drop them in with orbital transports.  Or teleporters, which would be great if they worked with naval units.  As it stands there's no real purpose for naval transports.  You just haven't seen enough good random planets with good water distribution. They're out there, but I'd agree that the map generator needs work to make it so that there are more effectively oceans vs isolated lakes."
planetaryannihilation,2tm7p9,maddata,1 point,Mon Jan 26 08:46:13 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer.  Battleships have been mostly irrelevant since the battle of midway.   Antiship missiles are a lot cheaper than ships   I think that's why the navy has a lot of r&d into vulcan guns that can dismantle missiles in flight and laser weapons which can detonate them.   You just haven't seen enough good random planets with good water distribution.   I agree, I saw a match a while back with an all water planet where I think the players agreed to use only naval, it was a fun match to watch."

planetaryannihilation,2tm7p9,Lurking4Answers,1 point,Tue Jan 27 04:07:34 2015 UTC,"I believe currently the game is set up to force the divide between naval/land. Like apples and oranges it makes for more dynamic play when you have to take into account the planet's biomes and land masses (if the water is <30% then you probably shouldn't go naval purely for economic reasons.). Currently, focussing land denies you water metal and naval the opposite. A good naval or land fleet will trump any air other then bomber snipes.  It is up to the player to decide what they value more, and which strategy will pay off, remembering that naval controls the coast due to its range, but land units are faster and cheaper."

If they turtle themselves in you should have a massive economy advantage, just send 4 nukes their way, or a rain of Stompers that even Umbrellas won't stop. The turrets won't be able to shoot through the buildings and you'll be able to destroy the infrastructure and, for example, destroy the anti-nuke and nuke him.  Another way is to fly tons of avengers above his commander with just a couple laser platforms among them just seconds after. You should have plenty of time to kill the commander since he can't pick it up in a Peregrine and fly to the other side of the planet.  Yes, those tactics take some time, but that's just how it goes.

EDIT the ""unit cannon"" in my picture is in fact a catalyst, something totally different. The unit cannon would be in the upper left of a t2 unit. not sure why it's not here. I'm guessing OP's using an out-of-date version from before it was added.  I didnt want to go into too much detail, but the unit cannon can also build fabbers. A common strategy is to use unit cannons to establish a beach head with a couple fabbers, some AA tanks, and some slammers. The aa tanks guard from air while the slammers clear the area. The fabbers build a tele, and you send your main force through the tele.  Also, check out the guides up on exodus esport's page for more advice on your play."

planetaryannihilation,2t8hlm,ToastedSoup,2,Thu Jan 22 17:48:12 2015 UTC,"Ooh, thanks jables! I do love me some submarines!"
planetaryannihilation,2t8hlm,ToastedSoup,5,Thu Jan 22 17:56:32 2015 UTC,"Nice long post from tvinita explaining the current roles for subs  Hey everybody!  SUBS! Okay, submarines. When designing the subs, I was trying to preserve what would make submarines strategically interesting within the current meta of the game while keeping them easy for the player to both understand and manage.   Elusiveness So, whatever way subs behave, you want them to be a pain in the *** for your enemy to deal with. To accomplish this, there is not a submerge/surface state on the subs. Instead, submarines are always considered ""submerged"" as you can see above. The key here is that though the periscope is poking up out of the waves, submarines cannot actually be targeted by conventional weaponry because just look at how small a target that periscope is--how are you gonna' hit that with a broadside cannon? This forms the crux of what makes submarines a tricky target without making it too confusing or frustrating for the opponent who has to deal with them. While submarines have their own recon layer, it's not set up in any way to be different from surface/air vision. So you can see the submarine, both visually and on radar (no sonar needed), but unless you have torpedoes, you can't shoot back at it. Terror of the Seas Submarines are the cheapest naval units aside from the piranha. They're relatively agile compared to ships, and they pack a lot of anti-naval firepower into a conveniently cheap package that's hard to hit. A swarm of submarines will be an unprepared navy's worst nightmare, and though narwhals now have torpedo launchers to defend themselves--stolen from the orcas--metal for metal, a force submarines will win out against a force of narwhals every time, leaving your submarines free to pick apart the rest of your opponent's navy while you cackle maniacally. Not the end-all of Naval Control Submarines cannot be targeted by conventional ballistic weaponry, however, as of right now artillery and bombs can target submarines just as they can target ships. This is to make sure that you can't just maintain complete unchecked naval dominance by spamming submarines and your oppponent has no options to counter short of superweapons, and to further encourage unit diversity. If you want naval dominance, you're going to want a balanced force that can take on all potential threats to naval, rather than just building a unit that can maintain naval superiority while ignoring any other possible threats completely.   With that in mind, let's go into the design of the two new subs.  Tech 1 Submarine -- The Barracuda The Barracuda is cheaper and more maneuverable than the other ships, and it's packed with torpedoes that fire much more rapidly than the narwhal's. It also has lower Health than other ships. This allows it to function as your basic naval superiority unit, as most ships can't even fire on it and it's the most cost-effective optionf or maintaining control of the seas against ships. However, since it can only use torpedoes it can't do anything against land-based coastal bases like the narwhal and orca, nor can it defend itself against bombers.  Tech 2 Stealth Submarine -- The Kraken The intent behind the Kraken is for it to serve as a late-game raider of sorts. Basically, we have a lot of long-ranged and slow ships in t2 naval, and the Kraken is sort of the reverse. It has torpedoes equivalent to the Barracuda, but its primary weapon is its hailfire missile array, which is a shorter range bunch of missile launchers that serve very high DPS out to nearby enemies. Also, here's the kicker; the Kraken does not show up on radar. So if your enemy isn't scouting properly, a small crack team of krakens can be chewing through their base before they even know what's hit them.  Subs are likely to change a lot over the next few days as they're coming in hot off the presses, so be sure to play the PTE and provide plenty of feedback so we can make sure subs are at the best state they can possibly be when they hit the live build!  feel free to hit the thread if you want to get feedback or questions to him :) https://forums.uberent.com/threads/build-76843-pte-now-up.67298/page-13"

planetaryannihilation,2tayl7,ToastedSoup,1 point,Thu Jan 22 17:57:55 2015 UTC,Not sure if SC2 has it but you can tell transports to ferry from one place to another. It creates a permanent waypoint at the origin which you can tell units (or factories) to go to and the transports will automatically fly back and forth carrying units from the origin to the destination.
planetaryannihilation,2tayl7,machello,2,Thu Jan 22 18:15:55 2015 UTC,woah that would be absolutely amazing for orbital any units!
planetaryannihilation,2tayl7,ToastedSoup,1 point,Thu Jan 22 18:21:46 2015 UTC,It'd be easier to use a teleporter in that case. You can already have a factory output directly to the teleporter. And a telporter to a teleporter if you select the use command.
planetaryannihilation,2tayl7,SciFiz,1 point,Thu Jan 22 20:57:50 2015 UTC,true true but the energy cost offset would help for early game. late game it wouldn't really matter.
planetaryannihilation,2tayl7,ToastedSoup,1 point,Thu Jan 22 21:29:00 2015 UTC,I agree. I don't think ferrying would fit very well into PA's gameplay.

A second waypoint will appear near transporters and that would be a loading zone - every unit that recived a move command to that point (even new units leaving the factories) will go there and wait for a lift. If your transporter came back from the first drop it will automatically load another set of units and will go on and on again. In Supreme Commander you could add new transporters to the route by simply assisting the waypoint. That system was amazing and kinda worked but here in PA it will be kinda dull, air is made of paper and transport units only lift one unit per transporter.."

planetaryannihilation,2tayl7,Pendaelose,1 point,Thu Jan 22 19:42:44 2015 UTC,I the transport comes back to make a second trip it could be massivly useful.  Imainge you have 400 units but only 25 transports.   Just tell all the transports to assist the ferry locations and tell the units to go to the ferry.  Even if it takes 16 trips they will move everything without any micro.  Another case would be I have 4 factories pumping out units to a ferry point.  I don't need enough transports to move every unit that they will make all at once.  I only need 4-8 transports to move each unit as it builds and the transports will return to fetch the next.
planetaryannihilation,2tayl7,Pendaelose,1 point,Thu Jan 22 20:31:47 2015 UTC,"I love ferry commands and it was a feature I used extensively in supcom1.  They would also blend amazingly well with area commands.  I think the biggest barrier to getting it implemented in PA is that unless you are ferrying directly into the enemy base a pair of teleporters will do everything ferry points would have, faster, and is probably cheaper than building enough transports to move a medium sized army."

I'm actually not sure if they themselves us it (as I rarely play the AI). I'm sure it will improve however, sorian (the AI guy) keeps improving the AI in every build.  Humans tend to put up lots of umbrellas, have units protecting the commander at all times, and/or have a Pelican on stand-by to whizz the comm away on detecting incoming units. I mean, you can see them coming miles away if you have an orbital radar.

planetaryannihilation,2t3kdd,Hayatee,3,Tue Jan 20 22:05:14 2015 UTC,"Interesting match to watch, and I think it points out a couple leaks that I think a lot of people struggle with.  Your opponent said at the end of the game that one can 'bunker down' better in this level, but that glosses over the real reasons he won. It wasn't that pure defense really works as an overall strategy. (it really, really doesn't).  You kept taking bad trades trying to attack his turret walls (worse than 1 bolo for 1 bolo or equivalent economic damage), and you didn't take over enough of the metal that was yours by right of locking him into his base.  Additionally, you're in the blue on metal for about half the game, meaning you could have had more production - either facs to pump more units (a bomber snipe could have worked around minute 10 - you could have proxie'd the backside to keep him locked in/do some raiding), or fabbers to get to t2/ orbital. So even though you have a metal lead, you're not using it. He was probably using 100% of his metal whereas you probably hovered at 60%. That means that unless your metal lead was x12/3, he's actually beat you in production despite having access to less metal.  He turtled and teched and you let him do it. You needed to take the metal he let you have, then scout his move to orbital and t2, and then get there first. You could have easily had a much stronger eco than him, meaning that even if you catch him going t2 while it's halfway done, you can still get yours out first.  Additionally, you don't attempt coming into a different side of his base until minute 12. You've scouted the turrets at that entrance, and then you just keep trying to hit it. I would have left a small force to detect if he pushes out of there, and then sent the rest around to another entrance. or even just walk them by those cracks so they can ""trim the hedges"" of his base.  But generally in this scenario, where you find a player has an avenue locked down, just let it be locked down. Don't lose units for nothing, just let them build up outside his base, collect the remaining metal on the planet, scout him out, tech to t2 or orbital, or else pelter rush him, and then finish the game.  Anyway, that's just some advice on your gameplay: Good Trades, Round Planet, Always Expanding, Always Scouting (and not misidentifying nukes :P). Fun video to watch, and keep it up man!

I have this weird habit of thinking ""Hey I'm super high up with metal, which means Im doing great!"" and on one side ""Yes I have good eco"" and on the second one ""Damn I keep forgetting to use this!"". I really need to look at my metal and energy more frequently :/  Round planet is a new thing to me, even though I played a while. It's like one of the fewest games using this mechanic of having round maps, which is just mindblowing, it changes the strategy genre so much! And that is why I still need to grow accustomed to it :P  I seem to throw my units away for no apparent reason :P I need to think about them, one tank can decide of a victory, which is crazy too.

planetaryannihilation,2szmls,ghallo,8,Mon Jan 19 23:19:26 2015 UTC,"Sounds cool to me. More game modes in general would be awesome. Being able to play as a helping hand for an A.I. player would be cool, too. Like they'll do their own thing, but you can step in and tell a unit to do something else."
planetaryannihilation,2szmls,Lurking4Answers,1 point,Tue Jan 20 01:18:26 2015 UTC,"Couldn't you just create a team battle and then say ""share army""?"
planetaryannihilation,2szmls,the_Demongod,2,Tue Jan 20 04:59:36 2015 UTC,"Well then I'd have two commanders to keep track of, now wouldn't I?"
planetaryannihilation,2szmls,Lurking4Answers,1 point,Tue Jan 20 06:28:29 2015 UTC,Ah I see the difference now
planetaryannihilation,2szmls,the_Demongod,6,Tue Jan 20 06:30:39 2015 UTC,"In the original 1997 Total Annihilation, there was an option when creating a 1v1 match called ""win on commander death"" or something similar. You could uncheck it to do essentially what you described. I'm genuinely surprised they didn't bring that feature back."
planetaryannihilation,2szmls,the_Demongod,3,Tue Jan 20 02:10:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly!  That is where I got my idea.  One time we had a TA lan party that lasted 48 hours for a single game - and both times one side was down to a single bot they'd hid in a corner.  Certainly not for the faint of heart, but it was awesome for us!"
planetaryannihilation,2szmls,benedictFocker,5,Tue Jan 20 04:36:53 2015 UTC,"Hmm, king of the hill seems obvious.  You have multiple bases on each planet and controlling a small circle around it (no enemy units in the circle) gets you points per minute until points are maxed.  Or, build a super weapon like the death star, maybe a comm satellite to call for help from other systems.  It takes forever to build, build it once and you win.  So, it's like commander, but in reverse.  You lose when the other guy gets built, not when you get killed.  Can't think of anything else.  Killing all units would be a chore."
planetaryannihilation,2szmls,Pendaelose,5,Tue Jan 20 01:23:01 2015 UTC,Killing all units is certainly a chore - unless you think about the resources available in PA.  If a player really is outgunned it wouldn't take long to have 3k T2 bombers patrolling every planet.  I'm just tired of losing or winning a game on accident when I'm playing with friends.
planetaryannihilation,2szmls,yousernamecolon,5,Tue Jan 20 04:39:34 2015 UTC,"The best way to handle victory conditions would be a list with check boxes so you can turn them on/off  Potential game modes...   Kill Commander Destroy all builders Control 66% or more of all metal extractors, starts a 10 minute count down timer to victory Control 51% or more of rare ""critical locations"", starts a 5 minute count down timer to victory Earn Victory points for each controlled Metal extractor, Commander, and Critical location.  First player to reach X points wins.  Control more to gain points faster. Amass X stored metal Build Hypergate, starts a count down timer to victory Random Objectives - choose a random goal, give it to every player Divergent Paths - each player is given a different random goal Secret Mission - each player is given a different random goal that is NOT revealed to the other players.   You should be able to mix and match any of these.   Selecting Divergent Paths and Secret mission would mean that every player has 2 ways to win, but you can only see 1 of your opponents goals."
planetaryannihilation,2szmls,GeekWere,3,Tue Jan 20 15:56:59 2015 UTC,They could a capture the flag but with having either a commander to be captured or a special indestructible unit. They could be picked up by and Estrada or a pelican and then moved to some special building of yours
planetaryannihilation,2szmls,otterfamily,2,Tue Jan 20 02:22:05 2015 UTC,Pretty sure this was in Supreme Commander 2. I don't remember the name but was the same idea. If you destroyed all creation infrastructure then you'd win. So if you could save an engineer you could rebuild.
planetaryannihilation,2szmls,D0ng0nzales,1 point,Tue Jan 20 06:50:20 2015 UTC,"There's a great modding toolkit. I'm not sure if compopping is like a core ruleset to the game, but there's a lot of possibilities. Check out PA Mod Manager, check out some of the currently available mods, and if you dont find what you're looking for, you can start mucking around yourself! it's a lot of fun."
planetaryannihilation,2szmls,DrMonsi,1 point,Tue Jan 20 11:23:19 2015 UTC,I'll take a look.  The chances of me building a mod are near zero - I've got about 20-30 minutes on odd Tuesdays that I can play.  I just want to hop in and play.  (New baby arrives in less than a month...)
planetaryannihilation,2szmls,SlenderClaus,1 point,Tue Jan 20 19:34:54 2015 UTC,I think killing Every unit would be too hard and boring towards the end. Maybe something like 80% of the units killed and you loose?    Another cool gamemode would be a sort of arms race where you get points for each unit and you win if you hit something like 2k units
planetaryannihilation,2szmls,MajorasAss,1 point,Tue Jan 20 11:28:52 2015 UTC,"If you're playing with friends, it's not that hard to initiate such a thing... choose a map with lots of planets, and agree on one planet (or moon) to be the ""commander-planet"". Everyone brings his commander there ASAP and the planet shall thereafter not be touched by anything else, just the commanders, which are not allowed to build anything (or fight each other). Then fight your fight on all the other planets until someone has nothing left.  It's easy to create your own game-mode if you play with friends that agree on certain rules. For instance, I and my friend used to play a game where we both had our start-planet which was not allowed to be touched by the enemy, and a third planet where we were only allowed to build a portal upon, to send an army there, without moving the army yet. After a set time (iirc we agreed on 40 minutes), we had to send our commander to the third planet, too, and let our armies clash on command. (No orbital units, no unit cannons, no satellites/radars, no deff-buildings or nukes, just one orbital builder to bulid the teleporter on the fighting planet). Was quite fun."

When the moon was finally destroyed via us returning it to sender he strangely flew back to his home planet undamaged!"

planetaryannihilation,2sxh0j,Zykey_,2,Mon Jan 19 12:25:54 2015 UTC,That was fucking brilliant!
planetaryannihilation,2sxh0j,Bofty,2,Mon Jan 19 13:56:02 2015 UTC,"How did they get the system to move like that into the sun? I know that the halley is necessary to move a body, but I didn't know they could be moved the like that."
planetaryannihilation,2sxh0j,_AwwYiss_,2,Mon Jan 19 20:02:17 2015 UTC,"They moved the main body that all the others were orbiting, so instead of leaving orbit they simply followed along. I guess they had it move to hit one of the planets that was orbiting it, and as a result moved the whole system closer to the sun. They then canceled the order before the main body hit the sun, resulting in all the orbiting bodies instead colliding with the sun."

planetaryannihilation,2syhal,DrMonsi,3,Mon Jan 19 18:17:16 2015 UTC,"Each message which changes the state of the game is counted as a single command.  So clicking without a unit selected, moving the camera, selecting/deselecting units will not count towards your command rate.    I believe that all your examples only count as one command each, though it depends on how the 'add 100' mod is implemented."
planetaryannihilation,2syhal,ezerek,2,Tue Jan 20 03:50:49 2015 UTC,The add 100 mod is just one command. There is a single line of javascript that the mod just changes from 5 to 100.
planetaryannihilation,2syhal,cptconundrum20,1 point,Wed Jan 21 00:41:43 2015 UTC,"I think it's just when you tell a unit to do something. I think if you spam click a spot, each click will count as a command."

planetaryannihilation,2sx8zq,sadzora,5,Mon Jan 19 10:15:01 2015 UTC,"Its a bug for sure, lets hope they will fix it soonish."
planetaryannihilation,2sx8zq,Xanoxis,2,Mon Jan 19 12:47:31 2015 UTC,"I have noticed the same behaviour several times now... I think it has to do with the sizes, if you let a moon crash into another moon (as an example) they'll both explode.   But, as you mentioned, i was also surprised to see that all Units and Buildings right next to the impact area were still alive, i thought the impact wave would annihilate all living beings on the planet. I'm not sure about this, but I believe to remember that this used to be different than it is now, that a moon whatever size would annihilate all Life on a planet, no matter if the planet itself survived or not."
planetaryannihilation,2sx8zq,DrMonsi,1 point,Mon Jan 19 18:24:01 2015 UTC,I'm even seeing buildings at ground zero survive :/ They remain functional and well with about 10% hp floating at the place where the ground used to be.
planetaryannihilation,2sx8zq,DrMonsi,1 point,Tue Jan 20 08:08:50 2015 UTC,"yeah. what bothered me most was when i once tried to moon-bomb a Death-star to avoid being annihilated by that thing, i hit the death-star with my moon at the top where the catalyst are located, only to find out that the catalysts were still buildable, and so i got annihilasered a few minutes later."
planetaryannihilation,2sx8zq,DrMonsi,1 point,Tue Jan 20 08:42:36 2015 UTC,Thats really weird. Seems sort of a waste of effort that they actually moddeled out a seperate detailed metal planet crater if it has no effect.
planetaryannihilation,2sx8zq,crazyweaselbob,1 point,Tue Jan 20 08:48:54 2015 UTC,i guess it's just a bug that's going to be fixed sooner or later... (let's hope for sooner :D)
planetaryannihilation,2sxsv5,jbarrett531,0,Mon Jan 19 14:56:34 2015 UTC,What's the point though? We have the Unit Cannon now
planetaryannihilation,2sxsv5,MajorasAss,2,Mon Jan 19 15:45:16 2015 UTC,"A unit cannon can only load 12 units. can only shoot once. I'm suggesting a rebalance for a hopefully more enjoyable game play. So maybe once carriers are introduced unit cannons could be made even more expensive and less efficient than they already are.   I could be in the minority, but i find teleporters and unit cannons pretty lame. I think they are interesting mechanics, but as the main mechanic for intra-planet warfare, they don't feel as cool as planetary annihilation should feel. I like teleporters and would hope they still exist, but maybe as a very expensive item, with a lot more durability. Instead of being so cheap and fragile--used as a surprise rather than a strategy."
planetaryannihilation,2sxsv5,wellstone,2,Mon Jan 19 19:47:01 2015 UTC,So make it 64 units and it can bring vehicles and air units. I think this would be so much fun to play. I think you could keep teleports just make them much more expensive.
