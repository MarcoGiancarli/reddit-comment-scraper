DebateAChristian,3dytoz,fhqwhgads_,13,Mon Jul 20 17:17:21 2015 UTC,From where did you grab the conclusion that human happiness and well-being are the best medium to determine moral opinion?
DebateAChristian,3dytoz,Zuunster,5,Mon Jul 20 17:24:42 2015 UTC,I didn't say that. I said that my method is coherent and reliable. It is also repeatable. I could write an algorithm and give it my rules and it would be able to make these decisions. Do Christians have something similar? I assume they must if they claim to have a reliable moral compass.
DebateAChristian,3dytoz,Jaeil,5,Mon Jul 20 18:04:00 2015 UTC,"I didn't say that.   So you're saying that    human happiness and well-being are the best medium to determine moral opinion    is not true about your system, despite the fact that it's a moral system that maximizes human happiness and well-being.   I said that my method is coherent and reliable. It is also repeatable. I could write an algorithm and give it my rules and it would be able to make these decisions.   There are any number of moral systems that conform to these guidelines.  Let's use an example that we'll term strangleism:   Strangleism: Maximize the number of people you kill with your bare hands.   Now, you say of your moral system,   When I make a moral decision I pick the option that seems to maximize human happiness and well-being, taking into account as many factors as I can. Theoretically, an algorithm could be crafted to determine the choice associated with the global maximum of human happiness and well-being for any given dilemma.   The strangleist can similarly say,   When I make a moral decision I pick the option that seems to maximize killing people with my bare hands, taking into account as many factors as I can. Theoretically, an algorithm could be crafted to determine the choice associated with the global maximum of killing people with my bare hands for any given dilemma.   Strangleism is coherent; there is no confusion as to what it considers valuable and worthy of doing.  Strangleism is reliable; no matter what situation you're in, you can start killing people with your bare hands.  Strangleism is repeatable; all you have to do is get your bare hands on someone.  You could write an algorithm and give it to a robot that would go around killing people with its bare hands.  So, by your given criteria, strangleism is just as good a moral system as yours.  It might even be better, because it's much easier to judge when you've killed a man with your bare hands than if you've increased net human happiness.  Hence Zuunster's question, why is your moral system better than strangleism?  Remember that saying ""but my moral system maximizes happiness!"" is begging the question since it's precisely the merit of the maximization of happiness that we're questioning (as to its relative worth over killing people with your bare hands)."
DebateAChristian,3dytoz,NadaPlakat,6,Mon Jul 20 19:13:46 2015 UTC,Again missing the point. Its not about whether his is better. It's about whether you even have one.
DebateAChristian,3dytoz,Jaeil,3,Mon Jul 20 19:30:01 2015 UTC,"The Christian could come up with any number of moral systems.  ""Love God, love your neighbor"" is just as viable as ""Maximize human happiness"".  But ""can we think of random moral systems"" isn't a very interesting question, so we move from ethics to metaethics.  Which moral system should we prefer?  This is what's behind the question - why is utilitarianism better than strangleism?  This is an especially pertinent question as OP denied that his system was the best way to determine moral opinion."
DebateAChristian,3dytoz,NadaPlakat,6,Mon Jul 20 19:50:13 2015 UTC,"The Christian could come up with any number of moral systems.   Sure, but which one is the one you think this supposed god wants?  That's the question.  Whether or not your god is immoral is a separate question."

DebateAChristian,3dytoz,ZapMePlease,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:46:10 2015 UTC,Do you agree that Christianity successfully clarifies everyone's innate moral compass?
DebateAChristian,3dytoz,MaxineK,4,Tue Jul 21 00:48:21 2015 UTC,Except for one big diffference.  OP was using the coherent and reproducible nature of an algorithm in combination with the fundamental view that moral theory is grounded on well being.  Your argumentum ad absurdum only meets one of the tests and thus fails.  If you want to argue that well being is not foundational to morality then it would be interesting to hear what you claim IS foundational to it.
DebateAChristian,3dytoz,Jaeil,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:32:02 2015 UTC,"in combination with the fundamental view that moral theory is grounded on well being.   But OP didn't argue for that.  /u/Zuunster specifically challenged that view here:   From where did you grab the conclusion that human happiness and well-being are the best medium to determine moral opinion?   OP then denied that view:   I didn't say that. I said that my method is coherent and reliable.   Clearly, OP values this system for being coherent and reliable, not for being in agreement with the view that morality is grounded in well-being.  Furthermore, the purpose of the strangleism example was to challenge the ""fundamental view"" that you brought up.  Why is well being the ground of moral theory?  Merely asserting that it is does not justify your position.   If you want to argue that well being is not foundational to morality then it would be interesting to hear what you claim IS foundational to it.   Consequentialism makes up about a quarter of philosophers.  Deontology, which takes up another quarter, founds morality in duties, not consequential well-being.  Virtue ethics, which takes up another quarter, founds morality in virtue, not in well-being per se.  But, of course, none of this is really necessary for me to defend in order to question OP's claim."
DebateAChristian,3dytoz,MaxineK,2,Mon Jul 20 20:13:40 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but your reply is disingenuous from the word go.  OP's reply was that he wasn't arguing that happiness and well being are the best medium to determine moral opinion.  And he wasn't.  He was arguing that you could construct a moral system by algorithm based solely on well being and happiness.  Zuunster was doing nothing but playing semantic games.   Clearly, OP values this system for being coherent and reliable, not for being in agreement with the view that morality is grounded in well-being.   well being was implicit in his statement - which is clear with any fair reading.  If not his statement would be that 'any system that is coherent is valid' which he clearly did not mean.  Your reply is just nitpicking because you didn't care for his choice of words.  If you want to start discussing moral systems then I think you'll find yourself on very shaky ground indeed.  Morality is generally based on either Virtue ethics (or similar pragmatic systems such as utilitarianism or welfarism), deonotology, or divine command theory.  I'll skip divine command theory because it's to morality what McDonalds is to haute cuisine.  Virtue ethics is based on well being and reduction of harm.  Deontology, though rules based, finds itself stuck in the position of noting that the rules that end up being used are invariably based on well being and harm reduction so they attempt to reconcile these systems.  Even Nagel, the most notable of the contemporary philosophers who is a deontologist, recognizes that deontology has, at it's core, a basis of welfarism.  So in summary - you've simply cherrypicked/misread OP's claim in an attempt to discredit it.  I challenge you to find a moral philosopher who denies that well being and harm reduction are not the foundation of morality.  Even Nietzsche acknowledges this in his concept of Slave Morality."
DebateAChristian,3dytoz,Jaeil,3,Mon Jul 20 21:36:12 2015 UTC,His moral system- and yours too- are both superior because you both much more closely approximate what humans as a group intuitively feel to correct and moral choices.
DebateAChristian,3dytoz,MaxineK,8,Tue Jul 21 11:46:56 2015 UTC,"There we go!  Moral intuition.  I think that's generally considered a good basis for morality, at least to start with.  You run into underdetermination, though.  Consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics are all approximal to human moral intuitions.  Why is ""algorithmic"" a reason to pick OP's version over another."
DebateAChristian,3dytoz,Zuunster,-3,Tue Jul 21 15:19:11 2015 UTC,"I agree. I am actually a virtue ethicist myself!   I was just trying to advance the argument a little, keep it interesting :)"

I'm not actually sure where the debate was going to go after some justification for OP's system, but I think it's been said enough places in this thread that Christianity provides some account of virtue that can be structured in a VE system, so I guess that's all I have to say here."
DebateAChristian,3dytoz,Zuunster,4,Tue Jul 21 18:14:27 2015 UTC,"Lack of account for human moral intuition was a huge flaw (and an intentional flaw, I think) in your stranglerism analogy, that's all. If something with the same underpinning logic of stranglerism also lead to conclusions which fell in line with moral intuition, I see no reason why it wouldn't be a viable moral system.   Still though, utilitarianism and it's derivatives have some substantial problems, which is why I don't subscribe to it."

Yet there are a number of moral scenarios (see OP) that the Bible does not openly address.   It may or may not be true that a coherent, reliable, and repeatable method of determining the correct moral choice in all situations is impossible from a godless perspective.

Christians believe that there are universal laws that govern the hearts of all men. So no matter how a certain society feels about a topic, if it disfranchises itself from the universally known (by God) truth, it is a false law.   Christians might not have the answers or the ability to give a coherent, reliable, and repeatable method of determining accurate moral decisions, but we believe there is an absolute truth to every situation.   Jesus summed up the entire Jewish law with two commandments;   Love the Lord your God with all your passion and prayer and intelligence. Love others as well as you love yourself.   /u/versebot [Matthew 22:37-40 MSG]  These do not help us conclude a moral decision that involves the preparations of a lamb sacrifice, nor do they explain the need for it.

Abdicating discernment and intuition in favor of a modified version of Jeremy Bentham's hedonicstic calculus scares the life out of me.  If you accept the Aristotelian categories of logos and pathos to characterize the way in which we make our decisions, this methodology completely ignores our emotional/intuitive side - potentially even demonizing it because it is ""unreliable"" or ""unfalsifiable"", notions that modern day lay-atheists who expand the scientific method to deal with moral, ontological, and epistemological problems find...tedious.  I personally think this is terrifying and always leads to the Rapture problem, Anna Karenina, or no high-fiving/zero-tolerance policies in schools.  It's a shame, in my opinion, that Freud and Jung have fallen out of fashion.  I think their discernment is truly needed for the post-modern world.

Over the time I've been a Christian my answer to what is right or wrong has changed as I've learned more about God and his character. Christianity is not based off a set of strict rules that we just immediately know, it's about engaging in a relationship. In relationships more is revealed to you over time and you grow and change based off the new information. This is why you see so many believers with different answers to things. As Christians grow in what they know about God their view of the world and how to act in it changes."

DebateAChristian,3dytoz,LiquidSilver,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:36:12 2015 UTC,"The framework in the Bible covers nearly all moral issues that I come across. My views on certain things have changed over time because I feel that I have learned more about the Bible. I have studied a lot about historical context, words that don't translate into English well, and have a deeper knowledge of what all is in that huge book. This knowledge informs me of God's character and the character that I should have. If some moral decision I'm making doesn't line up with the character traits outlined in the Bible, I know I am most likely making an immoral decision and should think things through before moving forward. Could I twist the scripture and manipulate it to do almost anything I want? Yes, I could do that. However, that is something that the Bible warns not to do and requires glossing over a lot of passages.       How do you know that you are closer to knowing what is right/wrong now, rather than moving away from what is really right/wrong?       This is a tough one to answer because you do not believe the same things as I do. I don't know 100% that I am closer. All evidence in scripture and my emotional state tells me that I am moving closer. I also believe that the Holy Spirit dwells within me and guides me in what is true. The Bible tells me this and it is definitely a different sense within me than just my natural tendency.

But basically, yes, there are ways of answering the types of moral questions in the op.

DebateAChristian,3dytoz,MaxineK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:18:23 2015 UTC,"Adultery.  There comes a point in your system where the risk of being found out balances with the hapyp feelings you might get from committing adultery.  In my system there is no such point.  It is better to be miserable, but faithfully love your wife, than to pursue happiness without love.  Here's an example where your system isn't helpful.  It's possible to kill someone painlessly.  How much happiness and well-being does that prevent?  You can make arguments for any level.  You could argue it prevents any opportunity for happiness and well-being.  You could argue that the human killed never experiences a lack of happiness or well-being any more.  Here's another example.  Someone tortures a child for a day.  Somehow that act makes the rest of the world population have a very slightly better day - my day improves by one seven-billionth of the measure that the child's day/life/whatever get's ruined.  The costs balance out.  Is that act morally neutral?  What if the ratio was tweaked, and the net happiness and well-being of the world was very slightly improved by torturing a child?  Would that become a moral act?  Really?  And the final problem I have for you is a problem of ignorance.  Actually, due to the fact our world is chaotic, we have no way of determining which acts maximise happiness and well-being.  Killing a baby is bad, but what if that baby was hitler, and killing it prevented ww2 and the holocaust?  Or what if ww2 somehow has some massive effect on the world in 2200, and prevents a worse genocide then?  Would killing the baby be wrong then?  What about investing in the company that made the pens that were used in the death camps?  We wouldn't know!  Maybe all bad actions have simply not been given enough time for their truly good consequences to shine?  But you'll say ""what about intention?"" - well what of it?  It's not relevant to your moral system.  Intentions don't necessarily bear any relevance to the consequences of your actions, because, long-term, there is no way of predicting the consequences of your actions.  So intentions are irrelevant.  Which means the problem of ignorance is huge."

When I get into this discussion with people, they often respond, ""So you would just let your family starve?!""  No, of course not. I have a responsibility to my family. It surprises me that people always leave out the third option. If I were in this same situation, I would go to another Christian (I know quite a few) and ask for help. Any other Christian, if they claim to be one, would gladly offer me whatever I need to sustain my family, and I would do the same for them. The Bible also directs us to act this way.   The trolley problem   I've always hated the trolley problem. It's not a moral quandary; it's a thought experiment with no satisfying outcome, and one that is very unlikely to occur in real life. Just about every real moral issue we encounter, though, can be solved by drawing on the wisdom of God's word."
DebateAChristian,3dytoz,MaxineK,8,Tue Jul 21 12:38:49 2015 UTC,"Some moral principles can be inferred in and extrapolated from various Biblical texts--the Ten Commandments, for instance.  It is bad to commit adultery, it is bad to commit murder, it is bad to steal, and so on.  In addition, the morality of other actions can be inferred from these.  It's bad to murder, so what other actions, related to murder or arising from the same impulses might be bad?  Jesus gives us an example of such an extrapolation when he said:   You have heard that it was said to the men of old, ‘You shall not kill; and whoever kills shall be liable to judgment.’ But I say to you that every one who is angry with his brother shall be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother shall be liable to the council, and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ shall be liable to the hell of fire.   You'll see in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, as well as other catechisms such as Luther's Small and Large Catechisms, that under the heading of the Fifth Commandment are included many other things that are bad.  Take Luther's Small Catechism...   The Fifth Commandment.  Thou shalt not kill.  What does this mean?--Answer.  We should fear and love God that we may not hurt nor harm our neighbor in his body, but help and befriend him in every bodily need [in every need and danger of life and body].   So you see that under the Fifth Commandment, ""Thou shall not kill (murder)"" can be included positive as well as negative commandments.    Luther sums up the LORDS teaching in the verse in Matthew (just quoted) by saying in the Large Catechism:   Christ Himself explains and sums it up, namely, that we must not kill, neither with hand, heart, mouth, signs, gestures, help, nor counsel.   Luther continues:   Secondly, under this commandment not only he is guilty who does evil to his neighbor, but he also who can do him good, prevent, resist evil, defend and save him, so that no bodily harm or hurt happen to him, and yet does not do it. If, therefore, you send away one that is naked when you could clothe him, you have caused him to freeze to death; if you see one suffer hunger and do not give him food, you have caused him to starve. So also, if you see any one innocently sentenced to death or in like distress, and do not save him, although you know ways and means to do so, you have killed him.   So the principle is ""thou shall not murder"", but then see how much can be gleaned from just that.    So likewise with the sixth commandment and all the rest.  I think Luther's Large Catechism is very thorough and very good in this regard.  Under the Fifth Commandment the Catechism of the Catholic Church includes her teaching on the dignity of all human life, including the unborn:   Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion.   This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable.   Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law.   Concerning your question about stealing to feed one's starving family, the Catechism of the Catholic Church--again taking into account both the moral principle concerning theft as well as the moral principle concerning the dignity of human life, says this:   The seventh commandment forbids unjustly taking or keeping the goods of one's neighbor and wronging him in any way with respect to his goods. It commands justice and charity in the care of earthly goods and the fruits of men's labor. For the sake of the common good, it requires respect for the universal destination of goods and respect for the right to private property. Christian life strives to order this world's goods to God and to fraternal charity.   And...   The seventh commandment forbids theft, that is, usurping another's property against the reasonable will of the owner. There is no theft if consent can be presumed or if refusal is contrary to reason and the universal destination of goods. This is the case in obvious and urgent necessity when the only way to provide for immediate, essential needs (food, shelter, clothing . . .) is to put at one's disposal and use the property of others.   So, one does not steal if one is lost in a snow storm in the woods and happens upon a cabin.  Once inside the cabin, he takes some of the wood that's been piled beside the stove and lights a fire to warm himself.  The man in this case does not steal the wood, even if he is not at that time nor will he ever be able to replace the wood.    If the owner of the cabin had been there at the time and he refused to allow the stranded man inside but instead shut the door in his face, he would have sinned against charity and been responsible for the stranded man's death (if he died as a result of the storm).  In the case of the Trolley Problem, one can never do evil that good may come.  But we have the principle of ""double effect"".   Double-effect originates in Thomas Aquinas' treatment of homicidal self-defense, in his work Summa Theologica.  This set of criteria states that an action having foreseen harmful effects practically inseparable from the good effect is justifiable if the following are true:    the nature of the act is itself good, or at least morally neutral;   the agent intends the good effect and not the bad either as a means to the good or as an end itself;   the good effect outweighs the bad effect in circumstances sufficiently grave to justify causing the bad effect and the agent exercises due diligence to minimize the harm.   In its discussion of the principle of double effect, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy writes:   It would be wrong to throw someone into the path of a runaway trolley in order to stop it and keep it from hitting five people on the track ahead; that would involve intending harm to the one as a means of saving the five. But it would be permissible to divert a runaway trolley onto a track holding one and away from a track holding five: in that case one foresees the death of the one as a side effect of saving the five but one does not intend it."

So I will go to the leaders and speak to them; surely they know the way of the LORD, the requirements of their God."" But with one accord they too had broken off the yoke and torn off the bonds. Jeremiah 8:8-9 How can you say, ""We are wise, for we have the law of the LORD,"" when actually the lying pen of the scribes has handled it falsely? The wise men are put to shame, They are dismayed and caught; Behold, they have rejected the word of the LORD, And what kind of wisdom do they have?   Yes, I am accusing orthodoxy the same accusations that the prophets have brought forth. The prayer of Jesus builds on top of his teachings:   Sheep without a shepherd. The blind leading the blind. People who distort the truth and are wellsprings of darkness (Isaiah 5:20).   Jesus saw the people crucifying him as mislead and are therefore not to blame.   On the other hand, the crucifixion was used to prove the point of Isaiah 66:3, i.e., ""whoever sacrifices a bull is like one who kills a person, and whoever offers a lamb is like one who breaks a dog's neck;"" - the innocent die because of the apathy or cruelty of the wicked. The sacrifices meant nothing because when they sacrifice a bull and think of the problem as solved and they do not make reparations, they actually let the wronged party (or even an innocent bystander) suffer. After all, no man is an island.

Even though they haven't asked for forgiveness, they are being granted amnesty for this act.  Why is he saying, ""Father, forgive them"" instead of ""I forgive you""?

Well, yes, it is eternal torment. My point was that good people do not go to heaven, because there are no good people or bad people (or, if anything, there are only bad people). There are those rebelling against God and those who have laid down their arms.   C.S. Lewis wrote: ""I willingly believe that the damned are, in one sense, successful rebels to the end; that the doors of hell are locked on the inside. I do not mean that the ghost may wish to come out of hell, in the vague fashion that an envious man 'wishes' to be happy: but they certainly do not will even the first preliminary stages of that self-abandonment through which alone the soul can reach any good. They enjoy forever the horrible freedom they have demanded, and are therefore self-enslaved: just as the blessed, forever submitting to obedience, become through all eternity more and more free.""  No one denies that hell consists of torment."

That is a pretty nice example of Lewis' mental gymnastics, but I wonder if you agree with his suggestion that Hell is a place that can be escaped at will.  Are the doors locked from the inside?"
DebateAChristian,3drv7m,jalexan4,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:41:22 2015 UTC,"The idealist in me says yes, though I do know not for certain. I simply believe that rather than hell being a place that people are forced into against their will, it is their will exactly which has brought them there. It is a state of mind which begins before death  EDIT: Forgot a word"
DebateAChristian,3drv7m,jalexan4,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:36:19 2015 UTC,Can you describe what might constitute a state of mind that would result in Hell?
DebateAChristian,3drv7m,jalexan4,2,Mon Jul 20 11:08:44 2015 UTC,"I cannot articulate it perfectly. The mind becomes increasingly focused on itself, leading to insanity. C.S. Lewis, in The Great Divorce depicts the process throughout the novel. People become more and more self-focused, and in the process they lose their humanity. In the novel they gradually become shadows and fade away into nothing. He also adds, ""The whole difficulty of understanding Hell is that the thing to be understood is so nearly Nothing."""
DebateAChristian,3drv7m,Madmonk11,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:06:08 2015 UTC,Why should I care what C.S. Lewis writes about Hell?  His musings on the matter have no more weight than anyone else's.
DebateAChristian,3drv7m,Idea_Bliss,0,Tue Jul 21 00:23:12 2015 UTC,"Why should I care what C.S. Lewis writes about Hell?    You asked me to ""describe what might constitute a state of mind that would result in Hell"". I learned the idea from C.S. Lewis. Therefore I quoted him in answering your question."
DebateAChristian,3drv7m,Madmonk11,2,Tue Jul 21 04:36:09 2015 UTC,I guess I am asking why you think C.S. Lewis has any authority on the matter.  It isn't as though Lewis presented evidence for his assertions about the nature of hell.
DebateAChristian,3drv7m,Idea_Bliss,0,Tue Jul 21 04:47:43 2015 UTC,"Jesus is the bridegroom and we, the church, are the bride. What bride doesn't want to spend time with her bridegroom and vice versa? The longing to be together is strong and constant - something to look forward to and anticipate."
DebateAChristian,3drv7m,FrontierProject,0,Sun Jul 19 20:57:37 2015 UTC,"You have simply restated the scenario using metaphor.  God presumably doesn't want us for sex (bridegroom) or reproduction, so what is it exactly that he wants with inferior beings?  What more could we offer him than a large group of angels?  It would be similar to humans wanting to collect large numbers of well-behaved monkeys together in order to build a perfect monkey society in heaven.  The monkeys would always be inferior, but we love them infinitely...it just makes no sense."
DebateAChristian,3drv7m,Idea_Bliss,0,Sun Jul 19 21:18:54 2015 UTC,"oh well.   it makes sense to me. You could probably figure it out, but the crux of the problem is how you see God. I think that probably less than 5% of people who are familiar with Christianity (e.g. the Western world) have a correct understanding of who God is. This is what leads to all sorts of bizarre and bad conclusions: God is a senile Santa Claus - you can trick him into giving you good things by going to church and confessing your sins on Sunday. God is an angry monster who basically wants to cause suffering and cruelty. God wants you to be rich and healthy and happy. God just likes punishing people for sin and sending them to hell. God is impotent in the face of suffering, he's a weakling.   All of these are completely wrong and blasphemous (no, blasphemy implies an intent to do this, not out of ignorance).  One can't really discuss anything about God until one agrees which version of God one is talking about.   It somehow makes sense to me for the God I know to want to spend  eternity with people.  It makes no sense to you for the God you are thinking of to want to do this."
DebateAChristian,3drv7m,FrontierProject,0,Mon Jul 20 01:56:01 2015 UTC,All of those gods have biblical support.
DebateAChristian,3drv7m,Idea_Bliss,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:06:19 2015 UTC,"haha. Funny.  Yes, the problem is indeed that we are talking about different gods."
DebateAChristian,3drv7m,FrontierProject,2,Mon Jul 20 10:38:54 2015 UTC,"I think the problem isn't with idealizing the wrong god, but rather showing evidence for one's convictions.  The god of the Bible is pretty much what you describe above.  If you feel any differently, it is because you are a modern human, with a modern sense of morality and you are idealizing god in your own way.  The fact of the matter is that 100% of Christians have all their work ahead of them if they want to convince anyone that their particular idea of god is indeed correct.    In other words, your insistence that god is perfectly good and immune from culpability is nothing more than an assertion.  I'd rather god speak for himself."
DebateAChristian,3drv7m,Idea_Bliss,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:15:26 2015 UTC,"I'm a little confused about what you're saying. Nevertheless, I don't really have time to debate things - just way too busy, sorry. I'm sure if you want to learn about God you could (e.g. read CS Lewis, A.W.Tozer ""The Knowledge of the Holy"", J.I. Packer)."

Either there is no god and we are ""just"" humans or there is a god and we are more than ""just"" humans. If there is a god and we can exist in heaven, then we are no more ""just a human"" as you are ""just a orc"" when you play WoW.   So, why would God want us there and care? I don't know, I would first have to understand what I really am to know why I was valued."
DebateAChristian,3drv7m,peter-son-of-john,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:00:14 2015 UTC,"Hehe, you can't assume there is a God and people can exist in heaven, then also assume that we are just humans.    I disagree.  A god could simply preserve our merely-human conciousness and transfer it to a better body.  No ""soul"" is necessary.     So, why would God want us there and care? I don't know, I would first have to understand what I really am to know why I was valued.   I know what you mean.  I don't know either."
DebateAChristian,3drv7m,peter-son-of-john,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:29:58 2015 UTC,"Right, it is possible that a god just transfer our human consciousness. Then again, if our ""consciousness"" can be moved to varying bodies, how does it differ from our concept of ""soul""?"
DebateAChristian,3drv7m,peter-son-of-john,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:53:16 2015 UTC,"I would think that it would be different in the sense that the ""soul"" is typically defined as being immune to death and is viewed more as a ""ghost in the machine"" than a product of a physical/material brain."
DebateAChristian,3drv7m,peter-son-of-john,4,Sun Jul 19 17:51:33 2015 UTC,"Right, but if we were simply transferring bodies, then ""death"" is no different than buying a new car. It ceases to have any real meaning. I may not be following your point though, so forgive me if I've missed the gist."
DebateAChristian,3drv7m,Wo1olo,3,Sun Jul 19 18:26:37 2015 UTC,"I think you are missing the difference.  The soul is an enduring entity, whereas a material consciousness is just a product of the brain.  When the brain dies, a soul endures on its own, but the material consciousness is lost as the brain dies and loses function.  A god could presumably ""save"" the state of this physical brain and transfer it to a new and better brain.  The soul is more of an observer that inhabits bodies, but can survive without them."
DebateAChristian,3drv7m,alnilham,2,Sun Jul 19 18:38:30 2015 UTC,"Ok, I gotcha. However, if this is the case then we are back to the ""why"" question. Why does he care enough to do these transfers? This implies we must have some kind of value to this god. Which brings us back to my second point, there is no way for us to know what this value is or even could be without understanding alot more than we may now, so we can't really say that there is none, or that it makes no sense."

Reality is the product of infinite being and intelligence and is populated by numerous finite intelligences. At this stage of reality, the constituent intelligences are not unified with or in harmony with God, the infinite creative intelligence, with the result of our world being in a state of conflict and chaos. Once we are familiarized with the effects of this disharmony in this life, we move on to a state of harmony in the next.....if we so choose."
