Thing is I'm visiting Canada in 11 days for the long weekend and probably won't be able to go to a Sephora, but there's an ever so slight chance that I might.

makeupexchange,3e0dsi,aralimwastaken,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:09:55 2015 UTC,"It would be $24.35 USD per lipstick and a flat rate of $8 for shipping.  Taxes are 13% in my province, so if you're going to somewhere like Alberta where the taxes are 5% it would work out to be $22.63 USD per lipstick.

I got a number online that shows lower, but I don't exactly trust it since I've never shipped anything to Canada for less than $5 really.

makeupexchange,3e0dsi,suishu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:14:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know it's pretty vague. I guess I'm open to many things since there's a lot I haven't tried. I'll update it with some more specifics.   I'm actually planning to buy either the Shara Shara Honey Bomb or Scinic AIO fairly soon and am testing a small sample of Honey Bomb. If there's something you were interested I'd swap with a Honey Bomb decant, but I don't think I'd want to purchase one outright (unless you had Aqua Bomb. Now that one I really want to try).   And I am also very much interested in masks. Only tried MBD so far, which I love, but open to other brands."
makeupexchange,3e0dsi,suishu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:19:13 2015 UTC,"Oh I see. Did you see the PSA on /r/AB about the scinic aio sale on jolse? It's not much but about 1.5$ off per aio.   In reference to the masks, I have the following:  MBD Imperial Bird's Nest, Pearl Powder, Black Pearl & Natto 1.5$ each  Nature Republic Aqua (hydro) gels Canola Honey, Grapefruit 2.5$ each  Foodaholic Snail 1$ each  Tosowoong Propolis 1.5$ each  Benton 2$ each   Edit: I just realized you didn't want to purchase a decant of the Shara Shara.

I wanted to get Shara Shara though, but at the Scinic prices right now it's hard to resist x.x But I think the Berry Bomb and Aqua Bomb are what appeal to me the most with Shara Shara, and there's no real equivalent in Scinic (the Aqua ingredients seem quite different).   I guess I should've overall clarified too that I'd prefer to swap than buy. Just calculated how much I've spent this month (a whole lot on AB!) and trying to recoup some of the costs and avoid spending too unnecessarily. Otherwise I'm really tempted to buy some of the MBD masks =X"

makeupexchange,3dru4s,fantastic_lee,2,Sat Jul 18 21:14:32 2015 UTC,"Check out other posts to see how it's done :)  Basically your username needs to be in every single picture  List details about each product (usage, shade, age, price you're selling it for in which currency)  Take pictures of the product exposed where possible (lipsticks out of the tube, open palettes, etc) obviously you can't do this for lipgloss.  Mention any problems (if a product is broken, doesn't clasp correctly, etc)  Last but very important, you can't have more than 10 things in a picture, right now I have no idea what you have to offer since you haven't listed anything rather it's a big pile of assorted products."

makeupexchange,3dpm1r,cookie1005,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:04:05 2015 UTC,Here it is.  I hope this works.  The one lighter shadow looks like it has been used a lot but it is just the lighting.  Most of the shadows have not been used as I had them already as singles.  I don't think I have the box.  If I can't find it I do have a an empty palette box.  IMG_0291.jpg

makeupexchange,3dl6d2,luetinentdank420,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:43:35 2015 UTC,"I would describe them as a very pigmented gloss. They remind me a lot of OCC lip tars. If I applied thin layers with a brush and blotted I could get a little more staying power, but I'd say they act and last as long as most glosses. Hope that helps and let me know if you're still interested!"

makeupexchange,3djqxo,Maimoon23,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:33:41 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be completely honest here, I absolutely love it. I wish that I had taken before and after pictures of my face. I was so skeptical because all these bloggers kept saying they saw results overnight and I was thinking, ""yeah, right"" but I really did see results overnight. My hyperpigmentation was significantly lighter the following morning. I've been using it for about a month and it's almost completely gone now. I don't know that it does much for reducing the appearance of pores. I see a slight difference in that but it's not too too much. Even if you decide not to buy it please do go get a sample from Sephora if you can. It's seriously the first skincare product I've ever used that is like, HG status. Also, sorry for the long response, I just love this oil so much lol."

makeupexchange,3dg6bf,uberalice,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:34:00 2015 UTC,Maybe 4 times? It's a very opaque formula so I'd typically just dab the excess on the wand onto the back of my hand and it would be enough to coat my lips using a brush. It's just a touch too orange for me so it never gets worn. :(
makeupexchange,3dg6bf,uberalice,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:40:01 2015 UTC,Ok!  Sold!  PM me your Paypal email? :)  Edit: how old is it?

makeupexchange,3db3nf,Stuckwithme39,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:37:12 2015 UTC,Please let me know what you'd like for it; I'd be willing to purchase more than one.
makeupexchange,3db3nf,Stuckwithme39,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:03:47 2015 UTC,"Umm I have no idea, maybe $7 if it's still sealed. I have to check, but if I opened it and swatched then I'll knock it down to $6. And that would be including shipping within the U.S."
makeupexchange,3db3nf,Dreamer143777,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:04:32 2015 UTC,Keep me posted if you have it and whether it's swatched; $6-7 seems fair.
