So all you really need is the extended cut of 25 and then 26 to get anything of substance from that feature. I'm not sure if those are available for streaming legally, but I do know that after many months, Sentai is finally releasing the subbed blu-rays of the series this fall.  TLDR: Don't bother with Factor of Hope, find the proper episodes 25 & 26 for the true end"

persona4golden,3c31vr,stordoff,2,Sat Jul 4 15:37:27 2015 UTC,"The only reason why you should ever switch to a higher level Persona is to access better skills for the later parts of the game. However, if you have skill cards, you can absolutely use a lower level Persona if you have buffed out its stats. Even then, if a Persona has a high enough strength/magic even the lower level skills can do massive damage."

persona4golden,3bzum4,artyon,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:48:18 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure a weakness always stays a weakness.
persona4golden,3bzum4,TsundereKermit,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:24:12 2015 UTC,If a persona has a weakness to an element without the help of a passive skill negating it (resist/null/repel/absorb _____) then it will become weak to it again when you're hit by a break skill It won't be neutral to whatever it's weak to.

persona4golden,3b8sn8,KingKyra,3,Fri Jun 26 23:04:00 2015 UTC,The only thing you need to do is choose the right answers at TV scene in the hospital. Adachi's s.link just gives an extra scene and potential bad ending. The rough idea to get the best ending in this game is always to assume you are missing something or still need to do something.  Hospital choices below if you need them: Any Option; Wait a second here; We're missing something; Namatame's true feelings; Something's bothering me; We're missing something; Calm the hell down!

But here is some small advice, note I'm no expert, and I'll keep this spoiler free:   Always complete each dungeon twice.  A point will come where the game suggests you save your game because shit is about to go down. Save in a different slot. And maybe a few different slots after.  Perhaps it's possible to max out all the S Links in one play through, but I haven't managed to do it.. Stick to the people you like. Get them to level 10. You'll be fine.  Lastly, I thought this was an excellent (and spoiler-free) guide to the true ending, but I only read it AFTER I saw the credits for the first time. It's very much spoiler-free, but the true ending is your ending, going back for the extra content is easy after you get that and have another save."

Not a great support character (true persona does a skill which blocks all damage to the party once for a cost of 160SP), but capable of dealing any type of damage you need."
persona4golden,3a68j5,stordoff,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:40:20 2015 UTC,"Any party can work, but I usually stick with P4MC/Yukiko/Yosuke/Chie.  I'd definitely keep Yukiko. She can deal SEVERE fire damage to all once you reach her true persona (max slink then talk to her in January), which coupled with Mind Charge (fifth bike skill) deals pretty intense damage. Full heal to all is handy as well.  Yosuke is pretty flexible, so I usually stick with him. Decent support skills, great wind/phys damage, and can heal if you really need it.  TBH, pretty much anyone can work as the fourth member. The only stand-out skill is Chie's Dragon Hustle, which she can't get until January (before that, she just deals great phys damage and mediocre ice damage). AFAIK, it is the best support skill in the game - att/def/hit up for the entire party. Costly at 150SP, but really useful for bosses."
persona4golden,3a5itl,Tiwe,5,Wed Jun 17 11:46:05 2015 UTC,"The point of the true ending is that even in victory, you never totally become complacent and keep searching for the truth. Especially when questions have been left unanswered.   The flags for the ending are left purposely vague to test the player on their resolve when complacency takes hold. Just another aspect of the devs really going all out with their themes"
persona4golden,3a5itl,LX_Theo,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:35:33 2015 UTC,"The main flag for the true ending stuff is very vague. The only real thing to remember is that when you first enter Inaba and shake the attendant's hand that's when something happens (I believe on the vanilla version the controller shakes too).  It's a small thing, but apparently you're supposed to remember it. Getting there is a different story. It's like the game really doesn't want you to get it. Whether that's a good thing or bad thing who knows."

Make the first playthrough your personal adventure, then you have a reason to do 100% on NG+"

I was looking at this guide but I was a bit confused as to how exactly I accomplish it. Do I ~only~ need to max out Marie's S.Link, and not do any of the previous steps mentioned in True ending and below? And does the Golden ending include the True ending as well?"
persona4golden,396pu4,MdnightSailor,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:11:07 2015 UTC,The golden ending is the true ending + an epilogue.
persona4golden,396pu4,LX_Theo,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:33:24 2015 UTC,True ending requires no effort besides the moments of instigating it. Golden ending is just an epilogue added when you've completed Marie's new content.
persona4golden,396pu4,LX_Theo,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:44:59 2015 UTC,Does it not require jester at level 6+ as well?
persona4golden,396pu4,AndyF1996,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:55:28 2015 UTC,"No, it doesn't. That provides an optional bonus scene down the line, though."
persona4golden,396pu4,fly19,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:00:57 2015 UTC,"basically if you fulfil the true ending conditions, you get the true ending, and if you do those and Marie's s link you get the golden ending, which is basically the true ending with a little extra content.  Basically the reason I mentioned Marie specifically is that she's the only missable ending condition, everything else is dialogue choices in particular points, which the game will warn you about and you'll immediately know if you got it right."
persona4golden,396pu4,MdnightSailor,2,Tue Jun 9 20:15:45 2015 UTC,"Unless you follow a walkthrough or get extremely lucky, you're not going to 100% your first run. Besides, it's supposed to be a personalized game -- this is your year and nobody else's. Your experience is defined through both the things you find and the things you missed. I live the organic feel of it, so for me, starting over because I did something ""wrong"" feels inorganic and contrary to the game's tone.  Just view the stuff you missed as incentive to come back to if and when you start another playthrough."

She's almost always separate from the investigation team.  I would have liked her better if she was more involved with the investigation team, maybe even as a member but not as a party member, just someone who goes with you through the dungeons and all that.   As others have said though, don't ignore her unless you want to get the best ending, you'll regret it big time."

Anybody classified as having the same type of personality as Kagami Hiiragi is okay in my book.   I don't have any issues with her as a character. She has great development overall, and has several memorable moments in her interactions with the main cast. She works brilliantly in Persona Q, as well.  My only issue with her is how much the game itself starts to revolve around her. I won't make any spoilers, but seeing the way the game's lore is changed because of her presence bothers me a little more than it should."

persona4golden,390dtw,OrientalOtter,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:20:51 2015 UTC,"She's fine, but her forced importance in an already complex story really hurts her and the game. Though, like everyone has said, the golden ending is quite cute. Picture it like this, Persona4 is like a pancake with syrup, perfectly fine. Marie comes in and suddenly you got a pancake buried in syrup,  mounds whipped cream, strawberries and powdered sugar. It becomes too much. She didn't need to be as important as she was made to be and overcomplicate an already delicious pancake"

Now just either make the character a Tsundere, extremely flirty if male, or have an obsession with food and you've made the same character made a thousand times."
persona4golden,38x0x7,marmaladebrat,6,Sun Jun 7 15:45:58 2015 UTC,"Definitely FES. It's the best (and cannon)  experience. P3p is nice, and it has some good additions, but the female protagonist isn't cannon and you don't get the answer which is a whole other part of the game you can only get from FES and it's kind of important for later games"
persona4golden,38x0x7,Palinomana,3,Mon Jun 8 02:14:35 2015 UTC,"First, a warning. No matter what you go back to it'll be hard to adjust. 4 is a vastly better game than 3, at least in design respects. I'd go with Portable, because they change some things that make it a much better game than the console. For one, you can actually control your other party members, unlike in 3 on the console, where they were AI controlled, which was infuriating. Again, playing 3 after 4 is going to be a bit like taking a step back, so be warned."
persona4golden,38x0x7,Qwencex,3,Sun Jun 7 18:52:07 2015 UTC,"I haven't played FES but here's what I liked about P3P:  -It's on a handheld. It's easier to pick up and play whenever I feel like it. -Having control over party members -The fast-travel menu -Voiced dialogue in the last party SLink ranks, it added a lot more emotions to these important scenes. -The female protagonist is a really nice and different experience. I preferred to choose her for the NG+ though since it has many references to the male storyline. -I recently heard P3P included some important dungeon rebalancing. -The tired-mechanic is much less restrictive.  At first the lack of cutscenes worried me since I absolutely loved them in Golden. But after finishing P3P and watching them on YT I realized they were pretty awful. I'd maybe recommend watching the opening cutscene when starting since it's the best of them, it gives a better first impression and sets the mood better.  The lack of 3D models didn't bother me. I actually liked that I was able to navigate the map more fluidly and faster than even in Golden. To me the dialogue sprites were enough but I could see it bothering some players."
persona4golden,38x0x7,Shaedana,4,Sun Jun 7 16:26:38 2015 UTC,"It's fairly subjective, so I'll try and list the main differences. Personally, I thought P3P (with the female MC) was a much more enjoyable experience, but P3FES is still an amazing game.  P3P was streamlined compared to FES, so you lose the anime cutscenes, and you don't walk around overworld areas. It's more like a menu than a world (you still see the world, but select locations with a cursor rather than walking up to them. It doesn't sound great, but it works fine and is a little faster). Dungeons and battles are still 3D, same as FES just with the graphics downgraded a touch.   The bigger changes are in the combat system. In FES, you only control Main Character and set tactics for other party members. It adds a interesting degree of strategy to battles, as you need to predict what your party will do, but wiping due to dumb AI choices is never fun (doesn't happen often, but it can). The P3P battle system is basically the same as P4G. Equipment menus in P3P are improved over FES - IIRC in FES you have to go up to each person to change their equipment; in P3P you can just do it from the menus like in P4G. It's a much less fustrating way to do it.  One difference that seems minor, but may annoy you if you've played P4G, is that in FES a ma- spell must hit all targets to get 1-more attack, so the AI will usually cast individual target spells and burn a ton of SP. In P3P/P4G, a ma- spell only needs to hit one target to get 1-more attack. SP management is also a little different between the games - in FES, you can return to the enternce and get full party HP/SP for free, but you get tired if you spent too long in the dungeon (hit percent and damage does down, you take crits far more often etc.). In P3P, you don't get tired (I think the system is still in the game, but I don't remember it ever being an issue), but you have to pay to restore SP (same as Fox basically)  The biggest change (and IMO the best) is that P3P adds a Female main character. The story is the same, but some conversations are changed and you get an almost completely different set of s.links. For me, this is what made P3P a better game - the female s.links are more enjoyable, and you now get an s.link with all of your party members (you don't in P3FES). You can still choose the Male main character in P3P, and the s.links are the same AFAIK as in FES. The Female route also allows you to choose a new velvet room assistant (Theodore), who is not in P3FES, and I think he is great character.  There is also a difference in content between P3P and FES. FES includes The Answer (Episode Aegis in Japan), which is a fairly lengthy segment set after the main game. I haven't played it myself yet, but from what I've read, it is about 30hrs long and focuses more on combat than the main game. I've seen a fair number of comments that recommend just playthrough of this or the cutscenes online. P3P does not include The Answer, but does include the Vision Quest - a set of harder, almost puzzle-like versions of the bosses from the main game. Beating them unlocks a secret boss battle with a familar character.  Cameo spoiler for P3P: The Female route for P3P also includes a brief field trip to Inaba for a sports event, where you meet a younger Yukiko"
persona4golden,38x0x7,stordoff,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:33:16 2015 UTC,Thanks for the comments and recommendations everyone. I'm leaning more towards the P3P experience after all your comments. I still have a little time to decide. Thanks again!

persona4golden,38cvhx,Shaedana,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:31:25 2015 UTC,That's the biggest debate of the Persona community :P I have only played Portable so take my word with a grain of salt.   P3P is more similar to Golden so it might be an easier transition. In FES from what I've heard it can be aggrevating not to have control over your party. The cutscenes aren't that great IMO so them being cut from P3P isn't as big of a deal. The movies are now coming out and look infinitely better.  I'd say play FES if you care about 3D charactermodels and world. Choose Portable for smoother gameplay experience and if the visual novel-ish style isn't an issue.  Either way FES has an epilogue which isn't in Portable but since you can directly start with it you can just continue to it no matter which main game you choose. (Also recommended option to watch it from Youtube)
persona4golden,38cvhx,dualstrike98,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:02:47 2015 UTC,"the epilogue is not that fun to play, the only reason i powered through it was for the story. Regardless of picking P3P or P3FES, just watch the epilogue on youtube"

I played 4 first and it became my favorite game of all time, though I did love it from the beginning. Maybe it's just not your cup of tea? You can give 3 a try but it isn't anything similar story wise to 4. Which may be a good thing for you. I'd keep at it a bit longer on 4, though! The story really is riveting. I'm currently on my third play through of the game. Just can't get enough!"
persona4golden,38frss,nubcakefactoryy,2,Wed Jun 3 22:56:16 2015 UTC,I'll keep going!
persona4golden,38frss,DateMasamune2,4,Thu Jun 4 12:35:50 2015 UTC,You're still in the 'recruiting party members' stage of the game. Wait until after the next dungeon and if you still don't like it then - it's probably not your type of game.
persona4golden,38frss,kacboy,2,Thu Jun 4 01:14:36 2015 UTC,I'll push along. It should be my type of game which is funny. It checks off everything I want in a game but I will most certainly keep going.

persona4golden,38frss,TeamDogfight,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:33:46 2015 UTC,"Persona games are more about the characters than the actual plot. That said there is more going on and more mystery behind P3. But.. If you're not interested about the characters and their developement I'm still not sure if you'd like it.  I personally dislike how thin P4's plot is but I appreciate its atmosphere and I really felt like I had a good time with dear friends.  I like P3 better but what I like is the overall theme of the game and how everything in the game ties into the theme so nicely. There is a theme in P4 as well but it's not as well presented and thought-provoking.  TLDR: These games are slice-of-life genre focusing on characters, themes and emotional attachment, not ""plot""."
persona4golden,38frss,Shaedana,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:36:20 2015 UTC,"Definitely keep playing. Persona 4's story doesn't really spice up until you have more clues as to who the killer is. The difference between Persona 3 and Persona 4 is that, although both stories have roughly a month in between actual plot development arcs, Persona 4's social links are actually interesting and in most cases have benefits (party members, especiall). Persona 3's social links just feel distant from the main story, and it makes that in-game month of waiting for the next plot development all the more boring."
persona4golden,38frss,TeamDogfight,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:38:51 2015 UTC,"Huh, really? IMO P4 SLinks were mostly eating food with X person and then the final ranks had some actual developement.

persona4golden,38frss,Brittany_Delirium,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:30:47 2015 UTC,"Well, the party members' social links were interesting at the very least. Getting bonus skills from even-numbered ranks is also a good enough reason to max them out. Not to mention the fact that only the female protagonist of Persona 3 has a social link with every member of her party (male protagonist only gets the four female party members)."

I believe it was due to the fact that there were issues getting a lot of the voice acting cast, which is why Margaret for example has many lines by an obviously different voice actress, which is why they tried to minimise new recordings. The game is still coded to lower the music, and is probably still attempting to play a sound file which is not there. Slightly lazy on the localisation team's part, but there you are."

Light/dark attacks are one-shot abilities and you can't one-shot bosses/minibosses.  Generally P4 is a very easy game. You just need to get used to the mechanics. Also arguably Yukiko and the optional boss after her are the most difficult encounters in the game."
persona4golden,3728s6,Shaedana,1 point,Sun May 24 11:29:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so far it really hasn't been hard. I just didn't leave myself enough time to grind in the castle. I'll have to try out Senri, thanks for the tip!"
persona4golden,3728s6,Shaedana,1 point,Sun May 24 18:17:32 2015 UTC,Here's a bit of an update. I was able to grind for an hour up to level 15 (all party members) and basically use physical attacks to chip away at the boss. The Senri tip was amazing! I happened to get one from the cards and it is probably the main reason I was able to beat her. THANK YOU! You basically saved me hours of game play.
persona4golden,3728s6,Goetia__,2,Sun May 24 21:40:37 2015 UTC,"There's going to be an optional boss in the dungeon after the saved person returns to school. If you beat these bosses you'll get a strong weapon or item and courage stat increase. Also since you'll have to climb the floors again it'll give you a handy headstart to grind for the next dungeon. Story bosses are ten levels apart from each other, starting from Yukiko's lvl15.  Like I said the optional boss in the castle is exceptionally difficult and after trying it few times you might want to return to it later after getting a bit stronger. I don't think grinding for it is worth the effort since it basically randomly one-shots your party.  Also talk to Yosuke inside the TV and ask to go to the liquor store. There's no optional boss but the extra item is laying on the floor."
persona4golden,3728s6,Goetia__,1 point,Mon May 25 03:31:27 2015 UTC,I have tried to boss and it has one hit me every turn. I'll keep giving it a go if I get a cool item though. Also thank you for the tip on the liquor store. I had no idea about that.

persona4golden,35r3lf,rhapsodyinawesome,3,Wed May 13 14:54:15 2015 UTC,"Potential spoilers ahead! There are quite a LOT of extra things in Golden. Nothing that changes the core gameplay, but a lot of things that add up to make the experience on the Vita just that much better. It is definitely worth investing in the Vita version.  If you want a cheaper option, get a Vita TV, a PS3 gamepad, and the game and you're good to go (if you have a TV). In the UK that'd cost about £70 maybe overall, compared to about £170 for the console and the game new. Anyway, on with the differences:  Shamelessly ripped from the here.   Two new Social Links. Both Social Links are capable of unlocking new story content — such as new dungeons, and additional scenes for every ending.   Marie, a Persona 4 Golden exclusive character, of the Aeon Arcana. Tohru Adachi, of the Jester Arcana and the Hunger Arcana.  New Difficulty levels similar to Persona 3 Portable. On New Game+, the player can change and even customize the difficulty levels for individual game elements in the configuration menu. The pre-set levels of difficulty are:   Safety (Very Easy in NA Version) Easy (Left untouched in NA Version, used to be called Beginner) Normal Hard (Left untouched in NA Version, used to be Expert) Risky (Very Hard in NA Version)  Several new music tracks. Additional voice over dialogue. Chie and Teddie have new voices in the English versions. New animated cutscenes. More Personas, including new Ultimate Personas for the Investigation Team. New areas, such as Shichiri Beach, and a ski resort. Okina City, which was only seen during certain Social Link scenes, is now accessible. New events, such as a Halloween event and a skiing trip. The player can now explore Inaba in the evening, when Dojima is not home. Places to visit are limited, just like Persona 3. Yu and his friends now have motorized scooters to explore various areas. Costumes are now available to buy at Croco Fur, in Okina City. Costumes have their own slot for equipment, and affects the Investigation Team's appearance, similar to Persona 3 FES and Persona 3 Portable. Costumes do not affect the party's stats. New Garden and Bug Catching features. Trophies. The ability to choose which skills can be inherited by the persona the player is fusing. (However inheritance restriction still applies.) The Vox Populi (Voice of the People) and SOS are new additions to the game, available while connected to the PlayStation Network.   The Vox Populi can be used to see what other players of Persona 4 Golden have chosen to do during the current day in the game. The feature is also available in the Velvet Room to see what personas other players are currently fusing. The SOS feature calls other online players for help in dungeons, allows you to send help to others, and is received as a gift of a minor amount of health and spirit. The amount restored by the SOS is very little and isn't restricted by the current health status of your party.  New scene skipping function. If the player fulfills criteria for at least the good ending, daily activities are expanded to February 14, 2012, giving more time for events and social links. New epilogue for the True Ending. Changes to the requests of NPCs or the fox. Some changes to the flow of battle:   Some shadows/enemies have changed their attribute (weakness/strength/null) or area spawn. Shuffle Time has been revised. Rebalanced characters. Rise can now assist the Investigation Team in All-Out-Attacks. Tag Team attacks. Cavalry Attacks: Attacks from members of the Investigation Team that are not currently in the party.

persona4golden,35r3lf,Makoto_Narukami,1 point,Wed May 13 04:43:48 2015 UTC,"Golden is definitely better in terms of features and accessibility. They improved on all features. They added new events that you and your gang/group participates in. Which is nice as you will come to really like the characters, so seeing them in more social events is always fun. But story wise, I personally preferred Persona 4 over golden. I really dislike the new character.(Marie) But then again if you are only going to pick one, it's definitely golden. No question."
persona4golden,35r3lf,-SapuMilgauss,1 point,Wed May 13 17:01:30 2015 UTC,"Golden basically adds a few more story things, most of which aren't that great, and makes the game even easier than it already is. P4G pretty much shoves power down your throat and trivializes even its own character progression mechanic.  I'd play P3 FES before you jump into 4, if at all possible. It's a bit harder to go back to P3 from 4, even if 3 is the better game. Because it's a fair bit darker than P4, you'll also be a little bit more inclined to play mainline Shin Megami Tensei if you play 3 first. You'll want to do that, because staying in any one part of the MegaTen franchise is the worst thing you can do since they're all fantastic.  Also, P2 Innocent Sin isn't that fun from what I played, but the story is definitely worth it. It's a piss easy game by any standard, but because of that even bosses can be defeated with auto-battle. I hear the second half, Eternal Punishment, is a fair bit better in that respect."
persona4golden,35nzo5,FaithOfOurFathers,4,Tue May 12 01:42:32 2015 UTC,Platinum the game.  Fight the hidden bonus boss.  Stand in awe of its regality.  Pull your hair out figuring out how to beat it.

persona4golden,35nzo5,Grizzly_Storm,1 point,Tue May 12 04:17:44 2015 UTC,"Cheap enough where both are reasonable. P3p loses cut scenes, the answer and a full over world like p4, replaced by a point and click interface.  Instead you get some additional events, fully controllable party (ps2 is AI only) and female lead.  The Answer is great story wise, blah gameplay wise.  Just watch a YouTube video."
persona4golden,35nzo5,ArtificiallyIsolated,1 point,Tue May 12 04:48:07 2015 UTC,"Is the answer a bonus story or is it an add on to the regular story? I'd hate to get something that has less story, as that's my fave part of p4g."
persona4golden,35nzo5,Grizzly_Storm,1 point,Tue May 12 11:20:39 2015 UTC,"In Persona 3 FES there are two stories. The first story is ""The Journey"" and that's the main story that was also in the original Persona 3.   The second story is ""The Answer"" and that takes place after The Journey and is also canon just like the first story. You could say it's an epilogue that gives you answers to a bunch of questions you might have after playing The Journey.   Persona 3 is very good storywise, though it is a little bit darker than Persona 4. The TV world with its bright and colourful aesthetic doesn't exist, you will be taking on shadows during the dark hour."

persona4golden,35nzo5,JancariusSeiryujinn,1 point,Tue May 12 14:24:08 2015 UTC,"That's right. P3P doesn't have the answer, but it does have some improved combat and the option to play as Female MC, who has social links and dialogue choices all her own."
persona4golden,35nzo5,sneauxoui,1 point,Tue May 12 23:39:08 2015 UTC,"However, it's also worth noting that despite the female protagonist having a rather good story and social links as well as her own soundtracks, she is not canon like The Answer is.  So, I would prioritise the canon material such as the main male protagonist storyline and then watch The Answer on Youtube if you can't play through it.   If you want a fun what-if story that isn't canon but is still pretty good and you have time, play the female protagonist story in P3P.  After playing everything Persona 3 has to offer and if you don't mind fighting games, you could play Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, which is a sequel to Persona 4 Arena. You can get the DLC for the story of P4A, so that you don't have to buy the original.   Despite being fighting games they are canon to the overall P3 and P4 storyline, then there's Persona 4 Dancing All Night, which isn't out yet but is also confirmed to be canon.   Of course, I don't know how important they will be for the future of Persona considering they are canon spin-offs, but they do introduce new characters to the series. The spin-offs tend to take place during Spoiler"
persona4golden,35nzo5,kacboy,1 point,Wed May 13 15:37:15 2015 UTC,"So I'm gonna jump on this thread to advise if you play P4G you should go with P3P over P3FES.   Coming from Golden, you'll find P3P much more comfortable as a transition.   The direct commands beat the hell out of having the AI spam a useless ability (Mitsuru and Marin Karin is probably the most notorious), and let me recommend the girl route over the male route so much."
persona4golden,35nzo5,kacboy,1 point,Tue May 12 14:18:07 2015 UTC,"My only gripe is if the portable version doesn't have ""The answer"" as that'd be a big factor in my decision."

persona4golden,35dcjz,Throwawaylikeits1992,9,Sat May 9 05:39:56 2015 UTC,"My experience with the persona series started with Golden. I impulsively bought a PS Vita and this game and just did a blind play through.   Honestly, its best that way.   Don't worry about prioritizing your time, that doesn't matter unless you're trying to 100% complete the game, which is near impossible on your first play through unless you use a walkthrough.   My best advice would be this:  1) Have fun with the game - I spent my time being an introvert in the game. I started dating a girl and spent every possible day with her (even when it made me repeat things) I wasted countless days on that because I wanted to play the game like I would if I were really in this situation.  Basically do whatever makes you happy. Even after all I did, I still obtained the true ending.  2) Pick your difficulty wisely - if you're worried about not having fun and having to do tons of level grinding then pick a lower difficulty. I played on normal and it was perfect for me,there were three times in the game I had to level grind in order to proceed with the game. Besides that I played it through without trouble.  3) Try not to look up info on the game online - your first play through is a special one, try to avoid spoilers at all cost. It'll make the game so much better!   That's really the best I can offer you, I've beaten Golden then went on to beat Persona 3 and Persona 4 Arena. I'm currently playing Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, Persona Q and I've even branched out to other Atlus games like Catherine and Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor 2 Record Breaker (it just came out like 3 days ago).   Ask me anything if you need advice! Have fun!"
persona4golden,35dcjz,chrisx8x23x95,6,Sat May 9 06:20:54 2015 UTC,"Also, and this may seem odd, but don't look at Hentai of the game. I was reading a doujin and it spoilered the hell out of the identity of the killer"
persona4golden,35dcjz,JancariusSeiryujinn,2,Sat May 9 14:33:45 2015 UTC,Oh god that must be the worst. The best advice is go dark from the internet while playing this game.
persona4golden,35dcjz,chrisx8x23x95,3,Sat May 9 14:38:57 2015 UTC,"This is probably a stupid question but is dungeon crawling important?  So far I really just like socializing and hearing the characters talk, they all have wonderful personalities so far and I would love it if the game was nothing more than just banter between characters."
persona4golden,35dcjz,chrisx8x23x95,2,Sun May 10 06:40:54 2015 UTC,"Its needed to advance the game, however if you play on the lowest difficulty it'll be like nothing :P pick what works best for you, difficulty makes the game!"
persona4golden,35dcjz,Liquidje,2,Sun May 10 14:11:34 2015 UTC,"I did exactly this, and I would recommend the same. The game never felt hardcore and is not too grindy if you do the side quests.   The only sidenote I have to make is to be on your guard for extra/golden/true endings and all that stuff. I would definitely look that up online (search for ""ending guide spoilerfree""), in P4G I almost had the bad ending AND overwritten my save."
persona4golden,35dcjz,sneauxoui,2,Sat May 9 13:51:34 2015 UTC,"Time limits are strict.  You have some flexibility but not a lot.  Social links generally do not advance at night.  Your social link options are limited when it rains, use this time to build up your characteristics.  Study for the exams, those are a big help.    Your characteristics need to be at certain levels to access certain social links.    Never go straight to sleep.  Take into consideration the tarot symbol of your social link, that tends to reflect their personality.    Grind your way through the dungeon as best as possible. I like to get it done all in one go.  Fusing personas is easier than trying to level up a persona.  Be very sparing with your mp restoring items.  Buffs and debuffs are very important in this game.  Hope that helps!"
persona4golden,35dcjz,SombreroOnAFlea,2,Sat May 9 06:15:36 2015 UTC,"My advice would be just play it and enjoy it without using any guides (for your first playthrough, anyway).  The game is very forgiving and you always get a lot of advance warning about when you're running out of days to do something, so don't worry about that.  You can spend your in-game time doing whatever you want, it won't really affect the outcome of the game. There are a couple extra boss fights and alternate endings that depend on certain social links, but you can save those for the second playthrough.  When you get to November/December, start saving in multiple slots."
persona4golden,35dcjz,rhapsodyinawesome,1 point,Sun May 10 04:48:36 2015 UTC,"The games are absurdly easy, just do what you feel like you should be doing as you go and you'll be fine. Focus on a handful of social links, defeat enemies as you see them, fuse purse owners often, and you'll be fine."
persona4golden,35dcjz,Elance777,1 point,Tue May 12 18:19:02 2015 UTC,"My advice would be to never assume that you need 100% the  game on your first play through. Maxing out your Social Links and getting every single Persona in the game, are fun goals to have while playing, but should never be tackled on your first go. Finally like most others have said, it's your play through, do what you want to do."
persona4golden,35dcjz,PlushSandyoso,1 point,Fri May 15 00:12:35 2015 UTC,"Want to stress this point.  You can't do it on your first go anyway since you need to be on a newgame+ file to access the true ending.  Just do what you want.  I will say, however, that social links with party members will give them additional abilities. You may want to give them extra attention because of it."
persona4golden,35dcjz,Qwencex,1 point,Fri May 15 18:08:57 2015 UTC,"Social links social links social links social links. The majority of Persona is preparation for the next boss fight, and Social Links are a major factor in that. You can be a super high level, but without powerful personas your get you rasa handed to you time and again. Don't exhaust yourself gouging to the dungeon. Once should be enough, twice at most if you pace yourself. Spend most of your time leveling up SL and your IRL Stats-Charm, Academics, Etc."

So yes, you need to max the social link. However, if you're on New Game+ and happened to max their social link in a previous playthrough, then you can still fuse the persona as long as you're a high enough level since the item needed to do it carries over.

I find it's easiest to accomplish this with Scathach and Michael, and strangely, their stats and spells between 3 and 4 give them pretty easy access to doing this.  In P3P, even with my 100% compendium, I still use my 4-dyne Scathach. Of course, P3P made it really easy to boost stats with cards, so even though she's level 88 or so, she's full 99's all the way through.   When I NG+ that again, I'll farm enough jewels to get my Michael up there too. I usually try to make him a bit more interesting.   So I usually like those two, but it has nothing to do with the designs or lore behind them. I just find them to be all-around slaughterers."

What you want to do is use buffs and debuffs against Kunino Sagiri (and every other boss). The only way to prevent Control from taking over every member is to get to his final 'phase' before he takes over everyone. His final phase is where he uses a heavy Almighty attack called ""Unerring Justice"", and it can get messy if you aren't prepared. If he DOES manage to take control to everyone, just pray that they don't kill you. Control lasts for only 2 turns if I remember correctly.  Also, you should be about Level 65 for this fight. If you're level 64, I'd honestly recommend just leveling up one more time. One level makes a huge difference in all Shin Megami Tensei games."
persona4golden,33l7bt,MoogleBoys,1 point,Thu Apr 23 13:49:42 2015 UTC,"Grind up to about level 60-65, get personas that reflect elements or have mararakarn (magical barrier). When he uses his attack that changes the environment, the spell that he uses is the one spell that he's weak to, and all other spells do hardly anything, so say he's using wind spells, switch to a persona that reflects wind.

persona4golden,33l7bt,chiggennugget,1 point,Thu Apr 23 23:13:08 2015 UTC,"If you don't have one already, make sure to have a persona that at least nulls physical attacks. Kin-Ki of the chariot arcana is the most common suggestion for this fight. I suggest him a lot, but Rangda of the magician arcana can learn the skill repel physical, which you can then pass on to another persona and make almost any persona 10 times more durable.  You could also use the persona Tam-Lin of the sun arcana and carry enduring soul (revives you with full HP one time if you are killed in battle) to just get through the control phase.  Third, it's helpful to have personas that at least null (though repeling or absorbing is incredibly helpful here) the respective element they use.  if you have them, use magic mirrors/makarakarn when he uses quad converge to deflect some of those attacks. It's been my experience that he uses makara break or spirit leech whenever you use makarakarn when quad converge isn't in effect, so be wary."

The only thing Adachi's social link does is add to certain in-game scenes, and adds its own scenes.

If you want to revert a week or two (that is, if you have a save game from that time) you can use this guide to see the days that he is available.  Be aware that you need to do something more to get him past social link level 8 later in the game, even though this is not necessary for getting neither the True nor Golden Ending.

Plot-wise, both games are completely separate, save for a few references. You'll definitely be able to appreciate P4G's gameplay more if you play through P3P first. Although my first Persona game was P4G, I'd still say I prefer Persona 3. It's a matter of preference, but I think P3P should be the first game you play. Have fun!"
persona4golden,32na59,Byahku,2,Wed Apr 15 04:41:40 2015 UTC,"This definitely. Though you won't miss out on information vital to the story of P4G you will miss out on an excellent game which, due to the upgrades of P4G, won't feel as great to play if you play P4G first. P3P is easy to grab on a Vita and you can jump right in and play that one then P4G. It'll be worth it. They're both excellent games."
persona4golden,32na59,Jepotle,2,Wed Apr 15 16:57:18 2015 UTC,"You're not going to miss anything. Each game has its own individual storyline, so you can really start at any point in the series without missing any details."
persona4golden,32na59,lexitome,2,Wed Apr 15 04:39:31 2015 UTC,It might be a bit harder to go back to to Persona 3 after playing Golden since the gameplay and pacing is a bit more clunky.   However P4G is more endearing for a new player to get sucked in. P3P is darker and the situation feels more dire and serious. Golden has some heavy moments but focuses on having fun with your friends. Personally I am glad I played P3P after Golden since it would've set my expectations for Golden on a completely different level and I might not have enjoyed the lighter tone as much.
persona4golden,32na59,Shaedana,2,Wed Apr 15 07:56:12 2015 UTC,So I WAS going to start with P3P but I couldn't pass up $17 for a used copy of P4G so I'm probably going to be starting that tonight!

Without a ps2 or ps3 you can't play Persona 3 fes, which sucks, but you can play Persona 3 portable on Vita through the PlayStation store.   Should you start with p4g? Absolutely. Other than running themes and gags, you won't miss much. It's a great game, and the community will help you with any questions you might have. I highly recommend not using a guide for your first playthrough. Just let whatever happens happen. You'll enjoy it more, trust me. On your second playthrough look up some spoiler free guides.

It also has 2 protagonists with some different events and dialogue too, so that's nice.  FES has an extra after-game story, but it probably isn't worth the effort to play it. I've heard it's extremely grind-heavy, so IMO P3P is the best way to go."

persona4golden,32hav8,AlienWarhead,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:03:11 2015 UTC,"P3P has 2 routes, male and female. They differ a little in dialogue, some story events and social links, plus each one has different music,  so NG+ is fresh.  It has direct commands as an option (FES does not) which allows you to pick your party member's move for that turn.  FES has 'the answer' which expands the story by a bit. (P3P doesn't) It is grind heavy and you're probably better off watching the cut scenes on YouTube or something. It only has the male MC too.   There may be other minor differences, but those are the only ones that would matter at all.  Edit: grammar"

You can just look up the answer cutscenes on YouTube, you could also look up the Persona 3 FES cutscenes too. P3P doesn't have anime cutscenes instead what happened is explained through visual novel or in engine cutscene format, but of course watching the cutscenes will spoil you."

persona4golden,32hav8,OBMSIA,1 point,Thu Apr 16 19:33:06 2015 UTC,"Having played both FES and P3P, I feel that P3P is the better value. You miss the animated cutscenes (they're done with stills in P3P so that it could all fit on a single UMD), you miss The Answer, and instead of walking around the environments in town, it's reverted to selecting locations from a menu.   I'd agree with what other posters have said -- watch The Answer's cutscenes on Youtube. It's 90% grinding, and doesn't add all that much.   One thing that others haven't directly stated is that the female route of P3P is a vastly different game. If I had to guess, without looking up the exact numbers, I'd say that at least 50% of the social links are brand new, and the social links that did exist in the male route are altered drastically. Instead of only having social links with the female team members (in the male route), you have social links with all team members, giving much-welcome depth to the male characters on the team. Thus, it's a vastly different game, and while it follows the same story path, it's an absolute delight to play through. If you want something closer to the original P3 experience, I'd suggest playing the male route first, and using the female route as a New Game + (since you'll be playing the second time to mainly see the story differences, you can focus on that instead of having to level like crazy, since the weapons and persona compendium carry over, taking out most of the challenge until end-game. Thus, you can spend less time in dungeons and more in social links.   P3P also lets you control all your party members, which I vastly prefer. Only controlling the MC in FES was fine, and the AI isn't as bad as some would lead you to believe, but I prefer full control when I have the option, so P3P is by far a better value. I haven't wanted to play FES since completing The Journey and The Answer, but I've replayed P3P multiple times on each route.  For me, it's not even a question, but you may find that you want the FULL experience, which means you may end up playing both routes in P3P and decide you want to experience the answer, too.   The good thing is that no matter which you choose, you'll be getting an excellent game. You really can't go wrong with either choice."

Chie's social link is a favorite of mine because I love her attitude and beating the shit out of bullies is an extra bonus.  The hanged man is my favorite arcana in tarot and, as with Kanji and Naoto, I get where Naoki is coming from with the struggle of coping with a difficult situation, but not wanting everyone to strip your identity down to that single struggle. My main and favorite persona is also of the hanged Man arcana, so his link is welcome for me.  From persona 3, I liked the magician (w/ Junpei), empress, justice (/w Ken Amada...I can't stand Chihiro), strength (Koromaru obviously, no explanation needed), hanged man, tower, star (/w Akihiko.

persona4golden,32084b,PikaJaune,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:37:47 2015 UTC,What is the reasons you prefer p3p? the ruined exploration alone made me sell the game. =/ I don't like using a cursor at all.

I like the FeMC as well as the different social links. I'll admit that I miss the cutscenes, but the 'graphic novel' style makes up for it for me. This goes without saying, but the combat system is obviously better.  I just wish they could put P3P and FES into one game, but that's not going to happen :c"

It's just i love walking around on P4G, i never use the menu to go from shopping district south to north... so i'm wondering if i should just play fes or get p3p on vita, i love playing while laying down on my couch x) so i don't know..

persona4golden,31ylia,Myalko,3,Thu Apr 9 04:41:51 2015 UTC,"I'd say hitmonlee, meinshao or medicham for chie because they use kicking moves. Machop/Machamp focus on karate chopping and punching.

On days you want to hang with Adachi, just spend your afternoon raising your stats at Aiya. You can find him in front of the gas station at night. Part of Adachi's S Link requires you to talk to him during the day at Junes sometimes.  Also, since you're playing on a Vita or a PSTV, I'd recommend playing P3P instead of FES for the sake of a slightly better battle interface and CONTROLLABLE TEAMMATES, but that's just my preference.

Besides, I prefer story over the battles and dungeons, and I usually play at the lowest or second lowest difficulty. (Unless its pokemon or fire emblem. Pokemon is too easy.)

persona4golden,31pp7z,TheAbomasnow,6,Tue Apr 7 04:30:33 2015 UTC,"Definitely go for the PS3. You'll be able to play all of the games you listed, and you'll also have access to two generations of games from the PS2 and PS3. Another advantage is that you don't have to pay for online multiplayer with the PS3, which means that you won't need to get PS+ in order to play online matches on P4A or GTA:O. PS3's are dirt cheap nowadays anyways, so you can always save up for a PS4 in the future when more games come out for it."
persona4golden,31pp7z,Byahku,2,Tue Apr 7 04:49:34 2015 UTC,"I had this same dilemma a week ago.   Do you want to get a PS3 and have access to all of the games you listed AND more? Or do you want yo have a PS4 and have access to only persona 5 with slightly better graphics than the PS3 version?  I see no reason to get a ps4 right now because its too much money with not enough games to justify a purchase. Of course maybe that will change somewhere down the line, however, the price will as well and it'll be a worthy investment.  Go for a PS3 dude. I did and I dont regret it, I have P4 Arena, Ultimax, P3 FES and P4 all on one system, and soon to have persona 5 on it.    EDIT: I got my used PS3 slim for $160 for the 160 GB version. You could get it way cheaper than I did if you hunt for deals!"

I hope it is, so I don't buy another overpriced Persona-machine. All I know is if P5 has even an extra soundtrack that is like 2 seconds long, or an extra minute of game play: I'm buying a PS4.  Not really but you catch my drift right?"
persona4golden,31pp7z,KingBatista,2,Tue Apr 7 23:17:40 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming Persona 5 will be optimized primarily for the PS3 rather than be optimized for the PS4 and downgrading it for PS3. Hopefully, any differences between the PS3 and PS4 versions will be purely graphical, seeing as how Persona 5 is most likely going to be the last big title released on the PS3. The gameplay clips shown in the trailer were taken from the PS3 version, and the graphics already seem pretty great, so I doubt there'd be much difference in the PS4 version anyways. (:"

persona4golden,303k11,mrd34th,3,Tue Mar 24 04:24:31 2015 UTC,"Persona is a spinoff of Shin Megami Tensei (of which, Nocturne is the third installment).  Persona 3 Portable has a very similar format to Persona 4 Golden, although since it was a PSP game, the 3d graphics are toned down in battle, and the animated cutscenes are removed in favor of VN style storyboards.  It's less than ideal, but the game is still incredible.  It also has an option to choose a non-canonical female protagonist route, which has a few different social links.  Nocturne is a different beast (or demon) entirely.  It focuses much more on the demon collection, fusion, exploration, survival and choices than character development. The characters and friends of the protagonist stand to represent different philosophies. You'll find that you have very few friends in the world.  Instead of getting Personas from shuffle time, you encounter demons in battle. You can then use different methods to contact them, and even have them join your party.  I prefer the Press-Turn battle system of Nocturne to the One-More in the later Persona games, but they have a similar game design.  You exploit weaknesses and get extra turns.  Buffs and debuffs are incredibly important (even more so than the Persona games).  The difficulty is much higher than that of P4G, and you have to deal with random encounters.  But the world put forth by Atlus for Nocturne is so incredible, oppressive, and lonely, it serves as a great contrast to something so bright and generally cheerful as P4G.  If you have a PS3, P3FES is available, and the presentation will look a lot more like P4G (although you can only indirectly control your teammates, I think it's worth the tradeoff).  Nocturne is also available on PSN.  It really depends on what you're looking to play next."

persona4golden,2zy2vf,The_Composer_,7,Mon Mar 23 00:30:27 2015 UTC,"Hmm... You get an important bit of story exclusive to golden by maxing it out but you don't need it for the true ending.  To get the true ending, when you finish saying goodbye to your maced social links on the last day, the game gives you a prompt to go home. Decline that and go to Junes. Try to go the food court, even when the UI says you have no reason to be there; keep trying and assert that you want to go to the food court. Once you do that, you're on the true ending path :D"

persona4golden,2zy2vf,Byahku,2,Mon Mar 23 04:25:04 2015 UTC,"I've certainly been in the same place as you, OP. I beat P4G for the first time last year. P4G was the first game that made me truly emotional. When I finally beat it and had to say goodbye to all my friends in Inaba, I legitimately shed tears. I've recently started playing P3P, and while it's great I haven't really connected with the setting and characters like I did in P4G. I know it'll sound stupid, but it still sometimes hurts to look at the game box and know that I'll likely never have such an amazing experience in gaming as I did on my first, blind playthrough. Persona 4 Golden is my favourite game of all time, hands down, and if I could relive those first magical moments I had playing it, I don't think I would. Even though I fell in love with the game and its characters, I feel as if maybe once was enough. Going back through the game, seeing the characters, hearing the music...it would make me too emotional. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's true. I think I've gone on long enough about my love for P4G. I'll stop now."
persona4golden,2zy2vf,JancariusSeiryujinn,3,Mon Mar 23 05:47:33 2015 UTC,"When i first finished P4G, i started a new game immediately and finished the game again with the same fun and feel than my first playthrough. The game is so long and with some many dialogue it's easy to go back after a while, every time i do a new game again it feel refreshing. When i started my new game after clearing the game for the first time the only difference was knowing who was the bad guy...I don't know how many time i finished P4G but i'm replaying the game right now after almost a year and I'm already at the end of the game in the month of December and i'm planning to replay the game again once i'm done. I never get tired of this game, there is so much going on in 1 playthrough with so many character... Like i said to me it always feel refreshing, my game file is now at 297 hrs 47m, and still having ton of fun and trying to get the last 2 trophies i'm missing to get platinum. :P (hopefully my english was not too bad :P )  I will never stop playing this game. :)  http://i.imgur.com/uszlt5c.jpg"
persona4golden,2zy2vf,Shaedana,2,Mon Mar 23 06:35:22 2015 UTC,You're almost supposed to feel a bit distant from your friends in P3 until the late game. P3 is more of an arc while in P4 you weirdly became BFFs instantly.  It's a matter of taste I guess but in hindsight I'm not as fond of the anime-tropyness of P4 after playing P3.   I recommend watching P3 movies after your first playthrough. They convey this character growth really well.

persona4golden,2zu6yo,chrisx8x23x95,10,Sun Mar 22 01:40:29 2015 UTC,"I think this is the fourth time I've seen a topic like this on reddit... I feel old in a weird way.  On topic: she's okay. She just doesn't stand out compared to an idol, a detective, or my girl Chie. It doesn't help that her crisis is the one that gets resolved in the most boring way: she just decides that she's cool with staying with the inn. That's kind of it. It's nice, but she's not becoming a cop, or solving more crimes, or relaunching her career as a pop sensation. She's just... Staying with her family business.  She definitely has her place as one of the more serious and weighted voices in the group, and when she takes a stand it's great to see. But little weird characterizations, like laughing a lot at dumb stuff and not realizing how deadly her cooking is seem like attributes added at the last minute to try to spice her up. Weirdly enough, it wasn't until Persona Q that she really clicked as a character for me, but even then that was mostly because they embraced her hinted-at weirdness completely and it worked.  In the Persona 4 games and anime, she just gets left behind a bit. She's not bad; there's just more interesting characters to fixate on."
persona4golden,2zu6yo,fly19,3,Sun Mar 22 02:18:14 2015 UTC,"I actually agree with this pretty strongly.  She was just ""boring healer/firemage with nothing really happening"".  Then in Persona Q, we got the caricatureization of the cast.  It worked out better or worse for some.  Chie's like of meat was taken to obsessive levels, Akihiko and protein the same way.  Teddie was...unbearable.  Some characters, however, actually worked pretty well, Mitsuru, Yukiko, Shinjiro and Kanji I thought were all pretty  decent and honestly almost more likeable than the first time I played through P4G."
persona4golden,2zu6yo,JancariusSeiryujinn,1 point,Sun Mar 22 06:55:10 2015 UTC,"Akihiko's protein obsession was annoying, but I think people exaggerated Chie's meat love a little. And Teddy had a moment or two that almost made up for how un-bear-lievably annoying he was. What I liked best was the parallels and friendships between the characters, like Teddie and Koromaru's pseudo-rivalry, Kanji being all mentorly to Ken, Fuuka and Rise giving each other navigator tips... It was just fun."
persona4golden,2zu6yo,fly19,2,Sun Mar 22 07:12:20 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I definitetly enjoyed the game overall, I just think some of it could have been toned down a little.  And some characters seem to have forgotten their character development.  Like, by September, I had maxed Junpei's social link (and I went straight from P3 to P:Q), so it was weird hearing him act and talk immature compared to the developed serious guy he is at that point in my game."
persona4golden,2zu6yo,JancariusSeiryujinn,1 point,Sun Mar 22 07:22:32 2015 UTC,"That's the drawback of having the story take place halfway through both games -- there's no canon ""this much character development is done by x day"" so everyone ends up being a mix between who they are and who they will be, or failing that their most memorable caricatures.  Still, I loved it. I wouldn't mind seeing the subpersona system sneak into a mainline Persona game at some point, and it'd be nice to see Etrian Odyssey have a story and characters even half as good as Persona 3&4."
persona4golden,2zu6yo,fly19,4,Sun Mar 22 07:31:29 2015 UTC,"Nope, I don't like Yukiko.   The main problem is that she's boring. She's painted as being this perfect girl, she's the top of her class, she's so beautiful that most of the school has a crush on her, and she manages to juggle school work with helping at the inn because she's so clever and such a good daughter.   The 'flaws' that people point out in game aren't really negative flaws at all. She laughs like an idiot when she finds something really funny. She can't cook. She's adorably clueless about things that wouldn't phase most normal people.   That's it. All of the flaws above are used, in game, to make her much more appealing. She laughs? Oh it's so cute that she can break her formal image and let loose! She can't cook? But she tries and makes adorable mistakes. She's naive? Oh it's so sweet that she doesn't know that.   Even her Social Link doesn't come to anything; she doesn't want to run the Inn, she does some soul searching, ooh she does want to run the Inn after all. That's not bad in itself, but when partnered with a simple character like Yukiko, it just falls flat.   That's just it. Yukiko is just so flat compared to the other characters. It's not that there's anything wrong with her, it's more that there's not really anything special about her either."
persona4golden,2zu6yo,Aruu,1 point,Sun Mar 22 12:02:13 2015 UTC,I always felt that her flaws/quirks/boredom is more of a cultural thing. Might be something I dont quite get being a non-japanese.
persona4golden,2zu6yo,smatdesa,2,Wed Apr 1 07:25:18 2015 UTC,"We actually had a topic about this a month ago and I think the main problem that people find her and social link boring. Some people may be trolling a bit or are way into their waifu and hate on other waifus. Yukiko is my favorite romance in Golden and I find her social link sweet with her telling off those reporters the highlight of her social link. Other people may think following around Yukiko who can't decide on her career is a waste of time, I'm fine with it because it's hard to decide on what you want to do with the rest of your life and Rise's social link is similar in that regard. However I think her goofiness goes overboard in Ultimax and I didn't like her in that game, but I fell in love with her again in Golden. It's alright if people don't like what I like, but I don't think Yukiko deserves all the hate."

persona4golden,2zqq2h,Kal217,4,Fri Mar 20 22:02:01 2015 UTC,"Welcome to SMT. Basically, you have grinding to do. A lot of it. Your characters have elemental weaknesses and resistances as well as the enemies. You can't just fuse one persona and be good to go. You have to vary your weaknesses and resistances in order to better counter whatever enemy you face. In addition, pay attention to your buffs and debuffs. One Rakukaja or Tarunda can vastly change a battle's flow, so always have a part member or a persona who can give out buffs as needed. Pay very close attention to this and fuse accordingly. I recommend that you hit level 25 in order to have the best chance at this level and to have the best chance at the boss. Good luck."
persona4golden,2zqq2h,Kal217,2,Fri Mar 20 22:09:26 2015 UTC,"I've played up quite a but further then that, but I still haven't beaten the game. Anyway, here's what's been working for me so far:  -Grind.  Golden shadows, and shadows from earlier dungeons are the best place to farm XP, and they are normally quite weak compared to your more powerful characters.  -Do NOT fuse as often as you can.  Fuse a good magic persona, and a good physical persona.  Switch between them as needed, and only fuse for an improvement for stats, skills, or if your current ones become stagnant (no more learn able skills.)  -Get a healer.  Yukiko is the best choice for a healer because of skills she gets and some other things she can get also improve her healing ability.  -Know what you can handle. If you can't handle the sauna, go back to the castle for a bit and grind more XP.  -Get new armour and weapons from Daidara regularly.  If it's an improvement buy it if you can.  Sell him materials from dungeons and he will sell more things!  -Utilize the shopping channel.  The shopping channel is a very useful thing to get bountiful items, charms (I forget what they are called atm, sorry.  The other equip beside weapons and armour.), weapons, and armour with great bonuses.  -Use useful charms (OK what are they called?  >.<)  if they aren't useful to the party member don't give it to them.  For example don't give Chie something to help her dodge ice, she is already resistant to it.  I might have a few more tips if you are still having trouble, but playing by these tips on normal has given me no trouble to far."
persona4golden,2zqq2h,Kal217,1 point,Fri Mar 20 22:15:14 2015 UTC,ok thanks this is good advice but one more thing do i go and grind every day and go into dungeons everyday somone is missing or should i improve relationships more often? it gets very preasuring since im on a time limit so i start to panic and just go for it withought thinking about relationships.
persona4golden,2zqq2h,MoogleBoys,2,Fri Mar 20 22:32:54 2015 UTC,"No!  Do NOT go into the TV everyday!  Try to go into the TV as few days as possible.  Social links help you immensely,  and are just as important as grinding.  I think you already have the fox who heals you fully for money unlocked so that helps you.  I've been knocking out dungeons in a single day to maximize the amount of social links I can do.  Do what /u/Taraiph said too.  Status effects and weaknesses are critical in this game, and can not be written off like you would in Pokémon."
persona4golden,2zqq2h,MoogleBoys,3,Fri Mar 20 22:41:08 2015 UTC,"Yea, yes, yes. The importance of leveling up social links is IMMENSE and cannot be overstated.

The Hunger Arcana is the Thoth tarot equivalent of the Strength Arcana, numbered XI. Hunger symbolizes the danger of losing control, of being consumed by power. The card also implies strength, but strength which comes through Dominance. It is not true power, but the pure bliss of abusing power. Just as the Hunger Arcana is the equivalent of the Strength Arcana, the Jester Arcana is the equivalent of the Fool Arcana, numbered 0. The Jester symbolizes much of what the Fool symbolizes--ignorance, spontaneity, and freedom--but in a suppressed form. In the case of the Jester, the querent is misguided and unwilling to work with others, in contrast to the Fool, who is compatible with everyone.

That alone made all the difference. After that, you can just max all the attributes out early on. Then from there, it's just a matter of spreading the social links out to make sure you don't have days where nobody is ready to rank up.

I'm over 140 hours of playtime.  As for the Golden Animation, it's so bizarre (the whole thing is bizarre, but man) and different from everything else that it's hard to even consider it canon.  It's still fun to watch but the story is way off.  The Arena games are also worth playing for the story if nothing else."

I was through 82 hours and finished the game and almost immediately started a new game+. I also have p3p,  it's ok but it feels a little hollow compared to 4.

persona4golden,2ys3ew,Liquidje,1 point,Thu Mar 12 15:41:25 2015 UTC,I recommend buying Vita aswell. One playthrough is about 60-80 hours. Usually you'd want to play at least twice since it's pretty much impossible to see all the content in one playthough. Also either after or before Golden you should play Persona 3 Portable so that'd double the hours you'd get out of your Vita.
persona4golden,2ys3ew,Shaedana,1 point,Thu Mar 12 16:38:45 2015 UTC,"Like the others here, I bought a vita specifically for P4G, and it was well worth it. My first playthrough was 89 hours. The vita also has both danganronpa games which are sort of similar (but not quite as good). I haven't played P3P but I did play p3FES and it is excellent as well!!"
persona4golden,2ys3ew,op_xsupernova,1 point,Fri Mar 13 03:23:00 2015 UTC,"If cost isn't an issue, P4G is the way to go - decent amount of added content, and makes the game a fair bit better IMO. Also mechanically improved somewhat, mostly quality of life stuff (fusing persona is easy in Golden but can be tedious in the original for example). That being said, the original is still a great game, and definitely a fine way to see the story. (In terms of value, I've put 300+ hours into the game over four playthroughs, so for me the vita was worth it just for this game).  I really can't recommend the Golden anime though - some of the stuff it does with the story is interesting (e.g. the culprit episode), and it has some great music, but the ways it changes the story (for the worse) and crowbars the new character into everything is just infuriating at times. The original anime is much better."
persona4golden,2ys3ew,stordoff,1 point,Sat Mar 14 08:17:49 2015 UTC,"Go out and buy a PS Vita immediately.  You can then download Persona 1,2,3 &4 and play all of them. Then make the tough choice on whether to buy a PS3 or PS4 for Persona 5, it'll be on both systems.  As a first game, I'd suggest playing either Persona 3 or Persona 4 first. Don't start from the beginning because Persona 1 & 2 are very different games than Persona 3 & 4.  While they have a similar overarching story, the game play is RADICALLY different and doesn't seem as ""newbie"" friendly unless you live off of JRPGs."
persona4golden,2ytci8,jws381,2,Thu Mar 12 17:28:24 2015 UTC,I really don't know what to say to this...
persona4golden,2ytci8,iwasannon,0,Thu Mar 12 20:44:40 2015 UTC,"Important Points:  -This was originally written for a RWBY-centric audience, and it has a RWBY-centric plot.  The Persona 4 characters play important parts, but they're not the stars.  If there's a hierarchy, it's Ruby 1st, Yu 2nd, the rest of Team RWBY 3rd and the rest of the Investigation Team 4th.  -Being RWBY-centric originally, it is necessary to have some knowledge of that series to fully appreciate the story.  The entire RWBY series only totals about 4 hours and is free to watch on YouTube, and I highly recommend it.  That said, reading the Wiki whenever you run into something you don't understand would work too.  -Don't expect the Persona characters to be overpowered.  If they casually swatted everything they faced, the story would be pretty lame.  -The Persona characters don't use weapons (except Naoto).  They fight exclusively with their Personas.  This is for some realism, as none of them have training.  It's also in agreement with the anime.  -The rules of the world are not the same as those of Persona, though they are similar.  If you find something that doesn't work the same way, it's by design.  Unless I screwed up.  Then just pretend I did it on purpose.  -Things are fairly adult, at least when it comes to violence and sometimes language.  There's a lot more blood than in Persona 4, but that's why the story is rated M.  Some parts will be difficult for the squeamish but I don't think it's too extreme.  There are some mild sexual themes, but nothing beyond what's in the game.  -If you're still with me and still plan to read it, thank you.  I ask that you read at least he first four chapters before coming to any conclusions.  I feel that the story really hits its stride then."

Try to have a variety of Persona available to cover for types of stuff the rest of your party doesn't have. For example, Yosuke (Wind), Chie (Ice/Physical), and Yukiko (Fire/Heals) can make for a decent party. You're missing electric damage though so try to have a Persona on the Main Character that had a Zio skill just in case you need it."
persona4golden,2y1wt8,GunCastor,1 point,Fri Mar 6 00:52:13 2015 UTC,"If you ever become stuck on a boss, abuse your personas strengths. If you have a boss that does electric damage, grab a persona that is strong, null or absorbs electricity. Also, stuff like poison and panic don't work on bosses, so most of the time those skills won't benefit you that much. One last thing, physical attacks cost HP rather than SP. Don't use them too much unless you have a healer like Yukiko on your team."

persona4golden,2y1wt8,JancariusSeiryujinn,1 point,Tue Mar 10 08:13:00 2015 UTC,yea definitely not needed every turn but with semi-regular healing it should take care physical skills.  also to add I generally only save either group physicals or the only single targets have to be like x1-3 hits.

I think I ran through Yukiko's castle about 5 or 6 times before I actually got to the next part of the main story. By the time I did my MC was already level 26 xD.

It's also a good idea to have MC help with magic damage too. As per previous suggestions, you may not be leveled enough so take the time to level grind"
persona4golden,2y1kcv,dat1azndude,1 point,Thu Mar 5 23:17:17 2015 UTC,"I had an Ares with Auto-tarukaja, rakunda, and rampage. I had Yosuke cast sukukaja on the MC every other turn and Chie cast takukaja when auto wore off and rebellion on the next turn. Yukiko was my designated healer and when she didn't have to heal I took out the fire weak one. I didn't really focus on the nice and tough guys because they got hit via rampage as well. I will admit though that rakunda didn't really work out too well until the the one on the left died because it kept casting rakukaja on shadow kanji. The only person to ever drop below half health was Yukiko because she got hit by a power charged swift strike because she had to heal everyone with media. The fact that Ares was also resistant to physical attacks helped out a lot.  The ideal route would probably be taking out the side guys first and then doing what I did with the party buffs and then going to town on him. Don't focus too much on social links in the first playthrough because you can't really max all of it without the proper stats. Plus, some options are straight up unavailable because you lack the stats in the beginning. In NG+ you keep all your stats for courage and etc so it makes social link rank ups easier. I would probably only focus on the social links of the characters you want to use as ranking up their social links will actually get you bonus skills and etc."

Unless you have his Social Link maxed out (which you probably don't considering you're still in Kanji's dungeon) then you might wanna start grinding at Yukiko's castle.  Shadow Kanji's minions have weaknesses too. Try exploiting them and the battle will be much easier when you get rid the two of them.

persona4golden,2xmy0g,JancariusSeiryujinn,1 point,Mon Mar 2 08:41:21 2015 UTC,"the more personas you fuse, the higher discount you get when buying personas. I haven't heard of a reward for fusing all personas, I just know of the achievement. I think its the 3rd rarest achievement you can get for p4g"
persona4golden,2xk5yq,dizzybridge,2,Sun Mar 1 13:49:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're approaching dungeons all wrong. Stock up on healing items or, if you're using Yukkiko or have a healing persona, use healing spells. Only leave each day when your MP is low as that can't be restored easily. The amount of enemies you end up defeating, you'll get back the money you'll spend on healing anyway.  Also you REALLY need to start fusing more personas. Personally, when I look at personas, I look primarily at the Magic or Strength stats, depending on the move set of the Persona. Try and fuse the highest MG or STR stat one you can and it will probably help you out loads. It's also good to fuse because if your S Link is high enough with a specific arcana then the Persona's level can be above your Character's level which once again gives you a significant advantage. Also be on the look out for any Persona's you can fuse with Medium damaging moves instead of Small damage moves. I can't remember if you'll have medium moves or not yet but look out for them anyway.  If you need to know more just ask."
persona4golden,2xk5yq,IncendiaryLemon88,2,Sun Mar 1 14:00:00 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, we were all new to this at one point! Here's just a few hints;   Don't leave once your HP is low. Use Yukiko or Yosuke to heal your party (you can do this through the Skills command in the main menu) and keep charging on ahead. If MC has any healing skills then you can also use him, but use him as a last choice for a healer; he'll need his SP for other things.  Fuse more personas. When you enter the Velvet Room, just use the Compendium to register (save) the personas you have on you a the moment. You can then play around with fusing personas, and if you accidentally use one that was useful or that you wanted to keep, you can then buy that persona back from Igor via the Compendium.  Fusing Personas can be confusing. A basic way of doing it is making sure that you have a persona that can heal, and then personas for each element (ie one that know Zio moves, one that knows Bufu ones, etc). Occasionally these Personas will overlap. Don't worry too much about stats and the like since you're still getting used to everything."
persona4golden,2xk5yq,Aruu,1 point,Sun Mar 1 14:15:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you both!  Do you change personas often when in battle?  Also how much do you all grind in the ""old"" dungeons after you have beaten their respective shadows?"
persona4golden,2xk5yq,Aruu,1 point,Sun Mar 1 14:50:47 2015 UTC,"I change Personas if I happen to need a skill that a different Persona has, or if the Persona I currently have equipped has a weakness to the enemy that I'm fighting.   For example if Yukiko is silenced and I need a decent healer quickly, I'll make MC switch to a Persona that knows healing moves.   Usually I only grind in older dungeons when it coincides with a side-quest. If you talk to various people in the school and around the town with a "" mark above their heads, they'll sometimes ask you to fetch them something. These things are items that Shadows drop at the end of a battle. If you collect them and hand them over, you'll usually get something nice for your troubles.   There's also a bonus boss that appears in each dungeon after you complete it. You tend to get a unique and powerful weapon if you beat them."
persona4golden,2xk5yq,Aruu,1 point,Sun Mar 1 16:01:29 2015 UTC,"I guess i always assumed it was good to try and level up a certain persona, as opposed to spreading the wealth.  My main strategy is to go into a battle, try to use all the different elemental attacks until i find the weakness.  I usually never heal/use any type of magic or boosts/deductions for enemy.    Do you all manually control the other characters or just use the general tactics?    Right now I am going to grind a lower dungeon, I think i am really underleved for shadow Rise, She wipes out my whole group on the third turn or so."

I think that's your best shot. You have access to the Fox right now, right? She'll be waiting at the entrance to the TV world. If you pay her, she'll heal your party. Your best bet is to return to the entrance when you've run out of SP while grinding, and then ask for her services."

The IGN wiki doesn't hurt either haha."
persona4golden,2xjur4,Paopao21,5,Sun Mar 1 10:29:00 2015 UTC,"Definitely but I wouldn't recommend it. While it is good to see everyone's S.Link, you have to follow a strict schedule in order to do so and in most cases you have to beat a dungeon on the first day it becomes available. It's definitely preferable to do it on New Game+ but it is certainly possible first playthrough. I think the first playthrough you should do what you like and just have fun then go back and see everything the second time around. That's just my opinion anyway."
persona4golden,2xjur4,IncendiaryLemon88,2,Sun Mar 1 13:49:50 2015 UTC,"Main reason is that the first playthrough you need to max your stats, which is carried over from 1st playthrough to 2nd. So you can focus on those first then 2nd playthrough to max social link."
persona4golden,2xjur4,smatdesa,2,Mon Mar 2 01:13:10 2015 UTC,"First playthrough, in my opinion, should be done for pure enjoyment. The other playthroughs that you do can be for maxing stuff out."
persona4golden,2xjur4,Myalko,1 point,Mon Mar 2 03:02:28 2015 UTC,Agreed. Play the first time at your own pace. Learn and make mistakes. It's much more fun that way. The second time you can go for everything and follow a walkthrough to max all the s.links.

persona4golden,2wik36,wyrmw00d,3,Sat Feb 21 00:10:56 2015 UTC,My main problem with Yukiko is that in her S-link it starts with her having these strong ambitions about leaving the inn and making a name for herself by not following in her family's footsteps it made me really like her. Then she goes back on all that and says she will follow the tradition and takeover the inn after all and all my like for the character left like air from a deflating balloon. I thought it was great to have this typical traditional Japanese girl that wants to break the mold kinda like how a lot of modern Japanese youth probably feel nowadays but then to have her cave personally ruined all the character development she had throughout her S-link. That's my two cents on Yukiko I do like her personality but her development in her S-link was a massive disappointment.
persona4golden,2wik36,SailsofKharon,1 point,Mon Feb 23 01:09:58 2015 UTC,"havent you ever watched somebody make mistakes that you know you cant stop so you just have to watch them learn their own lesson.  i feel like thats the basis of her social link.  she needs to feel free to explore her options but the freedom makes her realize how appreciative she is for what she has.  she never knew what she wanted but only that she felt trapped and railroaded, mostly by acquaintances comments as we never see her family, so when given that freedom she wants to give back.  i do feel like it isnt the most exciting social link but the progression is definitely there.  she didn't want to move away she wanted to be her own person.  personally so far chie's is the worst imo.  seemed super telegraphed from the first few levels.  most of it felt like decisions she always would have made regardless.  she shows some growing individually but overall I enjoyed her character outside of her social link.  btw im not saying i dont like chie just was somewhat disappointed with her social link and character progression."
persona4golden,2wik36,wyrmw00d,1 point,Thu Mar 5 19:20:35 2015 UTC,I have seen too many people make the same mistake that Yukiko made where they have ambition and then decide to just settle and wind up miserable and it being too late to make an actual change and are now stuck . This is where I see her life winding up because she already said she wasn't happy working at the Inn and is more than likely going to have to rely on everyone's help which she also said she didn't want. For her to truly grow as a person she needs to become independent which taking over the Inn would do the opposite of.
persona4golden,2wik36,SailsofKharon,1 point,Thu Mar 5 19:44:19 2015 UTC,"fair enough, there is different paths for everyone.  i just think she realizes she doesn't have to sacrifice the life she already has for happiness.  the changes in her life that came from awakening her persona have filled that void in her life.  it changed her perspective on what she perceived as problems i guess is what im trying to say."
persona4golden,2wik36,Shiranui24,4,Thu Mar 5 21:56:05 2015 UTC,just because the best friends don't like her doesn't mean everyone agrees with them.  I maxed her social link and dated her before Rise showed up. After that i picked Rise when I played Golden.
persona4golden,2wik36,poeticpoet,5,Fri Feb 20 05:36:11 2015 UTC,"I like yukiko but I understand the hate.  I grew up broke.  that's all it is really.  We can relate with chie because she's hungry and she wants someone to buy her food.  Chie's hood in a way. Chie likes kung fu flicks and gets in random fights.....Chie doesn't like reading but loves practicing her martial arts and Chie wants to be a cop. Chie's issues stem from anger problems, being somewhat broke and just growing up a lil rough.  Naoto is an apprentice detective but she's ok with it and accepts it. Naoto knows she's different and acts with the composure and maturity that comes with it. Her life is tough because she has a lot of potential and pressure but she handles it because it's her duty.  Yukiko is kind of a spoiled brat. Yukiko's issues stem from being lucky and having it all from the get and unlike Naoto she doesn't accept it.  I understand because the pressure and stress can be a lot for some. I also, understand that it must be difficult to have your life planned for you. Most humans want to make their own way and that's why I've never had an issue with Yukiko.  However, in contrast to the problems of Chie and Naoto then Yukiko needs to shut the fuck up and that's why some hate.  I personally do not subscribe to this hatred because I like to think of each persons dilemma as their own inner monologue(that is to say) something only each person can understand for themselves.  I don't believe in judging ones problems worse than another's because only the person who is dealing with them knows how they feel.  I'm old and trust me.....a few years back and I would not feel this way."
persona4golden,2wik36,martynek,2,Fri Feb 20 07:41:47 2015 UTC,"Yuki felt like the most natural girlfriend for the MC, based on how the story went. My first playthrough I just kinda went through how I thought it should be canonically, and while people think that Rise is supposed to be the MC's canon lover, she just felt like an annoying Jailbait to me.  My thoughts on the others: Chie is annoyingly loud and stupid, Naoto is okay but just seems kinda... meh, Marie i can see why some people like it but I just hate Tsunderes, so i never tried going for her."

In the start we're told that Yukiko is the smartest in their class, she's the prettiest to the point where she has an entire 'challenged' named after her and the teacher calls her out as one of the cute ones, and she still has time to help her mother run the inn like a good girl? It doesn't add up, Yukiko's a little too perfect when she has so much on her plate.   Her social link was a little bland. It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either. I liked Yukiko telling off the camera men, and thought it was great that she decided running the inn could be her choice after all. I really wish they'd done more with that, in terms of her characterisation.   Also, it might be shallow, but the laughter fits got pretty old pretty fast for me.   I love Yukiko's design, though.

The graphics aren't bad by any means BUT just know that it IS a step down from P4/P4G. It takes a little getting used to but I'm fine with it.   The gameplay is almost the same as P4 only with a VERY few differences.   You have your basic skills and the protagonist can have multiple persona's. You can still fuse personas and you still have party members. There's still social links and you still get to do things after school just like you can in P4.  The biggest change for me was that the overworld sections (the ones after school) aren't free roaming. Its kind of like a point and click map. Its kinda of hard to explain but you cant walk around in the overworld, you have a cursor and you move around with that. The dungeons,however, play just like P4"

persona4golden,2w0ha8,Zero182,8,Sun Feb 15 22:22:36 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about missing stuff. You should let the first run be your story, doing what interests you, befriending those you like, ignoring those you don't. It gives the game tremendous replay value. There's nothing wrong with looking up a spoiler free max social link guide if it really bothers you, which I can understand.  Always fuse, level up only if the persona is going to learn an insanely useful skill within a couple of levels, but levelling up more than fusing will make your overall levels fall behind, as the MC's personas take far longer to level up than him or the party. Also, keep a stock of personas which match the S Links you're doing when out of dungeons, as they increase the number of behind the scenes level up points you get from interactions..  Dungeons are very slightly harder on rainy days, but they do make good times to do them ona ccount of the low number of other things to do (Though Aiya bowls and the rainy day S Links like Sun are also an excellent use of the time). It's efficient to do them in 1 day, but that's hard if you don't know the game well, so unless you're playing with a day to day schedule, don't make it a hard and fast rule.  Let us know if you have any other questions, I speak for the whole subreddit when I say we want more people to enjoy this fantastic game :)"

Just another quick question if you don't mind :)  I know Rise seems like an awesome character so I'll probably want to max her social link when she becomes available, so when she does, how will I know where to find her and what days she ""appears""? This kind of goes for every character. Do they appear in specific places on specific days?   Thanks in advance!"
persona4golden,2w0ha8,AndyF1996,2,Sun Feb 15 23:05:56 2015 UTC,"for the main party members they're available as soon as they start appearing around school and Inaba, it's obvious enough. the 5th and particularly the last party members both have slightly more stringent requirements, so I'd recommend getting in to the habit of occasionally talking to random NPCs as you pass them. Alternatively, if you're stuck, feel free to PM me and I'll try and give you a vague clue. As the game goes on some S.Link requirements become a little less clear, but you'll still find them if you get into good habits.   Incidentally, characters DO have set calendars, which hold any time it's not raining. Any time they can be social linked a big ""!"" appears above their head, and around school, so you're unlikely to miss them."

If you really want to look up walkthroughs, max social guides, etc. to get everything you can out of your first run, personally I think you should just look up a spoiler free ending guide. One more thing don't give up, beat this game no matter what is bothering you, this is a fantastic game and I want more people to play it, I have a good friend who won't play P4 because she hates Teddie, she let a little thing stop her, little things don't have to stop you.

EDIT: It should be noted that I edited the description of my post to sound not quite so hostile. That's why the OP of this comment expressed confusion.
persona4golden,2w1tce,xxSharktits_snipeRxx,5,Mon Feb 16 18:52:41 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing. You said a ""Mudo Boost is a dark spell.""  Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.  As someone who is a Kirijo group scientist who studies dark magic, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls Mudo Boost a dark spell. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. It's a passive.  If you're saying ""dark spell family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of active spells, which includes things from mudo to mudoon.  So your reasoning for calling Mudo Boost a dark spell is because random people ""call the one hit ko a dark spell?"" Let's get hama and mahama in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone a persona or a shadow? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. Mudo Boost is Mudo Boost and a member of the dark spell family. But that's not what you said. You said a Mudo Boost is a dark spell, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the magic family dark spells, which means you'd call agi, zio and dia dark spells, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

persona4golden,2vwg8v,AndyF1996,1 point,Mon Feb 16 17:40:38 2015 UTC,"It's got extremely dated mechanics, very high encounter rates, a fairly different and slightly awkward combat system that I'm not a fan of, and, while 2 has some of these problems too to a slightly lesser degree, in 2 I personally believe the story justifies the mechanical shortcomings, which I don't think in 1. I am fully prepared to admit this might be bias on my part, but that's my two cents on it."

This game takes an emotional toll on a person because of the insane story and characters and how close you become to them.

If you have other tower arcana personas already fused, you can perform a double fusion to get what you need since fusing personas of the same arcana keeps the resulting persona in that arcana as well. To fuse Abaddon this way, you'd have to fuse Mara and Masakado. Then you can use Abaddon and Mara for Cu Chulainn.   For Cu Chulainn, you can also try a triangle fusion of Neko Shogun, Mithra, and Black Frost (Black frost=Third persona) or Parvati, Mithra, and Black Frost. (Black frost is third here as well)  Since Triangle fusions are dependent upon the persona's current levels, just make sure you've got that in order too."

I'd recommend watching videos of people playing the game and making your decision from that. Worst comes to worst, just watch a Let's Play of them or something."

persona4golden,2viklh,joebonekenobi,3,Wed Feb 11 07:33:54 2015 UTC,"Hi there, you can get all of them digitally on the PSN store in US and almost all of them with EU.   Prepare for a wall of text!  The only game that's comparable to P4G is the Persona 3 games in my opinion. As the gameplay is mostly the same with some minor differences.   There is 3 versions of Persona 3, the original PS2 one, Persona 3: FES, which has some extra content, and the PSP one called Persona 3 Portable. Which you could get for the vita. Sadly the portal one cuts out cinematics (replaces by still images) and 3D environments (except for the dungeon crawling parts) but you do get the option to play as a girl.  The older games namely Persona 1, Persona 2: Innocent Sin, and Persona 2: Eternal Punishment. (yes there is two!) the games haven't aged that well in my opinion, the combat is really old-school, and I personally never finished any of them as I get bored with the clunky combat). you could get them with on the store (PSP games, and a PS1 classic game)  Also the music for all of them is spectacular.  I could go on and on but I'll stop myself here."

persona4golden,2viklh,Shaedana,2,Wed Feb 11 12:10:11 2015 UTC,Also Persona 3 Portable lets you control your party members like in P4G. That is not the case with P3 vanilla and P3FES. There's much debate which people prefer: Portable for the combat and more refined but non-canon female MC or the cutscenes and epilogue of the FES -version.  In any case I recommend playing either one of them after Golden and the male path first to see the canon story.  Also stay out of ANYTHING related to the Arena games. The trailers are enough to spoil you. Play 3 and 4 first.  Persona Q also combines 3 and 4 but is less spoiler-y. Still recommended playing 3 and 4 before diving in to get most out of it.
persona4golden,2viklh,SemiZeroGravity,1 point,Thu Feb 12 05:58:37 2015 UTC,get the psp versions on P1 and P2 Innocent Sin and Eternal punishment the are especially since the psp version is closer to the original japan releases and i think the Psone version of persona 1 had some content cut out    only the psp version of innocent sin got localized too but Eternal punishment's psp version never got released out side japan so you will need to get the Psone version   i know it is confusing but thats how it is :D

persona4golden,2v2hhd,Ritushido,1 point,Sun Feb 8 14:49:28 2015 UTC,If you really want the console ONLY for P5 (and older games) you will probably be fine with a PS3. If you plan yo play newer games and want the console to keep receiving games/updates for years then the ps4 should have a longer life and better odds of getting new games.  I have both and they are both awesome systems.

Persona 4 managed to be both of those things and still keep me interested with it's amazing story line and well written characters with top-notch voice acting.

I never really cared much for Etrian Odyssey's gameplay and the persona reskin didn't make it much better.   While seeing the characters interact with eachother was fun, they oversimplified a lot of them into caricatures of their former selves. An example I saw right away was Chie, who never EVER shuts up about meat. I get it was a running gag in previous titles but they went into complete overdrive with it. I was originally going to have her be one of my main party members but I got so sick of her constant meat talk.    I seem to feel like in a minority though so if you want to give it a shot, go ahead."

The battles work similarly, except instead of getting an extra turn when you strike a wildness, your skills won't cost any SP on your next turn.  The dungeon crawling is massively different as it focuses on drawing the map as you go, marking shortcuts and points of interest on the bottom screen. The battles are random except for the incredibly strong shadows that you'll have to avoid into you level up enough.  I played through the first dungeon and really enjoyed it, but I quit playing until I beat Persona 3 because I'm not familiar with the cast."

persona4golden,2v0hsu,gardobus,2,Fri Feb 6 23:19:16 2015 UTC,Well I just tried out one of the demos but I found the whole concept of map making weird.  Why are we supposed to even make maps?  Regardless the demo seemed okay. Are the battle animations available in the Persona game?  For some reason the demo felt a little iffy on the 3DS. :/
persona4golden,2v0hsu,gardobus,2,Wed Feb 11 05:49:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the map-making is different. Its just to keep track of where you are and where you've been/found.  I don't think battle animations are available in PQ either. :("

Pretty much the reasons you mentioned are why I'm not willing to go as far as borrow money from parents to buy a game which is pretty much the only one on the handheld with a price as high as $50.

No-one on PC really asked for it, but I'd like P5 to come to PC, I seriously find it obligatory that companies always wanna keep every exclusive.

I feel the dungeons are better because they are themed around the dungeon boss instead of the random themes in Tartarus. I also feel that the high school bits are better too with more trips, actually controlling your character, different social links and generally more stuff to do.

Yosuke is a mediocre healer who can work in an emergency but shouldn't be relied on (the highest he gets is Mediarama/Youthful Wind, and he has no status effect recovery skills or revive skills)."

persona4golden,2tfb08,TrueTinFox,3,Sat Jan 24 02:13:40 2015 UTC,She also has enough SP to be the dedicated healer (much more important in early game than late game though).

persona4golden,2tfb08,SemiZeroGravity,1 point,Sat Jan 24 06:05:16 2015 UTC,"Typically, you just need one healer. Yukiko is the default choice for most players, especially with her getting divine grace to increase her healing amount.   No matter what though, I suggest that you always have a good party healing move somewhere on the protagonist to in case of emergencies or something. There are also some times (some specific boss battles too) where the enemy will spam attacks your healer is weak to, so you'll want to make sure the protagonist can take over in those situations so you're not low on health. If not, you either have to heal anyway and risk them dying and the enemy getting `1 MORE left and right, or have them guard and lose your healing source.  If you're late enough in the game that you can get naoto, then you can definitely pass the healing over to the protagonist, but the main reason you wouldn't want him doing it during boss fights in particular is since he does the most damage and you'd want him attacking. Of course, if you do want to use him, you can pick up the invigorate line of skills and restore his SP and not have to pay much money to have it restored, especially with the two physical attackers in your party."

persona4golden,2t9w8l,Xhinope,3,Thu Jan 22 09:35:30 2015 UTC,"Let's see. I've got a few.   Early game, get the persona Sylph and Sarasvati. They both have Regenerate and invigorate, meaning you can restore your own SP restored without relying on the fox. It saves you a ton of money early on, though at the cost of being a bit tedious. Whenever you run out, just go to Yukiko's castle and guard by yourself against one of the weak enemies until your SP is full again. I usually leave the healing to the protagonist using this technique. Since it's golden, the good ol' Jack Frost persona is awesome since he eventually gets Mind Charge on top of resist fire (fuse him May 1st), ice boost, and bufula. That makes quick work of Nice guy when you're fighting against Shadow Kanji.  I didn't find it as reliable, but Kaiwan's tetrakarn can help soften Shadow Kanji's blow's a bit, provided you deal with tough guy's rampage too. It would be good to get him dizzy first. The skill enduring soul is a godsend, not just defensively, but offensively. I usually get Tam Lin fused and level him up once, in addition to grinding up the persona Rangda to get repel physical. From there, you just spam physical attacks against enemies and allow yourself to die and get your HP restored thanks to enduring soul. Since it's once per battle, this saves you a ton in resources and allows you to not be as reliant on SP. If you fuse Tam-lin with the sun social link maxed out and fuse on a day with social-link bonus EXP from fusion forecast, you'll get it without even worrying about grinding. Pick up the persona Ose (Fool, 31) and take advantage of power charge along with Mind Charge compliments of Jack frost. If you don't already, pick up the special items from each person's TV world area by defeating the boss. Yosuke also gets a pair of blades by going to Saki's area.  For shadow Yukiko, buy some ice cubes from the store before entering the TV world. This will allow Yosuke to deal ice damage and exploit three all out attacks per turn, since you and Chie can both hit with ice. You can do the same with shadow Kanji to deal with nice and tough guy if you'd like so all of your party members can deal more attacks. Take full advantage of fusion forecast. The null elec with Cu Chulainn is a favorite of mine. If you can, pick up Neko shogun and take advantage of Mediarama+Divine grace for added efficiency. Some useful personas to take note of. Rangda (Magician)-Repel Physical , King Frost (Emperor)-Null Fire, Orthrus (Hanged Man)-Null Ice, Fusing Cu Chulainn (Tower) on 9/7-Null Elec, Sarasvati  and (Priestess) Null Wind. Assuming you have all the social links for each respective persona maxed, you'd have to grind three levels for Rangda, 1 level for Sarasvati, and none for the rest. Shiki-ouji also gets the job done, but his social link is one tied to the plot, so it makes it trickier for grinding time, and he's still stuck with null physical instead of repel. Whenever doing playthroughs, I use my favorite persona, Yatsufusa, and fuse Enduring soul (Tam lin or Sui-ki if you're a slightly higher level), Repel Physical (Rangda), Null ice (Orthrus, one of the personas needed to fuse him), Null electric (From Fusion forecast Cu Chulainn), and Fire amp (black frost) and almost always end up finding a magician card to upgrade physical moves from Tam-lin to pass on. I got Myriad arrows for Yatsufusa my first playthrough, and now have Vorpal blade in the one i'm doing now. It leaves him only open to Mudo and almighty skills thanks to his natural affinities. (repels wind, nulls light, and absorbs fire)"
persona4golden,2t9w8l,TsundereKermit,1 point,Thu Jan 22 13:01:52 2015 UTC,"You recommend Sylph and Sarasvati ""Early game"" but how early are we talking? Are they Persona I can get as early as Yukiko's Castle? Or are you talking Kanji's Bath house? Do I need to fuse them? Or can I just find them (I don't remember much about which Personas I find apart from the super cute ones, and even then I don't remember all of their names)  I completely forgot about the Fusion Forcast TBH, because I was playing on Very Easy, and kinda decided ""Fuck the Mechanics, I'm just gonna beat the game!"" Which is VERY Easy to do!  Do you have any specific S.Links you recommend I go for? Or just whichever ones I want?"
persona4golden,2t9w8l,TsundereKermit,1 point,Thu Jan 22 15:39:25 2015 UTC,"You can get both Sylph and sarasvati in the steamy bathhouse. You could also fuse Pixie and Nata Taishi to get pixie and take advantage of the magician social link so you don't have to grind one level to get Regenerate 1. Once you fuse them together, the resulting persona should get both skills and you have your SP bank to go for you. Also, if you're someone that uses Naoto, you can have her restore her SP with you since she gets the invigorate skills from her social links.   You should also know that invigorate 1,2, and 3 stack if you didn't already. Same with the regenerate skills. If you fuse personas later on and get all three invigorate skills on one persona, you can get back 15 SP a turn and use this trick to save a ton of cash for yourself.   There are no specific social links I can suggest. I always just tried to go for as many as I could in a single playthrough. If you're focusing solely on the RPG part of the game and not interested in maxing social links, then I'd just start with the ones that match the arcana of your signature personas and then go for the others after that so you can fuse up stronger side-material personas for their skills to pass on to the main ones."
persona4golden,2t9w8l,stordoff,1 point,Thu Jan 22 18:04:10 2015 UTC,"Try not to switch Personas too often - use skills card where you can rather than fusing something new.

At the very least, learn the mechanics, learn some weaknesses, and depending on how confident you feel after you've saved Yukiko on your Easy file, you can either continue with the game on easy, or you can go back to your... (Normal? Hard? I don't think you mentioned which difficulty you were playing earlier...) other file, and see if you have a better time.

I use the go-home thingy and that lets me exit the dungeon to rest up whilst enabling me to return to the last floor I left off from.  This way I can fight the same floors, get the personas, level them up and then fuse some, all while picking up some consumables and cash.  This is something I didn't do at all during my first attempt, and left me feeling really under-leveled.  I didn't even have attacks of all the elements to find weaknesses in enemies lol."

persona4golden,2sqwd0,neetchan,2,Sat Jan 17 22:34:11 2015 UTC,I personally think it will be a lot better. With the current gen they will be able to add so much more to the games. this means Im sure they will add an incredible amount more detail into the game.
persona4golden,2sqwd0,RileyCola,2,Sat Jan 17 23:26:22 2015 UTC,"There's no possible way of knowing until it is released. So you can either A) Think negatively and only disappoint yourself, or B) Have some faith in the creators of this great series that they can do it again but even better.  Honestly I can only see this series growing as it has been trending that direction. P4's cast was more varied and tackled more issues (Kanji), so I can definitely hope that the next game will take it to an even higher level."
persona4golden,2sqwd0,bauran,2,Sun Jan 18 00:00:39 2015 UTC,Weather or not it lives up to Persona 4 I think Persona 5 will still be a great game.

I somehow lost the current version of my save. All of my previous saves were still there.   The save I lost was just after hours of fusions to get Alice. I realized too late that the Elizabeth fusion quests were necessary to get the best fusions, so I spent so much time getting Personas and fusing them and leveling them for the right abilities. Was such a pain.   My previous save was a month's time prior and before one of the big cutscene/battle scenes. (When I loaded it up I had to sit through half an hour of cutscenes to get to the boss, and then  it was one of those multiple boss fights. As in I had to beat 2-3 bosses back to back.)   When the save was lost, I didn't go back to P3 for months."

persona4golden,2sp0rl,SemiZeroGravity,3,Sat Jan 17 02:05:06 2015 UTC,"Have you played the original persona 4, or is this your first time period? Just curios. As for tips, the aeon social link has a ""time limit"". If you finish it before December 23rd in-game, you get something special. Doing this special thing is required for the best ending. Also, both the jester and aeon social links have limited availability compared to other socials, so I'd recommend looking up a spoiler free guide. And I know you said no battle tips, but if you need to grind, use golden shadows."
persona4golden,2sp0rl,MdnightSailor,1 point,Sat Jan 17 02:43:14 2015 UTC,this is my first play through P4 as a whole and i am trying to get those golden shadows but they keep escaping   BTW could you tell me more grinding tips ? my main persona (the guy with lots of belt buckles) is lagging behind the others he is a level 11 while yoskes persona is 14
persona4golden,2sp0rl,MdnightSailor,1 point,Mon Jan 19 08:28:19 2015 UTC,"Don't be afraid to fuse away personas. Just make sure that you register them in the compendium first, and that by the time you're done fusing that you still have a matching persona for your social links. As for the golden shadows, that's their gimmick. They give boatloads of xp and money but they escape if they get a ""once more"", or if the battles been too long. You just need to kill them as quickly as possible. So if there's more than one, all four party members gang up on one golden shadow at a time. If you're going to grind on regular enemies, use physical attacks. You have no way of replenishing your sp except through consumables, or by paying boatloads to the hermit social link (the price for the hermit will go down as you rank up it's social link).   Some other stuff I forgot to mention in my original post: If you're not following a guide and instead you're deciding your own schedule, along with the aeon and jester stuff I said earlier, you need to max the hermit social link asap. When you're doing a dungeon, a good rule of thumb is to be at least 10 levels higher than the previous dungeons boss."

persona4golden,2s965e,CaptainGongan,3,Tue Jan 13 06:00:08 2015 UTC,"Okay, the first thing you absolutely need to do is go watch the epilogue on YouTube, which is only available if you complete the Aeon S Link. Bummer that you didn't complete it, because it opens up a big part of the game (some of it admittedly not that interesting). The epilogue should take care of the part that you want most.  The next thing you need to do is to go play Persona 3 in one of its incarnations. I would recommend Persona 3 Portable for PSP (available on Vita) so that you're used to the battling system. It's very, very similar in play style, but a little different in tone. If you like one, chances are you'll like the other. Some even prefer P3.  Then play Persona Q, Persona 4 Arena (and its sequel) and optionally the first two Persona games as well. Haha I think that should hold you over for awhile."

By frustration I meant that there's a lot of grind, there's only one extremely long dungeon which gets tiresome quite fast. The dungeon layout is lot more maze-like and annoying and if you dwell too long the reaper starts chasing you. Also a lot more one-hit kills from enemies and no savestates other than what you have manually saved. I also had a few fights where all my party got charmed and I just had to watch as they kept killing eachother for a long while.  I got really mad at the game :) but I guess it says a lot that even so I ended up liking it more than P4G since the story and S.Links had more impact on me."

Does it give you an item to allow you to fuse it, or does it just become a permanent option in the Velvet Room? I'm just confused as to how they work."
persona4golden,2s2g3o,amonak,1 point,Sun Jan 11 19:54:57 2015 UTC,"Not 100% on this, but I think it depends; the ones that require more than 3 persona to fuse will show up in its respective category (if it uses 4 persona then it'll appear in cross, etc), but the ones that only need three or two you'll have to figure out yourself. Otherwise it just works like a normal fusion; get the persona you need and fuse.If you unlock them in one playthrough they're there for all playthroughs using that file."
persona4golden,2s2g3o,asianriceftw,1 point,Sun Jan 11 20:12:10 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, once you maxed out the S.Link you receive a key item, and once that item is in your inventory, the special persona will be available to fuse in a normal/triangle fusion inside the Velvet Room. Also, the special personas won't appear in the compendium, and some can be fused via special fusions (cross, penta, hexa), so you would need to search online for the fusion recipes."

Teddie isn't bad as a healer, but he doesn't get Salvation. He does get some nice buffs though for support.   Trumpeter is also a great persona for endgame, Debilitate screws bosses up."

I know it's not as efficient, but I left the healing to just the protagonist and brought Teddie along whenever I needed an emergency heal. I just brought a persona with invigorate and regenerate and restored all my SP in Yukiko's dungeon and had Kanji and Chie running physical moves. Then when I have a lot of free money later in the game, I fuse the persona Yatsufusa and usually switch between Chie and Naoto since my Yatsufusa set makes him damn near invincible and has it where I don't have to spend money on SP restoration.

persona4golden,2qygp8,Zabusy,2,Wed Dec 31 22:01:28 2014 UTC,"I'd say the game is definitely worth it, you know the main plot (minus the golden add ons) but there are all the social links still to do, as well as little side quests and things. It's a great game with tonnes of replay value.  There's maybe 4 hours total of all the stuff added from golden I think, depending on how fast you get through dungeons. Never played the original, but that's counting all of Marie's stuff and social link, the bonus dungeon and a couple of bonus bosses as well as Adachi's SL. There's also a new bad ending and an extra cutscene after the true ending.  All in all it's a fantastic game that really has a lot more depth than the anime (though I liked the anime too). Hope that helps!"
persona4golden,2qygp8,splodingshroom,1 point,Wed Dec 31 23:01:36 2014 UTC,"PLAY IT.   Admittedly, I played the game first before I saw the animation (still haven't finished the animation though!) but the game was awesome...SO awesome. It's definitely a must-pay game."
persona4golden,2qygp8,FantasticHamburguesa,1 point,Thu Jan 1 02:08:04 2015 UTC,"I'd say play it. :) As a person that hates grindy battles, but loves jrpgs, i have beaten the original (almost) 2 times, and am far in my Golden playthrough. If you love the game and enjoy the characters, why not? I believe it only adds 2 or 3 extra events to the games actual timeline, and 2 extra social links. Only downside to Golden is Chies voice was redone by a horribly annoying sounding girl. Very bad. But like i said, definitely worth playing."
persona4golden,2qygp8,ValerieBlood,1 point,Thu Jan 1 10:27:04 2015 UTC,"Having played the original ps2 version, are you still having fun with the Golden version? Also, does the scooter only appear in the Golden? (scooter's been mentioned in the internet walkthrus) Happy New Year!"
persona4golden,2qygp8,dreamzy,2,Thu Jan 1 11:31:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, i'm still having fun with the Golden, definitely. :) I wouldnt be playing it right now had it not been good. _^ Sorry for the late reply btw, i never use reddit, ahaha. Well, like i said, the plus is the extra social link and events for me, but might ruin who the murderer is whereas the original kept it better hidden. The scooters are strictly only in the Golden, but dont contribute much to the main plot. Also there are many alternative outfits for dungeons in Golden. All in all, it's just an added experience to play GOlden over the original. Only thing negative, again, i must mention is Chies voice is golden is far worse and terribly annoying in it where as the original chies voice is good, kind of makes me more dislike the character bc of it which isnt the way it should be. @__@ but yeah. ^^ Hope i helped! :P"

persona4golden,2qk05z,MdnightSailor,1 point,Sat Dec 27 20:44:12 2014 UTC,"Yeah if you exchanged the game then it's most likely the update. You need psn to manually update too, so that sucks. I guess just try every now and then to connect to psn until you get through."

persona4golden,2qhooh,666i,5,Sat Dec 27 00:52:00 2014 UTC,"For me, I bought the physical copy, and when I was playing it it was basically always on P4G. I never really wanted to play another game while I was still going through it. (Not that I had any others really, but that's beside the point.)  Persona games are always my focus when I decide play through them. Usually, if I'm playing a game, then I'm playing Persona. Take that as you will, I don't really know if this is better for one or the other."
persona4golden,2qhooh,telvarin,2,Sat Dec 27 02:08:55 2014 UTC,"You can find the physical copy for about $10 cheaper most places, if you're in the US. Plus, it doesn't require much space on your memory card for the save games as opposed to a 3.7 GB (IIRC) download from PSN.   Now, don't get me wrong, I have downloaded plenty of games from PSN... but P4G - if you're like me, that cartridge ain't coming out of your Vita, ever - which means save your PSN purchases for the other games you'll play in-between play-throughs of P4G."

And yes they give you a bit of time between each dungeon to rank up your S. Links or stats or whatever you want. If you wait until the last day I think it's like 1-2 weeks between each dungeon so if you finished it early it'll probably feel even longer than that. Anyway have fun hope you enjoy!

Of all the things they made better in P4G, they managed to somehow make fishing even worse.  Firstly, yes, you need to be using Genji Beetles. It doesn't need to be raining but it does appear faster when it is. I caught the Sea Guardian when it was cloudy. Look for ripples with splashes. If you don't see them, re-cast. One time it took me almost 30 tries before it appeared.  Once it does appear try to reign it in only when you have a full blue bar at the bottom. Avoid the temptation to do so when it's smaller otherwise you're far more likely for the line to break. It may take several tries to get the rhythm of it and it will probably be very frustrating until you do. It's worth it though to be able to complete the Fox S.Link."

Humor can't always be G-rated.
persona4golden,2ovocf,norn_necro,2,Wed Dec 10 17:13:41 2014 UTC,"More about arcana:   They indicate categories of personas, so personas in each arcana will have similar sets of abilities. Persona fusion is governed by what arcanas the personas belong to. So in Golden if you fuse a persona of the Magician arcana with one of the Priestess arcana, you'll always get a persona of the Moon arcana. It gets a little more complicated with the triangle spreads but the idea is the same. Each social link corresponds to an arcana. The more you level that social link, the more bonus XP you'll get when you create personas of that arcana through fusion."
persona4golden,2ovocf,TianDogg,1 point,Wed Dec 10 18:20:53 2014 UTC,im still confused about this persona fusion thing... does the game more in depth in explanation on it? is it something i should already be starting to do at my point in the game? (im at the part where im saving yukiko)  and why is it that the chart has different results when using the same persona's?   ex- horizontal fool + vertical magician = temperence  but horizontal magician + vertical fool = fortune  ??  sorry about all these questions lol
persona4golden,2ovocf,TianDogg,2,Wed Dec 10 18:34:23 2014 UTC,"Yeah the chart is a bit confusing. The fusion results listed in blue are the result of a normal fusion (2 personas). The results listed in orange are for triangle fusions (3 personas). Triangle fusions in the game involve an intermediate step which you don't see, where 2 personas are first fused and then the result is fused with the 3rd persona. The chart shows you the combinations and results for that 2nd step.  The game will tell you about persona fusion only insofar as it exists. However Golden has a fusion search feature that lets you see which personas you can get by fusing the personas you're currently carrying. So you don't really have to worry about the nuts and bolts of the fusion system until you want get 100% completion for the persona compendium."

persona4golden,2ovocf,MysticKirby,1 point,Wed Dec 10 20:32:05 2014 UTC,"The different Arcana are just like different faces of the cards. In shuffle time that just means the cards have different effects. They only matter in Fusion and Social Links, really.  You can't carry duplicate personas.  Skill cards are items that can be used on a persona. They basically add the skill to their skill list. You can either use them right away, or register them to Marie in the Velvet Room and buy as many as you like afterwards."
persona4golden,2ovocf,GranaT0,1 point,Wed Dec 10 18:02:04 2014 UTC,if you use them right away are they gone forever? wouldnt it be better to give them to marie so you can have as much as you want?
persona4golden,2ovocf,GranaT0,2,Wed Dec 10 18:27:32 2014 UTC,"They are consumables, so yeah they're gone. However, there's still a chance you will receive duplicates from shuffle time. Most of the stronger (and rarer) cards you'll want to register, if you can afford to buy them again.  Another advantage is that registered cards carry over to New Game+!"
persona4golden,2ovocf,Electon,1 point,Wed Dec 10 19:08:03 2014 UTC,"Read about tarot arcana somewhere. It's just symbolism, you don't need to know what it means to enjoy the game, though the knowledge will make you appreciate the attention to detail.  It is.  It disappears automatically, never pick a Persona you already have.  Skill cards allow you to give a certain skill to a Persona of your choosing. For example, a Garu card will teach a Persona skill called Garu, a basic Wind attack. It works exactly like in Pokemon."
persona4golden,2ovocf,Electon,1 point,Wed Dec 10 18:07:55 2014 UTC,"so are skill cards like TM/HM, and arcana are the types (fire, rock, dragon, etc) and personas are the pokemon?"
persona4golden,2ovocf,TianDogg,1 point,Wed Dec 10 18:35:54 2014 UTC,"Arcana aren't the types. Like I said, they're mostly there for symbolic purposes, though you can fuse stronger Personas from an Arcana that you've leveled up (for example, leveling up The Magician Social Link will unlock stronger Personas from The Magician Arcana and give them an exp boost).  Personas are kinda like Pokemon, except they stop being useful after a while, so you need to fuse weak ones into stronger ones."

persona4golden,2o1xhx,Palinomana,2,Wed Dec 3 04:42:03 2014 UTC,If you had played the male route I would've strongly recommended watching a story playthrough of The Answer addon content. It actually made me cry even more :D buuut.. It is told as a continuation to maleMC's story and it wouldn't fit for the FeMC.  But yeah I'm with you. P3P left a really strong impression and every now and then Atlus keeps poking at my wounds with new spin-off games and movies. Definitely the best and most satisfying game ending I've ever experienced. For me the only media that has surpassed the P3's emotional impact was watching Code Geass anime.

persona4golden,2mtgfu,Mechanity,4,Wed Nov 19 22:53:04 2014 UTC,"Its a relic from Persona 3 and FES, where Direct Commands weren't an option. I'm of the belief they wanted to use it as a device to characterise the party, and make it clear the MC is meant to be the only person you control, but I digress. P4 was coded in an engine either the same as or built directly on to that of P3. As a result, even though anything but DC is now fairly redundant, the other command styles stuck around in P4, and were also brought to P3P and Golden due to them being remakes. In short. always use Direct Commands in the games were they are available. P4 particularly is balanced around them and you may find it much more difficult if you don't use them."
persona4golden,2mtgfu,AndyF1996,3,Wed Nov 19 23:29:11 2014 UTC,"If the area of the dungeon I'm in isn't filled with particularly challenging enemies I leave direct control off and let the AI control my teammates. It's just easier and faster to get through it that way.   Despite the criticism it gets I actually think the AI in the Persona games is not bad. It doesn't always make the same call I would or necessarily be he most efficient buti would say maybe half of the time it makes a reasonable choice, IME."

persona4golden,2mdm27,DrmFox,1 point,Sat Nov 15 14:33:46 2014 UTC,"I can't really remember what level I was when I did the Hollow Forest but looking at the Enemy levels, you probably want to be between 70 and 80. It can be kind of tough regardless of level though. IDK how much you know/want to know about the dungeon (In terms of gameplay, not story) so I'll spoiler it just in case. In the dungeon, every time you finish a battle, your SP gets halved and you can't take any items or equipment into the dungeon, all of your equipment must be found within the dungeon. So with all that, it can be harder than your average dungeon, no matter what level you are."

So no, no other songs in Persona that are like Shadow World. That said, the song itself is from the J-POP genre, maybe you could look into that and see if there is something you like?"

persona4golden,2lyu93,Liquidje,2,Tue Nov 11 14:30:14 2014 UTC,"Maybe you should take a proper break? I don't know about SMT games but I felt that P3P had more grinding than P4G and it drove me nuts late game.  However if the story and SLinks interest you, definitely pick it up later. Especially since there are so many follow-up games to the P3/P4 storyline combo."
persona4golden,2lyu93,Shaedana,1 point,Tue Nov 11 16:01:38 2014 UTC,"To be honest I want a proper Persona break if I am honest with myself. The question is, does a Persona break insinuate a SMT break altogether, or are the games different enough?  I did make up my mind not to play P3P for the coming months. P4G was terrific, but I am just exhausted of that combatsystem (also because I was required to grind a few levels)."
persona4golden,2lyu93,Grotpar,2,Tue Nov 11 16:11:42 2014 UTC,"SMT IV is very different. It plays like a more traditional JRPG.  It's hard, especially for someone who is used to P4G difficulty. But there is an easy mode, which is definitely easy to someone who is acclimated to SMT's difficulty, so it should be about right for someone who isn't.  It has P4G's fusion improvement, but it's even easier because it includes fully premade fusion options based on demons you have for people who really can't be bothered. I still recommend actually fusing and choosing your skills yourself, though.  It has a compelling story, with compelling characters, though not to the extend of the persona games, but still head and shoulders above anything else I've played.  I definitely recommend it.  That said, P3P is a remake of the best game ever made.. So yeah, but you know, if you really need a break from that emotional drainage, go with SMT IV.   SMT is a solid series, and more people should play it instead of just going ""persona persona persona"". Just come back to P3P when you're done. You'll want to have played P3 for Persona Q, anyway."

persona4golden,2ll2d9,hpzachio64,7,Fri Nov 7 15:20:40 2014 UTC,"P3 is very different thematically than P4. It's main theme is mortality and the will to fight for one's life, whereas P4 was a search for the truth through self-discovery. P3 ends up as a much darker story as a result.   Also, if you're playing as the male in P3P, you'll find your party members don't really get along all that well with one another (which I actually enjoyed, since most RPGs have your party members all become your BFFs, whereas in real life, very different people thrust together on a team to fight for their lives would have obvious conflict). While this is still true in the female route, in the female route everyone seems to like the protagonist, but the tension amongst others in the group still remains.  Overall, I like the stories just about equally. Your mileage may vary, but the vast majority of P4 fans like P3 as well. Considering that in P3P you can control your whole party and not just the main characters (which is true in P3 Vanilla and P3: FES), it feels a lot like P4 when it comes to mechanics. The point and click system isn't as jarring as you'd think it'd be, either."
persona4golden,2ll2d9,pmmcl,4,Fri Nov 7 16:07:23 2014 UTC,"Are you restricted to just playing on Vita or do you have a PS2/PS3 as well? If you do I'd recommend P3 FES over P3P.

persona4golden,2ll2d9,ciaranmor,0,Fri Nov 7 21:18:50 2014 UTC,"I tend to disagree. While P3 FES is better graphical-wise with cutscenes and what not, the combat system is very different compared to P3P, and I think transitioning from P4G > P3P instead of P4G > P3 FES."
persona4golden,2ll2d9,Chronotakular,2,Sat Nov 8 03:03:05 2014 UTC,I have to admit there were times I hated playing P3P.. But still I ended up liking it more than P4G.

persona4golden,2ll2d9,Shaedana,1 point,Fri Nov 7 20:05:59 2014 UTC,"P3P is an excellent port for the PSP/Vita. While the game plays slightly different as you don't get to run around like you do in P4G, all the overworld interaction is done through a cursor type thing over the area, the dungeons are the same third person experience and the team mates and social links are just as strong as they were in P4G. If you're iffy on it then wait for a sale or check out some gameplay from early in the game, but I think is was well worth my money and hope you enjoy it!"
persona4golden,2ll2d9,IronPunchies,1 point,Fri Nov 7 15:41:37 2014 UTC,I wouldn't say it's as good as P4G but I still really enjoyed the game. It has a slight different feel to it and is a bit darker overall. The characters weren't as lovable as the P4 cast were in my opinion but a few of them I did really like. If you see it on sale or don't mind spending a few dollars I would go for it. It takes quite awhile to beat but not as long as P4G. P3P is likely your best bet for continuing on in the persona series I would say.

persona4golden,2l2we5,hpzachio64,3,Sun Nov 2 17:51:36 2014 UTC,"Well the obvious choice would be to turn down the difficulty to get through the battle, unless you are already at the easiest difficulty. If you truly cant defeat it, if you let time pass and dont save the victim it will basically just rewind a week or two and you can start the dungeon again from the beginning with plenty of time."
persona4golden,2l2we5,BrapBattle,2,Sun Nov 2 18:35:43 2014 UTC,"If you put it on the easiest difficulty the game literally won't let you fail. You'll be revived each time at full, so you can just beat him down, regardless of how long it may take."
persona4golden,2l2we5,Palinomana,2,Tue Nov 4 10:54:58 2014 UTC,"You could try using the fox to grind. The fox heals both HP and MP your entire party (for a price of course) allowing you to grind more. Mind you, how much money you have will factor in here, as the fox can be quite unforgiving when it comes to how much it costs."

persona4golden,2ki2b9,Shaedana,3,Mon Oct 27 21:07:36 2014 UTC,I thought the section with the nose to ear ringed guy was hilarious and completely worth throwing in
persona4golden,2ki2b9,QuickChip,2,Mon Nov 3 17:30:12 2014 UTC,Where did you see it? I can't find any website or anything that has it.
persona4golden,2ki2b9,awesomeman23,1 point,Tue Oct 28 20:23:39 2014 UTC,"Makoto's personality explains why he isn't immediately close friends with his dorm mates. Also him being so emotionally broken made the story even more creepy and unsettling. I can't wait to see how he developes in the sequels.   I feel the same way; you can tell he's changing with that coy smile of his at the end.   I almost warmed up for Yukari as a future love interest   I doubt that'd happen, as that is rank 10 social link and I believe in the Persona series maxing out social links isn't canon (Hence why none of the P4 cast have their Ultimate Personas in Arena, AU, Q, etc.)   I almost wish P4G was also made into movie   Pretty sure there was a movie version, but it was just one movie and it covered all the main points. Can't vouch for quality though.   Also goddammit why did they have get rid of evokers :(   Because the TV world didn't need them, IIRC. I assume that if the P4 cast were given Evokers they'd be able to summon their Personas outside the TV World. I was wrong, /u/KadeLylath gets it!"
persona4golden,2ki2b9,CrackLawliet,6,Mon Oct 27 22:20:30 2014 UTC,"Actually, the Envoker only works during the Dark Hour, which is essentially just the other world leaking. The cards used in Persona 2 and 4 are what ""natural"" persona users have. The Envoker doesn't allow them to summon Personas outside the other world, it just allows them to use them in an unnatural way."

persona4golden,2ki2b9,KadeLylath,1 point,Mon Oct 27 23:23:16 2014 UTC,I wouldn't be surprised if these movie versions had some minor romantic hints in them. They have already made a few bold changes to characters. I wonder how The Lovers dungeon scene will be handeled.. But yeah I don't want anything major. Just something to confuse poor Makoto and give more weight to the conclusion of the trilogy.  And I miss evokers just for the dramatic effect and coolness :) I actually thought they were removed since there had been some suicides related to the game but maybe I'm mistaken..
persona4golden,2ki2b9,ghostretch,1 point,Tue Oct 28 00:13:21 2014 UTC,I know it's unlikely but is there any chance that this movie is dubbed in English?

persona4golden,2k930j,pattyville,4,Sat Oct 25 01:46:34 2014 UTC,"I can tell you what I know, but don't expect it to be huge full answer. (I'm trying to not spoil myself too much for when the game actually comes out.)  So, the game has the cast of Persona 4 and Persona 3 characters, as well as 2 new characters (probably more) but the two new ones are the girl with the corn-dog and, for the lack of better terms, the black guy.  As for the story, I unno. All I know is that they are all together I believe because of some time travel shenanigans. Again, trying not to spoil too much for myself, someone else might elaborate on it further.  Hope it helps!"
persona4golden,2k930j,Chronotakular,1 point,Sat Oct 25 01:53:28 2014 UTC,"Thanks! This is actually really helpful. All this being said, do you think it's worth going back and playing Persona 3 before playing Persona Q?"
persona4golden,2k930j,Chronotakular,4,Sat Oct 25 01:55:16 2014 UTC,"Depends honestly. If you are looking for a game to play, and enjoyed Persona 4, Persona 3 is great. Most people will tell you to play Persona 3 Portable, because I've heard the console and Persona 3 FES' combat system are vastly different and maybe frustrating for those who have played Persona 4 first.  That being said, if you want to know to play Persona 3 so you won't get lost in Persona Q's story, I'm pretty sure you'll be fine. I'm pretty sure the story is standalone, so you won't really need to know too much about the universe to enjoy/understand the story. You'll probably miss out on quite a few inside jokes, though."
persona4golden,2k930j,Shaedana,3,Sat Oct 25 01:58:14 2014 UTC,I'd recommend playing P3 first. In Persona 4 Arena there was a similar situation where they mixed P3 and P4 characters and the story included heavy spoilers from both of the games.  Also you probably wouldn't enjoy the unfamiliar characters as much since they have no emotional connection to you at all.
persona4golden,2k930j,ArtificiallyIsolated,2,Sat Oct 25 03:21:41 2014 UTC,"If you are a fan of Persona 4, then 3 is always recommended. I won't spoil the stories or characters any, but the two games are very similar in gameplay and general feel.   Also, it seems like the two games are seeing a lot of crossover between each other...Cameos, The fighting game, now Q...I wouldn't be surprised to see that trend continue, and getting into Persona 3 just gives you more characters to enjoy~"
persona4golden,2k930j,fly19,1 point,Sat Oct 25 02:02:45 2014 UTC,"Honestly... I'd say no. You should definitely get some familiarity with them, because P3 has a solid story and characters, but there's a lot of frustrating gameplay decisions, like one-shot kill enemies, weird party AI, and too damn many dungeon levels to fight through. The Portable version fixed some of these complaints, and I'm ultimately glad I played through the game, but if you're the type who is cool with Let's Plays or video walkthroughs, you might want to just watch instead."
persona4golden,2k930j,MrBoobieBuyer,-3,Sat Oct 25 21:14:01 2014 UTC,"Are you afraid to acknowledge race or something? What's the point of the ""for lack of better words"" bit?"
persona4golden,2k930j,Chronotakular,2,Sat Oct 25 06:01:01 2014 UTC,"Nah. It's just the internet, people are sensitive over everything.  Like what you wrote here, for example."

persona4golden,2k5pgm,pattyville,5,Fri Oct 24 02:04:16 2014 UTC,"Basically the main character in the anime is the one that says all the things which would have been considered ""correct"" in the game. I wouldn't necessarily say you should be worried but if you played the game more as yourself or with a certain mentality rather than for the sake of ""winning"" or saying the right thing then you may find it strange. The anime is pretty great though. I would recommend both the P4 anime and P4G one, depending on what you've played."
persona4golden,2k5pgm,AngelRust,4,Fri Oct 24 02:14:08 2014 UTC,"I played through Golden, then I watched P4A and P4GA. I say that they are totally worth it, even if you don't see yourself in the character. In P4A, Yu has a rather generic personality and rarely shows emotion, aside from compassion for his friends and stress during difficult situations. He's a little more emotional in P4GA, but that never took me out of the experience. At the very least, watch P4A because it is amazing. It is tailored to the people who played the game in every way, including characters behaving how you would expect and new scenes that are really charming and funny. I cannot stress this enough, however: WATCH IT IN ENGLISH; the voice acting is excellent. And if you can, wait for P4GA to get dubbed.  tl;dr Watch P4A because it's really good and watch it in English; then wait for P4GA dub"
persona4golden,2k5pgm,Sgtbaha,1 point,Fri Oct 24 02:37:47 2014 UTC,"I would recommend watching it in Japanese, his character is certainly not generic or emotionless in the Japanese, quite the opposite. He had this quirky, eccentric can-do attitude that compliments the party really well."
persona4golden,2k5pgm,LordNephets,1 point,Fri Oct 24 18:48:24 2014 UTC,Hold up- there is infact an english dubbed version? I was starting to get into the P4GA (thought that was the only one around) but with so much dialogue I got lost in who was saying what with the subtitles... any chance you have alink or something to an english dubbed version of either?
persona4golden,2k5pgm,BrapBattle,1 point,Fri Oct 24 19:02:30 2014 UTC,"For P4A, yes there is a dub. I don't have a link, unfortunately, because I downloaded the episodes. If you google it, though, you should be able to find links to myanimenetwork or dubcrazy. Those should have it. Keep in mind, it is 26 episodes, so you might have to look around for 26, because it is a special (but canon) episode."
persona4golden,2k5pgm,Sgtbaha,2,Fri Oct 24 21:37:52 2014 UTC,"Oh sweet, thanks for the info. I really wanted to get into the -G series but being I dont typically watch anime and how quickly the subtitles went back and fourth in conversation it was tough to follow ha. Thanks again."
persona4golden,2k5pgm,BrapBattle,2,Fri Oct 24 21:55:22 2014 UTC,No prablem
persona4golden,2k5pgm,Sgtbaha,1 point,Sat Oct 25 03:07:06 2014 UTC,"I feel the same. I've only watched some of the golden anime but the MC in Arena has definitely diminished my connection to my own MC. I haven't watched the animation partly for this reason and I fear Persona Q will distance me from P3 MC who I connected with more deeply than P4's MC...  You have to decide which is more important to you, your MC or the story and the other characters. Would you like to 'spend more time' with your friends or cherish your perfect memories with them.  I have to admit there's so much additional media and spin-off games it's hard not to give up your own MC :/"

persona4golden,2jarfu,JKultra,8,Wed Oct 15 07:25:51 2014 UTC,Persona 3 Portable. Just keep in mind it's much older and clunkier game than P4G. But it'll feel extremely similar and it's worth to finish it for the story even if the controls and grind might drive you nuts occasionally.  I've also heard lot of good stuff about Danganronpa and its sequel. They seem to be story-heavy mystery games with interesting characters.  She might like Final Fantasy X/X2 but I personally couldn't stand any of the characters during the few hours I played FFX. These seem to have a huge fanbase though.
persona4golden,2jarfu,Shaedana,1 point,Wed Oct 15 08:07:20 2014 UTC,"Thanks for your answer, I heard about danganronpa too but couldn't find an unbiased review (is there such a thing) anywhere. Also the later FF games bug the hell out of me too!"
persona4golden,2jarfu,Shaedana,3,Wed Oct 15 08:22:58 2014 UTC,"Patrick from GiantBomb has  talked lot about Danganronpa in his podcast and reviewed the sequel at least. I value his opinion quite highly. He isn't biased towards silly anime games at all. He seems to appreciate them for the characters, dialogue and gripping mysteries. Too bad he hasn't started P4G yet despite intending to do so for a while now.  FFX was actually my first attempt at getting into the series. I probably would've already purchased Danganronpa if FFX hadn't disappointed me so badly. FFX seems to try too much to be something deep and meaningful. All I can see is lots of spectacle and glitter. All it took for P4G to pick my interest was Nanako slapping Dojima in embarrasment and hiding behind him when meeting the MC the first time :)"
persona4golden,2jarfu,Shaedana,3,Wed Oct 15 08:58:35 2014 UTC,"Honestly, P4G has changed my whole outlook on my vita. Every character is just perfect. ff games are just so hollow right now. I heard some of the more recent ones are better but It would need to be half the price it is for me to buy back into the franchise. I will check out GiantBomb, I appreciate the link. Looks like that's where I'll start my investigation"
persona4golden,2jarfu,LordNephets,2,Wed Oct 15 09:13:20 2014 UTC,"If you're interested in Danganronpa, Patrick's podcast is called Bombin' the AM with Scoops and The Wolf. I guess there were two episodes few weeks ago where he talked about his impressions of the sequel. If you're interested to dig months back, you can find the first game aswell.  Also if you're ever in need for some Persona 4 goodness, Giant Bomb has an entire commented playthrough of the original version. It's quite hilarious to watch after your own playthrough and also to compare how the Golden version has improved the game."

Naoto, I'd say. Chie is the best if you need a friend in your significant other. And Yukiko probably puts out like an alley cat in heat. Plus she'd probably be the best stay-at-home wife. Overall?

Working through p2 now and it's definetly going to be a bit more of a challenge. The mechanics of the game and the fighting system are really different. It's amaxing to see how many different mechanics were abandoned before p4. It will be interesting to see how they streamline the system further in p5."
persona4golden,2hjx17,usafpa,2,Wed Oct 1 22:48:10 2014 UTC,"I hope they don't streamline it anymore actually, Persona 4 Golden was just complex enough to be challenging and interesting, but simple enough so that you could make quick decisions so battles didn't last too long.  The only changes I want for Persona 5 are fully voiced social links and either the ability to alter how much XP and money you get or them to balance it so normal difficulty never requires grinding."
persona4golden,2hjx17,GameWarrior,1 point,Fri Oct 3 01:59:00 2014 UTC,"More than likely they will add something as I think p4g hit a pretty good sweet spot for all the mechanics. What I'd like to see is more creativity in dubgeon design. I thought the most interesting dungeons in p4g were the ones with non random floors. I want to see more floors like that and I want to see more dimensionality. I think p3 played with this concept well, but I want to see it fully explored. I want to climb ledges go though hidden passageways, see the floors above and below be me. Running through one flat floor after another just gets old after awhile."

I can't really put my finger on it, but it sometimes just looked off. I think it might have been the faces in some shots, they seemed to lack detail. It's not like the studio can't pull off good looking stuff, you only have to look at Aldnoah Zero (Also this season) to see that. I dunno, maybe the designs just don't translate well into animation. I also wasn't fond of how they glossed over a lot of major plot points. I know it's supposed to be a companion piece for those who have prior knowledge, but it's still really jarring in places. Also inserting Marie into places she wasn't in the game kind of rubbed me the wrong way. Don't get me wrong, I like her, but she didn't need to be in everything.   Something else that is more of a personal thing is that I think I just over exposed myself to Persona 4. Don't get me wrong, I really love Persona 4. It's probably my favourite game ever. However, I only first played Persona 4 in around August of last year. Since then, I've beaten P4 once, watched P4A, beaten P4G Twice and now watched P4GA. All of that in just over a year. I'd be lying if I said I was getting a little bored of the story. I've kind of burned myself out. I feel like I need to stay away from anything that tells the story of P4 for a long while."

I mean, Yu seemed able to summon a persona without much trouble, but he seems more like the exception than the rule. Had he told and proved the existence of the TV world to Dojima, what would have changed? The police might have used him to enter the TV world and died at the hands of a bunch of shadows. The killer might have noticed the police intervention and just stopped, causing them to lose the trail. Not to mention all the potential harm it could cause to Teddie's home!  It's much easier to just keep a small but dedicated group on the job while the police try to figure out a more reasonable expansion. Sure, things might get awkward, but overall it's for the best."

If Yu put his hand in the TV, that proves that he is able to enter the TV world, but it doesn't disprove his involvement in the kidnappings, so if anything,it could cast even more suspicion on him. At this point, Yu didn't quite know to suspect Namatame yet, and even if he did, he didn't know he could enter the TV world at the time.Adachi could enter the TV world too, but nobody really had reason to suspect him, and he can also just play dumb too.""  Also, Yu choosing not to put his hand in the TV to prove his point to Dojima ends up working in his favor since  Adachi was also in the room with him, meaning that Adachi's slip up about Namatame ""putting them in""  later on wouldn't hold much water if he had reason to believe that the TV world was a thing."

Studying is still as dull as ever, it's hard to stay optimistic and relationships never go as smoothly as in games.  I guess that's why I related so much with the P4 villain :|"
persona4golden,2frzrw,Shaedana,3,Mon Sep 8 11:16:49 2014 UTC,Studying is dull always but there are ways to fix that. I personally have a work and reward system. After a set amount of time studying I like to reward my self when I become less motivated. Some people reward themselves by doing a hobby they enjoy but I find that sidetracks me. Luckily I love history and reward myself by studying something I enjoy for a bit. It is almost never school related but I enjoy it so it is a good for me. I would recommend that you try that system to see if it works.
persona4golden,2frzrw,invaderark12,5,Mon Sep 8 11:59:45 2014 UTC,"Funny enough, P4G just yesterday helped me in a sad point in my life.  Basically, I've always had an inferiority complex. No matter what anyone tells me, I constantly think that I'm an ugly terrible PoS that no one would like (especially when it comes to dating). I just started college, and even tho during HS I kinda ignored this part of me, its been getting stronger. I finally decided to let my friends know (some people that I met at a Persona cosplay photoshoot and we've gotten close) who helped me. I refused their advice, being a stubborn dick, but I remembered my experience with P4G. It made me realize that I need to accept my true self and be more open, I've always been a loner and don't want to be myself in fear people will hate me, but the game showed me that we all have some sort of secret/repressed feelings. I did need help, I had to accept that I didn't truly knew myself as much as I thought and that my friends can help me through.  TL; DR: P4G showed me how to overcome my inferiority complex and other psychological problems with help from my Purse Owner friends."
persona4golden,2frzrw,usafpa,3,Mon Sep 8 17:30:44 2014 UTC,"Thanks for sharing. All throughout my playthrough of p4g I thought to myself that this would have a great game to play when I was in high school. I had so many social aniexities due to little issues that seem like big issues when your in high school. I think seeing things from the games perspective and see how different interactions would work with different people from different backgrounds would have helped me get over those issues faster. Instead it took years of learning and experiencing for myself before I was truly able to be comfortable with myself and others.

It's easy to forget that you're not alone, and you shouldn't need a game to remind you that you're not, but Persona is there to remind you anyway. :)  It's helped me in many ways, but even if I was still in school, I don't think I'd have studied as hard as my Yu did. :P Yosuke is there to show you what your average student behaves like, though.  I'm glad ATLUS have managed to help so many people with Persona 4, and I'm happy that the story is continuing in other games as personally, I still need them around."

Persona series have this kind of effect.I have finished Persona 3 Portable on PSP.After finishing that...I felt like an entirely diffrent person.My perspective changed.And I started to write poems,essays and stuff like that.And now,I still write and I still search who I am.Persona 3 Portable helped me to think in philosophical way.Kinda salvation to my self,to face my realself..."

These games and animations don't really fit the blank slate protagonist, because you can interact with them from the perspective of other characters. And animation series/movies aren't interactive to begin with.  P5 won't have that problem, so the MC will probably be a blank slate like the rest."

There's two things you can do; assume it is going to use Last Resort and use Defend, or you try to run from the battle (or you can be risky and try to kill it before it uses Last Resort).  Since you are in the first dungeon, I would assume its those ""dice"" looking shadows that are killing you. Try to find their weakness and focus on one at a time so you'd have a better chance of killing it before it uses Last Resort."

persona4golden,2fg9ud,Grotpar,2,Thu Sep 4 19:10:57 2014 UTC,"Well, Last Resort becomes less dangerous later on.  Just make sure to focus enemies that have last resort, and make sure your MC at least has the best armor equipped.  One ""trick"" that can help, is that if you have the option to all out attack, you can choose to relent and hit enemies that are down again(an all out attack will cause all enemies who survive to stand up, so you have to knock them down again to have a chance to dizzy them) to make them ""dizzy"". A ""dizzy"" opponent will skip their turn, giving you more time to deal with them. I believe hitting weaknesses and critting them has a greater chance to dizzy them.  For clarity's sake, I should mention that you don't need an all out attack option to get the dizzy effect. It can happen to any enemy that's down, I just mentioned it because doing all out attacks all the time is very tempting, but not always the best choice."

persona4golden,2f5jpd,mvaneijgen,3,Mon Sep 1 08:12:05 2014 UTC,"Well you have multiple slots for a reason :P  Jack Frost may have less stats, but if you have no Ice based Persona then it would be a good choice. you must also consider that Jack Frost has Ice Boost, which would give his MG the edge over Orobas when using Bufu. He also has Ice Break which can be very very handy. He can also be used to fuse Black Frost later on, who is god like, so it would be a good idea to get one eventually.   Just make sure you register Orobas in the compendium, fuse Jack Frost then go buy Orobas back, assuming you have a decent amount of money that is."
persona4golden,2f5jpd,IncendiaryLemon88,2,Mon Sep 1 08:33:48 2014 UTC,"Alright, thanks. Buying him back still means he loses the stats he has now, right?"
persona4golden,2f5jpd,IncendiaryLemon88,5,Mon Sep 1 08:35:54 2014 UTC,"Not if you register the one currently in your possession. It will be identical. You should make a habit of registering your Personas when they level up, so you always have the strongest version in your Compendium."
persona4golden,2f5jpd,Prof_doctorScientist,3,Mon Sep 1 08:38:25 2014 UTC,"A difference of a few points in stats isn't as important as having a well-rounded arsenal of personas.  In this case, having both Orobas and Jack Frost would be a good idea.  Orobas is strong to fire, and has agi and zio spells. Though weak to ice, it has the dodge ice skill. Jack Frost is strong to ice, while having bufu, zio and resist fire.  As a general rule, the best personas can only be obtained through fusion.  Try to get personas in shuffle time, then fuse any you don't need.  One last thing, be aware of a persona's arcana for the associated S.Link."
persona4golden,2f5jpd,z0nky,3,Mon Sep 1 09:12:44 2014 UTC,"Well I am not sure about P4G. But when I played P4 I fused them all whenever I could and when fusion forecast was giving some stuff to them.   Obviously sometimes I had to buy back some of the personas like when I needed electricity user or something like that. It takes some money but at normal difficulty after few runs into tv world I didn't had issues with cash. And you need to keep getting stronger what is easy to do by fusing. Sometimes you will find persona that is almost irreplaceable even after getting 10 or 20 levels higher personas. And some personas  won't be ever used at all.  And your example. Ok Jack frost has weaker stats but remember about weaknesses (I hope I used good word :P). Jack is immune to ice but weak to fire and Orobas is exact opposite. Also they have different skills so if you need ice set on protagonist it is good choice if not then you might consider only fusing in purpose of saving him in compendium. And you can't forget about fact that Jack is cute... in weird, odd way but he is!  So I guess it is good to get new ones even if you have to use your favourite/most valuable one. In fact you can summon them again through compendium right?"
persona4golden,2f5jpd,Grotpar,2,Mon Sep 1 16:17:13 2014 UTC,"Stats aren't as important as skills.  In this case Jack Frost has Ice Boost, Mabufu and will learn Bufula soon. These three spells make Jack Frost superior to Orobas, unless an enemy is immune to ice spells.  My recommendation is to look for a persona that can replace Orobas, since it can't learn any new skills, meaning that any experience you get by ending fights with it is completely wasted as the few bonus stats you get from leveling it are fairly pointless."
persona4golden,2f5jpd,Sgtbaha,1 point,Mon Sep 1 09:38:50 2014 UTC,"I did not fuse at all my first way through. I just leveled Izanagi and only used him because I thought that was canon. On NG+, when I had money and a decent Compendium, I did the fusions necessary for Margaret's social link and used a few of those personas along the way.  In short, fusion is meant to experiment with. If you're not confident in it, save beforehand to undo damage or just hold off until you have money to throw at the Compendium."

It unravelled as as a goofy comedy of errors that kept escalating until the inevitable and over-the-top resolution that had me laughing the whole time.  the OP shenanigans (showing the original animation's ""Key plus Words"" (with some tweaks) instead of Golden's opening) and the foggy, drained looking, lonely version of the ED were nice little touches as well."

But maybe differences between normal and golden would make it more interesting ;) and noone said I would have to finish this game in short time ;P  btw. there are any differences or golden only gives these additional months of gameplay?"
persona4golden,2eu3p0,TrueTinFox,1 point,Thu Aug 28 22:06:58 2014 UTC,"What's new: There's a new, romance-able character that is weaved seamlessly into the game. 2 new social links. The game map is opened up after dark. New locations to travel to throughout the game, including Okina City (prev only seen in Social Link cutscenes), beach and ski resort. Mopeds! Your house now has a garden that so you can grow vegetables and use them in the dungeon. There are new endings and a new epilogue for the true ending. Plus countless tweaks to gameplay, improving the experience substantially. Additionally, there are ""DVD extra"" like features including all the trailers, music clips, and a trivia game."

The whole social links thing, in a kind of geeky way, helped me to get out and make new friends. 2014 has been great so far!"
persona4golden,2egdln,im_cody,2,Mon Aug 25 09:50:21 2014 UTC,"I can't say that Naoto specifically hit home, but yeah, Persona 4 is definitely helpful in ways that other games aren't.   I think it's funny because most of what I grapple with IS anxiety, but Naoto doesn't showcase it specifically as far as I can see.   Persona 4 helped me with my anxiety by showing me a thing I didn't quite realize... regardless of who they are or what their status is, everyone has a dark side. Everyone has things that they hide or bury or wish were not their own. When I see people, when I meet them and interact with them, they always seem normal because I don't know them. There isn't a person who hasn't struggled with their doubts and insecurities.   Similar themes are present in the Xenosaga series; Nephilim held the sentiment that we can't just be the good things. We can't just accept the good things. Life is both good and bad, and people are both good and bad. A person who denies half of themselves is not a whole person.   It's okay to be who you are and to not feel bad for it, even if who you are is conventionally evil; being evil doesn't make you a bad person, in the same way that going to church on sunday doesn't make you a pillar of the community."

persona4golden,2dpf5l,Nevets323,6,Sat Aug 16 07:02:33 2014 UTC,"because in a small town, fewer people could have a larger impact.  on the izanagis, without getting too deep into mythology, izanagi and izanami were husband and wife turned enemies, so when izanami awakened persona powers in people, they got an izanagi that reflected their personality, Izanagi-no-Okami for the mc, Magatsu (dark) izanagi for adachi. presumably Namatame would have received an izanagi too, but he never awakened a persona."
persona4golden,2dpf5l,AndyF1996,2,Sat Aug 16 14:16:03 2014 UTC,"Basically what Andy said below me, and also by chance that Namatame, Adachi, and the MC all passed through the gas station and shook her hand. When you run through her dungeon, she says that MC represents hope, Namatame represents despair, and Adachi represents emptiness.  Now, Adachi is sort of an unique case. Although introduced in Persona 4 Golden, his Arcana is the ""Jester"" which shares the same number as MC's Arcana, ""Fool"", so they're basically flip sides of the same card. Adachi was corrupted and twisted by his power and his Izanagi became Magatsu Izanagi as a result. It is believed that Namatame was also able to summon Izanagi, but according to the Wiki, ""he was possessed by his own Shadow, which transformed after merging with other Shadows into the entity called Kunino-sagiri."" Adachi accepted and acknowledged his own Shadow (which is why you see his eyes take on a yellow hue when you fight him) and was able to summon a corrupted Persona as a result."
persona4golden,2dpf5l,WhatTheSwann,1 point,Sat Aug 16 20:31:23 2014 UTC,it's also believed in Japanese mytho that Izanagi before closing Izanami in Yomi for all entiernity wasn't that pure either thus Adachi has a tainted form of Izanagi known as Magatsu-Izanagi (禍津伊弉諾) which means Calamity Haven Izanagi.

persona4golden,2d2r26,snesfriend,5,Sat Aug 9 15:56:13 2014 UTC,"This may not be what you're looking for exactly, but I recommend playing Fire Emblem: Awakening. It had a similar feel to P4G in some aspects.  - A memorable and interesting set of characters and getting closer to them little by little while fighting together. Also you get to choose a partner. - Quite an entertaining story in which you play a big role. At times it's cliche and ridiculous, but it also made me cry and laugh and excited nonetheless :) - Amazing music and cutscenes."
persona4golden,2d2r26,Shaedana,5,Sat Aug 9 23:55:21 2014 UTC,"If you really liked Persona for the characters, I always love recommending the Zero Escape series.  999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors and Virtue's Last Reward are visual novel style puzzle/adventure games that have strong characters and interesting plots.  I've beaten all the endings in 999 (which is kind of required to get the whole story) and only a handful of the routes in VLR but they're pretty great.  They also are pretty straightforward in getting to the story content if you want a different style of game.  I always recommend that people play Catherine as well as it's another game put out by the Persona team responsible for Persona 3 and 4.  If you're looking for other SMT games with similar characters, there's the Devil Survivor series.  DS Overclocked and the forthcoming enhanced remake of DS2 are both on 3ds, and really great ways to transition into mainline SMT as they cover a lot of the main themes while still being character and story driven.  SMT III Nocturne for Ps2 (or on PSN for PS3) is a fantastic game, but you'll find that it's much less character and plot driven.  You witness and live through the apocalypse and become the most important force in recreating the world (as is a general SMT theme).  There's no voice acting, but the music, setting and characters are all very interesting.  The gameplay is a bit more challenging mechanically, but still very satisfying.  It's quite a long game, so it might be a lot to play right after P4G, although it's still very different.  There's also Digital Devil Saga 1/2 and Devil Summoner Raidou Kuzunoha games, but I haven't beaten them so I don't have a lot of examples that I can use to recommend them.  If you can explain what you liked specifically about P4G, I could probably give some more recommendations."
persona4golden,2d2r26,pezki,1 point,Sun Aug 10 02:10:49 2014 UTC,I havent played catherine but i watched all the cutscenes on youtube. I think the reason i liked persona4g so much was based on the relatable  characters and the interesting story. The battle system to be completely honest i thought wasn't too fun. I don't think i would enjoy nocturne if its more based on the gameplay aspect. I have been hearing a lot more about visual novels recently and ive heard virtue's last reward was almost saw esk. I have never been one for puzzle games but im willing to try it.

I hear good things about SMT 4 on 3DS. If you're in the US it might be pretty cheap since it's pretty old, but if you're in the EU, it's coming out pretty soon, for also pretty cheap, £18 (20 Euros). I have also heard good things about the Digital Devil Saga. I've played the first half hour or so of it and it has some familiar elements. Both of the Digital Devil Saga games are on PS2 so are also pretty cheap if you look around on eBay They also have them on PSN for cheap too. You could also go the emulation route too if you have a powerful enough PC."

I think the first one might be useful for fusions late on the game, but if you feel you need it again, you can summon it from the compendium."

Either way, check if you can't fuse any Personas you don't need into something useful. Then just grind for like two levels and try again. It's what I've been doing on Normal in P4G and Hard in P3P, and I didn't even bother with cross-spread fusion or anything higher. You really don't need any elaborate setups."

persona4golden,2c73u8,GranaT0,2,Thu Jul 31 10:58:57 2014 UTC,"iirc, King Frost learns better frost skills than Jack. I'm assuming you put all your team members on Direct Commands, so you should be able to defeat most bosses easily if you defeat all enemies on every floor. You should probably make Yukiko use Media whenever more than two party members get hurt (Dia otherwise) if you're not doing that already. Keeping your entire party at full HP should really help if you're not severely underleveled."
persona4golden,2c73u8,Omegron757,2,Fri Aug 1 01:24:22 2014 UTC,Are you using Kanji? I found that while using Kanji Shadow Teddie was rather easy. I was able to beat Shadow Teddie once while I was about level 24 by just keeping Yu and Kanji alive. Kanji is able to tank a whole lot while doing damage while you just make sure that Yu keeps healing himself (and Kanji once he gets low enough).

Chie (due to her ice resistance) and Kanji (due to his HP) will be able to tank a lot of hits. Only worry is Yukiko, but you need her for healing. Heal when needed with her, guard the rest. Only attack with her when you are positive you have Shadow Teddie almost dead. You are in the right level range too. The main problem here is your Personas. You definitely need to be fusing like crazy. King Frost will be more than useful for the fight, so keep him. Everyone else? Fuse. Fuse fuse fuse. Not trying to sound mean or anything, but if Shadow Teddie is giving you trouble, then the next boss will give you HELL! Just keep going as you are, but remember to fuse."

persona4golden,2boggc,usafpa,4,Fri Jul 25 09:36:58 2014 UTC,"Man, I'm so conflicted on this show. As someone who is very familiar with Persona 4, I am enjoying the show, but looking at it from the perspective of someone who isn't, the show is a mess. Characters just appearing out of nowhere, the main plot being almost completely ignored and the characters are under developed. I dunno. I get what they are going for, but I think unless a show is a direct sequel, it should be able to stand on it's own.   I think it would be interesting, after the show has finished, for someone to figure out exactly where exactly each of these episodes fits in the Persona 4 The Animation timeline, and then watch through chronologically to see how well the 2 shows mesh."
persona4golden,2boggc,IncendiaryLemon88,3,Fri Jul 25 21:55:35 2014 UTC,Someone on the Megaten subreddit has said that they are splicing together these episodes with the original Persona 4 animation to make a complete series.

persona4golden,2boggc,AngelRust,2,Fri Jul 25 16:15:58 2014 UTC,I'm kind of conflicted. I like what they're doing with Marie and how they're incorporating her into it. It's a little different but that's probably the best way they can do it.  The beach part was probably my favourite part in the game and I found it far funnier than it actually is. I definitely liked how they pulled it off this past episode.  What I'm waiting for is a possible fsteak reference in the anime although  I don't know if it'll happen. They did include it in P4G so it is kind of canon but whether it will be considered in the anime is a different story cause of regions and all that.
persona4golden,2boggc,Chaochio,1 point,Fri Jul 25 16:20:17 2014 UTC,"About the Fsteak, it's entirely possible that was part of the localization. I never played through the game in Japanese, so I don't know for sure, but if that's the case I doubt we'll be seeing the reference in the Japanese dub if at all."
persona4golden,2boggc,AngelRust,2,Sat Jul 26 01:26:10 2014 UTC,That's what I was thinking since Hiimdaisy is in English. Hopefully if they ever English Dub P4GA then they may add that in. It's nothing really huge but kind of a funny reference. I'm still amazed they added it into P4G in the first place. Got to love when they actually pay attention to the fans.

persona4golden,2bjvfu,Sgtbaha,9,Thu Jul 24 02:01:19 2014 UTC,"I'm actually happy they kept Persona 4 with a male only protagonist option. I wasn't too crazy about FeMC in P3P, I just don't see why they did it. And part of me just thinks Persona makes more sense with a male protagonist.   As much as I would love to fulfill my fantasy of having Yosuke as my boyfriend.../cough/...I like it the way it is/was. Though I do agree Persona 5 will probably have the gender option."
persona4golden,2bjvfu,Sgtbaha,3,Thu Jul 24 04:10:24 2014 UTC,"While I agree, this would have been super awesome, we should look at the logistics of it.  Were they to add a female MC, they would have had to alter many of the slinks, changed all of the cutscenes to involve the FeMC, and done voice over for said FeMC, not to mention all the modeling they'd have to do for the combat animations and costumes.  That's a lot of work they would have had to do for not that high of a reward (in terms of new content.) If you look at P3P's FeMC for example, there's really no new content outside of maybe three or four new/changed slinks. Other than that, the story is largely unchanged, and doesn't really feel ""new and exciting"" as much as ""the same game with a slightly different look"" because of how much work implementing the second gender actually took.  With that said, I am almost certain that P5 will have a male and female protag available to choose from from the get go."
persona4golden,2bjvfu,builderkid107,2,Thu Jul 24 02:14:16 2014 UTC,"I completely agree. The game does a good job of not using gender specific pronouns referring to the character, so there wouldn't have been much to change. The biggest thing would be Nanako referring to the MC as ""Big Sis."" xarel mentions that this would have meant a longer development cycle, but I could wait a year for fem-Yu, and it wouldn't even take that long."

persona4golden,2bjvfu,Shaedana,1 point,Wed Aug 13 16:48:02 2014 UTC,P4 story is built around male character. It would suffer too much if they tried to have a female option. There wouldn't be enough love intrests besides Yosuke and sports club. Teddie is a kid and Kanji is gay.  ...oh wait-  Would this mean I can have Adachi?! SOLD! 8D
persona4golden,2bjvfu,theHamJam,1 point,Thu Jul 24 13:15:06 2014 UTC,"There's a harem aspect that goes along with a lot of modern, teenager anime, but besides that, not really sure how it's ""built around [a] male character."" Qualified love interests would be: Yosuke, Teddie, Kanji, Kou/Daisuke, Naoki, probably Adachi, and maybe even Shu since FeMC got away with being a pedophile too. That's seven. Equal to being able to date  Chie, Yukiko, Rise, Naoto, Ai, Yumi/Ayane, and Margret. Furthermore for Golden they could throw in Dante (or another like him) for Margret and they would create Marie as a man since that's the canon love interest. Potentially bringing the number of dateable characters up to a nine.   And Teddie's age is never given, however, he is very clearly at the same social and maturity level of the rest of the team so we can assume he's 15-17. Kanji's sexuality has always been left up to player interpretation, but given that he goes both ways (hitting on Yukiko, loving Naoto) that heavily implies bisexual and not gay."
persona4golden,2bjvfu,SpajX,1 point,Fri Jul 25 16:35:45 2014 UTC,"Kanji is so close to being gay it would be awkward dating him as FeMC. I mean his whole dungeon, other self and how he was introduced to the group screams homosexuality.  Yosuke's personality and actions are heavily tied to his feelings for Saki, I wouldn't feel like trying to get into his pants either.  Teddie's body is a total unknown. We weren't technically able to get Aigis as our girlfriend, and Teddie's situation is worse IMO. I haven't played FeMC far enough but I sure wasn't impressed when I heard she was gonna date Ken..  I'm trying to say that to make these characters boyfriends would require lot of compromises and bending their personalities. While all the female characters were created to be loved. For example in P3P I would've liked to choose Junpei as my BF but the story got in the way. Also after all the time we spent together he still got jealous and pissed at me also because the story said so. It felt really jarring. Also all the stuff with Aigis seemed weird with FeMC. It isn't simple at all to create a new MC out of the blue."

In this mode, P4AU players will be able to navigate super-deformed avatars around online lobbies decorated to resemble places in the world of Persona 4 -- such as the school or the Junes shopping mall.

persona4golden,2aorxu,ethanw12,2,Mon Jul 14 18:25:51 2014 UTC,"Instead of looking for ways to replenish sp, try conserving it. Especially on very easy, there's no need to continually target enemy weaknesses, because you're just sucking up sp when it's not necessary. Remember that every character has just a regular attack, and that many have at least one physical attack.  Also try to keep in mind that you don't need to end every encounter in one turn. Use physical skills and regular attacks to target one enemy at a time and just take their health bars down normally. Even if you get hit a couple of times, it's much cheaper sp-wise to heal up after a battle than to cast 3 or 4 magical spells."
persona4golden,2aorxu,Vitefish,1 point,Mon Jul 14 19:05:53 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. Is there any rhyme or reason to the card shuffles? I always feel like I only get new personas/skills/etc whenever I've done something exceptional in battle (knocking down all opponents, exploiting weaknesses, etc) but maybe I'm imagining that."
persona4golden,2aorxu,Shaedana,2,Mon Jul 14 19:15:50 2014 UTC,Card shuffles happen more often if you perform all-out attacks or critical hits.
persona4golden,2aorxu,Vitefish,1 point,Mon Jul 14 23:58:23 2014 UTC,"I've never played Golden, so I don't know much about the card system, sorry!"
persona4golden,2aorxu,Alocide,1 point,Mon Jul 14 19:56:10 2014 UTC,"More specifically, the shuffles usually occur when you end a battle with an all out attack. If I remember correctly, there is a card that pops up in the shuffle that replenishes HP/SP. It's a small fraction of your totals, but those little bits can add up if you're able to get a string of shuffles going. Otherwise, follow Vitefish's advice in getting physical when you know you need your SP later. Enjoy =)"
persona4golden,2aorxu,deshypothequiez,2,Tue Jul 15 18:18:08 2014 UTC,"In early game, SP conservation is key. SP items are rare throughout the game and should really only be used in emergencies, since you don't know when you're gonna get another one (and you can't buy them). Since you're on very easy, you should have plenty of money to buy HP recovery items as well, to save on healing spells. Save your SP for boss battles as much as possible to exploit their weaknesses.  Ironically, later in the game, it's (arguably) better to use spells on normal enemies to exploit weaknesses and physical attacks on bosses since later bosses don't have elemental weaknesses, but by the time this begins to happen you don't need to worry about conservation so much. Healing spells are also much more useful later in the game since recovery items generally heal a fixed amount instead of a percentage like spells do."
persona4golden,2aorxu,IncendiaryLemon88,1 point,Mon Jul 14 20:30:25 2014 UTC,"Normally, if I'm running dry, I just teleport out of the dungeon and come back in the next in game day. Assuming you aren't going for a 100% S. Link run, you should have plenty of time to go in and out the dungeon as you please, and still have time to maintain social links. The game is quite lenient with the amount of time it gives you to rescue people. Another tip, as some have said, is to just hit guys with normal attacks sometimes. A good SP conversation strategy is to only use elemental weaknesses. For example, if an enemy is weak to fire, use physical attacks for everyone, then when it comes to Yukkiko use a Agi spell, then either use your all out attack or 1 more to finish the job.  I hoped this helped!"

persona4golden,2am37t,DaRushMan,2,Sun Jul 13 21:46:17 2014 UTC,"completely feasible. theres so much time free in january/february in golden that you can afford to take an extra day when you really need to reasonably often. unlike in P4, you can avoid most regular shadow fights and focus on gold shadows almost all game for exp, and the 50 damage elemental items make exploiting weaknesses without SP use a breeze anyway, so SP isnt too grave a worry if youre clever with that too. keep notes of what points you need with S links so you can intelligently use lunches and stuff for bonus points, and you might even be able to do it without a guide."

I was hoping it would be a remake of the original anime that included the new parts from P4G, but that's clearly not the case here. It only really cares about Marie and Yu's relationship, so much so that all of the other characters end up taking a backseat to said relationship. That's very off-putting, considering the main cast of characters are the reason most of us have fallen in love with the game in the first place. I get what the anime is going for, I'm just not a fan of it."
persona4golden,2adc12,bekenotbecky,2,Thu Jul 10 22:08:46 2014 UTC,"It also includes all the Golden Exclusive scenes like going to the beach and the Ski trip, so it's not like we won't get anything but marie"

persona4golden,2adc12,mastachaos,2,Fri Jul 11 14:27:30 2014 UTC,Seeing as the Japanese audio is available for P4GA and the voice actors are the same through both P4A and P4GA it'll likely be Japanese audio with English subs throughout. The only oddity I foresee is Yu's demeanor changing between the cuts.
persona4golden,2adc12,Hunwin,0,Fri Jul 11 14:36:43 2014 UTC,That's a bummer (I don't speak Japanese).  Do we know if P4GA will be getting English audio at some point?

I was hoping it would be a complete remake, so I sat down with a friend (completely new to the series) and she was completely lost. It's a shame, I want them to remake it in its entirety because the original anime was rather sub-par in my opinion, but the art style makes up for it.

Honestly, my first ending was me screwing up December 3, but not doing the deed.  My friend gave me the vague hint that everyone needs to calm down.  After a few tries, I got it.  I would say to let your friend do it naturally until he encounters an ending, whichever one it is. Then you might want to tell him to go back to the night of December 3rd and redo it until he unlocks the rest of the game through the correct dialogue choices. Try to interfere with his experience as little as possible, especially when it comes to the plot."

persona4golden,2a4ldi,slothlover3000,3,Tue Jul 8 08:01:22 2014 UTC,"P3P is a PSP game, so the graphics aren't as clean as P4G. It still looks fine though.  Combat is almost identical to P4G. The biggest difference otherwise is that the majority of the game is done with a visual novel style. You navigate town with a kind of point and click interface. There are also no animated cut-scenes aside from a few that are done in-engine.   The story of P3 is pretty different from P4 in tone. P3 becomes pretty dark and oppressive, and your team isn't as close of a group as the investigation team in P4. They are more like colleagues than friends for the most part.  Both games are really good, they just offer different experiences. If you like P4G then you'll probably enjoy P3P as well."
persona4golden,2a4ldi,tracarri,1 point,Tue Jul 8 08:44:51 2014 UTC,"To add to it, the biggest difference between p4 and p3 (same goes for p4g and p3p) other then story and theme was the dungeon.  In P4, you felt the need to complete each dungeons before a certain date, since otherwise it would lead to gameover.  P3 however doesn't exactly force you to go further into the dungeon until a certain part, in which then you might feel overwhelmed if you were too behind. I don't remember how p3 dungeons were exactly like, since it's been a while, but iirc that's how I felt."
persona4golden,2a4ldi,kanarin,1 point,Tue Jul 8 10:13:41 2014 UTC,"Yeah, P3 kind of expects you to set your own pace as far as dungeons go. It's technically one giant dungeon, but it opens up in blocks.  You also find teleporters every so often that let you warp to certain floors. After several floors you'll eventually hit a dead end that doesn't open until the story progresses, and then the next block will open up."
persona4golden,2a4ldi,tracarri,1 point,Tue Jul 8 16:12:43 2014 UTC,"I found Tartarus to be mind numbly boring.  Because you're not 'forced' into Tartarus until near the end of the game, it's hard to get a good sense of how over or under leveled you are for the monthly bosses, and frankly, 200+ floors of dungeons is exhausting.   Like, if you add every dungeon floor together in P4, it's still less floors than P3's dungeon by like 160."
persona4golden,2a4ldi,JancariusSeiryujinn,1 point,Sat Sep 6 18:49:09 2014 UTC,"I definitely agree. I was pretty sick of Tartarus about 2/3 of the way through the game my first time. Though, P3P does borrow a bit from P4 to make it a little less tedious. In P3P you can resume exploring from the last floor you were on instead of having to use the teleporter and repeating the same floors to get back to where you were. I think you might also be able to use the P4 style menu command to go up a floor after you discover the stairs, but I could be wrong. It's been a while."
persona4golden,2a4ldi,tracarri,2,Sun Sep 7 18:57:25 2014 UTC,"P4G is better overall, but at least in my case the highs of P3P were 'higher' than the highs in P4G. That said, P3P drove me into frustration, rage and indifference way more than I was prepared to. Too much insta-deaths, grinding and the story only gets good just before the end.. Still, the characters are good in their own ways and S.Links are better than in P4G IMO.  It's definitely worth it. Just be aware what you're getting into."
persona4golden,2a4ldi,Shaedana,1 point,Tue Jul 8 18:06:25 2014 UTC,"I bought P3P after playing P4G and I enjoyed/completed it, but there are some issues I had.  I'll answer your questions: 1. One of my biggest issues.  To make it portable now opposed to being able to walk around the city/dorm you now navigate menus essentially and that turned me off a LOT.  to some it's probably not that big of a deal, but it is a negative compared to the console version. 2. Gameplay is very consistent with P4G however Tartarus feels waaay more grindy and repetitive than going into the TV and doing those dungeons. 3. Story is likely the strongest point. Characters, plot, and setting are all good and is much darker than P4G and has a more doom and gloom feel which isn't a bad thing.  It's comparable in the way it's told but not much else. However I much prefer the P4 characters, Inaba, and the fog murders/tv dimension plot. 4. P4G, hands down, no contest.  P3P is a great game, but P4G is an improvement in almost every way.    My suggestion would be if you really really enjoyed P4G, then you won't regret buying P3P, but don't expect it to be as good as P4G."

persona4golden,29ijqa,PieStyle,1 point,Wed Jul 9 22:45:44 2014 UTC,"Well I was on Expert on vanilla P4 so he was pretty devastating especially realizing he gets two turns each round.  I had my final party decided by this point. Teddie, Yosuke, and Yukiko. Teddie since he learns mediarama and matarukaja so early as well as marakukaja later on and I put blessed hands on him so he could full heal the whole party each turn. Yukikos media really doesn't cut it here. Teddie is also a Godsend since his default move energy shower cures exhaustion which Mitsuo inflicts a lot in that fight via bombs.  Also when in his 2nd phase whatever color wall he puts up indicates what element he will use. So if he used white wall I had Yukiko guard each turn until he went into his ailment phase which happens either after the wall wears off or he starts to rebuild.  You can't let him hit anyones weaknesses or he follows up with megidola and then still gets his 2nd turn to attack which totals up to 3 hits. That usually means gameover.  Also if you want to avoid him rebuilding and learning gigadyne mid fight then you need to deal enough damage to him while he's rebuilding so I would have mc cast rakunda at that point and have teddie cast matarukaja. At that point the next time it's your parties turn your damage output will be high enough to knock him out of the rebuilding in one round easily and get an all out attack.  If you don't have teddie don't hesitate to have yosuke or whoever is your weakest damage dealer to use an assault signal for the mataru effect if you have any, although even just rakunda might be enough.  As far as highest possible damage output for mc goes black frost is the way to go since he gets mind charge and fire amp from s. link xp alone at that point. You can train him to learn Agidyne but if you don't like grinding then his maragion is more than enough.  Also don't hesitate to use hell magatamas and such if you have no buffs or debuffs applied since they deal a flat 150 damage regardless of defense and will be a lot better than a garula from yosuke for knocking him out of his rebuild phase."

Use Mind Charge if you want."

Also it includes the FemMc which IMO much better than the male route(A more outgoing happy character+Koro-chan social link).  But if you are getting into Persona from P1 or P2 or if you are just getting into the series, Go for P3FES as it is an enjoyable experience and you will also have the answer, which wraps up a lot of loose ends."

I bought P3P a few weeks ago and I have been enjoying it a lot more. It's much closer to P4 in terms of gameplay, but you do miss out on the cutscenes, which are replaced with a graphic novel style of storytelling. You also miss out on The Answer, which is adds a new dungeon IIRC, but from what I have heard form some other people, it isn't very good anyway."

Favorite ending is Memories of You, since it has quite unique tempo and mixture of happiness and sadness. Also it's pretty much written from Aigis' point of view which makes it extra special to me.  One of my fav tracks is Voice Someone Calls, it's just so unsettling. My fav dungeon track is Long Way, it alternates nicely between menacing and heroic atmosphere. Fav battle music is a tough one, maybe I'll Face Myself since it's so iconic. Most annoying is Poem for Everyone's Souls, too much is just too much.. Most unforgettable and strongest reaction I had with Burn My Dread: Last Battle. It made the ending so awesome and it still gives me chills :)  I hope that P5 will have it's own distinct style.

Without spoiling anything hopefully, the game CAN be very meticulous at times and sometimes you'll spend much more time or much less time pending on your playstyle, but I'd wager that as long as you're watching most important events, even skipping chatting with unimportant npcs and skipping boring unimportant npc events like two random students chatting about current events, I'm sure you'll spend at least 40 hours on the first playthrough as long as you avoid the bad end.   Second one, yes. Very much yes. The Persona series has a lot of ties and references and nods to the other games, but NOTHING is needed to know going into 1, 3, or 4. Can't speak for 2 since I've only played one of the two games titled Persona 2.   Anywho, there are a lot of nods and outright re-appearances to other characters from previous games and while the stories DO travel on the same timeline, you can play JUST Persona 4 and experience the entire game without having played the rest to get the full experience."

I would avoid looking it up tho cuz there's some pretty significant spoilers about a certain thing thrown around when this question is brought up that kinda takes away from the ""first playthrough"" experience.  As for how to make the most of a second playthrough tbh if you did not max your personal stats(courage, knowledge etc.etc.) it will not be IDEAL but there's certainly things u can do better.  -Never spend hermit or sun links except on rainy days. They're the only ones u can do when it's raining.  Try to go to dungeons on rainy days that you don't spend with them(or better yet thunderstorm days). This gets you more rare materials and rare shadows appearing in said dungeons.  -When asked if you want to go home at the very end of the game. Say no. That's all i will say.  -use the fortune box/night time talks to make social link stuff much easier.  -hospital and tutoring part time jobs are actually social links. So if you avoided ptjs in your first playthrough do those at least  -Do your party members social links before 11/27 and try to do the dojima/nanako links when you get the opportunities(since they're at night anyways). Much easier if u have maxed expression.  -Keep your persona list with personas that match the links you'll be working on. (magician for yosuke for example) Some people tend to ignore this :p  Probably missing several things but that's all i got for now."

And Chihiro because she's a complete freak, but in a very likeable kind of way.  So, yeah, screw these characters to be honest. P4G everyone had a soft inner centre. I don't see it in P3F. I mean yes, they each have a reason for being screwed up, but unlike P4G I don't think I'd have these people as friends in real life. P3F characters would not last past a first hanging out session."
persona4golden,27m4wz,im_cody,6,Mon Jun 9 04:29:13 2014 UTC,"Personally I think P3 has a much better story and much better characters. I love both games, and both are amazing for different reasons. 3 has characters who just don't get along well. Yukari and Mitsuru/Junpei, Junpei and MC, Ken and Shinji. The thing that got me is that, if you mix 10 random people together in a room for a year, there is a big chance that some people will click, and others wont.   Add in that these characters have pasts with each other, some of which being pretty harsh, it's obviously going to create drama. The thing about P3 is that each character feels a bit unique and Fes/3 did it the best by not allowing you to give direct orders. From a gameplay standpoint, it sucked, but from a story telling standpoint it worked really well.   Stupid Junpei for always forgetting who was weak to what. Stupid ass always trying to grandstand and going for killing blows over knocking shadows down. Mitsuru and her MARIN FUCKING KARIN! Forget healing, it was more important to charm this enemy. Etc, etc.   I'll give you that Yukari is a bitch. She just flat out is and that is more or less her character. She treats Junpei like shit for being friendly, she treats Mitsuru like shit for being/smart/popular, and she treats MC like shit in her dates by always putting herself first. She's a self centered high school girl. Sounds pretty spot on to me. Yeah, she's pretty damn annoying, like mocking Junpei during the DECISION event about if he's ""afraid"". But you can't say she doesn't have character, and while she is fairly self centered, she does have some nice moments. Junpei is the same way. The guy is a nobody, not good in school, a total slacker, and is thinking the same thing all guys thought at his age, he just has the balls to hit on girls instead of crush from afar.   Junpei's arc from 2nd banana to wannabe leader, to coup de etat, and finally rounding around back to a trusted friend. I really like Junpei and his character. He's dense sure, but he kinda fits a high school kid's attitude.   As for the rest, I'll give you that Mitsuru can fall flat, even on her Slink she's not the most interesting and I do wish she got a little more personality, I'll take a bland character like Mitsuru over a bland character like Yukiko with a whacky gimmick to make her less bland.   For Persona 3, I think the tone was much more serious and it seemed like most of the cast were fairly mature, yes even Junpei when he needed to be while 4 was more of a goofy romp through Inaba with some friendly and love-able characters. Notice that in 3, MC does piss off or bug multiple party members through the game, nothing huge, but he does manage to get on their nerves even without directly saying anything. In 4? You can be the biggest jerk to Yosuke and he will still offer to blow you every chance he gets. Outside of two instances, no party member ever really get's mad, upsets with, or jealous of the MC.   Hell, if you REALLY think about it, Junpei and Yosuke are extremely similar. Shitty with girls, but it's all they seem to think about. Also ""new kid"" like MC and try to buddy up with them cuz they're good guys. Both magician, both are dense, don't study, do terrible in school, and offer a lot of comic relief throughout the series. The only difference if Junpei gets jealous and doesn't hold it in like a certain someone's lvl 10 social link. If Yosuke didn't have to be the mouthpiece for MC for the first 2/3rds of the game, he'd have probably been a lot less buddy buddy with MC of 4. The fact Yosuke even starts to GET mouthy with you during the Nametame scene is evidence enough.   I love the P3 and P4 games, and both sets of characters have their own faults and positive points I think.   TL;DR- Opinions."

I don't disagree with anything you said... maybe 3 is too real for me then. I have enough drama in real life, I don't need friends in a video game squabbling. 4 felt like (a great) family, maybe that's why I liked it so much even if to other people it was less realistic!

I wish I had a group of friends like the ones in P4 though and a lot of times I play through 4 and think, man, I wish I had someone like Yosuke in my life who utterly believes in me no matter what.   4's characters ARE great, but they tiptoe onto the line of ""perfect"" characters despite the theme of 4 being ""facing your shadow"". Yosuke, whose shadow shows him to be just a bored kid who is basically a young >INSERT BIG BADGUY HERE<, but turns out to be nothing like said guy.   But you have a point man, while it's nice to have the real characters who feel kind of alive, nothing trumps that ending in 4 when everyone sees you off. :)  Edit: how to spoiler @_@"

persona4golden,27jav9,GameBoy09,12,Sat Jun 7 07:43:24 2014 UTC,I highly doubt it. Slavery doesn't imply race.
persona4golden,27jav9,tranzart,0,Sat Jun 7 07:57:52 2014 UTC,"While true, Slavery and Race go hand in hand sometimes. Usually Slaves were of minorities that were captured and made to serve royalty. That same royalty sees those slaves as filth, which turns into Racism.   Of course the conflict itself wouldn't be directly about Slavery. But it might be something of that the character is slightly racist and he/she don't actually know it. Maybe that person is being bullied because of their race, and in return is racist to the bullies.   This is purely hypothetical of course."
persona4golden,27jav9,kanarin,8,Sat Jun 7 08:04:10 2014 UTC,"But you have to acknowledge that Persona is in the end an Eastern game, and more so, an anime game.  Racism is a big thing every where no doubt, but you just don't see much of that as an anime trope. The hint of homosexuality in Persona 4 is still recognized as a bigger part of the anime culture (yaoi, yuri etc.) than that of racism.  It's not entirely impossible, but it would surprise me if racism actually showed up.  Edit: I guess in a sense, ""racism"" does show up in certain anime tropes, but the only ones I can think of are things like valkyria chronicles."
persona4golden,27jav9,MithosSama,2,Sat Jun 7 08:20:18 2014 UTC,"Seeing as they already touch a whole bunch of 'dangerous topics' such as homosexuality and transgender, I wouldn't be surprised if racism was one character's issue.  But it's also likely that they are slaves in different ways. Slaves to their bad behaviour, slaves to their fate, BDSM.. I think all of these subjects will make an appearance. After all, why just one?"
persona4golden,27jav9,Shaedana,2,Sat Jun 7 09:03:06 2014 UTC,"I hope the word 'slave' is used figuratively. I hope whatever issues these characters face are something that originates from themselves and can't be solved entirely, like depression and warped self-image.  P3 focused too much on 'person X has died, cope with it'. This got really repetitive and it isn't the best way to build character since there's very little they can do but to accept it, (I actually loved The Answer, it had nice back and forth tension regarding this issue).  P4 had the 'perfect life' problem. Even though each of the characters had issues, most of them was solved by having amazing group of friends magically there to give them a hand. Sure, that is the theme of the game... but the reason I liked the culprit was that his situation seemed tragicly realistic. There shouldn't always be a solution and a happy ending, even after facing yourself.  Sorry about the semi-off-topic.. I just think it's 'boring' that racism is always wrong, there's no room for debate. Also it's a threat from outside source and dealing with it wouldn't add much to the victim's character arc. Unless one of the main characters was the racist, then it might be interesting."

Although she believes in one course of action, she finds out there is more than one way to reach the desired result. As far as character growth goes, I'd say that's a pretty good thing.

I love replaying the games, (I mean I have played P3 FES, P3P, P4, P4G.  The vita also gives you access to the rest of the Persona series as well as a lot of games I think a Persona fan would appreciate (namely Zero's Escape Virtue's Last Reward and Danganronpa and the upcoming Persona 4 Dancing All Night).  Those are the closest in theme/character development to Persona.  I've had a ton of fun with the vita, but you really should see what PSP games are available on it too."
persona4golden,26h64r,pezki,1 point,Mon May 26 05:52:24 2014 UTC,"I bought a Vita specifically for P4G as I had just beat P3FES on my PS3, try looking for second hand Vitas on ebay! I managed to pick one up for £80 (normal price being around £140-150 I believe) that worked fine! Also I realised there are a few cool games coming out that I probably won't see on another system, to name one, Super dangan ronpa 2!  The extra story you get with Golden is great and I hear a lot of people say that the game now doesn't feel complete if it isn't the golden version."
persona4golden,26h64r,CplGunshow,1 point,Tue May 27 12:32:44 2014 UTC,"I know this was posted a week or so ago, but I'm gonna respond anyways.  I think that you should wait a while. For the most part, the game is the same. The story is the same (but with more social links and a few more endings).   I also think that you could get the Vita now, and play some other games on there, Soul Sacrifice, Virtue's Last Reward, Conception II, and a few other great games and then play Persona 4 Golden. It is a great game, but the story is pretty much the same, and you don't want it getting stale on you."
persona4golden,26hc2x,Serenity_Undead,3,Sun May 25 23:50:22 2014 UTC,"Did you get the TRUE ending? It sounds like you didn't, so go look up to how. It involves answering a specific way when the crew is talking about what to do with a certain someone. Hopefully you made an extra save when they warned you, and if you did just load up that one and follow a guide to get the true ending. It should resolve a lot of problems. Also maxing Marie's slink gets you an extra dungeon towards the end of the game so try doing that in NG+ but the Marie arc is a side story so no it would not help."
persona4golden,26hc2x,bauran,2,Sun May 25 23:59:03 2014 UTC,....I am REALLY glad I asked.
persona4golden,26hc2x,bauran,2,Mon May 26 00:15:21 2014 UTC,Yeah this is one of the dumbest parts of P4 imo. I like the idea of multiple endings but they should at least all be good not 2 bad endings and then a good ending.
persona4golden,26ebp8,Wulfys,3,Sat May 24 20:09:27 2014 UTC,"Nope!  Generally speaking the two games can be played independently.  There are some references to minor characters, and one of the events in p3 is referenced but those are just bonus nods, not critical to the game"
persona4golden,26ebp8,sneauxoui,3,Sat May 24 21:39:49 2014 UTC,"The only real references that P4 makes to P3 is when there is a class trip to Tatsumi Port Island, in which we see the school as well as one of the social links of P3.  You don't need to know a single thing from P3, as they share only a tenuous connection.  To answer your questions, both of those things start happening in the first place because of certain things that occur about ten years before P3, and I believe they are pretty much resolved.  The Dark Hour isn't a natural part of the world."
persona4golden,26ebp8,XxChronOblivionxX,2,Sun May 25 00:05:30 2014 UTC,Your questions have for the most part been answered but I would like to add that you should really play p3 before p4. It's older so the systems are less clunky and playing p4 (which fixes these) will only make the systems seem more clunky and make the experience much worse. Also p3 is an amazing game so it's worth your time.
persona4golden,26ebp8,bauran,1 point,Sun May 25 03:25:22 2014 UTC,Well he has the portable version of 3 which is practically the same as P4.

But myself, knowing lots of gay people, being over-dramatic became irritating very quickly. Also the s-link where he likes yells at his mother? That felt like poor characterisation to me.

persona4golden,25zmi8,akeyjavey,2,Tue May 20 02:00:41 2014 UTC,Judging by how the movies are only a few hours total and the game is upwards of 70 hours I definitely recommend that you play the game. It's just not possible for them to include everything from the game in a few movies.    The game on its own is fantastic. So go for it.

There's no old save bonuses, so you'll be fine if you skip it.  That said, I do agree that it adds immensely to the story."

Though I'm just about out of SP on everyone at the moment, with no items to recover it.  I've been prioritizing the +hp/+sp cards when I beat shadows, so that's helped me fight for longer."

Maxing out Marie's social link by November/December unlocks a lot of new gameplay, so make sure you do it. ""Friends"" or ""lovers"" route doesn't matter. Your party members grow stronger as you level up their social links, so prioritize them. Naoto's link requires high courage to start, IIRC none of the others have social stat requirements. Rise in particular gets some useful stuff.  You generally want to fight primarily with fused personas and only use the one you get from battles for fusing.  Run each dungeon a second time (after the deadline for the first clear) and kill the mini-boss at the end. This will ensure you're leveled up enough to progress through the game smoothly. When the game tells you you're approaching the final stretch, make sure you save to a second file so you don't have to start over from the beginning if you make a wrong choice and get a bad ending.  At the very end, after you've talked with everyone, no matter how much the game discourages you from doing so, go to Junes."

Working on the Fox social link will save you a fortune in the long run. Focusing on less social links and maxing them might be to your advantage. When working on a social link, have a persona of that person's arcana with you. You level the link up waaay faster. Making lunches can give you a ton of social link points with that person. Try to go on dungeon crawls while it's raining, since there are rare monsters and items during that time.  If you can do dungeons in one day, that's ideal. You can fight a lot longer if you mostly use physical persona skills. Go to Aiya's on rainy days to level up several stats at once. Keep knowledge up.  If you get top score, you get an awesome item and a bunch of bonus cash. Enjoy this game.  Try to analyze it and figure out the true killer yourself."

persona4golden,24iat8,wyzellak,5,Fri May 2 01:53:39 2014 UTC,"He's 17 and lives in Japan, he can't exactly say no to his parents wanting him to come home. Ultimately though, he is you, and you are him (had to get that joke in, sorry), so if ""you"" are a sociopath, then maybe you need to look inward. I'm kidding, of course, but this is a theory I've seen elsewhere, and I just don't buy it. Watch the anime or play P4A and see what he's like when youre not him, you'll find your own theory difficult to agree with.  I managed to write that whole paragraph without offending either of the canon name camps! Result!"
persona4golden,24iat8,AndyF1996,2,Fri May 2 02:30:10 2014 UTC,"Well played, I must admit. However, I don't buy why he didn't ask his parents to stay in Inaba (considering that Dojimas expressed many times the will to keep him in their home), didn't rebel, did nothing.  I've seen the anime - you're right, it's more ""real"", maybe because he isn't a mute. As of me projecting myself on him, I really doubt that. I would have stayed or taken her with me (she is homeless har har har), but that's me, not him."
persona4golden,24iat8,bauran,2,Fri May 2 02:46:25 2014 UTC,"Keep in mind we have absolutely no prior knowledge of his life before moving to Inaba. For all we know he could be the hot shit in the big city and actually enjoy his life there too. Now honestly I hate to think that but I'm just putting it out there haha (and honestly the friends he saved the world with would be much better than any other friends). And judging from anime if one girl confesses her love to you, that doesn't always mean that the character is going to love them back. Honestly I think it's more a matter of his parents simply not letting him stay with the Dojimas indefinitely (they are his parents after all). Also he is only a train ride away so it's not like they don't keep in touch with each other, and if you play P4 Arena they mention that he visits every chance he gets."
persona4golden,24iat8,AndyF1996,1 point,Fri May 2 04:38:30 2014 UTC,"Japan's a very different culture. Remember when Dojima gets angry at you and you have to call him ""sir""? Japan is very hierarchical, and you are raised from birth to never question a superior. Even the name honourifics constantly instil a sense of ""this person is above/below me"". Think about King Moron as well, in a western setting a kid would report him for the kinds of things he says, but he gets away with it because no one crosses their superiors. With all that being said, I actually think it's pretty reasonable neither the protagonist nor any of his friends want to cross his parents in what they've decided.   Final point, on why he didn't take Marie with him, it's because the true ending of golden probably wasn't allowed to differ from vanilla P4, where Marie didn't exist.  EDIT: just another point I realised after I hit save, Dojima is the progatonist's mothers younger brother, so he wouldn't want to question her decisions for the same reason."
persona4golden,24iat8,im_cody,1 point,Fri May 2 12:00:05 2014 UTC,"I had a similar feeling. The protagonist in my game was dating Chie exclusively and then just rides off into the sunset.

So, there is that."

persona4golden,24iat8,XxChronOblivionxX,0,Fri May 2 13:12:14 2014 UTC,"Something about both Persona 3 and 4 that isn't talked about enough is the whole aspect of forming the Social Links for the sake of power.  Especially when the gamer is doing a Max Social Link run, from a role-playing perspective, it shows that Souji is a magnificent actor who uses his arcana to act exactly how he needs to around people in order to form a 'bond' with them and increase his own power.  In Persona 3, if you want to max social links, you literally have to pursue a romantic relationship with every girl, and tell them whatever makes them feel the best.  I believe that a true friend tells you the difficult things always, not just whatever makes you happiest, and as such I have a difficult time playing like that."
persona4golden,248n75,Jimsbeanz,4,Tue Apr 29 01:35:15 2014 UTC,"I really liked that Golden changed this approach (at least in some difficulties?) and let you restart from the floor you were on if you died.  Anyway some things I would do is buy Goho-M's at the store when they are available. They are only periodically there, I think more often when it's raining and I think they costed about 1000g but I would stock up on those and go back to the TV entrance and save once in a while, even if you want to keep going. You can always just go straight back to the dungeon and return to the floor you were on last and get a little bit further. This is especially useful if you're trying to do the dungeons in 1-2 days like most people do in order to get the most out of your social links.  Other than that, they do make some items to help you run from battle and things so I guess don't be a hero if you run into something that tough and think it might cost you your progress. I think they're called Vanish Balls or something.  Lastly probably something obvious but try to find your enemies weaknesses, especially in these first few dungeons almost all enemies have some sort of weakness that makes them cake to kill. Once you know it you'll waste a lot less SP playing the guessing game.  Good luck and have fun!! :)"
persona4golden,248n75,lurker_rang,1 point,Tue Apr 29 01:43:59 2014 UTC,"Buy a lot of Goho-M's and Vanish Balls from the store. They end up costing a lot, but they're worth their weight in gold for all the times they'll save you. I personally never went into the TV with less than 9 Goho-M's and 9 Vanish Balls in my inventory. I would suggest getting up to the floor that's giving you the most trouble, use a Goho-M, save, and then try your best to fight. If things get too hairy, just use Vanish Ball and heal up. Or you could do the much more risk strategy of rushing up to the boss save point, using a Vanish Ball every time you get into trouble, and then grind on the tougher enemies. I used this strategy on the next dungeon and paid heavily for it because the enemies would totally destroy me when I was on the second-to-last floor."

However, the fact that the writers didn't just make him EITHER gay or straight is amazing character writing. He is on par with Teddie and Naoto for the most character development. Maybe it is because all three have weird gender issues, all to very different degrees. However I find it funny."

persona4golden,23fms9,Shaedana,4,Sat Apr 19 13:27:30 2014 UTC,"These are some of many reasons that people recommend playing P3 first. The fact of the matter is: Persona 3 is older. Older games are going to be clunkier, more difficult, and can generally just be more frustrating. P3 is just more of a grind and challenge (which I honestly preferred, P4 was too easy for me). I'm not sure I understand your complaint of too many characters being introduced (It's only like 1 every month, not too bad and not much faster than P4), but I do think that having the characteristic barrier (I.E. needing max charm to Slink Yukari) was a mistake because I wasn't able to Slink them until it was way later in the game. I do agree that P3's second half is much much stronger than it's beginning whereas P4 is great start to finish, but IMO the crazy events and character development of the latter half more than made up for it.  As for whether or not P5 should be focused on characters only, I think that would be a mistake. Something Persona does so well is blend school life aspect with the epicness of a JRPG so I really don't think they should settle for one or the other. Personally I would love a much more dramatic, dark experience ala P3. Persona 4 was a fantastic game and I love it to death, but I prefer the darker more intense tones of P3 and would really like to see something similar, or hell something completely different because I can see them doing something really special with P5."

Probably the hardest fight was some mid-boss trio that charmed my whole party and that was.. fun...  I worded it poorly but I don't think dungeons should be removed, just the end of the world threat. I liked that in P4 Adachi was a relatively normal guy with no grand scheme in mind. End of the world scenarios are overused in rpg:s. I would care more if the people close to MC were in danger and the game should focus on smaller scale drama.  About the character introduction, maybe I remember incorrectly but Ken, Koro and Shinjiro were brought in within a week or two apart from eachother. I never got to know them and they seemed awful characters anyway. A dog as a party member? Geez.. I was quite sceptic about Aigis but she actually turned out to be my favorite. It was bizarre at first though."
persona4golden,23fms9,bauran,1 point,Sat Apr 19 18:36:36 2014 UTC,"I'm not really seeing how persona 4 wasn't an end of the world situation... If they hadn't stopped Izanami then the entire world would have fused with the TV world and everyone would become shadows. That's nearly as bad as 3 albeit slightly less destructive. Also a big focus of P3 was on each individual and their struggle dealing with knowing the fact that they might die in a month. I really don't know how you would make a persona game without some looming threat, otherwise they would never have a reason to summon a persona..."
persona4golden,23fms9,youarebritish,1 point,Sun Apr 20 03:53:53 2014 UTC,"I'm trying to say that having world ending threat in both of these games and maybe in P5 will get stale and boring. At least in P4 it came out of the blue quite last minute. Adachi had very little to do with it, compared to Ikutsuki and Takaya whose actions made no sense to me at all. I just laughed at these lunatics, but I actually could understand Adachi on some level.  End of the world isn't really a concept we as a players can relate to. It doesn't mean anything, and there's no real tension in the story either since we know it won't happen anyway. We will most likely care about the characters though, so why not just focus on putting them in danger, and not simply in deadly situations, there are lot more terrible fates that death.  To sum it up, I did enjoy both endings, I just can't imagine third time working so well anymore."

persona4golden,22zj9m,awheath,1 point,Mon Apr 14 06:57:50 2014 UTC,There is no legitimate way of purchasing it digitally. The only way to get the OST is buying the CD off of Amazon or wherever. Also to note: the extra Golden songs are on another CD so if you want the full OST of P4G its gonna be like 40 (for the P4 OST) + 20 (for the Golden tracks).
persona4golden,22zj9m,bauran,1 point,Tue Apr 15 01:55:57 2014 UTC,"Sure! You can't purchase the actual soundtrack for P4G, but you mighttt find it on Amazon, and find the Persona 4 Soundtrack on some site. Look it up!"

When they put out P3P they just made it more apparent that Persona 4 took place after P3 and explained it more. It's similar in how many of the P3 social links are referential to P2.

persona4golden,21r6vs,marcusp619,6,Sun Mar 30 16:38:38 2014 UTC,"Gamespot are trying to sell you strategy guides. RPGs are not universally impossible to beat without guides.  For P4G, I recommend no guide for first play through. If you play again, it might be worthwhile using a guide if you're going for trophies."
persona4golden,21r6vs,NCatfish,2,Sun Mar 30 17:01:53 2014 UTC,"Thanks,  You guys have made me feel confident about playing the game"
persona4golden,21r6vs,CrackLawliet,2,Sun Mar 30 17:16:00 2014 UTC,"Can confirm, am a Gamestop employee. We're always supposed to push sales, what better opportunity then when you're buying the game as well. In any case, its not necessary."
persona4golden,21r6vs,bauran,3,Sun Mar 30 20:21:32 2014 UTC,"There really isn't any need to have a guide unless you want to 100% the game. P4G is pretty straightforward from my experience, (The only parts that were confusing are when you have to talk to specific NPC's, I'm sure it's not too hard but I got lazy) and the only thing you will miss are some of the Social Links because you really have to manage your time perfectly to get every S.link. In my opinion using a guide is more of a last resort rather than something you should constantly follow. Enjoy the game, and if you get stuck then look up a guide online (sorry but gamestop is conning you with those physical guides, unless you like pretty pictures haha). Oh and there is one major thing that you will actually for sure need a guide for: It's really far down the line but the game will explicitly tell you something along the lines of, ""The game is reaching its climax and your choices will effect the outcome of the game"" and it will ask you to save. Try and look up a guide at that point because you might accidentally get the wrong ending when you ideally want to get the best, ""true"" ending.  I'm not a huge rpg expert or anything but from my experience RPG's are a lot about exploration and finding important things so generally if you go around and talk to everyone and see everything you will find out enough info and know what to do, but if you don't feel like exploring every nook and cranny you may eventually need a guide."
persona4golden,21r6vs,Airules,1 point,Sun Mar 30 17:06:54 2014 UTC,"Thanks a lot for your quick response. I figured they were in it for the money, but It was just stuck in my head since I started the game."
persona4golden,21r6vs,Mikeoneus,2,Sun Mar 30 17:15:07 2014 UTC,"The only bit I'd suggest getting help on is when you get the December 3rd (I think) as the end story branches into the different endings.  It suggests saving, and even says something explicit like ""major events take place on this day and a save is highly recommended"".  As the branching is not very obvious, I personally would recommend a guide to get the true ending.  By no means essential, but you'll get a much more satisfying conclusion to the game if you do.  Enjoy!"
persona4golden,213sv4,Shaedana,5,Sat Mar 22 22:11:14 2014 UTC,"Physical requires specific skills to be good enough compared to magic, because very few enemies are weak to physical elements.  Aigis is among the worst characters as a physical character, her real strength comes during the lategame where she can provide all of the buffs, and do support healing. She also gains Akasha Arts and God Hand, two of the best physical skills in the game.  Before that, she is very weak, and probably kind of worthless, especially compared to Junpei who gets a bunch of really good physical skills early on, and has naturally higher strength.  Normally I use a party where the other three command a unique element, so I can focus on fusing personas that use the remaining elements, including physical.  But parties with ""wonky"" teammates can work, and I've done it before, using Naoto and Aigis is very much possible, and does come with advantages. Naoto while weak on bosses, is the queen of destroying random shadows, while Aigis is really strong on bosses when she spams her group buffs. It's all about making up for their weaknesses with the MC."
persona4golden,213sv4,Grotpar,2,Sat Mar 22 23:45:13 2014 UTC,"I liked Naoto in Golden since she pretty much took care of the trash mobs single-handedly. I heard she was worse in the original though.  This is my first P3 playthrough and it's frustrating not to know the value of each team member. Also since leveling is so slow, I'm afraid of getting stuck with crappy party comp... Well so far the bosses have been cakewalk, maybe I can afford keeping Aigis, she's just too cute :)  Thanks for clearing things up!"
persona4golden,213sv4,Vitefish,1 point,Sun Mar 23 00:53:11 2014 UTC,"The thing about physical skills in Persona is that while they are powerful and just as useful as magic, you really have to train yourself out of the ""I must all out attack the enemies every time"" mentality. There's nothing wrong with laying out a hit all spell and then having Aigis follow up with Heatwave or something. Simply draining the enemies health bars is still a viable strategy."
persona4golden,213sv4,markopolo530,3,Sun Mar 23 14:20:13 2014 UTC,yoshitsune+heat riser+power charge and Hassou Tobi lol. [physical all the way] you can Quick battle and not worry about not dealing enough damage

persona4golden,20wg7v,CoolGuyPersona,1 point,Fri Aug 22 02:43:25 2014 UTC,"Well, if you only want to use one persona in the game, you can make an invincible Yoshitsune and only use Hassou Tobi all the time. The problem with that is that it can get boring after a while and some enemies absorb/resistant to physical damage. You could just leave them to your team though. It can also be a hassle to make him invincible and requires a lot of money. With power charge though, you can pretty much kill anything with Hassou Tobi."
persona4golden,20vxax,DaxterAttano,9,Thu Mar 20 07:33:46 2014 UTC,Does anyone else really hate how easy it is to accidentally get this ending?  It's nowhere near as satisfying as the good ending or the true ending. It just seems odd that the intended ending is harder to achieve than this less satisfying one!
persona4golden,20vxax,Airules,3,Thu Mar 20 18:12:41 2014 UTC,"I was really angry at the game when I got to this point. I wanted to stick with my desicion but that meant missing out on a huge chunk of story.  Looking back, I now understand that the theme of the game requires this scene as it is but I really hope P3 handles its ending options better (I doubt it) or at least P5..  It's pretty much how I was angry I had to tell Naoto I liked that she is a girl to unlock romance path. That wasn't my opinion, I was forced to say so. It broke my immersion and I was reminded that this is just a game."
persona4golden,20vxax,Shaedana,1 point,Thu Mar 20 20:45:48 2014 UTC,P3 has a really obvious bad ending choice and that's it.
persona4golden,20vxax,MSnap,3,Thu Mar 20 23:01:41 2014 UTC,"I would call that the medium ending. The game could have ended better, and it could have ended worse."
persona4golden,20vxax,Aleyha,3,Thu Mar 20 08:23:38 2014 UTC,"If your game just skipped to march, you haven't reached the intended ending.  The final cutscene and the theme that plays during the credits convey a sense of emptiness and incompletion."

persona4golden,20vxax,dhack21,3,Thu Mar 20 15:18:11 2014 UTC,I would go back to your most recent save. I had the same ending as you and had to rethink my choices in that room.

persona4golden,20vxax,shimyia,2,Thu Mar 20 16:54:05 2014 UTC,So without giving too much away... Did you get to participate in new years and valentines day or did it just end?
persona4golden,20si9p,markopolo530,8,Wed Mar 19 06:25:20 2014 UTC,"that was a new scene for golden, not in the original, so yes, it absolutely was a reference to arena, but it's not as clever as you think."
persona4golden,20si9p,AndyF1996,2,Wed Mar 19 08:27:54 2014 UTC,"Basically this. Arena came out before Golden, so now that its canon they could callback to it."

persona4golden,20si9p,builderkid107,1 point,Wed Mar 19 15:40:32 2014 UTC,"BUT!  This doesn't make any sense.  If Persona 4 Arena is canon, then why is it when Yu is packing up his stuff to leave an empty room, while in Arena, his stuff is still there how he left it?  What's up with that?"
persona4golden,20si9p,Shaedana,3,Wed Mar 19 21:37:31 2014 UTC,"i think visually, they might have made a small mistake but we get the idea: the room was exactly the way he left it, which probably included the desk,couch,coffee table, rack, futon, and tv. maybe he left of some his things there"
persona4golden,20cpzy,Downloaded,3,Thu Mar 13 22:01:47 2014 UTC,"okay, well, on the fusion vs levelling, always fusion. as regards specialisation, all the party members learn a fairly simple skill set, where they have their basic skills then clear upgrades to them. The MC, on the other hand should carry a variety of personas to cover many roles, so he can do lots of stuff. If you have any other questions, just ask and I'll get back to you ASAP. The Persona games are my favourite series of games ever, so I'm always happy to help someone else enjoy them if I can :)"
persona4golden,20cpzy,AndyF1996,2,Thu Mar 13 22:44:39 2014 UTC,"Ok… let me try to explain to you as best as I can.  There are 2 types of ""magical spirits in the game"".   Personas  and Shadows. Here's some info about each. I'll try to keep every thing spoiler-free to about Shadow Kanji.  Personas Personas are very powerful, and have special moves and types. Let me put it this way. A Persona has 8 moves, similar to a Pokemon. A persona can react to different types of moves in many ways, including Null (meaning that the effect has no effect, like using Flame Wheel on Charizard), Reflect (where the effect bounces back on the opponent, think throwing a flaming ball at a wall, then it bouncing back and setting fire on your nuts), and Normal (think using Fury Swipes against a Mew).  There's 8 different types of effects moves can have on a Persona.  You can get Personas by choosing them during Shuffle Time (after the battle when the cards show up), Fusing them by mashing together different Personas which will all carry specific moves, or by using Special Personas (the high level ones when you have to get specific ones, like Black Frost or the Trumpter). You can find recipes to create certain Personas. If you want to get a Persona that you already have, but used it, find it in the Compedium, but be warned: it'll be the same level as it was before and you'll have to pay a large fee for high level personas).  Moves can be found by passing moves from fusion, leveling up, or by buying move cards in the Velvet Room."
persona4golden,20cpzy,Chaoscoolperson,1 point,Fri Mar 14 04:00:21 2014 UTC,Thanks!  How often should I register in the velvet room?  I never know if that's really important or not...
persona4golden,20cpzy,akeyjavey,1 point,Fri Mar 14 11:04:21 2014 UTC,You should register your personas that have leveled up and give new skill cards to be bought later every time you visit and have one of these.
persona4golden,20cpzy,Chaoscoolperson,1 point,Fri Mar 14 13:53:28 2014 UTC,You should register your personas...every time you work really hard.
persona4golden,20cpzy,Chaoscoolperson,1 point,Fri Mar 14 23:23:55 2014 UTC,Your characters except for Yu are already specialized so you mainly need to apply the obvious skill upgrades and be sure to max out their social links. Also be sure to fuse new personas about every 5-7 levels to keep yourself strong
persona4golden,20cpzy,Chaoscoolperson,1 point,Fri Mar 14 01:18:44 2014 UTC,"Leveling personas only works until they run out of skills to learn. The best personas are only obtainable through fusion, generally of more than 3. The party members don't require much tinkering for their move sets, the only one with much choice is the last one you get who was originally focused on instant-kill skills but in Golden has access to the almighty spells and all high level elemental spells."
persona4golden,20cpzy,Shaedana,1 point,Fri Mar 14 03:34:42 2014 UTC,"Ok, so that faster you can get to the high level personas, the better?  In Pokemon I enjoyed keep couple of Pokemon for a long time (i.e.: lv 100 Pikachu) but I guess this is a different game."
persona4golden,1zyram,Shaedana,3,Sun Mar 9 13:46:43 2014 UTC,"You'll get access to five or so party s-links in time. Mitsuru and Yukari are stat-based and time based. So for example you need to be past the lovers boss and have maxed out charm for Yukari. The run away will NOT always work. Thats why there at items (I think its a trafuri gem) you can use for guaranteed away. I only use tartarus on the night before major events because your characters cannot get tired. This is to allow time to work on stats, walk the dog (later in game), hang with s-links, etc. Hope I could help!  Edit: Go hunting for s-links! Talk to that shy girl on the hallway of your classroom, etc. Whenever an slink mentions somebody's its probably an s-link that just got unlocked."
persona4golden,1zyram,QuickChip,1 point,Sun Mar 9 17:30:43 2014 UTC,"Thanks! How many floors each Tartarus block is? So it'll be doable in one night? I noticed the entrance heal cost is surprisingly low, thank god :)  I had no idea party SLinks were stat based! Man, I miss Golden.. So many strange and sometimes annoying mechanics in this game .__.'"
persona4golden,1zyram,QuickChip,2,Sun Mar 9 18:05:15 2014 UTC,"Only three s-links are (Lovers, Empress, Priestess). There are also two that are story-based (you'll see in time, you haven't met them yet). Don't worry about how long the blocks are just gogogogoggo until you hit minibosses then refresh your hp and go back. Money is pretty much a non-issue while grinding because its much more forgiving than golden."
persona4golden,1zyram,akeyjavey,1 point,Sun Mar 9 20:18:48 2014 UTC,Oh and is there a similar new game+? I'll probably aim for a second runthrough if I get to keep my stats.
persona4golden,1zyram,QuickChip,3,Sun Mar 9 18:08:03 2014 UTC,"The NG+ in P3 keeps your stats (yes, your level too) and new unlocks."
persona4golden,1zyram,akeyjavey,4,Sun Mar 9 18:35:14 2014 UTC,And the compedium. Meaning you can focus 100% on s-links and just stop through most of the game
persona4golden,1zyram,akeyjavey,3,Sun Mar 9 20:19:14 2014 UTC,"Well first of all in P3 you dont actually need to go to Tartarus aside from leveling up, so you dont have to reach the end of a block by a certain time (although it is better if you try) Party member SLinks are only available as the FeMC and they dont give party members any new skills like in Golden."
persona4golden,1zyram,akeyjavey,1 point,Sun Mar 9 18:38:00 2014 UTC,This whole Tartarus thing is weird.. So it has nothing to do with story either? Just grinding and loot?
persona4golden,1zyram,melfinastarwind,3,Sun Mar 9 19:05:58 2014 UTC,"Mysterious Smile Tartarus is important, you'll see. But for most of the game it is mainly to keep you prepared for full moon bosses, but don't let that stop you from completing a block.  EDIT: Also do remember that this game is older than P4G so don't let some of the mechanics slow you down."
persona4golden,1zzn05,Indiboys,3,Sun Mar 9 20:22:49 2014 UTC,"For P3, at least 2 or 3 nights a week is probably the minimum. Once you can't do anything else at night always go to tartarus. I know it can be really boring, I hated it, but it's what you have to do. P4 is very different and better IMO. In persona 4 there are 6-8 dungeons to go through. Each of these is around 10 levels high. You have around a month of in game time to complete them. It is usually best to do it all in one day on the first day it is available. This isn't always and option but is them most efficient."
persona4golden,1zzn05,CountryTechy,2,Sun Mar 9 21:01:58 2014 UTC,I liked that in P4 you knew if you were underleveled since the bosses are ten levels apart starting from lvl15. I'm still too early in P3P to know if there's a similar pace to it..
persona4golden,1zzn05,Shaedana,1 point,Sun Mar 9 22:19:59 2014 UTC,I don't think there is but I don't remember for sure.
persona4golden,1zzn05,CountryTechy,1 point,Sun Mar 9 22:23:13 2014 UTC,Is it true that you can't do social links and dungeon crawling in the same day?
persona4golden,1zzn05,CountryTechy,1 point,Sun Mar 9 21:22:22 2014 UTC,I believe so. You may be able to go out and do the night ones but I don't think so. It says your tired from going into the dungeon so you can't.

persona4golden,1zzn05,Jmaisonet,1 point,Sun Mar 9 21:49:44 2014 UTC,"Can't comment on P3 but for P4, it starts off kinda difficult , you take a couple of days per dungeon just to rest and heal up before continuing through. BUT it gets easier to the point where you can do a dungeon in a day if you wanted.   Stressful at first, easy later. :)"

My youngest brother is autistic so we have to work harder to help him in life; he has incredible potential, it's just tough knowing when or if he can get there. and my dad walked out on us, so i'm the last chance for my mom to feel like she hasn't failed in her life which she has dedicated solely to her family.   she's helped me through college, to get a great job, and succeed in life where she failed. in reality, i just want to run away from the pressure and stress, settle down with my boyfriend, working on my own novels and visual novels. i'd rather have a no-pressure find-happiness life (at least for a short while now that i'm out of college) like my middle brother, rather than feel like i have to carry my family for my mom's happiness.   i'm always guilty to admit it, but i'd rather just be a housewife with a shitty job and fantastic hobbies."

I would say Naoto because occasionally I wish to change the circumstances of my birth to a different gender to better fit my personality but that's only a small part of her character and would be awkward to admit.

persona4golden,1ylkcg,Jmaisonet,5,Sat Feb 22 04:17:43 2014 UTC,"FES doesn't really improve on the story. It just adds a combat focused mode that acts as an epilogue. I enjoy P3P the most personally and if you were in a position to get either one or the other, I'd go for P3P. I'm saying this as someone who just beat FES a week ago. P3P has a lot of gameplay elements taken from P4 that just makes A LOT of things better than FES. You can control every member of the party, you can warp to areas instead of having to walk everywhere, you can get a job to get extra money where in FES you had to grind in Tartarus, you can do co-op attacks with party members, standing up when downed doesn't waste a turn, you can get skill cards that make raising personas so much easier. I think you also get new personas in P3P that aren't in FES. Also if you played P4(which I'm assuming you have), Yukiko makes a cameo and you can fight Margaret, so it makes it more like the two games are in the same universe.   The main thing that P3P has going for it is the Female Protagonist. It plays really different from the Male storyline-wise because the female has a different personality than the male, people will treat you differently, you get new social links, you get social links with party members that you couldn't have as a male, and a major event in the game can play out differently as a female. Plus you get a different version of your starting persona, the music is different as the female, and you have the option of having a male assistant in the velvet room. The whole thing with P3P is playing as the male in one playthrough and seeing how things could have been different in a female playthrough or vice-versa.  The things that FES has that P3P doesn't are anime cutscenes, walking around with your character outside of tartarus, the ability for your main character to equip all weapon types, and The Answer. This is gonna be my opinion, but I don't think the anime cutscenes are anything spectacular. A lot of characters look uglier in them than they do in the actual game. You can't walk around the city in P3P. It makes up for this by having a visual novel type of thing where you go places with a point and click style interface. It's not bad either. P3's world is a lot bigger than P4's. Running around everywhere is nice, but when you're doing your social links and it takes 2 minutes to run where you have to go from school, it can be a pain. In P3P, you warp to where you need to go in seconds. The only real bummer is that you can't equip every weapon. The Male Protag has shortswords and the female has naginatas. Finally the Answer. A lot of people will say it's worth it just for this, but I thought it was overhyped. It's combat heavy, so if you want a challenge, then this is for you. I think you can get away with watching this on youtube.  FES isn't a bad choice. The only major gripe I had was the combat. You have to rely heavily on using tactics to program what you want your party to do because you can't control them directly. If you don't mind that and like to run around, then go for FES. But I personally think P3P is the better version overall. It just had so much overall that made P3 a better experience for me. Plus it's portable, you can have it right there next to P4 Golden."
persona4golden,1ylkcg,GunstarGreen,1 point,Sat Feb 22 05:26:50 2014 UTC,I have not beaten Golden yet because I am actually starting the series for the first time. I actually really enjoy the combat in turn based RPG's a lot more than most people (which is lucky since apperentley the amount of grinding in this series is insane!) so I think that I might actually enjoy The Answer a lot. Also I think that even though I am not able to control the move of the other character it still relies soley on strategy since I have to decide which characters to bring with in order to aid me in areas I do not excel at. I am eventuallygoing to buy P3P though since I do want to see the FeMC's story and how it differs from the normal protagonist.
persona4golden,1ylkcg,DaxterAttano,1 point,Sat Feb 22 06:01:51 2014 UTC,I never found the grinding to be bad. You know how a well-paced game makes the grinding seem worthwhile? This is one of them. It could be just replaying dungeons to do missions or gather materials. Either way you never feel like it is tedious.
persona4golden,1ylkcg,akeyjavey,1 point,Sun Feb 23 00:31:38 2014 UTC,So FES is a bit more difficult and has anime cut-scenes? FES is it then. I've been wondering which one of this two to get and FES sounds like it's more my taste. The only problem is that FES can't be played on Vita which is a bummer.
persona4golden,1ylkcg,FabianQ,2,Sat Feb 22 17:27:24 2014 UTC,"I would say both actually, I bought P3P when it first came out and loved it, then I bought P3FES years later so i could experience the whole game in its true form, and the answer helps wrap up a lot from the original story. If you have a PS3 you can get FES for $10 on PSN anyway so it shouldn't break the bank."
persona4golden,1ylkcg,Roondak,1 point,Sat Feb 22 04:59:15 2014 UTC,I am going to get both eventually because I do want to see the anime cutscenes and play the answer but I also want to experience the story as the FeMC. I guess I'm getting Fes first so that I can get the fullest version of the story and after I beat Golden I will go back and buy P3P to play as the FeMC.

persona4golden,1yl9jf,Senpies,2,Sat Feb 22 02:07:46 2014 UTC,"The guide you are following seems really weird... Here's my two cents:  The thing is, it's random. He can either be there in the ""chain sound"" chest on any floor in any dungeon, or not.  Here is a trick though: Every 22 chests the sound happens; next time you fail to encounter The Reaper, start counting afterwards. Once you open your 20th chest, save the game. Now you only have to open one chest to hear the chains, and once more to encounter him or not. If you fail to encounter him, save and reset and do it over.  Also, I've read in quite a few places he has a really good chance of spawning in Magatsu Inaba, so give that a shot.  Now if you haven't heard any chain sounds AT ALL, then I have no idea how you've managed that, and I don't have any advice to give you on how to fix that."

persona4golden,1yczrv,Grobles87,4,Wed Feb 19 17:58:47 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't replace it. My first run through of the game took me 45 hours, and had a great storyline. The anime missed a lot of important story elements, but had many humorous parts, as well as putting small sections to expand a character's (yu, Chie and akiko especially) background.  Also, in the game, yu is pretty much your choice, but in the anime he is the smoothest fucker ever."

persona4golden,1yczrv,markopolo530,1 point,Tue Feb 25 05:07:40 2014 UTC,The anime is really for people who have already played the game. As stated before you are gonna want to play the game. plus the true canon ending (P4G) is only seen after playing through once & meeting some other requirements.

persona4golden,1xrpjl,invaderark12,3,Thu Feb 13 03:29:24 2014 UTC,"Isn't it obvious?  Adachi is the best choice, hands down."
persona4golden,1xrpjl,Shaedana,3,Thu Feb 13 06:26:20 2014 UTC,Naoto. Because its Naoto.
persona4golden,1xrpjl,Caridin,3,Thu Feb 13 20:44:07 2014 UTC,Chie is definitely the most popular. I almost wanted to dislike her for that reason (stupid I know..) but she is a well written character and the most easy to relate to.  I prefer Naoto though. Her inner conflict was quite unique and fascinating. Also she seemed to be more interested in getting to know me. The others felt bit self-centered (which isn't that bad but kinda awkward when looking for a girlfriend).  I have to admit I'd be interested in Adachi if he was available :) He's an interesting character and I understand him a little.  Oh and new Chie VA haters make me sad. She's SO much better actress!
persona4golden,1xrpjl,invaderark12,3,Tue Feb 18 16:37:59 2014 UTC,"THANK YOU!  Erin Fitzgerald does a much better job imo, her old VA was alright but sounded way too boring and dull, plus too old. I mean just listen to this! While the new one is more quirky and energetic."
persona4golden,1xrpjl,Chipsforfreedom,1 point,Sat Apr 19 22:22:50 2014 UTC,"Noooo! I can't take it!  Although it's much more painful to compare their shadow-Chie acting... I always chuckle when the new VA says the line ""I'm much, MUCH better than her!"" Yes, yes you are. So much!"
persona4golden,1xrpjl,Ritushido,2,Sat Apr 19 22:36:21 2014 UTC,I personally prefer Marie.
persona4golden,1xrpjl,builderkid107,0,Thu Feb 13 03:19:38 2014 UTC,"Marie might become my favorite. I switched from playing the original to golden without beating the original first and while Chie was easily my favorite in the original, Marie is giving her a good run for her money in golden. The fact that I don't care for Chie's new voice actor makes the decision even harder."
persona4golden,1xrpjl,pearson530,2,Thu Feb 13 04:06:03 2014 UTC,"Chie, by far. Though Naoto is really close too.  Actually, Chie and Naoto are the most popular girls in P4G, both in the US and Japan. They are usually mentioned the most and are usually really close in polls."

persona4golden,1xmzmb,KILRbuny,4,Tue Feb 11 19:38:17 2014 UTC,"Play P3 FES. It's on PS2 and if you have a PS3 it's on the Playstation store under the PS2 Classics. P3P was on the PSP, so alot of stuff had to be cut from the game because of it.   Anyway P3 is just as good as P4. In some parts it's better, and some parts worse. Overall though, it's just as good and well worth a playthrough."
persona4golden,1xmzmb,EvilFefe,2,Tue Feb 11 19:58:38 2014 UTC,"Is Portable a huge step down? What kind of stuff was cut? I'm certainly open to FES but would prefer to have a portable option as I have a lot of down time between my classes. I don't want to sacrifice quality for portability, though."
persona4golden,1xmzmb,Jmaisonet,5,Tue Feb 11 20:02:18 2014 UTC,"It's not a step down at all. There are a lot of gameplay aspects from P4 that was put in P3P that just make it better to play than FES in my opinion. The big thing that's cut are a game mode called the Answer, anime cutscenes and your method of exploration outside of tartarus. Instead of running everywhere you, it acts like a kind of visual novel game wear you use a cursor. A lot of characters have new portraits to make up for it and it really lends itself to the social linking aspect. It also makes it much faster to do your social links cause you aren't running around everywhere and you have the square button to take you to areas in portable.   You can also control each of your party members, get a job at night (the only way to make money in FES is tartarus), I think there are new persona's in portable as well. Another thing that P3P has going for it is the female MC. Which makes the game a pretty different experience. The music changes, you get new social links, and pretty much everyone treats you differently.  I'd say P3P is the better version to play. FES is good if you want to play the Answer."
persona4golden,1xmzmb,enkur,1 point,Tue Feb 11 20:27:21 2014 UTC,"You seem to be in the minority here. Not that your opinion is invalid, but to me the information I'm getting me is pointing me towards FES over Portable. It's good to hear that they didn't destroy the game to move it to the PSP, though."
persona4golden,1xmzmb,thefrontpageofreddit,4,Tue Feb 11 20:31:57 2014 UTC,"Yes, for a first playthrough, I'd have to say FES, but for any subsequent ones I would go with Portable easily. It's best to get the full experience from the former as far as cutscenes and in-game scenes go (along with something I greatly missed in Portable, being able to wield any type of weapon), and you'll definitely want to play The Answer as a pseudo-epilogue of sorts.  However, once you've got that under your belt, I think you'll have more fun replaying the game through Portable, if you intend to play it again. I felt that Portable took a lot of the gameplay lessons learned in P4 and applied them to 3. It's lamentable that the PSP's lousy capabilities resulted in simplification to a visual novel style (not that I have anything against that style, but I had grown accustomed to physically roaming the map in the original P3/4), but full party control, a less hindering Tired state, skill cards, and tag-team attacks made for more enjoyable combat.  Additionally, I actually had a blast playing the girl's path in Portable. It allowed me to learn more about the established characters from a different point of view, and added a lot more to some of them than what the original game covered (particularly some of your later party members). I didn't find myself missing the cutscenes at all.  TLDR: Regardless of whether you'll play it more than once or not, you'll want FES. But if you do end up wanting to replay the game, I highly recommend Portable for doing so."
persona4golden,1xmzmb,MrTheJackThePerson,1 point,Tue Feb 11 21:19:35 2014 UTC,PSP is actually pretty strong
persona4golden,1xmzmb,MrTheJackThePerson,2,Wed Feb 26 22:40:01 2014 UTC,"The story is the same, but without The Answer which is a prologue of sorts, and it also has no animated cutscenes. It reads like a visual novel.   This is a good representation of what the gameplay in the game is like. There's some mild spoilers like personas available and stuff, but yeah. It'll help you make a decision."
persona4golden,1xmzmb,EvilFefe,2,Tue Feb 11 20:16:41 2014 UTC,I think the fact that they removed the animated cut scenes is enough to make me go for FES over Portable. I watched a video of the opening cut scene from FES and I am now extremely interested in the game. I'll be downloading the PS2 classic later tonight from PSN.
persona4golden,1xmzmb,MrTheJackThePerson,2,Tue Feb 11 20:27:57 2014 UTC,"I can honestly say the plot is better in FES in my opinion. The thing that makes P4G better for me is the gameplay, and attention to detail in social links and stuff."
persona4golden,1xmzmb,EvilFefe,2,Tue Feb 11 20:37:19 2014 UTC,"The plot is darker, but I wouldn't say better."
persona4golden,1xmzmb,EvilFefe,2,Wed Feb 12 00:15:56 2014 UTC,It's all in an opinion.
persona4golden,1xmzmb,erthkwake,1 point,Wed Feb 12 00:47:49 2014 UTC,Don't sacrifice the quality. It's not like P4 Golden where they improved upon everything when bringing it mobile
persona4golden,1xmzmb,EvilFefe,2,Tue Feb 11 20:16:12 2014 UTC,"I'm kind of getting the vibe that it was a bit of a cash grab by moving a popular game to a new platform then, whereas P4 Golden was moved to a new platform but taken as an opportunity to improve and expand upon what made the game great."
persona4golden,1xmzmb,deshypothequiez,3,Tue Feb 11 20:26:08 2014 UTC,"No. It was not a cash grab in that sense. They added an entire new perspective to Persona 3 by adding a female main character. It had something for those who never played the game before, and those who had. It's a great game, but some mechanics had to be watered down for the PSP to handle it."
persona4golden,1xmzmb,nyancat1w,3,Wed Feb 12 00:14:24 2014 UTC,"I heard the social links aren't quite as good in P3 (though they are still really good), but P3 has a better overarching story. Definitely worth playing if you like P4.  Some people don't like the PSP version because you select who you hang out with on a menu instead of having to find them, but that just makes the game easier IMO."
persona4golden,1xmzmb,nyancat1w,2,Tue Feb 11 19:49:26 2014 UTC,Okay. Have you heard anything specifically about the depth of characters or how interesting they are? I like Yukiko because she has such an interesting backstory. She's essentially had everything handed to her and she is trying to step away from that.
persona4golden,1xmzmb,CountryTechy,2,Tue Feb 11 19:51:45 2014 UTC,Yes. It does. All the characters in P3 are just as deep if not deeper.

persona4golden,1xh1qg,bauran,5,Mon Feb 10 01:00:27 2014 UTC,I'm thinking it will be an MMO video game or something. Kinda like Sword Art Online.
persona4golden,1xh1qg,bauran,3,Mon Feb 10 01:33:16 2014 UTC,Sounds like a good idea. That would be a perfect tie in for SMT imagine 2 haha.
persona4golden,1xh1qg,MeAreSleepy,2,Mon Feb 10 03:02:59 2014 UTC,"If there is going to be an MMO it is no doubt going to be a spin-off game. They wouldn't take away the original idea of Persona, just make effective changes to it."
persona4golden,1xh1qg,JLToro,3,Mon Feb 10 17:22:20 2014 UTC,I think he means the characters play an MMO in game as the equivalent of the tv/midnight channel. Like something takes over during a certain part of their MMO to get them that portal.

I'd say the most important thing in the fight is casting buffs/debuffing Ameno-Sagiri. Every three turns, I'd cast Rakunda and Tarunda to drop it's attack/defense. Then I'd have Naoto cast Heat Riser on herself and Yukiko, and then just unleashed with the most powerful attack spells I had with my party.  Eventually, it will cast fog of doubt and for a few turns, you won't be able to hit it, and it will cast buffs on itself. Spend this time healing and casting Dekunda to eliminate it's buffs.     Also if I recall correctly, it warns you while it's charging it's more powerful attack, so block with everyone.  Lastly, I'd heal with Yukiko's Salvation to heal major damage, and Yosuke's Youthful Wind to heal minor damage, and to raise evade/hit on my entire party.   Like I said, before, a lot of the battle is buffing/debuffing, and then knowing when to attack."

persona4golden,1wuqsh,NormanDouglas,2,Mon Feb 3 01:35:25 2014 UTC,"Well first off, there is no wrong way to play any video game if you're having fun.  And I don't think that this is all that unusual of a method. This is pretty much what I do, but that is also so I can grind on a higher level then if I stayed on the first few levels.   If you are worried about being able to save/quit without using sleep mode, just stay close to the entrance on the first level until you are ready to fight the mini-boss, then run to the the top and grind near the save/exit point on the top floor. Also, if you might want to try only going in the TV on days that it rains (obviously not if you are cutting it close to the deadline). This way you are getting the max number of social link boosts and you get more XP from fighting monsters on rainy days"
persona4golden,1wuqsh,JavelinAMX,1 point,Mon Feb 3 03:14:17 2014 UTC,"My first time around I just kept climbing until I reached a certain point (Usually when my SP started to run dry), drop back, do some social links for a few days and then tackle the rest of the dungeons. On my second play through though I'm going all out in the first go.  They way both you and I to some extent go about it is fine the first time through, but I certainly recommend doing dungeons in one day on the second play through, which is helpful especially if you remember what enemies are weak to."
persona4golden,1wuqsh,LimblessNick,1 point,Tue Feb 4 02:25:07 2014 UTC,"Goho-M's let you leave and save. You can return and resume from the floor you left.  I generally do the dungeon all in one go. This is my first playthrough, and a Persona with Invigorate for the MC and some variant of Dia will let you truck through the whole dungeon."
persona4golden,1wuqsh,CrossFire43,1 point,Wed Feb 5 20:17:37 2014 UTC,It must make a huge difference when you don't play the game in easy mode.
persona4golden,1wuqsh,CountryTechy,1 point,Sun Feb 9 16:22:25 2014 UTC,Do the fox S-link as soon as possible. It drops his price. Then just go through until your out of SP and don't wanna pay the of anymore or use items. . Especially the golden hands. Make sure to fully explore every floor and fight all the shadows. You and your party should go up about 10 levels every dungeon.Hunt them with a passion. Remember to farm ad keep checking for new seeds. The items are pretty useful.
persona4golden,1wmm3v,bauran,4,Fri Jan 31 06:27:12 2014 UTC,Is this what you're looking for?

persona4golden,1w9zon,Vanargand,3,Mon Jan 27 13:33:37 2014 UTC,"Yeah. This game probably won't be considered canon or add much to the previous titles. We'll get to see all our favorite characters fight side by side and interact, but that's probably it. I for one, am just happy that we get to see Marie again."
persona4golden,1w9zon,Caridin,2,Mon Jan 27 16:27:45 2014 UTC,I don't have any official sources (mostly because I don't speak Japanese) but apparently whatever the evil of persona q is has managed to pull the characters from the middle of their respective games and created a time paradox in which the same day continues to replay and the only way out is to solve the mystery of the labyrinth
persona4golden,1w9zon,nonarbeor,1 point,Mon Jan 27 15:31:50 2014 UTC,"Oh, so it sounds like they're kinda pulling the same thing as what happened in p3 the Answer.  Thanks"
persona4golden,1w9zon,blueasian,3,Mon Jan 27 17:11:41 2014 UTC,"In PQ, the characters are taken from the school festival event where no one is dead yet in their respective times (in P3, the festival event was canceled because you were sick). This game is probably non-canon because of events that happened in Arena where the P3 cast meet the P4 cast for the 1st time."
persona4golden,1w9p80,grifta67,4,Mon Jan 27 09:47:00 2014 UTC,"I always equipped the matching persona for the social link, but I'm pretty sure you just need to have one.   As for the attack question, once you knock an enemy down you should be trying to knock any other enemies down with your bonus turn, so that you can get an all-out attack. So, if you have an enemy weak to electricity and another one weak to ice, you should use zio on the first, then bufu on the second with your bonus turn, so both are knocked down to trigger and all out attack."
persona4golden,1w9p80,Lur7z6,2,Mon Jan 27 14:07:55 2014 UTC,"You only need to carry the persona, it doesn't matter if it's equipped or not.  I usually knock them down with their weakness then follow with a physical attack, and repeat this with the other characters if possible, if not, i'll knock them all down with a character then use all-out attacks."
persona4golden,1w9ruq,Zedible,3,Mon Jan 27 10:51:26 2014 UTC,"Be at least level 14 on all characters.  Have a fire resist persona for the MC. If you can fuse or card Dia on it, that would be ideal."
persona4golden,1w9ruq,Grotpar,1 point,Mon Jan 27 11:27:09 2014 UTC,"It's weak to Bufu, use it as much as you can, but never use the team up attack. When it says it's charging, block with everyone because it's about to use a powerful move that can kill fairly easily.   When she summons a prince, focus on it first. Eventually, once you drop it to low enough health, it will run away and the shadow won't be able to call another one. I can't quite remember, but I think the shadow wastes a turn trying to call another one after you make the prince run away.  Other than that, bring lots of healing items, and do what Grotpar suggested."
persona4golden,1w9ruq,Ghostbustyler,1 point,Mon Jan 27 15:04:31 2014 UTC,"Also, 'Prince Charming' is weak to electric which makes it easily exploitable for team attacks on Yukiko (if you really want one)."
persona4golden,1w9ruq,tmlar,1 point,Tue Jan 28 08:31:23 2014 UTC,"The way I've always done it was training my characters to around 15 and fusing archangel for the mc since it gets media, which is super helpful in that fight."
persona4golden,1w9ruq,Korreee,1 point,Mon Jan 27 21:46:11 2014 UTC,I believe she is the only real boss with a weakness ( I don't consider Yosuke and Chie's bosses) so the fights get harder from here.

persona4golden,1w0n2b,AndyF1996,1 point,Fri Jan 24 07:29:41 2014 UTC,"for one thing, don't worry, if you run out of days the game rewinds a week, you don't just game over. Now, you'll need to fuse something with either strong physical or strong fire electric or wind. Something resisting ice and/or physical will also serve you well. Now, he charges nihil hand for two turns, so when he raises his hand, attack for a round then guard for a round. Keep Yukiko healing and try and keep on top of applying -kaja spells when you can. it'll be a long fight, but not impossible."
persona4golden,1w0n2b,Ghostbustyler,1 point,Fri Jan 24 09:30:11 2014 UTC,"Just like what everyone said before, have a Persona like King Frost that absorbs ice, and keep Yukiko on healing the entire party. Also keep casting things that will decrease it's attack/defence.  I thought I was screwed when I faced it because I didn't block the charged claw the first time, and it killed my entire party, minus my MC with low-ish SP. I just normally attacked him for a couple of turns and it couldn't do much against me.   Also, try and get some items that can heal the entire party at once, just incase Yukiko goes down, or she's low on SP.  The only bad thing about letting the fog roll in is that it forces you to start grinding levels again, so don't worry too much, and good luck!"

persona4golden,1vodxl,snesfriend,5,Mon Jan 20 15:46:35 2014 UTC,"P3P has the P4G battle system(you can control everyone, you couldn't on PS2) and an (IMO) much simpler navigation system(I find it faster than walking around).  P3FES has extra content(The answer), a 3D world where you walk around and anime cutscenes, and looks better.(It's also avaiable on US PSN if you own a PS3)  But the main factor for choosing is: How and when do you play it? I pretty much beat P4G and P3P sitting on a bus or train on my Vita. So I went with the PSP version because I could play it more often.(But i also got P3FES for The Answer)"
persona4golden,1vodxl,plasma-snake,3,Mon Jan 20 16:42:45 2014 UTC,"Why not both? but seriously i would say play P3P first to get a feel for it (FES will take a while to get used to not controlling everybody), then later buy P3FES and play the answer for, well...the Answer."

persona4golden,1vodxl,MrTheJackThePerson,2,Tue Jan 21 03:45:46 2014 UTC,I've only played P3FES and it is definitely worth getting. I think that the extra content and 3d navigation are far better than the visual novel style. The visual novel really takes a lot of the enjoyment of looking around at the setting and actually seeing characters rather than sprites. The only positives to P3P are controlling all your party (Which honestly I never had a problem with the AI in P3FES) and a female protagonist which I do think is something to consider.

P4Golden is the first persona game I've ever played, and honestly one of the best games I've ever played in my life. Once I beat it I'm probably going to go with Persona 3 FES just because the overworld is 3D and you move around + the anime cut scenes are a nice touch. Sure, persona being portable is nice but I like the 3D overworld a bit more/cutscenes  But then again.. P3P is portable and on the go.. makes it more appealing than a console persona game"
persona4golden,1vixop,ying_go,8,Sat Jan 18 15:20:00 2014 UTC,"There are a few extra scenes scattered around, two more social links, a bonus dungeon, a new ending and two more months of gameplay.

persona4golden,1vixop,plasma-snake,2,Sat Jan 18 18:54:56 2014 UTC,Is it worth buying the Vita only for Golden? Other than the aspect ratio was the graphics improved like MGS HD for example?
persona4golden,1vixop,Phatsnake,2,Mon Jan 20 08:45:45 2014 UTC,Yes its worth it... I have 6 games for the vita and another 6 in digital. However... I really only have the vita for p4 and hot shot golf... both games are worth dishing out for the vita. I bought mine used when gamestop had the $129 deal. P4 is the only game I have clocked 60 hours + in under 1 month. It is by far one of the best rpgs I have ever played.
persona4golden,1vixop,CrossFire43,2,Sun Jan 26 04:42:22 2014 UTC,Thanks. I ended up buying the Vita. Now I need to get P4 asap. It's also worth noting that the Vita is totally worth it for the PS4 remote play too

Like /u/AndyF1996 said, you do miss out on an extra dungeon/boss, some social links and some extra time to clean up social links.  If you don't have a vita, absolutely play the Ps2 version.  It's cheap on Amazon and if you get the vita down the road, Golden is definitely a fun way to play through a second time.  You'll appreciate the additions all the more.

She's completely different in class as she is online so seeing her shadow self with all those insecurities could be very intriguing  Going off of that I think seeing the shadow self of the STREGA Takaya, Jin and Chidori.  I want to know more about what exactly drives them to do what they do. (Maybe spoiler? Just being safe)hopefully it's more in depth than just being manipulated or being power hungry.  Chidori is already expanded upon, but not the other two.  Finally I'd really like to see shadow selves of the Persona 3 cast.  Maybe then they wouldn't need evokers.

The only other way to get sp is from regular chests but that is random. There will be an event where a fox will join you and let you recover all your sp for an expensive price. In Persona (and in general, SMT), sp is not meant to be spammed and should be used sometimes. If you are low on sp, try to get cup cards or fuse personas with invigorate. Mid to late game though, Rise will join your party and she will learn skills that allow you to recover sp at the end of a fight."

persona4golden,1uqg8i,TurboSexaphonic,2,Wed Jan 8 19:58:35 2014 UTC,"First question, what difficulty are you playing on? If you are playing on normal or above and the game is too difficult, play on an easier difficulty.  Persona is a game where you need to say up your sp. You should only use sp skills if it is needed. If there is a shuffle time, get the required persona to fuse or get cup cards. Also you should never rebuy old personas unless you REALLY need to. Oh and in the first dungeon, it usually takes 2 in-game days to complete the dungeon. I suggest you don't follow the guide religously and that you should make your own decisions in your first playthrough because it is more fun that way. For Shadow Yukiko, you should be above level 10(safe level is 14). I was lv.8 when I fought her on very hard but that was stretching it with around 20 revival beads used. Try to get a persona(Senri or Orobas) and fuse them with a bufu spell since the boss is weak to it(P4G only). Have everyone guard when the game indicates that she is gonna cast ""Burn to Ashes."" Since you have media, you shouldn't need that much healing items. Overall, the strategy is to debuff Shadow Yukiko with rakunda(defense debuff) and to have Yosuke buff you with sukukaja. Make the protagonist and Chie use bufu to knock Shadow Yukiko down. When she summons the prince, kill it with multi-targeting spells(like mabufu) or use zio on it."
persona4golden,1uqg8i,blueasian,1 point,Wed Jan 8 22:24:14 2014 UTC,"That's awesome advice and I appreciate it, but I realized what might be a problem right away:  The difficulty level. It's on hard, and I was thinking "" I played it before, I don't mind following a guide letter by letter if it gets me where I wanna go "". Turns out P4's version of hard is a little different. The enemies don't get smarter, you just hurt less and they hurt more.  As much as I feel ashamed that I couldn't do the castle in one go, I think it's a good idea to step down the difficulty level. I'm only looking for the fun experience of it anyways, it's a game I play during free time at work so I might want it on easy so I can spend a lot of that garbage time grinding levels, I don't mind restarting, I'm near the beginning still anyways.

I think you have to open 21 (normal?) chests, then a chain-rattle sound appears.  The next normal chest you open on that floor will have the reaper inside.  It goes away if you ignore it / move on to the next floor.    Needless to say, you should probably leave it until your party is around level 80.  ;)"

persona4golden,1sx96w,ThaJyesta,0,Sun Dec 15 08:43:41 2013 UTC,He's in every dungeon. If you just sit there and don't do anything for a while you'll hear chains rattling and he'll show up and chase you down.
persona4golden,1sx96w,AndyF1996,9,Sun Dec 15 13:59:53 2013 UTC,are you sure that's not just P3? I thought it worked completely differently from 3 to 4

persona4golden,1sx96w,AndyF1996,9,Sun Dec 15 14:08:41 2013 UTC,"It definitely appears after a time limit in P3, in P4 it's NG+ chests, and in P4G I think it's just in chests."

persona4golden,1sx96w,NCatfish,1 point,Mon Dec 16 08:19:47 2013 UTC,"To clarify slightly more, the reaper has a chance of appearing after the rattling sound. If there is only one chest, it has a 50% chance of appearing. Also I would recommend you be level 70-ish before you take him on since most people don't reach that level 80 on their first playthough(minimum is around 60-ish). The reward for beating the reaper is the best weapon for a character(so in a party of 4, the protagonist gets it first). After that, it gives the best armour for a character. After that, it gives an accessory that nulls all attacks(protip: don't use it on the NG+ exclusive boss).  http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/641695-persona-4-golden/65059128  Use this guide to farm for the reaper."

persona4golden,1swefe,perfectm,2,Sun Dec 15 00:11:21 2013 UTC,"Everybody probably has their own strategy for fusion. I try to fuse until I get a persona with at least two different elemental attacks and some decent healing spell, and then level it up. OTOH, if you have a particular ""dream team"" party that you like to take into dungeons, then you can fuse personas that fill in the weak spots in that particular party. In any case, you'll probably want to do a bit of grinding to stay ahead both in your persona's level and your party members' levels.  Social links and stats are hard to juggle--there's only so much you can do in the time you have each day. My opinion is that social links give you more in the long run than upping stats, but you shouldn't ignore stats entirely. Also, there are some activities you can do that up multiple stats at once--keep an eye out for them! One thing that's nice about stats is that you carry them over into a Next Game+, so you can usually max them out on your second playthrough if not your first."
persona4golden,1swefe,lordfeepness,1 point,Sun Dec 15 01:20:27 2013 UTC,"Try to have a physical persona, and at least one persona capable of using each element, and of healing. Other than that, it's just personal preference. I can definitely say one thing though, never get attached to a Persona, because they only learn skills for about ten levels, and they level up ludicrously slowly, you need to fuse to maintain the level curve."

If you don't want to do that, then here are the things you need to do.   Nothing matters until you're in the room with Namatame. after you're in there you say: 1. ""Wait a second here..."" 2. ""We're missing something."" 3. ""Namatame's true feelings."" 4. ""Something's bothering me."" 5. ""We're missing something..."" 6. ""Calm the hell down!""

persona4golden,1rox6h,DJTaki,3,Fri Nov 29 13:05:59 2013 UTC,"Definitely! The game is a lot of fun, and will keep you (at least it did for me) entertained for hours.  The story is really engaging, the battle system works well and even the social aspect of the game (building relationships) doesn't feel tacked on like some other games.  If you aren't totally convinced, check out some reviews or walkthroughs on youtube for an idea of what you're getting into."

persona4golden,1rox6h,Disregardskarma,3,Fri Nov 29 20:09:53 2013 UTC,"Ah crap, I read your title as is ""is P4G worth getting""  There's new characters (Two, both with their own social links) added to the story. More animated cutscenes, fully voiced and remastered dialogue, and i think new personas  were added. Also theres bonus video content, you can watch Japanese PV's and other stuff. From what I recall those were the main additions from the ps2 version."

persona4golden,1rox6h,enkur,5,Fri Jan 3 22:25:58 2014 UTC,"I thought I'd bring up a few points that haven't been mentioned yet, in case you're still on the fence. Let me first mention that I bought a Vita specifically for Golden. I have bought some games for it since, but even if I hadn't, I STILL think it was worth getting just for this. Take that as bias or whatever you will. Anyway:   You get an extra month of in-game time in this version, along with the ability to spend your nights outside (which opens up after some time), substantially increasing the amount of activity you can do in terms of strengthening links, fusing personas, and some other new stuff. In addition to an expanded selection of personas, you get access to a skill card system similar to the one P3P introduced, allowing you even greater control over the customization of your personas' respective skills. You can ALSO now adjust the skills of your teammates' personas through advancing social links as well as the new scooter outings. There are SIGNIFICANT bonus skills obtained by all party members that greatly enhance their power in battle. Also on the topic of combat, the added mechanics of random ""drive-by"" attacks and follow-up tag team attacks after All-Out Attacks really help along the flow of combat and make it an overall more enjoyable experience than it already was. Along with the existing bonus attacks and buffs from social links, you truly feel more powerful as you level and rank up. On the more aesthetic side, there are costumes that you can apply OVER your existing armor, a feature you just don't see much of outside of MMOs these days, and one which would have served P3P well, in spite of all the improvements that game made over the original P3. There's a huge selection of costumes for each character obtainable throughout the game. No DLC, no impossibly long tasks, no major commitments. The Golden Ending: No spoilers here, but the new extended ending (along with the process of obtaining it) is the icing on an already delicious cake that I was all too happy to devour.   Sorry if this came off as too much of blatant gushing, but I really found the enhancements to this version of the game to be far too grand to ignore. P3FES still offers reasons for one to revisit the older version over P3P, but there is absolutely NO way I can go back to original P4 after playing Golden."
persona4golden,1rox6h,JRDerpwing,2,Mon Dec 2 05:21:26 2013 UTC,"Thank you very much, this is exactly the kind of information I was looking for. Definitely planning on getting a Vita now."
persona4golden,1rox6h,JRDerpwing,1 point,Mon Dec 2 19:34:36 2013 UTC,"One more quick note: Since you're planning on getting Danganronpa (as am I), I thought I'd mention trying out the Zero Escape series if you haven't already. Although, if you already have a 3DS, then you could go that route with those games instead, since the first game (999) is DS-exclusive anyway."
persona4golden,1rox6h,JRDerpwing,4,Mon Dec 2 05:33:51 2013 UTC,"I know you were asking about Persona 4 Golden specifically, but I'm going to try and convince you of all the reasons to get a Vita:  First, there are tons of PSP games available online that you can buy for the Vita. There are also some less *cough*reputable*cough* ways to run almost any PSP games on a Vita, AFAIK. Me and my friends are having a blast with the Patapon series and they are worth every cent.  There may be some PSP games that won't show up in the online store on the Vita, but you can buy them from the SEN website and transfer them to your Vita through a PS3.  Next, about your ""barely anything else on the platform that catches my attention"" remark, are you sure you've looked at Dragon's Crown, Disgaea 3, Gravity Rush, Muramasa Rebirth, Sine Mora and Tearaway? Most of these are exclusive (for handhelds) to the Vita and they're all top-quality titles with tons of content.  But the one that takes the motherfucking cake has to be  SOUL SACRIFICE.  Man. I just got that for free in my PS+ subscription and I really can't recommend it enough. It's a highly-polished AA+ console-quality game with a story and lore to match some of the best games ever made for any platform, except that this is exclusive to the Vita. Hell, the music of Soul Sacrifice alone is worth getting a Vita for. The combat is great, the item system is fun, and best of all you can influence the story with your choices during the quests.  Back to Persona 4; SMT4 on the 3DS was my first Megami Tensei game before I discovered 4 Golden on the Vita and now I'm in love with the Persona series. Although I never played the original I really can't imagine the experience being any less for being on a portable system, in fact I think this style of RPG is actually more suited to a handheld, in how you can play it in discrete bits (one game-day at a time) as you go around taking care of other business."

persona4golden,1rie9v,timesplitter99,8,Tue Nov 26 18:24:50 2013 UTC,"P1 and P2 are completely different games from their later incarnations.  That being said, the stories of P3 and P4 are separate. It does not really matter which one you play first. There is a point in P4 where playing P3 first may be beneficial (nostalgia), but it's not important to the story.  With the devices available to you, I suggest Persona 3: FES on your PS3 as it's still on sale for $4.99. Keep in mind it is a PS2 game.  Or if you get a vita, there is Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4: Golden available to you (Along with the older persona games)."
persona4golden,1rie9v,Zyphere,2,Tue Nov 26 18:56:36 2013 UTC,"If possible get some version of 3 (FES is the best, sadly I havnt played it) and p4g. DO NOT PLAY P4G FIRST. I did that and it ruined 3 for me. They improve on so many things in 4 that 3 sucks to go back to. It's fun but not as good as it could have been"

For example, Yukiko's shadow did not have a weakness in the original game, yet is weak to ice in golden. This minor change makes the battle much easier."

persona4golden,1rdj9k,PsychoMantle,5,Mon Nov 25 22:26:16 2013 UTC,"I'd really recommend playing P3FES first. If you play golden and then go back and play P3 it will be a major struggle to get through the older and much more frustrating mechanics. I feel like I would have enjoyed P3FES much more than i did if i had played it before P4G. Both are great games that beat sooo many other jrpgs in terms of system mechanics, but Golden is so much smoother than FES its silly. Enjoy either one you play though :)"
persona4golden,1rdj9k,Campai7,2,Mon Nov 25 11:08:00 2013 UTC,I'm not to sure depending on whether or not you want a dark story or a light hearted story if you want a dark story I'd recommend Persona 3 FES if you want a positive light hearted story I'd go for Persona 4 Golden
persona4golden,1rdj9k,pezki,3,Sun Nov 24 22:40:22 2013 UTC,"I don't really care either way! I really would appreciate either, honestly. I've just heard great things about the Persona series and I'd hate to spoil the series for myself by jumping in at a weird point."
persona4golden,1rdj9k,mw19078,3,Sun Nov 24 22:44:26 2013 UTC,"Persona 3 Portable is a sufficient intro to the series which is also worthwhile.  It's a port of Persona 3 for the PSP and available digitally.  I you have the time and a Ps2 or Ps3, Persona 3 FES is the definitive version of the game.  I started playing Persona 3 first and I'm glad I did.  The persona games only reference each other in general, but Persona 3 and 4 have much more in common than the previous games.  But the main reason I think it's good to start with P3 (either FES or Portable) is because of the improvements brought onto the game in Persona 4 Golden.  They're all quite long though, and I wouldn't want you to get tired of the series before playing Golden though.  They are two of my favorite games though, so if you're okay going back and playing a previous title after enjoying Golden, by all means do so!  P3P goes on sale once in a while (might still be, I don't know).  Have fun!"

persona4golden,1qytz4,GameBoy09,1 point,Tue Nov 19 09:43:08 2013 UTC,"Most probably because not all Persona fans use Reddit, and most aren't even aware of the existence of this particular subreddit."

persona4golden,1qytz4,MrTheJackThePerson,1 point,Wed Nov 27 21:13:13 2013 UTC,Its a remake of a game on a mobile device with small sales records. Plus there's people who think it's unnecessary for a game to have it's own subreddit. I'm surprised we have as many people here as we do.
persona4golden,1qd61a,kingxero1,4,Mon Nov 11 08:26:43 2013 UTC,"Nope, just go for the true ending because there are no benefits for what ending you previously got. and IIRC if you get the true ending you can fuse Izanagi-No-Okami for the next playthrough."
persona4golden,1qd61a,akeyjavey,2,Mon Nov 11 20:33:17 2013 UTC,you can fuse Izanagi-No-Okami for the next playthrough   And all it takes is getting back to level 91... sigh
persona4golden,1qd61a,SpunkyDragon,2,Tue Nov 12 06:03:25 2013 UTC,I don't think there are any benefits transferred based on the ending. IIRC it's just money and Persona compendium that carries over in NG+.
persona4golden,1qd61a,TianDogg,1 point,Mon Nov 11 20:16:39 2013 UTC,"To that end, since aside from money, ""you can't take it with you,"" consider choosing an endgame party and completing the boss with minimal items.  Sell off all your equipment not currently worn by your final four, and sell your curatives and collectibles and simply beat the game with the most money possible."

persona4golden,1pzxal,SpunkyDragon,1 point,Thu Nov 7 02:15:14 2013 UTC,"One theory I've heard is that it has something to do with the new character in P4: Climax since someone pointed out that the shade of red used is similar to his hair color.  Even if that's true (which I'm personally a bit skeptical), it's hard to speculate what this exactly is.  I haven't looked around yet, but have they announced a site for P4: Climax yet?"

persona4golden,1p9qcm,SpunkyDragon,3,Sat Oct 26 19:08:47 2013 UTC,"If this is your first time playing a Persona game ever, then allow me to clear up some misconceptions.  Basically it's like this:  There are 20-some socials links in the game, one for each arcana, and they all go from rank 0 to 10.  This is what you know already.  In most cases, you go through a social link, helping them with their problems and eventually getting the ""bff speech"" when you max them out.  This you probably also know.  When you max out a social link, you've basically done all that you need for it.  You get the max EXP bonus from fusions, and you can fuse the strongest one.  As horrible and unrealistic as this sounds, you don't need to hang out with them anymore.  As a matter of fact, you shouldn't, your efforts should be focused on working on your other social links.  Obviously by this point you know that when you max a girl's social link, you have the option to enter an intimate relationship with them.  Once you do though, it's like I said above, there's really no point to spend time with them anymore.  There are, however, special events in the game where you can invite any girl that you are dating (you asked for no spoilers so I won't give any specific examples, but know that you can go on ""dates"", but only for particular events).  As for why Rise seems to be missing, I honestly don't know.  How did you finish her social link, as friends or lovers?"
persona4golden,1p9qcm,JammyBurger,2,Sat Oct 26 23:18:26 2013 UTC,"Wish I could help you, but it sounds like you're on the True Ending path which I've never done. Also never maxed out Rise's social link. So basically, my comment is useless."
persona4golden,1p8cvf,MrTheJackThePerson,9,Sat Oct 26 01:10:19 2013 UTC,Pad your walls so your vita doesn't break when you throw it.
persona4golden,1p8cvf,sneauxoui,3,Sat Oct 26 19:10:19 2013 UTC,"Fuse like crazy and grind, you already know boss routines so as long as your well leveled and equipped it should be cake."
persona4golden,1p8cvf,tranzart,3,Sat Oct 26 04:17:59 2013 UTC,"My recommendation is not to jump directly to very hard since its the same thing as hard but with more grinding.  Tip 1: Fuse and grind a lot. Killing gold hands in the previous dungeon is usually the way to grind(until you get megidola and mind charge).  Tip 2: Max out teammate social links as soon as possible. You should know what party you are gonna run to minimize grinding(applies mostly to when you have everyone). Other social links of interest are Justice, Hierophant and Tower. (Tower because Yoshitsune is op.)  Tip 3: Abuse cup cards.  Tip 4: Buy tap sodas.  Tip 5: Abuse weaknesses and guard when necessary.  Tip 6: Get Invigorate as quickly as possible to minimize grinding for chalet cards.(At level 17, Sarasvati learns invigorate 2).  Tip 7: Don't fight anything that is a tank, knight or magus. If you can't kill them in a single ""player"" phase, they will most likely one-shot you."

Didn't go into any of them though since I wasn't there to gamble my yen away (I was spending my yen on stuff I wanted.) Maybe if I go back to study I might check out on of those pachinko places and see if they have the persona 4 slot machines then.

I'm sure it's possible without it, but you'd probably have to be almost perfect in how you time your button presses. As long as you have the triangle ability, you can basically just hang in there and break even results until the triangle prompts come in and take advantage of those.  As long as you don't press the regular reel button while it's in the red zone or when the middle meter is depleted, you should turn out alright."

persona4golden,1m45mj,spacemonk42,3,Tue Sep 10 17:03:52 2013 UTC,"1) No, the maximum amount of skills a persona can learn is 8.  2) Chie and Yosuke cannot learn skills from skill cards, they can only get skills from leveling up, social links or bike rides. If anyone(party members or personas) learns a skill after they have 8 skills, you're allowed to replace any of the skills.  3) A skill's strength is determined by what the skill is(agilao is stronger than agi) and your persona's base stats(magic increases magic skill damage, strength increases physical skill damage).  4) Yes. Equipment can also deal with character stats but persona stats are the most important."
persona4golden,1m45mj,blueasian,1 point,Tue Sep 10 20:45:01 2013 UTC,"You might have answered a question I didn't ask which was ""how do I know which skills are better?"".  For example, if you're playing FF then it's pretty obvious that Bolt 4 is better than Bolt 2. I guess the longer the name of thee skill (provided it uses another skill as it's root) the better the skill."
persona4golden,1m45mj,SpunkyDragon,3,Wed Sep 11 01:38:24 2013 UTC,"To put it simply, there are 4 ""levels"" of strength that skills (both magic and physical) are classified into: Light, Medium, Heavy, and Severe.  The skill description will tell you which ""level"" it belongs to.  For example, Zio (thunder spell) progresses like this:  Zio (light) -> Zionga (medium) -> Ziodyne (heavy) -> Thunder Reign (severe)"
persona4golden,1m45mj,DaraKun,2,Thu Sep 12 17:23:26 2013 UTC,"You'll begin to recognize the patterns pretty quickly. Besides, the skills have descriptions, so you should know why Bufula is better than Bufu as soon as you get Bufula."

persona4golden,1m0ilx,GameBoy09,3,Mon Sep 9 04:04:40 2013 UTC,"Youtube is broken when it comes to copyright. They do not check almost anything out. If a corporation claims something they will take it down with no investigation at all. They don't care. The only way this is going to be fixed is if Atlus steps in and sues the actress, youtube, or both. I hope they attack both because youtube needs to be fixed. The ability to just take down anything with a certain word the name is complete BS. I wish more could be done."
persona4golden,1m0ilx,CountryTechy,2,Mon Sep 9 21:25:20 2013 UTC,"It's not so much that YouTube is broken when it comes to copyright, it's more the actual copyright laws themselves are broken when it comes to dealing with this sort of digital content. YouTube is pretty much forced to have this sort of takedown stuff automated, because otherwise they would be a lot more liable for any infringing content that their users upload.  Saying that, YouTube would do well to improve the way they deal with these sorts of issues, but alas, they have literally no incentive to as there is no viable alternative to YouTube. What else are you gonna do, upload your videos to Dailymotion? :/"
persona4golden,1m0ilx,leslij55,2,Mon Sep 9 22:01:19 2013 UTC,Yeah but they let the companies walk all over everyone. You can claim that it is a wrong copyright claim but they can just deny it. What's the point when they have that capability? When SEGA was claiming a huge amount of videos they even took down reviews. That is pure as can be corporate censorship. That is strictly illegal in the U.S. which is where the creator was from. Totalbiscuit still wont do SEGA published games because of this.
persona4golden,1m0ilx,CountryTechy,2,Mon Sep 9 22:11:21 2013 UTC,"Ugh, I remember reading about this last night. Copyright laws have gone beyond bullshit. Youtube itself has been irritating me in general lately (stop defaulting to my gmail account even though I repeatedly tell you not to, goddammit), but the basis on which it obliterates videos has been consistently awful. I wish there were a suitable alternative for the non-corporate content makers to flock to (I like vimeo, but I don't really know how it compares to Youtube in various aspects). Of course, there's no way of stopping the same thing from eventually happening to those alternatives either. Sigh."

Their elements really only apply to their weaknesses and resistances.  You don't get a same type attack bonus like in pokemon."
persona4golden,1lhh9o,Laxfly,1 point,Sat Aug 31 23:47:39 2013 UTC,"In addition to this, some personas are more likely to learn certain types of skills and others are completely unable to learn certain types.  If there's a skill card for something, you can theoretically fuse a persona to do anything though if you feel like grinding their stats up.  Just keep in mind the use of boost/amp skills.  The introduction of skill cards and letting you choose which skills get passed on manually really streamlined the fusion process in Persona 4 Golden."
persona4golden,1lhh9o,pezki,1 point,Sun Sep 1 02:19:41 2013 UTC,"Thanks! That actually helps a lot! I had a level 78 that I bought from the compendium, and a level 30 Izanagi. Thought Izanagi would be more powerful than the level 78 at some point, because I was thinking along the lines of pokemon where your starter is usually one of the more powerful ones you can get a hold of."
persona4golden,1l248v,pearson530,6,Sun Aug 25 15:11:49 2013 UTC,"I understand what you are asking. The persona will only register ito your compendium once you have put it in your inventory. It does not register if you just select the card and just put it away. I tried to get my compendium registered faster like that, but it doesnt work."
persona4golden,1l248v,dualstrike98,3,Sun Aug 25 17:27:01 2013 UTC,"Registering a Persona occurs once you accept it into your heart (take it into your hand). If you want to register it at a higher level with different skills by talking to Margaret, you can do that, too. But if you just want to have it registered as is, just pick it in the shuffle and don't release it.  Hope this helps."
persona4golden,1l248v,XCGunther,-2,Mon Aug 26 14:11:19 2013 UTC,"What do you mean by registered? If you're talking about the compendium, that's something you have to do manually by going to the Velvet Room. I think you have to buy the Persona back after that, too, but then you can buy it as many times as you want."
persona4golden,1l2ah0,DaraKun,3,Sun Aug 25 17:02:15 2013 UTC,"Incredibly good, but it's a little more unforgiving that P4G. The story is strong and the combat is excellent but the dungeons are more of a grind."
persona4golden,1l2ah0,GunstarGreen,1 point,Mon Aug 26 15:30:42 2013 UTC,"Yes, though, though a little different than P3FES and P4 in that the cutscenes are presented like a visual novel, and all the non-dungeon traversal is done through a point and click interface.  It has some gameplay improvements over FES, though if you're playing P3 for the first time, I'd probably go for that over P3P."

If you don't have a PSP that can play the original, then simply wait for the Vita release that's coming out in early 2014.   While the Persona 4 anime is easily the best video game adaptation he's done compared to Devil Survivor 2 which was absolutely horrific, Dangan suffered from the side effect of having a stupidly little amount of episodes, so everything is rushed and no free time events with anyone is had. I'm still following it because I've beat the game and it's fun to watch the characters I've been with for 30 odd hours animated, but it's legitimately just a disservice watching only the anime, because you're getting every little thing spoiled with no substance."

All signs were pointing toward ASW giving up on Arena.  Even from the beginning with Chrono Phantasma's announcement days before Arena's U.S. release.  And then there has been silence about any DLC or rebalancing.  Then XRD is announced (hell, there was the first Loketest for that a couple of weeks ago!).  The Story was the only hint at a sequel.  But, until this Shadow Form announcement, it would've been hard to continue it as a fighting game.  Seeing through the ruse of the P-1, there'd be no reason to fight each other.  Well, now we can have them fight shadows.  As far as the Adachi bit, does he still have his powers?"

Since Shadow Labrys already exists, would there also be a Shadow Mode Normal Labrys with Ariadne?  Guess we'll have to wait for cleaner information.  Really excited to see this feature though; it's like Chrono Phantasma's Overdrive on steroids.  You have to commit at the character select screen.  Hopefully they balance it better than Alpha's -isms.  Beyond that though, is it helps solve the story's main problem.  Why would the IT/Shadow Ops be fighting each other again?

persona4golden,1jjmpq,HydraVea,2,Fri Aug 2 04:20:59 2013 UTC,"So a few things, stay away from this sub (if you didn't know to already) due to some major spoilers going on.  Come back when in the game you hit december and it says something along the lines of, major changes are happening it is recommended to save now. We can help you out to make sure you get the actual ending to the game."
persona4golden,1jjmpq,chewytheshark,1 point,Fri Aug 2 05:07:55 2013 UTC,"Thanks for the heads up. I already realized I am not safe here. I try to stay away from any thread that contains spoilers. I am 7 and a half hours in the game now and the date is April 27 Evening. Except some quiz answers, I try to not to look at any guides while playing the game, because playing blind is really fun to me. So, if I can't get the true ending on my first run, there are always 15 more save slots to go."
persona4golden,1jjmpq,CountryTechy,2,Fri Aug 2 05:59:40 2013 UTC,I think most titles will tell if there are spoilers to come. The ones that are about what happens in the game usually give a time period/month. Sometimes a boss is spoiled but once you see the pattern you will know who most of who will be kidnapped.
persona4golden,1jjmpq,CountryTechy,1 point,Fri Aug 2 07:08:32 2013 UTC,"Yes, I noticed the pattern after the first boss. even before that I was sure who will be gone first. If the game continues to follow the same things on every victim, the spoilers on here will not have much affect on me. I already have some ideas on who will be the next victim."
persona4golden,1jjmpq,chewytheshark,1 point,Fri Aug 2 14:37:59 2013 UTC,If you get stuck on any bosses go back through the subreddits past posts and if the boss you need help on hasn't been discussed or you can't find anything usefull you can ask for help here.

persona4golden,1jjmpq,ViciousBearMauling,1 point,Fri Aug 2 14:46:15 2013 UTC,Afterwards you should definitely check out persona 4 the animation. It is truly brilliant. And awesome. Slightly different but so good.
persona4golden,1jj3ph,CountryTechy,5,Thu Aug 1 23:46:50 2013 UTC,"I think that Persona is a game entirely unsuitable for multiplayer, and I'd really rather they not try to force it in - Too many games try to add a multiplayer mode these days, where one isn't necessary. It generally takes time and resources away from the single player campaign.  Also, I can't really see pvp being all that fun, to be honest. Still, neat concept."
persona4golden,1jj3ph,TheKDM,0,Fri Aug 2 00:02:49 2013 UTC,They could have a differnt studio develop the matchmaking parts and just use the assets from the main game.Maybe it could be a new way to grind. Get a normal amount of XP for loosing and a boost for winning and more depending on the higher level the enemy's persona. Also set it so you could decide if you want all levels or levels about yours that you would fight.
persona4golden,1jj3ph,Grotpar,1 point,Fri Aug 2 02:14:54 2013 UTC,"Getting a normal boost for losing would probably lead to some people cheating Call of Duty boosting style. It would be cool if you could bet your personas on a fight. It would just be cool to test your personas against others in general, I think. Anyone against the PVP option in general doesn't make sense to me. Seriously, in a turn-based RPG, adding a Pokemon-esque PVP system shouldn't be that hard."
persona4golden,1jj3ph,sneauxoui,0,Fri Aug 2 02:44:55 2013 UTC,"I'm not saying a ""boost"" for loosing. Just a set acceptable amount of XP for playing and just get more for winning. Everything else I agree with"

persona4golden,1jdpjp,Redtoemonster,1 point,Wed Jul 31 03:31:39 2013 UTC,"I wonder if I can do the same in P3:FES. I just started it a hour ago, and it'll probably come in handy at some point."
persona4golden,1jdpjp,Anticlockwise,2,Wed Jul 31 03:45:25 2013 UTC,I haven't play FES but I assume it's the same. If your not full health and one of your party has any dia skill open the menu and select skills. In there you can select skills to use outside of battle. So if someone has died and you have no revival items you can just use recarm
persona4golden,1jdpjp,Thurid,2,Wed Jul 31 04:09:42 2013 UTC,"You definitely can in FES. However, it's a bit different since you have to talk directly to the party member and ""request healing."""

persona4golden,1j9guf,CountryTechy,2,Mon Jul 29 06:39:17 2013 UTC,By no means no. The final boss goes though a bunch of forms so your beat bet is having a varied team to make sure you don't get caught off guard.

persona4golden,1j9guf,CrackLawliet,1 point,Mon Jul 29 18:52:54 2013 UTC,"I played FES, so my information may be contrary to Portable strategy. What I did was I used Thanatos as a main for a very long time, until reaching 80ish. After that I accepted Elizabeth's request to kill the Reaper. Doing that opens the Monad Depths, and from experience I can say you will level up in a snap. That's how I managed to get Messiah before the last days, and I managed to beat the final floors of the game on the last day in a matter of minutes."
persona4golden,1j9guf,CrackLawliet,1 point,Mon Jul 29 18:51:37 2013 UTC,I think for portable has all the same changes as FES but none of the content after the game. Did you pass down strong moves to Thanatos because personally mine's not very good.

Second movie covering from that point until the end of The Journey seems likely, with the third movie covering The Answer."
persona4golden,1itp1r,akeyjavey,2,Tue Jul 23 05:26:13 2013 UTC,Judging from The title and that they are separating the game into 4 movies I take it that this will cover all events throughout the Spring season
persona4golden,1is1et,BIGxM1KE,3,Sun Jul 21 23:49:52 2013 UTC,"I remember being lv.79 when I fought her on my first playthrough(on normal). I didn't have Trumpeter but I still managed to beat her. Trumpeter is just insanely useful for boss fights(Debilitate is an amazing skill) so I suggest you should grind(probably in Mangatsu Inaba) to get him. Also when you grind, you should be able to get Mediarahan(lv.65) or Salvation(lv.74) on Yukiko which would be REALLY helpful. As for other personas, you should have one that knows at least Marakukaja since buffs are really important."
persona4golden,1is1et,blueasian,1 point,Mon Jul 22 00:16:51 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I have Mediarahan on Yukiko right now. I'm just not ever in the habit  of using buffs in any game really, and its biting me in the ass right now. I've replaced any buff type skill with something that does damage and I'm regreting it. I have one or two buff skills on either Kanji or Naoto right now. Chie, Yosuke, and Teddie are all around level 40 for me right now. Should I work on leveling any of them for the fight in place of Kanji or Naoto?"
persona4golden,1is1et,Kingpin-Of-Steel,2,Mon Jul 22 06:12:15 2013 UTC,"Well, if you really have no buff skills you could level up Teddie and at levels 42, 58 and 70 he should learn Matarukaja, Marakukaja and Mediarahan respectively.   Plus, you always have the option of creating a persona with buffs and using them on the party yourself if you're really comfortable with the party you have. On my playthrough (very hard mode), I basically did most of the buffing while the others in my party attacked while providing the occasional buff/healing support."
persona4golden,1is1et,BloodyFenrir,3,Tue Jul 23 04:04:41 2013 UTC,"Buffs are they key here. Marakukaja, matarunda and dekaja are incredibly useful against izanami, buffing your defence whilst lowering her attack, and also nulling her stat-ups. I can't remember my exact method for getting through her intitial stage 2 nuke, but im sure it involved buffing the party whilst Yosuke dekaja'd. So having Yosuke in your party might help. And as /u/blueasian says, having yukiko with mediarahan at least makes everything a lot easier. Try grinding a little more, I've never beat it on easy, but I beat it on normal at level 85 with my party at 80."
persona4golden,1is1et,BloodyFenrir,1 point,Mon Jul 22 00:34:50 2013 UTC,"If I train Yosuke, who should I pull for him? I'm leaning to towards Kanji, since Naoto is an absolute damage powerhouse, for me at least."
persona4golden,1is1et,CountryTechy,2,Mon Jul 22 06:41:36 2013 UTC,"Well my team was Yosuke, Yukiko and Naoto. But whether that's the best choice, I don't know. I haven't actually played Golden yet, only the PS2 original, so I'm not certain, but isn't there a way to get Power Charge on Kanji in Golden? I think it's a bike skill. If your Kanji knows that, I'd say swap out Naoto, but since you say Naoto is a powerhouse, I'll assume he doesn't know Power Charge (or maybe he does but doesn't know any good moves yet; level him to learn Primal Force), in which case swapping out Kanji would be better IMO.  tl;dr: If Kanji knows Power charge, level him to learn Primal Force and he will destroy everything, and drop Naoto for Yosuke. If Kanji doesn't know Power Charge, drop him for Yosuke and keep Naoto."

Naoto is a good jack of all trades for damage type. she also gets the ability to defelct magic, i forget the name. She's really usefull because she gets the ability to use almighty damage so if you don't have any she's really good. Yukiko I think is the best healer but im not sure. I used her as a mainly a healer who covered fire attacks when needed. chie is primarily Physical due her not learning beyond Bufula. Kanji has a mix of magic and physical so I would stick with him instead. I don't know much about Yosuke or Teddie because I hardly used them"
persona4golden,1ifco6,blueasian,1 point,Tue Jul 16 21:31:03 2013 UTC,"There is no such thing as a best party but my personal favorite is Kanji(best phy dmg dealer), Yukiko(best healer/mage), and Naoto(learns all elemental -dyne skills and has no weaknesses) which is focused on raw damage output.   The other popular party is Yosuke(jack of all trades), Kanji, and Teddie(healer/buffer/mage) since this party can keep your party buffed (Chie does learn Dragon Hustle which buffs everyone's atk, def, and agility but that costs 150 sp which is a LOT for Chie).  To sum it up:  Yosuke - Great all-arounder. Can buff party's agility and remove buffs on enemies.  Chie - Best phy dmg dealer on groups. Can buff party's atk, def and agility but at a high cost. Learns Power Charge(doubles the dmg of the next phy attack).  Yukiko - Best healer and mage. Learns Salvation which heals all of your party's health and removes all status ailments. Also learns Mind Charge which doubles the dmg of her next magic attack.   Kanji - Best phy dmg dealer. Can debuff enemie's agility and buff party's attack. Also learns Power Charge.  Teddie - The other healer. Highest healing skill is Mediarahan which heals all of your party's health. Learns a lot of buffs and debuffs. He can be a great ice magic user or a great buffer/debuffer.  Naoto - Another all-arounder. Learns all elemental -dyne skills(single target only), Mind Charge, and Heat Riser(buffs a single ally's atk, def and agility). Naoto can be built to be great at normal encounters(but bad on bosses) or decent at dealing damage. I personally build Naoto with all the elements my party doesn't have and give her Mind Charge, Angelic Grace, and Shields of Justice."

persona4golden,1i8lgs,TheZozajo23,2,Sat Jul 13 23:06:40 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I don't know. There's still a few social links I haven't finished yet (The old lady, Konishi's brother and a few others) but that one seemed to not fit the game very well. It felt forced."
persona4golden,1i8lgs,CountryTechy,2,Sat Jul 13 23:19:06 2013 UTC,"I agree. Most of the dialogue I did not like, but had to choose to progress to her social link."
persona4golden,1i8lgs,doctorgrims,2,Sat Jul 13 23:46:11 2013 UTC,"It's hard to pick a favorite. I havnt completed the majority of them, (only one finished play through) but Its a tie between Chie,Naoto,Rise, and Kanji. They all made me laugh for different ways. Chie is quirky, Rise is bubbly, ( only way I know to describe her) Noato and Kanji are awkward In separate ways. While I do like the serious parts the light hearted fluff is my favorite. That in my 2nd reason I like 4 better than 3"
persona4golden,1i8lgs,ViciousBearMauling,1 point,Mon Jul 15 08:10:24 2013 UTC,"My favorite would have to Marie, Junpie, Mitsuru  I like Marie's fashion and I think she is cute   Junpie just seems like a person I would just hang with  Mitsuru cause I love how blunt she is  I hate Fuuka"
persona4golden,1i8lgs,XCGunther,1 point,Tue Jul 30 02:10:25 2013 UTC,"My favorite Persona character: Tie between Aigis and Chie (Naoto is a solid second)  Least: Junpei and maybe Yosuke (If I HAD to pick a party member) but if it's just anyone, then Ayane."
persona4golden,1i8lgs,PandaBearMC,1 point,Wed Aug 7 07:01:00 2013 UTC,"Favorite: Kanji. He's got this tough guy/shy guy thing going on and his s.link reveals him to really be a stand up guy all around even when he accidentally doesn't show it. Dojima-san was a very close second, though.  Least favorite: Saki Konishi's younger brother. Maybe it is because I enjoyed all the other s.link events so much and his was just the worst, but he was a real downer. By the end, I didn't care if I got to know him or not, issues or no issues. But that's also a hard choice to make because every character had some redeeming quality."
persona4golden,1i8lgs,Brettweiser,1 point,Mon Aug 19 13:41:06 2013 UTC,Im going with naoto as my favorite I love when she asks you if she should talk more feminine.   I dont like kanji he's a weird character to me .
persona4golden,1i63e1,CountryTechy,2,Fri Jul 12 18:24:52 2013 UTC,"I'd be keen to see a sequel to Arena. However, I'd rather it be another fighting game -  and considering the relative success of the game, i'd imagine that'll probably be the case.  For me personally, P5 should not follow on from it directly. I want new characters, not P3 and 4. Half of the fun of Persona games is discovering the characters, and if I already know them...well, there's that gone."
persona4golden,1i63e1,ohez,1 point,Wed Jul 17 22:51:27 2013 UTC,"I would very much like a Persona 3 Arena, which continues the story, but with the roster being mostly P3 characters and a handful of P4.  As for getting spoiler codes to work, read the sidebar."
persona4golden,1i63e1,leslij55,0,Wed Jul 17 22:15:22 2013 UTC,I try what the sidebar says but it never works.
persona4golden,1i63e1,Waffles-No-Okami,1 point,Thu Jul 18 02:22:16 2013 UTC,"I would definitely love a P4A sequel, but in my opinion I would just like a sort of massive ""expansion""--like an absolute shit-ton of new characters. I mean, who WOULDN'T want to play as  (P3 character spoiler ahead) Koromaru? Along with them, new stories for each, maybe some additional online modes...basically it would be a Persona battle royale.  But that's just me, a complete, brand new sequel to P4A would be most optimal.  Also, to get the spoiler tag to work, you need type a [, then without any spaces after, type in what you want to be covered. At the end, put a ] to close the spoiler in brackets. After that, again without any spaces, put (/spoiler) after the enclosed spoiler. It should come up like this:  Spoiler   And here's a direct visual guide: [spoiler goes here](/ spoiler )  Just make sure there are no spaces between anything except the words in said spoiler."
persona4golden,1i63e1,Waffles-No-Okami,1 point,Thu Jul 18 04:30:52 2013 UTC,The problem I had with it being a direct sequel to P4A is the means they used to deliver the story. I dislike the Individual character stories since most of them have a little bit of different but mostly the same content. Now I can't fully judge it because I haven't gone through them all but It seems that way. On the subject of the spoiler tag; I was confused on where the spoiler went. I've worked a little with HTML but its been awhile so I wanted to put it between the [] and (/spoiler). So it should work like this Thank you very much
persona4golden,1i63e1,Waffles-No-Okami,1 point,Thu Jul 18 04:43:30 2013 UTC,"I suppose you're right---pretty much each character's story (that I'm guessing you've seen so far) is basically ""what if THIS character won?"". Even though the ""True"" ending is there, there was an awful lot of ""what if"" in the deliverance...I see your point."
persona4golden,1hx72b,ViciousBearMauling,2,Tue Jul 9 07:09:55 2013 UTC,"Impressive, how long did it take?"
persona4golden,1hx72b,CountryTechy,1 point,Wed Jul 10 05:44:42 2013 UTC,"Thank you! :)  A little over 45 minutes, (With a few minutes of touch-up when I got home :3 ) the waiting room was fairly full. I would've made the gun more detailed if I had more time, but I started to rush when my turn with my demon dentist was coming up."
persona4golden,1hvlxk,lotria,3,Mon Jul 8 18:03:01 2013 UTC,I promise I don't bite.   Damn.
persona4golden,1hspyz,MrTheJackThePerson,3,Sun Jul 7 10:58:01 2013 UTC,Top comment on the site made me laugh
persona4golden,1hspyz,GameBoy09,2,Sun Jul 7 10:58:26 2013 UTC,It's Happening!
persona4golden,1hgkbc,Perks92,2,Mon Jul 1 23:20:57 2013 UTC,The quest didn't tip you off?
persona4golden,1hgkbc,sneauxoui,3,Tue Jul 2 00:40:43 2013 UTC,You would have thought so but I guess I was in derp mode haha
persona4golden,1hgkbc,lukegjpotter,2,Tue Jul 2 07:59:34 2013 UTC,Yoske gets a pretty cool weapon there.
persona4golden,1hesci,ViciousBearMauling,2,Mon Jul 1 05:36:49 2013 UTC,"Very cool. I like the little cat-grin you gave to Rise, haha."
persona4golden,1hesci,enkur,1 point,Mon Jul 1 16:15:27 2013 UTC,"The mouth was giving me issues for some reason, so I decided the cat-grin would look good and fit her pretty well."
persona4golden,1hesci,ShadowKitsuneXX,2,Mon Jul 1 23:23:28 2013 UTC,I love it! Loved the game and the artwork is amazing. Chie is my favorite so this is really cool. I would even pay for a colored copy if you were selling
persona4golden,1hesci,ShadowKitsuneXX,1 point,Sat Jul 6 17:51:05 2013 UTC,"Thanks for your compliment!  (Chie is also my favorite character, she is too cool)  Well, I don't have the time to really dedicate to making something for money (I would want to spend unbelievable amounts of time making it perfect) and I'll be honest this was based off of some artwork that is also being sold as a wall-scroll, It's colored in a much more vibrant way than I could do ever do without any professional pencils, I really suggest getting that. (I hope this doesn't make my drawing any less impressive xD )"
persona4golden,1hesci,Hikikomori_,2,Wed Jul 10 14:28:38 2013 UTC,"Nope, your drawing is still as epic as the first time I saw it. And dont sell yourself down like that. I'm sure whatever other picture your talking about would look like crap once you.put your heart and soul into making this one look fantastic"
persona4golden,1hdgef,lukegjpotter,2,Sun Jun 30 17:33:13 2013 UTC,"That's a pretty good idea. Although, I kinda wish the dungeons in P4G were more like P3. Maybe it's just because I've been playing a lot of P3 lately, but you can go to pretty much any skill level because instead of there only being 7 or 8 dungeons. But, for P4G this seems like a solid idea."
persona4golden,1hdgef,MrTheJackThePerson,1 point,Sun Jun 30 18:17:55 2013 UTC,"As someone who has only played P3FES so far and is planning on buying P4G soon, the concept of not getting all my Health and SP back scares me. How will I survive?!"
persona4golden,1hdgef,CrackLawliet,2,Sun Jun 30 19:31:22 2013 UTC,"What do you mean by ""not getting all my health and SP back""?"
persona4golden,1hdgef,MrTheJackThePerson,1 point,Sun Jun 30 20:23:51 2013 UTC,Going back to the equivalent of the Lobby and just healing entirely to keep going...for free that is. So many changes in between the two games make me nervous to start.
persona4golden,1hdgef,CrackLawliet,3,Sun Jun 30 21:21:35 2013 UTC,You should be fine. It's much different when it comes to dungeons.
persona4golden,1hdgef,MrTheJackThePerson,1 point,Sun Jun 30 21:24:11 2013 UTC,Thanks!
persona4golden,1hdgef,CrackLawliet,1 point,Sun Jun 30 21:26:09 2013 UTC,"you can get your SP restored for a price, if you don't do the Hermit social link it's pretty expensive, also you don't get anywhere near as much money from dungeons. I think I only broke 100k yen a few times and 200k once."
persona4golden,1hdgef,CountryTechy,1 point,Wed Jul 17 06:46:18 2013 UTC,"You don't get tired or sick from being in the dungeons too long in P4 though, so it kinda balances out."
persona4golden,1hc4zu,CountryTechy,5,Sat Jun 29 23:45:44 2013 UTC,"As someone who didn't do adachis social link on the first one and is now doing it on the second run, I find myself yelling at my vita saying things like ""yeah well fuck you adachi"" and ""nobody cares about your shit dickhead"" its kind of funny. Otherwise im enjoying the new conversation options and the like."
persona4golden,1hc4zu,PandaBearMC,1 point,Sun Jun 30 15:23:11 2013 UTC,I didn't do his on my first and intend to on this one but I will not enjoy it.
persona4golden,1hc4zu,Shaedana,2,Sun Jun 30 15:24:52 2013 UTC,"Actually I ended up enjoying the Adachi S.Link and his character way more the second time through.  He's narcistic, misogynistic dumbass and I love him for that. You can read a lot between the lines and he's actually quite humane instead of being evil 'just because'.  ""You kids have no idea what kind of shit I've been through!"" - one of my favourite lines in the game because (first time) it was true but we already knew that it wasn't as big deal/relevant as Adachi himself thought :)  Also I recommend finishing Marie's S.Link if you didn't do it the first time."
persona4golden,1hc4zu,NBKxSmokey,1 point,Mon Jul 1 02:46:34 2013 UTC,I didn't know Marie was as Important as she is so I didn't this time I intend to.
persona4golden,1h0fjt,CountryTechy,2,Tue Jun 25 02:25:28 2013 UTC,"56h 8m.  I was already pretty familiar with a lot of the game through watching Giant Bomb's endurance run, so I managed to plough through fairly quickly.  I also may have played on easy..."
persona4golden,1h0fjt,leslij55,1 point,Wed Jul 17 22:24:53 2013 UTC,Depends what ending you got :D
persona4golden,1h0fjt,DaraKun,1 point,Sun Aug 25 17:24:08 2013 UTC,True ending on first playthrough 94 hours 6 mins
persona4golden,1h0fjt,SSGotenks650,1 point,Mon Aug 26 00:09:25 2013 UTC,1st throphy on 27/07 & just finished the game with true ending on 8/09. So took me 6 weeks with 65h 53m of total play time.
