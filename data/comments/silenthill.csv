I'm curious if any of them had enough interest in the source material to look into them, discovering the wide world of convoluted theories and heated debates surrounding them.

I remember being confused as to why I couldn't download it directly onto the Vita, since it's one of those titles that you have to download to a PS3 and transfer to a Vita to make work.  As for L2/R2 functionality, you can remap the controls to the L/R buttons, and delegate the L1/R1 buttons to either the touchpad or the touchscreen, or even the right stick if you want to sacrifice having an Analog Mode (which is fine on a game like Silent Hill).  This is somewhat feasible because L1/R1 (iirc) are the strafe buttons, which are awkward to use effectively in SH1 and are probably ignored my most players anyway.  You might want to remap a L1+R1 macro since it's a useful 180 degree turn."

Not to mention the fact that Kojima has flatout left Konami now and KojiPro has been disbanded. This whole event was a clusterfuck with things coming apart, as opposed to the MobyDick event which was a sneaky reveal which did no damage."
silenthill,3dn9l3,The_Fifth_Born_King,4,Fri Jul 17 20:38:28 2015 UTC,"I just read through all the comments on this post, a lot of back and forth with this theory so I'm going to weigh-in. Does OP make a lot of great and speculative connections? Yes. Does this actually seem realistic? N-   Have any of you ever thought that Allison Road isn't real? A direct statement from the company pointed out that the 13 minute video walkthrough they posted was not going to be in the actual game. That's strange, isn't it? I mean as many of you have stated it feels a lot less polished than PT but perhaps the video, the channel, the 6 person dev team are all...fake.   Hear me out. A while ago, not long after MGS5 was announced, maybe a few months after, Kojima announced it would be his last MGS. If my memory serves me right, this announcement was before PT was released. What if Kojima knew the direction Konami was heading in and wanted out? Let's say he then goes on to come up with this plan to make his first big breakout game with new studio after he leaves Konami? After all I'm pretty sure even though he's the creator of MGS, Konami owns the rights to it. He knew that if he left he'd have nothing to fall back on so he approaches Konami with a proposal, he wants to make the next Silent Hill. It's a brilliant plan, SH is another huge IP that's been long overdue for a true reboot, right? He gets Del Toro on the phone, they discuss plans for this new SH BUT he also divulges his coup to Del Toro.   He gathers some of his most loyal KojPro employees and has them start work on new horror game entirely, and out of that group he has a few of them take what's being worked on and create the scapegoat we now know as Allison Road. You know where I'm going with this?  Meanwhile over at Konami, Kojima hands over a snippit of what he's working on to Konami which will later be known as PT, either an actual piece of his full/real game or something similar to what Allison Road has shown us but made with more people obviously, this one has to look good or you know he may lose his opportunity.  Whoever's in charge loves it. Kojima then tells them that they need to pull the whole MGS5 thing again but make it even better, and let the fans discover what PT truly is. Plans are made, and PT is offhandedly released to the public, the world implodes with excitement. On the side, he has his undercover team announce Allison Road and flies heavily under the radar as planned.  Months pass and there's not any updated information on the new SH, everything seems...normal for a WIP AAA game. Then I believe it was at Tokyo gameshow where they showed the first and last trailer for Silent Hills. It wasn't soon after, maybe like 2-3 months after when rumors of Kojima's departure began circulating.  First Kojima left Konami and everyone feared SH was nixed, exactly what he wanted to happen, then it was. Everyone mourned, Silent Hills was dead, it wasn't coming back. Rumors soon emerged that it would return only to have them dismissed immediately by Del Toro and Norman Reedus. Everything is working out for Kojima, he has the SH fans craving, he knows they are starving for this game. All the while it's been under development, unbeknownst to Konami and the public.   Time passes and Kojima knows that MGS is gone, it's time to move on. This is his time to win back his fans. He has the small team release the walkthrough of AR and within a few weeks time the internet rejoices that a spiritual successor to PT is in the works. People talk about it more and more, and it catches fire. During all of this, Kojima begins the next phase of his plan.   In order to start anew, he disbands KojPro...but doesn't. All employees who followed him into this coup are automatically hired into his new secret company that is still unknown. More infor may come out on AR as his scapegoat to keep people talking. Fans will analyse every little detail he has orchestrated thus far, just as OP has. In a year's time when it's during the predicted launch window of AR...he pulls the plug. AR vanishes without a trace, gone. Everyone is outraged once again and the CEOs over at Konami laugh at the thought some indie devs could rip off their game just crumble. And then it appears, maybe a month later, maybe two, a new studio name followed by the names, Hideo Kojima and Guillermo Del Toro, hovering above big white font that says: ""A Title That Is Most Likely Not Anything Related To Silent Hill Or Possibly Allison Road""  And Kojima goes down in history as the greatest video game troll of all time. The End.  Tl;Dr Kojima cancels game under different name and fools us all but we get a cool horror game so yay.  Also, PT was fucking perfect but it was NOT a Silent Hill game. There's definitely something fishy going on here. That whole thing with AR and PT being announced at the same time is fucked...I think that's proof enough.  EDIT: Spelling and grammar are probably trash, I stayed up waaaaaayyyy to late writing this."
silenthill,3dn9l3,Metalcentraldialog,4,Sat Jul 18 11:18:12 2015 UTC,"Plausible enough, and while I believe this is VERY overblown, I'm willing to bet on it. Yes you can say Konami is being stupid over what they've done, but are they really that stupid? (And no, saying ""OH BUT THEY DID THE SILENT HILL HD COLLECTION AND IT SUCKZZZZ"" isn't a fucking excuse..)  Plus...do we need to forget that SHs was a Kojima project? The man fucks with his audience!  Plus, and this is something three of my friends agreed on, the whole way the entire game looks like feels waaayy too much like the Fox Engine than the Unreal Engine. Either the devs are REALLY good at developing the atmosphere or it's Kojima and Del Toro behind the screen.   TL;RL I believe it."
silenthill,3dn9l3,brodesto,3,Sun Jul 19 06:56:09 2015 UTC,"About a quarter of your points I've actually thought to myself before reading this list, so I definitely support your theory. I don't think Konami as a whole has it in them to pull off something this well, but I do believe individuals, like the people who worked with Del Toro or Kojima, have some sort of influence on this game. Your theory may seem aweosme but crazy to other, but I believe there are some truths in here for sure. I just might be crazy too."
silenthill,3dn9l3,Plan_of_Action,2,Sat Jul 18 04:18:07 2015 UTC,"'A' for effort, man, but it doesn't have the same feel, and it is significantly less polished than P.T. It looks great, but it doesn't look like a Hideo Kojima game, and it misses graphical details that Hideo would never let slide.  It wants to be P.T., but feels like a second rate P.T. I have nothing against Allison Road and will purchase it and probably greatly enjoy it, but you know I'm right. We're talking about Hideo Kojima and Del Torro. If anything, Silent Hills would have been more polished, not less. I know this is an early build, but it just doesn't seem right. Let it go."

silenthill,3dn9l3,analbumcover,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:48:33 2015 UTC,"I REALLY wish I could believe this but it's just far too convoluted to be a real PR trick. There are many similarities because, as you said, the developers specifically modeled the game experience after PT. I have a hard time believing Del Toro and Kojima would go this far for a surprise, along with Konami. If this is a big prank, they've lost a lot of favor, customers, and likely investors for the sake of a viral marketing surprise. I think it's time to just accept the reality of the situation here. Some of these points are a real stretch (some just complete fabrication - unless you can prove it ISN'T Unreal Engine, you can't just suggest it's something else - as mentioned, you can see in some of the footage it says Unreal Engine) and the game developer community isn't that big, a lot of them run in the same circles so it's no surprise to see people who formerly worked on other projects. Going to need something much more concrete before I'm willing to even humor the idea, sadly.  Edit: Or, you know, people can just downvote wildly even though OP posted no evidence, merely theories he strung together."
silenthill,3dn9l3,Barakid,5,Fri Jul 17 20:36:15 2015 UTC,"I know a lot of the things I've mentioned were a stretch. I'm not smart enough to figure out all of the connections alone. People worked together to ""solve"" P.T. and its puzzles, but no one has done the same level of analysis for Allison Road. I can't yet offer much more in the realm of ""concrete"" clues, but I will respond to a couple of your points:  1) ""Convoluted"" is the nature of Silent Hill. There has always been this element of ""what does that message mean,"" etc., with very scattered and vague connections and clues. Even when connections are found, people don't often know what they mean (the ""holes"" in SH2/SH4).  2) The reason I don't feel it's ""too far"" is because they've done this already, meaning they've had practice.  3) Most importantly P.T. and Allison Road must have been in development at the same time in order for their reveals to be so close together. How did two separate teams come up with the same gameplay model, similar story, similar atmosphere, etc. etc. without some sort of planning?  I have read a few people's recollections that Kojima stated that Silent Hills would play off of the fears of the gaming community or something like that. This is part of the reason I'm not finding it to be so far of a stretch that he would be bringing us into the game like this."
silenthill,3dn9l3,sirlafleur,0,Fri Jul 17 21:24:12 2015 UTC,"Right, well I'm glad you acknowledge that because aside from conjecture and sheer theory there really isn't any evidence here but it's still pretty creative. Got downvoted the first time I disagreed but whatever, I'm still not convinced.  Yes, Silent Hill as a game is convoluted and puzzle-like but there's nothing puzzle-like when a major AAA title (investment) is officially announced as being cancelled, pulled from PSN, having your parent company & the development team part ways on bad terms, the parent company delists themselves from the US stock exchange and makes public statements regarding a significant change in policy when it comes to console games. That's a pretty clear sign the project is dead at least in terms of that specific incarnation of the franchise from that partnership of Konami, Kojima, Del Toro, and Reedus.  Also, how do you know ""Allison Road must have been in development at the same time in order for their reveals to be so close together?"" I can't find any information to verify anything about when development started for AR aside from Facebook but we know Silent Hills started ~2012 according to Wikipedia. PT was released a complete project in August 2014. Development on the AR Facebook can be seen in the extremely early stages a month after PT's release, nowhere near the same timeline for a product release but that's plenty of time to start the groundwork for a PT clone. Remember, these environments are mostly just repeating indoor settings - nothing too crazy to replicate. It also mentions heavily the use of Unreal Engine which would just have to be another ruse as well according to conspiracy theory. Where's the information linking the AR devs to Team Silent or Del Toro teams? I'm curious because I can't find that online anywhere either. Even if true, it still doesn't prove anything though I'll give you it would be a circumstantial link. I don't mean to argue or attack but I'm just not so easily convinced. Maybe I'm just out of the loop here on some key pieces of evidence or something but it just doesn't add up well to me. Not to say that I don't like AR or won't play it more, but it definitely isn't PT in my eyes. The pacing, mood, art direction, and production quality all differ from PT to me - seems more copycat than simultaneous original ideas."

silenthill,3d9s30,Magnison,4,Tue Jul 14 16:44:20 2015 UTC,"Dreams terrify me. Good or bad, they reveal things I think our waking selves aren't capable of understanding.   I can't remember the last time I could recall my dreams, but one that stuck with me recently involved a hotel, attempting to ride elevator up to 4th floor, yet going down and down for a long while. The panic was real as I tried to deal with what was happening. I just urgently pressed the 4th floor button even though I kept descending. At one point, the lights flickered off and when they returned, the elevator was old, wooden, and creaky. It was also really hot! When it banged to a stop, the doors whined open and I tried to scramble anywhere but forward into the hissing and industrial darkness. Man, it was truly horrifying and I awoke in a sweat. Don't know what to think of it."
silenthill,3d9s30,caughtupincrossfire,2,Tue Jul 14 19:09:14 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of two other dreams I had.  I descended through a brick well into a world where everything was on fire.  Very obviously hell. And another where I was in a Willy Wonka-esque elevator that flew through this giant subterranean room where everything was gray and almost like outer space.  I could see hell creatures scurrying around like giant cock roaches.  It was equal parts Alien, Silent Hill, and Dead Space.  Regarding my post, I wonder how many people think I'm just making it up. I've had precognitive or supposedly precognitive dreams my whole life.  This was pretty much a precognitive dream mixed with Silent Hill, which just can't be a good sign."

silenthill,3d11jl,bacon_pants,4,Sun Jul 12 21:57:37 2015 UTC,"I just finished this game and I simply do not get the hate. I rather enjoyed it. No SH game is perfect, they all have some weak points (mostly around shit combat controls--don't tell me it's on purpose, they just suck; camera is often shit too). The whole thing felt very SH through and through. The auto save was bullshit, though, that I will say.  By contrast, I finally jumped into SH3 (HD version, but no problems yet) and it just starts in such a fucked place with no context. I'm finding it hard to get into. I just beat the first boss (splitworm, I think it's called?). At least SH and SH2 gave you something. SH4, as dull as I thought it was, at least pulled me in with some intrigue as to what The Room was.  I respect that everyone has different opinions, but the pure hate for this game is weird to me."
silenthill,3d11jl,itwasquiteawhileago,7,Mon Jul 13 01:44:55 2015 UTC,"but the pure hate for this game is weird to me.   I simplify most arguments as such:   It's not a Silent Hill made by Team Silent; It's a Silent Hill made by Non-Japanese; It's not Silent Hill 2; Thus, it's a piece of garbage.   Personally, I liked SH:D. It's the most classic SH-like game since SH4, and I think it manages to get all the mood and themes right, nodding at the mechanics found in all other SH games, while also trying new stuff on its own. Some of it works, some of it doesn't, but who says a game has to be perfect? I enjoyed it and I think more people would enjoy it if they only got their heads out of their butts."
silenthill,3d11jl,AnatoleSerial,3,Mon Jul 13 05:01:13 2015 UTC,"For me, the hate comes from the limp dick enemy design across the board. By my memory, I think that Homecoming was more diverse and had more interesting designs, and I still pan it for the same reason. The designs in prior games just had a lot more punch to me, although that's very subjective. I guess I'd say to compare the Lying Figures to the screamer enemy type in Downpour and you might see my point. Not just the model design, the animations and everything. That ungodly twitch they liked to use was great for me."
silenthill,3d11jl,SeraphXIII,0,Mon Jul 13 15:35:10 2015 UTC,"I think the enemy design in Downpour is 50/50. The overworld enemies (Screamer, prisoner) are very ""meh"", but then again so are most overworld enemies in the SH series after 2, with varying degrees of success with the rest of the enemies.  I think the main problem with the enemies in Downpour is one of ""scale"", and I don't mean size. ""Monsters"" are defined by their ""Humanity"": a more human-looking monster can lose impact in a physical confrontation, while excelling at creating horror at a social/intellectual/spiritual level (Vampires, body-snatchers, possessed people); on the other hand, a completely inhuman looking monster is just a monster that has to be beaten up, only jumpscares, no impact. The right balance lies somewhere in the middle: A monster that makes you hesitate and wonder if what you're confronting is/was human at some point. That's why the nurses have always worked, but why the prisoners in Downpour don't: The nurses look broken, violent, with inhuman gait and movements. The prisoners look and behave just like aggressive humans. No true horror there.  I will agree on one more thing: The twitchy animation. I believe that two things happened: With better technology came better animation, which also reduced the need to make less ""choppy"" movements, which contributed to some of the classic monsters' creepiness.  Second, and a point I believe to be even more important: one of the big influences on the Silent Hill series got lost at some point in its development, and that's Jacob's Ladder. The first Silent Hill borrowed visual elements from this classic, while the second game also took some thematic elements (altered perceptions and memories).  Ultimately, I think the biggest hurdle faced by the Silent Hill games over time is that there's a limit on how much you can innovate, in terms of story, mechanics and monster design, with its basic setting and system without the rabid, crazy fans wrecking every attempt at refreshing the franchise. The only way is a hard reset, stripping the series from its origin and spinning it around, which is why P.T. showed so much promise, and why the cancellation of Silent Hills hit some of us more than most people."
silenthill,3d11jl,AnatoleSerial,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:15:59 2015 UTC,"So because we don't like a game for very valid and much less-generalized reasons than you claim means we have our head up our asses? Great argument!  Oh, Downpour isn't even close to the old school formula. Play Origins."
silenthill,3d11jl,AnEternalEnigma,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:42:23 2015 UTC,"Origins? You mean the game that introduced the concept of breakable weapons, and the only SH game in which you can actually control your entrances into and out of the otherworld? Super classic, all that."

silenthill,3d11jl,AnEternalEnigma,2,Thu Jul 16 05:15:29 2015 UTC,"What bothered me most about Downpour was the story. I don't want to spoil it for you if you decide to play through multiple times, but the multiple endings don't make any sense to me and made it worse each time I played through. Also, one of my favorite things about Silent Hill games is the way the story slowly unfolds through bits and pieces. I thought I'd missed a lot on my first playthrough, but I wasn't able to make much more sense of the game on subsequent plays. There's all these ""mysteries"" that just seem to go nowhere, or at least they did for me. Not trying to argue with your opinion here; I'm honestly glad you enjoyed it more than I did. I'm just curious as to whether you found the story satisfying, because that was a big let down for me."

silenthill,3cyxg0,cr0wndhunter,10,Sun Jul 12 01:21:06 2015 UTC,"Because Konami.  Clarification since I got downvoted:  Because Konami doesn't know how the hell to handle its biggest series that aren't Metal Gear Solid (and even that got botched in the last two years.)  They handed the HD Collection not to some respectable development team that they know would give the series a good treatment, but to a team most people had no clue existed, showing a propensity to just try cashing in and getting shit out quickly. Not to mention, look at the voice acting situation.  Imagine if Silent Hill 1 and 4 also were recast without an option for the original casts as Silent Hill 3 was.  This is all after handing the series to multiple western developers and constantly seeing lower sales and worse critical reception for years, mind you."

But at the same time, I won't let that cloud my opinions about the upcoming MGS game, especially after Ground Zeroes was so impressive."
silenthill,3cyxg0,swayze_crayze,2,Sun Jul 12 17:28:52 2015 UTC,"I didn't say it was about the quality of the games, nor do I think it affects Ground Zeroes or The Phantom Pain as games; it was still a fiasco all the same because this time Kojima is separating himself from Konami."

silenthill,3cyxg0,CraziBoi94,0,Mon Jul 13 23:23:22 2015 UTC,I also believe it had to do with that they hadn't backed up the original source codes for the games. Therefor they had to basically remake them.
silenthill,3cyxg0,Prah2013,3,Sun Jul 12 14:04:34 2015 UTC,"Bluepoint does this anyway, by reverse engineering the final released copies. They did this with God of War Collection (I and II), Ico, Shadow of the Colossus, Metal Gear Solid HD Collection (2, 3, Peace Walker), and currently Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection.  Hijinx and Konami have bullshit excuses for the HD Collection being as bad as it was."

silenthill,3cyxg0,HayabusaZeroZ,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:43:49 2015 UTC,Is that why you have the option to use original voices in 2 but not 3?
silenthill,3cyxg0,Prah2013,2,Sun Jul 12 14:46:39 2015 UTC,"Correct, although there was trouble with the voice actors from SH2 as well because they first didn't want their voices reused."
silenthill,3cyxg0,SensuousHanar,2,Sun Jul 12 14:49:53 2015 UTC,"The problem was more that Konami wanted them to sign away any royalties for their voices or motion capture work. So when presented with these new contracts, the original cast attempted to negotiate better terms. Eventually they just signed and had their work get reused by Konami for free."
silenthill,3cyxg0,AnEternalEnigma,2,Mon Jul 13 23:52:33 2015 UTC,"In SH4's case, adding it would have pushed it to two discs, and there was no way Konami was doing that."
silenthill,3cyxg0,Ghostspider1989,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:13:38 2015 UTC,The reason was according to Tom Hulette (may have spelled his last name wrong) Is that they weren't very popular games in the series and fans wouldn't want them. His words not mine.
silenthill,3cyxg0,Room_312,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:16:40 2015 UTC,"What I heard was that SH1 wasn't included for technical reasons, and SH4 wasn't because it didn't have that great of a reputation among Silent Hill fans.

silenthill,3cyxg0,ShetlandJames,3,Sun Jul 12 12:42:19 2015 UTC,"People (wrongly) get the impression that it was a game which was average and so the studio bought the rights to call it SH4. While that's not the case, I can really see why that could have been the case. I thought that it was a poor man's SH4 but I know there's other users here who love it and that's cool too."

silenthill,3cyxg0,jesuthewise,-3,Sun Jul 12 17:58:18 2015 UTC,Lol no I think you might have misunderstood me. I wasnt tryin to start any kind of argument just sayin you as one person isnt enough to claim a game good. Its great you loved it but it just didnt really seem to take much of a following. But for me SH stopped being really good after SH3.
silenthill,3cyxg0,ausnick2001,3,Sun Jul 12 18:03:19 2015 UTC,Again I wasn't trying to claim it as 'good' or whatever. Just looking for someone to give me some reasons!
silenthill,3cyxg0,SensuousHanar,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:13:23 2015 UTC,It's because it was very different from the first 3 (first person sections in the room) and the protagonist was seen by many to be annoyingly stupid. Though I agree with you that it is still a fantastic game.
silenthill,3cyxg0,jesuthewise,0,Mon Jul 13 23:54:50 2015 UTC,Silent Hill 1 was probably because of the age. They would have to pull a Resident Evil 1 and pretty much remake the game which would probably take too long. And Silent Hill 4 if I remember correctly wasnt supposed to even be a Silent Hill game. They just threw that stuff in there last minute because they were worried a new horror game wouldnt do as well as a SH game.
silenthill,3cyxg0,HayabusaZeroZ,2,Sun Jul 12 12:42:42 2015 UTC,"No, they wouldn't have to remake the game.  Nobody complains about Metal Gear Solid: The Legacy Collection (which includes the first two Metal Gear games and almost every numbered Metal Gear Solid title before MGSV) having the PS1 original version of Metal Gear Solid.  The stuff about Silent Hill 4's origins keeps getting debated, but the short of it is: Konami stuck to the fan favorites that sold the best, which (discounting the first game) are 2 and 3."

silenthill,3cyxg0,jesuthewise,0,Mon Jul 13 18:14:55 2015 UTC,"""It's certainly a dramatic change alright, but rumour has it that the game didn't even start life as a Silent Hill project.

silenthill,3cx81t,mintorment,5,Sat Jul 11 16:06:27 2015 UTC,"This has been asked countless times, and you'll always get polarizing opinions on this subject.  There are still huge problems with the HD Collection.  Silent Hill 3 has only the new voice cast (which I felt did a terrible job.) Both games still have performance issues, like the overly long black screen transitions that can actually lead to you getting attacked and not seeing. The color is washed out and the image is stretched badly. Sounds have been rearranged in various scenes. Textures have been changed as well. One of the most important cut scenes in Silent Hill 2 has been ruined by a stupid and completely unnecessary border.  I feel that Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill 3 are games worth playing on the right systems, or not at all.  *Silent Hill 2 is best on PS2, for the Greatest Hits version. It's also good on the Xbox, for the Restless Dreams version. The PC port is OK, but not without some issues.  *Silent Hill 3 is equally good on PS2 and PC, with the PC port having improved visuals."
silenthill,3cx81t,HayabusaZeroZ,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:34:32 2015 UTC,You have a source on the PS2 version of 2 being the best? I happen to own all 3 versions and the ps2 version was my least favorite of the bunch. Loading times feel longer and the game looked washed out and horrible. It was playable but the Xbox version looked so much more vibrant and the PC version is much faster loading.
silenthill,3cx81t,Bamboobag_Pandarrell,2,Sat Jul 11 17:52:48 2015 UTC,"The CG cut scenes in Greatest Hits run at 60FPS, while they run at maybe 30FPS on the Xbox version (don't remember how they run on PC.) Overall, it's the best performing version I've played, and I've played the game now on PS2, Xbox, and PC. The sound mixing is also slightly better and the fog effects are best on PS2 too, but those might be harder to notice.  Restless Dreams on the Xbox has slightly better anti-aliasing, so fewer jaggies, a crisper overall image due to 480p support, and I believe the flashlight looks a little...different. Not better per say. It's nearly equal to the PS2 version.  PC version's only pluses are being moddable (which is of course a really great advantage) and having quick save and a cut scene viewer. It's still the buggiest version though. Without tinkering, this is the second worst version to play (absolute worst being HD Collection) but with tinkering, it can be pretty good. I prefer the PS2 version still.  Here's a link detailing some of the main differences."
silenthill,3cx81t,HayabusaZeroZ,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:06:46 2015 UTC,"It's just funny because that's pretty much the complete opposite of my experience. I'll concede the framerate during the cutscenes may have been better on the PS2 version- I didn't really pay a great deal of attention to that difference- but in every other way the xbox version looked more vibrant. The colors had more depth, the load times seemed much faster, and the game just seemed snappier overall.   The PC version is clearly the best as it's the only version you can really get HD out of (unless you count the PS3-360 version, which I assume we aren't). The HD support alone is worth the win for that version. Also the load times aren't really comparable. The game loads much faster on PC, even on my ancient XP rig."
silenthill,3cx81t,Bamboobag_Pandarrell,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:38:37 2015 UTC,"As I said, the Xbox has a crisper image when it's played in 480p.  I don't think HD is honestly a selling point for a game like Silent Hill 2. Sure it lets you see all the little texture details, but...part of the point of the game's design is purposely obscuring vision. Note how dark the game is for 60% of the time. How the monsters twitch while moving so you can't really get a good look at them unless they're dead (or are mannequins which give a great jump-scare due to their nature.) There's also film grain.  I won't say HD is worse, but I also won't say it's better; it's really up to preference. For me, I prefer my Silent Hill looking less clean and more dirty.  Loading is of course better on a PC; you have far more RAM and a faster read on your hard drive."
silenthill,3cx81t,HayabusaZeroZ,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:26:12 2015 UTC,"I should have clarified, and I legit am sorry I didn't, I played both my xbox and ps2 versions through the same tv, an old SD Emerson CRT.   I don't really know what else to say in response. I think my preference would be to play in HD if given the choice."

I think the game was worth it just for that game. Then I tried to play Silent Hill 3. There seemed to be something weird with the achievements. When I defeated the first boss (the giant worm thing) the frame rate went in the toilet. Probably took around 5 minutes to clear up. Turned off the Xbox and went back to it a few days later. Defeated the worm and frame rate was even worse to the point of freezing.  I searched about it online and found some people had the same problem but not everyone. It had something to do with the game checking to see if you already had the achievement but it was never fixed. Oh well, Silent Hill 2 was worth it for me."
silenthill,3cx81t,MerryHeretic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:08:11 2015 UTC,"My personal opinion is that the best way to play it is the PS2 version emulated on PC with PCSX2. It upscales amazingly well.

Alessa calls out to her good self which is why Cheryl went to Silent Hill (SH1). I think at the end of the game, when Alessa and Cheryl are reunited they become one forming a reincarnated Alessa: Heather. So actually, the baby that Harry finds at the end represents the birth of Heather / rebirth of Alessa.   Definitely a complicated timeline, if you're really curious I recommend diving into Translated Memories, Lost Memories translated into English. Here's a link to a semi-descriptive and visual timeline: Alessa's History"
silenthill,3cvbmw,nukethechildren,2,Sat Jul 11 02:40:24 2015 UTC,"Cheryl is the the embodiment of any good that is left of Alessa.   Correction: Cheryl is half of Alessa's soul. You're prolly confused by the movie, where Sharon is the good part of Alessa's soul. But if we're talking about the GAME CANON, strictly speaking, Cheryl is never specified to be the ""good part""."
silenthill,3cvbmw,AlexKaza,2,Sat Jul 11 06:30:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, especially since Alessa is pretty much pure good in the games on her own. Cheryl is just a normal little girl - not bad in any sense, but in some ways not even as ""good"" as Alessa, if we were to judge by one's actions."
silenthill,3cvbmw,Miss_Darko,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:21:03 2015 UTC,everything is clear now. The only thing that make me  doubt its that at the end  we  did not see cheryl.  When i think about it the first movie was not that far from the game story.  Thanks for helping me understand everything. I might start a new game of 3  Sadly i have the HD version.
silenthill,3cvbmw,Miss_Darko,2,Sat Jul 11 03:10:08 2015 UTC,"Dahlia says it in the game: when you see the little girl running around as various points in the game, that's Cheryl. Alessa is presumably bed-ridden throughout most of the game (you see her at the end in bandages in a wheelchair), so Cheryl is one you see throughout the town. However, you don't know it's her because she's in Alessa's clothes the whole time, because at that point she's already returned to being Alessa, even though she's still separated.  I think the movie has a lot of the same general beats to it, but the characters and motivations are completely different than in the game. Some characters, like Dahlia and Alessa, are practically the opposite of who they are and what they stand for in the game. I think it's a good movie on its own, and a better adaptation than most video game movies get, but it's still not a great adaptation."

silenthill,3cqofe,DennG,3,Fri Jul 10 09:35:56 2015 UTC,I feel like the additional grimy textures in the original made it look a bit artistically better.  They just need to muck up the textures in this a bit more to get it to look more like the original.  I would really enjoy a small game based on the apartment levels in SH4. That seems very doable considering they pretty much already made the apartment.

silenthill,3cpeoq,-Mirgeaux-,17,Thu Jul 9 18:34:16 2015 UTC,"I like both of 'em, but they're two different types of horror to me.  Resident Evil is a little more fun scary, whereas Silent Hill is a little more dread scary.  In Resident Evil, for example, if I see a huge window taking up most of the scene, I can bet money something is gonna come crashing through it. Woah! You got me! The window crashed! I jumped! Ahh! Now I fear windows! Ha ha!  In Silent Hill, I'll see something like a huge window and say 'Hey, I'll bet something is gonna come crashing through that window!' ...but then nothing does. 'What? Why didn't anything come crashing through that window? Hello? ...heh, hello?' And then you'll go into another room with a window and be like 'Hey, maybe this one will have something happen.... no? Nothing? I guess I can trust windows! That other window over there I'll bet is safe as w-- AAAUAHUGHUAHGUGHUGH!'  There are plenty of moments in Silent Hill games where they could go for the jump scare or go the easy route, but they don't-- but then sometimes they do. And that's a great formula, because then you don't know what to think and are spooked out.  Resident Evil is a bit less like that. It's a fun-scary that, when I put the game down, I don't need to walk around to shake off."

silenthill,3cpeoq,HaouLeo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:02:53 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure I always think about windows and jump scares because of this really old Penny Arcade comic I remember from a long time ago.
silenthill,3cpeoq,doug,4,Mon Jul 13 18:10:58 2015 UTC,"The first couple of games are very SH feeling. I used to play the first one when I was a kid and remember being scared out of my mind. I bought the HD Remake, and it looks way better than I remember (because all the graphics have been redone) and the fear now is still very much there, even though I know what happens. What instills the fear is really the survival portion of the survival horror genre: literally running out of ammo/health and knowing you have to trek to another side of the house through a hallway that could potentially launch enemies at you."
silenthill,3cpeoq,slandeh,3,Thu Jul 9 18:41:26 2015 UTC,What about the psychological themes? Is is surreal like SH 2?
silenthill,3cpeoq,Gvirus,3,Thu Jul 9 18:50:00 2015 UTC,"It is more of a heavy atmosphere,  not knowing what is around the corner,  not having the ammo to kill everything you encounter,  the dead silence only broken by your footsteps.  Give it a whirl."
silenthill,3cpeoq,slandeh,2,Thu Jul 9 18:55:11 2015 UTC,"The storylines are no where near how they are in SH. The interest some people have in RE is finding out how zombies came about, so it's more of your basic plot of a company doing evil things behind closed doors and you are learning what happened that made these doors open."
silenthill,3cpeoq,Glareth,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:55:37 2015 UTC,"It's not as ""surreal"" as SH, but it's still very much tense and unnerving in it's own way. The atmosphere is just as dense as SH and can even carry more of a claustrophobic feel due to it only being set in a mansion (albeit a rather complex and intricate one). RE remake was a very refreshing surprise for me and is certainly worth a try if you want to depart a bit from the themes of Silent Hill but still maintain the same depth of psychological horror."
silenthill,3cpeoq,Zaeh,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:09:29 2015 UTC,"They're not surreal at all, they're pretty much a polar opposite of Silent Hill in that. Every game is grounded at least in some way in believable science, and you can guarantee that everything you see is actually happening, instead of having to second guess yourself like in Silent Hill."
silenthill,3cpeoq,d1223,3,Fri Jul 10 00:02:59 2015 UTC,"I would say the first 3 games are as good as the first 3 silent Hills in terms of game play and setting, but the story is nowhere near as good or near as scary."

silenthill,3cpeoq,HaouLeo,2,Tue Jul 21 11:58:19 2015 UTC,"Resident Evil 4 is one of the best action games of all time. Unfortunately, it also ruined the series for me. Every game after (except for Revelations and Revelations 2) has been trying to cash-in on the action of RE4 and moving further away from the isolation and horror and perfect pacing.  Revelations 1 has so far been a pretty good game, if a bit too formulaic. The claustrophobia is on point, and the enemy designs are generally pretty neat.  REmake is hailed as one of the greatest survival horror titles of all time, and I made sure to get it on sale when it was roughly $12. I'm very much hyped to experience it."
silenthill,3cpeoq,Zaeh,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:14:45 2015 UTC,"Resident Evil and Silent Hill are both good, but have different approaches on horror.

The new action ones can be fun even though they are even less scary then the old ones.   I think revelation is my favourite, though 4 is probably the only other I'd say I like besides outbreak."
silenthill,3cpeoq,notteoscura,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:47:13 2015 UTC,"I played the Resident Evil HD remake with a friend a while ago. It was much more scary and atmospheric than I was expecting, especially since I don't find zombies or other archetypical horror monsters very scary, but it was very well-done. There's a great sense of mystery, the mansion is the quintessential survival horror experience, and because of the limited ammo and difficulty of dispatching of them, even the zombies frighten you. Not because they're disturbing like Silent Hill's monsters, but because they're a real threat. There are a few freaky mutated creatures for some of that body horror factor though...  Overall though, like others have said, it's difficult to really compare Silent Hill and Resident Evil in terms of which is better than the other. They offer different things. They do both belong to the survival horror genre so you'll notice many similarities between how they play, but overall I'd say Resident Evil is more involved gameplay-wise. I think Silent Hill games offer more story-wise, character-wise, and horror-wise, but Resident Evil is more complex and challenging in its action. It's significantly harder, definitely.   As a series, though, Resident Evil has diverged further from its roots than even Silent Hill has, having gotten increasingly action-oriented with intentionally little horror. Silent Hill has, to the newer games' credit, remained relatively subtle and rooted in psychological horror. It just wasn't nearly as well-done after the original team left, and the attempts at horror have missed their mark.  Like Silent Hill, Resident Evil has its ""original 3"" games that are well-regarded by its fandom, and a more controversial fourth game that made several changes that's nonetheless often still well-regarded, and then later games after that point which are very divisive as far as the fanbase goes, but generally considered inferior games. So it's interesting to see how the series relate to and differ from each other, given their roles as survival horror rivals. To put it simply, both are titans of survival horror for a reason, and both are worth experiencing for those reasons."

I really liked Resident Evil, I liked the similarity of being in a room you're totally not ready for and having to sprint for the door. Since the controls are clunky you find yourself running into walls (as if you're stumbling around in real life) and shouting ""OMFG just OPEN the MOTHERFUCKIN DOOOOOR!"" They're both exhiliratingly scary in that regard. Silent Hill is just waaay more atmospherically scary."

I feel like the action heavy tone of RE worked better during my adolescence. The more cerebral and slower paced nature of Silent Hill appeals more to me as an adult. RE has become more action heavy as it goes on, and Silent Hill has always been trying different stuff from the beginning, and it does get more hit or miss with what the fans want. Right now, you have two franchises that have a lot more fans wishing for a return to the old school formula, like a classic rock band that is touring their new album."

It's spoopy and scary and gross, but not to the degree of the twisted nightmares in Silent Hill.  And this is just for the first 3, from 4 and on it's an action packed shooting fest. I say 4 is arguably the best of them all, as it's a nice combination of horror, decent story, and action. But from 5 and on it's kind of mindless."

Exploring has some creepy moments and full of atmosphere, but the chase scenes were annoying and down right disappointing. I did not find them scary in the least.  I'd give it like a 4/10 because the main part of the game had some promise but the chase scenes ruined it."
silenthill,3cjzpx,Geruvah,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:57:13 2015 UTC,"I think the lack of monsters in the overworld really hampered the intensity of the game.  I think mingling them into the overworld, forcing you ti hide from them or get out of the area would have made the game a lot more tense. They could have added static on the screen and audio interference when they get close. I'm even good with having no weapons, I just want to have a reason to be scared in the exploration areas.  As it sits, the game is divided into three distict modes. Psychiatrist mode, exploration mode, and running mode. In two of the three modes you are totally safe, and have nothing to be scared of. In running mode, you're still not really scared because you know what's coming, and it's always the same non menacing ""monster.""  Which brings me to another point. The monsters are not scary or unsettling. Visually They're kind of ho hum. Nothing much to look at and feel scared of. They're easy to shake off, and predictably stupid. Even if they did catch me, I didn't feel scared. Oh noes, don't hang on my neck, you might make my muscles stiff. I'm more scared of my toddlers hanging on me, because they sometimes cause physical pain.  The saving grace for me was the story, and the back stories on a lot of the echos you find. A lot of those were pretty dark, and disturbing. The choking game comes to mind. There were tons of nods to the first 3 Silent Hill games as well that I enjoyed.  I place this right above Homecoming. Slightly better than the other western developed games, but still nowhere near 1-4."

silenthill,3cbx42,ThatBlueHatGuy,2,Tue Jul 7 04:35:04 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think Silent Hill is a very great game to watch. Not a ""Let's Play"" but in person, with a friend of family member, watching them play it. (I watched a lot of the games while others played originally). You get to focus purely on the visuals and atmosphere, and seeing another person run the character into the wall, and then get attacked by something that you are helpless to help and it makes for some very tense moments.   Having no direct control and watching the horror unfold makes for a great experience."
silenthill,3cbx42,Huknar,2,Tue Jul 7 09:28:22 2015 UTC,"If you absolutely can't take the horror elements of Silent Hill 1-4, then definitely watch someone play it. The other games aren't that scary, and I'm sure anyone could handle them (not including P.T.)  Other wise, put yourself in the pilot seat.  Interacting in a horror universe is much more intense to me than watching it and having no input."
silenthill,3cbx42,HayabusaZeroZ,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:05:06 2015 UTC,"Watching someone else playing puts you in the safe co-pilot seat, unless you are not using a seabelt, but it let you enjoy the game a bit more as you don't stress too much from driving/playing it.  Silent hill is full of tense and unpredictable moments.   I did only play from the beginning to the end the 1st and 3rd Silent hill.  Have not finished 2nd / 4th."

silenthill,3c7bst,btbcorno,6,Sun Jul 5 17:03:25 2015 UTC,The enemy you should be careful with is another person. You'll meet a few on your way through town. That shouldn't spoil anything
silenthill,3c7bst,Kookaburra00,3,Sun Jul 5 20:24:44 2015 UTC,"Why not just enjoy the game and make the best decision based on what you feel the character would do? Once you know where you are going you can always blow thru the game really quickly to get another ending.      Hint if you still want + ending : You need to save 2 characters Slightly Deeper Hint: You need an item to save 1 of them A bit further: You get an empty bottle in the hospital, you need to fill it"
silenthill,3c7bst,HamSol,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:05:06 2015 UTC,"What you're doing is fine but make sure to EXPLORE everywhere. There is also a certain enemy later on that will change the ending depending on if you picked up a certain, somewhat hidden item and use it against the enemy. Assuming you just follow your gamer instinct, you should end up with what most consider to be the canonical ending.  If you're also considering a SH2 playthrough and you haven't done one before, don't ask how to get what ending. Don't look up hints. Just ride it through."

Silent Hill 1 is not a masterpiece but it is a pioneer of a game, good in its own right, and historically important. Don't oversell."

silenthill,3c75th,gungfly,6,Sat Jul 11 09:03:46 2015 UTC,"Perhaps it was part of their master plan all along. They knew us fans would create and sign a petition. Just you wait. Once it reaches 204,863 signatures, something's gotta happen."
silenthill,3c75th,Rezurrect12,4,Sun Jul 5 20:17:15 2015 UTC,It is a Kojima project.
silenthill,3c75th,Metalcentraldialog,3,Sun Jul 5 20:46:10 2015 UTC,"One major point of the petition was to get the attention from Kojima, del Toro, and Reedus.   Reedus has done a lot to spread word of the petition. Del Toro voiced his support to keep it going and added his name to it. Kojima can't say much (as he is still under contract) but he did share a retweet to support P.T. and Silent Hills before it was taken down (I can find the screenshot if you ask for it).   I was disappointed but not surprised when E3 passed with no word on Silent Hills. We got the attention, all we can do now is wait."
silenthill,3c75th,tta2013,2,Sun Jul 5 16:58:40 2015 UTC,"The 200,000 target is arbitrary... since the petition opened, it's had its target shifted backwards every time it's met. When the petition reaches 200k, I surmise (great word btw) that the target will just shift back to 300k, and otherwise nothing will happen.  People were asking this about the 100k ""target"", and nothing has happened since then! It's over. It's a nice gesture to show people's disagreement with Konami's actions, but it won't effect any actual change, I reckon."

silenthill,3c75th,Metalcentraldialog,4,Sun Jul 5 15:29:23 2015 UTC,"Sadly some people can't. P.T. pretty much showcased what Del Toro and Kojima could do, and instead it was ripped away from the fans because Konami decided to do a 180 degree turn of that of Phil fucking Fish.   Thankfully Allison Road is a good spiritual successor. But hey, for fans wanting Silent Hills/PT, they're hopefully. What can ya do?"

silenthill,3c4av4,Blackmoxa,2,Sat Jul 4 17:47:09 2015 UTC,Don't worry about trying to kill any monsters out on the streets. Just run past all of them. Only kill monsters you find in tight spaces or in rooms you'll be visiting frequently as you clear an area.   Save health items until you really need them. Save rifle ammo for bosses. The shotgun is good for regular tough enemies but hard to find early.   Check every door you pass because you'll automatically fill out on your map if they can open or not. That helps ensure you have checked an entire area.   You can go inside some buildings that are not essential to the story and find supplies.

Hopefully, similar talent may adopt these ideas for future horror games.  I, for one, was really shocked when it got cancelled, it was such a nightmare, but people were telling me that it would be when the news of Kojima's MGSV credit was being taken off thanks to Konami. But now I am happy that we got to experience such a new heightened experience of interactive horror (especially if VR were one of Kojima's/Del Toro's approaches) and goes to show that rearranging formulas, and inventing new and unique scenarios just goes to show that there is still hope for innovation with the horror genre :)  Plus, if you have not already, you should really sign the petition going on a change.org. I'll link it here:  https://www.change.org/p/kojima-productions-continue-working-on-silent-hills  It'll only take a couple of seconds, and for newcomers to this thread, hopefully they will sign it too.

One thing that excites me is Konami's first statement about Silent Hills being cancelled;  ""Konami is committed to new Silent Hill titles, however the embryonic â€˜Silent Hillsâ€™ project developed with Guillermo del Toro and featuring the likeness of Norman Reedus will not be continued.  In terms of Kojima and Del Toro being involved, discussions on future Silent Hill projects are currently underway, and please stay tuned for further announcements.""

silenthill,3btew0,poppy-picklesticks,10,Thu Jul 2 00:16:37 2015 UTC,"I was actually in the middle of serious depression at the time, with lots of self doubt and just feeling plain awful about myself in general. I got my copy of Shattered Memories in the DEAD of winter, and actually got snowed in for most of my time with the game (I know, perfect conditions! ...from inside my toasty house with a hot tea and biscuits lol). Surprisingly,the psych profile actually made me feel... A lot better about myself. It helped me a lot. Didn't fix me or anything, but I didn't have a lot of friends at the time and was perpetually arguing with my parents, and having the game tell me I was a good person who was just trying to do the right things really helped. It sounds stupid, but it left an impact on me, and SM is one of my favorites in the series still."
silenthill,3btew0,Sissle,3,Thu Jul 2 06:33:01 2015 UTC,"I know the feeling.   I'm not going to bore you with the details, but life is not good for me at the moment.  Well it's never been good, but it's gotten to the point where my situation has gotten past the point where I can cope, and I have made the best of some truly awful situations.     My family can't stand me and routinely tell me I am worthless, stupid, lazy, ungrateful, selfish, unwanted on a regular basis, usually when I can't or won't drop everything for their latest unreasonable demand.  They criticise everything that comes out of my mouth, constantly telling me what I am saying is stupid or just plain wrong for the sake of it.   I can do stand up and have a bunch of complete strangers pissing themselves with laughter, but I come home and my family are all like ""Why would you say?  That's weird.  Ew.  Gross.  Weird"" or ""oh what a stupid thing to say?  Why would you say that?  What is wrong with you?""  Cue rolling eyes and shaking of heads.  I can't even wear some of my favourite accessories around the house because my mother has decided they are ugly and cheap and has forbidden me from wearing them.   I don't wear them around her because I am so sick of her turning a big deal out of them.   Most of my friends don't understand, and are beginning to fed up when I suddenly collapse and become tearful or paranoid or freak out over little things, and have had enough of hearing about my problems.  I'm trying to get therapy and move out, but my mother meddled with my therapy and made me miss my session and now I have to arrange it again which is very hard to do because of waiting lists.  Sometimes... I dunno.   Sometimes I need someone to tell me I'm a good person, and that I am not a lazy ungrateful piece of shit who needs to kill himself and deserves all the bad things that happen to him and they were all brought on by my own incompetence and moral failings as a person.  Sorrya bout the rant, it's just good to know that I am not alone.  Because my family and most of my friends (with very few, treasured exceptions) make me feel so alone and unwanted."
silenthill,3btew0,Sissle,3,Thu Jul 2 13:23:29 2015 UTC,"You're never alone :) just keep working towards tomorrow, friend. I live by a favorite quote of mine from the Batman movies. ""Bruce, why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves back up again."""
silenthill,3btew0,Sissle,2,Thu Jul 2 15:07:11 2015 UTC,"I know, just right now is an especially difficult time, in that I was able to move out.... but had to move back after one day (room was crawling with fleas and the people i was living with could not have given less of a fuck as no one else was being bitten), so I'm finding it more and more difficult then ever to keep myself sane and calm, as I almost escaped this nightmare and now I am plopped straight back where I started from, much poorer physically and emotionally for getting a glimpse of paradise and then having it snatched away again.      Nothing I can do.  I use a lot of catchphrases to keep myself together when I just want to fall apart and give up.  Escha pa lente (spelling it wrong), which is spanish for ""keep moving forward"" is one."
silenthill,3btew0,BiceRankyman,3,Thu Jul 2 15:10:54 2015 UTC,"I had almost the exact same thing happen haha. Moved out, discovered that the apartment was crawling with BED BUGS and that my roommates new and dgaf and I ended up getting so bitten up that I looked like Rocky Balboa at the END of one of those movies, had to move right back home. But hey, just another bump in the road, right? :)"
silenthill,3btew0,BiceRankyman,2,Thu Jul 2 15:28:56 2015 UTC,More like multiple large bumps on my back but I get you.
silenthill,3btew0,joethulhuz,0,Thu Jul 2 15:44:56 2015 UTC,"You could've bug bombed. You could have sprayed your stuff. You could have couch surfed. I was totally on board with your story and your issues till this post.   I'm sorry dude, but you need to spend some time in Silent Hill. Because you're blaming everything on everyone else. I get that people are shitty. I have a relative who shits on my dream career several times a week and I'm living on his couch. It's awful. But I put myself here. My roommates were expecting a baby and I mishandled the situation when I left. I was the one under prepared to keep living in the city if things went awry. No one else. You are responsible for every thing that has ever happened to you. Because you are the only one in your universe. And you are the one who chooses to react the way you have in every situation you've ever been in.  I hate to be captain tough love. I never am and I usually resent the guy who is, but you need to realize that the world is your oyster and you need to crack it open by any means necessary. Not get pissed that someone else has a hammer. So what, grab a rock and go Otter on that shit."
silenthill,3btew0,DishonoredSinceBirth,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:27:05 2015 UTC,"Actually.  I was all set to do all those things myself.  My friends assured me they would have taken care of it.  They didn't, which is what pissed me off.  I prefer to take care of my own problems.  What I cannot stand are peopel telling me ""yes we will take care of this problem for me"" doing jack shit ,and then getting angry with me when I say ""I would have handled this problem myself, why the fuck did you say you would do it for me?""  I have no interest in blaming people for my problems, and I refuse to let people hold my hands and take care of me.    Blame my problems on other people?  I pride myself on being able to make the best of bad decisions, taking responsibility   My world is not my oyster, and I have spent my entire life finding different hammers.    I don't think you know me or my situation well enough before you can scold me or tell me I bring my problems on myself, thank you.   In fact, it has taken YEARS for me to stop blaming myself for everything going wrong in my life, and accept that sometimes, people have been jerks and that other things are simply beyond my control.  I have spent my entire life blaming and being blamed for everything that has gone wrong with it.   I managed to claw myself out of a year of my life where I couldn't handle it anymore and was no longer resisting my constant intrusive suicidal thoughts anymore, despite having my family members telling me I deserve every bad thing that happened in my life and I should kill myself anyway.   I think considering I am doing my best to be a positive, optimistic and independant person who never gives up, and always tries to find another way even when the little things that make all the difference in my life are snatched away or I fuck them up, I still spend most of my time researching, keeping a brave face, focusing on my creative abilities and researching new ways I can escape my utterly miserable living situation, I am a very well adjusted person.    I do everything I can to find a new way out, and to keep a brave face on things, even when my family are making me feel absolutely worthless.   I   I give myself plenty of tough love all the time, and I am aware of my own flaws, and times when I played a bad hand even worse, and I take responsibility for things I personally feel are my fault, even when I was provoked to the point of no return."
silenthill,3btew0,thelonebamf,2,Fri Jul 3 12:54:15 2015 UTC,"""I'm not gonna bore you with the details"" definitely gave tons of details. Lucky for you they weren't boring. Tragic and awful, yes.  Life is full of people who will put you down or tear you up just because they're sick of you. Which is no fault of your own. The person you become is largely based on the people you surround yourself with. The fact that you live with people who aren't at all supportive tells me that you're doing well in spite of your environment. You should be proud of that.  You need to get out. Staying in might be easy financially but frankly, if you have to work your ass off to get the time to do stand up at nights and make ends meet, at least you're suffering on your terms instead of everyone else's."
silenthill,3btew0,icebear518,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:18:12 2015 UTC,"Ã·'I know.   I guess... I don't know.   I don't have a lot of people listening to me and a lot of my friends have gotten sick of the constant stream of misery that happens in my life and have made it clear they don't want to know anymore.    I really shouldn't be venting like this... but I guess Silent HIll is a game that really can be touching if you are someone who has any form of trauma or mental illness.    Sometimes I just need someone to tell me I don't deserve this shit and I am a good person.  Nothing more.   Apart from that, there is nothing in my life I cannot handle, as the way I have seen it, the longer I stay in this house with my family: I am choosing to be a victim.  I am not making them happy or more comforable, I am simply allowing myself to be the scapegoat or whipping boy.    And I've wasted enough of my life being the family scapegoat.   Hell staying with my family isnt even financially any good, as I have to pay rent.  But I've made a few revelations about myself because of the ugly situation that happened that week, and I think it's all for the best now: I have discovered a few more weaknesses about myself, and knowledge of those weaknesses will help me help myself so much better now that I have that knoweldge.  It would have been nice if it came easier, and not after a hellish weekend and losing and breaking precious things in the move, being bitten by fleas and wasting almost 100 dollars on cab fare, but moments of clarity are rarely born out of happiness and comfort.  I've been working hard my whole damn life, a little bit longer of this shit is nothing I cannot handle."
silenthill,3btew0,RaceCarGrin,3,Fri Jul 3 12:56:45 2015 UTC,"Mine was very accurate, and the few that I saw others get were also accurate. There's a level of subjectivity where some broad statements are made that just about anyone would agree with, but there's also nuance. It reminded me a lot of personality systems like the MBTI and Enneagram."
silenthill,3btew0,SuperMegaAwesome2,3,Thu Jul 2 05:21:08 2015 UTC,"My very first, genuine playthru nailed me to a T. Everything was accurate, to the point where I had my friends who were watching me finish it look away when it started getting personal. I found it to be the most interesting thing that had ever happened to me in a game.   Then I did another playthru doing the exact opposite of everything I did the first time, and as you would expect, the profile detailed the kind of people I really don't get along with.   Very very cool. Such an underrated game."
silenthill,3btew0,COCAINE___waffles,3,Thu Jul 2 14:17:54 2015 UTC,"Very inaccurate. While playing, we got lost in the part of the game just after the school, I think. We couldn't figure out how to get to the next area. We ended up going into one of the only available open buildings in the area, the totally optional brothel. We were convinced the exit had to be here, perhaps concealed by a puzzle etc. We spent ages there, examining every object, calling every phone number... nothing. Eventually we left and got back on track, but after all that our monsters went from blank to over the top ""sexy"" bodies, and the game figured we must be the world's biggest perverts."
silenthill,3btew0,HeyYouAndrew,2,Thu Jul 2 18:27:57 2015 UTC,mine kinda made me feel like a pos to be honest lol.
silenthill,3btew0,sakonyachen,2,Thu Jul 2 13:35:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly not that well, but still a fun and enjoyable experience seeing the results."
