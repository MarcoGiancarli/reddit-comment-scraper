Then I didn't get to get hom until 7 and when I finally did I opened my surgery book to go back to studying and spent the night wasting time- on what I can't even remember. Then I just skipped school today because I wanted to catch up on lost time and study again, but of course that failed and so the cycle of appearing lackadaisical and retarded continues!

ADHD,3e4axo,myhandisapencil,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:00:01 2015 UTC,"Basic rules for me:   As few distractions in my field of view as possible, especially things that move or are interesting.  Face away from hallways and windows. Keep all things that are in the same subject together, and have a specific place to keep them.  Binders are wonderful.  Boxes/Baskets if its something with a lot of pieces.  ""Every thing has a place, every place has a thing"" Avoid stacks. They just grow and grow. Then they fall over. On my computer, I turn off all sounds, all notifications.  Hide all toolbars and taskbars.  This way its just me and the thing I am working on.  If i'm not using its off. I usually shoot for a quiet working environment if I'm at home, but other times the background noise of a coffee shop can work too.  Its mostly about not having noises that will grab my attention. I prefer warm, non-flourescent lighting.  My office at work is pretty much dark, but I have a lamp and LED's mounted to the back of my computer monitors.  Its quiet and comfy."

I also find that I think more clearly when I can only hear my own thoughts.   As for a desk I think even though they can get cluttered, drawers provide a spot to put unnecessary materials so they are out of side and mind. My suggestion would be to have a table with enough room for a laptop and your books with nothing else but a light and a chair.  Put a drawer behind you for materials but make it short enough so that its below half of your height. Place a body mirror behind that so that you can see your work station while looking at your drawer. This way if you ever get distracted while looking for a pen or something all it'll take is to look up and into the mirror."

ADHD,3e37z5,designatedthrowaway6,7,Tue Jul 21 16:46:35 2015 UTC,"Hi, friend.   I can't speak specifically to your exact feelings. I don't know exactly what the right answer for your situation is, or what the circumstances are. Hell, I don't even know your name.   But I can sure as hell relate to you feeling cynical, depressed and resentful. I've been there, and it's horrible. You end up kind of ...almost numb, right? You don't feel sad. You just stop feeling, apart from the anger and the bitterness. Maybe a sense of desperation to break free from those feelings, too. There seems a lot of pain and desperation in your short post.   Look, have a quick read through this list: http://eponis.tumblr.com/post/113798088670/everything-is-awful-and-im-not-okay-questions-to . Perhaps one of those tips will help you get through today. I've had some black days in my past, and I wish I'd had a list like that back then.   Please try and reach out to a friend, a family member, a loved one. It doesn't have to be to open up and vent - just to hang out for a bit. Sometimes we need to give ourselves a timeout to recover from all the crap that's going on, so we can feel again.   And if you can... grab a voice or video recorder (your phone will do), head somewhere quiet, and leave yourself a memo. Hit record, and talk about how you're feeling inside for a while. Speaking it out can help you get your thoughts together - it certainly helps me - and in time, you can go back to look at how you feel today and see if a new day has brought a new perspective. Or, you can let go of how you felt that day by hitting delete.   Don't give up, though. Life can get hard, frustrating, and overwhelming. And on top of that, yeah, some people can be just... horrible. You know what though? In spite of that, in spite of everything else in your way, you got this far.   Oh, and hey - I hope I didn't completely misread you, and if I did, I'm sorry if I caused offence. But if not, if I was right about how you're feeling - it got better for me, and it will for you too."

ADHD,3e37z5,nyx1969,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:48:37 2015 UTC,"I am not sure if you need to put it into words or feel like you have to justify it.  I think ""owning"" your feelings is a great place to start.  That is how you are feeling, and I think you should let go of the idea that it's ""wrong.""  Instead, I think you should focus on how you WANT to feel, which I'll guess is happy instead of depressed.  In that case, you should focus on doing things other people have reported make them feel better.  Consider therapy, exercise, more sunlight, better sleep (take melatonin if necessary), writing down a list of what you're grateful for, and doing volunteer work.  Then of course there is also medication.  Those things are all documented to help make people less depressed.  I'm sorry you are feeling bad, I encourage you though to just focus on trying to feel better!  I was extremely depressed for a while in my early 20s, and you CAN dig your way back out of it, although it's hard.  I'm 45 now, and I've never been seriously depressed like that again, so there is hope!"
ADHD,3e37z5,GreenLizardHands,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:35:12 2015 UTC,"How old are you? I ask because I'm 27 now, but when I was younger I think I may have had a similar outlook, at least for a little while. I don't mean to say that it's ""just a phase"". It's not. It's a struggle. But I do mean to say that it's a struggle that you can win. (EDIT: Not one you can win forever, but you can get good enough at beating it that winning becomes easier and easier each time it comes back for a rematch.)  Anyway, I think the first hurdle is the one right here:   I know it's wrong to feel this way too.   Don't invalidate your own feelings. You feel however you feel. It's not a decision that you made, to feel this way. And feeling a certain way isn't something you should be made to feel guilty about.  The only things you should ever feel guilty about are your actions, the things you do. I may not feel like helping someone, but I can still decide to help them regardless of my feelings. And later, I feel good about doing the right thing.  As for the resentment towards most people, I think the best thing is to change perspective. People are really just the most advanced type of ape. We're hairless monkeys. And as you wouldn't expect hair loss to cause monkeys to suddenly divorce themselves from self-interest. So, most of the time, the monkeys will behave in the way that they believe suits their best interest. They'll screw over other monkeys to get ahead. Which is what you'd expect monkeys to do.  And remember, the monkeys we're talking about are people. And that's sort of depressing, if you think people should behave better than monkeys. But remember, people are monkeys with hair loss. Really, this is how you should expect people to behave.  But the thing is, that isn't always how the monkeys behave. Sometimes you have to look closely to see it, but the monkeys spend a lot of time helping each other out. Some of the monkeys travel to other continents, and help dig wells so that the other monkeys can drink. Some monkeys are good at taking apart other monkeys, fixing them, then putting them back together, and these monkeys travel around and help other monkeys in places where there aren't a lot of monkeys that know how to do this.  There is so much cooperation going on in the world. But that's not a story that gets clicks, or moves papers. So that's not the story that gets shoved in your face by the monkeys that like to tell the other monkeys what's going on. You have to look for it. But once you start looking for it, you'll start seeing it all over the place.   I don't know that I'd say that we cooperate more than we compete, but we cooperate a whole lot more than you'd expect based on just self-interest.  If you haven't seen it already, I'd recommend watching the first season of True Detective. It's eight hour-long episodes, and I think you might identify with the character Rust Cohle, though he may be a bit more extreme about things than you are. The very last scene of the season is the one that I think you really need to see, but I think for it to hit home you need to get to know the characters."

ADHD,3e37pd,N0Fear88,3,Tue Jul 21 16:44:41 2015 UTC,"Absolutely the same thing happens to me. I go from one list-making app or notebook to another, using each one for a few months until it gets cluttered and starts to be overwhelming instead of helpful. I exercise for a while but then something happens that kicks me out of my routine, even something as small as not enough sleep one night, or I just get bored. I've managed to keep exercising at least sometimes over the past year or so because my kids need socialization so I take them to the YMCA, and there are lots of different exercises to do there.  I'm afraid I don't have any suggestions, though...I've done it enough and watched my own mind enough while it happens that I can see it starting from a ways off, and sometimes I can counter it. But I can't describe it and it probably wouldn't help anyone else if I could."
ADHD,3e37pd,lynn,2,Tue Jul 21 17:18:11 2015 UTC,"change something at the point of interaction,    Example: if your wanting to go to the gym regularly   tell someone who already goes everyday that you'd like to go with them and most times they will remind you whenever they are going if you work in an office or with a phone all the time, set a re-occurring calendar event for the time you should be going every day, set one for when you need to clean or stock your gym back with clean cloths like once a week. Put you gym bag where you are tripping over it all the time, might piss you off but you wont forget to go, if you tuck it away where you don't see it you wont remember also, do the calendar reminder right now or you'll never do it.   Example: I eat too much junk food when my medication wears off   put all the junk food in the house somewhere that you cannot see and is not easy to get at, like the top shelf of a pantry.  your less likely to even think about it if you don't see it, and your less likely to climb up and get it if its a pain in the ass put a sign on the pantry door or something on the knob to remind you to do something more productive   honestly even with this I don't have a good system for using one app for managing to-do lists, every once in a while I just have to sit down and remove things that I want to do but I'm not going to get around to doing ever just to un-clutter it so I can accomplish ""something"".    best approach I find for short term things if if I haven't dealt with it I leave a window of it open on my desktop until I've addressed it and am waiting on someone else.  when i'm not sure what i should work on i just grab the top window and try to address it, I find its faster to just address the first thing I see and move onto the next than to try and figure out which is the top priority, trying to figure out exact priority I just waste too much time.  if it doesn't need done this week just close it and move on, and if it does need to be done this week what difference does the order really make, a week isn't long.

ADHD,3e37pd,peteq,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:14:17 2015 UTC,"Expectations, acceptance, experimentation and assuming obstacles are the keys here.  We ADDers get bored easily. Nature of the condition. So when we want to create a new habit or try a new productivity technique at work or at home many ADHD adults think we it will last forever.   And that rarely happens so we often follow the cycle I see in so many of my adult ADHD coaching clients.   They try a new habit or technique, get excited about it, goes for a while, then they get bored of it and start skipping it bit. They ignore those warning signs, then stop doing it.  Then beat themselves up on it with guilt or shame, ""I always"" ""I never""... then abandon it completely.  Their expectations are not lined up with reality. They expect when they start a new habit or technique it will last forever or years. False expectations generate false hope and frustration.  Better to accept reality that when you have ADHD and want to create a new habit or technique it will usually last a while until it gets boring.   That maybe a few days, weeks or months. If you're lucky? Maybe longer but do not expect that. Those expectations lead to misery and frustration.   But when it does you can view it the traditional ADHD pessimistic way or a realistic ADHD way. The realistic ADHD way is when I notice I'm starting to get bored with a new habit or technique?   That is a warning signal.  It shows me that it's time for me to use my ADHD superpower of curiosity.   Do I need to adapt or adjust the technique? Try that first. And if you've tried it a few times and it doesn't work than it means you need to scrap that technique and start from scratch.   Create a new technique that will provide novelty and dopamine and will be interesting. And realize and accept and plan that after x period of time you'll have to do it again.   Want to extend how long your new technique or habit lasts?  Listing some possible obstacles that might get in the way of you doing it. Then brainstorm some possible solutions for them.   Assume obstacles exist. Anything worthwhile usually has obstacles. Many ADDers don't even consider obstacles when trying out new habits or techniques.   Not from a I'm a perfectionist and I must list every possible obstacle and solution viewpoint. You'll never try anything new.   But think of the most common or likely ones knowing you and how you think and behave and create a few possible solutions  This puts you into a troubleshooting mindset vs rigid expectations of no problems occurring.   Want less stress and frustration and more happiness and productivity?    Accept reality vs fighting it or denying it Have proper expectations. Be willing to experiment. Assume obstacles and plan for them."

It is only usually after these have been tried that the 2nd line are tried, unless the patient or doctor is not wanting to try stimulants. If the second line are not effective the first line medications which were dismissed should be tried. If your doctor doesn't want to do this, you need to shop around."

ADHD,3e4mgn,j4nds4,2,Tue Jul 21 22:35:12 2015 UTC,"I was diagnosed with ADHD two years ago(I'm 29 now), and before I went, I was afraid much like you are now. The reason I bring this up is because I deal with the same exact issue(plus other things as well that I learned come from ADHD). I have the opposite weight problem, where I lose way too much weight. When I'm focused and determined, I can manage my eating habits well enough to be a pretty health 165lbs, but eventually go back down to as low as 120lbs.  Same goes for work and my social life. People always complain I never call, I forget a lot of things at work that I should know by now and I'm easily distracted, but then, like magic, I'm extremely productive and attentive for some time. Like you said, this goes through phases or cycles.  I'm on 50mg of Vyvanse now, and it definitely helps me be more reliable, though I still have times when I go back to being unproductive,  inattentive and forgetful.  I would say definitely go see someone, and see if medication helps you at all. Don't be afraid of the diagnosis, it's actually quite liberating after the initial shock. You are not alone in feeling this way my friend. I can't tell you if what you are going through is ADHD or not, so I think you should visit a psychiatrist or therapist and start to do some serious research.  I hope this helped and I wish you the best of luck in dealing with all of that, it's not easy."

ADHD,3e3qlq,soundwaaves,4,Tue Jul 21 18:52:17 2015 UTC,"10mg is generally a ""starter"" dosage.  Your doctor should be following the titration method of finding the correct dosage.  That is:   Start patient on 5 or 10mg. See how patient reacts to that dosage over a week or so. Increase dosage by a small amount, for Adderall that'll be 5mg. If patient has nasty side effects, lower dosage to last known working dosage and exit the process.  Else.. Goto step 2"

ADHD,3e2n57,LeeBarbs,3,Tue Jul 21 14:11:51 2015 UTC,"A psychiatrist is an MD and can prescribe medication, however in my experience, a psychologist can be more fulfilling. A psychiatrist will ask you about side effects and symptoms, and may give you general tips, but a psychologist is for the more emotional and personal side of ADHD. A psychologist will be better able to help you unpack your history and to create a plan to better manage your life, build good habits, etc. mine is especially good because she helps me separate my personality from the things I do that are more ADHD symptoms. I would suggest both until you get your bearings.   Edited to add: also a psychologist can be helpful in that he/she can help you identify issues that you might want to bring up with your psychiatrist. For example, for some reason it never occurred to me that the side effects of my old meds were something that could be addressed. My psychologist encouraged me to talk more to my psychiatrist about specific issues and now I'm on much better meds.   Edited again: sorry, I forgot to answer your actual question. An MD has to make the diagnosis. Psychologists are not MDs."

That's what psychiatrists and psychiatric nurse practitioners (under the supervision of a psychiatrist) do, and should be your first choice for a medication management provider, since they will be the most familiar with the typical medications used to treat psychological and psychiatric disorders. GPs and PCPs can also usually prescribe those medications, but should do so only with advice from a patient's psychiatrist. Most GPs and PCPs don't have enough domain knowledge or familiarity with stimulants, other ADHD meds, and psychiatric medicine to prescribe them on their own, so any advice they offer should be taken with a bowl of salt. I also absolutely wouldn't recommend going to a GP or PCP for diagnosis, though they can be very helpful for recommending good psychologists and psychiatrists (that is, if they aren't biased against ADHD; a lot of GPs and PCPs are)."

I prob just got lucky though as his two sons have ADHD so after four visits 2nd including the actual testing it was nice having someone who finally understood what is going on in my head.

I could say to myself ""Am I on my desktop? No? No youtube. Fire up Pandora instead and get some work done!""  It helped a lot. And it could be something as simple as if a certain desk lamp is on, if you have a certain color screen border up (made from paper and markers and held on by tape for a cheap version), etc.  Idk if you have the option, but maybe making a second boot for games and chilling would help too.

I'm in the early stages of understanding my ADHD, and you've reminded me of another oddity I used to have: I couldn't get work done without a ton of light on.   For as long as I can remember, my desks have had to have multiple lights - a desk lamp for my work, another shining on the wall behind it, perhaps a third to prevent shadows. On my current work desk, I've wired up (daylight-white color) LED lighting strips under the monitors and shelves to coat the whole desk and the area behind it in even, bright and consistent light coverage (to supplement the office's existing overhead fluorescent lighting). It made a genuine difference in my productivity, and when I switch them off, I quickly feel a hazy fatigue set in.   The funny thing is, all those lights, and my need for better illumination when working hard, come from long before I was diagnosed with ADHD.   Edit: LOOK AT THIS!! Cool White or Daylight-White lighting helps stimulate an ADHD mind; warm white doesn't. Explains why my blueish-white LEDs help me so much."

It was very undisruptive to the class since I sat in the back, plus I could tab over and make a quick note whenever I needed. And it wasn't so engrossing I couldn't literally just stop what I was doing and pay closer attention to the stuff on the board. It helped me retain far more than I would have otherwise just by keeping my brain active.  I wasn't medicated at the time, but I do think if I ever go back I'll do it again. I'm still debating if I really want to go that route, but I'd never go without my OneNote and jigsaws lol!  Edit to add: Any ideas for emulating the pile by the door thing without a literal pile? I'd start mine way early and end up annoying my folks, I'm sure, but I hate forgetting things and it happens pretty frequently."

Any ideas for emulating the pile by the door thing without a literal pile?    yes, a little cabinet or table by the door, dedicated to things you can't go out the door without.  Thrift stores often have nightstands for cheap.  I bet you can find one with enough space below to stow a small backpack or some books, and a little drawer big enough for keys, wallet, glasses, and you can put water bottles and last-minute things on top.  Extra points if you put a coat hook on the wall directly above it."
ADHD,3dyrvq,sd_local,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:39:20 2015 UTC,Well you could have some kind of small cabinet by the door. Throw a bowl on top for keys and add some decorations so its an eye-pleaser for people walking in the door. Reserve the place inside for your prep-pile. Its hidden away and its pretty common furniture to have near a door.   Or just pile up stuff in your own room if you don't share it.

I have automated reminders for the day before and morning of certain tasks, like street cleaning day and recycling day.  A struggle, but: Tidy up for 10 minutes when you enter the house (or a different room). If I come home and sit on my bed, it is game over.  When your mind is racing with the stuff to do the next day, write it down and just glance at it again the next morning.  Sleep Alarms - I actually have an alarm that says, ""Go the fuck to sleep!!""

ADHD,3dzlkj,Hexomin,4,Mon Jul 20 22:55:58 2015 UTC,"Tolerance certainly does build to some of the effects of medication, mainly to the side effects. Most people eventually reach a dose which is able to provide long term symptom control, without the need to constantly increase the dose.  However, subjectively, it may feel like a medication is no longer working, simply because the medicated state becomes the new normal. This is why it's often recommended to take occasional breaks from medication to assess whether or not medication is still needed."

There are plenty of effective treatments that are just as good, if not better, than medications. There just isn't enough funds to provide enough evidence that they work. The fact is, medication is more profitable than other forms of treatment, so that's the type of research the government is going to fund.   CBT can be just as effective as medications. Here's a study if you don't believe me. http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/12/30  ""Both groups showed robust improvement in both symptoms and functioning, but the use of medication did not significantly improve outcome over and above use of CBT and placebo.""  I'm not trying to start anything and I respect your opinion, but there seems to be a lot of misinformation going on. I want people to know that medication isn't the only option.

With the help of a professional, you can reduce symptoms of ADHD by unlearning the negative behaviors that cause these symptoms.    I think the point /u/Hexomin was trying to make is that for a lot of people with ADHD, the disorder itself makes applying the results of therapy more difficult, which ends up having weaker or slower results than hoped for, but if you add medication, then it can make the therapy much more effective. For some people, after that, weaning off the medication may be much more successful than if you had started without medication, but for others, achieving the results they would like may not be possible without medication.  I would like to point out that ADHD is decidedly not the result of negative learned behaviors, it is a chemical imbalance in the brain. That said, many of the negative effects of the disorder most certainly are the result of harmful learned behaviors, often picked up as coping mechanisms for the disorder or other effects of the disorder (apathy, for example, can arise in response to frequent failure at tasks that seem like they should be easy but are difficult in the context of ADHD).  Now, if you want to argue that the chemical imbalance may in some cases be caused or exacerbated by environmental factors such as diet, chemical exposure, or (lack of) exercise, there's at least significant attributes there that may be worth studying."

As a SpEd teacher, I just want to hug all the other Smart Kids who don't get the help they need because they can use their brains to compensate well enough.  Here's what I can tell you about myself. I was my neuropsych's 'project' patient when I was teenager. I took ALL the tests. All of them. Even ones not normally given to ADD patients. ADHD knocks my IQ down by 20-30 points. I spent my whole childhood being above average when I could have spent it being exceptionally above average.  Smart kids don't ""just appear to have ADHD"" because they are smart. Those kids have ADHD. They would just be even smarter if they were given the proper support.  Many parents of Smart Kids are in denial because their kids are smart and society tells them kids with ADHD aren't smart. It sounds like your parents are there.  If I were you, I would rephrase the conversation around reaching your potential. That's what I do with my students' parents when they are hesitant to pursue diagnosis. Yes, you are doing fine.

Anyway, if you are able to get them to do any research, (which, I know, is hard with stubborn parents) have them check out NIMH, Wikipedia, and WebMD. Like, that's the most rudimentary shit there is, but it's very validating.   Alternately, if you have a lot of patience or diplomacy skills, wear them down by stressing that it's 1: a developmental DISABILITY that's actually not that uncommon (nor is it a disease), 2: completely separate from being ""smart"" or not, and that 3: whether someone else is annoyed or not has nothing to do with the validity of their disorder. That method takes a long time.

People would call me stupid and lazy and that I just didn't want it enough, and eventually I started believing them.   Of course your parents think you're the smartest, greatest, most handsome guy in all the world, they're your parents. But it also matters how others perceive you and how you perceive yourself. It doesn't help you if they coddle you, you need to identify your weaknesses and work on them.

I'm not saying that you're wrong at all, but the prospect of them winning this argument might get them to take you for as assessment. And then the psychologist drops a knowledge bomb on them and maybe they disagree and take you to a different one, who will say the same thing, because there are three types of ADHD, inattentive type, hyperactive type and combined type. Not ""smart people type"" and ""annoying type"". (ADD hasn't been a DSM recognized disorder since the 90s, it was replaced with ADHD inattentive type)"

ADHD,3e2g4x,pikacakes,3,Tue Jul 21 13:10:10 2015 UTC,"Expect lots of euphoria the first couple of days, and some dry mouth. You might feel like a superhero and try to accomplish everything on your extended to do list in one day.  This feeljng will fade over the course of a week, that doesn't mean the meds are not working, it's that your brain has adjusted to moving around the extra dopamine it has to work with (someone please correct me if I'm wrong here)."

ADHD,3e2g4x,abanihd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:32:58 2015 UTC,"Its different for everyone. I had and still have a major loss of appatite. I had occasional nausea and dizziness, but I think that was more from not eating appropriately as it went away once I addressed my food problem. You might notice some bowl movement changes as well. Some people get constipated while others get a lot more frequent. Those should even out a bit once your body adjust.   Another less physical side effect for some poeple is grouchiness/extreme tiredness when the medicine wheres off. There is a natural down time in the afternoon that everyone has, medicated or not, so don't confuse it with this. This is a bit more heavy hitting. It can be addressed with a secondary dose to even the med down slope out a bit. This secondary does can sometimes make it difficult to sleep though or make existing sleep problems worse, so it should be considered carefully. During the initial euphoria period, this grouchiness may be more severe or noticeable. Once your body adjusts, the down period may go away or become negligible so be careful about making absolute judgments on the first day. But as always, talk to the doctors about any concerns.  Recognizing the euphoria and loss of euphoria that /u/dazed_n_confuzd mentioned is important. After it wheres off, you might think the medicine is doing nothing because all of your days aren't 10s anymore. Don't trick yourself, you're standards have just risen and you should try to keep a realistic image of what it was like before medication. That's not to say you shouldn't change your dose, the right medication and dose can be hard to find and is something strictly between you and your psych. Just don't get unrealistically high expectations for what medicine alone will do, its not a miracle drug."
ADHD,3e2g4x,abanihd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:32:25 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely noticing the lack of appetite. Usually by my lunch break I can't wait to tear into some food. But I don't feel hungry at all. It's more like...I could eat, but I don't really want to. If that makes sense.   The euphoria is gone, but I'm okay with that. I feel ""stable"". It was kinda hard to concentrate when I felt super euphoric because I wanted to talk to everyone in the office. But I did accomplish my work more quickly than normal and I felt glad to do it.   I don't see a psyc, just my general practitioner. Is that bad?"
ADHD,3e2g4x,abanihd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:46:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah thats how its affected my appetite while the meds are active. Don't really want to eat, it more just eating because I need to and will pass out/feel like shit if I skip. Its very important to keep a healthy diet. It has a lot of effects on ADHD in general and helps to keep the meds effective. If you let your diet go, you'll unhealthily lose weight, be constantly tired/annoyed, and no amount of meds will help.  And yeah the euphoria probably won't last all day, but it'll come back for a bit the next few days. As long as the desired effects of the medicine are there, then its all good.  As far as seeing a psych goes, I'm not sure. Where are you based? I'm in the U.S. and here this kind of medicine is handled by psychiatrist are trained in properly prescribing and recognizing the effects. General docs ususally don't specialize themselves in this area. So while technically qualified, they may not have the experience to back it up. This is usually important in the initial stage of prescribing this kind of medicine because it is important to find both the right medication and the right dose of medication. This process can be tricky and long depending on the person, especially because the medicine's effects can change as the body adjusts. Once the medication dose is stable and the doctor and patient are satisfied with the results, people often go to general practitioners to get the prescription filled as its cheaper and only consult with the psychiatrist at check up intervals or if something is wrong/needs change. If its common where you are at or your doctor is experienced in this area then I wouldn't worry about it, its just not the norm from what I've seen and heard."
ADHD,3e2g4x,abanihd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:23:59 2015 UTC,"My diet is kinda crappy. I've been trying to change it little by little. So I'll keep that on mind.   I'm in the U.S. also. I don't know if this makes a difference, but I've been seeing this general prac my whole life. I feel like as far as doctors go, he knows me pretty well. I've never been referred to a psychologist, only a counselor (who I have an appointment with next week). To tell the truth, I was kinda shocked at the ADD diagnosis because I felt I never showed ""traditional symptoms"", mostly because I always did very well in school. Sounds silly, right?  I always thought I had bipolar disorder."
ADHD,3e2g4x,dazed_n_confuzd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:31:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah some of the key things that help everyone with adhd are proper: diet, exercise, and sleep. I don't think I've seen any source refute that and the positive results are very consistent.  As far as the doctor goes, I don't have a lot to offer. Most people I see here go to a psychologist or psychiatrist for a diagnosis, either on their own or through a referral from a doctor or counselor. I don't think most counselors are qualified to give a diagnosis. Doctors usually seem to be more comfortable referring patients  to specialist for diagnosis for both their legal safety and the medical safety of the patient. I don't know much about the training that goes into being a psychiatrist or about what your doc knows so I cant help if you are worried about him being qualified. Other redditors may be more informed on the subject and you could ask your doctor himself. Some trends I have seen for treatment is to see a psychiatrist for working out meds, see a psychologist for therapy and general mental health concerns, and see a general doctor for general health concerns and to refill stable medications.  I can kinda relate to the diagnosis to. Teachers were always pointing out and being irritated with adhd symptomatic behavior. I did well enough grade wise though and was known as the smartest kid in the class. So no counselors were involved or concerns raised, just disappointment in my laziness/inconsistency.   There are just to many preconceived notions about adhd. Everyone already thinks they ""know"" what the symptoms are. They don't look up actual facts because they don't think they need to. The only times they get corrected is when it happens to affect them, either directly or through people they know. Even when corrected, people often resist the new information because they already ""know"" everything about it and can't be wrong. Bleh, ignorance can be really harmful, especially willful ignorance."

I work freelance and that is bad enough. I am amazing on the job, but struggle to keep on top of paperwork etc.  Interestingly, if you can fund someone with a bit of a beancounter mentality, and are willing to work with them and simple and thank them when they give you a kick up the arse, then it can work. You provide the ideas and energy, while they act to keep that energy focused on what works and makes money, even when it gets dull. Not many people from either side can work like that though."

My entrepreneurship is a little different because writing is a creative and lonely pursuit. So I convinced my neuropsych to switch me to liquid med, so I could experiment with my dosage. I found a good dosage that lets me do what needs to get done but still lets me take advantage of my inattentive over-focus to a degree. (Added bonus is I can still take what is needed for me to function in my day-job once school starts again.)  What keeps me going is the knowledge that I absolutely hate the trajectory my life was on before. As much as I love my students and teaching, it's eating me alive and turning me into a person I don't like.  I keep a to-do list. I have an action-plan for what my ideal day looks like, and what an acceptable day looks like. I've gamefied every aspect I possibly could so I could tap into the reward-feedback we seem to crave.  I also don't do weekends. Yes, I work a much lighter load on Saturday and Sunday, but I've found giving myself true time off lets me dive too far into the ""weee this is fun!"" part of life and makes it impossible to get back to work."
ADHD,3e2907,rabbita,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:49:40 2015 UTC,"I've experimented with writing before in the past and it is definitely a lonely pursuit, especially if you're writing a novel.  It helps to have someone that you can show your work to on a daily basis, which will not only give you immediate feedback on how well you're doing, but also make you feel like what you're doing is being appreciated by someone.    So, either a significant other, or a good friend who can check in on your work from day to day.  It sucks writing for weeks without having anyone else give you their opinion about your work.  And, most beginning writers aren't on the level yet where they can get a professional editor to help them, so you've gotta find a non-professional to give you feedback and positive reinforcement."

The best thing your family and friends can and should do is continue to support you, not judge you. If they get judgmental, who cares? It's your life, not theirs.

During those months I was very doubtful of whether it was actually ADHD because your self-image is never 100% accurate. Just know that you are not alone in this.  You speak of a lack of motivation, this also sounds very familiar to me. I never had ANY passions or motivation in my life until I was put on medication which helped a lot (I also used psychedelic drugs but I wouldn't recommend that).  I wish you the best of luck tomorrow and I'm curious to hear about the results! Even if it isn't ADHD, don't give up and don't be too hard on yourself.

Just in case that doesn't work, I have small ritalin ""boosters"" that I take occasionally.  Before you ask for changes in your prescription, however, there are two things to consider:    are you drinking any acidic drinks / soda / juices in the morning, before or after medication? In my experience, those tend to drastically decrease the effectiveness of concerta/methylphenidate meds.  Also, high carbohydrate consumption / being out of shape can be other causes of fatigue.

If you are unable to teach them because the parents insist on you teaching them together, and you have told them that this is a problem, then it is not your responsibility that they don't learn anything. Just babysit them.  You could also try to bribe them with sweets.   Or maybe have them do physical exercise. Let them run laps, do push ups or squats, burpees and jumping jacks.

I became more aware of it so over time I worked on it by forcing myself to try and think before speaking,making some structute in my head. While it helped it didnt change things drastically. Honestly the best improvement for me has been medication. It was one of the first things the meds improved. I've taken a break to see the difference and my speech and trail of thought went downhill pretty fast (Although its still improved drastically as my brain sort of adapted to that way of thinking...I think). When I first statted the meds a lot off people pointed out how well spoken I had become around that period and my performance in meetings jumped 10 folds."

ADHD,3dzmok,nevernevermind,4,Mon Jul 20 20:41:03 2015 UTC,"The good grades/events  = happy ; bad grades/events = sad logic is weak in my opinion. The reason why is because there are times where you put in everything into it and end up doing less than average. There are hard moments in life where it feels like everything you do is crumbling. In these times the above logic will result in depression and sadness. A better approach is to learn to be happy based on the effort you put into something, and the progress that follows. This concept helped me get through hard times when I fell short of my goals. In my head as long as I'm progressing and moving forward, it is ok to lose from time to time. Moreover I understood my logic of only being happy when good things happen was flawed.    I didn't write all that to diminish your accomplishment! Just to elaborate on the unpredictable nature of reality. I remember once I got like a 102 percent on a math final, I thought I had conquered the world. I wasn't medicated at the time and I thought I figured it all out. High moments sometimes can delude your sense of reality, like you have found the formula to always win. Well next quarter I ended up getting some poor scores barely making 70 percents on exams. I was so crushed and depressed, everything looked gloom.

He can be qualified for his current doctor position (Primary Care Provider) without having much or any knowledge about specific mental disorders.  He is a first line, so to speak, but for anything that is outside of his realm, he should be referring you to another type of doctor (e.g. psychiatrist) or even a specialist for that specific issue.  If possible, it would be best to try to start seeing a psychiatrist.  In short, he sounds woefully unaware of what ADHD really is.

ADHD,3dzkq7,Stumblecat,2,Tue Jul 21 01:01:21 2015 UTC,"There is a benefit for many people in not taking their stimulant medication every day,  since you may become desensitized to it if you don't take breaks. If it's possible to take them,  these breaks reduce the likelihood that the medicine will stop working for you completely at some point."
ADHD,3dzkq7,MyLifeInPictures,2,Tue Jul 21 03:36:05 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people, doctor's included, don't realize how much day-to-day life requires ""concentration"". Television is only entertaining if you are paying enough attention to follow the plot, and movies are even worse. Cooking dinner and doing dishes requires you to stay on task for extended periods of time, or food burns and dirty dishes remain on the counter. Driving, as /u/uftone1 mentioned, is an incredibly mentally strenuous activity that if you lose concentration can result in someone dying. These are all activities that you would expect someone to do on their day off.  I wouldn't say your PCP is intending to be insulting, or is a bad doctor. Rather, he isn't an expert in the disorder and may just not realize the full extent it affects different aspects of people's lives. Now, if you explained to him why you take it every day and how going without your medication affects so many small things, and he dismisses what you're saying, then you may want to consider whether he's qualified to be treating you.  I know personally, most weekend days (which is probably when your PCP assumes you would take a medication holiday) I might even need my meds more than my work days. At work, there's structure and management helping me know what I should be doing. At home, if I don't take my meds, I probably won't make it to the grocery store, or clean the house, or take out the trash, or make dinner. That said, yesterday I had nothing I wanted to accomplish and spent most of the day hanging out and playing video games, so I skipped my second dose of the day because I didn't really need it. The effects on my day were minor. That's an uncommon exception, though, and I probably should have taken care of things, but I needed a day to do nothing."

I don't know how other medication works, but with my Concerta it takes a few days of taking it every day to get the maximum effect. After a few days of not taking it, it's completely worn off. I sometimes skip a weekend if I have nothing planned, but I wouldn't take it only occasionally or I might as well not take it at all."
ADHD,3dy9kx,Tucker_MalcolmXII,9,Mon Jul 20 14:52:57 2015 UTC,"Try not to be too harsh on yourself. Coming off of medication requires your brain to adapt their DA transmitters, and recent long term studies show that regular medication use can make a adhd symptoms worse on off days (like weekends).  I've definitely noTiced this to be true for myself. I suspect the things I did behaviorally to compensate have been forgotten as well, and my adhd is comorbid with mdd so motivation and focus are awful.  I've heard behavioural therapy can be helpful long term, but haven't found a counselor for that. I do think the way we learn to hide/deal with our a adhd symptoms make it hard to figure out our actual problem areas versus strengths; most adults with a adhd have an idea on how to look busy, grab enough of a convo to be polite, but that's not the same as real focus.  My mom says when you're 30+ adhd comes off more as personal eccentricity rather than illness or stupidity; I want that to be true"

ADHD,3dy9kx,robot_fruitcake,4,Mon Jul 20 15:16:46 2015 UTC,"I think you may need to take some time to really think about why you care.  Is life a competition? Do you value people for whether they are the top in their classes? Are smarter people more happy or successful?  Studies show that above a minimum IQ level, happiness and success are not necessarily increased with IQ.  Who do you actually want to be?  What kind of person?  I think the most successful and happy people probably know themselves, in all their strengths and weaknesses, and accept the whole bundle with humility, humor, and compassion.  The same way they would react to other people.    Even without ADHD, there would be people better than you in your field.  Smarter.  More well connected.  So what?  We are all just living the life we have, the best we can. I tell my son that everybody's got something, some burden to bear, including the people who appear to have everything.  Life is not a competition.  Maybe it's a choose your own adventure? I dunno.  If the meds make your adventuring more successful, and allow you to do more of what you want in your life, why not take them?  What does it have to do with the adventure that somebody else is on?"

ADHD,3dy9kx,umansah,2,Mon Jul 20 18:56:43 2015 UTC,"A study from a few years back gave college kids Adderall and then tested them on a variety of things like information retention, creativity, facial recognition, etc., and the only things they concluded was that the kids thought they performed better when they took Adderall over a placebo.  The main benefit of stimulants to college kids is about quantity, not quality. It would allow a non-ADHD person to perform more work, but it wouldn't be any better. Now in some disciplines, more translates to better if you just need to memorize a ton of stuff. Whether or not that makes you ""smarter"" is a subjective judgment.   Meds to ADHD people are more about leveling the playing field than giving you an advantage. An ADHD person who takes Adderall every day will not be affected the way a college kid who takes it during finals is affected. I can actually sleep with an almost regular amount of stims in my system, and anything more than my normal dose just gives me a fast heart and anxiety.   Academic performance is a factor with ADHD but it isn't everything. Most people here struggle getting through a day without meds. Look into all the possible symptoms of ADHD and go from there, and keep in mind that your brain is like any other part of your body: the more you train, feed and care for it, the better it will perform."

I talked to  one of my teachers and he just laughs at me. regardless of if i have adhd it doesnt make those adhd traits in me go away. It doesnt change a thing adhd or not. I just dont get what the difficulty is in people accepting that theres an issue. regardless of how it's labelled I need to do something different with my life to be able to actually live my life. but some people can't accept that. its really strange because i get that view from people you would think are open minded. my teacher just tells me to not be hard on myself but he doesnt seem to understand that that is the adhd, that is what i hyper focus on.  with adhd it brings out the lameness of society... its like homophobes tell people to ""pray the gay away""."

More often than not it seems they're playing dress-ups and usually manage to convince everyone around them that it's real.  If we believe you don't have adhd and just need meds to keep up at a tough school, maybe you're approaching tasks wrong - or in a way that doesn't compliment the way you think.

Are you happy you were prescribed a stimulant, or not? At first I thought you were pissed off that your mom never got you properly treated for ADHD but at the end you are writing about firing your doctor for throwing pills at you.     Also, I would advise against blaming the doc or all ADHD meds if you're having side effect or don't feel as mentally sharp on Adderall.  It may not be the right dosage for you, or it may not be the right stimulant for you. There are LOTS of stimulants on the market. Adderall is just one particular type of stimulants.   As for wanting to thoroughly research the med, I get that you want to be informed but the truth is psychotropic meds are very complicated. We have a good idea how they work but we don't know everything about the drugs. However study after study shows it to be effective for ADHD. There are probably going to be side effects with no matter what you end up taking. It's just a matter of finding the medication and dosage that give you the most improvement with as little side effects as possible.   Lastly you sound like you have a lot of anxiety.

ADHD,3e0j34,uftone1,2,Tue Jul 21 01:27:06 2015 UTC,"Gotcha.   Actually, years and years of research clearly shows that stimulants are the the treatment of choice for ADHD, by a lot. There are non medication treatments, but study after study has shown that they behavioral interventions aren't as effective. (Before I make a lot of people here angry, let me be clear that stimulants plus behavioral therapy would be expected to work better than either one alone. But if you're a doctor  treating  a newly diagnosed patient, you need to start somewhere, so it makes sense to start with stimulants )  Also keep in mind that the medical system does NOT reimburse prescribers that much for doing counseling or therapy. The system sees doctors as very expensive and thus physicians are expected to generate the most revenue they can, which comes from short medication management sessions. That's not your doctor's fault. That's just the system.   Maybe your psychiatrist sucks, but I'm hoping to get the point across that every complaint you have can also be explained by things that are not necessarily in your doctor's control."

The meds rarely stop working altogether, but the difference between what you feel the first few times and what you feel after that is pretty significant.   The things you've been doing like exercising, eating well and meditating absolutely DO help. They just don't help enough for you to notice it because of your symptoms. The best treatment is a combination of good habits and the right dose of meds, and one without the other usually won't suffice."

Before I was medicated I used to have a beer or two a few nights a week when playing video games. I didn't know at the time, but a beer really had a calming effect and helped me focus.

ADHD,3e04tz,Chillaxant,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:53:41 2015 UTC,"Evekeo is basically Adderall. The only difference is that Adderall is  75% d-amphetamine and 25% l-amphetamine and Evekeo is 50-50 of each. Have you been on adderall before or is this your first experience with the amphetamine class of ADD meds? If you've been on Adderall before it will be similar.   Some tips for this med: make sure that you don't get in the habit of waiting for them to kick in before you start working, make sure that you are working before you take them and then they will keep you working. Just tell your ""I only have have to endure this math for a short time and then it'll become fun."" If you are off task when they do kick in, you will stay off task for a loooooong time. Also ONLY TAKE YOUR PRESCRIBED DOSE, if you get in the habit of self-medicating with them, or using them for fun, trust me from personal experience it will turn out bad, both for you and your grades. If you have an addictive personality and can't trust yourself to moderate, maybe have a friend give you your dose. Also work with your doctor and try various options to find the best drug/dosage possible. When do you need your meds most? Each dose will give you about 4 hours and take around 30 minutes-1 hour to kick in. Much shorter lasting and much less subtle come-up and comedown. They are pretty similar chemically but Evekeo will give you a more noticeable feeling of focus for around 4 hours, while Vyvanse feels much smoother and more subtle."

The honesty truth is I have illicitly tried stimulants before on occasion, So I am not completely unfamiliar with their effects, but this is my first time being on them every day. I do have an addictive personality so I am letting my mom dispense them. My doctor is pretty good about listening to my requests, I am considering trying something with methylphenidate next month if this doesn't work out and I was also wondering if I have issues with anxiety and sleeping already, should I ask him for something to help out with that?"
ADHD,3e04tz,HipposGoneWild,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:35:03 2015 UTC,"He probably won't give you two new meds at once, he will probably first want you to get used to one before introducing another. Once he sure that you aren't having severe side effects from the Evekeo he might try and help with sleep/anxiety. Take the meds as early as you can, if you take them past 1 it will be difficult to sleep and past 5 I guarantee you'll stay up all night."

I wish I could remember things on the fly, but I can't.   But we have to find alternatives that work for us.

If it's from someone I want to respond to later, I click back, instead of X, and it stays in my notifications. Same with missed calls, don't clear them until I take care of them.   Same with reminders. Set them often, snooze them for short times, always keeping them in front of you, driving it home of what you need to do.

ADHD,3dxnf2,limezilla,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:29:45 2015 UTC,"While it's true, i don't know if there's any proof about amphetamine being neurotoxic, i hope not.  Amphetamine is however neurotoxic at high doses (2mg/kg+)."
ADHD,3dxnf2,GodlyTrojan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:12:24 2015 UTC,"TLDR  0) Adderall and other amphetamine can be neurotoxic in specific circumstances, but scientists are very sure it is only specific circumstances, there is some slight disagreement on the exact specifics when neurotoxicity occurs but the scientists are in agreement that these circumstances cause brain damage, and these circumstances we have no good evidence that these drugs are dangerous in humans though we accept the possibility we may not see it even though we have 70 years of research on these molecules.  1) Telling what is happening with me and my first impressions of the article.  2) If you want more information watch the video I link in Part 2  3) Telling you my long term plans.           #0  Your body uses many substances that if they are not precisely controlled and kept in balance they can be toxic to the body in general, or neurotoxic to specific nerve cells or components of those nerve cells such as the mitochondria the little energy factories in almost all multi cell organisms (no mitochondria in a human cell and the cell dies).     Your Nerve cells has several types of ""cycles"" where it is moving various neurotransmitters  1) Inside the cell's neurotransmitter closets  (this is called the synaptic vesicles)  2) Inside the cell but not in the neurotransmitter closets  3) Outside the nerve cell between the spaces of the next nerve cells that the cell borders.  (This is called the synapses but you do not need to remember this)  Only step 2 is dangerous and has the potential for neurotoxicity.  And it needs a high enough concentration of that neurotransmitter and lots of other things need to be overwhelmed for your brain has many neuroprotective forces such as various enzymes and proteins to either deactivate the neurotransmitters in step 2, as well as other instruments that make the neurotransmitters non dangerous for these other molecules prevent oxidation, or they speed up the process of where the neurotransmitters are going to steps 1 or 3 and thus they do not have time to damage the nerve cell.  Now the nerve cell also has some limited abilities to repair itself, but it is so desired not to get that damaged.  Now the sequence of events that can cause the damage to the nerve cell is dose response, and also delivery method specific.  Certain ways of taking a medication can alter how it enters the brain and make it 10x time stronger in specific brain areas.          #1  Limezilla I saw your previous question from the post 2 days ago and I have not had time to give it the response it truly needs.  I looked over the quora post last night and this may be due to a previous headache I already have but I felt he left several key factors out and I felt last night and today instead of trying to make sense of his work.  I have also bookmarked his studies and I will look into them later (more on this at the very end) but I was not going to try to make sense of them while I have a big headache and there are stuff in my daily life that need to be taken care of and I can't really get distracted if that makes sense.  Instead of trying to figure out what parts he left out and if he made any mistakes, I rather just do something graphical and explain how the process works for unless you see the entire chain of events you will get misconceptions of how these drugs work and when they are safe and when they are not safe.  And this stuff is complicated with lots of chains of events, and lots of vocabulary so it can't be told in a physical story, it needs to be shown in a visual manner. Yes I understand the quora post did some of that, but he actually showed about 1/3rd of the steps.  In my mind if you are not explaining what TAAR1 is and the relationship of how the body keeps homeostasis between these various neurotransmitters and how it prevents toxicity and how this homeostasis can be overwhelmed you are not doing enough.  I also think you need to explain what SNAP25 is which does not deal with amphetamine directly but it is very important for ADHD for if you have a SNAP 25 mutation where you only have ""one good version"" of it you will probably not benefit from Methylphenidate such as Concerta, those drugs may make you hyper, but they will not provide the type of calm that Adderall will provide.  This stuff is not really difficult or hard to understand if done visually, and a person walks through the steps, each individual step makes a lot of sense if someone explains it.  But there are so many steps it needs to be done visually for no one's working memory, non ADHD or ADHD can internalize all the steps and thus you need a visual aid and then you need an instructor to tell you to focus on the general concepts and not worry about trying to remember the fancy terms.  If you want to memorize the fancy terms you do that on the 2nd, 3rd, or 8th walk through :)       &nbsp  #2  Dr. Nora Volkow is the Director of the National Insitute of Drug Abuse, she is the head governmental researcher in figuring out how the brain works and how drugs modify the brain and thus how to stop and treat addiction.  She is also one of the leading ADHD experts and an expert in dopamine in general.  And she is for the use of ADHD meds including specifically stimulants.  Here is a lecture she gave on the subject  Near the very end, but watch the first part for you are really curious, she explains that yes Amphetamine can be neurotoxic in certain circumstances.  Amphetamine is different than Methamphetamine (methamphetamine is stronger and worse and more neurotoxic than amphetamine).   No we are not sure from a 100% perspective if the doses of amphetamine such as Adderall we give ADHD people is a 100% safe, but all the evidence looks to being that the doses we give are safe to use and help these ADHD people but from decades of researching this in a controlled manner and the study of past drug addicts it looks to be safe.  Also there are subtle differences between man and mouse with the processing of the drugs, the differences in things like enzymes and the exact protein that makes the mouse vs of the gene vs the human version of the gene can make all of the difference in whether humans can tolerate it or not.  For these subtle differences can often be neuroprotective."
ADHD,3dxnf2,roland00,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:34:28 2015 UTC,"#3  This is a serious subject and I believe this reddit needs a good explanation of all this stuff involving medication. I am accumulating lots of good resources on this and plan on creating my own ""personal presentation on this.""  That said it is a side project and as much as I love doing it, I have to take care of my daily life stuff.  That said I have been making good progress including starting to organizing my resources due to things such as microsoft one note.  Some of the stuff I plan on doing.   How these ADHD medications work and what makes amphetamine different than methylphenidate vs strattera vs intuniv.  What is the difference between methamphetamine and amphetamine without those 3 extra atoms (some big differences).   Some comparisons of the various ADHD meds.  We can't tell you which med works in you but we can tell you on a population basis generally this med works in more people than another med.  Not necessary the effectiveness like this med is stronger, but this med treats more people. The history of meds such as amphetamine, how these meds can be used safely and how and when they are not safe.  This will include some information of the drug war. How these meds work on a chemical nature and the shape of the molecule can make big differences, how these artificial man made chemicals are actually similar to the various chemicals our bodies and how they are different. Some breaking bad references.  Even though the show deals with methamphetamine and not amphetamine there are a lot of good analogies and subtle themes on how ""the composition"" of events is just as important as the raw building blocks.   *For example how a medicine can treat nausea and stomach problems can be made out of the same atoms as its ""mirror version"" which does something completely different.  The mirror version has all the same potential but it can cause very nasty results for example thalidomide is referenced in Episode 2 and how the mirror version of this previously approved medicine causes severe birth defects including missing limbs and nervous and central nervous defects such as mental retardation and autism in some case. * Or how Walt is supposedly special for he found a secret way using some form of catalyst to improve the purity of his meth.  Meth is composed of two mirror images  dextro and levo.  The dextro one is the one which gets you high for it is 10x stronger at the samish weight at affecting the brain's reward center and other mesolimbic/nigrostriatal areas.  The levo version is much weaker but it causes changes in your blood vessels and thus it is used as a decongestant and cough suppressant medicine such as one formulation of a vicks vapor inhaler which is sold OTC.  Same raw potential, same elements, same core theoretical possibilities but the environment you subject these elements can  be the difference from a severely mind altering and life destroying substance or a treatment for the common cold.  Now normally when you make meth you get a 50/50% mixture of the dextro and levo molecules, and some additional impurities of the non target molecules.  You can do additional steps to get the desired molecule and what makes Walt special is he figured out a way to get only the desired molecule version, with only 2% of the undesired plus everything else that is not C10H15N molecule for impurities are part of the inherent process of chemistry.   But as you can see, this stuff is complicated and I do have serious plans on making good resources for this reddit and to help educate people and to point out when they should be concerned and when they should not be.  I wish doctors did this better, but medicine is so complicated that usually only the specialists know the insides and outs of their speciality.  But this stuff takes time and lots of organization, I do not know when I will have a presentable rough draft I am happy with and sourced to share, let alone a final copy.  But once I get something I will pm you and the mods.    See my entire point this stuff is complicated, it was too long to fit in one post."
ADHD,3dxnf2,roland00,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:34:48 2015 UTC,"One small question, how do you know if it's neurotoxic or not in a circumstance? Is there any symptoms like dementia?"
ADHD,3dxnf2,GodlyTrojan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:11:43 2015 UTC,"It is going to seem like I am not answering your question, but really I am., see the bolded part in the middle on the why this question is difficult.  Not really, yes there are symptoms of drug induced neurotoxicity but it is very hard to specifically identify it as drug induced neurotoxicity for the symptoms overlap with so many other conditions you can't really say its neurotoxicity by looking on the outside, only by doing stuff like medical imaging can you see the nerve cells are not what they used to be.  Kinda similar as a metaphor to many disorders disrupt attention, and thus you diagnose ADHD by eliminating all other possible likely sources.        And even in people who have definite neurotoxicity induced via drugs/medicines that overwhelmed your nerve cells natural balancers and thus killed or damaged nerve cells.  I am talking about people such as meth addicts, once you been clean for a few years you start to see a recovery.  As an analogy this is like smokers, once you been clean for a few years it is harder to tell with medical imaging that you used to be killing your body.  (See Nora's Volkow and other people's work who did longitudial studies, scanning the same people year after year when they were meth addicts, there are also similar studies of ADHD people on normal doses which followed them years later, some of these studies are 10+ years where they got the original person and followed them several times, no apparent damage at normal doses and actually a closer to normal with the ADHD on meds vs ADHD who have never been on meds.)        Why you can't diagnose it  But you can't really diagnose neurotoxicity caused by medicine for it has many symptoms it shares with other disorders such as anxiety disorders, depression, anything that causes your body to act ""sick"" for inflammation is the natural way your body slows down and starts the repair process for damaged tissue.  Now this is going to shake up your world for it is not black or white, and at first glast seems like it is impossible but if you think about it not as black or white but instead more of a cycle with multiple systems balancing each other it will make sense.  But your body releases immune factors to tell your white blood cells to kill bacteria, viruses, etc also different immune factors to tell your body to repair broken cells such as a broken leg, or a stressed out blood vessel.   A little of this stuff is actually good for the brain, it promotes repair and it puts the brain in a state to lay down new cells.   But the same signaling mechanisms, things such as too many cytokines (subtypes of cytokines are chemokines, interferons, interleukin, etc)    Well too much of these ""repair molecules"" can have the body actually kill healthy tissue through direct means (such as attacking it) or indirect means (such as causing the system to unbalance itself and it has oxidative stress which damages and too much kills the cell or glutamate toxicity which is similar but different).  Here is an analogy, effectively it is like having a militia, an organized militia is not a militia but an army.  You need to have a strong army to face off potential outside threats.  Too strong of army and the right inherent conditions providing a tipping point and now that army is a dictatorship and the country is under martial law.   Such dictatorship can be quite brutal and oppressive Other dictatorships are less than ideal not a benevolent dictatorship but not martial law, with them actually be less efficient at using resources than it would be under a balanced army/government situation, or even possible than just a basic militia that is halfway infected,  That said we are not under martial law (death's door)   But sometimes  might be advantageous to be conquered vs the other extremes of the army being out of control (the immune system being overexpressive.)   Some conquerors like keeping their ""colonies"" productive aka like a parasite or symbiote (many viruses started off as symbiotes but actually modified our base DNA and that DNA caused evolutionary advantages though sometimes it is disadvantageous and we eventually passed this DNA on to our kids if it affected cells such as cells that are eventually made into germ cells (cells that are precursor to cells that we use to reproduce) but other conquerors want to cut off your head and perform genocide or such a change of your culture it won't be yours anymore.   I have something called an autoimmune disorder my body thinks it is broken even when it is not.  In my specific case my body thinks my joints are evidence of broken bones, so it tries to bridge the gaps of the joints like you would do with a broken bone.  Besides causing pain and less mobility in the joints...  My autoimmune condition causes my body to always be dumping these immune related factors that tell your body to repair itself and go into martial law.  Other conditions are far more common with my autoimmune condition than the normal population but are not directly related to my autoimmune condition but indirectly.   Depression Anxiety Disorders Sensitivity to Pain of various forms (it modifies certain serotonin and norepinephrine receptors making you more sensitive to pain.)  Another thing that happens is the myelin sheath of nerves do not repair as it should so you get a lesser form of a MS type condition with chronic pain, but also a tiredness, half aware and half zombie state. Concentration Problems Memory Problems Chronic Fatigue Problems with the Gut (stomach and intestines like Crohn's disease and Ulcers), Skin, Eyes,    Aka things that look like ADHD but my ADHD existed prior to my autoimmune condition.  But these things if left untreated makes my ADHD worse.  Thus understand it is not about neurotoxic or non neurotoxic it is about the balance of many factors like things that can damage cells but are you also getting the right amount of things to repair cells and to prevent the damage in the first place.    Now in my case we can decrease the severity of my autoimmune condition by taking a drug that reduces the amount of the immune messenger that triggers my specific condition.  I am on something called a TNF-A blocker but there are dozens of similar types immune messengers for other types of immune problems, just like you have dopamine, norepinephrine and 50+ neuro chemicals."

ADHD,3dwqa8,lailalailoo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:32:48 2015 UTC,"Hafed and his team found that these tiny eye movements play a major role in ""highlighting"" sensory information in our periphery -- without us even being aware of them.  [The study shows] neuronal response gain enhancement for peripheral stimuli appearing immediately before microsaccades. This enhancement occurs both during simple fixation with behaviorally irrelevant peripheral stimuli and when the stimuli are relevant for the subsequent allocation of covert visual attention. Moreover, this enhancement occurs in both purely visual neurons and visual-motor neurons, and it is replaced by suppression for stimuli appearing immediately after microsaccades. Our results suggest that there may be an obligatory link between microsaccade occurrence and peripheral selective processing.    The new aspect is the direct link that microsaccades assist in selective processing, i.e. they reduce noise in the peripheral environment."

ADHD,3dy2eb,antyv2k,2,Mon Jul 20 13:56:30 2015 UTC,"I'm new here, so I don't know the official reddit approved answer.    From my own personal experience, I can say that I am 43 years old.  I knew that something was wrong my entire life but assumed that I had Asperger syndrome or an extreme case of Social Phobia combined with a whole bunch of other things.    It was something I struggled with all my life (I took a lot of classes drama to combat the social phobia, talked to random people on the street etc...) worked 12-16 hour days just to do the same work someone without issues could do in 6-8 hours.  And basically tried to hide as best I could that I was any different than anybody else.  About 8 years ago I got hit with a massive dose of depression.  Like I normally do I simply tried to fight it off.  Started my own business so that I could bury myself in work etc...  The problem was that this time it wasn't going away.    About 4 months ago, I went to a doctor, and demanded an anti-depressant.  She proscribed one, but then suggested I see a therapist to talk about my problems.  I was reluctant, I don't really like doctors, and seeing a therapist would mean admitting I was different.  So I said no.  But then two month later I changed my mind, figuring maybe a proffessional would know some different or better coping strategies than the ones that I was using.  My Doctor's office handled the referral.  I showed up and the psychologist, instead of demanding to hear about my life simply asked me a bunch of questions.  After an hour she said, ""It sounds like you have ADHD"" which was a shock to me since I have a couple of friends with ADHD and I was nothing like them.  My friend Charlotte for example is a bit of a social butterfly who bounces around from place to place and is awesome in all ways and is nothing at all like me who needs to struggle simply to interact.    So I did some more testing.  7 hours worth.  IQ testing, looking at videos and trying to spot an X, talking about my history and my childhood, etc...  I scored well.  96th percentile, and 93rd, but I scored a bunch of 0's on memory and attention aspects of the course.  Anyway last week I was finally diagnosed with ADHD predominantly inattentive presenting as severe.  From my experience it was a fairly easy process to go through.  Once the doctor said ""go see a therapist"" their office suggested two that they worked with.  Once the therapist said, ""it sounds like you have..."" the only difficulties was scheduling appointments.  My health insurance didn't help much.  They only paid for 3 hours of testing, and I had to pay for the other 4 out of pocket, but I'll be honest... finally knowing what was wrong with me was worth the money."
ADHD,3dy2eb,flakesobran,2,Mon Jul 20 14:31:19 2015 UTC,"I went to my university's counseling centre, the first counselor I saw said it sounds like I might have ADHD, so she sent me to the ADHD specialist, who suggested I have a full psycho-educational assessment done and referred me to a psychologist. It took me a long time to save up the money (Normally it would cost $2500 but the psych I saw brought it down to $1600 because I don't have insurance). I worked wonky hours so I could take the time off during the day to go to psychologist to be assessed and was diagnosed with ADHD and a learning disability of my working memory.   From there, I went to my university's accessibility centre to arrange accommodations like a private testing environment and a note taker during classes, etc. And my usual doc at the school health centre for a medication prescription. (She was great, she read through my paperwork and basically asked what I wanted to try.)

Hopefully it doesn't cost an arm and a leg but I think it's important to know from the get go.   Something isn't right if I have the following..  anxiety depression forgetfulness always tense paranoia  lack of focus can't follow direction even when I try my hardest overly organized (don't know if this has anything to do with adhd) moodswings   It's scary but.. I guess the first step is to see a therapist. Thanks all."

I can't say I did anything to stop, but I started doing other things instead. Now I don't have time for gaming.  Personally I learned how to code and build websites. Now I'm busy building lots of web stuff. Before I started getting paid for doing it I would just make stuff for fun or donate coding as volunteer work so that I got better. I never could stay concentrated when doing it for myself but if someone asked me to build something for them it became like a quest or something.  ...I still have a hard time finishing projects though."

So needless to say, sometimes when I'm not sure I don't take my meds and boy do I notice. I wouldn't say I'm ""sloth"" like so much as my brain is easily led to the clouds. I can't remember directions people tell me, and have a hard time ""putting things together"" for lack of a better way to put it. My rate of forgetting what I need to buy let's say, grocery shopping, skyrockets. It's defiantly noticeable how significant the problems are that comes with ADHD on those days you don't take the medication for it.   Meds don't make my problems entirely go away, no, just vastly improved.

I grieve over how much time I've lost to this disorder, the bewilderment at how life always seemed to just escape from my grasp despite my best efforts, the false starts at treatment, the decade-long depression I went through before I got proper help, the career I had to give up. I'm only just now picking up the pieces and getting my life back on track - but it's hard not to mourn what could have been. I feel like I was stuck in a mental prison for most of my life, and the day I was diagnosed and treated was the day I was released. But at least for the first time in my life I've been given the chance to apply myself, and I have the rest of my life to catch up.  I wish all the best in your journey."

ADHD,3dw4ij,Drois,2,Mon Jul 20 00:53:57 2015 UTC,"Consistent study is a great way to boost memory. Studying for fifteen minutes at a time, taking a break, and coming back to the subject is a great way to stay focused, but also keep inputting information. Check the FAQ and the Wiki for great study habits. I also suggest having a notebook and taking copious notes, and figuring out what your style of learning is. Just because you have ADHD (welcome to the posse) doesn't mean you learn the same way. I'm a visual learner, but my brother, also diagnosed, is an auditory learner. So figure out how you learn, and then adapt.  Most importantly, don't sweat the small stuff. Yeah, you're going to have bad days, and days when you maybe do poorly on a test or paper, and days when highschool is frustrating, and days when your brain doesn't work. It's okay. Be patient with yourself, and allow yourself to forgive your brain. You're different, not broken."

Perhaps you could approach this from a ""I have some concerns following the break-up"" point, and have your child brought to an appropriate psychologist (perhaps there's a school psychologist?), and quietly let that professional know that you suspect ADHD or perhaps just a lot of divorce-induced anxiety. That way, rather than coming across as pushing a specific agenda, you appear genuinely concerned for your kid's well-being (as I'm sure you are).   Besides, especially if you're paying for it, it does your ex no harm to give you a chance to be proven wrong!   (Edit: Also, maybe talk to kid's teachers?)"

Growing up, I exibited all the signs of ADHD. In fact, I barely passed high school and was expelled from college for poor grades the first time. I wasted over 10 potentially-productive years of my life because my parents did not recognize the signs early. I don't blame them as they grew up relatively poor and in a culture where you ""pulled yourself up by your bootstraps"".  Please let your ex know that it only gets harder to get a diagnosis as you get older. I fought to find a doctor that would prescribe medications as I got the feeling that they felt that, well, you've gone this far without it, why do you want it now? It was embarrassing and made me feel like a druggie seeking a score but all I wanted was help. Your ex will possibly be condemning you child to a tough future and make it difficult to get a diagnoses down the line.   What's the harm is just getting an evaluation done and deciding how to proceed from there? If she has any sense of reason, (s)he should agree to this."
ADHD,3du7ci,SmiTe1988,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:55:49 2015 UTC,Ex is somewhat unreasonable in this matter.  Ex does not see as ADHD behavior as what I see as ADHD behavior.

I have a small amount of hate towards my parents for not putting me on meds. Granted I should of went as soon as I turned 18. Technically it is a medical emergency. It for the wellbeing of the child and this is the child's future we are talking about. You may need to bring it up like that. I failed my way through school and wish I had more support from my parents.

I find myself wondering if she has it too. I mentioned it to her teachers for them to watch when she goes to kindergarten this fall.   That said, it's easy to see symptoms I children. They are extremely inattentive by their very nature. They have trouble focusing and daydream all of the time. It's normal but for people with adhd I think we notice it more in others. Unless you have other children, it's really hard to figure out what is normal child behavior and when to be concerned.   I say bring it up to your ex and then bring it up during parent teacher conferences. By then, your child will be known to them and they can give input on whether it should be investigated further. It is important you and your ex be on the same side of this fight. If s/he thinks it's nothing and they are the primary parent, there is a great chance thy will not follow up with certain things."

ADHD,3du7ci,zombiescooby,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:06:53 2015 UTC,"I didn't read where the ex was against it. If that's the case, bringing it up at a parent teacher meeting would be the best bet. That way, if the teacher is in agreement then further evaluation may be required by the school. If the school is behind a possible diagnosis then the primary parent would have to consider it more seriously. If the school sees nothing wrong then maybe op is wrong."
ADHD,3du7ci,roland00,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:29:51 2015 UTC,"I see your point. I've always found that the schools try to totally stay out of it. They're stand is neutral for fear they will be accused of ""diagnosing"" or pushing for a diagnosis of ADHD, and causing all kinds of grief and complaints from parents.The other thing is a teacher or other education officials would stay as far away as possible from getting between arguing parents, which could give the S.O. A feeling of empowerment to block any evaluation. I would just tread carefully here, as you don't want to cause the parent to dig in the heels and make it a saving face take a stand issue with all the emotion of the breakup and control over the child  to fuel it. At that point you've got no chance. I hope the OP finds a way to get an evaluation without so much trouble as I'm thinking !"
ADHD,3du7ci,roland00,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:13:29 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. I could see how they wouldn't want to take sides in this. I was hoping it would be either something they would mention is a concern or not to help calm op's worries.   The tough thing about diagnosing a child is that most of it is parent history. If one parent is not present, especially the primary parent, important things can be missed. Sneaking the child to be diagnosed could do more harm than good.   I do hope this works out for op though."

ADHD,3du7ci,braeica,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:53:13 2015 UTC,Thanks.  Advice so far on internet has been same as in real world.  Difficulty is the kid is smart so appears normal with ADHD thrown in.  I do not think teachers will spot it.  I will wait and see.
ADHD,3du7ci,fausto412,3,Sun Jul 19 21:51:57 2015 UTC,"For us to give you advice we need to understand why your SO is against you getting your child an evaluation.  Whats even more important is to understand your SO objections.  You are not oing to change your SO's mind, instead by understanding his objections you can give him new information that calms down his fears and shows him the need for you to get your child evaluated.  This is not about you, it is about your kid. Thus you need to de-escalate all emotional arrousal for emotion right now will only hurt you and bring your baggage up with your ex.  Instead you need to calm him/her down and then make it brutually obvious that the child will be better off by getting an evaluation by a medical expert either a doctor who can prescribe meds, or a non doctor who can not prescribe meds but can recommend non med treatment and strategies.  You then slowly use what progress you have to make your SO more informed about ADHD in general and then tackle the medicine issue at a later date.  Confronting the med issue too soon will bring all your SO emotional biases, we instead want your SO to gain new information that challenges his/her preconceptions and makes it obvious that you two together as a couple (even though you are now ex-es) take care the needs of your child.  So I ask again, what is your SO's objections?  If you do not know, let your SO talk, even rant, and just spend time listening and tell him/her you respect him and you will try to gather information to sate his concerns."
ADHD,3du7ci,zaq0920,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:56:12 2015 UTC,"Yes it is sad you have to do this little ""game"" with answering all his concerns before you move one step forward, but this same type of thing happens in all relationships with married people, non married, and with exes.  It is only with ex-es and divorce that you now have the baggage of seeing the other person as the other instead of as your ally.  When you see the other person as an ally, it is alot easier to cooperate and compromise and take small steps out of faith.  When they are the other, you have to do everything precisely and slowly for you do not cooperate with someone who does not have your back unless it is self obvious that cooperation serves your own interests.  So yeah divorce sucks, I know from personal experience due to my parents getting a divorce and them being quite stupid for the other person was the *other. instead of the co-parent."
ADHD,3du7ci,warmhoboooze,2,Mon Jul 20 03:57:33 2015 UTC,"Best option here is to talk to your pediatrician about your concerns.  If they recommend the child be evaluated, there are very few courts who will side with a parent trying to ignore the recommendation of a licensed medical provider."
ADHD,3du7ci,SmiTe1988,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:50:32 2015 UTC,Make an appointment without the kid present?  I cannot take kid to Dr for pre-evaluation without co-parent consent.  Non-emergency medical things have to have consent.
ADHD,3du7ci,SmiTe1988,2,Sun Jul 19 21:48:54 2015 UTC,"Do you need permission to take him the next time he has an annual appointment or comes down with an ear infection?  Because those are normally pediatrician things and you can bring it up with the pediatrician then.  If the pediatrician gives you a referral, you can tell the ex that the doctor thinks he needs evaluating and go from there.  Your ex's lawyer will be the first to tell them that they'd be an idiot to get in the way of it at that point."

I dont know where id be without being able to laugh and be in awe of all the bright shiny objects in life. Good luck buddy.

We have some seriously good discussions and it's really helped me come to terms with the shortcomings but also the advantages of ADHD. The insane focus we get in bursts but also the fact we don't focus for long periods of time means that overall in life we see a lot more of what's going on around us than others do and I think that's a huge gift. I like to think of it as my little superpower. Having ADHD doesn't mean that you're less than others, just means you have different strengths and weaknesses than others which is natural. My SENCO actually said because of these I'll actually make a really good doctor. You just have to learn to manage your shortcomings and maintain a long term goal!"

ADHD is an disadvantage, you would do better in life without ADHD.  I understand the majority of us have low self-esteem because of our failures in life when we know we're better than that, but please, don't spread misinformation.  To OP: ADD/ADHD isn't related with intelligence, in short it's related with control (discipline). You can have 200IQ but if you can't concentrate it simply doesn't matter.

That's not an especially common set of circumstances, whereas those where our symptoms hurt us to varying degrees are. I've heard the medical thing before, and there's some research backing up the creativity rumors. But even in those environments there's a lot of negative life impact too. I think we should at least let those people who experience it as (at times) a gift say so, so long as they're not demanding we do so too. Even if rarely and barely true, it can still be true."

Would you have the same mindset about a different medical condition, especially one that was more visible (e.g., missing limb), or had a clearer cure (e.g., hypothyroidism)?  How about if you had a child with ADD.  Would you be so harsh on your own child? Or would you empathize and do what you could to help?  Just some things to think about...."

The only reason I'm judging people with ADD is because I'm judging myself.   If someone without legs hated themselves for not having legs, I bet you that whenever they see someone else without legs they would look down on them.  I know it sounds ridiculous, and it is, that's why I'm trying to fix this about myself.  If anything I was hoping someone could recommend a book or video that would help change my viewpoint on ADD.    Interesting thought experiment you brought up though with having a kid with ADD.  I think that would totally change my viewpoint, because I couldn't imagine looking down on my own kid.  If anything I would probably be over emotional and my heart would just pour out to him or her.  Maybe if I tried to apply this love to my own self, into the child of me, then I would be able to overcome this issue.  I'm gonna work on that.  Thanks for your suggestion :)"

The only reason I'm judging people with ADD is because I'm judging myself.   I'm still getting over the shock of my diagnosis, and your comment really rung true for me. I feel like, having it as long as I have, I've left a trail of destruction, disappointment and missed opportunities in my wake.   The thing that's helped me most, by far, has been opening up to the ones who've always been there for me and love me most - my fiancee, and my grandparents. I sat down with my grandparents yesterday and explained my history, my current situation, the leadup to my diagnosis, and how the ADHD affects my daily life to them over the course of a couple of hours yesterday (I'd kept everything about my depression, my nervous breakdown years ago, etc, from them). It was really humbling, really empowering, and at the end of it, they told me they loved me for who I am, they're happy for me finding an answer to my problems, and they're so glad my fiancee has stuck with me through thick and thin.   Having someone who cares for me listen to the story, and at the end of it tell me that I don't need to be ashamed, should be looking to the future with hope, am loved for who I am, and have all the love and support in the world - it made a huge difference.   If you have anyone in your life like that, please make some time and open up to them over a cup of tea or coffee. It will help you a great deal, and it will help those who love you understand what you're going through and be there for you in any way they can. It certainly helped me."
ADHD,3duh3d,tacoexplorer,2,Mon Jul 20 00:08:58 2015 UTC,"My psych explained it best when she said that she views ADHD as a ""brain pattern"" rather than a ""brain disorder"". I actually really agree with her.  We have certain shortcomings that suck, which lead to advantages in other areas. For example, Tim Howard (U.S. soccer goalkeeper - named one of the best in the world) has been thankful for having ADHD because it surprisingly provides him with insane ""in the zone"" focus when he needs it most (like in short bursts). His coaches agree that he has almost unnaturally fast reaction speed, making him one of the very best.  It's his ADHD.  So a lot of the ADHD stigma is basically bullshit. You can be top-class at whatever it is that you want to do in life. It just takes a lot more effort and mental energy to get there than most people have to put in. We have to work harder, basically.  I'd recommend reading quality self-help on reframing your outlook on a lot of things. Read Stephen Covey, Eckhart Tolle, Tony Robbins if you have to (a little woo-woo at times but he's still great). You've got to build habits and reframe the mind."
ADHD,3duh3d,IGETSHIVERSWHENIP,0,Sun Jul 19 17:47:57 2015 UTC,"Your psych is an idiot then. ADHD is not a gift. His 'in the zone' focus is likely completely independent from his ADHD. His genes gave him traits that make him a good goal keeper, a person without ADHD with the same athletic traits as mr. howard would be the better goalkeeper. He has no evidence that his focusing while someone is about to shoot the ball is any better than a regular non-ADHD golie's normal focusing brain. Yet for some reason he attributes some of his reaction speed to ADHD? So I take it you think people with ADHD have some sort of higher than average reaction speed? There is nothing to suggest that. ADHD is not a gift, it's a debilitating mental disorder, if it were a gift for reaction speed ADHD people would be the best at any sport that offers an advantage to reaction time. So then, why is tim howard not the greatest goalie ever? Why are the other goalies that are as good as him able to be so good without the magical ADHD reaction powers? Wow it's almost like they can react just as quickly as tim howard..."

ADHD,3duh3d,IGETSHIVERSWHENIP,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:03:43 2015 UTC,"Because I hate having people tell other people what a great thing ADHD is when they have nothing to back it up but their feelings on the subject. It's like telling someone with horrible bi-polar what a great thing it is to have because some famous poet who had bi-polar wrote well, and attributed it to his ability maintain emotional agony for so many years.   Edit: And like Dr. Barkley said, it's going to be hard to get extended testing time in schools or other accommodations for the disability if everyone is running around acting like it's an advantage.   Edit: It's already hard enough dealing with the people that don't even think ADHD is real. Shit like that fucking goalie is only going to make things worse because now people are going to think you're an idiot savant who can switch his focus like a lazer beam onto whatever he/she wishes, which is so far from the truth it's ridiculous. Go ahead and consider the brain defect to be a good thing, hey since we know so much about soccer and ADHD maybe you should start suggesting to people with ADHD that they play soccer instead of studying. Seems like a great idea considering the spider-man reaction time abilities it gives people, maybe they just don't know how good they could be!!!"

It's because of how structured and orderly society is that adhd is so recognizable.   Humour is definitely important, learn to laugh at the stupid random things!  Understand that ADHD isn't a better or worse situation, just ""different"", accept the flaws as they are (and work on them) but learn to see and use the strengths (in yourself and others) as an advantage!  Find out the things that interest you and pursue them. I can learn things i'm interested in very easily compared to uninteresting topics where my brain shuts down and I literally fall asleep when trying to focus."

ADHD,3dui35,charmingpryde,2,Sun Jul 19 22:26:20 2015 UTC,"First, very few people are going to want sex all the time or every time their partner does.  Sometimes you won't ""sync up"" and that would be true regardless of her meds or ADHD.  That said, I routinely find it pretty hard to be ""in the moment"".  What tends to bring me back is creativity and communication.  Trying new things engages my attention.  They don't always have to be ""out there"" things- it could be that my partner's been mostly kissing my neck and switches to my stomach, for example.  Just avoid doing the same couple of things or copying the same patterns of sexual encounters over and over.  Switch up your actions frequently.  (Though very novel things are also generally appreciated.)  Talking about sex while having sex, or dirty talk etc., gives my brain something to clamp onto.  My mind wanders when it's only physical sensations- they sort of fade into the background if they stay the same for long enough, or are really intense (ex. near orgasm).  And this is true of all physical sensations for me, not just during sex.  Basically, my brain needs something to do during sex or it'll start to think about something else."
ADHD,3dvitd,GlassRockets,7,Sun Jul 19 21:45:58 2015 UTC,"First, coffee and exercise do not lead to dopamine downregulation and depression. Second, people do experience light depression when they stop taking, it called withdrawal. Luckily the amounts used clinically do not do permanent damage to the brain so the withdrawal is temporary. And last, dopamine is not the primary neurotransmitter responsible for depression, that's serotonin. You should be more worried about rebound ADHD symptoms than about depression with clinical doses of stimulants."

I suffer from ADD-IP, depression, anxiety, and Tourette's syndrome. My SO suffers from ADD-IP and OCD.

ADHD,3dv1ky,desigrlbkny,4,Sun Jul 19 19:19:50 2015 UTC,"My therapist has been no help with this. He just agrees with any opinion I provide.   See a psychiatrist. They're medical doctors specializing in the pharmaceutical treatment of psychological and psychiatric disorders, and will be loads more helpful on the medication front. Psychiatric nurse practitioners are also an alternative. They're advanced nurses, with the ability to prescribe medication, who are trained beyond the level of registered nurse (RN) and provide maintenance and support for acute and chronic conditions (PNPs specialize in psychiatric and psychological conditions, like psychiatrists).  As for feeling worn-out, you really should try taking your meds every day. As your body adapts, you should feel less worn-out and other negative side effects will diminish. If you don't take your meds regularly, you're just going to needlessly subject yourself to withdrawal (symptoms of which include extreme fatigue and lethargy, huge appetite, and anhedonia).  Also, try to find another job, and look at careers you wouldn't normally. Intellectual stimulation can be found in a lot of things you wouldn't expect. Maybe you'd like to try being a publishing editor, a writer, a critic, or something along those lines?"

ADHD,3dv1ky,perkalot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:45:07 2015 UTC,"I was on adderall and ended up switching to vyvance.   The adderall was more intense in every regard. It would really hit me, work great, and then I'd crash hard. Plus, the side effects like having no appetite were pretty extreme.   Vyvance is much smoother. I can't really feel it ""kick in"" like the adderall would but I don't crash either. The side effects are still there, but not nearly as significant. Maybe consider giving it a try.   In regards to the medication wearing you out, you really need to make sure that you are eating and drinking enough. When you're on these stimulants, you're able to work hard and stay on task. Your body needs more fuel just for that reason alone, IMO. If you're not eating as much as usual - if not a little more - when you're on your meds, you're gonna feel like shit. Imagine doing physically and mentally intensive tasks for a few days straight while eating less than usual. It makes sense to me that you need to consume more fuel, too."

The bots don't like it when I mention these by name, otherwise I'd just post the info here.  It sounds like perhaps Adderall is not the best medication for you. If you are daydreaming all day in spite of wanting to focus, Adderall just plain isn't working. There are lots of different medications out there, and one of them will probably work for you.

There are plenty of people with intellectually dry, creatively stifling jobs that they can't stand who have no currently diagnosed medical illness.    probably something spiritual and adventurous and exciting, with a lot of cool reading and critical thinking and talking   This is naive and overly general. It makes me cringe, man. Yes, were were all 18 once.   Find a real answer to ""what is my ideal job?"" That is your first goal. Then, create a real plan to acquire it. Finally, follow through with your plan. The first step is entirely on you, for the second step you should seek guidance from those who are doing what you want to do.

I was able to overcome this once I got back on medication for a few months.    Seeing how cut-throat this world is will make you stop putting others before yourself.

The most common medications prescribed for ADHD, which are various formulations of amphetamines or methylphenidate, have been used for decades and have been shown to be very well-tolerated and safe when taken at therapeutic doses. Side effects aren't usually a big deal, the most common being dry mouth, reduced/no appetite, and sleep issues (which tend to subside as you adjust to the medication). I wouldn't discount medication right off the bat if I were you, because they have the insanely high potential to dramatically improve your quality of life."
ADHD,3duwj3,nerdshark,6,Sun Jul 19 18:52:09 2015 UTC,This.  Even crazier is that medication wholly normalizes 80% of patients. That's eighty goddamn percent.  That is EASILY the best medical response of ANY mental issue.  Try the medicine.  If it doesn't do it for you look for alternatives.  in adhd med are the gold standard treatment.
ADHD,3duwj3,StopDataAbuse,4,Sun Jul 19 19:36:03 2015 UTC,"Yep. ADHD is the most treatable, most easily treated of all the recognized psychological and psychiatric disorders.

ADHD,3duwj3,SteveADHD,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:55:35 2015 UTC,"If we refer to Dr.Barkley's expertise a lot here it is because he is an expert on ADHD who has been researching the condition for decades.  I'd rather trust his judgement on the issue than some random guy on the internet like yourself; no offense meant since my opinion holds just about as much weight as yours does on this issue.  Anyways, Dr.Barkley talks about how behavioral modification is not very effective without first being on medications since most of us know what to do already, but we struggle to do it because our brains are working against us.  The lack of dopamine makes us seek out only highly rewarding behaviors like playing video games, sex, television shows or movies, etc."

You can try the medications, if they are prescribed and decide for yourself rather than the guessing. No one knows how you will react, only going down that road and seeing for yourself would tell.

Actually, this is very good practice. You always need to test your code. Even experienced developers can't avoid it. Stimulants will not make you a savant developer, but will help you focus. What you need to do is continue practicing, and you'll make fewer and fewer easy-to-avoid mistakes like syntax errors. However, the only way to reliably catch errors in your logic is through static analysis tools and rigorous testing, both manual and automated (such as unit testing, integration testing, etc.). Don't make the mistake of writing huge amounts of code before you compile and test, because testing large bodies of untested code is incredibly difficult and is a time sink.

Whatever you choose, if you're getting full on the other non protein starches, you may easily end up low on protein, putting you at risk of losing muscle."
ADHD,3dt3ut,Addbutter,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:14:29 2015 UTC,"I need to try and incorporate almond milk back into my diet. I just don't particularly care for milk and I can't get rid of it before it expires. I wish it came in smaller packages (the grocery stores I frequent don't have volumes smaller than 1/2 gallon). The whey protein I have makes my stomach hurt...is this because I don't drink milk regularly? Is it my particular protein (MRM)? This is my first experience with protein, so maybe I should get another kind (soy or something else)?  I try and stay away from starches (I think the crackers were the big source of starch in my snacks), but fruit usually makes me hungry, so I'm hoping that eating more servings will help stimulate my appetite. I also need to be careful about keeping up my fiber intake while increasing my protein intake."
ADHD,3dt3ut,nerdshark,2,Sun Jul 19 15:11:48 2015 UTC,"I don't do milk either . Mostly cause of the sugar content, which is the lactose part.Theres unsweetened almond or coconut milk(not coconut cream, but the one that comes in carton with similar consistency as the almond milk)    You could try a protein powder from a different source (egg whit, pea protein) than whey, not a fan of soy as it's gotten some bad reports lately(soy products in general unless fermented versions, not in large amounts)   Also check ingredients to see if there are un needed additives such as psyllium husk or flax meal ,which could be causing stomach issues due to too much fiber all at once.   Or you could try  reducing the amount of th powder added to 1/2 or less than before; see if you would adjust to it. You mentioned upping your fiber intake :fiber is supposed to make you feel full, (which may mean to some a feeling of being bloated) so if trying not to kill your appetite, there's that to consider. Or just eat more meat,fish, eggs  Afaik,  vitamin  B 12 is an appetite stimulant, as is exercise."
ADHD,3dt3ut,nerdshark,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:43:22 2015 UTC,"I will start with reducing the amount of protein I add and see if I can build myself up. Better than having to buy a new bottle and find that all protein does this. Not really a fan of soy either, so I'll probably stay away from that.  I never feel bloated from eating fruit...typically only feel bloated when I eat a ton of junk food (like cookie dough, cake, etc.), which I have a bad habit of doing if I go all day without eating and then feel the ""sugar low"" when the medicine wears off. I always try and incorporate meat into main meals, eggs are okay for me (but not my favorite), and I eat fish at least three times a week (good for your heart!).  I have been taking B12 for years...got into the habit of taking it because it improved my energy levels in college. Apparently, the body quits making it's own B12 after a while and you have to keep taking it for a long time. According to my doctor, it's also not good to take B12 on its own, but rather as a B complex. Something about B12 alone can cause imbalances in brain function for some people."

It's basically lightly-flavored water (with added thickeners like xanthan gum to make the texture more like dairy milk, in the case of commercial almond milk). It's not BAD for you, for sure, but it's pretty much no better than plain water.

ADHD,3drxcd,NowHerePresent,4,Sat Jul 18 21:41:42 2015 UTC,"Quoted from Stahl's Essential Psychopharmacology, pages 490-491:   Oral administration of clinically approved doses of the stimulant amphetamine, like methylphenidate, also blocks the transporters both for NE and DA (NET and DAT), but in a different manner (Figures 12-26, 12-27, 12-28, 12-30, 12-31). Unlike methylphenidate and antidepressants, amphetamine is a competitive inhibitor and pseudosubstrate for NET and DAT (Figure 12-28), binding at the same site that the monoamines bind to the transporter, thus inhibiting NE and DA reuptake (Figure 12-28). At the doses of amphetamine used for the treatment of ADHD, the clinical differences in the actions of amphetamine versus methylphenidate can be relatively small. However, at the high doses of amphetamine used by stimulant addicts, additional pharmacologic actions of amphetamine are triggered. Following competitive inhibition of DAT (Figure 12-28A) amphetamine is actually transported as a hitchhiker into the presynaptic DA terminal, an action not shared by methylphenidate or antidepressants (Figure 12-28A). Once there in sufficient quantities, such as occurs with doses taken for abuse, amphetamine is also a competitive inhibitor of the vesicular transporter (VMAT2) for both DA and NE (Figure 12-28B). Once amphetamine hitchhikes another ride into synaptic vesicles, it displaces DA there, causing a flood of DA release (Figure 12-28C). As DA accumulates in the cytoplasm of the presynaptic neuron, it causes the DAT to reverse directions, spilling intracellular DA into the synapse, and also opening presynaptic channels to further release DA in a flood into the synapse (Figure 12-28D). These pharmacologic actions of high-dose amphetamine are not linked to any therapeutic action in ADHD but to reinforcement, reward, euphoria, and continuing abuse. Actions of high-dose amphetamine, methamphetamine, and cocaine, given orally in immediate-release formulations or intranasally, intravenously, or smoked, are discussed further in Chapter 14 on drug abuse.  Amphetamine has a d-and an l-isomer (Figures 12-26, 12-27, 12-30). The d-isomer is more potent than the l-isomer for DAT binding, but d-and l-amphetamine isomers are more equally potent in their actions on NET binding. Thus, d-amphetamine preparations will have relatively more action on DAT than NET; mixed salts of both d-and l-amphetamine will have relatively more action on NET than d-amphetamine but overall still more action on DAT than NET (see Figure 12-30). These pharmacological mechanisms of action of the stimulants come into play particularly at lower therapeutic doses utilized for the treatment of ADHD. d-Amphetamine also comes in a formulation linked to the amino acid lysine (Figure 12-27) which is not absorbed until slowly cleaved into active d-amphetamine in the stomach, and slowly, rather than rapidly, absorbed.

ADHD,3drxcd,Pseudogenesis,2,Sun Jul 19 03:50:07 2015 UTC,"it is a really complicated mechanism and it is hard to explain it without knowledge of your basic understanding of Synapses etc... so i know this is not really an answer to your question but i think the best way to understand it is to do your own research on how dexedrine works.  this is a good place to start  http://www.bluebelly.org.au/howtheywork/articlebabb.html?aid=156.  also  http://study.com/academy/lesson/how-amphetamines-work-in-the-brain-body.html  this is very detailed  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine  sorry if this is not the sort of answer you were looking for but maybe someone else will figure out how to explain it well.  and in regards to    then why does XR last longer than IR?   When someone takes IR the drug goes into the stomach and is absorbed by the intestine just like food is however XR have a mechanism that releases the drug slowly over a period of time, this means that once in the intestine only some of the drug is released from the time release mechanism for absorption, but all of the drug is not instantly released so the XR continues to release the drug over the corse of time and therefore lasts longer as the drug is in your system for an extended period of time"

ADHD,3drxcd,Pseudogenesis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:08:37 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly amphetamines are both a dopamine reuptake inhibitor and antagonist.  This means that it both increases the amount of dopamine released and prevents it from being reabsorbed by your body, so it sticks around in your system longer and builds up to higher levels.  It keeps working for as long as it takes your body to metabolize it.  Don' think of it as producing dopamine, think of it as allowing your body to release dopamine at a greater rate, and also slowing down the rate at which it decreases."

ADHD,3drxcd,phacid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:02:58 2015 UTC,"The difference between XR and IR is how fast it dissolves in the stomach, they somehow made it so the XR dissolves slowly, giving you a bit of the medication over an extended period of time.

Before I was diagnosed I struggled with suicidal depression, had my plans ready and everything. But the Concerta has really helped with that actually.   I am depressed less frequently and when I do feel down, it's less intense, my mood improves faster than it did before when I do hit a snag. It's easier to say ""It's fine, everyone has bad days, tomorrow will probably be better."" In part also because it has lowered the invisible hurdles that made it impossible for me to get up and get something done, even something as simple as doing dishes or sending an e-mail. I feel better about myself because I get more done.   Some days are more productive than others, but I remind myself of how things used to be and that since I was diagnosed and started medication I got my BA, my house is cleaner, I think my relationships are better.

A lot of people with adhd are depressed mostly because we're forced to try and conform to society, but we don't fit into normal society so we become depressed. It wasn't until after I started medication did all of this become clear. I say take the meds and see how you do. As a side effect it's almost impossible to be depressed while on them so either way you should feel better in that aspect."

ADHD,3ds7mk,theuntamedshrew,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:30:35 2015 UTC,"Read in the morning. Your brain may be clearer because it isn't as full of distracting thoughts. Meditate before you read. Edit your texts. Underline important passages. Sum up paragraphs briefly on top of the page. Give parts your own headlines if they don't have any. Write down topics as key words on the margin.  Pay close attention to the first and last sentence of the paragraph. Often the first sentence introduces a new thought and the last one is the conclusion. Summarize your readings in a word file. If you keep drifting off because the writing is bad, get a better book. Academic texts are full of bad prose containing too many abstract nouns, too many nominalizations, passive constructions, and lots of clutter.  If you have to read a text that is ADHD unfriendly because of its  cluttered academic prose, simplify it. Cross out unnecessary words and replace opaque words with simple ones. Make long sentences short and comprehensible."

It's not entertaining, but it'll keep you focused and provide you with good study material later. Try to summarize each section (bullet points, not sentences), and come up with 1-2 questions about the section to ask your prof.  (Profs WILL usually cut you more slack if they see you are engaged with the class and putting in the work.  This CAN save your ass later.)  Also, try to avoid marathoning your reading- set aside 20-minute sessions throughout the day to work on your reading.  If you are a social sort, joining a study group could also help."
ADHD,3dsn3d,thatsnotgneiss,3,Sun Jul 19 01:52:07 2015 UTC,I am a registered nurse. Can furnish proof if mod needs it.  Mobic is a strong NSAID and will cause bleeding. I have not heard of vyvanse causing excess bleeding BUT any amphetamine can increase your blood pressure for a short time and may lead to higher loss of blood in a minor injury but does not alter the clotting process.  I do know certain SSRIs can have a negative synergistic effects with NSAIDS.   I suggest taking your mobic and vyvanse separately if you are worried.

So if you've been taking anything like that, it could potentially explain it.  Still, I would err on the side of caution and make an appointment with your doctor and ask them. They'll be able to make sure it isn't anything serious, or possibly offer advice on how to help with the excessive bleeding.  (On a side-note, I've noticed that I've bruised extremely easily as of late, even though I haven't taken anti-inflammatories. I dunno if vyvanse is causing it, but if it is..

This can be horribly unlogic and inefficient and I will probably go all over the place. But everything needs to be unpacked anyways so that doesn't matter much.     Bonus third way: if I were to think about this logically it would probably be smartest to start with most essential stuff, like clothing, kitchen, bathroom stuff.

ADHD,3dr3t0,pogtheawesome,3,Sat Jul 18 17:23:23 2015 UTC,"1. Audobooks Hear me out. At first I thought audiobooks were boring, because I can read faster than they talk and you can't skim through the boring parts. BUT then I found out that with digital audiobooks, you can pick up the tempo of the playback. It only sounds weird or distorted if you make it go too fast. I can download them for free from my library with an app called Overdrive. Overdrive has contracts with a lot of public libraries and universities.    Picking up the tempo so I can tolerate audiobooks has really been life changing. I especially like that I can do other stuff while I'm listening. I have a subscription for Audible that I use to download books that aren't available from the library. I'm probably never going to read a book with my eyes again.   2. Don't re-read/re-listen to parts that you zoned out for. I don't care if you have no idea what happened at the beginning of Wuthering Heights. You'll just keep zoning out and probably never internalize it anyway. Plus you might just give up. Keep plugging along. The beginning of most books is really boring, but usually they get at least a little bit better if you keep going.  3. Skim or skip the really boring parts. This is one my mom taught me when I was in school and I do it when reading for pleasure sometimes too. I try to at least read the first sentence of each paragraph to see if it seems interesting. With audiobooks, I skim by setting the tempo even faster. I try to pick up on whatever I can without worrying too much about what I'm missing. I'll sow it down again every once in a while to see if it's getting good.  4. Wuthering Heights gets better, so hang in there! I remember that it started slow, but at some point I became intrigued and wanted to know what was going to happen. It's easy to get lost in the flowery language, but if you keep going, you'll realize that you can understand the big picture without understanding every single sentence."

ADHD,3dr3t0,Woobywoobywoo,2,Sat Jul 18 22:30:44 2015 UTC,"It helps me not zone out if I make the tempo faster. The regular speed is always unbearably slow.   Also listening to the book doesn't seem like such a boring waste of time if I feel busy doing something else. While I'm listening to an audiobook I'm usually driving, cleaning, walking the dog, working out, going through my mail, paying bills, playing a dumb game on my phone that I'd feel guilty about otherwise, knitting or some other craft/project. You can't do that stuff and read words with your eyes at the same time.   Is this summer reading for high school? Is there a test or paper due after you read the book? If it's a paper, idk if it would help if you kind of started the paper with what you know first before you finish trying to read it, so you kind of have an idea of what to pay attention to while you're reading."

Does everyone go by Mr. Healthcliff and Mrs. So-and-so and not many first names? I think I remember that it was hard to keep track of who were the married couples vs siblings. Or it was because everyone's name began with the same first letter or something.   I like when books have a family tree or some kind of diagram of who the characters are. I'm sure there's one on Google. If you zone out and you're trying to pick up where you left off, it's hard to jump in in the middle of something when you don't even know who is who. Instead of rereading the whole thing from the beginning to figure it out (bc you're prob going to zone out again anyway) maybe it would help to have a character chart open.  Idk I feel your pain. Remind yourself that if you can read enough to get into it, it's pretty sordid and different from other books in that time period. Pretty much all of the characters are selfish, bad people, so that makes it pretty interesting, maybe not good exactly."

There may be some subtle changes in my tolerance, but nothing that is too difficult.  I have a system which has served me well for my entire life (since I was 11).  My alarm goes off 2 hours before I plan to wake up.  I wake up for 30 seconds, take the adderall and go back to sleep.    Two hours later I am awake and I jump out of bed ready to take on the world.   I'm up at 6am most days and I'm pretty much falling asleep by 10:30.  You could adjust your 'time zone' accordingly.  Taking the adderall early probably robs me of a 11 or 12 oclock bedtime if I wanted it.  But nothing is better than never having to fight waking up.  I don't even set an alarm for when I need to actually get up, my body is always awake 2 hours later - almost to the minute.   Downside, I crash early compared to friends / loved ones.  I tend to hit the sack early because its worn off and I'm usually really sleepy.  But it generally means I get the same amount of sleep every night.  Not the worst thing in the world.

On the meds I had trouble doing things that WEREN'T directly productive. He would play, and I would clean or whatever. Now I can actually play with him and enjoy it.  In terms of medical effects, I haven't noticed any. Once I'm off the meds for a week or so, after that initial withdrawal, everything pretty much evens out.

Also:   Interactions between your selected drugs and food  bupropion ↔ food  Applies to: Wellbutrin (bupropion)  Using buPROPion with alcohol may increase the risk of uncommon side effects such as seizures, hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, mood and behavioral changes, depression, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and panic attacks. On the other hand, sudden withdrawal from alcohol following regular or chronic use can also increase your risk of seizures during treatment with buPROPion. If you are prone to frequent or excessive alcohol use, talk to your doctor before starting buPROPion. In general, you should avoid or limit the use of alcohol while being treated with buPROPion. Also avoid activities requiring mental alertness such as driving or operating hazardous machinery until you know how the medication affects you. It is important to tell your doctor about all other medications you use, including vitamins and herbs. Do not stop using any medications without first talking to your doctor.   Also, this is from the brief info sheet my pharmacy (Canadian, not American) gives me for each new med:   Consuming alcohol may intensify the effect of this product.

I’m struggling to come to terms with this diagnosis, and struggling to figure out what to do with my life if this contract goes belly up. I’m questioning everything and wondering who the hell I am? I’m struggling not to internalize this diagnosis - I feel defective and lost.  I don’t know who I am anymore or where I’m going.    I think I speak for everybody on this sub who was diagnosed as an adult when I say, we have been there. One thing that has helped me to not only accept but embrace my diagnosis, is recognizing that my ADHD is at least partially responsible for some of my greatest professional strengths like my ability to see connections and brainstorm. I excel at finding the simplest, easiest solutions to complicated problems and, so long as I keep myself entertained, no one can match my drive and passion.  Seeing my diagnosis as a gift as much as it is an affliction has let me embrace it and revel in all of who I am."
ADHD,3dqufb,ZapFinch42,2,Sat Jul 18 19:55:49 2015 UTC,"Stay the course!   They want content work? What else? Ask them precisely what they need to see, in detail. Examples.   Don't be hurt by what they tell you. This job will not define you. You will define you. Everything that you have told me, tells me that you are superwoman. You've done amazing things, compensating for an untreated condition. You will blow them away now that you have the support of treatment!  When you have a clear understanding of what they want, tell them that you intend to give it to them and you want them to notice. From there, I don't need to advise you, because you will do it.   I'm saying this because, I've been there. I know my boss has been happy with my work other than the way ADHD impairs me. So I recently I tried Ritalin for the first time in my life at the age of 42. AMAZING. So, the crazy part of the story is that I am a therapist and I have been in denial about my ADHD my whole life. I diagnose others and I ignored my own.  Well, when I realized that meds were dramatically helping, I went to my boss and I told her. (I'm not recommending that, I'm in mental health, my situation is unique, there is a level of understanding that you won't find elsewhere). I told her about my recent discovery that meds help and I am so excited to get caught up on paperwork, get organized, plan, be focused, be on time for work and all that jazz. I knew she would be cautious, and she was.   Then bam--I started showing people. I am alert, motivated, curious, productive, articulate. I have a sense of humor, I'm compassionate, I'm happy. I'm saying, no, I won't be defined by ADHD, I will be the awesome person that I know I am! (this is not the voice of pre-treatment).   It's only been 3 weeks since I told my boss. Tuesday, she asked me how things were going. I gave her a glowing report about my functioning and excitement. 1 and 1/2 years ago I was actually crying to my boss, because I thought I would lose my job. This week she told me that she has been getting so many comments from people about how well I'm doing at my job. YESTERDAY I got my paycheck. For the first time in my life, I have a raise that I didn't ask for. $4000 a year. (that's a lot to me). I am soooooo excited to show EVERYONE the person who has been trapped in a hide-a-bed couch struggling to get out of the grips of ADHD (in my case, inattentive).   So, I'm saying. F the label. Overcome it. There are books about the gifts of this disorder (if you want to internalize it). It can be an advantage--like creativity. And being motivated by what you are interested in.  You get to tell the world who you are! You get to decide! You ARE NOT defective. And it's OK if you don't know where you are going. You are bigger than them!   We don't get medals for the internal marathons we win. We don't get a kiss on our emotional knee, when we get bruised. We don't get in the record books when we reach the summit of the Mount Everest, after we've fought like hell to overcome and get on top of our mental health. We don't get validation for all we've truly accomplished! We don't even have a special olympics.   This is why YOU must be the one to validate yourself! Make a habit out of it."

It's totally expected to feel this way after a diagnosis - people say it's just the way you are, or it's a disability, or it's fake, or it's really bad. The one thing that is true is that this is how you've always been, and always will be.  The best thing I've learned so far to help me cope is that it is not a knowledge disorder [see 6:11 to end]. You are intelligent, you have skills, and you acquire knowledge as well as everyone. It's the action, it's the USING what you know where there is a disconnect. There's also a lot of other symptoms and science behind them, of course, but this was the one I was most concerned with.   It doesn't change who you are and how unique you are regardless of the diagnosis. You just now understand why it's hard to get going on things, and why you get distracted, and now you have an opportunity to try options to improve those areas.   I know it's probably overwhelming right now alongside your contract worries. I hope that works out in your favor, even if it means getting an even better job somewhere else :) Good luck!"

That counselor said it sounds like I probably do have ADHD and maybe a learning disability, and that I should go get a full psycho-educational assessment done and referred me to a psychologist that could do that.   It cost me $1600 out of pocket, it should have been $2500 but I don't have insurance so the psychologist brought the price down for me. I worked weekends so I could take time off during the week to go be assessed, it was about 10 hours worth of tests and talking, and then two weeks after I got a diagnoses.   Then I took that diagnoses to my school's accessibility centre, where we discussed accommodations (extra time on exams, a private exam environment, a note taker during lectures, etc.).  That same day I went to my doctor at the school's health clinic and she read through my assessment results and we discussed medication options and I was prescribed Vyvanse.   The process started in February or March and I just started Vyvanse today, so it's a very very long process.   Best of luck!"

ADHD,3dqrxr,limezilla,5,Sat Jul 18 15:34:20 2015 UTC,"With medicine what dose you do well with in one class of ADHD medication is not necessary comparable to another dose of medication.  You may start getting side effects at X dose of medication but are able to stand a higher dose of the other medication and vice versa, also you may only have side effects at a low dose but at a medium or high dose the side effects go away.  It is trial and error, there is no universal rules just general probabilities where you describe what happens to groups of humans when you randomize hundreds of people, but that does not mean you will get the same effect as the ""average"" ADHD person.  This is because we are having several dozen, probably 40 genes interacting and people have different versions of these genes, and these genes also respond to the environment and are modified to some degree by your biological history during your development as a fetus, toddler, young child, adult, etc.    I am sorry that medicine is complicated and there is no ""simple answers,"" because your body is sacred you want proof, but to quote a fictional tv doctor on a fictional tv show (which sometimes has some very bad medicine and some good medicine.)

ADHD,3dqrxr,roland00,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:13:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks Roland00, as always your posts are on point.  As best I can find, the two meds in theory seem to be close in mg dosages, but obviously everyone needs to start low with any new med and titrate up.     One of the best posts I've found  is the second one in this thread which makes the case (even the author admits its fuzzy science) for a 1:1 ""conversion"" between d-amp and d-mph.  But if there's anyone out there with practical experience who has been on both d-amp(dexedrine) and d-mph(focalin) at seperate times, what dosages worked for you?"
ADHD,3dqrxr,roland00,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:48:20 2015 UTC,"The FDA tested maximum daily doses for the meds are roughly the same.  Methylphenidate is recommended max at 60 or 72mg in a single medication (the difference is the 72 MPH-OROS aka Concerta lasts a little longer than similar long acting meds so it gets a little extra allowance for the doses per hour are similar).  The FDA tested maximum daily dose for the both D-Amp and 75/25% drugs is 60 mg.  (Pure D-Amp is stronger than 75%/25%).  Vyvanse does not work like this.  Vyvanse has a completely different conversion for it has the lysine molecule included with the weight so its roughly only 30% as strong.  The thing is this is the maximum studied in a controlled way, I know of many studies that have studied in an open label way at higher doses but in a controlled random way of studies of 100 to 400 vs a similar number of placebo for at least 6 weeks I am not familiar with such doses being used higher than the FDA standards.    I am not trying to dance around the issue and not give you the black and white answer that you want.  I really wish I could, but there is no 1:1 conversion, or a 1 to 1.25 conversion, the meds work completely differently.  Yes they are stimulants, but how they achieve the stimulant effects are different and thus the side effects are different.  Both are reuptake inhibitors but one merely blocks the reuptake transporter, the other acts as a reversal of the reuptake transporter.  Amphetamine also reverses vmat2, works as a weak monoamine oxidase inhibitor, and it even influences the direct release of neurotransmitters.  Your nerve cells have ""stop switches"" which are called autoreceptors and heteroreceptors they tell the nerve cell that you released X much agent so stop releasing anymore neurotransmitters from storage for you have done enough.  This gives the nerve cell time to use the reuptake transporters to place the neurotransmitters back into storage.  There is a similar type of receptor to these autoreceptors and heteroreceptors but it works differently, instead it tells the nerve cell to do stuff.  Well a specific type of receptor called the TAAR1 receptor tells the nerve cell to release the neurotransmitters from storage, it tells the nerve cell to kick out its dopamine and norepinephrine for something is stimulating.  Now there are other ways your brain has the capabilities of doing this as well.  And a gene that makes the receptors that turn off things, can also be used in different places of the nerve cell to do things.  For example the D2 dopamine receptor, Alpha 2 receptors of various subtypes, and the Serotonin 5HT1 receptors of various subtypes tell the nerve cell to stop releasing neurotransmitters on the presynaptic area of the nerve cell receptors, the area of the 1st nerve cell that is very close to the the empty space of the 2nd nerve cell.  Now the postsynaptic area of the nerve cell of the 2nd nerve cell has receptors that can be the exact same genetic receptor with the same protein and everything it can be ""listening"" for the neurotransmitters the 1st cell releases and then it tells the cell to do things  when those neurotransmitters are released.  Genes can be multifaceted.        What I am trying to get you to understand is that we really do not know how this med will affect you, we know how it affects lots of people, but each person is different.  Your genes may make you very sensitive in a good or bad way to MAOI inhibitors, or releasing agents (if you have a SNAP25 problem often you need an amphetamine vs methyphendiate).  Or do to genes or an enviromental effect you may have lots of the receptors that turn things off, but very little of the ones that turn things on, I do not know.  Thus understand doctors follow general practices on how to do this as safe and as well as possible, to ease you in, and then find what is the best dose for you.  :)  Does this make any sense or you feel you are missing something?  Do you have any more questions?"

The one time I tried to get something from them on a weekend, because I was working full-time, they wouldn't do it because obviously my psychiatrist wasn't available.   Instead I order from Chemist Warehouse online. My psychiatrist sends the prescription directly to them for me, and each time I order I can choose to have them send me the remaining repeats or keep them on file."
ADHD,3do8go,mhacdebhandia,2,Sat Jul 18 01:11:36 2015 UTC,"Yup. My Ritalin scripts generally come with 4 refills, and for this one I've opted to do the sms service Chemist Warehouse offers where I just leave the script with them and they message me to say when my refill is available.  Mind you, I suspect my psychiatrist would cut down the refills pretty damned quickly if I ever showed any signs of addiction/misuse."

ADHD,3do8go,Addbutter,3,Fri Jul 17 22:18:51 2015 UTC,"I did have a similar sort of thing recently where I was really struggling to cope at work so the counselor I saw told me to go to my gp and get my dosage increased. Went to gp and he said he can't do that without a referral from a psychologist. Psychologist was away on holiday so it was 6 weeks before I could see him. Finally got to the psychologist and he tells me that my gp definitely could have upped the dosage on his own, it's just that some gps choose not to.   A little birdie told me though that the doctor I'm with is quite bad for that sort of thing, and recommended a better place, so might check them out"
ADHD,3do8go,GinjaNinja-NZ,4,Fri Jul 17 23:45:26 2015 UTC,"Do it. Mine won't up my dosage either, but at least she was honest and told me the real reason why - she has very little to no prior experience or training with ADHD/meds, and wasnt comfortable messing around with stimulant doses.  It sucks, but it earned her my respect for her honesty and willingness to say she doesn't know about something."
ADHD,3do8go,Xanthelei,3,Sat Jul 18 03:36:15 2015 UTC,"This is so weird to me. I'm Canadian, and I have no problem getting refills over the phone from my doctor, or at a walk-in as long as I have the most recent bottle with me. I'm assuming a Vyvanse Rx is much more tightly controlled elsewhere because these stories are totally mind-boggling to me.  I forgot my Vyvanse on a trip to the States once, and a pharmacy there absolutely wouldn't allow a refill to happen, even when my doctor called them and was willing to fax a new prescription. It sucked big time, it's like they don't understand how devastating a sudden crash/withdrawal is to an ADHD brain."
ADHD,3do8go,yourheartwasalegend,4,Sat Jul 18 00:56:34 2015 UTC,"In the US Concerta Adderral Vyvanse are all considered a controlled substance. Like a lot of stronger pain medication. Not entirely sure the reason why this is deemed better, but prescriptions for controls must be on paper. No refills are allowed to be written for (no x refills before y date). It cannot be electronically sent. It is kind of a pain in the ass."
ADHD,3do8go,mriswithe,10,Sat Jul 18 01:23:13 2015 UTC,"It's also stupid as shit in the case of ADHD meds. Yes, let's put getting a physical slip of paper from the doctor on time in the charge of someone who forgets things/has a hard time keeping track of dates/etc. Oh, and then let's make them do this every month! And take said paper to the pharmacy by hand! It's not like they'll forget or run out of time to do it right that day or lose it or anything!  /sigh"
ADHD,3do8go,Xanthelei,2,Sat Jul 18 03:32:39 2015 UTC,"It is even worse when your psychiatrist has ADHD, too; and forgets to sign the printed out script for several days, even with daily calls."

ADHD,3do8go,Xanthelei,4,Sat Jul 18 04:30:03 2015 UTC,"Over the phone?  Hahahahahaha.  When I get my vyvanse filled, my doctor has to put it into the computer system first (general Kaiser policy) and give me a written prescription  (legally required). The written prescription has 9 different security measurements: watermarks, things that show up if you scratch it, heat-sensitive seals, etc.  Then I go to the pharmacy. Two different people examine the written prescription and check my Kaiser card and state-issued ID. Then they fill it, I go to pay for it, another person checks my ID and Kaiser card, and then I can finally go.  Sometimes I think it'd be easier to buy it on the street."
ADHD,3do8go,sealifelover5,3,Sat Jul 18 02:51:05 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I think it'd be easier to buy it on the street.   Pharmaceutical amphetamines are far more expensive via that route. They can go anywhere from $5-$30 per pill, depending on area. It is worth the hassle, and lack of illicit activity to just get your script."
ADHD,3do8go,supersecret_DEA,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:36:41 2015 UTC,"I never actually would buy it on the street-I don't want to break the law when I have a prescription, risk not actually getting what I'm paying for, etc.  And you're definitely right about the price.  Once there was a bureaucratic mess-up and my health insurance got cancelled, but they told me I had a 30 day 'holdover' period.  I went to go pick up all of my meds in case it took them longer than that to fix it. Normally I pay $10/month for generic, $25/month for brand, but it turned out the holdover didn't apply to medications.    Fine, I need the meds, I know I'll get reimbursed for it, I'll put it on my credit card and risk having to pay a month's interest on it, it's a low interest rate anyway.  Like I said, I pay $25 per month, and since I get it 2 months at a time, I pay $50, even though now I'm at 60mg/day (at the time I was at 30mg/day).  Without insurance, the price for 100 of the 30mg pills was $1,030.  I nearly passed out.  They said to just come back once the insurance mess-up was fixed.  I called and managed to get it fixed by the next day, luckily, but now I sooooo don't complain about paying $50 for 2 months."

I was home for fall break (mid october), got my prescription, dropped it off at CVS, and went to pick it up before driving 3 hours back to school on Sunday. When I picked it up, they told me it was waiting on prior authorization from my insurance company (otherwise it would be $10 for 30 days of 1.5x 20mg tabs daily [so I could get 45 days out of a month's supply, since I visited home only over long weekend and holiday breaks]) and that it was $60 without insurance. I had to pay it because I didn't have time to wait for prior auth.   I got a gift card in the mail for CVS as a refund once prior auth went through. $60 was quite a bit of money for me, since all my spending money for the school year was earned via a $10/hr part time job during summer."

ADHD,3do8go,Xanthelei,2,Sat Jul 18 04:33:16 2015 UTC,"Not a refill story, but something I'm currently trying to deal with because I now have to take both of my IR pills at once (instead of two different times in the day) just to get some amount of focus and not start drifting off into la la land at my job...  I live in a weird place. My address is for City, CountyA, but I'm physically located in CountyB. For the longest time, CountyA and CountyB went through the same RSN for billing state-run health insurances, but as of July 1st they now bill separately, but only for mental health.   For whatever godforsaken reason, I'm apparently in the system at one point as living in CountyA, which is apparently how it's supposed to work, but also in the system as CountyB in some back-end screen that affects billing. So as of July 1st, I can't go anywhere for mental health coverage unless I pay out of pocket. I've now spent three full days of making calls and have driven in to the DSHS office in my nearby city only to be told every time ""oh we can't change that here, try there instead."" I finally have the direct phone number for the RSN that is now in charge of my city... And he's been out of the office all week. Won't be back til next Monday.  Meanwhile, I take two pills right before going to work and pray they don't stop working too, because my GP isn't willing to increase my dose, and last time is brought it up I started having to go in for a checkup every time I needed a prescription. So once a month.  I'm honestly worried for my job, if this hadn't happened I could be seeing a psychiatrist next week, but the soonest anyone could have gotten me in was July 3rd, and no one could confirm they'd get paid, so they wouldn't schedule anything... I'm looking at another month once this is finally sorted out before anyone will be available."

No such thing as a refill ... as my prescription for Concerta is about to run out, I need an appointment with my physician to get another prescription. Only a few pharmacies carry medications like Concerta so I need to go to a pre-selected one. And as is the case with all prescriptions in Japan, if I don't fill it within 3-4 days, by law the prescription becomes invalid. Once they made an exception after they called the physician (it took a full day) and it was for a non-stimulant medication."
ADHD,3do8go,babeside,2,Sat Jul 18 04:13:15 2015 UTC,This happens to me a lot. It's pretty scary. I go through withdrawal within a couple of days. The last time it happened to me my shrink forgot his prescription pad. The time before that he never showed up to the appointment.   What helped a bit for me was drinking an energy drink and possibly taking a couple of those sinus pills with the stimulant in it that tweakers like. Not sure what it's called.
ADHD,3do8go,babeside,4,Sat Jul 18 09:34:42 2015 UTC,"You should find another doctor, because this behavior is inexcusable. Also, please don't talk about drug abuse (what you did with the OTC medication is technically abuse)."
ADHD,3do8go,mriswithe,5,Fri Jul 17 22:52:30 2015 UTC,So I am. Energy drinks and taking meds during allergy season at the recommended dosage is not remotely drug abuse. Wow.
ADHD,3do8go,babeside,5,Sat Jul 18 00:26:41 2015 UTC,"I think he means the intent behind the Sudafed.  Specifically that you said you used it not for allergies, but to help cope with not having your normal stimulants.   Though I see a lot of people talking about how great weed is for ADHD symptoms/sleep/whatever and haven't seen a mod rebuke them. I mean I don't think it should be illegal, but it is...  Shrug just an observation."
ADHD,3do8go,mriswithe,3,Sat Jul 18 00:32:39 2015 UTC,My bad. I have ADHD so sometimes I don't make super descriptive statements. Taking my allergy meds for allergies and also drinking my normal Rockstar in the morning helped me when I was going through withdrawal.
ADHD,3do8go,babeside,2,Sat Jul 18 01:27:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly either way doesn't bother me, I was just trying to explain the mod's view.  I mean the Sudafed isn't a great choice, but in the end you were put in a shit position and did what you could to try and make it less awful. Also realistically we take something a lot stronger than Sudafed on a daily basis so maybe it isn't a big deal."

ADHD,3do8go,vengeance_pigeon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:19:14 2015 UTC,"I don't generally have an issue getting my doctor to agree to write the script. What I do have problems with is his ADHD (and his staff that don't seem to realize he needs constant reminders about stuff like this) and forgetting to sign the script after it is printed out for 2-4 days.   CVS (which is 2 minutes from my doctor's office) refuses to fill a script before 28 days have passed since filling the same dosage and supply. My dose increased to 30mg IR amph salts and CVS doesn't carry that dose, so I go 10 minutes away to Wegmans, where I have my script filled in 15 minutes instead of CVS's 1-2 hours if I give the script to them at any point in the day after the first hour they are open. CVS also seems to have issue in their computers where the technician accepting the script can't tell if it is IR or ER and has to check with the pharmacist every time... for a computer-generated script.  EDIT: and Wegmans has never had an issue with a refill at day 24 or day 26 when I needed it for vacation, nor have they even asked."
ADHD,3dmezd,stillcole,11,Fri Jul 17 13:27:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, pretty common ADHD problem, related to poor processing speed and working memory deficits, as well as the social anxiety that often comes with (or stems from?) ADHD.   Unlike you, having a drink helps me tremendously. There's a reason they call it a ""social lubricant"". Meds help a little but they also make me a bit  anti-social and irritable, which cancels out any social benefit.   Besides  exercise and avoiding food that makes you groggy (white carbs and sugar turn me into a couch lump), there's nothing much to be done about it. You have the brain you have, Not everyone is cut out to be great at small talk. Focus on your strengths and cut yourself some slack. As long as you're kind, honest and polite the people who matter will still like you plenty :)"

ADHD,3dmezd,S0TH1S,10,Sat Jul 18 05:15:02 2015 UTC,"I hear you. I've always had problems with that kind of stuff. People often used to think it's because I'm self absorbed, but that's not the case.   I've had to make a concerted effort to train myself in conversational techniques, ways to make small talk, etc. Hours spent reading through articles on the art of conversation. It's helped. Now I'm pretty good at faking it, but it still takes a big effort on my part to be a good conversationalist. Social events can be draining."
ADHD,3dmezd,Osric250,4,Fri Jul 17 13:44:21 2015 UTC,"One of the biggest problems I have in regards to fluency is that I have a significant delay in processing if I only hear someone. It can sometimes take 3-5 seconds for me to process something that someone says, which usually results in me giving them a dumb stare for a moment or starting to ask them to repeat themselves before I grip it and respond like normal.  I can somewhat counter this by reinforcing their words with lip reading despite not being hard of hearing at all, as well as body language. I'm fairly certain this is a good portion of my anxiety of talking with people on the phone, as I can't employ that coping mechanism.  And then add on top that I'm often slow to respond in my answers, being picky about my word choice and phrasing and sometimes getting lost trying to choose the appropriate word that I'm looking for. It can make flowing conversations awkward sometimes.  I'm the same as you that I have a number of friends, and good ones at that, and don't have problems connecting with people. I've also found that I really enjoy performing in front of others. I'm terrible at improvisation, but scripted performances are really good because I have no trouble at all speaking something that is pre-written.  In the end though, I don't know if there's a real way to overcome it, but there are definitely ways of coping, but what works for some might not work for others."
ADHD,3dmezd,Rastataoist,5,Fri Jul 17 23:36:25 2015 UTC,"Wow, you just hit the nail on the head of something I have been trying to pinpoint for a while now.  I constantly find myself asking someone - ""What was that again?""  Only to quickly realize I had actually heard them just hadn't processed what they said.  Drives people crazy when they start to repeat themselves and I'm already starting to respond to what they said.  I also have an identical problem on the phone.  For me, I tend to fall back onto pre-thought out scripts (especially at the beginning of phone calls) and it takes me a second to change course into actually being in the conversation... which can make for some really awkward moments.  Especially because it's already hard to even focus on someone talking who isn't right in front of me."

I try to suppress my responses. I try to double check questions because my verbal trigger pull is feather light and needs adjusting.

Just the other night we had family over, and my BIL was going on and on for about 10 minutes about a topic I legitimately have no interest or knowledge in. Half way through his monologue I was acutely aware of what kind of blank look of boredom my face must have been showing.  At the end of his speech I just kind of sat there trying to piece together what the hell he was rambling on about.   I had an interview recently as well, where I was asked technical questions, for which I did know the answers, but formulating verbal responses that suggested as much was right out the window. I ended up sounding like a complete moron, that had no clue what he was talking about...   sigh ah well."

ADHD,3dmezd,Sheerardio,5,Fri Jul 17 22:04:26 2015 UTC,"I am almost completely incapable of stringing together a coherent sentence in a conversation when I haven't taken my meds.  Phone conversations are a special kind of torture for me because I cannot process what the person on the other end is saying.  I come across as a complete airhead with a hearing problem.  As a result I will go to great lengths to avoid doing anything over the phone, and I have learned to fear speaking up in conversations - especially group settings, because I can't string a sentence together fast enough to keep pace.  The only solution I've found is to take my meds.  Eating less sugar and processed food makes it less severe, but the meds are the only thing that improves it."
ADHD,3dmezd,babeside,3,Fri Jul 17 19:10:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have a lot of problems with this too. It caused a lot of friction in all of my relationships. Right now, all I do is focus on listening very intently. I focus all of my attention on my SO. I try not interrupt at all, even if it's really hard, and I feel like I'm going to jump out of my chair.  More often then not my SO just wants me to listen and doesn't really need my response. I just think of it more as a story. It gets easier to do as I practice and it makes my SO feel more appreciated. Then I can share whatever comes to mind after that.   What I had to let go of was the fear of losing the thought I was saving for a response. Now I don't even begin to formulate that thought until after the other person has stopped speaking all together. This works really well for us and for me.  It's a very easy and simple thing that I can do for my SO that gets me a lot of brownie points. My SO sees that I'm trying so the times I do slip up or interrupt or am just not listening, I get more slack."

ADHD,3dmezd,WJSidis,2,Fri Jul 17 21:42:42 2015 UTC,"Wow, yeah I have the same problem. I didn't even realize it was related to ADD until I started medication and noticed an improvement.  I often found myself super interested in the conversation that I wouldnt be able to wait patiently for my turn to speak. If I was less interested, I would be thinking of numerous other things and wouldn't participate in conversation.  If the topic was emotionally striking in some way, I would get caught up in thinking about how I feel and how what they're saying is changing how I feel and suddenly become speechless. It was really hard for me to find things to add to conversation because I would be thinking of a million random topics.. I thought I was just too stuck in my own head or shy in some way. After taking medication I think so clearly and can actually have a wonderful conversation with someone without feeling like I'm trapped or at loss of words. My thoughts are much more organized so I can express my thoughts in a more intelligent/effective way.  I don't get stuck trying to think of a specific word that I want to use but it won't come to me. It's amazing how much it affected my social life because I was unable to communicate effectively."
ADHD,3dmezd,aeast0228,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:16:30 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, funny you should mention the speech thing. My friends and family used to frequently point out to me that I do this thing where I don't finish my sentences. I'll be halfway through a statement and then just sort of drift off or blank out. It drives them batshit, and the weird thing is that I can never catch myself doing it. They yell at me when it happens, and I otherwise would never even be aware that I'm doing it. About 50% of the time I can't remember what I had even started to say, so I can't even finish my sentence even after being prompted.  Since being made aware of this, I have improved almost 100%, but it takes a lot of concentration for me sometimes just to make sure I say everything I intended to. I rarely still ""phase out"" if I'm not paying enough attention but it's not so much driving my friends and family insane anymore, haha."

I noticed this when I started this weird period of just limited socialization, my speech became harder and harder to make sense of because I was having to fight against my thoughts being 90 miles down the street and I'm still trying to finish the conversation."
ADHD,3dmezd,Smalls_Biggie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:14:01 2015 UTC,"Yep, I frequently experience this. Before I got on medication it was really frequent and I had a difficult time dealing with it. Medication definitely made it work, also analyzing how I think and marginally slowing down  helped."
ADHD,3dnqns,Da_BudHound,17,Fri Jul 17 19:37:07 2015 UTC,"Haha, this is amusing to me.  Your Adderall is 'X-tended Release', so there's a peak concentration time after you've taken your pill. This is evident in your classwork time.  You've already notice the come-down effects already, and that's normal.  The keep taking your medication as prescribed, so your body will get used to its effects. After a while, the Adderall should be less intense. This is commonly referred as the 'Honeymoon Phase'."
ADHD,3dnqns,bojanger,3,Fri Jul 17 20:45:48 2015 UTC,"Nope, you did nothing wrong. I have been taking adderall XR for over two years, and I can relate. Adderall is an amphetamine and getting a euphoric, high, talkative feeling is completely normal. My advice is continue to be aware of how it is affecting you, and if it isn't working talk to your doctor about dosage or different med options. Give yourself at least a week to test Adderall out, and see how it works when your body has had a chance to adjust a bit. Also, just a heads up, make sure that you are still eating enough. Adderall is notorious for killing appetite. If you have any other questions feel free to PM me :) Best of luck!"
ADHD,3dnqns,Sven_0722,2,Fri Jul 17 23:43:01 2015 UTC,Our body takes time to adjust to medications like Adderall. It might take couple of weeks to get to a stable to state. It is good to keep a journal of the changes though.

ADHD,3dowz7,exceive,2,Sat Jul 18 01:30:31 2015 UTC,"This is a huge issue when trying to be productive. I am distracted by too many things. I dont have time to pursue it all and it sucks to manage focus in such an interesting place. Oh well! Reality demands service!  For the task you are describing there is a delicate balance needed between the micro and macro (and this can be tweaked based on comolexity.) It is hard tedious and initially time consuming but totally doable.  One method i use is very similar to the pomodoro technique. Taking breaks help to give you a chance to pull back and ask yourself if you're on track.   Another thing i do is have project based goals and objectives. Kind of like the master goal list. Each individual component nomenclature you use then gets broken down the same way to a reasonable and manageable level. I brain storm Strom on paper, then with a free program called freemind, then I again organize and tyoe it in then print off this massive tree chart (I don't recall the precise term but it is whatever freemind is based off of.) I then put it on the wall next to my desk so I can add notes cross things off, create reminders etc. I then try to update it as needed.  Another thing I do is journalize. I keep multiple. Personal, professional, project. I try and keep these notes as a reference and as back up memory. I use paper and computer rarely (i get too verbose and long winded AND paper is magic!) When I leave my office I rarely bring the journal with me because I will misplace it as soon as I start chatting with someone! I use another paper or yet another notebook! Confused yet? LOL I know it's wonky and obsessive but it works (on rare occasions it may work too well for me.)  To clarify, my daily task list starts on as a scribbled note. Ideally, it is then written down in the daily task list journal notebook. These redundant steps actually help reinforce focus and helps in retention in the long run.  For me, pen and paper is an extension of my brain. I can draw doodle, highlight and think both analytically and creatively magnitudes better than by using an electronic method. Plus, some things can be written and and printed off for later. This second read through reinforces the important things by making you plod thru them again. Typing them down demands a different set of muscles and it's a different experience. The repetition totally helps.  I hope this might be of help with your research. I would be totally distracted too! Hang in there buddy!  Edit  Still cleaning and clarifying. However, let me explain another reason why I write so much and rely on so many paper systems: in order to manage focus I am trying to be able to turn it off when not working. It is difficult because I sometimes want to do something else besides work. In fact I think I might be a workaholic and I'm fearful to flip the switch back on. It's a pain. For far too long I used booze and it doesn't work any longer so I ditched it. Oh well! The stuggle is real."

ADHD,3dmp2g,Guitarsoul24,31,Fri Jul 17 14:54:25 2015 UTC,"Don't disclose it to your employer, unless you absolutely need accommodations that a normal person wouldn't need. With drug testing, the testing company is almost always required to contact you about your results to ask for proof of legit prescription before they submit their results to your potential employer. Just to be safe, take your meds to your testing location and show them to the person administering the test (either a doctor or the person collecting the urine/hair samples). It also wouldn't hurt to have a short letter from your doctor (on their practice's letterhead, if possible) confirming that you're being treated by them, the validity of your prescription(s), and listing all of the medications you're taking. None of this information should be disclosed by the testing facility to your potential employer."

ADHD,3dmp2g,nerdshark,5,Fri Jul 17 18:58:12 2015 UTC,"Personally, (and I must stress, this is personal opinion) I told my direct manager and HR and no one else. The reason I did this is because it became much easier to explain why certain things were more difficult for me to complete than others, while I might not have required accommodations, simply having my manager aware of how I work best and why I work the way I do has made my job a incalculable amount less stressful.  Now, that being said, do I think (in my personal opinion) you should disclose this information while being hired? No. Absolutely not. While the American Disabilities Act does protect you from discrimination, people with ADHD have been fired or rejected in the past, in one example I recall reading about, the employer fired a woman upon her disclosing she had ADHD, she attempted to sue. The Employer than claimed that her ADHD made it impossible for her to perform the basic functions of her job as well as someone else, which was bullshit as she had been doing it for 5 years. The employer won the case.  So, there are some times when it's a bad idea to even bring it up ever, which is what /u/nerdshark and /u/seymoremcfly are basically saying, err on the side of caution, but if you feel that your company isn't a bunch of scumbags, and you think your manager knowing could improve your situation, I would say, again in my personal opinion, you might at least consider it."

If you're legally prescribed, then you're fine. Not to mention, the percentage of program/web devs. on adderal is really high compared to other careers.

For example, in Colorado, under most government contracts, even though marijuana is legal there, it's illegal to use while you're employed. Stimulants like adderal CAN be prohibited, but that's usually on jobs where you're literally only a step away from being enlisted yourself. You need to read your employee hand book and review the paperwork you signed upon employment to see if you fall under any of these rules your employer may have asked you to comply with upon said employment."

For your own job security, never tell your employer unless it's absolutely necessary.  Edit: By 'indirectly', I mean that some employers will try to find another reason or technicality to use as a reason for firing. Of course, ADHD is a legally-recognized psychiatric disorder and is protected under the ADA (in the US) and no sane employer will open themselves to litigation by firing someone expressly because they have ADHD."
ADHD,3dmp2g,nerdshark,2,Fri Jul 17 19:22:57 2015 UTC,"I agree you shouldn't be walking around advertising that you're on stimulant medication, however, being asked by an employer to take a urine test for employment immediately categorizes telling said employer as 100% necessary. The alternative is popping a urine test and failing, and you WILL pop, so waiting until you fail to tell them is not a good choice. Telling them upon being requested is the best choice. I agree only giving them as much detail as they ask for is also a good choice upon the request. I would start with telling them you're on a prescription that would throw the results off but you'd be happy to provide documentation upon request.  Second of all, in the tech industry, I still haven't found a group that will fire you for ADHD OR stimulant use. I know that the west coast is very open about both. I'm in New York State and I haven't seen or heard of this either.  TL;DR I agree with only telling people as much as you have to, but to do it before failing a test you know you'll fail, but, at least in the programming field, I've yet to see anyone be discriminated against because they have ADHD."
ADHD,3dmp2g,BloodyFreeze,7,Fri Jul 17 19:34:19 2015 UTC,"however, being asked by an employer to take a urine test for employment immediately categorizes telling said employer as 100% necessary.   Nope. You tell the company administering the drug test, not the employer. The company administering the drug test will report negative results for drugs if they find you're using legally-prescribed substances consistent with the prescription information you provide them. None of your medical information should be passed to your employer by the drug test administration company, and your medical history is very heavily protected by HIPPA, because your medical history could be used to discriminate against you. The only reason that anybody at your company (limited HR or your supervisor) can access your medical information is for administering sick leave, worker's compensation, wellness programs, or health insurance.   Second of all, in the tech industry, I still haven't found a group that will fire you for ADHD OR stimulant use.   Of course not, because that would be grounds for an incredibly easy-to-win law suit. If someone wants to fire you for your ADHD or stimulant use, they'll find another reason or technicality.   I know that the west coast is very open about both. I'm in New York State and I haven't seen or heard of this either.   Anecdotes. Just because it hasn't happened to you or anyone you know doesn't mean it hasn't happened to anybody else.

It'll show in your pros and cons. Keep it up the progress and CO might draft award letter at the end of the quarter."" (immediate rewards) Forgot to charge your phone and need to call the shop.... Don't matter they made you laminate and put the recall roster in your wallet. ""Hey fucker! When I'm showing (teaching) you something you better take some goddamn notes cause I am not gonna say this shit twice, you understand."" ""Excuse me Staff Sergeant can I borrow your pen."" Pfc asks. ""You need to have a pen and notepad at all times devil dog, here have this one.""   These things sound familiar because they are the same kind of stuff that Dr. Russel Barkley tells one with ADHD to do. Remember the importance of external influences, an ADHD mind can't account for itself so something or someone else has too. In the USMC if your NCO doesn't know everything about your life, he/she a shit bag. When living in barracks deck NCOs, duty SGTs, Squadron Guns or Sergeant Majors can stop by and inspect your room at anytime. Boundaries are not really a thing in the Marine Corps they will make sure you do your job. It is everyone's responsibility to make sure everyone in the platoon/shop/office/crew is responsible mindset.   TL:DR Kinda just puked words everywhere before heading out. Sorry, about the length.

These impairments don't define me, and ultimately don't limit me, but they can wear me down and drain my energy and optimism and make life hard... much harder than it has to be sometimes.   I work with doctors, family, and myself to treat this condition and find ways to alleviate the functional impairment and distress caused by the symptoms (and stigma). Luckily, there are great medications that really help me, and I can function almost completely normally and lead a full, healthy life without being limited or worn down by my condition.

Your brain is fundamentally different.  That can be very hard shallow. This disability is mostly invisible, which tends to result in people treating you like any anyone else, which definitely doesn't help.  my father is hard enough to convince that I have this disorder, let alone how he can help me manage.

Or if you need an example to match the fact you'd have to take ADHD meds every single day:  There's a digestive disorder where certain foods will ferment in your stomach, rather than be digested.  If the option were to either take a pill every day for the rest of your life, or to never again eat solid food, which would you do?  Does using a hearing aid, or taking a pill, lessen the people with those conditions?  Are they being lazy, or ""cheating"", by taking the ""easy"" way out?

ADHD,3dmtxy,tallgirl32,3,Fri Jul 17 22:06:39 2015 UTC,"The way you second guess yourself, question if you're lazy, etc. resonates with me a lot.  I've had a lot of introspective moments/failing self esteem in the past because I wasn't sure if I really have ADHD.   The key is to stop moralizing it and trust your gut. I still sometimes second guess if maybe I just lack discipline or I'm lazy or somehow weaker than my peers, but I also kind of no longer care in a weird way. Who cares if I (or you, or any of us) take medication to balance my brain? I am slowly realizing that ADHD is just another thing in my life that I deal with, the same way anyone deals with anything. Even if I didn't have an ADHD diagnosis, I wouldn't feel bad about taking the necessary steps to ensure I was able to function properly.   I feel like #5 & #6 on your list are illustrative of everyone, not just us with ADHD. No one should care if you've found a way to overcome this one thing (of many things) that sometimes gets in the way of your life. You wouldn't blame a diabetic for needing insulin, but not always having the perfect diet.   It's nobody else's business if you need meds, or rely on your phone to remind you of things, or need therapy or whatever.  What should come first is that you take care of yourself.

I even put off talking to a doctor about ADHD for over five years because I had such a hard time justifying my need for medication. I finally started medication just this week.  I think, for myself at least, this stems from an overly romanticized idea of the self-sufficient individual who should not have to rely on any external crutches, which serve to make life easier and, consequently, less rewarding. I don't know why I defaulted to this line of thinking, but I think it's safe to say that the notion is deeply ingrained in hyper-individualistic Western culture.  I can't succinctly express how I've slowly moved away from this attitude. I agree with you that life isn't supposed to be simple or easy. However, I'm not sure that medication makes life simpler or easier. Like turning a light on to better read a book, I think medication can serve as a tool to aid us in tasks that we are already motivated to accomplish; the brighter light in no way diminishes the fact that you are the one engaging in the real task of comprehending the book.   Honestly though, you are probably the only person who can come up with a reasonable justification for yourself. Good luck to you."

Oral Ritailn instant release takes around 30-60 minutes to take effect and has an active duration of 2-4 hours, but this differs for everyone   therefore if you want it to be active while your doing a task it is important to allow time for it to work.  It won't 'make' you do the productive thing, you have to want to do it, it will only help you do the productive thing without getting distracted etc...

I am now on Cymbalta 120mg and Wellbutrin 150mg and my problems are similar to the 30mg Cymbalta of a year ago.  Cymbalta I am on due to a chronic autoimmune condition causing chronic pain which Cymbalta a SNRI antidepressant treats.  It also treats depression and several forms of anxiety.    The reason why we want to eliminate wellbutrin is to make sure it is not adding anything negative, if it was doing something positive with no downside we can always bring it back.  We are trying to move from 4 medications (concerta, intuniv for ADHD, cymbalta for everything else, wellbutrin for sexual side effects caused by cymbalta) to 3 medications.  If there is no downside of having wellbutrin we bring it back.  Remember with medication it is trial and error, you can always return to a medicine, or change your dose again if you do not improve after a change and a previous dose or med was better for you.  You just want to only do changes 1 at a time, you also want to do the changes with the doses slowly and make sure they have enough time to cause whatever change they need to do (which can be days or weeks depending on the type of med).  This is called titration. Titration is both an art and science and I think more doctors should get titration beaten into their skull even though titration at the heart is very very simple.  You learn the general rules, and you give the doctor an info sheet like the manufacturers prescriber instructions on what is proper titration.    I can tell you lots of stories on how my Vyvanse dose when I was on Vyvanse (I am now on Concerta) gave me super focus and I had blinders on just like you did.  Strattera was the opposite, I actually had greater flexibility and creative thinking, it just helped nothing with focus, and lots of other stories of those 5 meds and various combinations.  Finding the right med is trial and error.  That said understand you are not alone and many of us have been here before.  Good Luck :)"
ADHD,3dm6ok,roland00,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:10:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  It sucks because I no longer on the same insurance and I didn't actually get a DX.  I just went and gave very detailed account of all of my symptoms from different times and situations in my life end was given medication.  Now I know longer insured by the same company because I messed up my paperwork.  So I either have to a lot more or find someone else but know that may very well not give me medication for quite a while .  And quite frankly it's mostly because I don't feel like doing the trial and error.  The main thing my therapist and I are working on right now, though, is realizing that we often have to do things that we don't want to do. I feel like such a child when I talk to her sometimes."
ADHD,3dm6ok,Sheerardio,2,Fri Jul 17 17:21:14 2015 UTC,"Trust me I understand.  One of the good things that occured with me in medicine with hindsight (which I do not recommend) is I deal with all that emotional growing years before medicine for I was raised in a culture that emphasized the perils of medicine and emphasized the moral righteous of hard work and such.  Thus it was like being beaten in the head with a sledgehammer there are things I can not change and I just have to deal with it, it changed my thinking from black and white good and BAD, to better or not better.    If you feel like a child then you need to talk this through with your therapist, you need to state the obvious in conversation and explain why you are doing this, and what improvements you have made.  One thing that is inherent with ADHD is that we take external forms of information and put higher emphasis than our own internal thoughts and self viewpoints.  This is because ADHD is a disorder that disrupts 7 executive functions and 2 of them is  1) self monitoring, aka self reflection and self observation over time and space (aka the present environment and the past and future environments) and 2) inhibition of behaviors that would disrupt own of these 3 states of time, aka inhibition of impulsivity or compulsivity if doing something simple and easy does not line up with your long term future.        Thus your brain will not reflect and take pride of all the improvements you have made unless someone points it out to you, and forces your attention to dwell on this for an extended period.  Next time you are in therapy spend 10 minutes to recall every good thing that therapy and meds have brough you so far.  Build up your win loss record, but do not forget to acknowledge all the progress you have made.  Once you have done that it will be easier to feel less like a child, and it will be easier to find serenity and the mental mindspace to deal with all of this.  Good Luck :)  Trust me it gets better, it takes time, but its 2 steps forward 1 step back, do not dwell on the 1 step back but on the fact you are net 1 step ahead."
ADHD,3dm6ok,roland00,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:03:52 2015 UTC,"oh my god thank you for that last section.  You just reminded me that it's been a while since I stopped and took a moment to count my accomplishments.    It really is something that the ADHD brain has to put a concentrated effort towards, because otherwise I spend most of my time thinking i'm a failure and a piece of crap even though I'm really not.  Does it ever feel like... it hurts, or is just generally painful, when you really try to put your attention on the positive?  Like the emotional version of physical therapy, it feels both good and necessary and at the same time awful?"
ADHD,3dm6ok,Sheerardio,2,Fri Jul 17 19:36:14 2015 UTC,"Yes.  I am a person who has many conditions, ADHD, Autoimmune Disorder that causes chronic pain, possibly some small amount of asperger's, small amount of OCD (not clinical), sensory problems, and half a dozen things like various learning difficulties with certain styles of learning.  But one of my biggest problems a problem I had since 10 and probably even before that.  Is a constant fear of dread, in situations I do not control and I do not know what is going to happen and something bad may occur.  It is not a sense of panic, or worry, but a feeling of doom, and always being on edge.  It is not a fear of doom, or an expectation of doom to happen, it is the knowledge it can happen if I choose poorly.  Every decision feels like the end of the last crusade and it just does not stop.  When such a feeling propagates in your life in an endless fashion it is hard to be oppostimitc, it is hard to take chances and be spontaneous, and do the things you want.  You get stucked.    Part of my stuff before medicine was starting to learn how to let go and just to accept things, and to be okay with the past and my past mistakes, but I have not really learned the opposite which is to reattach and to take chances, how to hold the figuratively reins of my horse I am riding both lightly, but not to surrend all control by completely letting go.    So please spend some time with your therapist to do some good and talk about your strengths.  We know from many research studies that you need about 80% praise, and 20% correction to keep motivation.  This number is often reversed with ADHD, we hear all the negative and barely hear the positive."
ADHD,3dm6ok,roland00,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:50:33 2015 UTC,"I actually fairly recently stopped seeing a therapist, after going for several years.  Her theories on my progression were moving in a very different direction than what I was okay with, and ironically if it had not been for all the years spent with her learning how to find my own internal voice and how to put words to all those weird, not-comfortable feelings, I never would have been able to recognize that I was not okay with the situation - or more importantly that I was allowed to not be okay with it!  So far I have been doing very well.  I have an incredibly supportive husband who regularly makes a point of calling me out for my successes, and I've learned enough through my time in therapy to feel confident about self-management.  It has been several decades in the making though, and one of the biggest challenges to overcome was accepting that no progress was going to come quickly, or easily.  I still have a constant fear of failure, but I've learned how to use that voice to make extra sure I don't fail, instead.  I wish you all the best in your own pursuit of a balanced, happy, state of self.  It's a hard road, and it sounds like you've got more than your fair share of hurdles to get through, but if I can get to the other side then so can you, because you are clearly an awesome person. :D"

For my ADHD, nothing has helped with my focus, yet. They all just give me energy, which in turn makes me more productive, but I'm still all over the place. I'm looking for the one that helps me focus, still.  For depression, they've done nothing but have negative side effects. I've had blood work done, and I metabolize everything fine, but I get side effects that aren't even listed, and often the rare ones (>.5% of people).

Kind of helped, a little, sometimes, but was obviously just not remotely enough.  Strattera - No negative side effects, but no noticeable benefits, either.  Concerta - Very obvious, very immediate benefits, but also made my heart race and completely eliminated my appetite.  Didn't stay on it long.  Adderall - Obvious benefits, some obvious side effects only after I hadn't taken it in a while (nasty dry mouth, insomnia, reduced appetite).  Took a few years to realize it was fucking up my eyesight, making me ultrasensitive to bright lights and blurring my vision.  I couldn't be in a car at night because the street lights would give me intense migraines.  Focalin - Many of the same side effects as Adderall, significantly less noticeable benefit.  Vyvanse - Noticeable benefits, though less than Adderall.  Sides effects are very mild: slightly reduced appetite and the very rare sleepless night.

Lamictal (wonder drug for some people, triggered a nasty irritable hypomania in me, I quit 3 jobs in two weeks and almost divorced my husband), risperadone (weird, weird drug),seroquel (works, but makes you a zombie and binge eat like crazy), almost every SSRI (bad, bad for me, super hypermania, my credit card bills increased significantly).  Dexedrine, best drug ever, but really, really difficult to obtain.  Adderall as result of not being able to obtain dexedrine, works a lot like dexedrine, but not as smooth, but I'll take what I can get.  Gabapentin at a reasonably high dose has really evened out my mood, makes me feel great, talkative, and not irritable (my irritability makes my world intolerable, and has had bad effects on my loved ones)  Ambien (finally sleep, good sleep with no antipsychotic hangover)  I've been on others, but this is getting long.

Both the tactile stimulation of periodically picking at it, and the low level caloric intake sustains me across the day, between my 8am breakfast, and 8pm dinner. I also find that it is a real boost to my attentiveness, even if I don't feel hungry, my body still needs calories to run.  Also, you might try more protein/fats and less carbs (rice) at breakfast.

Nutrition is super important to effectively use it, which sucks, because it makes it so hard to eat regularly.  Like others have said, a big low GI breakfast is paramount.  Mine is Oats and Bananas.  I was always told to take my meds with breakfast.  I have started taking my meds half an hour after breakfast.  I have found the appetite suppressant nature is mitigated when delaying the medication to allow for the digestion to begin.  This usually means I get hungry about 11:30am, which is an awesome time for me to eat, as it means I will be wanting a little snack by 3.  This gets me through to dinner at 7."

I will drink 2-3 of these a day and wait for the meds to wear off and have a decent dinner.    That said, after a year of being on the Concerta it is getting easier and easier to stomach solid foods while the meds are still active.

I'm on concerta as well, and have been for most of my life,  The trick that works for me is setting out to put in place a routine,  For example, I have breakfast before I take my meds every morning, two pieces of toast with peanut butter, the same thing every day is comforting because I don't have the hassle of having to try and decide what to have and I don't have to waste any mental energy planning it, it's become a reflex almost.  Then I try to go for lunch at 12:00 on the dot every day at work, again usually variations of the same thing because it's easy and taking the thought out of it works for me.  I've found by doing this your body clock gets used to the schedule and routine,  and around lunch time will be thinking, it's time for food now, time to feel hungry.  My reasoning for this working is because in the past I've had a mid morning snack at about 10:30 for a few days in a row and then the day that I didn't, I found myself feeling hungry at almost exactly 10:30.

At noon or a couple hours after breakfast: drink a smoothie  Early to mid afternoon: gradually munch on whatever carbs sound appealing (I like nachos or Mac 'n' cheese)  Dinner:  meds will mostly have worn off, so you'll have an adequate apetite for consuming a large meal  Midnight to 3 AM: go to Del Taco and buy an Epic Burrito (Cali Steak and Guac' is my personal favorite, but the new Chicken Avocado one is good as well).  This will fill you up with carbs and protein that you'll digest while asleep, thus providing you with the extra energy you'll need the next day, but also expanding your stomach so that you have a decent apetite when breakfast-time comes.    That is the daily routine, and it works for me :)"

I'd say the best way to gauge this is by doing objective reporting instead of explaining how you feel, and bringing it to your doctor.  i.e.   Timing how long it takes to do a specific task off medication vs. on different doses Writing down when it kicked in, how long it lasted (like you began to do above) If specific symptoms are showing improvement or not, and maybe an example (I knew my dosage wasn't enough when I put my shoe half-on and forgot what I was doing and walked off)   I'm also trying to figure out if my dose, which already was pretty mild, is working at all anymore.

ADHD,3do4vr,schleppenheimer,2,Fri Jul 17 21:26:24 2015 UTC,"Evekeo is a racemic amphetamine formulation (50% levoamphetamine, 50% dextroamphetamine). It's kind of similar to Adderall, except that Adderall has a different ratio of levoamphetamine to dextroamphetamine.  As for asking for experience, nobody else's experiences have any bearing on how your son will experience the medication, because it is not possible to determine how your son will react. Given that he HAS reacted positively to another amphetamine (Vyvanse is lisdexamfetamine, which is metabolically processed into dextroamphetamine), it is probably safe to assume that your son will react well to Evekeo.  However, I question the doctor's judgment about switching to another medication. ADHD medications are not a cure: they will not instantly turn him into a productivity machine, and medication does not teach life skills like time and task management. He still has to put in conscious effort to do stuff; the medications just make doing stuff easier. It sounds like your son would benefit from therapy that will help him make the most of his medication.  Also, I don't think it's realistic to expect consistency even with stimulants, because stimulants only treat some of the symptoms of ADHD. Recent research shows that stimulant and non-stimulant (atomoxetine, guanfacine, clonidine) combinations are extremely effective and well-tolerated in many people with ADHD, because the stimulants and non-stimulants largely treat separate groups of symptoms (with about 10-30% overlap in symptom coverage)."
ADHD,3do4vr,nerdshark,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:27:31 2015 UTC,"We've been at this a long time with my son, and he has tried virtually all of the medications.  He does receive therapy at the same time.  We also do not expect that the stimulants will provide consistency.  I mis-wrote what I meant to say, which is that my son will do well on the doctor's test partially because he knows what to expect from the tests after four years of this med trial type stuff -- I meant to say that he cannot be consistent with his motivation to achieve at an even mid-range level.  It's stunning what he can do under pressure, but he cannot self-regulate in order to plan, or be vigilant in doing what it takes to do college classes or probably even hold down a job.    Enough people on this sight have spoken to their ability with certain medications to be able to overcome the very thing that I am talking about -- vigilance in keeping up with responsibilities -- so I don't think that I'm asking for the moon here.  I just want my son to be able to have a shot at a normal life.  Also, the doctor is a specialist in ADD.  His judgment is pretty sound.  What he is failing to do, in this particular instance, is recognize that although my son does great on these very particular tests, he is still incredibly tired on the level of medication that he is given.  Tired + ADD-pi is a disaster.  Sleepiness while on stimulants seems to be (to me) the exact opposite of what one would expect, when what one is looking for is ability to concentrate. The THERAPIST is the one who suggested a possible med trial with a new medication, so there is some disagreement between the therapist and the ADD doctor.  Frustrating, but not all that unusual.  As far as experience goes, most people know that when someone on this site asks for others ""experiences"" they do so with the understanding that everybody reacts differently to these medications.  I've been living this ADD experiene with my son for a decade, so I've got that part pretty much covered.  But, there are trends, such as the trend that people with ADD-pi ""tend"" to do better on Adderall than other medications, or that they ""tend"" to do better on less medication rather than more medication.  THAT is the kind of ""experience"" I am asking about.  I've read the pamphlet about Evekeo, so I already knew the information you were providing.  Thank you for responding, though."
ADHD,3do4vr,roland00,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:24:31 2015 UTC,"No known correlation has been founded that ADHD-Pi do better on Evekeo, Adderall, Vyvanse, or any other ADHD medication.  There are some correlations not for ADHD-Pi but for ADHD+some other disorder like dyslexia, OCD, math learning disabilities etc.  But these ADHD people can be ADHD-PI or ADHD Combined.  The subtype or the presentation does not matter, and even in the coexisting condition we are talking very small differences, like 60 or 80% respond but there is a 20% shift with using a stimulant vs nonstimulant for these specific co-existing conditions are sometimes made worse by stimulants, but even there often by getting the dose correct you can reduce the severity of side effects.  Meds unforutnately are trial and error, but you probably know this from all your years of doing ADHD meds with your son.          I know you said you been on a lot of different ADHD medications over the years, but what meds have you tried?  I am asking for some meds are just different brands of the same active ingredient but different delivery mechanisms with different rates per hour.  Other medications treat ADHD very differently.  For example its an off label ADHD medication but sometimes ADHD people benefit from Modafinil and its cousin Armodafinil which are day time sleepiness medicines that promote wakefulness.  In the US the Modafinil and Armodafinil go by the brand names Provigil and Nuvigil.  But in some people they do not benefit, it is trial and error and I am asking which med have you tried to identify any meds you haven't tried.  But usually the stimulants have the greatest response with ADHD but that is in most ADHD people but not all ADHD people."
ADHD,3do4vr,nerdshark,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:14:07 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah, now I remember your last post. Howdy!   He does receive therapy at the same time.

It's stunning what he can do under pressure, but he cannot self-regulate in order to plan, or be vigilant in doing what it takes to do college classes or probably even hold down a job.   I understand now. The motivation issue is a tough one. Even for those of us who are only ADHD and don't deal with the additional issues your son has, motivation is sometimes tough even with medication. I'm not convinced that switching to another amphetamine would help with this.   The THERAPIST is the one who suggested a possible med trial with a new medication, so there is some disagreement between the therapist and the ADD doctor.   Sorry about that, I think I conflated the two together. Therapists, unlike psychiatrists, are not trained and licensed medical doctors, so they have absolutely no business making recommendations for medication. They should coordinate with your son's psychiatrist so the psychiatrist can make recommendations.  As for feeling tired on his medication: you said he's taking Cymbalta. Excessive fatigue/tiredness is a side effect of it, according to this site. It is probably the Cymbalta making him feel this way, so changing the stimulant your son is taking almost certainly won't make a difference. I'd bring up this fact with the doctor before changing which stimulant your son takes.   As far as experience goes, most people know that when someone on this site asks for others ""experiences"" they do so with the understanding that everybody reacts differently to these medications.   You'd be surprised. We repeat this info a lot because there are many people who don't know that, and assume that most people will experience stimulant medication similarly (kind of how like how opioids have the same general analgesic effects for the vast majority of people)."

ADHD,3do4vr,roland00,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:32:14 2015 UTC,"Hey, sorry for the double-reply, but I just remembered that Strattera (atomoxetine) was originally investigated as an antidepressant, but is now primarily prescribed for ADHD due to its very high efficacy in treating ADHD. If your son is using Cymbalta for depression, then Strattera may very well be a better alternative, because recent research has shown that it is very effective in treating depression that is comorbid with ADHD. If he's taking Cymbalta for anxiety, then guanfacine or clonidine may be better alternatives, because they also treat ADHD (they cover different symptoms than stimulants, so provide greater coverage) and also reduce the negative side effects of stimulants (increased blood pressure and anxiety). I'd bring these up with your son's doctor."

My wife has been trying to help me with these things as much as she possibly can, and i love her dearly for it. It helps, but marginally so.  Because of me, we have calendars all over the house. And on my phone. We started with one on the fridge, but i kept forgetting to look at it. So we added one on my phone. I kept forgetting to check it. We skipped a few steps, and got several calendars and chalk boards and marker boards, amd set them up all around the house; in the bathroom where ill see it when i take a shit (seriously), next to the tv, on the fridge, by the clock on the wall, and on my phone and fridge.  By going all out offensive with calendars and reminders, to the point where its seemingly overboard, i am bound to notice them and remind myself to check it right then and there. I still forget things, but it does help.  Also, sticky notes have proven invaluable. Have a fleeting thought? Jot it down, sticky it somewhere quickly. My office desk at work is literally covered in stickies. I still forget things and procrastinate, but at least i am a functional supervisor.   TL;DR i suggest you purposely go overboard with reminders. Even for little petty things. Become ocd about it, in a way, and eventually it should help to build the habit of having to check something.

This is the brain area that creates many ""feelings of emotion"" it is the area of the brain that connects the frontal lobe to the temporal lobe, and the temporal lobe to the parietal lobe (the sensory lobe).  Many mood disorders and anxiety disorders and autism have disruption of the insula.  Furthermore it is implicated in ADHD as well, but it is not implicated the same way in each ADHD person, thus most people do not talk about it alot with ADHD the insula, for it is not ""universal"" but it is a major factor for it changes how your ADHD manifests, how one person ADHD looks on the outside very differently than another person's ADHD."

ADHD,3dizuh,purple_urkle,2,Fri Jul 17 13:03:54 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for posting this. I've been on Adderall XR for nearly 7 years and I know I struggle with jaw clenching (doesn't help that I have tmj too.)
ADHD,3dizuh,purple_urkle,2,Fri Jul 17 00:14:38 2015 UTC,"I've read that having an uneven bite can be a cause.  The way I understood it was that you subconsciously try to make them meet, the way they should (the same way you can't stop tonguing a chipped/broken tooth).  Long before I was ever medicated (like 10 years before), I had a root canal, but I didn't get the crown because I didn't have the cash.   A few years later, I started noticing that I was clenching my jaw when stressed.   Some 10-12 years later, I was diagnosed and medicated for ADHD, and bruxism became an issue."
ADHD,3dizuh,purple_urkle,2,Fri Jul 17 06:06:16 2015 UTC,"I'm the worst case situation for this. I was under a lot of stress 2 years ago, kept clenching my jaw without realizing it. Broke a porcelain filling in the back. Saved up for 2 years to get it ""fixed"", while hitting the cetylpyridnium chloride mouthwash after every meal and drink that isn't water. Unusually bad dentist decided to use a drill to ""clean"" my teeth. Now the enamel is worn away in right angle patterns and there are little half circles of tooth missing along the gum lines of molars that were 100% not like that before the dentist assaulted me. She refused to fix the tooth I came in to get fixed and she sabotaged all my other teeth. I'm underweight from adhd meds, and I need to gain but having sore teeth just deters me from eating more. If my head is tilted back, the airways to my lungs open up wide. Dentist kept tilting my head back while she was drilling. I tried to tell her she was really hurting me and she kept telling me I just needed to ""hold your breath for 5 minutes"" and I kept saying human beings cannot do that for that long she would need to crouch down or adjust herself but she refused and just kept hurting me. I coughed up little white triangles that were ground off of my battered teeth for weeks after. My gums will never grow back and are receding in a pattern of a straight line where the dentist sheered them off, there's nothing natural about it. Dentist had good yelp reviews, I guess she pays someone to game yelp for her. I think she thought because I'm not ugly and have a white boyfriend that we have money to milk but we don't. Anyone can be randomly an asshole, even dentists. I'm drawing a graphic novel about this because she can't use her yelp monkeys to get rid of it.   The only foods I eat now are non lumpy soups and hot chocolate with real melted chocolate and I brush after every time.   My only consolation is that I live in a very populous city, and it's only a matter of time before that dentist assaults someone who isn't as nice as me and gets what is coming to her. My boyfriend is a chemist and we're trying to figure out how to make a product that will prevent dentists from having the ability to assault people then charge them fix it later. Dentist really fucked with the wrong scientists and artists this time.  Frankly I'm kind of done with teeth, I'm 30 and I just want to knock them all out with a hammer now so it'll never be a problem again. Then I can get vampire fang dentures.   tl;dr take care of your teeth, and watch out for crazy dentists if you have a good dentist, never leave that dentist.   edit: a word"

ADHD,3dizuh,fromtheriver,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:04:46 2015 UTC,That is seriously fucked up. You should look up the licensing authority for dentists in your state and see about filling a complaint.
ADHD,3dizuh,kjarkr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:06:00 2015 UTC,"I'll look into filing that but my number one priority is trying to have fun with my life and my boyfriend and I would rather take down every dentist's ability to harm people this way instead of just taking down the specific dentist that harmed me.   Next dentist appointment, with a different dentist of course, we're taking pictures of my mouth in the waiting room for ""before pictures"" and I've already sent pictures I took of my damaged mouth to the copyright office last week.   We are the worst people she could have possibly chosen to inflict this harm upon. Boyfriend works in formulation specifically on dental products for a boss who said he was also fucked over by a dentist the same way I was in his 20s, we are all pissed."
ADHD,3dizuh,Tdub327,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:57:39 2015 UTC,"The point of filing the complaint isn't so much to take this dentist down, but to create a paper trail. It's unlikely that your state's board of dental examiners will revoke someone's license because of your complaint specifically, but if lots of people are making complaints about the same person and they start to see a pattern, that's a different story. At the very least, if someone ever does decide to sue her, they can request the record of complaints made against her to use as evidence that she's negligent."

ADHD,3dizuh,danaofdoom,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:00:51 2015 UTC,Great post. I just went to the dentist and he told me I was grinding away and my back molars were showing wear. He told me to get a mouth guard to wear when I sleep.  It's funny but I never attributed it to stimulants. I only take 20mg of adderall xr.  I also chew gum a lot. I think it's an anxiety thing. Does that add to teeth wear?
ADHD,3dizuh,PringleMcDingle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:40:23 2015 UTC,I know that gum chewing is off the menu for me while I'm resting my jaw. I'd imagine that if you're doing it every day and really intensely it's probably not great. But ask your dentist.
ADHD,3dizuh,flaillomanz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:24:26 2015 UTC,"Can relate. I have chewed through several nightguards. Apparently chewing gum should also be avoided.

ADHD,3dm4gx,tizzletl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:21:28 2015 UTC,"I have no idea about my blood readings, and definitely not a doctor. What I do know is that Ritalin is actually a pretty safe and well researched drug.   Based on my experience, Ritalin definitely does some abnormal things to my heart rate when it initially kicks in, but it wears off quickly.   My best recommendation would be to wait 2 hours, try some light exercise and then go get your blood pressure/heart rate checked out.   In high school I shot gunned a red bull while on 20 mg and then swam a race. In retrospect, not my brightest move but my heart didn't explode and my doc has never been concerned about my blood pressure."

ADHD,3dm4gx,Centropomus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:54:51 2015 UTC,"Don't wait, but ramp up slowly. If you're out of shape and new to stimulants or on a recently increased dose, a long walk on a hot day can cause problems if you're unlucky. Once you're acclimated to both the stimulant and the exercise, you can do intense workouts with no problem unless you have a heart condition.  Also remember to drink extra water. Simulants are dehydrating, and dehydration can exacerbate the cardiac irritation effect."
ADHD,3dn6kq,kjarkr,2,Fri Jul 17 17:08:30 2015 UTC,"Ritalin IR had only a 1 hour therapeutic window for me, so it's possible you're getting both peaks, overlapped so you don't feel a second one, within the four hours. Not taking my second pill soon enough would give me multiple crashes per day, as well."
ADHD,3dn6kq,schmin,2,Fri Jul 17 18:35:00 2015 UTC,"Hm, yeah that's along the line in thinking. And the crash is shit. :/ so I'm hoping concerta will be a better fit for me."
ADHD,3dn6kq,schmin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:37:24 2015 UTC,"Acid-base balance is a known issue with the amphetamine amine class, not the methylphenidate class.  Acids in black coffee, OJ, fruits, etc. are NOT an issue.  Eat balanced meals and you'll be fine.  The issue arises when a 'meal' consists of JUST black coffee or fruit juice or if someone takes antacids with their amphetamine-class medication -- both will ""lower blood levels and efficacy of amphetamines.""   Gastrointestinal acidifying agents (guanethidine, reserpine, glutamic acid HCl, ascorbic acid, fruit juices, etc.) lower absorption of amphetamines.  Urinary acidifying Agents (ammonium chloride, sodium acid phosphate, etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion.   Both groups of agents lower blood levels and efficacy of amphetamines."
ADHD,3dn6kq,Addbutter,2,Fri Jul 17 18:24:11 2015 UTC,"So if I understand correctly, ascorbic acid in a food or drink taken with( plain old) IR methylphenidate isn't known to cause a problem with absorption."

ADHD,3dn6kq,iSanddbox,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:10:19 2015 UTC,"or if someone takes antacids with their amphetamine-class medication -- both will ""lower blood levels and efficacy of amphetamines.""   What? You're talking about agents that acidify urinary ph, not that basify it. Antacids increase blood levels (and, by extension, efficacy) of amphetamines."
ADHD,3dn6kq,schmin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:39:21 2015 UTC,"There are GI-acidifying and Urinary-acidifying.  These are not the same.  Hmm, I thought I included the link to the reference for this.  =/  (Edit: The link is there, I just missed it because the visited-URL color is almost the same as the black for regular text.  -_-)  EDIT: Click on 'Interactions' tab.  The point being that eating a balanced meal should not interfere with the intended, normal metabolism of the medications.  Efficacy is not merely a measure of concentration, but also of duration.  You might increase the concentration (not necessarily good) but it will also decrease the duration."
ADHD,3dn6kq,schmin,2,Fri Jul 17 20:46:36 2015 UTC,"To clarify my point. The Ritalin ER pills contain little granulates which will dissolve at different times. This ""time"" is controlled by the PH in the gastric system. I'm not talking about the body's rate of absorption, but rather the rate at which the methylphenidate is released from the granulates. So low PH = faster release. But what I'm not sure of is how much faster, and I guess that's what I'm asking.   Also my breakfast is fish oil and a protein shake with lots of oats. So a big chunk of protein. Next food on the list would be 100g of almonds, which is ca 23% protein. And from what I can gather this is pretty much as acidic as my stomach can get. Or rather as protein rich as a breakfast gets I should say.   ""The pH of your stomach varies, from 1-2 up to 4-5. When you eat, the stomach releases proteases and hydrochloric acid to aid in digestion. By itself, the acid doesn't really do much for digestion, but the proteases that cleave proteins work best in an acidic environment or low pH, so after a high-protein meal, your stomach pH may drop to as low as 1 or 2.""   From about.com of all places. But still. http://chemistry.about.com/od/lecturenoteslab1/a/Stomach-Ph.htm  So, any thoughts on this? :)"
ADHD,3dn6kq,schmin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:26:58 2015 UTC,"Hmm, that's not something I've ever seen addressed for methlyphenidate, in that manner, but the myriad of doctors and pharmacists I've asked have all stressed balanced meals, and consistency, that is, eating frequently and enough quantity (and keeping that consistent day-to-day) will give a more reliable medication metabolism.  Also, from what I understand, more protein slows the overall digestion process (as opposed to simple carbs) which would also improve the medication's duration and 'smoothness.'  Trying to potentiate it by altering meals and schedules day-by-day is chasing phantoms and maybe a recipe for disaster, as there are far too many other variables in our lives to control that strictly, especially with ADHD."
ADHD,3dn6kq,schmin,2,Fri Jul 17 22:51:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I do agree with you in that. Also, I'm not  trying to optimize my diet for my medication, but rather figure out why I'm, according to my doctor, showing symptoms of to high a dose when I'm only on 20mg. And I thought maybe the high protein breakfasts were to blame. But in retrospect, if the effect had been that great, then there would probably be a warning somewhere. But I'll be doing 10mg+10mg as of tomorrow, instead of 20mg in one go. Maybe that will help. Who knows, hehe."
ADHD,3dn6kq,iSanddbox,2,Fri Jul 17 23:10:34 2015 UTC,"Individuals vary so much, there's no putting a finger on the 'why' usually.  Like I said, I loathed methylphenidate IR but methylphenidate XR (Concerta) is fine.  Sometimes it's a matter of the release mechanism, or even the binders and fillers used, as I know many people have reported feeling a difference between various generics for amphetamine salts IR, for example.  Good luck!  =)"

ADHD,3dn6kq,iSanddbox,2,Fri Jul 17 23:16:49 2015 UTC,It is typically a much longer journey than doctors tell their patients (or than patients naively hope).  I wish the process length were better discussed.    :)
ADHD,3dn6kq,schmin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:37:44 2015 UTC,"Why would it decrease the duration? It should extend the half-life, not reduce it."
ADHD,3dn6kq,iSanddbox,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:40:01 2015 UTC,Using it and excreting it faster would not extend the duration.
ADHD,3dn6kq,schmin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:45:51 2015 UTC,"From my understanding, the reason blood concentration increases is because if your urinary ph is basic, less of the amphetamine is excreted. Is that wrong? Everything I've read indicates that acidifying urine will lower the half-life and basifying the urine will increase it."
ADHD,3dn6kq,iSanddbox,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:53:56 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, antacids will increase the pH (make it more basic) of your stomach, but that does not mean they will also increase the urinary pH.  This is the primary problem with attempting to alter the pH in your body for 'diet' or medication reasons -- there are many systems that keep their own homeostasis, and back up systems in your body that prevent wild swings.  Increased blood concentration is not the same thing as increased rate of use -- you might be changing the binding coefficients so the medication stays bound to 'carrier' proteins in your blood longer, effectively decreasing the amount available for your brain's use at any one time, even if that might make it 'last' longer throughout the day.  Conversely, if the increased blood concentration does lead to more bio-availability, your body might also metabolize it faster.  There are too many systems and too many inter-dependencies to make hard and fast assumptions.  Anecdotal experience (which comprises much of the internet) could easily be the placebo effect as well."
ADHD,3dm3p0,PajamminJohnson,2,Fri Jul 17 11:18:14 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem, for a while I could not justify nor rationalise paying for something that may or may not help me in the long run. One of the problems with this disorder is that no matter how well we know the importance of something, it's so difficult to put the effort in.   I'm in the same boat as you, 20 years old, was diagnosed with ADHD when I was younger but refused to take any medication and have since been left unmedicated, I developed a lot of anxiety and depression. I had to force myself not to think about the money & effort required to see a therapist and just go, even though i'm unmedicated to this day, I still find that those therapy sessions were helpful in managing my thoughts and being mindful (which is extremely important for us impulsive types). I hear that therapy tends to be more effective whilst on medication aswell. Take it from me, let go of your pride and just go and see a therapist, there are no real drawbacks.

If I do them every day, it takes maybe 5 minutes, mostly to launch the organization web site. Doing them later means I have to track down the information. I usually have a list organized by class period on an index card for each day, which I keep in a special wallet I made out of duct tape, in my hip pocket. The card usually doesn't include shift start and end times, that's from the paper sign-in sheets kept in a binder at work. Doing my timesheets requires both. Which, I guess, is why I have such a hard time getting around to doing them. There is one shared computer at the office, usually somebody else is using it at the end of the day. So I decide I'll do it when I get home - I can remember when I got to work and when I left today. And then something comes up, so I'll do it tomorrow. And now I need the information from the sign-in sheets, because I really can't remember where I was when other than today. I cleverly snap a picture of the timesheet with my phone so I'll have the information.    So, I got an email from the boss a couple of days ago: 12 weeks of timesheets not in yet. (What the hell? I can't be that far behind... tapetty tappety tap... really? God damn it, I suck! No wonder that one time I was my own boss I fired myself.) If they aren't done by close of day Friday (that's today) I'm suspended w/o pay.    Working from home yesterday and today, unexpectedly, so the sign-in sheets are at work. We switched sites 5 weeks ago, the old sign-in sheets are there and no longer available to me at all. Good thing I have them on my phone. OK, some are on dropbox, some are on google drive, some are on my phone in photo form, some are in a mini-scanner pdf form, some I just plain forgot to snap. Also, at the new site, the schedule doesn't fit my index cards, so I haven't got those.    It turns out that google tracks people's movements, and you can look up your own data. Damned creepy, but I used it to complete my timesheets in time. I cross checked on some of the days I had sign-in sheets, and the two methods match.    I am now 100% up to date on time sheets.  Woohoo.    Also, I dusted my bedroom, which really needed it."

All other treatments are basically totally useless without medication or a lot of help. Medication makes non-pharmaceutical treatment far more effective, because enables you to start and, more importantly, continue the treatment process. Besides, what's wrong with depending on medication if it improves your life? If it is helpful and doesn't exacerbate other health issues (like cardiovascular problems), then it makes absolutely zero sense to stop. Before you decide to quit medication, I'd address your reasons for wanting to quit. I really don't want to see you quit medication and end up living an unfulfilling, unnecessarily difficult life."

ADHD,3dlamx,nerdshark,2,Fri Jul 17 22:46:42 2015 UTC,"You're an adult, and as such, they have no right to force you to quit medication, even if you're on their insurance. The decision lies entirely with you. My recommendation is that, for your first big step as an adult, you confront your stepmother. ""Hey, I know you don't like that I take medication for ADHD. It's okay for you to feel that way. However, I have to do what I think is best for myself, so I will continue taking my medication."""

Fear of being able to go back there, and successfully hide again in the hole.

ADHD,3djyzn,K0TT,3,Fri Jul 17 00:15:45 2015 UTC,"A couple of the things you wrote about on here really resonate with me.  Just like you, I have problems with being prideful and feeling that asking for help makes me less of a person. I've never looked down on others for asking for help, in fact from a completely logical standpoint I always knew that people helping each other is required to really accomplish anything great. But just like you, every time I ever need help I feel embarrassed.  That's when my lying started too. I was young when I started to lie habitually, probably 8 or 9. When I was in the 2nd grade my dad made me re-write one of my assignments and told me to apologize to the teacher for its illegibility ( I have severely underdeveloped motor skills). Instead I threw it out and lied about because I was embarrassed that I couldn't do it properly the first time. However, my outlet for embarrassment soon became food.  I've been pretty heavy since I was about 13, always bordering on obese. Then my lies started to be to protect what little self esteem I had left. I lied to myself, told myself that my lack of discipline could not be helped, that I was smart enough to get by winging it anyway. I lied to my parents, told them I was putting a lot of effort into my private school education, both to protect me and them.   Then my fear of asking for helped changed, I became truly afraid of doing my best, and having it not be enough. Consumed completely by self doubt, I pretended that I just didn't give a shit and made it my defining personality trait for about 4 years. Sometimes I even tricked myself into believing it.  That personality went hand in hand with my ADD traits anyway (disorganized, under motivated, undisciplined, impulsive, careless, inattentive, forgetful)  However, thankfully for me I realized something needed to change. I didn't prepare for something and I failed absolutely and completely. After a summer of introspection I realized all these things about myself and started working towards changing them. I started talking to a therapist about my emotional problems with asking for help and I got medicated for my ADD among other things. Now, I'm losing weight, I set attainable goals for myself, and I try to reach them.   Changing the qualities you described in this post will be hard. Change does not come overnight. I can tell you this though, I am so much happier working towards who I want to be, albeit slowly, then I ever was being who I used to be.   I know for me at least starting to try to change was the hardest part. I saw the arduous times ahead and I was scared, but if there is one thing I can't emphasize enough it's that you'll be happier having started changing yourself then you will be wondering if you can ever change.

Texting is enough of an issue on its own.  Edit: Although when I think about it that might be more from my BPD and less from my ADHD.

The primary goal was to let every person I could who knows me in real life know what is going on and how I've felt so that I can never hide in that hole again without someone noticing. I was too good at lying and manipulating people not to tell the brutally honest truth. I actually probably behaved worse than I can convey in words myself, harshest judge or not it really was that bad.  I was somewhere around being able to sell a used car salesman a tesla good at lying to hide the pain and darkness. You can't lie if everyone knows the truth already."

They also said something like 40% of people with the issue would benefit from surgery.  Did he your docs use an endoscopic procedure to look at it?  Did they say why you have breathing problems?"

ADHD,3dku2g,impossible_planet,6,Fri Jul 17 02:11:24 2015 UTC,"I wish I could give an easy answer. For me it has taken time and mindfulness. I used to be able to only talk the talk. ""Why should I get mad at that person? Their perceptions or behavior has no bearing on my happiness."" Easier said than done.   My personal journey has been somewhat informed by a secular Buddhist perspective. Within this philosophy you try to let go of your attachments.  Things aren't inherently 'good' or 'bad'  things. You have attached those labels in your mind. When these things do not align with your labels, you experience pain.   Basically, you've caused your own emotional distress. When I came to this realization boy did it suck major ass. I didn't want to believe it. I fought it. However, it didn't go away. It kept nagging me for deeper thought. Now am I able to be detached from all good or bad outcomes in life? Fuck no, I'm not a monk. But, something I was able to do was, and I'll just put this out there bluntly: Stop giving a fuck about other people's bullshit. Bullshit only has bearing on your life experience if you choose to assign it value.   In reality though, we are perfect strangers on the Internet. So take my thoughts as such. However, from one angry person to another I think you would benefit from reading Buddhism Without Beliefs. It's a short read, and a good intro. It's also not religiously oriented. I just remember reading that book and nodding in agreement. Every page is pure gold. Keep a pencil handy to underlie relevant stuff."
ADHD,3dku2g,twitchmcgee,2,Fri Jul 17 03:09:53 2015 UTC,"Medication helped me with my impulse control. I think more before I talk now though not always.   However, anger is simply an outwards manifestation of one of your land mines being stepped on and there is nothing wrong with feeling it. There is a difference however, between reacting and responding.  Never try to ignore the anger. It simply breeds passive aggressive behaviour or causes a person to explode from pent up emotions.  Trying to simply deal with the anger isn't enough. It's like trying to cool down boiling water with ice when the kettle is still on.   Go through it.  Firstly, you need to figure out why you get angry. Sometimes just going through the process of figuring things out gives you back control over the situation.  For example:   You got your work hours cut for no reason and you are mad.   Why?   You'd get paid less.   Why is that bad?   You'll have less money.   Why is that bad?   Your survival depends on having enough money and people are messing with that.  Basically anger is lashing out from fear. Fight or flight. Now that you have figured out the issue, the next step is to figure out what you can do about it.  Is your survival really in jeopardy or is the issue isn't as bad as it seems?  Are you able to speak with the management?  If yes, would it help?  If no, is there something else you can do?  If there is really nothing you can do about it or when you have done all you can, do you have someone that you can talk to or something you can do that would help?  Of course, this takes practise. Meditation can help speed up the process by sitting down, closing your eyes and thinking through the issue while focusing on deep, relaxing breathes. It brings you back to neutral.  I like to think of life as being stuck in traffic. Like it or not, you are bloody stuck, so why get angry when you can't change jack shit? Might as well calm down and listen to the radio or focus on something more pleasant.   You are simply what you let stay in your head.  Hope that helps ;)"

ADHD,3dku2g,iamnotfurniture,2,Sat Jul 18 03:47:16 2015 UTC,No worries. I know how you feel. Shit happens =/   This takes practise to implement though. Don't wait till you are angry.   I suggest you try to breakdown everyday situations to the root cause to integrate it so that when you feel angry again it'd be easier to go through the process.

One is to generally try and ensure that my life is pleasant and conducive to me having a much longer fuse.  The other thing is to have expectations ahead of time as to what might happen (e.g. I'm going to see the boss to get my schedule, so it's possible that it might be too much or too little or at bad times), and then have some pre-rehearsed responses chosen already so I can come over as a lot calmer.

The first day or two make almost every activity enjoyable and highly motivating.  You'll feel good just taking the trash outside or mowing your lawn.  After a few months though you'll have to motivate yourself to do those things again.  The important thing is to establish routines so that you won't have to exert much effort to motivate yourself to do the necessary but boring activities of life.  Like for instance how most people don't have to work hard to motivate themselves to brush their teeth, because they should have already established the habit as a child so now it doesn't take much effort to continue the habit.  Anytime you introduce a new behavior into your life though, you'll have to struggle to establish it as a habit, like for instance going to the gym."

ADHD,3djn4m,FrogginBullfish_,8,Thu Jul 16 20:24:13 2015 UTC,"I'm really bad about interrupting people. I'm better when I'm medicated, but I still make a conscious effort to not do it.  I told my (now ex) bf I needed to work on it, and I asked him to please give me constructive criticism and point out when I'm doing it. Whenever we were in a group of people, he would just squeeze my hand if I was doing it so I could calm down some and gather my composure."
ADHD,3djn4m,geniequeenie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:39:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm hoping I can increase my Adderall next week, and maybe that will help. And I know it's genetic because my mom is just as bad. Us having a conversation is just ridiculous. And I have such a hard time listening to other people for an extended period of time unless I at least have some sort of activity to preoccupy myself. I have caught myself staring at people and spacing out halfway through whatever they are saying so I just sort of forget they were even talking in the first place and interrupt them with some new unrelated topic."
ADHD,3djn4m,BenevolentBeseecher,5,Thu Jul 16 22:04:54 2015 UTC,"I have half of this problem. Give me the chance to talk, and I will go on forever, often into new topics or bad/boring stories and whatnot. I was not aware I was doing this for the longest time, until the fateful time I actually looked at people as I was speaking. I could see them pulling back, toning me out as I drawled on. That's actually step 1: realization. It's taken me a few years (mostly because I'm not the most social person, so I don't get in too much ""practice""), but as I listen to others talk, I will often think of something I want to say to contribute to the conversation. I IMMEDIATELY follow that thought with a ""is that necessary?"" question. Be truthful to yourself. I often find my own stories entertaining to myself, but will others find it just as entertaining? Is what I'm saying meaningful? What was originally talking about, and is what I'm saying even related to that anymore?  My Dad has ADHD very badly, even though he'll deny it to his death. My Mom often says ""he has no filter"". This resonated a lot with me, so it's what I've put in place. Another good point I can add  is to keep stories short, to the point, and follow with another question to direct the conversation to someone else. It's a lot of work, but in the end it builds better relationships.  So to wrap it up, my advice (which will take time, so don't feel defeated if you catch yourself falling into old habits) is very simply this:   Awareness: Always be aware of yourself when you're talking. DO NOT go into auto-pilot. That is when you'll lose yourself. Necessity: Assess the conversation and have a very truthful mini-peptalk with yourself on whether your addition to the conversation is necessary. To-The-Point: When you find you /do/ have something good to add to the conversation, keep it straightforward and try to follow up with a question to direct the conversation off of you.   That's all I can offer. Practice and patience. Hope that is somewhat helpful."
ADHD,3djn4m,BenevolentBeseecher,2,Thu Jul 16 20:50:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that is helpful. I think I am just so antisocial and awkward that whenever I do get the chance to step past my anxiety and talk I get too excited and go overboard."
ADHD,3djn4m,andale_papasito,2,Thu Jul 16 21:56:10 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, that is a really big thing right there. When I do talk, it's only about things I like, so I tend to get excited and just start word-vomiting all over the place. Sure, kind of sucks that I can't allow myself to get excited, but at least then I feel better when I walk away later knowing I didn't annoy anyone."

ADHD,3djn4m,twitchmcgee,3,Thu Jul 16 22:01:16 2015 UTC,"I struggle with this.  Including interjecting into conversations around me that have nothing to do with me.  It helps me to consider my words an intention and imagine them as a ball and speaking to someone as throwing the ball.  You don't throw a ball at someone who is playing ball with someone else, you don't grab someone else's ball and throw yours at them, you don't bounce a ball off someone else repeatedly without letting them catch it and throw it back. Also the intention bit reminds you that talking has a reason rather than just a word dump.    (I realize this is corny and I am a little embarrassed to share it but it does help me.  I don't always remember but it helps when I do)"
ADHD,3djn4m,-justkeepswimming-,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:52:17 2015 UTC,Yeah that makes sense.
ADHD,3djn4m,DrunkenPadawan,2,Fri Jul 17 17:46:17 2015 UTC,"I think what you're describing is active listening. A quick search reveals several specific things that you can practice:  Active Listening  skillsyouneed.com  Active listening is a skill that can be acquired and developed with practice.  However, active listening can be difficult to master and will, therefore, take time and patience to develop.  'Active listening' means, as its name suggests, actively listening. That is fully concentrating on what is being said rather than just passively ‘hearing’ the message of the speaker.  Active listening involves listening with all senses.  As well as giving full attention to the speaker, it is important that the ‘active listener’ is also ‘seen’ to be listening - otherwise the speaker may conclude that what they are talking about is uninteresting to the listener.  Interest can be conveyed to the speaker by using both verbal and non-verbal messages such as maintaining eye contact, nodding your head and smiling, agreeing by saying ‘Yes’ or simply ‘Mmm hmm’  to encourage them to continue.  By providing this 'feedback' the person speaking will usually feel more at ease and therefore communicate more easily, openly and honestly.  Listening is the most fundamental component of interpersonal communication skills.  Listening is not something that just happens (that is hearing), listening is an active process in which a conscious decision is made to listen to and understand the messages of the speaker.  Listeners should remain neutral and non-judgmental, this means trying not to take sides or form opinions, especially early in the conversation.  Active listening is also about patience - pauses and short periods of silence should be accepted.  Listeners should not be tempted to jump in with questions or comments every time there are a few seconds of silence.  Active listening involves giving the other person time to explore their thoughts and feelings, they should, therefore, be given adequate time for that.  Active listening not only means focusing fully on the speaker but also actively showing verbal and non-verbal signs of listening. Generally speakers want listeners to demonstrate ‘active listening’ by responding appropriately to what they are saying.  Appropriate responses to listening can be both verbal and non-verbal:  Signs of Active Listening  Non-Verbal Signs of Attentive or Active Listening  This is a generic list of non-verbal signs of listening, in other words people who are listening are more likely to display at least some of these signs.  However these signs may not be appropriate in all situations and across all cultures.  Smile  Small smiles can be used to show that the listener is paying attention to what is being said or as a way of agreeing or being happy about the messages being received.  Combined with nods of the head, smiles can be powerful in affirming that messages are being listened to and understood.  Eye Contact  It is normal and usually encouraging for the listener to look at the speaker.   Eye contact can however be intimidating, especially for more shy speakers – gauge how much eye contact is appropriate for any given situation.  Combine eye contact with smiles and other non-verbal messages to encourage the speaker.  Posture  Posture can tell a lot about the sender and receiver in interpersonal interactions.  The attentive listener tends to lean slightly forward or sideways whilst sitting.  Other signs of active listening may include a slight slant of the head or resting the head on one hand.  Mirroring  Automatic reflection/mirroring of any facial expressions used by the speaker can be a sign of attentive listening.  These reflective expressions can help to show sympathy and empathy in more emotional situations.  Attempting to consciously mimic facial expressions (i.e. not automatic reflection of expressions) can be a sign of inattention.  Distraction  The active listener will not be distracted and therefore will refrain from fidgeting, looking at a clock or watch, doodling, playing with their hair or picking their fingernails.  Be aware that:  It is perfectly possible to learn and mimic non-verbal signs of active listening and not actually be listening at all.  It is more difficult to mimic verbal signs of listening and comprehension.  Verbal Signs of Attentive or Active Listening  Positive Reinforcement  Although a strong signal of attentiveness, caution should be used when using positive verbal reinforcement.    Although some positive words of encouragement may be beneficial to the speaker the listener should use them sparingly so as not to distract from what is being said or place unnecessary emphasis on parts of the message.   Casual and frequent use of words and phrases, such as: ‘very good’, ‘yes’ or ‘indeed’ can become irritating to the speaker.   It is usually better to elaborate and explain why you are agreeing with a certain point.  Remembering  The human mind is notoriously bad at remembering details, especially for any length of time.   However, remembering a few key points, or even the name of the speaker, can help to reinforce that the messages sent have been received and understood – i.e. listening has been successful.  Remembering details, ideas and concepts from previous conversations proves that attention was kept and is likely to encourage the speaker to continue.  During longer exchanges it may be appropriate to make very brief notes to act as a memory jog when questioning or clarifying later.  Questioning  The listener can demonstrate that they have been paying attention by asking relevant questions and/or making statements that build or help to clarify what the speaker has said.  By asking relevant questions the listener also helps to reinforce that they have an interest in what the speaker has been saying.  Reflection  Reflecting is closely repeating or paraphrasing what the speaker has said in order to show comprehension.  Reflection is a powerful skill that can reinforce the message of the speaker and demonstrate understanding.  Clarification  Clarifying involves asking questions of the speaker to ensure that the correct message has been received.  Clarification usually involves the use of open questions which enables the speaker to expand on certain points as necessary.  Summarisation  Repeating a summary of what has been said back to the speaker is a technique used by the listener to repeat what has been said in their own words.  Summarising involves taking the main points of the received message and reiterating them in a logical and clear way, giving the speaker chance to correct if necessary."

ADHD,3djzp9,slzpy,2,Thu Jul 16 21:56:40 2015 UTC,"An opposing theory, and one that I attempt to employ most often, is to move your working memory outside of your brain. I prefer to rely heavily on calendars, pocket notebooks, and an app (wunderlist) to manage my day to day stuff I need to remember.   Maybe a good question is what type of things are you trying to remember more effectively?"
ADHD,3djzp9,twitchmcgee,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:00:59 2015 UTC,"This... Everything I touch is organized and has a specific place. Anything I need to remember is written down or transcribed some where else. If there is an important date boom Wunderlist, Google Calendar, evernote and phone alarm will remind me.   Externalize that shit man."
ADHD,3djzp9,Native12666,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:05:08 2015 UTC,"I am still a little lost with using Evernote. Do you use it for just notes or reminders and to do lists as well? Getting better with wunderlist though since the addition of repeating events and notifications. I use pocket for all my articles, recipes, and such.   Interesting that we talk about what tools we use but never really how to use them more effectively."
ADHD,3djzp9,twitchmcgee,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:57:42 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying. To be honest I mention Evernote cause I know it works well for others, but I personally have only played around with it. Why cause Google, alarm, and Wunderlist knock out most my basic needs. Though I do have multiple layers to maintaining my digital organization.    . I treat Google Calendar as my base to define my events and specifically identifiable tasks throughout the entire year, months, and weeks. All birthdays, conventions, showings, games, Meetups, holidays, and buddies weddings go to Google Calendar for synchronization. I'll enter days in mass and establish week/month long routines. That is where I keep my class schedules. Using the color bars to visually see how full my upcoming week/month will be. Can one do that with other programs... Yes. But those other programs aren't google. I often have to work in task groups and google makes amazing FREE software for multi-party editing. . I use Wunderlist for actual lists, goals, keeping track of all my Ideas. The addition of the folders a little while back was a Godsend wasn't it! Example: In my Personal Lists I have Groceries, Bills, and routine creation Betas. In personal projects 7 entries for one project, then work in progress has 56 lol. Some just have some beats. Others have full on people synced with attached pics, documents blah and blah. I treat google as a visual and active representation future time, then treat wunderlist as a quantitative measure of my past and future. Why because it keeps track of my completed tasks in an easy to understand visual way.   . I combine my set time plans and goals look at their common denominators then input those individual tasks or Habits....into HabitRPG to give myself a more fun digital reward system. When I knock out something awesome I also give myself a check on my white board with a couple words describing what it was for. Got 15 checks up there right now. Woot, that's five a month since I last cleared it. . For my bookmarks or online finds I just maintain a well balanced Bookmark folder system for chrome and sync it to my Gmail account. Lol got 14 main folders and most have at least three subtypes with at least two subtype folders within one of the first three. . Hootsuite! Use that to manage all of social media platforms. It is a in browser and mobile social media dashboard. Can keep up with my twitter, facebook, linkedIn and Instagram all in one Chrome Tab   After working in digital media for over a decade now I have learned the importance of data organization, file naming and back ups. So discussing any raw data is just in file systems for me."
ADHD,3djzp9,Native12666,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:08:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'll go through phases. I'll make lots of interesting sounding lists and then I find myself just trying to fill them up to feel productive. Then I'll pair down and be more minimalist. Currently that's where I'm at. Plus one of the ways ADHD fuck me up is that I will create an extensive system for tracking tasks, just so I feel I've accomplished something. I've since learned that I should just do the thing and not put it on a list."
ADHD,3djzp9,twitchmcgee,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:23:20 2015 UTC,"That does happen. My HabitRPG guy dies all the time, because it requires constant usage. Google Calendar and HooteSuite are actually my main squeezes when I think about it."
ADHD,3djzp9,Native12666,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:08:04 2015 UTC,"Problem is there's only so much you can write down. Having a casual conversation with someone who says, ""Oh you know who just had that procedure done? <Blank>! He said if it wasn't for the <blank>, it would have gone terribly.""  2 minutes later, <blank> is gone. But do I stop the conversation with a friend to say, ""Hold on, I want to write this down."" If I did that, I'd be a court reporter writing down a lot of what is being said. I don't think there's really an external tool for that. Not even recording everything, because who has time to live their life twice to make sure they didn't miss anything in the recording?  sigh"
ADHD,3djzp9,LarryFarnsworth,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:21:29 2015 UTC,"Name Tip: Wanna remember someones name ask for their full name pronunciation ask about its origin. Then start verbally repeating it, lower in a non-distracting tone. If they are smart they will immediately understand why you are repeatedly saying it.  If not and they give you a funny look, just say ""Sorry I'm bad with names, the more I repeat your name the more it --A-- Helps --B-- Sticks --C-- becomes an action not just a sound.""  Conversation Tip: Partake in active listening. When discussing with another look at their eyes, follow their hands. Mimic their body language. Respond in more than single words and ask questions things like ""I agree"" ""That is ridiculous"" ""So what happened next?"" Check out best and longest selling help book called ""How to win friends & influence people by Dale Carnegie"" audiobook on youtube  ADHD/SRD Self Regulatory Disorder is time blindness. From what I can tell in your example that is just a regular conversation. You are using Blank as a Person, noun, and what? Is there supposed to be three people in the scene. Larry my man, ""Joe & Jill"" ""Mr. T & Mrs. Tea"" throw me a bone here.  The purpose of constantly writing everything down is to be your external memory of time and progress. People don't expect you to remember everything verbatim, they just expect you to physically act when you are planned or expected to.   To remember that <Person1> had a procedure done, isn't the same as remembering to go visit <Person1> at the hospital, or if you were <person 1's> doctor for procedure your working executive function will regularly remind you to study for the procedure. Your mind is time blind, not information blind.  The reason why ADHD students suffer is because of their failure to complete tasks overtime. Test scores and in class assignments are often the most positive of grades. Essays, book reports and Projects due next week are the bane of our existence. Its not that you can't study, its just that you'll space it out. Or you will start phone goes off now you are on facebook for four hours, you failed to return to the task. That's why spreading out large tasks into smaller chunks overtime is so crucial."
