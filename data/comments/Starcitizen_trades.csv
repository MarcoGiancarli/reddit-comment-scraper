Starcitizen_trades,3e3ojo,ph3l0n,3,Wed Jul 22 00:58:11 2015 UTC,"If the Scythe were not bound, i'd be listing it for $2,000, and not $1,300 to go along with OB + GT perks, and a low Citizen #. ;)  I'm basically charging $1,000 for the Scythe and $300 for OB + GT and all the other bonuses. It really is a steal. :)  The big stores have bumped up their prices and you can't find Scythes on ebay for less than $2K. I'm assuming once the 1.1.5 Live patch drops, demand will soar even higher. I can see $2,500+ Scythes again like the few that sold a while back at that price. ;)"

Starcitizen_trades,3e27kg,Phade0ut,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:23:43 2015 UTC,"What /u/bocyogl is saying is, that you take the melt value (original price) and in this case that would be about $65, then add $75 (so he is saying $140).  Also, something to keep in mind, current list pricing of new packages is $5-15 dollars higher then the original kickstarter packages."

Starcitizen_trades,3e27kg,Derpenwolf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:29:28 2015 UTC,What he's suggesting is that you should try. Although it's likely you'll have to lower it $10-$20.

Starcitizen_trades,3e1l5c,Dayreach,2,Tue Jul 21 13:41:40 2015 UTC,There is no such package.  The reliant was a concept sale and therefore never came with a package.  It's a standalone $50 LTI starter ship.  Edit:  They will be selling them with packages when they are hangar ready (NO LTI).  They may also sell variants at some point also no LTI.

Starcitizen_trades,3e2gjj,Baragoon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:47:00 2015 UTC,They told me that due to the new rule I have to group both of them together in one post.  Blackmarkets are no longer exempt.  So this one has the sales for ships and for accounts while the other sets are WTB and they had to be combined as well because they were for Blackmarket items as well.    Or do I have two separate posts up and don't realize it?  Checking.

Starcitizen_trades,3e2i7f,Fortunate_Soul,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:03:48 2015 UTC,I'm still trying to study the Scythe the way it is configured now.  I know a lot of people are saying that the value is in how rare it is but I'm hoping to get some real combat performance out of it instead of having it sit in a hangar.  Such as being able to take the blade off of it and change out those Size 5s for Size 3 or 4 cannons.  If I can do that and get more maneuverability out of it to me that is a big bonus.
Starcitizen_trades,3e2i7f,Fortunate_Soul,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:37:55 2015 UTC,CIG had to come out and claim it is an average fighter at best to combat the P2W argument. It's intended to be en par with the base hornet according to CR. The Glaive is the equivalent to a Super Hornet (I'm holding out for the Glaive).
Starcitizen_trades,3e2i7f,Fortunate_Soul,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:05:01 2015 UTC,"That is way funny, I was hoping to be able to upgrade from the Scythe to a Glaive.  But I agree with you I think that they did make up the claim that it was just an average fighter.  What average fighter do you know has two powerplants?  One thing is for sure she is underpowered on the main thrusters.  They have more mass than the Hornet yet less thruster performance while at the same time going faster?  That makes no sense to me at all."

Starcitizen_trades,3dubuj,CrashDDL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:44:50 2015 UTC,Was the melt value $800 or the market value $800?
Starcitizen_trades,3dubuj,Liudeus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:02:11 2015 UTC,"It cost me 800$ for the 3 ships I traded for the Scythe... Seller only wanted that much and it wasn't a scam either. It was a Reclaimer LTI, a Orion LTI & a Vanguard LTI... had all 3 in stock, bought them myself from RSI.  And just checked, this was March 1st... so 4 months and change..."
Starcitizen_trades,3dubuj,CrashDDL,2,Mon Jul 20 03:19:25 2015 UTC,"Well then I'm not wrong, because those ships were no longer available so they were worth more than $800.  Also based on the initial prices of those ships, their CIG value (not including markup) was $925.  So, while using Euros to pay less than the actual price of the ships, and not including the market mark up of those ships, you paid less than $1,000.  That doesn't mean the Scythe went for less than $1,000. It means that through some creative purchasing you managed to spend less than $1,000 on one. Had you sold those ships or the person you traded with purchased those ships, the net value would have been over $1000.  But that was still a great deal."

Starcitizen_trades,3dpqin,Mrunited12,5,Sat Jul 18 06:38:14 2015 UTC,"280 AUD ($200 USD now) was possible when the packages were originally sold on the RSI site (or shortly after), and the US/AUD exchange wasn't as awful as it is now.  Since the exchange rate is bad and physical packages are getting rarer and rarer, finding one for $200 USD is very, very unlikely. A quick search of the subreddit finds almost no results for a physical package with Aquila within the last 5 months (outside of blackmarket).  Currently the best way to get a physical Aquila package would be to buy a Physical Andromeda pack for $270-$300 USD (~$370-$400 AUD) and then buy a Aquila upgrade from the RSI store in Euros, which would bring the total to ~$440 AUD."

To everyone else - there are two kinds of limited ships: Time Limited (ie only available during a sale, ie the Blue, MIS, SH, Gladiator, 350R, etc) and Quantity Limited (ie the Phoenix, Idris, etc). Other type of ships are not limited, ie they're on sale all the time. Insurance isn't a part of whether or not something is considered a limited ship.

The F7A Hornet is and it has never been sold to anyone.   The SH is the closest one can get to the military one when comparing purely stats. But it has a second seat and is more massive and thus slightly less agile.  You might be confusing ""military"" with ""militarized"" or ""militia""."

Starcitizen_trades,3dggqs,303i,2,Thu Jul 16 02:10:52 2015 UTC,"As above, sell the giftables: Vanguard will get about $275-300 Hull B is an interesting one, I forget what it was at concept. The 325a is probably only worth $50-60  As for the Account, this is where it gets tricky. Not many want to bite at account sales if they do not include the original email. But at the same time, you have some desirable packages in it (SuperHornet LTI pack, Gladius LTI, Reliant):  The Digital Colonel could maybe get $220-250 The Gladius is one of the best dogfighters, and with LTI. I can't find a standard price for one, but as a guess, probably about $180-200 The Reliants are selling for about $55-60.  The rest of the account you could sell off as RSI credit. You won't get more than 80% melt value.   So in total, it's worth: $460 (LTI Ships) +$155RSI.  Try selling (after selling the giftables) for $550. Do not go under $500"
Starcitizen_trades,3ddwxa,SnakeEyedBlaze,5,Wed Jul 15 14:46:09 2015 UTC,If you start penalizing people for helping others with prices then no one will help anyone under fear of being penalized.  If you don't like people telling others the current market price then make a sticky with all current prices.
Starcitizen_trades,3ddwxa,vampuricknight,2,Wed Jul 15 15:06:27 2015 UTC,"If an evaluation is bad, is that really helping?"
Starcitizen_trades,3ddwxa,NewzyOne,2,Wed Jul 15 15:59:23 2015 UTC,Who decides if an evaluation is bad?... maybe you come to the conclusion based on months or years of frequent selling and this decision happens to not correlate with the general opinion of an items value...  At the end of the day evaluations are opinion based on what the writer thinks an item is worth or has seen what others think its worth... you shouldn't be penalized for giving your opinion when it is asked for. Hence the issue.
Starcitizen_trades,3ddwxa,CrashDDL,2,Thu Jul 16 09:19:03 2015 UTC,So what's the alternative? Post a sticky with constantly updated market averages for all ships including min and max prices?  Sounds like a lot of work.
Starcitizen_trades,3ddwxa,Br0wnH0rn3t,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:53:55 2015 UTC,"The alternative is to allow users to flag prices which they feel are outside of recent market trends. If enough flags (or downvotes) are accrued a moderator will remove them. Again,  no outside censorship would ever apply,  it would only be at the ""bequest"" of the community."
Starcitizen_trades,3ddwxa,CrashDDL,3,Sat Jul 18 01:25:14 2015 UTC,"There is no exact answer to a PriceCheck question. Example: Just because someone keeps posting a Digital Freelancer MIS for 400-450$ every few days, it doesn't mean that is its market price. You might think it is, and I might think it is 300$... both numbers are valid if given context and reasoning.  It is the job of the OP to figure out what to make of the information.  As long as someone doesn't say ""sell at a loss because LTI is crap"", all opinions are valid... You can't enforce that only x,y and z can answer because you think they are the only ones that know the current market price, I think...:)  Edit: Anything not on the point on the other hand should not be there :D"
Starcitizen_trades,3ddwxa,NewzyOne,3,Wed Jul 15 15:10:14 2015 UTC,"But when you see the price and immediately think ""whuuu? "". That's what I'm talking about. The $800 890's, the $70 Digital Scouts, the $4000 Idris M's, the $500 GT OB accounts.  Bad valuations like these lead to a stream of highly priced resales down the line which clog up the sale page.  I'm not advocating that an Iron Fist rule is enacted but if a bad valuation gets reported it may be removed. If someone keeps posting replies which are being reported and removed regularly they will be warned and told not to answer pricecheck threads."
Starcitizen_trades,3ddwxa,SlackerDao,2,Wed Jul 15 15:16:02 2015 UTC,"Sellers using the ""bump"" tag are clogging up the front page imo. I saw one seller have 3 bump posts on the front page yesterday.  As much as I don't like seeing gross overcharging, people should be able to charge what they like. The PC function is typically for new sellers and buyers so I don't know if u can have a PC system but exclude ridiculous advice. I see some and feel like wielding my reality hammer but think fuck it.

Starcitizen_trades,3ddwxa,makute,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:18:29 2015 UTC,"Surely this is where other people posting different opinions and getting upvotes comes into play?  I pretty much always post my opinion. Sometimes is lower than market, sometimes it's higher. But if the seller-to-be posts higher and it doesn't sell, they probably need to use the search box.  There's a problem of people posting a PriceCheck with their main account and then putting up a bogus ""wow that's a rare freelancer, $900!!"" with an alt account, but in general I see people counter-posting a correction.  It's self-regulating: If it's too high, they won't sell; If it's too low, they won't post it. A PriceCheck isn't a quote, it's a request for an opinion imo."
Starcitizen_trades,3ddwxa,fabreeze,3,Fri Jul 17 21:45:24 2015 UTC,"I'm generally one of those people who ignore or skip PC threads. When they first started popping up I tried to weigh in and be helpful, but then two trends started to occur:   I started to get downvoted by newer people who just looked at whatever Kane/Star Hanger price at, and thought I was trying to rob people by posting lower prices. People got really friggin' lazy, and just PC'd everything. Hell - at times I've seen PC's on items that are selling from someone else a few posts below the PC.   I'd be happy to see wildly wrong estimates get removed, but that becomes an incredibly subjective process, and leads to moderators influencing prices. You make assumptions about the average, and trim outlier price estimates. People then start selling in that range, and suddenly, you're effectively setting prices here.  I'd recommend you leave price check responses alone, and only remove obviously inappropriate responses. (Like people climbing on the LTI soapbox.) Stupid prices will get ignored, and the market will handle itself."
Starcitizen_trades,3ddwxa,fabreeze,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:32:36 2015 UTC,"Not mentionning that half of the time, you do not even have a ""thank you"" from the OP, nor a following sale thread."

Starcitizen_trades,3ddwxa,makute,2,Wed Jul 15 14:53:38 2015 UTC,factual reporting of the current market price.    Isn't market price subjective until someone makes a purchase? I'd thought price check was a venue for users to engage is 'price commentary' without disrupting an OP's sales thread.
Starcitizen_trades,3ddwxa,gorg_graggel,2,Wed Jul 15 15:13:11 2015 UTC,I should be more clear in that I am referring to the very obvious outliers. Typically an average can be derived (or is directly provided) but extremely high or low values skew the mean.
Starcitizen_trades,3ddwxa,Baragoon,2,Wed Jul 15 15:18:48 2015 UTC,"That's true, but we can't enforce since its by nature subjective. The price checks themselves are not authoritative, but a solicitation of opinions. My opinion is that the best approach is to defer responsibility to the OP and users to exercise critical thinking to infer on what are outliers to draw their own conclusions.   Its not our place to hold the users hand, or interfere with the market.   EDIT:  Also, outlier prices will be downvoted by the community  EDIT2:  grammar"
Starcitizen_trades,3ddwxa,Baragoon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:27:36 2015 UTC,"If a user chose to report instead of downvote it may have an added effect. The issue we see is a lack of traffic in PC threads and therefore we see a lack of opinions given, many PC threads are given only 1 comment which may or may not be accurate. While I would encourage users to discuss within the PC thread to reach a consensus on average value, this isn't currently happening.   Perhaps the easy availability of the PC flair means users are not looking at past recent sales and using search/filters effectively because it's easier to just post in a PC.  If I recall correctly, we introduced PC flair to assist with difficult to value, large blackmarket accounts which otherwise would have no past trade comparison. Now we see PC's on very common single item ships which have a generally fixed value which are very easy to price without the creation of a PC thread."
Starcitizen_trades,3ddwxa,NewzyOne,2,Wed Jul 15 15:47:36 2015 UTC,"If the PC requester wants pure facts, they can search for the ship and see previous sale prices. Isn't PC meant for pricing discussions and evaluations?  If it's just there for someone to give a definite answer based on previous market values, the poster is better off researching on their own... Anyone can find those prices listed."
Starcitizen_trades,3ddwxa,xNoSkillz,2,Wed Jul 15 15:32:10 2015 UTC,"Anyone can find those prices listed.   The point is that very few users ever use the search option.  And yes, I agree in that users giving poor or clearly biased valuations should be, at least, warned."
Starcitizen_trades,3ddwxa,xNoSkillz,2,Wed Jul 15 15:56:10 2015 UTC,"I agree entirely. PC flair was added to gauge difficult to value items, like rare ships and large locked accounts. While not written in stone, its intention was not to check the value of commonly available items, many of which can be found in stores or on the front page. I wish users selling a single, common ship would take your advice, however they are not. PC flair was added as a last resort once all other avenues failed to provide answers.  There is a growing disdain for PC threads - they are downvoted and often skipped over. While good discussions can occur within, generally that's not happening because users can't be bothered to look at, let alone respond to the flurry of PC threads."
Starcitizen_trades,3ddwxa,xNoSkillz,2,Wed Jul 15 15:57:46 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with the search function or with general ignorance of value lies within the fact that new people, just don't know which ships are considered ""fixed"" value or rare. They haven't been following this community for very long and thus just lack the feeling for that. The search function or asking prices in sell threads doesn't really help in deducting that information, because nobody new can estimate how accurate it is. Or if ships really were sold for the listed price or some discount was haggled in a private convo. For somebody new even a store is no real reference, because there is nothing for a newcomer to judge accuracy of their listings.   I'm rather new and those at least were some problems I had. So I created a PC thread not even knowing it could be considered to be a problematic thing. (Apologies if I asked about ""obvious"" things in there.)  I think before resorting to enacting rules to somehow steer that in whatever direction, a sticky containing all this knowledge might help. If that doesn't help much, start encouraging users to point newcomers in that direction and if that still doesn't help, thinking about influencing the process through rules might be appropriate."
Starcitizen_trades,3ddwxa,Jaggeredx,2,Wed Jul 15 17:06:36 2015 UTC,Also check out this post.   Guy asks how much his stuff is worth Guy sells it without making an actual sale thread or displaying a price.   This is what happens in price check threads and it the main reason they should be outlawed.
Starcitizen_trades,3ddwxa,Baragoon,2,Thu Jul 16 02:39:20 2015 UTC,"Mm hmm. It's a toss up, as we are a free market the onus is on users to enter their wares into the economy at a competitive rate or watch their business stagnate. So do PC posts bypass the laissez-faire nature of this market by having other businesses do their homework for them?  If you want to motion for the removal of PC threads that's totally within your power as a participant here."

Starcitizen_trades,3ddwxa,sodanakin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:34:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you're saying here, but we can't be the authority on how people sell their stuff. I reckon you'd be utterly mad to sell without a public post of some kind, but others can do whatever they want, regardless of the risks and warnings and long documentation on the history of scammers and how they operate."
Starcitizen_trades,3ddwxa,ProcyonV,2,Fri Jul 17 21:51:44 2015 UTC,"Jester, your intentions are good. But I echo what a lot of other people are saying here. Your opinion is your opinion, and while we might share your opinion on certain price checks that are way over or under, it isn't the point. In a free market economy the value of an item is equal to what a buyer is willing to pay. For volume, you have to find the value that yields the number of buyers that you have items in order to get an efficient sale. What you are talking about is a moderated squelching of people's opinions on value in posts specifically asking for opinions. I understand that you want to try to protect traders from too low or too high prices, but in the end we are all in control of our own wallets and items and that is the point of a free market like Reddit. You cite some examples like the $4000 Idris-M. I will counter that logic by saying that if some sold for $4000 then they were worth that, to the buyer. Before the Javelins went on sale, some Idris-M owners found that people were not willing to pay more than 2500-3000 for one and so if they wanted to sell them they had to lower their price. I saw one even sell here for $2000 because the seller wanted to sell quickly to be able to have a chance to purchase a Javelin. Even some items here have to be sold for 85% of purchase price (rsi credit melties) because the market won't even give you $1 for $1. I hope I have adequately illustrated the point that the value of an item is determined by the buyer and seller and it is exactly what a buyer is willing to spend regardless of original price or cost to produce. So I definitely do not think the price checks should be moderated more heavily than standard threads. Keep the scams out and keep the comments clean, but leave the price suggestions alone and let the seller determine what is fair based on the suggestions.

Starcitizen_trades,3de7se,fabreeze,2,Wed Jul 15 16:07:14 2015 UTC,How do you feel about reddit.com's new policy update?  How about sctrades; are we doing a good job at moderation in protecting free speech?  Do you believe a free market and free speech go hand-in-hand or are separate topics that exist independently of each other?    Some prompts that come to mind. Please discuss    edit: grammar
Starcitizen_trades,3de7se,SlackerDao,6,Wed Jul 15 16:15:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think ""free speech"" and ""free markets"" are necessarily interrelated.   SCTrades is as much a community as it is a marketplace, and peoples' actions here impact the community as a whole. So allowing unfettered ""free speech"" would - in fact - be deleterious to the community and impact the market's health.  What if someone started selling products and used racist or offensive words in the selling title? ""Connie LTI $350; No Jews or Fags, plz"". Would we - as a community (not merely a ""market"") want that sort of thing perpetuated here?   I sure as hell wouldn't. I'd want that asshole banned from here in a hot minute. But in a purely free market economy with total free speech you'd let that person continue to post, and allow market forces to sort him out. (People not buying the products, downvoting the individual, etc.)  I think free speech is all well and good in the public medium, but this isn't a public place - it's effectively a place of business. And in a place of business you enact policies to support that business which can and will trump ""free speech"" rights.  And to your second bullet point: I think y'all are doing a lovely job keeping this place friendly and supportive to all sellers. (Although I still disagree with the required tag for selling...)"
Starcitizen_trades,3de7se,Akkychan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:50:26 2015 UTC,"Luckily for this sub, we're mostly like-minded and decent people who have one goal: Free-market trading of StarCitizen commodities. Anything outside that scope (racism, sexism, flaming, badmannering) doesn't occur here all that often, and is normally corrected by the community and mods swiftly.  Free speech is important and should be respected, but not when it brings harm to another user or the community as a whole. That being said: Keep it simple. If it's irrelevant or harmful to the community, it doesn't really have a place here."

Starcitizen_trades,3d81o2,justo316,2,Tue Jul 14 06:06:56 2015 UTC,If I were you I would take my flair off. Additionally I also vouch for Baragoon as your middle man. If you made any purchases prior to Nov 26 2012 then you are an Original Backer which makes your account more desirable. Original email is not all that necessary to provide to the buyer as long as you yourself change the email on the account prior to the sale. Good Luck!
Starcitizen_trades,3d81o2,The-Juiceman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:57:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I hid the flair. I dunno if I can remove it completely just yet. I was following some faq and it said to do that, and then later I came across another faq that said don't :/  My purchase was not made when I created my account. I created it ages ago which gave me the low citizen number, but I didn't buy any ships til later. And then, I did something which got rid of the ships I had and traded it in for a redeemer when it came out."
Starcitizen_trades,3d81o2,The-Juiceman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:17:54 2015 UTC,"Ok so you need to see what date you originally backed to find the status of the account. Check to see if you have the original or veteran backers award. If you do then you are a veteran backer, if not then a regular backer. Good Luck"
Starcitizen_trades,3d81o2,Paradox3713,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:26:40 2015 UTC,"Actually when you are telling /u/justo316 that the Original Backer account is more desirable, in what way exactly?  If the account is a Golden Ticket yes it is desirable otherwise it is the ship in the account that add the value and currently only if the ship is giftable.  Without the Gold Ticket or a giftable LTI ship the account will have its issues on being sold. You're basically looking at an account that may got for stock price or it may go for lower since so many people seem to dislike the Redeemer for stupid reasons."

In any case you need to write a statement indicating that you willingly renounce any claim of ownership of the account, and that you will not attempt to recover it for yourself under any circumstance. Using the services of a trusted middleman such as Baragoon makes things safer."
Starcitizen_trades,3d81o2,Jaggeredx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:12:09 2015 UTC,What does it mean if I can't give up my email address (it's my primary)?
Starcitizen_trades,3d81o2,NewzyOne,2,Tue Jul 14 06:50:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's mostly paranoia; in the case of an account claim back CIG will look at the email that ORIGINALLY registered the account. If people don't have possession of that ""original email,"" they think a scammer is more likely to get the account back later on by showing CIG ""proof"" that they have the original email still and so on.  It's largely irrelevant though; write up a detailed invoice stating all terms, and send the buyer an email from the ORIGINAL email attached to your account with the same relinquishing terms, and you should be good.  CIG won't give back accounts to sellers if buyers have proof (archived PayPal invoices, screenshots of the Reddit sale thread and PMs, etc). At worst, the account will be locked and given to neither seller nor buyer, but again...if buyers have proof, CIG will more than likely hand the account to the rightful owner as they see fit based on evidence presented.  Using a middleman can also be an added safeguard for certain high value transactions. PayPal too also covers ""digital goods"" for buyers, so there's protection there.  The thing people forget about ""original emails"" is that...if you're a BUYER, how do you REALLY know you're getting an original email? Sellers could have a bunch of old emails that they've had for years, switch the RSI email to it and give you that email instead....and you wouldn't really be able to prove that what you have is the ""original email.""  Stick with a detailed invoice that you and a buyer agree upon, state all relevant information from Reddit, etc., in it, and you're good to go. Both buyers and sellers have zero to worry about with good record keeping, and use a middleman if someone wants an added layer of protection.  People could just as easily try to yank gifted ships out of accounts just as much as they would accounts, so everyone needs to have common sense and protect themselves and keep meticulous records of trades here. :)"

Starcitizen_trades,3d42w3,excelphysicslab,2,Mon Jul 13 10:38:02 2015 UTC,"I don't particularly like the idea of achievement levels. Sorry Ego. :(  My fear is that it'll make sc_trades somewhat elitist, and lock out newcomers to the market unless they sell significantly under average... okay fine, that's how we all start anyway, but it feels like it'll be more of an uphill battle if old traders are throwing around their flashy flair and matching the newby prices.  Plus, going off the Confirmed Trades threads is a little too fuzzy. I've done many trades for not having a shop (30ish trades so far) but only about 3 of them are +verified on the trades thread. So regardless of how many I can sell, it's totally dependent on the buyer's motivation to go the extra step. Many trades are with brand new accounts too, ie throwaway accounts, and once the trade is over they never log in again so they'll never see the +trade mention in Confirmed Trades.  The idea of personalised flair? Love it. Friendly, Helpful, Expert, etc.. would be v cool."

Starcitizen_trades,3d42w3,Combat_Wombatz,-1,Mon Jul 13 15:32:30 2015 UTC,"Before we get ""achievement"" flairs, I'd like to see a flair to tag those of us who were trading here before this nonsensical ""RSI verified"" system became the norm. There are plenty of people who have been trading here since 2013 but are shunned because they don't want to ascribe to a system that provides no real additional security for buyers or sellers, just feel-good smoke and mirrors.  Give us a flair for that, then we can talk about adding these."
Starcitizen_trades,3d42w3,jester86,2,Mon Jul 13 12:03:38 2015 UTC,"The ""nonsensical"" verified flair provides additional information for the buyer and/or seller.

I have never seen an older trader without flair shunned as a result of not having flair and I would assume the board would quickly rise to someone's defense in that case."

Starcitizen_trades,3d10ll,LTDjesse,2,Sun Jul 12 16:59:04 2015 UTC,"~$40 USD.  There are a few sellers with Anniversary LX standalones selling @ $33, with the packages @ $38-40.  Also, the big stores carry AMD Mustang Omega packages for $40-45 which, while not having 2 year insurance, are a lot more popular than Anniversary packages because they inherently carry a higher ""RSI value"" which people use to CCU to other ships for much cheaper.  When something isn't LTI people generally tend to go with ship hull values instead; 2 years is nice, but not many will pay more to get it over something with only 3 to 6 months of insurance.  The value of these Anniversary packages are likely to not increase much as we've got the next Anniversary sale in just a few months, and i'd imagine we'll get 2YI again on some packages. You also have to keep in mind that the Reliant sale has a lot of people holding $50 CCU tokens as well, making it pointless to buy into 2YI packages for the express purpose of CCU'ing."

The upgrade itself has a $55 melt value, so after PayPal fees you're not likely to find a seller willing to make only a ~$6-7 profit off of one for your asking price of $65. The big stores have had a going rate of $100-120, so it's best to wait another month unless you absolutely need one right now, and you'll save $10 bucks in the process. :)"

Starcitizen_trades,3cyz5u,spacerat8,2,Sun Jul 12 01:38:09 2015 UTC,"Hey there, as BH said, ED accounts that are traded get banned pretty often. It's not like SC where we have a vast gray market and can ""essentially"" trade anything we want. ED is account-based and anything you have is tied to that account, be it in-game ships or backer rewards. Frontier (ED devs) are also EU based, and EU seems to take digital content / accounts and policies tied to them more serious than the US does.  Also, sales like this aren't typically accepted here from what I've seen, since this sub is meant for SC trading and not ED / other games, unless you're willing to trade using SC currencies or SC merchandise/products..just a headsup :)"

There is a risk for a traded account to be banned, same as for SC, but it's not often..even pretty rare, and usually when something went wrong.  Sales like this are accepted around here, provided you propose RSI or SC related stuff as part of the payment.  Last thing, EU court ruled that account trading IS authorized, something which is by far not common in the rest of the world, even if TOS say the opposite.  http://www.pcgamer.com/european-court-of-justice-rules-on-the-right-to-sell-your-digital-games-and-licenses/"

Starcitizen_trades,3cu6fa,jcde7ago,0,Fri Jul 10 20:34:07 2015 UTC,"Actually, I feel that the Gemini is a horrible example of a ""divergent LTI sale.""  Ben mentioned it was considered by CIG to be an almost entirely different ship from the base Starfarer, so when it was sold, it was basically its own Concept sale.     the Starfarer Gemini is significantly 'better' in several ways than the standard Starfarer (there are some tradeoffs, especially in core carrying capacity... but there are enough areas where it's different that people will immediately think it's better.) It's also a ship constructed from the ground up for this purpose rather than modified from an existing chassis. With those things in mind, it seems unfair to only allow early backers to have an LTI version. (Similarly, the folks who are most likely to buy it are the ones who have been collecting lots of ships from the start... and they'll probably also be the ones who want both rather than be forced to upgrade.)    Ben   Not the best reason ever, but unless the Vanguard or Avenger variants come out for sale and THOSE have LTI, then i'm inclined to take Ben at his word....for now. :P  Also, they did mention elsewhere that one can't upgrade to a Gemini or ""downgrade"" to a base Starfarer in the PU, lending more credence to the idea that they see those two ships as their own, very unique hulls."
Starcitizen_trades,3cu6fa,NewzyOne,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:36:35 2015 UTC,"You can't ""upgrade"" to or ""downgrade"" from most variants. Ever since the Freelancer variants, most have been hull-locked variants with significant differences between them (Like the Phoenix's halved cargo space and lost missile hardpoint, but added point defense, armor, power, and decor).  Just because in lore the Gemini is ""finished"" at a different company doesn't make it any more unique than the other hull locked variants which weren't sold with LTI.  But the point isn't to argue whether the Gemini LTI sale was ""right,"" I'm saying that the Gemini sale did not follow the established rules of LTI sales (that variant sales don't have LTI), so you can't trust those rules to remain the same."

This isn't a market where most sales happen in 10 minutes, it's one where, unless you offer an unbelievably low price, finding a customer can take days and making the sale can take hours. The answer to wanting to quickly change the price of something that's ""taking to long to sell because it has only been less than a day since it was posted"" is changing the price in the post. No repost necessary.  Encouraging people to spam is going to destroy the front page because no, filters are not a viable replacement. If they were, the bump tag wouldn't even exist.    Many times I have seen someone with a WTB post looking for a ship, I've posted a link to the ship filter that they need, and they've thanked me for it because they don't know about/how to use filters. This market isn't only people who have been here for months, new users often won't know how to use things like filters.  There's a reason almost all of my sales happen within 24 hours of bumping my sale page and almost none happen after that. Because no one uses filters, they use the front page or the new page.    And spamming those with 10 WTS posts from each trader is going to wreck the front page, making all sales go to (s)he who spams hardest.  The only hope would be that sellers have too much integrity to spam or buyers find it too distasteful and downvote it away from the front page."

Wouldn't it be to everyone's benefit for the type of bartering that goes on via PM to be built into the system? Its time-consuming to do this on a one-by-one basis.   Additionally, although we are describing multiple listings as 'spam', that format of organization does impart new information that is queryable.  Imagine being able to just put your price range in a search box which simply returns listing results, instead of manually browsing through pages and pages of WTS and contacting each merchant individually."

Yes, I know you're saying that quick reposts are only for different items, but that may not be adhered to by newer posters. Thus, up goes your workload.  Also, remember that when you include the price in the title, it can't be modified. So if someone else posts just after you with a lower price, but you're happy to go lower still, you have to repost a new thread with a new price... and close the old one... and ppl aren't overly great at closing old posts.  On the topic of closing old posts (which is off this topic), we used to be able to do a search for Author:[myname] and sort by new and close old posts from there, however now there's no Close link in search results, meaning you have to bring each post up in a new tab and close them individually.

I argue that it is and based on the voting patterns it appears to mean a lot to people with a very heavy financial interest in trading.

But then why have store posts in the first place if the rules allow someone with a lot of items to post them seperately? And if these rule proposals are to go ahead then someone could quite easily flood the front page and keep their items there indefinitely which the community spoke up and said they did nto want to see.    Maybe you could offer some insight as to how you mods will be monitoring such things like stock levels if sellers can repost every time they sell an item. Beats me why they cannot put their stock level in the body of their post and edit it at will (which is what happens now).  The same can be said for asking price.

That's really exaggerating and sensationalizing their proposed system.   Each ship type will be classified under Small, Medium, Heavy and Capital. Those are your ""Types"" or ""Classes,"" or whatever they end up calling them.  In your example a Hornet being a single-seater falls under the ""Small"" class of components. Therefore, it will STILL be limited to ""Small-class"" components. It just means that you get more options on stacking things to add up to the max size limit for ""Small-class"" ships. That's it. It allows us to tailor different components for specific needs.  It does not mean that you can stack multiple ""Small-class components"" past the max limit for that Class size and reach Capital-class components on smaller ship types.  It means that instead of one ""Small-class Shield"" meant to have 100% additional resistance to, say, splash damage for instance, you might be able to stack TWO smaller shields, still adding up to the max limit of a ""Small-class Shield,"" but instead you get 50% splash damage reduction and 50% direct damage reduction.   It's just more customization options and honestly, the system as it sounds seems pretty standard and nothing extraordinary. It's just much, much better than having a ""one slot, one function"" that they were going to do previously.  TL;DR; it's no more confusing or requiring more management than before. It just gives people more options, which is a good thing."
Starcitizen_trades,3cqj99,jcde7ago,0,Fri Jul 10 00:04:00 2015 UTC,"I don't at all see how a more granular customization system turns fighters into ""micro-capships in need of serious amounts of management."" That's really exaggerating and sensationalizing their proposed system.    Actually it is not exaggerating and sensationalizing at all, it is pointing out how dumb and unnecessary such a setup is.  A fighter is for either intercepting and destroying enemy fighters, or for attacking larger ships if loadout to do so.  You don't need complex granular customization on a fighter.    In your example a Hornet being a single-seater falls under the ""Small"" class of components. Therefore, it will STILL be limited to ""Small-class"" components. It just means that you get more options on stacking things to add up to the max size limit for ""Small-class"" ships. That's it. It allows us to tailor different components for specific needs.   It does not mean that you can stack multiple ""Small-class components"" past the max limit for that Class size and reach Capital-class components on smaller ship types.

And I need to mix and match shield types why again?  Why don't shields reduce the damage of both blast damage and direct damage?  Next we will have shields that protect against ballsitics as well.  Why CIG are creating without reason is a system similar to Mechwarrior where we have standard armor, reflective armor, and reactive armor.  I get that the masses are used to these types of systems from all the games they have played or continur to play prior to SC but why is it necessary for SC?     It's just more customization options and honestly, the system as it sounds seems pretty standard and nothing extraordinary. It's just much, much better than having a ""one slot, one function"" that they were going to do previously.   There is such a thing as too much customization without reason.  Standard isn't what I would call where they are going, more of the same ol' same 'ol just to fake depth is what I call it.  It's needlessly gamey.  For a small fighter type ship what makes sense customization wise is a simple Main Thrusters, Avionics/Sensors, Maneuvering Thrusters, Powerplants, Shields, Weapons, Mounts/Pylons, Armor system.  Customization should be based on the different performance levels, quality, and which companies make them.  But being able to cram a number of items into a certain slot if the items are way smaller than the slots's size is truly Mechwarrior/BattleTech in design.   _ Basically CIG are turning fighters into Omnimechs."

I kinda got stuck on the comment ""hornet...multiple powerplants"" and had a big smile on my face until it finished. Don't forget that the different manufacturers' products will all perform differently within any particular class, much like how a size 3 ballistic cannon has a lot of variety. I think their proposal is smart and efficient design.   I'm very much against overly complex systems because the game is already highly ambitious and makes me a bit uneasy. I can see a lot of unhappy customers down the track complaining about framerate issues, bottle-necking, etc etc. I just want a game I can play competitively and so far, they haven't delivered that."

Instead of buying an expensive size 5 shield, you can buy 2 expensive size 1 shields for splash/missile damage, 2 expensive size 1 shields for direct damage, and 1 normal boring size 1 middle of the road shield. Seems fine to me.  Slightly off topic, if everyone now has redundant shields.. what's so special about the Vanguard?"
Starcitizen_trades,3cqj99,NewzyOne,3,Fri Jul 10 01:04:13 2015 UTC,"From what's been said in this post, 4 items of a specific size can be replaced with 1 of a larger size.  So in the case of a Size 5 shield you can have 5x Small shields as you suggest or 1x Medium Shield 1x Small shield.  The reason you might want to give up the granularity and  redundancy is because the protection generated by a Medium shield is greater than protection of 4 equivalent Small shields.  As for the Vanguard (and presumably the Genesis), the idea there seems to be to put distance between blocks of components (ie have multiple physically separated banks of Generators or Shields) so that damage to one area of the ship can't knock out all of a system and so similarly an exploding powerplant won't take all the others with it. https://forums.robertsspaceindustries.com/discussion/comment/5287312/#Comment_5287312"

Just putting this here, it's a copy paste of Matt Sherman's statement about the Vanguard:   Regarding the Vanguard and general redundancy setups - The split-block idea is what we're looking towards for this. Even with the multi-components, having them all in the same space will still have risk. A power plant could fail and just stop working, or something could happen and it explodes. In the case of the latter, you'd be risking some damage to the nearby components, where any ship built with redundancy would have discrete sections for these components so one block could fail completely and the other is still online.  Also, the Vanguard does have 2 powerplants. It was initially concepted while this system was still early on, and the size 2 listed on the ship specs page is incorrect. Right now, it's planned a a 2x Medium Power Plant ship.  Regarding using limited numbers of components - We want this to be possible, though not sure if it'll ripple out to every ship. You'd still be dealing with a power-up time on any deactivated components, and a shield would start charging from 0 shielding and not full health.   .. forgive me for saying, but I believe the Vanguard just got more awesome."

In the case of these new setups you should ask yourself why it is that I would need so many powerplants or shields based on size.  An F-16 has its main powerplant, and it also has one APU that goes into action either manually or automatically in the event of a loss of main power and the hydraulic control system.  So why the need to be able to put more than one system based on size and how would that look if instead of using 1x medium powerplant I'm using 2x or 3x small powerplants?  Am I going to walk up to a panel on the ship, open it up and see 2 or 3 little powerplant systems?  Or is it just going to be assumed that they are there (Magic)?    Gamey in the sense that now I get to play around with my powerplant systems if there are issues when logically I wouldn't even deal with something like that unless the auto system was damaged in combat. Or in looking at what you said about the shields.  Why would you do that whole setup, let alone have it as an option?  Are we flying fighters or is this some weird sort of 3D Space Invaders game where we are just stacking all these different layers of protection?  I doesn't sound ike shielding at that point but just more armor.  Also you bring up a good point about the shields which is what I was questioning about the Hornet.  It seems that now they are all equal powerplant wise.  Now if you have the standard Hornet it seems like you can build a Super only without the second seat."

In essence it's a system that provides the flexibility the game needs but I agree would make little sense in the real world.

Starcitizen_trades,3ck9po,Paradox3713,7,Wed Jul 8 15:53:27 2015 UTC,"In every MMO, the value of rare or high end items drops pretty steadily and quickly. The exception being items unobtainable in the game.   This is simply because as more people play, supply of these items increases. Better items are released to give players new goals, so these old items are no longer as good as they once were and further devalue.   The other main consideration is whether the base ship hulls, or the equipment in the ship will be the main method of progression. I can easily foresee the cost of the weapons, shields, equipment, etc  end up being many times the value of a base hull due to three main factors:   Past CR games have followed this model of cheap hulls, expensive upgrades.  Easier to develop new content. It's much easier for CIG to create newer better equipment items than new ships, especially once ships sales for money stop post game release. So while everyone will have similar base hulls, the weapons and upgrades will be what sets everyone apart. A MMO analogy would be like a base hull determining your class and the upgrades/weapons being your equipment.  Current prices in the pledge and UEC store. While the final economic model isn't determined yet, CIG currently has the cost of weapons/shields as a significant portion of base hulls prices. Since they've already sold these items, it does give a good indication of at least the intent of their final prices, even if the exact numbers may change.    Given the above, if SC turns out to be a hit, base hull prices will likely spike in the beginning due to high demand from players getting into the game, and then steadily decrease as supply meets demand.   Depending on the implementation of LTI in game (unique logo, text, etc) there might be a demand for these ships as collectors items and value may slowly increase over time if the game remains popular."
Starcitizen_trades,3ck9po,banthracis,2,Wed Jul 8 16:26:26 2015 UTC,"I really like about your insightful opinion that you take into account the dynamics before, during and after launch as even CIG themselves cannot fully guarantee whether we will face inflation or deflation.   Knowing the general risk for inflation from other MMO they have put so many money sinks into the game, which they can and will adjust as needed, it could be that from day 1 (a time when definately not too many gold farmers will be there) the UEC value increases (i.e. deflation) and inversely ship&items decrease until the money flow is balanced according to their intention.  In relation to what OP implied: an LTI value per se is getting less and less meaningful as we see despite CCUs still for >6 months Auroras keep floating at ~100, while new LTI ""tokens"" e.g. Reliant/Hull-A are at or below cost."
Starcitizen_trades,3ck9po,FlyingCondor,3,Wed Jul 8 18:50:41 2015 UTC,"This is a fundamental issue with SC that CIG has not done much indepth study on. Once the PU releases people will be able to earn UEC with which they can buy ships with. Now the tricky part comes down to how much will the ships cost relative to the time it takes to make the UEC to buy it. If you can earn UEC quickly then your hourly earnings in terms of real currency would be too high. Take a $100 Cutlass Black for example, if a player earns $2 USD/hour worth of credits then it would take 50 hours to buy a Cutlass Black. That's a pretty steep amount of playtime for an low tier ship. If you value the Cutlass Black at $300 then a player would need to farm 150 hours of credits in order to buy this ship. You need to first ask yourself does that seem reasonable.  Even if for whatever reason that proposition seems reasonable to you, CR has also stated that it should only take a week or so to earn enough credits for a constellation. if an active player plays 10 hours of SC each day or 70 hours in a week and we factor in the cheapest constellation at 300% pledge value of $450 then a player would have to be earning $6.40 per hour playing SC. That's not bad considering it's just a little under the U.S. Minimal wage. This is obviously unsustainable considering that most gold farmed games make a fraction of that hourly ROI.  It's obvious here that something has to give, a high hourly wage to compensate for very expensive ships is simply unsustainable. On the other hand, building a game where a player needs to play hundreds of hours to purchase the most basic hulls is just not fun.  This means, in order to make a game where you can achieve meaningful progress without an unsustainable RWT economy ship costs may have to be lower than the pledge price currently offered by CIG. This may be unappealing to Backers but it's a necessary adjustment in order to create a game that normal users can enjoy.  My conclusion is that ships will become cheaper once the PU hits."

Starcitizen_trades,3ck9po,malogos,3,Thu Jul 9 02:46:30 2015 UTC,"They'll go down because: 1) Ships will be easy to earn (supposedly 60 hours for a $225 Constellation). 2) LTI insurance will only be a collector's thing. 3) Most items will lose their ""limited"" status since they'll all be available in game. 4) CIG may crack down on the market turning it into a black market (higher risk = lower values) 5) The number of sellers will likely expand significantly while the buyers will only expand as the backer number grows. (Sellers now require money to spend on ships themselves. In the future, sellers can just spend time earning the ship. Buyers will always need cash.)  Your ""speculative pricing"" isn't even well speculated. The Vanguard will be sold again. The Vanguard will eventually have CCUs. There are many LTI ships which can be easily CCUed into a Vanguard as well as some future concept ships which will probably be able to. Almost all ships have crashed in value after the new wave of LTI, very few can still easily manage a $100+ markup (especially very few of the latest wave). Costing a few times as much as it does now IN UEC is not the same as being worth a few times as much as it is now IN USD. We don't know how long earning UEC will take.  Ultimately buyers don't care about what absurdly over valued price you ""speculate"" your ships at. They care that there are tens of sellers offering $130 cheaper, and IF the price ever goes up to $430, it won't be for months."
Starcitizen_trades,3ck9po,Liudeus,6,Wed Jul 8 16:13:29 2015 UTC,"That 60 hour thing has been retracted. CIG doesn't even know how long it will take to earn stuff and has said as much.   Limited ships are still limited in game - that's why they're limited during sales.   CIG will have even less control once we can just hand ships over in game (like you can't gift ships that you bought with store credit, but you can certainly sell them in game)."
Starcitizen_trades,3ck9po,Liudeus,3,Wed Jul 8 16:46:29 2015 UTC,"ALL ships are limited in game. They're all limited by their manufacture rate.  It's true that ""limited"" ships like the 890 Jump and Constellation Phoenix will be manufactured in significantly smaller number than something like an Aurora, but ALL ships will have their manufactures rates, there won't just be two (one for non limited ships, one for limited ships)  Some ""limited"" ships may even be manufactured in greater numbers than permanent sale ships (stuff like the limited sale Hull A, a common, small trade ship, verses the permanent sale Redeemer, a military gunship)."
Starcitizen_trades,3ck9po,jester86,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:32:23 2015 UTC,They couldn't just assign someone to research and figure it out?  Maybe they should have requested a stretchgoal for it?
Starcitizen_trades,3ck9po,NewzyOne,2,Wed Jul 8 17:30:26 2015 UTC,"No, it would take longer and be less accurate to ""research"" UEC rate and prices than it would to just build the economy.  They will have the economy system running on its own isolated server (they might even be running it now) to work out flaws in the program and balance costs. (It's built to work without players.)"
Starcitizen_trades,3ck9po,kimawho,3,Wed Jul 8 21:28:55 2015 UTC,"Ship values will drop to maybe 50% (or less) of pledge value. As soon as gold farmers start up the economy will go way, way down. Listing at markup is a bubble and it will only last so long. If I can get a Connie for $50 I'm not paying $350 for one with LTI."
Starcitizen_trades,3ck9po,MisterBurkes,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:13:52 2015 UTC,I really hope they work out a way to curb gold farmers.
Starcitizen_trades,3ck9po,worldspawn00,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:15:19 2015 UTC,"in my thought, NPC's role in economy would be some KEY.  in most past games, NPCs are just a market, who has unlimited money and stock, and they never do some economic activity like mining, trading etc.  But in SC, NPC who participate in economy will be 9 times more than player, ALWAYS. So when player find some blue-ocean than NPC also will do that and it turns red-ocean eventually.(and pirates will focus on that too)"
Starcitizen_trades,3ck9po,Br0wnH0rn3t,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:10:38 2015 UTC,"Based on my experience playing other space sims (especially EVE & private server Freelancer), ships that are obtainable in ""safe zones"" will definitely deflate in value unless they have ""limited"" status. This is simply because they are easily purchasable at little to no risk, which means they can be farmed. (so probably Auroras, Mustangs, Reliants, 300 series, Avengers, Freelancers, Connies, Hulls, etc.)  Ships tied to factions will also deflate, but at a lesser rate, because their availability will be slightly lower since it will be impossible to join every faction and not every player will invest the time into ranking up in each faction (expect some grind for the military factions) to unlock ship purchases. (Hornets, Cutlass, Gladiator, Gladius, Redeemer, larger Capital ships, etc)  Ships uniquely tied to monopolized zones / unsafe PvE zones / pirate-controlled zones will hold their value or can even potentially increase in value simply due to their inaccessibility and the fact that whichever organization controls that location can heavily influence the price. (non-import alien ships + any ""limited"" ship -> even if they are in-game, think of it as only one station/factory actually manufacturing and producing that line, so whoever controls that station = profit)."
Starcitizen_trades,3ck9po,worldspawn00,2,Wed Jul 8 21:32:00 2015 UTC,"because of how instancing is likely to work, there will be no 'control' of zones by any player factions, just NPC factions."
Starcitizen_trades,3ck9po,ProcyonV,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:42:58 2015 UTC,"I think CR hasn't really thought it through. He once said an Aurora might cost $75,000 UEC, but in today's money that's $75 USD to buy an Aurora outright ($1 = 1,000 UEC). That's $750 USD for a Vanguard (200% more).  In my view (if they're smart), they won't raise the price more than 25-50% otherwise, people just won't buy UEC and they lose an important and steady cashflow. They should do it like MWO. For all of it's earlier faults those guys really nailed some things (like purchasing MC) and it's still my favourite game to play."
Starcitizen_trades,3ck9po,NewzyOne,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:05:04 2015 UTC,"MW:O has a key difference, no trade between players, which is what keeps farming useless.  Overall it's a system I like, but not conductive to the player driven economy that SC is striving for, which will almost always be dictated by gold farming."
Starcitizen_trades,3cl5z3,xRaynex,3,Wed Jul 8 19:36:52 2015 UTC,"Pick up any cheap LTI ship and wait for the CCU (released when the ship is flight ready). You can then upgrade to the MAX.  You can also buy discounted credits to upgrade, so that drops the price even lower.  Some LTI ships (anything cheaper than $110, really) have sold at cost lately, but picking up Aurora LTI's in the $80 range aren't unheard of. You could also buy a Herald (next cheap ""LTI token"" to be added to AC 1.0) for $90-$110, which is only $5-$15 markup. Those will be in AC and ready for CCU's before the Freelancer is flyable."
Starcitizen_trades,3cl5z3,jester86,2,Thu Jul 9 02:46:26 2015 UTC,"A general rule of thumb is that an older LTI ship is melt plus $80-$120, sometimes more. Sometimes less (see 350R LTI for a weirdly difficult sale at $75 more than melt, and Herald LTIs that only sell at less than $40 over melt.)  The newer LTI ships are cheaper in comparison - for instance Hull As and Reliants are either melt+4% fees, or melt+$10-$20. It's a supply and demand thing. However Hull As won't be flyable for a very long time, and Reliants likely shortly before that. ie you'll have to wait a while before you can cross-chassis upgrade it to a Freelancer.  Take jester's advice, he's talking from long experience. Grab a Herald and wait a few/several months. CIG are actively working on the Herald, so it won't be too long before it's flyable and CCUs are available.. and hopefully both the Freelancer and Herald are released at similar times. If not, you'll need to wait a bit longer until they are. Freelancer release is penned for Multi-crew AC, or thereabouts."
Starcitizen_trades,3cl5z3,NewzyOne,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:30:54 2015 UTC,"Mm hmm, Ben confirmed Herald will be flight ready prior to AC 2.0."
Starcitizen_trades,3cl5z3,jester86,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:50:20 2015 UTC,Yeah I got confused at the end there.. once Herald is released he can make the upgrade.
Starcitizen_trades,3cl5z3,NewzyOne,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:59:45 2015 UTC,"So if I got an LTI Reliant and held on to it, eventually I'd be able to CCU that to a LTI Freelancer?  I'm looking for an LTI Dur but don't want to pay hundreds of dollars for it."
Starcitizen_trades,3cl5z3,DaHayn,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:48:27 2015 UTC,"Yep, but an LTI Herald will get you one quicker.  The Reliant may not be flyable for.. 8 months? A year? Who knows. Whereas the Herald's one of the next releases.  Of course, if you want a DUR right now there's a few Freelancer LTIs around on the market. You can contact them and ask if they're willing to go lower than advertised prices. Most people will drop at least a little, and some will drop a lot. Depends on normal human factors - how happy they're feeling, how enthusiastic/nice you are, etc."
Starcitizen_trades,3ckao5,DickyBrucks,2,Wed Jul 8 16:00:24 2015 UTC,"Well if you're just looking to be nice, go ahead and advertise selling them at cost + fees.  If you're looking for a markup, a Jump really doesn't get much of a mark up. You'd probably be better off with the $20 Aurora anniversary pack if you're looking for profit (assuming all includes that). It would only go for about $40, but it would be a faster sale at less investment.  Even the big stores sell Jumps at $700."

Starcitizen_trades,3caz6v,the40ftbadger,3,Wed Jul 8 21:46:39 2015 UTC,"It's more of a ""body kit"" it doesn't actually provide an F7A hornet upgrade. but it will change an existing hornets body structure/silhouette to that of the F7A, it's supposed to provide a slightly larger fuel tank and a small boost in armor also.   EDIT: it cannot be applied yet"
Starcitizen_trades,3caz6v,Dreamweaver19,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:21:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the larger fuel tank or armor boost.  All we have been told is that it changes the geometry of the civillian Hornets to the military one's. It doesn't directly affect ship stats, but indirectly affects flight behaviour due to how the game's physics work.  Also it supposedly is the first of multiple steps in changing your civ Hornet to a milspec one.  As of current knowledge, combining it with the Super Hornet gets you the closest to a military Hornet due to the SH's inate stats. Only difference would be the second seat and it being a bit less agile due to having more mass.  Edit: And yes, it cannot be applied yet. It is what info we got from the devs in the time frame this was sold and some time after that.   Edit2: And to clear up a potential misunderstanding. The Super Hornet is not a military Hornet. It is part of the civillian line (F7C-M). The actual military Hornet (F7A) is not (and never was) being sold to civillians (backers)."

Starcitizen_trades,3c8fuw,Howard___Roark,5,Sun Jul 5 21:45:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is, but it really depends on what is tied to the account; i.e., there has to be a compelling reason for someone to want to take a ""risk"" to buy your account instead of buying individual ships or what have you.  An account will sell if it has an element of ""rarity"" to it such as:   Original/Veteran Backer rewards Golden Ticket Limited ships/upgrades, i.e., Idris M/P, Scythe, Phoenix Any combination of the above, and at a price that's ""reasonable"" (not too drastically marked up as people will ALWAYS tend to associate risk with account sales and thus never value it as much as the seller would)   An account will sell if there are ships attached to it regardless of whether they're locked or not, if the melt value/total value of the account is offered at a steep discount to offset the perceived ""risk"" of account sales.  An account will sell if the ships attached are all/mostly giftable (someone else may not mind taking the time to sell all of the ships individually).  On the flipside:  An account will generally not sell if it's just an account filled with things most people can get any day of the week and the price isn't low enough to where it looks like it's a convenience for the seller to offload it close to what he/she paid for it, but that the account actually provides very little value/benefit to the seller outside of taking on that perceived ""risk.""    As for safety:   Yeah, it's generally ""safe."" Account sales/transfers violate CIG's EULA, so they can at their discretion ban any account involved in account trades at anytime if they want, or they can do nothing about them just as well.  There have been instances where sellers try to claim back accounts sold through CIG and buyers end up showing proof of the transaction and end up getting to keep the account, and there's been cases where accounts were given back to the original owners or outright banned once a claimback was initiated as well. It's all a toss up, and that's the ""risk"" associated with buying accounts.  That's why you see accounts with ""compelling reasons"" for buying them constantly selling, because the account contents are usually worth the effort of keeping thorough transaction records and having a good understanding between the buyer and seller, especially if CIG ever has to get involved to figure out who an account really belongs to."
Starcitizen_trades,3c8fuw,jcde7ago,4,Sun Jul 5 22:03:20 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that this game is still 2+ years away from launch. While you might be busy now, a lot can change in a few years.  You won't get back the money you put in, that much is certain. Depending on if they have alpha, if they're locked and which rewards present on the account you may be lucky to get 75% of your initial investment (credit sells for ~80% these days but you need to re-invest real money at 100% to get them unlocked for sale).  If your account was created prior to July 2013 then it may be a different story, but based on the information you've given it looks like you've got about $200 ""profit"" to be had from your ~$240 investment."

Starcitizen_trades,3c8fuw,Paradox3713,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:09:46 2015 UTC,"The main question is, how much do you want for it?  If they aren't account locked (still gifteable), you may manage to sell them a little bit below their buying price, think around 90%, depending on the payment method fees.  If they are locked to account, don't panic, there still is a way to make them gifteable again, provided you can invest 45 bucks more per ship.  https://as.reddit.com/r/starcitizen_trades/wiki/unlock  If you plan to sell the account with ships locked, it's gonna be a lot harder, if you are not asking for a really low price, like 75% of melt value. Best bet would be to sell it to a friend/acquaintance who will want to keep it or is ok to buy the ships he wants with melted RSI.

Starcitizen_trades,3c8fuw,Paradox3713,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:14:10 2015 UTC,"Im an account dealer who has purchased many accounts, and keep track of all messages and invoices.  I can tell you right now I am not worried about buying or selling accounts.  Infact /u/xcoriganx is an account dealer I have worked with many times, he is very trustworthy, experienced, and has great prices if you are looking for assistance OP.  I can also tell you I think you have to look at the type of accounts you are dealing in.  I welcome anyone to debate me on this as I too am trying to learn more and more but the type of accounts and what are in them should tell you alot on your potential for success in dealing them.    Example 1:  OB/VB have the award value if you are into that sort of thing.  But can you do more with the account?  Hell yeah you can.  You can put a high value, hull limited ship in them and establish quite a bit of value in them.  Moreso if you happen to have an LTI Aurora in them or have one that can be unmelted as at that point it is a complete package account.   Example 2:  You have a setup similar to Ex 1, only you have a few giftable ships in it.  This account will definately cost you way more so you need to assess how much potential value the account may have.  If you're going to sell you have to really look at how much you can possibly gain from it if you flip it.  Are you okay with a $200 profit or can you wait for a potential $800 profit?  What ships does it hold and what are their roles?  Can they be CCUed on the cheap into something more sought after and valuable?  Is there any store credit or gear items in the account and are you willing to pay for them?  Those are serious things to think about.    The most important could possibly be Example 3, the After Release Account.  The ARA is important because now we have an idea of just where CIG establishes all value.  What can you now do with the account?  Did CIG really make their ships two or three times more expensive or keep them at pre-launch values?  Did the value of store credit take the same step up with regard to the gaming world or hold fast? And almost just as important, what will LTI and Citizenship really mean?    I won't speak on the Citizenship part as that is really obvious to many here.  But the LTI part seems boring at first (Due to LTI drama) but may also be interesting due to the fact that regardless of Ben saying that LTI is nothing more than a convience, the Uber-Goober also stated early on in the campaign that LTI is the only insurance that cannot be voided if you go into RESTRICTED ZONES!  Can you say Corin boys and girls?  I knew that you could.  :o)   Other locations are also restricted and it has been said that insurance claims will not be honored if your ship is destroyed in a high risk restricted zone but again that applies to non-LTI insurance ships.  So if said account has LTI ships in it there is value but you need to look at the ship and roles.  Just keep in mind that an account too high in value on the showroom floor will take a while to sell so you may end up having to hold onto it for a long time.   I recommend a 1 or 2 locked LTI ship limit on any OB/VB based on total ship cost ($300 to $400 max), to 2 to 3 ship limit on any OB/VB accounts with sought after giftable ships that all have LTI as well.  For non-OB/VB accounts ($15 Million Awards or brand new accounts I only recommend 1 high value sought after ship that is still giftable and has a value of no higher than $350 or Constellation Phoenix.  Just sell the ship when ready or leave the item in a stasis account so it can be sold more than once.  Lastly, No offense OP or anyone that has them but I would not purchase any account that has non-LTI ships in them nor would I continue to put more non-LTI ships in them even if they are considered limited types (Superhornet, 350R, Phoenix, etc.).  For those who have them I would purchase cheap LTI concept tokens, and then wait for a chance to melt your non-LTI stocks to purchase limited upgrades so you can CCU them into something that you can sell.   Okay let The Knights Church of Chris Roberts and Latter Day Minions commence their downvote runs!  BRING IT ON! LOL!"

Starcitizen_trades,3c8fuw,mikegold10,-2,Sun Jul 5 21:54:55 2015 UTC,"Yes there is a market. No, in my personal opinion it is not safe."
Starcitizen_trades,3c8fuw,jcde7ago,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:26:45 2015 UTC,"Curious, what makes you think it's not safe? There are countless people who've dabbled in account sales/purchases/transfers, myself included, and have never had any issues.  What makes people believe that they are ""unsafe"" anymore than buying ships that are gifted? The claim back argument for accounts is just as dubious as a claim back argument for gifted ships. Anyone can cry foul, and in fact, CIG is just as likely to hand a ship back to its original owner if they claim they were account hacked and someone gifted their ship just as much as CIG is to do the same with an account.  This is why keeping records and REQUIRING detailed invoices and personal information be attached to account sales is important. You have that, and the WORST that can happen is CIG nukes the account in question, leaving the buyer out of luck if they don't have proper records, but CIG certainly won't give it back to the seller, either, since it's now a question of ownership validity if there's not overwhelming proof....and if it is in that limbo state where someone is struggling to prove who the account now belongs to then you can bet CIG will lay down the ""EULA violation"" hammer and ban the account, instead of attempt to help give it back to the rightful owner. There have been a few cases where claim backs were attempted and failed because buyers/sellers had proof and CIG gave the account to the owner who was supposed to have it, even if the transaction itself broke their EULA.   It makes zero sense for sellers to even attempt account claim backs unless they're dealing with wholly incompetent buyers who won't take screenshots of Reddit PMs/listings and PayPal invoices/emails. With PayPal buyer protection covering intangible goods, which includes ""digital items,"" incorporating that into an invoice is not even difficult, and in the event of any shenanigans PayPal WILL absolutely cover you, especially if the terms of the account sale are in the invoice that PAYPAL itself manages and archives for the buyer and the seller."
Starcitizen_trades,3c8fuw,jester86,2,Mon Jul 6 00:00:44 2015 UTC,"I think selling them is safe, but from the buyer's perspective we have seen several attempted to be reclaimed. To my knowledge, none have been reclaimed successfully as long as you can prove payment and an agreement was made. It is completely up to the buyer to use common sense and keep records of the transaction or else he may find himself without said account."
Starcitizen_trades,3c8fuw,jcde7ago,3,Mon Jul 6 00:19:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, agreed. I just don't see anymore of an inherent risk in it from a buyer's point of view either since buyers should be keeping thorough records and such of any transactions, especially if choosing to dabble in account sales.   I don't see many instances of ""risk"" in cases where the buyer is aware of how to protect him/herself by working closely with the seller on how an invoice should be worded or whatnot and if records are kept in the event a claim back occurs. This should just be common practice with ANY transaction anyways, so singling out Account sales like it's something entirely different from ship sales when all is said and done has never made any sense to me."
Starcitizen_trades,3c8fuw,jester86,2,Mon Jul 6 00:27:27 2015 UTC,"I think accounts inherently carry more risk of being reclaimed as they carry more value than just a ship, however I agree that a hack claim is treated the same by CIG regardless of if it's $10 or $10,000.  If you are responsible in keeping records, build a good working relationship with the seller and realize that you should be keeping proper records of any transaction which takes place here, there should be no problem.  From what we've seen recently, the original account email offers some peace of mind to the buyer (maybe the seller is now less likely to attempt a reclaim) but hasn't proven to be any more secure than a sale without its inclusion. However, due to the pre-existing stigma, original email included accounts will always sell for more, regardless of if said inclusion adds any security or not."

I think everyone needs to find their comfort level with this game. Honestly, Star Citizen is looking like a bigger and bigger gamble every day - I personally believe that people pledging now are taking a bigger risk than people who pledged back in 2012. 2012's Star Citizen was an ambitious but achievable goal; 2015's Star Citizen is a staggering colossus of high-end, complex, massive game concepts all supposedly intended to work seamlessly, being built by a brand new company that is largely untested in making a game of this size.  So anyone pouring $100-$1000+ into this game needs to be comfortable with the reality that Star Citizen - as advertised - may never exist. Oh, sure - a game called ""Star Citizen"" will eventually come out, but will it be everything CIG has promised? Because right now, 3 years into development, we have a dodgy flight sim in a small arena, a static standalone hangar space, and nothing else.  Am I being a pessimist? Maybe - but when you're spending money, optimism is a luxury - not a sound business strategy. I've invested at my current level because I'm comfortable losing what I've spent; but also because if SC succeeds (and I really hope it does), I'm well positioned to have a few awesome ships, and a chunk of cash to get me started."

I been yelled at on the RSI forums for referring to pledging and ship buying as ""donations"" by people saying ""You are paying for content"". It has been explicitly stated that this game will not be pay to win. Thus all these people who think they are getting something special by putting $1500 down for an Idris are gona have a bad time."
Starcitizen_trades,3c82o4,Liudeus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:22:59 2015 UTC,"CR's definition of pay to win is about the same as his definition of an MMO (which he claimed for over a year SC was not). ""You just have to redefine winning to not winning.""  But P2W/not P2W has nothing to do with the legal definition of a purchase verses a donation. You're not ""donating"" to games when you buy character skins which have no balance impact. It's objectively not a donation, even if it would perhaps be more judicious to treat it like a donation since the ships probably won't actually be worth $400."
Starcitizen_trades,3c82o4,Liudeus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:21:00 2015 UTC,"Ok ok, we can technically define it as a transaction and not a donation, but in what world would these ships be worth $100+? You are sending money to the development and in return getting to start with a cool ship. Realistically I would pay maybe $50 to get to start with a Vanguard. I would rather not go into the hair splitting argument as to what P2W is and whether or not SC in it's final form will be P2W."
Starcitizen_trades,3c82o4,CrashDDL,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:47:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not disagreeing that many people who have purchased ships will be disappointed. Ultimately ""bad value"" does not change the legal definition of a sale (though considering they're sales of digital goods in a fictional game, the legal definition is already cloudy).  Star Citizen is going to be one of those ""pay to skip"" games, like Hearthstone. Do you value the $25 spent on the single player quest ""wings"" more, the 200+ hours over 2 months that it takes to grind it out in gold, or are you just going to skip that BS because it's an awful grindy piece of trash which deserves neither time nor money? (A payment model which objectively detriments gameplay. ""Pay to win"" is an irrelevant definition, it makes the game worse, therefore it's bad. Official definitions are useless because someone can just then say ""it's technically not the official definition, so that means it's perfectly fine and doesn't harm the game in any way."")  Off of that tangent, SC will be ""Do you value the $225 a Constellation costs or 60 hours of gameplay to earn it?"" Well, for someone working a job at any first world pay rate, it might be worth it to pay that money and be able to use the time they've skipped on something else (And it does seem much fairer to the players than the Hearthstone model... But we'll see.)"

Starcitizen_trades,3c82o4,mikegold10,0,Sun Jul 5 22:17:33 2015 UTC,That would be crazy though.  To go as far as to sell them knowing exactly people got them as LTI tokens and yet not releasing it so that people can CCU them into LTI ships.    That's pretty shady if they aren't released soon.
Starcitizen_trades,3c82o4,mikegold10,3,Sun Jul 5 20:42:17 2015 UTC,"It's only ""shady"" if you view it in the context of a user who bought one to CCU, though.   Remember: CIG didn't sell the Reliant as a ""CCU enabler""; they sold it as an alternate starter. It wasn't their intent for people to buy it exclusively to upjump it to something else.  Now, if it just so happens that sales were huge specifically because of that intent...? Well, nudge nudge wink wink that's just a happy accident, right?  My point is - and I've been saying this as far back as the Herald - anyone buying the newer ships with the intent to use them as ""CCU tokens"" is taking a gamble. The CCU process of today isn't the CCU process of tomorrow, and CIG's only consistent ""approach"" has been the one that makes them money. If they don't feel opening up Tier 3-4 ships to CCU upwards makes sense from a business perspective, they won't. Forgot what they said yesterday, or last month, or last year; they can and will change the message to suit the moment."
Starcitizen_trades,3c82o4,SlackerDao,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:40:29 2015 UTC,"But that is exactly what people bought Hull As and Reliants for - CCU enablers.

People may very well end up with half a dozen or more ships that don't CCU anywhere. While I'd wager that's unlikely, it is not impossible.  That's one of the reasons why you can buy a Reliant or Hull A on here at cost, while an Aurora MR will still run you $100 or more*. The MR can be CCU'd up the chain; every Wave 3+ ship is still very much in the ""maybe some day"" column."

Even your dream LTI ship is going to have additional insurance for passengers/cargo/additions. Having LTI doesn't mean you won't need any additional  insurance, just that your insurance should be much cheaper.  At least that is my understanding from all the responses on the matter."

Your LTI hull insurance will be covered though.  That is why Ben's claims that there is no real value in LTI are for shit.  If I want to acquire something in a highly restricted area or want to go and visit a restricted area I can do so with LTI and not worry about it verses someone using any other insurance."

Either way, we'd need a source or the actual game to find out. I always assumed (I think I read it on RSI forums) that you can still lose an LTI ship in the same manner as an SHI ship."

Primarily because people were playing the word game with what lifetime insurance meant.    As far as I know the only time LTI could be revoked is if you got caught being fraudulent and trying to just give your LTI ship away to people by faking a capture and making a claim afterwards.  So what would have to happen is that someone caught you doing it, it was recorded, and then reported.  The main concern was people giving away heavies and Capships.  Is that how you remember it /u/Jester86 and /u/Baragoon?"
Starcitizen_trades,3c82o4,Baragoon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:41:26 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, any captured ship will not retain LTI (it'll be blacklisted from insurance altogether unless new reg tags are forged and assigned). They'll make it so flipping ships that way will not be worth it monetarily.  Taking your ship into a null sec zone won't affect your insurance but taking it into a UEE no-civ zone might  In addition, as you said, anyone caught flipping ships will have LTI stripped. I'm not sure how they'll tell though, people go afk all the time.  So as far as passing on LTI, it will only be assigned to 1 hull at a time. As ships are sold to NPC's the number of LTI ships will dwindle. As you can't apply CCU's in the PTU all those Auroras are going to get dusty right quick."

Starcitizen_trades,3bzrch,BoredDellTechnician,12,Fri Jul 3 13:51:50 2015 UTC,I seriously feel bad for the mods of this forum for having to continuously deal with this person. So thank you for that. This person only seems to like to do two things; swoon you into buying a ship or threaten to sue you for nonsense if you a) piss him off or now b) don't pay when he sends you an invoice. I'd be seriously rich if I could sue all the people who've won auctions on my eBay sellers account and never payed for the item. It's quite hilarious how much he seems to feed on his own delusions.  Now excuse me while I take the time to wonder why the hell I bothered reading through all his posts and try to reclaim what's now left of my own sanity. Granted I didn't have much anyways.
Starcitizen_trades,3bzrch,destrinate,-16,Fri Jul 3 16:01:56 2015 UTC,"I've never threatened to sue anyone for 'pissing me off' nor for nonacceptance of an invoice. The only statement I made in discussion with my satisfied buyer is that if his happening upon these defamatory posts was the reason for his nonacceptance, then so be it, the otherwise accepted deal transaction that potentially would have been usurped simply would've been directly tallied to the mounting damages. You realize there's three parties at play in that unauthorized publicized blurb, right? Both buyer and seller are 100% satisfied with our end results."

He isn't how everyone thinks he is, he has a very good knowledge to trading. That picture used here has been taken by me, thereby the full rights to this picture is mine. Can't recall you asking to post it publicly.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Starcitizen_trades/comments/2zy5kj/important_do_not_take_it_upon_yourselves_to/ Read that thread, specifically the last paragraph where Jester82 HIMSELF states that the claim of DigitalDiamond being a scammer was FALSELY FILED. DigitalDiamond, aka CarrackCraven, sent me that specific response because I accused him of being a scammer. After the accusation took place, he showed me evidence that he was falsely accused of begin a scammer by the Mods."
Starcitizen_trades,3bzrch,Baragoon,15,Sat Jul 4 00:31:35 2015 UTC,"Read that thread, specifically the last paragraph where Jester82 HIMSELF states that the claim of DigitalDiamond being a scammer was FALSELY FILED.    No, the counter claim was filed by Thedigitaldiamond. I did not state what you suggest I did. That post states:   DigitalDiamond was banned as a scammer even though he created the scam alert.    The purpose of the post you linked was an appeal to let moderators go about investigations without impedance or misguided assistance by the public. It also asks them to withhold forming judgement before the facts can be presented in entirety. As this is relevant here I would suggest people take a minute to reread the post you listed, yourself included, because you are passing judgement based on limited evidence and do not have access to the breadth of private information we do.  The post you have been supplied with represents one of perhaps 10 or more which address Thedigitaldiamond. The post in particular that you have linked has nothing to do with the user aside from referencing his previous username in an analogy. The content and context of that post have absolutely no bearing on his past history nor does it show any change in the stance assumed by the moderator group.    Since this is the third time I have been threatened with a lawsuit by this user I will attempt to be brief and clearly state our continued stance so there is no room for misinterpretation.   Libel implies that statements falsely made impact the quality of life of a person. An online account is not deemed to be an individual and can be replaced easily. There is also overwhelming proof, agreed upon by dozens of users, that a scam had occurred. Subsequent bannings of this user have been given as a result of him repeatedly lying, misleading and completely sidestepping the rules of this subreddit. Many times we have asked this user to participate in a reasonable discussion regarding his past actions and future here, all of which have been declined or refused to listen to what we have to say. We have not lobbied CIG to close his account, we have not publicly listed any of his real-life information and by presenting factual evidence of his previous wrongdoing we have not committed libel.   The ban is, was and always will be justified based on the collective agreement by the moderators at that time. I'd like to point out that I wasn't a moderator when the initial ban was given, so it is preposterous to target and blame me for it. I derive no personal gain or satisfaction from banning his alts but he makes it so obvious that not banning them would result in blowback from the community. As I have stated in the most recent post, this user could be the nicest and best trader in the world, however he repeatedly breaks our rules and as such is not welcome to trade here. This is a privately owned and operated subreddit. Violation of its terms of use result in your removal from it. Repeated reinfiltration will result in continued removal. I don't understand why this is repeatedly being contested.  At this user's request I discontinued all involvement with the previous case regarding GurlPowah, the alt which we had sufficient evidence to prove was him. He declined to prove us otherwise and was again justly banned. The most recent case resulted in a quick ban after approximately 10 minutes of investigation. It just so happened that I was the moderator online at the time, I do not have a personal agenda against this user."

Most of the time, scammers actually have nothing at all to sell, maybe posting already-posted/linked to images from other people's sale threads instead. All they need to do in their minds is make a few hundred bucks from one sucker and they'll move on to another subreddit and try there or create another account and try again here.   It's why it's so important to this community to have the awesome mods that we have and keen members who are pretty good about smelling bullshit in a potential listing.  Common sense, a bit of time researching sellers (and buyers), gauging communication attitude, prior Reddit history, verified PayPal...should always be enough to avoid scams. On the off chance a deal is too large or carries ANY ""higher"" chance of a scam, don't even play around and just grab a middleman. Problem solved.  Also, quick reminder that with PayPal's policy change that went into effect on July 1, 2015 (just 2 days ago), digital purchases are now officially covered and disputable; PayPal will protect buyers in transactions where digital items were bought and sold using an invoice, especially if an item is not received or ""not as described."" That doesn't make trades here any SAFER, but it should instill some more confidence in buyers, especially new traders. Couple PayPal's policy change and some due diligence + record keeping = a problem free experience here for most people.   I've done over $6,000 USD in trades here now as a buyer, seller and broker with all kinds of people...1 day old Reddit accounts, very recent RSI accounts, zero trade or Reddit history, etc....and have yet to run into a single issue just by using a bit of common sense most of the time."
Starcitizen_trades,3byvsq,jcde7ago,2,Fri Jul 3 07:47:45 2015 UTC,Thank you for the Paypal Policy update! I was unaware of this!
Starcitizen_trades,3byvsq,SnakeEyedBlaze,3,Fri Jul 3 07:49:44 2015 UTC,"No problem! In broader terms, ""intangible goods"" are now covered under their purchase protection program, and digital items are officially considered intangible goods now.  The burden of proof is actually more on sellers now to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that a buyer received a digital item after it was paid for. In this case, Hangar logs and what have you should be enough proof as well as confirmation of the sale in the thread, etc. In any honest transaction these changes should be completely welcomed by both buyers and sellers. :)"

You could literally have the best evidence ever that proves you havent received your goods and paypal wouldnt even look at it.  Seems like they have finally felt the weight of people being scammed all over the internet and realised maybe, just maybe, they might get known as a scammers go-to-site in the future."

Starcitizen_trades,3byvsq,Equilibriator,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:50:55 2015 UTC,"Something to keep in mind though, there is still no seller protection for digital items... or at least none I can find.  Also, Buyer Protection has now been extended to 180 days. So basically, PayPal is now a risky option for selling digital goods, if you don't do it properly and by the book (please people, read the wiki).. and you'd better keep your documents on hand for 6 months, filed so that you can get them and reply within 24 hours or you will lose any dispute. The current (AUS) policy states:     Eligibility  S4.1 You must meet all the relevant basic and additional requirements to be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection:  PayPal Seller Protection applies to Reversals based on:   Unauthorised transactions or an item not received.   Basic requirements   The item purchased must be a physical, tangible good (except vehicles); You must respond to our requests for documentation and other information that is reasonably required by PayPal regarding a Reversal filed against you within the timeframe specified; and Your eligibility is not otherwise suspended.   Additional requirements   You receive payment via PayPal from a buyer’s PayPal account; You provide us with valid Proof of Shipment; and The item is sent to the address we specify on the payment notification or ""Transaction Details Page"" which can be accessed by logging in to your PayPal account.   Limitations  S5.1 The PayPal Seller Protection Policy will not apply to a transaction if:   More than one payment is received for a single transaction; You combine items purchased through separate PayPal payments into a single shipment; You do not provide Proof of Shipment or respond to our requests for information in a timely manner; The item is delivered in person or picked up in person; The item is shipped to an address not listed on the “Transaction Details Page”; Payment is made through guest checkout outside of eBay, PayPal Here Email Payments and direct Credit Card payments through PayPal (including Virtual Terminal and Website Payments Pro – Hosted Solution or API); The item sold is an intangible good, travel tickets, quasi-cash, gift certificate, downloadable or streaming content, licence for digital content or a service; The item is a vehicle (including cars, motorcycles, caravans, boats and planes); The buyer claims the item is significantly not as described; You have not complied with the terms of this Agreement, any PayPal policy or any specific directions provided by us; or -The buyer files a claim through a buyer protection policy other than the PayPal Buyer Protection Policy.     I'd love it if someone could point out how sellers are protected. LOVE it. As far as I can tell, there's no protection by PayPal... basically you'd better do everything exactly per the PayPal requirements otherwise you're on your own. So do it right peeps."
Starcitizen_trades,3byvsq,NewzyOne,0,Fri Jul 3 08:44:55 2015 UTC,Incorrect paypal has added digital goods protection since July 1st 2015  http://www.pymnts.com/news/2015/paypals-buyer-protection-for-digital-goods-goes-live/
Starcitizen_trades,3byvsq,starcitz,2,Fri Jul 3 10:22:19 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about Seller protection.  I copy/pasted that from the live PayPal site.. so I hope it is correct.  See here for the USA policy summary: https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/paypal-seller-protection  Note the bit where it says:    What’s not safeguarded?   Local pickups or deliveries made in person. Digital goods, tickets, travel, gift vouchers, services, intangible items (items that can’t be held or shipped) or vehicles.    So basically, you'll have to provide some good and reliable, cross linked info that conforms with what PayPal deem as viable documents, and only email gifts to people's verified paypal email. I'm not saying sellers aren't protected, but like mentioned earlier, the onus of proof is on the seller."
Starcitizen_trades,3byvsq,NewzyOne,3,Fri Jul 3 11:26:57 2015 UTC,"If you see something odd, ask a polite question about it.  Asking polite questions is not against the rules in particular when there is a concern.  Flag it as such.  A mod will be along to keep an eye on it, and action it and other less experienced traders are warned.  In addition, the seller has the opportunity to answer a polite question, asked in good faith and perhaps provide further evidence or learn a thing or two about doing a good listing."

Starcitizen_trades,3bzv0a,Reveille12,2,Fri Jul 3 14:25:26 2015 UTC,"A properly filed invoice with a screenshot of all previous negotiation included in the memo section is generally enough. Delivery (or receiving) can be shown through the ""my account history"" section of the RSI site and all past invoices are archived within Paypal for you.   Information on correctly filing an invoice can be found here. If you are unhappy with the invoice you received (doesn't list terms or properly detail the item in question) send it back and ask for it to be rewritten. If the seller refuses, report them to the moderators for discussion and/or arbitration (if it's just a misunderstanding).  This is why using an invoice over a gifted payment is ideal. You are paying ~4% additional fees in return for buyer/seller protection."
Starcitizen_trades,3bzv0a,jester86,2,Fri Jul 3 15:05:57 2015 UTC,A .txt file with my previous trades on. I just copy and paste that cos I'm high tech like that.
Starcitizen_trades,3bzv0a,rossxf,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:14:03 2015 UTC,"Firstly, sorry for the long post. I happen to have been doing a bit of research into this lately... so I'm just regurgitating.  To answer your question, I keep all the following screenshots/logs under a folder named as their PayPal email, with a subfolder of the item ID#. Under the item ID I have (in general) three files named Request.jpg, Email.jpg, Delivery.txt. It's simple, and easy to reference. I also keep a list of all my items with their item IDs in a spreadsheet, and colour them appropriately if they're available or sold or melted so it's easier to know where in my hangar a specific item ID# is. The excel sheet also has other columns about who and when etc.  If anyone has other tips I'd love to hear them!  As a seller, for what you log, you need to tie all elements together - the buyer, the request for purchase, what they want, and it's ID# - and get screenshots or logs of the connections. So as a seller in a worst-case scenario you need:   a screenshot/log of the buyer's request to purchase and what they are requesting (Buyer Protection protects against 'un-requested' sales... even if they pay the invoice) - request.jpg a log showing that same buyer advising their PayPal email. - email.jpg your invoice to have with the description of the buyer's requested item, stating it is a digital asset your invoice to have a note that ties the item ID# with the item description (ie, copy paste the hangar log purchase of that item ID#)   After you send the gift email, you need:   a log showing you sent the gifted item ID# to the buyer's paypal email (can get this from the Hangar Log) - delivery.txt to update the invoice once paid and shipped with a shipping note saying it was shipped, giving reference to the item ID# again, and that it was sent digitally by email to their paypal email   I also like to get a shot of the UUE Citizen Number and the RSI Bio that ties the RSI account to the Reddit account (if they have confirmation flair). Note that there's never a need to gift to anything but the PayPal email. If they can pay the invoice on that email, then they can receive the gift on that email and fwd it however they want after that.  You have no control over the recipient RSI account, you can only control up the the gift email being delivered to the buyer's email and it's up the the recipient as to which RSI account it goes, so the RSI profile and flair are somewhat unnecessary.. I DO, however, just grab them as a backup. The main things are the stiff listed above. Everything else can be gleaned from there if the time comes.  But again, you'd better make sure you send the exact item ID# that you referenced in the invoice, otherwise there's no connection between the invoice and what you actually sent. If you have multiples of the same item and accidentally gift the wrong item ID#, cancel the gift immediately and gift the correct one. Receiving the wrong item ID (even though it's the same item eg ""tracker-to-super hornet upgrade"") is valid grounds for a refund... but they'd have to be an ass to do so.  As /u/jester86 said, following this is a great start for your invoice.  Also, as a seller, I highly recommend you buy at least once from an established store. Something small if you must (giftcard, etc). This will get you a well laid-out invoice example that you can mimic.  As a buyer, if you're ever concerned about a seller, pay via PayPal using a linked credit card rather than a bank account. In a worst-case scenario where PayPal backs the seller even though they didn't gift you the item (which I can't imagine would happen frankly), you can approach your bank and request a chargeback. It's then Visa/MasterCard/AMEX that'll do the investigation, and they are very, very thorough.  As a buyer you can get screenshots of the trade listing offer, you requesting the purchase and them accepting it, and the seller advising their PayPal email (if they aren't invoicing). I'm not sure what else you'd need.. but suffice it to say that you should never send as ""Friends and Family"" payment. That's purely a gift by you with no recompense."

I would categorize it as a minor inconvenience and hopefully it accomplishes something (wouldn't bet on it though).  But when it starts affecting trading done with real money it is much more than a minor inconvenience. A blackout might leave folks in a lurch mid-trade if for example a trade is agreed upon and information is exchanged in the post thread instead of a PM (I see this happening pretty regularly), just to give a quick example."

This was  knee jerk reaction to less than 500 votes to shut down a site that has nothing to do with what was going on with reddit.  I think that if Mods have a disagreement with a website they are using for free,  perhaps they should boycott that site by ceasing to use it and let other people who are using it take over for them. Not by holding a page hostage in your own personal protest that clearly doesn't affect the forum in which said mod is well  moderating.

Any package that has alpha and still is trade-able at this point is bound to run you at least 90-100$ and work up from there depending on the ship. Just a suggestion, good luck."
Starcitizen_trades,3btrer,ripptide111,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:01:55 2015 UTC,well aurora's now package with alpha is at 140 so ya if you want the ln with alpha i will sell you it but its geting expencive and is really for upgrades now
Starcitizen_trades,3btrer,aselwyn1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:45:40 2015 UTC,I'd be willing to pay a reasonable amount. I've seen what they've been selling for recently and it's not too bad. The game has a lot of potential. I have the arena commander module and I really like it so far. I just can't see myself investing any time into it without being able to actually play.
Starcitizen_trades,3btrer,Eric1084,2,Thu Jul 2 05:22:48 2015 UTC,"Well, I got an Aurora LN with Alpha(A whole Game Package) for $50 a few days ago(It have a melt value of $45. So I only technically paid $5 premium for the Alpha. Is it supposed to be at this price? Since I've seen Aurora packages with Alpha for over $100... Or am I just extremely lucky? :-)  P.S: I won't suggest you to buy anything with an Alpha Premium(Value above Melt Value) of more than $20. Since if it is over that, you could just simply buy the ""Module Pass"" for each modules then for possibly cheaper. So the Alpha is not really worth it over that premium."
Starcitizen_trades,3btrer,mikegold10,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:13:57 2015 UTC,"And I got an Aurora LN with Beta and AC for $33, with a melt value of something like $25. The point is: Alpha isn't worth more than the combined cost of the passes (i.e., $10-$15)."
Starcitizen_trades,3btrer,Eric1084,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:23:15 2015 UTC,Hmm. You mean't Alpha.... Right?
Starcitizen_trades,3btrer,mikegold10,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:45:45 2015 UTC,"No, I literally meant Beta. The points was that Beta + several modules = cheaper than Alpha"
Starcitizen_trades,3btrer,Eric1084,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:38:00 2015 UTC,"Well, then why did you pay $8 premium? You should just buy from store directly?"
Starcitizen_trades,3btrer,mikegold10,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:59:39 2015 UTC,Because you cannot buy an Aurora LN Beta with Alpha access in the store for $33 (it would cost $55). The person who sold it to me got in on an Anniversary sale deal that saved me $22 and made him a couple of bucks as well.
Starcitizen_trades,3btrer,Eric1084,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:06:53 2015 UTC,"Right, my bad... Forgot how much it is supposed to cost.. That is a good deal! And you could just buy Alpha pass then with that saved money! :-)"

Starcitizen_trades,3btrer,NewzyOne,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:52:49 2015 UTC,"Yep, if you have the Alpha Access, basically what it meant is that you will have access to ALL of Alpha modules without extra cost. While if you buy module pass individually, that specific pass is only valid for that specific module(Each pass costs $5). Thats why if you could grab a ship with alpha with a premium under $15, you basically saved money on the long run(Till Final Release, which will be a few years, thats why alpha is more worth it.)"

If it's signed it should go for 50-100 more too.   If it's an ob/vb account it will sell for 100-200. someone else will probably have more exact advice on the account value.

Starcitizen_trades,3bnaoi,SpaceApe33,2,Tue Jun 30 16:22:30 2015 UTC,"FYI OP, since you're new, Account sales are generally fairly difficult transactions on this subreddit unless your account has a compelling reason for buyers to be interested in it. Usually, that's either the inclusion of ""rare"" LTI ships or OB/VB rewards and/or a Golden Ticket attached to it.  For the most part, the going rate of an account that's sold is about 80% of the melt value of the ships, since account trades are deemed as ""risky"" and also an account loses tremendous value if all of the ships are locked to the account.  So, 1x Vanguard @ $250 + 2x Reliants @ $100 = $350x80% melt = $280. It's probably not what you want to see, but that's pretty much the reality of it right now.  You can also melt the ships and just sell those after turning them into RSI and then to giftable ships without bothering with the account sale, but you'll take a loss on RSI% as well to the same 70-80% of melt value at best and it'll require you put in more money to get most of your money back out. You can follow this guide here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/Starcitizen_trades/comments/2llanf/psa_how_to_turn_accountlocked_rsi_credits_into/  Good luck!"
Starcitizen_trades,3bnaoi,jcde7ago,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:51:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! However I can't keep the account. Once you buy ships with money that was melted from other ships whatever you buy is account bound.  The total spent on the account was $405 and I thought the LTI was worth something, looks like I was wrong!  I thought LTI was worth more to people. Maybe everybody is finally waking up and realizing it isn't a big deal. That's good, unfortunate for me though :D  Thanks again for the advice."
Starcitizen_trades,3bnaoi,jcde7ago,2,Tue Jun 30 20:12:23 2015 UTC,"No problem, but that's what I mean...you can melt the account bound ships into RSI, then turn that locked RSI into giftable ships...check out the link in my original comment. :)"

Starcitizen_trades,3bmj9f,jester86,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:31:28 2015 UTC,Um... That is over 2 times the price...
Starcitizen_trades,3bmj9f,Eric1084,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:08:27 2015 UTC,"Due to the introduction of CCU chains, LTI has proven itself to be worth a static value, generally ranging between $60-$100 on smaller, CCU ready ships (while larger ships with no viable CCU chains still command a higher value in certain cases).  So you can't look at things as ""double"" or ""triple"" in price, you look at the base melt value and add the total worth of LTI (or other ""goodies"" like alpha, a game package, extras, etc.). In this case, the Delta is worth ~$60 on the open market. Adding the ""cost of LTI"" is +$70-80.  Attempting to apply any different calculation will skew numbers as any percentage based formula will ultimately fail as base costs increase.  In your comment below, when you stated ""LTI premium around $10-$40"", that is vastly incorrect and only applies to recent store sales. As time goes on, ships mature in value and there are many factors which determine the overall ""worth"" of a ship. Just because Reliants are selling at cost + fees that doesn't mean that for instance, a Constellation LTI should also sell for cost + fees.  As a side note, and as a new trader, if you're unsure of the real market value of an item, please refrain from posting in [pricecheck] threads."

So the codes they bought from their on out doesn't have squadron 42... Just a warning. But if you don't about that(Squadron 42/Single-Player Campaign), then you are fine.  EDIT: Yep.

Starcitizen_trades,3bjeum,casemanx,4,Mon Jun 29 18:39:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly, my money is on the 890 becoming the most sought after ship in the game. A lot of people only see a luxury yacht, but this hull has more potential than any other. And it's a capital class ship, but so advanced that a single player is capable of 'managing shipboard operations'. good cargo - even unmodified, very good armament, internal hangar, automated defences, captains quarters, very good speed - on par with a ship half its size...     Such a good ship! and it's cool as all hell too!"
Starcitizen_trades,3bjeum,dealer_dog,2,Tue Jun 30 04:57:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel pretty much the same way. Which is why I really want to hold on to one of them. Heh"
Starcitizen_trades,3bjeum,THS89,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:49:58 2015 UTC,"Spot on. Also, the current model is for the old 80m ship.   Scaling that old model to the new 123m size just doesn't work since everything gets too big.   Basically the enlarged ship will be getting remodeled !   Also heard that Ben said something along the lines of, the 890 should be priced $350 more than starliner but the wave was capped at $600.   Makes sense considering the scale up and Ben's previous comments about comparing it to the old smaller Idris Corvette.   I think CIG intends this to be a fast Civilian Luxury Corvette with the ship and components being priced at around $750 (but that wave was limited to $600).  We will have to wait but I'm fairly sure that my assumption is correct based on comments from Ben and CIG."

Starcitizen_trades,3bjmrk,Reveille12,3,Mon Jun 29 19:35:04 2015 UTC,"Eh, this is probably okay to post here, especially if you say you're ""in the market possibly"" to pick one of these ships up and you want to be informed before making a decision. ;)  But yes, the Vanguard is likely much more worth it than a Super Hornet for long range/duration missions, as that is what is intended role is; a long-range, deep-space fighter.  The SH is a carrier based fighter, and while it's a strong ship, in-game, its uses are going to be largely limited to dog-fighting, and you will likely want and need Squadron/Carrier support.  Keep in mind that Vanguard variants are coming out in ""the near future"" as well, so it may take on other, more specialized roles as well or get bigger upgrades. If I had to choose in your case, i'd go with the Vanguard, and it's not even close. ;)"
Starcitizen_trades,3bjmrk,jcde7ago,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:42:09 2015 UTC,That I probably will be in the market here pretty quick. That is what I am thinking. And I forgot about the upgrade packages so I could pick up the alternate variants upgrade for little to none. Thanks for the reply!

PLUS, the Vanguard is one sexy beast imo."

Starcitizen_trades,3bjmrk,NewzyOne,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:09:47 2015 UTC,"imho the Vanguard is going to be the best fighter aside from the lightning, and I believe this is a milspec ship sold for militia use and not a civilian ice-cream getter version like the F7c.  It's just freaking expensive."
Starcitizen_trades,3bjjjz,Reveille12,4,Mon Jun 29 19:12:25 2015 UTC,"Lack of patience/wanting quick but miniscule profits, losing faith in CIG and want to cash out some of their ties/""investments"" in the game, lots more backers/Citizens when the Vanguard LTI was sold, therefore not as much demand as earlier LTI ships which fewer people purchased to flip in mass quantities....  Pick any/all of the above. :)  I'd expect the Vanguard to peak around $350~ since it's a Fighter and it won't compete with other, larger/multi-purpose/industrial ships, but even then I expect it'll take 3-6 months to get there, if it gets there at all."
Starcitizen_trades,3bjjjz,jcde7ago,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:14:45 2015 UTC,Add in also where a lot of people paid in Euros and were able to get it for cheaper than $250.
Starcitizen_trades,3bjjjz,trandav,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:24:59 2015 UTC,I gotcha. So SC is kind of going through a falling out phase with a lot of it's old backers. Is it just due to lack of game content getting released?
Starcitizen_trades,3bjjjz,jcde7ago,3,Mon Jun 29 19:27:45 2015 UTC,"Well, as mentioned, the market gets saturated as lots of ""new"" sellers stock up on LTI ships because they want to try to cash in too. Lots of the old backers probably have Vanguards they're sitting on, waiting 6-8 months to make profits while the ""newer"" sellers get impatient and offload their stock for close-to-melt value now.  And yes, SC is going through yet another phase of low-confidence due to a lack of playable progress and you're seeing the grey market respond accordingly, to some degree. I've seen more people trying to offload accounts and ships in these last couple of months alone than I have in a pretty long time.  It'll pick back up, but as we get closer and closer to release more and more people will back the game and either saturate the market with LTI ships or, if the $400 Starliner is any indication not many people will buy them because the investment in making a profit is too great for marginal gains.  I'm sure when the hype picks back up again a lot of the ""older"" LTI ships that people have been sitting on will get really expensive for a short while, and will drop back down again. Once the PU is out and we have a good idea of what in-game ship prices are we will either see this market boom or start to bust as the knowledge that people will undoubtedly just grind for hours on end to sell ships in-game, thus bringing overall prices down. I suspect LTI will be a large factor only for Orgs and those with large 15+ ship fleets where the costs really add up. For most people with a handful of ships, LTI will probably be of little value. That's my guess."
Starcitizen_trades,3bjjjz,Jethro_E7,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:39:08 2015 UTC,People have spent enough on the game and are happy with the funding level.  The only way to get new ships is to melt / sell.
Starcitizen_trades,3bjjjz,acemonster07,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:02:04 2015 UTC,"There's another reason that wasn't mentioned here: With the release of the Reliants, AKA ""cheap lti,"" it has been mentioned that the new CCU system (when released) will allow a CCU path to any ship that is more expensive than the ship from which you start. I reference this concierge answer: http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/2kkphs/ccu_concierge_inquiry_3/  It's likely that the Vanguard will be flyable prior to PU. With this assumption, who's to say that people won't use the reliant's as CCU-fodder for ships like the Vanguard or Retaliator? I think that, in combination with a possible exodus of older backers and growing worry among others, we see ships (aside from the rare ones) dropping price across the board."
Starcitizen_trades,3bjjjz,acemonster07,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:46:06 2015 UTC,"Ahh ok. So if I wanted a Vanguard LTI, which I do, but can't really afford to dump $250 right now, I could pick up a reliant and then CCU it once the vanguard goes back up?"
Starcitizen_trades,3bjjjz,VOIDsama,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:05:31 2015 UTC,"An lti reliant is not a bad idea, even if you don't upgrade it. It seems like a lovely starter ship. That said, it's not guaranteed that the Vanguard will be flyable, but I think it had a role in SQ42, and I'm certain they'll make it flyable for the AC 2.0 module. If you really are strapped for cash, this seems like a logical move."
Starcitizen_trades,3bjjjz,mikegold10,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:15:06 2015 UTC,"the vangard is still early in the process.  until we actually see a more fleshed out version, the price wont go up much.  If the next view of it shows something really cool, then the price of these LTI versions will go up.  If not, then it wont.  Its been that way for awhile now.  Back when limited ships were only bought by earlier backers, there were fewer of them.   Now we also have so many more backers that the supply is greater than the demand.  Combine this with cheap CCU options that will allow players to upgrade to the ship they want later on without risk of a large ship investment now, and you get low margins.  If you were howerver to get a day where the trade system ends, the market would explode with sales and large markups for ""rare"" ships."
Starcitizen_trades,3bjjjz,jcde7ago,0,Tue Jun 30 06:08:48 2015 UTC,It's a recent LTI ship. Recent LTI ships sell at just above (or right at) cost.
Starcitizen_trades,3bjjjz,SlackerDao,3,Mon Jun 29 19:39:38 2015 UTC,"That is due to a lack of patience, because more backers have had the chance to buy them. Saying that the reason is because it's a ""recent release"" is kind of inaccurate because the sheer market saturation and impatience are the reasons, and not its recency. If it were sold yesterday and only 500 were made available, it'd be selling at a huge premium already, though people would likely get mass-downvoted for it. ;)  I'm sure when we pick up 100,000 more citizens and some people want an LTI Vanguard and they're no longer nearly as available as they are now 6 months from now, they will see your ""typical"" $80-120 LTI premium for those willing to pay it."
Starcitizen_trades,3bjjjz,NewzyOne,2,Mon Jun 29 19:43:44 2015 UTC,"What are Carracks going for now? $400-450? That's probably a good indicator of where the Vanguard might end up, in terms of % uplift."
Starcitizen_trades,3bjjjz,mikegold10,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:23:00 2015 UTC,"My thoughts are that the Carrack is a long range multi-crew explorer with full on-board self-reliance and a dedicated jump point scanning/mapping suite, so that's why it has such a bump. I think Vanguard'll max out below $400 since it's still essentially just a long range fighter (mind you, it's the best-in-class, kinda omg awesome I desperately want to fly this thing fighter, but nonetheless a fighter)."

CIG can try to spice it up all they want with whatever in-flight mini-games or pilot rep system there will be for passenger transport and honestly, it still sounds boring as all hell.  These things are going to be prime targets for pirates and mercs in the 'verse...I can only imagine the escort fees every time you have to take one out through a dangerous system while you have 40 VIPs packed like sardines inside. I know I can't wait to put a couple 'Tali or Idris torps into any of these that I run into in the 'verse. ;)  And yeah, $400 for the privilege of being a loot pinata...no thanks, CIG. That, and the fact that variants are yet again being mentioned is just a little over the top at this point. There are so many other cool ships that I own that I can't really see myself choosing to fly a Starliner over a lot of other cool ships with more interesting roles/functions and more awesome/unique looks and styles.  Starliners I imagine will be as common as Hulls and what have you, since NPCs will no doubt be flying them...so I don't mind earning one in the PU one bit.

Hope you can board the ship to fly to a system where your going to meet up with friends but then teleport to a friends ai on his ship and play the ai while you wait for your character to get to the star system you want otherwise it's going to be a boring flight
Starcitizen_trades,3bd34t,InertiamanSC,3,Sun Jun 28 05:51:02 2015 UTC,Oh the complete lack of specialization reeks as well. Yes it's a passenger liner but sure you can fill it with cargo! Sure you can MDK everything with it! Sure it's a mobile CAC! And why yes if course its great for racing!  How do you possibly balance a string of ever larger Mary sues?
Starcitizen_trades,3bd34t,Ivan_SC,4,Sun Jun 28 10:32:21 2015 UTC,I've got my [service] post up doing flips at cost. I guess I'll bump it.  The issue is that $400 is quite risky to be doing flips for. When it's only $100 you don't mind taking the risk for no profit. When you're extending yourself for $350-$400 with no profits it makes fighting a chargeback all that much more painful.  Edit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Starcitizen_trades/comments/3bd9zd/bump_wts_lti_genesis_33438_37904_including_fees/
Starcitizen_trades,3bd34t,jcde7ago,8,Sun Jun 28 02:58:59 2015 UTC,"Yep.   Plus, the price really is ludicrous for a space bus.   I just don't see how anyone can expect to make any profit from these things unless you're investing to flip for $10-20 profits in 4-6 months...and when you're talking about crossing into the $400~ price territory, you're talking about the expectation of having buyers willingly pass on a bunch of other, arguably far more worthwhile LTI ships to get a Starliner instead:   Merchantman Reclaimer Retaliator Rear Admiral/Connie packages Carrack  Orion   And so on...all of the above at around the same price as a Starliner are far more interesting and worthwhile ships, imo...and are people really going to gloss over that list and think, ""nah, gonna grab the space bus instead!"""
Starcitizen_trades,3bd34t,mikegold10,6,Sun Jun 28 03:09:39 2015 UTC,"Perhaps it all comes down to the amount of money to be made in-game vs fun factor. If truly few people buy the Starliner, it may be the case that those that did will make sizable profits, at least when the game comes out.  Now on the fun factor side of things, it's very hard to tell how interesting each career path will be, since they are all so vague. I think a decision for any ship based on the belief that its respective career choice will be interesting is pure speculation at this point.  Take for example the oft chosen ""pew pew"" career path. How many people are going to be completely burned out by Arena Commander 1.0/2.0/3.0 before the game even comes out?   If anything, the only remaining novelty will be in some sort of commercial/industrial path. The Genesis offers one such option. It's excitement/interest level vs. another commercial/industrial path is going to be highly dependent on the direction these paths take. Similar arguments, with regard to boredom and monotony, can be levied against the Orion and Starfarer as well, depending on how their respective mechanics come to fruition.  tl;dr - I don't think we can judge how the Genesis will fair against other commercial/industrial ships at this time."
Starcitizen_trades,3bd34t,jcde7ago,2,Sun Jun 28 03:30:32 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's too difficult to try to predict what roles will be more profitable than others to start...especially since I can't see ferrying 40~ passengers or whatnot as a cheap endeavor.   Escorts, fuel costs, passenger insurance, etc...those aren't cheap to start, either. And other roles will have their own costs associated with them as well. I'm more saying that given $400, imo there are currently better options than a Starliner if I had to choose something at that price point...it's just not that compelling of an option when you're going up against a bunch of other cool ships."
Starcitizen_trades,3bd34t,mikegold10,0,Sun Jun 28 03:48:18 2015 UTC,"I certainly agree with you on the price tag. However, the smart people will buy RSI right on this forum to try to bring the price down to Terra."
Starcitizen_trades,3bd34t,thecitris,2,Sun Jun 28 17:27:00 2015 UTC,"I have all the ships on your list - well, my Connie is a signed RA - the Starliner has yet to be fully vetted.  And it's in a class of its own.  I don't even know how to compare it to all my other ships.  Space bus is pretty harsh, but its the common epithet to date - still, I got one.  And if no one else buys one - I'll have one hell of a tricked out personal jumbo jet by the time everyone else is trying to get certified just to fly one. Muaaahhahahahaha  SWACS and C2 variants have my attention - the hunter/killer is intriguing as well.  And you forgot 890Jump - the only ship that really compares to it at this point."
Starcitizen_trades,3bd34t,Br0wnH0rn3t,3,Sun Jun 28 03:24:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Starliner is in the same ballpark as a 890. In retrospect I think the 890 (for its price) is a great deal. The best ""capital"" ship in that price range."
Starcitizen_trades,3bd34t,jcde7ago,2,Sun Jun 28 07:17:33 2015 UTC,"I have all the ships I mentioned as well (sans the Carrack, I'm honestly just really not a fan of Anvil designs at all for some reason...not my style) but really the Starliner just doesn't have anything that makes it stand out outside of its passenger carrying capacity.   And it's funny you mentioned the milspec variants, because...hasn't CIG basically been saying ""hunter/killer"" for a lot of ships? I feel like lots of other ships could fill that role...heck, the Vanguard can fill that role for $150 less and probably do a better job at it!  As I mentioned in the other comment the Corvette is going on sale in the near-future, so anything military/combat oriented as far as roles are concerned....do we really want to rely on the Starliner to fulfill those? What advantages would it bring exactly? Yes, the Corvette may very well cost twice as much, but it'd be far more effective as a combat-focused vessel than a Starliner would, so I cant' see myself spending $400 that could be going towards something that will perform military functions to a greater capacity.  I guess what it comes down to is with a Hangar full of ships, assuming most of them ""fill a different role""....I could never see myself choosing the Starliner for anything outside of transporting passengers, which is what it will excel at, because every other role it could (theoretically) fill, whether exploration or military-based...is going to be secondary to passenger transport. And how do we know that? Because there are already ships that either exist or will exist that are designed from the ground up to fulfill those certain, combat-oriented (or exploration) roles.   Wanna explore? Carrack, hands down. Wanna gallavant in a Cap ship? Probably Idris. Wanna salvage? Reclaimer. Wanna Cap ship hunt? Tali. Wanna trade and blockade run? Banu.   And so on and so forth. Where does the Starliner fit exactly?   Wanna transport passengers from Point A to Point B? Starliner.   There ya go....cause any other role it could fill can't possibly outclass other ships specializing in whatever role that is.   It would take a whole helluva lot for me to look into my hangar if I did own a Starliner, and willingly opt not to get in my Banu, Phoenix, Idris, Tali, etc. instead...and I don't see anyone choosing any differently either based on what CIG has shown us, which honestly is nothing impressive.  If you're just playing Ash Ketchum and catching 'em all then that's an entirely different story. ;)"
Starcitizen_trades,3bd34t,thecitris,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:38:23 2015 UTC,"I like the Orion, Reclaimer, and Starfarer for their industrial roles - but I'm hoping to be an Explorer.  All those industrial ships are opportunity based money makers for me.  The idea of these opportunities is how I'm gauging my interest in the Starliner, presently.  I'm not going to be a Starliner pilot as a primary career - but the way I see it - when I'm stuck planetside waiting on a Carrack replacement - hopping systems in a Starliner will give me a break from grinding out asteroids, surfing gas giants, or fighting over scrap metal.  It'll all be location based - and if I'm stuck in the right system - I'll get to be a Starliner pilot. :)  The price is prohibitive - but not really - like you stated above, it's already priced right there with everything else that churns out credits.  It now becomes a matter of interest and opportunity."

Starcitizen_trades,3bd34t,livenwealth,2,Sun Jun 28 03:40:11 2015 UTC,I struggle to see how there will be a market for a space bus when everyone has a ship! I could be completely wrong in that most folk will not have a jump drive / ability to travel long distance.  Even with that in mind I can't see the enjoyment of being a passenger for any length of time.  Plus on the flip side as a pilot wiping  passenger's butts is easily the worst mini-game I can think of in a space sim.

I'm really in no hurry to sell, but I do see that you have a purchase on the confirmed trade board.  If you want both, I'll knock another $15.00 off of the total price, but that's as low as I'm willing to go at this time -- especially with this Tali.  Thank you for your interest.

Starcitizen_trades,3b17yn,Goloith,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:44:11 2015 UTC,"Yea I have that too. I bought every accessory even got him to make me a stand alone hotas arm mount for the rightside so if I chose to keep the keyboard on the rightside post I could adjust the keyboard and joystick positions independently so it wouldn't bump into the tray at full stick deflection  If no one buys it I might make use of it eventually it's still the best way to have simultaneous access to keyboard, mouse, foot pedals,and hotas in good positions that I have found.   But I mean I bought mine right around when you got yours and still haven't even used it so it seems like a waste at this point. The only thing I play is counterstrike right now anyway. The main reason I havnt used it yet is I only have 1 24 inch monitor and I'm waiting to check out the upcoming 35 inch curved acer predator z35 I bet it would go great with this volair, but a single 24inch is too small for the distance you sit"

Starcitizen_trades,3axr9s,ripptide111,2,Thu Jun 25 02:49:49 2015 UTC,"The reason the high price is because the Scythe will never again be available for purchase or with LTI. It's a collectors item and is priced as such. People aren't paying for a ship, they are paying for prestige."

Starcitizen_trades,3axr9s,Citizen4Life,0,Wed Jun 24 14:34:01 2015 UTC,"God your attitude is refreshing. Nice to meet you, hope you get your Scythe ;)"
Starcitizen_trades,3axr9s,Citizen4Life,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:39:21 2015 UTC,"First, don't pay attention to stats.  The numbers on the website and even the holotable mean absolutely nothing.  The only stats that matter are whatever they plug into the spreadsheet.   A long time ago I stopped trying to make sense of their 'stats', as they make no logical sense.  A ship that has multiple higher rated engines will be slower than one with a single lower rated engine.  Maneuvering thrusters put out 10x or more thrust than main thrusters.  There are lower tier weapons that do more DPS than much higher rated ones.  Basically, everything is in total flux right now.  Don't pay attention to stats at all.  You can't even rely on descriptions of the ship roles or concept, because that has already changed for multiple ships.  All of that aside, the Scythe will always have huge value simply because they are the only ones that can be insured with hull insurance.  This has been repeated by CIG multiple times over the years and they haven't backed off this.  Now, CIG changes it mind all the time and says that ""new data"" or ""more money"" suddenly means they don't need to keep old promises... but it's hard to say.  Again, they say it will be extremely hard to capture.  The collector value alone is the reason for much of the price you see.  Either way, I see from your post history that you want to buy a Scythe... so clearly this post is a little biased, no? ;)"
Starcitizen_trades,3axr9s,BoredDellTechnician,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:23:36 2015 UTC,"I am? I pay only 300, if someone sell it for thst price. ;)"
Starcitizen_trades,3axr9s,Liudeus,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:35:55 2015 UTC,"Let us know if you snag one! :)  I've definitely noticed a large uptick in interest for buying Scythes lately, especially since the Q&A and new videos.  Clearly people want to get the best value for their dollar and haggling is going to be expected.  But right now a lot of buyers are totally lowballing... sub 1k prices... and thankfully no sellers are taking them up on that.  The Scythe might have dipped a bit in price a while ago (as the entire market has), but with new interest comes stronger prices.  I have a feeling that some people are going to start paying upwards of $1500 again.    It will be interesting to see what happens once it is flyable though.  Like I said, stats mean nothing.  CIG even said that we can't judge the flyable Scythe based on the cannon fodder we've witnessed so far in AC.  The video seemed to indicate it was as fast as an M50 and had some absolutely brutal hardware... but we shall see soon enough! :)"
Starcitizen_trades,3axr9s,jcde7ago,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:21:15 2015 UTC,More than likely the type of person willing to sell a Scythe for $300 will end up melting the ship than selling on the Grey Market.  I would purchase yourself a nice Gladius and capture a Scythe in game.
Starcitizen_trades,3axr9s,Liudeus,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:51:37 2015 UTC,"In addition to ""not being about the stats,"" remember that the number of tradable Scythes is constantly dwindling with each new sale.  And once we get in game, they'll be worth so much that they'll be effectively impossible to obtain (~700 scythes, 2,000,000+ players and growing).  Insurance was conspicuously absent from the Scythe Q&A. While I'm still assuming it's uninsurable, they did call that into question last time."
Starcitizen_trades,3axr9s,BoredDellTechnician,0,Wed Jun 24 15:26:36 2015 UTC,"It's probably closer to ~400-500 Scythes ever sold...~700 seems a bit too high. 300 were sold in the initial batch, and i'll say maybe 100-200 Completionist packages...and that's a big maybe at $15K.   The Scythe will always have value as a Collector's item, no question. It's the lowest-tier Vanduul fighter, and while it won't be a killing machine by any means, i'd still expect skilled pilots to take advantage of its sheer firepower and do really well with it (Size 5 weapons? Goodness).  In the PU though, it'll be nothing more than a Hangar trophy, simply because lots of other larger fighters/ships will instantly outclass it. Flying it around in unsecured space would also put a big target on a player's back once people learn that there's a player-owned Scythe in their instance.  Even though the Javelin and Idris-M were sold in lower quantities than the Scythe (not by much), i'd argue that having the only Vanduul ship in the game with LTI makes it much, much more rare than the aforementioned Capital ships. Everyone can work towards Javelins and Idris-Ms, even if they don't have LTI...Scythe though? Probably not so much. I predict that the Scythe will be the most expensive Hangar trophy in the PU and will command an insane amount of UEC....but whether or not that UEC ever amounts to more than the $1,500 USD Scythes currently sell for on average is hard to predict."
Starcitizen_trades,3axr9s,Liudeus,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:55:34 2015 UTC,"500 were initially sold (300 Kickstarter, 200 website) and I made the same Completionist estimate that you did."

Starcitizen_trades,3aiola,ZombiePotatoSalad,2,Sun Jun 21 01:04:06 2015 UTC,"Well they stated that the role of this thing is going to be between a Constellation Phoenix and 890 Jump.     The thing is that neither of those ships were exactly great sellers, and the whole luxury role is completely undefined.    They would have done beer with a $100 Drake fighter or something along those lines.  Then again people lined up to spend $50 on a news van... so who knows."
Starcitizen_trades,3aiola,ZombiePotatoSalad,2,Sun Jun 21 01:37:26 2015 UTC,HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!  On a News Van!  That kills me.  I still think the reason so many Reliants went on sale is for LTI tokens.  I mean seriously why would I even use a Reliant for the Tech when I have two Xi'an Scouts that are way better?    And I don't want to sound all Tin Foil but don't the Reliant tokens basically mean that CIG get no less than $15 dollars (Likely more) when the ships are flight ready and get CCUs?  It may not seem like much initially but it is money they didn't have before and it may actually be a bit more del;ending upon how much they charge for CCus and Upgrades.    Either way CIG are positioned to make quite a bit in additonal funds everytime a ship becomes flight ready.
Starcitizen_trades,3aiola,ZombiePotatoSalad,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:29:51 2015 UTC,"What do you mean, LTI Tokens? Could you explain the system? I thought if a ship had LTI, it was for that ship only, but the concept of Tokens, at least in the way I am thinking of, allow you to use LTI on any ship you own."
Starcitizen_trades,3aiola,FazedOut,0,Mon Jun 22 12:41:56 2015 UTC,EXACTLY!!!  The reason so many Reliants sold was they are the perfect LTI tokens.  Once any ship is flight ready CCUs are created.  Thanks to CIG's bullshit system they creates a person can take a Reliant and quickly build themselves a a Constellation.  Actually if they really want to go balls out crazy with it they can upgrade up to even an Idris-P or Javelin.  But it won't be as cheap I can assure you as they have to make something of those sales.  So basically you have everyone melting their old non-LTI stuff for upgrades to get the ship they want with LTI because the token retains its LTI status even after being upgraded to a different ship.
Starcitizen_trades,3aiola,nksharp,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:53:34 2015 UTC,"Well then, players wouldn't see a problem with that. The system seems bullshit, but in the player's favor, so I don't hear many people complaining. However, the CCU upgrades still seem to balance out: A Mustang Alpha game package is $45, CCU to Aurora MR is free. Upgrade to a Hornet from Aurora MR is $85.  So you're paying, in this example, $130, $110 for the Hornet, and say the rest is for your various accesses. Same price for going from the MR to the 300i to the Hornet. So you're still spending the same amount of money that you would if you bought the ship standalone, except hey, LTI token to apply to your new ship. (I know, I omitted the Reliant from this example, but I'm doing this under the assumption that buying the Reliant, since it was considered a starter ship, also gave alpha/beta/Arena Commander/etc. access and the like).  So why don't they ""imprint"" the LTI to the ship it comes with? If they figured out all the pricing in such a way that it still adds up to relatively the same cost, why didn't they think of and enact that? Now players will have Idris and Javelin ships with LTI (wait, to call them Tokens implies that they are single use, your ship blows up once, use a Token, it forgoes the cost. Blows up again, you pay it. Is that how it works?)"
Starcitizen_trades,3aiola,LostAccountant,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:18:11 2015 UTC,"And personally, I bought the Reliant not for the hype of a concept sale (I had never before voted on a concept, and never even seen any), but simply because I like how it looked and behaved. I mean, it freaking SPINS (sort of). As Stargate has said, spinning is so much cooler than not spinning (and a psuedo-reason why I might grab a Hull, but mostly because I prefer space trucking to combat, since I suck). I've played Elite Dangerous for a long time, and a lot of those ships look the same, and it's starting to feel a little rehashed. However, in Star Citizen, the ships feel... i guess you could say ""built"" as opposed to ""manufactured"" like in ED (I have Aspergers, so the exact words elude me at times). For example, you can see details in SC ships, pipes, wires, even the warning signs. In ED, for example, every Lakon ship has the exact same dashboard, and it's not even detailed that well. I know it's a transport company, but STILL.   Anyway, I digress. The Reliant, for me, was a purchase of my own will, not of any hype train. It flies and acts like a B-Wing, incorporated alien tech instead of being a ""Standard Human Spaceship,"" is a two seater (as opposed to the other single-seat starters), has decent cargo space for a starter, and looks different from the current stable. I bought it simply because I thought it was cool. (Also, so I would have something better to start with than the Mustang Alpha I got when I bought in. I have a whole two ships. Woo.)   And what do you think the Reliant could CCU into? They still haven't spoken more than vague info on other variants. And if people are melting down their Reliants, it may become a rare ship (most likely not, but I like to collect unique things)."

Starcitizen_trades,3aiola,ZombiePotatoSalad,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:44:35 2015 UTC,"I think it's a tough sell, at least for me.  We just don't know enough about what the PU will be like to make a call about whether a civilian transport will make any sense.  Will there be lots of civilians roaming around who don't have their own jump capable ships and will be willing to pay for a ride?  Are there going to be NPCs lining up to pay for a ride? Will orgs need a way to move large numbers of their members from one place to another?  I don't buy the ""we need to keep cash flow going so that we can do stuff"" excuse.  Plenty of companies (twitter, as an example) have existed for a long time pre-revenue, and had no trouble getting office space and stuff.  It's time for CIG to get out of fund raising mode, put on their big boy pants, and deliver a game now."
Starcitizen_trades,3aiola,Jethro_E7,0,Fri Jun 26 20:42:39 2015 UTC,"Its interesting that you asked those questions cause I have often wondered if I am going to need to ever schedule a ride to get back to home plate say if I have to stage ships somewhere for some operation.  Do I take the chance of going on a Starliner or do I take my chances with an armed transporter?   But I am wondering how the transit lanes are going to be.  A lot are expecting the usual generation of ships just for the look and feel which I find boring.  All the threads and power in a PC alone you mean to tell me that a super expensive multi-CPU server can't be used to totally handle the AI side and chedule missions based on the dynamics of the universe instead of the just creating filler ships?  That is so 2000 - 2013 low quality BS.  With delivering the game now I think they still have a lot of the systems to do yet which are supposed to get worked on starting 2016, right?"
Starcitizen_trades,3aiola,ZombiePotatoSalad,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:59:06 2015 UTC,"I've been involved with other games early on where the developers said that travel would be a thing, then reality hits and people start whining about not being able to instantly join their friends on the other side of the [galaxy, map, whatever], and the devs end up dumbing down travel with some kind of magical teleportation, or in the case of Eve, jump clones and jump drives.  I think the same thing will happen here.  In Chris' imagination, travel will be a thing, but it'll get written out as the reality of game play sets in.  That'll leave a ship like this pretty useless."
Starcitizen_trades,3aiola,Jethro_E7,0,Sat Jun 27 15:56:37 2015 UTC,"OMG this kinda of thing bugs me to know end.  In OpenFalcon/Redviper if the missions were long missions and they took a long time to complete and RTB you still did it because that was part of the experience.  All the past 15 years of lame gaming has done is created a group of instant gratification junkies.  They just want to burn in, complete the task, get paid and level up their gear and ship.  Only a tiny fraction of people really want the full experience."
Starcitizen_trades,3aiola,ZombiePotatoSalad,0,Fri Jul 3 17:52:15 2015 UTC,"Hmm... whether or not the price is justified remains to be seen. I mean hauling passengers, as far as I have seen it in other games, is pretty much running a slider under a picture, and each number represents a person. If they do it differently, say, they are actually AI and players that you can physically see and interact with, that would make it interesting.  How they implement passenger transport will determine that.  For example, the Orion and Reclaimer may be expensive, but they are practical, there's always going to be ore and salvage, so the price can be justified. (I for one intend to try to take a job as a crewman aboard an Orion, if I can).   And what do you mean not enough money was made? For one, they sold a crap-ton of Reliants, so there's the money from that, in addition to all the people who originally backed it As a community funded game, I think it is going extremely well."

Starcitizen_trades,3aiola,The_Stargazer,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:55:58 2015 UTC,"Don't take this the wrong way but how long have you been with the program?  While it should make sense that a number such as +19,000 should scream success, everyone here knows it is still the amount of money brought in that truly decides success.    As INN has layed out on their page, the Reliant is one of those sales that has brought in the least amount of money.  Now taking that into account we then look at the immeadiate Military sale that also brought in very little and should have been a huge red flag given the fact that it didn't occur during the now typical mid-month point but literally following the Reliant sale.  Last year we were lucky if we saw a sale every other month.  Then early in the year we saw them at once a month and now every two weeks.  These facts have not gone unnoticed by people who track these things.  It is also not good when you have a climate that is screaming that big money sales are a money grab so yeah my point stands.  Not enough money was made on the Reliant sale when you typically make approximately $3 Million in sales a month."

Starcitizen_trades,3afkgs,IAmYosh,8,Fri Jun 19 18:53:47 2015 UTC,"They have lost any common sense. 400$ (480 if you have the privilege to live in EU) for a Space Bus ? Damn, even if it was the F8 Lightning 400$ would still be a joke. How long have they been in the Verse to lost any sens of reality. They should go back on earth...

Starcitizen_trades,3afkgs,Nyrmala_Isagar,7,Tue Jun 23 13:03:23 2015 UTC,Why.... Why CIG? Wasn't the Genesis one of the picks that just squeaked through the poll? Why do they think anyone would pay $400 for a bus?
Starcitizen_trades,3afkgs,jester86,2,Fri Jun 19 23:52:23 2015 UTC,Because someone will. I wish they wouldn't. I'd love to see some genuine downward pressure on pricing.
Starcitizen_trades,3afkgs,InertiamanSC,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:06:15 2015 UTC,The downward pressure will surely come after this sale. I bet this will be one of the worst sales (significantly less than 2 million). Everybody is already heavily invested and there is much less psychological liquidity in peoples wallet as we see with down spiraling RSI-value.  It has to be very convincing in scale and proportions for a big ticket item at this stage of development.
Starcitizen_trades,3afkgs,FlyingCondor,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:10:24 2015 UTC,"I predict decent sales on this one, even at $400. Just a hunch, but I have a feeling that it's more than a bus - it's a luxury cruise ship of sorts. It's a cruise ship where NPC passengers will pay lots of money to ride a no-risk starlane traversed by the operator of said cruise ship. All of that means that it will be a (potentially boring) task with little risk and decent profits to be made. Quite a few people are interested in that sort of gameplay."
Starcitizen_trades,3afkgs,mikegold10,7,Sun Jun 21 01:39:01 2015 UTC,"$400 bones for a passenger liner that's going to be a huge target in the verse for pirates...no thanks.  But man, if it's $400 for this...I can see the Corvette being no less than $800-900, costing slightly less than both Idris models.  CIG really shouldn't be doing another concept sale before they can deliver FPS, so i'm hoping FPS has at least a halfway-decent chance of releasing next week. The community is growing tired of sale after sale while there hasn't really been much tangible, playable progress on any other module for quite some time now. This is doing nothing but making them look greedy right now."
Starcitizen_trades,3afkgs,jcde7ago,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:51:28 2015 UTC,I am hoping that this particular concepts sale does not make CIG very much money.  The alure of a $400 space 747 may not have much appeal in the community and the community does is getting weary of sale after sale and no game progress.  Hopefully a bad showing will force CIG to reevaluate their priorities.
Starcitizen_trades,3afkgs,BoredDellTechnician,0,Sat Jun 20 23:45:19 2015 UTC,they do it because they need about 2million a month to pay all the bills and not dip into the rest of the pledge money. it's a long run strategy.
Starcitizen_trades,3afkgs,95688it,3,Sat Jun 20 14:39:58 2015 UTC,"Source on that? I'm not interested in assumptions; we've known about certain ships already in the pipeline like the Starliner, so it's not like it going on sale is a complete surprise (the Crucible, Endeavor, Prowler, Corvette, etc, are all also going to be sold in the near future).  I'm not seeing anyone have an issue with another concept sale in general but, rather, the timing of the sale; when backers haven't seen or played anything new in quite a long, long time, having another Concep sale comes off as a money grab and people are starting to feel like CIG should not be trying to get people to ""donate more money"" via a Concept sale when we haven't seen any playable progress in a long time and things we've all been waiting for that should be out by now are perpetually delayed.  Yes, we all know that concept artists and modelers aren't going to help CIG fix the netcode, but it's all about principle and perception for a lot of backers as well, and right now....CIG looks greedy, and they also chose the wrong ship to sell at the wrong time. $400 for a space bus? Unless the Concept post detailing this thing gives everyone hard-ons in a convincing manner, I can't see a $400 space Greyhound bus selling for the amount of money CIG wants to see come out of a concept sale. They should have just waited until FPS was out to have another Concept sale, if just to give people something new to see besides another Concept ship that won't have any progress made on it for probably a year at least at this point."
Starcitizen_trades,3afkgs,jcde7ago,7,Sat Jun 20 17:10:38 2015 UTC,"http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/3afuzc/genesis_starliner_price_announced_400/cscb5sr  A lovely man but Ben really needs to take a step back from this topic and try and get a new perspective I think. The idea that anyone is doubting the work that goes into the product when they complain about the incremental vs the asking price implies that he's missing the point by an AU. Every sale is a balls out shakedown now, priced not against any coherent measure of value but against the maximum expectation.  Is that wrong? No idea. It's certainly not interesting any more."
Starcitizen_trades,3afkgs,InertiamanSC,2,Sat Jun 20 00:20:58 2015 UTC,The funniest part about this whole fiasco is that they could have waited until FPS was released before doing this sale. Peoples' nerves would have gotten a bit calmer and the backlash they are getting now would be a lot smaller.
Starcitizen_trades,3afkgs,mikegold10,3,Sun Jun 21 01:42:07 2015 UTC,400 notes for a bus. Nope.

Starcitizen_trades,3afkgs,JohnnyCash12,3,Fri Jun 19 21:40:32 2015 UTC,I predict this ship will generate the worst concept sales figures to date.

Starcitizen_trades,3afkgs,mikegold10,7,Fri Jun 19 19:09:27 2015 UTC,"Wow, passenger hauling already sounds awful without that price tag. It's like hauling but people complain more when you say ""the cargo was unruly so I threw it out the airlock.""  That said, these ships aren't just for players, they're for NPCs, so while it's not going to be $500 of fun, it still needs to exist."

Starcitizen_trades,3afkgs,StormMasterBaitor,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:43:16 2015 UTC,"Heads up, this isn't a high end luxury ship like the Phoenix or 890.   I think it is more like a passenger airliner today.   I wouldn't expect much in terms of stats and defensive strengths.   Now it will probably be a decent money maker considering the amount of people it can seat. Good for transporting those that travel 1st class, not really for VIP transport though, that's more for Phoenix or 890 the way I see it."
Starcitizen_trades,3afkgs,THS89,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:48:55 2015 UTC,Is it because it'll come in an armoured transport variant that can unleash a full crew of Dragonflies who then can board and go haywire on FPS breach battles??  .. so what's the Caterpillar for again?
