FinalFantasy,3e23hb,Stradixon,55,Tue Jul 21 10:49:30 2015 UTC,"I have not met one person (in person) that could say they didn't like FFX after a finished playthrough. The biggest criticism I see comes from people watching the laughing scene out of context. There are a few other naysayers, but I personally can't find any merit in their arguments.   There are a few Final Fantasy games that I believe are staples of what the series should be, and X is definitely on that list.  X-2 is different. It certainly loses the grim, semi-serious tone of X. But it does have one of the best (if not the best) ATB style battle systems. Heck, the story even kinda makes sense if you think about it. Yuna was raised in a very solemn world where death was around every corner and thought that her main goal in life was kill Sin even if it meant the death of her guardians and herself.   All of a sudden, that weight it lifted from her shoulders, and she can just live. She's essentially the sheltered kid from high school who finally gets to let loose in college...except she happens go be the worlds biggest celebrity at the same time. With that in mind the mood and atmosphere of FFX-2 makes a little more sense...but doesn't stop the game from being super cheesy. Heck, my WIFE is embarrassed to be caught playing it."
FinalFantasy,3e23hb,Miasma_Of_faith,8,Tue Jul 21 12:23:16 2015 UTC,"I never played FFX-2, because it came out right as I started college. Just started playing it now. Holy CRAP the battle system is awesome. I've played every FF main-numbered game, and hate grinding with a passion, but I find myself battling over and over just to get one more skill.   Also, the feminist in me feels guilty, but this game's outfits are so hot I find the ladies sexy... even as a gay man..."
FinalFantasy,3e23hb,zackiedude,3,Tue Jul 21 15:54:43 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I don't think you should feel guilty! Feminism and sexy aren't mutually exclusive. :D  All of the girls outfits have tons of personality in them and fit each character super well. The girls, to me, seem to have complete agency in these outfits. It also felt like a wonderful callout to the magical girl genre that I grew up loving. As a girl and a feminist, I love every single dress sphere. Nothing to feel bad about!"
FinalFantasy,3e23hb,Marowe,10,Tue Jul 21 19:49:18 2015 UTC,"It was good, but still has quite a few bad points...  Mini games/ sidequests were absolute trash... tedious and not fun at all. Combat was good, but again... you HAD to do an action to get exp... its dumb... even if in your active party, if you didnt do anything, you get nothing.. completely stupid.  Having to constantly switch and defend to prevent characters form falling behind if plain dumb and a big turn off."
FinalFantasy,3e23hb,Abysssion,6,Tue Jul 21 14:10:29 2015 UTC,I just trained 3 and let the others fall behind. I'm far too lazy to use everyone in every battle.
FinalFantasy,3e23hb,redditsoaddicting,2,Tue Jul 21 16:10:47 2015 UTC,I hope one of those 3 was Kimahri. I remember not using him much at all and then you had to do that 1v2 battle against his brothers(?) on Gagazet. Literally had to spend a few hours to build him up b/c I neglected using him the entire game just about.
FinalFantasy,3e23hb,QuestionsEverythang,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:59:06 2015 UTC,Really? I think his brothers scale to Kim's level.  I remember the fight was funny how small each were hitting for while I farmed lvl 3 locks.

FinalFantasy,3e23hb,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:15:51 2015 UTC,"When it first came out I remember being really disappointed. I mean it was a good game and I finished it, but it didn't grip me like the old ones. It didn't help that I was so hyped and reading up on all the magazine info I could leading up to release. Then some of my friends played it as their Final Fantasy debut and praised the hell out of it and im just like ""brahs no, go play the old ones and they will blow your mind"". But let me clarify, because im not dissing the game, it grew on me big time and I have nostalgia for it. It is a really really good game. Not my favorite FF cast, story, or sidequests, but a very nice game. It just isn't the same tier as the PS1 titles which I consider true masterpieces. Blitzball was the shit though. I was so hooked."
FinalFantasy,3e23hb,thoughtlessfox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:27:29 2015 UTC,"Haha blitzball.  I remember thinking, this is dumb, I suck at this, I'm not playing this.

Even guys like you who don't much care for it can at least say    FFX is alright as a game   Now, to be fair, almost all Final Fantasy games are good, and you'll be hard pressed to find any of them that are truly ""bad."""
FinalFantasy,3e23hb,Miasma_Of_faith,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:51:57 2015 UTC,I'm having a really really hard time getting into FFXIII-1. I've more or less given up around chapter 2-3. There are so many characters and they're all really hard for me to connect to.   Super sad considering I preordered it.
FinalFantasy,3e23hb,rinwashere,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:04:58 2015 UTC,"Final Fantasy XIII has a notoriously slow start, and it presents so much information at the start, and doesn't clear it up until later on. Even still, the game is one of my favourites for a couple of reasons. The game really starts to pick up around chapter 5-7, and it genuinely does get waaaay better, even starting in chapter 4 a little. If you are confused about characters and stuff, the datalog helps a little bit, but the only reason I even touched it was because of my OCD."
FinalFantasy,3e23hb,TwistedSword,5,Tue Jul 21 16:49:26 2015 UTC,"Funny thing, FFXIII. I played it, and enjoyed it enough but didn't think it was all that. Played XIII-2 and enjoyed it even more! For some reason I haven't picked up XIII-3 (probably because I got a PS4 and wasn't interested in any more PS3 games) but I did decide to play FFXIII again just for the heck of it and holy crap. Going in knowing what is going on makes you really appreicate the story they tried to present. Going in knowing what is going on totally makes you see Vanille and Hope in a new light. Going in knowing what's going on helps the attitudes and voice acting make so much more sense, instead of what we're used to in most voice-acted things like games and anime.  tl;dr - Really got a much deeper admiration for the first FFXIII on my second playthrough."
FinalFantasy,3e23hb,Jinketsu,2,Tue Jul 21 17:27:49 2015 UTC,"My god, I've found another one!      In all seriousness, I am actually playing through for a second time right now, and you catch so many little details that blow your mind on the second time through.   Sazh: ""What, did you sleep through History or something?"" Vanille: ""Something like that."""
FinalFantasy,3e23hb,TwistedSword,2,Tue Jul 21 17:41:46 2015 UTC,Yeah XIII is really the one that you have to play twice to get the full experience. What I've found is that every deeper understanding about the world of Cocoon and Pulse or the Fal'Cie leaves me loving the game a little more.  Definitely some of the more flushed out but more difficult to understand characters.
FinalFantasy,3e23hb,DrowSpectre,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:52:16 2015 UTC,"Just a heads-up, Lightning Returns is nothing like the first two in terms of gameplay."
FinalFantasy,3e23hb,QuestionsEverythang,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:00:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, I played the demo. I think my second go-around of FFXIII was supposed to get me back into the series to pick XIII-3 up, but then FFXIV came out and my desire to play things on the PS3 drastically waned."
FinalFantasy,3e23hb,Jinketsu,2,Tue Jul 21 20:20:03 2015 UTC,"I can appreciate from a narrative standpoint that nobody in that world would stop and talk about fal'cies and l'cies. But from a player's perspective it felt more like I'm being excluded from their conversation.   Let's compare this to FFX. A huge monster comes out of nowhere and messily devours a city at the moment of triumph. Some guy shows up and says, you gotta deal with this. I don't really need some fancy speak to figure out what's going on.   I'll try to hang in there and get to chapter 5-7 ...! But I keep putting it off. :/"
FinalFantasy,3e23hb,rinwashere,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:03:57 2015 UTC,"Very true and very fair, the game does seem to be pushing an atmosphere of ""look it up yourself, bud"".      The biggest problem is the spread of information between all the different characters. One character will say one thing, and then a chapter later the game will be like ""hey, remember that? Well here's something else that vaguely connects in a tiny way.""      In essence, it's as if the game is giving you the narrative, spliting it into 1000 puzzle pieces, and only giving you a little one every once in a while. But it really does get better, and easier to follow."
FinalFantasy,3e23hb,TwistedSword,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:24:12 2015 UTC,"The best part about FFXIII is the last 25%.  In most other games the last 25% would be at a minimum 50% of the game, while the first 75% would have been 33% of the game, if that makes any sense.  You just completely don't have that feeling of exploration in FFXIII.  At least not until the end.  Stick with it, just blast through as fast as you can.  You'll know when you are at the fun part imho."
FinalFantasy,3e23hb,atcoyou,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:46:45 2015 UTC,"I've not finished FFX, but I'm about 10 hours in and not really enjoying it.  I just feel bored.

Give it another chance, it is quite a shock in the beginning, but you get used to it, and also it changes. In the end, FFX-2 ends up being pretty awesome too, specially if you manage to get a lot of the little side stories with you (you probably would need at least one New Game+ run to get a good amount of them)"
FinalFantasy,3e23hb,aerandir92,11,Tue Jul 21 11:04:20 2015 UTC,"yeah if you can ignore Brother and the girlie girl stuff, then it ends up being alright. As I'm sure it's littered throughout this thread, X-2 has one of the better combat systems in my opinion. I liked that you could change on the fly in battle, instead of having to go someplace or wait till the battle is over to switch. Leveling the abilities was good in my opinion as well. You know now that I'm talking about it, I may go home tonight and start playing it again LOL."

FinalFantasy,3e23hb,illegalblue,-4,Tue Jul 21 17:13:05 2015 UTC,If JRPGs weren't a narrative based genre and it didn't bare the Final Fantasy name X2 would be a good game and a nice distraction.  For people who aren't sociopaths seeing the characters you've grown to love being brutally raped (narrative wise) in front of you is very upsetting.

FinalFantasy,3e23hb,DrowSpectre,6,Tue Jul 21 17:45:03 2015 UTC,"FFX is awesome indeed, but X-2 can be good too if you manage to dig through the initial cringe. Anyway, I spent like 150 hours on each game and regret none of them (except perhaps farming for luck in X and getting 100% story in X-2).  If you want more, X-2 can really be good, and it ties up the loose end. If you don't like it, it's understandable, since... heh. Sorta cringe.  However, I don't remember its exact title, but the ""bonus audio"" is not something you want to hear, unless you really need to cry."

And then got burnt out right after the last fight with Seymour, the difficulty spike of that last area (I think it's the last area anyway) didn't help either, that was around 6 months ago. still meaning to get back to it but I'm half way through literally every ff game that I haven't finished, except XII which I bought the other day and should arrive soon, I'll probably end up starting that too. Hoping to get back to X soon though, I agree it's an amazing game, has some of the best characters in the series imo.  Tldr: I need to finish games before starting more :("
FinalFantasy,3e23hb,flaahgra012,2,Tue Jul 21 13:07:45 2015 UTC,I just bought it on Friday night to give it another whirl over the weekend. I got in 12 hours. I fucking love this game. I think FF7 and FFX are a tie for me. I played through FF7 when it launched on Steam and although I remembered most of the game I was surprised about how much I had forgotten. With FFX I barely remember anything - which is awesome because I know I'm in for a great ride!
FinalFantasy,3e23hb,lolligaggins,2,Tue Jul 21 13:31:59 2015 UTC,"When you strip it down to its basic elements (i.e., remove the fluff), X-2 is actually really good. The combat system in particular impressed me, enough to be of the opinion that it would suit the upcoming remake of FF7 quite well. It's modern and fast-paced but retains enough of the ATB system to still feel like a PS1-era Final Fantasy."
FinalFantasy,3e23hb,DrTee83,2,Tue Jul 21 15:11:14 2015 UTC,Play ffx-2 more then 10 minuets maybe chapter 3-5 will be the game changer for you. Chapter 1-2 are trash tier bad but the last few are really good.
FinalFantasy,3e23hb,ArchadiesTv,2,Tue Jul 21 15:49:19 2015 UTC,"X, VII, IX, and XII are my personal favorites. There are fans of just about every Final Fantasy game in existence so of course there are gonna be haters of certain games too. I'm not huge on VI even though it is the apparent nirvana of Final Fantasy games, and that's totally fine. That's what makes final Fantasy so cool. It's a franchise that will always be familiar but also different in every iteration."
FinalFantasy,3e23hb,Clintsworth,3,Tue Jul 21 18:08:56 2015 UTC,"Normally when people say what FF is their favorite, it is most likely the first one they ever played. I have personally played FF games since IV and I can honestly say that X is my favorite (tied with IX). The story is amazing, play system is great and the graphics were awesome back in the day. Only critisism I could ever give it is the fact that it's a bit too linear and there isn't proper over world like in previous games.  X-2 is game that shouldn't even exist. They obviously targeted girls as audiance without realizing that girls already enjoyed ""normal"" Final Fantasy games. Now they just made it cringe worthy for everyone else... and for the most girls too."

I think by default anyone who has played online would have to list that game as their favorite.  The sheer number of hours... offline players just don't understand when you measure your playtime in months and years.  I played for over a decade, and built up more than a year of actual playtime... probably over 2 years is listed thanks to some afk time.  Sadly knowing what I know has kept me away from XIV, as I don't have the time for mmorpgs these days with a family/daughter."
FinalFantasy,3e23hb,atcoyou,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:58:07 2015 UTC,"FF VI is what made me a true video gamer. It forever changed my world in the 5th grade when i first played on a rental from blockbuster. I saw the awesome looking box for months always with the game rented out, finally 1 day it was there in stock.   It was so hard to understand it as a 9 year old. When i was playing a new game i nearly got to vargas and got poisoned. I had no idea how to cope with it and the screen spazzing, i reloaded my save point. It's what forced me to attempt to analyze games logic, not just mechanics like working through a level of Super Mario or Donkey Kong. FF3 then lead me to Zelda A Link to the Past, Chrono Trigger, Secret of Evermore, FF2 (man was that game hard) [all games beat on snes], Earthbound [beat on an emulator], and Tactics Orge [still never finished]"

FinalFantasy,3e23hb,forte3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:24:45 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, you need to play FFVI.  Like CT, it has lots of little extras and side quests that you never need to even go near to finish the game.   Like CT you can also rush through the game and miss a lot, and the final fight will be a challenge, or you can level up, and level all your characters and grind away and ""100%"" the game and try to find everything.  In particular I really enjoyed the parts where you split up into multiple parties.  It adds an interesting strategy element, as in most cases you will have weaker parties and stronger parties, depending on who you have leveled up, and how you have distributed your power houses.  It is a long game though.  If it were half the size I would have been satisfied lol.  Don't want to ruin anything... though I am not sure any game from 1990s has gone unspoiled for people at this point.  Side note: What a game earthbound was.  I still have images of those postcards haha."

FinalFantasy,3e23hb,Dan_Tsukasa,5,Tue Jul 21 13:17:14 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this.  The combat system is one of the strongest in the series.  The job system extremely fun to play and progress through, even if its presentation is as a game of girls' costume dress up.    The story - at least the bits you get to experience few and far between - is also pretty solid and a worthy complement to that of FFX.  Unfortunately, the player experience of the main story comprises about 3% of the actual game.  During the rest of the time you're running around completing goofy side quests, which is what can put so many players off."

The dress sphere idea works, but sadly all of us just wanted more of the battle system of X.  I will say I preferred the dress sphere system to the system in XIII.  I had fun with XIII and -2 but just liked x-2's implementation a little better, as it wouldn't have, forced you to play sentinel yourself for example (thanks to crappy ai mostly that would use the regen move 4 times, when you could use it once and it would continue regening throughout the four moves anyway.... so might as well guard... but I digress...)  I think as the first real sequel to a FF game, FFX-2 got a lot of slack.  I actually find it incredible that SE didn't (just Squaresoft back then iirc?) just reuse the same old engine.  It is somewhat funny that much of the criticism stemmed from that.  I suppose the other criticism was the artistic direction.  It was on purpose, and it worked for some and not others."

FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,MarylandMaverick,21,Tue Jul 21 02:04:15 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I actually like the new models they used in AC. I'd be excited to see them reimagine the original designs in the newer AC style.  This coming from a guy who's played FF7 to 100% completion four times."
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,Midgar-Zolom,11,Mon Jul 20 21:05:03 2015 UTC,"From what I remember from the reveal trailer, it looked like Cloud had his original FF7 clothing on. Whether that stays the same has yet to be seen. I'd prefer the original clothing mostly because of how varied the colors seemed to be (purple Cloud, green/brown Barrett, white Tifa, Blue Cid, Red Aeris, etc.) Advent Children, while awesome character design, all seemed very gray-ish and dull. Idk, I'm being nitpicky."
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,joshua_nash,19,Mon Jul 20 21:09:24 2015 UTC,"Everyone's original game outfits are far better than the AC stuff. You could tell that everyone was wearing what little they could afford living out in the slums; there was a real cool cyberpunk thing going on there. I mean, sure, Cloud and the gang look nice in AC, as well, but now it looks like everyone took a trip to the local Hot Topic."
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,d6__,8,Mon Jul 20 21:14:37 2015 UTC,"I mean, also Cloud kinda needs to be wearing his SOLDIER uniform for obvious plot reasons."
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,Kasmblam,3,Tue Jul 21 01:11:59 2015 UTC,"Oh no, I agree entirely! That's my one beef with AC, is that it seems so washed out. Cid's shirt was kinda greyish-blue, Red Thirteen was more of a dull burnt orange...I hope they bring back the vibrant colors of FF7.  Think back about how many vivid colors there were in the original game, just in the backgrounds alone! The tones and palette were deeply varied. I hope they bring that back to the remake."
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,Zoklar,-1,Mon Jul 20 21:24:09 2015 UTC,I liked some of the models alright except for whatever the actual fuck happened to make Red XIII share 50% of his DNA with Lumpy Space Princess

FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,eternalaeon,28,Mon Jul 20 20:27:44 2015 UTC,"I really don't want it to be the same exact game. I want to see a dynamic camera so we can see the areas we already know in a whole no new perspective. The characters should reflect that as well. If the characters are based off of the old blocky popeye models I will be dissapointed. I really want this game to look graphically up to par with XIII/XV. I think there are better ways to give homage to the original. Again if it is just an unlockable(more likely DLC) whatever, but if that's all they do that would be pretty lame."
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,d6__,5,Mon Jul 20 20:48:12 2015 UTC,"I'd be hoping for bringing the combat system into the modern age as well. Not sure how popular this opinion would be, but after playing more recent games and then playing VII, it felt like I was just pressing buttons that weren't necessarily what I wanted to do because I felt rushed and didn't have time to assess the situation properly."
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,lskennedy,12,Mon Jul 20 20:55:49 2015 UTC,"I want in battle switching like X, but definitely want it to be ""old school"" turn based. No auto play where you don't even get to control your characters"

FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,Regendorf,4,Tue Jul 21 02:05:37 2015 UTC,"If you put the ATB mode on wait it pauses all actions while you are in the menu(I can't remember exactly how it works in VII, but in VIII if you were picking a target, or in the GF/Draw/Magic menu nothing would happen not even the ATB bars would charge).  I also agree with the revamped battle system, but honestly if they kept it similar with a more appealing UI and maybe some new combat mechanics I wouldn't be to upset."
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,d6__,2,Mon Jul 20 21:01:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the fact you could do active or wait is often forgotten.  For slower/casual players, it's great. For more speedy/tense players, then active all the way!"
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,SilentLettersSuck,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:31:17 2015 UTC,"There is also a ""recommended"" setting, but I have no idea what that does but it's probably a combination of both. I typically use active at the start of the game when there are very few commands and as the game progresses I will switch it to wait(usually so I have time to find an item to use in my unorganized item inventory, and yes I do know there is an auto-sort feature but I get used to the busted order of items)"
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,d6__,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:45:50 2015 UTC,"It is a combination, it's active but certain actions temporarily stop the clock (I think mainly it stops during the more elaborate animations like summons, spells, and limits, but I'm not positive.)"
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,SilentLettersSuck,3,Tue Jul 21 02:13:18 2015 UTC,Found this on Gamefaqs:    Wait = Time stops during battle animations and while you're selecting something in the Item/Magic/Summon menu in battle.  Recommended = Time stops during battle animations.  Active = Time stops during Summons only.
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,d6__,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:43:39 2015 UTC,"The thing i really want they get rid off is the random encounters, playing VI again i got really tired of walking 10 steps while fighting 9 times. Persona 3 or Trails in the sky (or FFXIII for what it's worth) is a more appealing system to me, i want to see the fights i'll have and be able to avoid them if i wish without using materia or something."
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,SilentLettersSuck,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:29:28 2015 UTC,"I think XIII-2 had the best system where instead of having roaming monsters like in XIII or P4G(only one I've played) the enemies would appear randomly but you could still just run away from them(in most situations) if you just wanted to get from point A to B. One thing I really like about VIII(my all time favorite game) is that you can get ENC-None(no encounters) so early. Even in X-2 you can get the charm bangle/bracelet in the first chapter. But yes I agree, with the technology in gaming now I'd be disappointed if we just got a screen wipe into battle mode again"
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,joshua_nash,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:35:17 2015 UTC,So much better than just hitting autobattle
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,eternalaeon,2,Mon Jul 20 21:36:13 2015 UTC,Auto-battle isn't that useful later in the game(in both XIII and XIII-2). Early on in XIII the battles are pretty dull as you have a VERY limited choice of actions to take which makes it seem like there is no point to not select auto-battle but in the last I'd Say 3rd of XIII it becomes nearly useless.
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,thekarateguy,2,Mon Jul 20 21:52:02 2015 UTC,"Eh? Maybe in post game? I easily beat the story with autobattle only. All you had to really control was which paradigms were out. Get SAB and buffer class out, apply what you can, COM/RAV to deal damage and get some heals from MED when needed."
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,thekarateguy,3,Mon Jul 20 22:08:33 2015 UTC,"I shouldn't have said useless, just not efficient. Especially with SAB and SYN auto-battle tends to pick a set order of buffs/debuffs that may or may not work for which ever fight. I always found manually selecting actions to be a lot of fun and really adds to the experience, instead of using auto-battle as a crutch."
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,TadaaSuperDan,2,Mon Jul 20 22:19:14 2015 UTC,If you used Libra they would only cast buffs/debuffs that applied on the enemy. The AI was pretty smart.
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,akebeth,2,Tue Jul 21 08:48:30 2015 UTC,"well if it was an easter egg/unlockable skin I'd be okay with it, but if its the main graphics then I not interested in buying it."

FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,rd_Mars,4,Mon Jul 20 20:28:51 2015 UTC,Was expecting someone to say that. Am not disappointed.
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,kirkum2020,15,Mon Jul 20 20:30:21 2015 UTC,That is my biggest fear as well. I hope they remember he was sort of a smart-ass in the beginning and pretty cocky. It's ok for him to slowly change to confused/angry towards the end because that makes sense. Please don't make him like Advent Children Cloud :(
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,akebeth,18,Mon Jul 20 20:31:12 2015 UTC,"Cloud had his ""I don't care give me my money"" attitude at the start but that changed into sad confused depressed broken Cloud in not too long.  Which is fine, that's part of the story, but I have never seen Cloud as a character with much personality. And then VIII came out and Squall was like Cloud but even more mopey.  I think I liked IX because Zidane was just some womanizer who had a good heart and wasn't all mopey for the majority of the game."
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,burytheblade,22,Mon Jul 20 21:24:57 2015 UTC,"Thing is,.squall was just an angsty teen, not an adult.  It's too often forgotten that his mopey persona was majorly social anxiety, kid was bad with girls, with friends, with everyone. And when he tried, it was awkward as fuck.  Does everyone just want a smooth talking protagonist who blows shit up while walking away? I'd rather see these characters, and there cast around them. Rinoa was supposed to be his polar opposite, they are a character set, his stoic to her volume. That was their design."
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,Owyn_Merrilin,7,Mon Jul 20 21:35:50 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, and I agree with you completely.  My point is that, played sequentially, the mopey protagonist gets old quickly. I loved VIII, but I couldn't get into it until way after its release because I was tired of being pulled down by the protagonist.  IX was like a breath of fresh air when I played it way back when and I think that's why it stuck with me the longest."
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,xenthum,6,Mon Jul 20 21:42:17 2015 UTC,"I got to the end of disc 3 of ix and just felt no attachment to anyone.  I wanted to like the game, and perhaps I was too young, but I had already beaten 7 and 8, so perhaps not.   I plan to try again someday, holding out for a pc port"
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,Sturdge666,2,Mon Jul 20 21:44:46 2015 UTC,"Speaking of Disc 3s, I can never play Disc 3 of VIII without crying at a certain scene. The song for it is just too good. ;-;"
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,TadaaSuperDan,2,Tue Jul 21 13:04:47 2015 UTC,Thank you
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,GTKashi,2,Tue Jul 21 19:43:45 2015 UTC,"I have never seen Cloud as a character with much personality   The reason people saw mopey emos and wooden leads is because Square has always left the main character somewhat blank.  They didn't give them much personality because you're playing an RPG: that guy/girl's supposed to be you to a point.  Am I right in thinking Chrono actually had no dialogue of his own?  Square weren't the only ones to do it, Zelda and Pokemon are the two most obvious examples that come straight to mind.  It's still pretty common.  The only reason we're seeing SE make more compelling leads is because we expect a modern FF game to be an epic movie as much as it is a game.  Maybe more even."
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,jaistuart,6,Mon Jul 20 22:07:16 2015 UTC,"They didn't give them much personality because you're playing an RPG: that guy/girl's supposed to be you to a point.   I disagree, with VIII it played into the character. Squall was a mopey awkward teen, that was his character. Cloud was suffering from amnesia and that might be why he was more of a blank. (the amnesia plot is over played, but that's another topic, VI also had it)  Zidane was crafted with huge personality.  I mean sure, the earlier games were more like Dragon Quest, but IV really saw personality start coming through in their main characters.  I don't know why Square has this affinity toward mopey characters, but I don't think it has to do with putting yourself into the shoes of the main character. Link isn't mopey and you do just that. (Incidentally my favorite Link is Wind Waker, which is FILLED with personality without saying single word.)"
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,rd_Mars,6,Mon Jul 20 22:24:49 2015 UTC,"Also, they're quite popular in Japan for some reason.  Since the VII/VIII era, detached/indifferent/mopey characters are a hit among youth.  They're a dime a dozen in anime.  Squall and Cloud aren't blank slates at all; they're that specific type to a T.  Why popular?  Something something disillusionment with the world bla bla bla etc. I think was the last hypothesis."
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,caprisa,5,Mon Jul 20 23:18:31 2015 UTC,"I disagree, Enix likes blank slate protagonists (Which is why literally every Dragon Quest game has a silent protagonist), but Squaresoft was much more into making them characters in their own right, starting with Final Fantasy II and only expanding from there. Chrono Trigger was kind of an unofficial collaboration between Square and Enix when they were both at their height (Square basically got the Dragon Quest team on loan for that one), and it has a lot of Dragon Quest-esque touches, of which Chrono being a silent protagonist is an example."
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,4rkless,3,Tue Jul 21 02:09:32 2015 UTC,Squall is the furthest a character can be from a blank slate.
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,MidgarZolom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:28:31 2015 UTC,"Square has always left the main character somewhat blank.   Uh, with I, III, and V maybe. Although I and III have excuses. Haven't played V in ages so cannot remember much about Bartz so not going to talk about it.  But other than that no, they really didn't. Cecil has a lot of emotion and character, especially after Mount Ordeals. Terra has a lot of character and back story, Cloud is fairly blank at the start because it matches the storyline. Squall is an angsty teenager who doesn't understand the world or his emotions. Square most certainly did not enjoy blank characters much, especially in the Final Fantasy series."
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,Midnytoker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:08:48 2015 UTC,Totally agree. FF9 is my 2nd favorite in the series. I just hope they keep Cloud likeable.
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,MidgarZolom,13,Mon Jul 20 21:51:26 2015 UTC,"Enough happens between VII and Advent Children that his attitude makes sense. Think of what's happened to this guy: years of his life have been a lie. His hometown still destroyed, without so much as a gravesite for his mother. His mind was too weak to stop Aerith's death, which happens right in front of him. In spite of finally stopping Jenova and preventing Meteor from landing, he is slowly being eaten away by geostigma, along with much of the population, including children who he attempts to help. Death hangs all around him and he feels powerless to stop it.  Cloud in Crisis Core is perfectly normal around Zack, though he gets quiet at Nibelheim, no doubt because he's embarrassed to have failed to make it into Soldier before seeing Tifa again. Then his town is burned down and Sephiroth impales him, but he musters the rage to, in what by all rights would have been the last thing he ever did, overpower Sephiroth. Then he spends the next four years as a science experiment, and the next time his now muddled mind becomes lucid he watches his best friend, or the closest thing he has to one, die in front of him.  The only thing hard to justify about Cloud's behavior post VII is how so many fans seem to have retconned it into the original game all by themselves."
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,Midnytoker,5,Tue Jul 21 01:14:19 2015 UTC,"This is an excellent post, thanks a lot.  I think a lot of it is the fact that emo Cloud (excuse the term) is tied to/is such a memorable part of the Cloud experience in FF7--people remember that, then they see how he acted in AC and think he was emo the entire way, when he actually had a bit of growth as a character.  His state in AC is a part of that growth; he regresses slightly, but he has Geostigma.  I do feel that they could have presented that facet in a better way in AC--I think it would have done a lot if they had showed how exactly the sickness had affected him.    In AC they basically stated that it did affect him, but not really ""how"" (well, they did subtly).  I think it would have been great if you saw FF7's endstate Cloud helping out the kids, generally being confident and awesome, and then contracting the illness.  They could have tied in a lot more of his backstory, especially for non-game fans to show you that ""this is why the hero of the movie thinks his life sucks so much."""
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,MidgarZolom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:06:47 2015 UTC,"I agree. Excellent post. The whole reason they played to his ""emo""ness so much in AC is to reinforce his development at the end: ""Cloud Smiles"""
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,Midnytoker,2,Tue Jul 21 19:51:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you for saying this, I'm really confused as to how anyone can think he'd be totally fine once everything is over.  He's been through so many traumatic events and it shouldn't faze Cloud at all?"
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,4rkless,14,Tue Jul 21 08:10:26 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is something people don't fully understand, about a persons evolution.  First off, when ff7 starts, you are essentially Zack.  Cloud's memories are that of Zack, Zack was a brash, cocky mother fucker. Hence why cloud, was initially a brash, cocky mother fucker.  Then he became EMO, why you ask? Well it's quite simple really. How would you feel, after living years as something. You found out all of your memories are fake, and you actually have no clue who you really are. And constantly fight that battle, 100% of the day, all the while, hotties like Aeris get stabbed, a hottie you're in love with but don't know why....  Tell me who here wouldn't be super emo if that's the life you now live..... So no there is no ""Cloud1"" and ""Cloud2"". The character of cloud just simply evolved, which is a good trait in story telling."
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,Zenrot,12,Mon Jul 20 22:52:52 2015 UTC,"Except aside from some midgame mindfucks he gets over it and pulls together, bangs Tifa, beats the baddy, and Chills with his Bros. He isn't emo in ff7 (aside from his midgame mope and he overcomes that.)"
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,thekarateguy,2,Mon Jul 20 23:38:35 2015 UTC,"Geostigma.  In AC he is free of GeoStigma for all of 20 minutes or so of the actual movie (which is mostly fighting).  He doesn't have time to be a cocky joking asshole when he knows the single most powerful enemy he has ever fought might return. He obviously has confidence during the fights, which is evident when he fights Kadaj (and even with Sephiroth).  People are being overcritical of that movie, its not meant to be a full representation of Cloud's character and I don't think SE ever intended it to be seen that way.  The game is the full representation, the Movie is a short period of time 2 years later."
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,ginja_ninja,3,Tue Jul 21 15:33:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly. He isn't an emo character. At ALL in the game (excepting the midgame mindfucks, black materia and hojo, and even then it's mind control and self doubt, not emo sadness) AC portrayed him as distant from all of his friends and lover and had him trying to retreat from the world. So much so that Vincent (FUCKING VINCENT, THE MOST SEALED FROM THE WORLD DUDE EVER. GOT SO DEPRESSED HE SAT IN A COFFIN 24/7FOR YEARS) gave him advice to trust in his friends or something.   /rant."
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,thekarateguy,2,Tue Jul 21 15:39:50 2015 UTC,"Right but there is good reason for that type of behavior, the guy is basically dying of super-planet-cancer  and so is the rest of the planet.  He basically views the events of the game as pointless 2 years later, because the planet and its people are still dying.  Its only after his Geostigma is cured that he actually regains his confidence (which somehow everyone missed despite the many indications at the end of the movie that he had ""returned"")"

FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,redditmode,4,Tue Jul 21 01:14:06 2015 UTC,I agree with you to an extent. That IS called character development.   I'm just saying that I wouldnt be surprised if they rewrite him as mopey ol' emo boy right from the get-go.

FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,rd_Mars,2,Tue Jul 21 10:43:20 2015 UTC,"Well if I learned that my entire life was a lie AND my true love got run through by my arch nemesis, I'd be pretty down too.   I'm just hoping that they dont make him mopey and sad at the beginning of the game, before he has any reason to be, just because its ""cool"" and ""edgy"" in Japan."
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,thekarateguy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:41:21 2015 UTC,"True love? BRUH.  But the thing you don't seem to realize about Cloud is that's what he was like as a kid too. He's like that in the flashbacks. He has a massive inferiority complex, low self-esteem, and crippling social anxiety. He wants to be a hero like Sephiroth so badly because it will give him a sense of self-worth around others, mostly just Tifa, but is so embarrassed by the perceived mediocrity he embodies when he fails to make SOLDIER that he can't even bring himself to show his face when he returns to Nibelheim.  Having Zack's personality imprint on him gives him the strength to actually be the hero and come out of his shell, and Tifa's support is what allows him to come to terms with his past and stop feeling ashamed.  But when it's all over, he's not the hero anymore. He doesn't have a bad guy to fight, he doesn't have plans to make or a goal to rally people around. Just life. And the old Cloud slowly comes fading back in. He realizes he still can't just normally associate with people when there's no mission. He gradually convinces himself that since he doesn't know what to say or do around ""normal"" people, that they don't really want him around anyway. That they were just his teammates, not his friends.  That's Cloud in his natural state. That's what he struggles with at his core more than anything else."
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,rd_Mars,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:39:19 2015 UTC,"What you don't seem to understand is that I'm talking about the type of character Cloud was at the beginning of FF7, before all that sad shit came about and before he realized his whole life was a lie.   I'm saying it will be annoying as shit if I have to deal with him being an emo-bitch before he even has reason to be."
FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,Narc24,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:54:18 2015 UTC,"I mean, c'mon, your best friend died at your front by Shinra soldiers, you had low self-esteem, you were blamed by the townsfolk when Tifa almost died, you considered yourself an idiot because of Tifa's group, you didn't have any friends during your childhood (?, I'm not sure if Cloud had any friends during his childhood before meeting Tifa, so correct me if I'm wrong), you cloudn't join SOLDIER and that's all you wanted because you wanted some people recognizing you, you were mako poisoned with some serious side effects, you attempted to murder your lover (sure, Cloud was being controlled by Jenova but still), you saw your lover die right at your front, you saw your idol who you admired very much become a fucking insane person because people lied to him about his mother, etc., I find it unbelievable that you wouldn't be depressed and sad all the time.  I didn't finish FF7 yet but that's what happened in the game so far (grinding for the boss with 2 arms in the Junon Underwater Reactor), at least from my understanding. Still."

FinalFantasy,3dyjzf,onlysane1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:52:53 2015 UTC,Well... I didn't watch AC or play the other games in the FF7 universe so I don't know how mopey he is in these parts.

FinalFantasy,3e37kk,Cavenmeo,2,Tue Jul 21 18:29:57 2015 UTC,I always thought that when he was with Zack right after they escaped Shinra mansion Zack most likely talked about what happened previously in Nibelheim. Coupled with what Cloud saw for himself it caused major confusion and erased Zack from the story completely giving us what he told the party in Kalm. I don't think he's much of a liar in that regard.
FinalFantasy,3e37kk,Cane_TFL,2,Tue Jul 21 18:49:29 2015 UTC,"You're not crazy. Both had Jenova cells and were infused with mako, so in that sense they were ""clones"" in that their genetic makeup was altered artificially. Further, Cloud was originally discarded by Hojo as a failed experiment.   Always makes for an interesting storyline!"

FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,Weenercopter,16,Tue Jul 21 15:06:06 2015 UTC,"Because XIII not only has less towns and interaction with the world, more enclosed areas and more boringly long areas that are made out of seemingly just narrow corridors, but hides and compensates its linearity much worse than X does.  So yes, it's what you said, in addition to other things as well."
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,Zaeh,28,Tue Jul 21 15:13:41 2015 UTC,"Final Fantasy X feels much less linear because 1) the places you go are much more diverse 2) those areas are populated with all kinds of people besides your own party and 3) very different and unusual events happen in those places. In Final Fantasy XIII, it's just you running through a forest, running through a cave, running through whatever the fuck pretty landscape is next. You are alone. There is no interaction besides the occasional cutscene between party members. You are literally just dungeon-crawling, but in a gussied-up dungeon.  In Final Fantasy X, you are not only traveling through the wilderness. You are visiting towns big and small, one filled with people abuzz with blitzball, one with people scattered around, shell-shocked with half of its population desecrated. You are traveling on populated highways with a distinct history, you are coming upon people preparing for war, sympathizing with all of them, and then experiencing a total slaughter before moving on. You are visiting temples with puzzles to be solved. The people of Spira actually have an effect on the party members, and vice versa. Each wilderness is unique - Macalania Forest is not your average forest. Mt. Gagazet is not just a random mountain, but a mountain that is holy and sad, littered with dead people's belongings. Every single location is intertwined with the worldbuilding. You never feel disconnected from Spira or its people."
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,wallabingbing,5,Tue Jul 21 15:53:15 2015 UTC,Spira is why I love FFX. It feels like the most concrete and developed world. I feel connected as a player and an observer. Some of those designs are beautiful.
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,Clintsworth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:36:43 2015 UTC,"Well it is kinda hard to interact with people who know your face and want to see you dead. And it's also hard to do that on a planet that has not a single living soul upon it. That's what XIII is about, being outcast and hated for no reason while still trying to save the people who fear you. There simply is no believable room for what you have in X."
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,R4zael,8,Tue Jul 21 16:38:07 2015 UTC,"The way you say that, it's like it's some unchangeable thing that can't be faulted. The developers chose to make FFXIII that way, and a lot of people didn't like it. I'm just explaining why it was unlikable and why most people don't complain about the same linearity in FFX. In my opinion, the FFXIII developers totally messed up when it came to this. Mainstream players don't dig dungeon crawling, and that's exactly what FFXIII was."
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,wallabingbing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:06:17 2015 UTC,I have no idea why people are downvoting you for sharing your interpretation.  Thanks for your response.
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,Mere-chan,0,Tue Jul 21 20:35:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with you 100% Idc what any one says, they are equally linear. The plot for XIII required the recluciveness of the pcs, whereas X's plot was literally the opposite. The counter being that the game was written that way etc and it's the devs' fault , but what's wrong with that? I thought it was refreshing and a nice change. As much as I love Final Fantasies, let's face it, the plot lines can be a bit repetitive or mirror older ones. To say FFXIII has a bad storyline is somewhat ignorant. Opinions are not facts. Many people, myself included, love the storyline and rich lore. They wouldn't have made 2 sequels if it was so hated.  And anyways, I'm currently replaying X on the ps4, and the constant cutscenes in the open world are annoying to me (I definitely don't remember it being that bad). And, that being said, having played every numbered FFs numerous times, FFX is my second favorite, VI being number 1. If there was as much npc interaction in XIII, people would have complained about that too."
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,Laragon,7,Tue Jul 21 19:18:48 2015 UTC,Probably all the enclosed areas.
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,scorptatious,6,Tue Jul 21 15:08:44 2015 UTC,"X always made me feel I was going on a pilgrimage across the land. Yeah, it was linear, but there were at least plenty of towns, interesting locales, and set pieces that made me feel I was on a journey.  XIII didn't really give me that kind of feeling."
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,bakuhatsuda,6,Tue Jul 21 17:16:16 2015 UTC,"X allowed you to backtrack and had a lot more variety in its side content. XIII's one sidequest was Cieth missions, which often just had you running back and forth trying to find different stones to fight monsters. It felt accomplishing to beat all of them, but I just wanted something else as well."
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,robbiethedarling,10,Tue Jul 21 18:19:14 2015 UTC,"Because it is. The variety of locations is much more diverse in X, there are several incredibly substantial minigames, and there are story diversions abound to sink your teeth into if you don't feel like going forward. Until Gran Pulse, FFXIII gives you nothing more to do than run from point A to B to progress the story and doesn't even allow full control of your party build until then IIRC. So while it is linear I do not agree that X is ""hallway"" linear in the same sense that XIII is."
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,AtticusWeiss,3,Tue Jul 21 15:59:02 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I have no idea why people still try to put forth this argument. It's like trying to call a stick and a tree the exact same thing."

It is just as linear but it at least tries to distract from the fact."
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,zaviex,8,Tue Jul 21 15:58:13 2015 UTC,"There were no sidequests or any kind of minigames in 13. Once 10 opened up there were a lot of optional things to do, not so much in 13. Although I do agree, they are both ""linear"" especially when placed alongside 1-9."
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,PrimalPower,-2,Tue Jul 21 15:26:50 2015 UTC,"There are tons of side quests in gran pulse. If you didnt do them, you've missed plenty of extra content and some cool character development videos"

FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,teepsy,2,Tue Jul 21 16:07:06 2015 UTC,"I liked XIII, don't get me wrong, but to consider battles a minigame on top of battling all the time doesn't really break up the monotony."
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,zaviex,11,Tue Jul 21 20:48:42 2015 UTC,"Forgive me if my memory has failed me, but I remember FF13 to be a combination of 1 directional corridors, followed by a cinematic and an underwhelming boss fight in that order throughout the entire duration of the game.  I'd say it's as linear as Super Mario Brothers but without the option to go down any pipes."
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,Eldin89,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:32:13 2015 UTC,except for you know the giant wide open field with 70 side quests in it.
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,zaviex,7,Tue Jul 21 16:04:46 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the 70 side-quests weren't until you are 12/13ths of the way through the game, and they were really 70 stages of 1 side quest. If you read the stones it was a bit more interesting but still not very engaging. I think the core problem with 13, that wasn't seen as much in 10, was variety and character. I am not hating on 13 as I enjoyed the game for what it was, but it wasn't very diverse and it didn't give the sense of being in a full park that 10 (or previous games) did and instead gave you the feeling of being on a guided tour with a food court just before the exit."
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,WorldOneWon,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:57:49 2015 UTC,12/13ths? You mean 1/3? They are accessible at the start of chapter 11 which is about 20ish hours out of 60 into the game. Granted most are post game content but you can start earlier than that
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,wallabingbing,4,Tue Jul 21 19:06:17 2015 UTC,Shhhh we're circlejerking about how bad XIII is  DAE XIII WORST GAME?
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,AtticusWeiss,8,Tue Jul 21 17:03:19 2015 UTC,"Yep, answering the question posed in the thread is circle-jerking, mm-hmm. The question is about literally the worst aspect of Final Fantasy XIII; of course it's going to be criticized. I don't even dislike Final Fantasy XIII as a whole but I sure as hell hated this particular part of it."
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,Bsharpmajorgeneral,2,Tue Jul 21 17:30:19 2015 UTC,"Except that it's really not as linear. X actually gives you a reason to go left or right lol. They are both linear, yes, but not to the same degree. XIII is literally just corridors the entire way to Gran Pulse. X had places like the temples and the Guado village that broke up the monotony."
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,AtticusWeiss,3,Tue Jul 21 20:10:45 2015 UTC,"From the good bit of X I played, and beating XIII, I can confidently say that X is more open and explorable. The only difference that X has from something like VII or VIII is that there's no world map. XIII takes that and streamlines it even more."
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,KillerBozo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:17:49 2015 UTC,I guess for me I just felt like I was walking down and endless Hallway with people I didn't like.
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,Gold_Jacobson,2,Tue Jul 21 20:37:45 2015 UTC,"Because when X came out, there wasn't a huge desire for every game people played to be open world. So people didn't complain much about it and there are also several other problems people have with 13 and so it's easy to just attack that. I don't have a problem with either game being linear"
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,thoughtlessfox,3,Tue Jul 21 20:18:55 2015 UTC,"In 13-2 and 13-3, they greatly expanded upon the openness. However, in my opinion, 13 was still better and this openness was unnecessary.   There is a big craze in recent years, to have ""open world."" 13 was fine being linear. RPGs can be linear."
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,Gold_Jacobson,5,Tue Jul 21 17:30:30 2015 UTC,"It's not even about the open world craze though. I'm not a fan of open world games for the sake of it, I only like it when it's appropriate. Most jrpgs are linear in nature, especially story wise, but that's a given. 13 however is so linear it feels cramped. It is a noticeably narrow experience. It's not a ""this or that"" thing, there is a wide gulf between linear and open world. 13 is too far on the linear end of the spectrum."
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,Dante_777,4,Tue Jul 21 17:44:08 2015 UTC,"I understand your opinion. I guess it just comes down to having different definitions of when it becomes too linear.   I just look to 13-2 and 13-3 that were significantly more open, much like other FF games. I don't think 13 was truly missing out by not having it. Would have made the great game only slightly better. I think people are exaggerating their love for towns and npcs, and how necessary they were in the context of FF13."
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,AtticusWeiss,4,Tue Jul 21 17:52:18 2015 UTC,"I think people who already dislike XIII for other reasons are latching onto the most common complaint to bolster their argument. X is still an incredibly linear game, closer to XIII than any other FF in that regard. If XIII had towns and minigames I'm sure a lot (not all) of the people who dislike it would still dislike it."
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,PrimalPower,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:11:17 2015 UTC,"The game certainly had other problems, no doubt. They are all pretty big problems too. Besides being linear, I disliked nearly all the characters, didn't enjoy the combat or how little choice I had in party configuration for the majority of the game, and I didn't like the main plot devices of the story. For me it nearly had nothing going for it. In my eyes the devs pretty much did everything wrong. Thankfully XV is slated to be nearly the antithesis of XIII."
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,AtticusWeiss,3,Tue Jul 21 20:32:08 2015 UTC,"I too felt that 13 was better than 13-2 and 13-3, but personally I felt like that was because 13-2 and 13-3 weren't as good games.  First there's the whole thing where these sequels are more or less, half-experimental and half cash grabs. Even for its downsides, FF13 probably had a lot more work and care and quality control going into it compared to FF13-2 and 13-3.   Personally, I loved FF10, and disliked FF13. I don't think I disliked 13 because it was linear, but because as /u/teepsy says ""a combination of 1 directional corridors, followed by a cinematic and an underwhelming boss fight in that order throughout the entire duration of the game.""  I don't care about sidequests, but there was no ""in-between"" stuff that would add variety. So even though this game was standard length for a JRPG (40-50 hours), I felt like the game took forever because just chugging through the normal game felt really repetitive and I was just droning forward.   Part of this was because I wasn't particularly fond of the Battle System. I like a good challenge, and FF13's bosses were probably some of the most challenging I have faced because many of the bosses required specific paradigm setups, or else I'd either get wiped quickly, fail to stagger the boss, or not do enough damage during the stagger.   But with common hordes, even after getting 4-5 stars, some enemies would still take upwards of 2+ minutes. Even regular enemies felt like bosses at times, and over time it began to get irritating.  These two things together are what I think what makes FF13 perceived as much more Linear than FF10. 90% of FF13 feels like narrow corridors (even Gran Pulse isn't that great if you don't care much for marks), progress can feel slow at times due to the longer battles, and the game doesn't really do much to shake it up.   EDIT: Oh as OP said too. Camera Angles in FFX, I think, helped me appreciate the world more than being behind lightning's back."
FinalFantasy,3e2u0j,makisodamnkawaii,2,Tue Jul 21 19:13:30 2015 UTC,"Exactly, The Last of Us was a pretty linear game but the areas weren't utterly constraining and everything about the game and story flowed in such a way that you never really noticed or was bothered by it. That can't be said for XIII. It was constricting. Not only in map design but also in player choice like party configuration and paradigm construction, things that you shouldn't wait 20 hours in to get to. The terrible characters and underwhelming story just tipped it over the edge of being a bad Final Fantasy game, to just being a bad game."

FinalFantasy,3e26lz,Saltlizard,4,Tue Jul 21 11:30:29 2015 UTC,Doesn't seem like they intend to include character switching. Tabata (director) said that the gameplay was built around only controlling Noctis. It's a shame and the only real disappointment I have from this game so far.
FinalFantasy,3e26lz,bakuhatsuda,3,Tue Jul 21 12:24:52 2015 UTC,I think the reality was they didn't want to have to invest the development time after the transition and he said that to save face. What do you think?
FinalFantasy,3e26lz,AtticusWeiss,3,Tue Jul 21 15:19:01 2015 UTC,I agree with you
FinalFantasy,3e26lz,Harleequin,3,Tue Jul 21 16:07:02 2015 UTC,"Eh I disagree. I think Noctis is meant to be an extraordinary soul in this Final Fantasys world. Even the demo infers he is very powerful.  That being said, I think that the level of strength he has is almost deity-like compared to others, even his own comrades who I'm sure are well known as well.  Noctis is able to teleport and summon weapons, we are unsure if anyone else has this ability, and if they don't, it would be very boring to play as anyone else.   So I do believe they created this game with the sole interest of Noctis being the main and only character. Square Enix doesn't get lazy with games like this, they aren't working based on a release date like other companies such as ubisoft do."
FinalFantasy,3e26lz,AtticusWeiss,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:33:18 2015 UTC,"The game used to have character switching pre rebranding. It's there. That was the original intention. Things changed after the rebranding. They need to get the game out and focusing only on Noctis helps with cutting down development time.  I got over it. I still love it, but it would've been nice. Either way, I believe it's in good hands. Things might be a bit different now but at least Tabata keeps us informed and has made progress with the game. When Nomura was director we never got shit and the game development got nowhere. I'm excited, I've been following this game for a long ass time. It's been my most anticipated game for nearly a decade now."
FinalFantasy,3e26lz,bakuhatsuda,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:06:46 2015 UTC,god I hope that's not the case. They can't make the excuse of time constraints for this game and expect us to take them seriously.
FinalFantasy,3e26lz,PrimalPower,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:58:13 2015 UTC,"No, that is the case. The original plan from Versus 13 was to control all characters. But it's also not a case of time constraint, but a development and money constraint.   The developers probably put a lot of effort into Noctis' teleporting swords. To control the other 3, not only would they have to spend a lot of time creating their controls and making a system that's fun. Prompto's whole scheme was originally planned to be like an over the shoulder FPS. But they'd also have to work all the team attacks and everything.   Then there's the whole thing with debugging.   And then from a producer's perspective you gotta look at diminishing returns. And in the end they probably decided, he look Noctis' ability is cool af, and we tailored the whole game and camaraderie to work around him.   It's not that there are time-constraints, but rather they decided it was going to be a waste of time."
FinalFantasy,3e26lz,AtticusWeiss,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:22:27 2015 UTC,"And it would take more time, and they want to get the game out. Like you implied, it's a trade off to save time (by not developing it)."
FinalFantasy,3e26lz,flaahgra012,2,Tue Jul 21 19:48:00 2015 UTC,"I love it, Noctis' actions are so smooth and it feels so satisfying taking chunks of enemies health out with the special moves, I fought the behemoth once for 20 minutes and barely scratched him, but I still enjoyed it. The only concerns I have are how the game will be balanced and how summons will work, the demo feels way too easy and summons are weirdly implemented but I'm sure they'll do it right in the final release"
FinalFantasy,3e26lz,Icon_dota,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:14:39 2015 UTC,"took me a couple hours to get level 99, once you get all the armiger skills and you strike multiple enemies together at once you can clear entire packs effortlessly and really quick, the thing i love about this combat is that it actually requires a reasonable amount of skill."
FinalFantasy,3e26lz,Jinketsu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:49:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know about controlling other characters. I see this game a lot like what they did with the Ghostbusters video game. Amazing story (if you're a Ghostbusters fan) but all the characters revolve around your character and the story wouldn't have as much weight if you were able to control anyone.  I like that we're going to have one-off adventures with one other character every once in a while. However I really feel like the cinematic and character growths are going to depend on your connection with these characters while playing as Noctis, and being able to control them would really detract from it."
FinalFantasy,3e26lz,PrimalPower,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:00:48 2015 UTC,"I'm going to wait and see. I want to see how magic might work in this game, before I make my judgement.   The demo had somewhat of a balancing issue. Enemies had high HP and took forever to take down and high spawn rate. Hopefully, though, this was intentional for the Demo. As the demo was there to show off the battle system and show that it works, rather than an game.   I really liked the Chain Attacks and the quick prompt teamwork attacks, but I hope these don't become things that must be spammed in order to do well. As I can see it becoming repetitive quick."
FinalFantasy,3e26lz,DrWowee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:27:18 2015 UTC,"Maybe there's something I'm not getting, but I don't like it at all. It feels like sluggish character action to me with no reliable way to read attacks and react to them. I don't sense any means of strategy, everything is just kind of swinging away at everything else, it frequently devolves into the simplest quick-time event ever when an ally knocks something down, and I desperately want the characters to shut up for five seconds or at least come up with more than two things to say whenever something is killed or someone needs healing.  It just goes between boring and frustrating for me, which is especially bad when the fights go on as long as they sometimes do."
FinalFantasy,3e26lz,Dubble0Donut,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:54:21 2015 UTC,"Hated it. I had several encounters where the red warning bar appeared and a fight started before I even had a chance to react. Fights with Garulas where I can see 3, start the fight, suddenly there's like 9 of them, great. If I start a fight with sabertusks then the Garulas shouldn't aggro on me. Day/night cycle was way too short with the spawn rate of those magitek soldiers was way too high. Enemy health was ridiculously high so every fight felt like it took forever. Hiding behind a rock mechanic slows down the fights even further, or I try and do it and all the enemies become smart enough to run around the rock. why is rescue and warp mapped to the same buttin? So many times i would hit the rescue button when the prompt appeared and warp away, sometimes into stasis which is another tedious mechanic. When you do warp away instead of rescuing you can't rely on the AI to rescue because the AI are infuriatingly dumb (put gambits in for the love of god). If I use dragoon jump and the enemy takes one step backwards I should land on the enemy, not miss entirely. The all black character design makes keeping track of people on the battlefield more of a chore than it needs to be, especially if someone needs rescuing because the waypoint is delayed. Holding X as the game auto-combos isn't exciting and techniques feel so situation specific that i eventually got to the point only using full thrust against a downed Garula because that was the only time they felt efficient instead of detrimental. Battle themes sucked in context, especially the main day fight which sounds more like the soundtrack to a dance rather than a fight. There's not a single thing this battle system did that I liked, I want ATB/Turn Based back so bad. ARPG =/= Evolution."
FinalFantasy,3e26lz,AtticusWeiss,2,Tue Jul 21 12:25:17 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're just not good at the game. There's supposed to be a gambit like system in the full release. I love the combat system. It's lightyears better than Final Hallway XIII. It sounds like you just haven't spent enough time in the game to realize when you need to do what when and to what enemy types. When you get all of the Armiger swords, you can activate the Phantom swords and clear out a squad of Magitek Soldiers as they drop in less than a couple of minutes. A lot of the aggro things you mention are more of a plus, it's one realistic and actually makes the game have an amount of challenge, unlike XIII. It's very likely going to be a superb game, it's too bad you can't enjoy it. Hopefully that's not just because you want it to be ATB or turn based. I hope you can make some time to play again and really think about your strategy."
FinalFantasy,3e26lz,DrWowee,3,Tue Jul 21 15:29:21 2015 UTC,"As someone who agrees with him on all points, do you have any pointers on the strategies you're talking about? I can't help but feel the combat is just wonky and imprecise. Some enemies don't seem to telegraph in ways that allow me to react, causing certain moves to whiff horribly. Even resorting to button-mashing on those enemies is not only boring but still results in getting hit when you didn't have time to react. Some fights really do go on forever with HP tanks spawning over and over.  There really doesn't seem to me to be much strategy other than ""how much damage does this attack do vs the time it takes to animate"" and the occasional and totally out-of-the-player's-hands ""stand in this circle and then hit X until it's dead."""
FinalFantasy,3e26lz,AtticusWeiss,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:44:53 2015 UTC,"Well if you play in the night time, battles will go on all night sometimes because by design stronger enemies aggro more. Having just played a minute ago I took out a double squad (they vary in number) of Magitek Soldiers in less than 30 seconds using the Knightsword ability. A lot of my strategy involves warping to close the gap with enemies like the Saber tusk. Using the tempest ability when clustered in the caves by goblins, using Dragoonjump and full thrust on gurulas especially when they are off guard. There is a Dodge roll as well as counters. Magic wasn't in the demo because apparently the animations weren't up to standard but the full release will have that to add battle variety as well.   I can definitely agree that at first, the enemies have a lot of hp and the enemies can be tough. It gets better when up level up. If you camp, get bonuses, fight Magitek Soldiers to gain experience (preferably quickly with Knightsword to get even more bonus exp), then go cash in the experience in a camper to get a x1.5 experience multiplier, you can gain levels very quickly.  I think they have tooled the levels in the demo though. My party is in the 90s and the stats don't jump very much between levels. Despite this you can figure good ways to dispatch particular enemies.   But nighttime is pretty much a bit if a cluster fuck because it's supposed to be more difficult at night."

The RPG mechanics are very very light, but the combat is very reminiscent of Vagrant Story, or just a bit like Grandia if you're not familiar with the former. Still a great game in my opinion, carries a consistently darker tone than Final Fantasy ever has anymore. The story is about as ridiculous as Resident Evil in some regards but I really enjoy it.

Also, I know I sound petty, but I kinda hated how they used stock sound effects and voice clips in certain places (i.e. that girly laugh Eve makes when she was playing on that piano) rather then making and using unique noises. Kinda took me out of the game.  The game's major strength I feel was in its music and atmosphere. The music that plays in the police station in particular was really nice."

FinalFantasy,3e0kin,iGyman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:07:01 2015 UTC,"I think it's a decent game. Lots of gameplay mechanics became very annoying early on. One that bothered the crap out of me, even through the end of my playthrough, was how slow Aya ran. I thought it was because she was wearing heels at first, but she eventually puts on normal shoes...and still runs at a breakneck walking speed.    One thing I really enjoyed about the game was the music. It was so eerie and kept you glued to the tv. Combat was pretty good as well, if a little shallow, but still fun. Story was a little strange to me but that's just my take. Graphics hold up nicely, if you're okay with the way FF7 looks now, but can be a little annoying with the dark tone of the game. You'll be speed walking around looking for a key or a door that you'll constantly miss because it just doesn't stick out or it blends in with the prerendered backgrounds.    All in all, a game I'd check out! If anything, it's just nice to say you've beaten it :)"
FinalFantasy,3e0kin,duewhaa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:37:08 2015 UTC,"Great Game over all. The combat is pretty great and upgrading the guns is unique in its own aspect. The over all story is great if not convoluted at times but still great. If you like a nice hard challenge, you can look forward to the Chrysler Building on your second play through. enjoy all those floors and the surprise at the end once you reach the top. <tip: be very well prepared>"

The FMV were impresive, the dificultid  was ok, not easy and not hard.  The Game+ feature make the game very very easy after a few full clears. The Chrysler Tower is better if you clear it in your first Game+"
FinalFantasy,3e2kia,zerorequiem122,8,Tue Jul 21 13:49:45 2015 UTC,"The game is pretty linear nearly all the way through. There is one area later down the line that's actually VERY open. And is where you'll be spending most (if not all the time if I remember correctly) of your time in terms of sidequests.  Besides that though, there aren't any villages to explore. They do provide a plot explanation for this though. Still, it would have been nice to be given the chance to breathe a bit and explore after long strings of battles."

No villages or exploration really no."
FinalFantasy,3e2kia,HumOfEvil,2,Tue Jul 21 13:55:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's definitely linear. Let's just say ""no"" to villages. The game forces you down its story's throat and only towards the end will it open up with side quests and things.  It's a game that pretty much takes two playthrough to really appreciate. A shame in that respect, but that second playthrough... man. The game is like 300% better when you go in again knowing about the world."
FinalFantasy,3e2kia,Jinketsu,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:04:06 2015 UTC,"It is linear, yes, but that doesn't flat out make it bad.

In that one once locations are opened you are free to come and go from them at any time (but they are a lot of the same locales as XIII).  Lightning Returns is the third part of the saga  (I haven't played it yet, so I can't speak to the gameplay)."
FinalFantasy,3e2kia,elrookie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:34:58 2015 UTC,"lighting returns is like a ""mini"" version of open world.

FinalFantasy,3e2kia,King_Big_Dick,-2,Tue Jul 21 19:49:50 2015 UTC,I've played all the games you have plus all of the SNES games and my honest advice for you is: Just don't even bother playing it.

FinalFantasy,3e2kia,Tramd,-4,Tue Jul 21 15:59:24 2015 UTC,"It plays like 10. You go from location to location with little variance from the road until you get to the open field portion. Then you can do some stuff and the dungeons that follow are more open and puzzle like. Unfortunately it's very long and with you being on the run the game pushes you in a single direction. Try not to stare at the minimap though, it ruins it by pointing out the straight path and you miss a lot of chests."

FinalFantasy,3dv0o0,punnotattended,7,Sun Jul 19 22:01:13 2015 UTC,I'd love another pre-rendered FF.
FinalFantasy,3dv0o0,Marowe,9,Sun Jul 19 21:13:26 2015 UTC,"I think it's less about being pre-rendered and more about having a locked camera nowadays. Technology-wise, it's not as difficult and intensive to make the backgrounds this beautiful, but I think the locked camera really gives it that charm. It'd be really nostalgic to have a FF go back to that :D"
FinalFantasy,3dv0o0,I_Lobster,3,Mon Jul 20 01:20:25 2015 UTC,Some modern games do the locked camera thing well. God of War and uncharted spring to mind. I think what I like about it is that the developer can choose the camera angles and build the scenes and composition around them. Definitely makes the games feel more cinematic.  I hate this homogenisation of games these days where everything is expected to have a third person camera akin to resi 4 or gears of war.
FinalFantasy,3dv0o0,Marowe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:49:15 2015 UTC,"Yesss, God of War came to mind when I was thinking about it. Combining that with the Final Fantasy aesthetic would be beautiful."
FinalFantasy,3dv0o0,madmemer,-7,Mon Jul 20 17:45:25 2015 UTC,"naw dude not just locked camera. the camera is locked for a reason in 7-9, the only 3d objects are the character models. 10 is only semi locked and seems like they just did that so it didn't seem that different and to make it funner to hide things  and would still be better to prerender since I would prefer multi disc game to a game that has long ass load times everytime the background changes  you say not that intensive but then they still wouldn't look as good as they could prerendred on a different machine  just for the record 13 sucks balls, 10 seems to be the FINAL fantasy"
FinalFantasy,3dv0o0,madmemer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:31:19 2015 UTC,"You do realize that swapping hundreds of 3D Models between scenes requires more memory and background loading than changing 1 large background texture.  Its largely about the locked Camera, Bravely Default does that and it has handpainted backgrounds and gives a similar feel.  The PS1 games just had bad load times, its part of the way the PS1 read the discs along with the tiny amount of RAM the console had."
FinalFantasy,3dv0o0,madmemer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:26:52 2015 UTC,uh.. that's what I was saying. would be faster to prerender backgrounds as a single/few images than trying to create them all in framebuffers on the fly
FinalFantasy,3dv0o0,madmemer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:18:28 2015 UTC,"But pre-rendered backgrounds still end up using like 400+ images anyway, its not a few, and they'd be pretty high res now.  I think tbh eitherway is going to be the same roughly, from a memory perspective.  20 512x512 textures still works out using less memory than 10 2048x2048 textures, a lot less memory. Not crash your machine or anything, but just the difference is several times larger."
FinalFantasy,3dv0o0,raggabomb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:54:18 2015 UTC,"but if you want to render what these 2d backgrounds represent in 3d, will take shit loads more memory and take longer to process all the vertices and wouldn't be as detailed"
FinalFantasy,3dv0o0,pEuAsTsSy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:52:43 2015 UTC,"Vertices don't use up much memory compared to textures though, even space wise on disc they use up little to nothing, models are often 100x smaller than the textures size wise, even memory wise its textures and bones that use the most animation.  I think the end result would be around the same honestly, with a static camera you'd use baked lighting anyway to be more efficient, and considering the camera doesn't move a lot of the unseen stuff would be culled anyway.  End result would probably be about the same.  Detail wise it could be around the same, if you consider that you're only seeing from certain angles the textures and models would be created to take advantage of that, using more polygons closer to the camera than farther away.  Bravely default uses 3D models for its scenes with a projected texture, its unexpectedly high poly."
FinalFantasy,3dv0o0,exslash,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:59:19 2015 UTC,"its not just memory when rendering 3d tho, its going to be more expensive to process a lot of vertices instead of just sampling a texture.   I haven't played bravely default but the shots look good. it looks like it does rely more on 3d than old ff. I think if they did something like that for consoles it would look better than ff15 but seems they want to go towards more fluid areas and control of camera"

FinalFantasy,3dv0o0,Owyn_Merrilin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:12:56 2015 UTC,Saying a games visuals has nothing to do with art is very closed minded. What makes video games such a unique form of art is that it combines multiple artistic disciplines into an interactive form
FinalFantasy,3dv0o0,fatalblur,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:21:42 2015 UTC,"Visuals are a PART of it but not all of it, too often people say 'this game looks amazing, its a representation of games as art', no, that makes no sense, music has no visuals but its an art form none the less.   any activity regarded as a medium of imaginative or creative self-expression.   Videogames come under this, the are an art form, but its because of everything combined, people have this terrible habit of misunderstanding visuals as ART, when in facts its a culmination of everything.  My dismissing of art as the be all and end all isn't nearly as bad as your claim that this game looks amazing, therefore its art.

FinalFantasy,3dv0o0,Owyn_Merrilin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:36:02 2015 UTC,"I never said that because this game looks amazing it is art. The visuals are artistic because they contribute to the atmosphere, ambiance, and spirit of the game. The backgrounds just happen to also look amazing. And your analogy to music is irrelevant. Music is most definitely art, but it is no more artistic than a beautiful paining. FFIX just happens to have both Beutiful music and beautiful painting esque backgrounds. The combination of these, and the interaction the player is given (among other things) is what propels this game to a moving piece of artistic impression. I don't see why you're arguing with me or trying to dismiss my opinion when all I did was comment on how breathtaking the visuals were and how they contributed to The games expression"

I'm just saying from Squeenix's perspective, it's a very different situation than VII and VIII. VII and VIII were both ported to the PC back in the day, and the Steam versions are just a re-release of the existing ports with a couple of compatibility patches thrown in. FFIX would have to be ported from scratch, with a 15 year old codebase (and that's assuming they even still have all of the code and assets). It's not hopeless, considering we've had ports and/or remakes of the first six games after a similar amount of time had passed, but it's a lot less likely than VII and VIII were. Even the PSN version is just the PSX version running on an emulator, they haven't done anything with the code since the game came out."

FinalFantasy,3dv0o0,OvernightSiren,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:06:37 2015 UTC,"I agree. I don't care for trophies (aka achievements) and never found them enticing at all. Lots of trophies are nothing more than story events (oh, you managed to play the game, do you want a sticker?) and stuff related to finding optional stuff is usually rewarded well enough by the experience and in-game benefits (eg, items from completing the chocobo hot and cold minigame)."
FinalFantasy,3dv0o0,USNDiablo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:09:15 2015 UTC,Nope.

FinalFantasy,3dv0o0,AKABoondock,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:48:10 2015 UTC,These are amazing. Thanks!
FinalFantasy,3dv0o0,nostalgic_dinosaur,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:17:39 2015 UTC,That's amazing. I felt so nostalgic watching all of it. Thanks for this !
FinalFantasy,3dv0o0,PrinceAli311,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:35:06 2015 UTC,"Playing this game again now and I'm amazed at how well it holds up, how it seems lifelike and avoids seeming static. These backgrounds and the excellent character animations are a big chunk of what accounts for it. Thanks for the great upload!"
FinalFantasy,3dv0o0,rChutoy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:19:15 2015 UTC,"Incredible, the work and love that went into making these, is just... amazing. The only other game I've ever seen that had BGs that could somewhat compare, was Koudelka..."
FinalFantasy,3dv0o0,Seltox,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:32:47 2015 UTC,"I love that you took the time to do this. Thank you so much, can't wait to see more. :)"
FinalFantasy,3dv0o0,TwistTurtle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:08:34 2015 UTC,God I love this game. This really is a lost art. Don't really know that any games would be bold enough to try this style in the modern day.
FinalFantasy,3dv0o0,NightSingerDayCaller,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:51:36 2015 UTC,"Yesss, some FFIX love! Saving these. :)"
FinalFantasy,3dv0o0,WoWCoreT,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:56:40 2015 UTC,"Not sure why your title says ""Dynamic Backgrounds"" then the description says ""if you think any of these are dynamic, they're not"" but okay.  These make me want to cry and play FFIX all over again....for like the 20th time."
FinalFantasy,3dv0o0,rfreeman85,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:59:15 2015 UTC,"Ah typo, I meant if you think anything is MISSING, its not, all the missing ones aren't dynamic in the games files, just particle effects overlaid, will go fix that thanks."
FinalFantasy,3dv0o0,Bamx3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:09:23 2015 UTC,Ah you have finished them! Congrats and thank you!
FinalFantasy,3dze07,mjmax,17,Mon Jul 20 19:40:00 2015 UTC,"If you need some context, I'd look at it this way; The slums in Midgar are where the rejects of the city live. The poor, the sick, the downtrodden. Who's to say that they don't dump their poorly designed equipment down there, too? Imagine someone at Shinra thinking, ""Man. I don't know why I thought a miniature robotic house was a good idea, let alone to mass produce them. Whatever. Throw them in the slums"""
FinalFantasy,3dze07,Shredson,5,Mon Jul 20 20:11:23 2015 UTC,"I like this, I'll take it."
FinalFantasy,3dze07,rd_Mars,2,Tue Jul 21 01:35:52 2015 UTC,Good enough.
FinalFantasy,3dze07,DrunkDiabetic,5,Tue Jul 21 20:48:36 2015 UTC,"A lot of the monsters come from Norse mythology. Scroll down to ""Etymology"""
FinalFantasy,3dze07,FinalMantasyX,12,Mon Jul 20 19:55:02 2015 UTC,Norse robocycles
FinalFantasy,3dze07,Pawn315,3,Mon Jul 20 22:24:22 2015 UTC,The Norse were pretty hardcore.
FinalFantasy,3dze07,TheKnackerman,3,Tue Jul 21 01:34:35 2015 UTC,"Like a lot of monsters in the FF series, many of them have different sources. In FF7 a majority of the monsters you bump into are plants, animals, and even inanimate objects that have been poisoned by mako and altered into monsters. Many others are robots and security devices or bio weapons intentionally created by Shin-Ra and a few created by the Planet itself. Though over the course of the game you'll fight a lot of regular humans too, but generally a side effect of Nako reactors is they create monsters.The only real deviant from this are the fragments of a creature called Jenova."
FinalFantasy,3dze07,imitebmike,3,Mon Jul 20 23:20:21 2015 UTC,Most of the monsters have no lore (some do but that is what you gleam from talking to people)
FinalFantasy,3dze07,Shihali,2,Mon Jul 20 19:42:14 2015 UTC,"Most Final Fantasy random monsters have no lore. They're just there. Off the top of my head, the monsters in II and parts of XIII have minimal collective lore, and the monsters in VIII and X have some collective lore."
FinalFantasy,3dze07,MrRobotPants,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:55:47 2015 UTC,Don't forget XII!
FinalFantasy,3dze07,satsumaclementine,2,Tue Jul 21 01:57:16 2015 UTC,"Being exposed to Mako energy has mutative effects, so areas near Mako Reactors tend to have some crazy kind of monsters. In the Crisis Core prequel it is also explained that Shinra's Professor Hojo has released his ""experiments"" to the areas around Midgar."
FinalFantasy,3dze07,buymymeth,2,Tue Jul 21 01:23:35 2015 UTC,"My only suggestion is that you pay attention to Jenova, and the correlation between it and Sephiroth. A lot of people go through the game and still don't understand jenova and think sephiroth is the main villain. The game becomes a million times better once you actually understand what's going on :p"
FinalFantasy,3dze07,5lash3r,2,Tue Jul 21 14:35:30 2015 UTC,"Other ppl have covered points about those particular monsters decently (tho i admit i was always weirded out by the random houses and motorcycles and snakes, and that's just in the first part of the game)... but, for the most part, the enemies start to make more sense as the game goes on. You'll encounter Shinra soldiers, and animals that are appropriate to the terrain you're on. Some odd things still pop up somewhere, but usually they can be explained via entertaining the fact that this is a world where random monsters suddenly pop up (and when you learn one of the reasons why, you might understand why they're so weird)."
FinalFantasy,3dze07,DaleLeatherwood,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:25:47 2015 UTC,"Some enemies fit more than others.  There are plot points that explain some enemies, specifically why there are monsters in the world.  Other areas have monsters that fit the area (wolves in snow, ghosts in graveyards, guards in Shinra buildings).  It's not the best at offering explanations, but it's not bad either.  Some games offer nothing."
FinalFantasy,3dyq8m,camelCaseCondition,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:53:25 2015 UTC,I used this whenever I couldn't figure them out quickly. Very good tool.
FinalFantasy,3e1aev,Majink8b,2,Tue Jul 21 04:43:33 2015 UTC,"If this game comes out before 2020 I will be very, very happy."
FinalFantasy,3e1aev,JonnyBigBoss,4,Tue Jul 21 04:46:29 2015 UTC,"There is Zero reason to buy this game now. Please wait till release date to stop supporting this nonsense system of ""buying before you know anything about it!"" You certainly wouldn't do that with any other product would you?"
FinalFantasy,3e1aev,ffxiimaniac,3,Tue Jul 21 04:51:59 2015 UTC,"You never know if you like a game until you play it yourself, game play videos only do so much. Plus, the midnight sale of this game is going to be INSANE, you're simply not going to get it on release day if you don't pre order."
FinalFantasy,3e1aev,buymymeth,3,Tue Jul 21 14:31:53 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with you 999 times out of 1000.  That being said... I mean, this is the remake of the most iconic JRPG of all time.  If there's ever a time to bend that rule..."
FinalFantasy,3e1aev,mmr93,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:04:51 2015 UTC,Maybe if they give you something for it. Otherwise I don't see a difference in just buying it once it's out.
FinalFantasy,3e1aev,Tramd,0,Tue Jul 21 14:10:39 2015 UTC,"Disagree in this case. With an Hd remaster you would be RIGHT, but they are changing CORE ELEMENTS OF THE GAME HERE. Regardless if it's for the better or the worse, it could be TOTAL TRASH, and if you preorder, you're giving money before you even know! The only example outside of hdremasters (not remakes, since remasters dnt change anything) is something like GTAV. If you bought GTAV on ps3 for example, and loved it 100% and wanted to preorder it on PS4 I see no issue. As it is quite literally THE SAME GAME. You HAVE the knowledge on what it's going to be. In FF7 remakes case, you have NO idea how it'll be, or what it'll do. ALL you know is it'll be 'prettier'."
FinalFantasy,3e1aev,ffxiimaniac,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:31:19 2015 UTC,"There are people who are going to play this remake no matter what, trash or not. It's their money."
FinalFantasy,3e1aev,Rimavelle,-2,Tue Jul 21 11:20:59 2015 UTC,Lol
FinalFantasy,3e1aev,ActuallyFolant,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:54:15 2015 UTC,"It depends on whether you know or trust the company.  For example, Marvel Studios has announced a ton of their movies that aren't even truly in development yet. If I could buy a ticket to see them for a discount right now, I would. That's because I know and trust the company to make a great product.  I believe the same goes for SE/FFVII but instead of ""for a discount"" like in the above example, it's ""to make sure I get a copy the second it comes out""  That's just imo"
FinalFantasy,3e1aev,rd_Mars,0,Tue Jul 21 20:43:14 2015 UTC,Except for when the case is that you know you're going to buy it regardless.
