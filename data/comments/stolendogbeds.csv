stolendogbeds,2s8vow,TanithRosenbaum,4,Tue Jan 13 08:31:52 2015 UTC,"This is cute, but it's damn dangerous. What the dog is learning here is that it's okay with his alphas (the dog owners) to show agressive behaviour towards that new omega animal that appeared in the pack a while ago (the baby). Right now it may just be the dog pulling away the bed, but if that behaviour persists and isn't corrected it might get to the point where the dog is openly attacking the child."
stolendogbeds,2s8vow,name_with_a_y,10,Tue Jan 13 10:16:17 2015 UTC,Or maybe the owners are sane and logical and will intervene if the dog shows warning signs of being aggressive.

Yeah, after that fist snap when that little rat attacks the kid. Yeah you're right there to stop it but he's a lot closer. One bite, that kid has animal issues and that dog is getting put down bc ""oh my gawd he got soo aggressive when the baby came!"" And then they don't understand why. They should just be correcting it when it's as easy as a gentle ""hey stop that"" like it would be with this bed."
stolendogbeds,2s8vow,Delsana,0,Sat Feb 28 13:40:22 2015 UTC,"You are aware most dogs really don't associate humans as alphas right? It's just a learned form of mannerisms and responses to get things.

stolendogbeds,1fj215,ashishduh,2,Sun Jun 2 17:55:41 2013 UTC,That window bed is hilariously cute
stolendogbeds,1fj215,WalrusofDisapproval,1 point,Sun Jun 2 18:12:07 2013 UTC,"I don't think so... I put the soft part up, is that not right?  Never had a dog before lol."
stolendogbeds,1fj215,redfroggy,4,Mon Jun 3 04:07:06 2013 UTC,You have it right. But don't rely on pee-pads for too long. I did and it took 8 months to housebreak my dog.
stolendogbeds,1erjuv,EvanFlecknell,4,Tue May 21 14:28:31 2013 UTC,That tail!!!!
stolendogbeds,1erjuv,andifyoudo,5,Wed May 22 02:15:18 2013 UTC,Looks like a feather. I need to find the picture I have of the little brown one curled up in the middle of my dog's other huge dog bed with my dog lying on the cold floor beside it
stolendogbeds,1erjuv,andifyoudo,3,Wed May 22 06:38:26 2013 UTC,They are Adorable. Post pic if you find it :)

stolendogbeds,1cbk19,nekowolf,2,Sun Apr 14 11:07:24 2013 UTC,awwwwww... looks so cute.

stolendogbeds,1c5r60,dachshundsocks,5,Thu Apr 11 21:44:49 2013 UTC,That's so damn cute.
stolendogbeds,1c5r60,TheModernCurio,3,Thu Apr 11 20:49:31 2013 UTC,That thing is going to get to at least 50 pounds by the time it grows up.
stolendogbeds,1c5r60,Nonprogressive,3,Fri Jun 7 18:41:11 2013 UTC,Wwwillllllbur

stolendogbeds,1b8vqf,Random_Fandom,5,Fri Mar 29 15:40:54 2013 UTC,"Haha, truly hilarious! Feel bad for the bigger dog, though. Speaking of which, what kind of dog is in the 2nd pic? I'm terrible with identifying breeds.   P.S. Initially, I read the title as ""Bad Swap."" Very appropriate, I'd say..."
stolendogbeds,1b8vqf,OyOfMidWorld19,3,Fri Mar 29 16:25:26 2013 UTC,The big dog in the tiny bed is a boxer. The other one looks like a Pekingese mix(?).   The Boxer's look is quite tragic.
stolendogbeds,1b8vqf,Random_Fandom,3,Fri Mar 29 16:46:10 2013 UTC,"Okay, thank you so much! :)"
stolendogbeds,1b8vqf,sackbj,3,Fri Mar 29 16:52:31 2013 UTC,The 1st dog looks like a Tibetan Spaniel
stolendogbeds,1b8vqf,Random_Fandom,3,Fri Mar 29 22:07:36 2013 UTC,"Thanks for the response! :) I just looked it up, and I see the similarities as well. It would be easier to tell if I could see the dog in the pic from another angle."
stolendogbeds,1b8p91,nekowolf,9,Fri Mar 29 13:56:38 2013 UTC,I fear for your PS3.
stolendogbeds,1b8p91,holierthanmao,8,Fri Mar 29 23:24:05 2013 UTC,How old is your cat? He looks pretty ancient (and adorable).
stolendogbeds,1b8p91,wordybird,4,Fri Mar 29 14:43:32 2013 UTC,Wow thats my dog. Nice one
stolendogbeds,1b8p91,SebastianCannonball,3,Sat Mar 30 04:26:05 2013 UTC,Cat got a new bed.   FTFY

stolendogbeds,1b8p91,betamax65,2,Fri Mar 29 13:59:58 2013 UTC,What kind of dog?  He's awesome.
stolendogbeds,1b95n2,defaultsuredditssuck,3,Fri Mar 29 17:53:42 2013 UTC,Ha! Reminds me of when our Dalmatian steals the cat bed.
stolendogbeds,1b8vas,porkchopsnapplesauce,10,Fri Mar 29 15:34:12 2013 UTC,OP has a really really clean house.

stolendogbeds,14u4do,nekowolf,9,Fri Dec 14 09:36:57 2012 UTC,That video is awesome.  Poor dog.  A German Shepherd shouldn't be subjected to such humiliation.
stolendogbeds,14u4do,Fara17,6,Fri Dec 14 15:32:03 2012 UTC,"It is a Belgium Malinois, not a German Shepherd it looks like.  I have one too and she lets my cat get away with entirely too much..."
stolendogbeds,14u4do,pillowplumper,7,Fri Mar 29 13:49:41 2013 UTC,"hahahah awwwwww  That dog looks so dejected and sulky :3 And the cat's like, ""Whatchu looking at? Do we have a problem?""  Cute pets :)"

stolendogbeds,13se9p,nekowolf,3,Mon Dec 17 15:57:29 2012 UTC,"Thanks, I think this gives it a little something extra."
stolendogbeds,13se9p,MetalGearEngineer,2,Sat Dec 22 03:10:33 2012 UTC,"Ha, finally thought about seeing if there were comments. I took this with my phone, not intending to put it on Reddit."
stolendogbeds,13se9p,nekowolf,6,Sat Dec 22 03:10:19 2012 UTC,What is this? A stolen bed for ants?
stolendogbeds,13se9p,caffeinepills,2,Fri Mar 29 13:59:55 2013 UTC,Here is it three times as big plus bonus jpg artifacts.
stolendogbeds,12kckh,nekowolf,2,Sat Nov 3 14:40:53 2012 UTC,Special = very comfy = now belongs to cat.
stolendogbeds,vlif2,nekowolf,16,Mon Jun 25 22:46:47 2012 UTC,this has made me laugh uncontrollably
stolendogbeds,vlif2,MackyTrajan,6,Thu Oct 25 08:13:54 2012 UTC,"Damn, dude, you could have shared."

stolendogbeds,tzjha,nekowolf,1 point,Tue May 22 17:36:46 2012 UTC,"I love the expression on the dog's face, somewhere between resigned frustration and worried confusion that the situation isn't quite right."
stolendogbeds,svry2,nekowolf,1 point,Fri Apr 27 19:58:55 2012 UTC,I like the implication that this is actually a dog bed.   That makes this bed twice stolen.  I think.
stolendogbeds,sisw5,Sir0tilc,2,Fri Apr 20 00:55:53 2012 UTC,Haha.  I thought about crossposting this.
