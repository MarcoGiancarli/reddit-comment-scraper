ImaginaryStarscapes,3dmh89,ethan_kahn,10,Fri Jul 17 13:48:27 2015 UTC,"Does anyone know (as in can make an educated guess) the physical properties of an object like that in space?  Since there is relatively little mass ""under"" the earth, the gravity should be very wonky if not for artificial gravity. Centrifugal force might do the trick, i guess."
ImaginaryStarscapes,3dmh89,DrAEnigmatic,13,Fri Jul 17 18:08:48 2015 UTC,"Niven calculated that for his ringworld to have Earth gravity (THE Ringworld is the size of Earth's orbit though, not like the Halo) it would need to be made of a material that had the strength of nuclear bonds.  So either a nearly impossible material, or grid the whole structure in artificial gravity plating or whatever.  Orbital movement wise, the ringworld as shown in the first book is unstable and would ultimately crash against the star in a short amount of time due to lack of ways to maintain position, since it is not really orbiting, but holding a very fragile balance around the star, so any push, no matter how minuscule will cascade as that side now gets pulled more than the other and end up destroying it.  In the second book he corrected it by giving the World Walls attitude Jets every few degrees of the ring, which would hold the entire structure in place.  For the foreseeable future, we are better off with an Orbital Ring, a much smaller scale version of it, like a planet's diameter of size, rather than 1AU."
ImaginaryStarscapes,3dmh89,runetrantor,4,Fri Jul 17 19:24:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with the book series, is it good?"

Neutron Star (introduces many key ideas like Known Space, Outsider Hyperdrive, and the Puppeteers). World of Ptavv (reveals more about the ancient Slavers that ruled the Galaxy). Protector (the backstory of the Pak, which is crucial to many key points in Ringworld). Ringworld (introduction to Larry's ""Big Dumb Object"") Ringworld Engineers (we discover the fate of the Puppeteers and the Ringworld). Crashlander (the backstory of Beowolf Shaeffer). Flatlander (the backstory of Carlos Wu). Ringworld Throne (the least gripping of all the novels; reveals Puppeteer technology). Ringworld's Children (stunning conclusion to the Ringworld arc). Fleet of Worlds series (a new arc about the main players in Known Space)."

ImaginaryStarscapes,3dmh89,runetrantor,6,Fri Jul 17 22:09:48 2015 UTC,"Scifi, very good.  The Ringworld saga is 4 books, and the Fleet of Worlds saga is 5, both are tied in and more or less share timeline in their universe.  All are great reads, Niven is good at desribing the ringworld, and there are maps online if you want a sense of scale.  Here's the cross section of the Great Oval Ocean, where most of the story of the Ringworld saga takes place. Of note, the tiny 'island' to the right side of the ocean which may have a familiar name. ;P"

They do not go there sadly, only brief mentions.  But yeah, the Ringworld is for a reason the 'Big Dumb Object'. XD  Meanwhile, the Fleet of Worlds is 5 planets flying across insterstellar space by themselves, while orbiting around a common barycenter. Going at 10% lightspeed.  Both are tech wonders.  If you do plan on reading them, check around to see which order to go with, the last book of the Fleet of Worlds saga is the closure, for both the fleet and ringworld in regards to what happen to them afterwards and all. (I think Ringworld saga first works mostly)"

ImaginaryStarscapes,3anjb7,Draedgal,2,Mon Jun 22 02:52:39 2015 UTC,"Copy/Pasting here for people who don't like DA for whatever reason:   ""Taj Jabbar (The Giant Crown), commonly known as The Giant, is a gas giant larger than Jupiter, with 40 moons.  Life has been discovered on seven moons, and on the largest, Barkha (lower left) a sentient semi-aquatic mammalian race is entering their bronze age and inventing their first religions.  As of right now their rudimentary science places Taj Jabbar at the center of the universe and serves as an arena for the valiant gods of the storm that they believe battle there.  The Giant has a super-powerful magnetic field which results in exotic aurora on its poles.  The Barkhians can see the glowing azurian dancing lights with unaided vision and zeno-anthropologists have discovered at least 12,000 different legends and myths about the Aurora Superioris.  The magnetic field also protects its moons from most of the solar radiation from the star.  The intense gravitational tidal forces result in volcanic activity on Barkha, which is mostly covered in water (like Earth).  Life on Barkha probably began in the warm geothermal shallows on its surface.  Similar to Jupiter, Taj Jabbar is thought to have undergone extreme orbital fluctuations in the past, moving in closer to the star it orbits, then being pulled out by its sister gas giant, the lovely blue Almhia, which is half the diameter.  Taj Jabbar is believed to have a solid ice core.  Probes launched into its atmosphere have found traces of organic molecules, suggesting that life may also live in the Giant, floating in its vast clouds of hydrogen and helium gas."""

ImaginaryStarscapes,37o8ez,evildead4075,4,Fri May 29 13:23:48 2015 UTC,"imagine this did happen... what would happen with the atmosphere? would it dissipate? would it heal itself and cover the ""new"" surface area of the former interior?"
ImaginaryStarscapes,37o8ez,Runescribe,6,Fri May 29 19:17:01 2015 UTC,"I suppose each hemisphere would be pulled towards the center, as that is still the gravitational center, the edges would collapse. The majority of the atmosphere would stay on the outside of the earth, due to the rock(molten or otherwise) being denser than the atmosphere.  However, the molten rock would be quickly cooled by the material coming from the crust, causing the area around the cut to further collapse and shrink.    Likely, all of the existing tectonic plates would fracture, causing devastating earthquakes and tsunamis globally.  The movement of the crust and atmosphere towards the cut would create similarly devastating winds. However due to the singular direction of travel, the majority of the winds would not turn into hurricanes or tornadoes.  That wouldn't do anything to protect the surface of the earth from the massive forces pulling all surface materials (including animals, structures, etc) towards the cut.    Perhaps the most destructive aspect of this event would be the amount of energy released when the cut is closed by the meeting influxes of material in one great clap."

All of the objects are located in the Monoceros constellation and are located about 800 parsecs or 2600 light-years from Earth.  NGC 2264 is sometimes referred to as the Christmas Tree Cluster and the Cone Nebula.
