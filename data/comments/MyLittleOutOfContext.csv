MyLittleOutOfContext,poguh,Libremind,6,Sun Feb 19 00:57:59 2012 UTC,We should just ban the show for containing these frames! It's dangerous to society!
MyLittleOutOfContext,poguh,pinguino42,5,Sat Feb 18 19:51:53 2012 UTC,"Oh my. I never intended to get it to that point. All I wanted was to point out that we could get a problem when Parasprites start to stirr it up...   <sarkasm> By the way, you forgot Spike. Sexually suggestive material featuring Dragons that could be classified as being non-adults is off-limits, too. </sarkasm>"
MyLittleOutOfContext,poguh,ParaspriteHugger,4,Tue Feb 14 15:57:23 2012 UTC,"You said it sarcastically but Spike IS a lot younger than the mane cast, Twilight being there for the hatching. This whole thing is a stupid slippery slope but if we're really going this way regarding imaginary magical creatures I think Spike should be involved in this rule as well. I mean what's the difference between a non-adult magical pony and a non-adult magical dragon? They all have childlike voices"
MyLittleOutOfContext,poguh,Izanaki,3,Tue Feb 14 18:50:25 2012 UTC,You don't have to tell me. I'm the one who noticed the potential problem in first place...
MyLittleOutOfContext,poguh,ParaspriteHugger,5,Tue Feb 14 18:57:51 2012 UTC,"Okay so even though I dislike the stuff there's no way this is going to end well if we're going to implement this rule.  The line between what's allowed and what's forbidden will be pretty much impossible to draw. Specific age is never talked about in the show, the CMC are obviously schoolchildren and Spike is referred to as a baby dragon in the show, but that's about it. The only rite of passage to do with age is getting the cutie mark, but all of the CMC's classmates already have them and since they're forbidden it can't work like that.  So since the physical age of pretty much nobody can be determined, what about mental maturity? Lauren Faust said that the mane cast has a maturity level of between 12 and 18, so allowing even the mane cast would probably be against these rules.  So basically, to enforce this rule you'll pretty much have to draw an arbitary line somewhere, and no matter what you do there's going to be a lot of unhappy people. If I were to do it personally I'd ban everypony who goes to school like the CMC and Spike, who hasn't even gone to dragon puberty yet in my eyes."
MyLittleOutOfContext,poguh,Izanaki,3,Tue Feb 14 19:41:58 2012 UTC,Really? On out of context? Was not expecting that. This place would not have a problem.  What would you even stop?
MyLittleOutOfContext,poguh,DatLouis,3,Tue Feb 14 18:18:37 2012 UTC,"I don't know, screen caps of the show can be interpreted either which way. I guess, you handled this the right way, it's best to let things just play out for a bit."
MyLittleOutOfContext,poguh,atanok,2,Wed Feb 15 02:44:51 2012 UTC,I fully support this whole situation and the rationale behind it.  We must not tolerate anything that may lead to crimethink.  That would be doubleplus uncountryful.
MyLittleOutOfContext,poguh,MishaGurl,2,Tue Feb 21 04:10:52 2012 UTC,"Everyone has an opinion on this and most of them aren't positive.  Mine isn't either.  I understand and fully support the crackdown on CP and human(like) CP art.  The intent of the art is the same.  Is that to say that everything that's been ""humanized"" should fall under this as well?  If so, then every animation that has ever featured an animal that speaks English is up for scrutiny and... if that's the case... where does it end?  Will every single character that could be considered a ""minor"" going to be considered a ""child"" under the pretense of CP and the bans that go with them?  I sincerely hope not.  That's a snowball that can quickly turn into an overwhelming avalanche.  Honestly, the entirety of My Little Pony could be considered for the banning of suggestive material since it is a children's show and therefore every character in it, even Granny Smith, can be considered a child because of the intended audience.  Clearly, a line must be drawn before this all hits the point of ridiculous.  I hold firm that characters that do not appear human should never be considered human and therefore all non-human MLP art could never be considered.  Anthro-Pony art is a gray area, though... how ""human"" does a young character have to be before he or she is considered ""human enough"" to fall under this CP clause?  Are the Mane 6 even 18 yet?  I guess they're adults but how can we really be sure?  Pinkie Pie has her own business... typically you have to be 18 or older to own a business license, so it's pretty safe to consider that Pinkie Pie is 18.  Apple Jack and Rarity both run their own business as well, but neither of these businesses require a license since they aren't selling food.  One tends an apple tree farm, the other makes clothing.  Rainbow Dash has one of the coolest jobs in Equestria but it's something any pegasus can do once they get a handle on flying, really.  Fluttershy... is a hippie.  Think about it.  And Twilight is a student who appears to be continuing her education while studying abroad.  Again, she could be any age but since she's considered a peer to the others, it's safe to assume she is also 18 or older.  But this is all based entirely upon Pinkie Pie's Job, not their actual ages.  So really... where do we draw this line?"

MyLittleOutOfContext,np6hj,TaiWilson,3,Sat Dec 24 17:32:53 2011 UTC,"Yes, I was shocked to see that this sub doesn't have an emote list in the sidebar. Very sad."
MyLittleOutOfContext,np6hj,Gammaj4,3,Sat Dec 24 18:11:28 2011 UTC,"I AM SO SORRY.  I really know absolutely nothing about how that works. If you know anyone who would be willing to set that up, I would be more than happy to make them a mod.  I'll be honest with you, I never expected this to get off the ground. I expected maybe 10 readers."
MyLittleOutOfContext,np6hj,TaiWilson,3,Sat Dec 24 18:58:44 2011 UTC,"Never underestimate the need for Bronies to have more Ponies. The fact that we have an MLP sub, who's whole purpose is to complain about the amount of MLP sub's we have, should prove my point.  As for how to get the emotes to work. . .I also have no idea :(   Perhaps there's something in the reddit FAQ, or a sub on how to mod other subs? I don't know. I'll poke around a bit. If I find anything, I'll be sure to let you know."
