His mother always told him that someday he would meet a woman worth turning human for, but he never thought it would happen when he recognized his mate in a single glance. He also never thought that changing into a human might cost him the friendship of his dog Mouse, who no longer recognizes him.

Glove arrived very sticky and smelled like rubber and.. lemons? After washing it, the smell mostly went away, but it was pretty much impossible to put on. Everything stuck to itself. I had to use lubricant to be able to slide my hand in. The shape of the glove did not fit very comfortably. I lubed the outside of the glove up and went to town. The sensation was strange but mildly pleasant. The spikes are very soft and squishy and were slippery once lube was applied.   The glove was difficult to put on and masturbation was very messy, because the spikes made the lube fly everywhere, not to mention my entire hand+glove was covered in lube. It felt pretty good, slightly better than just my hand, but the cleanup was not worth it. You'd be better off spending some more money on a real sex toy.   Overall, I give it a 4/10.

It's just running on more general purpose hardware.  Of course you'll never be allowed to use a phone during an exam because they can't police your internet connection.  Where your TI-89 is allowed in a lot of classes (my professors started allowing them in calc 2 and continued to allow them after that)."
AmazonWTF,33x33y,Waffle_Bot,3,Mon Jun 29 01:18:08 2015 UTC,"Very true about phones not being allowed in exams.  I still think, though, that if someone were to create the apps, even a mid-tier smartphone will easily outperform a TI-89 or similar.  If I remember correctly, the TI-89 debuted in 1998, and runs something like a 16MHz processor, making it practically ancient technology-wise. Now I understand that it doesn't need more power for what it does, but I wouldn't call the thing ""modern"""
AmazonWTF,33x33y,lolredditftw,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:02:17 2015 UTC,"Calculators aren't really something I geek out on, but I'm not aware of any big advances in them.  You're absolutely right that general purpose computers can do the same things (even locked down ones like modern phones).  The processor in it would have made it no longer modern the day it came out though.  I'm sure we could do better today, but I'm not sure you'd know while using it.    The price on them is nuts, but it's a niche market."
AmazonWTF,33x33y,agler,3,Mon Jun 29 02:13:45 2015 UTC,"^ All very true.  I bought my last graphing calculator before the iPhone came out and the widespread use of smartphones, so I just couldn't believe these things still cost over $100 new.  But you're spot on about the niche market - if people will continue to pay that much, go ahead and charge them."

AmazonWTF,32980m,the13pianist,71,Fri Apr 24 00:01:25 2015 UTC,"Ah, the infamous fart spray story. Let me explain.  I was 12 years old, fresh out of the shower with a pound of hair gel on my slicked back hair. I decide to take some fart spray to school. I got it over the weekend to impress my friends, so of course I took it.  I get to school and show my friends the spray bottle. They all love it. We all spray it on each other (or try) when we get an idea. The greatest idea ever. To spray a teacher and make her stink.  I don't want to do it. My friend asks me for the bottle. No! I'm not getting in trouble. I eventually give up the spray because I thought it might be funny.  He goes up and gives two sprays right on her ass. All the people in the know start laughing like wild. Holy shit. That stuff was BAD inside. The teacher opens every window. Everyone gets sent outside until one of the persons in the know gives it up.  This teacher had a full on breakdown taking us to the principal's office. God damn.. I got a couple days suspension for bringing it (bullshit, I just showed it off.) The boy who sprayed it got a worse punishment.  His father called my mom absolutely livid about the situation. My mom told him this basically, ""I had no idea he brought it. It's not my fault, it's not my son's fault. It was your son who did it."" He wouldn't see logic. Refused to believe his kid did it."
AmazonWTF,32980m,Laurenosa,58,Thu Apr 30 06:05:16 2015 UTC,"My middle school actually had a fart bomb problem. See, there was this ice cream/snacks truck that was always parked nearby after school and sold those fart bomb packets. We. Went. Ham. Several times a week the hallways would get bombarded with the stankiest stank  and you'd have people running around with their shirts on their noses trying to get to class. Man, we were like little terrorists."
AmazonWTF,32980m,ikahjalmr,16,Sun Apr 26 15:40:00 2015 UTC,Those things are bad. Just one was enough to stink up a nice sized room for 10-20 minutes. That really is terrorism haha

AmazonWTF,32980m,Laurenosa,-18,Sun Apr 26 16:48:04 2015 UTC,"It was a little bit your fault. You were complicent in your friend's actions and you willingly gave it to him to take the fall. If you had said, ""No, that's not right."" It never would have happened.  Your final sentences make it seem as if you think you're blameless, but you're almost as much as fault as the friend who pushed the button."
AmazonWTF,32980m,IAmAGermanShepherd,28,Mon Jun 1 01:27:10 2015 UTC,"That wasn't what I intended. I meant the kid's father wouldn't punish his son. So he tried to put all of the blame on me. I take responsibility for it, but he's the one who sprayed it on the teacher. That wasn't my idea, nor did I want it to happen when I brought it. I brought it to show off.  The only reason I gave him the spray to do it was peer pressure. Everyone who knew about it wanted him to do it. I thought I would be more popular. I was a kid, damn."
