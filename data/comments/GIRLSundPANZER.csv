GIRLSundPANZER,3e47cv,Kapten-N,2,Tue Jul 21 20:55:42 2015 UTC,Girls und Panzer has endcards now?
GIRLSundPANZER,3e47cv,Zen119,2,Tue Jul 21 22:12:00 2015 UTC,For the rebroadcast it does. I haven't been able to get my hands on the ones for Episodes One and Two though
GIRLSundPANZER,3e47cv,uQcaM,3,Tue Jul 21 22:27:17 2015 UTC,Here's are the Garupan endcards of episodes 1-3(can't find a bigger image though):  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CKcyZOfUcAAmLZs.jpg
GIRLSundPANZER,3e47cv,MoroccoBotix,2,Wed Jul 22 01:40:08 2015 UTC,Dafuq is Hana looking at in Episode Two's?
GIRLSundPANZER,3e47cv,uQcaM,2,Wed Jul 22 01:49:45 2015 UTC,She realizes Stalker Yukari has returned
GIRLSundPANZER,3e47cv,MaxRavenclaw,2,Wed Jul 22 02:49:26 2015 UTC,I think Tank Chess needs to be real.
GIRLSundPANZER,3e46b0,XenophonTheAthenian,5,Tue Jul 21 20:39:56 2015 UTC,"It's not a real shooting gallery unless the only prizes are eggplants and caramels!.  Though, considering it's Alisa's stall, she probably does have at least some prizes nailed down"
GIRLSundPANZER,3e46b0,uQcaM,4,Wed Jul 22 03:14:57 2015 UTC,"Source  Y'all know who my money's on ;)  EDIT: I forgot to mention, Alissa's surprised because Hana managed to knock over the target even though Alissa's cheating--she taped a weight (omori) to the back of it"
GIRLSundPANZER,3e46b0,MaxRavenclaw,4,Tue Jul 21 20:40:59 2015 UTC,"Well, if we look at the data, the KwK was more precise than the 122mm and way more precise than the 17pdr. So my money's on Naomi, cause she's shooting the least precise gun, so she has to make up with accuracy.  Wait, what am I saying? Of course my money is on dearest Assam.  But then again, I'm not sure how well shooting cannons translates to shooting snipers. It an completely different game I think."
GIRLSundPANZER,3e46b0,MaxRavenclaw,4,Tue Jul 21 20:48:10 2015 UTC,"But then again, I'm not sure how well shooting cannons translates to shooting snipers. It an completely different game I think.   Hana seems to be doing just fine. And she outshoots Naomi with a waterpistol in Motto Love Love. So she appears to be a good judge of speed and range with any projectile"
GIRLSundPANZER,3e46b0,SunSinger96,4,Tue Jul 21 20:49:53 2015 UTC,"That's probably because fans believe it translates well, but it really doesn't. So you got the wrong causal direction, fans did it because they're wrong, it's not right because fan done it.  But who cares, we'll just pretend they're all snipers. I wanna see Momo shoot. Probably will be the last thing I'll see."
GIRLSundPANZER,3e46b0,uQcaM,4,Tue Jul 21 20:52:49 2015 UTC,yeah but Nonna is a sniper so my money is on her
GIRLSundPANZER,3e46b0,MaxRavenclaw,3,Tue Jul 21 21:14:18 2015 UTC,But isn't Assam a driver?
GIRLSundPANZER,3e27ir,uQcaM,7,Tue Jul 21 11:42:21 2015 UTC,"Here is my idea:  You build electric-powered (a la Tesla) replicas of the tanks (to the same specs1, except maybe for weight).  The tanks fire infared(?) beams at each other, picked up by sensors around the outsides.  Now these beams travel at the speed of light, so on-board computers in both tanks calculate a delay based on the original shell velocities, and determine if it's a hit, where it would be, and how severe it is.  The same principle applies to the mgs (but maybe make it a visible beam to simulate tracers).    ^1 The top speeds of the vehicles would be artificially limited to their realistic levels   Smoke grenades, etc would still be usable.  Loaders would have to load a dummy shell (weighted like the normal shells) before the gun can be fired.  Can have different dummy shells that tell the computer if it's an AP/HE/etc round.  There would also be a (realistic) limit on the number of ""shells"" to be fired  Tank selection would be the same restrictions as seen in GuP.  Replicas are used for several reasons, many of which are cost or safety-related.  First is fuel, which kinda applies to both.  Second is that it allows you to put in the electric motor + batteries as well as the computers and sensors.  Third is that you can have such a variety of tanks as seen in GuP.  Fourth is it's easier on the land where the matches occur.  I think this would be wholly doable, provided you can a) find enough locations to host multiple matches and b) find enough cute girls willing to do this"
GIRLSundPANZER,3e27ir,Bumrusher507,2,Tue Jul 21 11:50:48 2015 UTC,what about blank shells so you can feel the recoil and hear the cannon firing sound? (Do blanks even produce recoil?)
GIRLSundPANZER,3e27ir,Heinz_marble,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:59:56 2015 UTC,"A blank as large as a shell would probibly recoil, just a lot less than a real shell, I like the idea of blanks as they are already used in Reenactments of military battles."
GIRLSundPANZER,3e27ir,FoxtrotZero,6,Wed Jul 22 07:08:02 2015 UTC,"I think the most important part with this is going to be ""how do you fire high-velocity rounds at each other without actually causing damage?""  There's a lot of things to suggest that in GuP they use more-or-less live fire rounds and handwave this with space-age armour inside the vehicles (i.e. the concussive effect of the shells in Maus Trap), which is hilariously dangerous given the amount of time Miho spends in the cupola. There's also some implications that the vehicles actually take mechanical damage (smoke and fire) but you never see any of the teams actually having to deal with holes in their hull or find a replacement transmission.  I'm imagining the vehicles themselves must be built to the specification of an existing wartime vehicle - i.e. your vehicle is valid if the pattern and any modifications actually saw combat - but this sort of thing would depend on league and ruleset. It's worth noting the vehicles in GuP would have to reproductions, there simply isn't that much German heavy metal still running, and you'd have a hard time modifying a museum piece for Panzerfahren. I wouldn't mind seeing a league where teams have to design and build their own tanks, particularly with period-accurate technology caps.  It would take some work, but you'd need shells made of something that will disintegrate on impact with a steel hull, so you'd want some sort of chalk sabot (bonus points if it leaves scorch marks!), designed to have roughly the same ballistics as the actual shell in question. Soldiers in standard field gear train with chalk bullets at damn near point blank ranges, so this should be safe even for super lightly armoured early-war vehicles.  Within the base of said shell is going to be an accelerometer-activated short range radio broadcaster that identifies the vehicle, cannon, shell type, and some basic telemetry data. Every vehicle has a network of hardened recievers embedded in the surface of the hull. The idea is that when the shell impacts the vehicle, it knows where, at what angle, and whether or not it will be a penetrating hit.  A simulated penetrating hit automatically tags the vehicle as out-of-battle. This is going to seem odd if you're used to playing games like WarThunder or World of Tanks, but historically, a single penetrating hit is all it took for a tank crew to get the fuck out of there. Depending on ruleset and simulation ability, you could theoretically knock out crew members or systems independently, but it's not like you're a whole lot of use with a simulated hole in your engine block."
GIRLSundPANZER,3e27ir,AssaultPlazma,3,Tue Jul 21 14:32:28 2015 UTC,Dont forget putting in some serious shock absorbers and padding in the event the tank is violently turned over like we regularly saw in the show. Everyone in that JadgTiger should have broken their neck on that fall upside down.

GIRLSundPANZER,3e27ir,FoxtrotZero,2,Tue Jul 21 15:08:46 2015 UTC,Nope sorry I guess you have me confused with someone else. Pretty sure this is my only reddit account although for a while I was under the name of AssaultSugar but never on reddit with that name.
GIRLSundPANZER,3e27ir,AssaultPlazma,2,Tue Jul 21 15:56:34 2015 UTC,"Actually I was wondering if your name comes from any sort of media. That's why it rang a bell, but I can't remember what it was exactly. It's okay to tell me I'm just crazy."
GIRLSundPANZER,3e27ir,FredericusRed,3,Tue Jul 21 16:05:54 2015 UTC,"Assault comes from the ""Assault"" class in battlefield which is my favorite/most played game series (both overall and for FPS specifically) which in turn is always my favorite class ingame, its also my preferred playstyle.   Plazma is a old name given to me back in a PSP game called ""Ratchet and Clank Size Matters"" some guys recruited me for some little clan called the ""Z Clan"" part of joining was changing my name to PlazmaZ (I was using some dumb random generic name before that)"
GIRLSundPANZER,3e27ir,AssaultPlazma,2,Tue Jul 21 17:37:16 2015 UTC,"The standard rules for in the GuP universe can be easily applied but safety is the primary concern.  Developing a shell that causes no damage and making the tank's armour strong enough while keeping the crew from jostling about and knocking their heads into the metal are a few concerns I can think of.  Hmm... I'm remembering a scene from Kelly's Heroes where Oddball fires a paint shell at a Tiger's rear. Perhaps something akin to this realistically could be possible, but I feel range would be affected and figuring out if a tank is knocked out would be very difficult.  Honestly, I have no idea how to feasibly implement this without spending several years in R&D.  So until then, I'll just watch the Tank Biathalon in Russia."
GIRLSundPANZER,3e27ir,Kapten-N,2,Wed Jul 22 02:08:31 2015 UTC,I remember once reading a fanfic where Miho got hit in the chest by a 75mm Shell.(Carro P40) Apart from being thrown from her tank and subsequently almost run over by only suffered some bruised Ribs by the author >_>

GIRLSundPANZER,3dtfuu,MaxRavenclaw,11,Sun Jul 19 07:47:26 2015 UTC,"I find that r/GirlsundPanzer should be as a fansubreddit should be in my opinion. It should provide fans with a medium to share amateur and original content as well as a forum to discuss episodes, manga and other content.  While I do not specifically like or dislike the lewd content (which is the main concern here, I believe) I see it as an unavoidable part of fan content. I also believe that the people who do like this sort of content should be able to express their appreciation of this, as well as share it with other appreciators.   I therefore would like to see r/GirlsundPanzer as an open and tolerant subreddit where ALL aspects of the Girls und Panzer fanbase can be openly discussed, shared and appreciated by those who want to.   This does not mean that lewd content should not still be designated NSFW, but at least let it be able to be shared."
GIRLSundPANZER,3dtfuu,Hokzwijn,3,Sun Jul 19 12:22:14 2015 UTC,"So, you would change nothing, other than my tendency to forget to mark stuff as NSWF (I fixed that :P)?"
GIRLSundPANZER,3dtfuu,Hokzwijn,2,Sun Jul 19 12:30:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, basically. As long as the subreddit stays diverse. I wouldn't like a constant stream of a single type of content."
GIRLSundPANZER,3dtfuu,Panda_Cavalry,3,Sun Jul 19 16:54:28 2015 UTC,OK. Thank you for your time.

Therefore, I'd probably roll with the anarchist option. Throw back the floodgates and let chaos and WTFery reign.  After all, we need something to tide us over until the GuP movie comes out, don't we?"
GIRLSundPANZER,3dtfuu,Heinz_marble,4,Sun Jul 19 17:43:53 2015 UTC,Great! Thanks for your time!
GIRLSundPANZER,3dtfuu,forthensfwstuff,4,Sun Jul 19 17:48:49 2015 UTC,"I call forth:  /u/V_Epsilon, you didn't seem to have anything against cringe jokes. What's up? What do you like and what not?  /u/XKriegor, I do recall you being a more reserved member of the community at times, but less so at other times. I'm can't exactly gauge how serious you are... What is your opinion? You already answered on the other post. I know now. Thanks for your time.  /u/Bupod, you too showed some concern a while back. What do you say?  I believe thewookie34 was scared off a long time ago, by the Marry-fuck-friend table thread. Haven't seen him since. I'm sorry I made the sub unbearable for him, but so long as most other people prefer it this way, it was a necessary sacrifice. didn't summon him since he hasn't come here in a while, no sense to bring him now  I also summon my other friends and fellow active members of /r/GIRLSundPANZER to partake."
GIRLSundPANZER,3dtfuu,Heinz_marble,3,Sun Jul 19 07:49:50 2015 UTC,"Again, I maintain that the lewd and somewhat off-color stuff might turn off new visitors to the sub. When I think about it, it is unlikely considering that GuP is already a niche in an already somewhat obscure culture (Anime in general). Those that come here are probably already more or less familiar with this sort of thing, and I'm sure have a sense of humor about it.   Where it might be concerning is, for example, someone who is completely brand new to anime as well as GuP. I didn't really watch anime before this, and so when I came on the sub I thought it was pretty neat. When the more crude stuff came along, I thought it was pretty funny, but someone who is jumping in to this out of the blue might bug out, but do you really want someone who is that sensitive?"
GIRLSundPANZER,3dtfuu,Kapten-N,3,Sun Jul 19 18:05:40 2015 UTC,I agree.  Thanks for your time :D
GIRLSundPANZER,3dtfuu,Kapten-N,2,Sun Jul 19 18:14:41 2015 UTC,"As with the more ""Lewd"" Stuff turning away potential members, or just new people, I agree with /u/Bupod that someone who is that easily offended or sensitive to content they don't agree with are not the best people to have here.   That being said, I found out about this sub from /u/forthensfwstuff Lewd albums, I stayed because It is an active and fun subreddit without much drama and any Nazi Mods. From what i've seen, Everyone here is pretty relaxed and chill, and that is what draws in good people to contribute to the sub.   So I will vote NO CHANGE to the subreddit, I like it how it is."

Seeing fan content such as the weekly photoshops can give you a good laugh, and then sometimes you get information about releases, such as the KV-Stronk getting released in figurine form. And I'm sure that when the movie comes out it will have a good amount of discussion on this subreddit. And finally, the reason I actually spend more than a couple of minuets on this subreddit and don't just look at the newest posts then leave is because of the the user interactions, and even then the discussion is 90% of the time about tanks or GuP characters, which leads to casual banter between users in the comment section, whether it be a friendly discussion about tanks, or an outright flame war, makes me spend more time on this subreddit in general.  Oh well, that's just my view on things."

GIRLSundPANZER,3dr99z,Hotglue89,6,Sat Jul 18 18:11:44 2015 UTC,Would it be appropriate to say that this is basically everyone on this sub right now? XD
GIRLSundPANZER,3dr99z,DJhusky99,4,Sat Jul 18 18:17:47 2015 UTC,Right now? What happenings are you refering to specifically?
GIRLSundPANZER,3dr99z,Kapten-N,5,Sat Jul 18 18:19:33 2015 UTC,"Aside from the fact that that was a pretty loose statement, I smell drama coming from the pregnancy thread involving the debate on whether or not it's appropriate to have the fantasies that we do. I see a lot of unnecessary facts being whipped out especially in the middle threads.

GIRLSundPANZER,3dr99z,DJhusky99,4,Sat Jul 18 18:29:04 2015 UTC,ignore /u/uQcaM. The legal sex thing was just his way of making a joke (I hope). he's the resident punmaster... which is something like a court jester.

GIRLSundPANZER,3dr99z,DJhusky99,3,Sat Jul 18 19:58:43 2015 UTC,What downvotes?
GIRLSundPANZER,3dr99z,MaxRavenclaw,2,Sat Jul 18 20:13:55 2015 UTC,One of them is sitting at -1 right now due to their comments
GIRLSundPANZER,3dr99z,DJhusky99,3,Sat Jul 18 20:15:54 2015 UTC,"Ah, well, I guess just like me, not everyone was sure if he was serious or not. He at times does sound like a killjoy, but I chose to believe he's just trolling. I want to have a good opinion of /u/uQcaM and consider him my friend (not sure if mutual). At one time he took a joke too far, but was kind enough to stop when requested, and then I did get a bit of a revenge. Hopefully he doesn't despise me for it. I'm the kind of guy who want's to get along with people is possible. I don't intentionally try to piss people off."
GIRLSundPANZER,3dr99z,MaxRavenclaw,3,Sat Jul 18 20:18:03 2015 UTC,I'd say we're friends.    I can relate with the whole second part of that

GIRLSundPANZER,3dr99z,DJhusky99,2,Sat Jul 18 20:53:11 2015 UTC,This thread is considered the best of all time here

GIRLSundPANZER,3dqfvs,Chappydaseal,3,Sat Jul 18 16:02:36 2015 UTC,I agree.  I'll just be in the subreddit to post the occasional GuP-related links/pics. The community here is rather...eccentric.
GIRLSundPANZER,3dqfvs,SunSinger96,0,Sat Jul 18 17:04:00 2015 UTC,"Here. To be more exact:   I'm guessing that some people are only here for non-lewd cute pictures and very non-otaku, non-hentai stuff. I do believe that those people half of my posts, as the other half should still satisfy them. If so, I'm sorry. If there are so many of you, please tell me and I shall stop. But so long as people like what I do, I'll continue.   You are obviously part of the less ""eccentric"" people here. I'm sorry that this is not completely to your taste and applaud you for being able to filter out what you don't like and come back for what you do. My intention is to make as many people as possible happy. I am capable of being as eccentric as necessary (within limits), or as serious, depending on circumstances.  As for this post, it's just for fun. I'd understand if you'd avoid the lewd albums or other strange otaku posts, but I don't see what you have against this. It's a simple opportunity for laughs and community bonding.  Hey, /u/PikKirby, it's happening, this is the second guy we've scared off. Although this one is braver. Last one ran off and never looked back."
GIRLSundPANZER,3dqfvs,SunSinger96,3,Sat Jul 18 20:43:49 2015 UTC,"While I find this kind of posts weird I do not really object to it as you do have every right to do so.  I am simply stating that I personally will just choose to ignore this in the future and focus more on posting stuffs that I find interesting.  As for community, I have been around for quite some time. Probably not longer than some of you but I check the subreddit at least once per day for almost 2 years.  I'm a really big fan of GuP as you could probably see from the amount of post I made in this subreddit(as I usually don't care too much to post anything). And I do like that there are plenty of people who are passionate about GuP here as I do(or probably even more so than I am).  Now, ecchi/lewd pics I really don't have a problem with. Although some of the younger audience/the parents might be a bit iffy about it. The weird otaku post however is a bit off-putting to me(although I'd still not ask you to stop it as it is within your rights) because while I applaud the fandom(is this the right word to use I wonder), it just seems a bit excessive.  I do have a request though, probably try to tone it down a bit? I know that it's only a few posts so far but hopefully it won't be 50% of actual GuP content post and 50% of whatever this is. Because while I do not object to you guys doing this I will object if it's starting to be the mainstay of the subreddit which should be either GuP-related posts and discussions instead of community meta(is this the right word again? eh, who cares).  That being said, I'd like to invite people here one more time to my Steam group http://steamcommunity.com/groups/KSGuP where we can chat and whatever. Probably as I get to know the people here more I can relate more to this kind of posts(this is not sarcasm or an attempt to talk shit, I am genuinely interested in chatting with people even though I don't really talk much unless I'm posting rants like this :P)  I guess that is all from me, sorry for the rant."
GIRLSundPANZER,3dqfvs,SunSinger96,2,Sun Jul 19 03:18:49 2015 UTC,"sorry for the rant.   Not at all. This actually provides a lot of needed insight into why you didn't like this post. I see. So it's because it's off topic. You have a point. I doubt these meta posts will monopolize the sub, don't worry. I guess I am the only one who actually posted these kinds of posts, I think, with the religions joke thread (which was still somewhat on topic, since the goddesses are from Garupan :P) and this one.  I actually asked Kirby if it was ok to do a debate on the direction the subreddit was going. I'll post it soon enough.  Again, thanks for the rant. I sheds some light on what you and probably other people think about the direction of the sub. I'm not a mod, but I still like to help Kirby keep this sub as cool as possible."
GIRLSundPANZER,3dqfvs,SunSinger96,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:45:52 2015 UTC,Some subreddits allow you to filter posts. /u/PikKirby could for example make it possible to tag a post as meta and then give the option of filtering meta posts.

GIRLSundPANZER,3dfanu,Kapten-N,3,Thu Jul 16 04:30:28 2015 UTC,"Eh, sort of. Noodles probably originated in China, but the claim that Marco Polo brought pasta to the west is certainly bogus--its first appearance isn't until the 20th Century, and appears linked to attempts by food distributors in the US to popularize pasta in America. The Italians had pasta-like foods going way back--Latin texts describe a sort of fried dough in thin sheets (Horace describes this, laganum, and it seems to be somewhat more like a sort of poor person's pancake, but it's a similar idea), and Crusaders encountered similar food of dough cut into strips or strings and fried (or boiled) in Palestine. Plus there's couscous, which to my knowledge has been consumed in North Africa since antiquity. Pasta's not exactly a difficult thing to come up with, its most basic form is just dough fashioned into various sorts of strips or shapes and then boiled"

GIRLSundPANZER,3dfanu,Kapten-N,2,Thu Jul 16 05:35:16 2015 UTC,Tankery originates during the inter-war period it would seem
GIRLSundPANZER,3dfanu,hoochyuchy,4,Wed Jul 15 20:54:02 2015 UTC,I believe it started as tankette racing in Europe. I heard it became popular with women because men were out at war.
GIRLSundPANZER,3dfanu,XenophonTheAthenian,2,Wed Jul 15 21:07:47 2015 UTC,I thought it was a girls only sport because the men were too aggressive or something.
GIRLSundPANZER,3dfanu,Kapten-N,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:04:34 2015 UTC,"The supplementary material from the BDs says that tankette races were popular during the interwar car racing craze (a real phenomenon) but that women during WWI denounced armored combat as excessively bloody, preferring aerial combat, with its limited ammunition and focus on skill. So men stayed largely away from tanks because they were uncool, but women started taking over in the tankette racing world because it wasn't a problem for their image and they had lighter, smaller bodies more easily suited for tankettes.   The supplementary material is pretty funny. For example, they say that mounted naginatado competitions among women were an early influence on later Senshado (as far as I know this was never practiced by women recreationally, although foot naginatado and mounted archery both have strong traditions as female competitive sports). They point to female chariot races in the west as an influence, using Cynisca as an example--she was in reality the first woman to win an Olympic event, the daughter of Archidamus II (and, shockingly, somebody did their research right and realized that she won as the owner of the winning chariot team--in the athletic festivals it was the owners of the horses, nor the jockeys, who entered the competition and won). They go on to talk about female gladiators (who are attested, though are rare, in the textual corpus) and the popularity of chariot racing, although I've never encountered a textual reference to their female charioteers, so I think that's an invention. There's some funny stuff in there--apparently they either made a mistake or thr Garupan universe is different, because supposedly the Eastern empire continued gladiatorial contests after they were banned in the late 3rd Century in our world"

In order of priority, if I may:   Me with Darjeeling on my right arm and Assam on my left :P   Details: Your choice what they wear. Darjeeling is 158cm and Assam is 150cm (oh, God, damn Japan and their midget heights), which means they both aprox reach my shoulder. In conclusion, draw my head out of the screen, and just mark me with my username like you wrote father in the katyusha mother pic.   If you could also draw a picture of Assam in the dress she wore on her first date with Wellington in my fanfic, that would be awesome.   Detail: Dress is knee height, with shoulders... i dunno, something like this?  Take your time, no rush. I know not to rush an artist. :D"

OK, if you want me to nitpick, the bow is a bit off, the hair should probably be a little bit more voluminous, and I think she's too tall, but that's probably just because the drawing style in the anime is different. Regardless, bloody well done, mate! Bloody well done!  As for height. i said it before, I'm 190cm, Darjeeling is 159 and Assam is 150. They reach my shoulder. You might be right, but I'm no artist, I don't get it why it would make me look huge. Think this, this, and this.   But if you think it'd look strange, I guess we could do it your way, sure. But isn't it complicated to draw them that way? Might not be a problem for you, though...  EDIT: Hey, hey, /u/Kapten-N, /u/uQcaM, look at that, mates! Awesome!"

GIRLSundPANZER,3da1lo,uQcaM,2,Tue Jul 14 18:30:13 2015 UTC,It's a program that comes with Photoshop 7.0. called ImageReady.
GIRLSundPANZER,3da1lo,Kapten-N,2,Tue Jul 14 18:33:09 2015 UTC,I don't like PS. Too complicated interface. If GIMP doesn't do it I guess I'll just have to make do without.
GIRLSundPANZER,3da1lo,uQcaM,2,Tue Jul 14 18:52:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think PS 7.0 is sold anymore anyway and I don't know what other programs newer versions of PS is shipped with either. Photoshop 7.0 can't edit animated gifs. ImageReady is a separate program that it was shipped with, but there's a button to move what you are working on between the two programs.  Photoshop's interface isn't all that complicated to me. Though I'm used to 7.0 and have some trouble when using newer versions."

GIRLSundPANZER,3cvxyv,MaxRavenclaw,2,Sat Jul 11 07:26:26 2015 UTC,"Official birthdays of some of the GuP characters were revealed in an official GuP magazine sometime last year. It's being celebrated by the town of Oarai and on Twitter by Japanese GuP fans. Here are those who have official birthdays:  Miho Nishizumi(October 23), Saori Takebe(June 22), Hana Isuzu(December 16), Yukari Akiyama(June 6), Mako Reizei(September 1), Anzu Kadotani(January 1), Darjeeling(September 17)  Assam(December 10), Orange Pekoe - July 10), Anchovy(September 23), Carpaccio(December 19), and Pepperoni(September 12)"
GIRLSundPANZER,3cvxyv,Zen119,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:55:02 2015 UTC,"What, no pieces? Damn! Still, this is all pointless if you want to do a horoscope for them since we don't have the hour for the rising sign or the year. Can only calculate Sun. Not that the horoscope is something to plan you life after, but it's fun to see if it fits.  EDIT: After a little research, it seems the studio went with the most cliched signs, but they do fit.  For example Saori:   Very emotional and sensitive, you have an intuitive understanding of the ""vibes"" around you. You tend to be quite generous, giving, loving and caring, but only when your own needs for emotional support, love and security have been met. If they are not met, you tend to withdraw into yourself and become very insecure and selfish.    Anzu:   Extremely serious and mature, you are capable of accepting responsibilities and do so willingly. Others expect you to be dutiful as a matter of course. You tend to get angry when people get rewards after not having worked anywhere near as hard as you. You are goal-oriented and an achiever by nature -- you're a hard worker and are justifiably proud of the tangible results of your efforts. You tend to have ""tunnel-vision"" -- this allows you to block out extraneous matters that might distract others and to concentrate totally on the matter at hand. As such, you are the ideal one to manage or administrate any ongoing project and to be practical and efficient at it. You are not a fast worker, but you are quite thorough. You are known for being totally persistent, tenacious and tireless in reaching your goals.   The Anzu one is less accurate than Saori, but it's still close enough, or even spot on depending on interpretation. I like it how you can interpret Anzu being angry at Miho at first for now wanting to fight for the school (although she didn't know the stakes at first).. it's a long-shot, but now you see why it's fun to see the signs of characters :P  EDIT: Maybe we should do a thread on this, just for the fun of it..."
GIRLSundPANZER,3cvxyv,MaxRavenclaw,2,Sat Jul 11 08:23:35 2015 UTC,"Forgot to mention this but the official birthdays of the Anglerfish Team also are dates of WW2 significance:  Miho's Birthday is the start of Operation Lightfoot(Second Battle of El Alamein), Saori's Birthday is the start of Operation Barbarossa(German Invasion of Russia), Hana's Birthday is the start of Operation Watch on the Rhine(Battle of the Bulge), Yukari's Birthday is the start of Operation Overlord(D-Day), and Mako's Birthday is the start of Operation Fall Weiss(Case White, German Invasion of Poland)."

GIRLSundPANZER,3cvxyv,MaxRavenclaw,2,Sun Jul 12 07:26:25 2015 UTC,"Nope. A pregnancy lasts 9 months, that's less than a year. A new egg is released every month.

E.g. half the year the age diffrence between me and my sister is 3 years and half the year it's 2 years. I'm very nearly exactly 2,5 years older than her."
GIRLSundPANZER,3cvxyv,MaxRavenclaw,2,Sun Jul 12 07:33:11 2015 UTC,"Exactly 2.5. Even if it's 2 grades older then her, wouldn't that make it impossible for her to take part in Sensha-dou? I mean, Miho is 2nd year... that mean Maho graduated..."
GIRLSundPANZER,3cvxyv,MaxRavenclaw,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:09:45 2015 UTC,"2.5 years between me and my sister. I was using my own family as an example on how the diffrence in age change over the year. I was always three grades ahead of my sister.  Let's see... Miho was born on 23rd of October. Maho's birthday isn't known, but she's one year older. We also don't know when the anime takes place. I don't know either how it's decided when kids start school in Japan. Must they have reach the appropriate age or is it when they reach that age on that year? It's possible that Maho was born during January the same year and Miho was concieved shortly thereafter. If the anime takes place during spring->autumn that would explain the diffrence in age. Maho could also have been born any time during the year before, as long as the anime hasn't passed either's birthday yet as that would make their diffrence in age 2 or 0 years (depending on who's birthday comes first) instead of 1, unless both's birthdays have been passed."

GIRLSundPANZER,3cnnym,MaxRavenclaw,2,Thu Jul 9 09:18:20 2015 UTC,"No, this is a model done by an enthusiast who tried to reconstruct what it could have looked like.  Rules state that tanks whose design was terminated before the end of the war can be accepted after being reviewed. It's uncertain wheter the design for the P43bis was ended (because the documentation is scarce and not always available), but there's a possibility that it might have ended. So, it theoretically be used, probably."

GIRLSundPANZER,3cnnym,MaxRavenclaw,2,Thu Jul 9 09:28:37 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... well, to be honest, in this respect I've noticed a detail in the Anzio OVA.  While IRL the Semovente da 75/18 had its best success using EP and EPS shells (hollow charge shells, to clear it up), the shells that Carpaccio was loading during the duel with the StuG III looked a lot like ""normal"" AP ones (with which its performance against armor was less than impressive).

I know that depending on interpretation you could be nicer with Shiho and the Team Mom Federation, but I don't wanna! My fanfic revolves around how the antiquated single-sex school system and the Federation's stubbornness almost lead to the downfall of girls-only schools. Boys only and mixed schools however, had no fewer financial problems because not being allowed in the National Tournament, they instead went to more competitive private tournaments that had better prizes. Girls schools had a traditionalist view and refused to accept anything but the official national tournament, which almost led to their downfall. Or at least that's my economic and cultural interpetation for my fanfic."

GIRLSundPANZER,3cirs4,Kapten-N,2,Wed Jul 8 06:02:24 2015 UTC,"This is the theory that I've subscribed to regarding the ammunition used in senshado. Basically they are somehow incapable of penetrating anything. The carbon coating is just on the inside of the armour to prevent the armour from flaking and sending of splinters and not some kind of super material that stops bullets.  Yes, this is a fan made image. Still, it demonstrates the theory perfectly. Also it is vital to my headcanon regarding a mixed combat sport..."
GIRLSundPANZER,3cirs4,PikKirby,2,Wed Jul 8 06:06:18 2015 UTC,Maybe Miho knew all the time; that's why she does not fear being outside during battles?
GIRLSundPANZER,3cirs4,DaftPrince,3,Wed Jul 8 06:21:51 2015 UTC,"Well, it's still dangerous because they could malfunction... Actually, that's one of the storylines in my headcanon."
GIRLSundPANZER,3cirs4,uQcaM,2,Wed Jul 8 06:25:55 2015 UTC,"While the theory explains a lot I just don't see how it could be physically possible, not to the degree of hitting people without injury. Even if you made them out of rubber they still wouldn't be safe. People have been seriously injured and killed by rubber 9mm bullets, a 75mm rubber shell would do a lot worse. No matter how soft it is it still has to be somewhat heavy to fly any great distance and that weight makes it lethal at speed. Honestly, the fact that they need carbon coating to prevent spalling just proves that the round hits hard enough to kill.  It's possible that the thing somehow disintegrates on impact. That doesn't happen in the show but you could just say they changed it for the combined arms games. I'm just not sure how you'd achieve that. If the round explodes on impact then that's HE and you've actually made it more lethal. If it somehow instantly melts before impact then you're just showering people in molten metal which isn't great. If the thing stops its motion before impact then... well the only thing that could possibly do that fast enough is a forward directed explosion and now you've just invented HEAT rounds. Possibly the round is soft and doesn't require such force to disintegrate, like a paintball for example. But then if something is so easy to break then I doubt it would survive being shot out of a cannon.  I just had an idea actually. You could fire a paintball from a discarding sabot that holds it together while it fires. It would lose a ton of velocity and accuracy when the sabots discarded, thanks to the large wind resistance and low weight, but it would be safe(ish). Actually hitting people with a high-caliber paintball would still be pretty dangerous, so instead you could air-burst the thing. A tiny radar detects when it's within a couple of meters of anything, like a proximity fuse, then triggers a tiny explosive which pops  the paintball and splatters its hapless victims with paint. I even drew a picture."

Did you know that, same with Anzu, I only started liking Saori after I understood her character. At first i thought she was just another easy girl who switches guys every week. Then i realized she was actually all talk, but was actually shy and modest, searching for true love. M-hm."
GIRLSundPANZER,3cefbi,uQcaM,2,Tue Jul 7 10:37:12 2015 UTC,"Indeed. I agree with that statement.  I like Anzu too. Kinda. Mostly for her short body and cute face, but also the playful part personality. Though there are other aspects of her personality which I'm not as fond of.  EDIT: Also the cooking! I forgot to mention that I find the fact that she cooks to be one of her attractive aspects."
GIRLSundPANZER,3cefbi,uQcaM,2,Tue Jul 7 10:44:58 2015 UTC,She probably would be switching guys every other week if there were guys to chase luckily there aren't.
GIRLSundPANZER,3cefbi,uQcaM,2,Tue Jul 7 13:33:42 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that. Shy and reserved people generally learn to value a relationship more than people who can easily get hitched.

GIRLSundPANZER,3ccyx5,XenophonTheAthenian,2,Mon Jul 6 23:09:13 2015 UTC,"Took me a while, and I accidentally ordered the wrong aftermarket tracks (I'll have to build the F2 with them, they're the mid-war Pz IV tracks, so I had to re-order the 38 cm early ones, which is what she's wearing), but she's finally done! I can put her next to Hippo's StuG on my shelf, and eventually they'll be joined by Turtle's Pz 38(t) next. Build details can be found here"
GIRLSundPANZER,3ccyx5,Heinz_marble,2,Mon Jul 6 23:11:36 2015 UTC,What is your favourite varriant of the panzer series? I would go with the IV but something about the V/panther just takes the number 1 spot.
GIRLSundPANZER,3ccyx5,Kapten-N,2,Mon Jul 6 23:52:26 2015 UTC,"Easily the IVD--it's so cute! The Pz IV doesn't have the rugged meanness of later panzers, and its sort of utilitarian not-quite-ready-for-war quality (it was an early war design, after all) gives it a sort of rinky-dink cuteness. The Ausf D in particular has a special quality--the A, B, and C seem sort of...unready somehow, like they're not quite finished designs. The E has that ugly stowage box to the rear of the turret and changed the shape of the front crew plate. The F has the same problem, and the F2 and G seem somehow unbalanced. The H is kinda cool, but it looks sort of thrown together and I think the schurzen, awesome as they are, are really ugly. But the D is like the cutest thing ever made, it's got the proportions of a full-sized chibi tank"
GIRLSundPANZER,3ccyx5,uQcaM,2,Tue Jul 7 00:00:09 2015 UTC,Personally I think the stowage box (isn't it actually a counter weight for the longer cannon?) makes the turret look better.  Wasn't there an I or J version too which was a stripped down version made towards the end of the war? It was meant to be quick to produce.  Personally I think III is cuter than IV. I'm also quite fond of the I and II. There's something about the early war tanks that makes the lower tiers more fun to play in WoT.
GIRLSundPANZER,3ccyx5,uQcaM,2,Tue Jul 7 03:36:27 2015 UTC,"The stowage box on the Tiger was a combined stowage bin/counterweight, and as I recall the whole damn thing was metal, and only parts of it were usable for stowage. The stowage bin on the Pz IV was introduced on the E, although a lot of Ds in Africa were fitted with them by their crews and some out east were retrofitted with them. The E had the same gun as the D, and so did the F1--the F2 was identical to the E except for its gun. The 75 mm wasn't really long or heavy enough to need a counterweight--it was a purpose-built AT gun in a rather spacious turret, ad opposed to the Tiger's modified AA gun in a turret not much bigger than the Pz IV's  But yeah, the J existed. The J's ugly and silly though. Many of them got those silly mesh screens, they only had three return rollers and steel-rimmed tires, and their internal mechanism was a mess (the electric turret was removed, and the gunner had to traverse by hand, multiplying turret traverse by several times!)"

GIRLSundPANZER,3ccyx5,uQcaM,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:03:47 2015 UTC,"Is the 38t going to be gold, or the later paint scheme?"
GIRLSundPANZER,3ccyx5,uQcaM,2,Mon Jul 6 23:34:31 2015 UTC,"Definitely the later scheme, I like panzer grey. Platz issues a special edition version molded in gold-chromed plastic, but it's brittle and impossible to glue. I could assemble the regular kit and airbrush it gold, but airbrushing metallic and gloss paints is a pain in the ass"
GIRLSundPANZER,3ccyx5,Kapten-N,2,Mon Jul 6 23:36:40 2015 UTC,The solution is to simply mold it from pure gold.
GIRLSundPANZER,3ccyx5,martialsporK,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:37:26 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that if you built a 38t using gold leaf, it would have thicker armour than the production version"
GIRLSundPANZER,3ccyx5,MaxRavenclaw,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:22:00 2015 UTC,"While I see where you're coming from, I have to counter with this:  Everything looks better when it's gold!  Like this for example"
GIRLSundPANZER,3ccyx5,MaxRavenclaw,2,Tue Jul 7 00:02:58 2015 UTC,"Anglerfish doesn't know that you are supposed to lift up the stepladder, except Mako who actually read the manual, but she's too tired to say anything."
GIRLSundPANZER,3ccyx5,MaxRavenclaw,3,Tue Jul 7 03:30:59 2015 UTC,"Nah, there's a perfectly normal explanation for it, I just didn't want to get into it. The tanks in Garupan are computer-animated. The standard way for Japanese CG units to do this is to construct a model and then manipulate it in space--since anime CG models are generally used the way they are in Garupan, to depict moving vehicles with physics and stuff, as well as to save money (not like, say, Pixar, where everything is computer-generated--though there are fully CG anime, like Arpeggio) it's not only unnecessary to construct additional models to depict changes in the model itself occurring on-screen, but wasteful. It's time-consuming and expensive--and CG's great advantage isn't its improved physics, but the fact that it's cheap and fast. Garupan's CG models are pretty masterfully connected with more traditional methods, to depict movement of characters or burning wrecks, but changing small things like that would be a waste. Far simpler to construct one model and stick with it. If you look at the DVD covers you'll notice that one of the inconsistencies with the model as it is in the show is that the stepladder is up in its stowed position--obviously somebody was aware that it could do that on the staff (not hard to believe--Mizushima is supposedly obsessive about detail, and a lot of the bits in research in Shirobako were allusions to the effort he puts into getting every single bit right) and when freed from the constraint of continuity with the CG models, since the cover art is totally independent, decided to draw it that way.   In any case you do actually see pictures of Pz IVDs with their ladders down while in combat or with the engine running--this build, for example, is a diorama version of a rather famous phot (that I can't frigging access for some reason) showing a Pz IV crew underway with their step down. It was an easy thing to forget, especially during combat, and it could be a pain in the ass to remember to deploy the step while getting out, especially if you were under fire or dazed from combat. More importantly, it's not like it actually fouled the tracks or anything--leaving it down wasn't dangerous at all, just not normal (and presumably against regulations)"
GIRLSundPANZER,3ccyx5,MaxRavenclaw,2,Tue Jul 7 03:50:57 2015 UTC,That is niiiiice.
GIRLSundPANZER,3ccyx5,uQcaM,2,Tue Jul 7 05:06:40 2015 UTC,"You changed your flair. While I must admit it is more appropriate, does it mean you've disbanded the church?"
GIRLSundPANZER,3ccyx5,uQcaM,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:19:47 2015 UTC,"The old flair was a reference to a user's flair on /r/awwnime, not to an actual church (I mean, of course, how could it be, but you know what I mean). Liked this one better"

The epithet for Achilles' spear (actually only one of the epithets, the other main ones are ""Pelian ash"" and ""bronze-tipped"") is usually translated as ""heavy, huge, thick,"" following Richmond Lattimore's convention. Literally it means something more like ""heavy, big, sturdy/stout."" The idea in Greek is that it's big and hard to handle--only Achilles can carry the spear out of all of thr Achaeans"

GIRLSundPANZER,3c5m8l,MaxRavenclaw,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:47:09 2015 UTC,the spear is considered in the Iliad to be the only manly weapon   What? Why?
GIRLSundPANZER,3c5m8l,XenophonTheAthenian,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:55:07 2015 UTC,"Bows are cowardly and effeminate. While bow say have been common in the Mycenean Period, Homer really describes a sort of fantastical version of the late Dark Age and early Archaic Period, where it seems that the Classical scorn of bowmen was well established--by the Classical Period with the exception of rhe Cretans no Greek people practiced bowmanship. When Paris uses his bow it's supposed to be a reinforcement of his cowardice and effeminacy--he hides behind everyone else and kills men who can't fight back. The dominance of the spear over the sword is harder to explain. There's nothing unmanly about a sword, it's just a sidearm, not a weapon. This holds up into the Classical Period--swords were drawn only when spears had been shivered, and it's usually described as remarkable when a line has to draw swords, indicative of order and discipline breaking down as the two sides mix with each other and formations begin to break down. Already in the Iliad the sword isn't really treated like a weapon, it's treated like a sidearm, a pistol of sorts (this, mind you, is roughly equivalent to the sword by soldiers, ashigaru and samurai both, during the Sengoku Jidai--only after the Tokugawa banned all weapons but swords did the sword start to get its semi-mystical adherence that we think of as connected with the Japanese sword today). I'm not really sure why the sword was thought of like this. On the one hand, during the Bronze Age functional sword blades had to be quite short, since bronze will bend, limiting the utility of the weapon. But Greek metalworking had progressed since the beginning of the Dark Age, and probably already by the end of it the complex and varied iron sword types that we see in the historical period were in existence--the historical Greeks had saber, or scimitar-like swords, short straight swords like those rhe Romans carried, thinnish sorts of swords and my personal favorite, the ""butcher blade."" Swords may not have had that much use, since a heavily-armored battle line in close order is a terrible place to swing around a sword. I would expect this to be a Dark Age thing that was passed on to the historical periods, since Mycenean art and archaeology show swords to be quite common, though by far the most prevalent weapon is the spear. Spears also have more penetration power, being the only weapon capable of punching through the e heavy armor of a hoplite--this seems likely to me, since heavy hoplite armor appears well before the hoplite line does"
GIRLSundPANZER,3c5m8l,MaxRavenclaw,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:44:25 2015 UTC,"Yes. Swords, despite popular belief, were sidearms.   Bows are cowardly and effeminate.   I didn't think of that. A very interesting interpretation.   it's usually described as remarkable when a line has to draw swords, indicative of order and discipline breaking down as the two sides mix with each other and formations begin to break down   Also a fascinating interpretation.  OK. I understand their logic. I guess they didn't have pikes and big swords back then. Me, I'm more of a gladius and pilum guy :P"
GIRLSundPANZER,3c5m8l,XenophonTheAthenian,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:59:12 2015 UTC,"Me, I'm more of a gladius and pilum guy :P   For what it's worth, pila probably doubled as thrusting spears. Plutarch famously describes Caesar's fourth line using their pila as pikes at Pharsalus, and since Caesar makes no comment on this tactic it was probably pretty common as a means for repulsive cavalry. Caesar says that Labienus' cohorts at Alesia, while defending their forts at the final Gallic assault, dropped their pila, which they appear to have been using as pikes--they would've done nothing as javelins from inside the fort palisade, and they wouldn't have needed to drop them, they would've thrown them. There are passages elsewhere in the textual corpus that don't make sense if pila weren't used as spears as well as javelins"
GIRLSundPANZER,3c5m8l,MaxRavenclaw,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:11:12 2015 UTC,"But, wouldn't they bend after the first successful thrust?"
GIRLSundPANZER,3c5m8l,XenophonTheAthenian,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:32:55 2015 UTC,"Probably not. I'm not a military historian, so I don't know too much about equipment. But it's usually thought now, as far as I'm aware, that the pilum didn't really bend, it punched through armor and snapped. The bending thing is from an unclear passage, whereas the snapping has a little more authority (I think Plutarch mentions it, but I'd have to check). Originally the pilum was just a heavy sort of javelin, but at some point it was given additional weights and a little bolt holding the head that would snap off due to the inertia of the weights, preventing the weapon from being thrown back. Thrusting probably wouldn't do the same thing. That it pierced armor is well-attested--Caesar, for example, says that the Helvetii in their phalanx were so close together that their shields overlapped, and so each javelin pierced right through several shields, fixing them together and impeding movement"

GIRLSundPANZER,3c1crh,Panda_Cavalry,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:09:47 2015 UTC,"Erm, what?  If you mean my new flair, it's ""Type 3 Medium Tank."" As in the Chi-Nu.   Not gonna lie, I am mildly confused right now."
GIRLSundPANZER,3c1crh,Kapten-N,3,Sat Jul 4 18:12:32 2015 UTC,"I can't read kanji, so I just transcribed your flair as it looked to me."
GIRLSundPANZER,3c1crh,Panda_Cavalry,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:35:26 2015 UTC,"Well, that's certainly the most creative translation I've seen in a while.   For me, it's the opposite. I can't read hiragana or katakana, but since kanji is basically Chinese script (with a few modifications here and there), I can usually muddle my way through.   Anyways, I've changed my flair slightly, so now it says ""Type 3 Medium Tank Chi-Nu Kai""."
GIRLSundPANZER,3c1crh,Heinz_marble,3,Sun Jul 5 19:45:19 2015 UTC,"Awesome flairs, if we could get larger ones i would suggest tank flaires! Panzer 4, tiger, sheman, matilda, etc etc"
GIRLSundPANZER,3c1crh,uQcaM,2,Fri Jul 3 22:16:46 2015 UTC,Double / Multiple Image Flair Systems are confirmed for the CSS overhaul.  You'll be able to choose a text flair + tank + school/team.
GIRLSundPANZER,3c1crh,uQcaM,3,Fri Jul 3 22:18:18 2015 UTC,...or character?
GIRLSundPANZER,3c1crh,Heinz_marble,2,Sat Jul 4 12:18:43 2015 UTC,"Probably one of the easier ones to do + many variety. I love char flairs, I was going to do that originally like /r/madokamagica and /r/oreimo but teams seemed much more fitting here."
GIRLSundPANZER,3c1crh,Kapten-N,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:28:24 2015 UTC,"How about just couple character flairs for now, then shift them when the second flairs come around?"
GIRLSundPANZER,3c1crh,Kapten-N,2,Sat Jul 4 19:33:17 2015 UTC,"Amazing, this sub is getting better and better"
GIRLSundPANZER,3c1crh,Kapten-N,3,Fri Jul 3 22:19:54 2015 UTC,Testing.  EDIT: Can't see my own flair or flair text.
GIRLSundPANZER,3c1crh,sharonpvs,3,Fri Jul 3 22:32:44 2015 UTC,"Added text flairs back (Disappeared for no reason...), give Reddit a second, or an hour... or five."
GIRLSundPANZER,3c1crh,sharonpvs,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:44:10 2015 UTC,"It's been awhile now. I still can't see my own flair on my comments. Neither image nor text. I can see it in the sidebar where I choose it though.  Do you see my flair?  EDIT: There we go. This one has the flair, but the previous comment doesn't. :/ Shouldn't the flair be applied to all my past comments as well?  EDIT 2: And now it's gone again... Editing my comment removed the flair. :/"
GIRLSundPANZER,3c1crh,uQcaM,2,Sat Jul 4 03:40:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I have no idea whats going on either... (I can't see it either)  edit:   At first I thought it was flair-specific related because you are the only one to be using that flair... nope. /u/sharonpvs' works, so it's not that.  I checked the css and it seems that Reddit is not even generating the images/flair; at all.  I removed flairs, re-added... didn't work again. I'll try that again but maybe try waiting.  I guess the only thing I can suggest is try switching diffrent flairs randomly, sometimes just leave both empty; try again..? (Not being of much help here...)  Umm.. also try reloading the page and doing it (For most browsers, right click anywhere on the page and then reload)  Reddit being weird.   I'll keep trying other solutions / look into it. I emptied your flair+text for now; try again in a day or so."
GIRLSundPANZER,3c1crh,uQcaM,2,Sat Jul 4 06:09:59 2015 UTC,"Triple Reply.  Deal with it.  Try two things, go into Reddit and make sure you have Flairs enabled. Also it could be RES interfering if you are using it; reinstalling could help too."
GIRLSundPANZER,3c1crh,V_Epsilon,2,Sat Jul 4 06:15:16 2015 UTC,Nothing helped when I tried it. But now after a while it's visible.
GIRLSundPANZER,3c1crh,uQcaM,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:01:13 2015 UTC,Great! Glad it worked. Enjoy the flair.

GIRLSundPANZER,3c1crh,uQcaM,2,Sat Jul 4 19:26:33 2015 UTC,I'm not the one to ask about that.  I just try and keep cool heads all around
GIRLSundPANZER,3c1crh,MaxRavenclaw,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:32:19 2015 UTC,Now I see this.... should have asked back then...
GIRLSundPANZER,3c1crh,uQcaM,2,Mon Jul 20 07:41:42 2015 UTC,"*facepalm* I don't even...  I though we agreed it was one sided. What happened with Overly Attached Stalker part?  EDIT: First of all, you don't need to add /u/ to the name. it just wastes space, as for all intents and purposes the link is not clickable. Second of all, sure, don't call yourself a stalker, that would mean admiting the futility of your cause and would be OOC, but I still think Notice me, MaxRavenclaw-senpai! would work better. What do you say /u/V_Epsilon?"
GIRLSundPANZER,3c1crh,MaxRavenclaw,3,Sat Jul 4 06:36:47 2015 UTC,"What do I say? I think the current flair is perfect, and that I've generated some salt it seems XD  The /u/ ensures that people know you're a user on Reddit and helps them to understand our unbreakable relationship easier. As for taking up space I don't think that's a problem as the entire thing fits anyway, so an extra 3 characters makes no difference"
GIRLSundPANZER,3c1crh,uQcaM,2,Sat Jul 4 12:11:55 2015 UTC,"What do I say? I think the current flair is perfect, and that I've generated some salt it seems XD   Frankly, I kind of stopped caring. You got me at first, I'll give you that, but now I'm too broken between Fluffyism and going back to a pure Gloriana flair to bother with this.  uQcaM agrees ""notice me"" is funnier, and it would fit the situation better. I still recommend you change it to that, and you'll get my approval. As it is, it doesn't really describe the situation well enough for me to approve.  And if you're doing it just to troll me, I'm over that shit, don't waste our time. It's not funny anymore, the same way the fluffy war between me and uQcaM stopped being funny so we stopped it. Ultimately, it only takes one part to leave the ""battle"" for it to end. Continuing past that is just stupid.  So, if you want to continue this, I'll indulge you as long as 1. you don't expect me to RP constantly, 2. you don't cross the line again into cringe-worthiness and 3. you switch to the superior flair  Again... why couldn't you have been a girl. This would have been a lot less uncomfortable."
GIRLSundPANZER,3c1crh,MaxRavenclaw,2,Sat Jul 4 14:05:06 2015 UTC,"""Frankly, I kind of stopped caring, more text, TL;DR intensifies, something about wanting me to be female""  Well, can't argue with that. Being a female would be sweet for most of every month!"
GIRLSundPANZER,3c1crh,MaxRavenclaw,2,Sat Jul 4 16:25:40 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to dislike you. If you want us to interact, at least show the common courtesy of reading what I'm telling you.   uQcaM agrees ""notice me"" is funnier, and it would fit the situation better. I still recommend you change it to that, and you'll get my approval.

You want to be friends, keep this fun or are you just here to troll me?"
GIRLSundPANZER,3c1crh,uQcaM,2,Sat Jul 4 16:30:24 2015 UTC,"I prefer this flair, I still imagine you as a Yandere in denial so it works better imo"
GIRLSundPANZER,3c1crh,SunSinger96,2,Sat Jul 4 16:52:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah... nice fantasies you got there. Although frankly I never threatened you. I threatened uQcaM. And even if I did, a Yandere is always dere with the love interest, and kills rivals, neither of which applies to me. At best, I'm tsundere, but even that I only joked about in like 2 comments.  Even so, your flair just makes it sound we're a couple, plain and simply, no funny undertones. But do what you will. I'm out. Can't agree to this RP.  Pity, with the exception of our talk talks we were off at a nice start... until you started doing this."

GIRLSundPANZER,3c1crh,uQcaM,2,Sat Jul 4 15:05:01 2015 UTC,"Wiki wise:  Not sure if making the welcome a header is a good idea, it fucks up with the table of contents. Also, while I am on Yukari's side, the welcome should be neutral, not Yukari oriented. And linking to the subreddit is pointless, as it's where people visiting the wiki will be coming from.  My rec: get rid of the links, keep the font and size but remove the header (not sure if possible)  The coming after is genius, but it saddens me that we will have to remove it after we add the albums. Any suggestions on how to keep them? striker-through but keep?  Freedom intensifies should be under saunders. I'll fix that.  You removed your religion? It must be there for--- actually it doesn't need to... technically it wasn't a religion. For all intents and purposes, you were under my religion... OK, we'll keep it out. I added a disclaimer on my page, I guess we should have added one here as well. GJ.  EDIT: The entire header part is fucked. I'm fixing it now."
