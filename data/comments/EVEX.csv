EVEX,3dvuso,Offbeat_Blitz,2,Tue Jul 21 18:21:55 2015 UTC,"That sucks, dude. I've had a similar experience, but I don't think she cheated. I think she just had the hots for him for ages and left me for him. He was one of my best friends, and looking back on a lot of the stuff he said, he really egged the breakup on. I wasn't sure I was going to make it through that time. Losing a girlfriend of 3+ years was hard, but losing a good friend simultaneously was insane. I'm sure you know the feeling. I can only take solace in the fact that at least people who are capable of doing that to someone they claimed to love are no longer in my life."
EVEX,3dvuso,OodlesofNoodles89,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:27:48 2015 UTC,I only confirmed it a year later through someone who was close with her that she had even though I had confronted her about if she liked him before. I probably should have just let it go but I needed to know for sure in order to move on. They started dating very shortly after we broke up and both of them cut contact with me completely. At first I just thought that he had just took her side in the breakup and just naturally got together afterwards. I am actually not as bitter about it any more because mutual friends have told me that they are very happy and in love. It left me with a lot of baggage though and I blame her for it.

An opinion: I dont think X is right. (Without arguing why)  Opinion + Argument should be in caps as the opinion is part of the argument more often than not.

As this animation seems to demonstrate almost intentionally, yes. To me, I feel the animator has crafted this dinosaur's emotions with an ambiguous quality to them. It's as if the artist calls one to draw his/her own conclusions as to the emotional state of the dinosaur. Yes, it is very clearly riding a bike, but why does it ride the bike? Where is it going, where has it come from? These are question left open by the animator, there is no context provided to support a definitive answer. I have a great deal of respect for the design of this piece. Personally, this animation conjures feeling that this dinosaur enjoys BMX in me. It depends, does one illegally download the graphic design software, or does one purchase it?"

As opposed to the current interpretation that it has a minimum of one week, then voted on the following Friday (2nd Friday after proposal).  SO THIS REFERENDUM SHOULD BE VOTED ON THIS FRIDAY.    On a side note, I can't find any mention of the 2 week expiry in the original rule suggestion. Where did it come from? Is it any clearer in the original, or is the wiki text a verbatim copy?"

If there's going to be support for a referendum, that's generally enough time and this is what we've always gone by. This referendum already had its two Fridays and didn't make the ballot either time.  It was put in place so that we wouldn't have to keep track of hundreds of never expiring referendums every week.

I haven't worked that part out yet)   On a scale of 1 to 10, what does your favourite flavour of colour in the alphabet sound like? How would you describe a spiral staircase without using any geometric term? What could people do to better understand others? What is more worth doing than asking this question?"
EVEX,3d5xsr,mrmiffmiff,2,Mon Jul 13 20:11:34 2015 UTC,"Well, since you look like you can use some help, I'll say a few things, though you won't find me very satisfying.  I don't have any experience with Reddit's wiki system, but I do have experience with other wikis, and I pick up on these sorts of things really quickly. Computers are my thing (well, software-wise, at least), so to be honest that shouldn't be an issue.  Collecting data to put on the wiki. Now there's something I have experience with. This summer I've been working at a data-extraction-and-entry internship. Compared to that, editing the library and making sure it was up to date would be quite exciting.  Now, for those interview questions. Okay.   On a scale of 1 to 10, what does your favourite flavour of colour in the alphabet sound like?   7, chocolate, blue-no-yellow-ahhhhhhhh, R, doot doot.  I hope that answers that. Unfortunately my synesthesic abilities are lacking.   How would you describe a spiral staircase without using any geometric term?   Stairs that turn all the time.   What could people do to better understand others?   Literally switch places with them for the while. Like The Prince and the Pauper.   What is more worth doing than asking this question?   Playing Valkyria Chronicles."
EVEX,3d5xsr,Forthwrong,2,Tue Jul 21 04:05:17 2015 UTC,"you won't find me very satisfying   Don't tell me what to do. The Department Invested in Curation Knowledge takes orders from nobody.  Follow-up questions (actually they aren't follow-ups to anything you said; they're just other questions that I want an adequate introduction to):   How are you finding these questions? What did you wake up to today? Is suffering necessary to live? If you could lose one thing and not ever worry about it again, what would it be?"
EVEX,3d5xsr,mrmiffmiff,2,Tue Jul 21 11:38:49 2015 UTC,"How are you finding these questions?   Like there's a hidden purpose to them.   What did you wake up to today?   My alarm on my phone, playing A Call to Arms from the Warcraft III soundtrack.   Is suffering necessary to live?   No, but suffering is necessary for the concept of good to exist. Without evil and suffering, there can be no good, for there is nothing to compare to.   If you could lose one thing and never worry about it again, what would it be?   The necessity of eating to remain alive."
EVEX,3d5xsr,Forthwrong,2,Tue Jul 21 16:02:17 2015 UTC,"The purpose of these questions is to trick me into thinking the questions have a purpose. You're doing good so far! Why don't you continue by asking me the questions, for a change?"
EVEX,3d5xsr,mrmiffmiff,2,Tue Jul 21 17:01:37 2015 UTC,"Trick you, or trick me?  Well, alright. Let's see.   You have a horrible deadly disease that will kill you in five days. The only way to cure it is to pass it on to someone else. You can pass it on to anyone in the world. Do you let it kill you? Or do you pass it on to someone else, and if so, who? (And no, they will not be able to pass it on further.) What's most valuable to you: Strength, intelligence, or wisdom? On a more logistical note, if I were to take this job, how would we work out deciding who does what work? How enjoyable has it been to be Curator? Do you secretly hold plans to take over the world? Was getting caught part of your plan? How often do you truly sit down and listen to someone talk about their life?"
EVEX,3d5xsr,Forthwrong,2,Tue Jul 21 17:54:52 2015 UTC,"Trick me, not you.   I'd spend those days making my decision. If I don't reach a decision by that time, I let it kill me. If I make my decision, I have my decision. I think throwing time at a decision can make it easier to make, and can make the decision less based on ephemeral biases. At any given point in time, it's likely that my judgement is being affected by a wide range of things, but if I base my decision in many such points in time, my decision is less likely to be biased by these ephemeral things. I should say: while I'm interested in removing some ephemeral biases from my decision, I'm not interested in removing all emotion from my decision; I would surely consider my and others' emotions as well. Not physical strength. To make the question more challenging for me, I'll consider ""strength"" to mean mental strength, as in willpower and that stuff. I'm not sure what you mean by ""wisdom,"" since I'm more used to it being used for rhetorical/poetic effect or as a synonym of intelligence, so if you wouldn't like to clarify (or, if this question is intended to get me to question it), I'll disregard wisdom. That leaves me between mental strength and rational strength (intelligence), both of which I value greatly. But in terms of what's valuable to me, egotistically rather than rationally, I'm inclined to say mental strength, because that's what I think would more reliably promote my well-being than rational strength. We would communicate what we want to do, and base our activity on that. Or we just strike. It's not drugs, but it's not insufficiently enjoyable. No. They're not secret at all. Yes. Depends on how emotional my friends are feeling lately; can be anything from daily to monthly. But if they want to, I'll do my best to understand and empathise with or advise them, depending on what I think they want (I often end up just asking. I like questions). Listening often makes me feel good.   Not follow-up questions (and keep asking your questions as well; this is getting fun!)   How honest are you? How much of a red herring does the above question seem like to you? What do you most appreciate about yourself? What would you do if you woke up one day and everyone was inexplicably gone?"
EVEX,3d5xsr,mrmiffmiff,2,Tue Jul 21 19:49:31 2015 UTC,"My apologies; to clarify, I'm using wisdom as a semi-synonym of ""experience."" Theory vs. practicality, all that.   I like to think of myself as very honest. Actually, back in high school, I was known for being brutally honest. I don't sugarcoat things, I don't lie. I give it to you straight. That being said if my parents call me one day while I'm sitting in my dorm alone and ask what I'm doing, I'm not going to tell them I'm watching not-safe-for-work materials. But in actuality, I do try not to lie in general, because I believe lies are a cause of great despair in the world. Slightly less Red than communism, but more Red than Trainer Red from Pokemon. My dry wit. Well I'd probably starve to death at some point. But, assuming I had some permanent way of sustaining myself, I'd attempt to make my way to the Doomsday Vault in Norway, hope I got there before electrical power completely broke down, and hope artificial uteruses (uteri?) was nearby. Because, you know, I'd at least attempt to restart the human race... In actuality I'd probably catch up on my backlog of books... couldn't do video games since no electricity :( Well I guess I could bring the books with me on my journey to Norway, so both then.   Now, questions, questions, alright:   On a scale of Model-T Ford to Light, is Sound the best speed? What is your favorite smell in the world? What is the most relaxing thing you've ever done? Are you relaxed right now? What, in your opinion, is the most important thing that every person should go do right now?"
EVEX,3d5xsr,Forthwrong,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:26:53 2015 UTC,"I'd still prefer intelligence or mental strength over experience; I think intelligence+time gives better experience.   No; mach 5 is better than mach 1. That of my teddy bear ^^ The time I felt most relaxed, I was lying down, just listening to radio, and a song reminded me of someone I loved, and I thought about how they touched my life. I didn't notice those thoughts made me so blissful that I could cry until after I'd finished thinking them. Yeah; thinking about that time is relaxing enough. Think about something intently.   I was right; this is fun.   What languages interest you the most? What languages that you know relatively little of interest you the most? Is it okay to kill a mosquito? What do you take for granted? For what in your life do you feel most grateful? What is your least favorite thing about humanity? How much love should one have for oneself? Do you want to be remembered for something? Can people fundamentally change their self? Flight or invisibility? If you could invent a new sense, what would it be? Who would win: astronauts or cavemen? What would constitute a “perfect” day for you?"
EVEX,3d5xsr,mrmiffmiff,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:53:11 2015 UTC,"Dead languages nobody cares about like Latin and Aramaic. Only the females. Those are the ones that bite and don't buzz. The ones that buzz don't bite, they're male. The relative ease of my first world life. My wonderful family and friends. That the only thing stopping humanity from advancing is humanity. Like about 5. Plenty, but leave some for others, too. Yes, I want people to remember me for my advancements in computer science and philanthropy. (It won't happen.) I believe that people have a nature, but that nature can be overcome through effort. The pervert in me says invisibility, but the practical man in me says flight. Empathy. Understand other people's emotions inherently. Both are pretty fit, cavemen because they're fighting sabrecats or something and astronauts because they have to stay fit or their muscles will atrophy, but astronauts have the modern tactical fighting strategies. So astronauts. I mean, remember, almost all astronauts were military at some point. Either my state of being forever alone ceasing or making extremely good headway in my backlog of video games and books with absolutely nobody bothering me all day.   Alright. What else can I ask?   Is it better to be born good, or to overcome your evil nature through great effort? What is it to be human? What is it to exist? What the hell is a Grand Slamwich? You are given an opportunity to receive powers beyond your wildest dreams. You may either use them in a predetermined way to guide humanity to peace and prosperity, and be able to maintain contact with the people you love, or use them however you wish, but you are never allowed regular human contact ever again. Your choice? Who are you? Don't tell me your life story, tell me about you, as a person. One sentence. What would you do for a basket of Cheddar Bay Biscuits? What thoughts does the word ""neutral"" conjure within you? Same for ""balance."" 5 or 39?"

EVEX,3cc1vn,kuilin,4,Mon Jul 6 19:12:23 2015 UTC,"Since it became illegal to present genitalia in art, tentacles and other objects were soon substituted. The strange evolution from well-drawn, interesting and well-made art to disturbing, awkward scrawls began in 1868, when the Japanese decided to impress their round-eyed cultural overlords by cleaning up their traditional forms of art.Until then, sexual and erotic images had been respected, and accepted even in mainstream arts.  An unfortunate side effect of all this prudish censorship was the proliferation of terrible drawing.   Eventually, these awful drawings- divorced from their traditional use of the chinese fixed-perspective, and unable to capture the use of western linear perpsective- became a subject of unholy worship by some in the west who had no taste.  Thus anime was born and nurtured by westerners who felt that the shitty scraps of paper were somehow redeemed because they were made by magical foreigners, and the ruthless and wholesale soul-selling by japanese artists began, as they raced to the bottom in the pursuit of the mighty,mighty american-virgin dollar.  All previous ways of representing the human figure in the region- 3/4 view faces, linear and 2D lines expressing flow and substance- were soon mashed into impenetrable blobs.Soon the western audience began tracing and copying these awful designs, painting them on pillows and humping them rabidly. The destruction of japanese pop culture for the lascivious enjoyment of the west is currently in progress and can be observed in any fetid backwater of the internet. This, in essence, is anime.  http://i.imgur.com/QVDyXAu.jpg  Kitagawa Utamaro; Lovers in the upstairs room of a teahouse, from Utamakura (Poem of the Pillow); c. 1788.   an example of pre-american erotica.   http://pm1.narvii.com/5708/1665e47d297ba82591e1f40d3744e9e4d5d63238_hq.jpg  example of the current state of erotic art, otherwise known as anime.

EVEX,3by8lx,forknox,8,Fri Jul 3 03:46:50 2015 UTC,No. We don't know what happened. What if they were right to fire Chooter? Why do the reddit admins ruin that strange place known as /r/Iama for no reason? They make money from it. Maybe there was some miscommunication. Throwing a tantrum is childish. You will be throwing your lot in with vitriolic people who don't really care about reddit but who just want oppurtunities to be bullies.  Also remember this is an internet thing and all it will accomplish will be making everyone who took part look like idiots.
EVEX,3by8lx,Agent78787,27,Fri Jul 3 03:51:20 2015 UTC,This is less about Victoria at this point and more about how the admins don't communicate with their userbase and that leads to shitstorms like the IAmA situation. The Victoria thing is just the straw that broke the camel's back. Every time they say they're going to do better for the mods and the userbase and then another fuck up happens a week or two later. People are sick of it.
EVEX,3by8lx,forknox,3,Fri Jul 3 03:53:59 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah but this is all mixed up with the Victoria thing and everyone's coming up with nutty conspiracy theories. This will eventually merge with all the other rubbish(which has more supporters) and this issue will be forgotten or worse this might get co-opted by the FPhers etc(you can see them joining in on their subs) and there goes any chance of this being taken seriously.  The mods can even seize the subs if they want. I just don't think being overly antagonistic will solve things. I myself don't have an alternative solution...just wanted to say no..."

EVEX,3by8lx,AllyMacv,2,Fri Jul 3 03:57:13 2015 UTC,"But what if we're doing it for the lulz?  And besides, I don't think you can correlate this situation with, say, the tantrum the FPH guys made when their hate sub was banned. In this case, chooter was an important part to keeping the community functional, and even if she was justly fired reddit handled the situation badly by not notifying all the big subreddits that relied on her to function. That strange place known as /r/IAmA is an example.  Also, remember rule 24, you should edit your comment."
EVEX,3by8lx,ReverendMajors,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:55:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can correlate this situation with, say, the tantrum the FPH guys made when their hate sub was banned.   Yeah, this situation is different but the same people are joing in and nothing good could come of such a mob.   In this case, chooter was an important part to keeping the community functional   Yeah, but I think it was misscommunication. I mean, why would reddit want to sabotage their own money making sub? I'm pretty sure they want a solution to this too.  I'm just not sure why the admins would want to sabotage such a popular(and non hate filled) sub. Treating them like the enemy here makes no sense.  Also comment edited."
EVEX,3by8lx,AerMarcus,2,Fri Jul 3 04:18:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, however the admins have been repeatedly fucking over mods and users over and over again. People are tired of the lack of communication and abrupt changes without warning. This site would be in shambles if all the default mods and other major mods decided to just quit. Yet despite they hold this power, the mods stay because they like reddit and would like to see it grow. To be treated like utter shit is disappointing. The mods don't have an obligation to mod.

EVEX,3bx0kn,Spikycentaur,22,Thu Jul 2 21:12:24 2015 UTC,"Interesting little puzzle. One of the comments in the analysis was that large numbers of people would guess what the Rule was without having ever entered an incorrect combination. They enter a series of guesses which are awarded a 'Yes' verification and they assume they must have the rule all figured out already.  My job is IT Tech Support and it is critical that I have a full understanding of the problem at hand so that I can fix it. I need to see the hardware/software failing to learn about the problem. Then I proceed to fix the problem.  So as soon as I had a theory about what the rule might be, I immediately entered a combination of numbers that didn't conform  to the rule to see a 'No' outcome. As it happens I got an unexpected 'Yes' outcome and I knew my 'draft Rule' was incorrect. Time for a new theory.

The fire stopped for a moment, allowing Clara to peek over the top. Her eyes widened as she took in the scene. Standing on the stairs above, dressed in black, was the heaviest-armoured enemy she'd ever seen, complete with a massive shield. Going down to one knee, the figure placed a large weapon on its shoulder, pointed at her. Frozen into inaction, Clara squeezed her eyes shut, waiting for the shot.  But at the last moment, a blur of white entered the room, smashing through an upper window. Twin uzis blaze at the armoured figure, knocking the aim off. Clara ducks as the rocket whizzes over her head. The figure landed, rolled, and drew a katana so quickly Clara almost misses it. Mouth agape, She watched as the white-robed woman sliced into the thick armour, gouging chunk after chunk away, exposing flesh. She wipes the sword quickly, then turns to Clara, ""What are you waiting for? Go!"" ""Y...yes Ma'am!"" Clara ran forward, up the stairs and into the corridor. The white woman stepped out of her way, then follows The objective is just ahead. Clara was surprised, was she actually going to get there?  No. The wall to her left buckles and collapses as a tank rams through it. Clara has nowhere to go. She fired uselessly, until the tank crushed her legs.

I'm looking at you, Dave!  On an entirely unrelated topic, it is requested that asprin be delivered to the Alexandran Parliamentary Offices, and that noise be kept to a reasonable level until such time as the Senior Alexandran Parliamentary representative has recovered from his sudden and unexpected illness."

EVEX,3b9a3m,NatNoBrains,5,Sat Jun 27 07:46:53 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of Elizabeth Warren.  I'm not trying to insult Warren - I support her political positions, respect her as a person, and think that she is a good politician - but for some reason this photograph of a piece of cabbage wearing glasses results in my mind making a connection between this moderately nonsensical image and Elizabeth Warren, the senior United States Senator for Massachusetts and former Harvard Law School professor. I don't know why, but it does."

There had not been any pictures of cabbage posted yet, but it was two in the morning and I thought it was silly enough to get some people to chuckle.  The following week the majority of posts were cabbage related. My off-hand comment was apparently worth more than just a chuckle, and we were stuck with a running gag that had no substance deeper than ""Haha! Cabbage!"".  If my suggestion had garnered enough votes to make it to the ballot that week, it very well may have ended up being the first rule. I definitely would have voted for it. I pretty quickly became genuinely sick of seeing pictures of cabbage.  For the most part the cabbage fever didn't last past that first week, but every once in a while someone brings it up again.

EVEX,3b1qo6,storyandsong,5,Thu Jun 25 07:33:53 2015 UTC,"Here's what I have in mind, though if others want to do something different I'd happily oblige.  Each player will be one member of some legislative body. Let's pick something out of the great realms of story and song, like the fictional British Parliament. We probably wouldn't have actual people electing people to the House of Commons, since that would require a lot more than 12 people. For people to get into Parliament, they can just go in a thread and ask.   Players would attempt to pass laws and make regulations that benefit their nation and constituency. There would be restrictions on what you can and cannot do, of course; you can't pass a law that punishes people who state that a certain continent is real with banishment for life. That would be silly, right?  I'm also thinking of random events to make things more interesting. I used the example of secessionist demonstrations in my reply to /u/Jade_Lance here.  If you have any more questions, I'll happily answer."
EVEX,3b1qo6,storyandsong,3,Thu Jun 25 07:54:01 2015 UTC,Would we be doing these things in specified threads or just in self- posts on the sub?

Each County has one Good Thing, one Bad Thing, and one Goal.  Possible Good Things:  Wealthy, Well-Educated Populace, Tourist Center.

I'm in favor of that, but we may need to find a way to simulate it well, lest it becomes too biased. For example, some say that Democracy 3's simulation of government rewards progressive and left-wing policies too much and makes being a conservative/libertarian much harder than it should be.    Another thing:  I DON'T THINK REGIONS (AND BY EXTENSION, PLAYERS REPRESENTING SAID REGIONS) SHOULD HAVE A ""GOAL"" PER SE. AFTER ALL, SCOTLAND MAY HAVE MANY PEOPLE THAT WANT TO SEPARATE FROM THE UK, BUT NOT EVERY SCOT WANTS TO SECEDE. IMO, A BETTER ALTERNATIVE IS TO HAVE RANDOM EVENTS OR PROBLEMS THAT THE PLAYERS ARE REQUIRED TO SOLVE THROUGH THE GREAT STEAMROLLER OF DEMOCRACY (OR OLIGARCHY, IF WE'RE SIMULATING SOMETHING MEDIEVAL).   For example, a random event may be a series of demonstrations advocating for secession in one region. The representative for that region may choose to support a law that gives more autonomy to that region or grants it independence altogether. Alternatively, the representative can support a law that cracks down on secessionist protests in that region. Either way, if the representative screws up then someone else can replace him/her, or maybe there may be more negative events (a pro-secession guerilla movement?)"

Of course not just because of me, but how long would this take to set up?  One problem I always have with model UN's is how little power the real UN actually has compared to governments (or corporations if we want to go there). I'd be fine with either a real or a fictional government, as long as it's not the US or UK. Not that I have something against them, but those two always get picked for something like this. So Indian parliament? I have no idea how that works, but sure, why not.  Finally, not that this is going to happen in our current state, but it in hypothetical future Evex with thousands of active subscriber, my favourite option would be to simulate three governments of different structures nations. So many different layers of cooperation and negotiation."
EVEX,3b1qo6,Kryptospuridium137,4,Thu Jun 25 08:38:52 2015 UTC,"can we start this after July 18th?   I really want to start it ASAP to stop people from just forgetting about it, but you're welcome to join the simulation anytime. It's not like there's a long queue of people wanting to join anyway. It probably would take a week or two to set up (getting the procedures right, deciding on what government we want to simulate)   as long as it's not the US or UK    I'd oppose that too. It's already been done on reddit anyway, as you can see from the subreddits I linked to.   simulate three governments of different structures   What, like President, Supreme Court, and Congress? Or national and provincial governments? That would be really cool, I agree; I believe the US government simulation subreddits do simulate a President and a Supreme Court, and even state governments (/modelusgov does, anyway, not sure about /musgov)"

The point is that it doesn't always make sense to focus on the average person's tastes. Consider that in the '70s, the average person would not have been into punk music. Yet it became one of the biggest influences on the development of popular music. What's more relevant, the preferences of the audiences of the time?

EVEX,3apx8g,orost,6,Thu Jun 25 05:45:16 2015 UTC,The referendum has failed.  If you exclude the abstain votes:   Yes - 65.22% (75/115) No - 34.78% (40/115)   The yes votes don't quite meet the 2/3 threshold under any normal way of calculating it.
EVEX,3apx8g,wobatt,3,Mon Jun 22 16:31:50 2015 UTC,"Hah. Would help if I did the calculations before posting about waiting, huh? Thanks."
EVEX,3apx8g,orost,6,Mon Jun 22 16:33:02 2015 UTC,"Question: is the wording ""that strange place known as"" an absolute requirement, or is creative variation on it in line with the spirit of the rule acceptable?"
EVEX,3apx8g,wobatt,11,Mon Jun 22 16:11:39 2015 UTC,"It is a requirement because the wording of the rule specifically says ""preceded by the phrase"" and has the phrase in quotes."
EVEX,3apx8g,Tobl4,4,Mon Jun 22 16:13:45 2015 UTC,"I would like clarification on the rule...   All /r/ subreddit links must be preceded by the phrase ""that strange place known as""   If I submit content, and put in the title that it is a cross post from /r/, then it doesn't make it link to the subreddit.  So does it count?"
EVEX,3apx8g,wobatt,4,Mon Jun 22 16:38:32 2015 UTC,You must only do this if you're linking to another sub. Cross posts don't link to the subreddit in question so you're good. If you mention a sub using /r/ in a comment though (or submit a link to another sub as a link post) then the rule would apply.
EVEX,3apx8g,wobatt,3,Mon Jun 22 17:02:19 2015 UTC,What about r/subreddit. That works now just like /r/. Think of the loopholes!
EVEX,3apx8g,LaughRiot68,5,Mon Jun 22 17:06:34 2015 UTC,"I WOULD SAY THAT SHOULD BE UNDER THE RULE, BECAUSE ALTHOUGH IT ISN'T EXPLICITLY SAID IN THE RULE, IT FOLLOWS THE SPIRIT OF IT."
EVEX,3apx8g,LaughRiot68,2,Mon Jun 22 19:01:51 2015 UTC,And don't forget /r/subreddit.
EVEX,3apx8g,Tobl4,6,Mon Jun 22 17:32:36 2015 UTC,"No actual link, so it avoids the rule; nice loophole!  For those without RES to view source, this magic was done this way:   /r\/subreddit"
EVEX,3apx8g,LaughRiot68,3,Mon Jun 22 19:04:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah. But the rule specifically says it has to be a link and doesn't say any mention of another sub, so I don't think this is really a loophole. Though, I'm sure the author of said rule wasn't thinking about escape characters, either."
EVEX,3apx8g,Forthwrong,2,Mon Jun 22 20:04:24 2015 UTC,What about linking to a specific post within another subreddit?

EVEX,3akiqr,Ordinary_Fella,10,Sun Jun 21 04:52:17 2015 UTC,"Well, for most of the pieces, the difference is only a few percentage points, which probably isn't enough to be significant. This makes sense, because most pieces will be used the same way by a given player regardless of the color. The only exception are the center pawns. That's because those pawns are often used in opening moves, where white will usually send one or more of them out aggressively. Black is less likely to respond the same way with those pieces, so they're less likely to be lost."

I see chess as the means, rather than the destination, of the tournament, so I'm wary of encouraging powergaming.  Of course, if both players are fine with playing their game a different way because they would both enjoy it more, I'd always allow it provided it doesn't make certain games seem out-of-place or inappropriate in the tournament.  Of course, the difference between taking a minute to think about a strategic defense and taking a minute to google it isn't exactly something we can discern (while discerning computer moves vs human moves is more plausible), so it's up to the player whether to look it up or think it through.  On the other hand, if someone is playing a weird opening, they're more likely to be so acquainted with chess that looking up the appropriate defense would be necessary just to keep up with their skill. But if that would be a reason to allow outside help, the problem would shift to drawing the line determining how much outside help is too much outside help, and this would be even more difficult to enforce."

MAYBE I'M IN THE MINORITY, BUT PERSONALLY, I ONLY LOOK AT THE SIDEBAR WHEN I WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING SPECIFIC SINCE OTHER SUBREDDITS HAVE TRAINED ME THAT THERE'S RARELY IMPORTANT INFORMATION IN THE SIDEBAR. WHAT'S MORE, MANY MOBILE CLIENTS HIDE IT ENTIRELY UNTIL YOU SPECIFICALLY ASK TO SEE IT.  THE SUGGESTION THREAD ON THE OTHER HAND IS ONE OF THE CORE THREADS OF THIS SUBREDDIT AND THE ONLY ONE THAT REQUIRES YOU TO LOOK THROUGH THE COMMENTS TO FULLY PARTICIPATE IN THE RULE CREATION PROCESS. THE UNIQUE FORMAT OF MY POST THEN MAKES IT PRETTY EASY TO SPOT.

EVEX,3a7rz8,FIERY_URETHRA,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:26:31 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, and I'll be sure to post the sign-up thread at a time that's reasonable for the timezones that are most populated here; I'm thinking around 14:00 UTC, which is 07:00 on the US west coast, 10:00 on the US east coast, 16:00 nigh everywhere in Europe that got invaded by Hitler, and 00:00 on the most populated side of Australia.  I don't think a referendum is necessary; there's nothing official or procedural that we need about it. Historically, people have been keen to point out that such contests don't need an official rule/referendum to take place. But I think a monthly chess tournament would be great, and if interest is shown for it to become a regular event, I'll be sure to submit a referendum for special flair for the winners."
EVEX,3a7rz8,kuilin,2,Thu Jun 18 12:48:38 2015 UTC,"I didn't see the last thread but I think this sounds like a great idea! I'm no good and haven't played much, I love playing though.  Couple of things I'd mention are that I think it would be extremely difficult to get people to show up at the same time. Timezones are a thing and people will have free time at different times that might not overlap at all.  Also we can make a pretty good chess set in reddit comments:     a b c d e f g h    1 ♜ ♞ ♝ ♛ ♚ ♝ ♞ ♜   2 ♟ ♟ ♟ ♟ ♟ ♟ ♟ ♟   3           4           5           6           7 ♙ ♙ ♙ ♙ ♙ ♙ ♙ ♙   8 ♖ ♘ ♗ ♕ ♔ ♗ ♘ ♖"

All of the games of one round needn't occur simultaneously; that would be a major hassle.  I'll certainly ask what times people will be available at in the sign-up thread, and I anticipate—based on the demographics of reddit, the demographics of Evex, and Evex traffic stats—that most people's availabilities will overlap.  What I see as an issue is that if people whose timezones share no overlap play a correspondence game, it could, without exaggeration, take months for just one game to finish. I think it would be fundamentally inconvenient to the tournament if a single game lasted a month; I believe this so much that I think that if someone's availability doesn't overlap with the availability of the majority of other contestants, they should either go out of their way for the sake of the majority or not participate."

Two posts promoting the same subreddit must be seperated by either 5 other posts or 24 hours, whichever is shorter. Posts made by the promoter and posts promoting other subreddits do not count towards this limit.   ""Posts promoting a subreddit"" include:   Links to that subreddit  Links to posts on that subreddit Crossposts from that subreddit Self- and Link-posts made to promote that subreddit     I don't want to ban advertising subreddits alltogether since it's possible to find interesting new subreddits this way and it can show new ideas as to what kinds of content could be posted here, but at the same time I don't want Evex to become a multireddit of whoever is the most persistent."
EVEX,3a5tsc,Agent78787,4,Wed Jun 17 14:41:31 2015 UTC,"I strongly support this suggestion.   I understand if you try to promote your subreddit here (and I do support that) with one or two posts, but it quickly becomes people spamming their links to further their agenda. These guys are posting their promotion posts not in the interests of /r/EVEX, and are actually making this subreddit worse by their incessant spamming.  If I was to change this suggestion at all, I would actually add posts in the subject matter of a subreddit to the definition of posts promoting a subreddit (edit if that user has made a post explicitly promoting that subreddit edit 2 and the user has a history of promoting said subreddit in /r/EVEX).   This is to ensure that people post varied content without an agenda and to clarify that even if you don't say ""xpost from /r/whatever"" you still promote the subreddit and you still can spam /r/EVEX with promotion posts without explicitly naming the sub. (edit: OTOH, since users won't be greatly restricted unless they incessantly, repeatedly, and explicitly promote a subreddit, users won't be greatly restricted in their ability to post content.)"
EVEX,3a5tsc,Tobl4,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:46:00 2015 UTC,"PERSONALLY, I THINK THAT WOULD BE TOO INCLUSIVE, SINCE THE GOAL OF THIS RULE IS TO PREVENT PROMOTION, NOT CONTENT THAT HAS BEEN PROMOTED.   But if more people chime in that they'd like to include that, I'll reconsider adding it."
EVEX,3a5tsc,kuilin,2,Thu Jun 18 15:23:39 2015 UTC,"I think there's a loophole here.    Posts promoting other subreddits do not count towards this limit   So, technically... someone could promote /r/pics, and then promote their own subreddit as many times as they'd want because it would be indemnified by the above phrasing in relation to their promoting /r/pics?"
EVEX,3a5tsc,Tobl4,3,Thu Jun 18 14:52:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand your counter example. This is how it's supposed to work:   /u/A promotes /r/pics. There need to be 5 other posts before anyone can promote /r/pics again. /u/B (or A again) promotes /r/aww. There need to be 5 other posts before anyone can promote /r/aww again. There need to be 5 other posts before anyone can promote /r/pics again since promotional posts do not decrease that number.   English isn't my first language, so if I need to word that differently to have that effect, please tell me how I should phrase it."
EVEX,3a5tsc,kuilin,0,Thu Jun 18 15:20:05 2015 UTC,"Yea I know, and your comment is really clear in that regard, but there's still technically a loophole since you're basically indemnifying posts made in between two posts that promote the same subreddit, which contradicts the rule applied with respect to the posts that were indemnified.   Two posts promoting the same subreddit must be seperated by either 5 other posts or 24 hours, whichever is shorter. Posts made by the promoter and posts promoting other subreddits do not count towards this limit.    So I could make a post that promotes /r/pics, and then apply this rule to that post. Thus, now I make 10 other posts about my small startup subreddit, and I can claim that they ""do not count towards this limit"" because they match the second sentence, that they're made by the promoter (me) and they promote a different subreddit than /r/pics, and so therefore they ""don't count towards this limit""."
EVEX,3a5tsc,Tobl4,2,Thu Jun 18 15:25:58 2015 UTC,"THEY DON'T COUNT TOWARDS /r/PICS' LIMIT, HOWEVER, THEY DO HAVE THEIR OWN LIMITS.

EVEX,3a5tsc,_AUTOMATIC_,11,Wed Jun 17 19:08:09 2015 UTC,"I hate /u/PostNationalism's posts and believe that he is trying to entice people into political circlejerking. (Seriously, /u/PostNationalism, stop spamming /r/EVEX.) However, I do think the problem's not political posts in general.  I think there can be a lot of interesting posts about politics. For example, for those of you who remember /u/googolplexbyte, his/her posts about range voting in the earliest days of /r/EVEX (see here) are very interesting. Obviously, /u/googolplexbyte has an opinion on the subject, like /u/PostNationalism has an opinion on his posts.  However, /u/googolplexbyte's post is interesting and sparks discussion while /u/PostNationalism's posts make spam look like filet mignon. Googol did not spam the sub with range voting stuff, and is willing to engage in discussion as well.  TLDR: Politics posts are fine if you don't spam. I would love to see /u/PostNationalism banned though."
EVEX,3a5tsc,Agent78787,3,Wed Jun 17 21:58:05 2015 UTC,I would love to see a system implemented where people can vote to ban certain users. Not through rules though.
EVEX,3a5tsc,_AUTOMATIC_,7,Wed Jun 17 22:03:26 2015 UTC,"Nah, I don't want a vote-to-ban thing. It would make the sub a lot more hostile, and I'd rather not prefer a torches-and-pitchforks mob in /r/EVEX.   I probably didn't say it correctly. What I want is for /u/PostNationalism to stop plugging his crappy subreddit on /r/EVEX every damn day."
EVEX,3a5tsc,Agent78787,2,Wed Jun 17 22:12:05 2015 UTC,"Actually, it would make EVEX more hostile, which is the opposite of what I want. One reason I want to ban politics instead of just him, is that otherwise, I would just be doing that vote-to-ban thing, but in rule form."
EVEX,3a5tsc,_AUTOMATIC_,3,Wed Jun 17 22:15:02 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. I think the problem with /u/PostNationalism is that he spams, not that he spams politically charged posts. If we ban politics, we could have the exact same thing happen again, except it's an extreme Trekkie and Star Wars Hater named /u/PostJedi or something. A ban on politics would not stop the inherent problem of ceaseless self-promotion.  Now we see the violence flaws inherent in the system! (That flaw is self-promotion spam.)"
EVEX,3a5tsc,Agent78787,3,Wed Jun 17 22:21:21 2015 UTC,So do you propose we ban self promotional spam? How would we go about enforcing that?
EVEX,3a5tsc,_AUTOMATIC_,4,Wed Jun 17 22:28:41 2015 UTC,"This rule by /u/Tobl4 is almost exactly what I want.   The only thing I would change is that posts in the subject matter of a subreddit count as promoting that subreddit if you already explicitly promoted that subreddit. For example, a photo of a cat standing up would count as a post promoting /r/CatsStandingUp if you previously posted something explicitly promoting /r/CatsStandingUp."
EVEX,3a5tsc,Agent78787,2,Wed Jun 17 22:37:44 2015 UTC,"I am so sorry to use this argument (and to play devils advocate), but where do you draw the line? If somebody promoted /r/aww and posted a picture of a cute animal, would that be allowed?  If somebody promoted /r/askreddit and asked EVEX a question would that be allowed?  If someone promoted /r/EVEX and posted in EVEX would that be allowed? (of course it would) But you know what I'm saying. I'm not trying to argue against this rule, just asserting that it is important to specify how a rule is enforced before you pass it."
EVEX,3a5tsc,flameoguy,3,Wed Jun 17 22:48:08 2015 UTC,"You're right. That's actually a flaw I haven't thought of.   Say you post an xpost of a cute animal from /r/aww and explicitly promoted the subreddit. Then you post another cute animal within 24 hours without a 5-post separation. Then, that would be a violation of my proposal, right? It would be, and it shouldn't be.  Maybe this flaw would be rectified if my amendment to /u/Tobl4's rule only applied to people that had an agenda to promote the sub. You know /u/PostNationalism wanted to promote his sub, while our hypothetical cute animal poster only wanted to post cute animals.  So, my amendment is to treat self/link posts in the subject matter of a subreddit without explicit mention of said subreddit (saying it's an xpost or linking to the sub or the sub's post) as a post promoting a subreddit if and only if the author of the post has a history of promoting the said subreddit in /r/EVEX. In this case, cute animal guy would not be affected, but hopefully EVEX will be Post-PostNationalism."

EVEX,39xsqn,rideride,8,Mon Jun 15 19:57:13 2015 UTC,"I've been there for months, it's empty and inactive.  The programmers seem to have entirely overlooked the fact that they did not put data in to test the performance.  They must have only created a few hundred users, a few dozen subs, etc.  The code ""seemed fine"" when the data was nearly empty and all was in RAM.  Now when people start using it, their essentially non-data-tested code and data storage system is crumbling.  it's also Microsoft ASP.NET - which can be less flexible when it comes to getting servers and costs.  I wish them well, but the signs are not looking good.  Reddit had a long history of problems in the early years to deal with influx growth and problems.  I'm still scratching my head why nobody has started a new brand for reddit using the existing open source Python code on github.  Same reddit code - but different managers and owners."

These guys seem far more interested in this as a personal software development project.  Reddit's features are fine. The 99% reason people are even talking about voat is due to management, owners, ideals.  But there is this disconnect that people don't realize that voat is unproven software and the guys who run it keep talking about adding new programming features.  The real question is why are redditors so lazy to have not supported independent reddit sites (different names) on the open source reddit software?  It runs on Linux, seems to be Python.  Even the vote fuzzing code could be changed back to the old scheme - it's open source and we could change the ~6 lines of code."

Yeah, the more reddit cracks down on hate subs that actively break rules, the more of the people from those subs are going to migrate over there because ""censorship"". Hell, I was over there the other day and there were 3 posts on fat people on my front page. And, I'm not fat (In fact, I've been a mixed martial artist for nearly 2 decades), but I don't need to see that shit.

It is slow, loads only small chunks of the comments when you open a page (and loads more as you reach bottom), and it had almost no users or content.  The number of users is small and it's falling over. It was running slow before the FatPeopleHate events at reddit.  It takes 20 seconds to load pages, they keep taking it down to fix it, etc.  Like I said, it's a scratch code base that is unproven.  Nobody has an existing book or FAQ on how to tune it.  Right now the demand is for new management, new owners, new ideals.  The ""new code"" seems their focus entirely.  Different features, different approaches to voting rules, etc.  All this is technical-oriented changes.  Like programmers who create video games and don't seem to have any art skills.  They were already programming on it for 2 years. Are they really wanting to deal with the daily social issues of such a site?"

The double standards in journalism and pandering to a faux outrage movement (entitlement police) that don't like to look at context before whipping up their followers into a furore.

EVEX,39xtrt,WalrusWarlord,5,Mon Jun 15 17:57:24 2015 UTC,"""Fast track"" is not the same as passing the bill. Fast track allows congress to pass or not pass the bill in a simple up or down vote after 90 days of debate, with the full contents of the agreement being public. It isn't a method of pulling the wool over the eyes of an unsuspecting public, but rather a way to prevent amendments to the bill. Amendments are not allowed because they would make negotiating an effective trade agreement virtually impossible. For instance, the house member from Pittsburgh may work for special exemptions for the steel industry. Multiply that times each house district and their equivalent representative in each member nation and the up and down vote begins to make a lot more sense.  Let's grant congress fast track, and when the bill is released in its final form, reject it if it is bad, and support it if it is good. A vote for fast track need not be a vote in confidence of a bill that we haven't read."
EVEX,39xtrt,NicCageKillerBees,2,Mon Jun 15 21:30:42 2015 UTC,But we already know it's bad. Why not make as much noise about it as possible?
EVEX,39xtrt,NicCageKillerBees,3,Mon Jun 15 23:38:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure that we know that it is bad because the final text of the agreement hasn't been released. Reddit has a couple of things that it is scared of in the agreement, and while they have downsides, I don't think they are as bad as reddit in general thinks.  One point of contention is that the bill is being negotiated in secret. The bill is being negotiated in secret so that the countries can write the best bill that they can with politics getting in the way. If such a bill was negotiated in public, we'd have every politician in every country in the negotiation trying to carve out pork (such as our house member from Pittsburgh carving our special deals for the steel industry again) for their districts or interests, and as a result the agreement would be completely ineffectual.   Another point of fear is Investor-State Dispute Settlements (ISDS), or the so called, ""secret courts."" Reddit is pretty scared of these, but I think a lot of that fear is overblown. ISDS is pretty standard as far as trade agreements go. We have one in NAFTA, for example. While companies can ""sue"" (technically it isn't suing since it is arbitration and not a court, but they are similar in practice) a foreign country, this isn't a guarantee that the company will win. In fact, corporations or investors only win 31% of the time, 42% favor the state, and 27% of cases reach settlement between the parties.  The reason why we have ISDS is to protect investors in states with weak rule of law. Vietnam, for example, is entering the TPPA, and having ISDS will help make the country a more attractive place to invest, bringing many people out of poverty.   Other than ISDS, do you have any other reasons why you think the agreement is bad?"
EVEX,39xtrt,officerpup,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:33:00 2015 UTC,"I think the fact that negotiations are secret is the most terrifying part. If we can't see the bill, why would we allow anyone to vote on it? I'm all for being skeptical, but not being against a Kafkaesque law seems absurd to me."

There is also this bill sponsored by Marcy Kaptur of Ohio (https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hres301) the Trade Review Accountability Needs Sunlight and Preview of Any Regulations and Exact Negotiated Components resolution, but it hasn't been voted on yet."
EVEX,39xtrt,NicCageKillerBees,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:25:32 2015 UTC,"This means that rules for regarding how the public is able to access the bill (internet, emailed pdf, ect.) have to be developed at most 120 days after fast track is passed.

EVEX,39k211,autowikibot,5,Fri Jun 12 07:31:17 2015 UTC,"Shape of the universe:       The shape of the universe is the local and global geometry of the Universe, in terms of both curvature and topology (though, strictly speaking, the concept goes beyond both). The shape of the universe is related to general relativity which describes how spacetime, that is, the fabric the universe is made up of, is curved and bent by mass and energy.  There is a distinction between the observable universe and the global universe. The observable universe consists of the part of the universe that can, in principle, be observed due to the finite speed of light and the age of the universe. The observable universe is understood as a sphere around the Earth extending 93 billion light years (8.8 *1026 meters) and would be similar at any observing point (assuming the universe is indeed isotropic, as it appears to be from our vantage point).  The shape of the global universe can be broken into three categories:    Finite or infinite Flat (no curvature), open (negative curvature) or closed (positive curvature) Connectivity, how the universe is put together, i.e simply connected space or multiply connected.   One should note that any combination of these can occur, that is, a flat universe can be finite or infinite, or any combination.  The exact shape is still a matter of debate in physical cosmology, however, experimental data from various, independent sources (WMAP, BOOMERanG and Planck for example) confirm that the universe is flat with only a 0.4% margin of error.    Theorists have been trying to construct a formal mathematical model of the shape of the universe. In formal terms, this is a 3-manifold model corresponding to the spatial section (in comoving coordinates) of the 4-dimensional space-time of the universe. The model most theorists currently use is the so-called Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) model. Arguments have been put forward that the observational data best fit with the conclusion that the shape of the universe is infinite and flat,  but the data are also consistent with other possible shapes, such as the so-called Poincaré dodecahedral space   and the Picard horn.

EVEX,39k211,HorizontalBrick,10,Fri Jun 12 12:08:32 2015 UTC,"The horn is infinite in length, which means calculating things like the surface area or the volume is a tricky task. How do we calculate the volume of an infinite object? Well...  Think about the infinite sum 1+1/2+1/4+1/8+1/16+..... the sum approaches the number 2, it gets closer and closer but will not reach it. We can say 1+1/2+1/4+1/8+1/6....=2. Infinite sums can yield a finite result.  The volume of the horn, if we break it down to smaller sections, is the sum of each section's volume- which is something like(but not exactly) 1+1/4+1/9+1/16...... And like the sum before, it approaches a specific value. So the volume is finite.  The surface area however, can be broken to smaller sections in a such a way that if we sum each section's area we get something like(but not exactly) 1+1/2+1/3+1/4+1/5.... This sum doesn't converge. It doesn't approach anything, so it's basically infinity.  Is this weird? Yes. Not intuitive? Yes. But it's mathematically true."

EVEX,39k06f,winter_mutant,2,Fri Jun 12 07:04:12 2015 UTC,The male gender does not benefit a lot by running amok. It's more clever for a male not to impregnate females and run but to stay with the ones he impregnated to ensure his offspring reaches at least the age of fertility and is not killed and eaten by one of his successors in the meantime. It's also clever not to randomly impregnate females but to impregnate only healthy ones and only as many as he can feed during their pregnancy and the time they are breast feeding.
EVEX,39k06f,Bonig,2,Fri Jun 12 08:53:57 2015 UTC,meh whats better is to have a group that you impregnate and care for then just impregnate any extras other then that group when you find them and leave them to survive on their own because if they do successfully give birth its still one more of yours and 1 less of any competitors

Most redditors will consider this a ""trolls gonna troll"" situation and sit it out.   People forget that as a public company, Reddit has investors. Much of their lack of interference before will probably be due to a fear of sparking another g""reat migration"".

Besides, as stated, replying to own comments won't count. This way, I thought spam wouldn't be a big problem. Do I make sense right now?  Edit: no. I didn't get your point. The thing is, if a point ends a phrase, it counts as complete. So comments below that will be ignored (including its score, naturally).

EVEX,39a9lv,goocy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:58:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, this particular constellation of methods has been improved slightly in the last few years with the advent of Bayesian statistics. With the recent developments in machine learning, there may be even much better algorithms for coupling neuronal activity to visual concepts. Also, there may be a couple of new fMRI sequences I don't know about (but nothing groundbreaking).  The biggest problem with this paradigm is that it relies on a cheap trick: the primary visual cortex is the only large region in the brain with an extremely well known layout. If you want to examine anything else, you need to start mapping neuron groups to meaning first, and this is an incredibly long (in the region of months and years) and error-prone process. So, while somewhat impressive (I'm not that convinced by the quality of the output), this paradigm can't really be used for anything else than exactly this."
EVEX,39a9lv,rathat,5,Thu Jun 11 14:38:12 2015 UTC,"This works by recording what brain activity looks like in a person for a each image they show.

EVEX,393dgu,wilkben,3,Mon Jun 8 23:35:31 2015 UTC,"It’s been said that we know more about the surface of the moon than we do about the bottom of our oceans. But when you scale the universe down to the size of the earth, going to the moon is more like walking into the next room. What people don’t understand is the vast emptiness that the universe is. And even though the universe is more than 99.999% empty space, its staggering size allows it to contain more galaxies, stars and planets than anyone can comprehend.    The amazing thing about the universe is how little anyone understands. We know that gravity is a force of attraction between two objects with mass, but nobody understands why this happens. We know that black holes exert large gravitational forces upon surrounding matter, but no one understands what happens in the center of one. We know astronomical objects should have less mass than their gravitational forces show, but nobody knows what this dark matter causing discrepancies really is.   One of the most practical applications of space exploration is the technology that comes from it. MRI, GPS, satellite communications, cell phone cameras... None of these technologies would exist without the advancements made through space exploration."

EVEX,390v5u,wobatt,2,Mon Jun 8 12:54:14 2015 UTC,"My first thoughts: The approval voting order for your parallel vote are in a completely different order to the actual results on approval voting. I'm not sure what to conclude from this, but maybe it is from the small sample size.  I think I generally prefer the STV option. I like ranking the rules in order of best to worst, and the results seem to be in an order I like for all 3 weeks :)  I've just been reading more about STV on wikipedia, and TIL that where a transferable vote is used to elect a single winner (rather than proportional representation) it is usually called Instant-Runoff Voting (IRV)."
EVEX,390v5u,wobatt,2,Tue Jun 9 12:23:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we had a way too small sample this week. That trend was already pretty clear last week, but I'd hoped that 'final' would inspire some votes. Obviously, it didn't work all that well. Interestingly though, FPTP and ""Extremes – Total"" are pretty close to the official results.  And I know IRV, but most people around here use STV, so I chose that one, it is a generalization of IRV after all.    TBH, I'M A BIT SURPRISED THAT YOU LIKE STV. IN OUR EARLY DEBATES, YOU WERE A BIG PROPONENT OF SIMPLICITY, BUT STV CLEARLY REQUIRES THE MOST THOUGHT, BOTH IN WHAT THE ORDER SHOULD BE, AND IN HOW TO INPUT THAT ORDER. WITH A DEDICATED VOTING APP, WE HOPEFULLY WOULDN'T HAVE THE PROBLEM OF INVALID VOTES (WHICH, FOR THE FIRST TWO VOTES WERE ~20%), BUT UNLESS KUILIN WANTS TO GO AHEAD AND CODE A BEAUTIFUL, FOOLPROOF DRAG-AND-DROP GUI, I DON'T SEE A SCENARIO WHERE THERE'S NO PEOPLE GETTING IRRITATED BY THE PROCESS.   FURTHERMORE, YOU CAN'T USE YOUR OWN PREFERENCE TO JUDGE WHICH METHOD GIVES THE MOST FAIR OUTCOME FOR THE COMMUNITY, ELSE IT WOULD BE JUST AS FAIR TO JUST LET YOU RANK ALL THE OPTIONS AND THAT WOULD BE THE OFFICIAL RESULT. FOR EXAMPLE, LAST WEEK I WANTED TO SEE NIC CAGE ON THE LAST PLACE, SO WE CLEARLY DISAGREE THERE. TO JUDGE THE METHODS THEMSELFES, WE MUST DISCONNECT THE RESULTS FROM THE CONTENTS AND ONLY JUDGE BASED ON WHAT VOTES THEY GOT. ONCE AGAIN, STV IS THE ONLY METHOD WHERE I CAN'T EASILY TELL HOW THE RESULTS COMPARE TO THE VOTES JUST BY LOOKING."

IN OUR EARLY DEBATES, YOU WERE A BIG PROPONENT OF SIMPLICITY, BUT STV CLEARLY REQUIRES THE MOST THOUGHT   I'M IN FAVOUR OF METHODS THAT ARE CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD. THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF STV IS NOT TOO DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND, AND THERE ARE LOTS OF ARTICLES EXPLAINING IT ONLINE, SOME WITH EASY WORKED EXAMPLES.   UNLESS KUILIN WANTS TO GO AHEAD AND CODE A BEAUTIFUL, FOOLPROOF DRAG-AND-DROP GUI, I DON'T SEE A SCENARIO WHERE THERE'S NO PEOPLE GETTING IRRITATED BY THE PROCESS   THERE ARE WAYS OF MAKING IT SIMPLE. There's a few designs that could work:   Drop down lists, where after you select one it is removed from subsequent lists.

EVEX,38onlt,Tobl4,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:08:27 2015 UTC,"In theory:  I believe using the Other Discussions tab as a definition for reposts is simple, but isn't necessarily the best way of defining a repost.  When people complain about reposts, it's because they've seen the content before. Therefore, rehosting something so that it doesn't appear in Other Discussions would still constitute a repost in the minds of viewers, regardless of the official definition of a repost.  Therefore, I believe reposts in the general context of reddit should be defined as content that is virtually identical to previously submitted content (without regard to how it's hosted).  In practice:  I believe using the Other Discussions tab as a definition for reposts isn't necessarily the best way of defining a repost, but is simple. Using another definition risks making the mods' job more difficult than I think it should be.  I believe Evex doesn't yet have a major problem with reposts (even if, stereotypically, reddit as a whole regularly complains about reposts), so I understand the rules for limiting reposts as somthing preemptive. I generally don't take preemptive rules very seriously, and let me be clear: this belief is the linchpin of my entire argument and represents a significant bias.  Therefore, I believe reposts in the context of Evex's rules should be defined as stuff in the Other Discussions tab."
EVEX,38onlt,Forthwrong,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:41:40 2015 UTC,"Many rules on this subreddit rely on the report function because the moderators cannot read and evaluate every single comment.   Reposts could simply be checked via ""other discussions"" and if someone notices a case where another link was used, they could report it and point to where the earlier post can be found. (""rule 20: www.reddit.com/r/EVEX/comments/38k1c7/""). It may not catch all that use a different link, but at least it gets some of them.  Btw: do the mods even check everything for ""other discussions""? There's a German saying that's basically ""If there's no accuser, there's no judge."""
EVEX,38onlt,Calvin_,2,Fri Jun 5 18:01:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, we check all the links for ""Other Discussions"". I have a pet  /u/kuilinbot that alerts me whenever there's a new post here (amongst many other things it does)."
EVEX,38onlt,Calvin_,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:40:26 2015 UTC,"I think that self-posts are too hard to monitor. I'm all for banning posts that say ""/r/EVEX is Calvinball"" but I doubt they phrasing/body of those posts will be identical often. Beside that, those posts are labeled on this sub as ""Discussion,"" so if someone wanted to have another discussion on the same topic I don't think we should ban/remove those ""re-""posts.  I think that links to the same content should be banned–so a two links to two different copies of a Rick Astley's ""Never Gonna Give You Up"" would result in the later one being removed. I suppose the exactness of this interpretation would rely somewhat on the mods' discretion (if the video is 4 seconds longer, but is essentially the same video, I would consider that to be a repost).  This can lead to other problems: What about clips of other content? Example: If I posted the full vimeo link to Shia LaBeouf's ""Introductions"" video, does that mean people can't link to the more popular ""just do it"" inspirational clip?  The easiest solution is to say that only the exact same link constitutes a repost (that's probably how reposts are most generally defined)."

This will keep Evex from becoming one of the many holes where ""facts"" are repeated ad infinitum without anyone ever bothering to check if they're true.

EVEX,389cp0,Calvin_,11,Tue Jun 2 19:14:20 2015 UTC,"Here is a comment with a discussion between myself and /u/Tobl4..  Overall, it seems like an ""abstain"" vote where a user clicks vote but does not click an option seems like it will only negatively affect results- in other words, a vote for anything but ""yes"" is effectively a ""no.""  I personally think that people who choose to abstain (instead of accidentally clicking vote without voting) might have a reason to do so- to be counted in the total numbers but show no preference for or against a referendum. I think we should have an abstain voting button to make this process clearer for people who want to abstain. I do not think we should allow for abstentions without an abstain button, that's too confusing and if we want abstaining as an option it should be a clear and easy option.  Also, I am aware of the fact that in order to truly ""abstain"" from a vote, a user would simply not vote. This type of voting, refusing to give a ""yes"" or ""no,"" seems to be something different with different intentions than advocates for truly not voting (or abstaining). It seems to be a ""neutral"" option, something entirely different. It's been built into the system for all of the votes, but it hasn't been intuitive (we could have had users click the vote button for rules without voting, but that didn't matter because we didn't/don't need a total percentage)."
EVEX,389cp0,Tobl4,6,Tue Jun 2 19:49:19 2015 UTC,"I think we actually agree now, but I want to make one thing clear for those that don't want to read our entire debate over there:  Adding an ""Abstain"" or ""Neutral"" option is not a cosmetic choice. In order for Abstain to count, but not count as a No, we need a completely different voting system. Options 1 and 3 will result in Abstains being counted as Nos.  I think we should use option 4 (preferably) or option 2 (not as good). Then, if we want to consider Neutral or Abstain options, someone would need to propose a new voting system via referendum. That referendum needs to include not only that there should be a third option, but also how exactly those votes should be counted."
EVEX,389cp0,Calvin_,3,Tue Jun 2 20:14:26 2015 UTC,"Adding an ""Abstain"" or ""Neutral"" option is not a cosmetic choice. In order for Abstain to count, but not count as a No, we need a completely different voting system. Options 1 and 3 will result in Abstains being counted as Nos.   We totally do agree.. but I think that the 3rd option is a good solution. It allows for people to choose abstain. Yes, that option would effectively serves as a ""no"" for the purposes of passing or failing a referendum. As you say, to count these votes as their own type of vote, we would have to re-do how we count votes for referendums. But having an ""abstain"" button seems to me like it would allow people to make their preferences known, even if it results in no effective change.  So I'm advocating for 3 or 4, with a strong preference for 3 (and I prefer 2 over 1). We shouldn't have the ambiguity that we have now."
EVEX,389cp0,Tobl4,3,Tue Jun 2 21:11:11 2015 UTC,"THEN WE DON'T AGREE. OPTION THREE REMOVES THE AMBIGUITY OF OPTION 1, BUT IT DOES SO BY ADDING FALSE INFORMATION. NO ONE WILL LOOK AT ""ABSTAIN"" AND THINK ""THIS WILL COUNT AGAINST THE REFERENDUM. HAVING TWO CHOICES THAT DO THE SAME, BUT ONE OF THEM IS LABELED ""NO"" AND THE OTHER IS LABELED ""ABSTAIN"", IS HIGHLY MISLEADING."
EVEX,389cp0,Calvin_,3,Tue Jun 2 21:22:30 2015 UTC,"I AGREE STILL, BUT I GUESS I'M ALSO ADVOCATING FOR MAKING THE ABSTAIN FUNCTION COUNT BY COUNTING VOTES DIFFERENTLY. WHICH I UNDERSTAND CAN'T REALLY BE DONE WITH A VOTE CLARIFICATION. SO I MAY END UP VOTING FOR OPTION 4 DEPENDING ON HOW FURTHER DISCUSSION GOES HERE AND WHETHER /u/wobatt MAKES A REFERENDUM PROPOSING THAT PARTICULAR VOTING SYSTEM."
EVEX,389cp0,wobatt,3,Tue Jun 2 21:59:14 2015 UTC,HAVING AN OPTION FOR ABSTAINING MUST NOT BE THE SAME AS VOTING NO. THAT WOULD BE DECEIVING THE VOTER.

EVEX,389cp0,Forthwrong,2,Wed Jun 3 04:11:05 2015 UTC,"Are you going to let people abstain on the clarification vote for the sake of neutrality? ^^  Edit: I meant the above as a joke, but I think that it naturally leads to the question of whether the vote will only allow one option or if it'll allow more, as people might be equally okay with more than one option."
EVEX,389cp0,skunkhunk,3,Tue Jun 2 19:40:03 2015 UTC,"a minute ago, hivemind!"
EVEX,389cp0,wobatt,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:41:47 2015 UTC,"Option 3.  To count abstentions as different to No votes I think we will need to use a different formula. With only allowing for yes and no votes, the current requirement of a 2/3 majority could be written as follows without changing the results:  Yes - No >= Total / 3  This formula also works if you include abstentions. Effectively you count votes as:   Yes = 1 Abstain = 0 No = -1   To pass, the total of the vote scores must be greater than 1/3 of the number of votes cast."
EVEX,389cp0,Tobl4,5,Tue Jun 2 20:30:35 2015 UTC,"WHILE THAT COULD BE AN INTERESTING SYSTEM, I DON'T THINK IT'S THE SAME AS WHAT WE HAVE (+ABSTAINS) OR THAT WE COULD OR SHOULD ADAPT IT WITHOUT A REFERENDUM."
EVEX,389cp0,Calvin_,3,Tue Jun 2 20:49:51 2015 UTC,I mean there isn't a process for these clarification votes either so...
EVEX,389cp0,wobatt,2,Tue Jun 2 21:06:13 2015 UTC,I agree totally. I just don't see any other way of having an abstention option that isn't the same as voting No.
EVEX,389cp0,wobatt,2,Tue Jun 2 21:27:39 2015 UTC,I DON'T THINK IT'S THE SAME AS WHAT WE HAVE    ALGEBRA!  Current system:  Y / ( Y + N ) >= 2 / 3           Multiply by 3 3 Y / ( Y + N ) >= 2             Multiply by ( Y + N ) 3 Y >= 2 ( Y + N )               Expand the brackets 3 Y >= 2 Y + 2 N                 Subtract 2 Y Y >= 2 N   My formula:  Y - N >= ( Y + N ) / 3           Multiply by 3 3 ( Y - N ) >= Y + N             Expand the brackets 3 Y - 3 N >= Y + N               Add 3 N 3 Y >= Y + 4 N                   Subtract Y 2 Y >= 4 N                       Divide by 2 Y >= 2 N   You can see that they both simplify to the same thing.
EVEX,389cp0,Tobl4,2,Tue Jun 2 22:44:53 2015 UTC,"THAT IS ONLY TRUE FOR A = 0. YOUR FORMULA ISN'T   { Y - N >= ( Y + N ) / 3 }   IT'S  { Y - N >= ( Y + N + A ) / 3 }     LET'S ASSUME A VOTE 8 YES, 4 NO, 3 ABSTAINS (I.E. NEVER HIT THE VOTE-BUTTON)  { Y / ( Y + N ) >= 2 / 3 } { 8 / ( 8 + 4 ) >= 2 / 3 }    REFERENDUM PASSES   IF THOSE ALL (OR EVEN JUST ONE) CHOOSE TO VOTE ABSTAIN UNDER YOUR SYSTEM  { Y - N >= ( Y + N + A ) / 3 } { 8 - 4 >= ( 8 + 4 + 3 ) / 3 } { 4 >= 5 }    !FALSE    REFERENDUM FAILS     SECOND EXAMPLE: THOSE THAT DIDN'T VOTE STILL DON'T VOTE AT ALL, BUT THIS TIME 1/4TH OF VOTERS DIDN'T FEEL PARTICULARLY STRONG ABOUT THE REFERENDUMS AND CHOOSE TO ABSTAIN INSTEAD. THAT IS TRUE EQUALLY FOR YES- AND NO-VOTES.  CURRENT SYSTEM (THEY WILL BE IGNORED, SINCE THEY DIDN'T CHOOSE ANYTHING):  { Y / ( Y + N ) >= 2 / 3 } { 6 / ( 6 + 3 ) >= 2 / 3 }    REFERENDUM PASSES   YOUR SYSTEM (NOTE THAT THE THREE ABSTAINS ARE DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAN BEFORE):  { Y - N >= ( Y + N + A ) / 3 } { 6 - 3 >= ( 6 + 3 + 3 ) / 3 } { 3 >= 4 }    !FALSE    REFERENDUM FAILS     I'M NOT SAYING YOUR SYSTEM IS BAD, BUT IT WILL MAKE IT HARDER TO PASS REFERENDUMS AND IT'S NOT THE SAME AS WHAT WE HAVE EXCEPT FOR WHEN NO ONE ABSTAINS, IN WHICH CASE, WHY EVEN BOTHER?"
EVEX,389cp0,wobatt,2,Tue Jun 2 23:19:47 2015 UTC,"EXCEPT THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM INCLUDES ABSTAINING PEOPLE IN THE TOTAL, AND MAKES THEM EQUIVALENT TO A NO VOTE.  Y / ( Y + N + A ) >= 2 / 3   Suppose 40 people vote. 25 Yes, 5 No, 10 Abstain.  Y / ( Y + N + A ) >= 2 / 3 25 / ( 25 + 5 + 10 ) >= 2 / 3 0.625 >= 0.6666...          FALSE - Fails   My formula:  Y - N >= ( Y + N + A ) / 3 25 - 5 >= ( 25 + 5 + 10 ) / 3 20 >= 13.3333...            TRUE - Passes   SO IT MAKES REFERENDUMS EASIER TO PASS."
EVEX,389cp0,Tobl4,2,Wed Jun 3 12:22:57 2015 UTC,"BOSSMAN AND KUILIN ALREADY SAID THAT WAS DUE TO A CODING ERROR, NOT BECAUSE IT WAS THE INTENDED METHOD FOR VOTING. ONLY IF THIS DISCUSSION CONCLUDES THAT WE SHOULD ALLOW ABSTAINS BUT COUNT THEM AS NOS (WHICH DOESN'T SEEM LIKELY FROM THE COMMENTS HERE), THEN YOUR METHOD WOULD BE EASIER.   SECONDLY: BY SAYING THAT IT IS EASIER TO PASS UNDER YOUR SYSTEM, YOU ALSO SAY THAT IT'S NOT THE SAME AS THE CURRENT ONE, ONLY FURTHERING MY POINT THAT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOUR SYSTEM IS GOOD (I REALLY DON'T DISLIKE IT), IT NEEDS A REFERENDUM."

I can't play the Unite generation (gen 2) since I started in Tri. Monster hitboxes before Tri are complete garbage. I don't have my second super charge as great sword (each gen adds new moves to all weapons, and they're always useful). I don't have my right stick for camera (this is more of a hardware issue, though, going from 3DS to PSP). I don't have camera focus. Menial items are much much more of a pain to get. It all just adds up to an overall worse experience. Unite was great, and I have no problems with it on its own, but it's a testament to Tri that I can't go back to it.  Also, I can't go back to Tri now since 4 is out. I main Insecet Glaive, which isn't in Tri. Great sword has even more moves now. Swimming is terrible compared to climbing. There is no mounting, either, and on top of all of that, the game is faster and more fluid in 4. Again, I don't hate Tri for what it is at all. It was great. 4 is just so much better."

I think that many game franchises improve with each release, in spite of people claiming that the previous game did everything better because they are influenced by nostalgia. I tried to play through Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time because so many people love it, but since I never played it as a kid there was no nostalgia for me to feel and the control scheme seemed too clunky. This does not mean that I dislike all old games, though. I often play old games that are still solid by today's gameplay standards, such as Quake 3 or the original Half-Life.

I think your stats should reflect that and label, for example ""Repeal Referendum 10 - Yes"" as 66.67%. After all, the one vote that didn't choose yes or no is essentially spoilt.    Also, I don't really understand why you listed the results for the rule-vote. I make absolutely sure not to say anything about the parallel poll's results before the official vote closes so that I don't influence the outcome, but I'm pretty sure we'll see tactical voting now."
EVEX,381vv9,Tobl4,6,Mon Jun 1 10:21:21 2015 UTC,"Also, I don't really understand why you listed the results for the rule-vote.    I was just trying to be transparent. I honestly didn't think about it influencing anything, but I definitely see your point.   Your percentage says it's 66.34%, which is less than 2/3rds.    This is something we'll look into before the next referendum vote. We definitely want to make sure votes are accurate. This may be a miscalculation in the voting app."
EVEX,381vv9,Calvin_,7,Mon Jun 1 13:20:19 2015 UTC,This may be a miscalculation in the voting app.   It includes the vote that chose neither yes nor no in the denominator.
EVEX,381vv9,DINDU___NUFFIN,2,Mon Jun 1 13:52:01 2015 UTC,Seems to be the case. Those shouldn't count as votes for said referendum.
EVEX,381vv9,Tobl4,4,Mon Jun 1 13:53:31 2015 UTC,"Yea, 134/202=66.34% but I'll change the denominator on radios not to include no-option voters."
EVEX,381vv9,Calvin_,2,Mon Jun 1 13:54:55 2015 UTC,"Abstentions should certainly count for the total... am I misinterpreting what's been said? I choose not to vote sometimes. It's an option in and of itself, to not include those voters in the total number (denominator of that ratio) seems like it won't represent all voters."

EVEX,381vv9,Never_Peel_a_Lemon,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:52:51 2015 UTC,"I guess this is what the author said in the comments:     No it's a 50 up vote to go to vote as normal however rather then a 50% approval to pass I propose we have a 2/3 majority of people who voted pass.   But I thought that I was ""voting"" by abstaining."
EVEX,381vv9,Calvin_,3,Mon Jun 1 23:46:26 2015 UTC,Well what would you be voting for though? When one abstains they are removing themselves they are saying that they want no part in the decision. What outcome would you be looking for by abstaining?
EVEX,381vv9,Tobl4,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:23:09 2015 UTC,"I suppose it's like a ""soft no."" So the point would be to influence to total and make it harder to pass the referendum, but not actually indicate opposition to the referendum. I outlined my opinion more clearly here, but essentially I agree: if someone wants to ""abstain"" they should not click the vote button. If they click the vote button without choosing ""yes"" or ""no,"" it seems to me like the did vote, and that vote should be counted toward the total.  My guess is this debate will influence close to 0 total referendum outcomes, as this scenario is fairly rare (we could have run into this problem in the past with a 50% threshold and never did, as far as I know)."
EVEX,381vv9,Calvin_,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:31:32 2015 UTC,The truth is while I get where you're coming from I think you should have to take a stand if you want to be counted. If you just click the vote button but put in no information you should be discarded you  did nothing and have said it doesn't matter. Many people click the vote buttons just because some click accidentally. If you don't pick an option it means you don't feel strongly which means you shouldn't get to influence it.
EVEX,381vv9,Tobl4,3,Tue Jun 2 22:39:49 2015 UTC,"After all, the one vote that didn't choose yes or no is essentially spoilt.   Why shouldn't abstentions count in the total? Sometimes I choose not to vote on a specific referendum. A lack of voting isn't less of a choice than yes or no..?"
EVEX,381vv9,Calvin_,5,Mon Jun 1 22:20:21 2015 UTC,"LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT ABSTAIN MEANS: IT MEANS ""I DON'T WANT TO INFLUENCE THIS RESULT POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY."". IF YOU DID, YOU'D HAVE CHOSEN EITHER YES OR NO.   IF WE INCLUDE ABSTAINED VOTES (THOUGH ONLY THE ONES THAT VOTED WITHOUT PICKING, NOT THE ONES THAT DIDN'T VOTE AT ALL), THEY WOULD HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME EFFECT AS NO-VOTES, THE THRESHOLD BEING   {Y / Y+(A+N) >= 2/3}    SO IF WE INCLUDED SPOILT BALLOTS IN THE TOTAL, AN ABSTAINED VOTE WOULD INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME NEGATIVELY. NOT COUNTING THEM DOESN'T INFLUENCE THE RESULT EITHER WAY AND IS TRUE TO THE VOTER'S INTENTION.  THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT A SIMPLE YES/NO-VOTE IS ESSENTIALLY A TWO-PARTY FPTP. THERE IS NO THIRD OPTION CALLED ""ABSTAIN"", THE ONLY WAY THIS VOTING MECHANISM CAN HANDLE THAT IS BY IGNORING THEM AS SPOILT. AND SINCE THAT'S EXACTLY THE SAME AS IF THE PERSON ACTUALLY HAD ABSTAINED (YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRESS ALL THE 'VOTE'-BUTTONS) I'D SAY IT'S A PRETTY GOOD APPROXIMATION."
EVEX,381vv9,Forthwrong,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:52:25 2015 UTC,"OKAY, I AGREE WITH YOU ALMOST COMPLETELY. I SEE HOW IF I HIT THE VOTE BUTTON AND DON'T ACTUALLY CHOOSE YES OR NO, IT HAS THE SAME RESULT AS CLICKING NO. I ALSO SEE HOW IT IS PROBLEMATIC TO COUNT THESE VOTES, AS IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE SENSE WITH A VOTERS INTENTION. HOWEVER, I STILL THINK THAT IN THAT SCENARIO I 'VOTED.'    NOT COUNTING THEM DOESN'T INFLUENCE THE RESULT EITHER WAY AND IS TRUE TO THE VOTER'S INTENTION.   I AGREE WITH THE FIRST 1/2 OF THIS SENTENCE... THE SECOND THOUGH DOESN'T SEEM TOTALLY ACCURATE. IF THE POINT OF AN ABSTENTION WAS TO NOT INFLUENCE THE DECISION AT ALL, WHY CLICK THE VOTE BUTTON? AS YOU POINT OUT, NOT CLICKING IT IS A PURER WAY OF MAKING SURE THAT YOU DON'T INFLUENCE THE VOTING PROCESS. I THINK THAT CLICKING 'VOTE' WITHOUT CLICKING A 'NO' OPTION IS A WAY OF SAYING THAT THE PERSON IS OKAY IF THE REFERENDUM PASSES BUT DOES NOT HAVE A STRONG OPINION EITHER WAY (OR THE OPPOSITE, WOULD BE OKAY IF IT FAILED, BUT DOESN'T MIND IT PASSING).   LOOKING UP THE WIKI DEFINITION OF ABSTENTION (WHICH INCLUDES THE LANGUAGE ON SPOILT VOTES), I THINK THAT 'ABSTENTION' MAY BE THE WRONG WORD–AS YOU POINT OUT A TRUE ABSTENTION WOULD BE NOT VOTING AT ALL.  MY MAIN POINT, I SUPPOSE, IS THAT IF I CLICK THE 'VOTE' BUTTON I VOTED, RIGHT? SO THAT SHOULD BE PART OF THE TOTAL PERCENTAGE.  Honestly this issue isn't a big deal to me.... I don't remember a time where I really wanted to exercise this power. And, if we end up not including abstentions in the total we (voters) can easily just adjust voting to match it (I would probably vote ""no"" whenever I would have previously voted ""blank""). Interesting that this could have been a potential problem for referendums for all of EVEX, but we didn't notice it until it got to 66% to pass (we never had a 49% that would have been over 50% if we excluded an abstention [or whatever the correct term might be]).  Good debating you again."
EVEX,381vv9,Calvin_,2,Tue Jun 2 15:27:25 2015 UTC,"I think what you really want is a way to vote 'Neutral' and I can absolutely understand that desire, but without switching voting systems, that's just not doable."
EVEX,381vv9,Forthwrong,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:14:03 2015 UTC,"Well, it seems like it is built into the current system as clicking the vote button without choosing yes or no. But I agree, that's essentially what I'm advocating for!"
EVEX,381vv9,Tobl4,3,Tue Jun 2 17:02:58 2015 UTC,"Don't you reckon that hardly constitutes being built into the system when it's not as prominent as the other choices? The simplest explanation seems to me to be that voting without choosing y/n is an accident rather than intentional.  When referendums were introduced, I thought to myself about whether an option to abstain should be included, but I concluded that an option to abstain would be against the spirit of a referendum. Real-life referendums seldom have an ""abstain"" option because the purpose of a referendum is cloture; the purpose is an answer. I don't think it's within the scope of a referendum to gauge how many people care enough to vote ""I don't care"" in the referendum."
EVEX,381vv9,Devonmartino,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:02:10 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify for voters, maybe we can make it so that we cannot submit a vote without choosing an option for the referendums? Paging /u/kuilin  ninja: Also, yes I do agree."
EVEX,381vv9,g0_west,3,Tue Jun 2 18:05:29 2015 UTC,"That is possible, but I think the option of abstaining should still be there."
EVEX,381vv9,Forthwrong,3,Tue Jun 2 18:23:24 2015 UTC,"Even if it's not going to count?  BUT PUTTING ASIDE WHETHER ABSTAINING SHOULD BE AN OPTION, IF ABSTAINING WILL BE AN OPTION, I THINK IT SHOULD INDEED BE AN UNAMBIGUOUS OPTION THAT'S VOTED FOR IN THE SAME WAY THAT OTHER OPTIONS ARE VOTED FOR.  IT SEEMS ODDLY UNEQUAL THAT THE WAY TO ABSTAIN IS TO CLICK VOTE WITHOUT CHOOSING ANYTHING; I HAD NEVER CONSIDERED THAT AN OPTION BEFORE READING YOUR ANSWER TO WHY THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF VOTERS AND THE SUM OF THE YESES AND NOES, AND I'M SURE PLENTY OF OTHERS HADN'T THOUGHT OF IT AS AN OPTION EITHER."
EVEX,381vv9,Tobl4,4,Tue Jun 2 18:59:16 2015 UTC,So how does the community feel about the revote voting length? I went over two options in thread text above. Would love to hear your feedback whether we should just have this go until Wednesday when the new suggestion thread goes up or if we should forego a new vote this week to allow the revote to have more time since a lot of people might miss the revote and not have their voice heard if it ends Wednesday.
EVEX,381vv9,Forthwrong,6,Mon Jun 1 14:03:36 2015 UTC,"I've already said in the earlier discussion thread that I would have preferred for the new vote to have started as soon as the vulnerability was fixed for a longer timeframe.   But now that it's already Monday, I still think we should close the poll on Wednesday. This sort of thing shouldn't affect two votes. I hope that enough people that 'only come fridays to vote' at least come along the next week to see the results, in which I case they will read this announcement."

I THINK THAT THIS COULD CAUSE SOME ISSUES SUCH AS A LACK OF REFERENDUMS (NOT THAT WE NEED REFERENDUMS EVERY WEEK BUT A LACK CAN'T HELP).   ADDITIONALLY, THIS WOULD CAUSE A LOT MORE REFERENDUMS TO BE HELD FROM PASSAGE. BASED ON WEEK 17, SOMEONE WOULD NEED 67 UPVOTES. 50 SEEMS TO BE A GOOD NUMBER IN MY OPINION AND MANY REFERENDUMS WHICH WERE ACCEPTED IN THE PAST DID NOT MEET THE LIMIT THAT WOULD BE IN PLACE, AND WOULD NOT HAVE PASSED IF IT HAD BEEN IN PLACE SINCE THE BEGINNING."
EVEX,382gvt,ArcticZeroo,3,Tue Jun 2 00:18:17 2015 UTC,"LOW VOTE-PARTICIPATION WOULD LIKELY HAPPEN IN WEEKS OF LOW OVERALL PARTICIPATION, SO WHILE THE THRESHOLD FOR GETTING ON THE BALLOT WOULD BE SMALLER, SO WOULD BE THE POOL OF POTENTIAL UPVOTES.  AS FOR YOUR SECOND POINT, I'M THE ONE THAT SUGGESTED TO FORTHWRONG TO INCREASE THE THRESHOLD FROM 0.2 TO 0.25. THAT IS TO COUNTERACT THE SWITCH FROM KARMA TO UPVOTES. THAT SWITCH WASN'T DONE TO MAKE REFERENDUMS EASIER, BUT BECAUSE OF RULE-DISCREPANCIES. NATURALLY, THRESHOLDS SHOULD ADJUST TO REFLECT THAT. AND EVEN WITH 0.25, WEEK 17 IS AN EXAMPLE AT THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE. IT'S THE LAST ONE IN THE CHART (UPDATED THAT, BUT REFERENDUM COUNTS STILL REPRESENT KARMA, NOT UPVOTES), BUT THE TWO WEEKS PRIOR TO THAT ONLY REQUIRED ~34 UPVOTES. BASED ON WEEKS 19 AND 20 (GOING BY HIGHEST REFERENDUM-COUNT HERE) GIVES 52.75 / 53.25, SO A QUARTER OF VOTERS IS ABSOLUTELY DOABLE AND RIGHT NOW ACTUALLY CLOSER TO THE STATUS QUO THAN A FIFTH."

EVEX,381gg4,briizo,2,Thu Jun 4 23:50:15 2015 UTC,Ok cool. I like that referendum so thanks. I'm glad you've served well. If your term only last till august Then the referendum seems a little pointless

The United States of America is a major world power, with billions of dollars and millions of lives and livelihoods riding on every social, political, and economic decision made. This is a subreddit, a subsection of a large Internet community. Lives are generally not hanging in the balance. Granted, the Rule 21 referendum will affect the fate of the entire human race, but I'd chalk that up to a six-dimensional hiccup.  Point is, the analogy does not work. Apples and oranges."

EVEX,37t3ya,Tobl4,8,Sat May 30 07:00:51 2015 UTC,"I'm also in favour of a revote. That is the option that gives the hacker the least influence over the vote's results. To everyone else: For that revote, it's more important than ever that we upvote that thread so that it could potentially be included on the frontpage of people that already voted and don't follow this sub closely enough to realize they have to vote again.  also, /u/kuilin: Could the attacker have manipulated the tables without changing the password → without us noticing? (without significantly more effort that is)"
EVEX,37t3ya,Tobl4,5,Sat May 30 09:32:34 2015 UTC,"Yea, the attacker could, but it's not like we wouldn't notice since it's strange if a vote option has 0 votes in total."
EVEX,37t3ya,g0_west,8,Sat May 30 17:02:51 2015 UTC,"I think it would be easy to keep us from noticing if they left some votes for the options they disliked.   I think it's reassuring that they didn't, maybe we can consider this maybe not white-, but at least greyhat. The alternatives are that they're complete noobs that got lucky (unlikely imo) or that it's a distraction from a finer manipulation for example on the outcome of the referendums (again unlikely, since they could have done that without any distraction if you say we wouldn't notice)."
EVEX,37t3ya,Tobl4,2,Sat May 30 19:20:37 2015 UTC,upvote that thread so that it could potentially be included on the frontpage of people that already voted   For this reason I suggest we just do the same vote again next weekend.
EVEX,37t3ya,Devonmartino,9,Sat May 30 23:08:43 2015 UTC,"If we don't want to mess up the schedule, another interesting option is to use /u/Tobl4's parallel vote results as the official results for this week."
EVEX,37t3ya,TenebrousEye,6,Sat May 30 17:09:09 2015 UTC,"If you want to do that, there should be an official announcement pointing people the right way. However, I think it would become a problem that typeform doesn't have our account-verification since it's pretty clear that people do care enough about these votes to cheat.   I would prefer this solution (best case immediately after the problem was fixed, second best case half an hour from now):   Reset all rule-votes in the app, referendum can stay the same. Have a new official (and stickied) announcement that makes it obvious that people should vote again in the title (""This week's evex vote was hacked, please vote again (Vote announcement week 20)"" and explicitly ask for upvotes so that it show's up on the frontpage of people that don't frequent this sub specifically. Extend the timeframe for the vote to make up for the lost time. This also catches people that check the current stickied post on monday for vote results. We have a buffer between announcement and suggestion thread after all."
EVEX,37t3ya,g0_west,8,Sat May 30 19:54:47 2015 UTC,I'm in favor of a revote.   IMPORTANT: Were the referendums affected? Will the referendums have to be re-voted on?

EVEX,37t3ya,wobatt,3,Sat May 30 17:03:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we hold a revote with the same options. Putting those three into the next vote would disadvantage them and unfairly advantage the other options."

EVEX,37t3ya,A_kind_guy,3,Sat May 30 15:15:09 2015 UTC,"The people who voted only for options within the deleted options should be able to vote again, but the people who voted for options that were deleted and ones that weren't can't vote again currently since they're indistinguishable from the people that voted for only options outside the deleted set. As always though, anyone can message the mods and get their vote reset, and it looks like we'll be re-doing the entire vote anyways."
EVEX,37t3ya,Calvin_,3,Sat May 30 17:06:27 2015 UTC,"Were there any clues as to who did it?  I just can't think why someone would go to the trouble of hacking the voting app for a small subreddit.  As for what to do, we clearly need a revote, and I agree with /u/Tobl4's plan."

Really, that movie is packed with ""life lessons"", just check out this scene. Here are some more things it taught me as I watched the movie for the twentieth time:   Cognitive behavioral therapy - thinking processes have a direct impact on your life. If you're angry, use it to make good changes to the world instead of self immolating. Pissing off authority figures can sometimes be the right thing to do. Learned from April. What is family. Also, you can choose who to respect and look up to. Don't let people order you to respect them. Doing a good job won't necessary get people to appreciate you. April got fired for being such a direct and nosy reporter. I ended up going to Karate for five years. This helped me through a lot of social anxiety and confidence issues. I'm certain I stuck to it (and started in the first place) because of turtle martial arts."

EVEX,37knqe,Immrspy,1 point,Thu May 28 09:51:32 2015 UTC,"I like this voting system m ore than the original, the only problem being time. It takes about the time it would normally take to vote on the rules and referendums combined. If this WERE to be the official voting system, I think that there should be 2 of the types of voting, Original, and Ranking. The original get the count of votes, and the Ranking is a multiplier, and here how I think it should be multiplied: Take the number of votes for all the options. (there will be 3 for the sake of simplicity) 1=50 votes, 2=200 votes, and 3=150 votes. Then people rank the votes. The average for each option comes out to: 1=1.50, 2=2.50, 3=2. That mean that we multiply the votes by those numbers, and 1 has 75 votes, 2 has 500 votes, and 3 has 300 votes. This may not have changed anything here, but when there are five options, and two of them are pretty close in votes, this system will allow the outside voters to pick between 2, and 1, to unintentionally decide which will be chosen as the winner.  Sidenote 1: I like the old way of ranking votes, with the number line.  Sidenote 2: You should be allowed to pick 2 option for one number in ranking, and they tie for the lower place. This means that you are indifferent to what happens to those rules."
EVEX,37knqe,Immrspy,2,Sat May 30 15:30:35 2015 UTC,"Hi,   I like this voting system m ore than the original, the only problem being time. It takes about the time it would normally take to vote on the rules and referendums combined.   I'm glad you enjoy the parallel poll. However, this is not a single proposed voting method, but rather a collection of different ballots whose results we can use to discuss alternative methods. I doubt that any proposed method would use all of this. (btw., average time to completion is still only 2:21 mins)   If this WERE to be … [long explanation] … be chosen as the winner.   This kind of proposal is exactly what the data is for. Instead of making up examples, you can present your method and its results based on what would actually be voted for with your model. You can either do that when I post this week's results on monday after the official results are out, or you can already use last weeks results.   Sidenote 1: I like the old way of ranking votes, with the number line.   I will check which of the two methods produces fewer invalid votes (same option for several rankings) and use that in the future.   Sidenote 2: You should be allowed to pick 2 option for one number in ranking, and they tie for the lower place. This means that you are indifferent to what happens to those rules.   That would be an implementation of range-voting. We already have one such metric (though with lower resolution) with the yes/neutral/no-range3-vote. This ranking enforces a strict ranking so that we can test other methods based on its results, such as STV."

EVEX,37gynk,TheBoldMuffin,2,Thu May 28 02:01:30 2015 UTC,"""Is your skin lighter because of the chocolate?""  I think it's a little sad how these workers don't have such a basic knowledge of skin care. T'would be nice if they had the economical resources to educate themselves. Would you pay 3x the amount for chocolate to triple (or more) their wages?"
EVEX,37gynk,tablesix,2,Thu May 28 05:45:28 2015 UTC,"The crazy thing is how little it would cost to improve their wages. Numbers vary, but even generous estimates (outside of fair trade) put farmer's wages around 5% of the cost of chocolate. Tripling that (+200%) requires only ~10% increase in market price."
EVEX,37gynk,Tobl4,2,Thu May 28 13:14:20 2015 UTC,"Does that apply even to lower tier products, like Hershey's? A 10% increase in market value doesn't sound like it would ruin or even really hamper the industry, considering it's already a luxury product."
EVEX,37gynk,tablesix,1 point,Thu May 28 13:43:01 2015 UTC,"I don't have the breakdown for different manufacturer's. One could imagine that cheaper chocolate pays a bigger share of it's market price to farmers, however, I think it's just as likely that that's offset by a few other factors:   Because cheap chocolate has a bigger market share[citation needed] it can get cheaper prices buying cocoa in bulk If we assume that there are different qualities of cocoa (which the premium segment obviously insists on), manufactureres of cheaper chocolate would of course buy cheaper cocoa. They have less incentive pr-wise to pay fair wages than the premium-segment. even if that doesn't offset their lower total price, we can still assume that an industry average of 5% would be very close to their value due to their greater market share."
EVEX,37gynk,Tobl4,1 point,Thu May 28 14:33:36 2015 UTC,"Probably, if we assume that lower grade cocoa would be easier to get, which it must be, in order for there to be so much low grade chocolate candy. Cool.   Follow up: These countries could start producing their own chocolate, and selling it at normal prices, thus vastly increasing their income. (or perhaps country singular, I'm not quite sure how few cocoa producing countries there are)"

EVEX,37fvzg,TjPshine,0,Wed May 27 22:53:42 2015 UTC,"Well the Trolley problem isn't just ""utilitarians kill 1 and other people kill 5"". The problem does goes beyond the singular scenario, as the author claims it does not. This blends into the misunderstanding of utilitarianism - utilitarian is the way to opt out of any hard point. You can argue anything from a utilitarian point of view.     This author thinks the utilitarian can only kill 1.      Here is a utilitarian justification of killing 5:      I'm choosing to save the one person on the track, it shows to the rest of the population that they too would be saved even if simple reason says they should not. ""The trolley drivers are looking out for us as individuals"" they think leading to a more patriotic society. Or whoever the metaphorical trolley driver is."

If my suggestion had garnered enough votes to make it to the ballot that week, it very well may have ended up being the first rule. I definitely would have voted for it.

EVEX,37bt81,Calijor,3,Tue May 26 14:42:21 2015 UTC,"It restricts edits and relabels them as ""amendments."" If the OP decides that a suggestion should be edited in, it can be added."
EVEX,37bt81,Calijor,5,Tue May 26 14:58:27 2015 UTC,"Is this not already the case, they just aren't called amendments?"
EVEX,37bt81,Calijor,1 point,Tue May 26 15:09:48 2015 UTC,"It is, just in terms of how we've been doing things, but I'd like it to be the official process.. Nobody has objected to this process yet, but I could see how they would (""I didn't upvote that rule/referendum, it was worded differently when I voted""). Making it official will allay these potential problems.  I can see how the label of ""amendment"" is sort of confusing. Sorry. The reason that I labeled it this way is because people can always suggest a change to a referendum after it's passed by starting a new referendum (or rule or whatever). For this referendum, ""amendments"" are edits before the vote, based on user feedback. Any changes after it's put up to a vote (and passed) would need to come in the form of a new rule or rule repeal or referendum.  ninja: may have used the word 'allay' incorrectly"
EVEX,37bt81,LeinadSpoon,3,Tue May 26 15:55:08 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks for the clarification, not sure if I'm the only one who had trouble with it but you might want to edit a clarification as to exactly what it does into the post."
EVEX,37bt81,LeinadSpoon,4,Tue May 26 16:10:23 2015 UTC,"The problem I have with this vs my version of the amendment proposal is that it puts all the power in the hands of the original referendum proposer.  Whoever posts the original referendum decides which amendments become a part of it or not, rather than that being handled democratically."

EVEX,3777x8,Never_Peel_a_Lemon,30,Mon May 25 13:17:17 2015 UTC,"I think this would be a good change for EVEX. Most referendums already make around 70-80% approval, so it's not too high a threshold. The only ones that didn't pass 66% are:   Referendum 2 that would later be repealed President of Evex ""Impeach the president on the first day of office"" which didn't even get 50% and this week one of three rule-removal referendums.   So while it doesn't hinder the referendums that we like, it ensures that there aren't just two more happy people than sad. (Well, unless there's only 6 guys voting, but in that case I'd say it's a pretty good outcome)    The only other thing that I would have liked to see in this referendum is a self-imposed threshold that this only comes to pass if it reaches 66% approval. You say that only referendums that pass 2/3rds are worth being enforced, this would show that you also apply that sentiment to your own referendums, not just others'. On a more practical note, by having referendums that raise thresholds also pass their own threshold, we make it less likely that we create unbeatable requirements."

EVEX,3777x8,AerMarcus,2,Mon May 25 20:04:16 2015 UTC,"2/3 as a percentage of people that voted or of the total users here? (Currently we have it based on 50 upvotes, which you probably know.)  I am against this referendum because it solves a problem we don't have--too many referendums-- in a way I'm not a huge fan of. We should raise the number of upvotes needed (or use karma, what I voted for) to cap the number of referendums. The 2/3 majority makes it so we can pass referendums that only a few people have seen...  Which spawns another follow up question- when will the referendum be put to a vote? Is it after the 2 week period is up or once it reaches a certain number of total votes or..? If a post receives 1 down vote, no-one sees it, then two people upvote it (including the author)... that will go to a vote theoretically?  So, I want some clarity for people who might enjoy this referendum, I personally am against it regardless of your answers."
EVEX,3777x8,Forthwrong,14,Mon May 25 13:38:30 2015 UTC,"It's about referendums that have already passed the threshold of 50 upvotes. Currently, they need to get 50% approval in the weekly vote to pass, this referendum would raise that to 66.666%."

EVEX,375wf6,briizo,7,Thu May 28 00:22:57 2015 UTC,"Can we clarify the referendum with the periodic removal of rules? I think the author, /u/thejstandsfor, meant that when we have 52 rules and referendums we will repeal 26 rules or referendums. It's worded a little different,    When there are a total of 52 referendums and rules, a vote of no confidence will be held. The 26 least popular rules will be revoked. This only applies to active rules. Referendum 2, for example, would not count toward the total because it has been repealed.    This will give EVEX an occasional reset, while allowing the rules the community values to stay in place. Having too many rules would make posting difficult, and discourage new people from joining the community (no one is going to read a list of 203 rules to ensure their post is allowed).    The President has the right to veto the repeal of up to 4 rules repealed in this vote.     but that's what the intent seemed to be to me. Thoughts?"
EVEX,375wf6,Tyrstar,6,Mon May 25 04:40:31 2015 UTC,"I think that /u/jstandsfor meant ""Rules and Referendums"" where he said ""rules"" past the first time. Thus, for that, rules and referendums will be treated equally, and once there are 52 of them, then an aggregate vote will be held, removing the lower half of them."
EVEX,375wf6,storyandsong,7,Mon May 25 04:42:17 2015 UTC,The intent is definitely to repeal the bottom 50% of rules AND referendums when we hit 52.
EVEX,375wf6,Tyrstar,22,Mon May 25 04:48:35 2015 UTC,"I hate this rule and I want you to know that.  I always thought it would be cool to see how EVEX ended, where we would be when we banned all the content that there was only a niche bit of stuff allowed to be posted. Now most people will probably be done posting on the subreddit before we even reach that point. I am upset right now."
EVEX,375wf6,Forthwrong,11,Mon May 25 05:37:06 2015 UTC,This is likely one of the referendums that will be repealed via this rule when it does happen so I wouldn't worry to much about it Mr. President. Plus I think before we get to that point we can probably repeal the referendum to conserve the original intention of the sub. If I wasn't so lazy I would introduce a referendum that requires referendums to have a 2/3 win so unpopular referendums happen less frequently.

EVEX,375wf6,storyandsong,2,Tue May 26 03:14:30 2015 UTC,The real question is whether you will be in legality when you remove the rule. If the rule does not exists ther you cannot repeal rules. Only the existence of this rule allows for its demise.
EVEX,375wf6,Forthwrong,2,Tue May 26 13:06:06 2015 UTC,"I WOULD ARGUE THAT FROM THE CURRENT DIRECTION OF THE SUB, IT'S FAIRLY CLEAR THAT THERE WILL NEVER BE AN ""END"". THE MAJORITY OF RULES DON'T DEAL WITH BANNING CONTENT (IN ANY MEANINGFUL SENSE), BUT RATHER WITH ESTABLISHING A COMMON LANGUAGE FOR EVEX USERS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE AYY LMAO RULE, WHICH, IF I RECALL CORRECTLY, YOU YOURSELF SUGGESTED.  SOME RULES THAT OSTENSIBLY BAN CONTENT, E.G. THE MYTHICAL EUROPE, SERVE MOSTLY TO SET A RULE OF INSIDE JOKES FOR THE SUB. THESE WILL INEVITABLY EVENTUALLY USE APPEAL.  FOR SAKE OF ARGUMENT, LET'S CONTRAST THE INSIDE JOKES OF /B/ WITH EVEX. ON /B/, WHEN A JOKE RUNS IT'S COURSE, PEOPLE SIMPLY STOP POSTING THEM. ON EVEX, THEY ARE MANDATED BY THE RULES - EVEN AFTER MOD HAIKUS STOP BEING AMUSING (READ: AFTER THE FIRST ONE) THEY WILL STILL BE OCCURRING MONTHLY.

The current state of the art for Western-style toilets is the bidet toilet, which, as of March 2012, is installed in 72% of Japanese households.

EVEX,36npng,LeinadSpoon,6,Wed May 20 18:41:51 2015 UTC,"First off: I really like the idea.  One big problems I see with this is vote splitting between the Yes options. Even with Approval voting, I think most will only select one because they don't want the referendum to win, they want their preferred version of the referendum to win."
EVEX,36npng,Tobl4,3,Wed May 20 19:02:05 2015 UTC,"Two responses:   You may be right, but I think that those cases where that will be a problem are somewhat limited.  See here for an argument that strategic voting isn't a huge threat to approval voting. Suggestions like this are exactly why we need some form of this referendum.  We could probably fix the problem you point out by changing it so that if No gets 50% it's voted down, less than 50% then we take the top voted version.  Under the current system, we need a new referendum to incorporate simple changes suggested in the comments."
EVEX,36npng,Tobl4,3,Wed May 20 19:11:12 2015 UTC,"THE PROBLEM IS CASES WHERE ""NO"" ISN'T PERCEIVED AS A THREAT, TURNING IT ESSENTIALLY INTO A VOTE BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT ""YES"" OPTIONS WHERE APPROVING ALL ""YES""-CASES WOULD (IN THE VOTERS MIND) BE EQUIVALENT TO NOT VOTING AT ALL. That is an excellent suggestion and I would absolutely support that model."
EVEX,36npng,Tobl4,1 point,Wed May 20 19:18:17 2015 UTC,"I've edited the original thread to incorporate this and other feedback.  There seems to me to be some controversy about whether that is allowed, so if I get official word that it's not, I'll create a new referendum with the changes."
EVEX,36npng,Tobl4,5,Fri May 22 16:32:38 2015 UTC,"One more problem: I don't know if you've seen the thread, but there's currently debate on whether referendums should use upvotes for the threshold. How would that work for amendmends since we can only see total karma for comments?"
EVEX,36npng,Forthwrong,4,Wed May 20 19:35:04 2015 UTC,"Oh, that is an interesting problem.  I had missed that thread.  I'm not sure how to fix that problem at the moment..."
EVEX,36npng,Forthwrong,3,Wed May 20 19:42:51 2015 UTC,"One problem with this that I thought of, but couldn't figure out a good way to solve without making it really complicated is that there may be multiple good suggestions that people might want to incorporate both of.  The workaround for now would be an additional amendment combining the good ideas into one amendment.  If someone can come up with a way to handle the voting differently in a way that's both representative of the will of the people, allows for simpler combining of popular amendments, and isn't ridiculously complicated, then I'm all for it."
EVEX,36npng,Tobl4,5,Wed May 20 18:45:04 2015 UTC,"One solution to that problem could be to have first a big vote ""do you want that referendum, yes/no?"" and then smaller ones for the individual amendmends. However, I think that would complicate the ballot too much and create new problems where indiscrepencies between different amendmends aren't taken care of."
EVEX,36npng,Forthwrong,3,Wed May 20 19:21:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, multiple votes for one referendum worries me."
EVEX,36npng,Tobl4,2,Wed May 20 19:22:59 2015 UTC,"What if the vote for amendments were on a separate page that's linked on the main voting page, so that the main voting page would still appear simple and those who aren't interested in details could vote solely upon the content rules and referenda safely, but those interested could vote on the amendments on the separate page?"
EVEX,36npng,Forthwrong,3,Wed May 20 21:25:09 2015 UTC,"So then what would end up being authorized?  Say that we have a referendum to add referendum amendments, and someone introduces an amendment to repeal all existing rules.  People's votes on the referendum should certainly be influenced by whether that amendment passes or not.  But if it's in the same election, they won't really know what they're voting on.  And if we do the amendments first and the referendum the next week, that's just another delay factor in referendums, which already take a long time to get passed."
EVEX,36npng,Forthwrong,1 point,Wed May 20 21:42:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if we're on the same page, and I apologise in advance if the things I say here miss the point of your message, but I figure I should respond anyway in the interests of pursuing common understanding.  In my proposal, I'm saying that amendmends would be voted for alongside referendums, on a page separate but connected to the main page upon which the content rules and referenda are voted upon.  By putting amendments on a separate page, people won't see the amendments unless they look for them (by clicking the link), and if they look for them, they're probably interested enough to actually read the content of the amendments."
EVEX,36npng,wobatt,2,Wed May 20 22:22:55 2015 UTC,"Would a majority of those that vote on the amendments suffice to enact them, even if it's not the majority of total voters? If so, out of 300 people, 200 could vote Yes for the ""Referendum: this is great"". 30 of the 300 people further go to vote on the amendmends. 20 of those vote for ""Amendment: This is terrible and not to be expected when only reading the referendum"". This way, the Amendment would become law, even though only 20 out of 300 people have actually voted for it.  If otoh amendments also need a majority of the total voters, putting them on a seperate page makes it unlikely that they're even seen by 150 people."
EVEX,36npng,wobatt,1 point,Wed May 20 22:35:13 2015 UTC,"That is a good point, and indeed a flaw from the idea to keep the ballot simple.  To say my opinion, I personally think the ballot is simple enough, and listing amendments as a vote beneath the referendum (like how the referendum is beneath the content vote) would suffice, because people wouldn't then be forced to vote on amendments, just like how people can (and do) vote for the content rule without voting on the referendum.  To answer on a more practical level, I think a quorum (for lack of a better word) of votes for an amendment to pass could also suffice. What I mean by this is that, for example, if a quorum of 1/2 the referendum votes would be necessary for an amendment to pass and the referendum got 100 votes, an amendment would need >50 votes to be valid. I think you'd do a better job at determining an adequate quorum than I would.  Also, about amendments unexpectedly changing referenda, I think there should be something about amendments that limits their ability to change the referendum. After all, they're supposed to amend the referendum, not change its nature entirely. Not sure how this might be approached, though; seems like a subjective distinction."
EVEX,36npng,jammerjoint,1 point,Wed May 20 23:08:20 2015 UTC,"I need to go, so just a quick critique on the specific ""1/2 the referendum votes"": this would discourage people from voting for the referendum."
EVEX,36npng,Calvin_,2,Wed May 20 23:20:02 2015 UTC,"So, this would happen at the same vote?  So when people were voting on the referendum, they wouldn't really know what they were voting on, right?  Say there was a referendum that I didn't support in its original form, but I did if a certain amendment passed.  I could obviously vote yes on the amendment, but I would be confused about how to vote on the main referendum, since I don't know whether the amendment I want will pass or not.  Am I misunderstanding your idea?"

EVEX,36l5u5,Tobl4,7,Wed May 20 16:51:43 2015 UTC,"If I'm understanding correctly, your statement implies that a contradiction within the rules would mean that both rules must be followed, but this seems to me to contradict the ruling that ""If a contradiction arises then the newer rule trumps the older rule..  Specifically, if someone argues on Tuesdays, that would bring both of the rules into question, and, if I'm understanding the ruling correctly, the newer rule (that caps are forbidden on Tuesdays) would trump the older rule (that arguments must be all caps).  I don't think that the two ideas are necessarily mutually exclusive (that is to say, I'm not challenging your interpretation), but I'm curious as to how, if at all, you reconcile that interpretation with the ruling, because I think there might be something obvious that I'm missing here."
EVEX,36l5u5,Forthwrong,6,Wed May 20 17:19:46 2015 UTC,"sorry, for allcaps, I'm pretty sure by now it's necessary:  IMO, THE TWO RULES DON'T CONTRADICT EACH OTHER, THEY JUST PLAY TOGETHER IN A VERY PECULIAR WAY. A RULE ""ALL DEBATE MUST BE HELD IN LOWERCASE ON TUESDAYS"" WOULD DIRECTLY CONTRADICT RULE 7 AND THEREFORE REPLACE IT (ON TUESDAYS). THESE TWO RULES HOWEVER HAVE A PERFECTLY STABLE STATE IF NO DEBATE IS POSTED AT ALL.  WE DON'T HAVE A REALLY CLEAR CUT EXAMPLE AT THE MOMENT, SO ALLOW ME TO MAKE TWO SLIGHT ALTERATIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEMONSTRATION. RULE 14 STATES THAT ALL NSFW OR NSFL POSTS MUST DESCRIBE THEIR CONTENT IN THE TITLE. RULE 16 ALSO INCLUDES THAT THE SPOILED CONTENT CANNOT BE INCLUDED IN THE TITLE. IT IS EASY TO IMAGINE THAT THESE TWO RULES HAD PASSED IN THIS FORM. THEY DO NOT CONTRADICT EACH OTHER, SO RULE 16 DID NOT TRUMP RULE 14 AND ALTER IT TO RESOLVE THE CONFLICT. (AS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THEY DID, DEMONSTRATED BY THE STRIKETHROUGH OF REFERENDUM 2).  IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, LET'S IMAGINE A NSFW POST WHOSE CONTENT CANNOT BE DESCRIBED WITHOUT REVEALING SPOILERS FOR A CURRENT MOVIE. RULE 14 ALLOWS THE CONTENT TO BE POSTED AS LONG AS A DESCRIPTION IS INCLUDED IN THE TITLE. RULE 16 ALLOWS THIS CONTENT TO BE POSTED AS LONG AS THERE IS NO DESCRIPTION IN THE TITLE AND A SPOILER-TAG IS ADDED. EVEN THOUGH THE RULES DON'T CONTRADICT EACH OTHER AND EVEN THOUGH NO RULE FORBIDS SUBMITTING THE POST, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO SO WITHOUT BREAKING A RULE."
EVEX,36l5u5,Tobl4,5,Wed May 20 20:48:46 2015 UTC,"Aha. Would it be reflective of a correct understanding to summarise your interpretation thus:  That a contradiction in the rules for which the newer trumps the older only includes contradictions present between the rules themselves—that is, where it's categorically impossible for a rule to have effect unless another rule is broken—rather than between specific instances of rule interplay—that is, where it can sometimes be possible to adhere to both rules?"

RIGHT NOW, RULES CANNOT BE REMOVED.  I can understand your concern though. It is for the same reason that I argued that currently, referendums cannot remove rules. HOWEVER, REFERENDUMS ARE SPECIFICALLY ALLOWED TO ALTER WHAT IS WITHIN THE REALM OF REFERENDUMS, WHICH IS WHY I THINK THAT THIS KIND OF CHANGE, IF SUPPORTED BY THE MAJORITY, IS ENTIRELY APPROPIATE.  If you have another idea, how we should remove rules, I encourage you to submit a referendum for that. I am a strong supporter of expressing your ideas through referendums and testing them in the political discourse of this sub.

It involved the vast majority of the world's nations—including all of the great powers—eventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of ""total war"", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (during which approximately 11 million people were killed)   and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (during which approximately one million people were killed, including the use of two nuclear weapons in combat),  it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.

EVEX,36fyao,wobatt,7,Tue May 19 02:27:33 2015 UTC,"Hi,  first of all, great suggestion, it's more than overdue. I know, I'm the one who argued that the past repeal-referendums were unconstitutional, but that's only because right now referendums can't remove rules, not because I think they shouldn't.  Do you want future changes to the referendum procedure (for example a change to the threshold) to also apply to the vote removal? In that case, you could simplify the referendum to ""Allow referendums that call for the repeal of a rule."". Most people here seem to want to allow changes to referendum text as long as the intention stays the same.   Otherwise, since we're currently interpreting literally, your referendums as it stands would create a new procedure that looks exactly like referendums, but if we want to change e.g. the expiration date, we would have to do so seperately for referendums and rule removal."
EVEX,36fyao,Tobl4,2,Tue May 19 08:32:04 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, this should be adding the power of repeal to the referendum process, rather than creating a new one that is the same."

EVEX,36fyao,wobatt,1 point,Tue May 19 12:08:41 2015 UTC,I hope they approve it. I feel that the best thing in this instance for this subreddit would be 2 referendums that have the same end goal but different ways to go about it.

EVEX,36fyao,NotTheDarkLord,1 point,Tue May 19 15:45:16 2015 UTC,"I made it similar to referendums for a couple reasons:   It takes more effort and work to submit a referendum than it does a rule. Which would (hopefully) make knee jerk reactions less likely.  It's a process we're familiar with, but isn't overused. The sub doesn't get as many referendum suggestions as it does rules suggestions.    I'll grant you that it's a tad complex, and I probably could have made it simpler, but that's just something to keep in mind if this one fails."
EVEX,36fyao,Tobl4,3,Tue May 19 11:07:33 2015 UTC,"My question wasn't why you've made it similar to the referendum process, but why you haven't made it the same as a referendum."

FOR EXAMPLE, IF THIS REFERENDUM HAD BEEN PASSED DIRECTLY AFTER RULE 9 (WHICH CREATED REFERENDUMS), THEN RULE REMOVAL WOULD STILL NEED 100 UPVOTES TO REMOVE A RULE BECAUSE THE REFERENDUM TO CHANGE THE THRESHOLD ONLY APPLIES TO REFERENDUM-THRESHOLDS.

To play and splash, like so many puppies, without a care in the world.  But Rule 21 changed it all.    /u/kuilin looked over her post. ""That was a pretty close one,"" she said to her computer. She reread her post, making sure that the title, ""Twenty-first vote results,"" was spelled correctly. ""Well, the will of the people has commanded it,"" she said, ready to bring the results to the virtual crowd.  With a grandiose gesture, she brought her index finger down onto the ENTER button. She then realized she had to actually click the ""Submit"" button. ""I hope nobody saw that,"" she said to herself.  Click    Halfway across the world, a pair of seismologists stirred. The head researcher, Dr. Bradley, looked up at the wall of screens. ""We've got a bit of activity,"" he said, nudging his research partner, Dr. Carter, awake.  ""Hmm? What?"" Carter said, rubbing his eyes. Looking up, he uttered a cry of surprise. ""Oh, wow. Looks like a pretty big one. One point f- no, two point sev- what? It's climbing!""  Dr. Bradley stood in shock as the needle on the seismograph continued its wavering journey rightward. Soon it had nowhere else to go, tapping the right side of the gauge with audible urgency. He turned to Dr. Carter, his face white. ""Look at the map, Carter. Where is the epicenter?""  He looked at the map. Emergency phones were ringing, but he ignored them. ""A few hundred clicks south of Hawaii, sir."" A moment later, he realized what he'd said. ""Wait, what? That's in the middle of the Pacific Plate! How is a quake of that size possible? If-""  A series of beeps and sirens interrupted him. Klaxons sounded. Bells rang.   Dr. Bradley turned to the seismic activity map on the monitor. ""We've got activity!"" he shouted, his panicked eyes frantically scanning the map as it updated in real time. ""Another big one, this time in the Atlantic. Two more in the Pacific. One in the Indian.""  Carter sank down in his chair. ""We're done, aren't we?"" he said. The room began to shake before Bradley could give his response. Words were shouted. Screams echoed in the din. A bookshelf fell over. Carter, groping wildly, managed to smash the reinforced cover on an ominous-looking button. He uttered a gasp that no one would hear as he sliced his hand open on the shattered glass. He managed to press the button, but as his finger touched the plastic a ceiling beam gave way, crushing his skull beyond all hope of survival.  And then came the water.  There were no more screams. There was no more time. The last wish of Dr. Bradley would be a death by drowning. Unfortunately, his final request would not be granted.    Researcher's Journal - September 26, [DATA EXPUNGED]  Head Researcher, Drill Team Theta-6  In science, they teach you a lot about heat. It can do some interesting things, given enough of it. It can turn sedimentary rocks into metamorphic beauties, or it can melt the flesh off your bones.   We don't know too much about what happened after the Great Quake. However, survivors tell of beings made entirely of water. Able to take any form of water at will, they typically manifested as rolls of fog or puddles of water. Once a human walked into the fog, or stepped into the puddle, they would quickly become covered in a thin layer of fog or water, which would quickly become opaque, then dissolve into its original form, leaving nothing behind.  We hoped to find a solution in the depths of the earth. Rumors of a race of fire beings swirled among the surviving factions. Settlements, tunnel systems, developed like ant colonies along the insides of volcanoes.   Today, we drill. Mount [REDACTED], the volcano located just southwest of [REDACTED], was deemed to have the highest probability of yielding results.   We've staked our entire race on a prayer. God help us all.    Researcher's Journal - September 29, [DATA EXPUNGED]  Head Researcher, Drill Team Theta-6  It looks like we've finally found something. Using a combination of diamond-plated drainage pipes, siphoning away the magma, and a diamond-tipped titanium drill bit and auger, we've discovered a series of tunnels. These tunnels were filled with magma, however- it is currently unknown what lived inside them. Once we drained the magma, all electromagnetic readings ceased. Perhaps the lava was giving off radiation? Needs more testing.    Researcher's Journal - September 30, [DATA EXPUNGED]  Head Researcher, Drill Team Theta-6  I'm beginning to think we've done something terribly wrong. Terribly, horribly wrong. I don't know if there's some sort of cognitohazard involved in what we've been doing, but I've been having these strange dreams. I walk over to the tank storage, where we've been keeping the magma, and see these faces inside. As soon as I put my face near the reinforced window, a face slams against it, and I wake up in the hallway outside my dormitory.  I'm beginning to think it has something to do with the damn magma. I might just have the boys dump it out the side of the mountain, see what happens to the damn Wetbacks out there.    Researcher's Journal - October 5, [DATA EXPUNGED]  Head Researcher, Drill Team Theta-6  By siphoning the lava, we were capturing them. When I dumped them, we set them free.  How could I have been so stupid as to think they would owe us anything, that they would show us any loyalty? I sent my research assistant, my own son, out there to talk with them. He barely got out a sentence before they engulfed him in flames.  I sit here, holding my head in my hands, wishing I could go back and end this before it began. My son, my team, my country, and now even my species are dead. They can read, I don't know how, but they can read. They learn faster than any computer or AI ever developed, and exhibit a pure hivemind behavior. I don't think we stand a chance.  I have to go back. If I can save my son, I'm willing to rip the entire universe apart, thread by metaphysical thread.  I just have to make it across the hall without being noticed, get the device onto my wrist, and press the button.  May God have mercy on my soul."

Only drawbacks are it takes a while to learn and isn't Hawk's Feather.) B: Killer's Aim (May not be the most useful in the modern world, and since shooting to wound was never really a viable strategy with guns anyway there aren't really drawbacks. You could probably make a shitton playing baseball though.) C: Seeker's Curiosity (A lot of perks, and the only real downside is that you gain a really strong intuition that you have to decide whether to follow or not. However, I could see this being a pretty big problem and I don't think I'd want to have to deal with having a really shitty intuition that is wrong as many times as it is right. Overall I'd give this ability an Eh) Lion's Heart (Gain a lot of abilities, but being bigger isn't always better. Also you become more reckless. Ok overall, but with better abilities I don't see why you'd ever choose this.) F:    MOTHER FUCKING DARK GOD'S GIFT What's the point???? I get being a necromancer might be cool and all but that doesn't make up for the fact that you'd be creepy as hell and not be able to feel pain. Wait, not feeling pain is good you say? Well you are Mother Fucking WRONG!!!!!! Accidently leave your hand on the stove? Well, you won't be feeling that. Now you'll have as many hands as you have brains for picking this! Coupled with the fact that you are not able to regenerate your body, being immortal is pretty much useless (and that's excluding the fact that being conscious after you want to die would suck [though luckily you could die with this version of immortality]). Get a cut? Well OOPS that's permanent now! Get into a car crash and suffer a moderate to severe injury? Well guess what even if a regular person could just stay in the hospital and be fine you're pretty much screwed. All of this combined makes this THE WORST GIFT OUT OF ALL OF THEM, and that's INCLUDING the fact that you could have your own army of the dead and be immune to disease. Unless you have a major Hitler fetish and want to take over the world, this ability gets a .000001/8 Horrible B8 M8.

Doesn't sound bad at all.   You could argue that the wound fixes are temporary, but when you think about it it's like that for a normal human being too. Sure, you can cure a disease or heal a wound, but ultimately you will fall ill again and you will become injured again. The only difference is you'll eventually die from an illness or injury, but the Necro won't.   As for not feeling pain being bad...you're joking right? That comparison was very bad. The thing you seem to neglect is that you'll still feel all other sensations associated with your six senses. Your hand on stove example. Yeah, it won't hurt, but you'll feel the intense heat and instinctively move your hand away. That has always been a ridiculous argument in my opinion because pain does not equate to your other touch based sensations, which you would still retain in the absence of pain.   Dark Gods gift is probably one of the better ones."

EVEX,36aupi,noisufroloc,4,Wed May 20 04:47:47 2015 UTC,Seeker's Curiosity all the way.
EVEX,36aupi,whynaut4,4,Mon May 18 00:11:10 2015 UTC,"I'd rank them in the order:   Hawk's Feather - Literally no drawbacks, lots of skill boosts, flight and fast wound healing would be pretty awesome. Generally very useful in day-to-day life. Seeker's Curiosity - Drawback isn't really a drawback, just a limitation to the precognition perk. Teleportation would be very useful in general. I could use knowing where things are, potentially even to help out with rescue operations or solve mysteries. Magi's Spark - Again, the drawback isn't really a drawback. The telekineses could come in useful, although not as much as flight and teleporting. The spells seem focused too much on combat though, and would likely bring a lot of attention to you. Killer's Aim - I don't kill people often enough for this to impact me. All shots are intended to kill, so I imagine that this isn't just general increase aim that could be transferred over to sports. Plus line of sight is a pretty big limitation. Lion's Heart - Strength boost is way too excessive. Double height plus triple weight would be incredibly inconvenient and noticeable. It'd prohibit you from living a somewhat normal life, and I don't think the physical bonuses would make up for it. Dark God's Gift - ""Immortal"" is canceled out by the non-regeneration. In fact, you'd probably die a lot sooner when you cannot be healed permanently. Necromancy and plague magic really aren't things I'd even want to use. Only slight bonus is immunity to diseases, but it's really not worth it."
EVEX,36aupi,polyheathon,6,Mon May 18 18:05:56 2015 UTC,"Wait, a Lion's Heart makes you twice as tall? How is that not a negative? Even if you are 4 feet nothing, you now become freaking 8 feet tall."

Why can't the moderators (assuming you mean the real mods, not the wiki-mods) serve as Justices? The mods are currently, to some degree, the arbiters of how the rules are to be interpreted, and it's my understanding that they have some degree of commitment to neutrality, so I think they would do well as Justices. The balance of power referendum mentions the head mod, but not other mods. How often will Justices be voted upon? This isn't specified in the referendum. A role of many Supreme Courts is to determine interpretation of the law. Is the interpretation of the rules still going to be up to the mods, thereby restricting this Court's power to either repealing a content rule or holding another referendum?"

I love a certain place, and at the end of my life, I hope I'll have the privilege to die in this place of all places (don't misinterpret that). I don't think it would be remotely difficult for me to feel negatively about this rule, but I believe that would be the wrong attitude to have.  As I wrote twenty days ago, I had seriously considered whether it would be worthwhile for me to stay, and I'm glad I decided that, because over time, even the most annoying rules will eventually become smaller in proportion to the rest of one's experience in Evex. Leaving based upon one rule is an impulsive reaction to something that's neither ubiquitous nor perennial, so it's a reaction that's rather unlikely to be the result of serious reasoning.  And if it is the result of serious reasoning, the reasoning isn't on the same calibre as the rule. The rule appears to be of a more humorous than political nature, so responding to it so seriously simply doesn't seem befitting.

EVEX,36a9dc,Carl_the_Glorious,8,Sun May 17 20:05:43 2015 UTC,"There's no official procedure for what to do if a contradiction is found in the rules, but it seems like addressing the contradiction would be the subject of any referendum of how to deal with rule contradictions. Some formalities of establishing an official Supreme Court sounds fun, though.  Nevertheless, a discussion about a potential contradiction within the rules seems to me to be entirely in order."

EVEX,366p6o,Tobl4,2,Sat May 16 21:45:46 2015 UTC,"That's an excellent idea, and I'm all for the inclusion of movie night in the Library, but I think that including an event that has only occurred once so far may set a precedent that one-off events merit inclusion in the Library, and I have my doubts about including one-offs in the Library because, while they may have had an impact on Evex when active, they could lose relevance over time.  So, respectfully, in the spirit of keeping consistency in the Library without needing to include one-offs, I'd like to hold off on including movie night until the second movie night establishes that movie night is indeed a tradition, rather than a one-off, in Evex.  Of course, I'm absolutely open to feedback, and if you disagree with my reasoning, I'm open to reconsidering my position."

And apropos style, do you have any idea about how to make reddit wikis compatible with RES night mode?  I hope this comment won't obliterate my credibility as a Curator"
EVEX,366p6o,Tobl4,2,Sat May 16 21:58:37 2015 UTC,"No idea, never worked on a reddit-wiki. If it works like the normal subreddits, you'll have to go into the CSS.  If the problem with the navigation was getting the header centered, that really is ridiculously complicated considering that CSS is supposed to be a formatting language. Currently the (imo) best method is:  position:relative; left: 50%; transform: translateX(-50%);   Edit: Just checked, the wiki uses the same stylesheet as the subreddit, so if you know css you can edit that."
EVEX,366p6o,Tobl4,1 point,Sat May 16 22:12:48 2015 UTC,I think beyond the possibilities of a wiki you can't stylize much. You might have to read the RES wiki about your issue with the library. I guess the subreddit style can't be used there

EVEX,3626sg,Tobl4,5,Fri May 15 13:54:11 2015 UTC,"My opinion on this is three-layered, but please bear with me.    1) Currently, we have a policy of enforcing rules according to the literal meaning of the words. According to that, referendums should only need 50 Upvotes, not Karma. If we don't enforce this, we set precedent that it's okay to not use the literal meaning sometimes, giving the mods the power to arbitrarily decide how they want to interpret rules. (Maybe they wouldn't, but they could.)    2) Obviously, it was the intent of both the author and the upvoters that Karma should be the threshold. Because of that it's easy to argue that Karma should be the threshold, we could even rush through a Referendum to change the text and still address layer 1's concern. However, that would only cure one symptom. That one of our core rules, written down by the mods as a wiki-entry had this problem shows how easy it is to write rules that convey their intent, but not literally mean it. There are other examples as well. I highly recommend we enact the referendum to enforce based on intent instead of literal interpretation. This will solve this problem, as well as any future conflicts of this kind that will happen otherwise. Evexians are not lawyers (at least not most of us).    3) The third layer is less directly tied to this discussion and far less important. If you want to support the referendum but haven't yet because you haven't finished reading, do it now! Done? Good. Now, independent of the original intent, maybe we should have Upvotes instead of Karma as the threshold. We've decided to call this system ""referendum"", but the first stage is actually modeled after a petition. The key difference to actual petitions? In real life, you cannot sign against a petition, only for it. That's because a petition doesn't directly create a law, it opens a discussion. Similarly, here in Evex the first stage doesn't create a rule, it only means that the suggestion will be voted on. Those opposed to a referendum will get a chance to vote against it, downvoting the submission itself is saying ""Your idea isn't even worth to be voted upon"". Tbh, I feel that way about some referendum-submissions, but that feeling shouldn't give me the right to deny the suggester a fair discussion or a possible vote. Counting Upvotes only and disincentivicing downvotes will increase the visibility of referendums (due to reddit's sorting algorithms), promote discussion and give referendums a fair vote among all Evexians, even if they don't already have a overwhelming majority to start with."
EVEX,3626sg,Tobl4,2,Fri May 15 15:07:57 2015 UTC,"If layer 3 comes to pass (upvote-threshold + discourage downvotes), I would recommend the inclusion of this CSS-snippet:  div.linkflair-official > div.midcol > div.arrow.down {     display: none; }   It will hide the downvote arrows only on official posts (red flair). This only works for desktop users and can easily be circumvented, but it reinforces the notion that referendums should not be downvoted.   Of course this could also be used only on referendums, not e.g. vote announcement if we use different css-classes for those, but really, all the announcements so far are imo upvote-only-worthy."
EVEX,3626sg,Tobl4,4,Fri May 15 17:04:14 2015 UTC,"I really don't think it would look good to newcomers out of context if we disabled downvoting of official posts... And we're going to have to use the equation to solve for up votes anyways, we know the percent number is accurate too, so I don't think this is necessary."
EVEX,3626sg,nospr2,2,Fri May 15 18:00:06 2015 UTC,"That's a good point about newcomers and selectively disabled downvotes. As I said, it can be seperated if we use different css-classes. Also, it's css, you can do whatever with it, for example a popup that downvoting referendums is discouraged instead of outright hiding the arrow.  THE REASON I ADVOCATE THIS (OR OTHER DISCOURAGEMENT FROM DOWNVOTING REFERENDUMS) IS NOT BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET AN ACCURATE UPVOTE-COUNT (THOUGH MORE DOWNVOTES MIGHT INCREASE FUZZINESS), BUT BECAUSE DOWNVOTES TAKE AWAY FROM A REFERENDUM'S VISIBILITY, STIFLING DEBATE ON THAT MATTER."
EVEX,3626sg,nospr2,2,Fri May 15 18:05:57 2015 UTC,"I think if we go by upvotes instead of karma, more referendums have a chance to be seen and voted on at the end of the week."
EVEX,3626sg,Tobl4,4,Fri May 15 17:14:19 2015 UTC,I think it should just plainly be Upvotes. Since the 'Karma' number of a post is Upvotes - Downvotes.  I don't think there's any harm in having it be based on the number of Upvotes since it's not too hard to calculate that number based on the number of votes and the karma it has.
EVEX,3626sg,Tobl4,2,Fri May 15 14:36:12 2015 UTC,"The post asks for two seperate discussions:   Should the referendum-threshold be counted in Karma or in Upvotes? If we switch to Upvotes, should old referendums be reevaluated?   Since the two discussions don't really have much to do with each other and mixing them complicates voting if you only agree with half of what someone said, I propose that the smaller, second discussion be held in replies to this comment. This isn't official, but by seperating the discussions we'll make voting a lot easier and the other top level comments haven't touched on that subject anyway (at least until now)."
EVEX,3626sg,Tobl4,2,Fri May 15 15:32:20 2015 UTC,"I might be too late, but maybe this should have had a red discussion-flair? It is a bit more important (or at the very least more official) than aylmao and the game."
EVEX,3626sg,Virian900,3,Sat May 16 15:14:07 2015 UTC,"I think there's good arguments for both sides here.  When I first suggested the referendum process, I intended for it to run off karma. That was back in those halcyon days when men were men, women were women, and we weren't running around trying to find loopholes in EVEX.  However... I think in this one particular case, I would support a literal interpretation of the rules. If you think about how any actual referendum works, you just have to get X number of people to sign in support, not X more to sign than those who disliked it fundamentally.  It would also make the actual voting on referendums more interesting and important. Only one referendum has ever failed from the ballot, most pass with flying colors. This would make the ballot vote more meaningful."
EVEX,3626sg,Tobl4,4,Fri May 15 14:47:44 2015 UTC,"if we begin doing it the latter way then should old referendums that used to qualify that now don't be put to vote again?   Upvotes are always ≥ Karma, so any referendum that qualified before would still qualify.  edit: guys, downvote this already. He edited it; this has served its purpose and is now irrelevant."
EVEX,3626sg,Tobl4,6,Fri May 15 14:07:54 2015 UTC,"I worded that incorrectly, I meant some referendums that didn't go to vote are now eligible. I'll edit it."
EVEX,3626sg,Tobl4,1 point,Fri May 15 14:13:52 2015 UTC,"I suggest the requirements should be: X upvotes and a minimum of Y karma. For example 50 upvotes and at least 30 karma needed. Also, I am against reevaluating older referendums. Lex retro non agit."
EVEX,3626sg,Tobl4,2,Fri May 15 15:37:45 2015 UTC,"I DON'T THINK THAT THE TWO-THRESHOLD SYSTEM WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA. IF SOMETHING HAS 50 UPVOTES BUT A KARMA OF 0 (→ ALSO 50 DOWNVOTES), THEN THAT REFERENDUM HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE VERY INVESTED IN IT WITH EQUAL PARTS OF THE PETITIONERS FOR AND AGAINST IT. THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF REFERENDUM THAT WE NEED TO VOTE ON.  However, I agree with you on the second point that 'Lex retro non agit.'. Those referendums were created and voted on under the impression that they needed to reach 50 Karma. They didn't and that's it. If they have a better chance under the new system, they can always be resubmitted."

Speaking for myself, I used to be the lurker, only making an occassional comment here and there. Then I made more and more comments, and gradually got more involved. This was a slow process for me, and I know it would have been faster had there been someone to remind me to do what should be done.  I had been surprised at how often I'd neglected to upvote a submission until I read a comment saying ""upvote for visibility,"" and I have no reason to believe I'm a special case in this regard.  Therefore, I think encouraging people to be more involved may be a decent way of eventually getting some people more involved. Better than not encouraging them, at the very least."

EVEX,35vgpf,autowikibot,9,Wed May 13 21:12:37 2015 UTC,"Merkel-Raute:       The Merkel-Raute  (German for ""Merkel rhombus""; in English media also called the Merkel diamond  or ""Triangle of Power"")  is a hand gesture made by resting one's hands in front of the stomach so that the fingertips meet, with the thumbs and index fingers forming a rough quadrangular shape. As the signature gesture of Angela Merkel, the current German Chancellor, it has been described as ""probably one of the most recognisable hand gestures in the world"".   Asked about how the Merkel-Raute was introduced as her trademark, Angela Merkel stated that ""there was always the question, what to do with your arms, and that's how it came about.""  She chose the gesture without having been assisted by a counsellor  because ""it contains a certain symmetry.""

EVEX,35vsja,Agent78787,20,Sat May 16 01:44:42 2015 UTC,"Rule: Posts and comments discriminating against religious belief, nationality, sexual orientation, or gender (e.g. anti-transgender comments) are banned.  Clarification: This is an extension of Rule 8 (banning racism) and Rule 12 (no SJW/MRA content, thus banning most forms of sexism). This rule is not to be used to stifle civil discussion on any topic at all.  Justification: We need to make all users feel welcome in /r/EVEX regardless of who they are, while still protecting the freedom to speak and discuss. Rules 8 and 12 are the first steps to doing that, and this rule is the next step.   Resulting changes: A more welcoming and civil /r/EVEX."
EVEX,35vsja,Spitalian,3,Sat May 16 01:46:06 2015 UTC,"Would this rule consider it to be discrimination if someone said ""I believe that [religion] is right and [other religion] is wrong.""?  What if someone said ""I believe that heterosexuality is immoral and all non-homosexuals are going to hell""?  What about"" I believe that men and women are equal, but have different roles and men's place is at home with their families  not working"".   In my opinion, all of those statements express a belief rather than an attack or discrimination and therefore should be allowed as opposed to ""I hope you burn in hell, you filthy straight person!"" which is discrimatory.  I ask because I've seen rules like this used in the past to restrict expressions of beliefs, and I think that there should be room for civil discourse with an attitude of respect rather than labeling nonconformity as discrimination."

They would all be allowed if this rule were to pass.  Yes, this rule is definitely intended to foster a culture of civil respect as opposed to weeding out nonconformity. It does depend on the quality of the enforcement (I.E. The moderators) but I'm confident that the mods can enforce this rule so that it does not stifle discussion but improve it instead."

EVEX,35r4g0,briizo,4,Tue May 12 20:41:14 2015 UTC,"I DISAGREE WITH THIS REFERENDUM... BUT HAVING READ THE ARGUMENTS OVER THIS COMMENT AS IT TOOK PLACE (and agreeing largely with /u/nospr2 about what was clearly intended) I WANTED TO TAKE SOME TIME TO THINK ABOUT WHY I DISAGREE.  SO, UNFORTUNATELY IT SEEMS LIKE I'M SHOUTING BUT REALLY I'M JUST SHARING A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE.  IF WE ALWAYS GO BY WHAT THE AUTHOR'S INTENTIONS ARE, THEN WE NEVER CAN REALLY KNOW WHAT WE ARE VOTING ON IN THE RULE SUGGESTION THREADS WITHOUT QUESTIONING THE AUTHOR TO MAKE SURE. TAKE, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT COMMENT/RULE, Schrödinger's Rule:   If this is passed this will either ban Image Macros or ban suggesting a ban of Image Macros. If this rule is passed the actual rule is decided by chance. If it wins by with an odd number of votes, we ban Image Macros. If it wins with an even number of votes, we ban suggesting a ban of Image Macros.  This is Schrödinger's rule because you do not know what the rule is until it has already won the vote on Friday.   THE ORIGINAL WORDING (THE WORDING I AND MANY OTHERS VOTED ON) IS THE UN-CROSSED OUT TEXT (SO IT READ ""If it wins by an odd number of votes, we ban Image Macros""). TO ME, WINNING ""BY"" SOMETHING IMPLIES A MARGIN. WE WOULD ABSOLUTELY NEVER SAY ""Oh Bush won by 50%"" WHEN TALKING ABOUT THE 2000 PRESIDENTIAL. HE WON WITH FIFTY PERCENT.  IF BOTH OF THESE HAD BEEN WORDED THE SAME WAY, THEN FINE, THE AUTHOR (/u/nospr2, whose posts I generally like and whose rule I liked as well) CLEARLY COULD MAKE A CASE FOR HAVING A DIFFERENCE IN OPINION ON WHICH PRASE MAKES MORE SENSE (IN OTHER WORDS, IF THERE WAS CONSISTENCY THEN I WOULD UNDERSTAND THE CONFUSION- IT WOULD CREATE AN EITHER OR SCENARIO IF ""BY"" OR ""WITH"" WAS USED IN BOTH SITUATIONS)..  THIS IS THE COMMENT WITH THE JUSTIFICATION OF KEEPING IT AS AN ""EITHER OR"" SITUATION:    THE DEFINATION OF BY: INDICATING THE MEANS OF ACHIEVING SOMETHING.  THAT MEANS THAT SAYING 'BY WINNING' WITH AN ODD NUMBER OF VOTES. I MEAN IT ACHIEVED WINNING, HAVING AN ODD NUMBER OF VOTES.  I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE MAKING UP EXTRA RULES TO GO ALONG WITH MY RULE :(  THE LITERALLY INTERPRETATION OF SAYING ONE WINS WINNING BY AND EVEN NUMBER AND THE OTHER WINS WITH AN ODD NUMBERS WOULD BE THAT IT'S AN EITHER OR SITUATION.  I NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT COMPARING TO THE 2ND VOTED RULE IN MY RULE. IF YOU WERE TO INSTATE THAT AS PART OF MY SUGGESTED RULE, THEN YOU'RE ADDING AN EXTRA LINE AND CLAUSE TO MY RULE. IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM FAIR THAT THE ONE CHANCE I GET TO ONE OF MY RULES ADDED, SOMEONE IS ALLOWED TO CHANGE THE MEANING OF MY RULE BECAUSE THEY INTERPRET THE WORD 'BY' TO HAVE MANY DIFFERENT EXPLANATIONS.   AS A LANGUAGE THING, THIS ARGUMENT DIDN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE TO ME. I HAVE PERSONALLY NEVER HEARD SOMEONE USE THE WORD 'BY' IN THIS CONTEXT AND NOT MEAN A MARGIN/COMPARISON. HOW WEIRD WOULD THAT BE?    ""The Cubs won that game by 7 runs."" ""I won the talent show by an odd number of votes.""    IN THE FIRST SENTENCE, EVERYONE WOULD ASSUME THAT THE CUBS WERE 7 RUNS AHEAD AT THE END OF THE GAME. THE SECOND ONE (WHICH APPLIES DIRECTLY HERE) SEEMS TO BE A SIMILAR/EXACT SITUATION.. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WINNER'S VOTES AND THE SECOND PLACE PERSON(S)' VOTES IS ODD.   ANYWAY... I DON'T CARE ABOUT SCHRÖDINGER'S RULE'S INTERPRETATION AT ALL. I THINK PEOPLE WERE AFRAID IN THAT THREAD TO SAY THAT THEY DIDN'T REALLY SEE THE RULE THAT WAY (BECAUSE WHY WOULD WE WANT IT TO BE A CONFUSING MESS..?). I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT THAT /u/nospr2 HAD WORDED IT WITH 'WITH' BOTH TIMES, BUT UPON READING AGAIN (AT THE PROMPTING OF THE USER IN THAT THREAD) I HONESTLY BELIEVED THAT THE WORDING WAS POOR AND CONFUSING.  REGARDLESS, I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA THAT SOMEONE CAN, AFTER IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME TO CHANGE MY VOTE, CLARIFY A RULE TO MEAN SOMETHING I DIDN'T INTEND TO VOTE FOR (again, that didn't happen in this case). NOW, I DON'T LIKE ANY IDEAS OF THE MODS DOING THIS EITHER... BUT I DON'T THINK THEY ARE ""RE-INTREPRETING"" THINGS WHEN THEY USE THE MOST COMMON, LITERAL DEFINITION.   A LOT OF SUBS HAVE PROBLEMS OF 'RULES LAWYERING' WHERE PEOPLE WILL USE REALLY ODD DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS TO GET OUT OF BEING BANNED OR BREAKING THE RULES OR WHATEVER. WE SHOULD HAVE CLEAR RULES SO THAT THE MODS' JOB IS EASY, ALMOST MECHANICAL (IDEALLY, I THINK, WE WOULDN'T HAVE ANY HUMAN JUDGEMENT GETTING IN THE WAY).  IN MY OPINION, /u/nospr2 DID CHANGE THE RULE AFTER IT WAS VOTED AND PASTED INTO THE SUGGESTION THREAD. I'M ALL FOR HAVING RULES/REFERENDUMS WITH EDITS TO REFLECT FEEDBACK, BUT NOT AFTER THOSE RULES/REFERENDUMS HAVE BEEN PUT UP TO A VOTE AND PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY VOTED. I DON'T SEE WHY IT'S SO IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO BE CLEAR WITH COMMON/NORMAL LANGUAGE. IN THIS SPECIFIC CASE... NOBODY ASKED FOR CLARIFICATION IN TIME, BUT IMO THE AUTHORS OF RULES SHOULD BE CLEAR ENOUGH THAT THERE CANNOT BE ROOM FOR REASONABLE MIS-INTREPRETATION. MOST OTHER RULES AND REFERENDUMS SO FAR FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY.  IN THE CASE OF THE REFERENDUM TO IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT, YES IT WAS INTENDED TO IMPEACH THE FIRST PRESIDENT AS WELL... IF SOMEONE COULD HAVE ASKED BEFORE IT WAS TAKENT TO A VOTE, I THINK THAT WOULD HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM. I ALSO AGREE WITH THE MODS' HANDLING OF THE SITUATION- I THINK THAT IT'S REASONABLE TO SAY THAT THE REFERENDUM WOULDN'T APPLY TO THE FIRST PRESIDENT.   /long wall of text  Anyway. Reading this post, it sort of feels like an attack, but it's not meant this way. I really really happen to disagree with the idea of being enforced on the premise of intent... to me it seems like if we have to explain/clarify the intent with language (which we do), why the eff can't we just use that same, clear language in the original post."
EVEX,35r4g0,Calvin_,1 point,Fri May 15 14:44:20 2015 UTC,"if we have to explain/clarify the intent with language (which we do), why the eff can't we just use that same, clear language in the original post.   THE PURPOSE OF LANGUAGE IS TO GET FROM INTENTION TO INTERPRETATION AS SMOOTHLY AS POSSIBLE. FOCUSING ON THE LANGUAGE ADDS NEEDLESS COMPLICATION WHEN WE COULD JUST FOCUS ON THE INTENTION—WHEN LANGUAGE HAS FAILED TO DO ITS JOB OF GETTING FROM INTENTION TO INTERPRETATION SMOOTHLY, WHY SHOULD WE FOCUS MORE ON THE LANGUAGE WHEN WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS NOT THE LANGUAGE BUT THE INTENTION?   WE NEVER CAN REALLY KNOW WHAT WE ARE VOTING ON IN THE RULE SUGGESTION THREADS WITHOUT QUESTIONING THE AUTHOR TO MAKE SURE.   I THINK THAT QUESTIONING THE AUTHOR—IF THE AUTHOR IS UNCLEAR IN THE FIRST PLACE—WOULD BE A BETTER WAY OF SETTLING SOMETHING THAN TRYING TO RELY ON A LITERAL INTERPREETATION, THE LIKES OF WHICH HAVE SPAKED PLENTY OF DEBATES HERE.    I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA THAT SOMEONE CAN, AFTER IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME TO CHANGE MY VOTE, CLARIFY A RULE TO MEAN SOMETHING I DIDN'T INTEND TO VOTE FOR   THERE'S OBVIOUSLY THE PROBLEM OF NEUTRALITY, WHICH RAISES THE FEAR THAT THE AUTHOR MAY ""CHANGE"" THE RULE BY AN EX POST FACTO CLARIFICATION, BUT THIS IS ALSO POSSIBLE WITH A LITERAL INTERPRETATION BY CREATING A DEBATE ABOUT THE LANGUAGE OF THE RULE.   THE AUTHORS OF RULES SHOULD BE CLEAR ENOUGH THAT THERE CANNOT BE ROOM FOR REASONABLE MIS-INTREPRETATION.   I AGREE THAT THE AUTHORS SHOULD BE CLEAR ENOUGH (THE INTENTION OF MY VERY FIRST EVEX SUGGESTION WAS TO MAKE RULES CLEARER BY DELINEATING INTENT), BUT EVIDENTLY THEY OFTEN AREN'T CLEAR ENOUGH. BUT A LITERAL INTERPRETATION MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO DEFINE WHAT A ""REASONABLE"" MISINTERPRETATION IS, BECAUSE THE REASONABILITY OF THE INTERPRETATION DEPENDS ON WHAT WE THINK THE INTENT IS—IF AN INTERPRETATION VARIES TOO MUCH FROM WHAT WE THINK THE AUTHOR INTENDED, WE DEEM THE INTERPRETATION UNREASONABLE.  IN THIS WAY, A ""REASONABLE"" LITERAL INTERPRETATION IS ESSENTIALLY A FLAWED INTENT-BASED INTERPRETATION WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF LANGUAGE CHANGING WHAT THE THING MEANS.   TO ME, WINNING ""BY"" SOMETHING IMPLIES A MARGIN.   ""TO ME""—THEREIN LIES THE FATAL FLAW. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW A LITERAL INTERPRETATION IS JUST SUBJECTIVE INTERPRETATION MASQUERADING AS SOMETHING MORE OBJECTIVE.   I HAVE PERSONALLY NEVER HEARD SOMEONE USE THE WORD 'BY' IN THIS CONTEXT AND NOT MEAN A MARGIN/COMPARISON.   BUT USING ""BY"" FOR ""BY MEANS OF"" IS ANOTHER COMMON USAGE, AND JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T HEARD IT USED THAT WAY IN THAT CONTEXT DOESN'T MEAN SOMEONE ELSE CAN'T THINK THAT IT MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE TO USE IT THAT WAY. EVEX ALSO HAS A BROAD COMMUNITY AND THE DIALECTS OF ENGLISH WE CAN SEE HERE ARE LIKELY RATHER DIVERSE, SO FAVOURING ONE OVER THE OTHER WOULD BE ANOTHER WAY OF DISGUISING SUBJECTIVE PREFERENCE AS OBJECTIVE FACT. THAT IS, IT'S DIFFICULT TO REASONABLY MAKE AN ARGUMENT THAT ""THIS CONSTRUCTION COULD NEVER MEAN THAT"" SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE ARE TOO MANY DIALECTS TO ACCOUNT FOR."
EVEX,35r4g0,Forthwrong,2,Sat May 16 03:27:31 2015 UTC,"I'm replying to this many days later because.. well I took some time to think about it, let this situation occur with a few other rules/referenda. This referendum is close to passing, and will probably on the next ballot, so I thought I'd clarify/strengthen the argument against it. And, especially after reading and re-reading your post(s), it seems like this intent referendum wouldn't be the worst thing to happen to this sub. We/I have been de facto using this referendum's intent already.   I'm still against it though, for a few reasons..    me: WE NEVER CAN REALLY KNOW WHAT WE ARE VOTING ON IN THE RULE SUGGESTION THREADS WITHOUT QUESTIONING THE AUTHOR TO MAKE SURE.     you: I THINK THAT QUESTIONING THE AUTHOR—IF THE AUTHOR IS UNCLEAR IN THE FIRST PLACE—WOULD BE A BETTER WAY OF SETTLING SOMETHING THAN TRYING TO RELY ON A LITERAL INTERPREETATION, THE LIKES OF WHICH HAVE SPAKED PLENTY OF DEBATES HERE.   Why set up a whole process for this, with no term limits? When can the mods no longer edit their thinking or interpretation? After it's voted on, before, anytime when someone asks? Can I ask the mods to clarify a post from a long time ago?  I personally think that the author should be allowed to clarify. I've been asking a lot of people to clarify in suggestion threads/voting threads/results threads. I don't want to define the powers of the OP without any limits, essentially. I'm not suggesting a counter-referendum, but imho the process should go like this:   someone posts a rule or referendum or whatever people reply or comment on it, it gets voted in. throughout this process the OP can edit the comment/post to reflect feedback the mods copy and paste the link to that comment/referendum in the weekly voting thread (assuming it gets voted high enough) OP can no longer edit the post- it's voted upon as is. clarification after the fact can happen (like if something wasn't addressed at all and a mod wants advice on what to do [i don't remember a specific example of this happening]), but if everyone voted up a comment that didn't make sense or wasn't clear... then the most simple language interpretation trumps what the OP says after it wins. it's too late, they had the time in steps 1-2 to fix their post.   So.. for the example I linked above, the request for clarification I made on the 19th vote results... honestly I feel like that referendum should only apply to rules. Yeah, it would blow if that were the case, but why not require that to be edited in in order to implement it..? In this specific case, people commented to ask for clarification and it wasn't until the rule won that we finally knew what /u/thejstandsfor meant.   YES, I get it, most people understood. I understood too. Fine. But this a clear case of where the wording that was voted for will not be implemented. It's unambiguous. The post read we    ""When there are a total of 52 referendums and rules, a vote of no confidence will be held. The 26 least popular rules will be revoked. ""   It's possible people voted for it based on that interpretation. It's not unclear. The only part that implies that the repeal process applies to referendums is when /u/thejstandsfor references Referendum 2... but that could have just been a good past example of how it work as it would/will applied to rules.  I always feel like a controversial jerk after writing these posts (because I appear to be the minority..?). I didn't put anything in caps yet because I don't feel like the stuff above is argument (I can edit this post if someone disagrees). It's a bunch of facts/opinions on the topic of possibly implementing this referendum, or just generally reforming the process. I never really say ""You're wrong here"" or whatever, because for the most part I agree. I think most of what I've said is just.. factual? I tried to really present all sides to this one specific case.  HERE IS AN ARGUMENT POINT THOUGH THAT I DIDN'T REALIZE UNTIL THIS POST THAT WE DISAGREED ON:  IT SHOULD BE ""OP"" INSTEAD OF MODS THAT CLARIFIES. I THINK THE OP'S SHOULD THE POWER/RESPONSIBILITY TO CLARIFY THEIR OWN SUGGESTIONS. WHY WOULD YOU WANT THE MOD DECIDING WHAT YOUR INTENT WAS..? IT'S NOT ALWAYS CLEAR- THE ONE EXAMPLE FROM THIS POST PROVES THAT POINT. ALSO MODS ARE UNELECTED (EXCEPT FOR THE PRESIDENT) SO IT'S LESS DEMOCRATIC OF A SYSTEM.   Although it would make a cool comparison between the mods and the Supreme Court, with a direct democracy instead of the Senate/HoR.  My main points:  *we are already de facto doing this intent type thing *IT'D BE BETTER TO MAKE SUGGESTIONS/REFERENDUMS CLARIFY-ABLE WITHIN A SPECIFIC WINDOW, EVEN IF THE MODS ARE THE ONES DOING THE CLARIFYING *OP SHOULD DO THE CLARIFYING INSTEAD OF MODS  ninja edit(?): I also want to be clear that I think the OP can clarify in whatever way they want- editing the post, comments, whatever, but they should try to link to any clarification in the original post (perhaps not required if it's in the same thread though)."
EVEX,35r4g0,Calvin_,2,Mon May 25 16:41:07 2015 UTC,"Why set up a whole process for this, with no term limits? When can the mods no longer edit their thinking or interpretation? After it's voted on, before, anytime when someone asks? Can I ask the mods to clarify a post from a long time ago?   A TIME LIMIT FOR ESTABLISHING AN INTERPRETATION SEEMS LIKE A MISAPPLICATION, BECAUSE A NEW INTERPRETATION OF THE RULES BASED UPON A LITERAL INTERPRETATION CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME; THAT'S JUST THE NATURE OF STANDARD LANGUAGE.  About your proposed procedure, I think a lot of it falls under the scope of referendum amendments, which opens up a whole new can of worms.  But to be clear, I have nothing against requiring clarification of the original suggestion upon request, as this would increase clarity regardless of whether a literal or intent-based interpretation is used.   if everyone voted up a comment that didn't make sense or wasn't clear... then the most simple language interpretation trumps what the OP says after it wins.   THIS CONTRADICTS ITSELF. IF A COMMENT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE OR ISN'T CLEAR, THERE IS NO ""MOST SIMPLE LANGUAGE INTERPRETATION"".  I WOULD AGREE WITH ALLOWING THE INTERPRETATION OF INTENTION FALL ENTIRELY IN THE AUTHOR'S HANDS, BUT AS AN ARGUMENT AGAINST THAT, I'D LIKE TO QUOTE YOU IN YOUR FIRST POST:   I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA THAT SOMEONE CAN, AFTER IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME TO CHANGE MY VOTE, CLARIFY A RULE TO MEAN SOMETHING I DIDN'T INTEND TO VOTE FOR   CLEARLY, ALLOWING THE AUTHOR TO INTERPRET THEIR OWN POST AFTER IT'S THERE ALLOWS THEM TO CHANGE THE RULE, BRINGING CONCERNS OF NEUTRALITY. ALLOWING THE MODS TO INTERPRET IT, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE AUTHOR'S STATEMENTS, SEEMS LIKE A MORE NEUTRAL ALTERNATIVE, SINCE THE MODS ARE EVIDENTLY COMMITTED TO NEUTRALITY. I DON'T CARE MUCH ABOUT THIS POINT THOUGH, SINCE IT SEEMS RATHER REMOVED FROM LITERAL INTERPRETATION VS INTENT INTERPRETATION."
EVEX,35r4g0,Forthwrong,2,Mon May 25 20:03:14 2015 UTC,"if everyone voted up a comment that didn't make sense or wasn't clear... then the most simple language interpretation trumps what the OP says after it wins.     THIS CONTRADICTS ITSELF. IF A COMMENT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE OR ISN'T CLEAR, THERE IS NO ""MOST SIMPLE LANGUAGE INTERPRETATION"".   But:   When there are a total of 52 referendums and rules, a vote of no confidence will be held. The 26 least popular rules will be revoked. This only applies to active rules. Referendum 2, for example, would not count toward the total because it has been repealed.    This will give EVEX an occasional reset, while allowing the rules the community values to stay in place. Having too many rules would make posting difficult, and discourage new people from joining the community (no one is going to read a list of 203 rules to ensure their post is allowed).    The President has the right to veto the repeal of up to 4 rules repealed in this vote.     ALMOST EVERYONE ASSUMED THE REPEAL PROCESS APPLIED TO REFERENDUMS. IT WAS UNCLEAR, SOMEWHAT CONTRADICTORY, BUT THE MOST SIMPLE LANGUAGE INTERPRETATION WOULD BE TO NOT INCLUDE REFERENDUMS IN THE REPEAL PROCESS. JUST USING THE WORDS AS THEY ARE REGULARLY DEFINED (THE PREVIOUS EXAMPLE WITH ""BY"" VERSUS ""WITH"" WAS A REALLY BAD EXAMPLE) RESULTS IN THE INTERPRETATION THAT ONLY RULES ARE ABLE TO BE REPEALED.  I STILL DONT THINK YOU'VE ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED THE POINT THAT PEOPLE CAN (AND WILL) VOTE ON REFERENDUMS/RULES WHILE INTERPRETING THEM DIFFERENTLY THAN HOW THE AUTHOR/MODS WILL ULTIMATELY INTERPRET THEM. I THINK THIS IS A CONCESSION I AM UNWILLING TO MAKE, ESPECIALLY SINCE I THINK THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO FIX THIS PROBLEM.  Anyway, I see your other points, you've addressed most of what I have to say. I still disagree with intent over literal interoperation, but I understand that mods can/probably will be more neutral, that a time limit doesn't really make sense/work, etc."
EVEX,35r4g0,Calvin_,2,Mon May 25 21:40:24 2015 UTC,"PEOPLE COULD HAVE ALSO THOUGHT THAT RULES ARE A CATEGORY THAT INCLUDES REFERNDUMS, OR THAT THE ""AND REFERENDUMS"" PART IS IMPLIED. THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF INTERPRETATIONS, AND THE MAJORITY OF WORDS IN ENGLISH HAVE SEVERAL ""REGULAR"" DEFINITIONS.  I haven't focused on how people will interpret things differently because I see that as more of a problem of clarity rather than a problem between literal vs intent-based interpretation; it's something we both want to solve. I think both of us want more clarity, and that's why we're both arguing for our respective sides. (What if we found a way to increase clarity so that it won't be as important whether imperfections are interpreted literally or based on intent?)"

EVEX,35r4g0,nospr2,5,Tue May 12 20:50:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  Honestly since doing a literal interpretation basically it means it's up to the mod to decide, it's so much easier to go by what the author meant. Once we get more complex rules, or a large amount of rules overlapping, it's really important, we don't have arguments become debating the definition of each word in the rule/referendum.  There's no reason we should interpret any rule literally, because we could take any meaning to any word. For example with the last rule, we had 'if the rule wins by an odd number', and taken this literally - it means literally just that, if it wins by having an odd number of votes. However someone else thought taking this literally means that we would compare the votes to the 2nd highest amount of votes. When there's such a huge difference in taking things 'literally', we could not use literal interpretation as a good way to judge rules."

Stuff like metal, on the other hand ""blocks"" the wave, meaning that, as I understand it, the entire wave transfers a the bulk of it's energy in a single explosive moment, the moment that it ""bounces"" off the dense (generally metal) object.  Also, if I'm right, that reflecting of the microwaves might also explain why microwaves get damaged when metal is put in them; microwaves can damage all kinds of things.  I'm pretty sure that's why stuff sparks in the microwave, and why that stuff is generally metal. Not totally sure, though, and I thought CDs usually spark."

EVEX,35e5ov,StezzerLolz,7,Sat May 9 14:29:26 2015 UTC,"Something there is coloured, as the reaction doesn't produce a purple colour in the water like that. However, when the alkali metals react they produce hydrogen and enough heat that the hydrogen ignites. Hydrogen burns with a purple flame the excitation of the rubidium atoms causes purple light to be produced (see below), which i think you can see as the lighter purple towards the bottom of the gif. I can't imagine this causing the colouring in the water too though."

Phenolphthalein is often used as an indicator in acid–base titrations. For this application, it turns colorless in acidic solutions and pink in basic solutions.  Phenolphthalein is slightly soluble in water and usually is dissolved in alcohols for use in experiments. It is a weak acid, which can lose H+ ions in solution. The phenolphthalein molecule is colorless, and the phenolphthalein ion is pink. When a base is added to the phenolphthalein, the molecule ⇌ ions equilibrium shifts to the right, leading to more ionization as H+ ions are removed. This is predicted by Le Chatelier's principle.

But it could be interpretated differently   If it wins with an even number of votes, we ban suggesting a ban of Image Macros.   My interpretation of this is that if schrodinger wins and the number of votes FOR schrodinger is even, we ban the suggestion, which creates scenarios where both or neither requirements are met (or is that intended?), but this too could be interpreted differently"

If the rule wins and the number of its votes is even, then the banning of image macros is banned.  Both can happen, and so can neither.

EVEX,359k4v,Tobl4,1 point,Sun May 10 03:23:39 2015 UTC,"Wanderlust is also of German origin, and unless you changed the meaning around too much, it means something a bit different. Literally translated it means ""hiking passion"" whereas Fernweh translates to ""far ache"".   The first difference is in the degree of urgency and the type of desire. Wanderlust is more of ""I want to and it would make me happy to do it"", whereas Fernweh is ""I need to and it aches me that I'm not doing it right now.""  The second difference is a bit bigger. Wanderlust includes ""hiking"", it is focused on the act of travelling itself, esp. if the method of travel is one that relies on your own muscles (autonomy -> self-worth). It is also very focused on exploring nature. Fernweh on the other hand comes from ""far"", the destination that you get to explore is far more important than the method of travel.  A several-days+ hiking trip in your own country can satisfy Wanderlust, but not Fernweh. A solo-trip to SE Asia where you then travel from city to city by train could satisfy Fernweh, but not Wanderlust (unless you are from SE Asia of course ^^).  Maybe Wanderlust in English now means the same as Fernweh, but then I'd wager you don't have any word for Wanderlust?"

Its not focused on any specific thing, it could be for the culture or the nature or the travel itself.  It also has a third sort of use, as essentially a personality trait. At least in fiction I've seen it used as an explanation for why a certain person won't settle down/have a family, they don't expect to ever lose their wanderlust, its seen in that situation as both their life's aspiration, and their personal curse. In reality I doubt it would ever be so severe but I think its still used in that sense, as a sort of trait.   Did the way I explained that make any sense?"

We usually use a literal interpretation of suggestions instead of the intent (as in the case of impeaching the president on the first day), so the rule should apply to links exclusively, as that was the wording of the suggestion.

EVEX,357v6r,Apiphilia,3,Thu May 7 23:00:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree with your assessment that /r/EVEX usually goes with rules-as-written rather than rules-as-intended. I absolutely wrote ""links"" in my suggestion and people tend to grumble about cross-posts due to karma. I think it would be nice to mark self-posts as cross-posts as well, but that was not in the original wording and it is much harder to police. With cross-posted links, there's the ""other discussions"" tab on RES that show where else the content has been posted recently, which makes policing the rule simpler. While I think a lot of people voted for the rule to prevent karma-whoring, I proposed it so I could find new subs through content I liked on /r/EVEX so it would be cool to find new subs by text-post as well.  TLDR: I think marking self posts as cross-posts would be useful, but it is not required by rules-as-written in my completly unofficial opoion"

EVEX,353ayn,Tobl4,8,Wed May 6 19:21:23 2015 UTC,"When I ran this by the mods, /u/Bossman1086 wondered why I included three rules/referendums instead of just linking to the wiki:    Showing the three (or similar amount) newest rules serves two purposes:   Existing members can easily see which rules were passed recently. It acts as a reminder and can get people up to date if they've been away for a week or two (e.g. vacation). It also means that you don't have to refresh /r/Evex constantly until you see the new vote results, you can just check them out in the sidebar and then follow the link to the announcement thread if you want to. People checking out the subreddit can easily see what kinds of rules were passed recently. This takes those people from ""some sort of sociology experiment"" to being able to understand what kind of feel and culture this subreddit has at the moment. The posts on the frontpage also help with that, but the rules are the core of this subreddit and they are what connects the frontpage to the original mission statement. For a quick demonstration, just hold your hand over the sidebar and look at the frontpage. Do you know what this sub is about?"
EVEX,353ayn,Forthwrong,7,Wed May 6 19:28:04 2015 UTC,"Absolutely support the idea/rationale. I just have a few suggestions that I think are rather minor in comparison:   I reckon putting the shown rules/referendums in chronological order would be more intuitive. At least, it certainly is for me. I understand the reasoning of putting them in order of recency—to put it in order of relevance—but I think we're more used to 1–2–3 than relevantest–relevantish–irrelevantest. Whilst the way the dates are written seems most compliant with the international standard, I think it's not idiot-proof and may be disorienting to people who aren't used to it. I propose D MMM YYYY (for example: 6 May 2015 or 27 Feb 2013) or MMM YYYY (for example: May 2015, Feb 2013), as it's unambiguous to all readers that know English (unlike most numeric formats). I think the position of Curator needn't be indicated on the sidebar. Lexicographers don't appear on the cover of most dictionaries because the dictionary's creation shouldn't interfere with its function, and I think a similar approach should be taken to the Library. (This is not to say that Curators should be invisible; information about Curatorship is in the Library [and should be expanded once there are more Curators], much like the lexicographers appear in the front matter of their dictionary.)  If you do think it should be included, it's spelt Curator."
EVEX,353ayn,Forthwrong,7,Wed May 6 21:20:04 2015 UTC,"You make some good points. A few answers:   THERE IS ANOTHER REASON FOR REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL. NOT ONLY PUTS IT THE MOST RELEVANT ONE FIRST, IT ALSO SUPPORTS THE MENTAL MODEL OF A STACK: NEW RULES ARE ADDED ON TOP, PUSHING OLDER RULES FURTHER DOWN UNTIL THEY DISAPPEAR INTO ""ALL"". THIS CONTINUITY MAKES IT MORE LIKELY THAT USERS FOLLOW THE LINK TO SEE THE REST OF THE RULES, A BEHAVIOUR THAT WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE. IF THEY WERE LISTED IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER, USERS WOULD END ON THE MOST RECENT RULE, GIVING THEM A FALSE SENSE OF HAVING FINISHED THE LIST, EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE ONLY SEEN THREE RULES. Yes, I decided to go with standard because of US vs rest of the world, though I can see your counterpoint. MMM YYYY would also be a good, nonambiguous format, maybe better than mine. Thanks for the spellcheck. IMO, THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF WORK ATTACHED TO THE ROLE OF CURATOR AND THEY SHOULD BE ACKNOWLEDGED PROPERLY. Then again, you do have some measure of authority on that matter.   That being said, this is exactly why I designed the referendum to be composed of guidelines, not a hardcoded format. We cannot alter referendums afterwards (though I corrected the spelling) , but this way the mods can include improvements from the comments or later alterations into the format."
EVEX,353ayn,Forthwrong,5,Wed May 6 21:49:25 2015 UTC,"I NOW SEE THE MERIT OF REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER OVER CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER, BUT BOTH OF THOSE ARE STILL INFERIOR TO THE DEWEY DECIMAL SYSTEM. THE DEWEY DECIMAL SYSTEM IS THE BEST SET OF NUMBERS AND ALL NUMBERS SHOULD COMPLY WITH—Okay so it turns out Library humour is really difficult.  I couldn't find a part of the wiki page about them that says referenda can't be modified after submission (though it's common sense that the spirit of the referendum shouldn't be fundamentally altered); what's your source for that?"
EVEX,353ayn,Calvin_,3,Wed May 6 22:17:39 2015 UTC,"Rules-wise, I think this is the case because referenda have to be approved beforehand and a modified version is not what has been approved.

EVEX,353ayn,UndauntedCouch,2,Wed May 6 22:30:38 2015 UTC,"THE INTENTION OF REFERENDUM APPROVAL, AS I UNDERSTAND IT, IS TO PREVENT REFERENDUMSPAM AND ENSURE IT IS IN LINE WITH THE RULES. IF THE SPIRIT OF THE REFERENDUM ISN'T AGAINST THE RULES, THOUGH, IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT CHANGING ONE DETAIL WITHOUT CHANGING THE SPIRIT OF THE REFERENDUM WILL CHANGE WHETHER THE REFERENDUM IS IN LINE WITH THE RULES.  BUT SINCE THE DECISION WAS FOR A LITERAL INTERPRETATION OF THE RULES, THE INTENTION OF REFERENDUM APPROVAL IS IRRELEVANT ANYWAY. REFERENDUM EDITING IS NOT MENTIONED IN THE WIKI, THEREFORE, I BELIEVE WE CANNOT DRAW ANY LOGICAL CONCLUSIONS FROM IT ABOUT WHETHER IT'S ALLOWED TO EDIT REFERENDA.  I AGREE THAT THE DEFINING CHARACTERISTICS OF A REFERENDUM SHOULDN'T BE ALTERED FOR MORAL REASONS, BUT HOW ABOUT NON-DEFINING PARTS? ALSO, WHAT IF THE CHANGES WOULD BE MADE LESS THAN TWO HOURS AFTER THE ORIGINAL POSTING OF IT, THEREBY ENSURING THAT THE MAJORITY OF VOTES OCCUR AFTER THE EDIT AND THAT MOST, IF NOT ALL, OF THOSE WHO ARE ACTIVE ENOUGH TO HAVE VOTED ON THE REFERENDUM WITHIN TWO HOURS OF ITS POSTING WOULD BE ABLE TO CHECK IT AGAIN AND POTENTIALLY MODIFY THEIR VOTES ACCORDINGLY?

Neither the initial suggestion for referendums, nor the post announcing that rule won, nor your wiki page about them specifically disallow edits.

Rule elaboration: Any posts or comments that are impolite towards another person or towards a group of people will be removed, and repeat offenders will be banned. This is an extension of Rule 8's ban on racism and, in a way, Rule 12's ban on SJW/MRA content. Content critical of a person/group is allowed; insults, stereotyping, and witch-hunting is not.   OK:   Many proponents for image macros fail to realize that image macros are a gateway to worse content.  The actions of extremist Islamist groups like ISIS are based on interpretation of the Quran, but ISIS atrocities do not represent mainstream Islam at all.  Communism is an inherently flawed ideology.   NOT OK:   Image macros? Go back to /r/adviceanimals you idiot.  All [group] are [some bad thing].  Communists are stupid.  Why are communists so ignorant?     Rule justification: While racist and sexist content is already banned, there is a lot of ground for someone to get away with general incivility. Religious and political bigotry are some examples. This rule fulfills the same goal that rules 8 and 12 achieves, except on a broader scale.  Resulting changes: This rule will promote civil commentary and a more civil subreddit. Constructive debate instead of insult-hurling will be encouraged. The subreddit culture will be one of respect towards one another and one another's opinions, not one of bigotry and disrespect.     Edit: Added clarifying cases."

RULE 12 CAN BE BADLY ENFORCED IF MODS REMOVE, FOR EXAMPLE, A LEGITIMATE STUDY ON AFFIRMATIVE ACTION JUST BECAUSE IT IS AN SJW TOPIC.  MANY RULES, NOT JUST THIS ONE, ARE ONLY AS GOOD AS THE MODS THAT ENFORCE THEM.

You have great facial expressions, and there are some humorous little nuances that are very effective, like the way you suddenly cut off the Rocky theme. Also, ""words words werds"" was fantastic.  I think the biggest thing holding the video back is its pacing. I like that you linger on shots -- coming timing is important --, but you could cut a lot of shots shorter. Like this one. It's over six seconds of nothing else but the protagonist starting straight ahead at the computer screen. Then, at this point, we see several consecutive shots of the protagonist not doing anything. You could save about eight or nine seconds of dead air if you just cut to the ""narrator"" suggesting to ""just start typing"".

What you saw here was the fire transferring heat energy to the (NH4)2Cr2O7, providing the activation energy to start what looked like a chain of reactions with something in the air, presumably O2 at the beginning. Does anyone have the chemical equation(s) for this?  Edit: italic text should be read as subscript"
EVEX,34xalb,elementsofevan,4,Tue May 5 16:24:47 2015 UTC,(NH4)2Cr2O7(s) = Cr2O3 + N2 + 4 H2O. It is an example of thermal decomposition not combustion. The energy from the fire was enough to cause a rearrangement of the molecular structure of the compound. So the energy is absorbed as a reactant and given off as a product. So I would say that it does indeed react with fire but is often just described as a product in an endothermic reaction.  Edit: There is a second reaction of  mercury thiocyanate. It is a multi step process which involves both decomposition and combustion but even still energy is a reactant in a technical sense

As a member of the EVEX Libertarian Party I don't believe in forcing the suggestion into voting as President, but I'd like to see it continue to be suggested by others until finally we may destroy the macros and bring peace to our community. I believe from what we've seen so far, Referendum 6 has upped participation in suggestion threads. We'll have to see if this increase in participation continues to know the lasting effects of the referendum. I can assure you, I was born on EVEX soil. I've shown my birth certificate to the mods multiple times, and I will even provide the community with the video of my birth here. Hopefully this puts the issue to rest.   -President Briizo"

Anyway, I couldn't get a phone back then, but now I'm looking into it, and now the M9 came out. I'm actually debating getting the M8 or M9- There don't seem to be a huge plethora of improvements, and the M8 is $150 cheaper new or $350 cheaper used/refurbished, so I'm not actually sure which one of the two I want."

""fue"" es para el pasado, la mayoria de la gente (al menos en el pais vasco) usa el presente si la accion ha sudcedido hace poco  Si te acabas de reir porque lo has encontrado gracioso, entonces dices ""eso es divertido"" o ""eso ha sido divertido""."

EVEX,34rpdy,Forthwrong,7,Mon May 4 00:01:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I'm most honoured to receive this privilege.  Within my message stating my interest in the position, I said I would ""firstly ensure that (at least) two other Curators are instated according to a mod decision."" As such, I'd like to fulfil this promise as soon as possible, as I believe the Library would be better curated with more Curators. If the moderation doesn't wish to select the other two Curators, I will select them based upon their advice.  I look forward to building, maintaining, and improving the Library!"
EVEX,34rpdy,Forthwrong,3,Mon May 4 00:13:30 2015 UTC,We can add other people to the wiki no problem. Let's see who's interested and what they would bring. I'd like to choose people that you feel you could work well with.
EVEX,34rpdy,Pillowish,3,Mon May 4 00:24:22 2015 UTC,"I think I could work well with people who share a similar vision; that is, people who would also be ""committed to the Library's free and neutral development as a resource for learning about the things that make /r/Evex what it is,"" to again quote my statement of interest.  I think a good comparison would be Wikipedia; in fact, Wikipedia's principles were what I consulted in search of an ideology according to which I thought the Library could thrive.  I think this is a fairly agreeable ideology based upon reason and good values, so I don't anticipate much tension within the duty of curation unless someone disagrees with the fundamental ideology."
EVEX,34rpdy,Forthwrong,3,Mon May 4 00:35:21 2015 UTC,"If you need any assistance, I can help you."
EVEX,34rpdy,briizo,2,Mon May 4 05:55:06 2015 UTC,Thanks for your support!  I sent you a PM a few hours ago about the Library; hopefully that hasn't gotten lost

EVEX,34rpdy,storyandsong,3,Mon May 4 01:24:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Since it is within your Presidential power, I look forward to potentially working with you to improve the Library!"

EVEX,34pacf,UndauntedCouch,3,Sun May 3 08:32:25 2015 UTC,If anyone hasn't played Talisman I recommend trying it. Some people don't like it because it relies a lot on die rolls and luck. I'd argue that there is still strategy and risk management but strategies should focus more on a region of the board to hang out in.
EVEX,34pacf,King_Pumpernickel,2,Sun May 3 08:43:10 2015 UTC,"Will throw my recommendation in there too, great game with equal amounts of luck and strategy."
EVEX,34pacf,buroppu,2,Sun May 3 15:38:19 2015 UTC,I had never heard of it so I did a quick search. It is a board game RPG as far as I understand? Can you tell me about it a bit? Is it possible to play it online somewhere? I may not be able to find the board game.
EVEX,34pacf,buroppu,2,Sun May 3 18:26:34 2015 UTC,Basically the goal is to get to the crown of command which is at the center of the board. You get there by traveling around the board and drawing cards that will either help you or hinder you while competing with other players that are trying to do the same thing. This guy made a pretty good series explaining it. You can play it online. I'd wait for a steam sale before buying the PC version though.
EVEX,34pacf,Betazerg_,2,Mon May 4 03:41:59 2015 UTC,Thank you that was very helpful.

EVEX,34k4vc,UndauntedCouch,3,Fri May 1 21:10:28 2015 UTC,What's an example of a referendum that is not explained?
EVEX,34k4vc,ocular_lift,2,Sat May 2 02:01:00 2015 UTC,"This seems to be in support of a literal rather than holistic interpretation of the rules.  I'd like to begin by quoting just one sentence from the terms of sale of a builders' merchant:   ""If and to the extent that any person by whom the Seller has been supplied with the goods supplied hereunder (hereinafter referred to as the Supplier') validly excludes restricts or limits his liability to the Seller in respect of the said goods or of any loss or damage arising in connection therewith the liability of the Seller to the Buyer in respect of the said goods or of any loss or damage arising in connection therewith shall be correspondingly excluded restricted or limited.""   I expect that the above sentence is incomprehensible to virtually all of you. I believe Evex rules/referendums should not be written in the language of the above sentence, primarily because I believe the rules by which we use Evex should be clear and understandable to an average user. I have a few reasons for this:  1) The ultra-precise language of (for example) the sentence above is pretentious, unwelcoming, and confusing to the average user. I hope it's self-evident enough that our rules should not be written pretentiously, unwelcomingly, or confusingly.  2) The average user should not feel like the procedures of Evex are on a different level than that of common material. I hope that the recent dip in participation stands as evidence that the governance of Evex needs participation, and keeping the governance's language simple would encourage people to get more involved in Evex, which is exactly what we need.  3) The average user should know when something is against the rules and when it isn't. The above sentence may be written to sound clear, but it's anything but clear to us. I believe that the rules of Evex should be clear. It may seem intuitive that enforcing a literal interpretation would make the rules clearer, but I believe that relying on a literal interpretation is more dangerous than relying on intention.  The very reason legalese exists is for high precision within a very specific group. We can't afford that, because the Evex community is an inherently ambiguous group. It's often possible to construe an English sentence as meaning something different from what was intended, so using standard English would often be an inherently flawed way of trying to communicate a precise point. In other words, the English that we must use in Evex is not precise enough for the purposes of governance.  The obvious solution is to rely on the intention, and I'm in favour of mandatory specification of the intention of a referendum in the same way that I proposed the mandatory specification of the intention of the rules. However, this referendum does not accomplish that. The Standard Format that was inspired by my suggestion failed to include ""intention"" within it, and this referendum only includes ""intent"" within one example; it does not mandate intent. In this respect, I believe this referendum is just as flawed as the repealed Standard Format was flawed.  The inherent problem within relying on the intention is that the intention is often ambiguous when it isn't stated. But making it mandatory to include the intention of a referendum as a part of it would make most intentions clear to understand, and for those that it doesn't provide enough clarity to, there's always room for questions and discussions by the average people about it.  It should also be noted that the extra discussion created by the ambiguity of the intentions would not be excessive (because most people are adept at writing clearly) and would indeed be helpful to this sub, as it would not only promote healthy discussions, but would also show how welcoming the governance of Evex is.  Therefore, whilst I entirely agree with what I think is the intention of this referendum (to make Evex better and clearer), I have serious doubts about whether this is the right way of accomplishing that."
EVEX,34k4vc,Forthwrong,3,Fri May 1 22:01:58 2015 UTC,"WELL, I PERSONALLY SUPPORT MORE LITERAL INTERPRETATIONS RULES. I DON'T THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD READ OR UPVOTE ANYTHING WORDED LIKE YOUR EXAMPLE. (UNLESS THEY DO IT AS A JOKE OR TO MAKE A POINT.) RIGHT NOW RULES ARE TAKEN LITERALLY. THIS WOULD FORCE THE PERSON MAKING THE REFERENDUM TRY AND EXPLAIN WHAT THEY WANT IT TO DO AND ENFORCE IT THAT WAY. IF PEOPLE START TO USE LONG WINDED LEGALESE THAT'S UP EVEX TO ACCEPT. I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE THIS REFERENDUM TOO RESTRICTIVE BECAUSE OF THE ALL THE HATE TOWARDS  REFERENDUM 2. SORRY ABOUT THE YELLING, I'M ONLY DOING IT BECAUSE OF RULE SEVEN :P"
EVEX,34k4vc,Forthwrong,2,Fri May 1 23:25:20 2015 UTC,THE SENTENCE IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE DANGER OF USING A LITERAL INTERPRETATION OF RULES; USING A LITERAL INTERPRETATION WILL REQUIRE US TO GET ON THE TREADMILL OF USING MORE AND MORE PRECISE LANGUAGE UNTIL WE'RE SPEAKING LEGALESE.  THIS REFERENDUM IS SIMILAR TO REFERENDUM 2 IN THAT IT DOESN'T MANDATE THE INCLUSION OF AN INTENTION WHILST MANDATING OTHER THINGS THAT ARE RATHER IRRELEVANT IN THE SCOPE OF THINGS. THIS REFERENDUM WOULD NOT MAKE REFERENDA ANY CLEARER; IT WOULD JUST MANDATE MORE STUFF BE PUT IN THEM.
EVEX,34k4vc,Spitalian,2,Fri May 1 23:33:11 2015 UTC,I REALLY DON'T THINK PEOPLE WOULD START USING LEGALESE IF REFERENDUMS ARE MEANT TO BE TAKEN LITERALLY. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE IN LEGALESE TO BE MOSTLY UNAMBIGUOUS. AND MOST PEOPLE HERE PROBABLY DON'T KNOW HOW TO WRITE IN LEGALESE.
EVEX,34k4vc,Forthwrong,1 point,Sat May 2 02:47:02 2015 UTC,"I DON'T EXPECT THAT THIS SUB WOULD EVER GET TO LEGALESE, BUT I USE LEGALESE AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT LIES DOWN THE PATH OF USING AN OVERLITERAL INTERPRETATION; JUST BECAUSE WE WON'T GET THAT FAR DOESN'T MEAN THE PATH ISN'T IN A BAD DIRECTION.  BEING MOSTLY UNAMBIGUOUS IS NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE A RULE BULLETPROOF IN THE SAME WAY THAT BASING IT UPON THE INTENTION IS; AS LONG AS ONE LOOPHOLE WITHIN THE WORDING EXISTS, THE RULE IS WORSE OFF THAN HOW IT COULD BE IF IT WERE BASED UPON INTENTION.  FURTHERMORE, IF THERE WILL BE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT A RULE MEANS, I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE EASIER, MORE ENTERTAINING, AND OTHERWISE BETTER TO DISCUSS WHAT THE SPIRIT BEHIND A RULE IS RATHER THAN WHAT A GRAMMATICAL CONSTRUCTION FORMING THE RULE MEANS."

As in, this referendum applies to the next president instead of me? ;) If the answer to the first question is no, does the referendum need a simple majority to pass like the other referenda, or is it counted as an impeachment referendum, meaning it needs to get 64% of the vote to pass?

EVEX,34hm32,holomanga,4,Fri May 1 06:25:12 2015 UTC,"Alright so /u/kuilin talked it over. This is what we're going to do.  Referendums are going to be enforced as they're written. We don't want to be making judgement calls on every single referendum unless we have to.   As such, /u/briizo's first day in office is today. The referendum won't go into effect until Monday if it passes so it won't affect him. It needs only a simple majority to pass since it's a referendum and not an actual impeachment. If it passes, it will become a permanent referendum and affect any Presidents elected after /u/briizo leaves office. Basically when a new President is elected, an impeachment vote will automatically go up on their first day (per the Presidential referendum) which will need the 64% to pass and be successful.  If the community wants us to be focusing on the intent of Referendums instead of how they're written, that should be a referendum itself. But the whole idea of this subreddit experiment is to keep things free from mod interpretation. The best way to do that is to go by how things are written and use logic to see any conflicts or tie-ins to other referendums/rules."

Because if something like that were to be happening and you essentially outlawed jokes you might have just straight up killed the sub.  You took a referendum (the second most popular one ever) that was meant to be a funny one time gag, and pretty clearly meant to be a one time gag, and turned it into something that will suffocate the subreddit, and spam the subreddit with useless votes. Good work.  Edit: also, why are content rules open to interpretation but not referendums? For example, my suggestion ""This is the weekly spoiler tag suggestion."" made the vote. Is the way that it is bring presented now not mod interpretation? If we are gonna make this /r/LawSchool, let's be consistent. I'll be sure all my suggestions have at least 600 words from now on so that nothing is unclear, because if this applies to referendums, surely it applies to content rules as well."
EVEX,34hm32,EVEXtheDESTROYER,8,Fri May 1 17:08:34 2015 UTC,"I agree it's frustrating and I was expecting the opposite outcome here. I think we should go based on the intent rather than word.

EVEX,34hm32,Pillowish,3,Fri May 1 19:23:44 2015 UTC,"I'd be interested in helping you write that referendum, and I'm sure plenty others would also be interested. Perhaps a discussion thread before a referendum thread to tie up the loose ends would be in order?"
EVEX,34hm32,Pillowish,3,Fri May 1 20:08:10 2015 UTC,Yeah that definitely sounds like a good idea. On Monday I'll make a post so we can get a draft made :)
EVEX,34hm32,Brosedian,1 point,Fri May 1 20:32:59 2015 UTC,"Referendums have always been about procedure. A procedure isn't a one time thing. Every other referendum and rule has been taken literally and it hasn't killed anything. We took it as it was written and will continue to do so.  If you think it's an issue, you're welcome to come up with a referendum that will create a way to clarify Referendums under these kinds of circumstances (maybe Referendum addendums or something similar that can change the wording of referendums with community feedback).  We had referendums that didn't work out in the past and the community banded together to fix the issues with another referendum. The same thing can happen here. And that's literally the entire point of this subreddit - to be an experiment in what happens with community voting. If people didn't want this stuff to go through and be taken as written then jokes shouldn't be submitted as official referendums.  EDIT to address your edit: Rules will be taken literally as possible. If you type out 100 words explaining how said rule would be enforced and it wins, that's how it will be enforced. If it's left vague, then yes...we're required to interpret it because there's literally no context to pull from. There's no avoiding that. But using your weekly spoiler tag suggestion as an example, we'd enforce that based on previous suggestions of said rule that were more detailed because people voted for those in the past and likely expected it to be the same when voting for it this week. However, if you had worded the rule differently in a way that went against what people voted for last time, we wouldn't enforce it the way people expected last time because that's not what the rule says.  Also, per the sub's initial rules, if a rule/suggestion/referendum is too complex to enforce, can't be enforced, interferes with the normal operation of the subreddit, or goes against reddit site rules, it will be skipped over and not put on a ballot."

As a base molecule, the only difference is a functional group (well, two, but it's the same one). Morphine has an alkyl group (OH), which is soluble in the blood stream, while in heroin the oxygen is bound to groups (OCOCH3) which are insoluble in the blood. Thus, heroin can more easily traverse the blood-brain barrier, allowing higher concentrations of the drug to reach the brain.  The thing is (and this is where I may be slightly wrong on the details, but the idea is the same), once heroin reaches the brain a protein converts it into morphine. So essentially, the brain will receive the same molecule no matter what, but heroin is in a much higher concentration."

EVEX,348pkf,BananaDependency,4,Wed Apr 29 04:36:51 2015 UTC,"I think that in a direct democracy, which we have here, political parties are much less detrimental than in a representative democracy.  We're still all voting on each issue individually, rather than electing representatives to vote for us.  This allows us to express our views on an issue by issue basis rather than voting for a large block of views espoused by one party.  The advantage of parties is in the presidential vote in helping people to unify around a candidate that they support.  With an approval voting system, we don't need to worry about collapsing into a two party system like we would with FPTP, so I think a rise in political parties would be a good thing."

EVEX,3472pc,kuilin,11,Tue Apr 28 20:37:49 2015 UTC,"I think this is quite an interesting question; while you're absolutely correct about the exact wording parts, I think the intention behind the referendum is pretty unambiguous despite being worded ineffectively.  That leads me to thinking: should Evex favour the intention of the law or the letter of the law?  I'd like to say that I favour preferring the intention over the exact wording, because favouring exact wording has the danger of necessitating a precise message in a language rather removed from the common, plainer and simpler language we use on a daily basis.  I believe that the government and the common material of /r/Evex should remain on the same level in as many ways as possible—especially language. To that extent, it's imperative that /r/Evex discourages the development of a legalese jargon (which would be used to make the law less prone to loopholes or misinterpretations resulting from an overly literal interpretation of the rules), and favouring the intention of the rule over the exact wording of it is a simple way of accomplishing this.  This is not to say that it's easier to favour the intention—it often isn't, and this is a big flaw in favouring intention. The intention is usually subject to more interpretation, and this would require more discussion about what the intention is. However, I think that more discussion would be helpful for this sub; not only would it afford us more to talk about, it would also make it easier for an average person to get involved in the governance of Evex beyond simply voting.  So, I think favouring the intention would discourage overly literal language over plain and common language, and thereby keep the common populace and the Referendum's family on the same page, and even encourage people to get more involved in /r/Evex."
EVEX,3472pc,Forthwrong,5,Tue Apr 28 22:19:12 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with going by the intent. Not only does that prevent the rules and referendums from devolving (heh) into legalese, it also prevents mistakes in rules.  With the risk of going too much into US politics, I remember a recent case (although I forget who exactly were involved and what law it was) where a congressman not only meant something, but came out and said many times what his intent was in a certain law, yet when it came to the supreme court, some justices completely ignored what the man intended and only ruled on the exact lettering of the law. That is something I never want to happen anywhere, including in EVEX."
EVEX,3472pc,TheAppleBOOM,5,Tue Apr 28 23:48:21 2015 UTC,"I fully agree. If we can't use the intent of the law, then we're nothing but a bureaucracy.  I think that they should just be impeached as soon as this referendum goes into effect."
EVEX,3472pc,nospr2,5,Wed Apr 29 14:38:03 2015 UTC,"What would you be charging them with? To impeach somebody does not mean throw them out of office, so it would not be an infinite loop of presidents. It means the president gets accused of misconduct on the first day of office. Unless there is also a system in place to try and punish the president, he would stay in office."
EVEX,3472pc,wonderloss,4,Wed Apr 29 13:47:59 2015 UTC,"They'd just be charged with being a President on the first day of their term, since that's what the text of the referendum says to be considered grounds for impeachment."

The referendum is treated as a regular referendum. The vote must achieve a super-majority vote of 64% for the President to be removed from office. If a President is successfully removed from office or resigns an emergency election will be held immediately with the first round of voting beginning the next available weekend where voting has not already been set.

EVEX,344ed0,TheAppleBOOM,7,Tue Apr 28 05:17:57 2015 UTC,"I think it's frustrating that the looters are actively working against the cause of the majority of the protesters.  The black men who have died unjustly recently, have died in part because of a stereotype that all/most black men are criminals.  So for black men to use a very public protest to commit crimes is extremely counterproductive to the cause of the majority of the protesters because it reinforces exactly the stereotype that is one of the largest problems in this issue."
EVEX,344ed0,LeinadSpoon,6,Tue Apr 28 12:57:02 2015 UTC,"There's an interesting MLK quote going around about this. (paraphrasing) ""riots are the voices of the unheard""  I think I can agree with that. When you subjugate a group of people for decades (or centuries if you include slavery), you cannot be surprised when there is a violent backlash."
EVEX,344ed0,LeinadSpoon,3,Tue Apr 28 17:40:42 2015 UTC,"That's certainly valid.  I looked up the full quote from Dr King, and I think that the point he's making is very solid.   I will agree that there is a group in the Negro community advocating violence now. I happen to feel that this group represents a numerical minority. Surveys have revealed this. The vast majority of Negroes still feel that the best way to deal with the dilemma that we face in this country is through non-violent resistance, and I don't think this vocal group will be able to make a real dent in the Negro community in terms of swaying 22 million Negroes to this particular point of view. And I contend that the cry of ""black power"" is, at bottom, a reaction to the reluctance of white power to make the kind of changes necessary to make justice a reality for the Negro. I think that we've got to see that a riot is the language of the unheard. And, what is it that America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the economic plight of the Negro poor has worsened over the last few years.   I read him as saying the desire for violence is a natural response from the conditions and that the fact that violence is occurring should be viewed as evidence that the conditions are bad.  But, he does not think that violence is a winning strategy to actually change the racism in the government and culture.  I agree with that assessment.  The violence may be natural and expected, but that doesn't mean it is productively furthering the extremely important cause being advocated by the majority of the protesters."

EVEX,34012i,nospr2,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:34:45 2015 UTC,You could just screenshot a word file or google drive file with the rules... so just copying and pasting the new rule.
EVEX,34012i,Forthwrong,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:37:32 2015 UTC,I already created one for the rules. Not the referendums and candidates though. :/ Although feel free to reformat it to whatever you like /u/Bossman1086.
EVEX,34012i,teamvista,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:08:21 2015 UTC,A history page is great for preservation of things because we want to keep track of voting history and such. But a rules wiki page should be separate so we can link directly to it in the sidebar and people can read it quickly and understand the rules without the history lesson too.
EVEX,34012i,Forthwrong,1 point,Wed Apr 29 04:19:52 2015 UTC,So guys. We've reached the size limit for the sidebar. We're going to have to get a Wiki Page set up or something because we're unable to add new rules and referendums to the sidebar after this week (there's a hard character limit reddit enforces).   Would it be possible to add an :after element and extend that list indefinitely?
EVEX,34012i,teamvista,1 point,Mon Apr 27 11:50:33 2015 UTC,"I'd rather not be editing the CSS every week, to be honest. And after a few more weeks, that sidebar is going to get really excessive anyway. It's probably better to do a Wiki page and link to it from the sidebar. Most subs with a lot of sidebar content do this already anyways."
EVEX,34012i,Cryzgnik,2,Mon Apr 27 13:06:06 2015 UTC,"that sidebar is going to get really excessive anyway.    I mean, we could also make it dropdown on hover. There are a number of great magicians on reddit who tame the demon that is CSS. Just reserve a solitary mod for the job. Hell we could probably automate it with a bot. Like message the bot with a string to add to the CSS at x line. Excuse me I have some experimenting to do!"

I believe that leaving primarily because a few unfavoured rules were passed is an irrational reason potentially based on impulsive feelings. Many old rules become forgotten over time; it's entirely likely that the new rule will be a short-lived fad.  What /r/Evex needs the most of lately is participation, and if people leave because they don't like the direction, /r/Evex can only get worse.  I myself have considered whether it would be worthwhile to leave Evex because of the direction it's heading. But, coupled with the effects of low participation of late, which is quite possibly only a transient phenomenon, I decided not to be taken aback by something I personally didn't favour and I decided not to base my decision on a short-term reaction, and I implore you to do the same."

BECAUSE OF THAT, I THINK IT'S A NON SEQUITUR TO SAY IT'S GONE OFF TRACK.  PERHAPS SOME PEOPLE'VE HAD THE IDEA THAT /R/EVEX WOULD EVOLVE FROM A GENERAL-INTEREST SUB TO A MORE NICHE SUB, BUT THAT NEEDN'T BE HOW IT PROGRESSES. EVEX IS STILL ENTERTAINING TO MUCH OF ITS AUDIENCE. AND IF IT STOPS BEING APPEALING TO ITS AUDIENCE, US, THE SUB IS IN OUR HANDS IN A RATHER DIRECT WAY.  FURHTERMORE, THE ENVIRONMENT OF /R/EVEX ISN'T ONLY ITS CONTENT. A LOT OF THIS SUB'S CULTURE IS FOUNDED UPON THE PROCEDURES OF EVEX, AND I DON'T THINK THIS IS BAD THING; IT ESTABLISHES A MORE DISTINCT CULTURE.

The content bans do not restrict the scope of EVEX.   BY THE WAY, TO ADDRESS THE OP, I LIKE THIS SUB'S PATH. CONTRARY TO WHAT HE STATES, I BELIEVE THAT AN UNNECESSARILY RESTRICTION OF ALLOWED CONTENT/TOPICS ON THIS SUB (I.E. RESTRICTIONS THAT DO NOT IMPROVE THE QUALITY, ORIGINALITY, CIVILITY, OR ACTIVITY OF /r/EVEX). THERE'S A SUBREDDIT FOR ESSENTIALLY EVERY TOPIC ANYWAY, SO WHY DRIVE AWAY A LARGE SECTION OF SUBSCRIBERS IN FAVOR OF MAKING THIS SUB SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY AVAILABLE ANYWAY?

Every week I look through the last week's posts and try to think of something to suggest as a rule but there are never really any problems.   Of course the highest rated posts on most subreddits, including this one, are pictures and gifs because they're the most easily digestible and universally appealing types of content, but just because that's the case I don't see how it could get to the point where we'd only be left with pictures and gifs because, as I previously said, there are too many people who like other types of content, and the people who do like pics most probably don't feel strongly enough to ban all other content.  I think in the future we'll do more preemptive rules to get rid of things which are almost universally disliked (ie racism, MLP, clickbait) before that runs dry, then just continue to make the subreddit more and more convoluted and unique with government positions, banned  words, and in-jokes which- in my opinion- don't really add anything. But that's democracy.  TL;DR: Subreddit's content is pretty universally okay, so not much will drastically change even if it's not perfect. We will however do more preemptive bans and quirky additions."

Justification: This would encourage creatively to see what posts or comments people would try to say without including the word in question.

She doesn't respond with anything meaningful for a reason and she's not interested in you. Who am I? The man whom she is in love with. She already told me not to worry, she's not interested in you. Sorry I bothered you kid. I've dated her since 2 summers ago. If you aren't trying to get at my woman or being inappropriate I don't care if you snap her occasionally. Just don't try anything man. You'll embarrass yourself and anger me. We are in love and we're making love tomorrow. So if you have any ill intentions with my woman you can forget it right now. I'm the biggest and best she's ever had, only man she's ever loved and the only man who could truly satisfy her physically. You will never have her. And she loves me. I don't have any problems with you if you are over my woman and realize you will never be with or touch her again. I apologize for coming off as a dick, just me and kenna are really deep in love and we've been through a lot and I just moved back home and it makes me a little jealous and angry to see a man she used to date before me is snap chatting her.... We don't need any extra bullshit or drama right now, so don't bring us any please is all I ask friend. If you try to talk to her any way but as a brother, or you try to see her at all, if she tells me you do anything inappropriate or anything outside of what a strict brother like friend would do,we are going to have a huge problem. I will leave you alone now dude if you're not trying to get at the woman who I love and whom is in love with me. That entire summer she was with me. She left kyle for me. She's been with me ever since, she even loved me and made love to me before she EVER let anything happen with you. You didn't please her. She didn't have strong feelings for you at all. And she immediately ended shit with you for me once she knew I loved her too. So get any ideas of the past out of your head. None of this truth should bug you if you're over her but I'm just making sure. I hate when my baby's friends have ill intentions and she thinks they are just friends and have no alternative motive. But idk if I trust you at all. If I can trust you to not stress me and my baby or fuck with our love tell me. I will leave you alone and apologize. But if you aren't over her and you're tryna ""get some"" or you're tryna get back in her life, it's NOT HAPPENING. She said you were nothing to her, and the sex was bad anyway haha. You're small and weak and she said it all felt wrong after being with me. She's been with me ever since. We're in love. And tomorrow me and her will be together in my room making love alll day how we always have together. If you have a problem speak up like a man or tell me our love doesn't bug you and I'll apologize, it's simple. So??? What is it? You are after my woman then huh?! Tell me the fucking truth man. Don't you dare be disrespectful and gross enough to bring it up, but if if you ask her about anything she shared with me about your weak ass, she may be nice and lie to you, or she may not care and tell you the truth. Either way. I'm her soullmate and her boyfriend of the past two years almost. And she tells me everything and NEVER lies to me. I don't care haha. Just stay away from my kenna. I sincerely apologize if you have no ill intentions and aren't trying to make moves with my woman. And i respect you as a guy in the service. I'm sure you're an ok dude. But just as a friend. You're nothing to my kenna but a brother like friend. I just wanna be sure you know it and don't forget it. Find a nice classy woman where you are stationed, marry her.... But back off of mine. You will never even compare to me in her eyes. Not even close haha.I just don't need you interfering with me and kenna's love. It's our lives man. It's really not cool.... Goodbye man, good luck. Respect to you being in the service. Sorry to bring your day down with my crazy bullshit but. Me and kenna are head over heels.... I can't help but be crazy about her. I love her with all of my heart and I will protect her from her untrustworthy fake friends. Not saying you are one. But you're dodging telling me what's going on in your head so I'm questioning a lot right now. Just know I'm never gonna hurt her, I'm always going to have her back, I'd give my life for her without hesitation, and I will protect her from anything, everything, and anyone. She is the love of my life. I fully intend to marry and give kenna my children. And we've talked a lot about it. Just don't make shit harder than it already is. I just moved back and me and her miss eachother so badly and we are FINALLY go to see eachother tomorrow and make love for the first time since halloween.... I hope you don't hate me man. I'm a good dude. Just protective of the woman who holds my heart. And who's heart I hold and must protect. I hope you can understand. She promised me there's nothing at all to worry about with you and that she's not interested:""/ I wish I knew before I embarrassingly went off on you. I'm so sorry man. I'm sorry. Please don't mention this to my baby:/ I'm really embarrassed and while she will understand, I just feel like an ass for attacking you when you have nothing with my kenna and no intention to. Good bye brother. I hope you find your one true love someday. It'll make you crazy, trust me, but you'll find her one day. I found mine when I was really young. And it's my kenna :)"

EVEX,33fvg6,briizo,39,Wed Apr 22 04:34:12 2015 UTC,"Briizo for President of Evex  Hey guys, my name is Briizo. You might know me as the ""weather reports guy"" or one of the guys trying to get rid of image macros every week (and I would have gotten those pesky memes this week, if it weren't for you meddling kids!)   Now I'm running to be your first President of /r/EVEX!    I've already talked a lot about my platform, and I answered a bunch of questions in this thread.  But in case you don't feel like going over there to read it all, here is what my presidency would look like:   Summary: Non-interventionist presidency. Evex is awesome as the laissez faire system it is right now, so I believe the President should only act to guide the community. Not to force his or her own ideas down your throats with stickied posts or rule suggestions. Stickying Posts: As President, I will not sticky anything other than the suggestion and voting threads that are stickied now. The last thing I want is to spam the subreddit with stickies and draw attention away from the threads that make this subreddit what it is! Rules/Referendums: As President, I will not add any of my own rules or referendums to the ballot. I don't believe it's fair to this community to bypass the rule suggestions thread because of some dumb title. The only reasons I would ever add something is if a proposed referendum narrowly misses the threshold to go to vote. My Activity: I'm on Evex more than I probably should be, haha. Multiple times a day, if I don't just have a tab running in the background. I am active in the community now (with suggestions and posts), and as President I'd be willing to help manage the wiki and help the curator run our library should they ask me to.   What Evex needs isn't change, it's stability.  And I am happy to provide that. So in conclusion, I'll allow my greatest inspiration to do the talking for me. Vote Briizo as the first President of Evex!"
EVEX,33fvg6,Pillowish,4,Wed Apr 22 07:12:26 2015 UTC,"Can you also show the subscriber count and number of views of /r/EVEX like once a week?(Once a month if that is too much)  Other than that, I voting for ya. I like your passion."
EVEX,33fvg6,Calijor,4,Thu Apr 23 08:47:09 2015 UTC,"Add a referendum if it narrowly misses the threshhold    If you agree with it I presume? I feel like that's a particularly sore point to me, you should probably just adopt a regular procedure for that or simply lower the threshhold.   Also, you say you don't want to do much but our activity seems to be dropping, shouldn't we try something to encourage greater participation?"
EVEX,33fvg6,briizo,7,Wed Apr 22 09:53:05 2015 UTC,"Well I honestly don't think a President will be able to do much to raise participation in the subreddit. They can, however, decrease participation pretty easily. They can drop participation by stickying more threads (making suggestion/vote threads lose visibility), and they can drop participation by sticking their own rules into every single vote (circumventing the system we have in place will make people frustrated with the system). For these reasons, I think that the best way to continue participation in /r/evex is for the President to change nothing and to do as little as possible to disturb the suggestions and stickying processes.  To address your question about adding referendums, I won't necessarily need to agree with referendums to take them to vote. If a referendum misses the 50 vote threshold by 3 or 4 votes, I still think it deserves a chance to go to vote (Though I think this would be a pretty rare circumstance). If my idea of adding referendums suggested by other people that just barely missed the mark is a sore point for you, I can't imagine how you feel about all the other candidates proposing to add their own rules and referendums to every vote. Even if you disagree with my idea of how to handle these referendums, surely you'd agree I'm being less authoritative than every single other candidate in the running right now.  But if you aren't happy with the current referendum system or vote threshold, suggest a change to it! But I don't think it should be up to the President to disrupt the system in place.  I'd be happy to answer any more questions you have here :)"
EVEX,33fvg6,Calijor,2,Wed Apr 22 18:13:41 2015 UTC,"Sounds fair, my whole point about adding referendums barely missing the threshhold is that sort of defeats the point of the threshhold with a ""how close is close enough"" conundrum."

Under my rule I would like to further the scope of EVEX with polices to help increase the number of posts, comments, and overall l discussion.  I'll do my best to sway us away from rules that would destroy the sub such as ""ban the letter T"", while ensuring we actually get rules that ban certain content to keep true to EVEX's beginning.  I'll always ensure the mods are treated with respect and try to curb rules that give them unnecessary work. A happy mod is a good and fair mod.  And finally I would like the people to speak. I would never want to prevent a serious rule when the people want it nor prevent a funny rule when the good people need a joke.  Vote for NOSPR2, thank you."
EVEX,33fvg6,alien122,9,Wed Apr 22 17:03:52 2015 UTC,"ALIEN122 FOR PRESIDENT  A vote for alien122 is a vote for the stars!   Goals: My aim as president is to lay the foundation for all presidents to come so that the power of evex shall remain in the hand of the subscribers. Evex is made my the subscribers and should be run by them too. A noninterventionist policy may sound enticing, but how do you ensure that presidents afterwards will hold the same honor and rigor? For that reason I will not exactly be noninterventionist, however I will not intervene too much and impose my ideology on the subscribers. In conclusion I will aim to set the rules and limits on the presidency such that although they have some power, they cannot supersede the will of the subscribers.  My second goal is to promote the evolution of evex into a great subreddit. As we've seen in recent posts the number of suggestions has been waning off. I will work to promote people to suggest more and introduce rules or repeal rules as necessary to promote participation. Conduct as president: A president should not be someone who brings their ideas and imposes it on the community. But rather a person who lifts the community's ideas and brings them to fruition. As such I will mainly act how to community would like. I will not act unilaterally. I will not make decisions or actions for my amusement at the expense of the subscribers. Instead I will hope that I can work with all of you to bring the ideas you have and implement them into EVEX. History on Evex: I've been on Evex straight from the humble beginngs. When it was just born out of a theoryofreddit post. When bossman made the first suggestion. I was in the first 100 subscribers. So be rest assured, I'm not someone from outside trying to turn the sub into my own personal thing. I would honestly like to see evex grow. It fills a niche that the defaults just can't hope to do. Kind of like /r/reddit.com. I really really wish to help Evex and not just in its evolution.   Foundations are everything and we cannot hope that every president after a ""good"" one will also be good. We need to lay the rules down on the presidency now before someone does come and take more power than they should.  Your voice is my voice. Your ideas are my ideas. I am with you, I ask of you to be with me.  A vote for alien122 is a vote for the stars!"

EVEX,33fvg6,MrGobelsack,0,Wed Apr 22 20:12:14 2015 UTC,What issue would you have with stickying the election thread for the next president say ten days before the end of term?
EVEX,33fvg6,LaughRiot68,2,Wed Apr 22 20:21:08 2015 UTC,"If the presidential election didn't coincide with a rule vote, I'd have no problem with it. But I don't think we should ever be prioritizing threads over suggestion and voting threads; as those are the backbone of the subreddit I think they need the most attention.  Look at this thread, for example. It has gained plenty of traction without being stickied. It basically has the same number of upvotes as the stickied suggestion thread at the moment, and has even more comments. Important threads like this one won't go unnoticed by the community if they aren't stickied, but suggestion and rule threads would see a noticeable drop off in participation if they weren't stickied to the top of the subreddit."

Ignoring 4 Corner Earth Days  will Destroy Evil Humanity.  I am organizing Children to  join ""Cubic Army of 4 Days""  to convert Evil 1 Day Adults  to 4 Day mentality existence,  to serve perpetual humanity.  ""Nothing on Earth more Evil  than a human educated as 1,  when composed of opposites  that cancel out as an entity.""  In fact, man is the only 1 Evil,  and will soon erase himself by  ignoring Cubic 4 Day Creation.  If a Man cannot tear a page  from the bible and burn it -  then he cannot be a scientist,  or participate in Symposium -  to measure Cubing of Earth  with Cubic intelligence wiser  than any man or god known.  Educators have destroyed the  human analytical brain to a  single perspective, in spite of  all creation within  Universe  being based upon opposites,  binaries & antipodes, including  Sun/Earth binary relative to the  human male/female binary. No   ancient insignificant dead 1 Jew   godism can match or exceed the  enormity of the Sun/Earth  Binary. His heart is not big  enough for sharing with the  vastness of created opposites.  1 has no heart beat or breath,  constituting death of opposites.  God in Human form has human  limits as body controls activity.  You are taught Evil, You act  Evil, You are the Evil on Earth.  Only your comprehending the  Divinity of Cubic Creation will  your soul be saved from your  created hell on Earth - induced  by your ignoring the existing  4 corner harmonic simultaneous   4 Days rotating in a single cycle  of the Earth sphere. Religious/  Academic Pedants cannot allow  4 Days that contradict 1Day 1God.  Educators destroy your brain,  but you don't know, so why care?  Creation ocurrs via opposites,  but Religious/Academia pedants  suppress it teaching Satanic One.  After 30 years of research, I now  possess the Order of Harmonic  Antipodal Cubic Divinity Life -  too large for physical form, but  Binary Spirit of the masculinity  Sun & feminity Earth Antipodes.  ONEism is demonic Death Math.  I have so much to teach you, but  you ignore me you evil asses.  You will recognize 4 corner Days  or incur Easter Island Ending.  Never a Genius knew Math  to achieve my Cubic Wisdom.  Cubic thought Reigns as the  Highest Intelligence possible  on the planet Earth. One 96  hour rotating Cube within a  single rotation of Earth -- is  an Ineffable Transcendence.  Bible and Science falsify 1  corner day for the Cubic 4  corner Days rotating daily.  A single god is not possible  in our 4 Day Cubic Science,  that equates Cubic Divinity.  Everybody is both stupid and  evil for ignoring the 4 days.  Cube Divinity transcends all  knowledge, Humans can't  escape 4 corner Cubic Life.  Fools worship mechanics of  language - while they wallow  in fictitious & deceitful word.  Exact science based on Cubics,  not on theories. Wisdom is  Cubic testing of knowledge.  Academia is progression of  Ignorance.   No god equals  Simultaneous 4 Day Creation.  Humans ignore their 4 corner  stages of life metamorphosis.  This site is a collection of data  for a coming book - peruse it.  No human has 2 hands as they  are opposites, like plus and  minus, that cancel as entity.  Academia destroys your brain,  your ability to think opposite.  The eyes of the flounder fish  were relocated, why were yours  relocated? Your opposite eyes  were moved to 1 corner to overlay  for single perspective, but that  corrupts your Opposite Brain."

Hey - got a death threat  from Temporal Phoenix  last night, saying that the  big ole boys that make the  world go round, are going  to wipe me off the Earth.  They can't allow the Time  Cube Principle to continue.  Opposites Create, not God,  who equates queer creator  and masturbation creation  of Evil Oneness Educators.  Oneism equates to evil lie,  and Death for Opposites  of Hemispheres and Sexes.  Wikipedia claim that the  Time Cube is non-science  constitutes a Grave error  by the half-brain bastard  who can't think opposite  of the lies he was taught.  I was born to think Cubic  as in a 4 corner family life,  therefore I rise above you.  You are educated Stupid,  You are educated Evil ---  You will ignore message  & attack the messenger.  Man invented his God in  man's character - Stupid  Oneism and Singularity  in Universe of Opposites.  You worship an evil god  who allows babies to starve  to death while you gorge? God BELIEF succumbs to  The Cubic Law of Nature.  Opposite sex organs prove  male & female to be binary  opposites equal zero value,  and nothing as unified one.  You are educated ENTITY  STUPID for all Creation is  composed of Opposites ----  which equate to Zero value  existence - and cancels out  to nothing if unified as one.  Before Word was invented,  no God existed upon Earth.  Truth cannot be uttered so  that's why I am writing it.   CUBIC TIME CUBES  Earth, Life, and Truth ---  contradicts 1 Day Gods,    and ineffable by human.  Nature enforces a LAW  against God existence.  No god equals 4 corner  simultaneous days in a  single rotation of Earth.  No god equals 4 corner  stages of metamorphic  rotating humanity - as a  baby, child, parent and  grandparent evolution.  Cubic Creation Wisdom   empowers me above all    the 1 day gods on Earth.  Jew owners of religious/   academic christianity --    have enslaved your ass,  and you are too stupid   to know you are a slave  to plunder profiteers of  Earth's Cubic Nature.  What queer mentality you  have --- to worship an old  dead Jew as God/Creator.  NO God creates himself --  and besides that, he is also  composed of opposites that  contradicts entity creation.  No God can even exist in  our Universe of Opposites.  Opposites transcend Entity.  Entity equals cancellation  --- the death of Opposites.  Evil Educated ""Singularity""  Stupid - ignores the Cubic  Wisdom of Wisest Human  and The Greatest Thinker.  No human or god can match  Nature's simultaneous 4 day  rotation in 1 Earth rotation.  No human has a right to  believe wrong  -  for that  would  be  evil  thinking.  Ignorance of 4 days is evil,  Evil educators teach 1 day.  1 day will destroy humans.  OPPOSITES CREATE.  Mother and father gave me birth, not a queer jew god.  Singularity god is EVIL as  Creation reigns as Opposite.  Educators, and You - ought  to be killed for ignoring the  fact that ""Earth is Cubed"".  (ignored and suppressed by EVIL educators)  NASA's Moon Landing was  far less of an achievement  than Time Cube discovery,  for I have Cubed the Earth,  with 4 simultaneous corner  days in 1 rotation of Earth.  (singularity belief scientist can't comprehend T.O.E.)  God SINGULARITY and the  academic taught singularity  constitute great evils in the  Cubic World of Opposites -  Opposites hemispheres and  Opposite sexes of humanity.  The  Universe  is composed  of Opposites - existing only  as Opposites  -  with a zero  value existence - cancelling  to nothing as a singularity.  I think Cubic,  therefore I  rise above the singularity  mentality human and the  false gods they worship -  discovering a Universe of  Opposites their education  will never allow them to  know.   Evil of believing  is not measuring and the  result of not measuring -  is never knowing Truth,  ineffable by man or god.  Gene Ray, Cubic and Wise Above Gods"

Ignorant of Nature's Harmonic  4 Day Time Cube Creation, the  Americans are Dumb, Educated  Singularity Stupid and Evil. It's  not immoral to kill Americans  who IGNORE their OPPOSITE  sex parents who Created them,  but instead worship a queer  jew who claims to make people  out of dirt - when the body is 90  percent water. A God so stupid  that he claims only a single day  rotation of Earth - while my  Cubic Wisdom has allowed me  to create 4 simultaneous days  within a single Earth rotation.  Americans do not deserve life.  They live only for today, the  evil singularity word bastards.  DOG BRAIN STUDENTS  Singularity ""education""  inflicts a dog brain upon  Students  -  ability to be  taught  servitude  -  but  an inability to ever think  opposite of brainwashing  and indoctrination - very  unlikely  to  ever  recover  to acknowledge Nature's  Harmonic Simultaneous  Rotating 4 Corner 24 Hr.  Days in 1 Earth Rotation.  Dr. Gene Ray, Cubic and Wise Above God.     Cubic Nature is Omnific,  Infinite, Ineffable and  on Harmonic duty today.  Singularity has no God  within ""The Universe of  Opposite Corner Life"" -  opposite hemispheres  and opposite sexes - by  which all Earth life exist.  For as long as you dumbass,  educated stupid and evil  bastards IGNORE Cubic  Creation, your sons and  daughters deserve to die  and be maimed in foreign  lands - while killing innocent  women and children. Keep  ignoring me you evil asses  and observe the slaughter of  your children protecting the  oil barons ripping off their  families back home. The  enemy is back home, not  in foreign lands. Ignore me  & keep counting the dead sons.  Creation occurs via opposites.  Singularity is the death math  of religious/academic Godism.  Earth Opposites should split  apart - and cascade molten  lava upon God Worshippers,  for they are the evil on Earth.  If god is your father, your mother is a whore.  Opposite Creation vs evil god entity.  He who speaks, preaches, teaches, condones  or practices SINGULARITY - an evil that  equates DEATH by cancellation of universal  OPPOSITES - hemispheres, sexes, seasons,  races, temperatures, marriages and divided  cell (the human Cubic who rotates a 4 corner  stage family rotating metamorphic lifetime) -  should have their evil lying tongue cut out.  Educators are lying bastards.  -1 x -1= +1 is WRONG, it is  academic stupidity and is evil.  The educated stupid should acknowledge  the natural antipodes of+1 x +1 = +1and  -1 x -1 = -1 exist as plus and minus values  of opposite creation - depicted by opposite  sexes and opposite hemispheres. Entity is  death worship - for it cancels opposites.  I have invested 30 years of my life and over  1/4 millions dollars researching Nature's 4 -  simultaneous 24 hour days within a single  rotation of Earth. Religious/Academic word  taught singularity is contradicted as evil lies  by the simple math of the Cube's Opposite  Corners - the most perfect symmetry within  the Universe.  Academic SINGULARITY  is a contradiction to the opposite sexes, the  opposite hemispheres and to the universe of  opposites that exist as a zero value existence.  The academic taught singularity/entity is but  poison fed the human populace - slow death.  I can say that educators ""eat shit"" and they  only cower and hide, doing nothing that will  induce debate, that will indict them as evil.  Americans will die SINGULARITY stupid,  their brain lobotomized by EVIL educators.  Neither EARTH or HUMAN  exist as entities, but opposites.  Earth is composed of opposite hemispheres  which rotate in opposite directions - equal  to a zero value existence (plus & minus). As  entity, the opposite hemispheres cancel out.  Earth exist as 4 - 90 degree opposite corner  quadrants, but not as a 360 degree circle.  Earth is Cubic opposites, nothing as circle.  A singularity inflicted scholar  has not the  mentality,  freedom  or  guts  to know that  academia is a Trojan Horse mind control.  Singularity brotherhood owns your brain,  destroying your ability to think Cubicism.  Evil academia blocks out Time Cube site  and suppresses its discussion and debate.  You are an educated singularity idiot who  can stupidly deny Nature's Harmonic 4  simultaneous 24 hour days within a single  rotation of Earth, or even make parody of  the Cubic Creation Principle - but your  mental ability to comprehend thegreatest  social and scientific discovery of all human  existence has been lobotomized by the evil  academic singularity bastards hired to  destroy your ability to think opposite. You  cannot comprehend Opposite Creation.  Religous/academic taught singularity is the  reduction of the human mind to android.  The half of Earth seen from  space, cannot exist without  the opposite half not seen...  existing as opposite values.  Earth entity does not exist -  for it is composed of opposite  hemispheres which rotate in  opposite directions - equating  to a zero value existence, and  to nothing as a ""singularity"".  You were educated to live an  evil lie - and your heirs will  suffer hell for your stupidity.  The entity you seek is death.  Educators teach assumed math, but are too  damn dumb, stupid and evil to know that  until Word is cornered, Math is fictitious.  Academic/Religious Word is a fictitious  Trojan Horse and the most efficient form  of human enslavement ever concocted by  ""Singularity Brotherhood of Bastardism"".  I INVOKE a CURSE upon the educators  that their students will awake from their  academic induced stupor & seek revenge.  You are evil to believe in the  singularity concept of a God,  for the whole Universe and  everthing within is composed  of Opposites - which exists  only as Opposites with a zero  value existence - and nothing  as an entity.  When adults go  to heaven, children still living  on Earth will burn in the hell  that adults created for them.  Love of God is hate for child.  Schools teach religious evil.  YOU are a Cubic Creature,  Opposites  create  Opposites.   Educated Singularity stupid,  empowering evil way of life.  Religious / academic taught  Singularity is Evil & Murder.  Academia has enslaved you  as a Word Animal - kneel,  you educated stupid jackass.  I can lead you to 4 Wisdom,  but I can't free your brain  from the evil of singularity.  Academia teaches evil android singularity,  displacing families with today's androids,  passive, subsmissive, subservient &stupid.  Religion is an evil singularity brotherhood  contradicted by the simultaneous 4 corner  24 hour days in a single rotation of Earth,  and the 4 corner stages of a human lifetime.  Opposite sexes equate a zero value existence.  Family tribal/village are bodies of opposites.  Religion/academia teach evil of singularity.  Teaching singularity equals death by Word.  Opposite sexes created you.  Ignorance of the Time Cube, Life Cube &  Ineffable Truth Cube, indicts you Stupid.  Ignoring Cubic Creation indicts you evil.  Singularity God impossible.  Wikipedia allowing the educated stupid  to evaluate the 4 simultaneous 24 hr. days  within a single rotation of Earth, equates  allowing atheist to proof-read the bible.  Dr. Gene Ray ---  is the only authoritative  Time Cube expert, at www.timecube.com.     Dr. Gene Ray offers Wikipedia $10,000.00  to disprove math that 1 rotation of 4 Earth  quadrants within the 4 quarter Harmonic  Time Cube does  create  4 simultaneous  24 hr. days. Both Americans & Wikipedia  are evil to deny or ignore Cubic Creation.  Is Wikipedia a Singularity Brotherhood  controlled Trojan Horse indoctrination -  that edits Time Cube to a negative view?  Who edits the Time Cube on Wikipedia?  It is evil for Coryoth to edit  Time Cube.  Will I get reply or will the Wisest Human  just be ignored until  silenced by death?  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  Religious Singularity is evil,  Academic Singularity is evil.  Singularity is damnable lie,  Educators altered your mind,  You cannot think opposite of  what you were taught to think.  You have a cyclop perspective  and taught android mentality =  lobotomized analytical ability.  Educated singularity stupid -  You can't think4 corner days."
EVEX,33bful,paronomasiac,3,Tue Apr 21 17:55:02 2015 UTC,"4 Earth Quadrants simultaneously rotate  inside 4 Time Cube Quarters to create 4  - 24 hour days within one Earth rotation.   This simple ignored math indicts you evil.   Demand evil educators explain Cubicism,   or allow me to come teach Cube Creation.     No man, nation or God equal  Cube symmetry of opposites.  Mathematically impossible for a Genius  or any God to match my Cubic Wisdom.  Educators fear me, they cower and run.  6 sides constitutes a sextet -- not a Cube.  Teaching that a Cube has '6 sides' with  no top & bottom, induces an evil curse  that pervades all academic institutions.  Opposites create Opposites.  Mom & Dad opposites create son & daughter opposites.  Opposite Creators required,  Depicted by Earth's opposite hemispheres.  Singularity God impossible.  Opposites  de-god  Religion.  Opposites create the universe.  Opposites compose the Earth.  Opposites compose humanity.  Opposites create your body.  Opposites de-god academia.  Opposites de-god singularity  taught by religious/academia.  I can call singularity educators the most  putrid name on Earth and claim they eat  cow-dung ambrosia,  but the lying ass  bastards will not even object - for they  know I am right and that any debate will  indict them for the evil they perpetuate  against the students and future humanity.  Scientists know Time Cube,  but any scientist supporting  the 4 simultaneous days in a  single rotation of Earth, will  be fired and banned for life  from academic institutions.  Scientists are evil cowards  and  should be castrated  for obscurantism of the 4  simultaneous days within  a single rotation of Earth.  Average people understand  4 Day Creation when I tell  them about it, but scientist  can't accept it, for the evil  bastards think singularity.  Singularity can't procreate,  a feat requiring opposites.  Bible Word is a singularity.  You are taught singularity.  Singularity is death worship  and damnation of humanity.  No God equals the 4 corner  simultaneous 24 hour days  within single Earth rotation.  The universe and all within  it is composed of opposites.  Religious/academic taught  singularity is queer as 1 sex.  Believing is not knowing -  but evil that ignores facts.  Santa vital to Christmas -  No Santa - no Christmas.  Why credit Santa LIE with  gifts that parents buy their  children? It bribes the child  mind to accept false Santa  spirit and false god spirit  deceit associated with it.  Santa Claus and Christmas  must be indicted deceits  that destroys child mind.  God is but an adult Santa  extension of child Santa -  equating evil singularity -  unnatural as 1 pole Earth.  Earth has not 2 poles, but  opposite poles that cancel  each other out - if added.  6 side Cube is Evil math,  ignoring its top & bottom.  -1 x -1 = +1 is Evil math,  as +1 and -1 are antipodes  equating a zero existence.  3 Dimensions is erroneous  math without a 4th corner  perspective dimension. If  ever allowed, Cubic debate  will indict evil singularity  as damnation of humanity.  Believers are Evil - for not  measuring. Result of belief is  dyingstupid -you can know.  Singularity education begets evil,  for you were born as an opposite,  between opposite sexes & the  opposite Earth poles. You are  educated as a stupid android  slave to the evil Word Animal  Singularity Brotherhood. Your  analytical mind is lobotomized  and you cannot think opposite  of lies you are taught to think.  You build the hell 'they'teach.    Dr.Gene Ray, Cubic and Wisest Human  You have opposite brains to think  opposite, but Big Brother icepick  academic lobotomy has destroyed  your mentality to think opposite of  the evil singularity you are taught.  The 4 days is above your godism  and you don't even want to know.  Universe is composed of opposite  hemispheres and opposite sexes -  equating to + / -, a zero existence,  depicted by Pyramid's bare coffer.  Your 1Day God Makes You Evil.  4 Corner Days Are Absolute, but  ignored by stupid/evil educators.  Until cornered, word is fictitious.  God is product of fictitious word.  4Day Cube Disproves 1Day God  All creation within the universe is composed of  opposite hemispheres and opposite sexes - with  opposite races, opposite seasons, opposite luck,  opposite directions and opposite perspectives -  equating a harmonic rotating zero value existence.  ""To know all, is to know nothing"".  You must attack the word bastards who preach  and teach evil godism and racism singularity lies,  for any singularity brotherhood is mental slavery  that desecrates family, village and tribal opposites.  Americans are dumbass, educated stupid and evil  singularity fools.  I will wager $10,000.00 that  within the Cubic embodiment of Nature, there are  4 simultaneous 24 hour days within a single rotation  of Earth. Acknowledge the math below or go to hell.  4 Day Cube disproves 1 Day God.  1-Midday to midday = a 24 hour day rotation.  2-Sundown to sundown = a 24 hour day rotation.  3-Midnight to midnight = a 24 hour day rotation.  4-Sunup to sunup = a 24 hour day rotation.  4 Day math condemns 1 Day fools.  These 4 absolute simultaneous days PROVES the  1 day god, 1day academia, 1 day religion and the  1 day media to be erroneous, fictitious and evil lies.  Education equates to a mass icepick lobotomy -  destroying the mind's ability to think as opposites.  All 4/24 hour days occur within 1 Earth rotation.  You educated stupid word animals can't fathom  this greatest social and scientific math of creation.  God claimed to have created a single day  rotation of Earth.  I have created simultaneous  4 day rotation of Earth. Why do you worship  such a stupid God?  Do you really believe that  your Jew God screwed a hole in the ground to  create Adam and Eve out of dirt, at the same  time that woman existed in the nation of NOD,  Nation of Damsels from where Cain got wife?  Adam and Eve were created at the same time,  but sexless. A rib was removed from eve and  a hole left to make a woman of her. The rib  was stuck on Adam to make a man of him -  and Eve is still trying to get her rib back.  Recognition and application of this Cubic  simultaneous 4 day rotation of Earth,  will change all math, science and societies  from the beginning of human existence.  You have to be evil to ignore this math.  1-Midday to midday is a 24 hour rotation.  2-Sundown to sundown is a 24 hour rotation.  3-Midnight to midnight is a 24 hour rotation.  4-Sunup to sunup is a 24 hour rotation.  4 Earth corners rotate 4 Time corners -  for 4 simultaneous day rotation of Earth -  equating the principle of a 4 pole motor.  Academic bastards will deny the obvious.  Americans are EVIL for ignoring Cubicism.     Acknowledge the 4 days or you die evil.  Do not pass this point without the 4 days.     Dr. Gene Ray, will be interviewed on  FTL@freetalklive.com, at 8pm on  Friday 7,  about Time Cube discovery -  greatest discovery of human existence.  Humans are evil to worship  singularity of 1day education,  ignoring Nature's Harmonic  Cubic Antipodal Creation.  Academic singularity is as  evil as God singularity evil.  You have not the mentality  to comprehend the simple math of Cubic  antipode creation, for at about age 6, your  parents gave your 2 opposite antipode brains  to Big Brother academic hirelings, to clone    thought to serve evil singularity brotherhood -  destroying Cubic families, villages and tribes.  Creation is by opposites, opposite hemispheres  and opposite sexes - not queer singularity.  You've been educated stupid  by ""Big Brother"" singularity.  Singularity God is evil belief.  Cubic antipode creation debunks singularity.  Cube is the most perfect form of opposites.  Opposite hemispheres equate opposite cubes.  Opposite sex cubes equate to a crap-shoot.  Your God claimed to have created a single  day rotation of Earth.    I offer absolute  proof that I have created 4 simultaneous  24 hour days within a single rotation of  Earth.  You worship ""Evil Singularity"",  equating you to a ""singularity bastard"".  Why do you worship a queer 1 day God?  Are you content as a singularity queer?  Einstein was singularity stupid,  and you are singularity stupid.  ""Born Cubic, THINK CUBIC"",  you rotate a 4 corner stage life.  Singularity educated humans  are not intelligent.  The universe does not exist,  except as opposites - with a  zero value existence.     Add  the opposites together and  the universe ceases to exist.       All humans are created and  exist between the opposites  of male and female values.  Add the opposites together  and humans cease to exist.  A single God is death and   constitutes evil worship.   I am flabbergasted that the  ""big brother"" hired pedants  can brainwash and indoctrinate  the powerful antipode human  mind to ignore the simple math  of 4 simultaneous 24 hour days  within a single rotation of Earth,  to worship one and trash three.     EVIL OBSCURANTISM  (Deliberately withholding CUBIC KNOWLEDGE)  No human ""entity"" exists.  Cube is opposite perfection.  Singularity is death worship."

There's another metric we can use to evaluate the impacts rule 9 and referendum 2 have had on the sub.  Referendum 2 isn't just discouraging the people who submit rule suggestions, it's also discouraging the people who vote. Take, for example, the results of this week's suggestion thread. A suggestion with 6 upvotes reached the ballot. Before Referendum 2, it was common to see suggestions fail with 30 or more upvotes. Now, 5 people have to agree with it for a suggestion to go to vote.  This is happening because we've made the suggestion thread a chore to read. Every suggestion takes four times longer than it should to evaluate. No one is reading the suggestions. They're repetitive and boring because of the format, which is driving activity into the ground.  Edit: Furthermore, 4 of 5 suggestions that made it to the vote this week have at this time 10 or less upvotes. I think the reason that we no longer see posts with +70 or +80 is clear."

I'd agree these benefits would not last forever if someone flat out refuses to contribute to society. Say after 6 months without a job they lose benefits for 1 year, and the cycle repeats. If a job can not provide enough income to supplement these things, then they are allowed to stay as long as they pay a high income tax(~80%).

That seems like a lot of revenue lost that can't be recovered by slightly raising taxes on the 1%.    If we can fulfill every ones basic needs then why not?   Maybe because I earned the fruits of my labor, with, you guessed it, my labor. Maybe I don't want to give my money/resources to pay for someone else's life. Don't get me wrong, I want to help others; but, on my own terms."
EVEX,3315q5,Threedawg,1 point,Sun Apr 19 20:28:37 2015 UTC,"I don't want to take the money from you, your money is yours. That being said, you should realize that the only reason you were able to make that much was because there were so many people below you making less, because they had to start out in poverty.   I want to take it from the top 1%, because they don't work that much harder than everyone else. They were(for the most part), born into it. And one person does not need more than 10 million year, for any reason.  Welfare and half of defense is nearly 1 trillion. That should be able to easily put the impoverished in homes, without even raising taxes."
EVEX,3315q5,save_the_pigs,2,Sun Apr 19 20:42:44 2015 UTC,"I don't get why this is a problem? Wall street workers have worked their whole lives to get to that point, going through school and many jobs to get to the top. They've earned their money. We can whine about how they're paid too much, but that's pretty dumb. They've earned their way to the top and I respect them even though I am jealous."
EVEX,3315q5,AutoKill45,3,Sat Apr 18 23:31:54 2015 UTC,Inequality is the root cause of a huge number of problems.
EVEX,3315q5,Katholikos,4,Sun Apr 19 06:43:32 2015 UTC,"No one's arguing they shouldn't be paid more, is that they're being paid way, way more than they should be."
EVEX,3315q5,save_the_pigs,3,Sat Apr 18 23:49:58 2015 UTC,"Who decides how much they should be paid? Personally, I'd say their employer gets to make that decision. Would you suggest someone else?  This'd is a stupid comparison to make. It's apples and oranges."
EVEX,3315q5,Avcdo,0,Sun Apr 19 00:28:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah but like a said in my comment, they earned their way to the top and now they reap the rewards. We can whine all we want about how it's unfair and how they're being paid to much but at the end of the day they earned their way to the top and if we wanted to be there we should have worked harder. I'd love to make that much money, I don't though because I wasn't smart enough in school, didn't make all the right choices and didn't work hard enough. I could whine about how they make more money than I do, but they earned their way to that money, and we should focus on our own lives."

""Snowflakes keep falling on my expired debit cards / never leave the house, I don't know why I've got an extra car"""
EVEX,331q80,billybobthorton22,2,Sun Apr 19 07:36:28 2015 UTC,I've been on a real Mac Miller kick lately. I started listening to Delusional Thomas the other day and it's ridiculous. Since the weather's been nice here lately I've been really enjoying Blue Slide Park too because it feels like a good summer album.
EVEX,331q80,Brosama220,2,Sun Apr 19 11:32:16 2015 UTC,"No doubt, I had a talk with a friend the other day, and I concluded that while Mac isn't the best rapper out there, and not even the rapper I think has the best discography, but he's the rapper I'm most interested in seeing new stuff from. Whenever he puts out a mixtape or freestyle, I check it out instantly, because the guy is so fucking unpredicatble, but whatever he does, he does well. His evolution as an artist is also almost unparalleled. I can party and smoke out to old Mac, and shoot heroin and cry myself to sleep with new Mac."
EVEX,331q80,billybobthorton22,2,Sun Apr 19 12:23:10 2015 UTC,"His interviews are so entertaining, I love watching them. Mac's one of my favorites. Like you said, he may not be the best, but his lyricism is underrated I'd say. He's a good lyricist and has interesting and unique rhyme schemes.   Also, that heroin thing better be a joke. My sister's in rehab for that shit, it's bad news."
EVEX,331q80,Brosama220,2,Sun Apr 19 21:52:04 2015 UTC,"He's a fucking awesome lyricist. My favourite style of both rapping follows good writing style: 'Show dont tell', and I feel like Mac is one of the best at doing that. ""Went to Amar'e's party, took tequila shots with Kevin Hart / But Kevin don't remember that / I saw him at the V M A's, told a joke - he never laughed""  That line seems so random when you first hear it, but the implications with him boing able to interact with all these famous people, but it all just being some shallow forgettable bullshit, and no one really taking him seriously are too cool.  Oh shit, sorry mate, just kidding with the junk. I'm more the drink-too-much-red-wine-and-dabble-with-my-own-poolside-depression type of guy."
EVEX,331q80,billybobthorton22,2,Sun Apr 19 22:01:33 2015 UTC,"Mac has bars for days. Like on Macadelic its just bar after bar after bar, I love it. And what song is that line from? He's really good at making both songs where he just spits and conceptual songs.   And you're good, I just wanted to be sure. Heroin put my family through a lot of pain and I'd hate for anyone else to go through that. My family does have a lot of ""drink-too-much-red-wine-and-dabble-with-my-own-poolside-depression"" types, as well and I can tell you that's not a good road to go down either."
EVEX,331q80,Brosama220,2,Sun Apr 19 22:06:30 2015 UTC,"It's from 'Friends' off of 'Faces'.   I can only imagine. I live in Scandinavia tho, heroin is almost impossible to come by, even if you go looking for it. (And we just started the fixer-houses, which I think is an amazing initiaive). I know, I know, but I had a long recovery after a breakup. Im a lot better lately, though, haven't been feeling down and empty for quite a while."

Since struggling with Christianity and later rejecting it is such a huge theme in his body of work, it really lends extra weight to his cover of this song littered with biblical references.

EVEX,3305lj,KidWoody,3,Sat Apr 18 07:21:46 2015 UTC,Wow. This actually might have the best vocals of any version I've heard.  Buckley still takes home gold just for the guitar playing though.

I went into detail in this post here where I talked specifically about policies and answered some questions. Here is my basic platform:  What Evex needs in a President is non-intervention. As President I will not sticky anything more than is already stickied now, in order to avoid confusion over voting and suggestion threads. I love the laissez faire Evex of today, where everyone's voice is valid. Therefore, I will not add any of my own suggestions to the voting app unless the community specifically ask me to.  Basically, an Evex with me as President will operate almost exactly as it does now. We don't need change, we need stability. Vote Briizo :D"

Because I cannot do this without all of your help. EVEX is a great sub, with even greater potential!  EVEX started from the humble beginnings of a /r/theoryofreddit post. An innocent question of what a subreddit whose rules that are decided by you, the users, would look like. The fourteenth vote is upon us, and the fourteenth rule is right over the horizon. Like the previous 13 rules, this one too will be decided by you.  13 rules, and 13 weeks. In many cultures 13 is a sign of bad luck. An omen of bad times ahaead. A warning to the foolish to dare not tread further.  But EVEX! My dear EVEX! There is no luck we can overcome, there is no omen we can unmask, and there is no warning that can stop us!  WE WILL CONTINUE, AND WE WILL EVOLVE!  I plan to use my powers as president to ensure the voice of you, the people of EVEX, can be heard loud and clear. Each vote registered and given worth. Each one if you given merit, for making this sub as amazing as it is now, and as amazing as it will become!  I plead to you citizens of EVEX! As president of EVEX, I with ensure the subreddit evolves not by the will of any one redditor, but the will of all of us! The with of EVEX! THE WILL TO EVOLVE!  ~A vote for alien122 is a vote for the stars!"

EVEX,32wchi,DrKluge,19,Fri Apr 17 10:51:02 2015 UTC,If I could offer some perspective. I've been subscribed to this sub since at least rule 2 was enacted but this is my first real post. I thought it was going to be super cool to see a whole bunch of content that would eventually get whittled into a more concrete vision.  Instead it's a lot of silly fluff like Eevee is apparently a mascot and mods have to post a haiku or whatever.   Basically the idea of this sub was super cool but I feel like the overall execution didn't work and led to less interest from myself and other users.
EVEX,32wchi,GEARHEADGus,1 point,Fri Apr 17 22:21:20 2015 UTC,Not every rule should be something serious. A little sillyness now and then is nice.
EVEX,32wchi,manwithabadheart,7,Mon Apr 20 00:19:23 2015 UTC,I guess the general idea of this sub is just becoming less interesting.
EVEX,32wchi,D45_B053,6,Fri Apr 17 17:49:25 2015 UTC,The suggestion threads got quiet when referendum 2 passed. The vote threads had been getting quieter long before that though.
EVEX,32wchi,funkyhiphop,3,Sat Apr 18 04:49:09 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that the initial few rules, actually banning subjects and content were the way forward, because the sub is an experiment to see what eventually ends up being allowed right? The rules that added things, rules that didn't ban things, they haven't added anything to the experiment in terms of what content is allowed, and so people have lost interest in the overall experiment. To get the sub back on track with popularity, the votes will need to become simpler, less of the confusing referendums and simply ""Ban X, Y or Z?"""

EVEX,32wchi,LeinadSpoon,7,Fri Apr 17 08:02:19 2015 UTC,I don't like the implementation of the balance of power referendum.  I think giving out a special flair for someone winning with alts encourages users to try that.
EVEX,32ww36,Forthwrong,11,Fri Apr 17 11:44:44 2015 UTC,"I already posted this on the last rule-removal referendum and both you and bossman replied over there. However, I was not convinced by your arguments and quite a few people agreed with me, so I'll be happy to repeat myself:      I'm not entirely sure why this referendum was allowed. Removing a rule influences content, not procedure. The wiki even has an example specifically for this under ""What qualifies for a referendum?"":   5) Changing the process to remove rules   Not ""Remove a rule"", ""Change the process to remove rules"".   If we want to remove rules via referendum, we should first allow that by referendum, not just start it. That, btw, is allowed:   6) What is/isn't allowed in referendums       Edit: Concerning /u/Bossman1086's answer that we don't have have any rule prohibiting rule-removal, I'd argue that we do:   7) No suggestions that remove old rules will be considered as of yet (this is something we intend to have as a possibility in the future when there are more rules in place).   This rule is only for suggestion threads, but referendums were explicitly created as an extension of the suggestion-voting system. As mentioned above, the wording in the wiki, though not airtight, implies that this rule was originally meant to also apply to referendums."
EVEX,32ww36,Tobl4,3,Fri Apr 17 12:19:22 2015 UTC,"As much as I hate rule 7, I agree with you.  Also, all the existing rules are about content, loosely, so removing a rule is changing content not procedure."
EVEX,32ww36,StinkyMcBalls,1 point,Fri Apr 17 12:33:44 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree, on a rational level, with your first point, and I hope you'll excuse my opportunism for proposing to remove a rule in a method that is, evidently, officially sanctioned.  BUT AGREEING IS NOT WHAT I'M HERE FOR; I'D LOVE TO ARGUE ABOUT THIS. ACTUALLY, I'M GOING TO START MY ARGUMENT BY AGREEING WITH YOU, BECAUSE I LIKE DISAGREEING WITH MYSELF AS WELL.  I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT THE WIKI DOES NOT EXPLICITLY MENTION THAT RULE-REMOVAL BE HANDLED BY MEANS OF REFERENDUM. HOWEVER, RULE-REMOVAL IS MORE PROCEDURAL THAN CONTENT-RELATED, AND WHAT THE WIKI DOES EXPLICITLY STATE IS THAT REFERENDA ARE NOT LIMITED TO THE THINGS LISTED.   Removing a rule influences content, not procedure.   WHAT SOMETHING INFLUENCES DOES NOT DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS CONTENT-RELATED OR PROCEDURAL. ALL PROCEDURAL THINGS INFLUENCE CONTENT IN SOME WAY. PROCEDURES ALL REQUIRE EXISTENT THINGS TO REGULATE, AND WITHIN THE SCOPE OF /r/EVEX, IF SOMETHING EXISTS, IT IS CONTENT IN SOME WAY.  FURTHERMORE, IF RULE REMOVAL WERE UNPROCEDURAL, THEN AS WOULD BE ""WHAT IS/ISN'T ALLOWED IN REFERENDUMS,"" BECAUSE THAT INFLUENCES CONTENT IN THE SAME WAY THAT RULE REMOVAL INFLUENCES CONTENT. SO, IGNORING THE FACT THAT THIS WOULD DIRECTLY CONTRADICT THE WIKI PAGE ABOUT REFERENDA, THIS WOULD ALSO CREATE AN INCONSISTENCY: IF THIS REFERENDUM IS UNPROCEDURAL, A REFERENDUM TO ALLOW RULE-REMOVAL TO BE HANDLED BY MEANS OF REFERENDA WOULD ALSO BE UNPROCEDURAL.  APROPOS THE SUGGESTION THREAD RULE, REFERENDA AND SUGGESTION THREADS OPERATE BY DIFFERENT RULES ON ALMOST EVERY LEVEL. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO APPLY SUGGESTION THREAD RULES TO REFERENDA; THE VERY NEXT RULE AFTER THE ONE YOU MENTION IS ""SUGGESTIONS IN THIS THREAD ARE ONLY FOR CONTENT-RELATED RULES.""  HOW WERE REFERENDA CREATED AS AN EXTENTION OF THE SUGGESTION-VOTING SYSTEM? THE WAY I SEE IT, REFERENDA OPERATE IN PARALLEL TO THE SUGGESTION-VOTING SYSTEM (APART FROM HOW THEY'RE VOTED FOR ON THE SAME PAGE, THOUGH EVEN THERE THEY'RE EXPLICITLY SEPARATE). ALSO, WHAT PART OF THE WIKI IMPLIES THE RULE WAS INTENDED TO APPLY TO REFERENDA?"

I DON'T EXPECT ACTUAL CITATIONS, BUT AT LEAST EXPLAIN WHY YOU THINK IT HAS THESE EFFECTS.  THE FOLLOWING IS ONLY ANECDOTAL, BUT FOR ME PERSONALLY, THE RULE HAS NOT DISCOURAGED ME FROM DEBATING. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT HAS ENCOURAGED ME TO REMAIN POLITE IN MY DISCUSSIONS TO COUNTERACT THAT I'M TALKING IN ALLCAPS. IN NO OTHER SUBREDDIT HAVE I EXPERIENCED THAT PEOPLE THANK EACH OTHER AFTER A DEBATE OR AGREE ON HOW THE DISCUSSION SHOULD BE HELD.  If I'm the minority in that, I'm fine with abolishing rule 7, but I wanted to give another experience of how this rule can work."

EVEX,32ww36,bbnn,0,Fri Apr 17 13:30:55 2015 UTC,"HERE ARE MY CITATIONS. ANYWAY.   The rule has stifled potential debates   I KNOW THE RULE HAS INFLUENCED ME TO WRITE IN A MORE POLITICALLY CORRECT WAY, WITH LESS CRITICAL THINKING AND MORE GLIBNESS. LET ME BE CLEAR: I'M NOT SAYING THIS IS THE CASE FOR EVERYONE, BUT I'M CERTAIN THAT IT'S THE CASE FOR AT LEAST ONE PERSON, AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT I'M NOT ALONE IN THINKING THIS.   rule seven discourages all disagreement   THE RULE DISCOURAGES ALL DISAGREEMENT BY MAKING ALL DISAGREEMENT HAVE TO TAKE THE FORM OF ALL-CAPS. WHEN IT CONTRASTS WITH NORMAL WRITING, ALL-CAPS IS HARDER TO READ AND, ON THE INTERNET, SEEMS LIKE SHOUTING; THESE ARE TWO THINGS THAT MAKE ALL-CAPS LESS CONDUCIVE TO CONVERSATION THAN REGULAR CASE. AND ON A FUNCTIONAL LEVEL, WE'VE PARTICIPATED IN A DEBATE IN WHICH WE INCLUDED NON-CAPS VERSIONS OF OUR LONG ARGUMENTS, PROBABLY BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE ALL-CAPS VERSION THAT MADE IT LESS LEGIBLE OR LESS INTERESTING OR OTHERWISE LESS DESIREABLE.   it strengthens arguments that are logically poor yet rhetorically convincing.   BY LIMITING DISAGREEMENT, IT LIMITS CRITICAL THINKING, AND CRITICAL THINKING IS OFTEN WHAT REVEALS THE FLAWS OF AN ARGUMENT THAT SOUNDS GREAT BUT ISN'T REALLY LOGICALLY SOUND. THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE STANDARD FORMAT REFERENDUM ABOUT WHICH WE DEBATED.   the rule has also had few (if any) positive effects.   WHILE I GENUINELY BELIEVE THAT IT HASN'T HAD MANY POSITIVE EFFECTS, THINKING ABOUT THE REASONING SEEMS TO BOIL DOWN TO ONLY MATTERS OF OPINION RATHER THAN OF FACT, SO I'VE MODIFIED MY ORIGINAL STATEMENT ACCORDINGLY.   IT HAS ENCOURAGED ME TO REMAIN POLITE IN MY DISCUSSIONS    ASSUMING THAT A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE, ON AVERAGE, MORE POLITE IN DEBATES BECAUSE OF THE ALL-CAPS, I STILL THINK THAT A GREATER QUANTITY OF ALL SORTS OF ARGUMENTS IS BETTER THAN A LOWER QUANTITY OF ARGUMENTS OF A DIFFERENT QUALITY IN THE INTEREST OF SUBREDDIT ACTIVITY, BECAUSE CONTENT ENCOURAGES FURTHER CONTENT. IF SUBREDDIT ACTIVITY WEREN'T POOR, I THINK RULE 7 WOULD HAVE MORE MERIT.  EDIT: I'D ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT, WHILE ON AVERAGE THE RULE MAY INCREASE CIVILTY, APPARENTLY THIS EFFECT IS INVERTED FOR SOME PEOPLE WHEN THE DISCUSSION IS ABOUT THE RULE ITSELF."

It is also known as oxygen toxicity syndrome, oxygen intoxication, and oxygen poisoning. Historically, the central nervous system condition was called the Paul Bert effect, and the pulmonary condition the Lorrain Smith effect, after the researchers who pioneered its discovery and description in the late 19th century. Severe cases can result in cell damage and death, with effects most often seen in the central nervous system, lungs and eyes. Oxygen toxicity is a concern for underwater divers, those on high concentrations of supplemental oxygen (particularly premature babies), and those undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

First, whoever would say in real life that more infants in poor countries should die to prevent overpopulation should be punched in the face. Second, there is decades of research that show lowering infant mortality rates correlates to (and probably causes) a steeper lowering of birth rates (i.e. The mothers have less babies overall) since don't have 10 babies hoping some survive.  Second is the slippery slope bullshit. The author acknowledges that vaccines will save lives and help others, yet he's worried this will somehow turn into some mob mentality that will extend far beyond health and following the facts scientists have discovered. The author does would rather let communities suffer from disease than force vaccination.  Third, he claims to be worried about the long term ecological effects of vaccines being untested.

Common Grounds is a six-issue comic book limited series created by writer Troy Hickman note  and published by Top Cow Productions in 2004. The series examined the life of superheroes and villains in and around a chain of coffee shops called Common Grounds, all of which which serve as a neutral-ground between superpowered heroes and villains. Because of the lack of violence on their premises, these restaurants allow heroes and villains to speak to one another in amicable situations, and provided insights into their histories and personal lives as they are featured in normal, everyday situations while still in character as a hero or villain."

EVEX,32nj13,_AUTOMATIC_,12,Wed Apr 15 05:13:49 2015 UTC,"Rule shorthand: All nsfw or nsfl posts must describe their content  in the title or comments.  Rule elaboration: All posts linking to NSFW or NSFL content must have the content described non-ambiguously in the title or comments.  Justification: Many people, when browsing /r/EVEX, do not want to be surprised by strange or disgusting content. Because of this, ambiguous titles to nsfw or nsfl posts are a pain in the ass because you do not know what you may see. This rule will eliminate that risky guessing game by alerting viewers what lurks behind that hidden thumbnail.   Resulting changes: Evex will be safer for viewing because fewer people will be surprised and shocked by ambiguously titled NSFW or NSFL posts."
EVEX,32nj13,Forthwrong,34,Fri Apr 17 03:09:13 2015 UTC,"Shorthand: Every first Saturday of the month is Purge night.  Elaboration: On Purge night, this is the only rule that is active, and all the other rules become optional.  Justification: Everything is good in moderation, including moderation. This will not bring chaos to the sub unless that's what people want to do, which is still quite possible with the current rules.  Expected effect: One day a month, nobody needs to worry about following the letter of the law."

EVEX,32nj13,nospr2,8,Fri Apr 17 13:24:20 2015 UTC,"Rule shorthand: Each week we have a random banned word.  Rule Elaboration: On each Monday, we change the banned word for that week. We would use a random word generator such as this. Then all comments or posts that us this word will be banned. Not only that but if someone were to post an explicit picture of the banned word, this would count as breaking this rule.  Justification: This would encourage creatively to see what posts or comments people would try to say without including the word in question. Since the word generator would not ban words such as 'and' or 'the' we don't need to worry about this getting in the way. It would only be banning a word such as 'tire' or 'priest'.  Resulting changes: The comments and posts will follow these rules, and we perhaps could see other interesting rules in this same vain proposed in the future."
EVEX,32nj13,Zacoftheaxes,7,Wed Apr 15 20:11:02 2015 UTC,"Rule shorthand: All posts about current media must contain spoiler tags.  Rule Elaboration: All posts for ongoing TV shows, movies, books, comics, albums, etc must be properly tagged to avoid accidentally spoiling. Examples include [Spoilers Better Call Saul S01E09], [Spoilers The Winds of Winter], [Spoilers Whiplash], etc. Any content that is still undergoing release or was released in the past two years must be tagged. Everything else is fair game. If a thread contains spoilers in its main post the title must be tagged. In a properly tagged thread spoilers may be discussed openly. Any spoilers in comments in threads that are not tagged must be tagged themselves.  Justification: Accidental spoilers are the worst. They will bring an internet lynch mob towards you in an instant. We should adopt this rule to keep this subreddit peaceful. With a new season of Game of Thrones, a new Avengers film, and plenty more on the horizon we ought to adopt this rule as a preemptive measure.  Resulting changes: All spoilers for recent content on this subreddit will be clearly marked, protecting fans who are not caught up on the content."
EVEX,32nj13,alien122,2,Thu Apr 16 05:39:21 2015 UTC,"Shorthand: any two people strongly arguing in this sub must post a goodwill message, in earnest, after they finish their argument.  Elaboration: When two people argue intensely in addition to talking in all caps, must post a goodwill message to the person they're arguing with after their arguments.  Justification: Arguing can tend to lead people to demonize the other side and forget that they, too, are human. This helps ensure people even a little that the person they're talking to is also a person or it can stop arguments from getting to heated to the point where it becomes personal. It'll bring a little lightheadedness during arguments and decrease hostility between the arguing parties. Furthermore, arguments can warrant unwanted attention from a number of subreddits which would only lead to an exacerbation of the hostility. This seeks to prevent that as well.  Results: it will decrease hostility in the sub when people try to be nicer to each other during arguments."
EVEX,32nj13,Forthwrong,6,Fri Apr 17 03:05:02 2015 UTC,"in any language   This would prevent us from using terms such as chips, christ, cholera, fan, gun, pest, puts, skit, and I'm sure there are plenty others.

EVEX,32nj13,Higgenbottoms,1 point,Wed Apr 15 23:07:59 2015 UTC,"Rule shorthand: All posts that contain topics relating to snakes must be tagged as so.  Rule Elaboration: If your post is a picture, article, or otherwise a link to a location that talks about snakes or shows pictures of snakes, your post must be tagged in the beginning as [Snake]. If you have a text post or a post that is expected to lead to conversation about snakes, such as ""What is everyone's favorite reptile?"", should also be tagged with [Snake].  Justification: Fear of snakes or ophidiophobia is extremely common and occurs in one-third of the adult population. This new rule would help people feel safer on this subreddit and make sure that people who have a fear of snakes will not be exposed to snakes and be surprised.  Resulting changes: Posts relating to snakes, or are expected to lead to conversations about snakes will be tagged as [Snake]. This will make the subreddit safer for individuals with ophidiophobia."

EVEX,32i33s,briizo,7,Mon Apr 13 23:41:23 2015 UTC,"Briizo for President of EVEX  Hello young bucks! My name is Briizo. You may know me as ""the weather report guy"", one of the ""ban image macros"" guys, or maybe ""the duck guy"".  I have been an active member of this community since around the conception of the third or fourth rule. I love this subreddit and everyone on it, and I don’t think that this position of presidency should greatly change the way we operate. Please help me become the first President of EVEX.  Why do you want to be President?  I don’t, actually! But what I want even less is for somebody else to become President and change this subreddit for the worse. As the first President of EVEX, I pledge to set our government on a path of non-intervention and small government. I will rarely make rule suggestions and endorsements, and will only make official posts when absolutely necessary. I think the system we have now is great, and shouldn’t be uprooted.  But you have some agenda right? Changes you'd like to see?  Umm, let’s see. I support more weather reports (maybe). More duck pics (if you guys want em). Less cabbage phobia (I guess). Ban image macros (nah, just kidding). In reality I’m not going to actively work towards these goals. I plan on doing very little and changing nothing.  A vote for Briizo is a vote for the status quo. A vote for Briizo is a vote for Evexian Libertarianism. Godspeed, young bucks.  Here is an alternate campaign poster."
EVEX,32i33s,Agent78787,3,Mon Apr 13 23:44:39 2015 UTC,"How can a president really ""change this subreddit for the worse"" without the people's consent?   Unlike other presidential systems, the president is less of a strong executive and more of a ""super-voter"" that can pass proposals of rules, which still need to be voted on. The President cannot veto a rule that passed in the weekly vote, nor veto a referendum.   The President is not a strongman dictator, since (s)he simply cannot be. (S)he is simply a tool of the people to efficiently govern this subreddit, and ""non-interventionism"" will make the office without a purpose.  A ""non-interventionist"" President is no excuse for a President."
EVEX,32i33s,Agent78787,3,Tue Apr 14 03:27:59 2015 UTC,"I am anticipating a number of candidates running on platforms that incorporate new posts that will be stickied all the time, and I'm sure I'll be one of the only candidates promising not to shove my own rules into the voting threads. I don't want to see some overzealous president abusing his/her powers of stickying and rule suggesting.  I'll get into this more later, after more candidates have announced, but here is an example of why I should be elected on the platform of non-intervention. There is a user in this subreddit who I assume will run and will be a major contender for president, and I'm sure you can figure out who I'm talking about. This user has a good shot of winning simply because he makes tons of posts and people know his name already. However, people overlook the fact that this user has one of the worst suggestion records ever. He spams suggestion threads with rules that generally receive negative karma, and yet people already expect him to be a frontrunner in the election. I can only imagine what the stickied posts and spammed suggestions may be if he becomes president.  I am running to counteract this particular user and others like him, with my promise not to interfere with the way EVEX is currently running. I love this subreddit and don't want to see our procedures changed and spamming become expected from presidents. If you don't agree with this then don't support me, but I just wanted to explain why a ""non-interventionist"" president is the best president we can have."
EVEX,32i33s,Forthwrong,4,Tue Apr 14 03:41:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your thorough answer.  I now see the benefits of a non-interventionist president. However, couldn't there be a middle ground?

EVEX,32bgxl,MesePudenda,3,Sun Apr 12 20:26:00 2015 UTC,"I get the concept, I meant these stories."
EVEX,32bgxl,MuhammadIsMyMuscle,4,Sun Apr 12 20:42:30 2015 UTC,"First one: there is a team of adventurers, most of which are pretty-boy anime protagonist types, but one of which is a grumpy old war-horse.  The old guy is always degrading the other characters when they miss skill checks or get hurt, yelling at them so much that the DM (referee, basically) lets them try again.  Yada yada, they're towards the end of the adventure and the old man has cleaned up his act a bit.  They are fighting a big bad guy, and the fight goes south.  All of a sudden, the old man goes back to yelling at everyone, and the DM says that their wounds heal and they start succeeding at skill checks.  It turns out that all along, the old guy wasn't a fighter (character class that's good at martial combat), but a paladin (a holy knight with healing powers) and whenever he yelled at the characters, he was casting a divine spell to help them.  Second one: four guys go on a wacky quest to become gods.  Eh.  Third one: there's a jerk playing and messing up the game, but OP (who is playing the only evil character on a team of good characters) kills the jerk's character.  The jerk wants everyone to get mad at OP, but they don't.  Repeat.  For some reason this story is told three times in succession, each one with more detail than the last.  You really only need to read the first one.  Fourth one: a player makes a character who is a bear named Mr. Bearington, and makes it so that he's so good at deception that he can make everyone think he's human.  He gets a butler to repeat all of his growls, translated into English.  Mr. Bearington gets knighted, and one person realizes that Sir Bearington is actually just a bear.  Of course no one believes this hapless fool."

EVEX,31xvrc,ProfessorCabbage,14,Thu Apr 9 00:33:12 2015 UTC,"From what I remember, the rule was put in place because a number of people simply reposted content from the big subs on /r/evex for upvotes. This both boring and annoying, and the rule served to discourage it."
EVEX,31xvrc,AgentLetrush,10,Thu Apr 9 10:40:55 2015 UTC,"I think the big idea behind the rule is to actually make it harder to post things that have already been posted before. In a way, it promotes new links or OC.  (Also it's not that hard to do a check if it's been posted before. Heck, reddit will even tell you if you link is already on a subreddit just by searching for the link.)  However, I'll let the community decide, I'll give an upvote."
EVEX,31xvrc,nospr2,8,Thu Apr 9 01:44:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure why this referendum was allowed. Removing a rule influences content, not procedure. The wiki even has an example specifically for this under ""What qualifies for a referendum?"":   5) Changing the process to remove rules   Not ""Remove a rule"", ""Change the process to remove rules"".   If we want to remove rules via referendum, we should first allow that by referendum, not just start it. That, btw, is allowed:   6) What is/isn't allowed in referendums   Edit: Right, paging /u/Bossman1086"
EVEX,31xvrc,Tobl4,3,Thu Apr 9 16:17:51 2015 UTC,"Apparently he thinks rule removal is more procedural than content-related. I assume the reasoning behind it is that the rules define the procedure whereby /r/Evex is run. While I'm not contrary to the idea he expresses, I think it might express more judicial activism than I think is favourable.  Also, his name only has one N"
EVEX,31xvrc,Forthwrong,2,Thu Apr 9 18:51:41 2015 UTC,"Alright. Let me explain.   As of right now, we don't have a set way to remove rules. We don't have any rule or referendum prohibiting removing rules, so I'm inclined to let people suggest removing rules. Referendums seem the best for for that. Not saying it's perfect, but in my view, it's more procedural than content based (as /u/Forthwrong suggested). Yes, the rules themselves are content-based, but the rules are procedures themselves determining how the sub is run.  Now, I'd like to make a caveat here. Rule suggestions that replace or tweak existing rules are allowed in the suggestion thread because they replace a rule with something else along the same lines (i.e. I don't want to prevent people from coming up with cool rules the community would like because there's already a rule that prevents it).   Finally, if you have ideas for how to handle rule removal, you're welcome to make a referendum to lay out a process for us to vote on (however, I won't be accepting any more referendums this week as we have a ton and the front page has a lot of official posts at the moment)."
EVEX,31xvrc,Sickmonkey3,11,Thu Apr 9 19:32:41 2015 UTC,"I would say no. If people get their posts removed because they did not read the rules, then too bad. Posters need to know the rules of the sub.   Wow, that sounded really callous."
EVEX,31xvrc,Forthwrong,1 point,Thu Apr 9 01:08:18 2015 UTC,"To respond to what you said: we currently have twelve rules, and they aren't necessarily designed to be intuitive and mutually consistent, as most sets of rules aspire to be (because they're designed to be democratic above all else).  But the question here isn't whether people or rules are superior to eachother; the question put forth by ProfessorCabbage is what the value is of rule 5 as a continued rule. Categorically saying it should remain a rule because it's currently a rule isn't exactly an argument; it's circular logic."
EVEX,31xvrc,Sickmonkey3,2,Thu Apr 9 05:46:28 2015 UTC,"So then we vote to abolish the rule. Be it by a suggestion or referendum. But if the posters complain about their posts being removed, it is their fault for not reading the rules."
EVEX,31xvrc,Forthwrong,1 point,Thu Apr 9 06:12:20 2015 UTC,"Ah, so you weren't using posters' complaints as reasoning for saying no.  Sorry, I misunderstood because you put it right after it."
EVEX,31xvrc,googolplexbyte,8,Thu Apr 9 06:23:04 2015 UTC,I like being forced to mark x-posts. It encourages people to visit other subs when they see content they like.  Example: This post  No mention of /r/ImaginaryWastelands which is a super interesting sub I wasn't aware of and wouldn't have been aware of if your referendum hadn't made me to think to check.  It's a simple enough task to find the original post. Took me two seconds to bung the link into search and find the original.
EVEX,31xvrc,nospr2,2,Thu Apr 9 11:27:52 2015 UTC,Maybe we could change the rule to at least ask users to post the x-post in the comments?

EVEX,31vl4s,Forthwrong,9,Wed Apr 8 14:33:11 2015 UTC,"I notice how you include head mod as an office, but not other mods, and I find this curious; I think there isn't a very large practical distinction between the positions of head moderator and moderator; so much so that reddit only distinguishes the head moderator in appearance by including them on the top of the mod list.  I think the tools the head mod has aren't radically different from those the other mods have, especially in comparison to the difference between the tools mods and non-mods have, so I think perhaps moderators should be included within this list.  It seems to me that the moderators are the Speakers of /r/Evex, so I think they should remain neutral."
EVEX,31vl4s,autowikibot,3,Wed Apr 8 17:57:41 2015 UTC,"Speaker (politics):       The term speaker is a title often given to the presiding officer (chair) of a deliberative assembly, especially a legislative body. The speaker's official role is to moderate debate, make rulings on procedure, announce the results of votes, and the like. The speaker decides who may speak and has the powers to discipline members who break the procedures of the house. The speaker often also represents the body in person, as the voice of the body in ceremonial and some other situations. The title was first recorded in 1377 to describe the role of Thomas de Hungerford in the Parliament of England.   By convention, Speakers are normally addressed in Parliament as Mister Speaker, if a man, or Madam Speaker, if a woman. In most other cultures other styles are used, mainly equivalents of English ""chairman"" or ""president"". In Canadian French, the Speaker of the House of Commons or of a legislature is referred to as Président.

EVEX,31yle8,Agothro,9,Thu Apr 9 04:05:51 2015 UTC,"To begin, I agree with the reasoning behind your suggestion, but I'm not certain about the method, and I'd like to ask a few questions I'm not clear about.  Historically, the only suggestions thus far that have amassed over 50% of the vote have been the monthly mod haiku suggestion, with 51.4%, and the [serious] discussions must be serious suggestion, with 66%. In light of this, will this referendum fundamentally change the fact that absolute majorities are a rarity in /r/Evex?  Per the above, a simple majority system would have only implemented two rules if it were applied from the start. In light of this, how does the current plurality system ""stifle the making of necessary rules?"" Are all rules other than those two unnecessary rules?  The winning rule is the rule that proves more popular than five other competing rules, of which all except ""no new rule"" were selected by being the most upvoted rules in the suggestion thread. In light of this, how does the current plurality system ""encourage the creation of extreneous of unpopular"" rules?"
EVEX,31yle8,Forthwrong,3,Thu Apr 9 05:35:30 2015 UTC,"It is true that this would only have us at two rules total in the 2 months we've been a sub. But people have also taken issue with rules going into effect that don't get support from the majority of the people voting.  That said, you do bring up another good point - the vote as it's set up now is meant to be 5 rules competing against each other to see which is the most popular, not which one the majority of voters agree with. The reason for this is because we have a two step voting process each week. The suggestion threads allow people to vote by upvoting on the rules they like without having to jump through hoops and verify a bunch of stuff like they do with the app. This is where community support is built up. We already have 5 rules gathered that we know the active members of the community support to some degree.   Anyway, I'm not saying this is a bad referendum. I like the idea of it a lot considering this is supposed to be a sub run by the community in terms of rules and content. But people should know before voting for or against this that this referendum going into effect will slow down the pace at which rules are added."
EVEX,31yle8,Bossman1086,1 point,Thu Apr 9 05:42:25 2015 UTC,"Will it slow the addition of rules? Probably, but perhaps not as much as thought (see my above post). But that's not necessarily a bad thing."
EVEX,31yle8,Bossman1086,2,Thu Apr 9 05:44:18 2015 UTC,Never said it was a bad thing. I'm not taking a stance on this referendum either way. I just want people to be aware of what it could mean for the sub. I'm sure there are members of the community that see value in slowing the pace of new rules somewhat. That's perfectly fine.
EVEX,31yle8,Forthwrong,0,Thu Apr 9 05:46:44 2015 UTC,"Well, as for your first point: I'm aware of this problem. While I personally believe that many of the rules are unnecessary, some (such as the one against racism) I support even though they did not attain a simple majority. Perhaps the addition of a simple majority rule will encourage people to vote for multiple rules more often, since now voting for a popular rule (such as ""no racism"") is at the expense of a secondary or petty rule. So the percentages aren't directly comparable if you ask me.   As for the last point, the rules could be considered extraneous. Since all rules have been supported by a significant minority, it demonstrates the de facto rule that a new restriction must be added each week."
EVEX,31yle8,googolplexbyte,4,Thu Apr 9 05:39:41 2015 UTC,"You raise a good point about how this referendum would, in all likelihood, make people vote less strategically and more honestly, and I agree with that principle.  The idea of range voting has been brought up a few times, and I think one of its benefits is that it'll increase honest voting by differentiating ""I'd be fine with this"" votes and ""I want this"" votes, and by how strategic voting strengthens the suggestions they dislike. So I'm led to ask, what would be the benefits of a simple majority system over a range system?"
EVEX,31yle8,nospr2,1 point,Thu Apr 9 06:33:05 2015 UTC,People already vote for multiple rules. Here are the number of rules people voted for on average for the past 3 votes:  12th vote: 2.3 rules  11th vote: 2.0 rules  10th vote: 2.1 rules  I'd say 2/5 rules is reasonable.

EVEX,31z3oh,holomanga,1 point,Thu Apr 9 07:52:34 2015 UTC,Radians make more sense mathematically.  It makes more sense to measure an angle around a circle in arc lengths that the angle creates in terms of the radius of that circle rather than units that the Babylonians came up with in 3000 B.C. that have no apparent relevance to anything.
EVEX,31z3oh,hexane360,1 point,Thu Apr 9 08:01:59 2015 UTC,"The pi refers to a half rotation in radians, but the only sensible way to derive angle is to divide arc length by radius, because otherwise it will have a unit. You could also write it as ei180/3602pi, meaning 180 out of 360 degrees times 2pi length/radius*radius of 1= pi.  You also need to use radians for calculus of trig functions to work, because otherwise the functions are scaled by a factor based on what arbitrary system you are using."

[citation needed]  Some terms which have evaded the Speaker's rules are:   Terminological inexactitude (lie) Being economical with the truth (lying by omission), since used on the floor of the house as an insult or taunt.   Clare Short implicitly accused the Employment minister Alan Clark of being drunk at the dispatch box shortly after her election in 1983, but avoided using the word, saying that Clark was ""incapable"". Clark's colleagues on the Conservative benches in turn accused Short of using unparliamentary language and the Speaker asked her to withdraw her accusation. Clark later admitted in his diaries that Short had been correct in her assessment.

Elaboration: Those who submit at least two posts of a certain type a week for a period of at least three weeks become eligible for special coloured flair showing the type of content (art, disc, gif, img, music, vid; to save space) and the number of consecutive weeks of their contribution streak  To save mods' work, these people would need to message the mods for each modification to their flair, with links to the appropriate contributions so that the mods don't need to trawl through the person's history to confirm it. To prevent spammers from getting this flair, submissions that are less than 51% upvoted will not count. This would also be applicable retroactively.  For example, let's say someone submits at least two discussion posts every week (defined as either a Monday–Sunday period or a Sunday–Saturday period, but must be defined consistently per person per type of content) for 7 weeks. This person would be eligible for flair saying ""Contribs: disc 7 weeks"".  This would stack with other sorts of contributions as well. Because it could get long, the type of content may be abbreviated to A, D, G, I, M, V and ""weeks"" may be removed. For example, somebody who contributes all types of content at least twice in each of 10 consecutive weeks would be eligible for: ""Contribs: A 10; D 10; G 10; I 10; M 10; V 10"". When it is appropriate to abbreviate a flair will be up to the mods' sensible judgement.  For the record, this would still be shorter than /u/googolplexbyte's current flair, but unlike his flair, these special flairs would require contribution.  Justification: This sub should see more content, and the acknowledgement of consistent contributors to this subreddit would provide a reason for people to contribute more consistently. More content would mean more activity within the subreddit.  The greater amount of content would also make it easier to think of relevant suggestions, thereby expediting the evolution of this sub.  This would not increase spam, as downvoted content would not count.  Expected effect: More content, more activity, more contribution.  See the top of the post source for information on how this is content-related and not procedural."
EVEX,31uc5i,UndauntedCouch,6,Wed Apr 8 17:44:41 2015 UTC,I feel like this would encourage needless submissions just to add to users' flairs rather than promoting discussion and the like.
EVEX,31uc5i,googolplexbyte,4,Wed Apr 8 13:01:43 2015 UTC,"So, essentially what googolplexbyte does, except with less frequency, meaning that sometimes it would be annoying, but sometimes it would be worthwhile. I think this increase in content would be a net positive; /r/Evex is far from having a problem of having too much content to deal with, and if we approach that point, we can ban more content, which is an easy option many other subs don't encourage as much as this one."
EVEX,31uc5i,zanderkerbal,6,Wed Apr 8 18:56:38 2015 UTC,a subreddit without flair is better meritocracy. People currently vote for content based on it's merit. I see no reason why we should change this.
EVEX,31uc5i,googolplexbyte,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:05:11 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree that meritocracy is good and we should try to be as meritocratic as possible, and the way I see it, there's nothing inherent to my suggestion that would undermine meritocracy.  How people vote on content is up to them (hopefully it's meritocratic), and how they let the things surrounding the post, like the submitter or their flair, affect their judgement is up to them. There's no correlation between the quantity of content a person has submitted and its quality; there are lots of people who submit a small amount of posts because they try to post quality things, but there are also lots of people who submit a lot of high-quality stuff."
EVEX,31uc5i,zanderkerbal,1 point,Wed Apr 8 20:58:19 2015 UTC,"Shorthand: Flair shall be limited to twenty characters or less.  Elaboration: In order to limit the clutter of our fine sub-reddit's front page, flair will now be capped at twenty characters.  Justification: Having free-form, original flair is one of the benefits of being an original, free-form sub-reddit. However, some users have gone overboard with their flair and it makes our posts and threads cluttered and ugly.  Expected effect: Flair would be short and concise while also being long enough for many words and phrases, and the front page of this sub-reddit will be less cluttered and easier to read."

This length should irritate less people who are tired of looooong flairs while still leaving room for creativity and expression.  Justification: Calling /u/googolplexbyte to demonstrate how super-long flairs are annoying.  Resulting change: People will no longer be driven crazy by overly long flairs.

EVEX,31uc5i,nospr2,-3,Thu Apr 9 19:13:00 2015 UTC,"Shorthand: All Nazi-related content must have a submission statement.  Elaboration: Similar to /r/Truereddit in general, /r/EVEX will require the OP make a comment justifying why the post deserves to be on the subreddit despite it's Nazi-related content.  Post that do not do this will be deleted immediately without warning. OP will be informed that their post broke this rule once this is done, and are invited to try again within the bounds of the rule.  If the post has a submission statement, but the statement is downvoted below 0, the post may also be reported and deleted at the moderators' digression.  Justification: An outright ban might be a bit much as it'd prevents some potentially quality content such as infographics of WWII tech, but requiring a submission statement filters out low quality posts and provides a self-regulating system. And allows the mods to crack-down on post that aren't explicitly within the reach of the ban on racism.  Change: Near complete removal of Nazi-related content, with the exception of some good stuff."
EVEX,31uc5i,zanderkerbal,3,Fri Apr 10 13:12:01 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by ""deserves to be on the subreddit""? What would be the criteria?"
EVEX,31uc5i,nospr2,3,Wed Apr 8 13:49:48 2015 UTC,It can be anything.   It's just a filter that ensures the poster actually cares enough about the post to defend it.
EVEX,31uc5i,zanderkerbal,3,Wed Apr 8 18:10:54 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply!  Do you see a wave of Nazi shitposting being a potential problem?
EVEX,31uc5i,pbrunk,3,Wed Apr 8 19:38:50 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but the problem might not be nazi content, but the formation of novelties in /r/Evex. Other novelties we've seen and tried to ban include image macros and cabbage. (Actually, I think we didn't see image macros before we tried banning them. Close enough.)

EVEX,31uc5i,briizo,-2,Thu Apr 9 18:14:02 2015 UTC,"edit: I will remake this as a suggestion in the future.  Shorthand: Remove rule 7.  Elaboration:  The current rule that states: ""Debates/arguments must be done in CAPS ONLY""  will be removed.  Justification: Rule 7 is ignored by the majority of users and is not enforced by the mods. If Rule 7 were enforced, it would discourage intelligent debates because many users are adverse to shouting their opinions through a keyboard. When someone occasionally does follow Rule 7, it detracts from the aesthetic quality of the subreddit.  Rule 7 has been our only large misstep and the time has come to make amends.

EVEX,31rxg7,Leader0fTheFreeWorld,5,Tue Apr 7 19:17:23 2015 UTC,The President would be someone who would presumably spend quite a bit of time on EVEX and know some of the issues that it faces.

Moreover, we should make the process of voting something better than first past the post voting in my opinion.

Perhaps a referendum and majority vote for impeachment is too lowly (though it has to make it past the referendum stage), can you think of a better system for it? I'll gladly add a more nuanced system if someone proposes one."
EVEX,31rxg7,Mouse_exe,3,Tue Apr 7 21:15:11 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I missed that on my first readthrough. My concern with moderator-selected Q&A is twofold: it can give too much power to the mods in terms of what issues are addressed and it fails to facilitate direct dialogue between candidates.   A good system might be to have users submit questions and have the mods pick a large number (say, 50) and have users vote in a poll about which ought to be asked. This gives the people more of a say in which issues the candidates will address.  In terms of facilitating intercandidate dialogue, having the opportunity to attack opposing candidates' arguments might be a simple solution to make sure the debate remains lively and interesting.   Concerning impeachment: I think simply upping the required threshold might be a good way to handle it, i.e. a simple majority on a referendum to impeach, but a 75% majority to actually kick the President out of office.   Finally: are moderators allowed to run for office? It seems there could be a potential conflict of interest if they were allowed to do so."
EVEX,31rxg7,nospr2,2,Tue Apr 7 21:25:10 2015 UTC,"I would propose that the mods create and sticky the debate thread and leave the question asking to the members of the community, with the candidates themselves deciding which questions to answer.   A 75% seems a bit too high, would 60% work better? That shows a clear majority favoring the removal of the sitting president.   As for moderators running for President, I presume they would have to give up their powers as moderator to run for President. They could take on the powers again when their term ends."
EVEX,31rxg7,alien122,2,Tue Apr 7 21:29:42 2015 UTC,I do think that 50% (the current referendum system) is fine to impeach the president.

Range is also much more likely to confuse voters.  But I've never heard many people compare the two, so I'm curious what the range supporters think!"

EVEX,31qftc,LittleHelperRobot,3,Tue Apr 7 12:46:33 2015 UTC,"Range is also much more likely to confuse voters.   From the voters perspective this is objectively false. Spoilage rate is the percentage of ballots that are incorrectly filled out rendering them invalid.  Approval: 0.5%, Range: 1%, Plurality: 2%, IRV: 5%.  Source  If the range vote allows for abstains, then range vote ballot can mark spoiled sections as abstains. This allows range vote to have an even better spoilage rate than approval.   Do you feel that range voting is a better system than the alternative vote?   It is a fact that Range voting is objectively the best voting system for single-winner elections.  Approval is joint best if there's enough strategic voters.  Plurality is joint best if we limit it to 2-candidate elections (though plurality is the cause of 2-candidate elections, so screw that).  Here are some reasons why IRV pales in comparison to Range voting;  '1. Basic Functionality  In range voting, if any set of voters increase a candidate's score, it obviously can help him, but cannot hurt him. That is called monotonicity.  Analysis by W.D.Smith shows that about 15% of 3-candidate IRV elections are non-monotonic.   That means voting for a candidate can hurt their chances, and voting against them can help them!  '2. Simplicity.  Another measure of simplicity is how easy it is to calculate the winner.  Range voting also is simpler in the sense that it requires fewer operations to perform an election. In a V-voter, N-candidate election, range voting takes roughly 2VN operations. However, IRV voting takes roughly that many operations every 2 rounds. In a 135-candidate election like California Gubernatorial 2003, IRV would require about 67 times as many operations. (In fact, range voting is simple enough that it could be done with hand calculators, if necessary.)  '3. 2-party domination  In an election like Bush v Gore v Nader 2000, voters exaggerate their opinions of Bush and Gore by artificially ranking them first and last, even if they truly feel the third-party candidate Nader is best or worst. Nader automatically has to go in the middle slot,as there is no other option in IRV. The winner will be either Bush or Gore as a result. Nader can never win an IRV election with strategic voters.  The countries that used IRV as of 2002, (Ireland, Australia, Fiji, and Malta) all are 2-party dominated in their IRV seats.  Analogously, in range voting, if the voters exaggerate and give Gore=99 and Bush=0 (or the reverse), then they are still free to give Nader 99 or 0 or anything in between. Consequently, it would still be entirely possible for Nader to clearly win with range, and without need of any kind of tie, and even if every single voter is acting in this exaggerating way.  The ""National Election Study"" showed that in 2000, among US voters who honestly liked Nader better than every other candidate, fewer than 1 in 10 actually voted for Nader. These voters did not wish to ""waste their vote"" and wanted ""maximum impact"" so they voted either Bush or Gore as their favorite.  Here is a proof that this kind of insincere-exaggerating voter-strategy is strategically-optimal 100% of the time with IRV voting.  '4. Ties & near-ties  Remember how Bush v Gore, Florida 2000, was officially decided by only 537 votes, and this caused a huge lawsuit and chad-examining crisis? Ties and near-ties are bad. In IRV there is potential for a tie or near-tie every single round. That makes the crisis-potential inherent in IRV much larger than it has to be. That also means that in IRV, every time there is a near-tie among two no-hope candidates, we have to wait, and wait, and wait, until we have the exact vote totals for the Flat-Earth candidate and for the Alien-Kidnapping candidate since every last absentee ballot has finally arrived... before we can finally decide which one to eliminate in the first round. Only then can we proceed to the second round. We may not find out the winner for a long time. The precise order in which the no-hopers are eliminated matters because it can affect the results of future rounds in a repeatedly amplifying manner.  Don't think this will happen? In the CA gubernatorial recall election of 2003,     D. (Logan Darrow) Clements got 274 votes, beating Robert A. Dole's 273.  Then later on in the same election,     Scott W. Davis got 382 votes, beating Daniel W. Richards's 381.  Then later on in the same election,     Paul W. Vann got 452 and Michael Cheli 451 votes.  Then later on in the same election,     Kelly P. Kimball got 582 and Mike McNeilly 581 votes.  Then later on in the same election,     Christopher Ranken got 822 and Sharon Rushford 821 votes.  Ugh! Stop, Arnie wins.  Meanwhile, in range voting, the only thing that matters is the top scorer. Ties for 5th place, do not matter in the sense they do not lead to crises. Furthermore, because all votes are real numbers 0-99 rather than discrete and from a small set, exact ties are even less likely still. Exact ties in range elections can thus be rendered extremely unlikely, while exact ties (or within 1) in IRV elections can be extremely likely. Which situation do you prefer?  '5. Communication needs  Suppose a 1,000,000-voter N-candidate election is carried out at 1000 different polling locations, each with 1000 voters. In range voting, each location can then compute its own subtotal N-tuple and send it to the central agency, which then adds up the subtotals and announces the winner.   That is very simple. That is a very small amount of communication (1000·N numbers), and all of it is one-way. Furthermore, if some location finds it made a mistake or forgot some votes, it can send a corrected subtotal, and the central agency can then easily correct the full total by doing far less work than everybody completely redoing everything.  But in IRV voting, we cannot do these things because IRV is not additive. There is no such thing as a ""subtotal"" in IRV. In IRV every single vote may have to be sent individually to the central agency (1,000,000·N numbers, i.e. 1000 times more communication).  If the central agency then computes the winner, and then some location sends a correction, that may require redoing almost the whole computation over again. There could easily be 100 such corrections and so you'd have to redo everything 100 times. Combine this scenario with a near-tie and legal and extra-legal battle like in Bush-Gore Florida 2000 over the validity of every vote, and this adds up to a complete nightmare for the election administrators.  '6. Voter Expressivity  In range voting, voters can express the idea that they think 2 candidates are equal. In IRV, they cannot.  A lot of voters want to just vote for one candidate, plurality-style. In range voting they can do that by voting (99,0,0,0,0,0). In IRV, they can't do it.  Range voters can express the idea they are ignorant about a candidate. In IRV, they can't choose to do that.  IRV voters who decide, in a 3-candidate election, to rank A top and B bottom, then have no choice about C – they have to middle-rank him and can in no way express their opinion of C. In range voting, they can.  If you think Buddha>Jesus>Hitler, undoubtably some of your preferences are more intense than others. Range voters can express that. IRV voters cannot.  '7. Bayesian Regret (Voter Happiness)  Extensive computer simulations of millions of artificial ""elections"" by W.D.Smith show that range voting is the best single-winner voting system, among a large number compared by him (including IRV, Borda, Plurality, Condorcet, Eigenvector, etc.) in terms of a statistical yardstick called ""Bayesian regret"". This is true regardless of whether the voters act honestly or strategically, whether the number of candidates is 3,4, or 5, whether the number of voters is 5 or 200, whether various levels of ""voter ignorance"" are introduced, and finally regardless of which of several randomized ""utility generators"" are used to generate election scenarios.  Smith's papers on voting systems are available here  '8. A bunch of stupid little things about IRV;  simple winner=loser IRV paradox   Another   IRV is self-contradictory   IRV ignores votes   IRV can't be counted with a lot of existing voting equipment     There aren't many things I think are objectively true. I'm a mathematic fictionalist ffs. But range voting is objectively the best voting system."

EVEX,31qftc,the_mollusque,1 point,Tue Apr 7 22:07:17 2015 UTC,"Instant-runoff voting:       Instant-runoff voting (IRV), alternative vote (AV), transferable vote, ranked choice voting, or preferential voting is an electoral system used to elect a single winner from a field of more than two candidates. It is a preferential voting system in which voters rank the candidates in order of preference rather than voting for a single candidate.  Ballots are initially distributed based on each elector's first preference. If a candidate secures more than half of votes cast, that candidate wins. Otherwise, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. Ballots assigned to the eliminated candidate are recounted and added to the totals of the remaining candidates based on who is ranked next on each ballot. This process continues until one candidate wins by obtaining more than half the votes.  IRV has the effect of avoiding split votes when multiple candidates earn support from like-minded voters. For example, suppose there are two similar candidates A & B, and a third opposing candidate C, with raw popularity of 35%, 25% and 40% respectively. In a plurality voting system candidate C may win with 40% of the votes, even though 60% of electors prefer either A or B. Alternatively, voters are pressured to choose the seemingly stronger candidate of either A or B, despite personal preference for the other, in order to help ensure defeat of C. It is often the resulting situation that candidate A or B would never get to ballot, whereas voters would be presented a two candidate choice. With IRV, the electors backing B as their first choice can allocate their preferences as #1 for B and #2 for A, which means A will win despite the split vote in first choices.  Instant-runoff voting is used to elect members of the Australian House of Representatives and most Australian State Governments,  the President of India, members of legislative councils in India, the President of Ireland,  and the parliament in Papua New Guinea. It is also used in Northern Ireland by-elections and for electing hereditary peers for the British House of Lords.   The system is also used in local elections around the world: to elect the mayor in cities such as London in the United Kingdom (in the variant known as supplementary vote)  and Dunedin and Wellington in New Zealand.  Variations of instant-runoff voting are employed by several jurisdictions in the United States, including San Francisco,  San Leandro, and Oakland in California;  Portland, Maine; Minneapolis and Saint Paul in Minnesota.  The single transferable vote, a multi-seat form of IRV, is used in Cambridge, Massachusetts.   It is used to elect the leaders of the Labour Party  and the Liberal Democrats in the United Kingdom and was used in elections in 2013 for the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada  and in Canada's New Democratic Party leadership election, 2012.  Many private associations also use IRV,  including the Hugo Awards for science fiction  and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in selection of the Oscar for best picture.  IRV is described in Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised, 10th edition..
