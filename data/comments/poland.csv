I personally prefer nature than churches, some info would be nice. Anyway.  1) never rented a car, however used a rented car 3 times as part of my car assistance package. No problems. As for roads, they are not the best, also not terrible. Definitely not for total car newbies, however the road from Wroclaw to Kraków is a highway so no problems there.  2) Not really, depends what she wants to see. I like Kudowa zdrój and those areas, plus Adrspaskie skaly are close, so she could try this, but mostly for nature seeing. Czestochowa could also be visited if one loves churches, however this is quite a detour.  3) Zakopane is definitlly worth a couple days stay (for nature lovers) - however it depends on the timeframe. Summer and so called long weekends are time of massive people congestion there.  4) in what area?  5) I quite like ardspaske skaly, they are ok. I don't really know Czech Republic."

Along with:  Białowieża Forest  Częstochowa - to see the Black Madonna is one of Catholicism most profound pilgrimages The Baltic Sea  Warsaw - because it's the capital  Any of the ranges of the Carpathian Mountains like the Tatra Mountains which contain the highest peaks  I'm biased towards favouring natural heritage landmarks, but it's also worth seeing the museums and architecture found in major cities, castles in the countryside, factories and mines, and breweries.  There used to be a famous Oak tree called Bartek but they cut him down.   I would also recommend taking time to see the Vistula river, preferably near the mouth at Gdansk on the Baltic.

I strongly recommend you seeing this movie. Dom zły (2008) - it's strong, it's dark, it's brutal. And it's a good movie too. Bogowie (2014) Krótki film o zabijaniu (1988) - or his TV counterpart Dekalog V - ""A short film about killing"", that's what it is. Young murderer, young lawyer, murder and capital punishment. Vabank (1981) - comedy. Warsaw, 1930s, legendary safecracker is plotting the revenge against his old friend, who sent him to jail. Psy (1992) - kurwa, kurwa, kurwa (a lot of swearing in this one) Jak rozpętałem drugą wojnę światową (1970) - trilogy about young soldier who thinks he started the WWII. Lighthearted comedy. C.K. Dezerterzy (1986) - comedy about a group of soldiers in Austro-Hungarian army. Zaklęte rewiry (1975) Chłopaki nie płaczą(2000) - some more ""modern"" polish humor ;) Amator (1979) Wielki szu (1983) Nie lubię poniedziałku (1971) Dzień świra (2002) Miś (1981) - as some may say - most famous comedy in Poland, but probably hard to understand for a foreginer. Baza ludzi umarłych (1959) Ogniem i mieczem (1999)"
poland,3e41ut,FarewellPancakes,3,Tue Jul 21 22:02:47 2015 UTC,"Really depends on what type of movies you're into, but here are some examples:  Potop (1974) 1655 war/love movie with big budget, nominated for an Oscar. Based on books written in 1886 to raise the spirit of Polish people, who at the time were under foreign control. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072021/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 Potop Redivivus specifically, which is a 2014 remastered Blue Ray version.    Miasto 44 (2014) , If you want a modern war movie about 18 year old volunteers fighting in WW2 to liberate Warsaw.  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3765326/    Dzien Swira (2002) comedy that is liked by almost everyone. A regular day in a crazy, frustrated, grumpy 50yo man's life. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0330243/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1    Kingsajz (1988) Comedy about dual worlds of regular reality and the world of tiny dwarves. Funny, good set design and such. Since made in 1988, probably a commentary on communism. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095452/    For more artsy movies, which usually don't use Polish as the spoken language, I'd recommend movies by Kieslowski or Polanski.  I can recommend more if you have any specific genre or time period in mind.  Edit: Here's a list of highly rated polish movies: http://www.filmweb.pl/rankings/film/poland"
poland,3e41ut,Rafcio,3,Tue Jul 21 21:43:27 2015 UTC,Seksmisja (1984) - Probably my favourite Polish comedy
poland,3e41ut,Reeposter,3,Tue Jul 21 23:55:54 2015 UTC,"Well TBH, most of titles given here are something Polish people would understand and like. I know i tried to show the most cult status comedies and thrillers to foreigners and they didnt like it - Killer, Sexmission, Psy etc. Better start with something more slapstick-like, less dialogue idiom dependent, like ""How I started 2nd world war""  If you go after internationally acclaimed movies the answer is pretty short:   Three Colors: Red Blue White (3 separate movies) The Pianist Most recent would be ""Ida"". Double life of Veronique, (or something like that) Decalogue movie shorts.   Those are movies I can actually talk about about with intelectuals in almost any country in the world.  For more folksy, but modern (and not totally boring):   Americans tend to like ""Quo Vadis"", especially The Bible Belt Quintesence of traditional polishness seems to be ""Pan Tadeusz"", costumes, culture and whatnot."

poland,3e4bzz,Wryx,6,Tue Jul 21 21:20:01 2015 UTC,"theguardian.com   Thanks for the warning, bracing myself for shitty journalism   “We don’t want terrorists here,” the Polish pensioner says, when asked about EU plans to resettle refugees more broadly across the continent. “Have you seen what they’re doing in the west?” [...] A recent survey for the television station TVN found that two-thirds of Poles share the same hostility towards immigrants expressed by the Warsaw grandmother cited above.   Common tactic, present the biggest caricature of an argument, then claim everyone on that side show the ""same"" opinion. The question is, are 2/3rds of Pole afraid of terrorists, or are they simply saying very lax immigration policy has brought more harm than good?   According to a study in 2013 by the Centre for Research on Prejudice – a professional academic centre at the University of Warsaw – as many as 69% of Poles do not want non-white people living in their country.   And I'm sure a Centre for Research on Heresy will find an astounding number of people who worship, or see no harm in worshipping, the devil. Are they seriously suggesting that the average Pole has more sympathy towards Russians than Japanese? Unfortunately, without a direct citation to the survey in question, it's not clear at what level the numbers were fudged to make Polish people look like evil racists.   Some of Poland’s partners note that it has done very well out of EU membership. Now is the time to give back.   What does accepting immigrants from non-european countries have to do with ""giving back"" to the EU? What I think he's suggesting is that European subsidies in the past should now compel Poland to disregard the will of its citizens and accepts edicts drafted in Brussels. And then people wonder why so many have an anti-european attitude. Maybe because it sounds a bit too close to the PRL?   About 5,500 cases were dismissed, primarily because refugees were trying to reach western Europe, particularly Germany.   So it seems like the only people really wanting those refugees to come to Poland are European politicians. Again, it seems to be the will of a tiny minority over that of the majority on both sides.   Nobody has ever tried to explain to Polish people that one of the moral and formal obligations of EU countries is to help those who seek shelter because they are persecuted,” says Weronika Rokicka from Amnesty International Polska.   I can't find anything on formal obligations, but there is another problem. Does she really think that informing the Polish people that belonging to the EU forces them to accept as many immigrants as Brussels has decided will convince the euroskeptics?   Surveys show that for a majority of Poles the world’s problems should should be dealt with by someone else.   Jeez, in light of Poland's history, I wonder why!"

poland,3dtach,LeBoringJack,6,Sun Jul 19 06:20:44 2015 UTC,"""Lenczner"" looks like a polonized spelling of the original German/Yiddish ""Lentschner""/""Lentshner"", which, as others suggest, may mean ""from Łęczna"" or ""from Łęczno"". ""Lentsch"" is also a German(ized) name of the village Łączki (""Little Meadows"") in Upper Silesia (currently the Opole voivodship).   The root ""łęcz-"" is palatalized form of ""łąka"", meaning meadow. As you can imagine, there may be many places named after a meadow, so without more information it may be hard to find the real source. It might as well be that it's not related to any Łęczno/Łączki at all."
poland,3dtach,_marcoos,5,Sun Jul 19 22:25:21 2015 UTC,"If you wanted to dig in what is the literal meaning of the word in Polish then the answer is nothing - it does not mean anything in Polish (the word or it's stem does not represent anything in particular) - bare in mind there also might be a hint of some geographical location that I'm not aware of (perhaps a village or mansion called Lencz) - back in the days people would name others with their crafts or locations - (e.g. Mathew from Lencz would soon become Lenczewski or Lenczer). If not, then my guess is you should try with r/Hebrew meaning.  Good luck!"
poland,3dtach,mparzuchowski,3,Sun Jul 19 06:51:42 2015 UTC,"For me looks like this is a Jewish surname of a german origin, so the alternative spelling would be: Lenchner.  Edit: I'm not an expert, but I might come from term ""fuedal""."

poland,3dtach,ajuc,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:25:55 2015 UTC,"It's possible that it comes from the town Łęczna ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%81%C4%99czna ) in Lubelskie region.  Łęczna is pronounced almost like Lenczna, and there are some Jewish last names made from places the German way (Lubliner,  etc).  Do you know if your family lived in this region in Poland?  It could also come from the same thing that named Łęczna - for exampe Łąki (plural from łąka = meadow), or Łęgi ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood-meadow ). But IMHO it comes from a town name most probably, otherwise it wouldn't conserve the Polish ""cz"" with German suffix.  I doubt it's from Hebrew or Yiddish, because ""cz"" is specific to Polish language."
poland,3dtach,ajuc,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:32:21 2015 UTC,I believe we were from around Szczecin...
poland,3dtach,Beck2012,2,Sun Jul 19 12:36:17 2015 UTC,"That's weird, Szczecin was German between 14th and 20th century. Very strange for ""cz"" to be preserved."
poland,3dtach,I_scare_children,2,Sun Jul 19 12:52:17 2015 UTC,"No, it's not strange, a lot of Germans have Slavic surnames - not only from Pomerania, but also from Brandenburg or Magdeburg. Those territories were quite Slavic up until 13th century."
poland,3dtach,DieMensch-Maschine,2,Mon Jul 20 12:56:44 2015 UTC,"Oh, come on. This is not at all Slavic - it's clearly a Germanic name.   A Germanic name in Poland is most probably either German or Yiddish. Lenczner uses ""cz"", which is typical of the Polish spelling (it used to occur in other Western Slavic languages, too, but was replaced by č) - so it's certainly not the original spelling of that surname.  Now, there are two possibilities worth considering. 1. The Lentschner (or something like that) family were Germans who lived in Poland for a very, very long time and for some chose to adopt the Polish spelling for their surname; 2. The לנצ'נר (or something like that) family were Jews living close to Poles, so when they needed to transliterate their name into the Latin alphabet, they used the Polish orthography.  Since Jews living in Poland had a much better reason to change the spelling of their name (different alphabets and shit), I think the latter option is the most probable one. Yiddish names with Polish spelling are pretty common, and it looks just like another one.  The name Łęczna sounds like a very probable source of this surname: לנצ'נר sounds just as a Yiddish name derived from Łęczna would, and there was a Jewish community there: (link in Polish)"

The big thing about living & studying in Cracow for me is a certain nostalgia I've recently started experiencing, the feeling of being connected to the past generations through the rich history and every old street of the city.  Btw. polish girls really do look above average, but that's something I wouldn't realize if I never visited UK. Insert something about lucky dna mixing here."

poland,3dexk2,losprohlos,3,Wed Jul 15 19:07:38 2015 UTC,"Best place to visit is definitely Gdańsk Old Town. There's a lot of old things to see, so the idea is just to walk the streets and enter the buildings that you're interested in.  If you're interested in some more modern history then I'd recommend Westerplatte (place where the II World War started) and Gdańsk Shipyard/European Solidarity Centre (museum of Solidarity). Shipyard is near the Old Town and you can get to the Westerplatte if you take a cruise from the fish market in Old Town (near the Hilton Hotel). I think it takes about 2 hours.  If you're interested in nightlife or sunbathing then you should visit Sopot. It's considered the clubbing centre of Poland and it has the best beaches (they might little crowded, though). Sopot is a town next to Gdańsk. It takes about 30 min to get there by train from the main Gdansk station. Monte Cassino street and other next to it are a place to party. Gdańsk is great if you're more interested in pubs, there's not so many clubs. Piwna street in the Old Town and the whole area around it are where you should go in the evening (it translates into Beer street :)). It's easy to find, because it's next to the biggest church around.  If you have time to see something away from the Tricity area, then the best place would be either Malbork castle (the largest castle in the world) or Hel peninsula. I think the train is the fastest way to get to both of these places.  If you have any questions feel free to ask :)"

For example, ""I think I saw what love is."" would (roughly) translate into ""Myślę, że zobaczyłem czym jest miłość"". Go ahead and try to read it. Sure, we can go for phonetic spelling, but could you read all that?   Second, the toasts as such are traditionally shorter - I'm assuming the Bali wedding would not be 'garden variety' Polish kind, but still I seriously doubt anyone will expect 3 paragraphs worth of toast. I understand what you're going for here, but combined with first part I'd suggest shortening it.  The ""outs"" I see here is either you thinking of something shorter (and simpler), or going with the original toast in English and finishing it with 1-2 sentences in Polish. Or you can go for entire text in Polish, and just deal with all the headaches pronunciation."

Don't forget to visit:  -Warsaw Rising museum - A absolute must to understand the city and it's people. 85% of Warsaw was destroyed during WW2, including almost 100% of all historical monuments, buildings etc. So keep in mind that places like the Old Town and the Royal Palace may look old, but are in fact no older than ~65 years. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Uprising_Museum  -Visit the Old Town and it's surroundings- It may not be older than aprox. 65 years but it is still the social, cultural and historical centre of the city. There are many things to see and do. Two tips from me would be: Lapidarium, verry interesting store with lots of antiques and collectibles and try out one of the Zapiecek restaurants. They serve some of the most delicious Polish dumplings!(there are like 4 restaurants in The Old town, you will surely find it.) http://www.zapiecek.eu/main.html http://www.lapidarium.pl/index.php  -Go to the top of the palace of science & culture- For a ticket that costs aprox. 12 PLN and be bought at the main entrance, you can go with a elevator to the top to see a beautiful panorama of the city. Don't forget to bring a camera! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Culture_and_Science  -Visit Royal Łazienki park- It's a verry nice park to get away from the big city and it's the most popular one in Warsaw. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%81azienki_Park  those are some, but certainly not all the places, that i would absolutely recommend."

But I was talking about the famous reconstruction of the Old Town district and the Old Town Market Place, which were deliberately reconstructed after 17th century paintings (not even prewar photographs!) out of ideological reasons. Sure, there are many places worth visiting in the capital and its neighbourhood (like Zelazowa Wola or the Wilanow Palace Museum), but overall you won't find much of real, palpable history in the city.

I know that there are a number of Polish people who were very kind to Jews during the Holocaust but it's possible that ""Poland = place with death camps"" got embedded into my subconscious. In the 6.5 months I've been here I've found Poland to be only slightly more anti-Semitic than the U.S. (Some graffiti mostly, plus an insanely ultra-nationalistic co-worker)   Combining that with a Western misconception that all of Eastern Europe is full of Slavic gangsters and ethnic conflict despite incredibly homogeneous nations can lead to the idea that Poland is some backwards village country. I've found it isn't the case for the vast majority and talking to young Polish people can be like talking to Americans. They just want to get drunk and watch Breaking Bad like any normal Westerner.  Sorry if this rambling, I'm still having trouble organizing exactly how I feel about Poland, but I've got another whole year to figure it out."

(The ""Christkilling"" vein of anti-semitism is one of the strangest and I feel pretty easy to counter but trying to use logic on bigots can be difficult) I mean she's made other racist and homophobic comments which don't directly affect me but just lends to the ""ultra-nationalist"" label I've given her in my head.  The graffiti is about what you say usually. Back when the elections were happening I noticed a number Duda posters were defaced with six pointed stars of David (Jewish stars if you will) and I've seen this star pretty regularly sprayed in random places with no context around it. The only out and out graffiti I've seen was a sticker on a parking meter of a Jewish star with a circle and line through it, but this was one instance and I won't judge Poland as a whole on it."

poland,3ddeau,Baabenchier,6,Wed Jul 15 11:51:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry dude, but these soap operas are not really going to do you any good. They show not existing environments, no real people talk like ones in those series and acting is terrible. Also, it has about 1500 episodes, so I don't think there would be anybody, who would dare to translate so much text to English. On the other hand, frankly these series are meant for middle-aged/elder women, so the language is pretty basic here, so if you know the language just a bit.  Also, if you already know the language a bit, you may try watching some of these: http://www.tvp.pl/dostepnosc/filmy-z-napisami-w-serwisie-tvppl?id=&start_rec=0  These clips have Polish subtitles. These are free episodes of Wojciech Cejrowski's show, where he talks about travelling, other cultures and so on. I don't agree with what Cejrowski has to say about politics and so on, but his travelling videos are quite interesting and worthwhile.  Anyway, try looking for some shows prepared for people suffering from hearing impairment - they have additional Polish subtitles."
poland,3ddeau,spoko22,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:15:38 2015 UTC,"As I'm still kinda at the beginner-level, I chose this series as it's really basic-sounding and looking, and the speech is slow-paced and clear-ish. That's why catching words and phrases here and there feels really easy, as long as I'd undestand the meaning of the words...   I'll look later into the series you mentioned, thanks for that, but until I reach the level where I understand several sentences before getting into totally unknown word, I think I'll just stick with the series meant for all ages, maybe more focused to elder people...  Unless, ofc, there's a series with english subtitles. :)"

In the meantime watch some episodes of Wyjechani, a documentary series about Poles abroad: http://vod.tvp.pl/dokumenty/spoleczenstwo/wyjechani  As for M jak Miłość: I couldn't agree more with the other repliers, but, however awful, for a beginner I think it is good material because in contains a lot of vocabulary that's very common in daily use.  Also: start taking learning Polish a bit more seriously by taking a proper course. An absolute beginner's course will already be tremendously helpful. I know what I'm talking about. ;)"

There's a bunch of caves you can explore there now in addition to the traditinoal stuff. We usually ride our bikes from Zielonki to there.

(Industrial-ish buildings - probably one of the ghettos, and if you explore a bit, you'll find a path paved with Jewish gravestones). Also, when walking to the Kopiec from Krakow, there's a footbridge over a highway. Look back at the highway -- along it, there's a cool mural depicting the history of Poland.  The bike path along the Wisla to Tyniec is quite nice. Or if you're lazy (or on a date), you can take a water-taxi.  Oh, and if you want some ice cream, the best place is in Kazimerez, near the new (5-ish years old) footbridge across the Wisla. They have just a few flavors at at time, mostly fruit, and they're always awesome, and there's always a long line. I don't think they have a name - the sign just says ""Lody"".

There are two viable paths, one is here and descends near the WWII work camp remains, the other easy one is here (ignore the shitty google maps path - there's an overgrown path directly between these points. The latter is more muddy and overgrown. The remains of the Schindler's list set can be seen everywhere, especially here (the tombstone path). There is also no cell phone service in half of that quarry, so bring a friend in case something happens.  The actual Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp site is here.

I always try to visiting as much as possible, but i need to find more of the beaten path places to visit. Personally I would recommend Nowa Huta and the surrounding area. My family lives  nearby and I am there on a daily bases when I visit my family. Go see the Nowa Huta steel plant, the ronald reagan square and experience some history. It isn't well known but it's full of history. My best advice is: just go hop on a random bus/bike and hop out at some random place or drive through the rural land. You will certainly always see something new and interesting. Especially the rural area is beautiful! got to the Tyniec monastery on bike. It's amazing how rural it can be so close to the city."

poland,3d9pcq,Cxplorer,6,Tue Jul 14 16:25:13 2015 UTC,"One of the bands that I've seen a couple times, that always put on a great show is łąki łan - (link to one of my favorite songs). They are awesome in concert. People wear costumes like they do on stage. It's one big party. I highly recommend it.   On being black: One of my friends is an English teacher here from California. I asked him once if people treat him differently because of his dark skin. He said that they don't and are usually very polite.   However, there was one time when we went out to the bars, and as he was riding the train to meet me, he almost got into a fight with three drunk guys asking him for money. He didn't give them any and also didn't back down from the fight, which caught the guys a little off-guard. There was a minor scuffle in which he came out of it unscathed after someone on the train intervened and broke it up (the train conductor, iirc), but he was visibly worked up over the whole situation. He's not a violent guy, so I could see that it sort of got to him.   I have also met some black Poles who do come across a little bit of racism from time to time, but they have also told me that racist interactions come few and far between.   My advice would be to just watch out for drunk people. And I'd stay away with anyone with a shaved head wearing sweat pants or a tracksuit. Those usually end up being not-the-best of characters, stereotypically speaking.  What city are you visiting anyway?  TL;DR - łąki łan is a fun band. Being black in Poland isn't as big a deal anymore as it used to be; you should be fine."

Now, I was in Warsaw the capital, I recommend it too. A lot of museums, parks, palaces, Old Town Square is really nice, just explore! Unfortunately it was fully destroyed during the war, but they managed to do and keep nice memorials and palaces you can visit. I loved it. About night life in Warsaw, can't help cause I didn't try.

poland,3d8n52,Makdaam,0,Wed Jul 15 11:26:58 2015 UTC,"We were watching a documentary about yivabne(?)(the town where the poles murdered all the Jews in the town by burning them in a barn) and a man there said something that I think shows how Jews see Poland during the war. He said that he was asked by polish media if Jews hate Poland because of what happened in the barn. He replied: ""we remember other barns too"""
poland,3d8n52,O5KAR,2,Wed Jul 15 11:48:03 2015 UTC,"The barns in which many Jews were hideing? I guess he thought about something opposite... Jedwabne is still controvercial, it's not clear what was the role of Germans in it, just that they were there too. Anyway, this is dramatic exception, even if there were other incidents most of people refused to collaborate in occupation and many risked their lives by opposing it. Most of all, the Polish goverment and underground were active at aiding the Jews and that was not just ""Żegota"", they were the first to investigate and report about the ghettos and death camps. Nobody wanted to belive, British and Americans thought that's just anti German propaganda."

My great-grandpa was railroad engineer, all of them together with police and fireguard were mobilised and thretened with executions if they refuse to follow the orders. He was driving people to the camps and few times hid several of them in the coal.  The war and occupation was absolutelly devastating for everybody, but it was a long time ago. It's absolutelly impossible to compare these times with todays."

We were warned that if we find something that doesn't belong in our hotel room we should assume that it is a bomb... The reason is that if something does happen many parents won't let their children go to the trip.

I once saw a map of Israel (for teachers) deciding Israel into zones based on what type of security you need to take.

poland,3d8n52,TedKacz,13,Wed Jul 15 05:28:20 2015 UTC,"What incident with the Italian?   There was an Italian tourist beat up by Israeli school trip guards in Kraków.   even a guard just for show makes our parents feel much better about sending thier kids abroad   This is a problem. ""abroad"" is usually much safer than for example a trip to Jerusalem. Sending a guard with a trip abroad just reinforces the stereotypes that everyone wants to kill/kidnap Israelis.   Also, every school trip, even in Israel is accompanied by an armed guard.   The fact that every school trip in Israel is accompanied by a guard doesn't mean that the same should be done here. If there's risk in a non-warzone setting the guards should be more discreet. Poland is not a war zone, we don't have missle raids, we don't have people blowing themselves up at checkpoints."

Reading some of articles in Jewish press and watching some documentaries I have impression that people responsible for organization of your trips are trying to portray Poles as eternal anti-semites. Many times occurs situation like in the 'Defamation' movie: You are warned about imaginary threats and you are not allowed to speak with locals. Even if you are trying to talk to locals, you do not know Polish language but you know what we are saying. Just look:https://youtu.be/NlmXRNEDWiY?t=1119 . It is quite biased attitude IMHO.

poland,3d8n52,Aintence,9,Tue Jul 14 20:49:01 2015 UTC,"Yes Poland suffered at the hands of the Nazi's and we certainly weren't collaborators. Unfortunately many people seem to think that the Poles helped out. I'm not sure why this idea has become popular. The other day someone posted a video showing what Israeli Jews thought about Poland. Many of them said they believed Poland helped the Nazis.   I also watched a mini series on Netflix about the second world war from the perspective of 4 German friends. In that series they some how managed to portray the Poles as being more antisemitic than the Germans, despite, you know, the whole Nazi Jew hating thing. If I'm not mistake the Polish government took serious offence to it. I also have a friend who is well read to whom I had to explain that Poland did not contribute to the holocaust and that in fact thousands of Poles risked their lives to save Jews.  And finally I had a history professor who also argued that Poland was complacent during the holocaust.  For what ever reason Poland's contributions during that period of history have become muddled and instead people seem to think we were worse than the Germans."
poland,3d8n52,ajuc,6,Tue Jul 14 21:27:27 2015 UTC,"I've never heard anyone blaming Poles instead of the Nazis - at most, it's blaming Poles along with the Nazis (and rarely on the same level of responsibility). I'm pretty sure it's just a right-wing boogeyman."

All they see in Poland is places where their great-grandparents or other relatives were killed. So the impression they get is that Poland is some sort of dark cemetery.  It's a delicate matter so forgive me if I offend anyone but in my opinion they should drop some places and exchange them for places like Museum Polin (the brand new museum of the thriving Jewish life in Poland BEFORE the Holocaust), meet with the Polish youth, have a day-off in some nice place or something."

There seem to be much focus on Holocaust and not enough about Jewish life in PL which took place over centuries. I'm from Lodz and we had great Jewish community (along with German and Russian minorities) that made a big impact on the city (palaces, big companies etc).

They HAVE to be waterproof because snow will melt and and look like swamp that stick to boots.   Top: Woolen or polar fleece sweater + waterproof jacket with some polar as heating.    Legs: Regular (bit thicker) jeans will do the trick.   For cold one you want:   Feet: Thick, warm boots. It's not so wet this time, but you probably won't find not-waterproof boots like this anyway.   Top: same as above but much thicker jacket, preferably that goes down to thighs.   Legs: I go with jeans all the way, but some people wear leggings under trousers.   Both come with windproof (warm) hat, scarf and gloves.   I can't stress how important good boots are.

You can look up various vids on YT for winter in Poland (add some recent year to the search) to see what people are wearing eg. here  side thing: You can also look up Polandia episode with Sachin from India, it's pretty old (things change really fast in Poland lately), but fun and may give you some idea."
poland,3d5gbs,1337_n00b,6,Mon Jul 13 17:53:36 2015 UTC,"eee one thing - Gdańsk has no ""center"" like most cities ; )  It has the Old Town area - turisty things mostly. The standard ""center"" as the most important part is streached along the Grunwaldzka Street or parallel to it SKM train line - it streaches through the whole 3City aglomeration (it changes it's name in Sopot and Gdynia)  Haven't been there personally, It's few minutes* walk to neares bus stop + ~15min bus ride to get to the Old Town. For accomodation also look in Gdynia and Sopot (Gdańsk, Gdynia and Sopot make the 3City aglomeration, they nearly work as one big city; make sure you visit all 3 of them, not only gdansk) for places that are close to the SKM train line  for public transport i recommand to use JakDojade (it's also avaiable as app)  *edit: i didn't notice ""on demand"" busstop. With this one in mind it look pretty OK. IF you plan to party till late night in Old Town or Sopot you may want to take taxi to get back"
poland,3d5gbs,Vertitto,3,Mon Jul 13 18:49:54 2015 UTC,"It's the ass end of nowhere. If you want to see as much as possible most effectively time wise this is not a good place. You will spend 20 minutes each way on the bus to get anywhere noteworthy and you will have to change transport, if you want to venture further.  You want to be wherever, but walking distance to the SKM line (think on-ground city metro line, you can find it on Google maps going length wise across Gdansk, Sopot, Gdynia). You can get anywhere you need to be hassle free like that.  Look for apartments near an SKM station, you can figure out the names from Google Maps."

However, I wouldn't stay there if it was my first time visiting Gdansk. There are plenty of cheap alternatives close to the train station and Długa. You can even stay a bit further northwest of the city for even less and have an easy connection with downtown with the trams. Everyone uses the trams and they are super convenient."

If you want a less touristy flavor of a large Polish city check out Wrocław (4th largest city in Poland). I see it was mentioned in another comment and I highly recommend it. (I am admittedly biased as I've been living in Wrocław since 2012.)

The PolskiBus is nice (wifi, toilet, sometimes free snacks are served), but I'm very tall and prefer to stretch my legs on the train. That said, I've taken the bus often because at the last minute the train can cost 4x of the bus. They're both cheaper if you book in advance, of course.  Edit: There are also slow trains (non pendolino) that take 5-6 hours to get to Wrocław from Warsaw or Krakow. That's basically the speed of the bus. The pendolino trains are new and fast.

From there, Wieliczka and Auschwitz are at stone's throw. Gdansk is beautiful and great to see as well, and the Polish coastline has a charm unseen in other places. You're staying long enough to see some smaller cities, perhaps not the most visited by tourists, but also worth visiting. Personally I'd recommend Zamosc, Jelenia Gora (check Karpacz, nice for hiking), Krynica Gorska. Depends also when you're coming and what you prefer, Zakopane may be a great choice too, or some of the national parks in Tatra region.

I'd be interested to ask more about your situation. By job offering are they paying for your flights back and forth? Do you have a contract? Are you getting paid more than 2000zl a month? Are they hooking you up with a visa? Are they giving you an apartment? Besides the flight, those are pretty basics in my opinion, and will show you the reality of what they're offering. I'd hate to see you get screwed without a plan b since I've seen quite a few horror stories and dealt with horrible school owners.   With that in mind Poland is quite a lovely country, one of my favorites tbh. Kraków is really cool and if you haven't traveled much out of the states will give you a ton of culture and is a good mix of tourism + Polish culture, though 20 mins outside the city will probably be a bit rough unless you're an extrovert.

It's one of the most well known cities in Poland, has a lot of tourists and tourist attractions. It also has many institutions of higher education (Universities and equal-ranked schools), which translates into active night life as well as many people in your age bracket.

It's a good place to be - contrary to the popular opinion in the rest of the Poland. I frequently visit Opole, Cieszyn, Poznań, Tri-city area (Gdańsk, Gdynia, Sopot), Wroclaw, Szczecin, Katowice and Warszawa (and few others for that matter - each of the mentioned at least once a year for a few days). None of them suits me better (I'm from Szczecin, my family moved to southern Poland when I was 8).  Upsides:   nightlife, if that's your cup of tea: none of the other big cites can even compare, at least in my experience. shops and services: you can get anything here. Pretty much every damn chain has a place here, all the services you could want, items, gadgets, media, and places to visit. communication: contrary to popular belief, the public transport is probably the best one in Poland. I compare it to the places I've mentioned capital city: Warsaw may say what they like, but it's the capital city of Poland for less than a hundred years.   Downsides: - getting anywhere near the city centre in your own car can be a huge pain in the ass. And it's getting worse. Use public transport or bike if you can   crime: not as bad as people say, but counter-intuitively, the city centre is the most dangerous. There was only one time I almost got stabbed in Kraków, and it was on the main bus station in the centre, while I was boarding (!). Although that was 8 years ago. I'm a metalhead, and two punks attacked me, so, also not something a typical person can encounter. Hooligans are indeed an inconvenience sometimes, but usually they fight among themselves, and, again, counter-intuitively, if you're a witty talker they're not a problem ;) But seriously, crime rate is not high, and much better than in, for example, Wroclaw or Warszawa. tourists: after a few years the amount of tourists will annoy you to some degree. That ius, if you'll stay for longer :)   That's the basics, but there's much more to Krakow. You said you'll be working about 20 minutes outside of Krakow - in which direction? N/S/E/W? I'm asking because the housing conditions differ in various parts of Krakow, for example you could catch a nice place quite cheap in Żabiniec, which is expanding nicely in the last years, but in Prokocim you'll probably be doomed to live in an old concrete block of flats, and the neighbours probably won't be the cream of society. And if your workplace is outside of Krakow, living near the city centre is inadvisable, for obvious reasons (much longer commute)"

Nice place, but that means either you'll be living outside of Krakow, or you'll commute through one of the main cruising roads out of Krakow, Zakopianka (named like that, because it's built towards Zakopane, main touristic city in Tatry mountains).  That road is a bitch, especially during rush hours. However, you could find a flat around this point - houses are a bit cheaper there, and the communication is acceptable (trams to city centre are quite fast). Tram loop is near that point (further south), the district is called 'Dębniki'. To the east there's Kurdwanów (nice when it comes to housing, but commute time is abysmal, even with fast trams) and Prokocim - steer clear, although flats are cheap, they're, what's the word... shitty.   To the west you've got Ruczaj district. It's currently developing fast around Uniwersytet Jagiellońki's Campus. Due to the demographic decline houses there are becoming cheaper (many were meant to be rented for students), and yet it's one of the newest districts when it comes to architecture, since its development is based on aforementioned Campus.

poland,3cumpx,derajes62,2,Sat Jul 11 15:28:14 2015 UTC,"In Poland the prenup is basically a contract.  You don't need a lawyer to sign contracts.  The notary's role is primarily formalizing the prenup by certifying the veracity of the signatures, providing proper forms and some guidance to ensure the stipulations of the contract are within the legal framework."
poland,3cumpx,Makdaam,2,Sat Jul 11 17:09:58 2015 UTC,"While I don't have a specific recommendation for you (it would be helpful if you named a larger city near where you want to live in Poland) one tip: You're probably looking for a ""radca prawny"" which is a protected term for a lawyer who did some practice and qualified for becoming a member of civil (as in not criminal) lawyers association.  Radca prawny can take care of stuff from real estate, through business contracts and mergers, to wills and copyright. So good google terms are:  ""intercyza"" (prenup); ""kancelaria"" (an office where lawyers work); ""kancelaria radcowska"" (an office where radca prawny works); ""rozdział majątkowy"" (separation of possesions); name of the city near you.  If you don't understand the webpage don't be afraid to call, there will probably be someone who speaks English. Since advertising services is forbidden (or at least very limited) you might want to visit a few kancelarie and ask how the process will look like, then make your decision based on how you feel about their approach to your case.  The process of signing will probably include a notary, but your lawyer will schedule all necessary steps for you anyway."
poland,3cumpx,battlinlobster,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:03:55 2015 UTC,"We currently live in the US and we aren't planning to move to Poland until maybe 2, 3 yrs. Then it would be Krakow. I had been hoping to have a lawyer prepare it there without me having to go and we could get what notary service we might need at the Polish consulate here (if that's required, I don't even know).  In my limited experience with lawyers, it's hard to know without knowledge whether they're drafting a good agreement or not and so a recommendation goes a long way. It will be doubly hard for me to know that in this case given that I don't speak Polish and my US attorney doesn't know anything Polish law to help me.  I'm not sure about in Poland, but in the US, depending on which state you might find yourself in court, there are different standards for validity of a prenup and if your lawyer does a bad job, you'll get it tossed out. I don't know how I would ever find out if Polish lawyer X is inexperienced with prenups and forgets some important requirement that I don't find out about until God forbid my wife decides to divorce me and her lawyers dig it up."

poland,3chbcq,Sam115,10,Tue Jul 7 22:23:17 2015 UTC,"Long story short, yes there are anti-semitic sentiments in Poland, as they are also present pretty much everywhere else in the world.   Let me give you an example from my childhood.  I was raised in a very Catholic family, though later I rejected the religion as I became somewhat of an agnostic. I was born in a town of Pinczow (pop. ~10,000), which had a large Jewish population before WW2, and nearly zero after the war.  In Poland, the All Saints Day (Nov.1) is a big and beautiful holiday. People flock to cemeteries to pay respect to the deceased, remember their loved ones, reminisce about the past. Millions of candles are lit on the graves. The phrase ""to light a candle on someone's grave"" is a token of respect to the deceased.  The holiday is a sight to behold:  https://www.google.ca/search?q=zaduszki&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=lFucVdGoApOdygS-7KTIBg&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&biw=928&bih=444  One year, I must have been 6, perhaps 8 years old, my mom and I were leaving the cemetery - the Catholic part. As we were passing by the Jewish part, there were candles lit on some Jewish graves, apparently lit by Polish Catholics. My mom looked around as to make sure nobody we knew can could see us going to the JEWISH cemetery (OMG!!!) and said - ""let's light a candle on one of the graves. Those souls have nobody left to do this for them"". And so we did and left. It felt as if my mom considered the act a kind of sin against her religion, and perhaps an act of trespassing against the Jewish faith. And yet she felt she needed to do this.  As I remember, there were many candles lit up in the Jewish part of the cemetery. Only a couple were ours.  So here it is - a tiny example of Polish anti-semitism among the common folk."
poland,3chbcq,derajes62,5,Tue Jul 7 23:15:50 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. Very interesting. This sounds less like anti-semitism and more like your mom is a good person.
poland,3chbcq,kociorro,7,Tue Jul 7 23:22:00 2015 UTC,"So, the matter is in fact very complicated. The gehtto benches and general anti-semitic sentiment in the interbellum Poland are facts. It surely wasn't easy to live as a poor Jewish family back then (especially in villages and smaller towns). Then there is WW2 when although many Poles didn't like Jews at all, they in general were not as bloodthirsty as Nazi Germans. That's when Żegota was formed (interesting thing is that leaders of this organisation were deeply Catholic and more or less anti-semitic before the war). The official stand of the Polish (later underground) authorities was never systematically anti-semititc (although there were many Poles - also the underground fighters - who ignored Jewish fate or even were pleased with Nazis' prosecution of Jews). There is a cause for the word szmalcownik to be present in Polish language. This means both that: * there were many who tried to blackmail Jews or their Polish hosts (or even kill them and steal their belongings); * szmalcownik was considered a collaborator with German Nazis (so a traitor to the Polish state) and punished when possible.  A fear of their Polish neighbours was common among Jews during the occupation of Poland. But also there were many Poles who did hide Jews (being paid or not), some of them being recognized later as Righteous Among the Nations. This must be said that in Poland it was especially risky, as Germans would kill anyone helping Jews with their whole family and sometimes even neighbours (contrary to what happened in the Western Europe). Apart from racial or religious prejudice there were also common incidents of neighbours looting abandoned houses (often Jewish). This happened especially in poor rural areas with Jews being not the only, but the most obvious and powerless targets. Another thing is many Jews considered themselves Polish (Jews) and mostly (but not always) they were perceived as such by Polish fighters - i.e. liberation of Gesiowka or this appeal from 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Then, just after the war the ""anti-semitic"" card was also being played by the new authorities (inspired pogroms) plus many newly installed, communist secret police officers, infamous for their cruelty, were Jewish - see Jozef Rozanski or Julia Brystiger. This once again created a very negative image of Jews among Poles.    Nowadays the anti-semitic sentiment is still present in Poland (mostly some slurs being shouted during manifestations and sometimes writings on the walls). The history of Polish-Jewish relations is known more or less widely, but often only ""the convenient facts"" are being picked to fuel own version. Anti-semitism is often (but for obvious reasons, unofficially) used in many far-right political organisations. There are many conspiracy theories and a general feeling among those people participating, that ""Jews somehow have power over all important offices in this country"". An important role has the quite common Polish Christ of Nations attitude and the anger directed at UK/USA/France for the Western Betrayal and their general ignorance considering the facts about WW2 in Poland - see i.e. so called Polish death camps. Simply put - it's complicated.    tl;dr: There is some anti-semitism nowadays, but I wouldn't call it very popular apart from some circles.  EDIT: What's with those bullet points, eh?"

poland,3chbcq,kociorro,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:50:40 2015 UTC,"No problem, my pleasure.    Just to add a little - from what I know from my family stories, before WW2 the Jews were mostly disliked because of their trade, which was often money-handling, money-lending, etc... So in the Polish eyes they gained from trading the goods which were produced by hard, cheap labour of Polish workers while not really doing much themselves. From WW2 period - there's also interesting character of Irena Sendler.    And finally the biggest problem right now is that both Jews and Poles are very defensive about their visions of the past. Jews mostly remember ""the bad Poles"" and popularize this image. They also tend to ""monopolize being a victim"", while there are many nations who also suffered a lot. Poles on the other hand only want to remember ""the good Poles"", ignoring the fact that many of their compatriots benefited in one way or another from the loss of Jews. Another problem is that most American Jews didn't do a thing to help their ""European brothers"" then, but now are the first to throw accusations against Poles and other European nations. To many this is infuriating.    To end with something positive - there is a rising interest in Jewish people, tradition and history in Poland. Cracow's Kazimierz is slowly coming back to its Jewish roots. In Warsaw there is the new Museum of the History of Polish Jews - Polin and people do visit it often. Some people dicover their Jewish heritage. Other simply become interested in the Jewish culture... I stay optimist."

To many this is infuriating.   This doesn't make sense.. Most American Jews are descended from Eastern European Jews who migrated to american in the early 1900s. At that point most American Jews were extremely poor and were trying to work while at the same time trying to get the rest of their family out of Europe. What else were they supposed to do?   What I'm trying to say is that the American Jews at that point basically were the ""european brothers""."
poland,3chbcq,przyjaciel,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:08:22 2015 UTC,"Well, you may be right that's the case. I won't argue, as my sources in this case are more ""common knowledge"" type, rather than actual history sources I can provide. I'm pretty sure there were rich, influential Jewish families in the States back then, though. Afterall, not every Jewish family in the States were fresh migrants, were they? Anyway, this might be a misconception, as in general American Jewry is considered very influential. If you read an article like this one or the story of MS St. Louis and then keep in mind that ""we here in Poland"" mostly think America's politics are very stongly influenced by Jews, then...    ""Our problem"" is that if someone is not a descendant of those Jewish refugees from WW2, they and their ancestors rather have no idea what it was like in Nazi occupied Europe during the war. What choices people had to make and what was at stake... As if - should I ignore the fate of my Jewish neighbours? Should I help them and risk getting my family killed? Or should I report them to the German authorities and receive some kind of gratification which might help me survive? This looks obvious to me now, when I sit comfy in my chair and type on reddit. But if my life was in real danger? One can only speculate, I guess... This goes also against the non-Jewish westerners who like to portray Poles as the most well-known anti-Semites, while they have very little to show themselves. I guess you can say it is a bit of us against them way of thinking, too. Also some of our news sources are good at pinpointing and showing to the public cases of people coming from Jewish families not directly affected by Shoah/Holocaust, but being the most vocal about the Polish guilt (which might be in fact very rare - I don't know that).    I'm sorry if I worded the thing too harsh in the earlier post. But it does in a way reflect the general perception of the matter here in Poland..."

poland,3chbcq,_marcoos,11,Thu Jul 9 12:58:00 2015 UTC,"Antisemitism as such was present in interbellum Poland, as it was in most of continental Europe at the time. It rarely turned into violent clashes though, but I can see how your great-grandmother might have not enjoyed the 1920s here.  How it looks now? Well, after WW2 communist played the ""blame the Jew card during so called March 1968 (also, after 1945 preWar population was very much alive and in power so keep that in mind). That tainted another generation or two.  After 1990 the Jewish situation was normalized, and people are not antisemitic in any meaningful way* anymore (at least then younger generations). I used word ""meaningful"" for a reason. The Jewish stereotypes are very much alive in speech and especially jokes. It's not directed against anyone as such, it just turned into figure of speech. For example exclamation ""Ty Zydzie"" (literally ""you Jew"") to accuse someone of being greedy.   *exception: there are some nationalists out there, that might be a bit more serious, not that many though (I hope). Football hooligans too might be a bit rough about that, but than again if not Jewish, than something else - they don't discriminate who they're violent toward really. Don't think it's dangerous to be Jew in Poland or anything, just wanted to clear some things before someone else mentions it without much context.  That's the problem Poland has in general though, we're extremely homogeneous society. Most of us never knew any Jew, and best we could probably do is someone having Jewish ancestor 2-3 generations away.  As for education... that's tricky question. Average Pole should know about 19th century pogroms, and how Jews was treated during partitions by each Great Power. However, because anything that happened after WW1 is still extremely politically loaded topic, and because we tend to glorify that generation as martyrs that could do no wrong, that's not something most people will be well versed in.   I'm writing from iPad now, so so sorry if anything is particularly confusing and vague. I would love more specific questions though.  Oh, and couple more questions out of curiosity: do you by chance know where your great-grandmother was from exactly, and where she moved throughout Poland? Also, I'm quite curious what Zionist organization she joined."

Im having trouble digging up much information about her, as apparently she wasn't so fond of talking about life before coming to America. My grandmother told me she came from a village that starts with an ""L"" (so specific right?"". I've been trying to find her on some Jewish genealogy records but no dice so far. I don't know about the Zionist organization either, but there couldn't have been too many operating at that time so maybe I'll be able to find a lead.

Antisemitism as such was present in interbellum Poland, as it was in most of continental Europe at the time. It rarely turned into violent clashes though, but I can see how your great-grandmother might have not enjoyed the 1920s here.   Sure, one could say that antisemitism was present virtually everywhere where Jews lived (and probably still is). But that's not a good argument.    Of course there were more violence against Jews in Eastern Europe, Poland included, than anywhere else in the West till the rise of Nazis in Germany. The fact that that's where majority of European Jews lived is obviously a big factor here, but that's hardly an excuse. The last documented pogrom in Europe was in 1946 in Kielce, Poland. Around 40 Jews were killed. There were no Nazis in Poland in 1946. We as a nation need to embrace this dark parts of our history and stop looking for feel-good excuses.  Interbellum was a peak of antisemitism in Poland. Anti-Jewish sentiment was a part of mainstream politics at the time. Openly antisemitic National Democracy rose to be the biggest political party till the outbreak of WWII. Not to mention acts of institutionalized segregation like ghetto benches. Hardly a brightest chapter in Polish history.   So when you say I can see how your great-grandmother might have not enjoyed the 1920s here it sounds naive at best.

""Just after the end of World War I, the West became alarmed by reports about alleged massive pogroms in Poland against Jews. Pressure for government action reached the point where U.S. President Woodrow Wilson sent an official commission to investigate the matter. The commission, led by Henry Morgenthau, Sr., concluded in its report that the reports of pogroms were exaggerated, but also noted that the violence against Jews had been produced by a ""widespread anti-semitic prejudice against Jews"" (see: Morgenthau Report)."

That said, there is a real tendency to ignore, deny or dismiss Polish antisemitism before, during and after the war. There is a reason that many Israeli and American Jews have such a terrible opinion about Poland and that's mostly the experiences of the Polish Jews who survived the Holocaust. There is also a reason why the Poles who hid Jews were not only scared of the German occupiers, but of their neighbours as well.   So it's not a conspiracy, even though I find the general opinion among Israeli and American Jews worrying that Poland and Germany are somehow on the same level of blame regarding the Holocaust. I have also never ever found a source for the claim that Poland was selected as the main stage of the Holocaust because the population was so antisemitic, neither in English, German or Polish. Yet in these circles that idea somehow tends to persist."
poland,3c7xy8,jojenpaste,8,Sun Jul 5 21:00:20 2015 UTC,"there is a real tendency to ignore, deny or dismiss Polish antisemitism before, during and after the war.   It's exactly the opposite way.   The people were scared of the others since Germans were murdering whole villages and families for hideing or helping the Jews. People tryied just to survive in these times. My great grandfather was a railroad engineer, he was forced to work for Germans and drive the Jews, otherwise they'd just execute him. He tried to help many times and hid some people in coal, but it was not possible to help everybody or to refuse this job. I guess that Jews would hate him anyway."
poland,3c7xy8,O5KAR,-1,Mon Jul 6 11:04:23 2015 UTC,"The grave consequences for helping Jews were certainly a reality and I am quite opposed to the recent attacks on supposed Polish ""bystanders"", who should have somehow done more. It was a huge risk, a much greater one than in the West, because the Germans simply didn't give a fuck how many Poles they killed. They would have never allowed themselves to act as harsh in the west as they did in the east.  That said, part of that risk came from your own neighbours. There weren't Germans in every tiny little village, but there were your neighbours and some didn't take kindly to someone aiding Jews, be it ideolgical antisemitism, greed or fear about the mass reprisals a German discovery could lead to. And this not only endangered the Poles actively helping and hiding Jews, it also prevented generally willing Poles from giving aid. But you don't have to dig in testimonies of Jewish survivors for these stories, a lot of Poles could tell you the exact same thing. And hell, it didn't stop with the end of the war. There are countless stories about Righetous among the Nations in Poland, who were shunned and even assaulted for what they did during the war."
poland,3c7xy8,jojenpaste,5,Mon Jul 6 21:33:37 2015 UTC,"Could you give me some example? I've never heard about people being assaulted for that. Also, it was quite recently when popular opinion could learn the stories of Irena Sendlerowa or Witold Pilecki and just the resistance during and especially after the war. It was not the school, nor the state and especially not the massmedia which taught me that, the people had to dig it for themselves and force these institutions to react.   The German occupation was different in western puppet or collaborating states since Germans acknowladged their existence while here it was just a ""lebensraum"" populated by slave laborers, temporarily. Some people collaborated, for different reasons, even some desperate Jews did, but very few people were stupid enough to do it honestly and belive that there's any future for them in this situation."
poland,3c7xy8,O5KAR,2,Mon Jul 6 22:05:53 2015 UTC,"There are a few. I know that the woman who had saved some of the Jedwabne Jews from the massacre was brutally aussaulted and had to move a few times, because how negatively her neighbours reacted once they learned about it. And since you have mentioned her, Gross has a quote from Irena Sendlerowa, where she talks about how her daughter got actively discriminated from getting into the (Wroclaw?) university, once they had learned whose daughter she was and how insults like ""Jew lover"" have followed her around all her life. A lot of the Jews who were rescued by Poles also reported that their saviours later begged them not to reveal their role in their survival, because they were scared of their neighbours. The German critic Marcel Reich-Ranicki is one such example.  From my where I am from I also have some stories. I know for a fact that the one guy in our town that kept Jews hidden in his work shop was later boycotted for some time after the war, once certain people found out what he did.   Btw. balls of steel on this man. His mechanic workshop was right accross the Gestapo head quarter and the Ukrainian police, and the Germans often had their vehicles repaired there, while the Jews were hidden in a hole in the ground, right underneath them. He also was very active in the local AK. That guy would be worth a movie.  In my grandmother's village there was also a family who hid a few Jews and who were later severly beaten by a group of nationalist thugs, once they found out what they did during the war.  There is also an interesting article how the Polish Righteous still prefer to remain in hiding even today."

Nationalists in a village, seriously?  In general, i could even understand that people disliked Jews considering their participation in a communist regime, which propagandist mouthpiece was ""Polityka"". I guess that in this situation the ""Jew lovers"" weren't liked either. There's no other reason why Sendlerowa or Pilecki were virtually unknown in Poland until recently, especially the second one wouldn't mind to be mentioned, since he was dead and just becouse of communists. They however, would mind to mention him and the others."

But he gives his sources, and many of them are first hand accounts - if you want to check them out, do so. As for the anecdotes from my family's side, they are largely supported by the memoirs of the actual Jewish survivors and Yad Vashem. But seeing as how we've already reached the point of the discussion where antisemitism in Poland supposedly stemmed from Jewish communists I don't think we need to go any further, I've been listening to this kind of shit for way too long. I'll be frank, I'm incredibly tired and embarrassed of the denial regarding this subject."

If you want to know anecdote, but a more recent one, i've had a Jewsih mate in neighborhood. I mean a real, religious one and he was abused by some local nationalists, whom i know as well. There're thugs and bullys everywhere, but the point is that they're a marginal minority and when they go too far, they're arrested and punished. The war and occupation is demoralising, harsh material conditions makes people to be desperate and not just the Jews were killed and robbed during and after the war. The people like Gross manipulates with this kind of criminal cases to proove their point, not even trying to proove that anti Jewish sentiments were the reasons."

Btw, Jan Karski reported the following to the Exile governement in London in 1940:   Powszechnie daje się wyczuć, że [Żydzi] radzi byliby, aby w stosunku Polaków do nich panowało zrozumienie, iż przecież oba narody są niesprawiedliwie gnębione, i to przez tego samego wroga. Tego zrozumienia wśród szerszych mas społeczeństwa polskiego nie ma. Stosunek ich do Żydów jest przeważnie bezwzględny, często bezlitosny. Korzystają w dużej części z uprawnień, jakie nowa sytuacja im daje. Wykorzystują wielekroć te uprawnienia, często nadużywają ich nawet.   Zbliża ich to w pewnym stopniu do Niemców [...]. Rozwiązywanie kwestii żydowskiej przez Niemców - muszę to stwierdzić z całym poczuciem odpowiedzialności za to, co mówię - jest poważnym i dosyć niebezpiecznym narzędziem w rękach Niemców do moralnego pacyfikowania szerokich warstw społeczeństwa polskiego [...].   Naród nienawidzi swego śmiertelnego wroga - ale ta kwestia stwarza jednak coś w rodzaju wąskiej kładki, na której przeważnie spotykają się zgodnie Niemcy i duża część polskiego społeczeństwa |,..|. Dalej - stan obecny stwarza podwójne rozbicie wśród ludności tych ziem. Po pierwsze, rozbicie między Żydami i Polakami w walce ze wspólnym i śmiertelnym wrogiem; po drugie, rozbicie wśród Polaków, z których jedni gardzą i oburzają się na barbarzyńskie metody Niemców (zdając sobie przy tym sprawę z grożącego niebezpieczeństwa), a drudzy patrzą na nie (a więc i na Niemców!) ciekawym i często zachwyconym wzrokiem [...].   Zajęcie biernej postawy wobec obecnego stanu rzeczy grozi i demoralizacją społeczeństwa polskiego (przeważnie niższych jego warstw), i wszystkimi niebezpieczeństwami wynikającymi z tej - choćby częściowej, ale w wielu wypadkach szczerej zgodności - znacznej części Polaków z zaborcą."

As a Polish-American with strong Polish ties I noticed a lot of nationalist-leaning white-washing of Polish history (especially with PiS supporters).  This is anecdotal and so this is not scientific or representative of the reality. My experience is Poles generally talk about how they were victims and it was a bad time for everyone during the war, but I never heard about how widespread anti-Semitism was before the war with ghetto benches and the ONR) movement (which have a reestablished presence today and some Poles even told me they were simply ""very patriotic""). My grandparents shared their negative feelings toward Jewish people with me quite often and even my father's postwar generation have some of the same prejudices. I haven't really noticed much with anyone in the following generations with such strong beliefs (except maybe the marchers).  It seems like those older generations always have to tactlessly add that Poles were also the victims of Nazis whenever Jewish victims are mentioned, like it's some sort of race to keep up with. It's also apparently anti-Polish to talk about any negative thing a significant number of Poles were involved in. I get that Poles are very emotional about the subject and complaining is the national pastime, but it's also very immature to obsess over such things and spend so much energy interjecting rather than making peace and building substantive dialogue. I don't engage people like that anymore and mostly just tune out such dialogue.  Moving on to these unscientific and unrepresentative examples of Israelis, there are clearly many myths and misconceptions that persist. With time they will learn and I believe the truth will come out for Poles just as it did for Jews. As a Pole, I think it's up to Polish people to be gracious and listen to what they are saying and respond with thought rather than react with emotion. Honestly passing by many Jewish kids visiting Warsaw, they were nice and some of them even engaged me in a positive manner. I never had any bad experiences with Jews visiting Warsaw so I think this shows a lot of progress has been made."

It was never promoted, not even tolerated by any goverment in a long history of Poland with a one exception when the communists organised an anti Jewish campaign in 1968.   I specifically mentioned Ghetto benches because it was an example pre-War institutional anti-Semitism that was ""tolerated"" by the government:   The Ministry of Education in Warsaw was opposed to the ghetto benches, declaring numerus clausus a violation of the constitution, and Polish Minister of Education stated that: ""Student ghettos would not be introduced at the Polish Universities"".[12] However in light of the continuing serious riots at the university, which the Ministry condemned as ""zoological patriotism"", the Ministry slowly gave in and decided to withdraw its opposition, hoping that the introduction of the ghettos would end the riots.[12] The ethno-nationalists finally won their campaign for ghetto benches in 1937 when by Ministry decision universities were granted the right to regulate the seating of Polish and Jewish students.[21]"

This is because Poles need to do a better job organizing and communicating to the world. Jewish people have spent decades to organize to create museums and public events to commemorate their struggles. Polish people have done a pretty poor job doing such things (until recently at least). The Warsaw Uprising Musuem and the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum do a pretty good job at communicating the struggles of the Polish people during the war but those are still confined to Poland.   Also they aren't generally accused of anti Polish sentiments. I think i understand what's double standard.   While there is certainly some Jewish prejudice toward Polish people there is nothing near the extent of Polish prejudice toward Jewish people. Many Jewish people generally don't like Poles because many Poles were nasty to Jews, but many Poles generally don't like Jews because of extensive ignorance.   So you jusat mentioned something that was not institutional and that the authorites were against it.   The Minister of Education was originally against the policies but then changed their mind to permit the policies for public universities (which are public institutions).   How do you imagine goverment forcing students to sit next to each other when they obviously don't want to?   The point is not to tell the students that they must sit next to each other. Maybe the right side of the class is near a window and the classroom gets very hot in the summer months or maybe there are free spots in the front of the right side of the class but someone has to sit in the back where they can't see as well (this could go either way). The point is that students are free to choose where they do or do not want to sit based on what is available."

So, especially the Poles will react in this way and the result will be even more prejudice and negative sentiments, i guess this is not a desired result, or at least i hope it's not just provoked. Jews also can be nasty, every people can.  First of all, universities are autonomous and secondly it was not the official policy of the universities, it was about what some students wanted and just several professors.

poland,3c7xy8,yvonneka,-16,Mon Jul 6 19:15:52 2015 UTC,"Antisemitism was common in pre-war Poland (getto ławkowe, barring Jews from law at universities, beatings – 242 Jews heavily beaten and 4 killed 15.06.1938-15.07.1938...). And during the war it was worse. German final solution was what many Poles prayed/hoped for. Read ""Judenjagd. Polowanie na Żydów 1942-1945. Studium dziejów pewnego powiatu"" by Jan Grabowski or ""Jest taki piękny słoneczy dzień... Losy Żydów szukających ratunku na wsi polskiej 1942-1945"" by Barbara Engelking.   Dąbrowa Tarnowska to powiat, jakich wiele. Udało mi się udokumentować losy 277 Żydów, którzy starali się przeżyć na jego terenie okupację. Z tej liczby 239 zginęło, a 38 ocalało. Z tych 239, którzy ponieśli śmierć, prawie wszyscy zostali wydani Niemcom przez Polaków, dużo mniej zamordowanych zostało polskimi rękami. W mniej niż 5 procentach wypadków Żydów znaleźli sami Niemcy. Najczęściej przyczyną śmierci Żydów były donosy, wydania, morderstwa i działalność granatowej policji.   Pole will not say sorry, he will stick fingers in his ears and excuse everything (ordnungspolizei participation in Jedwabne, righteous among the nations, anti-defamation league, grandma never talking shit about them Jews, Jews welcoming Red Army in September 1939, American Jews not helping European Jews during war...).  Edit: and Pole will downvote you for mentioning inconvenient facts."

Walczył z dominacją Żydów w sferach gospodarczych, proponując całkowite wyłączenie tej mniejszości z życia publicznego[13]. OWP zakładał prowadzenie konsekwentnej polityki polonizacyjnej mniejszości słowiańskich i stopniowe ich włączanie w nurt polskiego życia narodowego[14]. Dostrzegano problem mniejszości niemieckiej i w ogóle kwestię zagrożenia niemieckiego – formułowano dalekosiężny cel odzyskania rdzennie słowiańskich ziem zachodnich, obejmujących: Górny i Dolny Śląsk, ziemię lubuską, Pomorze, a także Warmię i Mazury[15].

Btw. you whine, you also just accused the people who disagree with you of antisemitism or some ""phoby"", which is just retarded and typical ""progressive"" way of censorship."
poland,3c7xy8,O5KAR,-2,Mon Jul 6 18:26:12 2015 UTC,"Just got back from work.  One of the accusations against Narutowicz was that he is a Jew. Polish copy/paste, there are no sources in English (you had problem with that last time so google translate if you need):   Prasa endecka gloryfikowała wszelkie demonstracje przeciw Narutowiczowi37. Także generał Haller czołowa twarz prawicy polskiej nie ustawał w atakach na decyzję parlamentu z 9 grudnia. Pod jego domem zebrała się duża grupa demonstrantów. Mówił do nich Polskę przez ten wybór sponiewierano, a wszystkie demonstracje są wskaźnikiem, iż oburzenie narodu przybiera na siłę38. Młodzież narodowa liczyła na poparcie swoich działań przez przywódców polskiej prawicy, którzy byli dla nich autorytetami, zachowania takie jak Hallera pokazują, iż przyzwolenie takie, od swych bożyszczów, dostali39.  Aleksandra Piłsudska w swoich pamiętnikach napisała także, iż w dniu 14 grudnia w tłumie widziała kobietę krzyczącą „precz z Narutowiczem, precz z Żydem”, gdy żona Marszałka próbowała przekonać ją, iż zna dobrze rodzinę Narutowicza i nikt z nich nie jest żydowskiego pochodzenia, kobieta krzyknąć miała „Żydzi nie będą nami rządzili”. Po chwili coraz więcej osób zaczęło krzyczeć w podobny sposób, oczywistym więc się stało, ze w tłumie znajdowali się agitatorzy, którzy poprzez swoje zachowanie, wywołać mieli podobne zachowanie u innych zebranych40. Wydarzenia te miały miejsce co prawda trzy dni później, nastroję które towarzyszyły zaprzysiężeniu pierwszego prezydenta musiały być dość podobne. Tego dnia bowiem, młodzież prawicowa od samego rana zaczęła działać przeciw prezydentowi. Prawicowi chodzili z charakterystycznymi opaskami na ramieniu, które odróżniały ich z tłumu41.   And the best thing is that I don't say that only ND was antisemitic. Read ""Polityka"" from September 1938 and you will find this:   Przy traktowaniu problemu żydowskiego należy sobie przede wszystkim zdać sprawę z trojakiego rodzaju trudności. Do pierwszych należą specyficzne właściwości rasy żydowskiej czyniące z niej element ludnościowy trudny do równorzędnego traktowania z innymi mniejszościami narodowymi. Żydzi nie mieszkają zwartą masą, lecz przenikają swymi wpływami wszystkie dzielnice kraju oraz wszystkie ugrupowania społeczne. Żyjąc w rozsypce wśród obcego im narodu, nie ulegają mimo to w przygniatającej większości, asymilacji. Wprost przeciwnie, z uporem bronią swej odrębności narodowej i religijnej. W stosunkach z autochtonami kierują się — pomijając nieliczne wyjątki — zasadami etyki niemożliwymi do przyjęcia dla społeczeństw chrześcijańskich. Ich interesy narodowe każą Im w dodatku opowiadać się stale po stronie silniejszego. Oportunizm ten uderza w same podwaliny spoistości państwowej, która jest w chwilach ciężkiej próby wystawiona przez obecność tego rodzaju elementu na poważne niebezpieczeństwo.   Read whole text here  This is written by Bocheński, Skwarczyński and Studentowicz and published by Giedroyc (sic!)  Ad. numerus clausus - others did it so it is ok? Another excuse and reason for easy dismissal.  You are again confused. I don't accuse people of antisemitism just because they don't agree with me. Dividing society, treating one group of citizens in other way than others, physical violence against minority, laws against minority - these were my proves of Polish antisemitism pre war.  Later, during the war... I don't get why it is so hard to admit that our nation fucked up? Why deny truth? Poles denounced Jews, even killed them. Nobody sane can deny that. We actively took part in the Holocaust and that is historical fact. Why can't we accept that? Big part of our society is gone and we will cover for people who did it? Is it moral? is it just?"
poland,3c7xy8,tuwxyz,2,Mon Jul 6 23:24:29 2015 UTC,"FFS i told you how pointles this is, i know how to read, how to find informations and all of that i knew already... This is also why i compared this assasination to the one against the current opposition.  Ehhh, others did it, the goverment of ""Chjeno-Piast"" didn't. So what if they ""tried""? Just becouse it was a mainstream view accepted in the other countries i say they were moderate, i will never say that was a good idea.  ""Polityka"" was (?) a propagandist magazine created by the communist party in 1957. There's nothing ""antisemitic"" in the quoted text, except maybe for the assumption that the Jewish minority is opportunistic, but it all depends on the context which is the fact of lacking assimilation and preservation of their identity.   I don't whine that I am being downvoted. Quite opposite – it is confirmation of my opinions about the subject.   You're the confused one here.   our nation fucked up   No idea which is your ""nation"" and i don't even care. Since i'm not a nationalist, i'm not going to accuse and insult any nation in general. The Polish state on exile, local structures and underground army didn't ""fucked up"", quite the opposite, they did more than anybody else to help the Jews. The shit you write is just embarassing."
poland,3c7xy8,O5KAR,4,Tue Jul 7 00:56:56 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between some prewar antisemitism in the form of mild racism and all out Nazi genocide.  Not to mention, um ethnic Slavs in Polska were butchered and many of them died trying to save what now seems to be ungrateful Jews."

Boycotting Jewish shops is not mild (I know, Nazis in Germany smashed shop windows and I don't have proofs that we did too). Bans and limits based on belief or origin is not mild. Germans proposed to banish Jews to USA, we proposed Madagascar.  Then genocide. Of course there is difference between industrial killing of Jews and Polish participation in Holocaust. Are you feeling better? I repeat - we were not as bad as Nazis. Some Poles ""just"" denounced Jews even when society knew what was going on on these camps or simply killed them because they knew there would be no punishment.  I am ethnic Slav too (zero Jewish blood, can you imagine I was even baptised?) and my family was butchered by Germans, Ukrainians and Russians so get off your high horse."

There are automatic ticket machines, but of course they don't take bills, only coins.

poland,3bwaul,exus1pl,3,Thu Jul 2 22:35:44 2015 UTC,"Your US insurance will not be of any use in Poland.  Travel insurance in theory might be a good idea (it won't cover regular preventative care but may be of use in an emergency, however they may deny your claim if they believe you are not a travel but an immigrant).  To receive insurance from the National Health Fund (NFZ, the public health care system), you will need to have a PESEL. This is a national identity number, roughly equivalent to the SSN in the US. You would need to establish resident status, but it could be done and should be if you plan to stay in Poland for a long time.  The reason being that even if you have private insurance, if in an emergency you will be sent to the closest hospital that most likely has a contract with the NFZ. There are few private hospitals in Poland, and patients in emergency situations are not generally sent to them by 'default' by ambulance crews.  Private insurance works well for preventative care, specialist visits and the like. In Warsaw, I had coverage through both the NFZ and Lux-Med as well. The cost of my plan was less than the equivalent of $100 USD a month and I didn't have to wait for specialist visits like I would in the public system.  Work case scenario, you can pay cash for procedures at NFZ hospitals and if it's not too serious the cost is far lower than it would be in the united states. In 2009, I was randomly attacked on the street and knocked unconscious in Warsaw. Got sent to Szpital Praski, where the attending physician at the emergency ward mistakenly told my fiancee I had died from my injuries, the cleaning guy sprayed insecticide all over the ward with people sitting around and I got an MRI on a machine hidden in the basement paid for by European Union money.  I didn't have NFZ coverage at that point, and with the MRI, stitches and ambulance ride my grand total was 800 PLN (around $250 at that time). My fiancee was indignant and confused that I was so happy when I got the bill, but I am sure anybody who has been insured in the US and had to take an ambulance ride to the ER would understand."

Exceptions are some nowadays unused medieval male names like Bonawentura and feminine names recently imported from English or French like Jennifer or Nicole, but they're absolutely rare. Still, Murphy's laws may apply here...  The trick for the opening line is to use the abbreviation ""Sz. P."", it works for ""Szanowna Pani"", ""Szanowny Pan"" or ""Szanowni Państwo"". You don't even need to use the vocative (""Sz. P. Anna Kowalska"" is ok). Just don't end it with a comma.

poland,3bvszg,luomo_tigre,4,Thu Jul 2 16:30:29 2015 UTC,"you should trust your translator on this one.  First, it is simply impolite in polish to address someone by surname. So there's that. You can address someone by a position, scientific title etc. but NEVER by surname. In fact if you mix polite form and a surname it almost always adds ironic/derogatory undertones.  Second, you can not create a gender neutral template because like virtually everything in polish language surnames are also subject of declension (depending on grammatical case and gender the ending will differ). Hence the common workaround - using plural form. In fact in some slavic languages (like russian) plural form IS the proper polite form when addressing an individual.  Why is it so important to you, to use full name? Maybe we can find a workaround?"
poland,3bvszg,luomo_tigre,2,Thu Jul 2 16:51:05 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. Then this will get difficult and it may be best to go with a generic address.

There are 5 languages available (one of which is Polish), and the format is the same for all of them (the email is just 1 long long email with translated versions). Thus I have no way knowing if someone is going to take the Polish version unless I'm guessing based on the name. We wanted the name because we want to insure the right person is taking the right survey (the body is the same, only the link is not). we had cases where people were forwarding emails and using links incorrectly and that's how it was caught. Unfortunately, it seems in this case, it's going to get super complicated.  Thanks for everyone's help!!"

Still, or economy is weak enough for the currency to be vulnerable to speculation attacks. This is one of the reasons adapting Euro could be beneficial.  As for US problems impacting us, most of our trade is in EU, so we might suffer indirectly, via countries with bigger ties to US. Russian embargoes and problems on Ukraine have already limited or trade with east.  Bigger problems ATM are Greece's bankruptcy and British referendum on leaving EU. The latter however will possibly lower the impact of US problems on our economy.  Although I wonder whether Russia will resort to even more aggressive politics with US in collapse. In that case Poland will have very limited means of defending itself, as we are still unsure how much we can rely, or even trust our European allies when Russia is involved.

Yet your equivalent would be rather 'I read this book'. As using 'tę' is like pointing to the object.

And if we were discussing some book, if I told you that I've read book (I appreciate this is not grammatically correct - it's just to show you that you can get by without articles), would you assume that I've read some unspecific book and I'm boasting about my reading ability? Not to mention that, as others said, saying I've read this/that book pretty much covers it in Polish if there's any doubt."
poland,3bsz46,decPL,3,Thu Jul 2 09:23:38 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit late to the discussion, but I can actually answer that one. It's quite tricky for someone who is a native Polish speaker and has never had this pointed out to them.  In many cases, the meaning that is conveyed in English by articles, in Polish is conveyed through word order. Unlike English, Polish has full declension of nearly everything, so you don't need any fixed word order to know, for example, which noun is the subject, and which is the object in a sentence. ""Tom kicked Mark"" could be both ""Marek kopnął Tomka"" and ""Tomka kopnął Marek"". That's why in Polish, you can use the word order in a sentence to convey more subtle nuances, like which object is something already known, and which is new.  Take two sentences:  Książka jest na stole.  Na stole jest książka.  As you can see, it uses the same words in a different order. The first means, word by word: ""book is on table"", and the second one means ""on table is book"".  Now, if you ask:   Gdzie jest książka? (Where is the book?)   an acceptable answer could be:    Książka jest na stole. (""book is on table"")   but the answer:   Na stole jest książka. (""on table is book)   would be very weird, though perfectly OK if you ask ""What's on the table?""  If you say ""book is on table"", it impies you and your interlocutor both know what book you are talking about. So in English traslation, you would use definite articles. ""The book is on the table.""* If you say ""on table is book"", it implies you both know of the table, but the existence of the book is a new information - therefore the word order gives you the same message as an indefinite article in English, and the sentence actually means ""There is a book on the table"".  Of course, there are many cases, where you can only figure it out from the context, because there are other factors affecting the word order. If you need to emphasize for some reason that you are talking about something definite or indefnite, you can use demonstrative pronouns such as ten, tamten, ta itp. (this, that) or indefinite pronouns such as jakiś (some, certain, some kind of).  *The status of the tabe is another subject for a long discussion."

I personally recommend either 23andMe ($99 one-time fee) where you can get great insights into your ancestry and learn a lot about human migrations, genetics and genealogy.  I'm into genetic genealogy and have helped a number of 'genetic cousins' in researching their ancestry; most recently a Bosnian man discovered he had common genetic ancestry with the area of modern day Poland and we were able to pinpoint it to a migration of Poles to Bosnia during the Austro-Hungarian Empire and confirm a link with a common last name in my tree.

Poland and Central Europe were place where borders often changed, where were mighty assimilation proceses - you could be German, your son could be Pole and grandson - Ukrainian. People declared themself what nation they are belong, what language they speak, what religion they believe, what culture is theirs. So selfdeclaration and bond to other people from your nation (and knowledge of culture and language) are more revelant than who was your father or mother."

poland,3brv9c,brainattacker,4,Wed Jul 1 17:21:36 2015 UTC,"Would that be a good idea?   Assuming you're OK with tight schedule and don't really want to relax, yes.   Which would probably be more worthwhile?   It's not which would be worthwhile, but rather which won't take too much time for it's worth. For example, getting to Zakopane can be absurdly time consuming if it's 'in season' (think 1 km/h type of average speeds due to traffic and accidents). Out those 3, Łódź would be easiest to get to from Warsaw (~1h drive + traffic in city centers), followed by Wrocław (3h drive from Kraków assuming no massive problems at A4 motorway, which is again notoriously congested, or 4 hours from Warsaw).  However, I'd still suggest Zakopane assuming you're not going to go there in full-on tourist season (for example during holidays). Than it's quite simple 1.5-2h drive from Kraków. If not, go for Łódź simply because it's least of a pain in the ass, and actually has surprising amount of stuff to see (despite what many Poles think).   My family loves driving around so this will probably be a road trip.   Keep in mind Polish driving is... well, let's just say a tad aggressive. I don't know what you're used to, but it's one of the most stressful places to drive through in EU. I won't say ""don't drive"", but really keep it in mind and especially assume the driving will take you longer than you'd probably assume given the distance.   Also, what's the weather like in Poland in December? How would you guys layer yourselves during that time?   Anything from 10*C and rainy to -20 and freezing. It's really hard to say, Polish climate is quite unpredictable. For obvious reasons weather in mountains will be more harsh, so even though there might not be any snow in - say - Kraków, there might be quite a bit in Zakopane."
poland,3brv9c,Fresherty,2,Wed Jul 1 18:19:31 2015 UTC,"i will answer it from the end. for the last two questions: it purely depends on given winter. it may be -30 with lots of snow, or can be 0 without snow. it's next to impossible to predict, so you should be prepared for everything. most major roads should be ok, small roads - may be problematic. but it's the worst time for driving, especially if you don't know how to drive in snow and traffic before/during/after christmas will be the worst. i really would recommend alternative communication, it's not a problem between big cities (rail is not as bad now and there are alternatives like polski bus) and in cities in general.  i, personally, would rather recommend staying in two cities, then rush three (eventually you can go for one day trip to zakopane, but if you are not prepared/don't have experience i wouldn't go for proper hiking, i would stay low)."

Zakopane is nice, but there's a lot of traffic and tbh not a lot to do in winter (apart from skiing)  Wrocław is the best pick out of this 3. It's in my opinion top 5 of Polish cities to visit along with Warsaw, Krakow, Gdansk and Poznan.  Last December was really mild. However, in 2013 there was a lot of snow.  I usually go for a classic t-shirt+sweater+coat/winter jacket combo."

poland,3brv9c,kpagcha,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:10:12 2015 UTC,"2 days in Warsaw and 3 in Krakow sounds about right.  The weather... it depends what you're used to. Last winter wasn't that bad compared to what they've told me from other years, it barely snowed. But who knows about this year?  About the rest: don't go to Lodz, they said it's one of the ugliest cities in Poland. Zakopane is a little charming town in the mountains, pretty good to see snow and cool landscapes. In December though... you're probably ganna freeze to death.  The best option is Wroclaw, I've lived there for almost a year and it's great. You can visit the old part (Rynek, ratusz, university area (have a look inside the main University of Wroclaw building to the aula leopoldina and oratorium marianum), theater, opera, riverside...), hang around the Christmas market and don't forget the churches island! In Wroclaw there are little dwarves all around the town, really cool to see. If you have more time you can go to Hala Stulecia, the Japanese garden and a park close to these, they're all in the same area. Also the neighbourhood around the Politechnic University has some cool streets and areas. You can also go to the Skytower view point and see the city from the 49th floor; it's the tallest residencial building in Europe."

If you want to live by the beach then choose Sopot, if you want to do more sightseeing then go for Gdańsk. Beach in Sopot might be a little crowded, especially near the pier. There are some great empty beaches in Gdańsk but they are not that easy to reach.  Best place to see is Gdańsk Old Town (I'd say that's easily a day of walking). If you're interested in more modern history then I'd recommend Westerplatte (place where WWII started) and Gdańsk Shipyard- European Solidarity Centre (museum of Solidarity).  If you're interested in nightlife then Sopot is considered the clubbing centre of Poland. Monte Cassino street and most next to it are a place to go. Gdańsk is all right if you're more interested in pubs, there's not many clubs. Then it's probably Piwna street you're looking for (it translates into Beer street :)).  Also, important information- between 25.07 and 16.08 there's St. Dominic's Fair in Gdańsk.

The city lies on the southern edge of Gdańsk Bay (of the Baltic Sea), in a conurbation with the city of Gdynia, spa town of Sopot, and suburban communities, which together form a metropolitan area called the Tricity (Trójmiasto), with a population near 1,400,000. Gdańsk itself has a population of 460,427 (December 2012), making it the largest city in the Pomerania region of Northern Poland.  Gdańsk is the historical capital of Gdańsk Pomerania and the largest city of Kashubia. The city was close to the former late medieval boundary between West Slavic and Germanic seized lands and it has a complex political history with periods of Polish rule, periods of German rule, and extensive self-rule, with two spells as a free city. Between the World Wars, the Free City of Danzig was in a customs union with Poland and was located between German East Prussia and the ""Polish corridor"" to the sea where the harbour of Gdynia grew up.

Also, any contraception method is not perfect even when used properly. ""You are a very smart man."" Thank you!

poland,3bmspb,Feallan,4,Wed Jul 1 19:37:11 2015 UTC,LOT is much better than Biedronka airlines. This is excellent news.
poland,3bmspb,BearcatChemist,2,Tue Jun 30 20:13:41 2015 UTC,I was disappointed with them when I flew with them a couple years ago though. I prefer to fly using a different airline like Lufthansa. It requires to change planes at another airport instead of flying directly to Poland but the experience was still way better.   Better airplane food too.
poland,3bmspb,chevybow,5,Tue Jun 30 20:39:45 2015 UTC,"I prefer LOT to Lufthansa any single day. Both Lufthansa and LOT use Embraer E-Jet planes, but LOT puts a smaller number of seats in them - more legroom for the passengers. And LOT seats are normal airplane seats, not that NEK monstrosity Lufthansa introduced over the last few years. Whenever I'm flying LH, my back hurts after I leave the plane, never happens while flying LOT.  Better airplane food? On short haul, food in Lufthansa is horrible, even in business class. Economy gets you an ugly tasteless bun, sometimes empty, sometimes with mystery meat. But it's free, so it must be amazing! On LOT you need to pay for food, but for 12 zł you can actually buy a decent sandwich, salad or tortilla, with actual beef, chicken or vegetables.  On long haul, the food is kind of the same, at least in economy.  From my experience, my ca. 50 flights with LOT = zero real problems, one 60-minute delay. 30-40 flights with Lufthansa Group (Lufthansa, Swiss, Brussels): lost my bag twice, went on strike twice, and this February they botched my connection, making me wait 9 hours for the next plane in MUC (oh, they gave me a 10 EUR meal voucher, when the cheapest fast food costs 12 EUR). This is why I usually only fly Lufthansa if the destination airport is not in LOT's route network, it's simply less of a hasle."
poland,3bmspb,_marcoos,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:58:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not a frequent flyer and maybe things have changed- I haven't flown in over 5 years. I found the seats much more comfortable in Lufthansa- though I believe LOT has changed some things since I last flown with them (which was much more than 5 years ago).   Long haul food was edible in Lufthansa whereas I remember the food in LOT being tasteless. Again, they might have changed things for the better- though my father recently flown with them and said there wasn't anything to be impressed about from LOT recently.   Never experienced any problems from either but that's probably just cause I don't fly too often :) I might give LOT another try next time I visit Poland to give it another chance. I just had a less than desirable experience last time I flew with them so that's why I started looking at other airlines."

I made a joke (that wasn't received that well as you see by the downvotes), that when PiS wins (they're christian social nationalists, very conservative), situation in Poland will most likely deteriorate and the negative net migration rate will get even more negative.

The Uni will be tough and won't support you unless you actually ask for help / attend office hours. Administration is a mess, however it works for some reason.

You will end up as a well-rounded engineer who can perform well in the discipline. Apart from that, student societies are superb."
poland,3bol61,helipiotr,2,Wed Jul 1 21:56:22 2015 UTC,Care to explain about students satisfaction and support?
poland,3bol61,helipiotr,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:15:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, surely :) First of all, it's hard to deliver a metric to show the student satisfaction. Polish people are well known to complain at all times: it's just the way we are (an example: even though Poland is Europe's booming economy, we are not satisfied enough).  The student relations are superb: even when it's hard everyone will keep a sense of humour and that lets you to go through the Uni even if you know too well how screwed you are.  The lecturers are of opinion that student satisfaction is not something that should influence the difficulty or level of the education. Hence, it is very likely that you will eventually get frustrated with something at one point or another. Good thing is, you will at least learn something well and profit later from it (of course, once again the Polish say: ""you'll forget it anyway"", but that's not true). Sometimes the administration might be irritating. If it happens to you, you can always remind yourself how much coke you can possibly buy for the money you have just saved on your tuition fee (along with a ticket to Colombia). Support - students rarely request help. Hence, if you come for an office hour you are likely to get much attention and time. It varies from lecturer to lecturer how engaged they are: some will even give you their mobile number and ask just not to call too early in the morning. Some are in trouble even with answering emails, but there aren't that many of them. Also, if you attend office hours they will certainly help you."

Everyone speaks English (at least basic), but even basic Polish spoken by a foreigner is seen as a massive advantage and you will profit. Start drinking alcohol, seriously. Unless you have some medical reasons everyone will think you are a weirdo. It is not even about getting drunk: just taste some stuff or keep drinking the same beer for the entire party, you'll be fine. Keep contact with the Polish people.

I don't think it is on par though with the Netherlands and the Nordic countries though, as the ranking suggests.  If you look at EU language proficiency research you'll find that Poland is consistently in the bottom quarter within the EU when it comes to English.

My GF barely speaks English - and by barely - she doesn't speak at all, she is semi coherent in writing and quite well educated in reading. She can watch a movie with English subtitles, but is not able to speak to a native English speaker on her own. This is common for most kids today, since English is not neccessary anymore in common life - games, movies, books, the internet - everything is in Polish. Unless you plan to travel abroad, or work abroad, or have hobbies that require English - all you know is what you got from your elementary and high school - which is almost nothing. I knew more English than my whole class. In high school, over half of my class didn't learn English ever or knew only the basics.

poland,3blhsl,Makonar,3,Tue Jun 30 10:09:30 2015 UTC,"That may be true, but I have a keen ear for English. Whenever I hear people speak it, it gathers my interest. In the very center of Warsaw, next to the biggest train station, about 30 meters from the most famous national tourist attraction - there about 3-5 McDonlads - and in all of them, people behind the cash register have trouble asking customer some basic questions like would you like a single burger or a set with fries and coke, would you like a large coke and fies? - People are barely able to bark one words, and mostly mime or show on the board, and this is common, - and foreigners are very common there, since the train station is the biggest and most frequently used by tourists etc. It would seem like people who work at those places should be selected with minimal levels of English, but no - it's almost common that nobody in the cash registers can speak English just to utter a very simple phrase. The same goes for shopping centers, and people on the street - I've seen people ask others in English - almost no response, and if any - barely able to blurt half a sentence. People are not used to actually speak English, sure in tests - which requires some basic skills in reading and writing English they may look like they are improving, but actually - the fluency is dropping fast. I've work as a translator in big IT companies, translating medical, technical and law documents. I've translated live tele-conferences and I can tell you - speaking is actually a big problem. Since people learn basics in school, but never actually use it - they forget quickly. My sister had her most important exams in English in High School, including the ""maturity exam"" - we take when we finish school - she passed with flying colours, but today she is barely able to write a sentence without massive grammar mistakes - and she works with English websites a lot, she uses a lot of non-localized software but whenever a native speaker arrives for some discussion - they ask me to be there in case they cannot communicate. It's painful to watch how much they struggle with basic words - and they are the minority of people who can actually speak English.     When I went to Germany for vacation - I walked into some big retail store, and ask a clerk if they had some items on stock, which were not available on display - and I tell you, I was so surprised with the level of language this person spoke - it was perfect, coherent and almost with no hing of native accent - very common in Poland and other countries. My sister with her husband, went to Denmark on holiday, and they ended up on some country train station, and were having trouble finding their way around - and no people in sight to ask for directions - they asked some 80 year old lady that was there and she was fluent like any English woman. I personally have had many conversations with people in Germany, Netherlands, Spain and Italy - and I can tell you that besides Itally, those countries are great. Italians are mostly lazy when it comes to languages, and whenever I call them - many of people on the other line are not able to speak to me, but Germany - never had a problem."

poland,3bihro,jedrekk,3,Mon Jun 29 17:52:44 2015 UTC,"It's a different kind of name, not ending in -ski/-cki, so it's normal, she didn't have to choose."

She gets really bent out of shape when people here in Poland mispronounce it but I don't know what she's expecting; it's foreign after all.  As for Susan Wojcicki - she's clearly an American, in America so she gets to pronounce it however she likes."
poland,3bihro,murrayhenson,7,Mon Jun 29 17:48:43 2015 UTC,"My last name is Twardowski, and maybe it's cuz I was born in Poland and speak it, so it seems easy to me - but I find that people even have a tough time pronouncing the ""Americanized"" version of my name. They'll add a random ""r"", and say ""Twardarski"". Didn't think it was that difficult?  Additionally, I don't get why she's combining Polish and English pronunciation of her last name. She combines the ""j"" and ""c"" initially, and then provides the Polish version of ""c"" as ""ts"". It's kinda funny.  Edit: actually I listening again and it sounds like she's ending it with an ""-ski""? Is her name Wojcicki or Wojciski?  If any of you haven't seen it, YouTube ""Americans pronouncing Polish names"", I believe it was a buzzfeed vid. It's hilarious."
poland,3bihro,michaltee,10,Mon Jun 29 20:02:03 2015 UTC,"Also, her name is not Polish anymore, if it was, it would retain the original spelling which most probably was Wójcicki with a ""ó"" (a closed u in the Polish alphabet) and it was changed to the americanized Wojcicki. So many Polish ""sounding"" names are not Polish anymore, since they already changed it - so now they are just weird American surnames."

Also - are you just invited to the wedding (ślub), or the reception (wesele)? It's a big difference that may not be obvious to non-Polish speakers. If you're not attending the reception itself, you're also not expected to bring much of a gift. Wedding guests typically bring flowers and/or wine (this is often specified on the invitation) and then go home.

poland,3b7gur,Fresherty,10,Fri Jun 26 18:05:28 2015 UTC,"1) How does the average Polish person view Iran? USA? Russia?   Take it with grain of salt since obviously I'll probably won't speak for everybody. The way we view people is also different from how we view countries. However, if we're talking about nations and national politics in general:  Iran - I really struggle here. Personally, I have mixed feelings: I'm not keen on theocracies of any sort, and strongly believe religion's place is anywhere but the legal system and government in general (even in Poland we're doing terrible job in my honest opinion). Everything else stems from that. On the other hand I really wish I could, without any fears of prosecution (even if the chances are remote), visit your country. I think you've got very rich and interesting history, and beautiful (if a bit harsh) country. ""Average"" Pole probably doesn't know much about Iran past what mainstream media says, so executions, human right violations, nuclear program and all the bullshit your foreign policymakers love to talk about (mainly threats).  USA - Some say we're more supportive of Americans than Americans themselves. There's some truth in it. The reason is we view USA as only reasonable counterpoint to Russia, and essentially guarantee of our independence. Rest is secondary, really.  Russia - Our relations are really driven by history. We were never allies (literally in our entire history), our country was destroyed by Russia (together with Prussia and Austria), than after regaining independence we bashed heads in interbellum period. After being invaded by Germans and Russians in 1939 we, yet again, lost our country. After 1945 we were de facto Russian (Soviet) puppet state, and just recently managed to truly free ourselves. So the Polish-Russian relationship are that of fear more than anything, especially given Russian opposition to Poland first joining NATO, than EU, constant economical pressure (trade embargoes, natural gas prices manipulation and so on).   2) When would be the best time of year for visiting?   Any time of the year will work IMHO. I personally would suggest September, since it's sill quite hot and it's usually not rainy.   3) What cities do you recommend for a visit?   Pretty much every major city has something going for it. It depends on what exactly you want to do in Poland. The 'standard' would be Warsaw, Kraków, Gdańsk (so called ""Trójmiasto"" in general), Wrocław followed by Mazury (lake district), Tatra Mountains with touch of more recent history represented by Auschwitz-Birkenau Nazi concentration camp and maybe Wieliczka salt mine."

Obviously none of  it will likely put me on death row, and if anything the worst could happen (unless I really go out of my way to piss authorities) is being expelled after brief jail time, and even that is highly unlikely.  Bottom line however is that you don't tempt fate. I'd rather visit countries where I can express myself freely, and that respect my rights to not agree with cultural choices (as long as I respect their culture as such). Obviously, if my work forces me to visit Iran I won't hesitate. However, as holiday destination it's completely unacceptable."

poland,3b7gur,Vertitto,5,Wed Jul 1 20:23:07 2015 UTC,"1   Iran : (personal) i got quite interested last year out of bordom, my attitude is rather possitive, i'v even learnt that Iran took quite a lot of polish refugees during word wars and helped people coming from Syberia. From documentaries i'v seen Teheran is pretty modern and cool city, the mountain panorama, green along with while marbel-like buildings looks amazing. As far as politics go i would love if polish gov made some trade connections. My main problem with Iran is power of religion there.  In general people in Poland are rather ignorant of Iran - many people thing Iran is just another arab country living in theocratic prison. It would be highly unlikely to find a random person on the street that knows Iranains are persians not arabs, that they speak farsi, not arabic and they are in opposition to Saudis  USA: rather possitive, our biggest ally atm and dream heaven during communist time, but i feel some of the decisions polish gov makes to please US go into wrong direction  Russia:  OK (as for any nation). During almost our whole history we had been either in war or in bad relations with Russia. We had a brief time of promising time (that we will finally be in good terms like we menaged to with Germany), but since the Gorgian conflict it gone to shit again   2   January- early March if you are looking for snow  late May - yearly September if you are looking for warm weather  in general not in autumn - it's pretty random: you got high chance to get dull, rainy, cold weather or if you are lucky you may get warm, sunny variant that is called Polish golden autumn   3   obvious ones would be:   Kraków - polish old capital, cultural capital of Poland, as a bonus near town of Wieliczka with it's Salt mine Warsaw - it looked worse than Nagasaki/Hiroshima after WW2, so it's so-so compared to Kraków, lot of the sights got rebuilt though, it's also only city that has proper ""City"" with skyscreapers 3City (Gdańsk, Sopot and Gdynia - polish sea side aglomeration, Gdańsk is full of old places while Sopot is party/curort center of Poland.

poland,3b7gur,kurczakPL,3,Fri Jun 26 19:15:45 2015 UTC,"1) Iran: it's a country we mostly hear about in a negative sense. Whether it is its atom program or the strict muslim law. On the other hand it's quite well known that Iran and particular it's population are really developed and have a verry interesting culture and history. There will be almost no Poles who are fond of your government but all Poles will be verry happy to meet a 'average' Iranian ;)  USA: It is seen as a important military ally. The Americans have stronger opinion when it comes to Putin, rather than the more 'soft' aproach of most EU countries. America will probably give Poland a lot more military aid and a lot faster than the EU countries when shit hits the fan. Besides that Poles have played a important role in US history (Tadeusz Kościuszko) and there is still a really big Polish community in the States, especially in Chicago. There are however mixed feelings about the involvement in the Arab world...  Russia:Yeah where to start... TL;TR not all to positive ;) Poland has been a country for more than 1000 years and during that time the have been numerous conflicts between it and the Russians. It's easier to learn nuclear physics than it is to learn the complex relation between Poland and Russia. The Polish mindset is hugely influenced by history and the two countries never got along all to good to say the least. The Russian Empire, Soviet union and now Putin's Russia have always been our biggest enemy's and it doesn't seem like it will change any time soon. Both countries even have a national holiday in which they remember a victory against the other country. Poland: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_Day_(Poland) Russia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_Day_(Russia) some of he most significant events in that influenced Polish-Russian relations are these:  The Polish muscovite war of 1605-1618, verry important is the Polish occupation of Moscow in 1612 although some Russian history books still deny or nuance it.  The Polish-Soviet war in 1920 that was won by Poland and stopped the soviet ambition to conquer Europe.  The combined german and Russian invasion in 1939. Russia always profiles itself as the 'savior' of Europe from fascism, but fails to remember the Soviet-Nazi pact.  The Katyn massacre in which 20.000 of the most high ranking Polish military personnel, Scholars, Priests, lawyers and other important members of Polish society where executed to essentially 'decapitate' the Polish nation to reduse the chance of a uprising because there where no leaders for the people to rally behind.  45 year of communist rule in Poland. shortly after the war former resistance fighters like Witold Pileczki http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/38g8h9 where killed and the communist authorities silenced any resistance against communism by killing or locking up people who openly criticised the government. 45 years of communism left a bad taste in the mouth of the Polish people and they will not forget it anytime soon, especially with Putin in power.  2) Winter if you really want that christmas feeling, otherwise i would strongly recommend may-august. The weather is verry nice and it gives you the perfect conditions to explore the city's. Many festivals and cultural events also take place in the summer.   3) Krakow is the most popular city for good reasons. It survived WW2, has a huge old town and a verry interesting jewish neighbourhood and lies in the vincinity of Auschwitz, Wieliczka salt mine and Zakopane. Besides being the cultural and medieval-renaissance historical centre of Poland it also has the most bars and clubs per square km in the whole world. Other excellent cities are Warsaw with it's incredibly rebuild old town and verry interesting history concerning WW2 and the city of Gdansk with it's also spectecular old town and with a lot of history when it comes to the anti-communist movement during the cold-war plus it was a verry important trade city during the renaissance. It's also connected to the festival-and-beach city of Sopot and the smaller port city of Gdynia.  edit: spelling"
poland,3b7gur,TedKacz,2,Fri Jun 26 22:51:25 2015 UTC,"1) Iran would bring mixed feelings, on the one hand you've got the Samaritan connection - on the other people could probably expect you to be more of a zealot than what you usually are. USA is generally well liked. Russia varies from disliked to liked but it's commonly distrusted.  2) Late april and may, it's really green round that time and all the trees are blooming. On the flipside it's rather cold (~15 degrees) and it rains frequently.  3) Depending on what you like Krakow, Wroclaw, Zakopane or maybe some lesser known mountainous place like Polanica Zdroj."
poland,3b7gur,FrozMind,2,Fri Jun 26 18:59:23 2015 UTC,"It's hard to speak from perspective of an average Pole, especially about Russia. Remember, that viewing a man and a country is a separate thing. Iran is mostly presented as nuclear theistic previously democratic state and nothing more (as no more info) in our mainstream media, without any regard to people, culture and so on. USA is military driven country with some liberal freedom (gay and so on). Russia is crazy and Russians are crazy. There is no consensus for Russians, if they are crazy positively or negatively. If anyone wants my personal views, I can share it. Most Polish people would recommend summer time, because it's not cold. Each season has it's own traits and it's beautiful on it's own way. I won't discriminate any of season by this way. However, it may depend on with who you'll spend your time. For example, if you'll visit Baltic sea region during time of spring you'll meet German elders instead of Poles. Just pick globally popular Polish towns, such as Krakow, Wroclaw and Warsaw."

I feel Iran got the short end of the stick, when the US ostracised them in the international arena - both following the Embassy crisis, and then during George W. Bush's tenure (I'm thinking of his declaration of the Axis of Evil). I hope Obama's shift in policies will mean Iran won't have to be as isolated internationally.  Iran, to me, is also a kind of a regional power - more than twice as populous as Poland, with economic numbers that put it quite high in the world, so yeah - a regional powerhouse that, I think, has not yet come into its own and is still waiting to realise its full potential.

poland,3b8r62,Vertitto,9,Fri Jun 26 22:33:03 2015 UTC,"as far as Slavic languages go polish and russian are on two sides of the spectrum (there's big difference in vocabulary). From slavic langs Slovak, Czech or Belarusian are easiest to understand imo (personal expirience).  I will describe it this way: they all sound familiar, the sounds, you can recognise some words, but all in all you got little idea what's going on. With some explaination, saying things in different way we can grasp the general sense. It's not as simple as between norwegian, swedish and danish though.  Let's say it's similair to swedish-german case"
poland,3b8r62,jrojek,8,Fri Jun 26 22:10:23 2015 UTC,"Slovakian - pretty easy to understand without any previous contact. Czech - slightly more difficult, but also possible. Before being exposed to it, I couldn't understand much Russian. Once I learned the alphabet as a child, I could guess the meaning of much of what I was reading. I would say spoken Russian is not very easy to understand at first, due to different phonetics. Once you get used to it, you can catch the similarities. Ukrainian is closer to Polish than Russian, and I understand it pretty well. I guess that is also thanks to knowing some Russian. Croatian/Serbian/Bosnian: I can understand most of what I read. If the locals make the effort to speak slowly and using basic vocabulary, these are also usually intelligible. One thing I noticed in Croatia: people who deal with tourists on a regular basis, are using a mix of Croatian/Polish/Russian/Czech which sounds pretty funny, but makes it easier to communicate."

poland,3b8r62,ajuc,7,Fri Jun 26 22:28:25 2015 UTC,"Never studied any foreign Slavic language. I'm Polish.  Russian and Polish are quite far apart as Slavic languages go. I rarely understand anything from Russian. I do know cyrylic script (but the Ukrainian version) from a few days I've spend in L'viv.  Polish and Czech or Slovak are much closer, and I can understand stuff like half of the time. The other half of the time I'm not sure what they are trying to tell me, but it sounds impossibly funny and cute :)  Also Ukrainian is supposedly something in between Russian and Polish, and should be further from Polish than Slovak, but it has lots of words and phrases taken straight from Polish, so it's actually the easiest to understand for me.  And the Serbian etc are in between Ukrainian and Russian in terms of easy understanding.  Also - if I'm in some country for a few days it becomes much easier to understand."
poland,3b8r62,dorothyrowe,4,Sat Jun 27 03:48:38 2015 UTC,"From personal experience: no. I have met many Ukrainians and Russians, never could understand what they were saying in their native languages. Apparently, Czech and Slovakian are fairly similar to Polish, but never been there so it's difficult to say."
poland,3b8r62,bereneko,3,Sat Jun 27 06:54:18 2015 UTC,"I studied Russian for ~3 years, but even before that I could understand single words (although often they mean something different than in Polish, even though they sound familiar). So, single words from Russian, Czech and Slovakian, that's about it. I would not be able to make a conversation though. Although as a kid I managed to make a conversation in full Polish with a vendor speaking only Slovakian :P We somehow understood each other, but it was pretty funny. A lot of gesturing was needed."

My Ukranian Friend (who speaks Russian) and I will often start speaking in our native languages and see if we can understand each other. There are some words that sound similar or the same (like ryba or kot), but to me, russian sounds like a really really drunk Polish person trying to talk. The language sounds more slurred and mumbled to me than other west slavic languages like Czech which I can understand a bit more. As for southern slavic languages, I can't say i've listened to them enough to hear any similarities."
poland,3b8r62,_marcoos,5,Sun Jun 28 03:57:25 2015 UTC,"From my perspective from the most to least inteligible when spoken:   Silesian and Kashubian (considered dialects of Polish by some people) Lower- and Upper-Lusatian (closest West Slavic languages other than the two in #1) Ukrainian (East Slavic, but with lots of borrowings from Polish), Czech, Slovak (West Slavic), Belarusian (East Slavic, some borrowings from Polish) Slovenian, Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian/Montenegrin/whatever-else-it's-called (South Slavic) Bulgarian, Macedonian (South Slavic) Russian (East Slavic)   I didn't know I understand so much of Ukrainian until last year, when I watched live transmissions from Euromaidan on Hromadske and Espreso.tv every day for several weeks. These days, as I know some Cyrillic and also wrote myself a transliteration bookmarklet that converts Ukrainian Cyrillic into something resembling Lozynskyi's Ukrainian Latin alphabet (Lozynskyi's alphabet looks as if he tried to be as close to Polish as possible), I read Ukrainian news in its original, without translation. It's even easier to understand if you know the basic rules, e.g. Polish ""ó"" is very often ""i"" in Ukrainian (e.g. Lwów - Львів/Lwiw).  Russian is a special case, because not only phonology is the most odd one out of all Slavic languages, their vocabulary is also significantly different."
poland,3b8r62,ImielinRocks,2,Sat Jun 27 12:03:05 2015 UTC,"Silesian and Kashubian are the easiest (but almost everyone using those knows at least some Polish anyway, so that's seldom needed, unless you're eavesdropping), Slovak and to some extent Czech and the Sorbian languages are okay if you're not using any complicated words, but damn those false friends can make it annoying. It took me way too long to finally get what the hell ""počúvať"" means, for example."

Basically, at night some folks grill kielbasa in front of a van and it is a really tasty, classic Polish meal for not too much money. If you go on a busy night, it is quite a spectacle to see 50+ people in line while the kielbasa people twirl the skewered sausages.

If Poland refused to register a child because their parents were of different races, do you seriously think the ECtHR would be OK with that?   As for the article 8, it doesn't say anything about citizenship, it's only about ""private and family life, home and correspondence"".   Right, but the reason the child can't get citizenship is because Poland refuses to recognize her family.  If the case was a foregone conclusion, then they wouldn't be bringing it."

poland,3a9fxh,AryanBrothelhood,18,Thu Jun 18 07:37:53 2015 UTC,"That's a historic name, based on word 'Lah/Leh', that's probably based on the Lendians tribe that lived in our general region around the 7th century. That name seems to have stuck with non-Christian (at that time) neighbours even after Baptism of Poland (the time where Poland ""officially"" accepted Christianity). I've found no direct reference to why that happened - though if I had to take a guess, the name Poland (Latin Polania) first appeared in Latin hagiographies (biographies of Christian saints), which might explain why it's less widely used outside the ""Christian circle"".  EDIT: might not be obvious from what I wrote above, but the general idea is that you're not alone in that name for Poland, similar ones are used in IIRC Hungary, Turkey, Ukraine and probably several others I'm not able to list."
poland,3a9fxh,decPL,3,Thu Jun 18 07:55:55 2015 UTC,"Among languages that use that name for Poland I can also think of Armenian (Լեհաստան / Lehastan) and Lithuanian (Lenkija). In Turkish it used to be Lehistan, now it is Polonya. In Hungarian it is Lengyelország."
poland,3a9fxh,jrojek,7,Thu Jun 18 08:48:16 2015 UTC,"The ""Lengy"" part of ""Lengyelország"" is pronounced virtually the same way as ""Lędzi"" in ""Lędzianie"". It's clear that the Hungarian name comes from the Lendians. This proto-Polish tribe that lived in current South-East of Poland was probably the first ""Poles"" the proto-Hungarians met.  This ""pars pro toto"" naming is something that happens from time to time. The French call the Germans ""Allemands"", after the Allemanni tribe, which lived in the West. Yet, Estonians call the Germans ""Sakslased"", because the ""German"" tribe they had the most contact with initially were the Saxons, living in the East.  Same thing here - peoples living to the East and South-East of Poland had initially more contacts with the Lendians, so that's how the former Turkish name ""Lehistan"", the Ukrainian and Russian slur ""Lyakh"" and the Hungarian name ""Lengyelország"" were coined.  The Polans lived in Western Poland, so they were the tribe that the Germans, Danes, Swedes, Czechs etc. most often had to deal with. They were also the most powerful tribe that conquered all the other tribes until the late 10th century, so not just most of the exonyms are based on their name, but the endonym ""Polska"" as well."

Some people have problems with taking in refugees from outside Europe, but no one here even suggests closing off borders for normal EU citizens who just want to move elsewhere, like some other countries in the West do.

poland,3a5757,decPL,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:53:34 2015 UTC,"You mentioned rules about who fits and who doesn't, that's obviously a way for one country to gather the 'better' part than another.  I think, you maybe misinterpret me? It's 'better' not better intentionally. The rules can e anything, but one thing is for sure, the country can get what they would prefer.  I only see one reason for accepting them: saving them from death and I believe that's why such things should be done (are done?)."
poland,3a5757,destiriser,2,Wed Jun 17 16:16:26 2015 UTC,"Are you saying that a person that would fit better in Polish culture is the same as the one who'd fit better in the UK? If you do, then the term better without any apostrophe is validated, at least according to such a logic. I'd disagree, but then that's just my opinion.  As for the reason for accepting them; I know the term diversity is used as a negative in Poland, but I personally come to accept its benefits - progress is not driven by people thinking alike."
poland,3a5757,decPL,0,Wed Jun 17 17:15:24 2015 UTC,"You've said about rules on which country would choose what immigrant gets in, they can choose the one with a degree in rocket science you know and they will probably think it's a better guy than the 90 year old alcohol connoisseur and they will have him not the other country which got that other lad.  If by thinking you mean color of the skin, religion or native country then I agree, otherwise I dont get how can that have anything to do with thinking or progress. You'll provide much more diversity in erm, what people think in Poland(?) by altering he educational system, I think education is the first thing people look at when they want to achieve such thing, just an opinion though."

It is difficult to say if Poland SHOULD or not, but after all I think that immigrants would probably do good to the country, in all honesty I love Polish people but some variety of culture and thoughts could be beneficial. I have had the chance to meet refugees from Eritrea and they are REALLY nice people, they have had it rough. If Poland ends up accepting these refugees just remember that you are not against their person but against the decision taken, I guess what I'm trying to say in few words is ""don't be a dick to them"""

Pure conjecture on my part: see if you can dig up some sources on 18th-19th century Polish peasant social mores.

poland,39zd10,yellowpage09,8,Tue Jun 16 00:41:55 2015 UTC,"I'll try to explain why deflation is bad in simple terms.  Deflation is a huge problem for countries with a significant debt, because its real value raises while its nominal value stays the same. If you owe someone 100 € and the next year you still owe them 100 €, it's more difficult to raise that money to pay them back. It becomes a problem when you really have to pay.  On international level this is also a problem, because imported goods become effortlessly more competitive than their domestic counterparts. In 1997 in Hong Kong the market was flooded with cheap Chinese products, and local companies were unable to keep afloat.  It is also problematic for companies, because they have no incentive to invest. Investment means spending money in order to harvest more money in the future. But if you spend 100 € today in order to get back 120 €, but the next week you would only need 95€ to get back the same amount, it becomes more rational to wait a moment. Now when you need to spend 100 thousand, this becomes a lot of money. So you don't want to invest right now. But without investment the company stagnates. And when the company is big, this affects the whole economy. It has happened before, as it has led to economic stagnation in the 1990s in Japan.  On personal level the deflation seems like a good thing, because for the same amount of money you get more goods. Except it only works for a moment. When your company cannot compete with the companies abroad, they will need to cut costs, and fire somebody. This may be you. Deflation is good for you today, but bad tomorrow.  One more thing: 2% is indeed deep deflation. When you have an asset that loses 50% of its value, it needs to get back 100% to reclaim it. When your object loses 50% of 100zl, it's worth 50zl. Now, to be worth again 100zl, it needs to raise 50zl in value, which is the double of what it is currently worth. The deflation rate is actually should be regarded as double of the inflation rate, to keep the scale.  This is VERY simplified, so please don't take anything very seriously."
poland,39zd10,klugg,7,Tue Jun 16 13:47:31 2015 UTC,"Not an economic expert, so maybe I should keep my fat mouth shut, but: we're constantly told by everyone and their brother how a bit of deflation (suddenly ~1% is deep deflation) is a severe economic problem, a fiscal disaster for a country and the herald of an upcoming financial Armageddon. Yet whenever I've lived in a country affected by deflation, I always failed to see the negative effects on the economy. I'll guess we'll live and see..."
poland,39zd10,decPL,5,Tue Jun 16 08:09:45 2015 UTC,Deflation means that money that you have are worth more in than they were year before. With translate to lowering the prize of products. It always baffle me how this could be wrong. It is like giving people raise without giving them more money.
poland,39zd10,Bortasz,5,Tue Jun 16 09:02:16 2015 UTC,"I think it's quite obvious what the downsides are - if the money is worth more, it's harder to compete with products from outside the country - both internally and externally. Also, if you have a loan in PLN, you essentially need to pay more and more for it each year.  But it's not as if inflation does not have a negative effect - what I don't get is how come a 2-3% inflation is within reason, but 1% deflation is a near-catastrophe as some claim."
poland,39zd10,decPL,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:41:14 2015 UTC,No they do not have to pay more if they have loan in PLN. If they in other currency than maybe. But you question is good one... Maybe ask reddit economists?
poland,39zd10,Bortasz,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:47:26 2015 UTC,No they do not have to pay more if they have loan in PLN.   They do - for the very reason you stated before. The same amount of PLN is worth more due to deflation.
poland,39zd10,decPL,0,Tue Jun 16 09:52:25 2015 UTC,Okey maybe in that way: If I have monthly payment on my loan 100 PLN.. after 1% of deflation I still have to pay 100Pln not a 101PLN... That why I mean by not paying more.
poland,39zd10,Bortasz,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:57:56 2015 UTC,"Using your simplification - you have monthly loan of 100PLN. If you didn't have that loan, you could buy 100 pieces of gum with your 100PLN. After 1% deflation you still pay 100PLN in your loan, but that 100PLN would buy you 101 pieces of gum if it wasn't consumed by your liability. Your nominal liablity doesn't change, but your loan relative to price of everything else grows."

If there is deflation, wages will go lower after enough time has passed as well, but the loan will stay the same.  You earned 1000 PLN(for simplicity), but after 2 years with 10% deflation you get paid 810 PLN instead, your loan stays 100 PLN, but has gone from 1/10 of your wage to ~1/8  I chose 10% deflation because simplicity and that I don't understand what is the fuss about 1%, as it's pretty much meaningless."
poland,39zd10,ca1ek,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:42:35 2015 UTC,"It's a very naive way of looking at money and costs, especially when discussing inflation/deflation.  Imagine that we have a perfectly balanced system: because of 1% deflation your employer has 1% less income. He can't really cut expenditures, so you negotiate and your salary is decreased 1% to make it up. You're no longer making 1000 PLN weekly, but 990. You're a considerate person and you realize that it's not really a reduction, as you can buy the same amount of goods with it - and you know that it's either that or getting fired (say your company employs 100 people - someone would have to be fired). And you're still paying 100 PLN each month for the loan - aren't you paying more?  Alternatively - let's say that you've managed to avoid a salary reduction. But before the deflation you had to pay the equivalent of 100 loaves of bread for your loan (say you like the cheap ones); now you need to ""pay"" 101 loaves. Not paying more?"

If you know that in six months, thanks to deflation, you could buy a bigger car, would you buy the small car now, or the bigger one in six months?  (Of course, a lot would depend on circumstances and needs.)  The underlying point, though, is that with deflation, it's better for you to not spend money today, because you'll get more for your money tomorrow.  Edit: for what it's worth, this can also include investment. Why take the risk of investing, when you can keep your money safe and have it worth more just sitting there on its own?  In theory, this lead should lead to people spending less money, less often, and therefore the economy declines.  In a kinda ironic twist, the opposite of this - spend, spend, spend! - is what helped Poland to avoid the Europe-wide recession a few years back."

Why would that negatively impact the party targeted?  In US politics, we have a concept known as an ""October Surprise"". Since elections happen in early November, things that look negative are frequently released on the opposition in October. The intention being that updated information, corrections, and necessary context won't proliferate quickly enough to mitigate the damage.   Is that the concern here? If so, isn't it long enough ago that people who would be bothered are already aware?  Last question (probably not, but at least last in this post): Are the ministers who resigned out of the party altogether and unlikely to be part of the upcoming elections, or are their resignations temporary and likely to re-enter the government after the next election.

That's his personality, but as for his politics, besides of fluent knowladge of English and some contacts, i'd say he was a medicore if not just lazy and incompetent minister. Besides of his private opinions about USA there was also an interviev in Politico, which was just embarassing for him, as well as for Donald.  The tapes, besides of not very diplomatic language about USA, contains also plotting against opposition, but most of all possible corruption, an offer of a ""help"" for the biggest Polish oligarch in his foreign interest and privatisation of a one public company."

His career started to go bad when Tusk left and was replaced by Kopacz - I don't think becoming the marshal was really a promotion in his case... I guess she just doesn't like him, so now she had a chance to get rid of him. He doesn't really have a lot of friends in PO, mostly because he's a bit of an outsider (he came from PiS) and he isn't a member of any internal fraction within the party (also it doesn't help that he's got a pretty arrogant personality...)."

It could be just a 20th century knife made as someone's weekend hobby project but the shape of the knife and the floral pattern is either Islamic or inspired by Islamic art - as in Polish eg Sarmatism.

As I recall, we're putting some tanks and F-16s there for now and establishing a permanent base somewhere down the line. I think it's a good and bad idea. It's good, because it's providing some peace of mind and fortifying the border in case Russia goes full fucking expansion mode. On the other hand, it's bad because it gives that nutter, Putin, an excuse to just roll up more tanks and missiles because ""muh western agression"" which is a response to RUSSIAN AGRESSION WHICH STARTED THE WHOLE DAMN THING. But that's just my opinion. I might be wrong, and I don't have a degree or anything, but from what I've seen, Putin just wants to gobble up Ukraine and is throwing out all these BS excuses so that the entire European Union or whatever doesn't have a legitimate reason to wipe Russia off the map."

It wasn't that long ago you'd have to deposit any bags, backpacks etc. before entering a shop, since the fear of shoplifting was so high.  Certainly, the thugs at Saturn are the reason I no longer shop there, and they don't get the premium payment I'm willing to make for same-day pickup.

A guard there once saved me from making a bad purchase, because he suggested inspecting a laptop I bought and actually found a flaw on the screen.   Honest question not related to Saturn in particular: would you have had many issues returning the laptop for being defective, had you left the store with it?  The longer I've been based in Poland, the more it seems that consumer rights are close to non-existent, and trading laws very much favour companies of any and all sizes.

I can see your point there - I'll avoid a store or retailer if they make me angry as well. This is why I don't buy Ubisoft games for example.  As for the Saturn situation - I don't think I'd have a problem in returning the laptop - it had a pretty ridiculous varranty that covered all damage regardless of source. I could have literally thrown it out the window right there in the mall and have it repaired with no questions asked. If it didn't have that though it could go either way - depending on if I could convince them that the scrath on the surface was there to begin with. I guess if I unpacked the laptop at home, noticed the scrath and run right back they'd give me no problems. The scrath was pretty small though and in the very corner, so I'd probably notice it after a week or so - good luck convincing anyone it was there to begin with. In this case it turned out that their entire supply of those laptops were damaged in one way or another. The sales guy suggested they might have been damaged during transport and I ended up buying a different brand from a different manufacturer.   I guess I'm lucky though, because I generally have a good record with various customer services. Just yesterday I was at a home decoration store to return a bucket of paint. I've had no receipt or anything, only a vague memory of when the purchase was and what I've bought. I fully expected to be turned down, but the awesome CS lady helped me find the transaction and I got a refund anyway. I've also had some adventures with my phone and tablet - they were always accepted for repairs right away and noone gave me any problems about those."

EU, especially Germany wants Poland to ""share"" some space for them, while Polish people don't want alien immigrants, because they have problem with employment and economy, fearing the price is too high for such help (for war refugees).

This might be hard to believe, but I can tell you that the first time I saw a black person was when I moved to Kraków to study. I stared the poor guy down pretty hard and felt like some backwater moron when I realized what I did. Even now I might be a bit startled to see a person of color in Kurdwanów or Ruczaj district.

Still, based on your description you stand out and that in itself might draw the guards attention. It's most likely not malice, they're just a little paranoid - guess it comes with the job. You can always speak to the store manager if you feel they're overstepping their bounds.  On the street it's probably mostly curiosity. As you've most likely noticed we don't have many people of color in Poland, so again someone who stands out will naturally draw attention, especially if it's a pretty girl - you might look like an ""exotic beauty"" to some guys :) Again though, if you feel stalked you can talk to the police. If someone is giving you trouble in a restaurant you can ask the manager to get rid of them, etc.  Ignoring them is probably the best thing you can do. Waving, winking, smiling, etc. can go in many ways - some guys will be embarrased you've noticed they're staring, others might see it as an invitation."

Unless you're in Warsaw, the rest of the country isn't very exposed to people outside of the ""race"" besides on tv so it's interesting and different....and basically a spectacle.

The fact You're a foreigner is enough itself for people to ""keep an eye on You"". Maybe in Kraków people should be more used to that, since it's a very poplar city among people from other countries, but keep in mind it's been only three decades since we got out of the soviet block, where white people were the only kind of people anybody would ever see.  I'd probably be one of these guys that ""stare"" because You're attractive (well, not stare, since I try to avoid that, but still 0 it's just hard not to look at a good looking girl). If You are a good looking girl by polish standards it's just that and skin color is not that important. You should be happy that You catch their looks in that case. :P  I have no experience as somebody who would be looked at, as I simply would not stand out in a crowd here, but if You would smile to me, I would probably smile back and  just carry on with my business. My bet is that most younger and middle aged people would do the same, but that also depends on who You will run into ... people from larger cities don't care, but if they're from rural areas, You might as well be the first ""dark skinned"" person they've ever seen, so there is also some understanding needed on Your side.  I hope You'll get used to it soon and it won't bother You that much. It's not their fault often, that there are barely any other people in Poland than Caucasian looking white folk. :)"

poland,39pl7m,Tex-to-speech-device,28,Sat Jun 13 14:48:34 2015 UTC,The pole-catholic is a proto nationalist identity from way back in the 17the century and really blossomed into its own during the Partitions of Poland. The Catholicism contrasted with Russia's Orthodox Church and Prussia's Protestantism. It was later cemented by the church's position as a center of opposition to Communism in the second half of the 20th century.
poland,39pl7m,jedrekk,3,Sat Jun 13 15:41:56 2015 UTC,Thanks. Would you say that there is a resurgence of the catholic part of polish identity following the recent situation with Russia and Ukraine ? Also do you feel that polish messianism switched from being religion based to democracy/rule of law based (I know that Poland has a long history of political liberalism too). ?
poland,39pl7m,jedrekk,7,Sat Jun 13 16:07:44 2015 UTC,"Not really, that seems to causing more of a nationalist resurgence though. The Pope's death was probably the last great faith event Poland, but the general long term trend is negative. Fewer and fewer Poles (especially the young) are going to mass, fewer and fewer are joining the clergy. I think the perception might be that the church is gaining steam, but from here it seems like they're fighting back against their diminished influence in public life.   Also do you feel that polish messianism switched from being religion based to democracy/rule of law based    I think Catholicism is generally like that. The only place in public discourse where you'll actually see people talking about ""god's law over man's law"" is in discussing abortion and birth control."
poland,39pl7m,I_Plunder_Booty,4,Sat Jun 13 16:34:29 2015 UTC,"The last time I went to Poland was around 4 years ago. I spent a day in Czestochowa and while I was there I saw thousands of kids and teens in catholic youth groups doing wholesome stuff like sing alongs and having picnics. Later I spent a few days in Krakow and saw a bunch of clergy in training around the city and the various churches I was touring. Dozens upon dozens of priests and nuns all under the age of 25. And during the few weeks I was there the main news story that had everyone glued to the TV were the 24 hour protests being held in Warsaw due to the fact that the government finally removed a giant cross that was placed in memorial of the president's death.  So while Poland is a little less religious then the days that John Paul II was the pope, they are still astronomically more religious then other countries such as America. Poland is still by a huge margin a Catholic Nation. Just because you don't want it to be because it contrasts with your leftist views...doesn't mean it isn't."
poland,39pl7m,jedrekk,13,Sat Jun 13 18:09:56 2015 UTC,"That's great and all... but none of the things you say contradict my observations or my ""leftist views""(?).  The battle for the cross outside the Presidential Palace had very little to do with religion - Bronisław Komorowski spent almost a decade as a teacher at a seminary - and everything to do with politics.   I spent a day in Czestochowa and while I was there I saw thousands of kids and teens in catholic youth groups doing wholesome stuff like sing alongs and having picnics.   Częstochowa is home of one of the biggest churches in Poland and where the vast majority of Polish pilgrimages end up. It'd be as if you went to Salt Lake City and came back telling us how the US is full of Mormons.  Now for some numbers:  And you might have seen nuns and priests in training, but the number of priests in training dropped by half between 2003 and 2011. You might have seen catholic youth groups, but the number of Poles going to church regularly has dropped from 57% to 39% in the past 33 years - that's a drop of 1/3. While 172k couples had church weddings in 2007 (71% of all weddings), just four years later it was 134k (64%).   The post JPII spiritual up-tick was completely wiped out by 2010.    So while Poland is a little less religious then the days that John Paul II was the pope, they are still astronomically more religious then other countries such as America.   I never said and would never say otherwise, what I am saying is that the influence of the church is waining. For the current generation of political leaders here, who came up in communist Poland, the church is a political ally, a symbol of freedom against communism. For a lot of millennials, it's a bunch of old men who nag, moan, and complain while waving around gold cups, boring church services they're forced to go to now and then, and boring classes in school they had to take."

It wasn't religion in opposition to democracy, it was religion as source of hope for return of idealized (democratic - at least for nobles, and vastly more democratic than Russian in any case) system.  Polish messianism was more of middle-class (inteligencja) and nobles movement, not poor people (workers and farmers) movement. As such it wasn't really Catholic. Nobles in Poland had long tradition of religious tolerance, and the alegory of Christ resurection works just as well for protestants and orthodox, so the religion wasn't the important distinction.  Pole-Catholic was attempt to instill Polish identity into lower classes (successful I think). Nobles had (idealized) memories of Commonwealth (with golden liberty, tolerance etc) so they didn't needed the religious motivation.  Messianism was also closely related to revolutionary movements, seen as a way to destroy Russian Empire and gain freedom. It was peculiar kind of socialism supported by young rich people :). There were also religious-politic sects, like Towiańczycy, that weren't really Catholic (it was more like scientology TBH), but were really into messianism (and important Poles, like Mickiewicz, were involved, Mickiewicz even wrote some opaque mistical books that were supposed to be ""New Testament for Poles"")."

poland,39pl7m,ajuc,2,Sat Jun 13 15:12:37 2015 UTC,"Polish state in its most succesfull period (Commonwealth) had around 30-40% of non-Catholics, including over-representation among the ruling class (nobles).  Then partitions happened, and while higher classes had reason to want Commonwealth back - lower classes weren't really citizens, so they were like ""whatever, just don't burn my hut"".  So higher classes thought - let's use religion as identifying factor. And they started the succesfull PR campaign. January uprising was the first time it beared some fruits (farmers fighting together with nobles against Russians).   Funny thing - at the time Pope was against any uprisings and revolutions (socialism was the scary word), so they were against Polish uprisings and supported Russian Empire :)  It worked out pretty well after WW2, too, when most of non-Catholic Poles were either murdered, expelled, or annexed into USSR."
poland,39pl7m,szyy,2,Fri Jun 19 09:13:51 2015 UTC,"I think it kinda ends right now. Yes, Poland is still hella conservative but among younger generations conservatism isn't tied to religion anymore. I was actually kinda surprised to discover that but many of my friends who haven't been in church for years (or who are anti-clerical) are quite conservative.   But still, Polak-katolik is quite present among the older generation. The funny thing is that most of these people treat Catholic faith not as a real religion, rather as a tradition (although still believing in god). For example, although 88% of Poles are baptised, only 10% is against in-vitro procedure which is now a hot topic in Poland and the Church threatens to excommunicate people who are participaning in in-vitro. They also know nothing about their own church's teachings. For instance, more Polish Catholics believe in destiny (66%) than in ressurection of the dead (62%), original sin (59%) or hell (56%). If asked about Saint Trinity, many Polish middle-schoolers would answer that it consists of Jesus, Mary and Saint Joseph or even John Paul II."

But knowing what to expect is always good ;)"
poland,39m1d6,lukeatlook,6,Fri Jun 12 20:35:40 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you define hiking - you can go on a lovely walk through the valleys, but the best views are if you climb somewhere higher. Always remember to:   buy a map get a light raincoat and sunscreen (yes, both of them for the same route, you might need them one after the other) get a SIM starter card from Plus or activate roaming (there's a quite good reception for emergency calls) get good food (chips and candy - no, sandwiches and candy bars/chocolate - yes) and water wear proper shoes (just something solid and comfortable, new unworn shoes, sandals or thin-soled sneakers are a bad idea)   If you make proper reservations, you could probably design a route with overnight stays in shelters, but it's also possible to simply stay in town, get a bus to the entrance, climb up, climb down and go back. That's what most people do.  Example one-day routes away from the crowd:   For starters: Dolina Chochołowska - Long (9km?) walk along the valley. Not as crowded as other valleys. Shelter at the end, you can sit down and enjoy some tea and apple pie. Climbing, but not too much: Zazadnia - Dolina Złota valley - Sanctuary (just a church, some Pope memorabilia) - Rusinowa Polana (great view point) - Gęsia Szyja (literally: Goose Neck) - Rówień Waksmundzka - west to Murowaniec shelter - climb down through Dolina Suchej Wody valley. You'll see some nice views and climb a low-tier peak (Gęsia Szyja). If you made some arrangements in Murowaniec you can stay the night, see the last route. Climbing more: Kiry - Dolina Kościeliska - After 20 minutes, escape that bloody highway and turn left towards Przysłop Miętusi - Enter blue route and walk it for 2-3 hours - You're now at the peak of Czerwone Wierchy (one of them, Małołączniak) and on the Polish-Slovakian border - Move to the next peak: Kopa Kondracka - You can now move north to Giewont or skip it - Climb down to Dolina Kondratowa (shelter) and down to Kuźnice. You will climb the peak of the very middle of the Polish Tatry mountains. The route is long and gets you 2000 m high, but nothing too steep. My personal favourite: Kuźnice - Jaworzynka valley - Murowaniec shelter - Gąsienicowa valley along the Czarny Staw Gąsienicowy lake - Zawrat pass (hard climb assisted with chains, breathtaking views once you get there) - climb down the other side to the Dolina Pięciu Stawów Polskich (again, best possible view) - shelter in the valley - two possible routes: either climb straight down, or go through blue route to approach the nearby Morskie Oko from a way better angle that's not as crowded as the main road (you'll be coming back from Morskie Oko with the crowd, though). One of the best one-day routes you can do in the Tatry mountains, but it's heavily recommended you do NOT try this as your first route. The chain-assisted section puts heavy psychological strain on some climbers (went there with friends, one of them broke down crying as we made it to the top - I personally saw no trouble at all and enjoyed the hell out of it). (Too) hardcore: From Zawrat starts the infamous Orla Perć - it's basically the extension of the Zawrat chain climb, but longer, crazier, and one-way (no turning back) - and planning this for a one day trip is not a good idea. You could do it if starting (and possibly ending) in Murowaniec.   Overall when planning hikes use the time suggested by maps. A young, athletic person without heavy luggage will move the distance in 50-70% of the specified time, but it's always better to plan ahead."

I got sunburnt on the Czerwone Wierchy route even though the weather was cold and windy until for the most of it - but by the time we got to Kopa Kondracka, the clouds were below us and the sky was clear. Over the next few hours my neck became red."
poland,39m1d6,Radomierzanin,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:26:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I'm going to print it out and take it with me :) Right know I think the best option is to take the bus from Krakow to Zakopane and make 2 or 3 day-trips from there, is that right? I was thinking of going to Babia Gora national park too, do you know if there is a bus link between Zakopane and Zawoja?"
poland,39m1d6,psionides,3,Sat Jun 13 13:22:02 2015 UTC,"Right know I think the best option is to take the bus from Krakow to Zakopane and make 2 or 3 day-trips from there, is that right?   Zakopane and the surrounding villages is the main ""hub"". The main street Krupówki is crowded with people and you'll find tons of souvenirs, pubs and restaurants there. Try to not look too vulnerable or naive - it's not Paris, but thiefs and scammers are everywhere (never fell victim to one, but better safe than sorry).  Your orientation point should be the bus/train station in Zakopane (they're next to each other), where you can find the minibuses that can take you pretty much everywhere. Sometimes you'll just have to wait until the bus gets more people. I have no confirmation on this, but I'd expect a bit higher prices if you don't speak Polish - these guys don't always run 100% legal, but their prices and service is usually very solid, when the bus is full riding along is really cheap. So, you take such bus, name the destination: ""Kuźnice"", ""Dolina Chochołowska"", ""Dolina Kościeliska"" (they'll drop you out at the entrance to the valley you name). Basically it's: look at the map, look at the nearest entrance, name the place. Or even not that. If you just named a popular place you want to climb to, they'd drop you off at the proper entrance anyway (for example, if a tourist says ""Morskie Oko"", they sigh and drop them at the beginning of the ASPHALTED NINE KM PROMENADE).  As for getting to Zakopane, personally I've always been fond of trains (been car sick when I was a kid), and it's a long tedious road either way, but by bus it's 3 hours, and by train it's 5. If you didn't book a room in town, you'll find plenty of signs ""Wolne pokoje""/""Free rooms""/""Zimmer frei"". I haven't been there in years, so I can't really vouch for any particular location. If your designated host is far away from the bus station, you can always check the local bus timetable, and getting a stop or two shouldn't be expensive.  Babia Góra national park - Never been there, never heard anything good or bad about that place, and it seems awfully far away (there's one bus per day leaving at 18:00). In my personal opinion the Tatry mountains are interesting enough on their own, but if you insist on leaving them, I'd rather suggest Trzy Korony, which is a bit closer to Tatry. From what I've heard, there's a nice kayaking trail through there, and/or you can climb the peak. Above all, though, I'd suggest you take your time to make sure to visit the places nearer to Kraków, like Auschwitz and the Wieliczka salt mine.  Side note: The climbing routes I've presented are somewhat ambitious. Make sure to try one of the easy routes (#1 or #2) before the hard ones (#3 and #4) and God fucking forbid you from ever turning east at Zawrat (#5), you're supposed to climb down from there. If you try my favourite (#4), get out early, take water and provisions (you'll stop at two to three shelters, so you can buy stuff there as well - ""szarlotka"" is apple pie, ""herbata"" is tea), and take pictures (you'll pass by about 7 beautiful lakes).  If you have any specific preferences (rivers, caves, lakes, peaks) go ahead and ask. I miss Tatry dearly and would go there in a heartbeat if I could afford it, so I'm more than happy to talk more about it :D"

poland,39l6s6,a7med_faisal,6,Fri Jun 12 14:34:40 2015 UTC,"Hi there Ahmed! Thanks for taking interest in studying in Poland. I will try to answer all the questions in the order you inquired. 1. Art - well, that is a very broad discipline. It really depends what kind of art are you actually interested in. Realistically speaking, it might be very hard for you to proceed in any area if you haven't taken any interest before - universities take great care of selecting only the most promising students. People who are genuinely interested are very often rejected, just bear it in mind before you proceed any further.  2. Anyway, I will just assume you have a great talent towards your discipline and describe further details. First, Unis in Poland are free only for EU students, and as Egypt is not in the EU, you will obviously have to find cash to pay your fees. These can be 10k€ / year at Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. Once you are done with that, you need to pack your bags and just come here. The easiest way to start studying is to apply for a handful courses with English as a lecturing language, this may also help you since most of the talented Polish people choose Polish language courses. However, I warn you, you will need to learn the language to enter the artistic community for good. It's hard, but you will need to overcome this in order to be able to work as an artist. Also, you will need to adopt Polish lifestyle and view on the world, if you want to be considered a serious part in your professional and social life. From my perspective, it requires a careful planning and great effort to actually do what you want to do. It might be the right choice, but you might not succeed.  Here is a small list of Unis that might help you, just remember to search for less renown ones if you don't success here: -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Film_School_in_%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Aleksander_Zelwerowicz_National_Academy_of_Dramatic_Art_in_Warsaw http://www.asp.waw.pl/ http://www.asp.krakow.pl/ http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akademie_sztuk_pi%C4%99knych_w_Polsce Also, consider a MSc in accountancy. This will give you 2 years to learn a language and to find a job in Poland, which is crucial if you want to stay here for longer. Once you are settled and familiar with the country, it will be way easier for you to pursue any further goals."

I only took control very recently, and I inherited an organizational mess of a publication that is corporate-owned in name only and whose print version (which carried the advertising mentioned by /u/ZiggyPox below) stopped running because of that mess.  It's my ambition to fix that. Because I think it's very important to have a voice for people who want to communicate in English, be they foreign or Polish. I want to rebrand as well; find fresher and more interesting content with heart -- and it is definitely there -- in a city many English speakers just know for its less-than-rosy history. A big part of that for me, along with of course finding interested writers, is providing a forum for the excellent artistic community here to share their work, which we haven't done enough in the past -- one of the reasons I decided to make this a contest open to anyone despite the fact that I'm a competent graphic designer.  And I'm in the same boat. I've donated my time as well, getting basically nothing for nearly two years of feature articles, design, editing, layout, networking, etc. which is sometimes nearly a full-time job along with my regular one. This 100 PLN is coming out of my own pocket after paying ZUS/NFZ. (✖╭╮✖) But still, I wanted to give at least something because I know it is hard work that deserves compensation.  I do all this -- and our other contributors donate their time, energy, and talent as a labor of love -- because I believe in this project and its potential to provide a new voice to the community and to bring something important, interesting, and beautiful into people's lives. If all goes as planned, we'll relaunch the magazine this year and start getting the ad revenue to start compensating people properly, one of my main goals. Until that time, as we rebrand and work our way there, this is the best we can do: finding other people who believe.  I completely understand if it's not worth your professional time, personally, but I hope at least that you'll continue reading and keeping us honest and engaged with your valuable feedback as we work hard to improve and develop something that bears fruit. And if you'd ever like to be involved, or you know someone who might, get in touch with me and we can negotiate something, zapraszamy."
poland,39ayhb,ZiggyPox,3,Wed Jun 10 20:02:27 2015 UTC,"I don't critique your motifs as I'm sure you love what you do and that you sacrificed lot for it btu.. well.. you can't expect other people to share that love just because.  If I could propose something it would be to hang on for a while with making new logo. You WILL find someone willing to make new logo for 100 zlotys but it will be worth.. well.. 100 zlotys and that could do more harm than good, taking into account that you want to rebrand your whole magazine. It is much easier to rebrand it whole at once rather than piece by piece, with different quaility.  You need good brief, good research from the side of designer (for example, I don't know what this eagle in ""O"" means, stylized Polish eagle or krakowian eagle?). Every shortcommings of this would-be foozle design will haunt you in the future.  For now I would do something simple like change of colour scheme to mark a transition and build solid system of managment to make a foothold for new visage.  Mine two cents."

poland,39f45g,BarryOgg,0,Thu Jun 11 08:47:23 2015 UTC,"It's also a fair question, given the amount of homophobic music Poland generates."
poland,39f45g,ludamad,14,Mon Jun 15 03:31:08 2015 UTC,"How much is ""that much?""  As a gay person, I'd say it depends, really. Poland is probably still one of the most conservative countries in Europe when it comes to social issues (gay marriage, abortion, euthanasia, gender inequalities, state-church separation, xenophobia, etc.), but on the other hand in the last parliamentary elections 4 years ago two LGBT activists became MPs — Robert Biedroń, a gay man who's recently been elected mayor of Słupsk, and Anna Grodzka, a trans woman who also tried to run in last month's presidential elections (though she failed to gather 100 000 supporting signatures and was eventually rejected). And sure enough there were people who made hateful remarks against them (even in the media — it is still common to hear homophobic opinions on TV), but are they such a numerous group or just a really vocal one? It's tough to say.  When it comes to everyday life, I can only speak from my experience. I live in the capital so my situation probably is better than that of the rest of LGBT people in Poland. There are gay clubs here, pride parades (one's coming this Saturday), LGBT charities and helplines, and everything you'd expect from a major European city. However, it isn't all fun and games here either. I have been threatened a couple of times and once even beaten up for kissing my boyfriend in public (ironically, this was in a relatively safe and gay-friendly area with a huge installation of a rainbow). Because of such incidents, I think there is still plenty of work to do. And although I'm personally not afraid to be openly gay — what's a beating or two? ;) — I do know some LGBT people who are not that open and I don't really blame them. I feel especially sorry for LGBT teens who have to grow up in the still unwelcoming environment and listen to all those homophobic idiot politicians on mainstream TV (though they're usually invited to debate other non-homophobic politicians, so I guess that makes it more OK…?).  The two LGBT MPs were definitely a significant step forward and you could feel the fresh air of change back then, but now it seems that a new wave of conservatism is coming just in time for the next parliamentary elections. So it's two steps forward one step back, I guess.  And yeah, the single thing we Poles hate most is being called out on our vices. Just try suggesting that we're antisemites, homophobes, xenophobes, racists, sexists etc., and you're in for a tough ride! Funny how for most Poles being called one of these is worse than actually being one."

poland,3918m5,adster107,48,Mon Jun 8 14:45:16 2015 UTC,"Hey, it's nice to see someone actually thinks for himself. Not talking about witcher being racist or whatnot. Just a general thought.   So first and foremost, Witcher games are based upon this dark fantasy universe created by A. Sapkowski. I think his books were translated into english and if you're into low(ish)-magic, mix of heroic and dark fantasy genre, you'll love them.   Second: yes, the world is generally based on medieval, western europe, You know - ""The Slavic Zone"". We had no afro-americans here (we didn't even know about existence of Africa or America), or Chinese, or... You know where this is going.   I'm not sure if Witcher world is really closest to our 12th century, but general theme of Sapkowski's world is ""dark medieval times, with magic, and some advanced machinery here and there (dwarves have it of course)"".  As a Pole it's really funny to read all those western game-journalists being mad about ""lack of diversity of humans that inhabit the world"". You can say the same thing about Vikings' sagas, hell - I bet old african folklore doesn't include white people."
poland,3918m5,tentomasz,12,Mon Jun 8 15:06:17 2015 UTC,I agree. It seems a bit rich considering it feels like they're bossing developers (from different cultural backgrounds) around about how to portray their own culture when they really could be calling out problems that exist within their own gaming culture.
poland,3918m5,tentomasz,32,Mon Jun 8 15:16:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the point. I mean, we have a lot of classic writers. Some of them even won Nobel prize in literature. Their works also lack racial diversity. It gets even better. Our history is racist as fuck. Can you imagine, that all 60'000 people who fought in battle of Grunwald were WHITE AND MALE? And this twisted motherfucker Matejko, who decided to picture this racist event in 19th century didn't even try to make it look a little better by putting in some racial diversity there: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Matejko_Battle_of_Grunwald.jpg  On a more serious note: Witcher books are far from being racist. In fact, Sapkowski portrays racism as very stupid idea. And as a fantasy writer, he doesn't have to use different shades of humans, when he has all those elves, dwarves and post-conjunction races to work with."
poland,3918m5,tentomasz,4,Mon Jun 8 15:36:08 2015 UTC,You'd think the theme of racism would be even more obvious with elves and dwarfs being involved...
poland,3918m5,bereneko,9,Mon Jun 8 15:42:44 2015 UTC,"Racism exists in this world, and is kinda important part of the story. But books/games aren't racist. They just try to show you this whole racism idea close enough that you can see it's evil."
poland,3918m5,MrMysterious95,8,Mon Jun 8 15:47:28 2015 UTC,"Same with the sexism in the game. Just because it's present doesn't mean the game itself is approving of it.  It seems strange that some people don't like the idea of 'undesirable' elements being present in certain media. Like with Ciri, people don't like the fact that bad people within the world will throw remarks like 'bitch' or 'cunt' at her in cheap attempt to weaken her resolve. Because bad guys have to be civil and polite apparently."
poland,3918m5,Beck2012,2,Mon Jun 8 15:54:40 2015 UTC,"But the whole first game is about racial conflict...    edit: oh, after reread it seems that that was exactly what you meant :P My bad"
poland,3918m5,CyndNinja,8,Tue Jun 9 04:57:13 2015 UTC,"Can you imagine, that all 60'000 people who fought in battle of Grunwald were WHITE AND MALE?   No there weren't? There was a sizeable contingent of Tatars, and it's not unlikely that there were some Turkish squires and servants on Polish/Lithuanian side. While only men fought, women often tended to camps and maintained soldiers' equipment - it wasn't just 'a knight with a squire'."
poland,3918m5,Inquisitorsz,3,Mon Jun 8 18:21:17 2015 UTC,"Tatars are generally white, they're Turks, not Mongols (but they've probably mingled with Chalchas and Buryats, so some of them could have some mongoloid genes)."
poland,3918m5,Subclavian,2,Tue Jun 9 11:48:12 2015 UTC,Turks and Tatars don't look any less European than Italians or Greeks. Unless you you're American and go with this bullshit Hispanic/Caucasian distinction you can easily count them as white.
poland,3918m5,Vertitto,3,Sat Jun 13 23:30:42 2015 UTC,The funny thing is the story and world of the witcher actually deals with quite a lot of racism and hatred. The witchers are outcasts and shunned for being mutants and performing magic.   The lore and original story writing explores this topics at length.   EDIT: I forgot all the racism towards elves and dwarves too...  Just because there aren't any dark skinned people doesn't mean that racism is ignored.
poland,3918m5,Vertitto,9,Tue Jun 9 05:07:07 2015 UTC,"I think we knew of Asian people back then, Poland did fight the Mongolian Empire in the 12th century. This doesn't mean that they immigrated to us in large numbers, just that we knew about them."

poland,3918m5,Subclavian,22,Mon Jun 8 22:30:50 2015 UTC,"The claims that lacking any PoCs in Witcher is a proof of racism/insensibility is pretty absurd. Imagine someone claiming that Hua Mulan is racists because all the characters are Asian.  Poland is a very homogeneous country; you might occasionally see a person of colour in the major cities. In 12th century it would be completely unheard of. Not to mention that Witcher is based on an established and well-grounded fiction that also has a very homogeneous human population. Not something unheard of in fantasy - yet you never hear LotR being called racist*.  Also - thinking about the delicate matters of race by bundling every white person into a single 'white' sack is pretty US-centric. In Europe we do have quite a few different white ethnicities - with Poles in late history often getting the short end of the stick - not sure if depicting Polish society in how it looks (or even more so how it looked in the medieval times) can really be considered inconsiderate.  Even more so - to ""fix"" the ""issue"" we'd either have to completely break the existing lore, or just force one or two people of colour into that world. But last I've checked tokenism was bad. Not to mention that Witcher's world is pretty grim and its people are already portrayed as racist bigots (towards e.g. elves). Do people asking for more racial representation really want to see a few PoCs being oppressed by the majority? Or should we again break the lore and make everyone see sense and be good and thoughtful towards each other?  TL;DR - some people are claiming Witcher 3 should show some oppressed minorities. It does - they're called Poles.  * EDIT: this being the Internet, you probably do. But no sane person would claim LotR was racist - there :)"
poland,3918m5,Vertitto,6,Mon Jun 8 15:14:34 2015 UTC,"I've made the argument to someone that ""someone of African decent in Europe during the 12th century makes no sense"", he claimed that there were some present during this time period/shortly afterwards.   I've humoured him and I've looked all over looking for any possible evidence that this might be the case. I've found absolutely nothing supporting this, safe to say his claim is bullshit?    Also, for the record, it's a damn shame that certain sites keep forgetting that Poland and it's people have been oppressed in the past."

The funniest was when a male ""friend"" heavily implied I have no morals/I'm a slut because I was sleeping with my boyfriend of 2 years at the time. The boyfriend was sitting right next to me and we were all a group of friends who knew each other for a few years already. So that's how it goes sometimes, the skewed mentality is definitely there."

Life of a peasant in the final years of Poland-Lithuania (regardless of whether they were ""ethnic Polish"" or ""ethnic Ukrainian"" from today's perspective) was at best only marginally better than the life of a black slave in the Confederate States. Life of a peasant in pre-WW2 Poland 2.0 was not that great either.  It's kind of a suppressed memory in the life of today's Poles, but more than 90% of us are actually the descendants of former slaves. Yet, we somehow love to think that all of us descend from the gentry and that's pretty screwed up."

It wasn't exactly the slavery - the situation depended on exact kind of service serf was sworn into. After Partitions the serfdom was abolished first in Prussia, much later in Austria and Russia (1861), and finally in Congress Poland (1864).  During interbellum the peasants in ex-Prussian domains were in best situation, but generally speaking the situation was dire. The reforms were indeed largely ineffective, but frankly situation was not that terrible. Not good, but comparison with slavery is dishonest."

In Warsaw, where I live, you see some Asians, usually around bazaars and office buildings and a very occasional black here and there (as in I see one maby once every two months). I don't remember ever seeing any other non Europians, though admittedly I don't pay much attention to people on the street.  In the olden days it was similar - there were some asians and after a brief search I've found only a few mentions of black slaves being brought in by nobility as curiosities around 16th and 17th century. The Polish king Jan II Sobieski is said to have had one in his routine (there is a letter in which he informs his wife that the man was captured and killed by the Turks).  The Witcher is based on very old Slavic traditions and folklore (as in over a millenia old in some cases) so it should not be very surprising that there are no people of color in it. There are no blacks in the Viking sagas either.  What I find particularly ironic about the whole nonsense is that most of the people who claim to demand diversity and respect actually demand it's made to suit the American culture."

I'm assuming you're not that close to them, so I guess something 'symbolic' (alcohol, flowers etc.) would suffice.   Is there anything I shouldn't do? Whats a typical polish wedding like? :)   Um... hitting on bride would be pretty much only thing that's universally frowned upon :P. Again it depends what exactly the wedding will look like.

I can't imagine many people explicitly stating they don't want any gifts at the reception though, must have been very wealthy or something to host tens of people not expecting a thing in return.

I don't think it will be a catholic wedding since at least the groom is an atheist. I guess this makes it less traditional?

poland,38wqcq,Technolog,3,Sun Jun 14 19:10:35 2015 UTC,"Regarding gifts it's customary to give an envelope with money and flowers. Nowadays most couples don't want the flowers and sometimes ask guests for something else instead - a book, wine, etc. The amount of money should be enough to cover the cost, usually around 100-150 EUR per couple, half of that if you're single, more if you're very close friends."
poland,38wqcq,suddenstrangefancy,3,Sun Jun 7 17:27:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think westerners ever really are prepared for just how much food will be served. I fell into that trap during the first two Polish weddings I attended, and my relatives fell into the same trap during my own wedding here.   In my experience there will be a shitload of food (all of the weddings I was at had at least 5 courses), in addition to some buffet options on the table and on the side, a cake buffet, and in a few cases an additional separate buffet table with local country stuff.  Try to reign yourself in. Maybe sample one of everything, but there will be more coming, and you might miss out on something fantastic because you just had to gorge on that delicious whatever it was in the the first course.   You might want to find out if there is an afterparty you are expected to attend. It was traditional to just party on  for days until all the vodka is gone, which nowadays often means one more banquet on the next day with food and vodka from the previous day.   Around midnight there will be stupid games. Try to get close to someone who speaks the same language as you so you know at least whats happening. That's also the time the bride is going to throw the bouquet.   I don't know how usual it is in general outside of Poland, but I was always thrown by the late beginning of it all. Wedding ceremonies pretty often only start in the late afternoon/early evening and the receptions afterwards often lasts until the last few stragglers leave in the early hours of the morning.    Vodka in Poland is often drunk with something to get the taste out of your mouth. Either another drink (cola or other soda) or something small to eat (which is why you always have these plates of food on your table). In my experience this is not really necessary if the vodka is good (which is why I demanded a more expensive option for my own wedding), but I recommend it if you don't drink vodka very often. Also don't automatically expect other drinks. My Polish guests found it an alien concept that we even served beer on ours. Although there normally is at least wine around."
poland,38wqcq,skocznymroczny,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:50:09 2015 UTC,Wow! That's a very long answer. It explained a lot to me! Thank you so much! :)
poland,38wqcq,Draki1903,2,Tue Jun 9 05:41:58 2015 UTC,"Do not underestimate expected amount of foods that will be served. There will be REALLY A LOT of different food. It will start with chicken soup and second dish with a lot of meats to choose from. You will find some meat in a meat (rolada) that are delicious. Don't eat too much at this point, because they will serve number of next dishes and you may not be able to try them if you start eat a lot in the beginning and it will look delicioius. The last dish is usually served around midnight.   My advice: don't eat anything that day before wedding and if you want to taste a lot of food and cakes, the best way is to share each thing with your partner.   There will be some competitions. Get a little drunk and participate. There's nothing we love more than some people don't knowing exact rules are having fun.   Also be ready that some people will insist that you drink a glass of vodka with them and they won't accept denial. But if you feel you need a break, just go out and take your time. They will insist only when you're sitting next to the table.  It will be fun! I envy you a little :)  Edit: words."
poland,38wqcq,mkwlsk,2,Sun Jun 7 22:32:44 2015 UTC,"As for gifts, if I were you, I'd give them something traditionally Swedish (find out about local crafts shops). IMO that'd be really cute and safer than a gift of cash. I'd avoid giving money unless the newlyweds specifically asked for that.   I've been to several Polish weddings and must say they've changed over time. IMO they're more civilized, with fewer silly games and horrible music. Also there's more diversity when it comes to alcohol. Vodka will be a big theme but not as big as it used to. What hasn't changed is the amount of food. Make sure your clothes are loose enough ;)"
poland,38wqcq,CATHOLIC_EXTREMIST,2,Tue Jun 9 13:21:31 2015 UTC,"As for the wedding gifts, the traditional gifts are usually household appliances, a set of pottery, a new vacuum cleaner, stuff like that that the newweds can use at their new house. Although that's mostly bought by family of the groom and the bride. For friends, you can just buy a bottle of a good wine or just a nice bouquet of flowers.  Typical Polish wedding is lots of food, lots of cringe (music and ""activities"") and lots of alcohol."
poland,38wqcq,setyoursightsnorth,1 point,Wed Jun 10 09:03:22 2015 UTC,"Is it customary to bring wedding gifts?   It varies from place to place. Where I'm from the young couple usually asks the orchestra to play non-stop for x hours and everyone gives a token amount of money to dance with the groom/bride. You give what you can spare as they hope this money covers a big part of the wedding expense.   Is there anything I shouldn't do? Go with common sense. People will also be forgiving if you do something silly because of the ""Silly uninitiated foreigner"". Feel free to latch to anyone with language capacities to guide you through.  Whats a typical polish wedding like? If Swedish weddings are similar to Norwegian weddings, you will notice a distinct lack of national flags and best man/woman/etc. speeches. You will also be rather drunk, but that's an universal constant."

At this stage, you can just serve it with bred, butter, ketchup, horse reddish, mustard or...  You can put the sausage aside, crack and scramble in a couple of eggs into your mountain of lovely soft, well seasoned onions! only a couple, for added volume and flavour, not making an omelette! Serve immediately as a side for your sausage. :)   You can add variety by cooking whole mushroom tops with the eggs inside, instead :)"

Kiełasa is a great type of meat, because you can prepare it any way you want. Great method is to kut it into smaller chunks and fry in a pan with some onions.

It's a narrative pushed by conservative people. In Poland's history there was a lot of place for people of minorities. Also the ""Young Poland"" movement in the 1891-1918 wasn't really conservative, for example. Conservative upbringing does everything to say: ""If you don't do everything like we do, you don't have the right to call yourself a Pole"", hijacking the Polish identity, and making it one-dimensional. Yes, gay people have their agenda, but on the other hand didn't the Poles in partitioned Poland have an agenda?

In regards to studying, I did not study there so I know nothing about the enrolling process, quality or anything related but I signed up to the newsletter of the Mexican Embassy in Poland and twice a year they send me information about masters and PhD's for which the European Union or the Polish government provides some sort of scholarships, reduced tuition fees and sometimes they are even for free. Unfortunately I do not know if its a result of Mexico-Poland relationship or if its open to any nationality so I recommend you to send an email to the US embassy in Poland and inquire about it, also I strongly encourage you to ask in any FB expat group like the one in the link... I bet you can find someone in a similar situation who can give you more details. Finally, Poland is quite cheap when comparing to western European countries and the states so in that respect I think you will be fine if you combine it with some tutoring and some small money transfers from home.

Poland is quite good for studying slavic culture and language, I suppose. I have finished Russian Philology in Poland (Gdansk University) and I am satisfied with these studies as I have learned Russian language, history and culture very well. There are three slavic-studies in Gdansk - Russian Philology - which is focused more on the language, grammar and stuff like that; Russian Culture and History - name tells it all, and Slavic Studies - more about The Balkans with Serbian or Croatian languages. Unfortunately these are conducted in Polish/Russian, and I don't know if B2 knowledge of Polish would be sufficient for these. I doubt that... BUT, I heard that University of Poznan and University of Torun are known for good Russian Philology. You can try there.  If you have more questions related to Russian Philology, Russian or Polish languages, culture - feel free to ask ;).  (and yes, my Russian is better than my English ;))"
poland,37ztxt,maruch,8,Sun May 31 23:42:39 2015 UTC,"Lublin unemployment rate is around 8-9%. It's a little lower than Polish average (but yes, cities like Warszawa, Kraków, and especially Poznań have it much lower).  Still it's not a problem for a foreigner, because Lublin is an university city. It has 350 000 citizens, and over 100 000 university students each year. That means if you're native English speaker you can earn a living working part time in English schools - huge demand. Also there's IT boom recently, lots of companies opening offices there.  Universities vary in quality - Medical Academy is OK (a lot of foreigners study there - mostly from middle east, Ukraine, and Scandinavia, but also some from the western Europe and USA - its degree is accepted in USA so ).  Techincal University of Lublin (Politechnika Lubelska) is average in most respects, UMCS is slightly below average (except for law).  Catholic University of Lublin (KUL) is weird - it's good in biotechnology and related stuff, and average or sub-average in everything else AFAIK.  Personaly I've studied on UMCS and KUL, and UMCS seems better, but both are good enough if you are ready to learn.  Polish language courses organised by KUL are very good - I've heard a lot of positives about them, for example from David Snopek (American who speaks very good Polish, now he lives in Poland and has language learning blog - http://www.linguatrek.com/ ).  Big advantages of Lublin are - it's very cheap city, with lots of young people, nice architecture and history, and much slower, more relaxed atmosphere than Warszawa or Kraków."

poland,37ztxt,szyy,6,Mon Jun 1 09:17:45 2015 UTC,"(1) B2 is actually a level that should be enough for studies. At least when Europeans apply for Erasmus they must have B2 level of certain language to be accepted. As for Polish language courses, I know Silesian University offers them as well.   (2) Lublin isn't a rich city and it's filled with students so you may encounter difficulties finding a job as an English language tutor. Basically I think finding a job as an English language tutor might be hard in any place in Poland since there is so many people speaking it, and Polish people preferring British accents. If you have to work at least part-time, I'd recommend other cities in this price range such as Katowice, Poznań or Szczecin. I think you could find a job in a BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) center with which many Polish cities are filled with.   (3) There is no general rules when it comes to admission. You need to read carefully all the informations on your selected uni's website."

It is now in the National Museum in Gdańsk in Poland. It was commissioned by Angelo Tani, an agent of the Medici at Bruges, but was captured at sea by Paul Beneke, a privateer from Danzig. (A lengthy lawsuit against the Hanseatic League demanded its return to Italy.) It was placed in the Basilica of the Assumption but in the 20th century it was moved to its present location.  The central panel shows Jesus sitting in judgment on the world, while St Michael the Archangel is weighing souls and driving the damned towards Hell. (The sinner in St. Michael's right-hand scale pan is a donor portrait of Tommaso Portinari.) On the left hand panel, the saved are being guided into heaven by St Peter and angels. On the right-hand panel, the damned are being dragged to Hell.

poland,37q83d,intromatt,5,Fri May 29 16:20:14 2015 UTC,You've never heard of Uber?
poland,37q83d,JarasM,3,Fri May 29 18:50:06 2015 UTC,"It's not super advertised. I wouldn't hear about it if I weren't following reddit.  Also I agree with his discontent about the card number. You actually can't remove card information from an account without giving it some other credit card number. Since I don't use Uber (wrong city, hehe) I had to close my account altogether, since I don't like my card info laying around on random services for someone to steal when the servers get inevitably hacked at some point.  Also, a tip for closing the account - you can't do it automatically through the system, you have to file a support request for the admins to close it for you. Just in case anyone would like to close theirs too."
poland,37q83d,luomo_tigre,5,Fri May 29 19:34:44 2015 UTC,"just some clarification, UBER does not store your credit card data. so does most of the other online services.  to store this kind of data you need to go through ridiculous amount of certification (especially here in Europe) and PCI DSS compliance (payment cards industry data security standards). that is why no sane business does it on it's own, if it doesn't have to. there are third parties that provide this kind of services - it's called payment processing (as far as I know Uber is using Braintree).  so yeah, your credit card data is perfectly safe with UBER.  SOURCE: working in finn tech since few years now. online transactions nowadays are much more secure than giving your credit card to a waiter at a restaurant. just don't give your credit card data to shady businesses and Nigerian aristocracy and you will be just fine!"

As far as I'm concerned key part of Ukrainian ideology nowadays is being independent, sovereign state outside of Russian sphere of influence. Rest is secondary and might be subject of discussion between Poland and Ukraine after that issue is resolved - that includes both internal issues in Ukraine (corruption for example), as well as external (international relations, history and so on).   Most of ukrainians support UON-UPA and Pavel Bandera    Sure. And we 'support' entire generation of magnates ruling over Ukraine during PLC times. We also idolize entire collection of uprisings during Partitions, as well as resistance organizations during WW2. I might not like UON-UPA, (Stepan) Bandera and their methods. I recognize however why they might be seen in positive way by Ukrainians - mainly because what they fought for.   Your country survived horrific times, even from Soviet side.   Soviet? The 'horrific times' for Poland started after Great Northern War, and Russia (yes, Russia - not Soviet Union) was major factor there. As for recent history: it's funny how you celebrate winning the war you started in 1939 with such pride, isn't it?   hope that we (slavic nations) someday will become in very good relations   So do I, but Russia has a lot to answer for, and ask for forgiveness for, as well as forget about it's imperial past, before we can establish properly good relations."

Additionally the only people who have been openly racist to my girlfriend have been Hungarians and Romanians, I may be ignorant but I thought that these two countries may not be a million miles in similarity to Poland. Knowing that there aren't many Indians in Poland I thought I may as well ask the question because of reasons explained above. I hope you don't think any worse of me for it. Thank you so much for your answers. :)"

It doesn't matter who is at the helm because most of the time people doing it have no actual knowledge on the subjects they portray to represent.

poland,374k48,harumphhh,8,Sun May 24 21:07:18 2015 UTC,"I am unfamiliar with Polish politics, so pardon my ignorance, but it appears that the Polish president doesn't really wield much power.    Well, not really:   The President has the right to initiate the legislative process. He also has the opportunity to directly influence it by using his veto to stop a bill; however, his veto can be overruled by a three-fifths majority vote in the presence of at least half of the statutory number of members of the Sejm (230). Before signing a bill into law, the President can also ask the Constitutional Tribunal to verify its compliance with the Constitution, which in practice bears a decisive influence on the legislative process.  In his role as supreme representative of the Polish state, the President has power to ratify and revoke international agreements, nominates and recalls ambassadors, and formally accepts the accreditations of representatives of other states. The President also makes decisions on award of highest academic titles, as well as state distinctions and orders. In addition, he has the right of clemency, viz. he can dismiss final court verdicts (in practice, the President consults such decisions with the Minister of Justice).  The President is also the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces; he appoints the Chief of the General Staff and the commanders of all of the service branches; in wartime he nominates the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and can order a general mobilization. The President performs his duties with the help of the following offices: the Chancellery of the President, the Office of National Security, and the Body of Advisors to the President.   He can't do that much on his own but his powers (veto) are an important part of Polish check and balances system so to speak and thus he can greatly influence the cabinet in its policies."

Just ask any question unrelated directly to ruling the country and our leader will answer like a primitive, or a guy from mental facility. These opinions are so important, that it's anything that goes to mainstream media. Oh, and there isn't party without our great leader. If any member is against him as the leader, he has to go away.  Partia Palikota - /Not sure how it is named now./ We have very important issues to solve in this rotting country. Like: THC permission (by smoking joints), making administration non-religious (by removing crosses from rooms), LGBT (by waving dildos around). Oh, there are economical problems, right. But we're way too populists to take care of it, because it's too mainstream and our business plan didn't think we can get some voters by suggesting any important economical change.  Ruch Narodowy - We weren't a political party for some time, just an organization of organizations, until Korwin and ""right sector"" started to get more voters in polls. We don't have yet the single view for anything. But who cares, we won't get to the government anyway, because we don't have enough money for posters and commercials. Besides, we're just another PiS, right? Bóg, Honor, Ojczyzna! TM (God, Honor, Fatherland!).  Locked content - Partia Balcerowicza - The old political gods want to gain power again! Join in their adventure of getting to the parliament soon. Since it's the DLC, they already have voters without presenting anything.  Locked content - Partia Kukiza - This addon is yet under development in conceptual phase. Keep on tuned, cause it will rock!  PS:  In the first turn I voted against POPISPSLSLD, so the vote went for Kukiz, as he had the greatest score in polls from the other parties, cause at least he could give a representative concerts. Also, he's the wind of change indicator in polls, so the better score he got, the bigger shitstorm will come. In the second turn I voted against Komorowski, as he is a poor president, non-representative and looks like an ordinary man. He made too many errors to be let on this position. This resulted in my vote going for Duda, instead of simply drawing a phallus or writing something ""smart"".  I'm an atheist supporting the tradition of our beautiful ""pagan"" history, believes and holidays, which were celebrated in joy, not too serious, without mourning. Thus, my views might be in conflict of some ""right-sector"" political parties. We, the Polish, should know where we came from and who we were/are. Korwin's radical economical ideas are too ""brave"" for introduction and they allow greed and nasty creatures to persist without penalty (non-regulated capitalism may end up as corporation enslavement system, where work and money are way too ahead of your honor and family). However, Korwin would be my second choice, if not Kukiz. I don't support JOW (single-member district system), cause it hurts political minorities. To be kept in mind, political role of the president is ALMOST only representative. His veto could be bypassed by parliament voting, if the majority will want it. I hope 20% of votes for Kukiz and now Duda elected will do something good, instead of lowering prices on stock market, lowering the value of PLN and mainly fearsome populist's articles in the international press/media."

I'm leaning libertarian-ish, so both candidates were bad for me. Out of those two, Duda is an accomplished lawyer who doesn't have problems with spelling. Of course, I was also sick to death of the arrogance presented by both the current government and their media brownnosers. But yeah, it was mostly to see people like you bottom-bothered. So far, it's working wonderfully."
poland,374k48,skocznymroczny,2,Mon May 25 00:41:29 2015 UTC,"I ignored voting as both candidates were so similar and not fitting my liberal views I couldn't be bothered to waste free time. But I'll try to toss few why:   less educated people from small cities, countryside have way worse prospects and also tend to believe in miracles rather than hard work. So obviously they don't care about facts and data and slow evolution. They want fast change for the better of course. While naive it's kinda obvious why they've picked Duda. PO got way to sloppy at ruling while being too smug after 2nd win to even notice it. This annoyed helluva their main electorate so middle class 30-40. They still voted for Komorowski but they weren't as motivated as needed. PO picked wrong candidate for election. While Komorowski was obvious choice it wasn't good rival for Duda or Kukiz, much younger and power hungry guys. Result was being perceived as old weird uncle rather someone you respect. PiS learned their lesson and invested in their own media as well as using negative image to show Komorowski as old school and not cool(just like it was done with Lech Kaczyński). Hiding Jarosław Kaczyński was a brilliant move too. PO ignored young electorate. They and ""their"" media killed Palikot. As result Korwin(and later Kukiz) gathered youth attention and formed them into far-right electorate. Add what was said above and what was clear win for PO/Komorowski wasn't this time. Lastly Komorowski wasn't perceived as president of all folks, he remained loyal to PO and signed bills he shouldn't(as in to be perceived otherwise).   In short fear mongering Kaczyński and PiS didn't work this time. People tend to forget bad times and focus on what's now rather living in the past."

It's statistic  But hey it's just my interpretation of the results based on stats and personal anecdotal evidence. Not saying those people are dumb(if that's what you think) - they do know how well they fare and how good their prospects for the future are.

poland,374k48,destiriser,-2,Mon May 25 11:47:44 2015 UTC,"Statistically they will be more resistant due to more ease with analyzing data, facts and observing longer trends, which come with better education.   Sociology and psychology is actually very useful for analyzing politics, no idea why you think it's useless for that. They do teach statistics and logic there too, you don't learn math only at university of technology. It will also make you better educated than someone after high school or elementary.  Media aren't one sided now tbh, PO has some, PiS has some too, not to mention paid people on social media - twitter, facebook, wykop and more - reaching younger electorate that isn't focused on old fashioned media."

Still, I think calling either of them 'religious inclined' isa a slight misuse of the word. They don't support the church per se, they are just fucking spineless opportuninsts who will try to sweet talk everyone if it can give them a few more %. SLD had an almost 50% representation in 2001-2005 parliament, and they did a whole lot of nothing (about the usual Left taking points, I mean - marriage equality, reproductive rights, etc.). They however managed to start a few affair that successfully destroyed 80% of their support. I guess probably a few of their barons got rich as well. Oh, and it was Miller who signed us up for the secret CIA torture? bases. So much for their priorities.  Then in 2011, Palikot proved himself to be as ineffective and opportunistic. Changing his mind on ACTA overnight, only after protest in every major city. Still did NOTHING on their stated goals of marriage equality and depenalization of cannabis. But hey, they managed to file 5899 amendments for the 2013 budget. A quick reminder: church fund is less then 0.3% of the budget.

I checked electors webpages, there's really only a little information about what they really want to do and how they want in to do. no, it's not about saying in TV that wages will be twice bigger in 5 years, this is an advertisement and that's a thing to ignore. lack of respect to a person. it's like in a McDonalds where you just say 'I want burger' and they give you burger but you know shit about how it was made, from what, by whom, you don't know anything and don't want to know. if that's people's altitude towards the country and politics then I understand why this thread contains so little of information."

A staple of facebook political argument is tripping a right-winger into saying something like ""I support every government that lowers taxes"" only to inform him that the income tax was brought down by SLD (so much for ""lewica"", since they completely removed the highest bracket).  SLD is also the one who dismantled tenant's laws and struck down rent control. This is the reason I like to laugh at the face of everyone telling me that SLD are lefties. They are directly fucking responsible for the disastrous effects of reprivatisation in Polish cities, thing which so many activists fight against (and the one who started it all, Jolanta Brzeska, was found burned in the forest in mysterious circumstances - something which police investigation very quickly labeled as suicide). Also, their presidential candidate this year was basically Korwin in a dress (or, rather, halka :P)  Palikot's movement was never left-wing, they were social-liberal which is considered pretty much a centrist view in most European democracies. True, they had few left-wing people like Grodzka, but they mostly moved away when the ship started sinking. Along with the idea of left-wing views in Poland it seems.   I'm actually wondering if Palikot really killed the left here. I very well remember climate back in PiS era and there was quite a lot of left-leaning people out there - satirical sites like and comics like spieprzajdziadu.com and chomiks were popping out, there was huge left swing on JoeMonster, popular humour website, there outrages over stuff like Beniamin (censoring program made for schools, chosen by then minister of education, Roman Giertych, which after investigation by some software websites was found to be extremely ineffective in blocking porn, allowing a lot of words like cipa and extremely effective at blocking informative LGBT sites like kph.org or homiki), discussions on forums regarding social issues like abortion or LGBT rights were pretty much evenly split, incidents on pride marches (if they ever happened, speaking of which - there was a huge cheering over ECHR decision that Kaczynski's gay pride ban in 2005 was violation of European Convention on Human Rights) were minimal, no giant Independence Marches. What I'm wondering is whether was it really like that and our society just went right-wing (which I can't really check thanks to Eurostat changing fucking questions all the time) or was that simply the case of less Internet penetration and lack of facebook.  As for Racja, I have huge hopes for them - their PR seems to work great so far and they don't seem to be so superstitious around topics like GMO and atomic energy like Greens are. I really hope that the corpse of PO will go with the idea of siding Balcerowicz, because what otherwise would slow painful ride to death of the party will be like boarding fucking Pendolino.

We got history subject and thats where teaching about religion takes place and its obviously okay with me."
poland,374k48,Amerizilian,1 point,Sun May 24 23:46:26 2015 UTC,"no.. there's no theology on history lessons. I mean, seriously, if you think so, give example.  I've been on religion and the teacher thought as about not only Christianity, but also others, I clearly remember a lesson about Buddhism, so it's definitely not solely that, but yeah, they teach mostly about the relevant one to the culture. I've never heard about 'one true religion' brainwashing being taught there. that's mostly reading the bible and interpreting. like I said it isn't very professional. often there's just nothing being done on these lessons and the subject is taken very depreciatingly, but that's just an area for improvement. better build than destroy. studies should be more in depth and while teaching about all the religions would be quite an impossible thing to achieve, teaching about the most popular sounds perfect. something more like university theology and not 6yo theology. also such things like learning prayers by heart, demanding recollections attendance or teaching by people not fitting the role are just a lack of respect to the subject, I don't know who made it all this way, but clearly nobody cares, not even - just get it out of my view!!! not them - for them it only matters that it's taught.  edit: oh, and if you go to a Polish school and see how other lessons are carried out, it won't be so different than the others anymore. it's educational system that needs a change, not its parts being added, removed, renamed and so on.   there's no positive income of removing a lesson. no importance of it at the very last. the whole idea of it has nothing to do with education, it's a culture thing that should be kept out of it.  there's also nothing wrong that I'd see with knowing more about what you hate or embrace, that is knowledge.  you said that these lessons generally raise kids to be bad adults, but what I've seen is kids terrorizing the teacher on these lessons, not other way around and actually the teacher was acting just like in the bible - strained the other cheek which is something I still have in my memory, taught me something, it could be said. this isn't uncommon. so is it really the lesson being the cause of something else?"

If you are so eager to include Religion in schools, then why not give the students the freedom to have Atheism taught as well? This is 2015. Freedom means not having something shoved down your throat.     what I've seen is kids terrorizing the teacher on these lessons, not other way around and actually the teacher was acting just like in the bible - strained the other cheek which is something I still have in my memory, taught me something, it could be said.   So even with religion being ""taught"" the kids are still acting up. hmmmm. Kinda seems like maybe they don't want to learn about religion.

Yes, because those events actually happened in real life and they influence what is happening today. If you pay attention in history class you might notice that all throughout history there have been numerous atrocities committed in the name of religion. People massacred, enslaved, conquered, and forced to convert against their will. Those are verifiable, proven facts. And the cause of all that suffering was because of unproven, unfounded claims written hundreds of years after the fact, about a person why may or may not have even existed. History, Science, and Mathematics are useful subjects because they can be proven and are useful in the real world. They are not just fairy tales or metaphors like the bible.

This a course from Catholics to Catholics. Back in my day, kids were literally forced to pray in the beginning and end of the lesson (a Catholic prayer, dictated by the teacher) and were memorising verious prayers. Whole second grade was basically preparation for First Communion. And I doubt it changed much (although, I've heard they moved the Communion to third grade). You could get this course omitted even by giving note from your parents that you don't want to due to your religious beliefs (which was actually in reverse to the law which brought this course to schools - your parents have to state that you'll be attending those lessons). And last but not least - in parts of Poland where there is significant religious minority, like Orthodox, you can attend an alternative lessons for Orthodox. Why would that be?"

poland,375gen,nazgobius,1 point,Fri May 29 05:19:09 2015 UTC,"It's not THAT bad, Beijing is much worse ;) It hits when its cold and people heat their places with outdated heaters, use trash or low quality coal. Running or cycling in winter is terrible. I've lived in Krakow and love it but Poznan is indeed a very nice place. Not as good for traveling, Krakow has much better airport. If you're after air quality, perhaps 3city(Gdansk, Sopot, Gdynia)?"
poland,375gen,well-rounded-comrade,5,Fri May 29 08:47:48 2015 UTC,"OP, I am polish and I've been lurking here for quite a while. My opinion is this sub is completely ridiculous and you should take everything you read with a grain of salt. Something you should know is that people here are (on average) 1) very locally patriotic 2) most have never been to the US 3) they love to complain and badmouth everything.   The result of this is they would have you believe every town (apart from the one they live in if they feel generous) is a godforsaken, crime ridden backwater, where racism is rampant and you are going to be violently murdered if you don't blend in with the locals. The truth is, pretty much every place in the whole Europe is on average much safer than any big city in the US...so this really shoud not be your concern.  Also, even though quite objectively the quality of life has literally never been better in the short lifespans of those people, they will try to convince you everyone should just jump ship (especially after yesteday's elections...) and coming here voluntarily is pure craziness.  My point is: things are looking up. Both Kraków and Poznań are really nice. From these two I only lived in Kraków. The pollution problem is there; almost 150 days per year when μg/m3 levels exceed WHO standards, compared to 88 days per year in Poznań. However, Kraków is the only city in Poland actively doing something about it. Take a look here - http://www.numbeo.com/pollution/rankings.jsp As you can see it could have been better, but also it's not like the air pollution level in Kraków is something unheard of in the US - it's comparable to Phoenix, Atlanta or Los Angeles. I don't know whether this makes it sound good or bad, but here it is.  Edit: I forgot to add 4) very liberal leaning. Which is obviously not a bad thing in itself, but combined with 1), 2) and 3) can sometimes result in misinformed opinions (i. e ""every place is better than Poland"")."
poland,375gen,kurczakPL,3,Tue May 26 01:23:00 2015 UTC,"glad someone points this out. I live in Holland and I would really like to live in Poland after my study. When asking for advice I always get comments calling me metally insane because I would like to live there. c'mon people it's not like it's not like everybody is struggling to live another day. People have cars, homes, clothing and are able to buy luxury items. Yes it's less than in Western Europe, but not as bad as some try to make it out to be."
poland,375gen,mariller,2,Tue May 26 16:45:37 2015 UTC,I agree - almost every post I've found about the matter just urges people to stay away. It's nice to have people give thoughtful answers!
poland,375gen,InsaneForeignPerson,1 point,Tue May 26 17:25:36 2015 UTC,"That list you posted is an aggregate of all types of pollution - so trash, dirty water, noise/light, etc. There is a side-by-side comparison on that site, so I checked Kraków and Poznań against the city where we're living now, our hometown, and some other US cities, and Kraków is very high on air but pretty low on all the rest. I've also read about how they're trying to fix it, which is awesome! It sounded like the money for getting people to convert their home heating has run out, but I hope the government is able to come up with more. Clean air is important for long-time residents."
poland,375gen,mariller,3,Tue May 26 17:29:35 2015 UTC,"Another 2 cents, because you asked about comparison.  Pozań is also nice, it has less green and not so ""old town-river-bridges"" atmosphere.

For a weekend You can go to Sobótka and climb Ślęża. Holidays You can spend near the south border of Poland: in Karkonosze National Park or Table Mountains National Park.  In Wrocław there are people playing board games. I've heard about Gratislavia (it's a word play: gra + vratislavia). There are also some other meetings organized by university students, but I don't know if they are open for non-students."

poland,375gen,Rpizza,1 point,Tue May 26 17:33:26 2015 UTC,"I moved here from the Netherlands for work and adventure.  I must say that life is a little different here. I like the more kind of ""in-your-face"" life that you witness here as someone coming from a country of which many people say it is better off in general than Poland. I like it here because you can kind of see that the country is developing, there is a lot happening here, always. You can see new and hip little companies, stores and cafe's pop up everywhere, so a lot of innovation going on here. Also the university and the multinational companies are pretty big here, so there is always a nice mix of working polish and foreign people and students from all over the world.   The mix of people and the rate of ""new stuff"" that is happening here makes for very nice combination.   There is no shortage of stuff to do here (except sometimes in the middle of the winter maybe). From 1st second of good weather the festivals, concerts and cool markets just pop up everywhere.   Also I have heard that Wroclaw is one of the most liberal cities in Poland, compared to other cities the right-wing patriotic (and unfortunately sometimes racist and homophobic) the atmosphere here is quite good.   Also the proximity to cities like Berlin, Dresden and Prague make it a pretty nice home-base :)"
poland,375gen,pejczi,2,Tue May 26 21:16:23 2015 UTC,I wanted to recommend Wrocław too and i'm not even from Wrocław.
poland,375gen,pejczi,2,Mon May 25 17:15:04 2015 UTC,"Have You considered other cities at all? Or do You just want it to be at least a 500k+ city?  What You could also consider is Wrocław and Gdańsk, which are very beautiful and developing pretty fast. Another option would be checking out some smaller cities, like Bydgoszcz (that might also be fun to make Your friends pronounce) or Szczecin (just as fun). You should consider checking these out, but maybe just add them to the list of places You have to visit once You're already living here :)  You can check out Bydgoszcz in a gallery I run for my fanpage (all photos submitted by readers): https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.289099984603905.1073741837.217811428399428&type=3  PS: Out of these two I would definitely choose Poznań - At least it's not extremely overrun by tourists, while it's not any less interesting at all."
poland,375gen,pejczi,2,Fri May 29 10:11:07 2015 UTC,My heart is with krakow but the pollution is bad.  Poznan is beautiful.  Also maybe a place in the mountains. I was from the bialystok area and visit ot often. Its pretty.

poland,373do5,nieuchwytnyuchwyt,6,Sun May 24 14:30:58 2015 UTC,"Lidl is alright too. Some products are a little bit more expensive there than in Biedronka, though you might also find some cheaper ones - it depends - and I percieve the overall quality of products there as a bit better than in Biedronka."
poland,373do5,Globbi,3,Sun May 24 14:38:54 2015 UTC,"I actually don't see much difference between the ""cheap"" supermarkets (Lidl, Biedronka) and bigger ones (Carrefour, Tesco, maybe something else). You've got to see what products you like and where can you buy them cheaply. Usually for just buying some veggies it's best to just use the closest big shop.  Obviously what you buy is much more important. You'll need to buy lots of rice, potatoes, carrots instead of asparagus and fancy brands of pasta and apples, bananas instead of mangoes and melons."
poland,373do5,przyjaciel,2,Sun May 24 17:32:12 2015 UTC,"You can enjoy asparagus, but prices of produce in Poland vary seasonally much more since than in some other countries.  Asparagus is prohibitevely expensive and not very good out of season because of the distance it has to travel, costing as much as 20 PLN for a single bunch. In season you will pay less than 5 PLN for the same.  The same goes for other fruits and vegetables. Look forward to and enjoy seasonal produce!"
poland,373do5,bonecrusher1,2,Sun May 24 23:15:22 2015 UTC,check their websites for best offers and go to the one which suits you more
poland,373do5,ImplicitTurtle,7,Sun May 24 14:38:20 2015 UTC,"1) Loyalty cards - you can find all the information on the Internet, or just ask in the supermarket. As for coupons - we don't have many of those going around, sadly.    2) Supermakets - as people mentioned, Biedronka is the best. Lidl is also ok, although in my experience I pay more money there for similar products. But special offers are a thing, so you should keep an eye for them and make your rounds, if you have the time. If not, Biedronkas are there for you.    3) Food - really depends on where you're going to live exactly, but in general chain restaurants will be your best bet. Still, you are going to spend at least 20 - 25PLN for a meal in those. If you want cheaper food, kebabs and similar places can feed you for less. If you really want to minimize spending on food though, buying ingredients and cooking for yourself is your best choice.    4) Drinks - depending on the location you can expect a beer to cost you anything from 5 to 10PLN - and we are talking about the same brand, just different bars. It is generally cheaper to just buy a beer in a shop - then, unless you go for something fancy, no matter where you're buying it shouldn't cost more than 5PLN. Side note: if you buy a beer in a shop and just want to drink it somewhere outside with friends, you should know that drinking on the street (except places like outside tables belonging to a restaurant) and in parks is illegal in Poland and you can get a ticket for that. However, even if you are not on the street or in a park (for example, you are sitting on a beach on Wisła's bank) and police come, thay may want to ticket you for drinking in a public place anyway - you can argue with them, since it wouldn't be illegal to do that, or just keep your eyes open and hide your bevarage if needed, your choice ;)    6) Earning money on the side - if you speak ANY foreign language on a decent level, you can give private lessons, native speakers naturally have it easier. You can post your offer or search for pupils on gumtree. Just keep in mind, that summer vacation lasts from the end of june to the beginning of september, so there won't be much demand for tutors in July and August. I would say that for a native speaker giving lessons in Warsaw, the rate would oscillate around 50PLN for 60 minutes.   7)City transportation - make sure you buy 30-day or 90-day ones, 1st zone only (2nd zone is for suburbs, if your accommodation is in Warsaw it is unlikely you will need it). It's best to apply for a personal city card to code them on - you will find all the info here. With this card you will pay 110PLN for 30-day and 280PLN for 90-day tickets without student discounts, entitling you to unlimited journeys on all types of city transportation. Since you will probably use public transportation all the time it will save you a lot of money.   800 PLN is enough to survive without problems in Warsaw, and you should easily have some leftovers for something else than bare necessities. Good luck on your internship!  EDIT: added tickets and formatting"

poland,373do5,pejczi,2,Sun May 24 16:59:06 2015 UTC,"There are some kebabs where you can have the kebab for 5-6 zl, which is not that much. Try buying stuff in shops like Lidl, biedronka - you can also look for things in shops like Żabka or Fresh Market, because they often have special offers, for example 4 for 1 , or buy some amount to save x%.  Where to drink beer? Well, there are many pubs which offer a beer for 5 zl / 0.5L . Generally young people drink beer on beach near Wisła and Poniatowski bridge. You can buy some beers in the shop and drink beer there."

Instead we have to do a little homework. Who made the film? Who's in it? Are they capable people who have done good work before? What do the reviewers say? Even that fails us sometimes, but at least we have some ways of filtering trusted from untrusted sources.

Vast majority of fantasy readers have read the Witcher books and recommend it to others.  Definitely a lot of people have seen the movie (it's been broadcast on biggest channels thought the years), but it is bad and there was never big interest in it. (Not a good movie on its own, even worse for the Witcher fans since it was a huge letdown).  Vast majority of gamers that haven't even read a book in their life have played at least some of the games. Even the first part was a huge news in Poland when it first came out and the company itself had had good reputation long before (in translating and distributing games).  And now, EVERYONE has heard about the Witcher with international success of The Witcher 3 game. It's one of the biggest global successes of Polish origin, also catches well in the media. It has been mentioned in all news programs in TV and radio. There were TV commercials. There are/were ads for night release sales. There are posters in good locations in big cities.  The books actually still sell well (or again). Readers that are not really fans of fantasy try it out more often.  I've seen unopened collector's edition of the first game sold for about $800+ recently. Not many old games reach such status..."

poland,3707n5,Spleenfarmer,14,Sat May 23 17:23:34 2015 UTC,"Your mom is partially correct. There's no straightforward way for a Pole to move to the states without a definable reason recognized by the US authorities. Examples include marriage to a US citizen, being recruited by a US company for a special skill (requiring a relevant university degree/s or 15 years experience minimum), fantastic artistic skill or a place in an educational program.   If a Pole just wants to up and move to the US he or she needs to apply for a diversity visa which is essentially a lottery. The US allocates a certain number of these visas to each country and how difficult it is to get one depends on how many other people from your country apply for one. Poles apply for a lot of them, so it is competitive, but not impossible. It really is like entering the lottery.  The first stage for applying for this visa is not terribly difficult, and the complicated stuff is only required if you ""win"" a slot. The complicated stuff is worth doing if you win a slot and you are eligible for the diversity visa program. What is NOT worth it is winning a slot for a diversity visa, getting all the paperwork together and being turned down at the last minute because you applied for this visa even though you have an ineligibility (i.e. overstayed a previous visa). The US clearly lists who is eligible and who is not online. There is no point in trying if you are ineligible. You won't ""get away with it.""  Poles ARE refused (mostly tourist or short term) visas much more than people from other European countries and the US State department will not specify why that is. The refusal rate is currently too high for Poland to enter the tourist visa waiver program. Personally, I suspect it has to do with the illegal immigration of Poles in previous decades. As an example from my own experience, my Polish friend was turned down for a visa because her family is in the States illegally and the State Department was afraid she would try to stay with her family. They told her that explicitly, it sucks for her, and I'm not sure they were wrong (my friend admits as much)."
poland,3707n5,battlinlobster,1 point,Sat May 23 18:04:59 2015 UTC,"The refusal rate is currently too high for Poland to enter the tourist visa waiver program.    Right, that's what we always hear from US Gov't people: that the condition for visa waiver for Poland is that the refusal rate must drop below some set level. What''s hilarious (in a way) is that what determines the refusal rate is mainly the US Government's policy."
poland,3707n5,drbobb,1 point,Tue May 26 13:37:33 2015 UTC,"That's absolutely true, though not the whole picture. For whatever reason there seem to be a small group of Poles that continually apply for the same visas over and over again after being rejected for ineligibility.  These individuals seem to be the people OP's mom refers to when she discusses ""stories of expensive applications and people getting turned down year after year with undertones of corruption and bias."" There is no point in applying year after year if, for example, you have a 10 year ban for overstaying a previous visa.   I know that in Poland being persistent with institutions can pay off. Often when Pani at the Urzad says no, she has no idea what she's talking about or doesn't have the authority to say no and asking again at a different desk will get you a different answer. The kombinowanie tactics that many Poles honed over the years are unfortunately, exactly the wrong way to deal with the State Department after being denied a visa. It's generally better to hire a lawyer to address the reason for the denial and appeal than to apply again."
poland,3707n5,battlinlobster,1 point,Tue May 26 14:15:52 2015 UTC,"Having re-read that, I want to clarify that I do not think it is the fault of the Polish that the US hasn't changed their policy. Obama has stated that he wants Poland in the visa waiver program, and if that's the case then the US needs to find a solution.  I don't know what the solution is, perhaps discounting the individuals that apply over and over from the refusal rate for the purposes of joining the waiver program? I'm interested in any better ideas if anyone has them."

poland,3707n5,pejczi,3,Sat May 23 17:49:22 2015 UTC,"Just recently I was helping a good friend of mine with submitting a visa application for two weeks trip to the USA to see his sister and her family.  From my point of view, the entire procedure is stupid and humiliating - not only for Poles but for any other nation that is required to have visa to get to the USA.   Stupid. Some questions in those forms (DS-160, to be exact) left me speachless, some other made me laugh. E.g. something like ""Were you or are you going to be involved in people smuggling/drug trafficking/arms dealing/etc. Well, I am a lawful citizen and the last thing that I can think of is that I'd smuggle some Vietnamese, Thai or Germans in my suitcase. For any criminal they're also extremely stupid: ""Yeah, i'll just confess that I was involved in building nukes for DPRK because you asked me if I did."" Humiliating: I do not want to be asked about my education, friends, and entire family just because I want to see the Great Canyon. For God's sake, I do not want to be ten-printed as a bloody criminal just because I'm trying to get permission to get to the USA. I was shocked when I noticed that I have to put my own personal data just because I was helping my friend with the form.   About expenses: The US government makes people to pay $160-$205 of non-refundable fee just to get to the interview at the Consulate. It doesn't mean you'll get a visa. In my friend's case, he was told by the consul that he ""didn't convince him enough"" to get the visa. And he was just one of many people that day, who were told exactly the same. Just so you know, how much money the $160 is in Poland: it's about one quarter of an average monthly salary. In many cases it's one third or nearly a half. If you're retired, it's about your entire pension.  I thought I'll put some TL;DR here, but I won't. Instead of it, I'd like you to see what kind of questions are in the DS-160, and how the US visa procedure looks like:  DS-160 questionnaire. Scroll through the video: Around 6:50 the best part of ""security background"" begins. I know it's not Monty Python, but I was laughing my ass off while reading those questions.  Applying for American visa. You can read this entire webpage to feel like any random U.S. visa applicant."

I was only able to spend 2 days in the city and, with my luck, it rained and snowed the entire 2nd day.  After visiting cities such as Gdansk, Torun, Poznan, and Wroclaw I think that a lot of tourists are missing out by typically only visiting Krakow and Warsaw. Of course, those two cities are beautiful and unique in their own way but it's the smaller cities in Poland that really caused me to fall in love with the country."
poland,36u8tk,wroclad,3,Fri May 22 04:10:55 2015 UTC,I have visited Wrocław 12 times in the last 3 years and also fell in love with the city. So much so I am relocating to Poland permanently this summer.

I also dream of living in Poland(I'm a half-Polish student, born and raised in Holland) but i get constant negative feedback from almost everybody because the salaries are awfull. Some people act like I will probably die within a month. I know that I will not earn as much as I could in Holland, but will it would it really be so hard for someone with a university degree and fluency in Dutch and fairly good english to build up a modest life? I still dream of living in Krakow after my study, but i am realy realy worried when it comes to money. Do you have any tips or do you know whether my fears are justified or not.

The rest is a gamble, but if I don't try I could regret it.  Of course people have voiced their concerns and a lot of people in Holland view Poland quite negatively, but screw those guys, it's my life and a cut in salary is a small price to pay for an adventure.

People associate it mostly with communism and think that it is just a country with grey flats ' like the rest of the eastern block'.

That includes all the taxes that they put on people in the past years (increase of VAT to 23% being the major one). Sorry for short answer, but I'm quite tired discussing this topic at this point. My family thinks that I'm crazy for voting for Duda, because of the threat that he (along with PIS) will turn Poland into second Vatican.

Meanwhile PO just puts on more taxes and borrows more and more money to fund their failed idea of economic strategy. They suck funds from local business and at the same time bend over to foreign companies to come and pay low salaries to Poles. We are turning into one big outsourcing center of Europe.

Meanwhile PO was elected right before the financial and economical crisis so their stats are worse but if you compare it to other countries, Poland is indeed a green island. Germany, which are a role model of economy right now are now 6% richer than they were in 2007 while Poland is 23% richer."

In exception that Duda said that, he would like to punish people that had in vitro fertilization by 2 years of jail time. Both of them have no opinion of their own, they do what their party will say them to do.   The main difference is that PO are bastards that got a little bit to comfy in their chairs, and PiS are bastards that would do anything to be in their chairs.   The last time PiS was at the helm it was a disaster tough. They organised ""witch hunts"", they targeted a lot of people in more or less made up corruption charges, blowing a lot of money on mostly failed bribe attempts. (think American Hustle movie, but with more vodka and less attractive cast). They also successfully fucked up everything they got their hands on in the EU, and other foreign affairs because their FA minister was a complete tool.   With PO it's like the saying goes ""shitty but stable"", at least they built a metric fuck tone of motorways.   So if you don't live in Poland and/or don't plan to, please don't vote, let us, the ones who will have to endure 5 years of the next president here in the country, pick our poison."

However, although I don't necessarily like either candidate, I would vote Komorowski. There are a number of reasons why. Three reasons as an example are PiS policies:   the criminalisation of in vitro fertilisation. I don't expect the government to fund in vitro but the criminalisation of it is absurd. Sending women who are sick to jail for two years for trying to have a child is ridiculous and introduces new costs to the government European Council Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence - Komorowski ratified and PiS was against ratification. Some reasons for being against it were the idea that it would interfere with the ""chivalrous culture"" in Poland. I really don't understand that logic.  Returning to the system where children start school at age 7. I think going to school early takes advantage of a child's sponge-like mind at that point and ability to learn. Further it lessens the burden on families who need to either stay home to care for the child or pay  for care.    Due to these three reasons, I cannot support PiS."

poland,36env0,Rafcio,1 point,Tue May 19 11:02:52 2015 UTC,"Steak tartare:       Steak tartare is a meat dish made from finely chopped or minced raw beef.   It is often served with onions, capers and seasonings (the latter typically incorporating fresh ground pepper and Worcestershire sauce), sometimes with a raw egg yolk, and often on rye bread. The name tartare is sometimes generalized to other raw meat or fish dishes.  Although less common than the completely raw variety, there is a version served in France of steak tartare called tartare aller-retour. It is a mound of mostly raw steak tartare that is lightly seared on one side of the patty.    Image i     Interesting: Yukhoe | Çiğ köfte | Crudos   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

I imagine that it's even more awesome these days, but you should expect one thing - massive queues to everything, toilets, shops, traffic jam on your way to the place and when leaving.

poland,36d6zd,harumphhh,7,Mon May 18 17:19:10 2015 UTC,"Every bar is a hetero bar.   The point of gay bars isn't to be a bar exclusively for gays, they are just places that cater to specific clientele. Biker bars in the US, for instance, aren't exclusive to bikers but they operate in ways to make bikers comfortable by playing the music they like, serving the drinks they like, and using decor that they like and as a result a lot of bikers like those bars. By ""biker bar"" I mean something like this: http://ibikeinsurance.com/pictures/harley-davidson/biker-bar.jpg  So imagine a ""gay bar"" as a biker bar, except with drinks that gays might like, music they might like (this is all very general by the way), and a general atmosphere that they find comfortable.   A ""gay bar"" shout be about as controversial as a ""chess bar"", a ""sports bar"", or a ""wine bar""."
poland,36d6zd,StrangeletPL,0,Mon May 18 17:57:32 2015 UTC,"Wait, wait, wait. Are you trying to tell me that gay and hetero music preference is defined by their sexuality? Also taste? Biker bar, chess bar etc are bars connected to people hobbies. Sexuality isn't like hobby. You can't choose your sexuality. Or am I wrong? Gay person can be converted to hetero person, and hetero person can be converted to gay person? And if every bar is hetero bar, so every bar is gay bar."
poland,36d6zd,I_Plunder_Booty,2,Tue May 19 19:01:15 2015 UTC,"And if every bar is hetero bar, so every bar is gay bar.   You're totally right that sexuality is not something you choose, but in this context it just comes down to atmosphere more than anything. In many/most bars, being openly gay might bring trouble or just a bad reaction from people. Gay bars are just bars where being openly gay is totally fine by design.  At some point in the future, you will find that yeah, most every bar will be a hetero bar and a gay bar in the sense that nobody will really care what people's sexuality is in the bar for the most part. Gay bars will probably still exist as an efficient means for gays to date and flirt since they are a small percentage of the population but they won't last long if they exclusively cater to that niche since its just bad business.   As far as taste and music preference is concerned, sexuality isn't what defines it so much as the particular culture of the community with that sexuality. Even there though, there are many different facets of the same group of people so preferences aren't universal.   It all just reflects the times we live in. If you think about it, ""hetero bars"" weren't a thing for a while since many drinking establishments were for men only.  As society changed with time to accept the notion of men AND women can socialize and drink at bars together, the concept of this sort of bar/tavern became pretty commonplace though even that waxed and waned depending on the social climate.  As society is changing now, more people are aware of the genetics behind being gay and they are increasingly less bothered or whatever by the presence of gay people in bars. I would bet that by the time the 20-30 year old people of today are old most gay people will simply go to whatever bar they feel like and socialize with straight and gay people alike.   Until then though, gay bars will still be around and some will certainly be more... intense than others haha. For the most part though, you might be pretty disappointed in how normal they seem. People drinking, some music playing, laughing here and there, really pretty plain stuff."

Poland is one of the few white countries left where the culture is pretty homogenous. You can tell because there's no pride parades flaunting degeneracy to the public, no race riots in formerly thriving communities that are now poverty stricken ghettos where whites can't walk down the street without being shot, and no sharia law zones where non Muslims get harrassed.   Poland is one of the safest countries in Europe because it's one of the whitest, most catholic, traditional countries in Europe. Want to spread your liberal reddit bullshit? Go do it somewhere else, Poland is part of the EU, you have free travel throughout all of Europe. I'd suggest the rainbow colored Islamic nation of Sweden if you're looking for multicultural utopia, just be careful you don't get stabbed by a gang of Somali.   Don't like my opinion? It's the opinion that upwards of 90% of Polish people share. Hell even college students aren't brainwashed to belive the liberal propaganda there like they are in the states and the rest of Europe.

Why does no one attempt to diversify black, latino, arab, or asian nations. It's like they don't fucking exist. Bro Pakistan needs more gays. Japan needs more blacks. Send some Arabs to Hong Kong. Why don;t you start it, go bring your gay white friends to Nigeria, they are in dire need of some multiculturalism. For god's sake, they are all the same color and sexuality, this must be a super ultra code red! More gay white faces are needed asap. How can you let a racially pure country of homophobes like that exist?   Why is it your people's life mission to throw shit on the white countries, but ignore every other country. White people aren't bad. Being white is not a disease that needs to be eradicated. Take a long hard look at yourself and for a moment think instead of parroting the narrative you learned in universities. Why are you only pushing liberal ideals onto white nations? Is it your inherent racism? Or because the propaganda you've swallowed tells you to."

That's pretty xenophobic, and quite the superiority complex you have for yourself. And I quote ""one big untermetch Slav block ghetto"" that's racist as fuck. If you replace Slav with kike or coon all of a sudden it's not ok is it? Guess what? It was never ok, you self hating liberally brainwashed racist race traitor.  You move to a country, and instead acclimating to it, you bitch on reddit and try to change it with your own fucked up ideals that no sane polish person wants. You're not trying to appropriate the culture, you're trying to eradicate it. Not every country is the USA, stop trying to turn the rest of the world into it. This is why people hate Americans. It's like you're so angry that Poland is a Catholic country, where is your outrage at all the exclusively Muslim Nations in the world. Are they ok for reasons that don't make sense to someone who isn't a liberal in their early 20s?

Also, in Poland it's very popular to look for climbing partners in the internet, with fb group ""Umawianie na wspinanie"" is probably one of the biggest, also climbing forums like wspinanie.pl or brytan.com.pl have sections for looking for a partner. Krakow has huge climbing community - they have their fb group, and couple of walls in city itself or around, these places are always crowded so there should be no problem with finding someone. If you have any questions about climbing in Poland, let me know."

I'm Polish, and I can tell you - there are almost no games that were dubbed in Polish with high quality of dubbing - everytime it's just terrible. Relish the chance to learn more English and immerse yourself in the original, high quality voice acting. You are having trouble with a lot of text in English? It's exactly because you spend your time playing games and watching movies that were, mostly poorly, translated into Polish. Those games and movies will help you to have a better grip on the English language and it will be a huge asset for you - even on reddit.  Bessides from my point, almost all games you buy ""boxed"" versions of in shops and shopping malls are usually translated. On Polish auctions (like allegro) you can buy many PL versions of games. Also, if you use steam - you can install different languages and many games are available in Polish. You can even reinstall a game in a different language."

Unless you want to enjoy nature - then mazury is your best bet and it is not that far (great for kayaks/yachts).

Sorry I'm on my phone so can't link but check out these: Dni Sztuki Współczesnej - end of May/early June festival of contemporary art, outdoor and indoor theatre; the website is in Polish but they have their page on facebook and there's some content in English there. If you'll be driving and are interested in folk art and architecture, also nature, Podlasie is a beautiful region. Granted, not in your face spectacular as some other areas but still gorgeous. Tykocin, Suprasl, Kiermusy - just a few towns/villages around Bialystok that are definitely worth the time. Białowieża is a bit further but also a great place - national park, a very old and quaint town with some nice places to eat. Bialystok itself has a few parks, the city centre has dozens of pubs, cafes and restaurants. Bialystok has a lot to offer, it really depends what you're into? I grew up there and although I have moved away about 10 years ago I still go back at least twice a year and every time I find something new to do and see. I really hope you like it there :-)"

In all honestly and despite I really like Bialystok, it is a bit boring, the people sometimes can be rude and sometimes is difficult to find who speaks English (sometimes not even young people), but just try to make the best out of it and well make some friends quick :P also start preparing you liver cuz you will be drinking a lot of vodka"

Odds are you'll spend most of your time on Lipowa Street which is a pedestrian street with lots of bars and restaurants. I'd use that as your starting point and branch out from there. Also for a great meal at a super low price check out one of the many milk bars where they serve traditional polish food at low prices. I think they are subsidized.

Polish cuisine has evolved over the centuries to become very eclectic due to Poland's history. Polish cuisine shares many similarities with other Slavic countries, especially Czech, Slovak, Belarusian, Ukrainian and Russian cuisines.  It has also been widely influenced by Central European cuisines, namely German, Austrian and Hungarian cuisines   as well as Jewish,  French, Turkish and Italian culinary traditions.  It is rich in meat, especially pork, chicken and beef (depending on the region), winter vegetables (cabbage in the dish bigos), and herbs.  It is also characteristic in its use of various kinds of noodles the most notable of which are kluski as well as cereals such as kasha (from the Polish word kasza).  Generally speaking, Polish cuisine is hearty and uses a lot of cream and eggs. The traditional dishes are often demanding in preparation. Many Poles allow themselves a generous amount of time to serve and enjoy their festive meals, especially Christmas eve dinner (Wigilia) or Easter breakfast which could take a number of days to prepare in their entirety.

poland,35tnmj,ajuc,3,Sun May 31 06:36:50 2015 UTC,"I know this may not be my place.. But this post is kind of sticking an emotional chord with me. You say that your daughter is adopted from Polska? If she has any memories [I'm sure she does as she can speak rudimentary polish as you say?] And speaks some of the language you should put her into polish school to reeducate her about her language and her culture.  I was born in Poland and lived there until I was almost 6. Now that my mother raised my sister and I exclusively in the states after that with the exception of several 6 month occasions in middle and high school, both my sister and I are losing the language and the culture. Its rather depressing considering Polish was my first language, and I really didn't know the country I would spend most of my childhood and teenage years in existed prior to actually migrating there.    But nevermind that, it was more of a nostalgia trip for me however please consider what I said! (: I know she may not want it now, but she's she's older trust me she will regret not trying to keep connected with her polish roots!   Anyways, on the topic of kid friendly foods I would say breaded filets(kotlety mielony), pierogi(kids usually like sweeter), kolaczki (jelly filled cookies), nalesniki(blueberry-cream filled thin pancakes), and little slices of kielbasa with cheese(any cheese will do) for a snack.  As for soups zurek, bialy borsc, and czerwony borsc   (Sour soup, white borscht, and red borscht respectively) were my favorite soups growing up and are very kid friendly. Very yummy!  Also bonus item! Kompot is an awesome drink my babcia would always make me as a child (no not the alcoholic version) -my favorite was peach-mango kompot! Theres a ton of recipes online for this.  If you have any other questions please feel free to PM me! (:  Edit: words"

poland,35tnmj,jerzyszczur,1 point,Thu May 14 12:07:41 2015 UTC,"breaded filets(kotlety mielony)   Breaded fillet is kotlet schabowy (or schabowy in short) - a pork cutlet: first pounded, then covered in flour, eggs and breadcrumbs, then fried. Kotlety mielone (or karminadle) are meatballs.   zurek, bialy borsc, and czerwony borsc   It should be spelled as barszcz.   Kompot is an awesome    I love it too! :) Well, except the Christmas one - made from dried plums."

poland,35tnmj,kurwodrom,1 point,Wed May 13 18:04:22 2015 UTC,"I loved budyń sprinkled with cherry juice. It's called custard in English I think (the one without eggs).  Also pierogi filled with strawberries or blueberries, or cherries.  In summer we often made pasta with roughly cut strawberries mixed with cream (in my family it was served with hot pasta, and cooled cream and strawberries).  Another summer food - rhabharbar with sugar. You cut the trunk, remove the skin, get a small cup of sugar, then put part of the trunk into sugar so it sticks, eat that part, repeat. Tastes great, it's very sours and sweet at the same time. Of course it's not food you eat till you're full. http://fabrykasmaku.blox.pl/resource/rabarbar_z_cukrem2.jpg"

Sorry about polish websites but I'm low on time (at work;)) http://bistro24.pl/gotowanie/przepisy/tradycyjna-zupa-pomidorowa-z-makaronem,117571.html http://www.mojegotowanie.pl/przepisy/zupy/zupa_buraczkowa3 (you can add some cream to it). Those should suit 95% of kids. The other things have lower chances of succes, however I'd suggest schabowy or chicken cutlet with potatos or simple pasta with tomato sauce :)  Good luck!"

The strong witbier is a bit too strong for me (I prefer low alcohol volume), and the crazy beers are, well, a bit crazy (worth a shot if you're in the mood, though).  But the rest are simply great. I love their flavor. I love their design. I hope they stick around."
poland,35tw5h,thri77seek3r,10,Wed May 13 13:54:39 2015 UTC,"It is illegal to posses and especially distribute any dose of THC (or product having THC). I think being stoned is legal though. Typical 40+ sees it as any other addictive drug and perceives person asking as a junkie. In my neighborhood younger people usually are tolerant toward it and I think there are many guys discretely smoking it. Personally I would ask students drinking beer near university dormitories, if I'd dare."
poland,35tw5h,FrozMind,4,Wed May 13 14:19:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks,  for such a beautiful country it is a shame laws are so strict... I have been here 2 days and have discovered many beautiful smoke spots...."
poland,35tw5h,illmaticmat,3,Wed May 13 14:35:03 2015 UTC,Law may be strict but a lot of people smoke weed. A lot.
poland,35tw5h,hockiklocki,6,Wed May 13 16:25:44 2015 UTC,"it's illegal. so the guys that sell it are involved in some level of criminal activity. Unless you know someone-who knows someone whose got it, it would be really unwise to try and get it on your own. I guess you should try and make friends with some people at a bar or club, and if you start to trust them than you might discuss. But approaching people on the street seems rather crazy to me. Hook up with some decent party people first, than after you drink few beers or spend some time together you may discuss it.   I'm not from Legnica, so there is nothing I can tell you about that city in particular, but be warned that there is jail sentence for possession of even small amount from 5 to 18 months. So even if you do it, it is often the case the stuff is ordered and consumed the same night, to avoid the risk.    The general approach varies, as everywhere I guess the friendliest approach is among the young people. Guys like 35+ don't even mention it. There is also a lot of junk skunk on the streets. The chemistry of some of those mixtures remains an eternal enigma. I would strongly discourage you from making business with football fans. If the guy is a football ultras, he's stuff can have all sorts of shit in it. Also strip-clubs are not a good place for making this kind of deals. Any business that may be somehow linked to mafia activities is in general a no-go for guys with no connections. Never give money in advance, never trust anyone too much, especially very friendly women."

poland,35tw5h,mandanara,3,Wed May 13 14:14:32 2015 UTC,Also said penalties:  Possession up to 3 years jail  high quantities 6 months to 8 years  low quantities fine and/or limitation of liberty or jail up to 1 year. (prosecutor can drop the charges but don't count on that)  Other  Giving away for free or to coax up to 3 years  above but to a minor 6 months to 8 years  selling 1 year to 10 years  to a minor not less than 3 years
poland,35tw5h,subject_usrname_here,-3,Wed May 13 14:16:31 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info....  Seems like Poland is going backwards with the trees laws... in Australia even though it is illegal for possession of small amounts under 28g is a $220 fine and no conviction. Equivalent to a speeding fine.  May have a few drinks at a pub and check out the situation.
