ARK,3e3s4v,Stevetho,2,Tue Jul 21 19:02:26 2015 UTC,Lol. Do we even know what's causing this kind of floating bugs. I can replicate it by spear fishing in the river and dragging the fish out of water.
ARK,3e34cf,Cragvis,6,Tue Jul 21 16:20:58 2015 UTC,"Probably going to keep happening until you're able to build stone.  Thatch is ridiculously easy to break down; anyone can do it by hand in a couple minutes.  Unfortunately, seems a lot of people on official PvP servers kill on sight and many will wreck your bed/creates/etc just to spite you.  Best you can do is try to find a hidden area, unless you're willing to move servers.  I'd recommend a lower population unofficial PvP server, but you might want to try a PvE server as well."

ARK,3e34cf,gilnim,4,Wed Jul 22 02:43:15 2015 UTC,"Don't make Thatch Huts.  Build a wood hut in the jungle,  do not chop down the trees around it,  harvest elsewhere.  The idea is to keep the hut hidden, but small enough to not warrant spending time to break in if it's found."
ARK,3e34cf,shawric,2,Tue Jul 21 17:09:22 2015 UTC,"yea, had that idea the last time I died, went to a dense forrest, and harvested a little bit aways so my hut was still concealed. it was only thatch though. still logged in dead anyway.  maybe i need to go deeeeeeeeeeeeeep into the jungle somewhere."
ARK,3e34cf,RepostResearch,3,Tue Jul 21 17:45:07 2015 UTC,"The issue is primarily your thatch buildings, and secondly your location. We actually live on the beach. But we are 5 strong, and have a full stone base + stone walls + Stone bird house + ~40 dinos. Haven't been raided once (Unofficial PVP)."
ARK,3e34cf,shaggy1265,2,Tue Jul 21 19:04:57 2015 UTC,Just make a base with walls.   Put the walls far enough away from your house that any dinos outside the wall will be too far away to aggro while you are standing in your house. That way dinos will never even get close enough to know you are in there.  I was killed pretty much the exact same way you were. I was logged off and a friend was playing. He watched as a Sarco (big crocodile looking dino) destroyed a wall in our thatch hut and killed me inside.  We built a wall around it and haven't had the problem since. Stayed logged off for a week at a time without issue.  As long as you don't build anything too elaborate looking you shouldn't have issues with players raiding you.
ARK,3e34cf,A_Ninja_Dinosaur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:06:26 2015 UTC,You need to build in wood. They can only be hurt by metal weapons and take a while to do so . most people will just leave it be and not waste the time to do it unless they have a dino and really want you gone you shouldnt be messed with too much. Buildings also ruin spawns for the area by 65 yards nodes wont respawn so you might be building on cruical land for someone and they see you as in the way
ARK,3e34cf,DuhDaLee,4,Wed Jul 22 03:15:54 2015 UTC,"I play on official 300 and rarely experience this. I usually only play on weekends, it's been about 4 days from my last log on, and I always wake up right where I left.  I think location is key. My small stone house must just seem to useless to raid."
ARK,3e34cf,deityofchaos,2,Tue Jul 21 16:27:19 2015 UTC,"Hmm i only have a 1 square thatch house, door and all. and when i log in the very next day im dead, and respawning on the beach. says im killed by a sarpor or something. is that a dino or a player?   ive done this at least 5 times so far, its making the game feel dumb, a waste of time to even bother playing if I am going to literally lose everything but my level every day."
ARK,3e34cf,00z28,4,Tue Jul 21 16:33:29 2015 UTC,"I've found that the game is a bit glitchy as to where your body actually resides when you log out.  It seems that anything smaller than a 2x2 where you log out exactly in the middle will cause you to either glitch outside the wall, or at least have enough of you hanging out of your hut to be grabbed by a player or dino.  Wood seems to be the lowest level tech that will at least protect you when you fall through the foundation.  Granted all of this is from personal observations and may be completely wrong."
ARK,3e34cf,deityofchaos,3,Tue Jul 21 17:44:19 2015 UTC,I actually died the other day from a raptor that had spawned inside the house or glitched it's way inside. My tribe saw the notification of me dying...ran back and heard the raptor but couldn't find it. It was inside the building.
ARK,3e34cf,00z28,3,Tue Jul 21 17:56:00 2015 UTC,That's hilariously screwed up.  I thought foundations prevented the spawning of new resources and dinos nearby.
ARK,3e34cf,tomt00001,3,Tue Jul 21 17:59:26 2015 UTC,They are supposed to so I figure it glitched and allowed a spawn or it managed to glitch it's way through the wooden walls. I actually laughed about it too.
ARK,3e34cf,DigiSmackd,2,Tue Jul 21 18:07:57 2015 UTC,My group has had Rex's do that thru a stone wall and flooring.  We found you got prevent them from getting close enough to glitch thru.  Using walls or spikes to prevent them from coming closer.  With rexs and brontos(wild) you can stop them via spike (wood or metal) on the ground than 2 pillars high directly behind and a spike again on top of pillars.  Seems like their hitboxes (totally screwed up on most dinos) get stuck on the wall.
ARK,3e34cf,TheRealFJ,3,Tue Jul 21 20:38:58 2015 UTC,"I'd guess it's part hide from other players and part hide from aggressive dinos.  If you build in a remote location far from players but home to a Rex, then you're still going to be lunch.  This is speculation on my part because I only play on a PvE unofficial server.  The idea of dealing with the very thing you are complaining about (PvP destroys) is enough that it doesn't sound remotely enjoyable to me, so  I avoid that."
ARK,3e34cf,RepostResearch,2,Tue Jul 21 16:56:42 2015 UTC,"Thatch protects you from nothing but the rain. Wild dinos will eat through thatch and players see it as a ~5 second loot grab. Making thatch huts is a giant waste. Instead, stop worrying about building. Run around and level. Die a lot. Meet tribes. Eventually you'll either be high enough level to subsist or you'll be invited to join a larger, more protected tribe."
ARK,3e34cf,RepostResearch,2,Tue Jul 21 17:48:37 2015 UTC,"Skip thatch completely. I only use it for fencing in my tames to protect against ants and such, or using them as scaffolding/blueprints to design my buildings. You can break into thatch with a few swings of your axe. Stone is ideal, as it can't be destroyed by hand tools, but wood is better than nothing. If you really want to get a base going on your first day, you're gonna need to set aside a few hours for grinding materials. Ideally, just run around and have fun. Get into fights. Try to tame some low level dinos (Dilos and such) to get a feel for the mechanics, and get yourself a body guard. Once you've leveled up a bit, then focus on building (Once you've unlocked materials that can withstand an attack). If you manage to build yourself a 2x2 stone hut, most raiders will see it as more costly to get in, than the materials they'll probably get from you in the raid. So they'll just pass you by.  The absolute best solution is to join a tribe. Many hands make light work."
ARK,3e34cf,RepostResearch,2,Tue Jul 21 19:00:35 2015 UTC,how do you tame anything? i get attacked by dinos and have no time other than to spear them.
ARK,3e34cf,RepostResearch,2,Tue Jul 21 20:07:59 2015 UTC,"I tend to stick to the beach when I'm taming, so I can see ants and other dinos approaching. It's also helpful to have some Dino body guards. I usually start a character by taming a few dilos. They're super quick to tame, and pretty helpful in protecting you/your tame."
ARK,3e34cf,raven00x,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:25:28 2015 UTC,how do you tame though.
ARK,3e34cf,SlothOfDoom,2,Tue Jul 21 20:28:22 2015 UTC,"Oh you knock the animal out (either by punching them, or making tranq arrows at a higher level). Once their unconcuous, you feed them their preferred food, and use narco berries to keep them asleep until the tame bar fills. If they run out of food, you'll lose your tame progress, so make sure to keep them fed."
ARK,3e34cf,SlothOfDoom,2,Tue Jul 21 20:51:27 2015 UTC,"wow, complex, i like it, so far everything about this game is my dream game, i love the complexity and interactivity to it all. Just wish you could terraform and have random generated levels but oh well. lol"
ARK,3e34cf,Mr_Nice_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:19:35 2015 UTC,"Can't have everything. And you'll soon realize that taming really isn't that complex, and you'll likely start cursing it like the rest of us. Some of the bigger tames (For instance a lvl 100 Spino), can take upwards of 10 hours to tame on an official server. Taming a dino requires constant attention to keep it fed/sedated, and to keep it protected from anything trying to eat it.  We've switched to an increased tame/xp/gather speed server, because we don't really care for the grind."
ARK,3e34cf,Deranged40,2,Tue Jul 21 21:23:04 2015 UTC,"10 hours to tame that? so that means someone has to be there, feeding it and keeping it asleep for 10 straight real life hours? holy crap."
ARK,3e34cf,Willuz,2,Tue Jul 21 21:30:34 2015 UTC,"Thatch is a temporary house at best.  If you're logging o out for the night you really want to be in wood or stone, out just expect that you'll die and beer prepared to start from where you left off.  Thatch is very weak and large dinosaurs can destroy it just by wandering, to say nothing of large carnivores knocking out the roof to have human kibble.  Additionally thatch is the most vulnerable to basic tools, so a bored attacker with a hatchet and 5 minutes can get in and help themselves to your stuff.  Tl;Dr: if you're only in thatch, expect bad times.  Pick up the pieces and advance to better protected housing."
ARK,3e34cf,BigBizzle151,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:04:18 2015 UTC,"Sarpo? Probably a Sarco  (Sarcosuchus),  the large crocodile that hangs out near water.    They are long and seem to be able to clip thier snouts through walls easily.  Build somewhere a bit more elevated, away from water.  If you can, build against a cliff then log out right beside the terrain so things cant clip through walls at you."

ARK,3e34cf,Im_probably_naked,3,Tue Jul 21 20:08:41 2015 UTC,They are huge but tend to blend well with river samd when under water making them quite hard to see from shore.   If you keep logging out in the same place and dying to one it probably lives nearby.     They tend to last a while because most players won't bother killing them and they have few natural predators.   Tgey also tend not to wander far.  Be safe and relocate.

This means that with my 12 scorpions I should have a 11% chance of one of the scorpions laying an egg each 2 minutes. 1-(99/100)12 = 11% (correct me if I'm wrong lol) I feel like there's different parameters playing a part in whether or not the scorpions lay eggs as my luck is seeming to be really really bad. I've tried it with wild scorpios too by trapping them in a dino pen but they keep dying/disappearing, I'm guessing starvation or something.  Anyone know more about this?"

We live at the bottom of a mountain so we are close to metal/crystal but do not disturb the spawn rate of either. We also have a large bird cage built so when you get flyers you can park them there and they don't fly off. We'd also be glad to give you some decent armor and weapons/tools.   We have a structured tribe that allows new people access to the common dinos, we can usually give you or loan you a raptor and we are always willing to help you tame whatever you need/want such as a sabertooth or eventually a T-Rex. We usually find the dinos and piss them off then train them to our workshop area so that we can tame with a fridge for prime meat and we have access to water/food for ourselves. Once you're a trusted member of the tribe you can ride anything you want, including the rexes or the spinos etc. You can message me on here or send me a message on steam at the same name if you'd like to join.

Some people like playing this way and if the server admin allows it, then you have a few choices. You can either start doing it yourselves or move to a server that does not allow it.

ARK,3dyfz0,brumkid100,7,Mon Jul 20 15:40:48 2015 UTC,"Passive is shit, they will sand there and let them selves be eaten by a dilo.  Neutral is better since they will fight back if something attacks them, other dinos or your structures.  Ive seen some people use agressive but i find that can make it go wrong, since they will go ape shit and try to pick fights with anything that isnt you, your dinos or your tribe mates. It is kind of funny seeing a Parasaur crave blood and attack a pack of trikes though."
ARK,3dyfz0,Orapac4142,3,Mon Jul 20 15:59:52 2015 UTC,"Yea, aggressive is not the answer. A friend and I were exploring and came across a base that had a very flawed design and somehow ended up in its compound. Next thing we know, we're getting attacked by the tribe's carno because it was on aggressive. It followed us out and we had to kill it, otherwise it would have killed us."
ARK,3dyfz0,Thumpasaur,2,Mon Jul 20 16:56:25 2015 UTC,Well then the carno did its job lol... leaving it inside a base while aggresive is like having a security guard its awesome

ARK,3dyfz0,Thumpasaur,5,Mon Jul 20 20:42:27 2015 UTC,I set one(or more) dino to passive as an anchor. I set the other dinos to attack your target and have them follow that dino. Usually I have groups that stick together anyway so works well this way.
ARK,3dyfz0,Kahlas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:04:32 2015 UTC,How do you make them follow another dino o_O

ARK,3dyfz0,Phooenixx,3,Tue Jul 21 21:09:33 2015 UTC,"Leaving them on passive is a double-edged blade. Sure, it'll make sure they don't move, but at the same time, they won't defend themselves when attacked and inevitably die.   A safe bet is fencing off your base. For the flying dinos, I make a bird cage; they seem to fly around, even on passive.   Another option is putting a dilo inside one of your buildings and set all the other dinos to follow him and set as neutral. This way they'll defend themselves, but will return to the base when the battle is done"
ARK,3dyfz0,Thumpasaur,2,Mon Jul 20 15:59:35 2015 UTC,"I wand a ""Guard"" command.  They're basically Neutral, but with an anchor point of your choosing. When they fight, and the fight ends, they'll head back to the anchor point to continue protecting it."

ARK,3dyfz0,Thumpasaur,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:13:47 2015 UTC,"How do you set the dinos to follow a Dilo? I've been able to set them to follow a dino I'm mounted on, but not with a non-ridable dino."
ARK,3dyfz0,Daemonten,2,Mon Jul 20 16:15:49 2015 UTC,"Ah right; good call! Well, you could put one of your weaker ridable dinos within a small fenced off area - kind of like a small box. This way this dino is protected as well as you can use this as the anchor point for the other dinos."

ARK,3dyfz0,ptq,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:21:56 2015 UTC,"I set mine all to neutral in a large fenced area (works for me but may or may not be the best idea) but I just wanted to comment on the leaving the food in the dinos part.  When you have a lot of tamed dinos, feeding the carnivores can become a really big chore. My friends and I used to go hunt for meat and add a stack of raw meat in the dinos before logging off for the night but it just became really time consuming. We then realized that that was unnecessary. Most of the raw meat left in the dino get spoiled rather than eaten by it. So nowadays we don't leave stacks of meat anymore in the dinos. We just feed them every other day or so when their food levels drop. and just enough to fill their food levels again (not leaving any meat stack in the dinos at all). And then store any leftover meat in a preserving bin/fridge. A lot less of a chore that way."
ARK,3dyfz0,Weirdlu,3,Mon Jul 20 19:56:33 2015 UTC,But then all that spoiled meat is ready to be made into narcs when I log in xD
ARK,3dyfz0,riiji,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:55:01 2015 UTC,"true, but it's the hunting for meat part that's tedious. We have 1-2 of pretty much all rideable dinos (except for a pleisosaur and a bronto that died) and it's a lot of work to grab stacks of meat for each carnivore. Anyway, easiest way to get spoiled meat is to break the stack of the meat into individual stacks in your inventory. All will spoil at the same time!"
ARK,3dyfz0,Weirdlu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:33:58 2015 UTC,"I'm a solo player slowly working my way up levels and a part of my daily routine is to scout my area with my raptor and during that time I kill whatever herbivores I find. This ends up giving me enough meat, but I don't have add many dinos as say a tribe would. Thanks, but I knew about the meat stack trick. I just like logging in with a large already spoiled pile of like 60 rather than wait for it in-game :)"

ARK,3dyfz0,xisumavon,3,Tue Jul 21 08:24:30 2015 UTC,you underestimate the power of the dilo. 20 dilos would easily take out 3 rex's and take a fraction of the time to tame

An if you have a base set up you should be fine from dinos too, unless you built it in an area where Trex's hang out.  Ive logged out with low water and food and woke up and it was right there, Ive logged in with a Carnos patrolling around near my house, and it was all good, well except for the carno who i sicked a pack of dillos on in hilarious fashion."

We got lucky with those two tames.   Thanks for the quick answer!"
ARK,3dyf33,RuncibleSpoon18,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:27:58 2015 UTC,I like to leave my dinos of neutral instead of passive so they will defend  themselves if they are attacked instead of standing still and dying

ARK,3dyf33,illegaljokes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:59:00 2015 UTC,"I feel bad for the Dodos, being forced to be outside and the first line of defense while the raptors stay inside lol.  As far as I am able to tell, you are completely safe from just dieing while offline, unless 1) another player kills you, but since its private you are safe from that, 2) A big dino breaks in and eats you but you should also be safe from that  unless you build int he middle of T-Rex central, and 3) (which I have not tested yet) if someone drags you under water and leaves you there."
ARK,3dyf33,tx_sunset,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:12:06 2015 UTC,There bad ass dodo's though! every level I pump either Melee or Health. They can 1 shot other dodo's! We dont have a ramp to put them inside so until then they are outside Dodo's.   We are in Trike Central right now. Right under the Blue Obelisk by the Water fall. There is always 4-5 trikes by the base at all times so a Rex or Carno that comes by will probably get wrecked.

They have done some memory improvements to the server that it does not require as much RAM now. The big thing is how many people do you plan on hosting? If it is less than say 10 concurrent players, you should be fine with about 8 GB RAM. If it is more, you better have a nice processor and plenty of memory. A lot also depends on if you will be playing the game on the same box as the server or are you going to be running a dedicated server box? If you will be playing on the same box, cut all your specs in half. Because half will be running the game and half will be running the server."

ARK,3e0fmh,tx_sunset,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:01:46 2015 UTC,"I would think that should do fine for a dedicated. Though if there is going to be high activity (lots of people always logged on, fights, raids, mass dino armies, large bases with lots of structures, etc) you may want to think about 32gb ram.

ARK,3dy74y,UnknownSoldier19K,4,Mon Jul 20 14:34:03 2015 UTC,"You're probably not going to see that ever. The difficulty in coding a procedural world in UE4 on the scale we have in Ark makes it highly unlikely it will ever be implemented. However there are people who have made custom maps already. That being said I don't think the game as yet can handle a map truly large enough that after 2 weeks of playing you can't have explored 90% of the surface. The other thing you're looking at for procedural gen is a logical order to the construction and placement of resources. Right now everything is a bit balanced by the fact that if you only have one base, you are not going to have easy access to every resource you need. You will need things from the deep ocean as well as the tops of mountains and everything in between. So if you're not okay with the standard map(which will expand if the devs stay true to their word) as well as the multitude of custom maps that are starting to pop up, then this isn't the game for you."

I mean if you go and join an established tribe that has fliers already then Ya but that's not exactly you yourself exploring the island from noob level in 2 weeks it's a shortcut skipping weeks of work to get your base setup and dinosaurs tamed and alive
ARK,3dy74y,cchance,2,Tue Jul 21 18:20:45 2015 UTC,"Due to the intense pain of building a system that can make such varied landscapes procedurally, i would think it is one of the last things to come out. That's if they ever get around to it."
ARK,3dy74y,Baalthoros,2,Mon Jul 20 14:56:01 2015 UTC,"The longer you wait, the further behind you will be. It does not matter if the map is procedurally generated or not. In Ark, it is really not about the landscape as it is on other games. And the fact that it is a set map allows you to learn it yourself and in time, learn as much as the next guy. If you honestly think a unique landscape is going to give you a ""leg up"" in this game, you are mistaken."

ARK,3dxi9z,iSinstrite,2,Mon Jul 20 10:17:39 2015 UTC,"If you want, a good approach I've found is to start on a pve server and learn the ropes a bit (people are usually pretty friendly). Then once you feel comfortable, you can start fresh on a pvp. Regardless, my best advice is to get a mic and talk to people in game in both pve and pvp. That's one way to make friends and stay alive."
ARK,3dxi9z,riiji,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:16:11 2015 UTC,"Servers: Are all servers PvP or are there some which are PvE only where I can learn without getting raided? I see a lot of raiding posts and stories and it looks like it would be fun getting into raid battles with other tribes.   There are PVP and PVE. Look at the server names. (PVPVE is PVP). But bear in mind that your character is per server. I'm on a PVP server and it's quite fun. You get raided a few times but you keep your levels and eventually you have a stone / metal house and can keep it together a bit better.   Location: In the game should I make my location a place that is hard to get to, and not well known? I have seen some people make elaborate bases which are hard to break in to, but with my lack of understanding the mechanics and crafting yet, I figure I should focus on the area alone and fortification later.   There aren't really such areas. If you find somewhere really elaborate then it's more likely that there will be rarer resources there and more people. You may want to look up maps of caves etc and try not to be too close to anything if you want to avoid people. Just look around and try to make sure you're not too close to other people of significant size. Try to pick somewhere that you have enough room to expand in. Don't over-think this question, just pick somewhere and start.   I have a somewhat busy lifestyle and only have 1-3 hours a day to play. If I wanted to later join a tribe and build a big base, level with them, unlock new tech, etc, do I need to be available to play more than that? I hear that a lot of farming must be done, so I'm not sure if 1-3 hours a day will cut it.   That's fine. You can go on your own, start a tribe or join one. Play a bit first to find out which tribes you like and to get a basic grip. Few tribes will have rules about play time and 1-3 hours a day is plenty. Don't expect to be handed things for free, but you'll get a bit of help and security."

PVPVE is usually a good option if you don't want to be randomly raided/griefed, but would still like to PVP (eventually)"

ARK,3dxi9z,shaggy1265,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:12:58 2015 UTC,Just go look for a PvE server to start with. I recommend a 2x tame and perhaps 2x resource gathering to start out with. Get to know how things work and how the game plays before you even think about doing PvP. I've seen many a horror story about a guy joining a tribe in PvP and doing a bunch of work to gain acceptance just to be given the boot when the guys in the tribe feel they got enough work out of him.

My opinion is that fortitude should be used to balance out the negative aspects of the armor. In my case (Assuming there there isn't any funky applications i need to account for) my end result would bring me to +117 Hypo and only -28 Hyper."

ARK,3dukcc,Teeklin,15,Sun Jul 19 16:54:08 2015 UTC,"On offical 27,  two tribe mates and I took out a 30+ tribe doing the same thing.  We used to spawn in and craft bows and Spears just to mess with them and kill the occasional Dino, but all we did was show them the weak parts of their base.  So we spent a week incognito crafting about 1k + grenades and waited for a prime time to grief the entire base.  Sunday rolled around and it was about 5 am est.  We watched the friends list of one of the main tribe leaders as one by one they logged off.  Under the cover of darkness we approached the base.  Closing in on 6am one of the ""morning crew""  logs.  Rifles in hand we waited for him to leave the base. We jump and slay him and his Saber.  We then proceed to crack into the base while two of us kept guard.  Once inside we just aggroed all the dinos into one location and had a mass exodus.  The one member logged in couldn't keep up with our crack shot squad,  even with multiple sets of flak.  The raid took about 3 hours of looting and breaking down walls.  Once all was said and done about 2 Brontos were left standing and the entire base was raided.  3 more members started logging in and blaming the only member on saying he was a mole,  and that their base was impenetrable.  Even though they built under a cliff with only a layer of spikes guarding the ridge.  We all say nothing and let the drama unfold.  Logging off,  we all rest easy that night.  The next day we log on to everyone thanking us and letting us know how much turmoil we caused to the ""big tribe"".  They all started to blame each other and eventually left the server.  It's a much better place here on 27 now.  And everyone looks up to our tribe of 3. I feel like we made history on 27 that many will not forget.    TL;DR official server 27 was over run by a 30+ tribe.  Late night we griefed all the mounts and base with about 1k grenades.  The next day they left the server.  *edit: spelling"

They were bullies. they didnt raid for materials, they raided to flatten. We were one of the two biggest tribes other than them, and we were on good terms with the oither big tribe. So as the only forces to stop these bullies of the server, we decided to start crafting exactly 400 grenades at one of the two bases. These people caught wind of the plan and raided us, they stole the grenades, walked over to the other big base, and blew it up.

ARK,3dukcc,NEMESiSupreme,2,Sun Jul 19 19:20:53 2015 UTC,If you want them to raid you every day and point out the weak spots in their base and spent less time preparing to take them out.  Then yes this is a great strategy.  (I know this from experience) a few bullets are nothing to a 30+ tribe and target practice only helps them

ARK,3dukcc,Strategic-GamingTV,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:19:24 2015 UTC,"I just wish they would put some larger official servers in and then impose tribe member limits based on maximum capacity. Cause a 30 man tribe on a 200 man server would be great, but a 30 man tribe on a 70 man server is slight overkill. I think 20 or so would keep it from being so overwhelming. Cause right now, no limit means you either all have to give up your identity and band together to rout one tribe, or that one tribe slowly grows until they are 70% of the online population at any given time and there is nothing to do.   Then again, they will just make multiple tribes and keep bullying anyway so a limit really doesn't help against determined trolls/bullies. Gotta be something that can be done to keep groups like the Chinese from locusting their way from server to server and wrecking people with sheer numbers."

ARK,3dsodq,vaschenko,2,Sun Jul 19 05:48:55 2015 UTC,"If you left them on passive, they would not fight back if something attacks them, so a raptor could have just eaten them all alive."

ARK,3dsodq,Zagubadu,2,Sun Jul 19 10:48:12 2015 UTC,"Dinos glitch in sometimes.. just saying..   I think what actually happened is some dick just killed them. Either shooting at them from a vantage point from above.. maybe threw grenades in there or something?  But yea I have confirmation that sometimes if a player kills your dino it won't tell you, we had some shitty pig looking thing I had tamed, and since we got a trike my friend said screw it and decided to hack Frothy to pieces (new to the game didnt know about abandoning or w.e its called) but yea he killed him when I was offline and when I signed it I had no message or any type of alert."

ARK,3dsodq,Zagubadu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:24:19 2015 UTC,Yea the real goal is setting up your base somewhere where non of the aggressive dinos wander.. only thing that kinda gets close to my base are Dilos but we haven't had many issues with them.

ARK,3dsodq,Arkillaz,2,Tue Jul 21 08:55:36 2015 UTC,"I hear you man.  Yesterday i lost every single dino.  Trike, Ank, 2 Dilos, Pteradon, Parasaur, two Raptors and even my 2 Dodos.  Most over lvl 60. No messeges or notifications to say they had died and no structure damage.  Just gone. I spent around 2 hours scouting the area in a panic on foot after logging in as i was not sure if they had perhaps all glitched outside or something (...i dont know, i was paniced).  You cant give up on your dino bros just like that.  I fucking loved that Raptor. But if they are going to randomly kill or erase all of your dinos, at least let us know so we dont spend the time searching."

What irks me is most time, even when you do get a message something died, you do not know why it died. You simply get a message that so-and-so died. I think you have to be somewhat close to get that message as well. If you are a ways away, you will never get a message."
ARK,3dsodq,reddit1440,-9,Mon Jul 20 20:37:06 2015 UTC,The meat in your dilos would have spoiled and they would have become hungry and killed your herbivores for food. You need at least 2 stacks of food in each dilo if your logging off for the night.
ARK,3dsodq,luckydraw4a,4,Sun Jul 19 03:07:42 2015 UTC,"When a dino is on stop and not aggressive, it doesn't use much food. They were also in the exact same spot that they were in when I logged off.

You lasted all of three minutes when the bullets started flying.  We planned that attack and resource pooled for four hours and, as expected, you crumbled like a soggy biscuit.  I may offer some advice, if you care to listen, I suggest you don't go round killing other tribes dinos and assests if you wish to aviod confrontation and retaliation.  Have you heard of PvE servers, they might be a good shout for you and your team, perhaps give them a try?  The Exodus server, to which I am the Admin you accuse of 'cheating', is a positive and transparent community focused server.  In the two and a bit weeks since going live we've worked hard to build up a good following of decent respectable tribes and survivors and have thus far suceeded in creating a balanced enjoyable and challenging gameplay environment.  Judging by the torrent of rage diatribe chatbox spam that came from you after the raid your neither used to playing in such an environment or combat experienced.  Perhaps then you would realise how n00bish your cries and flames actually are.  I wish you and your tribe all the best in the future learning how to ride your bikes and sincerley hope, especially for the wider community's sake, that you are one day able to take off your stablizers without spitting your dummies out and crying like babies.  .

ARK,3dsezr,Man_of_the_water,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:04:22 2015 UTC,"Gotta be careful: bows have both a base 95 torpor, and a scaling torpor percentage based off the damage done.   Look up weapon damages if you want to do the math at which point it is more effective.   There may be a point where more low damage shots (body as opposed to head, half draw vs full) may be more effective."
ARK,3dsezr,Cloakedbug,2,Sun Jul 19 04:08:01 2015 UTC,"unsure of what you mean by a base 95 torpor, when i was testing a loose bow fire only did 28 torpor while a full did over 50 and a crossbow hitting over 80, headshots both hitting the 200 cap on a player."

ARK,3dsezr,Voobz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:22:53 2015 UTC,"Well based off this I would say he's still right. It takes a fully charged bow shot to get the full effect, 100% damage, from your tranq arrow. I assume that the crossbow does 100% of the tranq arrow damage on every shot, and no charge time required so crossbow>bow, no?"
ARK,3dsezr,Voobz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:09:10 2015 UTC,"From my test the crossbow does more damage and torpor per shot than the bow fully drawn, BUT it also does allot more damage. I was killing things with the crossbow before getting them knocked out (with 5 second intervals ofc)."

Things like the wooden windows and stone windows I skipped because lets be honest I can just put a doorway higher up and slam a door on it if I feel like I need a window.  Some things are just useless as far as learning the engram, because as you play you find blueprints that just make you want to slap yourself for learning when you find the blueprint for it."

ARK,3dtasn,Mr_Nice_,2,Mon Jul 20 17:57:53 2015 UTC,Dang honestly building in PvE sounds horrible. No point if your base is made out of kryptonite or tampons.
ARK,3dtasn,algeo1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:43:57 2015 UTC,Windows are for defence. If you don't have an outer layer with walkways and windows then you can't shoot from safety. If you die with a window open its no big deal but dying with a door open lets them get to your corpse and whatever else.

ARK,3ds83l,ptq,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:13:44 2015 UTC,I think using metal is the best way. It took to much effort and C4 to completely destroy a metal base.
ARK,3ds83l,Dark_Monkey94,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:09:32 2015 UTC,Never build higher than 2 stories. Always build in stone and then upgrade to metal later. Build in locations that are difficult to get to and have limited paths of access so you can block them off. Put metal spikes anywhere someone can land. Make small rooms with lots of doors as this greatly increases the amount of explosive needed to get through the base. Badly made bases can be fully raided with 10 grenades as you just have outer wall and then maybe one internal door. Build lots of small rooms so they have to blow at least 4 or 5 doors to get from one side to the other. You can hide a few auto turrets behind doors at the end of long corridors to give them a surprise with no where to hide.  One good trick it to build in a crevice that can only be reached with a ladder. If they start blowing stuff up the ladder gets destroyed and makes it harder to attack. For this to work best it needs to be under an overhang. Could tell you where but I don't want it to be taken on every server.  You can demolish a wall and put scorpions inside your base not adjacent to external wall then make wall up again behind them and set them to aggressive. High level scorpions don't take that long to train but will kill anyone not mounted really quickly.

As for the wood gathering … for the short part of the bridge (at the island) I used the Metal Hatchet and a Pteranodon to fly to the forest and back.

It's not just Chinese... it's really any large around the clock group. I've seen English speakers overrun official servers, along with Eastern Europeans/Russians, Brazilians. There's nothing to reign in overpowering with more numbers on the official servers.  My group started our own server. Love the game, but without some mechanism to have official ""raiding times"" ... no one playing without a MASSIVE group around the clock can survive.  We crank up structure resistance most of the time so c4 only scratches. Unless there's a formal ""declaration of war"". Then we set structure resistance to near normal levels for an agreed apon ""prime time"".  Right now we just adjust the resistance settings manually, though I know some servers have done the same with scripts so prime time structures are vulnerable, but sleepy time structures are nearly invulnerable. Some people need sleep and want to keep their real life jobs."

Alternately, if you have fliers, you can use them to move your stuff. They hold a lot less so you will need quite a few if you plan on moving a lot. Luckily, Pteranos are pretty easy to tame. The birds can hold a lot more, but are not as common and are generally in more dangerous territory when trying to tame one."

They are fairly easy if you have someone that can make tranq arrows and you find one stuck in some trees. If not, the sling shot will knock one out with about 30 stones.Once you get the tranq arrows though, try for some pteranodons. It is nice when you finally get some air support. It will open up the entire island to you."

I am uncertain of connecting several tanks to one system and one crop plot. logic says that 3 or 4 of them may well work, if they share the drain between them. That's going to be quite an expensive setup though.  the metal version will probably work a lot better with a much larger capacity."

ARK,3dl7d2,tx_sunset,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:45:44 2015 UTC,The rain itself will replenish the 200 water that each plot holds. I have never built a water tank ever and my crops generally do fine after I manually fill them up with water using the water skins. I would just try it without the water tanks for a a few days and see if the natural rain does not keep them watered on their own. We grew plants for weeks without any irrigation before I figured out irrigation. They grew fine and the plots were always full of water.

One example were a Japanese tribe on my server who was accused of the same, but looking at their livestreams they appear completely legitimate.  There were also complaints about exploits like the destroying of a base to drop a vault which resets its pin code (which was an exploit and fixed) which they apparently used - but to be fair, the people complaining about it, if they were in the same situation there's no way in hell they wouldnt have done the very same thing.   Not unlike people who bitch about being raided when offline but have done the very same multiple times. It's all a bit rich.  The racism though, that's phasing me and my tribe.

There are a number of PvE servers you can jump on that will keep most griefing to a minimum, but a game like this, they do get through Honestly though, there are a lot of people promoting their servers as player friendly and schedule raid time. Often forbidding week day raiding or off hours raiding. Playing on a server like that with those rules should keep you safe most times."

ARK,3di5x0,UsagiYokai,2,Thu Jul 16 14:43:55 2015 UTC,A few friends and I are on an official PvE server and everyone else on there is polite and very helpful. Only thing that might wreck your base or kill you are aggressive dinos/prehistoric fish/birds/etc. Although you don't have to worry about your neighbors most of the time (next door neighbor likes to play pranks on me) it's still a very fun and challenging game. :)
ARK,3di5x0,Deranged40,2,Thu Jul 16 15:25:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly, keep to private (non-official) servers that say they have anti-griefing policies and/or base raiding policies and guidelines.  This game is not like other survival games in that it doesn't really take any preparation to just flatten a base. If someone's walking through the woods on a t-rex and they see a building, the decision to demolish every structural item that makes up the building is a decision that can and will be made on a whim. And that t-rex is immediately ready to eat the next building, too.  Hours or even days of effort spent erecting buildings can be completely wiped out on a whim.   Base raiding is one thing, but that doesn't happen on ARK. Base elimination happens. On official servers, you'll never login to a hole in the wall and empty storage containers. You very well may login to absolutely no structure at all."
ARK,3di5x0,StormSaxon,2,Thu Jul 16 17:16:01 2015 UTC,"Ditto on Usagi, PvE is nice if you can't always dedicate tons of time. Don't get me wrong, I've logged almost 200 hours already, but it's hard enough to defend yourself from dinos let alone dinos AND raiders.

ARK,3di5x0,Teeklin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:25:26 2015 UTC,"This is a tough one.  Griefing is common....ish.   It is odd how it is developing socially on the official servers i have been on. Personally i have run into just as many friendly players as i have griefers but i believe it is very circumstance based. In Day z for example, one can run off alone, gather up nice gear and dominate an area if they know the game well enough. With Ark this is not so much possible.  You find yourself very quickly seeing the benefit of working with others as getting well equipped is not so easy.  You are dumped on a beach and land just short of having to discover fire again.  You feel how vulnerable you are and making your first wooden spear feels like a massive accomplishment.  In turn, a lot of the people you meet are in the exact same scenario so the interactions play out accordingly. To add to this, there is a decent chance you have both witnessed or fallen victim to someone killing for sport or going on a power trip with a rex.  When you add all of this together, people know how valuable a friend can be and how troublesome an enemy can be. I hope this helps in some way.  Apologies for the ramble."
ARK,3di5x0,frigginjoe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:37:47 2015 UTC,"You can tailor the experience to your play style through server choice.  Official Servers can be rough, lots of very hard core players around all day and night that can really fuck your world up if you're not able to join with a big tribe.  But then there are tons of private servers and PvE servers that don't give you many of those problems at all.  If you're playing on a server with 10x tame speed for example, it doesn't really bother you too much when someone kills your level 20 Trike because it's only losing a few minutes.  Or servers that set specific times that you can raid so everyone knows to be on and defending because everyone is fair game, etc.  While it's possible to totally incapacitate and imprison someone, it doesn't happen often enough to worry about it."
ARK,3di5x0,Kraix12,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:59:47 2015 UTC,"Mixed bag in my experience. My server is a PvPvE server with the rules of PvP if you want to but no griefing new players and more or less go to war with tribes that want to do the same. Great group of people so far, but it's still pretty low population.  I'd recommend private servers that state no griefing and see how the admin tribe holds their end of it up."
ARK,3di5x0,jmknsd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:00:46 2015 UTC,I recommend a private server with increased tame speed and xp boost. I had several issues starting with getting raided and losing my stuff. Swapped to a official server tamed a dino that took 4 hours then it died in less then 1 hour. Now on a private server and takes about 40 minutes for the same dino.
ARK,3di5x0,Nefferson,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:04:31 2015 UTC,"I think offline nuisance raiding is extremely common. I think many of the official servers have large chinese/asian player bases that get on very early in the morning (USA time), and rampage. In my experience, they kill you and destroy your bed. Sometimes they take my stuff, sometimes not. I've never had them destroy any of my equipment though.  As far as getting camped nonstopped, I've not seen or heard of that. The closest thing would be large scale pvp, where a well fortified base takes a long time to fully get through.   Frequently when you die, you will not be able to get your body back. At low-mid levels this isn't much of a setback if your base is in tact. Even getting your base destroyed isn't much of a set back early on, as you will destroy it yourself when you upgrade to stone, albeit piece by piece instead of all at once. The first 15 levels or so you and all your stuff is essentially disposable, able to be replaced in a relatively short time.  Just don't try to stockpile anything early on. Set smallish goals, and accomplish them. You get XP for harvesting and building and crafting, so as long as you don't sit on a ton of raw materials, any rebuilding and repairing you do is just more XP.  Losing your dinos sucks. There are servers out there that prohibit it, or PvE servers that make it impossible. The early game dinos are fairly quick and easy to tame, and are no great loss if killed. And if my tribe is any example, you're fairly likely to get your own dinos killed without the assistance of hostile players.  If you don't have a protected pen(3-4 high stone walls and spikes) to put them in, then expect to lose them. I don't have any experience with higher end play on official servers though. The group I was with didn't like the mass offline raiding, and we moved to a pvp server with ""don't be a dick"" rules in place that prevent most of these issues"""
ARK,3di5x0,BigBizzle151,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:15:57 2015 UTC,"It's all trial and error when finding a nice server to settle in.   I prefer unofficial servers, however, their stability is either based on a host computer being on all the time or renting server space on a site. Which of course runs the risk of the server owners stopping payment on the server abruptly and losing everything.  There's really not 100% way to play the game grief free, but the first time is finding a server with a nice community. The one I'm in is 4-5 smaller tribes living pretty stress free and helping eachother out. It's really nice.   But if your window of play time is under a few hours a day, I'd strongly recommend looking into an unofficial server with shorter taming times and XP multipliers. Makes recovering from losses easier, and allows you to see the end game content."
ARK,3di5x0,applejack885,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:28:49 2015 UTC,"Griefing? Not terribly common from what I've seen. Raiding is a constant threat, though. People aren't likely to lock you in a cage or camp your body, but if you're on a PvP server, you will need a large tribe or you might get killed every time you log out for the day. PvE servers fix this somewhat but they get incredibly cluttered with player structures and it messes with creature spawning.  If you played Rust this is pretty much identical, except for the dinosaurs of course. Your husband is right that high level people are going to steal your things and kill you, but that doesn't need to ruin the experience entirely. TBH, I am moving to a private server after getting sick of getting murdered on a PvP Official server constantly."
ARK,3di5x0,Sevran,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:51:17 2015 UTC,"In an official server, it happens all the time. You could join a PvE server or a moderated PvP server with rules"
ARK,3di5x0,Emonnick,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:55:50 2015 UTC,"As others have stated, yes there is a lot of griefing that I've seen. However, there are ways to still have fun with the game. There are always the PvE servers (which admittedly can sometimes be as frustrating for other reasons) and unofficial servers which are probably the best option. These unofficial servers often are run by active moderators and admins that enforce rules of pvp and such, and many are set to increased experience gain and gathering rate to its easier to get back on your feet if you do somehow lose everything.   If he just wants to play on an official PvP server but fears the griefers, then there's really not much to be done. The best advice I can give would be to quickly join or form a strong tribe dedicated to surviving. It can be rough and you will likely get knocked around a bit, but with perseverance it is possible to build up to a point where it's very hard for people to grief you.   All in all this is a great game and can be very fun from many different angles. BUT if you get mad/upset easily by griefers or pvp in general, you should probably stick to the unofficial servers (which are advertised constantly on this sub).   Hope this helps!"
ARK,3di5x0,tehgimpage,0,Fri Jul 17 15:48:49 2015 UTC,you could try a hardcore pvp server people are usually less likely to fuck with you cause if they die they loose all their levels. The server that i play on does not have a problem with it at all because pvp hardcore official server 92 is not on the server list but you can play it so there is only my tribe and one other tribe that plays on it.
ARK,3di5x0,3v3ryd4yw1nn1n6,0,Thu Jul 16 16:03:56 2015 UTC,"depends on the server. there's going to be a lot of griefing on the public servers... but lots of people have private servers with rules like ""no kos"" or ""no offline raiding"" that make it a less hostile environment.  our server is called Taco Tuesday and we're all pretty chill on it. we keep active admins that don't cheat, and update regularly. you're welcome to come play on it and learn the game! we're pvp, but most the tribes are friendly. would love to have ya!"

It was not starving. It was penned up in an area that no predators could get to it. I just get a message it died and when I ran over there, there was just a bag with the saddle in it.

I have a 17"" quad core MBP, but not with the upgraded GPU, and it barely runs it with all settings down, and then it's still choppy.  I only use my laptop to gather crops at work or simple stuff like that."
ARK,3dkw32,Tex-Rob,2,Fri Jul 17 04:52:09 2015 UTC,I'm away from my nice computer now and am currently using a 2012 Macbook Pro. I decided to try to download ark and on the lowest settings it runs. I can turn a couple settings to medium just so everythings not fuzzy blurs (textures and whatnot) and i get 15-20 fps. Load times are quite long but the game is playable. I'd say on a newer macbook without all the crap I have on this (partitioned hard drive/ hasn't been wiped in years) you could fudge around the resolution settings so it looks decent and you get ~30+ fps.

Of you have a higher end card, you really should not have too many problems at all. I play every day almost and it runs fine for me.

ARK,3dixwa,mr_trouble,2,Thu Jul 16 17:34:10 2015 UTC,"Took these numbers while not hot or cold (Thanks @Candyballz). These aren't precise, just me writing down as fast as I can.  Day (first sample):  game time: 1400, real time: 1847, food: 71.2, water: 98.2  game time: 1500, real time: 1850, food: 70.7, water: 95.6  Day (second sample):  game time: 1530, real time: 1851, food: 70.5, water: 94.4  game time: 1630, real time: 1853, food: 70.0, water: 92.1  So food is running down at .5/game hour or 2.5 real minutes, water is draining at 2.45/game hour or 2.5 real minutes.  Night (first sample):  game time: 2300, real time: 1902, food: 85.4, water: 78.4  game time: 000, real time: 1903, food: 85.3, water: 78.0  Night (second sample):  game time: 100, real time: 1903, food: 85.3, water: 77.5  game time: 200, real time: 1904, food: 85.2, water: 77.0  Food slowed down at .1/game hour or 1 real minutes and water drained at .45/game hour or 1 real minute.  Not all the data seems to line up perfectly linearly (most likely due to my imprecise sampling), but looks like the food/water drain is tied to real time ticks on the clock vs. day/night cycle speed. So messing with day/night timing shouldn't have any wonky affect on consumption rates on dinos and players."

The inside wall and the outside. What is happening in your screen shot is it is trying to snap to the inside wall surface. Just play with the placing and the angle you are viewing the ladder at and eventually it will snap to the top of the already placed ladder piece. It may be a piece of coding they need to tweak to objects do not try to snap to the outside of the inside wall surface, but for now, all I can say is welcome to early access gaming."

Another possibility is to get a few pteradons and use them for ease of movement both for scouting areas as well as farming things like metal veins on mountain tops.  Once you have a T-rex however, unless you get ganged up on by multiple carnivores bigger than a carno you pretty much can't die in a straight up fight so they are really good for security as well as being awesome."

I use my metal pike almost exclusively when I go out hunting and I can stand toe to toe with just about anything up to a Carno. Raptors die in 2-3 stabs. Carnos in about 4-5. Maybe tame more carnos to escort you around the island? But often, I go out hunting solo. It adds a certain element of excitement to the hunt. Carry tranq arrows with you. With some beasts, it is easier to knock em out then kill them rather than try to kill them outright. But if you do, try to use normal arrows in your bow. If you are fast enough, you can out-sprint the Rexes, then turn around fire a few more arrows and run some more. In MMOs that is called Kiting."

ANd it is strange that they are only dying when I am near. Like the dead Ichthy died just moments before I get fully logged in. And the Anklyo died just as I was returning to base. And even if it was just hunger, my own Carnos should not have have been feasting on it. They were still attacking it when I came around the corner. It was like a glitch happened that caused them to attack each other. I hope they fix it before many more die. Of it was something arduous to tame, I would be far more upset. As it is, an Anklyo and an Ichthy are not too bad to tame. Plus our base is in a pretty safe spot that does not spawn a lot of vicious carnivores. It is on the peninsula of the Gulch of Lamentation.

ARK,3dcwlo,BcrdNCola,2,Wed Jul 15 09:58:48 2015 UTC,"This is a result of the server admin not force saving before updating past 185.62. Happened on my server and we had players that were -135 engram points or more.  There was a save bug in that version that didn't save any character levels/the world.  You're probably actually short a few levels from where you logged off. Just level once or twice and it should balance itself out. You haven't lost any engrams you purchased from that point, just the XP."
ARK,3dcwlo,Rabitepoo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:46:24 2015 UTC,^ This guy is right.  I lost 4 levels (went from 38 to 34) due to our server not autosaving on that patch.  I gain engram pts the first two levels and then got a huge minus on the next two.  I think it's all balanced out though because i kept the engrams that i had learned on the way to level 38 (i had the Pteranodon saddle already learned when i dinged 35).

ARK,3da6ty,kenyankingkony,3,Tue Jul 14 22:23:35 2015 UTC,Will do. Dino gates at the bottom next and then a ramp up for large dinos too (although this may be too hard. As the overhangs down require supports and the ramps don't have a snap point on the bottom. So this would take 1000's of wood to build walls as well as ramps as to keep the decent going) so Im probably going to build a tower to world hieght instead. Until a lift system can be improvised anyways.   Edit: This was done by placing a foundation on one side then extending it out by two ceilings. Then taking a pteradon (fully ladden so it's slower) and placing pillars from the top down underneth the ceilings until you reach the ground. You can then extend the by two more ceilings and repeat process to extend the bridge. This works over water too and is much easier as you dont need a pteradon.

Hop on an unofficial server and ask the admins is my advice.  3) I think ARK is about 1/4 done, but this is based off released dinos and how much they wanted to release.  4) Definitely play in a tribe. One of my in-game neighbours got raided yet our tribe was left alone, because we were more geared due to 4 people building the base instead of 1.  5) No content resets AFAIK and they update once every 2-3 days."

ARK,3dd2ao,HeavenlyCastiel,4,Wed Jul 15 09:07:35 2015 UTC,"I dont understand your complaints... First, the large tribe vs the small tribe is exactly how the world works... To test this out start a company and see just how many bigger companies with more money try to either squish you like the bug you are, or simply corner your market until you are not relevant and are pushed into obscurity. With out social/government laws the old way of thinking will always hold true - ""Might makes right"".   Your second request to allow people to transfer is already in existence, you simply need to take your toon to a obelisk and upload your character.   Your third point about time commitments - I agree it can be stressful and annoying to spend a lot of time grinding for something only to have it disappear over night. My suggestion is to do what i did... either move to an unofficial server ( I host my own, and it is a PvPvE server - But we do not allow base/dino griefing. Meaning you can raid ppl but not kill all their dinos for the hell of it, or ruin their base... you can blow up walls to steal from them but not destroy the whole base)  Your forth point is null and voided with patch 186.3 - They have done just this ""Dino Kibble"" is now a ""Super food"" to help with taming... albeit its not a game changer as far as speed is concerned... Still -Dinos should require a commitment they should be earned IMHO not handed out.   Your last comment about notifying who raided you - I am completely against this, not just NO!, but HELL NO!!! and im not a raider. If someone breaks into your house while you are at work and no one is home... you have no clue who stole your stuff. I will meet you half way however, and agree that a ""Security Camera"" that records 8hrs at a time before refreshing will give the ability to review whats going on if you hide it well and its not destroyed.   Finally, I disagree with you that the player base will die.. I think it will evolve - I think you will see more and more people leaving the official servers if the dino/base greifing continues and I think you will see people/weaker tribes forced into adapting their playstyle to exist or coexist within the other play styles of other people - Just like in real life.

ARK,3dd2ao,OddJawb,0,Wed Jul 15 14:04:00 2015 UTC,"You've got a lot of valid ck concerns here and can totally sympathize with most of them.   However I disagree with your main point and I'll boil it down to a casual v hardcore scenario (because I'm on my phone and am too lazy to type more).  You mention a fear of casual players being forced out or marginalized into a subservient role to the more powerful tribes, and I actually agree with you. BUT I think that's the nature of the game. It is a Survival game, and survival of the fittest still applies.   For a more casual player or group I would strongly suggest an unofficial server where you can moderate rules for pvp and griefing. In these environments you can enjoy the fruits of your labor and progress at your own pace."

ARK,3da2qg,btk_kyle,3,Tue Jul 14 17:56:46 2015 UTC,All you need is the dolphin. The sharks can't catch it. Your sarco won't stand a chance out there.
ARK,3da2qg,rambarian,3,Tue Jul 14 20:16:31 2015 UTC,"This.  No need to jump right into a megalodon, dolphins are like um...sea raptors?"
ARK,3da2qg,SlothOfDoom,2,Wed Jul 15 03:51:23 2015 UTC,"I believe the sarco will be a bit out matched in the sea, mainly because it will likely be outnumbered and slower. If I were you I would tame a megalodon of your own and use that. The Dolphins are also an option because of their exceptional speed, and could be used for fast trips to gather resources and return quickly, but you would have to run from every encounter as they can't hold a candle in combat. Also, build an enclosure for whatever water dino you use. I have had a couple be attacked by wild megalodons when just left near the beach.   Edit: spelling."
ARK,3da2qg,Sevran,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:32:34 2015 UTC,"Sarco speed in ""following"" mode is enough to follow a dolphin? i want to move my base and i have the 2, i want to try to use the sarco as a mule, but i dont know how fast are in open sea."
ARK,3da2qg,Lebestier,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:57:57 2015 UTC,"Doubtful. A lot of it depends on how you've allocated the dino's skill points. If you're using the sarco as a mule you're likely putting the points into carry weight and health, whereas on an ickthy you'd likely want your points in movement speed.   It shouldn't be a real problem though, you'll just need to pace yourself a bit if you're riding the dolphin so you don't lose the sarco. Also be wary, your combat skills will be diminished while riding the dolphin."
ARK,3da2qg,Sevran,2,Wed Jul 15 14:37:31 2015 UTC,"We use the ichthys to mine and explore the water and they work great. Though I have not tried it, I have read if you can get their damage up to 400%+, they can stand toe to toe with the megalodons. I prefer the ichthys as they are fast, easy to tame and making a saddle will not break the bank, so to speak. As far as advise about using your Sarco, If it is your only one and you do not want to chance losing it, do not take it out exploring."
ARK,3da2qg,tx_sunset,2,Tue Jul 14 20:19:14 2015 UTC,Get a bowser and tank it out. You'll need a movement speed of at least %114 to outswim megalodons. With a hefty inventory they may catch you.  The best way to dodge them is to swim above them and look down. If you are even with them they will somehow turn and hit you.
ARK,3da2qg,ExiledApprentice,3,Wed Jul 15 01:44:11 2015 UTC,"I never thought of this, it's actually a fairly interesting idea. We have a level 80+ turtle with over 4500 HP, Mega bites would probably be like a frickin' mosquito bite to him."
ARK,3da2qg,sabrenation81,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:27:58 2015 UTC,"Don't use the Sarco.   I'm in a similar-sized tribe and our first underwater expedition turned into a disaster. Long story short, I got attacked while mining, forgot to set my Mega to passive so he freaked out and started attacking the pack of sharks around me, I couldn't catch him so we could escape, I wound up drowning.   Anyway all that is unrelated - what is related is that I tried to recover my pack using our sarco. Bad idea, their turning radius in the water is so slow it's hard to even land an attack and either way it doesn't matter because a megalodon will put out WAY more damage - and they're too slow to swim away.   Get yourself a dolphin or your own Megalodon - taming the Mega can be a pain because you can't shoot tranq arrows under water. You have to draw one close enough to a rock you can stand on to shoot it from outside the water. The good thing about taming them is it can be a VERY fast process once you actually get one knocked out - Megas drop raw prime meat. Once you get one knocked out, swim around in the nearby area  and kill surrounding Megalodons. At 45 you can kill even fairly high level ones with a pike, just don't let yourself get swarmed - they hit hard. Kill them, harvest the raw prime meat, and throw it on your unconscious Mega to supercharge the taming speed."
ARK,3da2qg,sabrenation81,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:49:46 2015 UTC,"You could have possibly gotten him back with whistles - they have a long range. Firstly passive then follow - although i imagine its easier said than done, spare of the moment and underwater with limited air/stamina which always stresses me out!"
ARK,3da2qg,Deepjay,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:44:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I could've probably gotten away if I didn't panic but going from peacefully mining oil to being attacked by 5 megalodons at once isn't exactly something know to induce calm and clear thinking. :)"
ARK,3da2qg,sabrenation81,2,Wed Jul 15 04:23:41 2015 UTC,"My biggest thing about going in the water is how fast i run out of air and stamina, i've had far too many of those close calls where you onlY JUST make it to the surface before you drown. Scary bloody place! Bring on scuba gear!!"
ARK,3da2qg,Deepjay,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:46:16 2015 UTC,"Lazarus Chowder. You can stay under for a very long time to the point where initially a mount isn't necessary.  The Icthy is very fast, but until you level it, it takes a long time to kill Megalodons and won't survive too many bites. I imagine going up to a Megalodon/Plesiosaur is a good long term goal if you have the time to tame.  Before you tame anything, build somewhere safe to keep it. I haven't gone higher than a dolphin because I play on a pvp server and don't want to spend the hours taming if it's unlikely to last the night!"
ARK,3da2qg,Salamol,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:12:30 2015 UTC,I would suggest getting a megalodon before venturing into the water. The reason behind that is I too am in a small 3 man tribe and when we went into the water with a sarco it got killed pretty quickly because of the other megalodons. We ended up getting 2 megalodons and farming pearls/oil/crystal hasn't been easier. They easily kill everything in their way and are faster than the sarcos(faster than the one we had at least)

My issue is ARK used to do this automatically (create backup files with the date stamp in the file name) but since the crash I had, It does not do that anymore. Also, you can make a backup of the files without having to shut down the server. the files are not locked by the server when it is running. You can copy them to another folder easily."
ARK,3d8zh5,teefletch,2,Tue Jul 14 13:02:01 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately the vast majority of official servers are like this. Aggressive tribes will form up and go on raiding sprees, destroying and taking everything they find whether it has value or not. From my personal experience most people aren't safe until you get stone structures. If a large well off tribe has an eye on your stuff, a wooden wall with spikes isn't going to stop them.   My advice would be find a spot in the forest, away from beaches and rivers and build there. Get your resources from far off so you are not chopping away the camoflaging trees and stones from around you, and hope for the best while you level up to the point where you can build a more defensible home.   As a 24/7 survival game Ark has a lot of potential for fun and excitement but also for grieving and attacking offline people. Most Raiders will hit you when  you are offline. If you want to compete you really need to join or form a strong tribe. Solo players don't make it far on official pvp servers. If you want to play at your own pace and learn the game as you go without getting destroyed every couple of days or weeks I suggest joining an unofficial server with limited pvp rules (such as no attacking offline players or killing passive pets).   I hope some of this is helpful, good luck!"

Plan for that room as you build with wood and make sure that the roof and the foundation are stone, then expand out with upgrades."

Now this is important: when you are done playing for the day, destroy the top most ladder.   So far it has kept our wood house safe for a couple weeks in a high traffic area on an official server"

The reason your raptor is running out of food is because it's spoiling while you're offline. Raw meat spoils every 15? minutes in a dino's inventory, so a full stack of raw meat will spoil over night within a raptor's inventory. Because dinosaurs don't eat while not active, you should put all of your food in a preservation bin while offline, and put it back in the dinosaur when you get back on."

They tame easily and if you put all of their level up points in carry wight they can lift quite a bit. Some will also have naturally good carry weight stats, so if you tame one of those it's even better.   The only downside really is that when powering their weight you neglect health and stamina, so they are quite easy to kill if another player or wild carno has a mind to do so.

ARK,3d6269,Serpenthum,7,Mon Jul 13 20:24:31 2015 UTC,"Wood = trex or spino. Stone/metal = grenades or c4. Take turrets out by wasting their ammo or with grenades. Attack corners if going through wall so damage is spread on more panels. Doors are cheaper to blow up but that's where the owner expects you to be.  Don't kill people in base, just drag body into water so they drown and destroy their bed. This way they don't get kill message and know who you are. Also don't kill their dinos, just tranq them and steal saddles and contents. Eagles are the best dino for quick getaway with high price loot but risky because you might have to make a few trips to get everything and can be sniped out of sky. Trex or spino is great for farming lots of low level bases in a single pass but is risky to bring it to a high level base in case they throw grenades at it or snipe you off it."

Also playing locally, once you drop out of the game the world saves and ""pauses"" so if its 11pm on Sunday and I'm in the middle of taming something I can save and exit and whenever I have time to play again I can just resume my tame."
ARK,3d56sf,2ocks,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:59:23 2015 UTC,"That's cool, I didn't know it saved states like that. What's the deal with updating patches on local games? I thought I read somewhere that you lose your local character if you update the local server but I didn't think to look into it more until now."
ARK,3d56sf,iCommentSomtimes,2,Mon Jul 13 18:08:22 2015 UTC,"I've been playing for a little over a week I believe, through steam with automatic updates enabled and I haven't lost my progress or character yet."

ARK,3d56sf,thenbmeade,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:48:37 2015 UTC,"I mean the obvious way to avoid griefing is to play on a PvE server rather than PvP. If only playing PvE is a deal breaker for you there is always the option to find a non-official server that suits you. Many non-official PvP servers have rules enforced to counteract griefing in many ways such as disabling structure damage during the night time, increased durability to structures at all times, and other rules that are pretty well enforced. Here is a link to the list of servers http://arkservers.net/, try some out but also frequent this subreddit, many people advertise their new servers on here. If that is too much work and you are keen on playing on an official PvP server i suggest you buckle down and learn the basics of the game and look to join a tribe. There is much less you have to manage when in a tribe but still just as fun."
ARK,3d56sf,Belrook,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:20:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the link! I think I will try out a PvE server to get my bearings, if I get the game. ;)"
ARK,3d56sf,Jdonavan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:47:38 2015 UTC,"How does one get around all the griefing? As some one who can only put an hour a day into games right now, I want my experience to be a good one.   Honestly, at one hour a day, you are probably going to lose your stuff every night for the first week or two at least if you roll on an official server and do not join a decent tribe.  There are many servers out there that can accomodate you though, i.e. PvE weekdays and PvP weekend servers.   I have a fundamentally negative opinion on early access games. This game is making me want to make an exception. How is this game in its current state?   For me, the game is MORE than worth what it costs even if it never comes out of EA. That being said, there are absolutely optimization and lag issues that make the game unplayable for some.  If you do not have a very powerful computer, do not expect to get visuals like you see in trailers."
ARK,3d56sf,Belrook,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:44:45 2015 UTC,I may just have to PvE then...
ARK,3d56sf,SlothOfDoom,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:48:11 2015 UTC,"My best advice is find a nice active clan to co op with, you still get to have fun, accept the game is accelerated and you have more people as defense, unfortunately it makes you a bigger target"
ARK,3d56sf,Kalpally,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:01:29 2015 UTC,"Well you can play by yourself, granted it will be a long journey to get far in the game, otherwise like other people have said, find a tribe that is active and accepting new players."
ARK,3d56sf,3v3ryd4yw1nn1n6,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:19:41 2015 UTC,"If you can only play an hour each day with no exception, this isn't the game for you.  You won't be able to tame most creatures in that time, period.  If you find yourself with more gaming time later on, though, consider it.  This is fantastic game regardless of EA status, and if you can handle updates hitting four times a week, you'll probably enjoy it."
ARK,3d56sf,Pyroraptor,2,Mon Jul 13 18:25:45 2015 UTC,Is there a single player mode? I can exit the game and resume my tame later on?
ARK,3d56sf,3v3ryd4yw1nn1n6,2,Mon Jul 13 23:49:53 2015 UTC,There is a single player mode but I've not tried it.

ARK,3d56sf,noob_dragon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:33:25 2015 UTC,I play single player and also do not have much time to play. I increase the harvest of items and dinos. 96 hours in and I have a nice base and three dinos tamed. My computer is not top of the line by any means and I get decent fps and visuals in single player. Downside is the game literally takes me 10 minutes to load in. But that doesn't stop me. I just use that time to grab me a drink. Have fun.

ARK,3d56sf,Buddheia,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:20:02 2015 UTC,"This is the first post I read on this subreddit, so I am untainted :)  I played for my first time on Friday night (7/10) and logged more hours Saturday and Sunday. Hope the experience of my first 10-15 hours in game will help:  tl:dr Ark will either run slow or run ugly. You will have fun but don't expect your stuff to be around next time you want to play for a few reasons. Play with a friend or the slow parts (and rebuilding) will make you want to quit.  On to my initial thoughts/experience:  Friday: Ark is a resource HOG. I have a laptop and can play most modern games at default settings. I had to tune Ark down to run at all AND it takes forever to load. I like not reading the guides so Friday I bumbled around and got the hang of things. A buddy also bought the game and we had fun via trial and error. Before we called it a night, we both died and had trouble finding our house, but we meet up and log off inside.  Saturday: Ark started crashing on load and since it takes forever to load, it was painful. We wanted to try different builds so we logged on to a different (official) server. We learned how to tame and after succeeding with a dilophosaur, we spend a long (LONG) time and tamed a trike (triceratops). A kind soul gives us a harness and things get awesome. We ride the trike and I feel unstoppable as the trike shakes the earth and knocks down trees. Could have just ridden him around more but it's time to call it a night.   Sunday: We can't log back onto the server with the tamed trike. :( 70/70 players and neither of us can grab a free spot (server full message after the long loading). We go back to the first server and find our house broken into, all our stuff stolen, and we were killed in our sleep. We take it in stride and focus on experimenting (him with building, me with cookpot). Good times, but still pining to ride that trike again. Chances are next time we log in, our guard dinos will be dead and our stuff stolen/destroyed. Still, the rinse and repeat will be fun for at least a while longer as long as I have my buddy (and my faithful trike) at my side."

ARK,3d56sf,AdmiralXiggy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:51:10 2015 UTC,"play solo/offline.  adjust the config files to your liking (default is a bit slow, when solo, but perfect for online when you need to watch your ass.)  or, find a private server.  unlike some other games, this game IS accessible solo.  you can tame a Rex alone with not much trouble.  as for EA... i look at them this way, ""do i get the value?"" and with this game it is a resounding, ""YES!""    nearly 150 hours for $30.  DEAL!  having played some 10+ EA games now, this game is getting serious Developer LOVE!  updates nearly every day... average to probably 10/week.  this is on the level of Kerbal Space Program or Minecraft, in its level of developer attention and communication (two EA games that really make the case for Early Access!)"
ARK,3d5wtv,mauri11,3,Mon Jul 13 19:47:56 2015 UTC,"No, its not in the game yet. As the only boss in the game is the broodmother and i dont think there gunna add the bosses before they add all the dinos that they want too."

ARK,3d5wtv,Shadow_Runner13,2,Mon Jul 13 20:02:09 2015 UTC,"Actually, I wouldn't be surprised to see them at another boss here soon.  It would give their max level players something new to do."
