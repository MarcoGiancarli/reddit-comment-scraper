Water contamination scandal of article  Chester Stranczek:       In April 2009 the Chicago Tribune reported that for 40 years the city had been drawing drinking water from a well contaminated with toxic chemicals. By secretly drawing water from their contaminated well, Crestwood officials saved $380,000 a year that otherwise would have been spent maintaining the water system, and avoided routine testing that would have alerted authorities to toxic chemicals in the village's drinking water.   In April 2013, Crestwood police chief Theresa Neubauer, who was also the city's water commissioner, and certified water operator Frank Scaccia were both found guilty of lying to environmental regulators about water quality. Chester Stranczek had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and was found not competent to testify about the pollution charges.

Sufficient calorie intake, but with insufficient protein consumption, distinguishes it from marasmus. Kwashiorkor cases occur in areas of famine or poor food supply.  Cases in the developed world are rare.   Jamaican pediatrician Cicely Williams introduced the name into the medical community in her 1935 Lancet article.  The name is derived from the Ga language of coastal Ghana, translated as ""the sickness the baby gets when the new baby comes"",  [citation needed] and reflecting the development of the condition in an older child who has been weaned from the breast when a younger sibling comes.  Breast milk contains proteins and amino acids vital to a child's growth. In at-risk populations, kwashiorkor may develop after a mother weans her child from breast milk, replacing it with a diet high in carbohydrates, especially starches, but deficient in protein.
