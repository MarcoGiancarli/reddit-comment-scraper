ragecomics,3b5ejp,AkumaNews,-4,Fri Jun 26 02:52:12 2015 UTC,Riiiight. Because women with degrees in gender studies can't identify problems with gender in society.   Might want to take this post to /r/im14andthisisdeep
ragecomics,3b5ejp,Just_Stop_Now,7,Fri Jun 26 03:20:54 2015 UTC,"The problem is, too many women are getting ""gender studies"" degrees instead of, you know, being the change they want to see; and honestly Gender studies? What the hell are you going to do with that? It's gotten to the point where these types literally have to make shit up in order to stay relevant so they can justify their shitty course choice"
ragecomics,3b5ejp,Just_Stop_Now,-9,Fri Jun 26 03:23:23 2015 UTC,"I actually don't think that's what the problem is. Degrees don't equal fair and balanced proportions in that career field. Also, they have every right to want more female representation in those fields and not ""be the change"" as you're talking about. Engineering is not for everyone, and you don't have to be an engineer to want more women to be engineers.   Secondly, you're standard for what makes a useful or good education is super off-putting to me. If nothing else, that degree is eliminating ignorance in the people who take that course. Learning has inherent value. It doesn't need to have financial or professional impacts for it to be valued. Now it may not be valued to you because of your own subjective view of useful. But I'd say that you are the minority if you really don't value education past financial gain."
ragecomics,3b5ejp,toodaysthrownaway,9,Fri Jun 26 03:39:42 2015 UTC,Just a heads up... a college education typically results in a decent amount of debt.. so please dont undervalue the career/salary aspects of said degree.. even if its not an engineering degreee.
ragecomics,3b5ejp,gooshwa,6,Fri Jun 26 11:19:32 2015 UTC,Don't forget you're on a worldwide platform. Many of us live in countries that value education. College tuition is free or well subsidised in some parts of the world.

ragecomics,3b5ejp,twisted_logic25,4,Sat Jun 27 16:42:06 2015 UTC,"No, there is a difference between indoctrination and education. Gender studies offers nothing other than marxist bullshit. Gender study degrees..... Oh look you got a degree in bitching and complaining, that's pretty much all it has and will ever amount to.  Now I refer you to this documentary.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5LRdW8xw70  For all the incentives and affirmative action aimed at helping to get women in these fields, it really has been a waste to one of the most feminist countries on earth (Sweden)..Face it, women generally are not as interested in STEM fields. They favor the soft sciences and careers with more social interaction. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT WOMEN LIKE TO SOCIALIZE?  I'm reminded of the old saying, You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink.  Studies have shown that there are inherent behavioral differences in boys and girls. Studies with primates even verify this. What makes good useful education? Oh I dunno, maybe taking a course in physics instead of fucking gender studies. Unless it's too hard so they bail out and take gender studies instead and then try to force their ideas onto other women.   Women, atleast here in the west and much of europe have every opportunity to study what they want. But the thing is equality of opportunity does not = equality of outcome..   You want to force parity for equalities sake, even when women don't want to go into those fields, or aren't as qualified to fill certain positions within a company...and that's pretty dumb."

ragecomics,3b5ejp,crachelmazing,3,Fri Jun 26 04:15:20 2015 UTC,"don't worry OP i agree with you. anyone should have the opportunity to go into what ever profession they want as long as they are qualified. regardless whether they are male or female, you cant just force representation, the armed forces is prominently male because more males choose to join the armed forces than females. midwifes are predominantly female because more females choose to be midwifes then males. but neither profession is excluding either gender"
ragecomics,3b5ejp,deHavillandDash8Q400,0,Fri Jun 26 16:28:57 2015 UTC,Honestly he is exactly the type of person who should be taking an introductory gender studies course. You did a good job trying to explain every thing.
ragecomics,3b5ejp,am-weiser,-3,Fri Jun 26 16:51:43 2015 UTC,"Dude get off your high horse,  please. You're making all of us look bad.    A woman studying gender studies has every right to want more women in x field.    I'd draw the line if they thought they should be hired and complained when they aren't,  but if they notice well qualified fellow women not getting into a field,  of course they have a right to point it out.   Secondly,  quit mocking and belittling other people to feel better about yourself. Not everyone goes to college/University to be the next lawyer/engineer/technical/whatever the trending job is that will be over saturated due to hype by the time you graduate.   Despite your 12 year old attitude,  you know better.  You know that the world needs people who major in art,  history,  drawing,  sociology,  hell even gender studies.    The world would be a boring place if everyone was only good at one thing.   There's plenty of jobs a college educated person can get with a gender studies major.  You're just choosing to remain ignorant and not seek out your own answers,  and instead make fun of others.   Not to mention who cares....?  It's not for you?  Great,  it's not for me either.  Am I going to belittle and mock anyone who wants to do it?   All this coming from a man who is against the attitude,  demeanor and general ideals of third wave feminism,  but for equal rights among all.   Lastly,  a protip for the future : the more you swear when trying to make a point,  the less seriously you'll be taken."

Common vegetables to stuff include tomato, pepper, onion, zucchini, eggplant, and garlic. The stuffing may or may not include meat. Meat dolmas are generally served warm, often with egg-lemon or garlic yogurt sauce; meatless ones are generally served cold. Stuffed vegetables are also common in Italian cuisine, where they are named ripieni (""stuffed"").

I thought that 9gager were mostly immature and unlikable people (not all of them, but most of them, especially after going into the comment section). In contrast, I had a good opinion of redditors. Not any more. I guess it depends on the subreddit.  I also like 9gag and I love reddit. I accept them both with their ups and downs. But I guess I'm wrong. I should hate 9gag and praise reddit and down vote anyone who doesn't believe like I do... I am disappointed. I always thought it should work like this.   lol typically I see people downvote comment's just because they dont agree with the persons opinion . Even if it contributes to the conversation it'll earn a downvote simply because someone doesn't agree with it.   This saddens me."

I noticed it and I find it annoying as well, but it's easier to skim through content there than it is here.  I haven't been on 9gag long enough to get sick of the jokes. And even if I see a dumb repost, I just scroll down.  I also dislike the 9gag comunity. The average IQ on 9gag is indeed way lower than here, but I must admit that reddit has dissapointed me with the hating recently. If we really hope to be superior to hardcore 9gagers, we must be tolerant, not hypocritical, like you said. The comment section on 9gag is also utter shit. Reddit is a lot better in that subject, but downvotes aren't used like they should be.  I avoid using the comment section and actually posting there. Reddit wins by far when it comes to that stuff.  All in all, I use 9gag for a quick laugh because its easy to use for that purpose (layout favors pictures and animations). When it comes to a more complex discussion, learning stuff, getting the news and making friends I come to Reddit.  TL;DR SO my point is, Reddit is obviously superior to 9gag in most regards, but that doesn't mean we all need to become haters and hate on people simply because they like 9gag despite its flaws."

ragecomics,34lu9k,autowikibot,2,Sun May 3 11:14:05 2015 UTC,"Synonym:       A synonym is a word or phrase that means exactly or nearly the same as another word or phrase in the same language. Words that are synonyms are said to be synonymous, and the state of being a synonym is called synonymy. The word comes from Ancient Greek syn (σύν) (""with"") and onoma (ὄνομα) (""name""). An example of synonyms are the words begin, start, and commence. Words can be synonymous when meant in certain senses, even if they are not synonymous in all of their senses. For example, if we talk about a long time or an extended time, long and extended are synonymous within that context. Synonyms with exact interchangeability share a seme or denotational sememe, whereas those with inexactly similar meanings share a broader denotational or connotational sememe and thus overlap within a semantic field. Some academics call the former type cognitive synonyms to distinguish them from the latter type, which they call near-synonyms.

ragecomics,3136gw,fuzzycrumpkin,1 point,Wed Apr 1 18:16:03 2015 UTC,"Karen straughan is awesome at detailing what MRA and the issues they stand for are, as well the problem of the feminist's ideology.  MRA is exactly like feminism except they believe feminists have taken to many rights without taking the obligations for those rights. Also the women ""rights"" they have put it place only help women and are not actually equal. Feminisms main goal seems to be obtaining what feminists believe is eqaulity rather then true eqaulity. You also have feminists groups that dictate a lot of what happens in the western world, like many laws in Canada have to actually go through a feminists office to be approved or not, and whether that law would hurt women. Simply being critical of that, you see that a feminist essentially has veto power over any laws. I would say that alone is not very balanced is it, what helps society as a whole doesn't necessarily help women.  Like I'll give you an example, there was a guy named earl that was trying to establish a battered men's shelter and he wanted to get a law passed that would allow government fund to be allocated to such. It passed through that feminists office and there it stopped because it was thought that it would take away from then women battered shelter. The last I heard there were 1000 home for battered women and not a single one for battered men.   Its unbalances like this that MRAs want to fix, and primarily are trying to rally behind issues like education, marriage, the draft, parental right, domestic abuse, sexual assault, and just plain sexism versus males.  I'm not an MRA and are very critical of them in fact, but they make a lot more sense then the feminists who blame patriarchy for everyone's woes and ignore stats or studies that don't reflect their dogma. They will often tote around false statistics and cherry picked facts. The radical feminist are actually on the same level or worse then Nazis or kkk members and other groups of feminists don't actively try and denounce those actions or thoughts, which is why I consider feminist a hate group. Even Nazis had their moderate idealist, but we all know how WWII turned out..."

ragecomics,3136gw,reggaeradar,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:01:26 2015 UTC,Feminists are crazy. The more radical ones actually believe in reducing the entire men's population down to only 10 percent and they feel justified in doing so.  Most feminists don't even believe a woman can rape a man.

ragecomics,2zez3i,Wolv90,2,Thu Mar 19 00:22:08 2015 UTC,"Well, the ""dressing up like a leprechaun"" comes from the color green, which has connotations to Saint Patrick. And since leprechauns are often shown wearing green in artwork and their connections to Ireland, I don't see it as being offensive.    And, drinking just tends to happen when people are partying. Besides, St. Paddy's Day was known as a feast day for hundreds of years. Drinking has been connected to it from the beginning."

ragecomics,2v86ii,thatthatguy,1 point,Mon Feb 9 17:01:23 2015 UTC,"Well I am sure the right virtue for anyone would be to not purposely hurt anyone or their property. Other than that what you said is valid. All these arguments that do not have a true or false are vague and depends on the person. What I meant was what would the short term goal that is possible do feminists actually believe in. Things like treating both genders almost equally can be seen with newer generations as they work together and grow up in a good society. But we are different. We cannot be the same. There are evolutionary traits that have been established and you can't just discard them without changing the person. The long term goal for equality in the workplace is never going to happen. Statistically there are fewer women that perform physically intensive jobs than men. Something like that is not going to be possible to do 50/50. But something like IT which is brain work is. It depends on the field. But just because you are one gender doesn't mean you get special treatment because there is a minority in that field. Businesses want/need talent and if they are hiring talent based on gender than it's their loss. This argument depends and won't be solved with one reddit comment. There are just too many cases and variables and contradictions, I understand this. But I have heard the common ones repeatedly such as the image and I am tired of these statements of ""we want this and that and you have this and that etc"". Can there just be a simple discussion on an actual plan of going about this? Can emma watson (or anyone but shes popular as a feminist) and a team sit down and create a system that may work in a majority of places specific to the situation? It might just be my pet-peeve but ""raising awareness"" only does so much in a first world country and third world countries have trouble supporting themselves (many reasons acceptable and not) and cannot do this. It's just insane for protesters to just chant something and have changes be made without time/money/effort and a PLAN!"

I rented one of the rooms for a few months and slowly became ""that guy"".  The reason I stuck around and the reason I say it was to a lesser extent was because it caused me to be around for those moments, especially during mardi gras, spring break, xmas and new years seasons. They were kind enough to hook me up with different friends from out of state, followed through with mistletoe and new year's kissing and weren't shy when it came to drunk flashing or macking if we went out to clubs. Sometimes it's not all bad.  Note: I drew the line when it came to going to the mall and they drew it when it came to pretending we'd ever poked... it's just respectful, ya know?"

But economist Paulo Rabello de Castro (from Movimento Brasil Eficiente) explains it all below, in a more professional way:  This huge discrepancy in fuel prices between Brazil and US is mainly due to the government’s tax burden on the product. While the sum of taxes, levies and charges in Brazil represent approximately 55% of the fuel price, in the US they represent a mere 13%."

ragecomics,2mu5ej,Brintyboo,1 point,Fri Nov 21 14:38:30 2014 UTC,Because there is no dirt.  It's a grass lawn.
ragecomics,2mu5ej,MrShazbot,2,Fri Nov 21 16:16:31 2014 UTC,"Shrivel into dirt then...... Like, what is the fallout from leaving dead leaves on the ground? Do nasty things live in them? Do they start to smell? Are they dangerous to have on the ground (can they get slippery)? Why exactly do people feel the need to pick them up?"
ragecomics,2mu5ej,pizzahut91,2,Sat Nov 22 07:15:15 2014 UTC,"It is only an issue if you have a lawn of grass under the trees that you are trying to protect. Leaves take a long time to decompose if just left on the ground to rot. They will also seal off the grass from the sunlight above, and grow a layer of mold that will begin to kill the lawn.   Also, leaves decomposing can cause a soil issue called denitrification, which removes soil nutrients because they are used in the process of breaking down the leaves (which are almost pure carbon - no nutrients left by the time they fall off the trees in autumn).  We believe that trees evolved dropping leaves to kill off competing plants near the base of the tree (competition for nutrients in the soil) by smothering them. This becomes an issue if you are going for the modern, spotless green grass lawn look."
