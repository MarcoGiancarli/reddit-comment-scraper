tiara,3e5e5n,_Captain_Fantasy,2,Wed Jul 22 02:24:08 2015 UTC,"By the looks of it, T-ARA seems ready to start releasing Chinese songs now, with the release of ""1, 2, 3""    ""Completely Crazy."" I wonder if the comeback will be reminiscent of ""I Go Crazy Because Of You."""
tiara,3e5e5n,_Captain_Fantasy,3,Wed Jul 22 02:29:23 2015 UTC,"On WeiBo, Korean Yin Yue Tai says that 1, 2, 3 will be included on the Chinese album.   Yep... T-ARA China album. :)  T-ARA is the only group I listen to that has songs in 4 different languages."
tiara,3e5e5n,1004Homard,3,Wed Jul 22 02:50:21 2015 UTC,The China album is very interesting. The fans in China deserve it (:
tiara,3e5e5n,1004Homard,4,Wed Jul 22 02:58:12 2015 UTC,"It better be the best BB song ever.  I'm a little conflicted since I generally don't like Brave songs. There are exceptions as ""Love Options"" is one of my favorite songs :< I guess I'm a little afraid of being let down by the song, but in reality, my love for T-ara is far greater than my dislike for BB.  We'll be ok. Still hyped :DDD"
tiara,3e5e5n,onimonkii,3,Wed Jul 22 02:33:47 2015 UTC,"i am with you, when they hit they hit hard, and when they don't they're making sistar's alone for the 400th time"
tiara,3e5e5n,_Captain_Fantasy,2,Wed Jul 22 02:35:58 2015 UTC,"He did Nice Body and Fake It from Hyomin's album. I liked those a lot.   The guy is on a hot streak right now with his American debut so we're getting him at a good time.   At this point, I'd prefer Brave Bros to another Duble Sidekick track."
tiara,3e5e5n,rudrachl,2,Wed Jul 22 02:40:49 2015 UTC,"I believe in Brave Brothers to make an awesome comeback for T-ARA. Personally, I think he did a wonderful job on Hyomin's ""Nice Body,"" and I like the songs he's done for AOA. I think we'll be pleasantly surprised. I just wonder how his trademark ""Brave Sound"" intro will be incorporated into the song."
tiara,3e5e5n,_Captain_Fantasy,3,Wed Jul 22 02:42:24 2015 UTC,Can someone list me a couple of brave bros songs of T-ara and other groups please? I dont know where to check that info.
tiara,3e5e5n,rudrachl,3,Wed Jul 22 03:13:17 2015 UTC,"In addition to Nice Body and Fake It from Hyomin's album, he recently made AoA's Heart Attack, and a bunch of songs for 4Minute, Big Bang and basically everything Sistar has ever done."
tiara,3e5e5n,rudrachl,4,Wed Jul 22 03:21:05 2015 UTC,"I've listened to Heart Attack a shit ton since it came out, now I'm hyped!"
tiara,3e5e5n,Ryalis,2,Wed Jul 22 03:41:59 2015 UTC,Here's Brave Brothers wikipedia page. You can find the songs he has produced if you scroll down the page.    A song he just produced that isn't on the list is the new Hello Venus song I'm Ill.
tiara,3e5e5n,Ryalis,3,Wed Jul 22 03:19:01 2015 UTC,"ah! didnt know they havent made any T-ara song, but definitely like a lot of those songs"
tiara,3e5e5n,DjSweetBazz,3,Wed Jul 22 03:39:53 2015 UTC,"Exciting! Also, could Jiyeon's outfit be a teaser for the concept? I really loved their previous performances with the marine/sailor outfit."
tiara,3e5e5n,Crusty_Dick,3,Wed Jul 22 05:21:33 2015 UTC,"Interesting thought. Jiyeon's outfit could be a teaser for their concept. Anything is possible, but we will have to wait and see. Either way, I'm confident T-ARA's new concept is going to be fantastic!"
tiara,3e5e5n,_Captain_Fantasy,3,Wed Jul 22 05:27:25 2015 UTC,That's for sure!

tiara,3e5lck,Blivyeon,2,Wed Jul 22 03:53:10 2015 UTC,"What's cool is that this is a collaborative effort between China (YinYueTai) and Korea (Gaon). Always good to see the two working together.   Also, the article posted a slight mistake when it said T-ARA had over 2 million points.   In reality, T-ARA had over 20,000,000 points! The author missed a digit. :p  After BAP whom T-ARA beat by around 3,000,000 the numbers drop off sharply by 15 million.  It was a pretty dominant victory."
tiara,3e5lck,Blivyeon,2,Wed Jul 22 03:59:29 2015 UTC,"Oh my, I think leaving out the extra 0 is a pretty big mistake. Well, technically the author wasn't wrong since 20 million is still over 2 million. :p"

tiara,3dxrex,InsufferableCush,7,Mon Jul 20 12:13:22 2015 UTC,Any song produced by Shinsadong Tiger  Jeon Won Diary by T-ara N4 Target and a bunch of their other Japanese songs   These are just some of my favorites. There's too many to list so you just gotta discover all of them on your own.
tiara,3dxrex,pbdonut,5,Mon Jul 20 14:59:06 2015 UTC,"I forgot Jeon Won Diary...but, I'll definitely look into Shinsadong Tiger and their Japanese songs."
tiara,3dxrex,pbdonut,6,Mon Jul 20 15:01:07 2015 UTC,"Check out Shinsadong Tiger especially. He has produced a lot of T-ara's best songs. And I don't know if you know this already but all five songs you mentioned in your original post were produced by him and if you liked them, you'll definitely like his other stuff for T-ara as well."
tiara,3dxrex,pbdonut,6,Mon Jul 20 15:12:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, was just looking up the wiki page on T-ara songs, and literally all of their songs I've like were produced by him, even their popular I didn't particularly like were not produced by him.  By Japanese songs, do you mean their Jap. song versions or songs exclusively in Japanese?"
tiara,3dxrex,_Captain_Fantasy,6,Mon Jul 20 15:25:38 2015 UTC,"Check out both. T-ara's original Japanese songs are great. Although, songs that were translated from Korean > Japanese and vice-versa are usually not as great as the original version but it's up to you whether you're going to like them or not. Personally, I prefer the original versions but I think that TTL was translated well into Japanese."
tiara,3dxrex,_Captain_Fantasy,4,Mon Jul 20 16:10:32 2015 UTC,"Additionally, if you like the EDM sound, the Sugar Free EDM album is fantastic!  DJ Jeffrey Choi's version is solid."
tiara,3dxrex,Kanra951,5,Mon Jul 20 19:10:26 2015 UTC,Lucky Wannabe from the Gossip Girls album (JP) was really good. There are some really great tracks on that album like A-Ha too.  Tic Tic Toc from Absolute First Album was one of the tracks that really hooked me.
tiara,3dxrex,baronvonhungster,5,Mon Jul 20 18:46:51 2015 UTC,ORGR and TTL are my personal favourites.
tiara,3dxrex,daeyeth,4,Mon Jul 20 19:06:10 2015 UTC,Shinsadong Tiger is to T-ARA like BraveSound is to AOA.

Their fan didn't like any of their songs  T-ara didn't smile at their fans   I didn't even have to read the article to see that there's something wrong with these statements haha

If I were in Mongolia, I'd like to ride out in the Gobi Desert to see where T-ARA did their album photos for Number Nine."

tiara,3dwcgr,Crusty_Dick,3,Mon Jul 20 09:04:11 2015 UTC,CR: @chesskidgaf  The author got the text wrong because T-ARA has 6 members since 2013 and had 6 members when they went to Mongolia. I'm sure any student Queen's will point this out to their teacher. :p
tiara,3dwcgr,Blivyeon,3,Mon Jul 20 02:09:15 2015 UTC,Are you sure they only had 6 members since starting in 2013? I believe Arum left the group somewhere between 2013-14..

tiara,3cemt5,_Captain_Fantasy,3,Tue Jul 7 08:57:18 2015 UTC,"I just finished the Meet and Greet.   Eunjung looked great dressed casually and comfortably. She started out with a brief greeting and then gave some commentary on her MV teaser as it played on screen (the first one with ""Jenny"" instead of Eunjung when Elsie was still a secret). Then she started quickly in on selecting winning tiles from those who purchased albums. She hand selected a few member tiles and read the messages. Lots of natural aegyo all around but when asked specifically if she would do aegyo, she got embarrassed. It was cute.   After finishing selecting the winners and awarding the event's special prizes for the biggest supporters, she took a commerical break and came back to read questions from the fans. She also got to eat some fried, chicken, sushi and sandwich. Eunjung meokbang, basically. She really enjoyed a piece of sushi.   She read some of the comments from the live chat section. She read a comment I left that said ""I love your long hair"". She said it in English.   These things are fun. T-ARA seemed to have fun with it last time and Eunjung really did well. She looked relaxed and comfortable, as expected and had some funny moments too.  Would watch again.   There will likely be a replay of this available from MNet later and if not, I'm sure someone is already working hard on uploading tonight's footage to YouTube."
tiara,3cemt5,Blivyeon,4,Tue Jul 7 09:36:01 2015 UTC,The Meet&Greet was so much fun to watch! Definitely worth watching/participating in.
tiara,3cemt5,Blivyeon,3,Tue Jul 7 09:36:17 2015 UTC,"At the end, Eunjung said she was going to visit Jiyeon at The Show."
tiara,3cemt5,1004Homard,3,Tue Jul 7 09:54:15 2015 UTC,How exciting! Looking forward to the updates already!    Side note: I can't wait to receive Eunjung's album in the mail! The waiting game is the hardest part ._.
tiara,3cemt5,Blivyeon,3,Tue Jul 7 10:08:03 2015 UTC,"Oh EunJung... This girl never ceases to amaze me. She is and always will be my no. 1 and tonight really strengthens that for me. She did very well by herself and looked very comfortable. I felt it made everyone comfortable as well. That's not always the case with Meet&Greets.  When Cory asked her to say ""I love you"" I became instantly jealous that I didn't think of that myself! My heart would have melted :P  The meokbang was absolutely adorable. It looked like she enjoyed the chicken. She ate a piece, set it down, then came back later in the show to nibble on it some more. Silly girl could have gotten a whole new piece!  The event was about an hour long and I was smiling the whole time. It was so much that my mouth started to hurt (: I'm still smiling and giggling to myself hours later and my coworkers probably think that I'm a dorkface. That's what EunJung does to me. Turns me into a dorkface. Worth it."
tiara,3cemt5,Blivyeon,4,Tue Jul 7 11:30:27 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure we were all laughing and giggling, at the very least I was. Like you I was smiling the whole time. She's such an amazing person and has a wonderful personality. Cory was brilliant! I didn't think of asking her to say ""I love you,"" either. Time flew by so fast that the event seemed so short! It didn't even feel like an hour had passed. The Meet&Greet was definitely worth the watch! In my opinion, anything T-ARA related is worth the time. Eunjung fighting!"
tiara,3ce68p,t62pac,6,Tue Jul 7 05:24:54 2015 UTC,"Soyeon has the smaller face out of the three, I believe. Qri's face is more square-ish and Hyomin's is more oval shaped.  I highly suggest watching the variety show Invincible Youth to get to know Hyomin more."
tiara,3ce68p,jaytheillest,7,Tue Jul 7 05:50:17 2015 UTC,"Good call with Invincible Youth!  YouTube Channel ""KBSWorld"" has all the episodes subtitled. Here's Episode 1"
tiara,3ce68p,_Captain_Fantasy,3,Tue Jul 7 05:56:32 2015 UTC,Thanks for the link! I shall start now.
tiara,3ce68p,_Captain_Fantasy,5,Tue Jul 7 07:02:07 2015 UTC,This sounds like a good idea! I learned Jiyeon and Eunjung through watching Dream High so this should really help.
tiara,3ce68p,Ryalis,4,Tue Jul 7 07:01:57 2015 UTC,"Qri has her mole, she's the 2nd shortest member of the group which is useful in group photos, and she typically parts her hair in the middle.  Soyeon is pretty distinctive with her big eyes and how she purses her lips. Hyomin is tall, has a small face and her nose has a little bulb at the end."
tiara,3ce68p,1004Homard,3,Tue Jul 7 05:53:05 2015 UTC,This definitely makes things easier. As i'm looking through photos its super easy to spot out Soyeon now.  Using this picture with what you said makes it pretty easy!
tiara,3ce68p,rudrachl,4,Tue Jul 7 07:08:15 2015 UTC,"It might take time, but sooner or later you will be able to tell them apart without even looking at their faces! Also, Areum is a former member of T-ara. She left in 2013."
tiara,3cc6ri,_Captain_Fantasy,6,Mon Jul 6 19:45:48 2015 UTC,Congratulations T-ARA! What an amazing goal to achieve. This truly something worth celebrating! T-ARA is just getting started too! Their 'Great China Tour' will definitely have a significant impact on their increasing popularity there!
tiara,3cc6ri,Blivyeon,6,Mon Jul 6 19:53:58 2015 UTC,"This is my favorite fan at the moment:   Here's a picture of a fan who likes T-ARA so much, he's going to the Beijing show wearing a homemade Iron Man suit. From what I gather, the chest piece lights up and the eyes light up.   Obviously the armor is yellow to match T-ARA's fan color. Other than that, there's no real connection previously between Iron Man and T-ARA but hey, this guy is all-in so I have to give him big points for being enthusiastic. I imagine we'll see pics of him up in the stands."
tiara,3cc6ri,Blivyeon,3,Mon Jul 6 20:03:41 2015 UTC,I remember seeing this on WeiBo! I give this fan massive props for making something that creative. Got to love the enthusiasm! It's really cool seeing what the fans do/make to show their support.

tiara,3c3unj,Crusty_Dick,6,Sat Jul 4 17:20:36 2015 UTC,"Its kinda crazy to go back into the past during the time T-ara was on top and loved by everyone and than BOOM the bullying scandal hit and all hell broke lose.. I stuck by T-ara since the beginning even through all that chaos and have supported them all the way through. Its kinda scary too because I seriously thought it was going to be the end of T-ara.. To see them slowly rise back up the rankings and still be successful makes me very happy! lol. They may not be as popular and loved in Korea as much as before, but there fanbase is diffidently growing outside of Korea."

But I will still try to have some fun!   And it must have been amazing when she said yes! I haven't had a girlfriend myself :c, but with all the new people I will be meeting next year, I might just try my luck! Also, I hope you get through whatever you're facing right now. :)"

tiara,39rsya,t62pac,13,Sun Jun 14 03:18:38 2015 UTC,"2015 has been a busy year for T-ARA and they've been mostly focusing on China activities after their agency MBK Entertainment signed a big contract with LongZhen Culture in China. Their version of the Chopsticks Brothers viral hit ""Little Apple"" marked the start of their China promotions and was a big hit in the region!  Jiyeon is currently MC of SBS MTV The Show with Super Junior's ZhouMi and Vixx's HongBin.  T-ARA made a big splash in Malaysia headlining at a festival celebrating the Coronation of the Sultan of Johor. T-ARA was even invited to dine with the newly crowned Sultan at the Royal Palace, the first Koreans to receive such an honor.   T-ARA won big at the Yin Yue Tai VChart awards in China. Yin Yue Tai is one of, if not the biggest MV sharing site in China and their awards show was a big deal. T-ARA won 2 awards and Jiyeon won her own personal award for her song ""Never Ever"". No other Korean artist won more than 1.  Jiyeon just finished filming a Chinese-Korean collaboration film called ""The Encounter"" which should be premiering in October.   Eunjung just wrapped up her solo promotions for her mini album which included a Chinese language version of her title track. Earlier this year Eunjung was also featured on an SBS drama called ""Endless Love"".   T-ARA is currently working on a 6 episode web drama with each member having their own individual episode packaged in what Eunjung described as an Omnibus format. The series is scheduled to debut in September.  T-ARA just this past week performed at the Hong Kong Youth Music Festival and was awarded the Asian Idol Award. They also had a press conference for their web drama series which attracted a lot of fans.   T-ARA has also been busy with advertisements in China for a clothing brand called Celucasn. Jiyeon recently had a CF for Shu Uemura cosmetics too. MBK has also launched their own line of cosmetics called Clean Beauty which heavily features Jiyeon. MBK signed a huge contract for that brand.  Starting June 20, T-ARA will start their ""Great China Tour"" playing 6 shows in 6 cities through August including Nanjing, Beijing and Shanghai.   T-ARA members have also been making appearances on Korean variety shows like Star King and Hello Counselor. Eunjung is a frequent guest on a late night relationship talk show called Witch Hunt so they're pretty active in both Korea and China currently but moreso in China, definitely."
tiara,39rsya,_Captain_Fantasy,6,Sun Jun 14 04:09:24 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! Also, IIRC Soyeon mentioned in an interview that they might be having a comeback later in the year. Thats also something to look forward to."
tiara,39rsya,Ryalis,3,Sun Jun 14 06:15:40 2015 UTC,"I think it's also worth mentioning what awards T-ARA won at YinYueTai. They won the ""Most Popular Artist Award,"" ""Hot Star/Trend Award,"" and Jiyeon won ""Best Female Artist Award."""
tiara,39rsya,Blivyeon,3,Sun Jun 14 04:52:34 2015 UTC,Definitely!
tiara,39rsya,_Captain_Fantasy,4,Sun Jun 14 05:08:33 2015 UTC,Very insightful! So do they have a Chinese album already? And star king is one of my favorite varieties i'll have to check it out. Thanks again!
tiara,39rsya,Blivyeon,3,Sun Jun 14 06:06:10 2015 UTC,"Not exactly, they don't have a Chinese album, but T-ARA has a Korean/Chinese collaboration of the song Little Apple. Eunjung also made a Chinese version of I'm Good. These are the only Chinese songs T-ARA has M/Vs for, but these are pseudo Chinese because both Little Apple and I'm Good only have the choruses in Chinese. Unfortunately, T-ARA doesn't have many official tracks for sale that are in Chinese (I believe Little Apple and I'm Good are the only ones), like T-ARA had done previously when they re-released their hit songs with Japanese lyrics.  Here's the original version of I'm Good if you haven't listened to it already."
tiara,39rsya,_Captain_Fantasy,3,Sun Jun 14 06:40:13 2015 UTC,"They haven't released a Chinese album yet but they have released songs in Chinese before (Number Nine, Little Apple, Eunjung's ""I'm Good"" which as I type this is #1 on Yin Yue Tai's Mainland China MV chart). They're getting better at singing in Chinese so a future Chinese album is definitely possible. In one interview Soyeon said there would likely be a Chinese album at some point. Their schedule is pretty busy already with their upcoming tour and drama series.  BTW if you like the EDM genre, you should check out T-ARA's Sugar Free EDM album. There are some great remixes including tracks from DJ Ferry, DJ Chuckie, and DJ Jeffrey Choi."
tiara,39rsya,Crusty_Dick,4,Sun Jun 14 06:51:21 2015 UTC,I really hope they have a comeback soon! I'm praying for a super sexy comeback!

tiara,38pdkj,_Captain_Fantasy,2,Fri Jun 5 18:49:38 2015 UTC,One of the things Eunjung said is said she's changing her hair color soon.   Here is the link to the official Cool FM page
tiara,38k2ew,_Captain_Fantasy,3,Thu Jun 4 19:05:28 2015 UTC,Looks like she chopped her hair off?
tiara,38k2ew,meanbeanmachine,3,Thu Jun 4 20:10:21 2015 UTC,Either that or she had extensions but I like her short hair look here.
tiara,38bj4h,_Captain_Fantasy,5,Wed Jun 3 03:42:41 2015 UTC,I want a t-shirt with Jiyeon's drawings!
tiara,38bj4h,Crusty_Dick,3,Wed Jun 3 05:49:37 2015 UTC,10/10  I'd wear a t shirt with one of Jiyeon's drawings. :p

tiara,3891ya,Blivyeon,3,Tue Jun 2 18:17:06 2015 UTC,The comments are filled with ecstatic T-ARA fans!
tiara,3891ya,meanbeanmachine,2,Tue Jun 2 18:19:00 2015 UTC,I was really hoping they'd show up at one of the USA KCons =/  I'm guessing this is June 6 (judging by the 2015-6-6) so maybe there's a chance?
tiara,3891ya,_Captain_Fantasy,2,Tue Jun 2 22:29:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, the festival is this Saturday. Keep your head up there's still a chance! Although, T-ARA does seem to have their interests in China right now, but who knows they could come to KCon. It would be a pleasant surprise if they do!"

tiara,37zjpy,Tuss,3,Sun May 31 22:24:42 2015 UTC,Red is her color. Definitely!
tiara,37zjpy,_Captain_Fantasy,3,Sun May 31 19:56:12 2015 UTC,Her red hair and red dress is a great combination. I really like how they complimented her color and made it more vibrant by contrasting the red with the black dresses the backup dancers wore. Little details like that go a long way.
tiara,37zjpy,Crusty_Dick,3,Sun May 31 20:51:26 2015 UTC,I really want to see her perform this song with short hair!
