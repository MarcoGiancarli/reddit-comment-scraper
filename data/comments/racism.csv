I did once or twice when I was a preteen but my father always told me to think on how others would think of that joke.  And he grew up in the deep south in the 50's.  While I tend to not to be very confrontational if someone talking to me or the group I am in says a racist joke I usually just make a disgusted noise and walk away.  But that rarely happens now I will not abide by any dudes that think along trash thoughts like that one bit.  The critical part of breaking the chain is making parents see how damaging propagating racist behavior in their children is and to respond not with hatred when shown racism but with forgiveness if not at least showing the shame of what they do.  I read how this one KKK member was set upon by a group of black men and women and might ended up killing him if it wasn't for a single black woman that stood in their way and said 'no!'.  That act opened the eyes of that KKK member.  He fully expected anger and violence from those he hated, he was looking for validation.  When he got the opposite he realized wasn't the enemy that he was and changed his ways."

racism,3ds7jw,In_Medias_Res,0,Sun Jul 19 02:07:57 2015 UTC,"I totally hear what you're saying. I agree, truly. But don't you think that what Sanders is doing here is trying to keep the message of his campaign relatively uni-focal? It is a racist country, absolutely, as so he knows that to get elected, he cannot run on race issues. Even to get the Democratic nomination he cannot run on race issues. I know that seems cynical, but I feel that what Bernie Sanders feels he can win on is economic inequality. This ought to inspire all normal people, since all normal people are those who are hosed by inequality. For this reason I don't doubt that Bernie Sanders is more interested than Obama ever was in the advancement of black America."
racism,3ds7jw,BandarSeriBegawan,3,Sun Jul 19 04:27:20 2015 UTC,"But don't you think that what Sanders is doing here is trying to keep the message of his campaign relatively uni-focal   While I don't know whether or not that is his plan (it does not appear to be so to me), when has that worked for a politician? While every politician has an overarching platform, they tailor their speeches and talking points to their audiences, current events, and the environments they find themselves in.   For this reason I don't doubt that Bernie Sanders is more interested than Obama ever was in the advancement of black America.   That appears to be a non sequitur. Focusing on economic inequality does not mean that he is interested (or uninterested) in helping black America. Can you expand further?"
racism,3ds7jw,Intrinsic_Factors,2,Sun Jul 19 04:56:29 2015 UTC,"I can expand easily. Economic inequality is the number way in which white supremacy perpetuates itself. Economic inequality is another word for colonialism. It's a single issue. Sanders wants to tackle it at a broad level and with a broad base (all races) and so I don't blame him for taking the tack he did in this video, though it was not what I would have advised."
racism,3ds7jw,BandarSeriBegawan,3,Sun Jul 19 13:36:22 2015 UTC,"Economic inequality is the number way in which white supremacy perpetuates itself.    Even if we accept this as true, that still makes it a non sequitur. It still doesn't mean he's more interested in helping Black America than other individuals.  Martin O'malley (or Elizabeth Warren, or Joe Biden, etc.) also wants to combat income inequality. You're not saying the same things about him. Obama himself said he wanted to focus on income inequality and yet you're sure that Sanders is more interested in helping the black community than Obama. Income inequality also plays a major part in maintaining a male dominated society. You're not saying he's more interested in helping females than everyone else.  Nor is income inequality the only way white supremacy manifests. Nor is it the only issue facing black Americans. Speaking on income inequality (especially in general as he's doing) says little to nothing about his ability or willingness to help black Americans compared to other peoples. Disenfranchisement for AAs was an expression of white supremacy (and voter ID laws still predominantly affect minorities). The gutting of the voting rights act wasn't an economic maneuver. Anti-miscegenation laws were an expression of white supremacy. There are many examples within the legal system. When you say ""It's a single issue"", I can't tell if you mean that white supremacy and economic inequality are a single issue. If so, it's a separate issue even if it is related.   You can see it in the video of the event yesterday. When Bernie spoke about ""Jobs, not jails"", the reaction was positive. When he tried to revert to his prepared speech, it wasn't. The people didn't hear his interest in helping black America"
racism,3ds7jw,Intrinsic_Factors,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:00:52 2015 UTC,"No yeah, I'm with you: economic policy is not the only thing that effects black people. But economic inequality and racism soring from the same force and the same ideology, which is imperialism, hierarchy, control - an ancient ideology that even outdates race - indeed it invented race. So I am not saying I am perfectly happy with Sanders' platform on race either. But I am saying that I think I know what he is thinking, and that is that, as a pragmatist, he doesn't want to focus on what for most Americans is a niche issue, he wants to appeal to everyone. But he also wants black people to vote for him so it's going to be a tough line to walk. I would prefer and even recommend to him that he come out more strongly with anti-racist policy proposals, so as I said I am not satisfied with him either. But I don't think he himself has anything but the equality of all Americans in mind; and I think he understands and believes that equality for Americans means the uplift of the black american in this society."
racism,3ds7jw,BandarSeriBegawan,2,Sun Jul 19 18:07:04 2015 UTC,"But I am saying that I think I know what he is thinking, and that is that, as a pragmatist, he doesn't want to focus on what for most Americans is a niche issue, he wants to appeal to everyone.    I already commented on this in my 1st response. The way that politicians appeal to everyone (or at least everyone they want to vote for them) is by actively appealing to everyone, not taking the stance(s) that is most palatable to the greatest number of people. When politicians campaign for votes for the Iowa caucus, they speak about issues important to Iowans and elaborate about how their platform will help them. They don't worry about whether Floridians will consider what Iowans want ""a niche issue"". When they speak to women, they speak about women's rights, equal pay, etc. and how that politician's platform will help them.  They don't use the same talking points they would use in front of a group of men because they want to ""appeal to everyone"". When Barack Obama was campaigning in Puerto Rico, he didn't ignore their issues because Puerto Ricans only make up 1.5% of the population nationwide.  A pragmatist is someone focused on reaching a goal. The goal of a presidential candidate is to become President of the United States. You do that by winning votes. If Sanders (or any other candidate) isn't actively working to earn a group of constituents' votes (whether the rest of America considers that group's issues important or not), he will lose them.   But I don't think he himself has anything but the equality of all Americans in mind; and I think he understands and believes that equality for Americans means the uplift of the black american in this society.   I didn't question whether Sanders believes in helping the black community. I questioned this statement:   For this reason I don't doubt that Bernie Sanders is more interested than Obama ever was in the advancement of black America.   You don't show that Sanders is more interested than any other candidate in helping the black community by stating that he is trying to appeal to everyone in general (and not the black community in particular)"
racism,3ds7jw,Intrinsic_Factors,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:45:41 2015 UTC,"Ah, as to the comparison with other candidates: the burden of proof is I think on you. Can you show me a president or presidential candidate past or present who has passed your litmus test of actively proposing pro black policies? Obama did not. All Obama seems able to do is give the ""black fatherhood"" speech and other paternalistic upbraidments - he has done nothing to combat the real cause of racism and sexism and environmental degradation and all other social ills which is greed, selfishness, and hierarchical control and inequality. While sanders is not perfect, he is the only candidate who has attacked this head on. Sanders has put up the platform that the two issues of most pressing concern for average Americans are poverty and climate change. Who can argue with that?"
racism,3ds7jw,BandarSeriBegawan,2,Sun Jul 19 18:57:02 2015 UTC,"Wait what? You make a positive assertion, don't support it, and it's on everyone else to disprove it? That's illogical.   EDIT:Wikipedia on the argument from ignorance   who has passed your litmus test of actively proposing pro black policies?   And this is a major problem. Sanders has not proposed pro-black policies in his campaign. He's occasionally taken a pro-black stance, many times by making a pro-economic equality stance.   While sanders is not perfect, he is the only candidate who has attacked this head on. Sanders has put up the platform that the two issues of most pressing concern for average Americans are poverty and climate change.    Anyone who disagrees with those being the 2 most pressing issues? Or anyone who disagrees with your assertion that the ""real cause"" of the issues you listed is greed, selfishness, etc. Or (as you'll note is what is happening now in response to the events from yesterday) anyone who is worried that his focus on poverty won't translate into a focus on the black community.   EDIT #2: Gallup poll showing that minorities are 2x more likely to view racism as this country's greatest problem (over the economy and other issues)  You mentioned your criticisms on Obama. If you pull up some of Obama's early campaign speeches, you'll see him talking about economic inequality affecting the black community.   For example:   What Dr. King and Roy Wilkins understood is that it matters little if you have the right to sit at the front of the bus if you can’t afford the bus fare; it matters little if you have the right to sit at the lunch counter if you can’t afford the lunch. What they understood is that so long as Americans are denied the decent wages, and good benefits, and fair treatment they deserve, the dream for which so many gave so much will remain out of reach; that to live up to our founding promise of equality for all, we have to make sure that opportunity is open to all Americans.   There is more in that speech and the other speeches he gave on the campaign trail. And yet you go on to say how this turned into him doing nothing to combat ""the real cause"". At this point, Sanders has done nothing more than talk as well. Why does his talk register (with you) as him being more interested in helping the black community than similar talk from Obama at this point in their presidential campaigns? Or similar talk from other candidates?"

Even if they don't mean to be or know they are. Personally I've lived in places where the majority was white American , black American, Asian/Pacific Islander American or Latino-American and that's in the United States alone. I had to adjust or I'd be very lonely and scared. If you're never around people from other cultures or get to know/understand them at a young age it becomes much harder as you get older and more set in your beliefs. It's also a few bad experiences or good ones that can project your outlook on a group of people for a very long time. News, TV/Movies, and the Internet has been having a bigger influence than ever before as well, usually in very bias and manipulative ways. It's the unfortunate consequence of living in a ""free""  country. I'd like to say things are generally better but because race is such a forced construct (in the United States) it's probably never going to stop being used negatively against people."

As a way of saying that America is a White country (and a total negation of ""black lives matter""). Just like the claims that Obama is a Muslim - it is a way of saying that America is a Christian country and that Obama isn't the sort of Evangelical that Bush was, so he doesn't count as a ""Real True Christian"".   Trump isn't the 'crazy racist uncle' of the GOP. He speaks out loud what a lot of them want to say. That's why he gets airtime on Fox.   When dealing with authoritarians like Trump, you have to understand that a lot of what he says is a shortcut or abbreviation. And that there is an ""inner narrative"" and ""outer narrative"". The ""inner narrative"" is what he truly believes while the ""outer narrative"" is the story he tells to others. You may think that you're refuting what he says, but since the outer narrative is a throwaway, and you aren't refuting his inner narrative, then you can't get through with logic."

If you are raised with it and have tried to overcome it - as me with a nazi father and grandfather - you need to fight for your life time not to fall for it again as a dry alcoholic who always needs to control himself. On the other hand I'm suspecting that almost every human is kind of a born racist with the need to achieve love and respect for others or failing to do so.

racism,3cqyu0,AnAbstractHippo,8,Fri Jul 10 01:51:42 2015 UTC,"The gist of it is that you are conflating race with class, and using the European concept of race which is conflated with ethnicity (and thus nationality), instead of the American concept of race which does not depend on ethnicity so much (since it is one country). In America, the assimilating forces of the Melting Pot make us disregard the history of our national origins, and we start anew. This may be jarring for immigrants.  In America, race is composed of one's own identity and situation, as well as how other people generally perceive you. The latter is highly dependent on American socially constructed categorizations of phenotype, which is why some People of Color can ""pass"" as white yet retain a POC identity and experience the institutional effects of white supremacy that does not depend on appearance.  Race is a social construct that is fluid and has changed over time, at one time considering Americans of Italian and Irish descent non-white.  Class is a huge factor in America and the world. Some theorists argue that class drives racism in America, distracting poor whites from rich whites by focusing on another group (black people). While race intersects with class, experiencing classism in general does not make one non-white.  Immigrants may also face xenophobia, based on how their accent and manner of speech is perceived. However, Asian Americans generally face a ""perpetual foreigner"" form of racism, while white-looking immigrants can avoid it the more they acculturate to America.  Jewish people in America, who look white are racially white. It is an ethnoreligious group, not a racial one. Similarly, Hispanics, an America invention, are an ethnic group that depends primarily on national origin (as former Spanish colonies), and can, in fact, be white, Black, or even Asian. There are also white Mexicans.  Being white didn't stop the Jewish people in the Black Civil Rights movement from joining and, in some cases, dying for the cause. There is nothing wrong with being white. The problems stem from taking advantage of it. And it may seem like you have nothing to take advantage of when you are facing classism, but police are no more likely to shoot you dead on account based on your skin color, white supremacists aren't coming to your place of worship to kill you, and this list just keeps going on and on.  There's a lot of literature on this topic.  Historian David Reodiger puts forth the thesis that race in America is a historical phenomenon centered on labor, starting from slavery, in order to categorize non-slave people once there were freedmen (former slaves). The Wages of Whiteness (1991).  There's a famous Reddit post ""A kind-of long history of racial discrimination in America for redditors"" that's a good starting point for understanding race in America.  Of further interest to you is this AskHistorians thread with references for texts on race and immigration in America."

racism,3clnmx,yellowmix,4,Thu Jul 9 13:19:59 2015 UTC,"Fastest test for solidarity is to find out if a POC of color actually identifies as such. POC isn't a racial identity, it is a sociopolitical identity to signify solidarity.  Non-black POC are often marginalized to be invisible (e.g., indigenous people) or used as a wedge against black people. There are many Asians, Latinos, and recent African immigrants who lap up model minority myths so they avoid certain aspects and forms of white supremacy.  The US invented the ""Hispanic"" category which includes white people and muddies everything to do with race that uses that category. From Census data to public- and privately-funded studies that use that rich, public domain data. That the Census categorizes all people of Arab descent as white is another problem, but they are testing some new categories in 2020.  Class is a huge issue. Some Asian Americans don't feel solidarity with other Asian Americans based on nationality or other subdivisions, and it is exacerbated by class. I can't speak to intra-Latino relations. But many hateful ideas about black people combine with classist ideas.  Sex, as well, as white supremacy interacts with patriarchy creating different situations within the same race. Asian male emasculation, Asian female hypersexualization, for example. Then this is thrown into the arena of romantic relationships where one group is ""stealing"" from another while white people are always put on a pedestal.  The immigrant factor, as well. If you believe in the American Dream and internalize the Protestant work ethic, bootstraps and all, it is a strong ideology that conflicts with the reality of white supremacy.  As for subreddits for people of color in general, there's /r/hipsterracism as well. But I wouldn't mind revitalizing /r/peopleofcolor.

Their reasoning, according to the interviewee, is that CVS is worried about workers stealing or helping other people steal.   If that's true (and I would not be surprised to learn that it is), then I doubt CVS is alone.

racism,3c7rum,tokegar,22,Sun Jul 5 20:12:40 2015 UTC,"Blackout 2015, the portion unrelated to the moderator concerns protest (defaults going private), is racially motivated. The goal is to pressure Pao to resign so that the anti-harassment policy is reversed and the five harassing subreddits are reinstated. That's what it says in the Ellen Pao petition reason post made right after the five subreddits were banned:   First off I want to address what this petition is about. Yesterday a new policy was implemented on Reddit and was put into action immediately. Many subscribers of the banned subreddits and others became enraged. This petition was created during those moments. This petition; however, does not only concern that change, but the changes that have been made since Interim CEO Ellen Pao has been in charge. The new changes and new policies are in no doubt censorship which panders to a vocal minority.   One of the subreddits was fphate, where the mods doxxed Imgur staff in their sidebar. There was another fphate-style subreddit using a more disparaging term, two targeted LGBTQ people, and one had the slur targeting black people and sent brigades after them. This is what petition signers want back.  The moderators central to the initial protest have already ended their protest action as they are in a dialogue with admins and have a roadmap ahead. IAmA has determined their own solution, doing things their own way, I'm not sure what Science is doing about their AMAs but they've ended their action a long time ago.  I am a part of this moderator group, as I have been asking (along with many other people), for moderation tools years ago. This subreddit has co-signed the blackladies open letter, which asked for mod tools a year ago. This neglect is the sole issue, and it has been here far longer than Ellen Pao has been.   If anything, the policy changes made under Pao have made moderation better; ban evasion is now a clear reddit-wide offense. Getting rid of brigading harassment subreddits is part of addressing the moderators' number one complaint: brigades.  The people clamoring for other action clearly do not understand the moderator position and are trying to tack on their other agendas. Some of these people predate the anti-harassment ban and latched on Ellen Pao since she dared to sue an employer for discrimination. The worst thing they can say about it is that it ""shows her character"". Apparently these people oppose the concept of employment discrimination lawsuits.  And they keep refering vaguely to ""changes"" made under Pao, but never want to articulate what those are beyond charges of ""censorship"". Well, guess what, buddies, Reddit has been censoring stuff from the beginning -- moderators have a ""spam"" button separate from ""remove""."

Also, from what I can see it seems like alot of the campaigners are simply against the corporatism currently exposed in reddits structuring and want more community control in reddit.

racism,3c7rum,yellowmix,7,Sun Jul 5 20:18:01 2015 UTC,"Ah, yes, sorry, that is a very reddit-specific phenomenon and terminology.  A brigade, or more formally known as a downvote brigade is an event in which traffic sent to a subreddit changes the comment and voting patterns of that subreddit. It's basically a situation where someone new to a community should learn about it before saying anything about it, and there are also people hostile to the community, now hundreds or thousands of them all at once.  The hallmark of such an event are comments systematically downvoted ""into oblivion"", i.e., 3-or-more-digit negative numbers. Since then, the definition has expanded to include comments that would not normally be accepted by the community, where the community response is overpowered by a larger external (and sometimes hostile) group of people.  It disrupts communities and discourages community members from participating, some of them leaving Reddit entirely."

There were already people bombarding the main subs with stuff about her from the moment she was hired. At least, that's what I've seen. And from what I could tell, it was always an anti-feminist, racist movement. I mean, this is a website where people come out of the woodwork to tell you that pay discrimination against women is a lie and where they post dozens of articles about false rape accusations. They know they're being anti-feminist, they take pride in it. For any of those people to try to argue that none of that is relevant to their problems with Pao is disingenuous at best. And then of course what I saw during the fph fracas is that those people were fine with racist subs existing, they used their existence to bolster their argument that fph should be allowed. I mean of course it's hypocrisy to disallow one and not the other, but those people weren't arguing that subs like coontown shouldn't exist, they were saying that coontown and fph should both be allowed.   All this freedom of speech bullshit is about (at least in my opinion based on what I have seen) is that there are some really, really awful people on Reddit who want it to remain a safe haven for them to be awful, and they are going to shit all over the site in order to fight for what they want."

The Indian history books refer only to historical Kashmiri Brahmins as pandit, and they use the word ""pandit"" as an honorific title.

We're talking around 5000 years old vs 50,000 years old.  It's also pretty important to note that when we're talking about 50,000 year old fossils, I don't think many biologists, archeologists or anthropologists would think that it was reasonable to make any direct connections to modern racial or cultural designations.

I think the point you're trying to make is either than they're not given a ""special designation"" and you've made a typo. They often do have a ""special designation"" when there is enough evidence to reliably call them a people. They must have shared traits and must be contemporaries, hence why the Humans discovered at Combe-Capelle are not classified as Cro-Magnon.   Anthropologists of the past are implying to me that the Non-Europeans don't really merit a name.   Cro-Magnon is part of the European morphological clade known as European early modern Humans. There are also possibly Chinese and Indonesian & Australian clades. The latter two do not have catchy names because there is still some controversy over whether they actually existed and even if they did, it's unlikely they'd get a name other than ""archaic Chinese"" or archaic ""Sundalanders"" because this is 2015 and scientists would rather the general public not call them by some dumb moniker that will stick around forever festering in scientific illiteracy.  Ultimately, most prehistoric Humans do not receive an ethnic designator like 'Cro-Magnon', simply because of the lack of fossil evidence. For example, we've found the remains of the Altamura man, but was he a Neanderthal, part of an ethnicity with Neanderthal-like traits, or a hybrid? Cro-Magnon, on the other hand, is extensively documented in the fossil record.  Africa was far too diverse, even in the Pleistocene, to have its own morphological clade.   Why can't the first HSS Micronesians have their own name?   They would be grouped under the Indonesian & Australian clade, but regardless, we do have a name for them: prehistoric Micronesians. See, Cro-Magnon represents a distinct ethnic continuity as part of the Aurignacian culture, a brief window into life 45,000 years ago. In contrast, Micronesians didn't emerge as a distinct group until roughly 4,000 years ago, and would have emerged from the ""Sundalander"" clade.   There is something white centric here.   No, there's not. Just because the Cro-Magnon is better represented in the fossil record than any other group of any other clade does not mean it is part of a white supremacist position."

It was a combination of a pattern of high-profile brigades, driving a user to suicide, and the mods of the subreddit doxxing Imgur staff in the sidebar.   While admins pretty much said this minus the details (for the sake of the victims), fphaters twisted it into a ""free speech"" issue:   We will ban subreddits that allow their communities to use the subreddit as a platform to harass individuals when moderators don’t take action. We’re banning behavior, not ideas.   When people say that reddit does not allow fat shaming, it is supporting the fphate/""censorship"" narrative. It also ignores the fact that 4 other subreddits were also banned, 3 of them containing slurs in their names, all of them fond of sending harassing brigades.  reddit was, is, and still intends to be a ""free speech"" site. The only speech it is not only disallowing but aggressively pursuing is what it considers ""spam"". The entire technological framework is based on this premise; if you moderate a subreddit, you'll notice there are two buttons that will remove a post, labeled ""remove"" and ""spam"".   If you're going to make a comparison, it's that reddit is totally okay with white supremacists, but not a shoe salesman (unless they buy an ad campaign)."

As for the 'legacy' characters, they had no issue casting /Ben Kingsly in a role that was written as an Asia person.  You are only constrained by legacy characters when you choose to be strained by them.  The show Elementary rejected both gender and race categories when casting Watson.  And the Marvel films stray far enough away from the original characters in the films that maintaining the original skin colour of a white character isn't really important at all.  I mean, they had a guy who is 6'1 play Wolverine, who is supposed to be like 5'4 or something.    But yes, Blade... good call.  I forgot about that one.

Aye, the name, but not the thing; all the powers of the earth cannot abolish that. God only can do it when he repeals the fiat, “the poor ye always have with you;” for the man who lives by daily labor, and scarcely lives at that, and who has to put out his labor in the market, and take the best he can get for it; in short, your whole hireling class of manual laborers and “operatives,” as you call them, are essentially slaves. The difference between us is, that our slaves are hired for life and well compensated; there is no starvation, no begging, no want of employment among our people, and not too much employment either. Yours are hired by the day, not care for, and scantily compensated, which may be proved in the most painful manner, at any hour in any street of your large towns. Why, you meet more beggars in one day, in any single street of the city of New York, than you would meet in a lifetime in the whole South. We do not think that whites should be slaves either by law or necessity. Our slaves are black, of another and inferior race. The status in which we have placed them is an elevation. They are elevated from the condition in which God first created them, by being made our slaves. None of that race on the whole face of the globe can be compared with the slaves of the South. They are happy, content, unaspiring, and utterly incapable, from intellectual weakness, ever to give us any trouble by their aspirations. Yours are white, of your own race; you are brothers of one blood. They are your equals in natural endowment of intellect, and they feel galled by their degradation."

Once that was accomplished, the United States abandoned black people. The War Nerd argues that the United States should have executed certain Confederates in order to help prevent this. I'm skeptical it would have but it certainly would have sent a message.  I'd also like to draw attention to Isabel Wilkerson's book about the Great Migration, The Warmth of Other Suns.

I might suggest that the problems of overcoming denial based on self interest and unawareness of other viewpoints is being studied by scientist active in overcoming global warming denial.  I suggest the same tactics and research would apply to white guy denial.  I tried it out in a discussion thread on altenet and got no response which is probably the closest people in most discussions get to saying their minds have been changed. Here's the ""how to overcome denial"" research link. . .  http://phys.org/news/2015-06-countering-science-denial.html  if you like the phys.org link. there's a much more detailed multipart course on youtube for how to overcome science denial.  Once again, most of the research, strategies and success can be re-purposed for overcome racism denial. the series is pretty long and detailed so I'd start with the phys org link first and watch the video on the physorg site to see if it's what you want more of before diving into the longer youtube 5 week series.    https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmxzubbVw6jXA7Ak08StYug.  I might suggest that what black people dealing with white male racism denial could achieve much success by creating a ""countering racism denial"" youtube series.    The whole series is mostly focused on overcoming denial, it's causes, etc and just used global warming as a good example to apply the generalized denial research as a case study.  So if some enterprising black person wanted to make another case study on ""overcoming racism denial"" that would be easy to do and could even repurpose many of the info-graphics and follow the outline on a point by point basis by just changing the words ""global warming""  to ""racism"".   White people get a lot of advantages by promoting the white viewpoint in lots of subtle ways like using an issue that's most important to white people like global warming as an example so people interested in the science of denial countering get coincidentally exposed to information on global warming.  Black people can do the same so people interested in the science of denial countering get coincidentally exposed to information on racism.   ps.

The same sound is both a descriptor of a frowned upon activity and a way of describing the socially perceived outward appearance of a person. A ""black"" label, given to a people, from a very broad geographic region, by their oppressors and persecutors.  Socially speaking, the interpretation of the homophone being negative in one context allows for the opportunity for the other to feel negative, if only in some small way, to some group. This especially can be the case in there is a lack of context in a spoken word situation. ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.""  My point isn't necessarily to abolish these terms from usage — knowing history is important — but for people to be aware of the potential.  In short, why does the mail need to be black?

I'm speculating a bit here, but in my experience (I spent about 15 years in SC and still go back occasionally -- my parents are there) at least some women in the south do sports as a means of catering to men, so your doing sports might constitute a threat to them.

racism,3aiilo,TheEssexian,2,Sun Jun 21 10:59:45 2015 UTC,"I agree with the sentiment behind this article in that the Republicans are always playing dumb.  They pretend they don't know how these things happen, when they are the ones who insist on making guns so accessible. They pretend like a police shooting wasn't racially motivated when people of colour are systemically targeted and vilified in police culture.    That said, I think some of these things were taken out of context, and some of them are dependent on timing.  Asking 'why somebody would do this' isn't so much about 'because they are hateful racists', but more of a question as to why they think killing is alright, or why they think their motives are justified.  Asking a question like that doesn't mean they aren't conceding that it is about race.  I'm not sure when Jeb's comments were made (Jeb is an idiot in my book).  If somebody asked me at 10:00pm the day of the shooting if it was about race, I'd say: ""I don't know."" because at that time I hadn't had time to read about it.  If you asked me at 12:00, I'd give a very firm and insistent yes.  When was Jeb questioned?  What did he know by that time?  I dunno...  Regardless of such context, though, the Republican party has made it pretty clear that it supports and encourages racial profiling, and that they are apologists for police brutality and torture, most especially when it is carried out against people of colour, and that they are invested in denying the impact that prejudice based on perceived race has in America.

The reason this is important is because sometimesbwe vote Democrat and don't realize we're voting for a Conservative Democrat or Blue Dog Democrat which are mostly Southern. Theres more history to that but I'll stop there.  The reason Conservatives don't want to admit to racism is because they've always hidden in plain sight. The point is to stay hidden. They've created and carried out policies in variousvwaysvto demonize and harm minorities without us being able to peg any one individual.   So, we have to do a better job of deciphering the racists behind their code and policy. Fox News is great at using code. Then you have racists like NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton and PBA Pres.

My friends and I speak in a similar way with each other, but we do it ironically.  If, for example, one of my friends was referring to a Spanish friend as a 'Mexican' or saying he spoke 'Mexican', or alternately if Sikh or Chaldean were referred to as a Muslim, in the context of how my friends speak, it would be a ironic lampoon that is meant to mock the way in which xenophobic cultures/societies conflate drastically different cultures.    But I don't know your friends, so I can't assume that is their intent.  They may be quite literally saying that there isn't a difference between Mexicans and Spaniards.  In which case, it is quite ignorant.    If you are offended, and you've expressed this to your friends, and they continue doing it, my guess is they aren't friends, and they are likely prejudicial."
racism,3ahxxu,TheEssexian,10,Sat Jun 20 11:47:59 2015 UTC,Ironic racism is racism.
racism,3ahxxu,anansi73,0,Sat Jun 20 12:35:20 2015 UTC,"We can agree to disagree.   If that is your view, then everybody is racist, and the term has no meaning.  My view is that I've seen the likes of Stephen Colbert and Louis C.K. effectively challenge prejudices rooted in perceived race by ironically engaging in rhetoric that would be deemed racist in a literal context, and they have both been accused of racism for it.  Mocking racism, though, isn't racism.  Calling somebody who is mocking racism racist shows a complete lack of understanding of the term, and in some instances a lack of understanding of how irony and humour function.  If a diverse group of friends have negotiated a dialogue with each other in which they defuse the social tension of race constructs by mocking them in a way that all the friends are comfortable with, that is not racism.   To call is such is reactionary.    Respectfully."

racism,3ahxxu,TheEssexian,2,Sat Jun 20 22:37:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure where I see an argument there.  Frankly, all I see is rhetoric with an OVERT bias based on skin colour.    You have presumed  first that I was talking about white people, and secondly that such people are engaging in privilege, and thirdly that they were 'throwing around disparaging terms in a racialized way', and fourthly to show that they are over 'racism'.  None of those were apart of what I was saying.  Your singling out of 'white' people in particular infers that this is ok when people of colour do it, so if an Asian person makes fun of 'white people food', or a person of African descent and a person of Spanish descent, or an aboriginal person engage in such word play, is that not also a part of racism?  You frame your argument as though it only applies to white people and white supremacy.  To be specific to my situation, I have a Chaldean friend, an Asian friend, and a friend who is bi-racial (his mother is white and his father is Black).  My bi-racial friend makes cracks about my Chaldean friend being a member of a sleeper cell.  Out of context this sounds offensive, but he says this ironically in specific context.  When my Chaldean friend gets stuck at the border, my bi-racial friend will say 'Oh, did they figure out you are a member of a sleeper cell?'  This is meant to mock the practice of racial profiling, not to validate it. Likewise, my Asian friend has a practice of complaining about white people and mocking white culture and white cuisine.  Being white, one might assume that I would take offense to this, but I know that she says it in an ironic way to challenge the lack of diversity in our area.  So, are these behaviours then a part of 'racism'?  Is a native born bi-racial person not in a position of privilege compared to a landed immigrant from the Middle East who could conceivably have his citizenship revoked?  Would this not, by your definition, be racism?  I would say obviously not.  It is done ironically.  One might argue it is different because it is people of colour, but if you create a different set of rules for people of different colours... well... there is a slipper slope.  I don't engage in such things myself because I don't want to overstep boundaries, but in certain context, this ironic of such rhetoric is way for people to show support for each other.    As for your argument, am I to assume then that you believe Stephen Colbert and Louis C.K. are white supremacists and racist?  Because that certainly seems to be what you are inferring.  And if your rule applies to equally to people of all colour, would not then practically everybody be engaging in racism?  And if it does not apply to people of all colour, then does not your argument have an overt prejudiced based on perceived race?  The rhetoric you use sounds compelling, but it has no substance and fails to account for the meaning of irony, and how interpersonal relationships are formed, and the conversations and context shared between people who share intimate relationships/friendships.  You and I seem to be speaking about two completely different things.  You are describing much what the OP is describing, in which case I agree with you.  I, however, was describing an instance which I am familiar with that describes a manner in which friends navigate a culture and society that still very much engages in prejudice based on skin colour, and how friends mutually find a way to diffuse the tensions of that is linked with that.  I've yet to meet a white supremacist that engages in irony in the way I am describing, so to suggest that such a use of irony is 'an artifact of white supremacy' is extremely misleading.  Thank you for sharing your thoughts.  I share mine respectfully, but yours seem to be rather accusatory to be perfectly frank, and  I don't wish this conversation to devolve into charges or racism and white supremacy, so though I will gladly read any further comments you have, will give you the last word on the matter and will respond no further."

racism,3a2vgn,svaachkuet,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:15:26 2015 UTC,"a lot of students who challenge their professors during lecture have no fucking clue what they're talking about. it takes a certain type of personality and upbringing to be willing to contest a professor's comments in front of the entire class. (i remember during my undergrad years when a certain student in my major who was in all of my classes would always hijack the lecture and ask a bunch of questions pertaining to his own esoteric interests. critical thinking? more like acting like a brown noser and wasting everybody else's time. save those questions and comments for after class!)  the issue is that large classes in conventional lecture halls don't always provide the best atmosphere to encourage the quiet students to participate and ask the really good questions. we deal with this issue all the time in the humanities and social sciences. running class differently often helps. if students have low expectations of their conduct during class time, then it's really the shortcomings of the instructor and his/her course's structure, not the endemic culture of being a student. my suspicion is that the OP has never studied in a discipline where strong pedagogical skills were valued as highly as the professor's level of knowledge in his/her area, and so OP has never really witnessed ""asian students"" excel during class (in terms of his/her bullshit criteria). also, there is no shortage of students outside of asia who resist thinking critically and speaking up in class.

I'd respect a POC saying that more much more, as there is an aspect of dating someone who you know will understand your experience as a minority.  Some white people may, I'd like to think I do for my black fiancée to the extent I can, but that took lots of learning and seven years, and me having to consciously work at having an open mind.  If a white person didn't want to date minorities you're probably just a racist.  I also find a big difference between ""never will"" and ""generally don't because it's very likely they won't agree or understand with many things"".  Shit, at this point, if I became single again as a white guy, I'd probably largely avoid white women just because selecting any given white person at random it's far less likely they share my strongly held views about race and racism - why bother filtering through tons of people who probably will just infuriate me - I doubt there are many POC that I'd start dating and then realize ""oh this person doesn't believe in institutional racism, because they've never felt or seen it first hand"", if that makes sense.  I think that largely applies to some other political views - I suspect the average masters educated black women may be a bit more liberal than the average white person with a masters.  I'd like to think I'm not an equivalent white dude but I couldn't fault a black women for not wanting to deal with filtering through all the shitty white guys out there, cuz on the whole as a demographic were honestly pretty shit, and IMO the onus is on us individually to show we're not."

Our preferences, attractions, even fetishes, are shaped by our growing environment and how our society exposes us to people and races. Its not a coincidence that light skin has continuously been seen as a sign of beauty in many countries effected by white colonialism (Check out The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison). People, including PoC, have internalized the idea that pale skin is attractive. You very rarely see dark skinned PoC on tv, for example.  In addition, things like attraction to weight changes too. In the past, people were attracted to fatter women because it was a sign of wealth. Now, the opposite is true, as being skinny, and able to afford to eat less, is seen as a sign of wealth. Neither of these attractions are inborn, but they're shaped by the culture of the time, and we should try to be aware of that and self-critical."

I am Cuban American, middle class... I don't have much in common with people who were born and raised in the project, or people born with a silver spoon. Likewise, because my family are immigrants, I don't have a ton in common with people whose families have been in the US for several generations... so I have tended to date people who were raised similarly to me, and I am married to a first generation Mexican American man... and even between us there are major differences in how we were raised and how we/our families look. He's very dark complected, I'm blonde haired and blue eyed and have pale skin... but we have had similar cultural dynamics and family dynamics and particularly language that has brought commonality in our relationship.

Immigrants generally come to America with the idea to improve themselves, family and have more stability and less stress in their lives. Of course they receive hate and prejudice too but they still have semblance of their home country's culture whether or not they want to. Slaves didn't choose to come America. Add on racism, segregation, and prejudice for hundreds of years. No true country of origin that can be identified with and then being generalized as black or urban culture. The motivations between ignored black Americans and first and second generation immigrants is not the same. Comparing them is narrow minded especially because a lot of Black Americans are just as ""American"" as white Americans in most cases."

racism,3964x6,LIFTSHIT,25,Tue Jun 9 15:09:57 2015 UTC,"This is often an expression of ""white fragility."" Overwhelmingly, white people in North America live in an environment that effectively isolates them from racial stress. White people are used to being racially comfortable, and as a result are excessively sensitive to racial stress when it presents itself- often initiating a highly defensive response.  Now that racial inequality and latent racism are becoming more prevalent as topics of discussion, and people of color are becoming increasingly free to make their voices heard, more and more white people are having their understanding of race challenged. This presents a stress that they have been privileged to live without so they have no learned mental endurance to deal with the concept.  Having one's racial understanding challenged is hard, no doubt. I have, in the past, noticed or been told that I was being racist or racially insensitive, and that stung, but the fact was that it was true. The only thing I could do was examine myself more closely and try to change those behaviors and beliefs. Many people, though, at being told they're being racist, take it as a personal affront- ""Racists are bad people, and I'm not a bad person, so I cannot be racist."""

Since a lot of people have been sharing articles on what happened in McKinney (a bulk of us are all friends with each other in FB and interact on each other's statuses/pages), there have been several discussions going on. This is the second time someone had told a particular woman that she needed to read more about the history of race in this country and understand what white privilege is. So she makes a post in our main group, FREAKING OUT about how in all her life, she's never been called a racist and now it's happened twice in our group, etc. (No one outright called her racist; they told her she needed to educate herself.) She lives in a very-very-very-white northeastern state.   People get REALLY offended when someone insinuates they're racist. I think it's one of those words that has such a negative connotation (because duh) that people automatically are like ""Nope, I'm not that horrible word. That's offensive.""

It irks me in anime dubs when Japanese words are mispronounced, and while English-speaking ethnically Japanese people aren't the only ones who could remedy this, their cultural background makes them more likely than others to pronounce those words correctly.  And even when culture is not pertinent to the role, it's nice when PoC voice actors are given opportunities to represent characters who look like them, e.g. Russell in Up was voiced by a Japanese-American boy, Lana on Archer is voiced by Aisha Tyler, etc. I try to make note of when this happens as it increases my respect for the studio."

The company was required to sign a five-year agreement to introduce ""effective nondiscrimination policies and procedures."" The terms included new equal opportunity training; the creation of a new system to log, investigate, and resolve complaints of discrimination; and the publicizing of its non-discrimination policies. They were required to hire an outside auditor to ensure compliance with the terms of the settlement.[80]  In 2006, Cracker Barrel paid a $2 million settlement to end a lawsuit alleging race and sexual harassment at three Illinois restaurants.[81][82] Cracker Barrel stores subsequently began displaying a sign in the front foyer explaining the company's non-discrimination policy,[79] and added to its website and menu the policy and details on how to make a complaint.[83]  Since the early 2000s, Cracker Barrel has provided training and resources to minority employees, to improve its image on diversity. These efforts involved outreach to minority employees, along with testing a training plan to help employees whose first language is Spanish to learn English.[52] As of 2002, minorities made up 23 percent of the company's employees, including over 11 percent of its management and executives.[53]  Cracker Barrel is on the Corporate Advisory Board for the Texas Conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP),[84] and is a corporate sponsor of the NAACP Leadership 500 Summit, where three of its officials were moderators and panelists in May 2011.[85] The company has been praised for its gender diversity, particularly on its board of directors, which includes three women out of eleven total board members.[86] Its chief executive officer (CEO), Sandra Cochran, is the second woman in Tennessee to hold that office in a publicly-traded company.[86]*"

racism,37yeth,Zhuangzifreak,1 point,Sun May 31 13:19:44 2015 UTC,"It's an important topic, i.e. this part:   You see, when you kill ten million Africans, you aren’t called ‘Hitler’. That is, your name doesn’t come to symbolize the living incarnation of evil. Your name and your picture don’t produce fear, hatred, and sorrow. Your victims aren’t talked about and your name isn’t remembered.   But parts of the article are very problematic, especially:   When we learn about Africa, we learn [..] about the HIV epidemic (but never its causes), [..]   Hinting at the ""Aids Conspiracy""?   Nor do we learn about what the United States has done in Iraq and Afghanistan, potentially killing in upwards of 5-7 million people from bombs, sanctions, disease and starvation.   Absurdly high number of casualties in Iraq / Afghanistan, to be solely attributed to the US. Stating such controversial numbers will only help people to ignore the important parts of the article and allow easy derailing.   Making overtly racist remarks is (sometimes) frowned upon in polite society, but it’s quite fine not to talk about genocides in Africa perpetrated by European capitalist monarchs. [..] And since it isn’t talked about, what capitalism did to Africa, all the privileges that rich white people gained from the Congolese genocide are hidden.   Attributing colonialism and genocide to ""capitalism"" ignores that both were also committed by anti-capitalist ideologies. It is counter-productive to the understanding of colonialism, racism and genocide to only look at instances which can be attributed to ""capitalism""."

racism,36lhw1,ReligiousFreedomDude,0,Wed May 20 07:09:51 2015 UTC,"Although I will be the first to disagree with how police handled everything in Ferguson, it should be noted that in that instance they were expecting town wide civil unrest, demonstrations, and ultimately protestors coming from distances to exercise their right.  The bikers were definitely of a decent number, but I don't think it could have become a full on race riot if the police never came.  They still should not be running around ferguson doing shit like that, I just thought I would make the distinction"
racism,36lhw1,dafda72,2,Wed May 20 23:07:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not even sure what distinction you're trying to make here. It seems like you're trying to make a distinction between the police response in Waco and in Ferguson (which wasn't the point of the article) but I may be misinterpreting your post.   The bikers were definitely of a decent number, but I don't think it could have become a full on race riot if the police never came   We have 9 people dead and 18 injured and 190 arrested from a single incident on a single day that the police reportedly knew could happen. It could have been worse if the police never came. Moreover, we know that the police believes that gang members would converge on Waco to further escalate the incident. Gang members...  On the other hand we have around 6 days of rioting and over 100 days of peaceful protests with varying levels of police presence (including multiple times when they weren't there). So if the police in Ferguson can be antsy about ""wide civil unrest, demonstrations, and ultimately protestors coming from distances to exercise their right"" when it's regular civilians, why wouldn't they be anxious about gangs converging on a location after an episode of gang violence? A location where they already found hundreds of weapons?  Also, ""race riot""?"
racism,36lhw1,Intrinsic_Factors,0,Thu May 21 07:37:04 2015 UTC,"Hate me, downvote me, do as you like, but as a matter of logistical concern they are totally different things. If you were a police chief, even a good one were there such a thing, you would be treating each of these situations very differently. Civilians protestors for sure they were, but numbered in the 100's if not 1000's in ferguson. Tensions were running high (it never got violent? Seriously? It went to shit at least twice and rightfully so). In addition, the media frenzy that was whipped up made the whole situation a powder keg, once again rightfully so. Millions of dollars of damage was done to businesses and homes in ferguson. As for Waco, 180, fuck it 500 bikers killing each still would not warrant the same response, regardless if the police were equipped the same as they were in ferguson. It was a one and done. Likewise, even if the police were as lax as they were in Waco at ferguson there would be a need for greater presence, for a more prolonged period of time. I apologize for saying race riot, but if you can't at least admit ferguson was infinitely more politically( in terms of police being armed with the military's old toys, civil forfeiture, and a rash of other anti police sentiment brewing in various places here) and racially motivated than Waco, which is probably about turf to sell meth and guns and old grads of clown college that know the drill, perhaps you aren't thinking this through clearly. I would virtually guarantee that at least one of those biker gang members have dealt with the Waco police department before. As for distinctions, I am speaking from a dispassionate, logistical standpoint.  As such, no amount of wishing is going to make this meme more effective for the same reasons I've listed. Just the way it is, it's comparing apples and oranges. The cops here are fucked. Agreed. None of what happened is right in either scenario is right, agreed. All the same, you can believe what you want, and I would gladly defend your right to do so. I just hate to break it to you, as much as I wish there were there is not some uniform super racist police conspiracy. Two very different states. Probably two very different police departments. Without question in my opinion ferguson escalated due to the police using an excessive force, and old military equipment. Maybe someone in Waco was smart enough not to roll up on 180 armed bikers in assault vans pointing guns at everyone because that is how you get armed people to defend themselves. Maybe they are finally starting to smarten up, and not repeat the mistakes in ferguson, but I doubt it."

It went to shit at least twice and rightfully so).   I specifically mentioned the 6 days of rioting. And this was over the course of 4-5 months of protesting covering the time between Mike Brown's death and the protests after the non-indictment, by the way.   As for Waco, 180, fuck it 500 bikers killing each still would not warrant the same response, regardless if the police were equipped the same as they were in ferguson.   This is where you and I disagree. First, this incident was created by the interactions of gangs. Criminals. Secondly, they were armed and shooting. Third, the inciting incident was violence. Fourth, the bikers also numbered in the 100s. The protestors were not criminals or otherwise known to be violent or dangerous.    It was a one and done.   The police did not believe it would be, as evidenced by both their warnings of bikers coming to the area and the way they shut down the area long after the primary incident was under control.   The laxity in the police response does not correlate with the inciting event, the use of weapons and violence, the number of people involved, the type of people involved (armed criminals), or what the officers were worried about happening.   blah blah strawmen argument here that doesn't correspond with what I said   Not really worth responding to   Probably two very different police departments.

Institutional racism does exist, but the larger scope of the problem right now is the police mentality of us vs. them, which includes all races, and subsequently diminishes the quality of life of Americans a a whole. Once again, believe what you want, ferguson is not Waco, and the police response to the bikers is not more pleasant because of race in my opinion. I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, but that seems to be the point you are arguing and I cannot see the logic in that as it is.  Edit: still apples and oranges.

White privilege is not just about having access to shampoos and bandaids that are designed for you - although that is part of it. It's about being able to walk down the street and not be carded by police because of the colour of your skin. It's about meeting new people and not being asked ""Where are you from? No, but where are you REALLY from?"" White privilege is about being the ""neutral"" race, the default race, and the race that doesn't have to acknowledge that there are race-based inequalities and injustices that occur in our societies daily, because they don't affect white people.  It's a pretty weak that this criticism of white privilege hinges on opposing one source that happened to use some trivial examples. Try diversifying your sources a little.

racism,35urin,sapiophile,1 point,Wed May 13 18:01:54 2015 UTC,IMHO much of the racial disparity is driven by the extortive policies of asset forfeiture.  I discussed this recently with defense lawyer friend and he agreed.  In many departments the budgets are very dependent on seized assets.  While quotas are illegal telling officers that if they do not seize enough assets officers will be laid off and over time will be cut is not.  In some municipalities rank and file officers receive neatly 50% of their pay in overtime.    This affects race in the following way.  If a cop seizes a BMW from a white teenager from an affluent family for weed the family will higher a lawyer and fight the charge and the seizure.  If they arrest a black teenager with the same amount of weed and seize his car the family has not the assets to fight the seizure.  In addition the car's value may no be enough to justify he legal bill to attempt to fight the seizure.  The police are then free to auction off he car and add the proceeds to the police budget.

racism,35swxo,femmefatale33,5,Wed May 13 06:07:45 2015 UTC,"You know whats even worse?  The word ""racist"" is seen as an offensive remark. When you call someone out for being a racist they act as offended as a minority would be to chink, paki or nigger. People get so fucking defensive and refuse to accept that just because you arent in a Klan uniform you can still hold racist views.  ""Playing the race card"" is the biggest load of shit and it boils my blood when people use it to discredit a minorities suggestion that racism is in play.  I think white people (not all, and the fact i have to say ""not all"" pissed me off) lack an enormous amount of insight in what its like to be an ethnic minority. ""B-B-BUT MINORITIES CAN BE RACIST TOO!"". Of course they can but calling someone a cracker doesnt hurt a white person nearly as much as the previously mentioned terms imo. Im mixed race, asian and white. Ive lived in both of my ""home"" countries and received racist comment from both sides. When i was insulted for being white it didnt hurt me, we live in a white mans world, the movies, tv, music all these people listened to was from white people. When i was called a chink it hurt, because it reminds you of how far society has to come, how you will never be accepted in the ""white world"", how people every day are angry and hate you for absolutely no reason other than your skin. Maybe im biased.  When it comes to the internet, reddit is one of the worst offenders.   To answer your question. Yes it makes me angrier than anything else. I may not share the same experiences as other minorities but i can fully empathize with the struggle to a certain degree and try to highlight problems with racism to my friends as much as i can.

racism,35swxo,LIFTSHIT,6,Wed May 13 21:11:40 2015 UTC,"When people say ""everyone is a little racist"" you begin to get a feeling that people don't consider it as serious as other groups. White kids get mad they can't say nigga/nigger but completely ignoring or forgetting where the word comes from (no one should say this word imo). White people want to celebrate their skin color and combine any predominantly white culture (German, French, etc) to be white power because they see black pride and have never associated that perhaps segregation and exclusion built that pride up. It was never about skin color until Europeans decided as much. Questions about why Africans are violent or do so poorly never care for an answer because it leads back to colonialism, slavery, and racism. Africa was sucked of its independence long ago and blacks were never doing well in America because they were never really allowed to until somewhat recently and yet there is still an invisible wall. No one needs to be blamed and no one should apologize but if everyone could just take a walk in each other's shoes and not ignore someone with a different opinion we all could make strides.

Even on a good day, it's a disturbing concept to wrap one's head around, and if your first exposure to it is by someone getting the short end of it, and as she explains that throughout your entire life, your gain has been her loss, it can be pretty hard to not get defensive about it. It'd be so much easier to deny the whole thing and blame minorities for playing the victim card to account for their laziness.  I don't think any of this is new. People have claimed to not be racist for a long time. I wouldn't be surprised if there were slave owners who'd have been offended by the label.

If you accept that it's a real thing, then you have to accept that you may well deserve less than you got. You may have to admit that the game is rigged and your score is not entirely a reflection of your abilities.

racism,35swxo,cyanydeez,2,Wed May 13 20:29:51 2015 UTC,"Stereotypes will never be eradicated, and the language of racism will always persist.  There's some deep connection between people's self identity and the society they grew up in, and the power/powerlessness that they feel.  In the US, there's a long history ethnic stereotyping towards immigrants, which seems to be grafted onto black people perpetually, as if every generation of black culture is some how an immigrant.  But if you look around the world, there's not a single culture that is accepting of immigrants, and there's many asian cultures that out-and-out fear black people.  We're at a point where society Wants to be racially unbiased, but it still Wants to be socially pure, and the baser instincts in the psychology of the mind is not going to adapt as quickly as we want it to.  I'm unsure how we overcome this because what racism is, is a instinctual need to stereotype and self identify at the same time. The self identity is not just ""I am white"" or ""I am X,"" it is ""I am white not black,"" or ""I am X, not Y"". This is why we see some of the quasi-sociological push to eradicate normative polarities, but I am unsure that the evolutionary adaptations that the human cognition has proceeded through actually allows the standard psychological condition to accept statements of self identity that arn't tied to a ""us"" vs ""them"" concept.  And the subtly we see in some of the backlash, is that the majority wants to be accepting, but only if you disregard their ""them"" and reorganize yourself so they can say ""us.""  I would say that if we continue long enough down this road, there will be enough people that will have a self-identity which isn't tied to their race between those who do, that this type of racism will disappear, but the internet and the media arn't going to let stereotypes die, which is what reinforces so many people's self identity.  tl;dr: We're social creatures, and thus our identity is tied to those who surround us. And our identity is not purely ""I am"" but ""I am and I am not"""
racism,35swxo,SolidRambo,2,Wed May 13 16:27:22 2015 UTC,"It's.. frustrating. I can't think of any other word to describe it. The way I perceive it, the ""subtle"" or ""colorblind"" racism we see today is a  mixture of a few things.  1.) The way racism is taught a lot of the time. Every fictional depiction of a bigot is always an objectively evil, ""Look at how far we've come"" caricature. The standard person looks at depictions of men beating and raping women and thinks ""Good God, I would never hit my wife"", who looks at those who murdered Matthew Shepard and thinks ""Wow, those guys are monsters"", and who looks at the KKK and thinks ""My, what awful people."" Then, they decide those are what sexists, homophobes, and racists are and determines that there is no possible way they could be a bigot.  They'll say a woman shouldn't dress like that if they don't want to be raped.  They'll say homosexuals would get a lot farther if they stopped with gay pride parades and acted ""normal.""  They'll say African Americans should start picking themselves up, move on, and stop requesting handouts.  But as long as they feel they're far away from the media depictions of caricature bigots, they'll feel complacent.  2.) An ignorance of history and the failure to walk in somebody elses' shoes. There is always somebody there to offer a ""birds eye"" view of what an entire group of being should be doing or whatever, completely removed from the the cumulative effects of racial segregation, oppression and isolation, as well as how these effects are played out in the cultural and social dimensions. Instead, it's just here's is what -I- would do hypothetical that exists in vacuum removed from past and present socio-legal & economic forces.  It's a very difficult thing to address, because not only do people seemingly have difficulty placing themselves realistically in somebody elses' place, the media has a tendency to show the lowest common denominator, leading people to uncritically judge an entire group by what they're viewing."

The problem in my opinion is that we use the label of these races to try and use as identifiers that make us different. Obviously to date the black story and the white story are different and there are differences that still exist. Its way easier said than done but the end of race labeling is the closest to the end of racism. These are our brothers and sisters. I don't care if you look like me. We are family. All colors. Stop looking at ""black"" people ""white"" people. No. These are our people my people your people. It is hard to make progress at creating a color blind society when people want to debate the fine details of how we are different."
racism,35swxo,Taylor219,2,Thu May 14 17:26:24 2015 UTC,"But ""colorblind"" racism is actually a form of racism. It has innocent intentions but at the end of the day it's a form of whitewashing. The fact is identity means a lot to many people, it's at the core of who we are, so there is nothing inherently wrong with labels. We are not a melting pot, we are a mixing bowl of people. The problem lies within society not doing an adequate enough job at teaching others to celebrate diversity instead of simply ignoring it. If we try to become blind to racial differences, ignorance and microagressions ensue. As a mixed person, I cringe when people say the future will just be all mixed people, thus creating a colorblind society. I don't want that. I want all the beautiful ethnic groups coexisting peacefully and respectfully. Cultures and ethnic groups are amazing to behold and we can all learn from each other's backgrounds once we learn to confront it."

HOW and WHY does anyone believe this nonsense? I have a feeling Fox News is largely to blame, along with other extremist-right web sources. Chuck Norris is even in on this conspiracy.  If only Fox News and other extreme right ""news"" organizations and websites knew the damage they're doing, and the monsters they're helping to create by selling fear.

racism,352gbr,goodgoodplus,6,Wed May 6 15:28:22 2015 UTC,"As Concordia professor Lorna Roth writes, “Film chemistry, photo lab procedures, video screen colour balancing practices, and digital cameras in general were originally developed with a global assumption of ‘Whiteness.’”  Until very recently, if you got a roll of film printed in a photo lab, it was very, very likely that the shots were calibrated against a photo of a caucasian woman wearing black and white on a grey background. It didn’t matter what color your skin was or what color your subjects’ skin was, or what anybody was wearing. No matter what the model’s name was, technicians called the woman in the card “Shirley” after Shirley Page, the first woman to pose for one. Once she was on that card, she was “Shirley,” and her skin set the tone.  ""She was the standard,"" photo technician Jersson Garcia told NPR, ""whenever we printed anything, we had to pull Shirley in. If Shirley looked good, everything else was OK. If Shirley didn't look so hot that day, we had to tweak something — something was wrong.""  Color processing is an complicated and delicate operation with a lot of variables -- the proportion of different chemicals in the developing solution, the timing of the different steps. Kodak distributed Shirley cards and the unexposed negatives of Shirley cards to photo labs as a mechanism of quality control. If the white dress looked yellow, or Shirley’s peach skin looked blue, or if her exquisite features were washed-out, the lab knew it had goofed up somewhere along the line.  Shirley showed up in other stages of photography, too. Photography studios and film production crews had Shirley cards while they fine-tuned their color filters and lighting. The models in these photos would hold black, white, or colored pieces of paper -- further datapoints as to whether the balance and exposure was set correctly. TV crews would often use live models, called “colour girls.” As former NBC camera man told Roth, the colour girl was always white. The same kind of calibration was done by camera manufacturers, too, when building cameras or setting their exposure presets.  As mentioned earlier, in film photography, color balance has a lot to do with the chemical composition of the film. For many decades, color film in the United States was calibrated to highlight Caucasian skin tones. This was the most fundamental problem. With an unusual degree of skill and attention, a photographer could compensate for the biases in most stages of production. But there was nothing they could do about the film’s color balance. When the famous New Wave filmmaker Jean Luc Godard was commissioned to make a film about Mozambique, he reportedly refused to use Kodachrome film -- the most popular color film at the time. He complained the film, developed for a predominantly white market, was “racist.”"

racism,34uo6m,miniflip,1 point,Tue May 5 00:08:03 2015 UTC,"White people aren't allowed to be actively against racism? What? Do people actually think this?   I don't really think that is what the essay is saying. I also think you're using a different definition of ""whiteness"" than the author. To me it seems like she's calling on ""whiteness"" as an idea or a state of mind, not a race or ethnicity. In this interpretation, to be white is to actively participate in white supremacy, by being unwilling (either passively or directly) to forfeit white privilege and power.   I definitely don't think the author is saying that it is impossible to have white skin, and to also be anti-racist. She explicitly mentions John Brown as a potential model for an anti-racist who was not non-white: someone who is willing to pick up arms for non-white people. That is, someone who actively draws onto themselves the state-sanctioned violence that is pointed at communities of color. I'm also thinking of this video as an example of what she might be talking about.    In any case, this point-- that whiteness is an idea or a state of mind, and that casting off whiteness (i.e., being anti-racist) amounts to making a serious effort to forfeit white privilege and not just talk about its existence-- doesn't originate here. Baldwin made similar claims, and there are others before him as well."

I am simply trying to convince other whites to wake the hell up and critically think about their prejudices, how they contribute to systemic oppression, and how to get past them.

racism,34uo6m,AdvancedToast,1 point,Tue May 5 00:24:08 2015 UTC,"Now, for one to claim whiteness, one also is invested in white supremacy. Whiteness itself is a political term that emerged among European white ethnics in the US. These European ethnics, many of them reviled, chose to cast their lot with whiteness rather than that with those who had been determined as non-white. In short, anyone who claims to be white, even a white anti-racist, is identifying with a history of European imperialism and racism transported and further developed into the US.  That is, whites cannot talk or just think through whiteness and structures of white supremacy. They must be committed to either picking up arms for other people (and only firing when the people tell them so), dying for other people, or just getting out of the way. In short, they must be willing to do what the people most affected and marginalized by a situation tell them to do.   /u/miniflip these quotations address your strawman points.

For example, if someone thinks all of the looters in Baltimore are warrantless thugs-- they would have a real heart to heart conversation with someone who looted, outlining the reasons they did it, and what situations led to that point.   The problems with this kind of outreach stuff, is that its terribly difficult to carry out on a large scale. A person can't go up to every racist, ignorant, ass hole and tell them that your life is meaningful and has had issues that they're overlooking when they pass judgement.  So I guess my answer would be... its very hard. It takes generations of education and learned values to rid a society like America of systematic racism.

My reply: I don't know what's more offensive to me: the fact that this comment currently has 3 upvotes, or that you made this comment, and also self-identify as a transnational feminist. And I'm not just talking about this comment-- your history clearly demonstrates your hang-up on Islam, which is ironic considering the tremendous amount of transnational feminist theory focused on Islam, and how the kinds of orientalist critiques you so often make of it interact with imperialism, neocolonialism, and racism: Jasbir Puar, Saba Mahmood, Inderpal Grewal, Chandra Mohanty, Sarah Ahmed-- these are all seminal figures in transnational and third world feminism who would abhor the sorts of statements and generalizations you're making about Islam. Are you familiar with any of their work?  What's perhaps more amazing is that you're even generalizing in the isolated context of this particular article, by using the words of one Mufti as representative of all of Islam. That's pretty fucking racist right there. If you'd been interested in looking beyond your bias and bigotry (which I know you aren't so clearly I'm wasting my breath), you might have found that Yeo Bee Yin's rape awareness campaign (the one that this article is about) is in collaboration not only with AWAM (All Women's Action Society) but also with SIS (Sisters in Islam), who released the following statement with regards to the campaign:  ""As a religion that truly respects women, the husband and wife relationship in Islam is built upon the foundations of love and mutual respect, as stated in the Al Quran’s Surah Al Ruum verse 21,..”  ""...Thus, statements that allow rape in a marriage are in direct opposition to the Al-Quran’s objective to maintain equality in the relationship between husband and wife, based on the spirit of love and compassion...""  So in essence, in order to support your worldview of what Islam is and what it isn't, you've emphasized the perspective of this Mufti and completely silenced the voices of SIS: how is that feminist?? What do you think SIS would have to say about your constant bigotry? How is your brand of ""transnational feminism"" helping these women?"

racism,34c5xt,shirleyyujest,14,Tue May 12 19:34:48 2015 UTC,"With all due respect, I think you're applying an unnecessarily rigid definition of race, when in reality it is a social construct that is subject to varying interpretations which interact with class, gender, and yes- religion.   For one, in the US at least, Islamophobia and anti-Arab racism go hand in hand. If you're Arab but not Muslim, Islamophobia certainly has the potential to fuck up your day. This is true even if you're not Arab, but visibly brown. And as a brown person who does not outwardly perform any sort of Muslim identity, trust me because I'm speaking from experience.  Secondly, since race is a social construct, an individual's racial identity is influenced heavily by how it interacts with other social constructs. As an example, the Boston bombers are/were ethnically Caucasian, but after the bombings their faces were ""browned"" on the covers of magazines. Islam is associated with brownness, and this association has real consequences for brown people and for Muslims. Let's also not forget the witch hunt that took place on Reddit following the bombings, in which a completely innocent brown man was accused publicly and nationally of being involved.   Here's another example: in the racial apartheid system of South Africa, Christian Lebanese people were seen as being at least one rung up on the racial hierarchy than Muslim Lebanese. The exact same ethnicity and even nationality, but the difference in religion was enough for Muslim Lebanese people to be perceived as an altogether different (and more colored) race.   Do you need more examples? Race is not some fixed entity that never changes, and Islamophobia makes life much more difficult for many South Asian and Arab Americans. This has everything to do with race."
racism,34c5xt,yellowmix,3,Tue May 12 20:43:04 2015 UTC,"I simply argue that people of a race can and have shown extreme prejudice towards Muslims of the same race, and as such we should still consider Islamaphobia inherently a discrimination against Muslims...   There is no reason why we should be intent on pigeonholing an axis of discrimination into one ""category"". That is not how oppression operates: it is intersectional. There are many white women who act sexist towards women of color; does that mean that sexism is not, inherently, a discrimination against women? /u/demmian's comment was also one of many. Scrolling trough his comment history reveals a pretty clear trend (e.g. ""Islam is a violent/evil ideology""), which parrots the kind of rhetoric that Europeans have used to racialize Muslims for centuries."

Islam is not a race. Islam has never been a race.   That's really a moot point considering the fact that Islamophobia is most often directed towards brown-skinned people. That's when it starts to verge towards racism. When you have people who are discriminated against and accused of being ""violent Muslims"" simply because of their skin color/ethnicity, then it becomes racist. You and I may understand that Islam is a religion that is practiced by people of all races/nationalities/etc, but most people engaging in hatred towards Muslims are directing that hate to people of a certain ethnicity, regardless of whether or not those people are actually Muslims."

racism,34c5xt,thebeautifulstruggle,5,Thu Apr 30 05:02:30 2015 UTC,"In America, Islam is so often conflated with brown people that it functions in the same ways as racism.

Not to mention Lebanese people, who may be Christian or Muslim or a number of faiths, who face what can only be described as oppression (think systematic deportation) because they are associated with Arabs. That Islamophobia is generally classed in analysis of racism goes all the way back to Orientalism in the 19th century. Islamophobia is just a new name for it.  Antisemitism in America falls under analysis of white supremacy, which is generally considered the domain of racism. Jewish people, however, are generally racially white, which makes things a little confusing. Keep in mind, however, that Italian people and Irish people were not considered white at one point in America. Whiteness is continually shifting, and it is an American thing.  Antisemitism in the rest of the world is generally racism as Jewish people are perceived to be a race. But you'd still need to look at the specific sociopolitical situation (e.g, Jewish people fleeing Spain to Argentina in the 16th century)."

racism,34c5xt,krustyarmor,9,Thu Apr 30 00:26:30 2015 UTC,"Absolutely incorrect. Islamaphobia is one of the current manners in which racism, specifically anti-brown racism, is obfuscated, produced, and directed. Islam has become a symbol of non-European, non-Christian, non-Whiteness. It's like saying Nazis targeting European Jews wasn't racist because Judaism is a religion and not a race. You're using a very simplistic model of race which forgoes ethnicity, culture, religion, language, and a whole bunch of other nuances and intersections and is only predominantly used in North America. Race can be constructed in a multitude of manners, one of the traditional markers of race being an individuals religion affiliation. Case in point the targeting of Jews by Nazis or how Spanish Conquistadors were allowed to enslave 'pagans' and 'heathens' in the New World  because they were not considered to have souls and thus not human, but those who converted to Christianity were to be considered as having fully human souls and not to be 'enslaved'. I understand and sympathize the desire to separate race and religion as an atheist to be able to be able criticize religion without being lumped into the category of racist.

It would be morally irresponsible for me to do that without, at the same time, condemning the contingent, intolerable conditions that exist in our society. These conditions are the things that cause individuals to feel that they have no other alternative than to engage in violent rebellions to get attention. And I must say tonight that a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the plight of the negro poor has worsened over the last twelve or fifteen years. It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice and humanity.   -The Other America   I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action""; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season.""

I've noticed that it's a trend in some parts of the multi-lingual States to consider it rude to speak in front of others (here, it would be the students) in a language they don't understand (Spanish).  For example, I work with multi-lingual people mainly from Asia and Europe (we're all middle-class, if it matters), and whenever they are speaking non-English and an English-only speaker enters the room, they switch to English.  Is this a prejudiced custom; should we ignore our own paranoia (presumably, that they're making fun of me) when people speak to each other in a language we don't understand and as a country, become accustomed to having multi-lingual chatter around us all the time?

Much of the work of academics who make a living writing about race, racism, and Blackness seem to either want to connect us to some mythical Africa or to only allow us an identity forged exclusively out of racism. I reject both.   implies that Appiah is one of those who either hold up the image of the ""mythical Africa"" on the one hand, or the ""identity forged exclusively out of racism"" on the other, which is in no way what he believes.  In fact, one pervasive theme throughout his work is the destruction of the ""monolithic, mythical Africa.""  So this piece really had nothing to add to the Appiah interview.

The article does a good job of explaining some of that.  The article mentions the Song of the South, which is locked away in the (True) Disney Vault. If you justify the Tiki Room as a historical technological achievement (as it is), with zero explanation about the racist elements, then why not Song of the South? Well, an attraction in a theme park is a lot less noticeable than a mass-market movie. Which explains why Mr. Frog's Wild Ride is still around (which I personally adore). I'm sure the moment Disney has to start explaining things, they'd take the path of least resistance.  There are a lot of problematic elements in several other attractions. They've glossed over certain elements in the Pirates of the Caribbean, It's a Small World has some questionable design choices in regards to representing people from around the world, though it's another historical attraction at this point.  I suppose Disney just offloads the responsibility of explaining these things to parents/guardians.

Selassie never confirmed nor denied his attachment to the religion, although land was granted to some Rastas in Ethiopia.   As far as white people belonging, its possible.  There are several sects, or ""Mansions"" in the Rasta faith.  Each Mansion has its own beliefs, rules and customs.  Most mansions are explicitly black, while a few (notably the ""Twelve Tribes of Israel"" Mansion) have no racial barriers.   Those few white people who are legitimate Rastas are very different from white kids who appropriate the ""Green, Gold, and Red,"" listen to Bob Marley, smoke weed and think that they're Rastas.

Black and Hispanic (which would include white Hispanics) have similar numbers as API.  I loathe the idea of ""Asian Privilege"" but Dash is right. There's a social barrier to entry and participating in the tech industry, a (sometimes healthy) skepticism of someone's technical skills and fit into tech culture, and Asian men generally don't seem to face the same amount of skepticism as women (partially because of sexism), and other POC (partially because of model minority), for a whole host of reasons.  The fact of the matter is, Asian men are in a position to open doors. It may seem weird that white men aren't being asked this, but white men have been asked since the dawn of computing. This article is telling Asian men that we are in a position to stop asking and just take it for all POC, once we let go of the model minority myth's teat.  The model minority myth is exactly what fuels the emasculation of the Asian man. The model minority myth says Asian men are almost as good as white men, perhaps even better at techie things, never as good in any other department.

racism,322w3z,5uperhorse,6,Fri Apr 10 08:38:15 2015 UTC,"I have found over the years that it is best to focus on a particular incident. So, like the Walter Scott murder. What led to his death is more or less indisputable even to the most rigid ""I don't see color"" idiot. You slowly extrapolate what might have made Walter Scott do something ""dumb"" (not dumb, but rather a reaction that has a basis in history) like run away from a cop. Why is facing a cop different for Scott than it is for you (white dude)? Why is there more fear, on both sides? When you hit the wall of ""white fragility"" you let things relax a moment, ask a gentle question or two if you can get away with it, and then let it go. Come back to the conversation over a different specific incident at a later time.   In my experience, it is the slow continuation of a conversation over months or years from someone they ""trust"" that leads to progress.   It requires gentle questioning (a feat of endurance if you ask me) and reasoning, but not getting angry. I think the most pointed question to ask is why it is so hard for them to believe the re-told experiences of people of color? Don't ask for answers, immediately, but do ask them to think about why they find it so hard to believe people when they tell about what it's like.  I just had to unfriend somebody on FB who was so nasty about the non-existence of white privilege it made me ill. There was no point to discussing something like that over FB. (I believe these things require the in-person, over beers or tea, sort of F2F.) However, what I do want to ask him in retrospect is why he is so invested in denying so many people's experience? Because at heart it is so patently unkind and disrespectful of people to flat out deny the existence of something people live every day. So what is the motive behind doing that? Where does it get you to declare that all these people are lying to you?  EDIT: I have seen people change their minds slowly over years. However, I also have seen backsliders who retreat to their comfortable white-only lives. What can I say.   EDIT 2: Also, if you ever have an opportunity to attend an anti-racism workshop that involves real conversation, do it! You will see some pretty disturbing contortions on the part of white people, to the point where you'll start to see the patterns. Watch the professional facilitator in charge. If they're good, you'll see how to break down those barriers in a much faster way. However, in the real world, I usually see people just run away from any kind of confrontation that can become so emotional.   I became ""local-famous"" as a white woman anti-racist activist. This meant that white people--well meaning people who truly wanted to learn but felt ignorant--would come and talk to me about race all the fucking time. (It actually became tedious for awhile there.) It can be quite educating, but after awhile you get a sense that this is what people of color in white environments must deal with all the time.

The weirdest thing for me is that I can see what they are doing so clearly,  but it is also obvious that they cannot see what they are doing at all.     My theory is that there is a crushing guilt and fear that arises if they acknowledge white privilege,  and it is so easy and comfortable to deny it,  so they take the later course...

And ""326 whites and only 123 blacks were killed by police in 2012,"" that would mean blacks account for 27% of police killings, more than double their presence in the general population.   edit: That is giving him the benefit of the doubt that those statistics are true and/or actually from a reputable non-biased collection and analysis of the data, which is probably unwise, since it is Bill we're dealing with here."

It's very possible your ""friend"" had some influence from people around him, do you know if his parents have ever been openly racist? Racism is a tough ideology to squish, but try and make him realize some things. Explain to him that it's hard for people to achieve great things if they're literally put in chains for 200 years straight. After those chains were finally removed, African-Americans had no existing prior family wealth to work with, and the cards were stacked against them.   When the cards are stacked against you in a society, you're far more likely to become impoverished. It's hard to become that famous scientist when people with both conscious and unconscious biases are slowing you down every step of the way. It's even harder when the school you need to go to in order to become a scientist doesn't accept blacks. So with all these issues, aside from literally being imprisoned for 250ish years, it's no wonder African Americans are more likely to be impoverished. And where poverty is, crime will grow.   Yes slavery is over, but it put Black people at a serious disadvantage. They didn't regain all those lost years being whipped in the fields. This added onto the fact that the establishment was discriminating against them meant that they have struggled and been far more hurt by poverty and crime in the meritocratic society we live in today.  Let me put it this way. If a sports team had no training for 250 years, and was generally distrusted by all the other teams, nobody would be surprised when that team had the least disciplined and successful players, and no one would be surprised when some players on that team gave up, since the cards were stacked against them and they had no hope of winning. The problem is, those issues still persist, and yet people ask themselves ""why aren't African-Americans wealthy and successful with low crime rates like the rest of us?"". Some see the past. But others draw false conclusions that African-Americans must be inherently unable to succeed in a society and have a low crime rate.  I know you might want to give up on your ""friend"", and you can at any moment. You don't owe him anything. But please, help the guy out. He thinks he's making perfectly valid arguments, and he needs someone to splash some water in his face and show him how absurd he sounds.

Calling out us white folk when we make pretty racist comments is something you should always do IF you feel comfortable doing it. Him responding with deflection and asking you to ""define racism' is a symptom of white privilege. It's not often that he sees it play out in his life, especially if the area is predominately white as you say it is. By calling him on his shit you forced him to come to terms with the fact that what he said was probably racist, and he now has the choice of taking what you said to heart, and hopefully being a little more thoughtful of what he's saying. Alternatively, he could play you off as being sensitive or w/e, and continue about his ignorant ways, but the fact that you said something at least means you confronted him with the fact that he's white.  That's not something white people like dealing with. It undermines the notions of meritocracy and post-racialism, (as if Ferguson, Trayvon, Louis Gates Jr. etc didn't already do that), which means their preciously held notions of the status quo aren't quite what they presumed them to be.  Pushing back in the face of racism isn't easy, but it's always the right thing to do, provided you can do it in safe fashion.   Anyway, not sure how well versed you are in academic theory, but there's a book by Beverly Tatum you might find interesting. For more thought out perspective from another white guy who I consider a hero, check out Tim Wise's blog  Finally, I've taken a lot of time in my struggle to be anti-racist, and I know that I have a long way to go.

Not that it matters, I've been the victim of persistent social (as opposed to institutional) racism growing up in a majority Mexican community.  You did the right thing. Setting boundaries and sticking to them is a condition of self-respect, and making sure they're reasonable is a condition of respect for others. Both of these are valuable positive traits for both yourself and your environment.  In this particular case, you were met with a case of stereotyping that crossed a boundary that I believe was reasonable for you to have. Your acquaintance's attempt to assert that his girlfriend's skin color and/or culture contributes to the ""up and down"" nature of their relationship has no foundation in fact. It's a negative personal opinion judging a person or group of people based on their race, so it's racist.  As to what you can do about it, I understand your frustration. One would hope that one wouldn't have to point out the obvious (in this case, that what your acquaintance said was racist, much less the definition of ""racism""), much less that one would be greeted with dismissive hostility when doing so.  The crux of my argument is going to be that you cannot control what other people do.  In this particular case, you can point out the fault in their behavior. You can try to reason with them. You can even go so far as to inform others of their behavior. Then it's their turn to react. They choose how they're going to take the information that you've given them, and react according to whatever suits their mental processes. In this case, it would appear as though your acquaintance has an issue with taking his own racist ideas seriously in regards to their affects on others. This is his problem, and trying to convince him otherwise seems to have put him in a defensive stance over it.  However, what you did was right and noble, insofar as informing somebody of their transgressions is right and noble. Hopefully, with time and experience, your acquaintance's views will change. You know them better than I do though, so you already have a lot more experience as to how they might progress, given their current attitudes and environment.  Wish you the best of luck, friend."

As for white people never understanding what it's like to be called names, made fun of and be discriminated against by people because of skin color.. I understand where you're coming from, but I respectfully disagree. I'm a white guy, but I was raised in a predominantly Mexican community growing up. I was called all sorts of things, most in a language I only understood after my Spanish-speaking friends educated me. I was constantly made fun of. I had people picking fights with me just because of my skin color. I was a straight-A kid when I got expelled for too many fights in middle school. My racist family tried to convince me ""that's just how Mexicans are"", but, luckily, I had already made some really good Mexican friends and didn't buy into it.  I've been there, thinking you're alone and powerless. You did what you could and it didn't work out. But everything moves forward, changes, gets better or worse.

For example, almost all of the Youtube commenters commend ""W Honky"" for speaking out calling him wise, saying he's a revolutionary, and glorifying him.   HOWEVER when a person of color (POC) talks about the same issues they are unacknowledged and not praised. ""DjMenniz,"" for instance, is the only commenter who states they have been saying the same things but go unrecognized. Most time, people of color (POCs) are demonized and labeled as an angry, irrational, and absurd. What we see here, essentially, is the superiority and supposed authority of white voices over voices of color- which is another form of racism.  Now I'm not saying I don't appreciate ""W Honky"" for speaking out. In fact, it's somewhat nice to see that there are white men out there who can stand in solidarity with the POC community. What I want to get at, though, is that it's important to realize who's speaking and why are they being listened to.   TL;DR: White men speaking about racism is valued more than people of color (POCs) speaking about racism."

A lot of people are realizing the implications of common things they say (Where are you really from?). Institutionalized racism is becoming more apparent to people.  As for your experience, I'm sorry to hear about it. Indeed, western society is not all it's romanticized up to be. I think young Americans/Brits are often perpetuating racism simply because it's all they know. They see what is acceptable and what isn't, and they stick with it. It's hard to show to someone they're being insensitive.   Finally, I think racism really comes from this innate distrust for those who look or act different. Humans in general have this subconscious or conscious distrust of anyone different because when our species was nothing more than warring tribes, it payed off to make assumptions. Now, we have to deal with that, and the institutions that have favored white people in western society. Majorities will form and create a status quo.

That might have been preceded by any of thefollowing: ""I get my coffee from fair trade farms! I pay my PoC nanny a decent salary! I have PoC friends! You can't take a joke!""  Why is it raising? My guess is that the systematic destruction of societal structures to protect everybody has also taken a toll in the education of people, and reactivated old hatreds, while at the same time evolving to attack in more insidious, subtle and damaging ways.  We have a population that has a political discourse that has been driven to the right, a population with a poor civic education, one that is is more segregated, and that has incredible wealth inequality. There are issues of class arising fast, and within that wave hide the old racist issues that are also making a comeback.

I want to point out that this is a major issue in Islam, and no right thinking (or left thinking) individual has any business writing moral blank cheques to Islam or muslims till this issue is addressed.  There are any number of muslim religious experts talking about things like how to beat your wife.  There is this horrible horrible custom called 'arabi kalyanam' that is being practices in Kerala (a state in India) which ruins lives of thousands of girls every year, many of them underage.  Acts such as these, if performed by a non-muslim will yield reactions in the strongest terms like child molesting, or rapes... but because they are performed by muslims, and they somehow have the protection of Islam they get away with it.  So while there may be concerns about muslim women, the bigger concern is the hypocrisy of all the defenders of Islam.  You are not helping by shutting down this discussion.  I am sure that if you get out of the way, the women who are stuck in Islam are praying on a daily basis for some saviours, since they are powerless to unite, and no muslim man is going to stand up for them, those women will be blessing any and every person who stands up to them.  It falls to  non muslims, both men and women to raise this issue.  The hypocrisy is that while systematic oppression of women in Islam is a topic that is taboo, the same is not afforded to the caste system in Hinduism... that is a free for all, and anyone and everyone seems want to end it.  It is not right to shift goalposts like this.  In my opinion you are part the problem."
racism,30tblc,prayp,4,Mon Mar 30 16:29:36 2015 UTC,"Fellow nonwhite male here. Interestingly, you seem to be channeling the same sense of  paternalism being discussed in the article. If you look at the history books, there is long track record of seemingly well-intended western, europeon societies trying to 'civilize' foreing cultures. Try asking an australian aborigine, although there aren't whole a lot of them left due to obvious reasons.    I am sure that if you get out of the way, the women who are stuck in Islam are praying on a daily basis for some saviours, since they are powerless to unite, and no muslim man is going to stand up for them   And this is exactly the problem. You are assuming all muslim women are powerless and that not a single muslim man would ever bother standing up for women. Through gross blanket generalizations you have condemned and cast a whole demographic as helpless children that are in desperate need of western savior. You are erasing their agency as individuals. I know plenty of anti-sexist muslim men and there are many feminist islamic feminist women standing up for women's rights in the middle-east.    You are not helping by shutting down this discussion   We're not trying to shut down the conversation, but reframe it in a context of self-deternism and encouraging oppressed groups to liberate themselves. When you try to ""fix"" other cultures you devolve into colonialism and imperialism, which have been responsible for gross human rights violations throughout history.  Western tourists making condesnding remarks about islam does nothing to end the systemic oppression of women in the middle-east, all it does is foster islamophobia and discrimination against muslim people, which has sky-rockted since 9/11 if you look at the hate-crime statistics.   It falls to non muslims, both men and women to raise this issue.   No, it falls upon muslim men and women and others directly affected by these practices and regimes. They are the only ones who can enact meaningful change.    The hypocrisy is that while systematic oppression of women in Islam is a topic that is taboo, the same is not afforded to the caste system in Hinduism... that is a free for all, and anyone and everyone seems want to end it.   When did systematic oppression of women in islam become taboo? That is something that I've seen fiercly critized, even by mainstream, usually right-wing, politicians in the west. Our prime minister (canada) is trying to ban the wearing of niqabs in Canadian citizenship oath/ceremony and referred to the headdress as a practice rooted in a culture that is ""anti-women.""  I've seen far more criticism of the topic women in islam than the caste system. And the caste system is isolated to india, so there's not much western people can even do about it; whereas, muslim women are dispersed throughout the world creating butthurt  white people trying to play savior all over  Yes, there are problems with islam, but treating muslims like children and trying to 'civilize them not going to fix anything, it's only going worsen the problem by deepening divisions and heightening hostilities between cultures"

I learned about massive American firebombings of Japanese cities and all-civilian targeting. I visited the atomic bomb impact site in Nagasaki. I learned of the genocide of 100,000 people in the Philippines. I lived the continuing US military occupation of these countries.  To bring it full circle, the fact that enemy territory in Iraq & Afghanistan are still referred to as 'Indian Country', and that our weapons are called Apaches, Tomahawks, Blackhawks, the mission to kill Osama Bin Laden was 'Operation Geronimo' tells us things haven't changed much. We give them such names ostensibly with a proud sense of tradition. This obscures the reality. Our forebears conducted asymmetric warfare, which resulted in a genocide. It was not proud. It was not fair. It was not right.  It's one thing to be a part of the military, but once there's a realization that the foundation our military sits on, and its ability to fight wars today is thoroughly racist, it becomes really difficult to continue as a cog in that machine."

racism,2zu3bd,politicaleft,9,Sat Mar 21 19:59:31 2015 UTC,"White person here: There are white people (can't tell you how many) for whom race is a pressing issue that pervades every aspect of society. It isn't that they think about Black people all day, but that everything they think about has an underlying aspect of race. They would argue that the main problems in American society are caused by or exacerbated by a loose morality which is perpetuated by Black people and their culture. Taxes? Because black people are mooching welfare. Crime? Because black people. Etc. When they think of a certain issue their subconscious is always worrying about the racial apsects, even if they don't say it. Why not fund schools better? Because then we'd be paying for school for black people. Why does our football team keep losing games against other schools? Because they have black people on their team, but we are proud that there are no black people on our team and we don't want that to change. Why am I racist? Because black people.   As a white person I have access to this mindset. Most people nowadays would insist that they don't notice or care about race, but in the same breath say that black people are the racist ones, and if they don't want to be treated like criminals they should stop commiting crimes. So yeah a lot of ignorance there."
racism,2zu3bd,Califoreigner,2,Sun Mar 22 03:34:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah but why? It sounds so primitive. It is like white have black people on the brain, it is pathetic."
racism,2zu3bd,Califoreigner,4,Sun Mar 22 13:19:24 2015 UTC,"Well again, this is only some white people, and certainly to varying degrees. I wouldn't encourage stereotypes or hasty generalizations of any group.   But to answer your question, yes, it's like White America has black people on the brain. That is to say, most white people normally spend most of their time not thinking about black people, but there is subconscious baggage to a lot of issues related to certain topics, especially society and government. They might even have a complete thought that surrounds an issue of race without actually realizing the role that race played in their thoughts. Issues like drugs, self defense, the 2nd amendment, prison, housing prices, sports, music etc. are going to have a subconscious racial implications that only pop up if they actually stop to think about it, but they probably won't. To put it another way, they had an original racist thought early on that was connected to their opinion on certain issues, so they don't really have to consciously think of the racial aspects of their world-view directly to have the racism impact their psyche. Get it? So suddenly they're faced with an issue or a story or a Person of Color and now the whole thought comes boiling up and triggers some fear or anger that doesn't seem to be racism to them, even though it is.   There are a lot of theories, Howard Zinn and others have said that from the beginning days of the US, the wealthy class successfully used race as an issue to divide the working class against themselves so they would be easier to conquer, especially when poor whites, Natives, and Africans started teaming up.   Whatever the reason, I think that it is human nature to have a subconscious fear of the 'others,' whether that means immigrants, foreigners, those with different political positions, and those who look different or have a different culture. I think this occurs among white Americans and their paranoia of black Americans. It is largely from the fact that most white people don't get to know people different from themselves and buy into the popular portrayal of other groups (btw, this lack of familiarity and stereotyping goes both ways and I'd challenge everyone to analyze the way they view 'others'). Secondly, there was a very strong wave of 'Social Darwinism' that went through the American psyche sometime in the past (like the early 1900s, I think), and people haven't really had that jogged from their minds. People literally still believe that white people are genetically superior to other races. They think they're really on to something because they've heard about ""The Bell Curve"" and other nonsense, and there's no amount of fact that can correct it. I had a high school teacher tell me that his black students were genetically unable to learn his subject.  I myself am a white person who grew up in a ""white bubble"" until my adulthood, and was surrounded by these ideas. The world is full of 5 colors of people and white is the normal color. When I met an African American for the first time in elementary school I honestly believed we weren't allowed to be friends. I learned about the history of ""race"" in America and realized that things were fucked up.  I then spent a few years living in government housing and got to know what poverty and oppression were. By the end I had a completely new way of seeing society and especially 'race relations.'  I now live in a foreign country, and can confirm that racism is human nature. Racism is everywhere. But there's something unique about American racism where even non-assholes can accept racist ideas. Many white people are very nice, considerate, thoughtful, intelligent people, but they're under the understanding that science and their religion (probably) have made it a matter of indisputable fact that white people are best. For most people, this shows up as a lingering, subtle racism that really pervades society.  Having said all that, I encourage everyone to look past minor ignorance and petty insults and in a very peaceful way challenge white people on their views. The most successful tactic has been to ask questions that require them to explain their opinions and understanding. That isn't to say that you should tolerate abuse or racism, but to address ignorance through education rather than condemnation.  P.S. I call no SJW or White Knight comments, fuckers.  edit: Uh, changed a lot of things."

I think that the ruling class of the US has leveraged issues like Christianity, racism, and anti-socialism to their benefit. The American people are spread far enough apart that they don't have to interact with people they don't want to interact with, and the result is a populous that isn't sympathetic to anyone who isn't white, Christian, and libertarian.   Where are you living at the moment? I am from the UK and when I look at American racism or make me sick because black people do nothing about it.   I'm in Asia. More specifically, southeast Asia. It also bothers me that the issues are not getting addressed, but I don't think we can blame people who are being held down for not getting up. There are many conditions that impact it, but ultimately it comes down to the majority of people being just a little bit racist.   There are problems in the UK but we push hard for equal representation. Of some of the things that happened in America like with trayvon there would be huge riots.

racism,2zu3bd,granfailoon,2,Mon Mar 23 13:03:14 2015 UTC,"Another white person here: on the flip side, there are others of us who have become obsessed with the inequalities in society, questioning our own biases, and want to do what we can to help ""fix"" things.  We also keep the conversation about black people alive because we are either trying to debate the idiots who believe social inequalities are ""genetic"" or that it's because of ""bad culture"" and also because we are trying to learn more about what others' lives are like so we can be better citizens.  Of course, the problem is that many of us may be well-intentioned but wrong, or ignorant of your lives and unable to help much.    Often these days, racism is more subtle than the type you undoubtedly experience from the worst, most openly hateful white people you encounter every day.  I recently met someone who is subconsciously biased against minorities and women because he simply doesn't understand that people live different lives than he does (only child, wealthy, and extremely sheltered, but thinks he ""worked really hard"" to get what he has -- and I'm sure he did, to an extent, because he earned his grades in school).  I say he's subconsciously biased because he swears up and down that race is NOT a factor in how he treats people, when it clearly is when you observe his actions over a period of time.  Makes me realize I probably do some similar things and I have no idea who I might be subconsciously harming.  It's stupid of course for white people to talk about other races without people of other races in the room, but some white people will only talk to other white people about this, so sometimes it's a necessity.  It does end up navel-gazing, though, and I know that's annoying.  For example: I'm sure I'm telling you some things you know already, and I have no idea if what I'm qualifying as ""subtle racism"" is, to others, open racism.  However, I think it is important to realize that while open, obviously biased racism does still exist, we are (might be?) slowly moving towards a more ""SJW-inspired"" society these days that seeks to understand different lives and level the socio-economic playing field.  It is important to realize that because racism can be subconscious or even a byproduct of relatively innocuous things, like people slightly preferring to live near others who understand them more (which can be a non-racist cause of segregated neighborhoods, a racist result), that social inequalities won't just disappear when we've silenced the open racists and changed the minds of the worst bigots.  We need to continue fighting the bigots and the worst of them, but we also need to understand and change the subtle differences that keep us apart, too.  Fortunately or unfortunately, some of that, for white people, has to be about ""white people psychology.""   TL;DR: other white people are well-intentioned but dumb, under-educated about non-white experiences, or otherwise annoying.  But some of us are trying, if that counts for anything, and the result is that we talk/argue about black people a lot too."

As an Irish person that has recently moved to the US, I have a lot of experience in this very subtle subject but I am always learning more.  Being born in Ireland made you somewhat open to discrimination in certain ways even up to quite recently. Racism and exploitation was experienced by many Irish that emmigrated to the UK in the 80s when Ireland was suffering from economic depression and militant terrorists in the IRA caused mass anti-Irish propoganda in English media.  However, in the 90s and 2000s, Ireland suddenly found itself in a boom, and being part of the EU meant a lot of migrant workers were streaming in to get well paid work. Now we were the ones exploiting and discriminating people, more or less based on where they were from. I remember being in Ireland at this time and hearing about some pretty nasty goings on. Not to mention the travellers of course.  Arriving in the states, I found being Irish to be a distinct advantage in making friends. People were still quick to see me as a caricature of my nationality though, and that can become tiring. I learned it's hard to maintain pride over your heritage and not fall into the trap of being someone's little leprechaun that they can go for pints with.  Getting acquainted with the very complicated and deeply-rooted issues of racism here got me thinking and learning about the Irish diaspora here too. It was crazy to learn of the history of indentured slavery in the first British colonies in the Americas and even the discrimination experienced by famine refugees.  Privilege is a tricky topic. It's so contextual and I suppose for many is counter-intuitive. How does this popular portrayal of Irish victimhood actually grant privilege to us while coverage of events in Ferguson or movies like 12 Years a Slave leave other minorities still oppressed with so many people blind to it or unwilling to see what is obviously in front of them?  It's sad to see that the history of Irish plight has not caused those of Irish heritage to be more compassionate with the current plight of others. Instead, people are turned against each other as a distraction from the real issues."

It's impossible to  make implications towards you teachers assessment without reviewing the draft you turned in.  I often played ""devil's advocate"" in paper's in both High School and College, and I was an honors student. Of course some teacher's suck and want you to regurgitate their opinions, but I've found them to be the minority, generally speaking.  Lastly, an this is kind of a high level skill here, even if you don't want to write the ""obvious paper"" you still need to write to the audience - in this case your teacher.

As others have stated, an educated or wealthy person from Asia or Africa that is working or living off his or her own wealth can also be an expat, especially if they speak English and perform white collar work. Usually an immigrant is a person who is permanently living and working in the host country and performs labor or services that doesn't require an education. I would say this is more of a classist scenario. However, a blue-collar, uneducated white person who is living permanently in the host country is also called an expat and never an immigrant. This is perhaps where the racism comes in.   One interesting observation from living in an Asian country: White people are called ""foreigners"" and everyone else is called by the country they come from. For example, they might say, ""We have a lot of foreigners and Chinese people joining our conference today."" As the term ""foreigner"" does not have the negative connotation it has in the West, this implies some internalized preference for white foreigners and perhaps the same dynamic observed with the term 'expat.'"

As Overt racism (lynchings and cross burning) has been decreasing, other forms of discrimination have taken it's place. I don't know how often I have to explain to people that, ""racism isn't 'over,' yes I have been discriminated against here, and yes racism is an issue here."" I live in the southern US and still people think I am making things up/blowing them out of proportion. Racism is a big and dirty word, and people have demonized the concept, so no one really likes to think of themselves as racist. Instead of the over the top stuff it is millions of little things, little things the sometime turn into a huge scary thing like Ferguson. http://m.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2015/03/ferguson-as-a-criminal-conspiracy-against-its-black-residents-michael-brown-department-of-justice-report/386887/"

And there is a discussion, but it goes nowhere, there are no accepted leaders, there is a huge media opposition to the concept, and generalized silence from organizations, corporations and academia.  Whenever people shouted ""racism"" 50 years ago there was a concrete example, often bloody. When a person shows that a cop fired upon the mere assumption of misdeed we have trouble proving that the mindset of the cop was imbued of that racist belief in the inherent evil of the ""other"". Now, imagine how it is to try and prove that your employer keeps you underpaid and underemployed, or that the reception at the store is cold and dismissive, or that the paper you presented at an academic convention is viewed as fringe and unsupported.

racism,2y0z28,WaaayBackWhen,5,Thu Mar 5 15:07:50 2015 UTC,"You are correct. All slurs are pejorative, and some slurs draw their power from a system of oppression. This is why some words that were once scientific/medical in nature (e.g., ""idiot"" and ""retarded"", or in common/casual usage (e.g., ""negro"") can become slurs. It is not the arbitrary arrange of letters themselves, it is the association with the power behind them (ableism in terms of ""retarded"", white supremacy with regards to the n-word).   Once a word is imbued with that power, all of society must agree to disassociate it. This is, of course, impossible as long as the system of power exists, for there will always be a person who will use that slur against a person belonging to a group targeted by that slur, intending to draw upon that power. There will always be new words imbued with the historical and contemporary legacy of what it means to be black in America, until that is fully resolved.  This is the mechanism by which reclamation may function. When a slur is used toward a person of the targeted class, by another person of the same class, without drawing upon the power, it then becomes a form of solidarity, assuming it is intended and received as such.  In terms of non-black POC appropriating the n-word, I could see it happening between a black person coming to an understanding that it is done in solidarity with them. But that certainly doesn't extend to all black people, and certainly not to non-black POC. We have our own slurs to reclaim.  There can be an honest basis to non-black POC appropriation of black culture, for example, Eddie Huang's appreciation of revolutionary hip-hop. But there is also an insidious motivation not unlike white people's penchant for the black cool aesthetic. I'm still investigating what this means for POC, with regards to whether or not black people are the primary target of white supremacy, and how non-black POC function around that, so I share a lack of clarity with regards to non-black POC reclaiming a slur that's not theirs."

So, are you asking why we don't say ""coon"" or ""porch monkey"" but will say ""nigga""?  If so, it seems simple enough to me. Unlike the other words you mention, reclaiming ""nigga"" was done through hiphop and black Hollywood. Non-blacks who say it are usually hiphopheads who act like their interests give them permission to do so.  In my experience, older folks who don't like it either because they 1) disapprove of hiphop because it's not ""real music"" to them (which isn't unique to just older generations of black people) or 2) have gone NAACP ""respectability politics"" on us so it's like we are embarrassing them in front of company."

racism,2xvfd1,IndianPhDStudent,2,Thu Mar 5 03:56:16 2015 UTC,"I've been noticing this as well. For a long time, Asian males have been getting shafted by the media. I can't think of one movie where an Asian male was a romantic lead. In Romeo Must Die, the original ending had Jet Li kissing Aaliyah but was re-filmed to where they shared a tight hug because, ""Mainstream America, for the most part, gets uncomfortable with seeing an Asian man portrayed in a sexual light.""  Funny thing is, Hollywood's discomfort with Asian men being portrayed in a sexual light started with an Asian man who was too successful with the ladies.   His popularity, sex appeal, and extravagant lifestyle (e.g., his wild parties and his gold-plated Pierce-Arrow) may have fed tension within segments of American society and led to discriminatory stereotypes and the desexualization of Asian men in American productions, something that continues to today in Modern Hollywood..."
racism,2xvfd1,wannaridebikes,3,Wed Mar 4 15:33:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've noticed even in South-Asian men potrayed in the media, there is a stereotype of of being short, shy or feminine.   We have people like Aziz Ansari or Kunal Nayyar being perceived that way by outsiders. There was an SNL sketch where they mimicked Aziz by having a short woman dress up as him. And every interview of Kunnal Nayyar (from TBBT) has to mention how gorgeous his wife is and how lucky someone like him is have someone like her.   I think Hundered-Feet-Journey was the one movie in which an Indian guy was potrayed in a positive attractive, confident romantic-lead kind of a way.  It's really weird."

In the past I had trouble looking past the initial feeling of insult when someone claimed white privilege. I think this stems from the fact that often people use white privilege to invalidate white people's opinions regarding matters of race. The same can be said for male privilege. When privilege is used in an inflammatory way it makes people get defensive. They start saying things they don't necessarily believe in, or things specifically targeted at enraging the other party.  In short... I don't think everyone who brings up white privilege does so in a productive manner that is conducive to respectful discourse.  The fact is, it exists. In different parts of the world it exists to varying degrees. But in the western world it's pretty evident that there is an inherent advantage to being white. I don't see the struggles that people of other races face on a daily basis. I am simply left to my online interactions to get a glimpse of their lives. I have to trust what people say online, which is inherently difficult as we're taught to be skeptical.  I think maybe those who are most opposed to this idea of white privilege maybe have no idea of the disadvantages that others face. Statistics are often taken at face value as 'proof' of racism. When in reality there are more factors than race that affect what jobs people get, their education, etc."
racism,2xft85,trackday,2,Sat Feb 28 20:27:40 2015 UTC,"I woke up this morning with a different thought.  It may be an issue of relativity/semantics.  If the POC experience is 'normal', then the white experience is 'privileged' in relation to it.  But to a white person who is surrounded by white people and the white experience, they consider their daily experience 'normal', which makes the POC experience 'underprivileged' in relation to it.  In other words, when you are having this argument, ask them if they think the POC experience is 'underprivileged' in relation to the white experience, for significant numbers of the POC population.  If they agree, then I would say it's an issue of semantics.  Now if anyone claims that there is no difference in experience between the two groups, IMO they are just ******, for lack of a better adjective atm."

racism,2xb1fe,hucoog,10,Fri Feb 27 02:16:22 2015 UTC,"I have a few thoughts on this but to be honest, it's probably not what you're wanting to hear.   First and foremost, you refer to your boyfriend, the person you are supposedly in love with, as an Uncle Tom, which is a very vindictive term for a black person to use in order to refer to one of their peers, especially their own partner.   I myself, am a black male, not mixed, and I grew up in the hood, but currently live out in the suburbs, and throughout my life, I have gained some rather interesting perspectives.  For one, I'm getting a sense that even though racism exists, and is a real thing, you might be hypersensitive to it, seeing racism in situations that aren't really racist.   And this can cause a lot of problems.   The music for example.  This could be just a cultural and environmental thing and nothing more.  Having lived in the hood, music was tolerated, but out in the suburbs, quiet and courteousness is generally the common rule, regardless of the brand of music.  Doesn't matter if you came down blasting Elvis, people are still going to consider you a dick for doing so in various areas.   As far as him fitting in with the white crowds and being comfortable with it whereas you are not, I can say with confidence that it's likely because of his mannerisms and comfortableness with the groups.  He  can be purple black and still pull off the same results.  And I've seen the same with whites who aren't completely comfortable in the midst of black groups experience the same social shunning, whereas others just hop right on in without a problem.  People may not say it, but they can easily perceive how comfortable you are with a group and trying to inject yourself into a conversation can just make things awkward for everyone around.    With that being said though, your man should work on being aware of this situation and help resolve it by involving you and pulling you into the conversations and socializing himself without you having to try and inject yourself into the crowd.   Sometimes we men can be oblivious to these types of things.   But rather than trying to convince him that his mentality is wrong, and I don't mean this in a mean way, but you should probably step back and evaluate your own feelings on the matter and take into consideration that maybe, the issues of racism are a bit more of a focus in your mind than they should be and that in itself is a problem.   This is also likely why he tends to not want to talk about it, because your standpoint seems to be of one that implicates that the problem is with him and his blindness rather than your hypersensitivity."
racism,2xb1fe,Marcellusk,7,Fri Feb 27 08:55:23 2015 UTC,"the issues of racism are a bit more of a focus in your mind than they should be and that in itself is a problem.

You are literally saying that nothing she has experienced is that important when you say OP is ""hypersensitive"". Do you understand how disparaging it is to dismiss experiencing structural oppression as abnormally excessive feelings?  Partners are supposed to support each other. The fact OP's bf isn't supporting OP doesn't mean OP's experiences are baseless.

racism,2xb1fe,yellowmix,4,Fri Feb 27 20:14:38 2015 UTC,"Your comments are both interesting and expected. First you harp on the fact that I am choosing to call his actions that of an Uncle Tom - trolling. That is hardly the huge issue here. Of course I would never call him that to his face, but it is a quick way to describe what I am experiencing in the subject line.   Second, you are automatically concluding that I am being oversensitive and am ""imagining"" that racism is happening. That is a typical response for people who don't want to come to grips with the way society is today. ""Everything is not about race"" blah blah blah. I agree everything is not about race, but what about when it IS?   You are completely missing the point that I was trying to make about hanging out with his white friends in insinuating that I can't carry myself or hold my own in a room full of them. Just like him,I grew up around white people. I went to all white schools from early childhood to undergrad and have worked with them during and since that time. I am perfectly comfortable talking to and interacting with them. My issue is when I am put in a situation where everyone knows everyone except me and I have no choice but to try to spark up conversations with people because they are not going to be very inclined to just walk up to me. Is it because I am the only black person or one of a couple? Maybe. Either way, it is a fact that some white people feel uncomfortable around black people, especially ones they don't know and vice versa. I was watching an interview and a black man was asked why he doesn't have any white friends and he said, ""white people are scary."" This stuff is real. For you to just equate what I'm saying to hypersensitivity is insensitive, condescending, and unfortunately completely expected.   Lastly, I am not trying to CHANGE anyone. And if there is anything that I want to change, it is the way he reacts to me when I voice my feelings about what I FEEL I am experiencing. He doesn't have to agree or see it my way, but don't be dismissive and immediately shut me down and defend the other person's side. I want to be able to say exactly what is on my mind without having to defend it and have a debate about MY FEELINGS. Also, I am NOT a victim.

Also, not to dismiss his agency, you do not seem to be okay with his chosen strategy. Many people choose this route and are comfortable with it.

What I am unclear on is it seems he is trying to defuse the situation in a manner that is effectively singling you out, and this seems like something that you two can resolve somewhat separately from the race issue.

I get that and can tell the difference between someone who is just mean to everyone and someone who is rude, mean, short with certain people. I would never go out on a limb and resort to saying that every single time something bad happens to me that it's because of race. However, the sad truth is, some of what I have experienced has been because of race. How else do you explain being the only black couple in a restaurant and overcompensating by being as friendly as possible to the waitress so you don't get bad service, yet you notice that you are not getting the same level of service and care that the patrons at other tables are getting? Or when someone says, ""Honey, they don't all look the same"" and then chuckling with your white friends in reference to a black person?  Your response is something that I encounter often. Whoever said that I don't give people the benefit of the doubt? I'm not going around hoping and waiting for someone to do or say something racist. If anything, I am hoping the exact opposite. I don't want the reason why someone is treating me unfairly to be because of race. Let it be something else, ANYTHING else. At least then, there is a chance that we can fix the problem and talk about it. But for it to be an issue of race - there's not much I can do or want to do to change that aspect of myself.  I appreciate your input, but I'm sorry to say that this is a common ""go-to"" for people that defend the behavior that I am speaking of. There is no blanket rule for the way people treat people like ""they are just jerks"" when race is a possible factor. Unfortunately, it is a completely legitimate reason for the way people may treat others. I'm not saying that it is ALWAYS the reason, but to completely take it off the table and reduce the issue to people being jerks is very idealistic and unrealistic in many cases."

For Youtube, type the name of some ethnically-diverse place (or, its opposite, a place with a reputation of ""ethnic homogeneity"") you're interested in travelling to - just some random, non-racially-focused videos - and watch the comments descend into all sorts of racist nonsense about how minorities are all sorts of bad names, and how white supremacy is what people should follow.

A couple were saying black people don't have the internet and it was fake.

I would definitely unsubscribe from most of the default subs, though.  In my opinion, while it's true that the rise of the Internet has created a lot of new overt racism, mostly it has just exposed what has been here all along.  And now that we can see it, we can talk about it and maybe persuade more of the fence-sitters that the problem is real.  A lot of events, such as the successful presidency of Obama and the strong trend toward acceptance of gay marriage, have got the bigots on the run.  They can feel their world disintegrating and they're freaking out.  i really think we're making progress, but the smaller their world gets, the louder they shriek.  please hang in there, we need you.

racism,2x7cfe,dallasdarling,3,Thu Feb 26 16:54:13 2015 UTC,"Indeed.   I think that the title of the article is a bit confusing or misleading. I often hear racists say things like ""those dumb liberals actually try to claim that race isn't real, give me a break, obviously there are white people and black people"".  It's more like: race isn't what you think it is, there's certainly no clear way to define who is what, and any kind of broad statement about race is ludicrous.  A scientific study attempting to analyze the differences between races is already inherently flawed, the idea you can categorize people by race in order to be properly observed in scientific settings just doesn't make any sense."

Too often I hear people say things like ""race doesn't really exist, it's just a construct - so the best way to end racism is to simply stop acknowledging that there even are races.""  I have to say I don't agree with that approach, as I think the best way to combat racism is to actively engage with it - not to pretend that races don't exist."

racism,2x4eye,blackgeekmedia,9,Wed Feb 25 16:03:55 2015 UTC,"I think this guy has it flipped. Using ebonics/'talking improperly' shouldn't be a negative social trait, using the more common dialect of english/'talking properly' shouldn't be elevated above it.   I agree that with this guy is talking about in general, as someone of mixed race and economic privilege I've had a hard time associating with my both my white, and brown peers due to the way I dress/speak/act, and I certainly resent being told that I'm 'acting white'. At the same time, I don't think it's healthy for the movement for us all to aspire to 'talking properly' as this is a standard that has been set by the white majority."
racism,2x4eye,Waabanang,2,Wed Feb 25 23:58:47 2015 UTC,"Regarding proper/improper, totally agreed. The dialect is called General American, but that's clumsy sounding in casual conversation.  In race discussion, ""normative"" is more precise. The problem occurs when normative acts and acts which are inherently white (i.e., imbued with white supremacy) are conflated with each other. As white supremacy permeates everything, it becomes difficult to conceptualize a ""General American"" dialect that isn't imbued with white supremacy. However, it is not precise to frame blackness as against normative society; we conceptualize it as blackness and whiteness, the latter of which happens to be normative; white normativity.  When a POC ""acts white"", are they acting according to normative behaviors, or to white normative behaviors? If it is the latter, can the behavior be liberated from white normativity and simply become normative? This is sort of the flip side to appropriation, so let's look at it that way: can a specific appropriation be free of race in a white supremacist society? I don't think it can happen when it's appropriation of POC culture, but I think it can when it's POC adopting normative behaviors. That it becomes universally recognized as simply normative is another issue."
racism,2x4eye,yellowmix,1 point,Thu Feb 26 18:57:38 2015 UTC,"When a POC ""acts white""   But when a POC does that isn't it other POC who degrade them for ""acting"" that way?  Isn't the other POCs trying to make a distinction of us vs them?"
racism,2x4eye,Ashmodai20,1 point,Fri Feb 27 16:47:48 2015 UTC,"Both POC and white people point out POC are ""acting white"", but the perceptions and motivations can be different. And fundamentally, yes, there is a distinction between (sociologically) dominant and subdominant groups, or rather, as I've described, whiteness and everything else.  So why would someone point out ""white"" behavior?  Well, there is the Stuff White People Like blog. It seems to be poking fun at whiteness, but what is it really doing? Take #99, for example, ""Grammar"". Is an adherence to grammar inextricably imbued with whiteness? I don't think so. Does the author? I don't think so, either. It seems to be a very clumsy critique of the disparagement of AAVE. But not everyone reads it in this extremely generous way, and that's where the harm comes. It is effectively reinforcing the idea that there is a ""proper"" way to write and talk, and that it is identifiably white.  Is there a useful, critical way to make the observation that a POC is performing a white normative behavior? Well, we do it all the time when we point out internalized racism. Is saying ""you're acting white"" a good way to deliver this critique? Most POC don't like hearing they've internalized whiteness, especially in a non-nuanced way. And when it comes to writing or talking in general or formal American English, is its usage an act of internalized whiteness? That is, is it a rejection of (for black people) AAVE?  For Asian Americans and other POC who have a significant immigrant component, it functions somewhat similarly and differently. An AA being told they ""talk white"" can be synonymous with being told they ""speak well"", which stems from the perpetual foreigner stereotype. Sometimes meant as a compliment, in that they've overcome the accent barrier, it can also be an implicit rejection of the national origin language and culture.  So we see a duality; normative behaviors that can be perceived as rejecting POC culture are perceived as white, and there is an open question as to whether it's not just a perception."
racism,2x4eye,yellowmix,6,Fri Feb 27 18:40:44 2015 UTC,"I speak the way I do in public because American bosses, bankers, real estate agents, and police take one and only one dialect seriously. There are reasons for that. I don't consider that the ""proper"" way to speak, as different company indicates the ""proper"" way to speak. Race and Ethnicity are a tricky thing in America since there's so much overlap, especially when your parents raise you in a different culture than your peers do. I agree with most things in this video, but calling the dominant American dialect ""proper english"" irks me."
