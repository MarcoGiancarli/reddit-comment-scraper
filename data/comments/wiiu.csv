wiiu,3e2fsv,bigKaye,7,Tue Jul 21 15:46:17 2015 UTC,..nope we've actually seen footage from that one and the head developer isn't a whiny untrust worthy man baby like this guy.
wiiu,3e2fsv,zoufha91,10,Tue Jul 21 15:52:56 2015 UTC,"I'd love to believe you but it was funded in Feb 2013 and still hasn't released. Considering it's multi platform I'm not sold its running at 60fps on a wiiu, or even bring released before Nintendo launch another console. Maybe it's taking the pcars approach and will just release on the NX.. As when pcars announced it was for the 360/ps3"
wiiu,3e2fsv,bigKaye,6,Tue Jul 21 16:11:57 2015 UTC,Think you missed this video last may it is running at 60fps and looks gorgeous.
wiiu,3e2fsv,zoufha91,4,Tue Jul 21 16:22:09 2015 UTC,I love everything about this game so far. Love that map of the kids room and the slot car track.  Only thing I don't like is the squealing drift noise. So long as they give us audio options so I can turn it down a bit I'll be happy though.
wiiu,3e2fsv,NewAgeRetroHippie96,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:35:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I seen that video from two months ago and agree it looks great. I'd love to see it release before next summer but an not holding my breath. I kind of feel bad for those who backed the project, considering the dev stated then they had everything needed to finish the game. To me that is very misleading and bad business. Not as bad as pcars was/is/been, but still bad."
wiiu,3e2fsv,bigKaye,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:32 2015 UTC,"Yep. We should also not pretend we don't know the root of the friction: the Wii U is underpowered. True, that might have lead to us learning the devs are unkind people, but then, I am not sure most devs are any better..."

wiiu,3e2fsv,maturra,20,Tue Jul 21 16:13:28 2015 UTC,that seems uncool. was there mention of a wiiU version at the time they were asking for backing?

See page 28."
wiiu,3e2fsv,bookchaser,52,Tue Jul 21 18:40:14 2015 UTC,"Perhaps. My point is that a Wii U version was, at the very least, in the works and was never a ""maybe"" to the public -- their statements and actions explicitly promised a Wii U version. And no matter how you look at it, they used the Wii U version to push crowdfunding and help generate excitement and buzz for their project."

Say what you want about people complaining, but this dev has scummed out quite a few people (and not just Wii U owners). I, personally, didn't donate because I think supporting a kickstarter is 9-out-of-10-times a terrible idea, and I would encourage others to do the same."
wiiu,3e2fsv,well-placed_pun,2,Tue Jul 21 17:30:54 2015 UTC,"How do you know they weren't developing it?  Why always assume the worst?  It is very possible that they worked on it and it was going good, but then ran into more and bigger problems than they anticipated. Perhaps it's the same reasons they had to cancel it for last gen consoles.   I get that they unfortunately couldn't deliver on all their initial plans, and that people are rightfully disappointed. But you are accusing them of outright lying without providing any evidence of it. That's a bit much I think."
wiiu,3e2fsv,gay_unicorn666,10,Tue Jul 21 20:10:43 2015 UTC,It's not just Wii U owners that are pissed anymore though. It's everyone since they announced Project Cars 2 right after release (and steam sale) of the first.  The company has just been dicking it's customers left and right.

wiiu,3e2grn,Butters_Creamy_Goo,2,Tue Jul 21 13:19:19 2015 UTC,Okay nice pun. But seriously. Can the game be kept in a separate drive from the save and both work in conjunction?

But when I later bought it on the eshop and downloaded it to my external drive, it created new save data for itself on the external drive and made it seem as though I had started over. There was no way that I could see to reassign the save data to my internal data. I had to do some monkeying around to eventually get all of the data onto the external and now I just use that."
wiiu,3e2grn,PoppaTroll,2,Tue Jul 21 14:50:53 2015 UTC,No you cannot. The game has all the game data bundles together and you can't separate them.

If you die can you replay levels as many times as you want without repercussion?  Yet a lot of these levels have coins 1UP mushrooms all over the place.  What is the point of 1UPs there are no lives?  I wonder if there's some sort of mechanic for tracking how many 1UPs you collect in a level, or some other way to give them purpose."
wiiu,3e2e9a,leeeeebs,2,Tue Jul 21 15:00:25 2015 UTC,"During Treehouse live, they mentioned two modes with lives (10 Mario Challenge and 100 Mario Challenge). Both modes are very similar with the main difference being the number of lives you are provided (and also the number of stages you need to complete I believe). Basically the game combines a random set of courses (from those stored on your Wii U) and then you must complete them without running out of all your lives."
wiiu,3e2e9a,MegaMissingno,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:06:30 2015 UTC,Not to mention coins. They are already next to useless in normal Mario games (without the health meter mechanic) so they are really nothing more than a decoration here.

It's unknown if other players can play whole worlds created by other people, or if it's just a level by level thing.  I also don't know if you can set parameters such as number of lives.  Hopefully you can, so one ups and coins can serve some purpose."

wiiu,3e2gcs,SPNarwhal,3,Tue Jul 21 13:12:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, but you might have to do some messing around if you're dealing with an external hard drive. I just answered this in a different thread but I once had Hyrule Warriors save data on my internal drive from when I rented the disc. But when I bought it digitally I needed to store it on my external, so it created a brand new save data file along with the game on the external drive. Since the Wii will always use the external drive's data in situations where you've got a duplicate (you have the same game on both internal and external drives), it was using the new save data file and therefore it was like I was starting over.   I think what I ended up having to do (this was a while ago) was disconnect my external drive, clear off enough space on my internal to store the full game, re-download the game onto my internal drive, connect the external, then copy/replace the full data (game and save files) over to the external.  Then I could erase it from the internal and use the game off my external as I had originally intended.  I think I had initially tried just copy/replacing the save data from my internal over to the external, but that actually ended up wiping the game itself from the external drive. That's why I ended up having to do that convoluted process.  Anyway, maybe none of this applies to you as you're not using an external drive, but just a PSA for anyone who might be doing the same thing."

wiiu,3e2gcs,SocialDissent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:40:32 2015 UTC,"As others have mentioned, yes the save is still there. Also the system detects the existence of save data when you download a game and sets that as the location for the download, even if the save was from a physical copy before and this is the first time buying / downloading the game from the eShop.  If you do not have enough room on the internal storage for the game you can move the save data from the internal memory to an external hard drive in the data management section of the system. Once moved the eShop will see the save data in the new location and set the download accordingly."

It's the same in every style, the speed and momentum. Here is a comparison image (even if it's not perfect). Now, this is not confirmed officially, but it really seems like physics stay the same.  However, certain quirks and mechanics of each style, are unique to that style. You can watch some of that here when they played it at Treehouse."

wiiu,3e01pc,Slyphoria,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:42:24 2015 UTC,"Don't see this happening.  You make a part of the course that is only passable by doing the spin jump from SMW.  You hit a block earlier that changed the graphics to SMB3.  No spin jump in that game, you die every single time.  Or you make NSMB style where you have to wall jump to advance, but then it switches to SMB with no wall jump techniques.  You run out the timer and die.  Won't happen."
wiiu,3e01pc,SpaceJockey1979,16,Mon Jul 20 23:47:06 2015 UTC,"Well, part of the fun is solving how to go ahead, this is basically every game."
wiiu,3e01pc,auad,3,Mon Jul 20 23:53:21 2015 UTC,But I don't think there's ever been a part in a game that you could make completely impossible
wiiu,3e01pc,Opticine,2,Tue Jul 21 02:12:37 2015 UTC,Theoretically you could make any level impossible to beat. You could make a level that starts out with Mario surrounded by unbreakable blocks.
wiiu,3e01pc,coppergone,13,Tue Jul 21 03:42:15 2015 UTC,You wouldn't be able to upload it to the server though unless it can be beaten by the creator.
wiiu,3e01pc,InspectorSpaceman,4,Tue Jul 21 04:33:15 2015 UTC,Without dying
wiiu,3e01pc,SuperWoody64,2,Tue Jul 21 06:41:11 2015 UTC,"Having to change styles to get through another section doesn't sound as appealing though.  In these types of games you just want to get through the stage and figure it out, not have to decide if I need to spin jump to move on or cape fly (is that an option even) or wall jump or hesitate mid-air, etc.  Switching styles during the level just seems like a big turn off.  Also /u/tideblue makes a point that you seem to only be able to do one style per level, but the world map version with linked levels (1-1, 1-2, etc) can have different styles.  So you don't have to force people to switch styles with a magic block which I think would honestly lessen the fun."
wiiu,3e01pc,SpaceJockey1979,7,Tue Jul 21 00:44:43 2015 UTC,"Well stages can't be impossible. Wouldn't that be the fun if you got to a section and you had to SMW Spin on some enemies but you were in 8-bit form? You know you'd missed something and you'd have to go back.  And I didn't mean a ""permanent"" switch. Like a block to go from Style A to B, then if you hit it again you go back from B to A."
wiiu,3e01pc,Nakateconroy,3,Tue Jul 21 02:16:18 2015 UTC,"People won't design levels like that. They can't. You have to pass the level to upload it. Unless I don't understand what you're saying, the block still seems plausible."
wiiu,3e01pc,SpaceJockey1979,-2,Tue Jul 21 04:04:44 2015 UTC,"I get that they would have to changes styles per OPs idea to advance and beat the stage, and it would therefore be uploadable.  I'm saying it doesn't sound enjoyable to me."
wiiu,3e01pc,Nakateconroy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:07:37 2015 UTC,Oh. My b.
wiiu,3e01pc,Jalien85,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:30:55 2015 UTC,I doubt it will happen only because if it were possible they probably would have shown that off by now. But I don't think it would be the worst idea. It could add another puzzle element to your level design - you need to find and hit this block before advancing the next section that at first seemed impossible. Obviously if you make it too convoluted and confusing then that's bad level design and people will not like/play your level. But it could be done well.
wiiu,3e01pc,BlindManBaldwin,0,Tue Jul 21 15:00:22 2015 UTC,That would be really cool if they put that in. Since the physics engine is the same regardless it should work.  EDIT: Guess the physics engines are different. Would still be cool if it was in.
wiiu,3e01pc,tideblue,14,Mon Jul 20 23:37:48 2015 UTC,I don't think that's true about the physics engine. The New SMB style has Mario jumping off walls and SMB3 has charged-up running from the looks of it.
wiiu,3e01pc,BlindManBaldwin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:44:11 2015 UTC,Really? Huh. I vaguely remember reading that it is the same regardless of the appearance. I could be wrong.

wiiu,3e01pc,InspectorSpaceman,2,Tue Jul 21 00:31:08 2015 UTC,"MOre of a semantics thing, but the physics are the same, and the mechanics are different.  Physics = top speed, jump distance, acceleration.  Mechanics = jump styles, parkour, shell grabbing (kicking)."
wiiu,3e01pc,Jalien85,2,Tue Jul 21 04:35:31 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't the way you jump be part of the physics though? Like in the earlier Mario games you couldn't change direction after jumping, in later ones you could. That seems like physics to me and it's a pretty major factor in how a level can be played."
wiiu,3e01pc,Technofreak301,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:55:48 2015 UTC,The different physics engines are what would make the style switching useful.
wiiu,3e01pc,Jalien85,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:57:09 2015 UTC,"Useful, but maybe unfair in some cases. I guess that would play into your level design though. Imagine playing some of the original SMB levels with the ability to wall jump..."
wiiu,3e01pc,AdvancedBlackOps,2,Tue Jul 21 14:57:05 2015 UTC,Incorrect. The physics are true to their respective games.

It came with my refurbed Wii U (well I chose it from 3 games) and I thought it felt so nice.  The game just flowed.  I'm not talking about WW in general (I liked the game on GC, I liked it on Wii U), I'm talking about having the menu on your screen and switching items like nothing while the game is still going on."

wiiu,3dy87h,Shaore92,2,Mon Jul 20 19:59:55 2015 UTC,"You can pause regardless of where you are playing.  if you pause while playing on the TV, you pause the game but can still interact with the gamepad."

It's been stated literally hundreds of times now: the next console begins development within a year or two of the last one, it does not mean we're close to getting it. Nintendo screwed up massively when they announced that they were doing this (iirc, to concerned shareholders, not formally) because people do not understand the dev cycle and now everyone's saying they're abandoning it. No; we don't even know what it is, let alone that it's a WiiU replacement and that it's coming out relatively soon. If I were a betting man, I would be willing to put money down that we're not getting it until 2017 at the earliest."

wiiu,3dy87h,vaporfarts,3,Tue Jul 21 06:11:49 2015 UTC,"Right, and how much of it was for the Wii U?  Everything for Wii U was announced at last year's E3 except the Animal Crossing board game and the Mario Tennis game.  The showing looks like minimal effort for the Wii U.  The bigger reason why is, because they said information on the NX is coming next year.  That usually means a reveal.  A reveal is generally made 6-18 months before release."
wiiu,3dy87h,JeddHampton,5,Mon Jul 20 23:19:19 2015 UTC,"You do realize that there's a year-long difference between 6 and 18 months, right?"
wiiu,3dy87h,SageWaterDragon,6,Tue Jul 21 03:34:49 2015 UTC,"The problem is that Nintendo can only make so many games on their own. Heck, they got Platinum to help them with Starfox. This is what the lack of 3rd party support does. It makes it harder to release big games consistently.  So I wouldn't say that they've been neglecting the Wii U as much as I'd say they just can't support it all by themselves no matter how much they want to.  So since Nintendo said that they won't talk about NX until next year, I'd expect NX to come out in 2017 or 2018. But I suspect that it will be backwards compatible, and that Wii U support will continue for several years after NX comes out (albeit in a small way I'm sure).  I think the best thing they could do for NX is to get 3rd parties on board somehow. That's one thing that went super wrong for Wii U. It just became a Nintendo only machine for everyone. Amazing, but not amazing enough to stay afloat."
wiiu,3dy87h,Unggoy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:10:01 2015 UTC,"Well you forgot Starfox.  Yeah, so you want a ton of games to come out in the next 6 months for the Wii U? Come on.

wiiu,3dy87h,sfx,13,Mon Jul 20 17:55:01 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing NX is a platform with a shared library. It will have 2 or more devices, one being a home console and the others being handhelds with varying screen sizes. The key factor in this strategy though is they all have a similar framework and hardware architecture which will allow for a 100% sharable library.  This will allow them to focus all of their effort on games, and not multiple platforms that both need simultaneous support. This also solves an issue with Japan seemingly not wanting anything to do with non-portable gaming devices.  Disclaimer: I'm not someone's uncle who works for Nintendo, this is simply my semi-educated guess based on the comparisons Nintendo likes to make to the mobile market and how it functions."
wiiu,3dy87h,MASSIVE_OGRE_COCK,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:11:29 2015 UTC,I really hope this is the way it goes down. It's basically 3DS' massive library but with HD graphics. And even vice-versa. (portable Wii U games)

wiiu,3dy87h,DannyYouSexbang,7,Mon Jul 20 19:06:38 2015 UTC,"The article you linked is making an incorrect assumption.  In the article with the actual interview, Reggie says this:    From a Nintendo perspective, we clearly have strength here in the Americas, we have strength in Europe and we have strength in Japan. That isn’t necessarily true of some of our more direct competitors. We’ve also said publicly that we are already hard at work on our next home console and that’s another element we’ll be talking about much later.

He says that they've mentioned that they're working on a new home console, which isn't really newsworthy due to how console development cycles work (the Big 3 are always working on the next console).  You're assuming that a) Nintendo hasn't at least barely mentioned that they're working on the next console at all since the Wii U's launch, and b) that this means the NX must be that home console.  Of course, if the NX is their next home console, why not say so?"

If we're getting the NX 1st quarter of 2016 (when I expect we'll get Zelda U) We would already have all the details of the console. You don't just reveal a console and release it shorty after.

wiiu,3dy87h,thewaitaround,6,Mon Jul 20 19:32:08 2015 UTC,"Well, Nintendo set objectives for the WiiU and it didn't attain them. That's pretty close to the definition of failure.  Then:   It failed to sell more units than any other Nintendo home console It failed to make money (Nintendo lost money on it) It failed to attract 3rd party developers (Nintendo home console haven't been great on that for some time but the WiiU is even worse)   We can argue that it succeeded in providing a fun experience for us happy owners, but by any business metric I think it's a failure."

wiiu,3dy87h,vaporfarts,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:35:07 2015 UTC,I think that is different though.  WiiU is not sold at a loss.  So each unit makes some money for Nintendo.  However it hasn't sold enough yo make up the costs of R&D.    At least that's how I interpreted it.
wiiu,3dy87h,elPedroGrande,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:34:35 2015 UTC,It failed to make money (Nintendo lost money on it)   Did it though? If it did it didn't lose much because Nintendo are making a profit again.

wiiu,3dy87h,DayMan-FTW,-2,Tue Jul 21 03:53:33 2015 UTC,"Why does everyone think they've abandoned the WiiU for the NX?   The E3 digital event didn't make that obvious for you? The bulk of their presentation was localizations, and quick / safe games for Wii U and 3DS. They elaborated on things that were announced last year (and in January of 2013 cough yoshi's woolly world cough) but they didn't really have any big new games to highlight this year.  I'm pretty confident that outside of smaller, safe releases we already know everything that's ever going to come out on Wii U. NX launches by holiday 2016 in the US, book it."
wiiu,3dy87h,MASSIVE_OGRE_COCK,3,Mon Jul 20 19:04:31 2015 UTC,"They also explained that they only wanted to announce things coming out this year and focus solely on those, which makes sense given that part of their push at E3 was to have 3 days of the Treehouse playing stable demos of everything presented during E3. You can't do that for games that are far away, and that's why every other company had staged demos or trailers with no gameplay in them. They did a lot of it last year as well, but they didn't have the Treehouse play every game on screen like they did this year which allowed them to show stuff that they thought was only a year out. I imagine after the backlash for constantly delaying games like Zelda and Wooly World they figured ""Screw it, we'll give them stuff that we can immediately satisfy them with.""  It wasn't obvious to me because it wasn't obvious; this is all blind speculation on a project that we know literally nothing about. We've only been given generic fluff and word salad whenever someone who could actually know something is asked about it, and it's so early in development that literally anything about it can change. Is it a home console or handheld, or something else entirely? Nobody knows. I'm not gonna book 2016 as a release for 2 letters that have had so much guesswork and theory-crafting behind them that it can be both everything people want and nothing at all.  Anyone remember the Wii HD rumors in 2008-9? They were probably working on an HD Wii then; that's how this works. Those rumors continued until they actually revealed the WiiU, and the only thing they all had right was HD. The only difference now is they don't have a massively successful product out, so they needed to appease their shareholders by telling them they were working on their next big hardware release, which they would be at this point anyway."
wiiu,3dy87h,C7_the_Epic,10,Mon Jul 20 20:33:08 2015 UTC,What do we know about Zelda Wii U   Nothing enough to even fill up a 6 minutes video with solid facts.
wiiu,3dy87h,Shiroi_Kage,15,Mon Jul 20 22:11:28 2015 UTC,"Great video except the part where it is speculated that Zelda U would be on NX.  NX isn't even officially announced yet, that will happen at E3 next year, along with a playable Zelda U.  Zelda U releases Holiday 2016, and then E3 2017 and Holiday 2017 is all about NX."
wiiu,3dy87h,MBCnerdcore,2,Mon Jul 20 18:02:57 2015 UTC,"That sounds about right.  The 3DS was unveiled at E3 2010, and it launched March 2011.  The Wii U was unveiled at E3 2011, and it launched November 2012.    If they show the NX at next year's E3, I'd expect it to be on shelves by holiday season 2017."
wiiu,3dy87h,JeddHampton,-2,Mon Jul 20 23:26:56 2015 UTC,"You have to be taking some kind of crazy pills to not think they won't port zelda u over to the NX. Odds are, the time that zelda started its development was around the time that they were pondering ideas for NX. That being said, I have no doubt that they'll use it as a launch title for the system after the wii u one is released. See twilight princess, for example."
wiiu,3dy87h,AvidlyUnstable,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:29:55 2015 UTC,"That's a bunch of bull, Zelda has been in development, at least partially, since 2011, after the release of Skyward Sword, which was before the release of the WiiU, which is therefore before any work began for NX. Also: Skyward Sword was not a WiiU launch title, nor were the oracle games GBA launch titles."
wiiu,3dy87h,Phoxxent,0,Tue Jul 21 14:47:27 2015 UTC,"Skyward sword wasn't ported because of what nintendo was already planning on re doing wind waker for the wii u close to launch. Also, I said the development of Zelda u likely started when the NX was first being discussed. This is likely true, as there is a lot that has to be done with a game before development starts. I guarantee you that zelda u didn't start full development until 2013"
wiiu,3dy87h,AvidlyUnstable,0,Tue Jul 21 14:51:18 2015 UTC,"WWHD had a 6 month development cycle, and didn't start until after the E3 2011 (or was it 2012?) WiiU zelda tech demo, where they ported the 3D Links into that lighting engine. There were no prior plans for WWHD at the time when SS would have been ported. So, if they wanted to port SS to WiiU, they would have, and there weren't any plans preventing them from doing so. Basically, Zelda WiiU is about as likely to be an NX launch title as Majora's Mask was going to be a gamecube launch title, which is to say: not at all."
wiiu,3dy87h,Phoxxent,0,Tue Jul 21 14:56:51 2015 UTC,"Again, they didn't port SS because they didn't want it to interfere with their WWHD port. They wanted to maximize sales on that remaster as well as the bundles. You can save my comments and everything, I 100% guarantee the best Zelda will be a launch title for NX. Why? Because they want to maximize the sales of this game being that it is a zelda game and knowing that the wii u has a less than stellar install base. This will also help initially drive sales of the NX for the many who were turned off from the wii u. It just makes marketing sense. It's fine though, you can be in denial all you want. That's exactly what will happen"
wiiu,3dy87h,AvidlyUnstable,0,Tue Jul 21 15:06:29 2015 UTC,"But at the point where SS would have been ported, i.e. where we are now with Zelda U, there was not WWHD. It didn't exist. You also haven't answered why they didn't port the oracle games to be GBA launch titles, or Majora's Mask to be a Gamecube launch title, both of which would have been the same position we are in now. There is precedent that it will stay on the WiiU, because just being good for business has never been a good enough reason for Nintendo to do anything. Besides, a nice price drop, and a budget SKU of the console along with a new Zelda would pretty much negate the need to put it on NX. After all, a sale is a sale, so what I have proposed makes just as much business sense. Also, doesn't the WiiU have one of the highest attach rates of any Nintendo console? That would pretty much guarantee that they are more likely to make more money on a WiiU sale than an NX sale. So, with that in mind, it's probably far more profitable to not waste money porting it to NX when they can make just as much if not more by having it on WiiU."
wiiu,3dy87h,Phoxxent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:23:04 2015 UTC,"You're asking me to tell you why nintendo made decisions from over a decade ago? That's your argument? I can at least answer the majoras mask gamecube dilemma for you. The n64 was immensely different in architecture from the GameCube, they would've had to basically make the game again. But it's fine, your opinion won't change. I'll be sure to save this conversation and report back when zelda u launches with the NX. I'm good at being patient."
wiiu,3dy87h,AvidlyUnstable,23,Tue Jul 21 15:38:55 2015 UTC,"Considering how much of the wii u gamepad zelda u is based around, that rumor of it being delayed so it can release on the NX too only makes sense if the NX also uses the gamepad..."
wiiu,3dy87h,SandieSandwicheadman,23,Mon Jul 20 15:35:13 2015 UTC,"This is pure speculation, but I doubt they're going to keep the gamepad around for the next generation. The Wii U wasn't popular, so I bet they'll want to completely re-brand themselves with the next console."

wiiu,3dy87h,usedtobecool84,-3,Tue Jul 21 16:30:22 2015 UTC,… Maybe the NX is the Replacement to the Weed U GamePadu?
wiiu,3dy87h,dizzyzane_,3,Mon Jul 20 22:51:47 2015 UTC,"No, if anything the NX might use a newer version of the gamepad only compatible with the NX. Nintendo for the last two generations has really honed in on that backwards compatibility market. With the Gamepad NX they could have the entire Wii U library.   Since it likely won't be a power PC, but an x86 system I think they will either have to find a way to emulate the way Xbox One can now do with some 360 games or they will have to move towards a better virtual console. Wii U games are by default on the eShop anyway so that shouldn't be a major problem like it is currently with the slow trickle of previous generations.  I think the NX will have an improved gamepad. You can see it in the way they deal with the handheld market as well with the N3DS. The N3DS is more of a natural progression of the 3DS, but it will improve some software or make some software exclusive (2 which currently exist). Yes, the N3DS will probably go the way of the DSi with minimal exclusives, but the NX will probably be considered a flagship console, and not be a Wii U slim/ New Wii U.  In terms of controllers though, I hope that outside of virtual console games that they NX sticks to a more rigid choice of controller. I think it is neat you can use the revived Wiicube controllers for things like Sm4sh, but it also comes at the cost of having a Wiimote. Sure the hardcore will have Wiimotes, nunchucks, and other controllers, but for the casual consumer it gets expensive buying controllers."
wiiu,3dy87h,ChariotRiot,2,Mon Jul 20 19:56:11 2015 UTC,"Interesting take. I just don't see why they would try to stick with the gamepad idea now that it's flopped so thoroughly. Obviously backwards compatibility is a big deal, but I don't think they're going to let Wii U backwards compatibility drive the direction they move with the NX. I could definitely see them taking a whole new direction (much like they did with the Wii when the Gamecube didn't sell very well).  But obviously, no one knows what will happen! Good thing we'll all find out in about 11 months..."

wiiu,3dy87h,SandieSandwicheadman,5,Mon Jul 20 15:52:51 2015 UTC,If the NX uses backwards compatibility then there's no reason why not. All it needs is architecture to run the game and drivers for the Gamepad.
wiiu,3dy87h,cbfw86,2,Mon Jul 20 15:39:03 2015 UTC,Considering it's probably going to be powered by an AMD x86 APU and the Wii U has a PPC CPU that doesn't seem likely.

Edit: this is only if it's a home console. If it's a handheld and home console like people are saying then I have no idea what they'll do for BC."
wiiu,3dy87h,garrlker,2,Mon Jul 20 19:52:27 2015 UTC,"They will probably switch to X86 for more performance   That's the misconception, x86 doesn't magically give you more performance. Indeed, per price, PowerPC gets you more power per buck, and all of Intel's and AMD's most recent efforts - and yes, that includes the unit inside PS4 and X1 - are low-power, low-heat SoCs designed for tablets and ultrabooks, to compete against the ARM-based Apple Ax and Nvidia Tegra."
wiiu,3dy87h,mb862,2,Mon Jul 20 19:56:05 2015 UTC,"All current Intel cpu offerings, even the baytrail/cherry trail atoms have higher performance than the Wii U's cpu. I can't speak for AMD since their next release hasn't happened yet, but the single threaded performance on the Xbox one /PS4 is also higher than the Wii Us. Assuming Nintendo were to go with any modern X86 cpu from the past 3 years they could get much better performance than what the WiiU has."
wiiu,3dy87h,garrlker,4,Mon Jul 20 20:21:50 2015 UTC,The main benefit would be though all major devs are already targeting x86
wiiu,3dy87h,KeyVapours,4,Mon Jul 20 20:37:15 2015 UTC,"Yes and if they were to go for a comparably-specced PowerPC from the past 3 years they would get much better performance than the PS4 and X1 have.  I never said Wii U's PowerPC was more powerful. I said that generically PowerPC will outperform for the same price - at the cost of being hotter - than recent offerings from AMD and Intel.  At the time the Wii U's hardware was finalised in late-2011/early-2012, the PowerPC core inside was about 3 years old. The AMD core inside PS4 and X1 were finalised just before release-to-manufacture in mid/late-2013. There is a good debate to be had about going with aged but proven technology (like Nintendo does) versus bleeding edge but unproven technology (like Microsoft and Sony). I'm in the former camp, as it allows for more reliable products and a healthier profit to which make better games. If you're in the latter, well, there is already a large part of the industry that focuses on such practice, so all I ask is to not just blindly believe that x86 is better because some companies have applied a higher-end implementation, and think about the broader meaning of what such a move would do."
wiiu,3dy87h,mb862,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:29:14 2015 UTC,"Ah well the reason I specifically commented in the baytrail/cherrytrail cpus is that they're extremely cheap. So cheap that you can get tablets made with them for 60-70 bucks running full Windows. So Nintendo could get decent performance, low heat, low power, and it be cheap.  Also I'm not trying to say that X86 is the end all be all of cpus. They have their faults too. And I'd like Nintendo to stay away from X86. I'd like to see an ARM based contender. Although I'm not sure if 64bit arm is ready enough since it does fall into the bleeding edge category and whatever Nintendo uses next gen it has to be a 64bit cpu to be able to address the 4+gigs of ram  it will probably need.  Also can you link some sources on the performance of power pc? I don't think you're lying but I've never heard of power pc being really powerful so this is surprising for me."
wiiu,3dy87h,garrlker,2,Mon Jul 20 21:18:46 2015 UTC,"IBM may have lost some relevance in the consumer space when Apple switched to Intel, but that was over heat reasons, not performance. The G5 was a great chip it just ran very hot, preventing iBooks and PowerBooks of the time from using it. The Intel switch gave them Windows compatibility but it was years before the Core chips - revered at the time for performance and heat - were able to catch up to the G4 chips they replaced. The G5 was also used in the Xbox 360 (contributing to the infamous heat issues) while the Wii U uses a descendent of the G4. However in the server space, IBM is still up there - their Sequoia is currently the third-most-powerful supercomputer in the world. It's marginally behind the US government's Titan (which combines AMD CPUs with Nvidia GPUs to barely beat Sequoia's CPUs in benchmarks) and China's Tianhe-2 which is based on about 80000 Xeon cores.  But of course the argument that IBM having the third-most-powerful supercomputer with an architecture much closer to what would be found in a home console than the x86-based peers is really more apocryphal. I don't have any sources onhand about actual performance measures (which is difficult across varying architectures) but as I recall each individual PowerPC core in the Wii U has roughly the same throughput as the individual Jaguar codes in the PS4/X1, despite being 5 years older and 75% of the clock speed (of course, the others have more cores, much faster memory, and more advanced GPUs).  While I'm a big fan of ARM as well, the only company making a reliable and viable 64-bit chip at the moment is Apple, and doubtful they'd license. Qualcomm and Samsung are working on their own 64-bit ARM implementations, but nothing so far yet (and they would be, as you say, bleeding-edge).  FWIW, those Windows tablets really don't get respectable performance, but they're able to make that price thanks to significant subsidies by Microsoft and Intel in order to flood the market with cheap, low-end options to skew marketshare away from Apple."

Another thing, the late Iwata spoke about his announcement of the NX and said that it was to make sure people know that Nintendo is committed to the dedicated gaming platform system and prevent the spread of rumors about Nintendo's business direction after announcing the DeNA deal. He even said that support for the Wii U will continue into the NX's cycle, which is normal of any new console release. Hell, the fact that they're not talking about the thing at all is mainly because it's a console so far from being finished that they really can't talk about it.

I was pretty sore about the Wii U I paid good money for not being the main platform for this lovely new game.  But... something has changed recently, and it's one of two things. 1. Some more time has passed, and I suddenly feel like it's properly the eveningtide of the Wii U's life. But it could be 2. I went and bought Splatoon, and it's a fucking blast, and my Wii U feels strangely complete now. And this is coming from someone who actually believes that Super Mario Maker could be its killer app. But... yeah. My Wii U feels complete now with Splatoon. I'm not upset anymore. Bring on the NX."

wiiu,3dy87h,unkno,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:32:09 2015 UTC,"I'm just imagining how fun a full console Zelda game will be with full touchscreen and second-screen integration will be. Maybe you can draw paths for things like in Phantom Hourglass (items? allies? Your horse even?)?  And the second screen could be used for a lot of things. Imagine fighting a boss on the top and bottom screens and having to manage two elements of the fight somehow. Although, that would mess with the WWHD UI system that worked so well...  And I guarantee you there will be an equivalent to the Tingle Bottles from WWHD, only probably better. And I wonder what Amiibos will do?"

wiiu,3dy87h,Poyoarya,4,Tue Jul 21 00:00:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know why everyone is so convinced we're getting the NX any time soon. We see how much Nintendo will push back their development of a game over and over, yet for some reason when they give us just the vaguest notion that a new console is in development we assume it's going to be out within a year or so. I'm guessing they probably won't even announce what the NX is until next E3, and by that time the new Zelda will either be out or very close. We haven't had much for announcements of any big title Wii U games for 2016, so assuming the NX won't launch until 2017 it would be very foolish for them not to release ANY big games for the U for the entirety of 2016."
wiiu,3dy87h,Jalien85,2,Mon Jul 20 20:11:33 2015 UTC,"Judging by their lineup at E3 this year and the upcoming U games for the rest of the year, it is very clear they are phasing it out already.   It makes sense though, the touch screen was too late and they didn't use it enough.   Better to get the mistake fixed sooner rather than later.  Two more years of the Wii U would not be good for Nintendo, and the 3DS is starting to slow down as well.  They are moving on, I am sure of it."
wiiu,3dy87h,JordanM85,2,Mon Jul 20 22:27:58 2015 UTC,"Rushing out their next console would not be good for them either though. Especially when the current gen of their competition will likely be around for a another 5-ish years (if the previous generation is any indication). I'm not saying they're gonna wait that long, but they've got time. And I think they know they've really got to go back to the drawing board for their next big console. They don't want two flops in a row. They're probably still figuring out exactly what this system is going to be.  The Wii U is indeed probably well into the downward curve of its arc, but that does not mean they won't try to have one or two more big hits with it. For one thing, never releasing a new Zelda title for it will massively piss off their customers. It was promised. Second, a big title next year could be their one last push to sell some units. They could lower the price point a bit again and package it with the new Zelda. There's potential market in people who would buy the discounted system realizing that there's a decent backlog of interesting games they never got to play. I think Mariokart, Smash, and Zelda (and maybe Splatoon to a lesser extent) are the three franchises that can potentially actually push people into buying the console.  As an aside, I bought my Xbox 360 when it was about $150. That still ended up being a couple years before the Xbone and PS4 came out, and I still use it today. I think a similar thing could happen for the Wii U if they can manage to knock the price down enough. Zelda could help them get one last push of latecomer customers before they really roll out their next big thing."
wiiu,3dy87h,Jalien85,0,Mon Jul 20 22:50:06 2015 UTC,It's interesting to note how much time and money is invested into the new game despite the fact that most Zelda fans just want a traditional game without any gimmicky new features.
wiiu,3dy87h,SirSaltie,-3,Mon Jul 20 21:21:52 2015 UTC,I really really hope they have it as a launch title for the NX. I will buy it on the Wii U and then buy myself an NX straight away and play it again. I don't have to see a lot to know that this game is going to be a game for the ages.
wiiu,3dy87h,cbfw86,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:38:24 2015 UTC,"I'm still excited, too.   Concession: I'm going to be bummed if it doesn't make it to the Wii U and they use it exclusively as a launch game for the NX, but I'll probably do what you said (buy it for both). That's what I did for Twilight Princess (GCN and Wii) and I liked the look and feel of both.  What I'm definitely most curious about is how Skyrim-y it's going to be. Open World Zelda without a linear story sounds amazing, so I wonder how they'll pull it off since, historically, the general go to temple -> defeat mini-boss -> obtain temple item -> use temple item to defeat Big Boss flow is a pretty tried-and-true staple in the franchise.  EDIT: I love the franchise, so of course I'm pumped. Hopefully we'll see it in 2016 since 2015 doesn't seem likely based on the video."
wiiu,3dy87h,whiskeyandritalin,12,Mon Jul 20 15:52:59 2015 UTC,What people forget is that original open world game was Zelda 1 on the NES. So when people talk about a Skyrim-ey Zelda it's the wrong way round. But that's me being an old purist.
wiiu,3dy87h,cbfw86,2,Mon Jul 20 15:57:39 2015 UTC,You're absolutely correct; I misspoke a bit. The reason why I mentioned Skyrim was because he alluded to it in the video (sidebar: he could have stood to take a few breaths here-and-there -- it's like he typed everything up in Word and proceeded to read it ASFASTASPOSSIBLE. Are all his videos like that?) since not many new gamers would go all the way back to the NES or find a ROM/VC copy of it. They're more likely to know what Skyrim is before seeing the connection between the NES Zelda and NX Zelda.  No worries being a purist!
wiiu,3dy87h,whiskeyandritalin,3,Mon Jul 20 16:00:57 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly so excited for Zelda U. I've had it as my wallpaper for over a year now. I hope we don't get weaknesses like bad draw distance. I get that it's a part of having big open world games with big vistas, but I hope they can design the world to avoid it as much as possible."

wiiu,3dy87h,whiskeyandritalin,5,Mon Jul 20 15:58:01 2015 UTC,"I agree with your Q4 2017 guess. That would give the WiiU a 5 year lifespan, which is about par for Nintendo consoles. It also is the right timeframe for a teaser announcement at E3 2016 and a full-on demonstration at E3 2017."

Splatoon, MK8 and Smash online are in their primes. Even if the new consoles had backwards comparability they woulda died off a bit by then."

It's quite good on doing that, but it's up to your mind and hand to actually manage to draw a painting in real. It's always easier in the game. The games are good anyway, and probably the best game for the wii U gamepad. Very family friendly as well."

wiiu,3dyumq,tswaves,8,Mon Jul 20 18:09:09 2015 UTC,I disagree! I thought it was amazing the whole way through. The soundtrack and the art carried it though.
wiiu,3dyumq,ErectusPenor,8,Mon Jul 20 18:24:04 2015 UTC,"The art style was beautiful, as well as the music, and the dialogue was actually good/interesting. I'm someone who can appreciate ""artsy-fartsy"" stuff like the poetic dialogue, something that I could definitely see other people disliking and calling ""pretentious"".   But I agree with the other guy... I didn't think it was a fun game. The combat system was, well, not totally unique, but its gimmick was different enough to make the play-style attractive, but battle after battle of strategizing the same, ""slow this guy's action rate, now this guy, back to the first guy"", etc., it just got boring. And then the whole game started to feel really slow, to me. Each fight, the dialogue, movement in the ""overworld"".  I was really disappointed because of how amazing and wonderful the game first presents itself as."
wiiu,3dyumq,colmatterson,2,Mon Jul 20 20:06:44 2015 UTC,"I'm probably 75% through Child of Light and I just can't force myself to play it anymore, the combat is so painfully tedious / boring / frustrating on bosses. I also just don't find myself caring for the story or wanting to do any of the side quests.  Seriously with the combat the interruption system becomes so annoying as enemies start having incredibly strong abilities IF you interrupt them, so your entire game plan has to change to stop yourself from attacking while they're attacking - which leads to lots of defending and waiting and in my opinion, some of the least fun turn based combat I've ever experienced.   Basically, I agree that this game is just nowhere near as good as it looks on the outside. I honestly would have enjoyed it much more if there was no gimmick, as everything about using it feels very tedious not to mention it's also incredibly easy."

The soundtrack is still one of my all-time favourite video game soundtracks (thanks Coeur de pirate!), the art is beautiful, and the combat is engaging, if not a bit easy. But still for some reason I didn't enjoy the game as much as I thought I would. The game and the world felt a bit empty, like it was lacking heart.   I found Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons to capture that fairy tale feeling a lot better, the world felt mysterious and alive and full of history and lore, whereas Child of Light didn't quite feel that way. It might be a result of it being a 2D platformer.   Regardless I would still recommend the game for the soundtrack alone."

The only controller type allowed for second player is the Wiimote, and you cannot control by actually using the Wiimote as a motion controller.  Instead you use the Dpad, this leads to clunky movement as you try to control the firefly with only 2 axis movement."

wiiu,3dyumq,kaesemann,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:41:10 2015 UTC,"Best platforming game I've ever played. It has amazing multiplayer (non-punishing so you can take along hapless friends, though still challenging), incredibly cool levels, pretty large amount of them, alongside some fun daily and weekly challenges to try out if that's your thing. Great Gamepad integration too; I expected to have a lot of frustration with guiding the character but it was incredibly easy."

So far the story is interesting - not sure I'd call it ""good"", but I'm enjoying collecting all the hidden audiologs.  Considering Best Buy had it for $13, it was money well spent!"

wiiu,3e0toq,AdvancedBlackOps,2,Tue Jul 21 02:37:01 2015 UTC,"Highly unlikely due to the fact that keyboard/mouse has a huge advantage over controllers, which is why there are no ps4/x1 crossplat FPS games with PC."

In the end, it was totally worth it. I've already spent around 40 hours into the game and there's still so much to do, like finding all the pieces of heart, kill all the skulltulas, complete the challenges mode, as well as finding materials to upgrade each character ""masteries"" so as to unlock more moves and stuff. Even without the DLC, there are like 15 characters you can play with and they all have unique moves and different gears. Also, killing 70 enemies in one special move, is just so satisfactory, and even though it's not so hard to do so, some of the decisions you take in a mission will surely cost you the word Defeat to appear in the screen.  The only downside i can find, is the co op, the game resolutions gets lower to handle 2 players at the same time, it doesnt look that good on a big TV, but hey, at least it has co op too."

I said since we have a lot of people we need to play better couch co op games specially for people who don't drink alcohol.  Some of my colleagues brought their SO to the party and while most of them do game on either a PC, PS4 or Xbox their SO don't and just watch them most of the time.  So once I fired up the Wii U and started Nintendo Land, I asked their SO's to join us and play as its an easy game to learn as they have instructions before the start of the match.  So after a few hours they were so hooked to playing Nintendo Land > Mario Kart > Smash Bros  that even after most of us got drunk the non drinking people kept playing until morning.  Some of my colleagues mentioned that they forgot about Nintendo and how awesome their games are as most of them only know of Nintendo during their childhood (NES > SNES Era) Even my boss was happy that I found a way to make the other guests welcome by bringing my Wii U.

wiiu,3dz7wv,deeefoo,5,Mon Jul 20 18:55:28 2015 UTC,Maybe some of the settings on the tv? The after effects type of things. There is no setting on the Wii for that. Are you sure the games you are playing are supposed to be 60fps?

It's weird, because I know the TV is capable of displaying 60fps since Youtube videos streamed from my laptop can run at 60fps on it. And I know the Wii U isn't at fault, since it can run at 60fps on other TV's. Maybe there's some sort of compatibility issues between the Wii U and this particular TV?

wiiu,3dz7wv,phantomliger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:04:47 2015 UTC,Hmm. I guess it is possible that it could be related to the 720p setting...nothing definite on that though.   Why not have it set to 1080p? Unless your tv is older and doesnt have it.

Play a few minutes of single or two player (that will play at 60 FPS), then switch to three or four player (that will play at 30 FPS). If you notice a significant difference, then most likely your TV can handle 60 FPS, otherwise you might be on to something.

wiiu,3dz7wv,Starsmustshoot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:12:23 2015 UTC,Watching video at 60fps will look different. I think it's something to do with the natural motion blur between frames.   Games on the otherhand will just look smoother and won't be noticeable like video as that is losing an effect (I don't know how to describe this so don't flame me too much)   What I'm saying is that the game is most likely already playing in 50/60hz or fps and you may be expecting some different type of experience or fluidity. Without a simple way of checking fps on the Wii u I think you'll be stuck with what you have unfortunately.
wiiu,3dz7wv,InShortSight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:07:04 2015 UTC,"I figured as much. I do feel that it's lower than 60fps, since I notice an immediate improvement when I hook it up to a newer TV."

wiiu,3dz7wv,rumblpak,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:20:37 2015 UTC,"Just so you know, some tvs advertise their refresh rate based on smoothing effects, so a TV advertised as 60 might actually be 30+frame interpolation (which you'd have turned off for games since it will induce last). You would have to dig into the specs of your TV to figure out if that's the case."
wiiu,3dz7wv,Worgenite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:09:48 2015 UTC,Hmm that's interesting. All I know is that it says 60hz on the model sticker on the back of the TV. So interpolation is off for games? I don't suppose there's some magical way to turn it on?

wiiu,3duy3t,justouttoday,61,Sun Jul 19 18:50:47 2015 UTC,"I never understood dev's who blame the players when people say their game isn't good.  It's a well-known phenomenon that when you spend months or even years on something, you no longer see it as what your original vision was, you see it as your baby. It can do no wrong in your eyes. Which means for a product where everyone else's eyes matter, you need to make sure it can please them. And when it doesn't because of bad code leading to no split-screen and 30 fps, the only one to blame is him.  Does this guy not have any PR staff? I don't particularly care about playing defensive, but there's being tasteful and fessing up to something or being stupid and whiny and blaming the hardware, the controller, your audience, or literally everything else but you for a lack of success."

wiiu,3duy3t,adam_anarchist,12,Mon Jul 20 01:50:54 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have to disagree with you, I played all of Sonic Lost World after quitting many times and being told to give it more of a chance, but after level 2-1 I just found the disjointed worlds, random gimmicks, terrible plot, and random difficulty spikes unbearable. I did beat it, but it was the one of the most frustrating game sessions of my life.  Also that really has no bearing on this because the reason why people are saying it's terrible is because of technical reasons like 30fps and controller problems, not how good they actually are."
wiiu,3duy3t,C7_the_Epic,2,Mon Jul 20 02:03:07 2015 UTC,"Man, if something isn't worth your time, you shouldn't keep playing it just to say you beat it. There are plenty of other games for you out there.  As for me, I never got far with Sonic: Lost World. Not because I thought it was bad, but because it didn't interest me enough to keep coming back. I really liked the Zelda level though."

wiiu,3duy3t,C7_the_Epic,5,Mon Jul 20 04:11:18 2015 UTC,"It certainly had the potential to be a great game; the parkour - when used correctly - allows for some great tricks and Sonic has a wide variety of moves (Spin Dash, Crawl Roll, Bounce Attack, Flying Kick, Powered-Up Homing Attack) to help him out in almost any situation. It's just the game never takes advantage of that: levels are either gimmicks (Snowball! Boss Rush! Flying!), contain barely any walls, or are *shudder* 2D.  Sonic Lost World had the potential to be the best 3D Sonic game, but missed the mark by not explaining the Parkour, and not using the Parkour except for a few specific locations."

wiiu,3duy3t,plus1zero,55,Mon Jul 20 17:56:03 2015 UTC,So if I get better at the game the framerate will improve?  That's Grandmaster programming skills right there.
wiiu,3duy3t,Vayshen,24,Sun Jul 19 21:53:10 2015 UTC,"Imagine if that was in the Devil May Cry games. The game is locked at 30fps until you break past A, S gives 40, SS gives you 50, and SSS gives you the standard 60. Get hit and your back down to 30 right there. The game stays at the framerate you were at when finished the last horde until you start the next one."

wiiu,3duy3t,fiddle_n,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:20:18 2015 UTC,"The thing is, many games already are doing this. The slowdown in Zelda when you hit an enemy, or when you get hit in Mario. Makes you wonder if this concept can be further explored."
wiiu,3duy3t,NakedSandvich,9,Mon Jul 20 12:55:24 2015 UTC,"That's slowing down the animation speed, not the framerate. If a game lowered the framerate on purpose due to player performance, that would be a horrendous idea. Lowering the framerate doesn't make the game move slower, it just makes it choppier and the controls become less precise."

wiiu,3duy3t,soccerzz5,29,Sun Jul 19 19:09:52 2015 UTC,The difference is that W101's frame rate didn't run like total ass and the controls were decently responsive once you figured out the game's layout.  The problem with W101 was that it didn't do the best job at executing its unorthodox control scheme at the start of the game. Devil's Third looks like it'll be received as a shit game because it's just that: a shit game.
wiiu,3duy3t,GomaN1717,12,Sun Jul 19 19:30:39 2015 UTC,"Right. It's one thing for a game to be complex to the point of being a little player unfriendly, it's another subject when a game is just unpolished and...well, bad. Look at the kind of gameplay depth that TW101 has and you can see it's a good game, from the polish to the animations, the art style, switching abilities, keeping your combo up, etc.  Devil's Third just doesn't give off that same vibe. The animations have inappropriate weight for their actions, enemy AI seems mindless, and bosses seem crude and simplistic. Bleh."
wiiu,3duy3t,Butter_Is_Life,-2,Sun Jul 19 20:59:16 2015 UTC,Came in here to say that - The Wonderful 101's review network was about the biggest crock of shit lie I've ever had to process.   Frame rates are apparently a different story.

Whilst I don't expect him to openly denounce his own game so close to release, it's idiotic to make baseless and foolhardy defences like this. Just suck it up and bite the bullet, Itagaki."
wiiu,3duy3t,ilovesnes,6,Sun Jul 19 18:54:25 2015 UTC,"I kept hearing about Devil's Third but finally looked up more about it today. It really looks like ass and the game concept is just a typical hack and slash action game. And by the comments of bad hit detection, bad frame rates, and shitty camera it sounds like a game that should have happened in the ps2 era. The screen shots I have looked at so far are just offensive , like ride to hell retribution offensive. It is like the concept and setting are realized by a 13 year old."
wiiu,3duy3t,tails_the_gay_fox,3,Sun Jul 19 19:24:40 2015 UTC,"My gosh, it did not take long for this subreddit to turn on this title.  It was on EVERYBODY'S list of the Wii U's promising future lineup titles a year ago. Maybe because the list needed to be padded because of all the lulls. But now it's like you aren't even allowed to look forward to what could be a fun, somewhat flawed, cheesy title. I don't get it."
wiiu,3duy3t,_Burgers_,9,Sun Jul 19 23:11:00 2015 UTC,"Last year, it wasn't a couple months away from release. You can forgive bad frame rate or other bugs for when a game is announced because it might not be ready to be released. But nothing has changed with this game. And the more we see, the worse it looks. This game could have been great, it had potential. But nothing looks good about it now. Remember, promising doesn't mean good, just means it has the potential to be good."
wiiu,3duy3t,insane_contin,6,Sun Jul 19 23:47:39 2015 UTC,"It looks a little worse than ""somewhat"" flawed. If it wasn't hyped from the beginning, it wouldn't get ""turned on"". From framerate, to bland art style, to really simplistic enemy patterns and bosses. It's gonna get called out on for its very, very mediocre flaws.   Still, if you want to get it, all the power to ya. I wouldn't spend $60 on this, but hell, I spent $15 on a copy of Sonic 06 for my own sick twisted tastes (and I actually think the Sonic levels can be kinda...fun...), so who am I to judge?

We didnt have any reason to believe it hadnt until recently when the hands on impressions and videos started to come out.  I was never in the realm of excited about this game, its not really my style, but If it had gotten rave reviews or even just a mix of great and mediocre ones I may have picked it up just to check it out and support the genre on nintendo consoles. But what ive seen in footage and read from reviewers is a nightmare."
wiiu,3duy3t,thewwwyzzerdd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:16:35 2015 UTC,It could be partially because before Splatoon came out there wasn't a good 3rd person shooter on the Wii U.

This is a much more graphically intensive game than Mario or Zelda, so it's only natural that those games are able to attain 60fps while something like this can't. That being said, the game still looks awful."

wiiu,3duy3t,thismadhatter,3,Mon Jul 20 12:14:49 2015 UTC,I'm getting tired of people saying this. It looks nothing like a PS2 game. I can understand people saying it looks shitty with bad graphics for a current gen game. But PS2 graphics? No. Cut it out with that stupid circlejerk already. It's like people who say that have never even played PS2.

wiiu,3duy3t,armedcombatexpert,0,Tue Jul 21 07:39:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure it is a circlejerk. Some of the later PS2 games got incredible graphics out of that machine. The comparison is actually quite apt in another way, though. The way Devil's Third appears to approach the world is very similar to games coming out in the early 2000's. Games back then had technical limitations on their capabilities, and some of the workarounds to those gave the games from that era a certain ""look."" Look at the way Devil's Third renders its characters, those odd unnatural shoulders that don't quite seem connected to the body somehow. Notice that not a lot of detail is actually put into objects in the environment, especially objects you are going to actually hide behind - pillars are plain white, walls are just walls. It certainly feels reminiscent of hiding behind the Nth identical shipping container/barrel/wooden box, doesn't it?   So yes, the resolution is vastly better than PS2, although you aren't giving PS2 enough credit. But I also suspect you aren't giving the people who are making these comparisons nearly enough credit. In a lot of subtle ways, this game really does look more than a decade out of date."

Also, the fanbase (based off Metacritic user scores) for KZ/Knack/DC/TO are all respectively 6.9(lower than reviews)/6.5/5.9(lower than reviews)/6.7, so the fanbase hardly rates every exclusive a 10/10  EDIT: and this is coming from the fanbase that has said splatoon is the single most innovative game in the past 10 years, and the best online experience in the past two generations"

wiiu,3dsy5h,Senil888,6,Sun Jul 19 10:35:40 2015 UTC,"I used all flat paints (instead of glossy) so I could get rid of the fingerprint problem the Gamepad has. There's a slight texture but it helps with grip if anything, and no fingerprints!"
wiiu,3dsy5h,slowro,7,Sun Jul 19 12:47:14 2015 UTC,"How did you do it? Did you take it apart, use painters tape, or something else?"
wiiu,3dsy5h,mikdl,16,Sun Jul 19 04:27:44 2015 UTC,"I took it apart. It was harder than opening a Gamecube but easier than opening a Wii, I'll tell you hwat. I did use painters tape to cover over the 3 stickers on the back of the battery cover so you could still read all the info on it."

I'm glad I did too, because on my very first try not only did the paint job come out like shit but I also broke the console putting it back together.   I've done 5 Gamecubes and 3 Wiis since and I've really gotten the hang of it."

wiiu,3dsy5h,tec2030,4,Sun Jul 19 12:14:33 2015 UTC,Usually I dislike custom paint jobs. But looking at yours has changed my mind. Great work!
wiiu,3dsy5h,lskennedy,3,Sun Jul 19 15:57:59 2015 UTC,How did you make that speckled look? I love it and what to do that also! Any help would be appreciated I got it apart without any issues just wanted to see how you did that unique look!
wiiu,3dsy5h,lskennedy,5,Sun Jul 19 10:52:18 2015 UTC,"Choose a base color (I chose green this time) and get a nice solid first coat, then pick some complimentary colors (I used two other greens, a yellow and white) and dribble them; this part is tricky especially if you use cheap paint because sometimes the dribbles come out as big blobs. Then go back over it with your base color and let it dry. Sometimes you go back and dribble a second time around and then add your base again. Basically do it til you think it looks pissah."
wiiu,3dsy5h,tabriss_,3,Sun Jul 19 12:50:50 2015 UTC,When you say dribble it do you mean barely press down the nozzle of the spray paint or do you mean to like stand far away from it so the spray paint makes like a mist almost
wiiu,3dsy5h,efisherharrison,6,Sun Jul 19 13:43:05 2015 UTC,"I tend to stand far away and do the mist thing. But i have tried the other way on some Gamecubes, and it can look nice too."

wiiu,3dsy5h,Vergil387,3,Mon Jul 20 18:03:52 2015 UTC,"I saw you used flat spray paints on the gamepad, you should consider using a Krylon Clear Matte Finish to protect it. Flat doesn't clean well at all, and having just a tiny bit of shine with the Matte Finish will protect the paint job and help it clean a bit better. You shouldn't have a fingerprint problem with Matte Finish at all."

wiiu,3dsy5h,kapnkruncher,3,Sun Jul 19 17:28:34 2015 UTC,What's the actual paint you used? Branding and type.  I used to paint controllers and plenty of paints WILL NOT last when used on controllers.
wiiu,3dsy5h,fauxruination,2,Sun Jul 19 16:20:39 2015 UTC,I just use the cheapest stuff at Home Depot
wiiu,3dsy5h,regagain,3,Sun Jul 19 17:05:52 2015 UTC,I'd strongly STRONGLY suggest putting a clear coat of lacquer over that.  That paint will start to wear and smudge/rub off over use with your hands. A lacquer clear coat will help seal it for everyday use.  Auto clear coat would be best.
wiiu,3dsy5h,Theotech,3,Sun Jul 19 17:37:36 2015 UTC,Dude look awesome! Can you add some details how you did it and such?!
wiiu,3dsy5h,chricke,3,Sun Jul 19 16:30:42 2015 UTC,"I've been seriously considering just spray painting a matte finish over the game pad (dissassembled, of course) just for the fingerprint issue..."

However, I don't own the game, but I suspect there isn't a large community playing online and there is no offline multiplayer.    Realistically, if you want to play games like Watch_Dogs you're gonna need another console or a PC. Wii U is fantastic for first party games, but you'll need something else to play the rest."

You pointed out an interesting point, the new zelda game. I will get a Wii U  so I can play the new zleda game and when the NX releases, I think there will be trade in offers at gamestop or other retailers.

wiiu,3dut6h,Kazag,4,Mon Jul 20 17:01:31 2015 UTC,"The last two questions of yours along with the third one, shows that you're hesitating a lot. If you're not sure that you'll enjoy the console, maybe you shouldnt go for it. But anyway, just go ahead and ask yourself instead, do you like Nintendo? Do you like the exclusives the console already has and will have? If the answer is yes, then spend your money."
wiiu,3dut6h,Bamboo_Steamer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:41:31 2015 UTC,"Yep, I like most of them. Mario Kart 8, Super Smash Bros, Splatoon, Super Mario Bros, Bayonetta 2, the upcoming Super Mario Maker and more released and unreleased games. But my fear comes from the NX. I don't want to buy Wii U then when they announce NX next year, I realize that I did a big mistake with the Wii U.  EDIT: Why I am thinking I should get a Wii U is because I don't want to be hyped for NX which might turns out not be home console."
wiiu,3dut6h,Bamboo_Steamer,2,Sun Jul 19 18:57:50 2015 UTC,"It would be a shame to miss out on all these games you want to play then, just cause the NX name came out to be known to the public. We know nothing of it, nor when it will be released. But even if NX is gonna be released sooner than expected, it's always wise to stay away from it at the beggining, and see what it is, see how it goes, see what games it's gonna have, and maybe wait for a price drop. This way, you'll probably enjoy your Wii U for like 3 years guaranteed. I doubt the NX is gonna be Wii U compatible anyway, since there would be the need of the gamepad, and they arent being sold. So Wii U will forever be a console of it's own.  I got my Wii U like 4 months ago, me and my gf love it. Mario 3D world co-op has been a lot of fun(and annoying at times, she's bad) together."
wiiu,3dut6h,Unggoy,4,Sun Jul 19 19:28:37 2015 UTC,"Gonna skip the other questions and tell you this:  I own a PS4 and I'm a member of the PC master race.  My gf has an Xbox one so I can play that too.  I bought a Wii U over a year ago and while I don't play it all the time, it has seen more action than the PS4 and XB1.    I play it at least once a week when I'm taking a break from ESO on the PC.  The games, while not technically superior to a PS4, are exactly what Nintendo do best....they are awesomely playable.  That's what makes the WiiU a great console.  It can be picked up any time and it never feels strange.  Games are addictive and great for just passing an hour or a whole day.  Best games I have are MK8, Hyrule Warriors, Super Mario 3D world, SSB4 and Zombie U.  I especially recommend Zombie U, better than Resident Evil and super creepy.  Then you have the E-Shop.  Access to a lot of older Nintendo games from the 90's and 2000's and independent games that are amazing and reasonably priced.  Seriously, buy one."
wiiu,3dut6h,Mr_Gunboss98,2,Sun Jul 19 19:18:47 2015 UTC,I have Xbox One and I play games on PC too. I like Wii U alot but why I am hesitating is because of the NX. I don't want to realize that I made a mistake when they announce it next year.
wiiu,3dut6h,phantomliger,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:36:47 2015 UTC,"To be honest I don't think we will see the NX for another 2 years.  The reason is the WiiU has not been a commercial success in the long term.  It has picked up speed and popularity in the past year and there are new titles like Zelda that are still about a year away.  Nintendo won't be able to release another console with such slow momentum, it will have to be a success from the start and so it will be in development for a while."
wiiu,3dut6h,Mr_Gunboss98,2,Sun Jul 19 19:42:28 2015 UTC,"All games you buy are available to all accounts. I haven't played that Splinter Cell game because they removed the local co-op play from the Wii U version. It could be great, but since there may not be many players matchmaking could be a problem. But since I haven't played, don't listen to me. Since we know nothing about the NX, that's a hard question to answer. We don't know if it will be backwards compatible. All I can say is what relates to Wii U. I would suggest Pikmin 3, Mario 3D World, Nintendo Land, Wii Party U, Splatoon, and Deus Ex: Human Revolution: Director's Cut But those are just retail games. One of the best things about Wii U is the digital games. Games like Affordable Space Adventures are an absolute blast with local multiplayer. I think Wii U is really really good at local multiplayer, so if you have a lot of friends and want to entertain them, then get some Wii U party games and you'll be set. Many of them are 4, 5, or even 8 players. I have had some issue with it since I got it after launch. One is that lately it's been dropping the Internet every morning and I have to reset my router to get it back online. This may just be a router issue though. I'm not sure what's wrong. Also, make sure to take good care of your Gamepad as you pass it around the room (it gets dropped). They are over $80 from Nintendo and if they brake when you're past warranty then it sucks. Mine has a messed up joystick and I just have to deal with it now. I really enjoy the heck out of my Wii U. It's very simple to use, there are a ton of amazing Virtual Console classics on the eShop, as well as amazing indie games. The Nintendo exclusives are amazing, and the few third party games like Deus Ex are really good too. Also, the Internet Browser is probably what my family uses the most. it's surprisingly good and is one of the best ways to watch YouTube on the TV (search for videos while people watch them simultaneously). Also, Miiverse is a really fun and (usually) family safe way to interact with other gamers about games. It's fun to help out newbies, or to make funny drawings and/or screenshots from games and to look at the amazing art people make. It's something I miss on other consoles."
wiiu,3dut6h,pick-a-spot,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:06:18 2015 UTC,"Yes  It's pretty dead, but people are always looking for a match on Miiverse. I get on occasionally.

wiiu,3dut6h,HillbillyMan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:56:51 2015 UTC,"Wonderful 101, hyrule warriors are also fun games.   There's a massive library of wii games (backward compatible) if you don't mind non-hd graphics; Metroid prime, older zeldas, red steel 2, mario galaxy, re4 remake.   You need to buy the wii remote separately to play wii games. Wiimotion plus if you want to play skyward sword &  red steel 2.  For couch multiplier you need controllers...the official wiiu wireless one is pricey.   You can buy 3rd party wiimotes and the wii classic controllers (or gamecube style controllers for the wii) . These controllers have to plug into the wiimote to work.   The wiiU is good for me as I can catch up with all those wii games I missed out on. I recommend it if you get it at a good price. Got mine with smash for £170 in Xmas. The NX is going to be priced highly at launch (whenever that is) because  nintendo are just bonkers"
wiiu,3dut6h,AuraRyu,2,Sun Jul 19 19:45:33 2015 UTC,"What the NX is going to be is more or less speculation at this point so that shouldn't really be in your deciding factors imo.

wiiu,3duvtv,sjsamphex,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:20:36 2015 UTC,"personally I feel quicksaves are cheap see think harvesting Economizers in FF6, with quicksaves you can get 4-12 in a matter of hours, when without it would take weeks of hard work which was all the more satisfying once it was accomplished."
wiiu,3duvtv,antaios256,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:23:54 2015 UTC,"I know iOS has a port of the game as well but it's not the original version. While they fixed a lot of the glitches in the game, like Evasion actually working, I prefer the original with all the flaws. Plus they got rid of Vanish Doom. Can't have that :P"
wiiu,3dufhh,vyrotek,18,Sun Jul 19 16:10:13 2015 UTC,Splatfest is a lot harder because you have to play against all of the better players that usually play ranked.
wiiu,3dufhh,mikeraglow,4,Sun Jul 19 23:13:04 2015 UTC,This certainly explains a lot.
wiiu,3dufhh,iStrype,20,Mon Jul 20 04:58:48 2015 UTC,"I don't like only being able to play 3 maps and one game mode for that long, so I don't get too into it."
wiiu,3dufhh,Tyranisaur,11,Sun Jul 19 16:21:40 2015 UTC,"I think in a nutshell, the only good things about splatfests are that you get to play with the same team several times and you earn snails, not that you can't get the same benefits out of splatfest, but you earn them faster than you would earn 30k gold.  On the flip side, they are just glorified polls which can be swung by paying only when close enough. They do the same maps for 24 hours, which is too much. It's also just turf wars, which is less fun than the ranked modes in my opinion. And to top it off, the song isn't even the good. And btw, I got a lot more lag and player drop than usual. Seems like the Japanese just have better connections."
wiiu,3dufhh,milehightechie,-1,Sun Jul 19 18:43:45 2015 UTC,Seems like the Japanese just have better connections   Splatfests are regional
wiiu,3dufhh,Tyranisaur,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:39:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, which is why the connections during a splatfest will be worse."
wiiu,3dufhh,thedrizzle007,9,Mon Jul 20 22:27:32 2015 UTC,"I skipped this second one.. Not out of hatred for Splatfest, but more simply not caring. I spent most of my day last time playing and getting to Champion, and this time I just wasn't interested. I still have 24 super sea snails, and that reward just isn't interesting to me in the slightest, so I just went ahead and finished Windwaker instead"
wiiu,3dufhh,GaryAGalindo,7,Sun Jul 19 16:39:52 2015 UTC,Good choice.
wiiu,3dufhh,Butter_Is_Life,3,Sun Jul 19 20:54:23 2015 UTC,"I watched EVO and worked on my second run of Twilight Princess. I still have 10 snails and don't feel that bothered to only get a few more. It was fun, but I think the events were too close together and not something I wanted to do. I'm glad they're holding them more often for those who miss earlier ones, but once you participate in one, you're gonna be set for a while before wanting to do another, at least that's how I felt."
wiiu,3dufhh,jodansokutogeri,3,Sun Jul 19 21:02:11 2015 UTC,Evo definitely made me care about this Splatfest way less. Unfortunate timing on Nintendo's part.
wiiu,3dufhh,Unggoy,6,Mon Jul 20 03:17:36 2015 UTC,"They throw everyone into one pool, so it is a lot more diverse. You will have teams consisting of a wider range of ranks. But that could be good or bad depending on whether you have a lot of good ppl on your team or if you're the only good one.  Since it's strictly Turf War though, everyone ""wins"" more or less, depending on how good you did. Nobody can rank down, so you always get something when you play. Even if you lose, you still get a little something for your trouble.  So I don't consider it that big of a deal. It's just fun and you should just do your best for an hour or two and put it down like usual."
wiiu,3dufhh,maturra,11,Sun Jul 19 22:18:30 2015 UTC,"I like the idea, but not the execution. Honestly, it brings out the worst in players, creating this hyper-competitive vacuum for 24 - 48 hours.   Then add in the matchmaking, which sees my team consistently being populated with at least 2-3 low level players against a stacked team (10 returns to the lobby, each time it played out this way). There's no challenge, there's no sport to it - it just turns into a frustrating slaughter, as you try to play the game, and you're constantly losing because some doof is jumping straight up and down for all 3 minutes of a match.   I'm not quick to anger at all, but this Splatfest put me into a generally vile mood, to the point that I had to turn off the game before I threw my Gamepad through my TV.   All this, to have the entire event punctuated by a generally condescending results screen that says ""you lost, hope you had fun!""  Again - I love the idea, but it really turns into a toxic experience for me during these events."
wiiu,3dufhh,savageboredom,4,Sun Jul 19 20:21:10 2015 UTC,"I keep seeing this kind of complaint, but my Splatfest experience was vastly different. I experienced very few connection problems, my teammates were competent, and my opponents rarely rage quit. Overall it was incredibly enjoyable and I didn't see any of this toxicity that other people talk about."
wiiu,3dufhh,Navarath,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:29:25 2015 UTC,"I agree. I have loved the two splatfests so far and look forward to the next one. I like being able to roll with a team - after the 2nd or 3rd run, you get a feeling as to what everyone is doing and can work together more efficiently."
wiiu,3dufhh,maturra,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:14:51 2015 UTC,"And really, I'm happy to hear people had fun. It's a great idea in theory. However, there are very real problems in execution that pit a damper on the event. It's something that can be fixed with observation and planning going forward. For example, keeping ranked and Turf segregated would mitigate some of the crazy competitiveness.  Or, hell, even fixing matchmaking to ensure evenly balanced tend, like any other online shooter. Rotate the players. Ensure a generally even distribution of players by level, etc. This would smooth out the challenge curve immensely, and ensure a more enjoyable experience overall.  It's a fantastic idea that could really help to give Splatoon, as a franchise, a huge sense of identity. It just needs a few more tweaks to curb a few of the more frustrating aspects."
wiiu,3dufhh,savageboredom,2,Mon Jul 20 17:29:49 2015 UTC,"The teams are specifically why I like Splatfest. If your team is bad, just back out into the lobby and join a new one. The problem with matchmaking in Splatoon is that levels really don't correlate to skill outside of ranked. You can be a level 5 Fanboy and still be really good, it just means you don't have as many sheer matches under your belt. Likewise, a high level doesn't actually mean you're good, you just play more."
wiiu,3dufhh,maturra,0,Mon Jul 20 18:08:33 2015 UTC,"On the teaming angle: This is one of those cases where I think we'll have to agree to disagree. :) We're both on opposite ends, and I don't think either of us will budge.   However, regarding levels: While there's always the exception of someone particularly good at the game, it's pretty safe to assume that skill levels in a particular numeric level would fall on a bell curve. You have the less-skilled players taking one end, the super-skilled players taking the other, and the majority of players falling in the middle somewhere.   Likewise, for a level 20 player, we'd ideally see a similar skill curve,  due to normal distribution of skill.   What I proposed wouldn't be a perfect system, but it would improve the system overall, for both the experienced players and the newcomers alike."
wiiu,3dufhh,GaryAGalindo,4,Mon Jul 20 21:16:57 2015 UTC,I hated the map rotation this splatfest. So I avoided it like the plague. Why play my 3 least favorite stages for Splatfest?
wiiu,3dufhh,Navarath,2,Sun Jul 19 20:53:37 2015 UTC,I can't stand saltspray rig - I'm just no good at it - no matter what I try differently.
wiiu,3dufhh,Gr8NonSequitur,4,Mon Jul 20 14:16:19 2015 UTC,"I only played 3 matches, but that's all I had time for yesterday. Though I do like Splatfest, I wish they'd let you play more than that mode online during the events."
wiiu,3dufhh,nietie,4,Sun Jul 19 22:55:53 2015 UTC,"This is the first time I played a splatfest, I actually forgot it was going on.   I must say, I see no difference at all in terms of matchmaking or gameplay compared to regular games. Only thing different is the 3 map rotation instead of 2? and the free t-shirt you get.   I am only level 15 or 16. Most players I encounter are 20 but always 1 or 2 (3 if u count me) that are below. This is exactly same as Regular for me.   Besides I don't even know if there are rewards or something. So for me the Splatfest is pretty much the same as Regular."
wiiu,3dufhh,GGRain,4,Sun Jul 19 17:05:30 2015 UTC,"there is another difference: your team stays the same if nobody leaves after a match. So if you have a great team, you can get a real long winning-streak. And you play mostly against the other faction."
wiiu,3dufhh,nietie,2,Sun Jul 19 18:40:29 2015 UTC,ah yes I found that was pretty nice
wiiu,3dufhh,Senil888,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:05:17 2015 UTC,"This is what frustrated me though - my team was always bad, be it myself or the team as a whole. I never felt like the team I was on was going to win expect maybe once or twice."
wiiu,3dufhh,nietie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:53:35 2015 UTC,"I never care if my team is bad though. I usually always get most points in TURF wars on my team which is satisfying enough for me. But I guess for some this is not the case, getting destroyed a lot is not fun after all.   I must say I noticed a lot more better players than usual. I guess they came from ranked (I never played that). So Splatfest is a bit harder compared to Regular if you don't find a good team that consists of some of these players.  But for me, the overall experience is the same. I like getting the snails for the first time though."
wiiu,3dufhh,JagGentlemann,3,Mon Jul 20 07:22:33 2015 UTC,Because if 4 maps every 4 hours is bad and 3 maps in one entire day is even worse.
wiiu,3dufhh,Greater_Gamer,4,Mon Jul 20 11:57:10 2015 UTC,"The matchmaking made me stop playing yesterday, me, a level 16, a level 20, and a level 2 and 3 vs a team of all 20s. It happened for almost every game. I had to stop playing so I didn't get too angry. It's not the low levels I was angry at, it's that I was stuck in a losing game because of the other team's levels."
wiiu,3dufhh,fakewang,4,Sun Jul 19 17:04:01 2015 UTC,You were paired up with a level 2 and 3 every time? What stopped you from just going back to the lobby and getting matched with a new team?
wiiu,3dufhh,Greater_Gamer,3,Sun Jul 19 17:40:19 2015 UTC,"I tried that. Usually I got a level 2-8 on my team. The averages didn't add up. I played for about two hours, and took a few breaks, hoping the issue would be solved, but nope, low level average team versus high level average lots of times."
wiiu,3dufhh,fakewang,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:11:18 2015 UTC,"That's too bad. I played about 15 matches in a row with the same team (me, level 20, then a 12, 16, and 7), and we probably won around 14 out of 15 matches. I really liked the aspect of playing with the same people and learning their tendencies."
wiiu,3dufhh,rufio_vega,2,Sun Jul 19 18:38:01 2015 UTC,"Why avoid it if you can get shells either way? I found an awesome look for my inkling and I've been using shells to reroll and improve their abilities.  In fact, despite being on the losing end of this Splatfest, my biggest complaint is that I wasted two shells because it rolled the exact same ability layout I started with (the first time was even in the exact same order)."
wiiu,3dufhh,cardboardguru13,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:24:07 2015 UTC,"Why avoid it if you can get shells either way?   ...because it's not fun to start matches before there are 4 players on each side, and to have players get disconnected in the middle of matches (playing being dropped isn't reflected on the match results screen during Splatfest), and to experience heavy lag that doesn't exist at all every day Splatfest isn't being held."
wiiu,3dufhh,rufio_vega,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:38:22 2015 UTC,"I usually see a drop or lag most days, at least once or twice, especially in the afternoon. But I really didn't see it in Splatfest. The uneven teams at the start...yes, which was really odd. I didn't play anywhere as much this Splatfest as I did the last one, but I saw a lot of uneven teams this time while I saw none at all last time."
wiiu,3dufhh,cardboardguru13,2,Mon Jul 20 16:48:23 2015 UTC,"But I really didn't see it in Splatfest.   About a third of my matches during both Splatfests involved dropped players. Unless you see the match start with fewer than 8 players (yes, it happens!), and don't see it on the launchpad preview (players dropped before the match begins), you're not likely to notice.   You either have to see during the game that your team doesn't have 3 other players on the map, or notice that on the final results screen there's a player on the opposing team in 4th player with 0 kills and 0 deaths (and match that with a hugely lopsided score, such as 70%-20%).  Unlike during normal matches, Splatfest matches don't show dropped players on the final results screen. The dropped players are listed as if they played the whole game. And the player scores are omitted, so you can't see that a dropped player scored 0 points. These changes seem deliberate to hide this major problem.  It's a bit more obvious, though, when the other team has 3 dropped players and you've cornered the last guy at his launchpad."
wiiu,3dufhh,rufio_vega,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:36:07 2015 UTC,"It's fairly noticeable when you keep track of your opponents inkling icons on the top of the screen. Knowing when they've been removed from the field via splatting is a strategic plus. If one of their team members has been disconnected (before or during the match), one of their icons will be X'd out for the duration of the game."
wiiu,3dufhh,hutt_in_the_butt,2,Mon Jul 20 23:12:24 2015 UTC,"I really enjoy Splatfest. There is a rotation of 3 maps instead of just 2, and everything looked different than usual. I played way more during Splatfest than I normally do, and see no negatives about it."
wiiu,3dufhh,bookchaser,2,Sun Jul 19 18:29:57 2015 UTC,"My family's first Splatfest was a horrible gaming experience. For the second Splatfest, we played about a dozen games to be sure Nintendo hadn't fixed the problems, and then we played MK8 instead. (I tested Splatfest that night, and my kids tested it in the morning.)  We would prefer Splatfests stop being held until Nintendo fixes the problems because it takes Splatoon away from us for an entire day (it takes away the fun of playing Splatoon... we don't get kicked from matches, but players in many, many of our matches do.)."
wiiu,3dufhh,Hurinfan,2,Mon Jul 20 03:58:43 2015 UTC,I had awful lag the whole time through. I have more than enough cash and snail thingies so I might skip the next one.
wiiu,3dufhh,cardboardguru13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:19:33 2015 UTC,"My impression is that when the serious lag hits, players get dropped. I had all of my teammates get disconnected during one bout where I was getting killed because my ink wasn't appearing until many seconds after I shot it out."
wiiu,3dufhh,cardboardguru13,2,Mon Jul 20 15:17:40 2015 UTC,I'm over Splatfest. Normal everyday Splatoon works most of the time. But Splatfest Splatoon doesn't work as it's supposed to most of the time. They even seem to have tweaked the results screen to obscure the fact that players get dropped during the matches.
wiiu,3dufhh,cardboardguru13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:57:44 2015 UTC,Oh? I haven't noticed the result screen changes. Do you have an example? It is pretty frustrating to see at the end that the reason the match was so intense is because you were down a team member.  I'm not sure what the solution to dropped people is. Would it be better to just stop the match? I'd rather not waste my time playing a match I can't win.
wiiu,3dufhh,milehightechie,2,Mon Jul 20 19:17:33 2015 UTC,"The result screen change only occurs during Splatfest, so I can't do a screenshot now.  There are three changes:   Dropped players remain on the scoreboard. Individual scores for all players aren't shown. Your personal score for the match appears in the upper left-hand corner of one of the screens; I'm not sure if it's on the result screen, but nobody else sees it.   The big issue is that you can't easily identify dropped players because you can't see who has a score of 0 at the end of the match."
wiiu,3dufhh,Dragonzeanse,2,Mon Jul 20 19:35:04 2015 UTC,"It's because Splatfest enables teams that are winning to stay together.  In regular modes, the teams are switched up, even if everyone stays in the lobby between games.  But during splatfest, if you wind up with a team of pros and end up dominating game after game, you can stay with that team (and they will also likely stay) and no one gets switched around.   After a good string of matches, it's very possible that a very strong team could form and stick with it together for the long haul. This is why you see so many people with insane amounts of flags for winning streaks.   And it's also why some folks on the losing teams are feeling the sting because they may very well have come across a team that has been playing strongly together and is dedicated to winning.  It takes a LOT of games to max out the top rank in Splatfest. It took me about 3-4 hours and I lost a handful of games. So there's that aspect as well. it's not for everyone, but it's the only way (as of now) to get Super Sea Snails. Can't let Spyke down, can we?"
wiiu,3dufhh,dustymons,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:36:16 2015 UTC,Ah! I didn't know half of this. So do people end up leaving and rejoining the Splatfest often in order to try and get on a new team if they think their current one sucks?
wiiu,3dufhh,Senil888,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:19:17 2015 UTC,"I dived right in to help my team. This time, it was much more evenly-split in terms of both popularity and victory, which was nice. I was on the losing team (Iwata Slides), but it was a fun time regardless. Even if you don't think you'll win, it's worth trying to play to get the King rank so you can maximize the sea snails you get at the end. It gets frustrating when you end up losing and contributing to the other team, but I was in more winning matches than losing ones, so I definitely helped, even if it was half a percent. :)"

Not being able to have fun while losing is simply a sign of poor sportsmanship.  The problem is that Nintendo isn't making Splatfests diverse, because even as someone who does pretty well Splatoon Splatfest 2 wore me out. I was having fun the whole time during the first one because of the novelty of it and I thought it was going to be a more rare occurrence, but making less than once a month is a terrible idea. I'll probably be skipping the next Splatfest entirely as well."

The rest of the time, the majority of players are from Japan. If Splatoon can support all-North American players, why the hell am I matched with Japan the rest of the time?"
wiiu,3dufhh,jodansokutogeri,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:28:21 2015 UTC,"Because Splatoon is world-wide matchmaking most of the time. If you're only getting to play with JP players for the most part that means you're getting on too late or there simply aren't enough US players constantly paying, neither of which Nintendo has direct control over. Splatfest attracts enough NA to have regional match-making because it's a special occasion, and if Splatfest was an every weekend thing matchmaking would be significantly more difficult as it wouldn't be pulling people back in.  Also out of curiosity why the attachment to players from your region? If there was voice chat I could understand, but the unfortunate lack of that feature makes everyone's nationality in this game irrelevant."
wiiu,3dufhh,cardboardguru13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:27:54 2015 UTC,"neither of which Nintendo has direct control over.   Nintendo has direct control over who it matches me with. Splatfest shows there are more than enough North American players (I doubt the increase in players on this one day is responsible for it).   I have to think I'm being paired with Japan (at all times of day) due to ping rates. As in, Japan is the smaller pool of players and they'll throw in overseas people who can handle it.  I've noticed that I never get dropped from a game, even during Splatfest when I get serious lag and all of my teammates get dropped, I never do.   why the attachment to players from your region?   I have no personal attachment to regional players. The issue is lag. I would surely have a faster connection to a domestic server populated by players in my region. This is true of all online FPS and 3PS games. The last thing a player wants is to get stuck with an overseas player with a high ping rate, and here I am playing with mostly overseas players."

No, if you play consistently at night you should know there are significantly more JP players than NA players and it's simply unavoidable getting matched with them alot unless you're extremely lucky. Again, Nintendo has no direct control over who is playing at each moment in the day, and they can't just say ""looks like /u/cardboardguru is on, better only match him with only NA players"""

wiiu,3duier,vivalavendredi,5,Sun Jul 19 16:36:41 2015 UTC,Sounds like its something with your setup causing that. I did more than a full play through (50+ hours) and all the audio came from my stereo as well as the pad. Make sure you try the spider tank virtual trip mini game its a blast.
wiiu,3duier,ThyKracken,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:11:51 2015 UTC,"I am much more a fan of 'Alone'. It is tough, and puts your skills to the test."
wiiu,3duier,reali-tglitch,3,Sun Jul 19 22:08:02 2015 UTC,"That's kind of odd. I know for my version of the game, it's really more that the sound mixing is off. Gunshots and ambient SFX are REALLY loud, but the voices are not as loud. And also, audio seems to be delayed half a second or so compared to what's going on on-screen. It's not the best port, all things considered. Maybe check your audio balance levels and try turning up voices or down the other SFX."
wiiu,3duier,_Burgers_,2,Sun Jul 19 17:31:31 2015 UTC,Some Wii U games have issues with surround systems from what I understand. Can you set your system to stereo?
wiiu,3duier,RTGoldfish,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:58:07 2015 UTC,I will give it a try. Thx for all your suggestions
wiiu,3duier,Waggy777,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:33:57 2015 UTC,"To be more specific, you should not be using the surround sound option in Wii U settings unless you're directly connecting to a surround sound AVR via HDMI."
wiiu,3duier,Waggy777,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:01:32 2015 UTC,"Ah, this seems to be the problem. I am using a dolby surround via digital out from TV into a Surround decoder. Strange, is that WD is the only game with that problem, but via HDMI the problem is gone. Thx mate"
wiiu,3duier,HydraSquid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:57:54 2015 UTC,"AFAIK, the only way a TV will allow you to take HDMI 5.1 in and output 5.1 via TOSLINK or S/P-DIF is if it specifically offers that support, and even then it will only work with Dolby encoding (and core 5.1). This means LPCM 5.1, which is the only surround format the Wii U supports, is not able to be passed through any TV. What happens is the TV itself will only output 2 of the 6 channels it receives (I believe front L+R) and since most dialogue is contained within the center channel you then miss out on much of the important audio. I'm pretty sure the output it sends to the receiver would be the same (that is, just 2 channels, and it would be front L+R)."
wiiu,3duier,theliphant,3,Mon Jul 20 15:46:47 2015 UTC,"On the PC version of Watch Dogs, I had problems with surround sound. Some audio wouldn't play unless I toggled surround sound on my headset. I'm not sure if it is at all related to the Wii U version, though."
wiiu,3duier,limjorino,2,Sun Jul 19 20:04:20 2015 UTC,Sounds like your wiiU is set to surround setup while your setup certainly doesn't support that. The only way to have surround sound in WiiU games is through an LPCM 5.1 capable receiver through HDMI.

I'm not sure if your hotel allows it but if you need to access some specific pages that your internet does not allow you all you have to do is call their concierge of they get it done locally or they would forward you over to their service provider.  Typically hotels get internet service providers like Docomo and they have the ability to open specific ports or allow certain pages that you need to access.

wiiu,3dqorv,tonymayo,31,Sat Jul 18 15:14:38 2015 UTC,I've had mine about a year.  It honestly looked brand new when I received it and I haven't had/noticed a single issue with it.  No scratches or hardware issues at all.  Highly recommend.

Some require more controllers than come with the system.  Ultimately though, it's a bunch of Nintendo-themed tech demos thrown into a hub world, stitched together, and called a party game.  It's great to try out, but I would never suggest buying it on its own."

wiiu,3dqorv,GomaN1717,8,Sun Jul 19 02:52:04 2015 UTC,"Just gonna chime in and agree with what everyone else is commenting here. I think most refurbished Wii U's are just brand new consoles that may have had a minor, easily fixable defect that barred them from being sold as ""new"" to retailers.   So, refurbished Wii U's are more or less brand spanking new."
wiiu,3dqorv,ctskifreak,4,Sat Jul 18 15:40:50 2015 UTC,"Bought mine a few months ago - I did the one that came with Nintendoland and Super Mario 3D World, and then threw in the Mario Kart 8 Bundle on there. No issues what so ever."
wiiu,3dqorv,Happypumkin,4,Sat Jul 18 17:50:30 2015 UTC,"They are basically brand new and I highly suggest it.  On a side note, I got told off by nintendo support for sending one to a friend so don't do that apparently."

wiiu,3dqorv,BigZman95,3,Sat Jul 18 19:23:15 2015 UTC,I have a gaming PC and an Xbox One and I'm so glad I bought a Wii U. IMO it's worth it for Super Smash Bros. and Mario Kart 8 alone. And when you have people over it's great.
wiiu,3dqorv,The_Redditective,-19,Sun Jul 19 01:51:45 2015 UTC,"Not excuses, just reasons. The system is dead. Save your money."
wiiu,3dqorv,Cyclops7747,9,Sat Jul 18 18:26:36 2015 UTC,"I beg to differ. We've already got Mariokart 8, SSB4, Splatoon, Super Mario 3D World, Bayonetta, and plenty of others. We've also got a bunch of awesome games coming, including Mario Maker, Starfox Zero, Xenoblade X, and a brand new Zelda game just to name some off the top of my head.   All and all, I realize the library is a bit small and not many games have really taken advantage of the Wii U's potential, but it really isn't dead in the water. $200 is a really good price in my humble opinion."
wiiu,3dqorv,The_Redditective,-7,Sat Jul 18 19:34:24 2015 UTC,"For a console that is 3 years old almost, has 0 third party support and the only games that come out are generic rehashes of old franchises. Yeah, no. That's pitiful for the age of the console. You have to be a diehard nintenyearold to think the wiiu is worth 200 dollars.  I'll give it Bayonetta 2, W101, Xenoblade and Splatoon. That's it. Zelda is probably going to get pushed onto the Shill NX."
wiiu,3dqorv,thewaitaround,5,Sat Jul 18 19:37:05 2015 UTC,Umm do you really come to the sub called Wii U just to shit on the console that everyone subscribed to the sub clearly likes? What do you get out of this?

wiiu,3dqorv,kupovi,3,Sat Jul 18 22:54:46 2015 UTC,"Having 3rd party support would mean something if any of those games were worth a damn.  For argument sake, lets say that they are. It's not hard to pick up those titles on a PC/PS4/XB1/PS3/Xbox360 as a primary console.  Nintendo games you can't get anywhere else. In my mind, that makes it all the more valuable. - Sony has little worthy exclusives and Microsoft has even less. PC has the most; and it's the cheapest to pick up. - In most cases, PC + Wii U is the best overall deal.   Regardless, I can pick up any of those prestigious 3rd party titles on any of these platforms I just happen to have. I can only find Nintendo quality on their box."
wiiu,3dqorv,Cyclops7747,5,Sun Jul 19 00:22:17 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I agree the library is a bit lacking/small. But none of the games I listed are generic rehashes honestly. The third party support is a joke, but this isn't something new that came with the Wii U.   And the new Zelda has already been confirmed to be coming to the Wii U. We know next to nothing about the NX, so Im really not worried about it at this point. I've been saying the same things as you for quite a while, but after seeing this $200 price I became pretty interested."
wiiu,3dqorv,JarlaxleForPresident,2,Sat Jul 18 19:40:40 2015 UTC,$200 is like 2 1/2 days work at minimum wage. That's like working for a weekend for a new  console. $200 really isnt a lot of money anymore.
wiiu,3dqorv,ryanghappy,2,Sun Jul 19 04:08:00 2015 UTC,"I hate to agree, but it feels like a system has failed if you can really consider a handful of games on the system a must play during the entire life span of the product. That being said, there have been some amazing games for it."

I also picked up the game pad stand and charging cradle on Amazon (through Amazon not third party) for like $2 back in February. All in all though I've been completely satisfied with mine.

I was trying to click tv-off mode (I never play on the TV) and must have hit new game accidentally :( I only had 200 lums by then so it wasn't the end of the world, but I was sad for a whole day (then binge-played until I got to that level again).  Now I always make sure to just hit Continue and switch to TV off within the game but there's always a mild angst that it'll erase everything (and I'm at 600+ lums)."

wiiu,3dt3ct,marxthasoloist,15,Sun Jul 19 04:47:32 2015 UTC,Love the motion controls. I mostly use them for up/down and short-range left/right so I can fire where I need too. Any farther and I use the right stick to shift my camera left/right.
wiiu,3dt3ct,Senil888,2,Sun Jul 19 04:53:19 2015 UTC,Ditto
wiiu,3dt3ct,redDKtie,12,Sun Jul 19 15:08:00 2015 UTC,I love the motion controls. Helps me with lots of quick turns for shooting and dodging.
wiiu,3dt3ct,chronus13,7,Sun Jul 19 05:02:35 2015 UTC,"When I started, I just used dual analog sticks since thats what I'm used to. Then after reading a watching some videos it looks like motion controls are the way to go. I'm still getting used to them, but what really helped me was only using the motion controls for small aiming corrections. You can still use the right stick to turn left and right for the most part, then use the gyro controls for up/down and slight aiming adjustments.  Hope that helps."
wiiu,3dt3ct,coldsprunk,5,Sun Jul 19 05:07:06 2015 UTC,Yes
wiiu,3dt3ct,chivasgoyo,5,Sun Jul 19 05:16:35 2015 UTC,I thought I hated motion controls...until I turned them off. I played one match without and turned them back on right away. It's something you don't realize you use a lot until you don't have it on.
wiiu,3dt3ct,thesteve9x,5,Sun Jul 19 07:30:50 2015 UTC,"Motion controls are amazing! It felt weird at first and definitely took a few days to get used to it, but now the controls are just an extension of my mind and so feel like I'm aiming with a mouse. I'm really shocked it works as well as it does. My number one concern with this game going in were gonna be the aiming controls and Nintendo totally nailed it!"
wiiu,3dt3ct,crono333,5,Sun Jul 19 13:47:08 2015 UTC,"Not to come off as too cocky, but I think I've reached the point where for the most part I can't lose a fair 1v1 against someone using full analog controls.  It's just such an extreme disadvantage."
wiiu,3dt3ct,subtlefuge,9,Sun Jul 19 14:02:18 2015 UTC,"I play with it and can never go back to dual stick controls. The general sentiment on /r/Splatoon is that if you are comfortable with them, they are much more faster and precise."
wiiu,3dt3ct,TheDizzyness,7,Sun Jul 19 04:50:38 2015 UTC,"If you want to be any good at the game. I really think motion controls is the only way to do that.  I play the game a lot and I watch streamers who play it a lot. I noticed that the stick-only players are really slow and rigid with their camera. - Where players using motion are very fluid in their movements.   The motion controls are nice for Splatoon because you can use small flicks of the wrist to adjust where you are aiming quickly. I can splat up and down walls or up and down corridors easily. I can also spin my character around pretty quickly left and right with motion.   At the same time, you aren't JUST using motion controls. You still use the right-stick to move around and it really feels nice having both.   But when it comes down to it. Stick controls won't make you a better player. It really doesnt hurt to keep motion controls on. You just keep your hands still and use the stick to look around and it feels normal. You do subtle movements with motion controls and it really makes a difference.  When you get into one-on-one scuffles with ink flying everywhere and you guys are just dancing in circles around each other trying to kill the other; the motion controls can really make or break it.. I dont think a stick-only player would be able to win in that situation. Its just too slow imho.  Hope you make up your own mind tho!"
wiiu,3dt3ct,kupovi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:51:57 2015 UTC,Not entirely true. Vertical axis is locked on the right stick when motion controls are on. So you can't leave motion controls on and use dual stick controls normally.
wiiu,3dt3ct,tw04,2,Tue Jul 21 18:44:48 2015 UTC,Test it and try it for a day of Splatoon then switch back to dual stick if you're familiar with that method like how you do it on other shooters but the difference is there is no Aim Assist on Splatoon like you have on CoD games for console.  I tried both and chose the motion controls.  Fits like a glove!
wiiu,3dt3ct,YuriusFarrence,2,Sun Jul 19 06:35:06 2015 UTC,Always motion. Unless I want to feel stuck in mud. Then I turn off motion and turn the sensitivity all the way up.
wiiu,3dt3ct,apimpnamedgekko,2,Sun Jul 19 09:49:04 2015 UTC,"I personally don't even have time to try it with two sticks. It's just too good as it is. I'm still pretty new, and I'm having difficulties with some lateral slowness... but this'll work itself out as I master when to motion control left/right and when to analog stick it."

Also, Motion Controls are far more direct then analog sticks."
wiiu,3dt3ct,Neudious,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:45:05 2015 UTC,Dual-Stick. I can't stand motion controls in most games unless it's a Wiimote.
wiiu,3dt3ct,armedcombatexpert,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:32:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can't play the game without them. I started with the motion controls on and while it took a little while to really get used to them they really are the only way to get precision movements and fast up and down movements down.  As someone else mentioned it is just a more fluid way to play the game."
wiiu,3dt3ct,SocialDissent,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:51:51 2015 UTC,"Nope, dual stick."
wiiu,3dt3ct,shawntails,2,Mon Jul 20 23:12:24 2015 UTC,I play without them. Most people use motion controls. For me it feels odd and the gamepad feels heavy after awhile so i play dual analog. I'm A+ ranked so it is up to you.
wiiu,3dt3ct,Prophet6000,-1,Sun Jul 19 10:40:48 2015 UTC,Did they fix it so you can move left/right and up/down with motion? That really annoyed me at launch.
wiiu,3dt3ct,G3ck0,0,Sun Jul 19 08:06:42 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who religiously sticks with dual sticks? I'm a veteran at FPS games and always used a controller wherever I go. This game is no exception either, despite what benefits motion controls would have to offer.  I'm a Roller main first, and a mid-long range main second. Aiming is the least of my concerns since I'm the type of player that doesn't like to stay in one spot. If I see an opportunity to strike up close, I'll make sure that window is wide and clear and splat my opponents away. All I need in this game is quick reaction time, anticipation, and readiness.  Whether you're using motion controls or not, you'll more than likely gain the upper hand at taking me down. But that's only if we're in a 1v1 showdown. Remember, this is a game where teamwork and chemistry play an important factor than just silly control gimmicks. IMO, most people use motion controls only because they're either following the general consensus that motion controls will make you a better player, or they don't have steady thumbs and fidget alot when put under pressure. If the spur of the moment makes you really nervous, then you should focus on relaxing yourself and staying calm throughout the match.  Smh, I swear I don't understand how this stigma of using motion controls to become better blew out of proportion, but a lot of motion control users on here apparently get too cocky about it. It just feels like one big giant placebo for people that are under-performing to cope with their inability to learn their weapons strong/weak points and use those key points to their advantage.  tl;dr Discussions about whether using motion controls is better or not is the dumbest thing, overdrawn, beaten to death horse that people can't seem to get over. Just play with controls that make you feel comfortable, but don't just play with controls that everyone else is using just because you think it'll make you better as well."

Everyone is freaking out about it being 'cringey' or some adolescence shit.  The self esteem issue has to deal with the fact that everyone here thinks wearing clothes gives you value.

wiiu,3ds1i7,toonpik7,-1,Sun Jul 19 06:02:53 2015 UTC,"I am SO GLAD the European versions don't do that. Nintendo won't decide which games are special to me, and if I put them all on a shelf Nintendo won't decide which ones stand out. If I want one to stand out I'll figure out a way to do it. I'll tell you one thing, I definitely DO NOT want Mario Kart to stand out. I don't even like that game."
wiiu,3ds1i7,NeatNit,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:51:28 2015 UTC,"If you don't like Mario Kart, then it's probably not on your shelf. So what does it matter if it stands out?"

wiiu,3ds1i7,FlurgyDurg,2,Sun Jul 19 00:53:36 2015 UTC,Yep might fool a few people. Luckily in Japan its amazon exclusive so people will know what they are getting into when they search for it.
wiiu,3ds1i7,bigblackhotdog,8,Sun Jul 19 04:34:06 2015 UTC,"This, like Bayonetta before it, isn't really Nintendo embracing mature games so much as it is them supporting experienced Japanese developers. I don't think theres a real push for mature games."
wiiu,3ds1i7,RatSnakeRabbitSnake,5,Sat Jul 18 23:16:13 2015 UTC,"Why, though? It's not like they haven't published M games before."
wiiu,3ds1i7,boopaboopa,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:15:48 2015 UTC,"Disney did the same thing in the 80s with Touchstone Pictures using them to handle more mature films so the regular Walt Disney name would remain associated with family friendly fare.  As to whether maintaining that type of image would actually be good for Nintendo is a different matter. Nintendo goes on about how they are focusing on families and offer content for kids that nobody else does, but I think they just don't understand that companies like Microsoft and PlayStation aggressively target kids, just using properties aimed at teens/adults because don't we all know if kids want one thing more than anything it is to be more like grown-ups.  I think the Wii U is proof that parents who use consoles as babysitters don't care what types of games their kids are playing as long as it shuts them up. Any parent who wants to game with their children is probably the kind of person who checks ratings. I don't see what benefit such a publishing label would carry."

Depends on completion of collecting items. It's not too difficult, but it gets expansive and real fun. I can recommend it. It's a pretty good imitation of a Metroid game. It's got a lot of jokes, too. They're pretty punny sometimes, though."
wiiu,3dsefg,skarznomore,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:07:39 2015 UTC,"Shantae is good and all but Guacamelee, easily. It's just a way better game and feels a lot fresher. Shantae's a good choice (although not the best in the series) if you want a fun adventure and aren't concerned with challenge (since it's a total breeze if you collect/buy items as they make you virtually indestructible), whereas Guacamelee is a bit more demanding but also more fun and rewarding."
wiiu,3dsefg,seluropnek,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:08:18 2015 UTC,"I have both, finished Shantae and halfway done on Guacamelee.  If you can pick up both due to the sale go and do it!  Shantae has awesome catchy music and just right difficulty, the good thing about Guacamelee though is the 2 player co op that Shantae doesn't have so if you have another friend that can play with you get that instead."

Worlds 6,7 and 8 are great, and then worlds 9,10,11 and 12 are phenomenal. You owe it to yourself to keep playing. Btw, Tropical Freeze is still better IMO.

The difficulty level does ramp up rather slowly, but gets there eventually.  The post credit worlds are definitely the most challenging.  I found DK:TF very enjoyable, but only solo.  I didn't like it at all as a couch co-op."

Some of the later levels were extremely frustrating as co-op, and we got my 16yo son to beat them for us, but he'd only do it if we'd let him go solo. lol  My 7yo definitely became a huge detriment to progress after world 2 or 3."

wiiu,3dsd1o,Aperture-Employee,3,Sun Jul 19 06:47:52 2015 UTC,I wasn't too impressed either at first and wondered what all the hype was about. Then I kept playing... Amazing game! Don't give up on it yet!

The first world is pretty easy, but it gets more challenging.   I recommend standing up and using off-tv play & motion controls VR-style during the Captain Toad levels, I find it a lot more fun.   You didn't like the Toad level? You don't like Plessy? I just don't comprehend people who don't like this game, it's so delightful."

wiiu,3dqwbv,Canuckle777,3,Sat Jul 18 22:24:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Nintendo is very good at trying not to disappoint fans.   The WiiU will be profitable for them, especially when Zelda is released.

wiiu,3dqwbv,111987,13,Sat Jul 18 23:14:29 2015 UTC,"I think the Xbox One is going to have some pretty great exclusives in the near future. Refurbished Wii U's are $200, so if you can, maybe you oughta just go that route.   As for the Wii U, I would recommend buying it only if you think the games currently out are worth picking up. There are a lot of great ones, but you don't want to buy a Wii U expecting, say, Mario Galaxy 3 or Metroid Prime 4, and then be disappointed when/if they don't come out.  The truth is, there doesn't seem to be a huge number of games coming out for the Wii U in the near future. Super Mario Maker looks fantastic, but Wooly World got a slightly mixed reception, Xenoblade is not for everyone, and Star Fox is a big unknown at this point. Beyond that, we know very little about Zelda Wii U; it could be amazing, but it also could be meh.   So in short, if you like the current library of games and can afford it, go get yourself a Wii U.  EDIT: The current trade-in value for an Xbox One at Gamestop is $140 cash, or $175 trade credit. Personally my XB1 is worth more than that, but ultimately it's your call."
wiiu,3dqwbv,111987,5,Sat Jul 18 23:24:05 2015 UTC,"Wasn't aware of the $200 refurb deal before starting this thread, really good to know.  Yeah the trade in value is super low and if I want the refurb deal I'd have to go cash, which is even worse. I'm just missing that Nintendo gameplay - it's a scratch that Sony or Microsoft can't itch."
wiiu,3dqwbv,thegamerpad,4,Sat Jul 18 20:18:18 2015 UTC,"Totally understand, Nintendo experiences are very unique. I just think from a monetary viewpoint, the XB1 trade-in just isn't worth it.   You might want to check out Rare Replay if you haven't already. It has a lot of excellent, Nintendo-y games that you can play on the XB1, and it's only $30 (I believe if you pre-order it, you'll get a $10 Microsofot gift card as well). That could be a cheaper way of scratching that Nintendo itch. Rare Replay comes out August 4th, so quite soon!"
wiiu,3dqwbv,Black_Suit_Matty,-1,Sat Jul 18 16:37:04 2015 UTC,More than likely down the line there will be a XBox One slim/remodel in a year or two that will help MS reduce the losses they had to take by dropping the current model so much so quickly.  Edit: Why was this downvoted?  Is it not likely that Microsoft will release a slim/redesigned XB1 at some point?  Something that will be cheaper to manufacturer (probably doesn't support Kinect at all) and will be more profitable at $350?
wiiu,3dqwbv,ForestKing,9,Sat Jul 18 17:10:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't see the need in having a One and a PS4, though I went the other way, I love my One and there's only one game I would play on the PS4, but a WiiU offers a unique experience, just be prepared for long gaps of nothing coming out."

wiiu,3dqwbv,boopaboopa,3,Sat Jul 18 16:54:16 2015 UTC,"Yah I'd say you'll probably be making a good move trading it in, where you'll still have your PS4 for all of the multiplatform stuff. The Wii U has a couple dozen or so really awesome titles that are already out that you can enjoy while waiting for the release of Super Mario Maker, Xenblade Chronicles X, Star Fox Zero, Fatal Frame V, Mario Tennis, Zelda Wii U, and others."
wiiu,3dqwbv,Zsaber,4,Sat Jul 18 22:50:46 2015 UTC,"I own all three current gen consoles and a gaming pc rig. If I didn't own a Wii U but still the other two and knew what I know right now, I'd definitely trade in my XB1 for a Wii U. MCC barely works and I am absolutely done with Sunset Overdrive (although I LOVED it) so I don't think I've touched my XB1 in about a month and a half.   My biggest concern stems from E3 this year   Eh, the Digital Event was lacking but we're still getting solid titles like XCX, Fatal Frame, Star Fox, etc. The Treehouse and actual games at the event were much more than just what we saw in the Digital Event. Don't count the Wii U out yet. We don't even know if the NX will be a console yet. I mean.. most likely, but they will announce it then release it two years after next E3 so the Wii U still has life left."
wiiu,3dqwbv,Technofreak301,6,Sat Jul 18 17:06:33 2015 UTC,"My personal opinion. Rather the trade the ps4. Yeah you have some exclusive titles. But technology wise the xbox is more unique with its kinect. But obviously that's up to you.  If possible just grab the wii u and add it to all 3. That may seem greedy, but if you can afford it why not. But again up to you.  With regard to the wii u itself, yes the e3 presentation wasn't user amazing. And there are not a lot of new games coming up towards the ""apparent"" end of the consoles life. But you know what, who cares. I got my wii u 2 months ago.  And the backlog of available games is enough to keep you going. Even just exclusives wise, Mario kart, smash, bayonetta, Mario3d etc etc. So there may not be a lot of new upcoming. But there are still good ones. So the library is still vast.  Anyway whatever your choice, I hope it's what makes you happy and keeps you entertained!"

MK8, SM3DW, SM4SH, SPLATOON, PIKMIN 3, DK: TF, BAYONETTA 1&2, TLoZ:WW, Xenoblade X, etc etc etc etc.   IMHO any console is only worth the investment if the software value exceeds the hardware value. I currently still feel burnt by my PS4 purchase because my gaming pc can play everything the ps4 has yet offered (for substantially less cost per game) with maybe 3 exceptions. Microsoft spent this entire e3 explaining to me why I am not their customer. I'm super psyched for Gears......on PC..where I will play it on higher graphical settings than the Xbone is ever going to be capable of.

It seems to me that the future of Wii U is entirely Zelda and Xenoblade. However, that's not to say the Wii U isn't worth it. It's got amazing stuff on it still - I've absolutely loved Mario Kart 8, Smash Bros, Nintendoland, Splatoon, Hyrule Warriors, Super Mario 3DW and Bros Wii U. Others will include Pikmin 3 and DKC Tropical Freeze.   If I were you, I'd sell the Xbone on Craigslist to get the most from it - I've seen PS4s regularly for full price, but I've never looked at Xbox. I'd say if you sell it for $50 less than retail, someone will pick it up quick. Then you can buy the $200 refurbished Wii U from Nintendo and have a little cash left over for games.

Because if you are expecting unannounced, unreleased ones like Metroid Prime, F Zero, Fire Emblem for Wii U etc then don't do it.  But if you do like the ones that are currently out go ahead and get it.  Instead of a trade in though just go and sell either your Xbox One or PS4 and that depends on which console you have more games on and are looking forward to more of their exclusives that are coming this year and early next year.  If it would be me I'd stick with the PS4 and sell the Xbox One then buy a 32gb Refurb Wii U from the NA online store and get the one with the bundled Wind Waker if you are playing solo or get the one with Nintendo Land if you play with a lot of friends."

Get a $200 Wii U refurbished and play the great games out for it. The other two consoles are gonna be bringing out the heavy hitters soon, you really don't want to bail as they come into their own. Even if you don't like Halo or Gears, Xbox One still has rare replay, fora, and tomb raider coming this year alone. Also, backwards compatibility gives you access to a huge library.

Nintendo home consoles average a 5 year lifespan. Never once have they released one prior to 5 years, and only a couple of times have they lasted 6 years, so the Holiday Season of 2017 would be my bet for the NX."

wiiu,3dqr8n,KarlHungusAmongUs,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:50:08 2015 UTC,"The Wii U pro controller is my preference.  The only bad thing about the Wii U pro controller is that it does not have analog shoulder buttons.  That is a design flaw and a bad decision on Nintendo's part for Wii U.  The point is kind of moot because Nintendo hasn't really used analog shoulder input since Gamecube.  The classic controller had analog shoulder buttons but I don't think they were fully utilized, and they removed them in the classic controller pro for standard digital shoulder buttons.  So basically if Nintendo decided to allow Gamecube games on virtual console for Wii U, and were able to have Wii accessories run in Gamecube mode, and allowed analog shoulder input from wii classic controllers, then the classic controller would have 1 thing over the Wii U Pro controller.  In any other scenario the Wii U Pro controller is a better controller.  But, I will say on Virtual Console you can only get the true SNES experience with the classic controller."
wiiu,3dqr8n,sendhelp,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:21:00 2015 UTC,"Although the pro controller is probably better overall, I really like both of them. I use the pro controller for Wii U titles, and the Wii classic controller for VC games that were either on SNES or NES, such as EarthBound, Super Mario Kart, and PAC-MAN. Although the stick placement is definitely better on the Pro controller than Classic controller, I usually use the d-pad on the classic controller anyway since it was on the older controllers, so the stick placement doesn't really bother me. Although you could use the pro controller for everything, I definitely like having the classic controller for just whenever"

Each JRPG game takes place in it's own world with unique society and lore. Many of them have the classic rpg battle mechanics; but then there are many that do something totally different. - Some take place in the future, some in the past, some in modern times. - There are so many different styles and unique elements.   I would suggest above all that if you don't like Chrono Trigger, don't dismiss the rest of the genre. - The SNES had many fantastic JRPGs and the same can be said for the Playstation 1 and 2.  You will find one you like. - The bigger question is what type of movies and games do you like; because that will make finding the RPG for you that much easier"

I don't enjoy Turn Based all that much.  But paper Mario was simply different. The addition of a simple, but useful mechanism to increase damage, where you press a button or do something when attacking, helps a lot to get you into the game while your turn (or the enemy's) is on. It is a JRPG, but doesn't really feel like one.   So for a start, go with it! If you enjoy it, delve deeper into the grounds of JRPGs like Chrono Trigger :)"

The Mario and Luigi games are a nice spot if you're looking to dip your feet in the shallow end. If you liked the classic top-down zelda games, there's a whole bunch of games for the SNES that add more RPG elements to that formula. Maybe give Secret of Mana a try. If you're up for a more story-intensive game, try Grandia or Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky, they'll last you at least 40 hours and each have a nice twist to the tired old turn-based battles you know from pokemon."

wiiu,3dmr43,nolaredditor,38,Fri Jul 17 22:22:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly, so many super core fanboys crap on more powerful hardware with this ""diminishing returns"" argument and how photo-realistic games aren't fun.   While better hardware can bring us closer to that type of realism it can also free developers from constraints that might prevent even a stylized cartoon world to exist. Wouldn't Splatoon be even better if it supported 1080p @ 60fps with 4 player splitscreen? Better hardware could deliver that. How about Mario Kart 8 running at 60 fps with 4 players? The Wii U can't even deliver that."
wiiu,3dmr43,sakipooh,28,Fri Jul 17 16:52:31 2015 UTC,You're absolutely right. While Nintendo has shown you don't NEED cutting edge hardware to make a great game they have absolutely demonstrated that great games can be hindered by hardware limitations. 4 player kart at 1080p 60fps would be glorious and four player splatoon battles would have put the game on another level. But they can't physically do it because of subpar hardware.
wiiu,3dmr43,Poached_Polyps,2,Fri Jul 17 17:31:40 2015 UTC,"I can get behind this. Hell, I just wish Nintendo would stop alienating third parties with that stuff. Why do they implement all of this crazy crap that seems mad difficult to execute, and then cut corners on the easiest thing to implement?"
wiiu,3dmr43,Biceps_Inc,10,Fri Jul 17 19:04:37 2015 UTC,"I believe your argument is what they call a ""Strawman."" No one is arguing that better specs wouldn't be better... they are saying that they are not necessarily required for fun and that simply having better specs does not make for a better gaming experience... (on a somewhat unrelated side note to this, I would argue that actually these better specs are hurting gaming as developers focus less on good gaming and more on flashy tricks and graphics. Sure you can occasionally still find a gem in the HD sewer that mainstream gaming is now... but they are more the exception than the rule.  I for one appreciate Nintendo's FUN FIRST attitude... would that be even better with better specs?  Sure.  But are they necessary?  Nope. Not at all.)"
wiiu,3dmr43,BYUtka,15,Fri Jul 17 17:47:46 2015 UTC,"having better specs does not make for a better gaming experience...   Mario Kart 8 at 1080p running 60fps even with four player split-screen would objectively be a better gaming experience than the barely sustained 30fps at 720p.   I would argue that actually these better specs are hurting gaming as developers focus less on good gaming and more on flashy tricks and graphics.   I believe your argument is what they call the ""obtuse cherry picker"". There are an infinite number of bad games out there on high and low end hardware. Suggesting that better hardware just breeds exploitative eye candy is kind of insane. Why on earth would Nintendo release any new hardware if fun can be had with the N64? No one is saying pretty pictures makes games more fun but more powerful hardware does make games more playable. If you can't wrap your head around frame rates, draw distances and resolution then you don't understand the importance of powerful hardware.   Minecraft isn't much to look at but it still requires enough power to run. In the end powerful hardware allows for complexity to exist. To think that we've actually reached a plateau and nothing ever needs to be improved (from Wii U hardware) is a little crazy. Ten years down the road we'll see game concepts thought to be impossible by today's standards. Want to play a game of Waverace with perfect fluid physics only seen in ridiculous GPU demos, it's going to happen but not on Nintendo hardware any time soon.  I'll leave you with the fact that no developer in the world has ever said, ""I wish the hardware was more limiting to compromise my vision."""
wiiu,3dmr43,sakipooh,3,Fri Jul 17 18:26:36 2015 UTC,"Using Mario Kart is an odd example though. It runs at 720p, 60 fps for up to 2 players. It only drops to 30fps w/ 3-4 players. Most XB1 & PS4 games don't even have local multiplayer, and often don't hit 60 fps at all because they're going for 1080p. That's actually one of the few things where Nintendo's developers are very good at utilizing a system to achieve their goals efficiently."

The industry was all kinds of fucked up last year.  I take issue with the whole either/or mentality. Nintendo hasn't competed in the same market as Sony or Microsoft since the GameCube. They've positioned themselves, in my opinion, as a complimentary system. You can have a PS4 or XBone (AND a Wii-U and)edit have a complete experience.  Edit: left out some words. Whoops"

Though, it does maybe outweigh some of its failures.  Similarly, the systems lower specs and faltering sales didn't mean Nintendo needed to close up shop and start making phone games. There's stupidity in the reporting no matter what (looking at you, Kotaku).  Let's call it what it is. A fun and creative yet flawed system that was under marketed, weirdly branded and confused consumers. But, it had a key core of amazing games to offset this, mostly first party. The end."

Sure better specs and such help, but living in the now the truth is the Wii U is crazy fun. These are some of the best Nintendo games, many sure to be classics remembered fondly with he hardware more difficult to come by. Even Wii fit U is turning out to be great, I love my fit meter! We play our Wii U everyday, our friends love it, kids love it, the games are just plain fun for all and fun to look at. I'm thirty now, this is probably my last game system, I had fun playing halo but I do not miss it, I've got shit to do I can't waste time on Halo, but splatoon? I've got time for a quick match. Now I know I just hated on shooters that I don't have time for, but I will not be surprised if I end up buying and enjoying Devils third too! The previews might not be getting its 80's camp action movie charm, but I won't be surprised if it turns out to be seriously fun, especially the crazy multiplayer the previewers have not played. I'm very bullish, because even the one game I thought to be a bomb, W101, just like in the article turned out to be a blast. Has there been a bad first or second party title on Wii U? My library is stacked.  RIP Iwata and God bless Nintendo"
wiiu,3dmr43,LoveLifeLiberty,7,Fri Jul 17 20:03:39 2015 UTC,"Nintendo is regularly putting out best-in-franchise games right now. Its too bad that its hitched to a console that has been selling so poorly.  People are going to look back on the Wii U like they currently do the Gamecube: This weird ""cult"" console that people were too stupid to appreciate at the time but that's actually amazing."
wiiu,3dmr43,KoolAidMan00,28,Fri Jul 17 22:14:15 2015 UTC,"I don't get this article.. I love my Wii U and it is a great system, but it is obviously not what the majority of the market wants. The other two consoles have a lot of worthwhile exclusives out and on the horizon PLUS they play third parties. To some people that is more compelling than just a Nintendo first party box.   Its almost as if people write these types of articles to cater to the people arguing about how gtreat the Wii U is online."
wiiu,3dmr43,Streetfoldsfive,2,Fri Jul 17 16:22:48 2015 UTC,"it is obviously not what the majority of the market wants.   The majority of the market barely even knows it exists. The problem is and always was poor marketing, for both the hardware and the software. Nintendo's philosophy with the U was, ""This is the successor to the Wii - it's obvious that if we build it, they will come"". And the audience didn't come, because they didn't even know it existed (or thought it was a gamepad add-on to the Wii), because Nintendo didn't throw down on another advertising campaign - let alone a campaign on the scale of ""Wii would like to play"".  All Nintendo ever needed to do was advertise outside of E3 and their Youtube channel."
wiiu,3dmr43,Soupstorm,3,Sat Jul 18 00:20:08 2015 UTC,"The other two consoles have a lot of worthwhile exclusives out   I can think of maybe 2 retail exclusives I'd actually want to play on either console.  Driveclub and Bloodbourne. Forza Horizon 2 and Halo:MCC. I was excited to see how Godzilla did, but that was a total flop. There are definitely a lot of games on the way that look interesting though.  I really want to buy one of the consoles. The Kinect seems great for controlling my TV and the PS4 has a few indie games that I would like to play (Resogun, flower, and hohokum). But already having a gaming PC, the library just isn't there yet."
wiiu,3dmr43,Z-Ninja,4,Fri Jul 17 16:51:08 2015 UTC,"worthwhile exclusives  exclusives I'd actually want to play   There's a difference between something being generally worthwhile, and something being worthwhile to you personally. Sure, you might not care about most of the exclusives on either other console, but tons of other people do.   But already having a gaming PC   I agree, if you already have a gaming PC, that completely changes things. But if you look at it from the perspective of a gamer who doesn't have one, and only wants to get one console, how do you think it looks to them? ""Hm, I can get a Wii U with its awesome exclusives and nothing else... Or I can get a PS4/Xbone with a smaller handful of exclusives, and also everything else Wii U doesn't have.""  As for me, I've been a Nintendo kid from the beginning and always will be, so of course I chose the console with Zelda, Smash, Kirby, possibly Metroid, and many other franchises I know I'll want to play. But people like me aren't anywhere near common enough to sustain Wii U alone. And even then, I'm looking into getting a PS4 for the games I really like but know Wii U won't get, such as Mirror's Edge and Batman Arkham Knight, which really sucks. I'd love to see the day where I can just buy one console per generation, and have both my Nintendo AND multiplat favorites in one place."

wiiu,3dmr43,dred1367,22,Sat Jul 18 00:42:44 2015 UTC,"Engadget can blow me. In fact, the whole gaming journalism industry can eat it.   I remember when I first bought a WiiU, I had so many false impressions from different pieces of gaming journalism. I thought the gamepad would be a worthless, uncomfortable joke that I was forced to play with. That was simply not the case, and I had gaming journalism to blame for that one. Game reviews revolving around the system haven't been real accurate to me either. Hell, one of the guys in this article said that he initially dismissed the Wonderful 101 until he actually learned how to play the game. When I read this, I could have punched his face.   My point is that the damage has been done. Now that Iwata is dead, posting some guilt-ridden article with lilting trash like ""OMG thanks Nintendo for making us feel so WRONG! Now that your console has failed, we can confidently say that all of our harsh, dismissive initial impressions, as misleading as they may have been, were wrong. It only took a good three years to make that one right. Maybe we can make up for it by blindly fawning over the NX.""   Engadget can fuck off. What a joke of an article.    Edit* I can't shut up yet. I mean, they even act baffled at current gaming culture, which they sculpt themselves? Dude."

wiiu,3dmr43,LazerBarracuda,43,Fri Jul 17 17:06:31 2015 UTC,"Why are people so upset? Yeah the WiiU might be a flop in terms of sales but you can't sit there and tell me you haven't had fun with the console with the games released for it, especially the stuff straight from Nintendo. All this article is saying that they were wrong to turn a blind eye to it, and that they should have realized sooner how much FUN the console is to play. There might not be thousands of games released for it, but I've had a lot more FUN with my WiiU than I've had with any other console in a loooong time."
wiiu,3dmr43,miniboss1487,6,Fri Jul 17 16:24:13 2015 UTC,"I've easily purchased more games for my Wii U (physical or digital) than any other console I've ever owned. I can't recall the last time I had this much fun with a console, and I've purchased and owned all the major home and handheld from the NES to the 360 and PS3 (with the lone exception of the original XBox). And for some reason I actually prefer the lean, but quality lineup the system has. There are still several major releases I need to purchase along with a lot more digital titles before I feel my WiiU collection is complete.  At the same time, it doesn't feel like I have such a large catalog of only good-enough titles that I feel compelled to push through. I'm actually eager to play through the library rather than feeling like I'm just retreading the same stuff again and again just for the sake of not feeling like I've wasted money on all this stuff.  More so, aside from a graphical improvement, I've yet to see much of a change from games on the PS3/360. There is a lot of HD remasterings and other ports, but very few console exclusives that are actually new or particularly different from previous entries. I'm all for visual upgrades, but when that's the biggest selling point, is there really much of a point in getting these consoles when a PC will provide access to even more original games, high-end graphics, and flexible, future-proofing hardware (more so than a console with a 5-6 year life cycle).  The point of the article isn't attacking other consoles, but to make the point that so many critics of the WiiU dismissed the system in favor of the offerings of Sony and MS. Complaints about graphics and lack of ""next gen"" compatible ports filled various subreddits, blogs, and various news outlets. That somehow the WiiU wouldn't be fun or worth owning because it wasn't identical enough to the PS4 or XB1. Despite meager sales and a lean line up of titles, it's very much a fun system, and one capable of delivering a more unique experience than either the PS4 or XB1 (neither of which offer much new in terms of actual gameplay--not IPs, but software that take advantage of the new hardware).  Why people feel like the article is attacking people's ownership or preference for either the PS4 or XB1 is beyond me. It isn't that the PS4 or XB1 aren't worth owning; it's that the WiiU is."

Some people simply can't seem to handle a single good thing being said about the console at this point. Meanwhile I'll continue to enjoy the shit out of the games I've already enjoyed for hundreds of hours, plus look forward to the ones I haven't even got to yet.

wiiu,3dmr43,Jalien85,9,Fri Jul 17 16:54:23 2015 UTC,"I'm slightly disappointed. I feel like the quantity of output didn't match up to what the Gamecube brought (2 full Zeldas, 2 Pikmins, 2 Metroid Primes, Animal Crossing, latter three being new franchises)."
wiiu,3dmr43,hampa9,2,Fri Jul 17 19:13:57 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree about the output quantity not being as good as the GameCube in terms of first party offerings. I have well over 30 games still for my GC with a vast majority being first party and exclusives and I doubt the WiiU will come anywhere close to that. Nintendo definitely struggled with HD development this generation. That being said I'm more than satisfied with what I do have for WiiU and I'm willing to invest in the NX when it eventually comes out. I know full well that the third party support might not be there again, but with my PC and PS4, as well as the Nintendo exclusives I'll be set for years to come. There will always be space on my entertainment center shelf for Nintendo platforms."

Then a year later I got Wii U and I'm playing with friends at least once a week. For me in terms of gaming nothing beats having friends over to play 2-5 player local coop. It's just so much fun. PS4 and X1 are nowhere near that experience regardless of their performance.

I'm not sure if Nintendo can survive another failure if the Nintendo NX suffers the same fate.    The problem Nintendo faces as a console manufacturer is its lack of 3rd party support.  When the Wii U was unveiled we were promised it would have plenty of games from major third party developers.  Not many people want to spend $300 on a console just to play Nintendo's games.  They want to play the latest Madden, Call of Duty, or Grand Theft Auto as well.  I wonder how many Wii U owners only own a Wii U and not another console (e.g. Xbox, PS4, PC).  My guess is not many."

That's not how Nintendo works...that's not how they ever worked. Nintendo fans know that if you want to play Nintendo games, you get the Nintendo console.   Nintendo builds their systems with gameplay in mind - what new ways can 'we' (Nintendo) have players experience these games, and how can 'we' challenge ourselves into creating those moments and the new ways to play? Nintendo has been doing that since even the N64, with its unconventional controller. Putting a Mario Kart or Splatoon on another platform would strip it down and make it damn near boring.  Nintendo has that charm about them that only comes from when their hardware and their software work hand in hand - that is not something you get from another system or their games."
wiiu,3dmr43,rbarton812,31,Fri Jul 17 19:24:36 2015 UTC,"Whatever Nintendo's next console is, I know it'll be radical and unconventional.

I'm a big fan of Nintendo, but I don't owe them anything. I am a consumer. I reserve the right to criticise and vote with my wallet if I don't like the way things are going.

The article is simply saying what many Wii U owners know: it is a great console.  I'm by no means rich. I bought the console at full price around two weeks after it came out. I've got around 12-14 titles out so far, not including digital purchases. I've easily got my worth out of the console. How many fucking titles does the average gamer buy for a console? I'm sure I'll get several (2-3) more at the least.  Am I weird? I plan on getting a PS4 for Fallout in November. That said, I've still barely touched several of my games. I'll certainly revisit many even after I get my new system.  I don't know if the people complaining about the Wii U are upset because they don't own 100 titles, or they're embarrassed by their purchase and trying to justify it to save face.   Nintendo isn't hurting. They've got a huge financial surplus. Of course they could have done better. They'll develop a new system and sell it. This same shit happened with the GameCube."

I love that Nintendo does unexpected things pretty much all the time, even if they don't always work out. I get the impression that's not okay with most of the people on here, either.

wiiu,3dmr43,KC_Newser,9,Sat Jul 18 16:37:44 2015 UTC,"I just don't understand the point of this type of articles. It's basically a bunch of gaming ""journalists"" voicing how much they loved their Wii U's. That's it. There's no analysis that go with it. Just a lot of feel-good opinions. The title is screwed up too. If judging from sales numbers, which Nintendo cares about because it's out to make a profit and has stated on record that the Wii U has underperformed, then Nintendo was definitely ""wrong.""  I f*cking hate this type of articles. When Wii U wasn't doing so well at launch it was doom and gloom. Then last year when Mario Kart 8 came out and had skyrocketing sales, these ""journalists"" were writing that the Wii U was the system to have and how it's gonna put a dent in sales for the 2014 holiday season. Then it became clear that the Wii U didn't sell that many compared to other consoles during the holiday window, the same ""journalists"" returned to their usual doom and gloom tripe. And then Mr. Iwata announced that Nintendo has been working on the NX and will move into mobile, the ""journalists"" all rejoiced and patted themselves on their backs on their prescience on how wrong the Wii U was as a concept. And finally Mr. Iwata tragically died in office, and suddenly all of these ""journalists"" began waxing nostalgic about Nintendo, insofar as to claim that we were ""wrong"" about the Wii U.  Seriously, just go f*ck off."
wiiu,3dmr43,sturmeagle,20,Fri Jul 17 18:29:40 2015 UTC,Rose coloured glasses for Nintendo with this article - The WiiU is a disappointment for everyone including Nintendo.  I have one and like it just fine but if I didn't have a PC as my primary gaming system I would be angry at the sheer lack of choice.  The NX should be the last kick at the cat for Nintendo ... if it fares the same as the WiiU then start putting out titles as a 3rd party they would make a fortune on that alone.
wiiu,3dmr43,TenaciousBLT,6,Fri Jul 17 15:48:53 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about? I've never been so satisfied with a console in all of my life. Each game I've played on the WiiU has been like, a top-tier home run. I also love the controller, the interface, etc.   The big disappointment for me is the sales, and the fact that this machine won't get validated for its level of quality, while people make some non-choice between the PS4 and the Xbox One so they can get their fill on gajillions of pixels with the witcher 3 and fallout games and stuff. I'm sorry, but when I look at the ps4 and xbox one, I just feel dead to gaming and games. I just can't handle any more mindless, gray-scaled summer blockbuster-style offerings."

I think you are missing a major point of what gaming is about, it's variety. Nintendo Land was the only truly unique game and the rest just offered nothing close to what could be done. Every game after that was basically the same tried and true formula that was used before. Pikmin, Wind Waker and Kirby Stylus canvas offer nothing new. DKC doesn't even look that different to the Wii version.    I just can't handle any more mindless, gray-scaled summer blockbuster-style offerings.   Man, you are out of touch. Have you seen the new Batman? Uncharted 4? GTAV? FarCry 4? Mortal Kombat X? Second Son? No Man's Sky? Fallout 4? Metal Gear V? And the Witcher is gray-scaled?

So far I suppose the Wii U could be more powerful (and expensive) or better internet (with monthly subscription fees) but i'm pretty happy with the system as it is now. I'm less concerned with what other consoles do as long as I have fun.

I understand that some people would rather have a console than a PC, but Nintendo still has its niche as the family-friendly, relaxing game machine. It's not fair for people to compare it to the XB1 and PS4 since they're designed for the more hardcore gaming."

I have owned EVERY console since I got an NES brand-new as a kid I have lived/slept Mario/Zelda etc since they were new BUT now we have a situation where the lack of options is sad when I want to play a new game.  Those games on PS4/XBONE/PC you call grey are some great games with a lot of fun and a challenge ... do they have bright sprites and cute music no but it doesn't mean because the big N didn't put them out they aren't great.  Nintendo is waving the flag already with the NX - the WiiU is being killed off early and we will have to wait and see if there is a comeback story out there to write for Nintendo.  Would I love to see them put some good h/w and court the 3rd parties and take an honest attempt at online?  HELL YES ... but if they stick to their current ways I don't know how they plan on trying to claw back from where they are.  I own a WiiU - my son loves playing it and I love playing it but it doesn't mean I am willing to say those other games are dead to me and the only thing matters is what's available for my meager gaming library.

wiiu,3dmr43,Biceps_Inc,2,Fri Jul 17 19:01:47 2015 UTC,Exactly - it would be the biggest thank you to the fans and would be a constant revenue stream.

wiiu,3dtajo,Mottaman,2,Sun Jul 19 12:42:29 2015 UTC,"yup! Gamepads use a resistive screen over a capacitive screen. Basically, a resistive touch screen feels any pressure put on it, which blocks a contant circuit going through that area. Once the gamepad feels the circuit stop due to pressure, it registers a touch on that one area. Meanwhile, capacitive touch screens are based solely off of heat signatures in certain frames of the touchscreen. So when your iphone feels the heat of your finger in secion 4-C, it registers a touch in that general area. The perk of a resistive screen is that it's more precise, but lacks capabilites for multi touch. The capacitive is a bit less precise, but also can support multi touch. Also, capacitive touch screens are generally a bit tougher, but that also might just be because that's where all the research is going to. Hopefully that helps, I hope there aren't any errors, I learned about this on a drunken night a year or two ago and feel like I remembered enough to share."

This sort of stuff happened during the last Splatfest, too. I don't believe they intend to fix it (why would they organize more Splatfests when the situation is broken? Conclusion: it's not important enough for them). It would be at least be nice of them to acknowledge there are significant problems with keeping players connected to the servers."

wiiu,3dmur0,ifunnydog2779,18,Fri Jul 17 16:33:43 2015 UTC,"A short campaign doesn't imply a short experience with the game. The game is meant to be played and replayed.

Star Fox Adventures is almost never mentioned in the same breath as Star Fox, yet it was one of my favorite entries in the series. Mixing an adventure game in with flying the Arwing was a breath of fresh air, and it added another dimension to Star Fox. After SFA's reception, I doubt Nintendo will do another one that strays from the standard SF formula."

wiiu,3dmur0,Litagano,4,Fri Jul 17 20:07:49 2015 UTC,My biggest issue with Assault was it didn't feel fast paced enough compared to 64. The Arwing felt like it dragged along the rails.

wiiu,3dmur0,SenordrummeR2,4,Fri Jul 17 17:35:17 2015 UTC,I wish Miyamoto had stayed out of it as it would have been a strong IP on it's own. Shoe-horning the Star Fox characters in there kind of hurt the original vision. Everything doesn't have to be Nintendo themed.
wiiu,3dmur0,sakipooh,6,Sat Jul 18 03:44:26 2015 UTC,Even without Miyamoto it would have been a poor Zelda ripoff. Don't try and act like not having Fox would have made that game some super original masterpiece.

Forcing the shitty StarFox angle made it a dissapointment to most as a Starfox game comes with certain expectations. For instance they start you off with a space battle but that's never revisited again.

I don't have time to play the game 20 times to try to find the alternate exist so I can play that one stage in the middle of the map. If I don't figure it out the first time I'm going online to look it up.  I just want to experience all the content in the shortest amount of time possible so I can move on.    The branching missions are cool too, but just give me a mode so I can play it all.  Star Fox 64 had 15 stages, but you only needed to go through 7 to beat it.  Each play through would take 2 hours I think, but it would easily take 3 play throughs to experience all the levels.  You'd have to play through two levels 3 times, and two levels twice.  I don't know, just please don't make me do that stuff."

I saw a few of the alternate planets but obviously not all because of the first planet, until my friend showed me 5 years ago to my amazement.  Star fox 64 was never about 'seeing every planet'. It was about the high octane experience of  shooting everything, racking up points and the experience of 'interacting' with the characters.  To my recollection there was 1 main planet where you had to do something 'that doesn't quite make narrative sense' to access the 'secret level'; flying under the things in Cornea. Everything else included  Slippy getting knocked out the sky, not stopping the bomb, poor performance, not unlocking all the gates etc.  Doing the super hard route in one go for the secret ending, well that's like an easter egg, for people that are heavily invested."
wiiu,3dmur0,MC_Fap_Commander,2,Fri Jul 17 21:43:17 2015 UTC,"A mode like that would be cool. IIRC Star Fox 64 3D also had a mode where you could do individual levels by themselves, instead of having to go through the whole campaign if you were just aiming for a medal on one particular level."
wiiu,3dmur0,boopaboopa,4,Fri Jul 17 16:41:03 2015 UTC,"If that's the way you feel, then I don't think these kind of arcade-style games are for you. Levels in these games are designed to be played over and over again, and with each repetition you learn more about them or watch your skills improved. Eventually, you make the discoveries necessary to find the secrets and play new levels. It's meant as a reward for mastery and exploration. These kinds of games are more like learning to play an instrument than watching a movie. If a Star Fox level gets boring for you on the second or third play through, then it's just not the kind of game that's built for people with your tastes."
wiiu,3dmur0,savageboredom,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:02:10 2015 UTC,"That's totally fair. It's just strange that Mario games pull off the ""replay, search, discover"" style in a way I still find very appealing. For whatever reason, I never got that same sense from Star Fox."

wiiu,3dmur0,TSPhoenix,0,Sat Jul 18 08:07:43 2015 UTC,"The big reason Star Fox Zero doesn't look as good as MK8 or SM3DW because of what it is doing with the gamepad. I mean yeah it's obvious the game is being rushed and it could use a bit more time in the oven but it would never look as good as MK8 because of how much power is used to do the whole ""cinematic view on the tv, cockpit view on the gamepad"" idea. I just hope it is worth it."
wiiu,3dmur0,LegatoSkyheart,5,Sat Jul 18 07:25:26 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I seem to remember Star Fox 64 not having save points. I have a feeling this new one will (I could be wrong though, does anyone know?). That difference to me is huge in determining how long a campaign should take to play through."
wiiu,3dmur0,armedcombatexpert,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:41:23 2015 UTC,They still want the game to be playable in a single movie-length sitting.
wiiu,3dmur0,Pooh_Bear,5,Sat Jul 18 02:08:27 2015 UTC,The only Long Star Fox Campaign I can remember is Star Fox Adventures.
wiiu,3dmur0,cherold,3,Fri Jul 17 17:45:11 2015 UTC,"I think Wario Land II did Branching paths well: The game is very short when played through once, but once you do that you unlock a ""treasure map"" which is basically a level select where you can replay levels and look for different routes which lead to different endings, and once you beat all the levels (and got all the collectables) you unlocked a difficult ""Really final chapter"" and could get the last ending.  Star Fox could benefit from that, I think. People want to have some actual goal to work towards, and I think that having all the paths build up to something could really benefit it."
wiiu,3dmur0,savageboredom,3,Fri Jul 17 16:54:43 2015 UTC,"It seems they are planning to make the game episodic, so new campaigns will appear periodically, I'm assuming."
wiiu,3dmur0,cherold,4,Sat Jul 18 05:23:00 2015 UTC,"If much of the appeal of Star Fox Zero is getting a higher score then I can't be too excited. I like games for the experience of playing them; I don't give a crap about playing the same thing a little bit better than last time. Maybe that's why I always liked adventure games like The Longest Journey; no replay value, no scores, just a fun experience.  Still, SFZ does seem like it will be fun at first, at least."
wiiu,3dmur0,Yhdiste,4,Fri Jul 17 18:56:45 2015 UTC,"That's just a matter of preference though. Once upon a time that's literally all we had in games. Keep playing and get a better score each time. Eventually they turned into narrative experiences. One isn't better or worse than the other, they're just different."
wiiu,3dmur0,astoundingchair,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:11:30 2015 UTC,Absolutely.
wiiu,3dmur0,Matt4045,3,Sat Jul 18 15:41:00 2015 UTC,"There is no reason why the game couldn't be longer than that and still have that replayability.  Take Kid Icarus: Uprising for example. It takes around 8-10 hours to beat the story, but it has a lot of replayability as well. Higher difficulty unlocks new areas, there's challenges and different weapons that have a big impact on the gameplay, etc. For example in Star Fox Zero the scoring system could be stage-centered like the time trials in DKC:TF."
wiiu,3dmur0,SpunkBunk,2,Fri Jul 17 18:52:42 2015 UTC,"""The closer I am to the grave when I'm done with a game, the better it was. It's like saying Paul Blart: Mall Cop is twice as good as Godfather Part 1 if you watch it four times in a row. Which it is.""  Anyway I loved Starfox 64 and I love FTL and I actually enjoyed Sid Meier's Starships, and I am going to waste so much time playing this one that it's actually going to impact my health. Fucking rad."
wiiu,3dmur0,RottenRat,3,Sat Jul 18 07:28:23 2015 UTC,And that's an acceptable excuse for a one hour long $60 game?
wiiu,3dn0j4,bunglenutter,17,Fri Jul 17 16:22:52 2015 UTC,"Well, every game gets repetitive with time, that is the purpose of the mini updates every week to make you keep coming back. Hopefully with the August update and the ability to choose mode and stage this wont longer be a issue."
wiiu,3dn0j4,Felixrak,18,Fri Jul 17 17:19:33 2015 UTC,I feel like switching weapons helps a ton.  I definitely get burned out when I'm using the same weapon all the time; challenge yourself to use some different weapons and playing styles!  Also flipping between ranked and turf wars further helps.

Now everything else just feels wrong. I've learned to love mines and  that lovely ink-from-above missile of mine. :) I've been in a few matches that wer deadly close, at is turned out, and won based off of a tiny percentage point because I launched a missile just as the buzzer sounded."
wiiu,3dn0j4,Tin_Whiskers,3,Fri Jul 17 20:32:26 2015 UTC,"Oh man! I remember I won once just because of a last second grenade toss; we won by a tenth of a percentage point! (sometihng like 41.5% to 41.4%.  Feels good, right?!  But, yeah, now that you mention it, I'm ""fearing"" the day I unlock that one; it seems really good.  Right now I just like my NES Zapper and the nail-gun looking sniper gun with the paint nuke, but I imagine I'll probably get stuck on that thing."

wiiu,3dn0j4,Tin_Whiskers,8,Fri Jul 17 23:26:58 2015 UTC,"I think Splatoon is a game to be enjoyed in short bursts. The rounds are short and you can only play two maps per mode at any given time. If you just play a little bit at a time the game still holds power, and I think the game was designed that way, and honestly I find it more refreshing than 20 minute Battlefield rounds, especially you feel you have more ""control"" over the outcome of the rounds in Splatoon."
wiiu,3dn0j4,sturmeagle,14,Fri Jul 17 18:34:13 2015 UTC,"It's the most I've played an online shooter since CS 1.6  So for me, it has lasting power. But maybe because I love platformers so much.  The blend of platformer and shooter is different from anything I've seen before. So it's very enjoyable and fresh for me.  I can understand how some can call it repetitive. But to each his own."

wiiu,3dn0j4,Cervix-Pounder,3,Fri Jul 17 19:06:51 2015 UTC,there's many new maps and weapons released that you should go try out.
wiiu,3dn0j4,starman888,3,Sat Jul 18 11:35:46 2015 UTC,"Try playing the ranked modes. Both of them are less about painting the maps, and more about killing enemies. Splat zones is pretty fun, but I love tower control. I've had some super intense games of TC, and it's a blast.  edit - Today though splatfest is going on, so ranked mode is disabled."
wiiu,3dn0j4,ryan_expert,15,Sat Jul 18 18:02:23 2015 UTC,"Honest question, but how is playing the same MP maps over and over any different than Halo, COD, Battlefield, or any of the other MP shooter games? I haven't played Splatoon yet, so I'm genuinely curious why it wouldn't have the same lasting power as those other games."
wiiu,3dn0j4,SenordrummeR2,15,Fri Jul 17 16:35:50 2015 UTC,It's different with Spaltoon. They rotate playable maps every 4 hours so if you don't enjoy the ones available at that time you have to wait. It can get boring if you happen to see the same ones all the time.
wiiu,3dn0j4,Cobrakai83,8,Fri Jul 17 16:47:49 2015 UTC,"Its funny cause you usually end up on the same maps over and over again  in those games, even if you have a choice.  When I played CSGO or Halo; its usually the same maps over and over. People have their favorites and don't deviate often.  Having only 4 maps every 4 hours sometimes actually forces me to play in maps I wouldnt normally pick. - Which I like."
wiiu,3dn0j4,kupovi,5,Fri Jul 17 18:18:39 2015 UTC,"It's really a double edge sword kind of thing. On one hand I like it for the reasons you mentioned. No voting and being forced on 2 maps is kinda nice when it's one you don't see often or really like. On the other hand, it's frustrating when it's two of the ones I play all the time and may not be my favorites.  I guess that's why I also enjoy the 3 minute matches in Splatoon. Even if you're not super crazy about one of the maps, the game is over soon enough anyways."

wiiu,3dn0j4,Astrobliss,5,Sat Jul 18 15:33:44 2015 UTC,"Many of those games' maps are like partial open worlds. Splatoon feels so confined and every map was essentially each team starting on opposite ends and battles it out at the middle with like 3-4 ""lanes"" to try to slip behind.   I know this is how it almost has to be since it's Turf Wars and the point is ground coverage, but that's just not a reasonable enough excuse to hold the game back from being more dynamic if it's the ONLY multiplayer mode that they release with. I mean they couldn't toss in deathmatch or balloon mode (like 1v1) among others?"
wiiu,3dn0j4,dunthurtmuh,4,Fri Jul 17 18:33:54 2015 UTC,"I take it you don't play ranked? Splat Zones provides a much more tactical Turf Wars while Tower Control is completely different beast to either because of the overcentralization the tower causes. It's still the same maps, but the different modes do so much to increase match variety."
wiiu,3dn0j4,sumrndmredditor,4,Fri Jul 17 18:55:45 2015 UTC,"No, I sold it prior to Tower Control release and I don't regret it at all. I shouldn't be forced to play Ranked to play a different mode. If Ranked is the only multiplayer that gets support then it should be the only mode.  Sorry, but that's like saying I can't enjoy Super Smash Bros unless I play ranked online which is ridiculous."
wiiu,3dn0j4,dunthurtmuh,5,Fri Jul 17 18:59:06 2015 UTC,"Well... what is it about ranked that turns you off so much? You seem like you'd feel different if instead of Ranked matches and Regular matches, the modes were just named Splat Zones and Turf Wars."
wiiu,3dn0j4,ATribeCalledGreg,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:32:49 2015 UTC,"I think what they're saying is we should have a choice of gamemode in both Ranked and Regular matches. I'd love to have a Turf War ranked battle, for example."
wiiu,3dn0j4,boopaboopa,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:24:24 2015 UTC,"I don't see the big deal. One mode earns you a little letter grade that means nothing, the other doesn't. If grading you is what makes a game go from bad to good in your mind, I think you take things a little too seriously."
wiiu,3dn0j4,ATribeCalledGreg,2,Sat Jul 18 02:50:11 2015 UTC,I never said that. Not once. I'm just saying having the option of a variety of game modes within Ranked and Regular battles isn't a bad thing. Is it?
wiiu,3dn0j4,boopaboopa,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:52:20 2015 UTC,You have the option of 2 of the 3 game modes at any time. Why does it matter if they fall into a ranked or regular category?
wiiu,3dn0j4,ATribeCalledGreg,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:57:02 2015 UTC,"As I mentioned earlier, I'd love a Turf War to be ranked. I think it would add more replayability for those of us that enjoy both Turf Wars and Ranked battles or Tower Control and Regular battles, etc.  What do you have against more options within the game? Why does it have to be set the way it is? Would the game suffer for having more ways to play?"
wiiu,3dn0j4,boopaboopa,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:16:28 2015 UTC,"There is a difference in rewards as well. Some people are frustrated that they don't get anything despite performing very well (even better than most on the winning team). And since the rewards are kind of vital to the progression of the game, it's no wonder if some think the game goes from good to bad.  Then there are people like me who would like a ranked Turf Wars, because you would get to play against others with the same skill level as you in that game mode as well. Not to mention playing regular mode and getting ~1k points per match is kind of disappointing when you are used to getting ~4,5k per win (even if you don't really need the money as much as you used to anymore)."
wiiu,3dn0j4,Yhdiste,2,Sat Jul 18 14:50:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly the rankings to me have become less of a focal point ever since I realized I would just go up and down B- the longer I played. The goal of moving up to B and beyond is still there, but now I play ranked to enjoy different matches against players of my caliber.  With Turf Wars, players are so spread out that you might not even encounter one at all for the entire game. PVP skill doesn't really matter there as much since the goal of the game is to put ink down. Splat Zones and Tower Control forces players together meaning that PVP skill matters so much more. If the modes were in unranked, you would really be able to see the skill difference and that's just not fun for casual players."
wiiu,3dn0j4,sumrndmredditor,2,Sat Jul 18 04:54:54 2015 UTC,"Those games have a lot more modes, plus it's easier to play with friends.   Even with three modes, Splatoon would fare a lot better, but they restricted it to two. And then today they limited it to just one."
wiiu,3dn0j4,ArabIDF,3,Sat Jul 18 08:45:28 2015 UTC,"As someone who owns several shooters including Splatoon, other games have way more options.  Battlefield has many different modes with different ticket counts, hardcore or not, and infantry only/mixed. Halo has even more maps than Battlefield and even more modes. I would have liked it if Splatoon had different time limits, different modes (besides 2, I think it's 3 now) and more maps."
wiiu,3dn0j4,filthyblasphemer,3,Fri Jul 17 20:21:56 2015 UTC,"I love the game, but the map rotation and the games inability to let you switch weapons between games definitely makes my excitement level go down a bit. Especially when I'm playing the same map 8 or 9 straight times."
wiiu,3dn0j4,Briscoeag,3,Fri Jul 17 17:21:25 2015 UTC,"It has gotten repetitive for me up to the point where I haven't played it in a couple weeks.  Haven't even finished campaign, I just kinda stopped liking it I guess?  I mean it's fun and all, but I just can't get in the mood to play it.  Don't know why, I have plenty of other games I play as well but it just doesn't have the lasting power I thought it would."
wiiu,3dn0j4,SpaceJockey1979,8,Sat Jul 18 04:56:48 2015 UTC,I loved it in the beginning because I was switching between single player and multiplayer and it broke them both up. But after beating the single player..... I am losing my love for the repetitive splatoon multiplayer.
wiiu,3dn0j4,OMGshNicholas,2,Fri Jul 17 16:26:52 2015 UTC,It's not a game I go back to every morning or evening but without fail I will look at it on my shelf and play it for like a 5 hour sitting at least once a week.

I literally haven't taken the disc out since I first got it and I probably play at least a bit every day, some days a lot more. The only thing that I don't like is lag against Japanese players and how over powered the dynamo roller is. But yeah, I love the game.   As for being repetitive, I don't feel that way because every opponent plays so differently that it feels new to me. How will I beat the rollers? The snipers? Bubbles? Kraken?"
wiiu,3dn0j4,reydeguitarra,2,Sat Jul 18 03:57:42 2015 UTC,"I'd been intrigued by the game since it was announced last year, but my interest didn't even last through a single Testfire.

I just got to level 10 and I'm already starting to feel the repetition even without playing all of the maps yet.   The one thing I find super frustrating is that the matchmaking just rarely works for me. Whether it's just sheer dumb unluckiness, I'm usually paired with an absolutely abysmal team. Like, consistently scoring in the 1000s while the rest of the team barely breaks into 500. Unless the August update with friend matchmaking changes this, I'll likely not even pick this up for myself."

I'm not doing a whole ""Why isn't anyone as good as me?"" thing.

It was good while switching back and forth between single and multiplayer, but once I cleared single + amiibo ""dlc"" and was left with only multiplayer, not so much.   With nothing but one mode multiplayer and ALL maps generally not feeling dynamic or unique enough really started to weigh on my desire to play. After about 3 games I was pretty bored or felt like I was just repeating the same thing over and over again.  I was aware that the game had limited content but the hype train really gets you with this game. I ended up selling my copy + amiibos for pretty much what I spent on it, so I'm not upset about my experience at all, it just clearly isn't for me."

Partly that's because my life is getting busier and I can't afford to spend hours playing it... I don't really think it's a game that's intended to be played hours at a time, honestly. I still find it incredibly addicting, and events like Splatfests and new weapon additions will help me come back and continue playing every so often."

I like the idea of dipping back in when there's new content or a smash fest. Truth is, I'm more of a narrative single player person, so I couldn't be happier that I liked it at all."
wiiu,3dn0j4,DubiusMastabaitaX,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:18:11 2015 UTC,At first I was extremely excited about the game but after the first week I could only bring myself to play for about 30 minutes at a time.

I seriously can't get enough of Tower Control, it is by far the most fun I've had with any shooter.

wiiu,3dn0j4,kerrykerrykerry1,0,Sat Jul 18 04:17:07 2015 UTC,"I like how the question is essentially, ""How well does this game Stay Fresh?""  It certainly has some aspects to it which prolong the gameplay in silly ways:  -Not being able to buy gear until a certain level  -Not being able to play ranked until a certain level  -Not knowing what attributes gear enhances until you level it up.[1]  -Having the opportunity to try/play on all of the maps requires you to play at different times.  -so on  Now, when I say these are silly, I mean they would be silly in other games.  In Splatoon, I don't mind them.  This game is fun,a nd I keep going.  [1] One thing that keeps me going is wanting to level up my gear and finding out what secrets my equipment contains.  I'll even wear weaker gear (or is it??) just so I am always unlocking something."

I mean sure, they will probably be the most valuable games available for the Wii U in the future, but you have to realise that even the most expensive games available now for older consoles, unless extremely limited print runs, are only worth about £200 - £300, and that is 20 years later.  Is it really worth holding on to something for 20 years just so you can make 6 times the original value?  Sure, if the original value was £100,000, and in 20 years it would be worth £600,000, then maybe.  But for a couple hundred quid, seems a bit pointless"
wiiu,3dqm80,Starsmustshoot,3,Sat Jul 18 14:40:16 2015 UTC,"I can see going for a ""complete Wii U boxed collection"" being a thing for collectors in 10 years time. But I can't see these two games specifically being worth any more than they are today. You won't get the casual collectors, because both games have a pretty good chance of jumping generations even when the axe falls on the availability of digital copies. Aside from that, the number of copies out there already will probably be enough to serve the collectors that do exist.  If you're looking for a model of how these games may hold value, you're probably better looking at SEGA Saturn or Dreamcast* than at Nintendo's back catalogue, IMO. Two reasons: 1) Wii U isn't going to be a roaring success, and there isn't going to be massive post-life demand for it, outside of the hardcore. 2) Old Nintendo consoles offer a bad model, because cardboard packaging creates a very different quality market. The difference between a sealed DVD case and everyone else's reasonably well-looked after used copies is infinitesimally small.  Or I could be completely wrong. Oh, and if you have these sealed games and haven't played them at all in any form, open them yesterday.  *So basically, your most expensive Wii U game is probably going to be some crazy-ass vertical shmup developed by Treasure, released in the last month of the console's life in Japan :P"

wiiu,3dqm80,GomaN1717,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:37:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if you're asking this from a ""how rich can I get?"" perspective, probably no.  Off the top of my head, the only retro game I've come across that has majorly appreciated in value is Earthbound, and that in itself is only worth ~$130 for a used copy. And the reason why it was even more expensive before was because, prior to its release on the Wii U VC, there was no legal way to play the game without the cartridge.   Pikmin 3 and New Super Luigi U, on the other hand, can be purchased digitally on the Wii U eShop. That alone is going to keep the value stagnant/depreciated for quite some time. If you're seriously taking re-sale value over actually playing these games, I hope you're ready to wait a long time for them to even pass the $100 mark."

Mega Man X2, Mega Man X3, Ninja Gaiden Trilogy, Harvest Moon SNES, Mega Man 7, Castlevania Dracula X, Super Turrican 2.    Check out eBay Prices or a Place like http://videogames.pricecharting.com/    According to http://videogames.pricecharting.com/ Earthbound has actually gone up in price since it was released digitally on the eShop.  There are plenty other examples where digital releases didn't hurt the overall value of the physical releases, Mega Man X3 is a good example (this is on Wii U eShop).  This is going to come across as rude, but you're very misinformed and spreading incorrect information.  Please do not do that."

wiiu,3dmnks,starman888,3,Fri Jul 17 18:10:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no voice chat can be stretched to work in Splatoon because of how visual its gameplay cues are (the map that always shows real-time ink coverage, friendlies placement, ink on the ground in the main screen, etc.). With a more traditional shooter with more complex gametypes, voice chat moves from a great benefit to being just necessary, especially with a large 8v8 setting."

The note makes it sounds like you know that's a bad thing so that's good anyway  Single player like a campaign or a single player? Honestly I could understand that if it was at 60 fps 720p like Splatoon, but if you think you couldn't do splitscreen with 30FPS then you need better code  Probably the thing that irked me the most: Saying ""Plz Understand"" after making an excuse for not including a feature due to what I can only guess is terrible unoptimized is in extremely bad taste. That phrase was coined in this domain by a man that I can only describe as an actual code wizard, and abusing his line to justify ineptitude while wounds are still open and healing is just absolutely terrible  Voice chat bandwidth limitations is a legit excuse, but again I can't tell if that's just because they're sending all the wrong information through bad coding practices. Sidenote: You should never be happy that an optional feature is missing just because you personally wouldn't use it. That's like saying ""I don't like cheese, so I'm happy nobody gets to eat cheese""  Don't disappoint? We're the consumers, we can only be disappointed in you.

I haven't been in the market for once since I still have my original controllers, but I almost always saw them at various game stores around town.  Also, I doubt the rep would actually know. One of my best friends is the local Nintendo rep and he doesn't have any privileged knowledge about supply chain or product availability. Sounds like the clerk was just feeding you BS so you wouldn't return it."

'Why do these people need to see GAMEPLAY, don't they know I'm fucking Keiji Inafune? I don't have TIME to come up with how the game's gonna play, I'm too busy working on the script for the sequel movie to Mighty No. 9-X2 Turbo!' The Comcept intern, barely a week into the job, shifted uncomfortably, averting his gaze as to not look directly at Inafune, as he was instructed during his first day. Inafune tossed aside the Atari Lynx he was using to play a round of Chip's Challenge (a game he was upset to find DIDN'T star Erik Estrada), sighed audibly, and glared at the intern. 'Whatever. Just... throw something together using the Unreal engine. I don't give a fuck. I just need money for more parties, blow and whores.' The intern nodded and backed out of the room, bowing profusely, closing the door as he left. Kicking the Lynx into the corner, Inafune solemnly picked up a half empty beer bottle. He raised it to his lips, as he glanced at a picture of Megaman he had framed on the wall. A single tear streamed down his face, before gritting his teeth and throwing the bottle at the picture, knocking it to the ground and shattering the glass. 'Fucking fans', he muttered to himself and he threw himself on the couch and booted up the latest western developed first person shooter, the pinnacle of game development."""

The odd thing to me is even though Platinum is helping develop it, it doesn't have the crazy, chaotic nature of a typical Platinum game. I'd be more okay with the graphics if there was a lot going on but there simply isn't. I'm fine with the base mechanics being the same. It's everything else that's a disappointment. The sad thing is if this bombs, we might not get a new Star Fox for a very long time."
wiiu,3dk9n9,ApocalypseTroop,3,Fri Jul 17 08:32:24 2015 UTC,"Well, they've only really showed of tutorial level stuff. I'll remain hopeful that the game really picks up, and becomes great the more you get into it."

wiiu,3dk9n9,rape-and-run,6,Fri Jul 17 06:47:22 2015 UTC,"That;s all Star Fox ever was, with the exception of the free-for-all dogfights in LylatWars multiplayer."
wiiu,3dk9n9,cbfw86,34,Fri Jul 17 11:56:10 2015 UTC,"You know, I might get downvoted here for what i'm going to say, but... I still haven't seen anything new in this starfox. Not a single thing in gameplay, design, or even plot -so it seems so far.  I feel this game doesn't take any risks, doesn't give anything fresh.  I'm a seasoned player, Back then, when starfox came for snes, it blew my mind. Totally. This is just the same, a little prettier, but the same.  Have you seen the footage of no man's sky? That is new. That totally gained my atention. And, look, i don't even have ps4, i'm a proud owner of wiiu, but i was secretly hoping to see something as astonishing as in no man's sky in starfox, but sadly... No.  (Sigh)"
wiiu,3dk9n9,elFeco,13,Fri Jul 17 02:50:46 2015 UTC,"That's exactly how I feel. There is nothing new about this one other than the poor execution of the Metroid Nintendo Land Gamepad aiming, which was actually brilliant in that game..why aren't there more of that type on the Wii U?. It's 2015 and Nintendo still fails to understand the point of having a crisp HDTV. Much like Kirby this game requires you to stare at an SD Gamepad screen while the TV plays second fiddle. If I wanted to play that kind of game the 3DS would have been sufficient."
wiiu,3dk9n9,sakipooh,4,Fri Jul 17 03:05:52 2015 UTC,"I was very confused with kirby wiiu. I mean, you make an amazing art, some advanced textures and dynamics, and a challenging non traditional plataform game, but all those hd visuals got dumped because you can't play the game viewing the hd screen, but the gamepad. I mean, its fun, but the hd and fr are useless."
wiiu,3dk9n9,elFeco,5,Sat Jul 18 05:36:56 2015 UTC,Might be completely deliberate showing the more classic style levels first. Seems odd that a company like P* games with that starfox Easter egg and added outfits in bayonetta wouldn't be allowed to go a little off the beaten path. I'm guessing this is either it or there is much much more not being shown. I hope to god it's the latter. Nintendo always holds their cards close I bet they've got something up their sleeve. Let's hope!
wiiu,3dk9n9,zoufha91,6,Fri Jul 17 04:07:37 2015 UTC,I feel like I just played this exact game on the 3DS.   A bunch of particularly loud starfox fans have asked for a starfox 64 sequel that is just like 64 for a long time now. Well here you go... hope your nostalgia isn't too blinding.
wiiu,3dk9n9,Remioli,0,Fri Jul 17 05:28:29 2015 UTC,"Being honest, i'll buy it, i'll like it probably.  But it seems like a light upgrade."
wiiu,3dk9n9,elFeco,12,Sat Jul 18 05:32:03 2015 UTC,"The chicken walker is new, no?  Either way, your comment is exactly why Nintendo shouldn't listen to fan boys, and why fan boys should shut up. There is a large contingent of people who want the same experiences but get angry when they're given the same experiences. And then they'll say, 'I wanted to experience the novelty and discovery of something daring,' and then they cry bullshit when Nintendo does something new and different.  Game developers can't do anything right because there will always be a group of people who are angry. And for that reason, I don't see the point of getting wound up by things. Just buy what you want to play and let the baby's have their bottles of doing an angry on their keyboards (before backtracking tastelessly and offering tributes to someone they were demonising a month ago over the Digital Event being off topic)."
wiiu,3dk9n9,cbfw86,3,Fri Jul 17 11:54:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think you get the point.  If you have a wiiu and have bought some of the main games, you can see there have been new things in them. Maybe you don't see it or maybe you just say obvious things like ""just buy what you want"".  Let me give you a hint: you see 3D world? There is innovation there. You see MK8? The same but different, makea you feel amazed. You see Smash? Yeah, basically the same, but 8 players??? Ultimately, maybe there will be something. I wasn't expecting a revolution in starfox, but it seems -to me, only me, and so far- plain and redundant. Hope there is much more beyond those 14 minutes."

wiiu,3dk9n9,Leonhart01,9,Fri Jul 17 08:51:19 2015 UTC,"It's the first level. So it's super easy and just trying to get you used to the controls. Of course it's not exciting. I imagine it will get better in later levels.  Edit: Super Mario 3D World would have looked super boring just from the first level, as an example."
wiiu,3dk9n9,Jalien85,7,Fri Jul 17 14:48:52 2015 UTC,"No, no it wouldn't have. At all. Mario is amazing from the get-go.  Not to mention that level 1-1 in a Mario game is only a friction of the entire game while the first stage in a Star Fox game is a much bigger percentage of the entire game."
wiiu,3dk9n9,DoubleDot,4,Fri Jul 17 19:48:40 2015 UTC,"Well apparently you have a crappy memory because 2 years ago at e3 all the way to around september everyone thought 3d world looked like shit. Go back and read the comments if possible, it got the same reaction this game got."
wiiu,3dk9n9,vaporfarts,3,Fri Jul 17 23:42:12 2015 UTC,3d world still isn't visually impressive.
wiiu,3dk9n9,awfulmemory,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:05:47 2015 UTC,"The person I'm responding to makes the point that it's ""obviously not exciting because it's only the first level"" and that first levels are merely an intro and are usually more boring. He then names 3D world as an example of a game looking boring if you'd only have the first level.  He's generalizing all games and is making the point that in general all first levels are boring if you only look at that. My counterpoint is that that's just nonsense. Anyone who can claim that the first level of 3D world is bad, boring, or what have you is tripping. 3D world is good from the get-go.  Your point about what some people said after seeing footage of 3D world is irrelevant. I'm not disputing the fact that games can look boring from footage. I'm disputing his generalization about first levels of games always being boring."
wiiu,3dk9n9,DoubleDot,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:53:44 2015 UTC,"Mario is amazing from the get-go.   The first level in SM3DW is rather boring and shouldn't be a metric to judge the rest of the game by. Is it polished and well designed? Sure. But comparing the first level to the rest of the game is sure to be disappointing if you judge the entire game based on the opening level.   while the first stage in a Star Fox game is a much bigger percentage of the entire game.   How do you know? There are going to be a variety of levels that will have bonus objectives, secrets, and most likely different ways to complete judging by the transforming Arwing."
wiiu,3dk9n9,boopaboopa,0,Sat Jul 18 17:25:57 2015 UTC,go back and play the other star fox games. they were never any different.
wiiu,3dk9n9,cbfw86,8,Fri Jul 17 11:56:38 2015 UTC,"Well isn't that the point? This looks just like the 64 iteration. Fans have clamored for a game like it but updated, this doesn't look very updated. It looks like they added a duck walking ship mode. Aaand that's about it."
wiiu,3dk9n9,mackhands,4,Fri Jul 17 14:31:31 2015 UTC,"No, after the last 3 starfox games, they've been clamoring for more of the old starfox."
wiiu,3dk9n9,vaporfarts,2,Fri Jul 17 23:45:42 2015 UTC,"Many have at face value, yes. But I doubt anyone wanted a remake sold to us as a NEW title. The problem with the last games were they added mechanics no one asked for and explored mechanics no one liked or asked for. Fans have asked to explore mechanics from the 64 game, grow that game, branch that core gameplay out into new fun things. Not just make the game again."
wiiu,3dk9n9,mackhands,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:08:38 2015 UTC,"But I doubt anyone wanted a remake sold to us as a NEW title.   We have no confirmation SFZ is a remake. Just similar. And Platinum is working on the campaign so I wouldn't rule it out.  I'd also like to point out the remake of SF64 on 3DS sold nearly a million units. Not bad for a handheld, so there's clearly a market for it."
wiiu,3dk9n9,boopaboopa,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:27:55 2015 UTC,"I don't literally mean a remake, I mean it looks and seems to function just like one. The remake on 3ds sold well because of its portability and it being declared a remake. This has all the makings of a remake under the guise of a new title."
wiiu,3dk9n9,mackhands,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:04:14 2015 UTC,Why? Because it has Fox as the main character and Corneria being the first tutorial-like level? That's like saying SM3DW is a remake of Super Mario World because the first level is in a grassy area.
wiiu,3dk9n9,boopaboopa,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:14:18 2015 UTC,"Because all of the gameplay is the same, all of the scenery is the same, it looks like the same kind of story, it's the same visuals, there's just nothing NEW here. I'm well aware it's one trailer and more might be revealed but given the track record of nintendo I don't really plan to get my hopes up. It just doesn't look new or like they're trying anything other than another tacky gamepad gimmick."
wiiu,3dk9n9,mackhands,4,Sat Jul 18 18:59:38 2015 UTC,Then why even pay for a new game? Why not collectively play the old ones if there are hardly any changes?
wiiu,3dk9n9,DoubleDot,2,Fri Jul 17 19:49:36 2015 UTC,"It looks like After Burner Climax, and that came in 2006..."
wiiu,3dk9n9,armedcombatexpert,22,Sat Jul 18 07:48:10 2015 UTC,I've been a huge Star Fox fan since the Snes but I just can't bring myself to be excited for this one. It's looks so plain and boring with it's low poly terrain I don't know what Nintendo was thinking. I would have dropped the Gamepad support and focused all of the Wii U's power on the rendering of a richer environment.
wiiu,3dk9n9,sakipooh,8,Thu Jul 16 23:55:06 2015 UTC,Agreed. Totally underwhelming.
wiiu,3dk9n9,pullablank,5,Thu Jul 16 23:59:43 2015 UTC,"I can understand the criticism, but a lot of Nintendo games start off painfully easy and straight-forward.  The first levels usually end up more as a tutorial. I think the excitement, difficultiy, and atmosphere will be ramped up in later levels.   I'm on the other side of the coin for the gamepad though, I think the gamepad support is what makes the game interesting for me."
wiiu,3dk9n9,kupovi,6,Fri Jul 17 00:45:34 2015 UTC,"I know the structure of Nintendo games well as I've been playing them since the launch of the Nes, this just doesn't deliver any excitement off the bat.  You'll be staring at the Gamepad 90% of the time. At that point we might as well just turn off the TV. This sort of motion control gyro aiming should be reserved for the 3DS."
wiiu,3dk9n9,sakipooh,2,Fri Jul 17 03:10:19 2015 UTC,I dunno.. I can aim pretty well with splatoon. I figure its the same principle.  You fly/move around looking at the main screen and move the gamepad around to aim (which you can see a reticle on-screen). - And then stare at the gamepad for precise aiming.  Lets not be afraid of change. Without motion control this game would be no different than a game in the 90s.
wiiu,3dk9n9,kupovi,6,Fri Jul 17 03:30:10 2015 UTC,"Played it at E3, had a completely different impression to each of those points. Amazing how everyone's views on it can differ... hope you'll re-consider as more comes out about it, because it'd be a shame to miss out on the game."
wiiu,3dk9n9,sstern333,4,Fri Jul 17 00:52:35 2015 UTC,"Let me ask you this, can you play it completely without watching the TV? From the interviews I've read it's been said that the TV acts more like a cinematic view of the action while the meat of the gameplay comes from looking at the Gamepad."
wiiu,3dk9n9,sakipooh,4,Fri Jul 17 03:13:04 2015 UTC,"So I played the demo 2wice on Corneria and once in the Pigma Battle. Certainly for 96-98% of the Corneria mission, I was looking at the TV, but probably could've also watched via the GamePad's view, although that would be slightly tougher (if you've seen the Treehouse stream of it, they often would show the GamePad view's footage, but you can also see my run on the demo here, which cuts to both GamePad and TV views - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y3fp_NCEFg). I presume you're not asking about an ""Off-TV"" GamePad only mode, are you? If so, I don't know the answer yet, if there'll be an off-TV GamePad option.  Anyway, when I went to the Pigma Battle stage, I noticed that it was also majorly looking at the TV for most of the flight, but I would not have won the battle in a decent amount of time without looking at the GamePad, because there's a time where you basically have to do your somersault technique to get behind him, and then look to the GamePad to target him with a charge-shot... trying to aim at him with the charge-shot without looking at the GamePad would've been nearly impossible.  EDIT: I'll throw in my ""First Hands-On Impression"" of the demo from E3 here too - http://www.bagogames.com/e3-215-star-fox-zero-hands-on-impressions/"
wiiu,3dk9n9,sstern333,5,Fri Jul 17 22:10:53 2015 UTC,"Did you watch the video in the link? He played it 100% with the sticks, and it looked like it controlled just like the old games."
wiiu,3dk9n9,Shredda,18,Fri Jul 17 15:02:25 2015 UTC,"For the last decade or so, everyone's been complaining that all of the Star Fox games that came out aren't good enough and that they should have stuck to the more traditional Star Fox On-Rails gameplay. Now we get a game that does just that and now people are complaining that there's nothing new to it."
wiiu,3dk9n9,drowsydeku,17,Fri Jul 17 05:06:18 2015 UTC,"Because people wanted many of the classical mechanics and presentation with some nice new ones and then a massive graphical polishing but with the same general theme.  Look at how Mario kart has evolved over time then apply that sort of evolution to Star FOX, that is what nintendo should have done with Fox Zero.  Instead this new StarFox looks like an early game cube game up-scaled or an early alpha with placeholder graphics.  If the wii u is so slow and they had to go for such a sparse look then they should have done a cell shaded StarFox game in the vain of WindWaker or at least visually produce something that makes it feel fresh and exciting.     People also want a good multiplayer experience as found in games like Mario kart8, at this point I'm not sure if Nintendo know what there fans actually want or are looking for half the time."
wiiu,3dk9n9,gamermusclevideos,4,Fri Jul 17 07:53:18 2015 UTC,"Also, we wanted innovation to the on rails gameplay, not the same exact thing. Well, I shouldn't say ""we"", but that's the Star Fox SEQUEL that I always wanted."

wiiu,3dk9n9,Felixrak,12,Fri Jul 17 05:16:17 2015 UTC,"In regards to the people actually upset about the graphics, let me make a personal point: I'm not too disappointed by the graphics themselves, more by the fact that if they hadn't  forcibly added on the gamepad second screen functionality, the game could have looked a lot better. It could have been a cool radar screen down there or something with the ships stats and damage, but instead we have to basically cut the graphical fidelity in half. Nintendo always seems to want to add a gimmick to every new title, but what I wish they would understand is that HD resolution could have been enough of a gimmick; same goes for most Wii U games. The Wii U could have cost $100 with no game pad, and they could have chosen a different shape for the console, and a different name. But instead we get this. Don't get me wrong, I'm still super stoked for the game and will be getting it day one, I'm just overall disappointed in Nintendo's priorities, not only on this game, but on the Wii U in general."
wiiu,3dk9n9,seanthemanpie,10,Fri Jul 17 06:49:06 2015 UTC,MK8 exemplifies the point: No real use of the GP except as accessory to the action; e.g. no 2-player 2 screen gaming. But this let Nintendo make the game gorgeous.

I would forgive a game that looked like a great version of an outdated game, but this just looks like a mediocre outdated game. I was trying to be positive about it,  but having seen that much gameplay,  I'm almost shocked."
wiiu,3dk9n9,DLOGD,2,Sat Jul 18 03:13:01 2015 UTC,this piece of shit looks like an unreleased gamecube game! this is a joke

If this does well enough for Nintendo to feel comfortable making more Star Fox games, I really hope they do that. Transforming is cool and all, but what would keep it fresh and interesting every time are those optional ""build paths"" that the sidescrolling shooters offered."

Super Mario U and Super Luigi U (least expensive thru the Nintendo website store, refurbished, both games for $35).  Super Smash Bros. If you aren't familiar, study gameplay videos on Youtube.

Rayman: This game is great, and scales up to 5 player with extra mates as well.  The two player co-op with the gamepad murphy is inventive and keeps you on your toys, it becomes more than just a girlfriend mode, you actually need to work together to get through the levels.  Art of balance, smaller games from the eshop, goes alright, feels abit like a phone game, but you can work together on it.  We don't enjoy smash heaps, but if it's your thing it's good.  Also recently got SM3D World, slowly going through it, doesn't feel as good to us as rayman, but it's still pretty solid.  I find Nintendo land is more used for when a pile of mates are around."

My Wii U & PS4 probaby get about the same amount of play time each week.   When I need my fill of 3rd party games, I play on the PS4, and when I need my fill of fun, light hearted games, I play on the Wii U.  I bought a 2DS about a year ago, and have played just about all of the games I wanted to on it, but haven't actively played it for 3+ months. It's got a great library of games though."

wiiu,3djyop,jozlod,2,Fri Jul 17 02:07:59 2015 UTC,Pro controllers are generally considered to be one of the best controllers Nintendo has made.  They are really good and definitely worth the money.

wiiu,3dibga,Essem7631,15,Thu Jul 16 17:46:33 2015 UTC,"Ehh, usually a AAA title is around $60-$65 at launch.  Amazon.ca is probably overpricing it right now so they can keep lowering the price. It'll piss people off if the price gets steeper as time goes on. Oh, and Amazon could potentially lose money if they started low, because anyone who pre-ordered at the low price would get to pay the lower price."

wiiu,3dmctb,Hashtag_Heel,2,Fri Jul 17 13:05:56 2015 UTC,"I myself cannot answer for the Sensor Bar, though I'd bet other Redditors will let us know.  32GB is only enough space if you don't plan on buying digital versions of games. If you do, you'll want to get yourself a nice 500gb+ external hard drive. I'm currently using a 1TB but that's because it's what I had laying around. I won't need that much space. (i doubt it anyway). 500gb or so should do the trick. In the way of Amiibo, it really depends on what your goal is. If you're a collector, it may be worth it from a fandom standpoint, if you're big on Nintendo. I myself am not much of a collector, but I will say this. Buy at least ONE Amiibo, so you can unlock Amiibo content across all most of the Amiibo games. If you get a Mario Amiibo for $10.00, you'll be able to unlock content for Smash, Mario Party, Mario Kart, and more. I have just the one Amiibo for that reason and it's unlocked all the Amiibo content for the games I own. (I have Link)"

It has to be centered for the natural feeling but doesn't need to be exactly close to the tv, heck, with enough distance you can even place it on the floor (did it many times when bringing my Wii to someone's else house for multiplayer! We were sitting on the floor too so that's why).  The Wii U package comes with a sensor support too, so you can place it anywhere and if you are feeling crafty you can buy some stickers and stick it on your set-up. :P"

For example, the Toad amiibo will unlock a new mode in Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker, a new map in Mario Party 10, a costume in Mario Party 8, and he also does small things in various other games.  Compare this to someone like Dark Pit, or Greninja who nothing special outside of Smash Bros."

I hope we'll see more of this in the future, and possibly revisit some other games (even if it's only a single T-Shirt design, I'd love to see this done for Splatoon).  Toad is also not the first example I'd think of, considering every other Mario series character has Smash Bros. compatability. (And the Toad mode in Treasure Tracker doesn't seem so great...)  Oddly enough, the Fire Emblem amiibo compatibility seems the best to me, even if the figures aren't too hot and you'd think the series was a harder sell than some. I mean, the whole point of this ""toys to life"" thing is supposed to be that you scan and play as the character you have a toy of. The FE amiibo are basically the only ones that do this (ok, Mario Maker will kind of reverse this)... and they do it in two games!"
wiiu,3dmctb,pick-a-spot,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:09:07 2015 UTC,"Sensor bar placement doesn't have to be too precise and the most popular Wii U titles don't use motion controls. Sometimes I'll bump the sensor bar, have it pointed the wrong way and not even notice.  I'm gonna respond to the other questions from a more frugal standpoint. I think people here are giving you the wrong impression about Amiibo. It looks like the most common suggestion is to get one Amiibo and use it to unlock content across multiple games. Honestly, you don't need ANY Amiibo. They aren't Nintendo's answer to DLC. They are primarily figurines, and the video game content that they unlock is relatively insignificant compared to map packs and video game expansions that other consoles offer.   If you buy physical copies of games, an occasional eShop title, and some DLC, then 32 GB is plenty. I have a 2GB system and a couple 8GB USB drives. Here's what fits on my console: Pikmin 3, Windwaker HD, Metroid Prime Trilogy, Wii Fit U, Game & Wario, Mario Kart DLC, Smash Bros updates and various DLC, both NES Remix games, some virtual console games (old-school games take very little space), Child of Light.  Do you think you will download 2 or 3 full-size Wii U titles and a three-disk set of Metroid?  In my opinion, it's not necessary to set aside money for Amiibo or a hard drive to make the Wii U worth having. Actually, I think the biggest investment that will be required outside of the system itself, is controllers."
wiiu,3dmctb,YuriusFarrence,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:40:56 2015 UTC,"the sensor bar can be put anywhere. You will then go on options and select weather it is on top of just below the tv. It will assume it's centred. it will then kind of estimate the size of your TV depending on how far your wii remote it from the sensor. This determines where you will point the thing.  The gamepad itself can be used as a wii remote also. So you can put it on your table and the aim will be more sensitive as its closer.  In most cases wii games use the  wii remote and wiiU games use the gamepad. Mario galaxy, red steel 2, zelda, and a few other games make good intuitive use of the wii mote. metroid prime and some shooters are also quite cool.  5gb's is used just on the OS. If you don't download games you are fine. For reference the metroid prime trilogy download is 7.7 gb. the smash bros update is 1.2 gb.  external hardrive. it has to be powered. If it's not you can use a y-cable.  I don't have any amiibo's. Don't need them for anything just yet, don't feel like I've missed out or anything"
wiiu,3dmctb,jesusnavas22,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:56:55 2015 UTC,"Regarding the Sensor Bar, mine is actually under the TV, just use some double sided tape for it so it sticks.  Just make sure that the sensor bar is not blocked by anything in front of it to be used.  The Amiibo things is actually a better form of DLC compared to what others offer because they work for multiple games.  Example of this is the Link Amiibo, I bought it for the spinner weapon from Hyrule Warriors, it also works for Smash Bros as an amiibo fighter and for Mario Kart 8 as a racing suit for the Miis.  Aside from that item being good for collecting its more than what its worth for the games.  I only bought the ones that are good for multiple games so I skipped the others."

wiiu,3dmbhp,Zspirit,2,Fri Jul 17 12:52:31 2015 UTC,"Those are the games I have too, I havent found anymore staples that I would recommend. The gamepad is a necessity for all games, however, the motion controls are not. I hate motion controls so I just use the joysticks on the game pad instead.

wiiu,3dmbhp,bookchaser,2,Fri Jul 17 14:54:24 2015 UTC,"When I want to play a pro controller supported game like MK8 or SSB, can I start it without using/booting the gamepad?   You can turn on the console by pressing the power button on the pro controller. Press the X button to move the icon menu to the TV screen so you can launch a game using the pro controller.  The gamepad itself will always turn on at the same time. You have three options there.    Ignore the gamepad screen. Place something in front of, or over, the screen so it's not a distraction. Grab the gamepad and go several menus deep to turn off the screen, then return the gamepad to its cradle. You'll have to do this every time you boot the console. Let the gamepad's battery drain and don't recharge it. Leave the gamepad on, and not plugged in while you play with the pro controller. It will take about 3 hours to drain. You'll then only need to charge it (or use it while tethered to the USB cord) when you play a game that requires the gamepad, or to access console configuration menus or the eShop.    How do you guys think nintendo will be handling the pro controller support, I notice some first party games don't support them (marioparty, nintendoland). Im really sad about marioparty needing wiimotes.    Games that require a wiimote typically use motion controls. That's where you tip, turn, swing or shake the wiimote to do something in a game. Mario Party and Nintendo Land are such games. Mario Kart 8 is an exception in that you don't have to play with motion controls. Not all Nintendo-made games use motion controls; it's just that Nintendo is the primary company that makes motion control games.  Pro controllers lack motion controls. (I personally believe/speculate Nintendo's next console will have motion controls built into its pro controller.)   There are Pro controllers from china for like 20$ are they any good?   For imitation pro controllers, people complain about the sticks and/or buttons and/or battery life. An official pro controller's battery life is 80 hours."
wiiu,3dmbhp,toonpik7,2,Fri Jul 17 13:53:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much!  This explains why I was able to boot my wiiu without the gamepad, the battery was empty. Its a little strange, looks like ill have to charge the gamepad like every two days without actually using it. But I will take that for granted or leave it empty till I need it. I rather pay 50$ for a good controller than 20$ for that wont last a year. Thank for all the info!"
wiiu,3dmbhp,bookchaser,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:43:26 2015 UTC,"Do you think Nintendo would ever update the system so that the gamepad wouldn't automatically turn on with the system, and make all menus usable with the Pro? That would be a dream come to true for me."
wiiu,3dmbhp,toonpik7,3,Fri Jul 17 17:11:03 2015 UTC,"I doubt it. There are a lot of other serious problems with the OS they haven't addressed. The parental controls are horribly broken.  More importantly, they based the entire console around the gamepad and are hung up about proving its value. After launch, very few games used the gamepad screen in a meaningful manner, even Nintendo games. This year, Nintendo is making their game releases all about the gamepad.  Splatoon is maybe the best example so far, but all it does is display a map that lets you jump around to other locations on the map. That, and the motion control element of the game.  Except, the map functionality could easily be replicated on-screen. And, a hack was announced that lets you play a portion of Splatoon using a pro controller with a wiimote strapped to it. And... it's so much better than the gamepad! The gamepad feels like a clumsy brick afterward.  So, making it easier for users to disable the gamepad screen would be like admitting they made a mistake.  I'm hoping the next console is centered around pro controllers with a gyroscope added... and the gamepad is ditched entirely. We'll see.  There are some novel uses of the gamepad (Splatoon is awesome), but mostly I use pro controllers whenever possible."
wiiu,3dmbhp,TheYearOfWaluigi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:44:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it sucks that they won't admit their mistake. I mean, Splatoon could easily have a minimap onscreen showing teamate locations that correspond to d-pad directions."

If you're more for multiplayer, although you hate motion controls, I would recommend getting 3 or 4 of these:  https://store.nintendo.com/ng3/browse/productDetailColorSizePicker.jsp?productId=prod150198  And then maybe get this Gamecube Adapter for Smash multiplayer as even though you dislike cables it sounds like you may have a few Gamecube Controllers lying around.  http://www.amazon.com/Mayflash-GameCube-Controller-Adapter-Wii/dp/B00RSXRLUE/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1437143461&sr=1-1&keywords=gamecube+adapter  Having 3 or 4 Wii Remotes + Nunchucks, at least one Pro Controller, and the Gamecube Adapter will enable you to play pretty much every multiplayer game on the Wii U.

Zelda & others are a nice addition. The thing is we also like mario party. But it looks like I have to buy four motion plus controllers witch is still more expensive than i thought. Marioparty and wii sports(resorts) will probably be the only two games we will play with motion+ controllers so I dont think I am willing to pay that much to play those.

wiiu,3dft3f,maturra,19,Wed Jul 15 22:52:50 2015 UTC,"Quick Analysis  Nintendo  This is, without a doubt, a good week for Nintendo overall... sales-wise. The tragedy that struck over the weekend hurt all round, so definitely not speaking in that regard.  Software on Nintendo hardware controlled 15 of the top 20 spots this week, with three new titles entering the charts.  On the 3DS Front  That said, Yo-Kai Watch Busters: Red Cat Team & White Dog Squad (3DS) sailed into the top spot with 693,538 sales. This is a far cry from Yokai Watch 2's debut sales of 1,312,433, but it's certainly nothing to sneeze at. And, given the strength of the Yo-Kai watch brand in Japan, this one is sure to be a regular in the charts for some time to come.  Great Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney (3DS) opened strongly as well, moving  135,690 in its debut week. The final newcomer on Nintendo hardware, Super Run For Money Tousouchuu Atsumare! Saikyou no Tousou Monotachi, charged into the #7 spot, with 13,571 total sales. This is low, for sure, but the previous Run For Money game was a bit of an anomaly in itself. The title became known for its simply inhuman legs, appearing on the charts for what seemed like forever after its release. I can't help but wonder if the new title will do the same.  Fire Emblem: Fates dropped to the #4 spot, with 29,682 sales this week (345,253 LTD), which is a good hold overall. The title is trending roughly on par with Awakening. To my knowledge, the game is still sold out in places, and stocking has been a factor in overall numbers. Last week, ZSaberLink noted a far higher total was reported by Famitsu, for reasons not reported clearly. We're still seeing this discrepancy week over week, as Famitsu tracks the game at about 100,000 more than the Media Create numbers.  But that's an aside. ;D   Rhythm Heaven The Best + continues to hold strong, with another 24,650 sales (325,844 LTD), and a #6 placement. This places the game slightly behind  its Wii prequel in the tracking, but still trending well overall.  The remaining titles on the charts are made up of a lot of familiar names. That's not necessarily a bad thing, mind you! Dragon Ball Z Super Ultimate Fighter Kamehameha'd its way to the #10 spot with 4,642 sales this week (110,087 LTD). Pokemon wasn't ready to give up the ghost, though. Pokemon ORAS sold just 34 units less than Dragon Ball, taking a well-earned #11 with 4,608 sales (2,657,661 LTD).  Animal Crossing: New Leaf has returned to its place in the charts, partly due to a new ad campaign. The game sold 4,232 copies (3,996,960 LTD), and earned its #13 placement. This will likely pass 4 million within the next two weeks.  After this, the numbers drop, sharply. Style Savvy 3 claimed #14, with a paltry 2,847 sales (128,414 LTD). The bottom three sellers for the handheld, PoPoLoCrois X Harvest Moon (2,757, #17), Smash 3DS (2,746, #18), and Puzzle & Dragons: Mario Edition (1,901, #20) aren't too far behind.  On the Wii U Front  Splatoon's sales have finally begun their backslide. The game moved 26,136 units this week (408,312 LTD), and proudly claimed the #5 spot in the charts.  Mario Kart 8 continues to putter along the middle of the charts. This week, the game sold 6,708 copies (1,060,442 LTD), claiming the #9 spot overall. Smash Bros. Wii U managed to make one more appearance at the bottom of the charts as well, selling 2,218 copies (653,783 LTD), and earning a #19 finish.  On the Hardware Front  The 3DS had both the highest Single SKU and Multi SKU sales this week. The New 3DS XL sold 21,069 units this week, with the entire 3DS family moving 28,703 overall.  The Wii U's fun times are over for the time being, as sales of the system shifted back to 10,780 for the week. Still, the ride was awesme while it lasted. :)   Sony  Sony had a somewhat respectable showing this week, though it didn't exactly light gamer passions aflame.   Taiko no Tatsujin: V Version (Vita) soloed its way into the #3 spot this week, with 46,101 sales overall. Minecraft continues to be a consistent seller on the Vita, with another 10,898 units (243,428 LTD) copies sold, and a #8 placement.   It seems that the sun's starting to rise on Persona 4: Dancing All Night, though. The title sold 4,449 copies this week (111,513), which caused it to boogie down to the #12 spot.  On the PS4, it's a week of familiar faces. The Witcher 3 hunted down the #15 spot, with another 2,847 copies this week. Devil May Cry 4's stylish action allowed the title to take the #16 spot, with 2,772 sales (50,017 LTD).  Hardware-wise, the PS4 and Vita took #2 and #3 in Single-SKU sales. The PS4 sold a total of 15,779 units this week, as the Vits moved 13,632. The PS3 is still kicking, with another 2,979 units moved during the sales period.  Microsoft  XBox One sold 149 units. This is about a quarter of Sony's PlayStation TV's sales in the region.  [NeoGAF Link]"
wiiu,3dft3f,ZSaberLink,5,Wed Jul 15 22:53:29 2015 UTC,"Yokai Watch Busters is a spinoff that uses a lot of assets of YW2. It did VERY well for a spin-off. Comparing it to YW2 sales is kind of misleading. It did better than any Pokemon spinoff has ever done in its first week for example.  The Great Ace Attorney had a poor opening week. The traditional Ace Attorney games (with Phoenix & Apollo Justice) sold closer to 200-250K on its first week). While this is technically also a spinoff in terms of setting/characters, the gameplay is very similar (unlike Ace Attorney Investigations) and Capcom is trying to push this as its own series (possibly replacing or sitting alongside the main Phoenix Wright games). However, the 1st week sales were about the same as Ace Attorney Investigations 2, which was the worst selling title in the franchise. Hopefully it'll sell well in the upcoming weeks if it's a high quality game.  While Wii U hardware sales have started their backslide, they're still above last year (10K vs. 8K). Technically Yoshi releases next week in Japan, so perhaps it (or the ADORABLE amiibos), will sell Wii Us or something (my bet is on the Amiibos =P).  I believe Minecraft has helped Taiko have a decent opening week of sales as now kids actually own Vitas. It's definitely better than how the Wii U Taiko titles opened (17K and 9K respectively), and Taiko titles typically have pretty good legs.  For your comment about Fire Emblem Fates, while it's never explicitly discussed why there is a difference in sales between Famitsu & Media Create, we know that only Famitsu counts Download card purchase sales. Now if the game was sold out in its first week, there may have been a significant number of download cards sold, thus explaining part of the difference in sales between the two trackers (in addition to Famitsu combining the normal & special edition SKU sales numbers)."
wiiu,3dft3f,antipromaybe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:13:47 2015 UTC,"Good point on Yokai Watch's spinoff status. Considering this, it did incredibly well.   However, I'm still going to say that Phoenix did decently. Given that it's a spinoff, gameplay aside, I'm a bit more lenient on the title. Sure, it didn't move the numbers that Ace Attorney 5 did in its opening week, but it sold more than other recent spinoff Professor Layton vs. Ace Attorney.  Agreed on Taiko, though. It's a fantastic opening that's likely fueled by the new audience coming in with Minecraft. Also, good catch on the Fire Emblem totals. That definitely makes sense. :)"

I don't know if this is going to pull off that perfect storm of cliché that DDoC managed, but dammit it looks like they're gonna try."

wiiu,3det5a,DumbieCrumbs,21,Thu Jul 16 15:07:12 2015 UTC,"Same.  As I mentioned in another post the way critics are reacting to this reminds me of Killer is Dead, Lollipop Chainsaw, No More Heroes, Akiba's Trip, and more, in the fact the game is so weird, over the top, and just strange that we have reviewers taking the moral high ground on it and saying how above it they are.  For fucks sake, in the video preview that was posted they complained that GRENADES TOOK TOO LONG TO BLOW UP and bitched about that for like a minute and that there were WEAPONS IN A CHURCH... Like, fuck, are we THAT nitpicky on games now?  The fuck?  I'm expecting the game to be bad, but much like how KiD, No More Heroes, and Akiba's Trip are all ""bad"" but amazingly fun and hilarious to play."

The gameplay was strange and repetitive at times, but it wasn't about all that. It was about creating an atmosphere and telling a story, no matter how weird that story is. Hopefully Devil's Third is like this. All these reviewers are basing their ratings on expectations without accepting a diverse style or storytelling method. Just like with Killer7, they just can't handle the strange."

wiiu,3det5a,Moulinoski,2,Thu Jul 16 02:48:00 2015 UTC,The first one had a fair amount of flaws. Shitty framerate was the main one.

They went on and on about how bad it is... but the video told me a completely different story. Including the ""controls badly"" comment seemed strange considering how well they were controlling it. I only saw one legitimate graphical complaint and it's that there was this random car that looked like it was built in 1995 (like, outdate textures and model)."

Then, I luckily came by this post, and you've managed to reignite my excitement. I haven't played a truly shitty game in years, but I grew up playing plenty. And I loved them. From crappy licensed games based on movies, to poorly made handheld versions of console games, a large majority of the games I've ever played aren't considered to be ""good"". Hell, sometimes, I feel like I'm the only one in the world who enjoyed playing Shadow Tje Hedgehog. There's just something so charming about a bad game. It's a charm that's similar to that of a move like Sharknado or Birdemic. The beauty lies in its inferiority."

You can plug in an external drive though, and copy the game/save data to it:   Go to the System Settings Select Data Management  From the Data Management menu, select Copy/Move/Delete Data Select System Memory and all the Games and Apps on your console will be displayed. Press X to select items to Copy/Move.  You can now select all the games that you would like to backup with their save data/files included. Next, choose to which external device you would like to copy the data onto.   edit - I should also add that this data is locked to your specific device.  For your purposes it should work, however, if your Wii U died, or was reformatted you can't restore that data to it.  So it's not really a backup.  It's just freeing up internal memory on your device."

I just started playing it again a few weeks ago. This was the game that sold me on buying a wii u even though I played the game cube one like 2 times.

I don't know how I ended up missing the rest of the series; I did have a GameCube and DS Lite before my current Wii U and 3DS XL. I blame Costco, since my parents bought my GameCube there in a special bundle that didn't come with the Zelda promo disk that other GameCubes came with.  I've just got past the first Forbidden Fortress dungeon in Wind Waker. I like the game a lot. There's some problems, imo, with controls, but otherwise I can see why the series is so great."
wiiu,3dfpzs,myuusmeow,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:51:12 2015 UTC,I have actually not played Wind Waker because I haven't owned a Nintendo console since N64 till yesterday when I bought a Wii U.  I will be playing that pretty soon.  I'm pretty excited!  It's unfortunate I'll have to skip Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword due to me hating the forced motion controls on the Wii versions.

wiiu,3dd3w1,thebannedknight,34,Wed Jul 15 09:29:51 2015 UTC,As expected from Monolithsoft. Xenoblade Chronicles looked gorgeous too and that was a Wii game.
wiiu,3dd3w1,AdmiralJuicy,11,Wed Jul 15 11:47:01 2015 UTC,"I agree, however I still can't believe how much of a graphical improvement they have made."
wiiu,3dd3w1,Xenowait,21,Wed Jul 15 12:04:04 2015 UTC,I disagree.  XC looked good graphically for a Wii game.  Compared to everything else coming out in HD on other better consoles XC looked liked poo.  480p to 1080p is quite the leap.  I'm getting tired of the Xenowait.
wiiu,3dd3w1,Yhdiste,29,Wed Jul 15 14:17:08 2015 UTC,"It's not leaping to 1080p, it's a 720p game with 30 FPS.  And to be honest, the same thing can be said about this game. It looks good for a Wii U game, but compared to other current generation games, it's not that amazing, especially when character models are factored as well. One could argue the difference in scale and whatnot, but that doesn't change its visuals one bit.  In any case, I don't really care about graphics. After all, most of my gaming at the moment is on 3DS."
wiiu,3dd3w1,Happypumkin,8,Wed Jul 15 15:13:11 2015 UTC,I like the character models in X

wiiu,3dd3w1,KTR1988,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:13:33 2015 UTC,"The character models have little to do with graphical limitations, that's just the visual style they went with for better or for worse. On any other platform they'd just be shinier and more detailed versions of the same Kunihiko Tanaka based character designs."
wiiu,3dd3w1,C-Towner,6,Fri Jul 17 19:30:29 2015 UTC,"I believe that X is running at 720 and not 1080. I believe that was to maintain a smoother and constant framerate, though saving space on assets could be a factor as well.  I'll agree on the wait though :/ Waaaay too long between Japanese and Western releases, this shit should not be happening in 2015, I thought we were past these kinds of shenanigans."
wiiu,3dd3w1,Khalirei,8,Wed Jul 15 15:14:02 2015 UTC,"When i go from smash bros to splatoon, i can tell the difference in resolution.  There's way too many jagged edges everywhere, way too pixelated.  Not looking forward to that."
wiiu,3dd3w1,C-Towner,2,Wed Jul 15 16:34:51 2015 UTC,"The jagged edges are as a result of two factors: one is resolution, the other is anti-aliasing (using additional processing to smooth the edges). Anti-aliasing absolutely makes the bigger impact on smoothing those edges, but is hardware intensive. Nintendo in general for first party titles seems to trend more towards low anti-aliasing.   That being said, the HD videos I have seen for X seems to look pretty good with anti-aliasing to reduce the jagged edges. Can't say for sure, since I have not seen it running on a Wii U, only videos captured. But I am cautiously optomistic that they took more care than a lot of first party titles like Splatoon (I definitely agree on the jaggies there)."
wiiu,3dd3w1,Khalirei,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:42:35 2015 UTC,"Would be nice if it runs some sort of AA, I don't mind the 30 fps either, it's just crazy they lowered the res and frame rate for this title.  I really hope the next console is a power house unlike all other consoles before it."
wiiu,3dd3w1,Xenowait,-11,Wed Jul 15 17:09:35 2015 UTC,I was referring system max res spec.  I never bought a Wii solely because of 480p.  I refuse to allow my eyes to lay upon anything lower than 720p.  My eyes need max p!
wiiu,3dd3w1,C-Towner,3,Wed Jul 15 15:25:45 2015 UTC,"You do realize that the ""p"" refers to progressive scan and is not specifically related to the resolution? I'm not sure if any of the consoles of this generation even output in interlaced video. So I am unsure what   My eyes need max p!   even means. ""My eyes need max progressive scan!""? Its either on or off, you can't have more or less of it.  Anyways, you are correct that the Wii U can output at 1080 resolution."
wiiu,3dd3w1,Xenowait,-18,Wed Jul 15 15:32:25 2015 UTC,"dude you need to get a sense of humor.  I'll explain the joke since you are dumb.

Oh and in case you are not aware progressive is better than interlaced that is why I did not say My eyes need max i.  Get it simpleton?"

wiiu,3dd3w1,seeyoshirun,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:03:06 2015 UTC,"On a technical level? Obviously. The Wii was less powerful than 360/PS3, so that's a given.  In spite of that I'd still say Xenoblade was one of the best-looking games of last gen just because of how awesome the artistic direction was. There were more wow moments in that game than in probably any 360 game I played."
wiiu,3dd3w1,JakeBake,14,Thu Jul 16 00:31:42 2015 UTC,"Still looking forward to it, but my hype is honestly dying by the day at this point.  Initially, I was insanely pumped for this game and couldn't wait another day.  I think I've been waiting for it a bit too long now to not be slightly disappointed with it.  This is backed up by the somewhat lackluster Japanese reviews I've seen.  Environments were great in XC, battle system was okay, but where it really stuck with me was the music, and story.  The music seems to be top notch again, but I'm extremely disappointed to be hearing that the story elements are weaker.  I may just need to temper my expectations.  I think they made a massive mistake trying to BS the initial 2014 release date.  I have a hard time believing they actually thought they'd get it out by then if it's only coming at the very last minute of 2015.  That cycle of expectations/ let downs for release dates really forces me to expect more of the game, which it may not deliver."
wiiu,3dd3w1,RyanB_,2,Wed Jul 15 16:28:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that and the insanely long time its taking to release the game in NA and PAL (half a year) is pretty damn unacceptable nowadays imo"
wiiu,3dd3w1,JakeBake,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:29:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah it sucks having to wait, but I can kinda forgive them considering the scale of the game.  There has to be an absurd amount of dialogue and text.  I feel you, just nowhere near as unacceptable as the Yoshi situation."
wiiu,3dd3w1,YuriusFarrence,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:54:00 2015 UTC,Music is guaranteed to be awesome.  Its made by Hiroyuki Sawano!  So fans of music he made for popular anime will enjoy the music on this game.  I'm still hoping we get a bundle for XCX with the soundtrack.
wiiu,3dd3w1,boopaboopa,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:38:45 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the story in XC wasn't that great. It was typical JRPG faire. It was just well told."
wiiu,3dd3w1,JakeBake,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:48:01 2015 UTC,"For me, the story hit me hard and ultimately stuck with me because of the pacing.    It felt generic and somewhat bland up until the last third of the game, where everything was turned upside down.  From that point on, I couldn't put it down, and it justified the time I spent getting through it.  I'm also a sucker for existential crises so that also added to the impact for me."
wiiu,3dd3w1,boopaboopa,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:56:11 2015 UTC,"I dunno. I found it predictable. Not only with Number 7, but also with how it would end. It reminded me of a few JRPGs I'd played before.. especially the ending/message. Maybe it's because I've play so many JRPGs since the 80s that it just didn't surprise me. I mean.. it was nothing compared to the twists in games like Lufia, Legend of Dragoon, or Persona 4 in my opinion."
wiiu,3dd3w1,JakeBake,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:02:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I suppose you're right in that it may have simply been well told.  But that coupled with subject matter that speaks to me made it feel more substantial to me."

wiiu,3dd3w1,CeleryDistraction,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:10:54 2015 UTC,"I thought TLOU was pretty unique.  Cool twist on zombies-- infected vs undead. Father/Daughter relationship being the main focus is rare anywhere but especially in games.   I know what you mean though at its core the story is basically one of the saviour travelling a great distance (road trip) to save the world. But I think nearly every story can be  deduced down to a generic plot.   Basically I just mean to say I think TLOU story puts a fresh twist on a tired genre, while maintain interesting characters within a relationship dynamic that is rarely explored. Or plainly put, TLOUs story is great for many reasons beyond just being well told."

wiiu,3dd3w1,The_real_mindfk,2,Wed Jul 15 12:24:36 2015 UTC,What's wrong with the battle system?
wiiu,3dd3w1,poopnuts,8,Wed Jul 15 12:55:47 2015 UTC,"It's MMO style, which is boring to a lot of people, myself included. A proper real time battle system would be more engaging."
wiiu,3dd3w1,The_real_mindfk,12,Wed Jul 15 14:00:44 2015 UTC,I am a bit confused.  Isn't MMO style real time?  As opposed to turn based.  Is the fighting in X like Xenoblade Chronicles?
wiiu,3dd3w1,NCan,12,Wed Jul 15 14:13:25 2015 UTC,All he means is that he'd rather be pressing A instead of there being auto-attack.
wiiu,3dd3w1,poopnuts,6,Wed Jul 15 14:48:55 2015 UTC,"It's real time as in time doesn't stop between actions but skills are on cool-down so you spend a lot of time standing in one place waiting for skills to be ready again while the super weak auto-attack does its thing. Yes, there are attacks that rely on your position relative to the enemy to do more damage so there is some maneuvering involved but it just felt very lackluster, to me.  From what all the footage has shown, XCX uses the same type of combat system from XC. It does look like each character has a melee and ranged attack, which should add some variety, but not enough to make it interesting to me. Not trying to say you shouldn't play it or that it's going to be a bad game, only that XC didn't live up to the hype for me and it looks like XCX carries on a lot of the aspects I didn't like about XC."
wiiu,3dd3w1,The_real_mindfk,3,Wed Jul 15 14:59:37 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean, come to think of it, I found the combat system in Xenoblade boring as well."
wiiu,3dd3w1,Tramd,2,Wed Jul 15 15:21:03 2015 UTC,Well that completely kills it for me.... It's going to make the game feel like a lonely mmo
wiiu,3dd3w1,_Ariana_Grande_,0,Wed Jul 15 19:55:18 2015 UTC,Auto attacking fills up the talent gauge brush. And that was pretty important in the original game.
wiiu,3dd3w1,TSPhoenix,3,Wed Jul 15 20:10:52 2015 UTC,I watched all the Treehouse Live sessions for X and I just couldn't wrap my head around what everyone is getting so excited for.   I mean I watched a segment where they just ran from point A to point B for three minutes then fought a boss and the combat seems just so stiff and uninteresting. It was all very generic MMO stuff.  Even if I was into MMOs I'm not even sure what would make me want to pick up X over like playing an actual MMO with friends.
wiiu,3dd3w1,poopnuts,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:58:28 2015 UTC,"It's fun at first because it's something new but it did get very repetitive. People talk about the depth you can achieve with the combat system based on how many skills there are but there are skill combos that clearly work better than others so, like any other game where you use effective tactics more than the rest, you end up using those more often."
wiiu,3dd3w1,henryuuk,-1,Wed Jul 15 15:05:31 2015 UTC,"Same for me, it's essentially an MMORPG withouth the MassiveMultiplayerOnline part...    Couldn't get into the battle system in the previous one, not gonna lay out money for the same type of battle mechanics  but with mech's"
wiiu,3dd3w1,el-toro-loco,4,Wed Jul 15 15:02:55 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one around here who liked the battle system? I get tired of JRPGs when I get into an ordinary battle, and all I'm doing is selecting ""attack"" ""attack"" ""attack"". This game does the tedious tapping for me.

wiiu,3dd3w1,Tramd,0,Wed Jul 15 17:12:42 2015 UTC,Well you'll probably just be tapping those skill buttons instead waiting for them to come off cool down. Not really much different.   I miss turn based systems.

wiiu,3dd3w1,raindroplet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:01:30 2015 UTC,"You honestly don't need to worry too much about gems until the middle or endgame. Even then, you don't need to kill yourself over it.  Affinity, you should try to up. Basically, have Shulk give certain party members certain items and it will (hopefully) improve their relationship. There are guides online as to what works, but I just made my own list after seeing their responses. It's pretty easy to spam. Likewise, saving almost dead partners can increase affinity.  Regardless, you aren't alone. Xenoblade is one of my absolute favorite games but I hate the combat and systems under the hood, haha. I just remember being floored when I first saw the Mechonis on Bionis' Knee for the first time."

wiiu,3dd3w1,el-toro-loco,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:38:02 2015 UTC,You can also boost affinity by switching out party members and assisting in battle.
wiiu,3dd3w1,henryuuk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:13:40 2015 UTC,"There was nothing 'understanding' about it, I just didn't like the battle system. I got past the part with the furball joining you (rickie I think), finally gave up roughly 25 minutes later."
wiiu,3dd3w1,Butter_Is_Life,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:04:28 2015 UTC,"I liked Xenoblade's battle system for what it was, but the structured story and lovable characters were my favorite parts about Chronicles. Knowing that's changed radically makes me a lot less hyped. I like an RPG to have a cast I care about a lot, and I'm not sure what's here that brings that together. :/"
wiiu,3dd3w1,henryuuk,0,Wed Jul 15 14:12:38 2015 UTC,"I found the story and characters to be pretty generic ""Jrpg"" story material, and the exploration aspect could not save the battle system for me."
wiiu,3dd3w1,_Ariana_Grande_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:06:14 2015 UTC,Opposite for me. Probably one of best stories in RPG history. And best cutscene cinematography of all time.
wiiu,3dd3w1,Xenowait,-2,Wed Jul 15 20:13:48 2015 UTC,I agree it is one of the best stories in RPG history it just sucks you have to play the game to get through the story.  Every single battle is exactly the same.
wiiu,3dd3w1,UrbanGermanBourbon,0,Wed Jul 15 20:53:15 2015 UTC,"Fully agree. I couldn't get into XC, mostly because of the combat system. I'd prefer anything to the MMO style, even turn-based.   In this day and age, there's no reason for the combat not to be fluid action."
wiiu,3dd3w1,henryuuk,-2,Wed Jul 15 16:21:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's really a shame, aah well. I'll just watch my friend play it for a bit while I'm playing something else or something"
wiiu,3dd3w1,Peged,7,Wed Jul 15 16:25:08 2015 UTC,"Large scale environments can look nice, but there's absolutely no detail in the nearby surrounding area. Think about the pacing of a Mario game, there's detail all around you. Running across an empty plain devoid of life is pretty bland.  You can put your camera on the ground to show the grass, but you're not going to be playing like that."
wiiu,3dd3w1,raindroplet,12,Wed Jul 15 13:21:33 2015 UTC,"Xenoblade is all about the large scenery and being wowed by the size of it all. It's a game of scale and exploration, not subtlety.  Xenoblade Chronicles still managed to have some pretty cool hidden details along the way too. I wouldn't write the game out yet."
wiiu,3dd3w1,poopnuts,3,Wed Jul 15 13:56:32 2015 UTC,"Xenoblade Chronicles still managed to have some pretty cool hidden details along the way too.    I played XC and didn't find this to be true. Of course, it depends on your interpretation of ""pretty cool hidden details"" but can you name more than half a dozen interesting things that you found off the beaten path (monsters not included)?"
wiiu,3dd3w1,el-toro-loco,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:11:00 2015 UTC,"I think Valak Mountain is a good example of a location with hidden treasures. You can go straight down the mountain and move the quest along, but you can also explore the various caves along the way and find cool stuff like the giant ice-slide.  There are treasures all over the place, but you usually only find them when doing side quests (even though some quests can be tedious)."
wiiu,3dd3w1,UrbanGermanBourbon,6,Wed Jul 15 17:18:44 2015 UTC,Please use imgur for images.  That isn't a great shot of XCX. I've seen at least 20 far better shots. The game runs at 720 res. Why take and post a pic that is reduced to 450 when trying to showcase visuals?   Get it together OP.
wiiu,3dd3w1,tails_the_gay_fox,2,Wed Jul 15 16:27:19 2015 UTC,Oh shit! I forgot this was coming out this year. I just went and made a bunch of pre orders for ps4 games and forgot this much more important one. Well I know what I am doing at 10:00 am today. Luckily I work a 3 min walk away from a game store. I loved xenoblade on the wii and not just because of shirtless Shulk (though that was nice). I liked the combat and what they got out of the wii. Best looking wii game on par with skyward sword. So I am excited what they will do with the wii u hardware.

wiiu,3decug,Sylverstone14,9,Wed Jul 15 16:43:25 2015 UTC,Aaaand I'm rebuying this for the Wii U. I seriously forgot that this was even coming...it's been probably a year since i've played this.
wiiu,3decug,Rekkore,3,Wed Jul 15 16:45:09 2015 UTC,I remember this being shown back on the e3 2014 Direct. I thought it had come out by now.

wiiu,3ddvyv,azndavey,36,Wed Jul 15 14:38:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is some pretty obvious Kamiya-esque damage control coming from Itagaki.  Except, you know, Kamiya's games usually aren't slated to flop this fucking badly."
wiiu,3ddvyv,GomaN1717,20,Wed Jul 15 15:38:03 2015 UTC,Kamiya's games only flop financially. I've never seen him games get panned this bad at all.
wiiu,3ddvyv,Butter_Is_Life,23,Wed Jul 15 15:47:51 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm saying. When Kamiya does it over Twitter, it's usually more tongue-in-cheek responses to bitter fanboys about Bayonetta 2's/Scalebound's exclusivity.   When Itagaki does it... it's just sad."
wiiu,3ddvyv,GomaN1717,5,Wed Jul 15 15:50:52 2015 UTC,"Oh, I understand what you mean now, thanks for clarifying. :)"

wiiu,3ddvyv,graciliano,2,Wed Jul 15 21:11:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, his games have similar review patterns from what I can tell on metacritic, with his only poorly recieved games other than Devil's Third being the DoA: Xtreme games. Funny that both Itakagi and Kamiya tend to be a bit controversial in their own ways."
wiiu,3ddvyv,Butter_Is_Life,2,Wed Jul 15 21:16:49 2015 UTC,"Itakagi is really good at making games though that doesn't mean it's impossible for him to release a bad one.  I think I'll wait for the impressions of some youtubers I follow before deciding if it's bad, because I don't think my taste line up with most mainstream reviewers. Noticed that when The Witcher 3 was getting 10/10s across the board even though it had horrible movement controls."
wiiu,3ddvyv,graciliano,3,Wed Jul 15 21:26:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Grand Theft Auto IV got super high reviews despite having a lot of really bland, repetitive missions and wonky controls, (I still loved the store much more than V's, though) so reviews are certainly not everything.  Still, the gameplay I've seen so far from people with review copies just seem really bad. Mindless enemies, a lack of weight to animations, boring bosses, constant framedrops....eeeugh. Best of luck."
wiiu,3ddvyv,Butter_Is_Life,2,Wed Jul 15 21:33:22 2015 UTC,"Still, the gameplay I've seen so far from people with review copies just seem really bad. Mindless enemies, a lack of weight to animations, boring bosses, constant framedrops....eeeugh. Best of luck.   It's very unlike Ninja Gaiden 1 and 2 which ran great and had a lot of awesome bosses. I have to hope that it means he focused on the multiplayer instead, haha."
wiiu,3ddvyv,graciliano,2,Wed Jul 15 21:41:30 2015 UTC,"It could end up being a Metroid Prime Hunters situation, where the single player was slapped together and all the focus was put on the multiplayer!"
wiiu,3ddvyv,Butter_Is_Life,2,Wed Jul 15 21:42:32 2015 UTC,The occasional journalist who doesn't actually play video games will pan Kamiya's/Platinum's work
wiiu,3ddvyv,PraisetheBenis,4,Wed Jul 15 19:13:09 2015 UTC,"That's the only occasion I think could end up that way. Almost all of Kamiya's directed works I'm aware of did fantastic (from Metacritic);  Bayonetta - 91   Devil May Cry - 94  The Wonderful 101 - 78  Resident Evil 2- 89  Viewtiful Joe - 94  Okami - 93  The Wonderful 101 is pretty much his most controversially rated game, really. But I understand what you mean!"
wiiu,3ddvyv,Butter_Is_Life,3,Wed Jul 15 19:22:40 2015 UTC,I think Wonderful 101 would have been a lot less controversial if they would have started you with the all of the game's core abilities. The first playthrough is pretty lame and you feel like you are missing really important elements (because you are).
wiiu,3ddvyv,PoppedCollars,3,Wed Jul 15 19:59:28 2015 UTC,"Eh, Bayonetta didn't start you with all the core abilties, either, but it's a bit more accessible and easier to understand at first glance than TW101. TW101 is a pretty unique concept, one I still haven't quite wrapped my head around, but once you do it seems to flow well."
wiiu,3ddvyv,Butter_Is_Life,4,Wed Jul 15 20:00:52 2015 UTC,"Somewhat, but I think Bayonetta is a lot more functional at the start of the game. It didn't feel like things were missing in the way that TW101 did. Like in TW101, you need to unlock your ability to block and dodge...that's pretty silly."
wiiu,3ddvyv,PoppedCollars,2,Wed Jul 15 20:15:39 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with unlocking in Wonderful 101--it's the blatant disregard of proper context sensitive instructions in the game that makes it a pain the first time through. Aside from a few select moments, the game throws you to the sharks and leaves you to figure things out on your own. And this would be fine in a game with far fewer abilities and simpler controls, but that doesn't describe 101 at all. I'm all for a steep learning curve if it is a natural aspect of the game, but 101 felt like it is artificially difficult due to the removal or omission of necessary cues. The game is still fun, but it is very easy to see why critics weren't so hot on it and why the fan base is relatively small."
wiiu,3ddvyv,rufio_vega,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:10:22 2015 UTC,"That's also very true. There were definitely some moments where I just had no idea what I was supposed to do or how I was supposed to kill something. The game does make an attempt to teach you what you need to know, but it's a pretty poor teacher."

wiiu,3debhe,Butter_Is_Life,6,Thu Jul 16 01:05:46 2015 UTC,"Good lord this is just hilariously bad to watch. Everything you fight is a mindless bullet sponge, and nothing seems to have any weight or consequence to it, from the animations to your shooting to the bosses to....anything at all. It definitely looks like a ""so bad it's good"" kind of game, but certainly not one I'd get at full price.   Looks like a very 5-6/10 kind of game, at least for the single player. Hopefully the multiplayer could be good...but things don't look good so far. It's just one video, and edited for that matter, but...hmm."
wiiu,3debhe,beckert26,3,Wed Jul 15 21:08:47 2015 UTC,There no way this is 5-6/10. Maybe in 2010 this gets a 5. But I think from this video its like a 3/10.
wiiu,3debhe,Butter_Is_Life,2,Wed Jul 15 23:17:31 2015 UTC,"I dunno. If the multiplayer is solid and there's nothing gamebreaking, I could really see it being a 5/6. If it has gamebreaking bugs and no redeemable features, then I agree, 3 seems appropriate. It's too soon to definitively tell, I suppose."
wiiu,3debhe,JungleLoveChild,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:17:03 2015 UTC,The multiplayer seemed ambitious when they showed it at e3. The game seems to control fine. If they deliver on the whole base building thing maybe the game will have a chance.

wiiu,3debhe,reali-tglitch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:13:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I played the right Ninja Gaiden, but if I recall correctly the game was a ridiculous giblet fest about being a bad ass. I'll reserve my opinion until I've seen more, but from what I can tell their complaints boil down to ""it's not gears of war"", and then ""I want to play more anyway"".   Sure it's cringey, but it doesn't look to run like fucking Sonic Boom. It's an over the top invincible ninja simulator. ""It's just so ridiculous, that I kind of love it"", well its meant to be ridiculous...   Again I'd like to see how 'poorly' it runs first hand before I agree or disagree with people saying it ""is clearly a piece of shit"" after just watching a video praising it for it's shite.  And heck, the multiplayer still has watermelons, right?"
wiiu,3debhe,horacebhorace,-1,Thu Jul 16 08:23:25 2015 UTC,The smugness with which the guys in that video deride anyone for thinking this might become a cult classic is irritating.

wiiu,3dd463,rjung,3,Wed Jul 15 16:36:29 2015 UTC,"Disagree entirely.  While the game is most likely ""bad"", a lot of reviewers are taking the moral highground circle jerk approach saying how beneath them the game is and such.   Hell in this preview he states - ""'It's so bad, it's good' can apply to parts of Devil's Third.  But not once did I think the developers were in on the joke"".  A game where you go from decapitating a guy to drumming a metal song to running around in a chicken hat killing people with watermelons and boxing gloves.... And the devs aren't in on it?  There's just so much ""mehhh my tastes are beyond this sips wine "" vibes coming from all these previews that it really is a head scratcher.  It REALLY reminds me of when Akiba's Trip started making it's ways through previews and everyone had to moral panic circle jerk over how ""problematic"" the game was because it involved stripping.  Or when Killer Is Dead started making its rounds.  Anyone around during those games knows exactly what I'm talking about.  I'm not saying this game is any good, it has problems much like Akiba and KiD, but both of those games got slammed HARD in the preview process, well beyond what they deserved, because it offended people.   There is reason critic reviews of Akiba's Trip and KiD and Way of the Samurai and other niche japanese titles were all 2/10s, and it wasn't entirely because of how fun the game was, hence why user reviews for those game are all glowing, praising how downright fun they are.  I'm expecting the same for this actually."

All I can do now is kick the dirt, hope for the best, and wish my Wii U wasn't having such a crappy summer year.  I've always thought of this title as something that looks completely over-the-top stupid, but in a good way. Like a cheesy action movie. I love that. That's certainly not the kind of experience that everyone can appreciate, but if the gameplay ends up being bad? I can't really defend that.  And what a shame, too. I've been excited for this title for over a year.  People are saying the multiplayer could still be good, and I'll grant you it looks cool... but that kind of game--well-made or not--isn't really my style."

wiiu,3dd9bt,BournGamer,18,Wed Jul 15 10:52:32 2015 UTC,How anyone thought this game looked good is beyond me
wiiu,3dd9bt,Butter_Is_Life,9,Wed Jul 15 12:26:00 2015 UTC,"As in the VideoGamer preview,   The core idea - mixing the hack 'n' slash mechanics of Ninja Gaiden with the FPS action of Call of Duty, is admirable - but that's really the only praise the campaign deserves.    When people heard Itagaki was making a new game, and seeking to make a high-action, Ninja Gaiden x FPS kind of game, it got people interested. The rough gameplay was explained as ""Well, let's see how the final product looks.""  And...welp. Now we know. Nintendo dropping support is starting to make more and more sense. Usually Nintendo-focused sites are the first to try and find the positives, but when even those sites are just having a lot of negative things to say....well...yeah. This is bad. Horrible on a Sonic Boom level, of course not, but likely to be medicore/fun at best, and really bad at worst."
wiiu,3dd9bt,hyperlancer,6,Wed Jul 15 13:14:04 2015 UTC,I think IGN had an exclusive preview during E3 last year and it looked awful. The entire interview/preview was super awkward due to a mix of Itagaki's weird personality and IGN unable to muster up any sort of enthusiasm for what they were watching.
wiiu,3dd9bt,scurvebeard,4,Wed Jul 15 14:40:05 2015 UTC,"The graphics, no. The aesthetic was what intrigued me. The atmosphere, the corny action movie feel. The gameplay certainly looked to have some good variety, but it's always hard to tell a good melee combat game from trailers. (Is it quicktime events or am I in control?) It appeared to be a pretty interesting game, even if it didn't have the best appearances.  The graphics have always been rough--not that it much matters to me--but I had hoped they'd improve closer to release.  Alas."

Wii Shop Channel account: This one is used by the virtual Wii Mode. It is tied to the console and can only be transfered if you have both consoles at the same time.

wiiu,3djjl8,livewire2k14,5,Thu Jul 16 23:21:58 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between sadness and depression. Sadness is what you are explaining, where you cry at any mention of him and such. I can see people being sad about this.  Depression, however, is an illness that can leave the person that has it unresponsive to the people around them and most of the time, become incapable of really showing their emotions, even if they said they are sad.   If you find people are telling you to get help or why people are angry that you are using the term ""depression"" instead of perhaps, ""overwhelming sadness."" This is why, because you are making light of a serious condition. Depression is real, but its not your level of sadness and in a way, it can be taken as an insult to the people that truly do suffer from depression. I for one am offended because I know people with legit depression and are often sucidal and see no self worth in them that they purposely push people away. Once again, yours is just sadness to the point you are capable of crying and physically show your emotion. That is a sentiment I can understand, but please, do not make it like you are suffering from ""Depression"" because no, you are just really sad."
wiiu,3djjl8,MicrosoftWord2010,0,Thu Jul 16 23:01:19 2015 UTC,"...actually, depression is a perfectly reasonable word to use to describe feelings of a certain nature, specifically severe despondency or dejection. What you're describing is clinical depression, a medical issue. The reason people are suggesting OP get help is because feeling that level of depression, despondency, sadness, etc about someone who your only interactions with have been through videos of and games made by might suggest greater issues below the surface which require assistance to move past."
wiiu,3djjl8,livewire2k14,3,Thu Jul 16 23:09:11 2015 UTC,"You are probably right about the level of depression, but I still feel like the OP is using the term too loosely. Its like when someone says they have OCD because one thing bother thems, but people with OCD tend to be bother about many things and they can't help themselves. That makes them anal compulsive. Now with this depression, and how I perceive Depression, is described as the feeling of impending doom. So unless the OP has loss all will to live, which is like, no, you are sad a video game creator is gone, but it doesn't mean that you are literally incapable of doing anything in life. It feels harder to do things you use to enjoy, you feel hopeless and worthless, and chances are, it doesn't affect his sleep or work habit or appetite. So yes, I do believe this is another case of throwing the word around way to loosely and people will take it the wrong way. This is stuff that needs to be treated with medication, where its only been a few day since Iwata passed away. Time will help them get over it. But I'm sorry, based on his response to people, I still do not believe they have ""depression"" but are just naturally sad which is perfectly fine. If the OP happens to feel hopeless and worthless, and this sadness is affecting them from doing anything with their life or enjoying it, then yes, they have depression. But the thing is like, everyone is sad, and depression would be more like you play a game that he made and you can't enjoy it, which I don't believe is the case. If the OP has been playing his game, and while yes, sad, but still find joy in the games, then once again, its sadness over his passing, not depression. Depression would basically leave the user unable to cope with negative emotions and despondency. Once again, I don't believe the OP has reached that level of depression yet, and that's why I find this uncomfortable. I've seen Depression ruin a marriage and push their friends and family away from them. The people that suffer this are not the same people they use to be and they truly end up feeling worthless and lose the will to live. This is not that case here."
wiiu,3djjl8,MicrosoftWord2010,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:38:49 2015 UTC,"I just can't really address everything you've said, because it's hilariously close to what most depressed people face; 'I don't think you're really depressed because this is what depression means to me.' You aren't anyone capable of making that diagnosis, you haven't spoken at length to the individual to assess the situation, and yet you feel you not only have the right, but the responsibility to discard their feelings and replace them with your own. I would honestly hate to be around you if I was depressed for fear you would tell me I was just making it up."
wiiu,3djjl8,livewire2k14,2,Fri Jul 17 00:16:59 2015 UTC,"No, if you were sad, then that is just that, you are sad. If you didn't feel like you are worth anything and you feel like there is nothing worth living for, then I would help you deal with depression. Based on your logic, everyone is ""depressed"" but sadness is but a symptom of depression. If you look up ""depression"" without the terms of ""clinical"" you will see that depression is much more severe. Crying when you see something that reminds you of something isn't depression. It's just being sad and that is okay. In this case, the OP, whether intentional or not is playing victim of a more serious case and I do not like this, because if everyone used depression loosely, then everyone starts believing this is the correct way to use it, underminding just how serious it really is. It's not a matter of me being right. Its a matter of spreading false information so people end up using it wrong. Yes, people are sad, but it does not mean they are suffering from depression. The key word here is they are implying they are ""suffering from depression."" This is not suffering. This is crying to be able to deal with your sadness of loss. So no, I'm going to tell them that people have it worse and don't make light of them. I understand if they don't get it yet, because you really need to know someone with depression to understand how deep it is and even then, I wouldn't want anyone in life that has to deal with it or has to deal with someone that has it. But it's there, and just be grateful you are aren't really ""suffering"" because it's a real disease. Forgive me if you are sad and I tell you, not that you are making it up, I'd tell you there are people that are worse off than you, and if I was indeed, your friend, I'd tried to cheer you up. Sorry if you think I am careless, but my consideration is for people that are really suffering depression. I'm sorry, I'm not on reddit to tell people that they are right and agree with them when they are wrong. If you look at any cry for help online for depression, the OP's, I cry when I think about him, JUST A FEW DAYS AFTER HIS DEATH, is nothing compared to those. What they are experiencing is normal and there is nothing wrong with that. They will eventually get over it. If not and they lose the will to live, then yes, they should get real help.   Seriously, if they are truly ""suffering from depression,"" it would not be a 2 sentence line. This is a travesty to people that deal with depression."

My mother passed away almost 2 months ago and it's changed the way I think when it comes to things of this nature. I always thought that a loss of that magnitude would (in theory) numb me to subsequent deaths seeing as losing my mother is very likely the most painful loss I'd ever experience, but I was wrong.   The passing of Satoru Iwata hit me harder than any celebrity death I can recall and I can't quite put my finger on it. Truth be told, I've been secretly hoping for a change in leadership since the Wii U had all but flopped, but never would I have wanted it to happen like this. Nobody should go out at such a young age, it's a terrible thing to even think about. The man seemed genuine, very good at his craft and seeing the outpour of emotion from fans and colleagues alike, he must've been. You have to (please) understand, I haven't been this saddened over the death of a media figure since George Carlin and that guy is my favorite stand-up comedian of all time. I think I may even be taking it harder than Carlin. I can't honestly even tell you very much about Iwata, other than his job title and (because of this sub over the last few days) that he programmed Balloon Fight, Earthbound, Kirby and Pokemon Gold/Silver. Those games are great, but I don't immediately associate them with the man.  Anyway, I'm rambling so I'll stop there. R.I.P. Iwata, I'm sure you've brought me more joy than we both will ever know."

I will never have the chance to thank Iwata now. And that makes me sad not depressed."

wiiu,3dd474,gnukan,4,Wed Jul 15 11:36:53 2015 UTC,"Saltspray Rig in Ranked battle quickly dashed any affinity I had for it from the beta and Turf War, it's positively obnoxious on Splat Zones."
wiiu,3dd474,Butter_Is_Life,2,Wed Jul 15 14:14:14 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, I've never played Ranked. Maybe I shouldn't start when Saltspray Rig is on then"
wiiu,3dd474,gnukan,5,Wed Jul 15 14:30:59 2015 UTC,"I adore Ranked, even though I get absolutely salty on it. I wouldn't avoid it entirely.... Just know that Saltspray is a lot harder to take the zone back with, mainly because that back area to the north of the zone is so crucial that once you have it, you kinda domineer the area. Saltspray and Urchin Underpass are my votes for hardest Splat Zones maps, mainly for how particular they are."
wiiu,3dd474,Butter_Is_Life,2,Wed Jul 15 14:43:09 2015 UTC,"I think it's a poor map on Turf Wars as well. The whole strategy boils down to ""rush the middle and stay there"".  If you control the center area and the northern rectangle, you have won the match. Even if the enemy has all of the southern rectangle and the pathways, it cannot match the amount of coverage of center+northern rectangle. This makes the map very monotonous."
wiiu,3dd474,Yhdiste,3,Wed Jul 15 15:54:46 2015 UTC,"It's definitely predictable, but at least you're using the entire map in Turf Wars (even if it does come down to those two squares), compared to just using a tiny portion of it in Ranked. The lower quadrant and scaffolding paths just don't matter at all, compared to say, Blackbelly Skatepark where covering beyond your zones actually helps."
wiiu,3dd474,Butter_Is_Life,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:07:08 2015 UTC,"In theory, yes. However, in practise it is almost identical to ranked. You just paint a bit larger area.  You rush the middle, paint the northern rectangle and then move back down to defend the same bottleneck as in ranked (which is the splat zone location). Only if your team strays away or gets splatted, you need to worry about painting both rectangles again."
wiiu,3dd474,Yhdiste,19,Thu Jul 16 13:08:57 2015 UTC,"After some internal deliberation, I've decided that my favourite map is Blackbelly Skatepark. It's open, has key chokepoints to fight over, but also the potential to flank nicely. You can use any weapon on the map and feel like you're contributing to the game, rather than feel forced into a specific type of weapon."
wiiu,3dd474,vedderer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:52:47 2015 UTC,Mine too!
wiiu,3dd474,thezars,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:43:30 2015 UTC,"I like the warehouse for similar reasons.  You can have success with a variety of weapons, it's easy to find action even in unranked, and the choke points make for good melee.  The big difference for me is that I enjoy the  warehouse splatzone a little more than the skate park.  it's definitely not as open as the skatepark, though."
wiiu,3dd474,Butter_Is_Life,2,Wed Jul 15 13:10:35 2015 UTC,"Walleye Warehouse is my absolute favorite. It's the most friendly across weapon types and gametypes. It's a blast in Splat Zones, Turf War, or Tower Control. Chargers, rollers, blasters, and regular splattershots all have a fair chance to have a fun time.  I like Skatepark, but it's an absolute pain for a roller to navigate. Really fun and open, the center tower is a fun point to control, and it's also really fun across all modes. Easily my second favorite map."
wiiu,3dd474,Neversoft,9,Wed Jul 15 14:16:41 2015 UTC,Probably not the popular choice but I really like Arowana Mall.
wiiu,3dd474,KierkegaardExpress,2,Wed Jul 15 11:01:41 2015 UTC,I think it's my favorite too: it's a nice tight area with fairly constant conflict.   I think it's the best tower control map

wiiu,3d9wvj,fearofthesky,3,Wed Jul 15 04:11:08 2015 UTC,Ah. I was wondering why none of my Pokémon amiibo give related Yoshi's in Wooly World. Instead you just get a regualr green yoshi with an amiibo logo.
wiiu,3d9wvj,kapnkruncher,2,Wed Jul 15 07:13:44 2015 UTC,The sheer amount of small things Amiibos do for so many games is pretty cool. This sounds like a perfect fit.
wiiu,3d9wvj,joshh148,45,Thu Jul 16 13:27:25 2015 UTC,Online play actually makes this a little better.
wiiu,3d9wvj,drunkentuckian,9,Tue Jul 14 17:56:20 2015 UTC,Was that announced at E3? I feel like that could have toned down some of the backlash?
wiiu,3d9wvj,Felixrak,24,Tue Jul 14 19:19:10 2015 UTC,"People have wanted online play for Mario Party for a long time, now we get it in this game, funny isnt it?"
wiiu,3d9wvj,OccupyGravelpit,33,Tue Jul 14 17:59:22 2015 UTC,Probably because it won't be a twitch/mash the button affair like Mario Party typically is.  Split second stuff between 4 players doesn't tend to work that well over the internet.
wiiu,3d9wvj,Johnny_Gossamer,8,Tue Jul 14 18:49:32 2015 UTC,Split second stuff would actually work really well if it was independent of each other. Just sync up at the results
wiiu,3d9wvj,dios_Achilleus,6,Wed Jul 15 00:59:49 2015 UTC,"I think the issue he's referring to is where the games are interactive and not just competitive. If you only synced results, you would necessarily only be able to have non-interactive mini-games, possibly to the exclusion of 3v1 and 2v2 games. (I cannot think of a 2v2 MP mini-game that would work asynchronously.)"
wiiu,3d9wvj,Anon_Amous,2,Wed Jul 15 06:00:25 2015 UTC,I definitely wanted it with mini-games though... It remains to be seen if AC: AF will have these at all.

wiiu,3d9wvj,DrunkRobot97,5,Tue Jul 14 19:34:58 2015 UTC,"I guess it would be equal to the cost of the figures and cards sold separately, as the game itself is also a free download."
wiiu,3d9wvj,infinitelives,3,Tue Jul 14 22:00:43 2015 UTC,"Amiibo are $13 each, so that's $26, and cards are pretty cheap.  Could be as low as $30, maybe $40 if the game comes on disc in this form."

wiiu,3d9wvj,pistachiopaul,2,Wed Jul 15 07:32:31 2015 UTC,"From the E3 trailer, it's Mario Party without the minigames. You roll dice to move around a bored, and when you land on a space, a little text-based cutscene pops up and tells you what happened to your character (like you won a contest or something), and you gain or lose ""Happiness"" points. Apparently there will also be other modes that contain different minigames."

wiiu,3d9wvj,irishsandman,11,Tue Jul 14 22:36:26 2015 UTC,Animal Crossing is older though.
wiiu,3d9wvj,CheezNips,-12,Tue Jul 14 23:11:20 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter, though. People never referred to Animal Crossing as ""AC"" on a regular basis, and they do with Assassin's Creed. Besides, Assassin's Creed is much, much more mainstream."

Also, I was talking about a blind question, ""Hey what game do you think of when you hear 'AC?'"" Without multiple choice to follow.  Still, after all that, one of the top comments is . . . Assassin's Creed.   I don't know how anyone could rationally expect another answer to the question. Animal Crossing, as a franchise has only sold 23 million copies, Assassin's Creed has sold 73 million. Way more people are going to think of Assassin's Creed. I'm not saying it has anything to do with quality, just notoriety."
wiiu,3d9wvj,irishsandman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:13:56 2015 UTC,"lmfao. So by ""post it in any gaming forum"" you actually meant ""only in ones that I think won't prove me wrong""?"

wiiu,3d9wvj,irishsandman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:35:31 2015 UTC,You realize the Assassin's Creed games have sold ~ 75 million over the course of 8 games + spin offs while Animal Crossing has sold ~ 30 million over 4 games right?
wiiu,3d9wvj,boopaboopa,-1,Thu Jul 16 01:19:00 2015 UTC,It's 73 for AC and 23 for Animal Crossing according to Wikipedia.  I don't think having fewer releases helps anyone trying to argue that Animal Crossing is the AC of gaming. AC had more releases over a shorter period of time selling more than 3x as many copies.  How on earth anyone can think that translates to greater penetration is beyond me. Oh wait it's a bunch of Nintendo fans in a Nintendo forum thinking I'm saying Assassin's Creed is better or something. Because that's totally my point. /s
wiiu,3d9wvj,irishsandman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:42:59 2015 UTC,"Check VGchartz, more accurate after the fact than wikipedia. They say worldwide Animal Crossing is at 27.7. I just rounded up for both for ease.   I don't think having fewer releases helps anyone trying to argue that Animal Crossing is the AC of gaming.   I'm not saying that. I'm just saying Assassin's Creed isn't ""much much"" more mainstream than Animal Crossing. If Animal Crossing had the same momentum with each game as it does now, at 8 games it could very nearly match the sales of 8 Assassin's Creed games and spin offs.  I think you missed my point."
wiiu,3d9wvj,boopaboopa,0,Thu Jul 16 12:17:15 2015 UTC,"Sure, someday Animal Crossing could sell as many copies as Assassin's Creed. But we're pretty far off from that now.   I can't fathom how anyone thinks this is a debate besides out of pure fanatiscm. You're using words like ""if"" and ""could"" to describe Animal Crossing's possible future success. AC doesn't need to do that.  If I walk into a gaming store and ask to see some ""AC"" games they won't direct me to Animal Crossing. If you want to believe they would, then In done arguing about that delusion.  Edit: OK, nail in the coffin time. I just Googled "" AC game"" and there first hit was the Assassin's Creed wiki. The second was Asheron's Call."
wiiu,3d9wvj,Kigurumix,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:27:15 2015 UTC,"But we're pretty far off from that now.    You are completely missing my point.  Look, Animal Crossing has nearly sold half the amount of units with nearly half the amount of games as the Assassin's Creed series. That indicates a return that shows Animal Crossing is pretty much as known/popular/trending as Assassin's Creed. Not quite sure what you're confused about. I'm not even talking about what ""AC"" is known as. I'm just arguing the notion you put forward that Assassin's Creed is ""much, much"" more mainstream than Animal Crossing.  It's like you're intentionally misreading me."

When I heard about a roguelike with Zelda 1 style dungeoneering I was pretty excited but as soon as I found out it was a twinstick shooter I didn't care anymore.  Rogue Legacy on the other hand I loved because I'm a big fan of Castlevania style games.

wiiu,3d9yky,TSPhoenix,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:56:33 2015 UTC,"Personally, I can't get into rogue legacy because it focuses on leveling, rather than skill. A beginner picking up Isaac for the first time could easily kill Mom, while a beginner would be lucky to kill even Khidr on their first run on rogue legacy. Plus, I think finding treasure on rogue legacy feels lame because nine times out of ten you don't get any immediate rewards; instead you get the option to buy a stat bonus next time you die."
wiiu,3d9yky,ThroughLidlessEye,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:00:18 2015 UTC,"Oh Rogue Legacy certainly has problems and RPG-style games certainly have a tendency towards having balance issues.   a beginner would be lucky to kill even Khidr on their first run on rogue legacy.    This in my mind is what makes the level up system a good thing, it give weaker players a buffer to learn whilst someone who is more skilled can easily kill Khidir on their first life.  The difficulty somewhat self-balanced because the better you are, the quicker you progress, the less you die, the less OP you become. I like hard games, but I also understand that for people less skilled that simply being curb-stomped repeatedly is not conducive to learning.  The idea is when you level up you can progress more quickly rather than die to a boss instantly then having to spend 10 minutes to find them again.  I get the argument that bad players being able to brute force their way through the game purely by investing time is not a good design, but I think that comes down more to how someone chooses to play the game over any flaw in the game itself.  It is the same with IGA Castlevania games, my first time through I'll just level up and progress casually. But for a subsequent run I might use one of the level capped modes so I can focus on my own player skill.  At worst these designs allow players to get lazy, but again if people choose to play the game that is their owe prerogative."

wiiu,3d9yky,neophytegod,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:19:09 2015 UTC,I'm hoping there will be some special edition boxed copies for the 3DS but I also really doubt it. The lack of cross-buy is VERY disappointing though. I already own Rebirth on Steam... Think I'll just get it for 3DS as a result.
wiiu,3d9yky,mercilessmerc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:57:02 2015 UTC,"To all, it's an absolutely fantastic game. It takes some getting used to and it takes a lot of learning how everything works. If you get the game and find it's kicking you around, definitely try a basic tutorial or guide online, because the game doesn't really explain how much works.   There is a lot of trial and error and observation. Hundreds of items that you unlock over time, each with a brief phrase describing them, sometimes cryptic. A slew of different characters who all work a little differently with only minor descriptions of their individual quirks. No real explanation of how special rooms and objects work. Initially I wasn't really sold on the game (it was free for PS+ members so I was willing to just stop playing) but my roommate had some experience with the original and explained how some stuff worked to me. It was a lot more fun after I had that initial push with the basics and I was able to learn more on my own.  I'm still playing this game, guys. Like when I finished Arkham Knight I picked it right back up. I may even double-dip on one of the Nintendo versions because the dual-screen presentation looks nice. Maybe I'll lean towards the 3DS since I can already play the PS4 version on the TV and I don't play the Vita version much.  Also, lastly, I find the term twin-stick shooter a little misleading. Technically I guess it is, but it's a little different. You can play with the sticks, but you can also play with the d-pad and buttons. Or a cross-combo. Isaac shoots in four directions (with the exception of items that can change that), so it doesn't feel like your typical twin-stick shooter either. Because of these rigid angles I definitely prefer using the buttons to shoot and I use the d-pad for movement just to be evened out on the controller."
wiiu,3d9yky,kapnkruncher,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:47:30 2015 UTC,Lack of any type of cross buy is bullshit. I'm going to buy it on my 3DS but I'm a bit salty that I won't even get a discount on the Wii U version if I chose to pick that up when Vita/PS4 users got the whole game for free with one buy.
wiiu,3d9yky,KrisKomet,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:58:23 2015 UTC,It's not cross-buy on Vita/PS4 either. Some PlayStation Plus members actually missed out on one version because of this.

Many of the puzzles in the the iOS and PC versions are totally different to take advantage of the strengths of each platform (and avoid their weaknesses).   I'd expect that we'll get a port that is really tailored to the Wii U, rather than a straight port of either the iOS or PC versions. It'll probably contain some puzzles/content that is totally unique compared with the other versions.  I've been wanting to play this for several months. I'm glad it's coming to a platform I own!"

SMG2 takes place the exact ""same day"" in the new universe, which is why its plot is the same as SMG1- it's the day of the festival that happens once every hundred years or so- but things end up slightly different.  SMG is fucking weird. Rosalina is a space goddess. SMG canonically ends with the world being recreated. It's so weird. Mario in SMG2 is not the same mario as in SMG1, and by extension all marios in everything featuring Rosalina are not the same Marios as everything else.

Even if his body was rebuilt, it wouldn't make him a different person. The heart, mind, and soul is what defines a person.

wiiu,3d5o9z,azerd3243,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:35:14 2015 UTC,"That's not a very good point since Mario doesn't have any dialogue to begin with. He doesn't speak to Rosalina at all over the course of the game, as he is a silent protagonist, aside from his ""YAHOO!"" and ""YIPEE!"" clips and the odd ""THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PLAYING MY GAME!"" and ""WELCOME, NEW GALAXY!"".  Nothing happened to any of the characters from what we saw, Rosalina just rebuilt the cosmos into a more unified form."
wiiu,3d5o9z,kupovi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:52:03 2015 UTC,"A point to prove he was indeed rebuilt? Of course, I didn't say why I disagreed. I just said what was certain was that Rosalina didn't change. We saw Mario Peach and Bowser('s dead body if he sunk in lava and we consider it killed him) get sucked up in a black hole, and in the newborn galaxy, we see all three of them (alive AND well) wake up. We don't see them land, mind you, so when did they fall asleep?   Plus, according to my point of Rosalina being the part that doesn't undergo transformation, it doesn't even matter if the Mario in Galaxy2 is from the newborn galaxy or one that came afterwards since she would be the one with the ability to recognize Mario, and that's all you'd need to justify the line ""we meet again"". However, since the Mario that wakes up in the newborn galaxy knows that there is a galaxy to welcome, we can indeed say he kept some memories from before he woke up in the new galaxy."
wiiu,3d5o9z,BrightVirtuousCynic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:09:26 2015 UTC,"Peach and Rosalina actually have a conversation in Galaxy 2's ending and the way they speak to each other pretty clearly shows it's the same Peach.  Why would it be any different with Mario? Your theory just seems like it's trying to over complicate the ending, but the very clear, simple explanation was that Rosalina recreated the universe, but the characters remained the same. They didn't change or get rebuilt. That wasn't shown, implied, or mentioned."
wiiu,3d5o9z,topplehat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:15:30 2015 UTC,"Alright, I didn't remember that. So they have the same memories then. I'll still say their body were recreated though. They didn't change, or at least not on any important level, but I'll still keep my vision of them being part of the newborn galaxy rather than taken away by Rosalina to be put back on it. I mean, I'm still convinced the ending was made vague on purpose so that you could see it either way or whatever. As if it was meant to be complicated, y'know? For me, my idea seems more suggested than yours but whatever, your idea still works so have it your way.  ---Alright, I looked up the ending of Galaxy2 because I really didn't remember it, and the moment I think you're referring to actually seems to be Rosalina talking off screen whilst the camera is on Peach: her lips aren't moving even though those of Rosalina do when we see them as she's talking (OK, when Peach said ""it's beatiful"" you couldn't really discern lip movement either, but the ""we"" within those two line of dialogue where we see Peach seems to point towards Rosalina a tad more than Peach). Plus, Rosalina introduces herself at the beginning of her little speech. And that would indicate that Peach, and possibly Mario, shouldn't know Rosalina."
wiiu,3d5o9z,FinalMantasyX,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:54:50 2015 UTC,"The ending wasn't vague though. You are just adding an element to it that, once again, wasn't shown, mentioned, or implied. You're making stuff up, not interpreting what's there.  As for that second paragraph, Peach is speaking while the camera is on her. Her lip movement is pretty clear, I don't know how you missed it. Furthermore, she makes a little grunt when she starts speaking (which you can't POSSIBLY mix-up for Rosalina's voice because Rosalina has a perpetual echo to her voice).  Rosalina introduces herself for the sake of the player, since not everyone who plays Galaxy 2 has played the first game. In universe, it could just be interpreted as formal politeness. However, the line only exists because people who didn't play the first game won't have a clue who she is."

Galaxy 2 just felt like a Super Mario World 3D game in a way, but with gravity platforming. The music was more playful and funky, the worlds were more colorful, and honestly, it was more like a ""video game"" than the first game. I agree that bosses were better, there felt like there was less shoehorned Comet missions, the only thing I don't like gameplaywise in Galaxy 2 are those stupid Green Star missions. I enjoyed Galaxy 2 as a whole more than 1, but Galaxy 1 ""stuck to it's guns"" as far as the whole Mario in space concept, and still gives it a unique charm."

You may say, why should someone grieve a person they didn't know? I'm not sure everyone is grieving but we can feel the loss of someone we knew was good for this world.   I was quite sad, not depressed or unable to operate, when Steve Jobs died. My job, as I know it today, wouldn't exist if not for the Mac, iPhone and iPad. It took me by surprise and it helped me a great deal to just see people happy for what he provided the world. I think he left the world in a better place as the result of his passion.   I think Iwata left his mark as well. He helped give people experiences and memories and smiles. Maybe those games even saved someone's life because they helped when someone needed it.   So, everyone grieves differently and I'd encourage you to not be a downer about that. If it bothers you give it a few days and you'll see a lot less of it. Just be conscious of how others might feel. It's not our job to say whether or not what people need to do to help themselves due to the loss of someone is creepy, no matter how distant they are from the person.   Aim to leave the world in a better place and leave people to feel for the loss of losing you. I think that's what we should all try to achieve with our lives."

These games carry his legacy, and his ideals. So it is good to highlight certain materials in the games he produced that highlight his greatness, or help people cope better. For most people, the two links we have to Iwata are his games and the Nintendo Directs, so naturally, we will reference those a lot in his honour.  In this specific case, Rosalina's consistent mention of ""stars"" made me think of Iwata, because he really is a star of sorts.

wiiu,3d9ab1,Deddiekoel,15,Tue Jul 14 14:35:04 2015 UTC,"You should probably proofread a bit harder. Like, a lot harder. I don't want to belittle your work, I absolutely love reading reviews, but I want to offer some constructive criticism.  For starters, errors I caught on a single read-through as I was reading:   That eats it’s its enemies...  ...in it’s its latest game...  not no,these Amiibo are made of yarn to match the games’  game's graphical style.  It doesn’t end at with graphics alone... (pick one: at or with)  The (something) is ubiquitous and it works.  Yoshi’s Woolly World cute façade... (something should be possessive, or just ""the cute facade"")  Unlike it’s  its cute appearance...  Behind it’s its fuzzy exterior...   (Possessive ""it"" is ""its"", not ""it's"". ""It's"" is always ""it is"")  Outside of that, it was a really choppy read. You definitely broke too many things into too many sentences. The first paragraph is a good example because it's pretty bad about it. Otherwise, some punctuation was missing in sentences as well.  Finally, as a personal peeve, ""the level design is good"" is one of the worst things people say in a review. Why is the level design good? What MAKES it good? Do you have examples of good level design? Are there points where the level design isn't as good, or is it always good?  I did like the review, though, and I'm not trying to rip apart the overall good work you did. I get the feeling that, at the very least, English may not be your primary language and I do not want you to think that you are awful at this simply because of a few grammar errors."
wiiu,3d9ab1,lodum,6,Tue Jul 14 16:59:44 2015 UTC,"To add on to myself, I want to look at the actual review past the grammar errors. You don't exactly do much real reviewing. Breaking it down paragraph by paragraph we get:   Nintendo designed Yoshi and Yoshi's awesome. It's cute. No, really, it's cute. It's cute but it's still hard. Trying to collect everything makes it harder. It plays like older Yoshi games. There are multiple control schemes. It's cute but it's still hard. You have options to make it less hard. Gameplay is more relaxed than other Nintendo platformers. It has good level design. Poochy is in it and you can get a second Yoshi using an Amiibo. There is a two-player mode. You can change how your Yoshi looks. In conculsion, YWW is cute but still hard.   This is a problem I have when reviewing things, too. I spend too much time on how the game works and not nearly enough time on anything subjective about it. I know objectivity is sort of a goal for a review, as in you don't want to come across horribly biased, but there's a balance you have to hit.  Subjectively:   You like the aesthetic. This is easy to see as you plainly say you enjoy it and you keep coming back to it. You think the game has good level design. You say this at least twice, but don't really explain why it has good level design. You thought the controls would be too complicated for kids, but were proven wrong. This is valid, Yoshi's Island (and similar games) have more complicated controls than Mario, etc. That being said, Yoshi's Island for SNES had basically the same control scheme and kids understood it just fine :) The game is more relaxed than other Nintendo platformers and here's a few reasons why... I really liked this part and it was probably the strongest part of your review. Coincidentally, YWW can probably get away with its more complicated controls because of this fact.   On the fence of subjectivity, we have that ""it's cute, but still hard if you want to collect everything"". You mostly just mention that it's hard to collect everything, which is certainly subjective, but don't really opine on whether or not it's a good thing or whether or not it's hard enough.  I think you have the basics of a good review in there, but spend too much time on very basic aspects of the game. Try to explain it more quickly and get into the details of what you like about it faster. We don't necessarily need the different control schemes explained to us, but its not a bad thing to mention that it HAS options.  In my opinion, a platformer pretty much boils down to:   Aesthetic Controls Level Design Difficulty   With difficulty being largely influenced by the controls and level design.  If you hit the basics quickly, and covered those aspects more, I think you'd have a much better review. That being said, I'm just a random internet commenter and I fully understand if you don't want to listen to me. Clearly, you have several reviews under your belt and whatever you're doing seems to be working."
wiiu,3d9ab1,lodum,6,Tue Jul 14 17:48:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Both of you, for your extensive feedback. Highly appreciated. First off, english isn't my first language so I have that at least to hide behind (it's also the reason I can review the game). But regardless I should have proofread this more carefully. ""It's"" and ""its"" somehow aren't my strong suit. I'd like to blame auto-correct but in all honesty that's probably not it. The first paragraph was something I struggled with. The way it is now is more how I would say it and that doesn't always work written down. Initially I had one big sentence and I was always told to avoid that at all cost. I'll have another swing at it. As mentioned I try to be objective and explain the game instead of giving my biased opinion. It's a fine line and I think I should move away from the ""explain the game"" a bit more. I'll definitely do something with the remarks regarding where I need to go into detail. The control options probably weren't the best place but it was something that stuck for me personally.  I will also definitely go back and explain more about the level design. Saying it's good and then leaving it at just doesn't cut it.    So thanks for the feedback, it's good to get other points of view, especially from native speakers.  Edit: I've updated the review to give level-design examples and try and fix the first paragraph."

wiiu,3d8skj,trillyntruly,11,Tue Jul 14 11:53:28 2015 UTC,"If Atlus USA is in charge of the localization, then I'm guessing we won't get a Japanese audio option, at least based on the work they've done so far with SMT, Persona, etc.  Atlus' English dubs tend to be really good though. That said, SMTxFE's heavy focus on music could easily become a localization disaster, so I hope they include the Japanese audio anyway.  If NoA is doing the localization, then there's probably a better chance of getting a Japanese audio option, given that we had that in recent games like Xenoblade Chronicles (Wii version) and Fire Emblem: Awakening."
wiiu,3d8skj,hhkk47,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:06:47 2015 UTC,When you say based on SMT/Persona are you referring to releases on Playstation platforms or on Nintendo platforms?

wiiu,3d8skj,hhkk47,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:11:45 2015 UTC,On the Playstation platforms wasn't this done to stop Japanese gamers importing the cheaper version?  Since Xenoblade on Wii had Japanese VO and Xenoblade 3D did not one could argue that Atlus might have excluded it from the 3DS game for similar reasons.  I guess what I'm saying is that it might not be entirely unlikely to get Japanese VO.
wiiu,3d8skj,TSPhoenix,2,Tue Jul 14 17:22:50 2015 UTC,"The 3DS is region-locked, shouldn't be a concern. Leaving the voices out in any of these cases could have been an issue of storage space, however."
wiiu,3d8skj,Shardwing,3,Tue Jul 14 19:03:09 2015 UTC,"That is my point, neither of the potential reasons for leaving Japanese VO out of those versions should apply to a Wii U version which is region locked and uses high capacity discs."

wiiu,3d8skj,YuriusFarrence,2,Tue Jul 14 15:53:47 2015 UTC,I'm going to assume the voice acting will be translated and localized while the music will remain Japanese. That'd make the most sense.
wiiu,3d8skj,CaptainL95,3,Tue Jul 14 23:15:28 2015 UTC,I'm hoping for Japanese audio as well. In games I usually take dubs but the music component is so strong I'd rather listen to the original stuff.

An analogy would be that python has you giving instructions like ""Walk to the store""  Whereas a lower level system is giving instructions describing every detail of taking each step.  Something in your brain converts the high level ""go to store"" instruction to the low level instructions for taking steps.

Even assembly languages are abstracted away from pure machine code, since humans would be terribly slow at writing and understanding that."
wiiu,3d2f3z,Kenny__Loggins,3,Mon Jul 13 15:09:55 2015 UTC,"So once the code makes its way to the processor, it is 1's and 0's turning circuits off and on, correct?"
wiiu,3d2f3z,hsxp,2,Mon Jul 13 15:17:09 2015 UTC,Yup
wiiu,3d2f3z,posam,20,Mon Jul 13 16:03:40 2015 UTC,Other coding languages are essentially a shorthand version of assembly. Assembly is the base language.
wiiu,3d2f3z,KipEnyan,11,Mon Jul 13 03:05:06 2015 UTC,"Assembly is not a language, it's a class of language. Machine code would be the base language. What language your assembler uses depends entirely on the CPU you're on and the instruction set it handles."
wiiu,3d2f3z,KeyVapours,3,Mon Jul 13 05:17:36 2015 UTC,"To go into more detail, in programming today, you'll generally use a high level language that is pretty far removed from assembly. Say you're coding in C, you'll compile that into ASM which is then translated into machine code by your CPU  There are also other systems like Just in Time compliation or running a virtual machine inside the computer as another level between programmer and the CPU. Plus you've got interpreted languages which work in many different ways  tl;dr: programming, its complicated"
wiiu,3d2f3z,KipEnyan,3,Mon Jul 13 10:13:33 2015 UTC,"Specifically, your C code will most likely be compiled into x86-64 by your compiler, where it will then be assembled into platform-specific object code by your OS, where it will then be linked to produce executable machine code."
wiiu,3d2f3z,KeyVapours,2,Mon Jul 13 12:33:12 2015 UTC,Honestly we could go about 10 layers deep into this :P
wiiu,3d2f3z,thebuccaneersden,8,Mon Jul 13 12:37:57 2015 UTC,"Assembly is as close to machine language as possible. It's barely a step up really. You are basically speaking directly to the hardware. Higher level languages create abstractions that make coding for humans a lot easier, but requires a compiler to look at it and figure out how to convert it to machine code. If I was to give a half decent analogy, the difference between assembly and higher level languages is like you having to hunt and grow your own food compared to going to a supermarket. Hope that makes sense."
wiiu,3d2f3z,Royness,18,Mon Jul 13 05:04:55 2015 UTC,"It's a low-level programming language -- closer to machine code than most modern programming languages. It's impressive because it's complex.  RIP, Mr. Iwata."
wiiu,3d2f3z,KipEnyan,9,Mon Jul 13 03:11:40 2015 UTC,"It's impressive because it's painfully simple. You have legit like 20 different things you can do total, and you have to figure out how to make an entire friggin videos game out of 20 simple instructions like ""move this number here""."
wiiu,3d2f3z,Royness,7,Mon Jul 13 05:19:01 2015 UTC,"Exactly -- while the language itself might be ""simple"", it can be complex for a human to use it to construct entire video games. Tomatoes, tomahtoes."
wiiu,3d2f3z,csolisr,2,Mon Jul 13 05:36:34 2015 UTC,"As a CS student that took a course on assembly, I can definitely admire his efforts."
wiiu,3d2f3z,Shiroi_Kage,25,Mon Jul 13 18:03:07 2015 UTC,"Some good work? His scripting language made the game possible. He also overkilled the sh*t out of that by making it so sophisticated that it's theorized you can write an emulator for a console, I forgot its name, using that scripting language."

wiiu,3d2f3z,Shiroi_Kage,2,Mon Jul 13 04:24:48 2015 UTC,"Yes. No one proved it, as it would take a lot of work, but most people agree that it was Turing complete."

wiiu,3d2f3z,CZbwoi,27,Mon Jul 13 05:31:13 2015 UTC,"Damn, if that's true, thank you Iwata. Those games were my childhood, I even bought both back then(Gold & Silver) because I thought there was some huge difference distinguishing the two lol, not just a few exclusive Pokémon and some minor changes. But you get the point.  Anyways, the highlight of my experience with those games was when I got to the ""end"" and it wasn't the end. All of a sudden I got a train ticket or whatever to KANTO and I was like HOLY CRAP WUT, WHERE?? HUH. (I was too young to experience Red and Blue when they came out, these games were my first of the series)  Yeah, so anyways, that was awesome. Thanks Iwata for making those games so much more awesome, it was like 2 games in 1, it literally was. I put a lot of time in those games as a kid(a lot of it due to the Kanto surprise), the songs are still engraved in my brain, awesome memories."

wiiu,3d2f3z,LegoKiva,44,Mon Jul 13 19:51:06 2015 UTC,"Iwata was, quite possibly, the greatest innovator to work at Nintendo. The man was a game designing genius, saving the releases of both Pokemon Gold/Silver and Super Smash Bros Melee, and undoubtedly contributing massively to Nintendo with every fiber of his being. He stood up for his workers, refusing to cut positions, rush deadlines, or unreasonably restructure to please investors.  God speed Iwata. You will be dearly missed."
wiiu,3d2f3z,super_soma,11,Mon Jul 13 03:06:06 2015 UTC,He saved the release of Melee? I'd honestly love to read the story there

wiiu,3d2f3z,NovaGirl5,3,Mon Jul 13 00:44:49 2015 UTC,"Slight exaggeration. Without him, the game still would have existed - just would have released slightly later. He helped them release the game on schedule. Saying he saved the game is a bit disingenuous."
wiiu,3d2f3z,MrSojiro,186,Mon Jul 13 03:32:09 2015 UTC,I can't believe the last thing we heard from him was that he was sorry he let us down at E3 2015 =( I'm really sad now
wiiu,3d2f3z,ChemicalExperiment,52,Mon Jul 13 04:06:03 2015 UTC,"I agree, that is the real gut punch when I think about it. That or as someone on Gaf posted, that the muppets used at E3 were probably because Iwata didn't want people to see how sick and weak the cancer had most likely made him look :(. Even though he is a guy who I actually have never met, he definitely seemed to be very personal with us Nintendo fans via the Nintendo directs, so I can't help but fight back some tears about the news. Speaking of direct, I can't imagine them now without him."
wiiu,3d2f3z,whizzer0,9,Mon Jul 13 11:10:08 2015 UTC,"I just realised that Iwata hasn't even done a Nintendo Direct since April 1st. This really shows how sick he's been, but none of us really noticed. It's crazy to think of how Nintendo will continue without him. Rest in peace, friend."
wiiu,3d2f3z,swordmalice,5,Mon Jul 13 00:55:37 2015 UTC,"Digital Event was kind of a Direct, he may not have appeared in person but we at least had his voice."

wiiu,3d2f3z,Vinylzen,4,Mon Jul 13 11:19:29 2015 UTC,"That's so like him, though. Pure joy and sincerity in everything he was passionate about. Crap I better stop before I start to cry at my desk."
wiiu,3d2f3z,swordmalice,2,Mon Jul 13 15:25:42 2015 UTC,"I actually noticed when I first saw that direct I was like ""wow he looks considerably much thinner"" and my friends agreed when I pointed it out  and then I started to hear rumors circle around that he wasn't in the best health. Go back and watch it and it really shows :/"
wiiu,3d2f3z,Exoma,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:50:59 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Iwata felt approachable, and he showed so much passion for what he did for us, Nintendo and gaming in general. I'm sure I'm not alone when I say that many of us feel like we lost a dear friend today; someone who knew us and wanted nothing less than the best for us. And worked his butt off to make us happy.

My hopes are he'll die a fulfilled man in his 90s, at home in bed with his pets and maybe a freshly pruned garden, smiling. I can only hope Iwata had peace before he passed, I don't know much about the disease he had but I can only hope his passing was peaceful.  I still can't believe it. Playing a few rounds of Balloon Fight on Smash, one of the games he programmed. You'll be missed, Iwata."

If things get really messy there is always the option to reset. The reset button gives us, the gamer, a clean slate and an opportunity at a fresh start. Sadly, in real life, we are not granted the luxury of how kind and forgiving video games can be. We can not escape death; there are no mods or ROM hacks to get us through life.  Today, I cried for a man I have never met nor do I know personally, but he has shaped my life more than anyone will ever understand. He has brought more joy into my childhood, as well as my adult life, than I can even begin to explain. If I'm having a bad day I can retire to a 30 year old console blow dust out of a cartridge and I’m off to stomp on goomba’s heads while riding a green dinosaur that shits multicolored eggs, cause, that's what plumbers do. I can venture off into dungeons with only the protection of leotards and a fairy because some old tree on an acid trip told me that sages were hiding triangles and playing dope beats on an ocarina makes time reverse, cause you know, elf shit, brah. Or, I can spend 250 bells on a new coffee table that’s shaped like a shoe when I know damn well its only worth 100 bells. Fuck Timmy and Tommy I am a baller, they fuccbois. and Im tryna poke that pink shih tzu, Isbella, who works for the mayor. To think that 8-bits of processing power has given me all these fond memories.  Satoru Iwata, President of Nintendo, thank you for the games you have created for HAL Laboratory: Balloon Fight, Earthbound, and the Kirby series. Also, your help in the development of the Zelda, Mario, and Animal Crossing series, and giving gamers full transparency and insight into the development of their favorite franchises with the Iwata ask series. You willingly took 50% pay cut just to keep Nintendo on track. You once rewrote a significant portion of Earthbound from scratch in one night due to a power outage, and compressed the data for the Johto region in Pokemon Gold and Silver to make enough room for the entire Kanto region. Thank you for encouraging Sakurai to first make Smash Bros. even when no one else had faith in it.  Im sure children and adults the world over are mourning your death. Despite all the cultural differences and bullshit in the media that tries to separate us, you have brought us together on one common front. We are gamers, we are proud, and we love you for making us so. If anyone needs me, I'll be gaming, the mushroom kingdom needs me tonight."

In Japan his programming skills were treated in the same breadth as Carmack, Gebelli, Silverman, and Abrash.  He really is a legend in that regard.  In fact he was known as almost like ""the cleaner"" at Nintendo.  Whenever a project started slacking, or development was going slow, they would move Iwata on the project to show everyone else how it was done for a few months.  He literally saved Melee and a number of other games from development hell/cancellation.   In fact that was one of the reasons why he was able to move into upper management so easily - he pretty much interacted with the ENTIRE company at every level and had a history with every single development team."

wiiu,3d8y1t,krispyyyyy,7,Tue Jul 14 14:47:18 2015 UTC,"dkctf is probably more of a challenge. Loved the game, the unique levels, it was difficult but in a way that gave you a really rewarding feeling when you completed a level"
wiiu,3d8y1t,old_self,5,Tue Jul 14 13:11:31 2015 UTC,"I would say Yoshi. DKCTF is great but it can get really tough. Too tough for me to really enjoy it. For now Yoshi has proven to provide quite a bit of challenge as well but much better paced. You can get to the end of a level reasonably easy, but finding everything adds the real challenge.  In DKCTF getting to end is the challenge and it becomes a bit of a chore to go back and find everything."
wiiu,3d8y1t,Deddiekoel,3,Tue Jul 14 14:31:45 2015 UTC,"Both games are top quality and I've been thinking of Tropical Freeze as I make my way through Woolly World. I even loaded it up last night and replayed some of the first world.  Tropical Freeze is a challenge from start to finish, you really need some precision timing to make it through to the end and be prepared to die a lot, each time accompanied by the same annoying tune. Making it to the end of a level is enough of a challenge and the collectables seem kind of pointless in this context. There are mine cart levels, swimming kevels which are especially good, and some brilliant boss battles but I think it's fair to say the game is a little repetative.  Woolly World is more varied gameplay and level design, there's always something new going on. The challenge is to find your way through a level and get as many collectables as you can, the pay off when you get the five woolly men is a new playable Yoshi. One for each level, plus all the amiibo versions makes for a lot of Yoshi's to choose from. I think I'll keep going for them after I finish the game as I did with SM3DW.  One common factor is infrequent save points, maybe two or three in each (long) level. Dying in both games will give you a similar sense of frustration, especially if you are going for the collectables. Simple advice here is not to die."
wiiu,3d8y1t,krotonpaul,7,Tue Jul 14 21:13:16 2015 UTC,"Being in the US, I won't be playing Yoshi until October, but it looks very charming, and not too demanding. I have played and fully completed DKC:TF however, and loved it. The game plays wonderfully with the Pro Conroller, and feels a bit closer to the old SNES classics than Returns did with the Wii Remote. The game looks great, the music is seriously some of the best I have ever heard in my 20 plus years of gaming (David Wise is fantastic at his job), and it has a very good challenge to it, especially if you go for completion. Just beating the game can be challenging in it's own right, but fully completing it will really test your skills. The different characters are a fun addition in my opinion as well. On a side note, the boss fights are pretty intense, and I mean that mostly in a good way, though it does drive you crazy sometimes when you make it near the end of a fight then die, having to start it all over again. I'd definitely recommend the game personally, but Yoshi looks to be quite good in it's own ways as well."
wiiu,3d8y1t,Joshers744,2,Tue Jul 14 13:44:06 2015 UTC,DKTF is one of the best 2d platformers I have ever played. I did not think it was extremely difficult if you are just trying to beat the game. If you try to 100% or 200% it I assume it would be one of the hardest things ever but to just beat the game through the last boss was very fair IMO.

wiiu,3d8y1t,landi_kong,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:24:44 2015 UTC,"never played the newer yoshi, but i can tell you that DKC:TF is one of the finest platformers i have ever played, on any gaming device.  in my top 10, easy, perhaps even top 5.    a lot is made of its difficulty, but i'm hardly an extreme gamer, and i finished it.  (meaning i finished all the levels....minus the k-levels and  all the collectables).  it is difficult, but not beyond the reach of even a casual gamer.  even without finishing the game, i can't imagine a platforming fan (even a casual one) not having tons of fun within the game."

wiiu,3d3chi,ilovesnes,8,Mon Jul 13 05:04:31 2015 UTC,"I wrote this obituary for Iwata on Facebook, just to try and explain to my mostly non-gamer friends the profound impact that his death has on communities like us.   I woke up today to the incredibly sad news that Satoru Iwata passed away following bile duct complications. I imagine many of you will empathise with the sadness of an early passing, but may be unaware as to why this is such troubling news to a great deal of folks, many of whom never met him. In the iconic words of Mr Iwata himself:  ""Please understand.""  Millions will see the headline today that the CEO of Nintendo has died at 55, and assume that Mr Iwata was a man who made video games. Such assumptions are a mere glimpse of his legacy - Iwata made more than games, he made memories. Iwata's revolutionary and magical approach to running Nintendo brought myself and leagues of others a great deal of joy in times where we could find little of it elsewhere.  It's because of Mr Iwata that these memories not only hold an invaluable and sacred place in my mind, but will continue to persist and flourish throughout time, bringing new experiences and a familiar sense of pizazz and ecstasy to generations succeeding my own. Under his leadership, Nintendo managed to persevere through a seemingly insurmountable economic drought, even halving his entire salary so that workers in his company could maintain secure and comfortable wages.  Under his watch, Nintendo's products rarely caved in to the questionable ethics of the AAA videogame industry. They were complete, and what little DLC exists on the eShop is both fairly priced and released much later than the game's release. Iwata stuck true to his guns and the Nintendo Seal of Approval, all in a competitive space where consciously shafting the customer with disgusting corporate behaviour has become not only commonplace, but lucrative.  He was able to do so because Nintendo never felt like a company. Iwata was frequently at the helm of creative announcements, both at E3 and his own Digital Events, and everything he announced came with this remarkable combination of passion and composure. To many of us, his comedic antics combined with his direct community voice made Iwata more than just a CEO, but a friend who forged these wonderful worlds and characters to fall in love with, time and time again.  And perhaps that's a fitting theme to end my hamfisted and poorly written obituary/tribute to Mr Iwata - time. Not only has time tested Mr Iwata and his company, but the steps he has taken for an industry I love, and the many nights staying up to stupid o'clock with friends and family on games like Smash Bros & Mario Kart will never succumb to time. Instead, they live on; and so too will he, in his own way.  Linked to this post is just an example of how Iwata stayed passionate and lovable 'til the end. Unable to attend E3 2015 due to the health complications that would later take his life, he was still up for one last bash, making fun of himself to announce one last game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RpipJToXKQ  Rest in peace, Satoru Iwata."
wiiu,3d3chi,non_dom,9,Mon Jul 13 13:26:56 2015 UTC,"The ""play for Iwata"" and using his mii is great and all, but I think we should do something more meaningful in honor of such and incredible and inspirational man. We should have a fundraiser to make a donation to cancer research in the name of Satoru Iwata, or send need to his wife Kayoko, or send another giant card to Nintendo expressing our sorrow, our sympathy, and our gratitude. Or we should do all of the above.  I don't have any experience running these types of things, but I would gladly donate and participate."

He was a trailblazer, a very smart business man and coder.. but most of all, the guy seemed like he genuinely loved his company, their games and most importantly, us.

He had worked on and helped release Balloon Fight before I was born. He worked on Earthbound and Kirby as I was growing up, still too young to play games. I was 12 when he became a director at Nintendo, and I was 14 when he became president. I took special notice of him as Nintendo stock exploded and the DS changed the world. My respect and admiration deepened when he took a 50% pay cut after the 3DS had a rough launch. To me, more than anything else, he should be remembered for widening the gaming market so much. He helped lead us into this era where there are games for EVERYONE, regardless of your age, skill level, interests or hobbies. There are Wiis in retirement homes and people still train their brain every day with their Nintendo handheld systems. That's really something special. Thank you, Iwata-san."

wiiu,3d4rfq,tigersmhs07,9,Mon Jul 13 14:51:31 2015 UTC,"Common sense is enough for ""preserving"" consoles.  All my old consoles still work like they did in their prime. I remove the cables and controllers from them when I put them in the closet. I don't wrap them into anything either. After that, I neatly roll the cables and controllers and put them in a box near the console so I won't lose them. That's it. I have even stacked multiple consoles on top of each other and that hasn't caused any problems either.  The Wii U is a great utility device as well, which is why I plan to keep it plugged in for years to come. Among Netflix and Crunchyroll, it basically has ""chromecast Internet Browsing"". For example watching Twitch/Youtube on TV while the chat/comments is on GamePad is amazing. Or you can use the TV to watch shows through Plex Media Server and use the GamePad for browsing the Internet at the same time. It is very convenient."
wiiu,3d4rfq,Yhdiste,3,Mon Jul 13 15:49:28 2015 UTC,what is plex media server? How does it relate to the wii u?
wiiu,3d4rfq,QGTM,2,Mon Jul 13 20:46:29 2015 UTC,It's a program you can load onto your computer. You set your computer up as a transcoding server than you can play on your WiiU like a YouTube video on the internet browser.
wiiu,3d4rfq,Smudgeontheglass,-1,Mon Jul 13 22:32:47 2015 UTC,Even better: You can load it onto a Raspberry Pi ;)
wiiu,3d4rfq,AmansRevenger,2,Tue Jul 14 12:43:32 2015 UTC,It's too bad Wii U has the worst versions of the media apps.
wiiu,3d4rfq,bigblackhotdog,2,Tue Jul 14 06:43:48 2015 UTC,I agree. And the wii u does not even output full hdmi black levels unlike ps3 and wii u. You're losing a lot of black depth by playing media on the wii u.
wiiu,3d4rfq,redarkane,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:04:01 2015 UTC,"This is true to some degree. For me, the only thing missing is HBO Nordic. Hulu is not available in Europe.  Personally I haven't experienced any of the complaints with the Netflix Application. I am the only one using the Netflix, so the lack of account choosing doesn't affect me. It still plays stuff in 1080p without any issues and since I don't have a 3D Television, the lack of a 3D option doesn't concern me either. I prefer using Netflix on Wii U, because searching is easier with the GamePad than with a controller. It's also nice to change to Off TV Play incase someone else takes over the TV.  YouTube I use through the Internet Browser as it allows the highest possible resolution for the videos and you can surf the Internet while watching the video on TV. I have no experience with the application itself, but I wonder why someone would want to use that over using it through the Internet Browser.  So yeah, for me the Wii U caters all my media needs. And in my opinion the benefit of typing on the GamePad instead of with a controller makes up for a lot."

wiiu,3d4rfq,Albafika,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:41:21 2015 UTC,"What do you mean? I didn't understand your post, sorry.  If you keep the console plugged in, then you would continue to charge it like you are doing now. If you box the console, then you should box the GamePad as well, since by itself, it doesn't have any connection to the TV, which means you lose a lot of the features I mentioned."
wiiu,3d4rfq,Yhdiste,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:43:36 2015 UTC,"What I mean is that when the time to box the console comes, you'll have the concern of the Gamepad Battery dying, so you'll have to keep charging it now and then even if you planned to store the console for future use."
wiiu,3d4rfq,Albafika,2,Wed Jul 15 16:29:26 2015 UTC,Yeah I feel the same about the Wii U.  Will probably buy another when the next Nintendo console is out and they are cheap so I have a spare if ever needed!
wiiu,3d4rfq,Starsmustshoot,2,Mon Jul 13 14:56:56 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Plus I put so much money into games and dlc and such that I feel if I sell, I'm not gonna get that money back.  Might as well keep it and play it years down with my kids and hear them say,  ""wow dad! You have a wiu?!"""
wiiu,3d4rfq,Nutter_tKK,2,Mon Jul 13 15:02:56 2015 UTC,"As for the Laser? It could keep going for YEARS! I own an Early PS2 and an Early model Game Cube, both work fine. (Just to make it clear, my PS2 is one of the early European models has a Firewire port and lacks the Ir Port, which the later 50000 ""phat"" major revision removed/added. My Game Cube has the Digital A/V Port which was removed on later Game Cubes.)  I also own many CD and DVD devices dating back over 20 years and all still work as good as I got them.  Nintendo has backwards compatibility in their consoles often means your games will work on the new system. Given the Nature of system transfer, this means the games and saves are safe after the old system dies."

Though I don't know if it was the same with the Wii, Gamecubes have an issue that causes the read laser to weaken over time. This causes a lot of GameCubes to not read discs.  If it is similar with the Wii though, it's not really a major issue- In the case of the Gamecube it can be fixed by adjusting the potentiometer in the Gamecube. I have three gamecubes which all work fine, and two of them I bought for a few dollars off ebay because they were ""Broken"" and didn't read discs, and adjusting the potentiometer fixed them both."

wiiu,3d60te,Arsalan85,8,Tue Jul 14 16:11:08 2015 UTC,"So I played Never Alone not long ago (never played The Cave). My feelings on Never Alone are mixed. Basically the platforming is just mediocre. It works, but it just isn't that fun. On the other hand, the graphics, setting, and the little mini documentaries throughout are all well done. It's cool to actually learn something from a video game every so often."
wiiu,3d60te,LostOverThere,3,Tue Jul 14 01:04:11 2015 UTC,"I liked it more than most. You'll be able to complete it in an evening as it's about 3 hours long. Depending on what kinds of games you like this may either be a positive or a negative. For me this was one of the selling points as it's a nice, tight experience.  The platforming and puzzles are pretty standard. In fact the gameplay on its own is pretty mediocre. With that being said, the art, the sound, the music, and the atmosphere are all incredibly powerful. It's not often you get to learn more about an indigenous culture through a video game, so learning about indigenous Alaskan culture is super cool.   That said, just keep in mind its length when you're buying it. I'm not sure how much it is on the eShop in your region (in Australia it's $20) but you might want to wait for it to go on sale before picking it up."

wiiu,3d7440,awfulmemory,2,Tue Jul 14 01:11:47 2015 UTC,"Fire Emblem is a typical FE title; you progress through a linear map facing increasing challenges, with metachallenges of defending your units and portioning out XP to maximize growth. Generally speaking, it has deeper characters, a more intricate story, and higher challenge than Sacred Stones  That being said, Sacred Stones 'introduced' (it was in before, but a very different version) a world map mechanic which had monster skirmishes on previous maps and let you revisit shops to resupply. Your units are generally a good deal stronger than in FE, and you are given more options on how to progress them (when they class up in FE, Mage goes to Sage, no options for Mage Knight). The game is generally more forgiving. It just introduces, alongside easier encounters, a slew of user friendly mechanics that make the game flow simpler.  Going from Awakening, I think Sacred Stones will be a bit more familiar and will lead into Fire Emblem GBA, but most hardcore fans agree FE GBA is the better title overall."
wiiu,3d7440,TheHeadlessOne,2,Tue Jul 14 03:22:38 2015 UTC,Okay I'll try the easier one first I think.
wiiu,3d7440,TheHeadlessOne,2,Tue Jul 14 04:20:04 2015 UTC,"Sacred Stones is my personal favorite :) It hits the tone very well, it eases you into the action without making it downright dull (youll see that, for instance, the level designs are much more interesting than Awakening, which tended to focus on big wide open fields of tons of enemies) and has lots of fun mechanics to explore and customize each playthrough without trivializing your choices (free reclassing in awakening was a fun concept, but it started exposing a 'numbery' feel to the game) or being entirely superfluous.  but both are excellent games, so if you enjoy Sacred Stones definitely jump into Fire Emblem as well!  EDIT: I'll also add, Fire Emblem has a more cinematic, storytelling feel to it (due to the structure, the linear progression, etc etc) while Sacred Stones feels more like a journey/exploration. Fire Emblem can do things like revisit locations, have bonus hidden chapters, and have special subchallenges within each level.  I'm gonna be playing both of them again now!"

wiiu,3d5j5i,waterboysh,7,Mon Jul 13 19:49:39 2015 UTC,Depends on the region. I believe NA is the only region where 1 and 2 were bundled together in the same package.
wiiu,3d5j5i,Deceptiveideas,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:53:53 2015 UTC,"I believe other regions had it bundled together but only in the ""full package"" version. Meaning you had to pay a premium price for it."
wiiu,3d5j5i,CrunchyBum,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:15:11 2015 UTC,How long ago did you buy it?
wiiu,3d5j5i,TheOneWithALongName,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:21:07 2015 UTC,"Bayonetta 2? About 3 monthes ago. Sweden!  Splatoon, 1-2 weeks after its realese date."
wiiu,3d5j5i,CrunchyBum,0,Mon Jul 13 21:48:51 2015 UTC,I thought every copy came with part 1 also?
wiiu,3d5j5i,solinos,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:32:36 2015 UTC,"No, it depends on region."
wiiu,3d5j5i,CrunchyBum,2,Mon Jul 13 23:39:30 2015 UTC,really? TIL
wiiu,3d5j5i,iprefertau,3,Mon Jul 13 23:47:42 2015 UTC,splatoon imo
wiiu,3d5j5i,chowderneck,3,Mon Jul 13 20:29:01 2015 UTC,There is no wrong answer here. Bayo is about the best single action game you will ever play. Splatoon is about the freshest multiplayer kid-friendly game you will ever play.
wiiu,3d5j5i,bookchaser,3,Mon Jul 13 22:05:31 2015 UTC,Splatoon for two reasons.   Bayonetta will be great to play by yourself five years from now. Splatoon is great today while there are online Wii U players and the servers are running. Splatoon requires 8 online players per match. Splatoon is unique in the field of third-person shooters. Experience it.
wiiu,3d5j5i,Kinopravda23,6,Tue Jul 14 19:59:32 2015 UTC,"I prefer Bayo, but I'm more of a single player gamer. Splatoon is fun, but it kind of seems like doing the same thing over and over, whereas in Bayo you are progressing through the story and various levels. Obviously, Splatoon has a campaign as well, but it's short and not the main focus of the game.  I don't think Splatoon is worth $60, and Bayo provides way more value as it is two games in one. Just my personal preference though, Splatoon is a great game as well."
wiiu,3d5j5i,jekpopulous2,4,Mon Jul 13 19:27:53 2015 UTC,Bayonetta 2 is my favorite Wii U game. Splatoon is great but every Wii U owner should beat Bayonetta 2. It's just so good.
wiiu,3d5j5i,_Ariana_Grande_,2,Mon Jul 13 19:56:14 2015 UTC,Splatoon is great and all. But Bayonetta is one of the best action games out there. Truly GOTY material. I love Splatoon but it's not even close to being the masterpiece that is Bayo. It seems that most people in this thread haven't tried out both games.
wiiu,3d5j5i,esaevian,2,Mon Jul 13 21:04:11 2015 UTC,"I would get Splatoon sooner than later. It's very dependent on an online community which is pretty big right now. If you wait a while (who knows how long), the community will dwindle and it won't be as nice of an experience if you wait too long."
wiiu,3d5j5i,frenchcheeto,2,Tue Jul 14 18:37:36 2015 UTC,"If price is relevant to your decision, Bayonetta 2 is $45 at gamestop I believe."
wiiu,3d5j5i,soccerzz5,2,Mon Jul 13 18:42:19 2015 UTC,Bayonetta 1 & 2
wiiu,3d5j5i,cherish_it,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:56:43 2015 UTC,"It depends, Bayonetta is a little cheaper but once you run through the campaign, you're done. Splatoon has got a single player, local multiplayer, and the excellent online multiplayer, but for a little more. Plus it's got some updates coming. I'd say splatoon is worth the purchase more, but it's really a matter of taste"
wiiu,3d5j5i,dagboer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:52:34 2015 UTC,I would choose splatoon because of the hours you'll get out of it. I've passed 110 hours since launch and I don't really like to play during the summer ;)  Bayo2 is great too so pick it up when you can
wiiu,3d5j5i,allmilhouse,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:27:18 2015 UTC,Bayonetta is more of a niche game and isn't for everyone (I couldn't get fully into it personally) but Splatoon is a ton of fun and more of a safe bet.
wiiu,3d5j5i,LordCharco_iii,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:31:30 2015 UTC,"Depends. Do you want Nintendo Fun, or something darker and raunchier? If the former, go for Splatoon. If the latter, Bayonetta. If you're still conflicted, check some gameplay videos. That's what got me interested in Splatoon."
wiiu,3d5j5i,double_a_ron,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:40:32 2015 UTC,I can say Bayonetta 1 and 2 are phenominal games. I haven't tried Splatoon but I can't wait to jump into it.
wiiu,3d5j5i,Yamone,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:24:28 2015 UTC,"Tough one: both excellent games. But i agree with people saying splatoon relies on community and it's there now, you dont know about tomorrow."
wiiu,3d5j5i,ItsTheMotion,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:12:38 2015 UTC,I don't think anyone has mentioned that Bayonetta is more of a button-mashing game. So keep that in mind if that is or isn't your thing.

wiiu,3d4jy3,phantomliger,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:51:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks, man! I have seen this article as well, but the lack of release date makes me lose hope of a 2015 release... I will probably end up buying it for PS4."
wiiu,3d4jy3,phantomliger,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:25:23 2015 UTC,I think I will still be waiting for it. No harm in waiting with so many other games to play.
wiiu,3d4jy3,LegatoSkyheart,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:26:24 2015 UTC,Last I heard they were trying to make it downloadable for 8gb models which would make the game less than 4gb  which is stupid really.
wiiu,3d2ske,BansheeTK,8,Mon Jul 13 01:51:07 2015 UTC,"I just wish we could use Mii fighters in online Smash. I will definitely be playing MK8 in his honor this week with his Mii, though."

wiiu,3d2ske,JerrelSyrup69,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:20:22 2015 UTC,"Sorry if this is a stupid question, but I would like to pay my respects to Iwata and do the same in both Splatoon and Mario Kart. How do I change the name and mii of my current account? Or do I have to make a whole new one?"
wiiu,3d2ske,kmg1500,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:26:10 2015 UTC,"I don't play Splatoon, but if you play as Iwata online in Mario Kart, your name automatically changes to his name. I hope this helps!"
wiiu,3d2ske,jc8700,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:13:55 2015 UTC,"You can just change your Mii. On the Wii U menu, just click your Mii face on the top-left, scroll down and click ""change Mii"". I just found a Iwata QR code on google images."
wiiu,3d2ske,JerrelSyrup69,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:36:52 2015 UTC,I found out how to do that! haha.   Thanks though! I am now Splatting in Iwata's honor.
wiiu,3d2ske,kmg1500,9,Mon Jul 13 18:48:41 2015 UTC,nah but i will get toasted for him
wiiu,3d2ske,BobbyMcJangles,2,Mon Jul 13 02:24:14 2015 UTC,"I don't have time at home today, but I'd like to play Kirby Adventure some in honor of him. If I had the funds today would be a great day to download the 3D Classics version on the 3DS.  He really was a part of some good work throughout his life."
wiiu,3d2ske,Joshers744,2,Mon Jul 13 11:25:02 2015 UTC,I just made a Mii after Iwata and will play with him for a long time.
wiiu,3d2ske,DubiusMastabaitaX,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:48:49 2015 UTC,"I'm currently replaying Kirby's Adventure because I associate Mr. Iwata with Kirby (I feel like there's pretty noticeable input lag on the Wii U Virtual Console version, but I still feel compelled to complete it in his honor).   I can't wait to see all the Iwata Miis everywhere. I'm sure he'd appreciate it. :)"
wiiu,3d2ske,GamerLioness,2,Mon Jul 13 07:16:44 2015 UTC,Play the Wii version on Virtual Wii if the lag is bothering you; the Wii version runs perfectly.
wiiu,3d2ske,BeWithMe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:31:14 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of doing that since I have the original Wii Virtual Console version. However, by the time I realized the issue was input lag and not the game being more difficult than I remembered, I was already pretty far in the game and didn't want to restart. :("
wiiu,3d2ske,GamerLioness,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:34:55 2015 UTC,"The Wii version also looks better.  There is a ""blur filter"" applied to the Wii U version that hurts the graphics. The Wii version is crystal clear.  I know I'm not helping the situation. :P"
wiiu,3d2ske,BeWithMe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:50:14 2015 UTC,"Ugh. I really hope that Nintendo fixes the issues with the Wii U Virtual Console soon. I wanted to try Donkey Kong Country 3 since it's the only DKC game I never got the chance to play, but I don't want to deal with input lag in an action platformer. ;_;  Fortunately, my N64 library is pretty big, so I won't be buying any N64 titles on the Wii U VC."
wiiu,3d2ske,GamerLioness,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:50:54 2015 UTC,"I'm replaying Kirby's Adventure as well as playing Balloon Fight. Going out for drinks tomorrow with my fellow Nintendo fans, one will be to him."
wiiu,3d2ske,stringsanbu,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:48:38 2015 UTC,"Just bought a Wii U yesterday, I felt like Shit after hearing about his passing, and for years I've been playing Xbox, PlayStation and PC, I felt like Shit because Nintendo made me into the gamer I am today and when I was born in 1992 not much after that I was playing Mario/Duck hunt combo and then zombies at my neighbors on super nes, on my fifth birthday I got an N64 and after that just kind of gave up on Nintendo and I am deeply sorry for that. Rest in peace Iwata-San."
