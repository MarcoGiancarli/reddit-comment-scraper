One of the very first thunderclaps that TB, Boogie and others participated is the olive branch that got slapped down and dismissed immediately.   The reason why there is any fighting instead of discussion in the first place is because one side actively refuses all opportunities for it. From TB's round table to HuffPost-interviews and SPJ Airplay, only one side walks out as soon as they hear that there is going to be people from the opposite site too.  There is a reason for arguing. If the harassment-narrative gets challenged it will crumble. Talking about ethics is a career suicide because it would be straight out admitting that there is a problem on the first place."

Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,distant_worlds,5,Mon Jul 20 14:49:55 2015 UTC,"On the subject of nuance:   SPOILERS AHEAD FOR WOLFENSTEIN   I was over at a friend's house the other day and I was on his xbox one playing Wolfenstein: The New Order. I had watched some gameplay, but I never had the opportunity to play it, and I was hooked immediately. Luckily, my friend had already unlocked a lot of perks when I started a new game and he enjoyed watching me play, so it worked out nicely. We ended up sitting on the couch and playing through that entire game, but one part stuck out in my mind the most.  My friend had studied in Germany for a quarter and had visited some of the concentration camps that were turned into museums. So it was quite a creepy experience for him when we got to the point where BJ infiltrated the concentration camp. It got even more creepy for him when BJ escapes the incinerator. I handed him the controller and he looked around the room and was immediately reminded of the furnaces in the camps he had visited. The whole layout of the camp, the way people were bartering for food, the messages scrawled on the walls and carefully lettered on posters and gates...It made my friend pause for a moment. We both had taken courses on the Holocaust, and to see all those details in what should amount to a mindless power fantasy was one of the best examples of nuance I can recall from recent memory.  I don't think the anti-gamergate/sjw/whatever the fuck they call themselves crowd is against nuance, but I do wonder if they would even touch a setting like a concentration camp in any manner. Tackling that with tact and nuance takes a lot of skill, knowledge, and a bit of balls too. Fitting, given that Wolfenstein was a ballsy game."
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,BigDarthEz,3,Mon Jul 20 21:10:05 2015 UTC,"Wolfenstein: TNO was my game of the year for 2014 specifically because it was the kind of shooter that one wouldn't expect, given the market, to be philosophically heavy, and yet it was. It made BJ, and by extension, the player, reason to think about Nietzsche's famous saying from Beyond Good And Evil. It humanises BJ and subverts the power fantasy."

Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,distant_worlds,65,Mon Jul 20 15:56:28 2015 UTC,Personally I think everyone would be a lot better of if we stopped calling it GamerGate and just talked about the issues themselves.   Do you think that women could use better representation in video games and in the industry as a whole? Do you think that journalism should be free of collusion and potential bias?   You do? Great now we can all be friends!
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,L0ngp1nk,61,Mon Jul 20 14:58:48 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately the same problems existed without the hashtag. People called the idea that there was a ethics issue psychotic and a large bunch of articles came out that essentially said: there is no ethics issue, just misogyny. Those articles heavily referenced the GamerGate hashtag, which up until that point wasn't used all that much. People from the ethics side figured that they could try to counter the narrative by heavily using the hashtag to show that they did have genuine arguments."
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,DomesticatedElephant,43,Mon Jul 20 15:31:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and the problem is that they started to rally around a hashtag when they should have avoided it. The hashtag ended up being used to talk about or against two completely different issues, and while supporters of GG may have been using the hashtag to try to say ""this isn't about misogyny, it's about ethics"" it did nothing but muddy the waters and confuse the issue.  You ended up with situations where people saying that you can't have ethics in journalism without misogyny, which is ludicrous.  I have friends who said things like that to me. People who are normally very smart and level headed ended up getting so worked up over something they believed in strongly (videogames and women in video games) they became so polarized and blinded to rational thought.  The GamerGate hashtag (not the ideas behind it, just the hashtag) was the worst thing to happen in gaming in the last 10 years."

Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,thebluemonkey,15,Mon Jul 20 15:21:59 2015 UTC,"I pull this all the time. Couldn't care less about the hashtag, and I've dealt with enough real harassment to know both how much of a problem it can be and a few methods of dealing with it. It's hardly talking out both sides of my mouth to be able to pin up someone's shit behavior separately from their worthwhile opinions.  Of course, if not for the waves of 'gamers are dead' I wouldn't even know about the shit behavior, so we can thank some people for over compensating so hard."
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,Distind,6,Mon Jul 20 20:11:13 2015 UTC,"the other side wants to paint a narrative. a narrative started by people covering their asses (the journalists) and the SJW/feminist crowd lapped it up as fact. part of the whole ""Listen and believe"" crap they do as well to stifle criticism and independent thought.  gamergate started with a jilted lover's story about a female game dev, so because she was female, it was presented as a movement of misogyny and hate by the journalists, who when people dug into the claims about the game dev's sexual activities with several gaming journalists, published a ""gamers are dead"" article over several sites. People who believed the bs from the journos are the opposing side.   I find it hard to believe a consumer movement of hundreds of thousands would all be gunning to hate women and minorities and doxxing and harassing people. If that were the case, it would be a hell lot more effective at silencing people."
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,NightOfTheLivingHam,7,Mon Jul 20 17:20:06 2015 UTC,"... and they're both right! But there's no fucking reason for them to be arguing with each other.   The camps do talk past each other routinely. One reason for this is due to the kinds of demagogues each side has spawned. Causes and movements, even those without formal leaders, have a way of attracting firebrands - those who thrive on and grow strong from attention. On the Gamergate side there are characters like Milo Yiannopoulos, Mike Cernovich, Sargon of Akkad (and there have been others previously, like TheInternetAristocrat); on the Anti-Gamergate side are equally colorful figures Jonathan McIntosh and Anita Sarkeesian (the @FemFreq crew), Brianna Wu, and Randi Harper.   Open movements mean anyone can join at any time for any purpose. They work a bit like avalanches - as the movements grow and picks up speed, they pick up a lot of junk along the way. The larger the movement, the worse the signal to noise ratio gets, which leads to people looking for clarity or a way to tune in. That's where the demagogues turn up. They're a boosted signal - typically not a moderate signal - and they're often what people wind up tuning in to. To a given extent they wind up shaping the way the message is received by non-involved parties, and that in turn leads to some fairly stark ideas about what either avalanche actually represents.   On top of that you've got the regular crowd problem. Ask a dozen people who identify with either side what's up and you might get a dozen different answers, takes, and perspectives. Demagogues court that to a certain extent; lots of grey area and issues in flux means lots of ways to remain relevant.   That's one reason.  Another reason the camps argue with each other is because declaring an enemy brings in followers. The CGP Grey video illustrates this really well with its ""flowers and butterflies"" analogy. If you have someone to be pissed off at, you have a simple reason to keep existing - particularly when the other camp is also vocally pissed off at you, providing an obvious need to continue doing what you're doing. It's like you've built a hate microwave where angry feelings bounce off the walls and reflect around endlessly, but without the benefit of being able to harness that energy to prepare a tasty snack.   Finally, a third reason the camps talk past each other springs to mind: The hearts and minds of the moderates are rarely reflected. A lot of the initial traction for GG/AGG rolled out via Twitter where pithy and incendiary statements get the most favorites and re-tweets. Moderate thought tends to get shuffled aside. (CGP Grey's video covers this phenomenon as well.)   People who are on the fence about things tend to ask a lot of quiet questions, and they tend to do it obliquely so as to not drastically offend one camp or another. Moderates generally don't want to get swept up in show, don't want to join the mad house. They form their views and tend to keep their counsel separate, which contributes to people not hearing about what they think. As with most avalanche movements I think most of the living body of either side's thinking is closer to the moderate position than not (just as with US politics), but there's no real way to assess that. I think great progress could be made in normalizing things if moderates talked across the aisle and gently but firmly pushed their demagogues into quieter supporting roles, but there seems to be no mechanism for this.   Such things would take a real leader, which neither side truly has.   Instead, people go on yelling."
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,wingchild,2,Mon Jul 20 16:47:05 2015 UTC,The only difference is GG agrees and always denounces harassing of women for being women.

What doesn't help is that the very group that's supposed to be the mature group (e.g. games journalists, game devs) are, themselves, not presenting themselves in a professional or rational manner."
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,sockpuppettherapy,52,Mon Jul 20 15:18:31 2015 UTC,"How many of the attacks are from teenagers, and how many are from third-party trolls just trying to rile everyone up?"
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,ksheep,29,Mon Jul 20 15:39:36 2015 UTC,I'd figure those two groups have significant overlap.
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,Natemiester,29,Mon Jul 20 16:25:27 2015 UTC,"Tough to tell.  What's clear is that very few people on at least one side don't think that condoning bullying, misogyny, racism, and the like is a good thing.  So making it a sort of soap box argument, as if that's what the battle is about, is absolutely absurd.   But that's the importance of the top representatives of each group to not play into drama.  Gamergate, the entire ""argument,"" in and of itself, is all about drama in the first place.  Either way, if you're in your 20s (not you directly, but those that are actually wasting their lives doing this) and simply trying to incite trolling, maybe you should be doing something better with your time."
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,sockpuppettherapy,21,Mon Jul 20 16:17:38 2015 UTC,"God, i'm so glad that there are so many reasonable people here!  Some people just want to put people in boxes and attribute every individual opinion of every person in that box to every other person, and GG and anti-GG are apparently roomy fucking boxes. But it's easier to place people in a box and assign them values than actually finding out what each individual is about so fuck yeah, lets be extrimists!"
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,Teroniz,28,Mon Jul 20 15:05:15 2015 UTC,"And they're both going after the low-hanging fruit:  The SJWs target video games because video games have always been an easy scapegoat for those who lament society's shortcomings.  The GGers seem to feel that calling out a few indie devs and websites will force a paradigm shift in the video game industry as a whole.    But really, at the end of the day, both sides are just trolling each other.  Unfortunately there are a lot of young, stupid people with Twitter accounts making things difficult for everyone by tossing in death threats and other personal attacks."
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,Sponge-worthy,5,Mon Jul 20 18:10:12 2015 UTC,"The SJWs target video games because video games have always been an easy scapegoat for those who lament society's shortcomings.   Which was literally the worst idea possible. If you're going to go for something, go for something which HASN'T seen off a dozen such attacks in the past."
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,lukasrygh23,22,Mon Jul 20 18:24:51 2015 UTC,"First they tried to say that video games make people violent. It was scientifically proven false and a particular well known lawyer got disbarred.  Now they're trying to say videogames cause misogyny. This has also been proven false. Are women under-represented and often overly sexualized? Sometimes, but people take many scenes in games completely out of context in order to drive a baseless accusation. They're witchhunting videogames. Jack Thompson did this in the Violence argument. Conversely, men are often overly masculine and not a realistic representation either. Think Kratos. Should there be better written stories with women in a leading role and/or games that pass the Bechdel test? Absolutely, who wouldn't want that? As a straight cis-male shitlord gamer, I am fully in support of that.  EDIT: Kratos may not actually be a good example. He had a lot of reason for being the way he was. Perhaps... Doomguy? No, he's just a pair of shoes for us to step into, a completely void character. Duke Nukem... There we go! Found the example I was looking for."
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,Dekklin,4,Mon Jul 20 21:45:02 2015 UTC,I always feel as if people forget that there actually are strong female characters in games. With Lara Croft being one of the oldest and most popular.
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,ClikeX,14,Mon Jul 20 22:25:04 2015 UTC,"Well, they definetely picked the wrong people to attack. If your toolset of actions basically consists of building an online mob and shame people into silence/submission you'll fail epicly once you encounter a group of people that has been the target of constant shaming by society; nerds/gamers are used to be the bottom of the social scale, so trying to stomp us any lower on it simply can't happen, instead of potential school shooters and domestic terrorists we're now called sexists and racists - who cares?! They lack any evidence, so fuck'em.   And throwing shit on each other online?! Pft, pls ...  we've done infighting between each other about the most pointless things imaginable for more than two decades now or to quote a true legend: ""You can't out-shitpost a professional"". :P"
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,Obaruler,7,Tue Jul 21 00:05:58 2015 UTC,That's not really how it works. Those arguing that gamers are sexist are the people who have unethical businesses and are looking to put blame elsewhere.
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,Nomnom_downvotes,7,Mon Jul 20 14:55:24 2015 UTC,"And you have both sides thinking the other side stand in stark opposition to their ideals. You can't blame them, though, because it's the corrupt journos' deflection that got this shitstorm started."
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,sckpppt1401,11,Tue Jul 21 07:48:28 2015 UTC,It's really cool that Notch openly supports TB despite the small drama during the Yogscast/Notch incident 3 years ago.

Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,clickeddaisy,3,Mon Jul 20 14:26:58 2015 UTC,TB supported the yogscast in that case. Edit: http://www.pcgamer.com/minecrafts-notch-versus-yogscast-the-story-so-far/ and 14 monts later TB did not forget:  https://twitter.com/Totalbiscuit/status/342338173508128770

It may have been said in a moment of anger though, and he has not commented on TB again since then that I know of, so he may have moved on from that, while it is known that Simon remains hostile."
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,Tintunabulo,3,Mon Jul 20 15:26:38 2015 UTC,Is there a thorough summary of the events that occurred from a 3rd party news article? I've dredged through the posts regarding some incidents involving the Yogscast but was never able to get a full clear picture.
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,crash2bandicoot,4,Mon Jul 20 15:34:36 2015 UTC,"Simon acted like a little shit towards TB over the GG thing, TB and some others responded fairly, Lewis freaked and replied with some libelous bullshit."
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,VelvetSilk,55,Mon Jul 20 15:57:14 2015 UTC,I got that much from reading the relevant thread in this sub. I was asking for a 3rd party article cause I wanted to get a (relatively) unbiased recollection of the events.
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,crash2bandicoot,42,Mon Jul 20 16:00:22 2015 UTC,It started with the failure of Yogventures: http://www.pcgamer.com/yogscast-cancel-kickstarter-backed-yogventures-say-its-failure-is-a-deep-regret/ and TB had his opinion about it why you shouldn't kickstart games/ pre order games. When a few months later TB was discussing about sponsored YT videos in wich TB used the Yogscast as example http://winonasskarmory.tumblr.com/post/102824565086/lewis-response-via-reddit ignore the opinion but do read: http://np.reddit.com/r/Yogscast/comments/2mhlkk/totalbisquid_on_twitter_i_personally_think/cm4gmvm Drama came back earlier this year (2015) starting with: https://twitter.com/simonhoneydew/status/559688739107405824 wich lead to a tweet later: http://i.imgur.com/fwzluBM.jpg since then no drama happened ( so far)
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,bjclang,10,Mon Jul 20 17:45:09 2015 UTC,"As someone who, frankly, is slightly biased towards the Yogscast, what he said is accurate. Simon acted immature and called TB a ""crying pissbaby"". TB responded more maturely, then Lewis made a post over in /r/yogscast claiming that an employee of TB (which would be Gen or Zooc) accepted money from a dev for a WTF is, without stating which dev it was, what the game was, or how he knew this 'information'. IIRC, he later said that he only said that because of all the stress at the time."
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,beenoc,4,Mon Jul 20 17:23:31 2015 UTC,"I think you are messing your events up - the ""crying pissbaby"" thing was way later. Lewis blew up first over Tb critcising either yogsdiscovery or their discloser (can´t quite remember which one)."

Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,JackFromStraws,28,Mon Jul 20 17:37:29 2015 UTC,"It was in specific reference to an issue with TB (and I think Nerd3 ), though he's not been in any videos for months now, so who knows!"
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,VelvetSilk,13,Mon Jul 20 17:14:13 2015 UTC,"wait, what's happening? I haven't watch anything yogscast in over a year."
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,Moth92,12,Mon Jul 20 17:17:01 2015 UTC,What's happening with Simon?
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,Slothman899,13,Mon Jul 20 19:53:00 2015 UTC,"I don't even think ""the yogscast"" has gone full bananas, like /u/VelvetSilk said it only was Simon calling TB a ""crying pissbabby"" and while I don't watch Yogscast anymore (not for any political BS but simply because I lost interest) pretty much all of their recent videos seem to not feature Simon (judging by the thumbnails). I guess they told him to shut up and stay out of public things. Hell, even in the thread about this in the Yogscast-Subreddit their fans called Simon out on his shit."
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,NoNSFWsubreddits,16,Tue Jul 21 00:53:59 2015 UTC,"Simon had to go to the hospital a few months back and was recovering. He's done recovering now (as confirmed in a recent vlog), but is just sort of taking a (lengthy) break from Youtube."
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,beenoc,7,Mon Jul 20 17:13:15 2015 UTC,I think he was in the hospital during the time he made his tweet to TB as well. Could have been in a bad frame of mind. Hard to say though really.
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,tonybateman,2,Mon Jul 20 17:27:30 2015 UTC,"He's supposedly quite sick according to Lewis, but you'll have to take him at his word on that."
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,TheClassyPython,32,Mon Jul 20 18:42:18 2015 UTC,"Well, they have a long history going way back before they both were """"mainstream"" succesfull"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZHhwUK8aj8&list=PL645A94C4720C11E7 & https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpuRyuQu9BA  ...and were on good stance until the Yogventure fiasco."
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,bjclang,35,Mon Jul 20 17:37:46 2015 UTC,Yeah Notch could have easily held on to that and come out to join in on attacking TB now or recently. That he moved on and is showing support instead of hostility raises my estimation of him further.
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,Tintunabulo,20,Mon Jul 20 14:46:39 2015 UTC,"TB didn't say he hated him ""Says in the tweets"" just calling him an idiot for doing something he shouldn't have."

Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,Falodir,11,Mon Jul 20 21:01:35 2015 UTC,It was actually just sarcasm because heshe felt the need to mention shehe was a trans developer. And because heshe was being a massive douche.  And I use heshe because in the case of this person I couldn't tell which way they were changing. So I tried to keep it gender neutral.
Cynicalbrit,3dxxnf,ClikeX,43,Mon Jul 20 22:31:15 2015 UTC,"It's much easier to use ""they"" as a gender neutral pronoun. It's less likely to get misconstrued by anyone. Also s/he can work fairly well, but I think it's ugly to read and some people don't like it.  ""They"" is generally a great fallback. And yeah, a lot of the kind of people who use their status as a minority to try and victimise themselves often really hurts the rest of the community. It reflects badly on me and other members of the trans identity when someone appears to be using it just for personal gain."

TB gets views, people trust his views, he is valuable to a lot of people, consumers, publishers and developers.

Cynicalbrit,3dyh57,Doomsday11,2,Mon Jul 20 18:14:25 2015 UTC,Its an addictive thing that gets out of hand quickly. Not sure on the best process. If quitting cold turkey is best or potentially using a different medium/technology.  Looking inward and understanding the reason for using it is a good start. And deciding what the best approach moving forward would be.
Cynicalbrit,3dyh57,aa223,2,Tue Jul 21 00:08:21 2015 UTC,"The thing is, when your addicted to something, cold turkey is the only option to get really rid of it. There is no weekend beer for an recovering alcoholic.  I don't know if the addiction analogy really fits, but if it's really an addiction, stopping is the only long term solution. I know it would be bad for business, but then again I think TB is big enough to take the hit.  From what I understand he knows the reason; he's not thick-skinned enough and regularly tries to confront people on their bullshit, which ultimately leads to all this drama."
Cynicalbrit,3dyh57,Relnor,2,Tue Jul 21 07:16:10 2015 UTC,"I think thats a very simplistic anaylsis, while some people do need to go cold turkey, others can trasition via weening off or simply limiting themselves, simply put some people have the innate will-power if given proper moderation and can enjoy things in limitation.  Given the medium and TB generally needing to interct with people through it can't see how it in moderation isnt the goal here."
Cynicalbrit,3dyh57,darkrage6,2,Tue Jul 21 21:08:12 2015 UTC,Best for him although I don't see why he needs to know why he loves his job. I mean I can list reasons:   Able to work at home in underwear. Can set own schedule. Makes enough money to help family by just playing video games. Held a horrible job before and would not go back to it or to studying law because this is fulfilling. People love him and people wish they were him. Has a sexy voice which arouses women and turn men into buff dudes and he needs to have that voice out there. Wants an outlet to spread the love of video games and wants to make video games evolve to the next level. Fucking ribbing on FOV sliders. He has a chance to give back by giving exposure to other people like Zooc. Did I mention his sexy voice? Absolute fulfillment knowing that he has an audience and he is an important person in the industry. Fucking beat ass cancer which only gives realization to importance.   Well those are all the reasons I can come up with. And yeah if TB or anyone who knows him reads this just take it easy peasy lemon squeezy. And remember you have a dream job where you can be in your underwear and friends. How many people can say they have millions of people viewing them at 30?
Cynicalbrit,3dyh57,Relnor,2,Mon Jul 20 17:16:29 2015 UTC,"As shitty as working in retail might be, at least your email isn't filled with death threats, people don't try to make you out to be a monster online, and ocassional angry customers aside you're just left alone cause no one really cares about you."

I've only encountered a few trolls, mostly on gossip sites like TMZ when I was saying that I doubted whether their latest scoop on Lindsay Lohan was entirely truthful. I got all kinds of comments saying that they wished she would kill herself, same with other gossip sites like Radar Online.

Still though, aa223 assumes its super amazing - it's great, yes, but it has downsides too, I mean the guy is seeing a therapist because of these people."
Cynicalbrit,3dyh57,FluffyHippogriff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:32:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, and he loves those aspects of his work.

TB, you are actively inspiring a new generation of designers to create games. You are actively making a difference and contributing something positive to the industry.   There's a great many people on the internet who are very angry and bitter about a great many things for a great many reasons, but I don't think many of them can say that."

He, you,  handled yourself extremely well in conversation, and were very reasonable and well-informed. And so I watched more, I watched many WTF is.... and all the ShoutCraft videos, and the more I watched the more I respected the content, and even more so the person who makes it.  John, you've driven me to become an informed consumer. I care now about what I buy, why I buy it, and who I buy it from. I care about being informed, about being moderate and reasonable. I can't say any of that would be true if I hadn't run across your content.   Take care of yourself. You've helped make me a better person, and I know I'm not the only one. Thank you."

To then go on and survive cancer - something multiple members of my family weren't so fortunate in - while dealing with social outrage is a testament to his strength of will. I've only had the pleasure of knowing a few people of that type of character, but they've had one thing in common: They may go down, but they're never out."

I'm assuming you don't want to read out one response that's about 30 lines of text, so is there a limit you'd like to put in place?  Message:  TB, it's hard to put into words my respect for you. I started out as a regular consumer looking for a bit of insight into whether or not certain games were any good, and then I found you. Not only was your voice an attractive trait, but I appreciated the long breakdowns, and the detail you went into when critiquing a game. As time has gone on I've grown to appreciate you for far more than that. Not only have your videos helped keep me informed on the gaming world, made me laugh, and overall given me a great time, but your integrity and dedication to a consumer-first mindset is something I find very respectable and inspiring; perhaps that's concerning, too, but I digress. Overall, I'm aware we live in a world full of people who have some very harsh words to share with those they disagree with, but for all of them, there are far more who give unspoken praise every day. I can't imagine what it's like to receive some of the emails and snark that you do, but I do want to remind you, no matter how obvious it is, that there are millions of us who like who you are, and who appreciate what you do.   Thank you TB, for being the good, inspirational man that you are. Keep it up, and hang in there."

Cynicalbrit,3dyejj,lokithegood,3,Mon Jul 20 16:26:36 2015 UTC,I'm a huge fan of TB I've watched pretty much everything he's put out on his channel right from the beginning. I followed him him on twitter until things became too toxic and I killed my account (not because off him). I've never heard him say anything that they have accused him of. What I have heard is well reasoned discussion of video games and a passion that inspired the same in me. These people don't know you they don't follow you they don't listen to you. All they know is the rumor mill. You are so much better then kinds of people that harass and bully due to petty gossip. Keep up the great work and keep making gaming a better place. You have 2 million supporters and we're all here for you with this. How many can say that?   Is that okay?
Cynicalbrit,3dyejj,Niflaver,2,Mon Jul 20 16:18:10 2015 UTC,It is definitely okay :)

He's gone so far since then and as of this moment one of the best objective reviewers out there for PC gaming, the passion of so many people. I have not met TB in person even though I would very much like to shake his hand for all the biscuity glory, he's got great humour, great personality and great intelligence.  if it's not too much to ask I'd love for you to include this, I leave it up to /u/BlondishMist748 if it's good enuf;  My last 7 years have been very difficult with my mother succumbing to alzheimers at the age of 50. Many influential people kept me looking for a bright future, hoping for just something. Totalbiscuit has held me hopeful from being just who he is. I do not know how to return all that TB has given, but if I ever meet him in person I'd shake his hand and thank him for making me see a future, even with all the chaos around. Glory to the cynical emperor"

Cynicalbrit,3dyejj,InfernalAtheistLLama,4,Mon Jul 20 16:36:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think it's just important that he be reminded that no matter how much complaining and harassment he gets, what he does has been very important to a lot of people. I, for example, know that there are many things about the industry I would not have known without TB's videos. There are terrible games I would have been burnt on, and amazing games I never would have given a chance.  There's a saying about how if you give someone a fish, you feed them for a day... But if you teach them to fish you feed them for a lifetime. That's kind of what TB does. He doesn't just tell us ""Game is bad, don't buy"". He opens people's eyes to a lot of trends in the games industry, and says both good and bad things about games, when there's plenty of people out there just hyping a game up for views. He releases videos and audio blogs about news in the games industry, has brought us the podcast, and has called companies out on things they do when no one else cares enough to do so.  And really, if we're all learning lessons and realizing what's what in the games industry, then it's no wonder he gets harassed. Many companies won't like him. Dirty journalists won't like him. People who make their living off of harassing people and going on social media witch hunts will love to hate him.  But at the same time, who would want their praise? I think it's far better that TB is doing honest work and taking a stand regardless of how it affects his ""image"" or how it might upset radical groups. What he does is good for the industry, and is only bad for those that either don't care about the gamers or the industry, or those who have an axe to grind with them.  So while there are going to be moments where the harassment and pressure get to be too much, there's also a lot of good coming with it. People like TB help shape the future of the industry, and it's a good thing that those like TB are so influential. It means there's hope that things will get better, and that the industry will keep growing and moving in a good direction.  So above all, if you do this thing, I think the most important thing is to just point out that while there are quite a few extremist, meanspirited people out there, he's helped and is supported by far more. And yeah, it's going to get tough sometimes. But if he went for what was easy and didn't care about morals or the industry itself, he wouldn't be TB."

Please keep on the good work, because it's always appreciated, even if the loudest voices are those of malice.

Cynicalbrit,3dyejj,PleaseDontStalkMe,3,Mon Jul 20 18:30:12 2015 UTC,"A subscriber from Russia is speaking.   All I could say right now is: sometimes you need to step down in order to regain strenght and come back on top. For me being in the situation like John for numerous years is like being against the whole world or even your homeland. I have the same feeling sometimes when I interact with people. He is very passionate about gaming and PC gaming in general. And I can understand this. Not fully, because I need to be on TB's place, but I'm not a media person. I'm not a Critic or YouTube, I'm just a 21 year old guy with lots of issues on my own. But the ammount of stuff he did and he is doing right now through out his ""Career"" and life in general, it really inspires me, and John can be sure that he has my respect as well as his family, friends, colleagues and other subscribers supporting him.   But when I read ""Please no more TotalBiscuit and telling me to not support him, not sub to his twitch, twitter and YouTube"" providing shady evidence and telling me ""You can find it any other place online"" I can only compared to a ""Fuck you"" in the face.   This is a time when TB need to stay strong and never show a sign of weakness to these guys, because everything that is happening right now has one goal - to simply get rid of him, because... Well not everyone can handle the truth and a lot of many other reasons.  I hope this message isn't too long, but I have too much on my mind about this.

However, not only has all your work effected me from a consumer's standpoint. It has also effected me from a personal standpoint. Being able to put on one of your videos or an episode of the Co-Optional Podcast helps keep me sane while going through the troubles and confusions in my life as an nineteen year old.

Even though I'm mainly a console gamer, I always enjoy being informed by his PC focus if it means I come out of it having learned something about just how different the range of games are for the platform.  I've learned a thing or two about RTS games and MOBAs despite having very minimal experience with them thanks to his shoutcasting.  The podcasts are a treat to watch with the countless game discussions between people who are honest in their research and experiences. To hear that the man has been fighting cancer with everything he's got, to fight back against the flood of negativity to do the job he loves, it's downright inspiring.  And in my opinion, to see such a man impact the industry the way he has makes me hopeful for the future when it involves more informed consumers making decisions based on both objective facts and clear-as-day subjective opinion. TB, if you're reading this, you've got my support."
Cynicalbrit,3dyejj,Lime_Slime64,2,Mon Jul 20 19:38:25 2015 UTC,"In a dark period of my live I discovered TB, who re-ignited my passion for video games and showed me FTL and going through his back catalog helped keep me from dwelling on the depression and doing something ... silly. He introduced me the hearthstone and hours of joy watching and playing. I now have a circle of friends and we have our own gimickathons. Then came all the internet unpleasantness and TB always conducted himself with ethics and a ready wit. Thank you TB and forwards for great justice."
Cynicalbrit,3dyejj,Minihood1997,2,Mon Jul 20 20:37:14 2015 UTC,Thank you for being pro-consumer first and foremost. It's extremely difficult to trust anyone at all when the online landscape is full of clickbait and native advertising. You're one of the few people I trust to make judgements and statements in favour of consumers.
Cynicalbrit,3dyejj,wyrmw00d,2,Mon Jul 20 21:10:44 2015 UTC,"If my words mean anything, you're a great guy, TB, you've shown that it's possible to take video games seriously, and I think that's pretty important. You've always been honest and you certainly don't hold back anger where anger is due. To this day I still don't know why people (especially the SJWs) get so upset with you, I mean, you believe in a lot of good things. Does that stop their harassment? No. But if it helps any, I'm still here, and I'm ready to hear about those obnoxious games locked at 30 FPS."
Cynicalbrit,3dyejj,OscarTheTitan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:21:14 2015 UTC,"There is nothing really to say here that hasn't already been said, but TB, there are a lot of people who think the world is made better with you in it. You were open with your bowel cancer, a difficult thing to do, which will have convinced others having problems to get themselves checked. You admitted that you can no longer cope with the harassment you get and that you are going to a therapist, which will have convinced others facing problems to get the help they need. You keep your cool in times of extremism, which is a quality that more people in this world should have. We look up to you, and think you are doing a great job. Could we have better role models, perhaps. But we could have far, far worse ones."

I admire TB, he is funny, intelligent, and honest, and a level head in a field of extremists.  That someone like him gets so much abuse is just wrong. That anyone gets this sort of abuse is wrong.  TB, there are 2 million people on this planet who care about what you have to say, and who think the world is a better place with you in it. We are a quiet majority, but we are a majority.

Problem is that people see his content and automatically assume he doesn't deserve anything because ""all he does is scream into a mic"". Even TB had this impression before (you can watch some of the old TGS podcasts to see this), but after meeting him TB's impression has improved quite a bit.   He still doesn't like Felix's content, but he definately has respect for him. Sadly most people hate him out of pure jealously for the most part; which is pretty sad since the man is actually quite a decent person. It's a real shame to see people slander TB and PDP all the time, but that's just how unreasonable people act; attacking others instead of thinking the faults in their lives are of their own person."

He'll happily throw out insane, easily proved wrong accusations, rally his (relatively minuscule) followers to harass TB, then scurry off into the depths of the internet when people smell the shit he's thrown.   What makes it even more sad, is this prick will gain the attention of TB's hate brigade, which he seemingly so desperately desired, and they'll probably throw him a few more measly bucks, he probably requires to live, on to his patreon. Because that's the trend nowadays. Start controversy that scores you points with a certain group, then funnel those people into your fund-my-life campaign.   Sickening."
Cynicalbrit,3dvkuc,Flashmanic,12,Sun Jul 19 23:10:02 2015 UTC,"Okay now everyone go over there and ignore him. Ignore the hell out of him.  Because the one way he can come back from this is if people go over and tell him what a horrible person he is. Then at some point someone will, inevitably, tell him to go kill himself or some such and BAM, he has credibility again and can spend the next 6 months or so going on about it, until we get bored of him."

Cynicalbrit,3dvkuc,loliger_rofler,22,Sun Jul 19 22:55:12 2015 UTC,"As somebody who hasn't used twitter in a long time, and who only really used it as a mediocre RSS feed at the time even then, I always find the furore that comes from that website to be upsetting. I've known MovieBob for longer than I've known TB, but only ever from the content he made back in the escapist days.   Whats all this about him trying to get a reaction out of TB? I always try to detach myself from the personal lifes of content creators. Death of the author and all that, but now I'm worried."
Cynicalbrit,3dvkuc,WodensBeard,44,Sun Jul 19 23:21:58 2015 UTC,"Eh..... alright, I'll take a swing.  First some disclosure.  I was also a bit of a fan of MovieBob when he was at The Escapist.  He was always a little bit curmudgeonly on that website (I remember enjoying it when he got really upset during a review of a really bad movie, because he would slip into his Boston accent and we would be treated to 5-6 minutes of BOSTON RAAAGE SMAAAASH), but he always had an air of genuine geeky enthusiasm about him when he talked about something he cared about.  He once did a 4-5 part series on the history of Hollywood on that website: I loved it.  Well, it suffices to say that I just can't watch his stuff anymore.  He used to be somewhat curmudgeonly--actually a little bit like TB, though that's practically an insult to TB at this point.  Now, he is one of the angriest, most hateful people in the GamerGate debacle.  He hasn't engaged in truly heinous behavior like doxxing or harrassment, but he's.... not rational, to put it politely.  He views everyone who supports or hasn't condemned GamerGate as subhuman trash (his words, not mine), and everyone who thinks that it's not a hate group as a complete idiot (I think he tweeted that today, maybe yesterday).  He views TB's fanbase as subhuman cretins.  He is... not a very nice person.  That's not to say that there aren't plenty of people on both sides of this controversy that I would never want to meet face-to-face, but I used to actually like the man.  Occasionally, he takes shots at TB over Twitter, and he gets pretty angry. I think TB even deigned to respond to the hateful man a few months ago.  And with that, I'd invite anyone who disagrees to correct me.  I try to spend as little time as possible thinking about social media, and MovieBob is one of those fellows whose work I enjoy(ed), but no longer can follow because their personality is just that unpleasant."
Cynicalbrit,3dvkuc,DoctorOblivious,15,Mon Jul 20 00:44:12 2015 UTC,"To add to your post, he also takes political identity very seriously. If you're not a progressive/democrat, or follow the ""correct"" line of political thinking, he considers you a terrible person."
Cynicalbrit,3dvkuc,Toadovsky,7,Mon Jul 20 02:08:27 2015 UTC,And his line of thinking also completely forgets there is a world outside of the USA!
Cynicalbrit,3dvkuc,whitson774,5,Mon Jul 20 10:01:46 2015 UTC,"I was a fairly big fan of movie bob for a while too. Hell I support social justice - though not the way these people go about it, or some of the more extreme things they say. I certainly don't believe no bad tactics only bad targets. Social justice is based on a set of principles, and if you can't adhere to them while advocating for it, then you're a fairly massive hypocrite. And right there that's why and when I stopped being a fan. How can you treat people the way these people do and claim the moral high ground or that you are the ""enlightened"" ones? It's a bloody shame. He made a video talking about not becoming the bullies we faced in high school. I thought that was great. It's a shame he seemed to forget all about that."
Cynicalbrit,3dvkuc,lokithegood,35,Mon Jul 20 16:33:21 2015 UTC,"He basically went full SJW cult and started to insert this stuff into his big picture and later his review videos.

Cynicalbrit,3dvkuc,razisgosu,80,Mon Jul 20 05:45:23 2015 UTC,stupid question maybe: isnt this libel? (for clarity: what was printed about tb is libel imo)
Cynicalbrit,3dvkuc,DerberAuner,39,Sun Jul 19 22:15:55 2015 UTC,"Technically speaking it can be considered libel, though the United States doesn't really have good laws regarding that, at least not to the extent that the UK does.   Because of the first amendment the whole defamation thing is hard to handle, and it really depends on the standards of the state you are living in. Even putting aside that problem, libel cases have rarely gone to court and prosecuted in US history; so there isn't much precedent to back such a case especially one dealing with online libel.   The only point that is defined is whether or not the comments by the person spouting the nonsense is ""fair and legitimate criticism""; if it was based entirely on lies (like this one) then it may work out. But once again, it is by no means a slam dunk."
Cynicalbrit,3dvkuc,Hollownerox,20,Sun Jul 19 22:30:26 2015 UTC,"im just asking, cause i honestly think this is one of those cases where the only thing left for TB to do is to take legal action, assuming this shit continues.  either that or he has to give up. i dont see this ending well for his sanity otherwise.  i see some parallels to another gaming/ethics related piece of drama, with Richard Lewis and the mods of the league of legends subreddit. and the only thing, when common sense, when appeals to sanity and good conduct or maybe even morailty or ethics fail, is legality or retreat. In the RL case i was honestly hoping hed go in on the mods legally, cause he does have a case apparantly (also for libel), he said so multiple times, and that lawyers have actually confirmed it to be libel. so far nothing has happened though. :/  unfortunately for TB, retreat is not an option, since his livelyhood depends on making gaming content, and i think it would be out of character for him to drop all the ethics related stuff. that leaves legal action :S."
Cynicalbrit,3dvkuc,DerberAuner,14,Sun Jul 19 22:40:10 2015 UTC,"Problem is that court cases are a last resort for good reason. They take up a lot of money, and a lot of time; and you're unlikely to see the result for years. And the thing with these kinds of court cases, especially in such a gray area like the internet, they are more about creating a precedent for the enforcement of laws rather than about the people actually involved.  Take the Jim Sterling and Digital Homicide debacle, people on Youtube actually wanted DH to go to court. Because if that happened then a precedent would have been set on the misuse of DMCA copyright strikes on Youtube. Jim Sterling wouldn't have actually benefited from it, if anything he would have likely lost more money in the end even if he won the court case. But the point is that the industry as a whole would have benefited from it.  As I see it now, TB going to court over this would be a bit too drastic of a measure, and there's little benefit for doing so. But then again I'm not an expert in law, so there's a chance I might be overlooking something."
Cynicalbrit,3dvkuc,Hollownerox,4,Sun Jul 19 22:54:16 2015 UTC,"Technically speaking it can be considered libel, though the United States doesn't really have good laws regarding that, at least not to the extent that the UK does.    Playing Devil's Advocate, the US has great laws in regards to defamation. The standards are deliberately high (especially so on public figures) as to prevent abuse of defamation laws to silence criticism. The UK libel laws are actually quite bad and have been abused numerous times in the past to silence legitimate criticism. There's reasons why the US does not recognize libel rulings from UK courts anymore.   Even putting aside that problem, libel cases have rarely gone to court and prosecuted in US history   Libel is a civil action, so they are never prosecuted. ;)"

Cynicalbrit,3dvkuc,Hollownerox,61,Sun Jul 19 22:20:54 2015 UTC,"Which is probably what the guy wanted in the first place so he can complain about TB siccing his followers to harass him. Since the boogeyman he wants doesn't actually exists he has to make up a scenario where one exists; at least in his distorted view of how the world works.  Not to mention the vast majority of messages to him are most likely going to be neutral and merely stating how his information is inaccurate. Apparently any form of mass messaging, no matter what the actual contents of the messages are, will be considered harassment by these kinds of people.   Mirrors must have become a bloody luxury since I last checked, the sheer lack of self-awareness of these people is something I simply cannot comprehend."

Is because what you believe in and stand up for -- honesty, ethics, and creative freedom in the games industry -- is a direct financial threat to these scam artists, corrupt journalists, and bullies.   As a woman who games, I am very thankful for the content you produce to keep me informed of my buying choices. You probably don't need me (or any of your female fans) to validate this, but it might feel better to hear it anyway : You are not a misogynist, and you are *not * sexist -- instead, most of these ""social justice"" people purporting to be on my side in fact, are -- and I, for one, am glad you pointed out that women are NEVER the only ones facing harassment online.   Honestly, the worst thing I can ever accuse you of is perhaps being a tad bit dismissive of the Tex Murphy games in that Tesla Effect WTF Is... you made. Damn you that game with all its outdated design was GOLD!   Please keep being awesome TB, DO NOT stop believing and standing up for what you believe, and take care of yourself!"

However after simply observing some forums for the past few months about TB I've nearly been ripping my hair out looking at all the misinformation and desperate desire of some people to portray TB as satan. I can't imagine what it's like to have all that hate directed at ones self and have to combat it daily.  Anyway better queue the posts of empty apologies and false sympathy on the same forums that have put him over the fire for everything he's said so they can go on feeling superior about them selves. :P  Just remember TB, for every negative comment and piece of misinformation out there, you have tons of fans that greatly appreciate your work and care.

Cynicalbrit,3dvkuc,tehlaser,8,Sun Jul 19 22:50:34 2015 UTC,"Suing for libel is fantastically difficult in the US. As a public figure, which TB probably is in this context, he would have to prove actual malice. The statements being false isn't enough: the speaker has to know that they were false when they were said, or have reckless disregard for the truth. There may be a case for the latter, but it's one hell of a fight, and would cost a fortune to prove."

And honestly, I think it was a mistake for TB to call out Mr. Kaiser and engage with the surrounding community on this matter. It seems to me like TB just wanted or needed to vent for a bit, and given that, he showed ample restraint because he could have done a lot worse given the circumstances."

After this, I don't care if I ever do.    Read the initial response that TB made almost a year ago.  TB told everyone to calm down wait for the smoke to clear before making any assumptions and to stop shouting at him.    If you push for proof of the claims against TB, you'll get the they said that he said that she said BS and the decade old IQ post...  When you provide them with links to what TB ACTUALLY said, the story will change to avoid admitting they are wrong.  TB was pretty much the ONLY person trying to get a discussion started on the issues that blew up after Eron's post.  Here's the thing though, I can show you a Video from IIRC almost a year before then that he was on discussing the SAME issues.    Leave the muckraker alone.  Don't give Rowan Kaiser ANYTHING.  A wall of silence provides no benefit.  Let TB make the response he wants to make and ignore the person.  ""I was blocked by 5000 people on Twitter after making this comment!""  Sounds pretty pathetic.    ""I was harassed by 5000 people on Twitter after making this comment!"" isn't and it gives the baseless claims some traction."
Cynicalbrit,3dvkuc,infinitesheeps,31,Sun Jul 19 22:59:36 2015 UTC,"Yup, TB was the one pushing for the ""round table"" thing. Sadly, all journos scattered like cockroaches as soon as the GameJournoPros was leaked. Of course they didn't want to talk at all when there was evidence that they were indeed guilty on things accused of.  I'm sad that TB declined the SPJ Airplay now that there is finally some kind of round table happening (again with no participants from the guilty sites such as Kotaku, surprise surprise), but I understand why. Hell, this soundcloud tells everything one needs to hear to understand how devastating combination of events this last year has been for him.   I appreciate the good fight TB has been doing, but he really doesn't and shouldn't need to take all the beating for it. These problems in gaming industry have bubbled for a long time now."

Edit: I think this is going to happen TB's comment I know Adam pretty well, he was on our podcast at one point. They are absolutely entitled to express their opinion in whatever way they choose to. It's obviously not hate. A little misguided in places certainly, but not hate. I'd happily debate them on the topic, or I might release some kind of response later just to further the conversation.   Whatever the case, I'm not upset by this video, though I am a bit surprised that its such a slow newsday that a Steam curator page deserves an entire video.

These are hateful individuals deliberately and falsely spreading lies and something ought to be done.  I know TB doesn't like asking for coin from his audience but please, TB, take crowdfunding money for a lawyer. We hate seeing this happen to you, too.

Cynicalbrit,3dvkuc,acathode,33,Mon Jul 20 13:46:13 2015 UTC,"Alright... color me stupid on this, but I just don't get it.  TB hosts an entertaining games talk show, does first-impressions videos, evangelizes for consumer rights in the video game market, and raises money for people in Africa to get water.  His reviews, and podcast, show him to have a droll sense of humor, he's snarky in the extreme; so if you ask him something, you'll most likely get a 'stupid to the extreme' answer or reaction first.  I can understand not liking that, sure.  I can't see a reason to attack someone over that.  I could see shooting the same, silly, obviously over-the-top pot-shots back at him.  He'd probably be phenomenal to banter with.  He takes just about as well as he gives on Co-Optional, and it's fun to watch!  I'm not some sort of fanboy, here.  I disagree with him regularly on a variety of games he's taken a look at, at stances he's taken concerning consumer rights, etc.  On the games, I can recognize the difference in playstyle and desire between us; I really enjoy Borderlands 2, for example.  On consumer rights, I think he forgets and forgoes some of the responsibility on the seller's side, and doesn't give them their due at points.  I am glad he's brought his thought-out opinion to the situation, though.  Makes me think about mine.  I see all these people performing personal attacks on him, though, which I don't get.  It's just showing how weak your position is; how poor you are in thought that the best rebuttal to his success, to his point of view is ""TB's a big doody head!""  Isn't the concept of empathy mostly universal?  Or are most people just psychopaths?  I don't get it."

Cynicalbrit,3dvkuc,CynthiaCrescent,10,Mon Jul 20 00:15:54 2015 UTC,"It's not about games or anything really related to games at all.  This is about politics, or rather, it's about political tribes - TB signaled that he wasn't part of these people's political tribe by not unanimously supporting them but rather taking a balanced stance - and thus he's an enemy - and since he have a large following and a big impact on a field that these people want to dominate and use as a political platform, he had to be crushed.   That's really what it comes down to in the end - and as long as TB doesn't bend the knee to them and capitulate, there's nothing that he can ever say or do that will be right, and these people will continue attacking and hating him. Honestly, TB could find the cure for both HIV and cancer, and they'd call him a racist because he didn't cure ebola, ""Why do TB hate Africans? #RACISM #BlackLivesMatter!!!!!""...  The reason this doesn't make sense when you first encounter it is usually because unlike these people, you don't identify as strongly with your political beliefs, you don't divide people up into friends or foes based on their political beliefs. These people do - to them, ""republican"" isn't simply someone with different political belies, it's a slur.   It's a very black-and-white worldview, that is extremely intolerant towards those who show the slightest deviation - it's ""You're either with us, or against us!"", turned up to 11. As a result, they have a very hard time co-existing with people who aren't part of their tribe - and that, combined with the automatic drive to proselytize that comes when you've convinced yourself that you know whats best for everyone, is why we see these people show up and create this sort of drama all over the place.

Even if literally everyone of Rowan's followers 100% agree with what's said, that's still just 5000. 5000 is a drop in the ocean compared to 2,000,000. 2,000,000 people who not only don't think bad thoughts about TB, they also want to be notified whenever he released content because they respect his opinion and work so much.  2,000,000 people agreeing and respecting TB, far outweighs the 5000 crazies.

Simon's tweets I'm pretty sure came out while he was suffering from an illness that ended up requiring surgery, and means he hasn't been in any Yogcast content since early this year.

I enjoy the spotlight you bring to independently produced games that I would never have looked at otherwise, much less purchased.  I respect the standard you hold games to, not just on a general level but individually for each game you discuss.  I also really enjoy it when you seek the opinions of those you can't necessarily speak for, such as the video featuring the conversation with the two developers during the whole ""paid mods"" fiasco.  But what I respect most is your ability to look stupid in the face and combat it with calm, well-reasoned words.  It is the only quality another human being can possess that I am ever truly jealous of.

Gaming is close to my heart. I was never a popular kid growing up, and gaming was a way to escape some pretty shitty situations. Eventually I found friends that shared my passion, and I still use games to meet new people and socialize.  Games were always a safe space for me. It didn't matter who you where, what you looked like or sounded like. You accepted others and they accepted you. It was a chance to feel normal, respected and understood in a world that seemed empty of that.  It pains me to see people being harassed and bullied in the gaming industry, since video games were an escape for so many of us from those types of people in the first place.  I am truly sorry you have to endure this bullshit, no one should have to be the butt of such hate. Unfortunately, the vocal minority often silences the rest of us, but know that the majority of us support you and those that have to put up with such harassment.   I get a lot of enjoyment out of your work, and have been proud to see you tackle and not back down from talking about the ethics problem in game journalism. We need that, and you should be proud of the work you've done.  Thank you for everything, and know that there are more people that support you than hate you.

Personally, I find both the UK and AU versions of this cereal to be horrible. They're like things you feed your grandparents along with a cup of prune juice to make them go toilet. I'd be somewhat surprised if they were being manufactured in the US given the American propensity for Chocolate Frosted Sugar Bombs  Of course, my opinion is extremely biased. I am a bacon and eggs man myself (Bacon Master Race)."
Cynicalbrit,3dwj1f,VidiotGamer,2,Mon Jul 20 12:41:30 2015 UTC,"You can order it off Amazon here in the U.S., don't know if any stores carry it. The U.S. tends more towards shredded wheat than the solid bricks of wheat.  You nailed its purpose though, high fiber cereal is for digestion and good bowel health. Usually, older people tend to eat it as it helps to keep everything ""moving"" smoothly.   Though high fiber content failed to keep colorectal polyps returning in studies, it's ability to reduce heart disease and diabetes is well worth it's addition to anyone's diet."
Cynicalbrit,3dwj1f,CBCronin,2,Mon Jul 20 16:17:35 2015 UTC,"it's ability to reduce heart disease and diabetes is well worth it's addition to anyone's diet.   This is probably just more correlation than causality. You can, after all, completely avoid type 2 diabetes by eating several traditional type diets that eschew sugar or complex carbohydrates.   Basically, I wouldn't take claims on the side of a cereal box at face value :P"
Cynicalbrit,3dwj1f,Sethala,2,Mon Jul 20 16:37:11 2015 UTC,"Concerning diabetes; a recent study by the Univ. of Cambridge actually confirmed it, though I personally believe that the most important factor of increased fiber in a diet is that it makes people feel full longer. In turn, they eat less and are less likely to become obese.   As to heart disease, there is no question of the benefits. The precise mechanism by which it does so may not be agreed upon (personally believe it has to do with regularity and reduction of hypertension) but, the positive effects repeatedly show up in studies.  I don't eat cereal, so couldn't tell you what is on the side of the box or not."

Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,Heaven_Smile,243,Sun Jul 19 00:16:50 2015 UTC,"So here's the thing. You can point out the fact that the game is 30 FPS on their forums, and they can delete your posts and ban you.  You can point out the fact that the game is 30 FPS on the tags, and Steam will ban your tag.  You can point out the fact that the game is 30 FPS on the curator groups, but developers can block your group from appearing - except to your followers. Which is good, since the people who follow your group are the ones who should always be aware of it.  Where is the last bastion of informing fellow consumers about objective facts about a game?  The reviews, if you own the game. The most highly voted review will always appear and the developer can do nothing to stop it from appearing. Take your complaints there. The sad thing is, a curator group, a forum post or a tag doesn't necessarily negatively impact a game. If you have to leave a negative review, you're hurting it's ranking in Steam search.  If that's the way developers want it, so be it."

Take for example the paid mods deal, when large subreddits went to review bomb Skyrim and dropped it down pretty low.  My point is that no good game will be getting horrible reviews, and no bad game will be getting negative reviews unjustified.  Because negative/positive reviews doesn't really matter, if a game interests you, you will go and read the reviews about it or watch a YT video about it."

That's all true, and that's on me.    But does that make it okay for the guy who wants to abuse the system to be able to?    Another way to look at it.  I doubt that TB has ever given his impressions on a product and then refunded it.  That just doesn't seem very ethical.  It's true, he gets a lot of free review copies of products, but he's said in the past he has to buy a lot too.  And he has no problem doing so.  I doubt for example, that he got a refund for Guise of the Wolf.  (Assuming he paid for it in the first place.)  I'm sure he'll never play it again...but he still has his copy.  There just seems to be a legitimacy about it.    I guess there's no law saying you have to have a product to provide a review of it.  But I personally wouldn't give much weight to a review of a person who no longer had the product, as compared to someone who did.  The potential for abuse is there, and that's enough for me to pay more attention to the other guy's review."

Claiming people go after review ratings and don't actually read reviews is claiming consumers are dumb, calling out games on 30 FPS is NEVER anti-consumer. If you feel the action the developer has taken on behalf of their game is worthy of a Negative review, then give a negative review. Just like a lot of people did to voice their concern about Skyrim.  I hate that this is what its led to, I'd much rather have 30fps & Third-Party DRM And all the other tags that were banned to still be there than resort to this.  But the fact remains that Valve keeps defending the practices of these developers whenever they try to censor and hide the fact that any negative light shed on their game is being banned or removed.  How do you think we should solve this problem? It is a legitimate problem that developers started meddling in how gamers tagged games and were calling out on certain things that might make consumers of games not buy a specific game.   Its anti-consumer to think censorship is good and claim that calling them out on what was censored by writing a review to make sure its no longer censored is circular logic. Its hurtful to the game's rating yes, and it might be hurtful to the developer of the game, not to the consumer in any way."

EDIT: Because I'm not responding to any more comments. I'm not trying to advocate that 30FPS is some sort of superior experience, that we shouldn't have options menus, or some bullshit like that. I'm advocating that the decision for this is purely on the devs, and the presence/absence of these should be factors in your decision making when buying a game, and probably not the driving factor. We're not entitled to these things. We can expect them to be there, but shouldn't be offended when they aren't.  I made this post because of the assumption that determining the framerate of the game was ""simple"". It can be. In an ideal world where people make the right decisions it is.

That's what an options menu is for: So you can tailor your gaming experience to what your machine can deliver and what you want. Mediocre PC but don't like 30 FPS? Sacrifice some fidelity for 60 FPS.

The reality is that you might not know you're inexplicably tying something to the framerate until well after you've done it. Its not this intentional screwing up of the ability to have a high FPS. Its some developer working long hours trying to get the project he working on out the door, its someone making a small mistake or having a lapse in judgement while under a tonne of pressure and creating this technical debt for fixing the mistake that might not be itself large, but when combined with everything else becomes an incredible barrier to rectifying the issue, especially when its matched against other problems, especially given 30 FPS doesn't actually keep people from playing the game (like a game breaking bug)."
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,morgoth95,2,Fri Jul 17 20:15:52 2015 UTC,if people wouldnt care about 30 fps or not whats the point of this currator?
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,agemennon,5,Fri Jul 17 20:18:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying they don't care. I'm just saying most people care more about whether or not the game even runs.  30 FPS is utterly subpar when compared to 60FPS, but there are plenty of people that care more about other parts of the gaming experience than that (myself included). And I'd rather devs make the decision that they think is the best for the game than feel obligated to deliver a 60 FPS (or higher) experience that results in compromising on something else (I.E. framerate stability, because stuttering is awful)."
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,KingMong,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:33:51 2015 UTC,"Options menus... Locking the framerate is dumb and if you tie it to the game logic or other stuff,  you have built a a broken game. There is no need to do it,  $5 games don't do it,  so a triple a has no excuse"
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,agemennon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:47:36 2015 UTC,The opportunity cost to fix it on a small indie title is infinitesimal in comparison to the cost to fix such issues on AAA title late in development.
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,KingMong,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:51:10 2015 UTC,"That's why you don't tie it to the logic,  ever,  it's not something to do by accident"
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,namboy94,0,Fri Jul 17 21:42:37 2015 UTC,Not tying game logic to fps in the first place should be a no-brainer for AAA studios.
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,bloodstainer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:19:03 2015 UTC,"No, of course the game runs, having a 30 fps lock has nothing to do with that."
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,sharkwouter,2,Fri Jul 17 22:19:54 2015 UTC,"A lot of games I've seen actually run at 30 fps, because the developer made changes to the engine. So in those cases it is actually harder to have the game run at 30 fps."
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,Dexiro,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:23:36 2015 UTC,"It's absolutely more difficult to make a game run at 60fps.   Not to say it shouldn't still be the standard, I guess there's a lot of messy coders out there."
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,morgoth95,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:50:08 2015 UTC,in what way shape or form is it more difficult to make a game run at 60fps technically(im not talking about messy code that makes your game run slow)
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,Dexiro,6,Fri Jul 17 21:16:11 2015 UTC,Well written and well optimised code is more difficult to write. Sometimes a mistake is made that means the framerate needs to be limited.
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,flyingjam,5,Fri Jul 17 21:33:58 2015 UTC,"Frame rate limits usually exist because parts of the game logic (usually physics or animation) are tied to the games fps. This is not a ""mistake"" one casually makes, like forgetting to deallocate something, it's a major architectural design choice.  You have to decide early on that you're going to tie fps to logic and then write much of your code conscious of the fact."
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,Dexiro,5,Fri Jul 17 21:59:54 2015 UTC,When code is structured badly and becomes a tangled mess all kinds of shit can happen.  Also are you entirely sure the initial framework sets in stone whether framerate issues can happen? Surely something as simple as forgetting to use the delta time can cause these sort of issues.
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,flyingjam,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:19:44 2015 UTC,"Surely something as simple as forgetting to use the delta time can cause these sort of issues.   That's the kind of thing you forget when you rewrite pong or something. When you're making a full fledged game, you're going notice that pretty damn quickly.   The issues that commercial games have with FPS limits is that they lock entire systems to the FPS, usually physics. And to be fair, decoupling those is relatively difficult if you didn't have it in mind when you started. (One method is, I believe, to simply run the physics at 30 FPS and lerp the values when you render things). It's not quite like multiplying by dt. But jeez, gamedev's have figured this stuff out for decades now."
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,bloodstainer,3,Fri Jul 17 22:44:24 2015 UTC,"You're talking about optimization, that has nothing to do with a 30 lock, 60 lock or uncapped framerate.  An unoptimized game will run bad if its unoptimized. If it runs at 30 its generally because its capped at 30 not because its just running so poorly they might as well lock it at 30. Its generally decided to do during development when looking to make it run stable at 30 for the weakest of consoles."
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,Captain_Alaska,3,Fri Jul 17 22:16:25 2015 UTC,"Well, for starters, if you are hand-creating the animations, such as for an indie game, you require double the man-hours to animate, say, a character running around the screen at 60fps than at 30fps.  There's a reason why stop motion animations are rarely, if ever, 60fps. The man hours and cost required are not worth the tangible benefit in fps."
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,morgoth95,2,Sat Jul 18 00:18:10 2015 UTC,animations have little to do with framerate. you can have a animation play at 30fps while the game runs at 60(though in some cases this might look a bit wonkey)
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,Captain_Alaska,2,Sat Jul 18 09:29:05 2015 UTC,"If all the animations were 30fps, would the game really be running 60fps?"
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,sockpuppettherapy,4,Sat Jul 18 10:59:40 2015 UTC,"The thing that surprises me is that there are a lot of people saying that this whole thing is bad because ""it's hard"".   I'm sorry.  Many SNES games were fucking 60 FPS for fuck's sakes.  It's really not an excuse, especially when you're talking about maximizing the quality and fidelity of your game."
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,Greco412,4,Fri Jul 17 23:23:48 2015 UTC,"You know what this reminds me of? The ""Walking Simulator"" tag that was applied to games like The Stanley Parable and Gone Home and ""Games"" like Dear Ester. People were throwing hissy fits because games they liked were being given tags that while not inherently negative may deter people who simply weren't looking for an experience where the primary interaction is walking around."
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,envstat,2,Sat Jul 18 01:03:51 2015 UTC,I love good walking simulators and find it an apt and useful description for the games. Reminded me I still need to try Vanishing of Ethan Carter now.
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,Tarvis_,2,Sat Jul 18 12:21:10 2015 UTC,That get's a bit more subjective in my opinion. I can see a reasonable argument for that tag being banned.
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,Skylight90,10,Sat Jul 18 02:16:25 2015 UTC,"Well I can still see it on the Guild of Dungeoneering page when I'm logged out. Did they bring it back or what?  Edit: I see they brought it back because, to quote the dev, they have been spammed/threatened/warned/etc. Quite a choice of words."
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,Twilightdusk,13,Fri Jul 17 21:30:48 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, they didn't know or understand what the point of the curator was, figured ""This isn't an actual recommendation, so it doesn't belong here,"" and blocked the curator. After that they got accused of censorship on their forums and have since restored the review, professing their ignorance. TB himself responded to the specific outcry of ""censorship!"""
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,pengalor,9,Fri Jul 17 23:00:59 2015 UTC,"I've quite frankly had it with the internets complete incapacity to forgive and forget.

Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,Thunderbeak,14,Fri Jul 17 23:48:58 2015 UTC,The dev made a decision within the law and still backed off from it. Sega abused the Youtube copyright system to take down videos which didn't feature any of their content. They haven't backed off and they never apologised.  That's why this dev should be forgiven and Sega can eat a bag of dicks.
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,pengalor,2,Sat Jul 18 01:05:07 2015 UTC,"So, 'SEGA did shitty thing and now he hates them forever'? Who does he even want to apologize? Who even made the decision? Do they even work there anymore? SEGA is a decently large company with a ton of employees and at this point it's the two sides sitting in separate corners pouting and neither is willing to compromise or 'forgive and forget'. I'm just saying, if he has his own exceptions then other people can have their own exceptions. If he's going to take issue with it then he can feel free but it feels to me like a case of 'let he who is without sin cast the first stone'."
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,Twilightdusk,2,Sat Jul 18 01:23:36 2015 UTC,"Well, isn't Sega's strike against him still counted against him until such time as they apologize and rescind the strike?"
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,xGrimReaperzZ,5,Sat Jul 18 00:25:12 2015 UTC,"I think the strike was reverted (Not by them, by youtube), all he wants/expects is an apology."
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,EvilNinjadude,2,Sat Jul 18 02:31:25 2015 UTC,"Fact is it could happen again,  and successful strikes will harm TB and the network, even if they're completely unjustified, and that'll be like someone essentially messing with your job in a number of unfortunate ways.

Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,gingerzak,4,Sat Jul 18 01:13:15 2015 UTC,"as it was mentioned before somewhere on this sub, tb should've made a list of games that run 60+ fps. then developers wouldn't block that"
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,DaklozeDuif,6,Fri Jul 17 22:54:30 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think we are being too harsh on these developers. The curator system was ment for writing helpful game reviews. ""Locked at 30 fps"" could be considered unhelpful as it doesn't say much about the game.    Of course I don't blame Totalbiscuit either for making this curator since there is no wat to TAG GAMES with some kind of 30 FPS TAG. Seriously, Steam needs to unban that damn tag."
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,Nichtmagisch,2,Sun Jul 19 15:19:07 2015 UTC,"""Locked at 30 fps"" could be considered unhelpful as it doesn't say much about the game.  Its a very useful information about a product. Depending on what type of game it is, 30 fps alone might compel me not to buy it or at least have very strong second thoughts.      Honestly, I think we are being too harsh on these developers.      Im a programmer. And no. You can't blame technical difficulties for the quality of the end product. Your customers expect a product. They will get it. If it dropped finished from a tree 2 hours ago or if you have been moving heaven and earth to get it running is irrelevant."

Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,DarkyErinyes,17,Mon Jul 20 17:32:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know why they say it's banned - because it's not. It might not show up in the first 7 entries but it clearly shows up when you view all the curators when you click ""view all"" close to the curator icons.  Obviously we do not know how Steam chooses to display those icons and clearly it should be the ones in that order:   following most subbed ( if spots left from following - max 7 )   I suppose it's not thus the intial reaction and honestly it's probably one of the most meaningful things to see if you browse for a game because it's a factual statement about the game itself and should be front and center."
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,morgoth95,12,Fri Jul 17 19:02:09 2015 UTC,maybe developers are able to remove it from the store page but not from the currator list?
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,ColdBlackCage,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:18:38 2015 UTC,I believe this is the case.

Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,L0ngp1nk,6,Fri Jul 17 20:52:57 2015 UTC,"One thing to note is that as long as you follow the curator, you will still see it. This block only affects people who aren't following the curator.  I should also note that if you go to View All Curators the 30 FPS Police still shows up in that list, just not in the thumbnail beside the game of ""recommended curators""."
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,tonybateman,4,Fri Jul 17 19:46:02 2015 UTC,Exactly. I don't see the problem. If you follow that curator you can see it. If you don't then you shouldn't have to see it. People complaining about this sound like they want to force it on everyone with no choice.
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,Alinier,4,Fri Jul 17 20:30:48 2015 UTC,"If you don't then you shouldn't have to see it.   Perhaps more than people who don't want to see it are people who don't know that such information exists, is available, and is actively being hidden by developers. We're not where we are now because it's the best theoretical way to inform consumers. We're here now because 30fps tags and forum posts are banned."
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,tonybateman,3,Fri Jul 17 20:55:59 2015 UTC,"Tags should be about what the game has in it and what it's like, not the limitations. I know most people here will disagree with that but I agree with valve on that one.   Edit: tags are for searching for things. You put something in the search and the tags are used to help find what you're looking for. No one searches for games they don't want."
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,Alinier,3,Fri Jul 17 20:58:03 2015 UTC,"not the limitations.   You're kind of putting your own spin on information here. It's what the game is capable of producing. Whether that piece of information is considered a feature, not a problem, or a limitation is up to the consumer to decide. Hell a few of the games on this curator list can be unlocked without game-breaking physics and that information might make a purchase for someone who might've otherwise refunded/passed up.    tags are for searching for things.   That's certainly one way to use them. A lot of times people come to a game's page by name alone though and looking at the tags can tell you a little bit about it without tossing a sales pitch at you."
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,Dekaku,9,Fri Jul 17 21:14:39 2015 UTC,"Isn't it way too soon to just randomly assume, that someone blocked a curator, just because it doesn't appear on one game? I for once will wait and see if more cases of this supposed ban happen, before I get my pitchfork and torch ready.  I mean there are more curators for that game than can be displayed, so it should be obvious that there are some instances where we don't get to see the 30 FPS logo. Of course you are going to see it all the time, when you're subscribed to it, because that's the point of subscribing - to see what the curator you subscribed to thinks about the game, whenever said curator has something to say about that game.  It should also be noted that 30FPS will still show up, when you click on the 'show all (8)' button."
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,2FastHaste,13,Fri Jul 17 20:16:09 2015 UTC,update: They admitted they did censored it: https://i.imgur.com/eXqtXPo.jpg
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,Tronberr,6,Fri Jul 17 22:38:10 2015 UTC,"So if the devs would rather focus on patching the game, than bother with ""Locked at 30 Frames"", why did they go out of their way to ban it?   Seems kinda counter-productive and hypocritical of them."
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,Thunderbeak,5,Fri Jul 17 23:30:55 2015 UTC,"I get that they'd rather focus on other things in their development.     Content, stability and gameplay are important for a game. It's more the fact they're saying 30fps doesn't matter - and then feel the need to ban it. What is it now? Either it matters or it doesn't.  Play Hearthstone on a decent PC and then on a tablet at 30fps and then tell me higher framerate doesn't matter with 2D games."
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,Frodolas,9,Sat Jul 18 00:57:40 2015 UTC,I think it's because the 30fps curator was the first one showing up on the store page. Honestly I'd be pretty annoyed too as a game developer if some positive reviews were being hidden by the 30fps thing.
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,Tronberr,3,Sat Jul 18 03:09:46 2015 UTC,"Oh, it absolutely does matter to 2D games!   I have a GTX 750 inside my machine and Hearthstone runs as smooth as butter, compared to my horrid Intel family graphics 4000 laptop I used to play on. The difference is there."
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,Knuffelig,3,Sat Jul 18 08:45:22 2015 UTC,"This wont end well. Or way too fast so that nobody will ever care about it, as nearly everything on the internet."
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,Aarondil,3,Fri Jul 17 20:31:52 2015 UTC,"The main argument in favor of the fact that people are taking this way too personally is that many people (like me) will still buy Guild of Dungeoneering regardless of the 30 fps lock warning and regardless of the fact that they hid the Framerate Police curator from the store page, simply because the game looks cool and they want to play it. If your game is good people will buy it, some might dislike the 30 fps lock and avoid it but it's their right and they would've probably asked for a refund if they found it annoying."
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,pengalor,3,Fri Jul 17 22:06:08 2015 UTC,Would it be possible to get a list of devs we know are disabling/blocking it? Would be nice to know who wants to block simple information that is relevant to the consumer (regardless of it being fact) in an effort to mislead or otherwise dupe consumers into buying a product they wouldn't have otherwise bought. Those are companies I don't want to support.
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,Ovaldo,12,Fri Jul 17 23:20:43 2015 UTC,"This is just sad. It's not even a big deal.   If anything, TB should have made a curator group that's for FoV sliders. I care more about FoV than I do about FPS, most new games I can't even run well because I need to upgrade my card."
Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,ControlPhreakk,11,Fri Jul 17 19:02:38 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, you can look most games up on the PC gaming wiki. They have information on whether the game has an FOV slider, framerate issues or other problems. Usually they also have fixes for them."

It's just giving the consumer information which he'd get after buying and launching the game anyway, and since we now have refunds, a person who refuses to purchase games at 30 fps still wont play the game, they'll just refund or leave a negative review. Is it about the very small amount of people who wouldn't refund? I honestly can't figure out what those guys are thinking."

Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,infinitesheeps,2,Fri Jul 17 23:41:26 2015 UTC,While it is technically technical info I think the bigger issue is that newer fans will continue with the trend of attacking devs that have a 30fps lock on them while not understanding the time the game was made and the issue's with redesigning it which are huge and wanting to be part of the group. This problem will continue due to the mob mentality of the internet and will probably boomerang back on him if it happens enough.

Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,Raykyn,2,Fri Jul 17 22:35:21 2015 UTC,"Maybe because it's easier to sort out all those games that do have a 30 fps lock, then those that don't"

I would rather it be fps infornation or something similar that just tells you what the fps of a game is. Calling it fps police and targeting 30 fps games doesn't feel like an objective way to inform that the currator group was claimed to be.

If you want to create a purely objective curator group but pick a cheek-in-tongue name for it, doesnt help its purpose either. If i develop a game and lock it to 38 fps or 43 fps, will it be on the list? My game should not be on that list and thus you can definitely not be sure that my game is 60+ fps"

Cynicalbrit,3dnir0,TheOmnisicient,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:46:22 2015 UTC,"A response to the criticism of the Framerate Police  So since its launch the Framerate Police has been criticised, some of it has been fair and objective but most has just been attacks by people who feel they have to defend 30fps for whatever reason or who just want to find ways to attack TB.   So below I will try to address some of these:  First we will start with the name and its implications or more to the point the implications people have taken due to their various cultural backgrounds, I say this as TB himself has already stated how he came up with the name and being British myself I understand what he means when he says ‘Flat footed bobby’ however to anyone who is not and is unfamiliar with both the phrase and the cultural background that goes with it I can see how they do not understand what he was going for(and if you don’t I would be very surprised if the fan art to show you was not already being made), that said that does not mean you should have just taken the name and applied your own cultural point of view to it and decided that it’s not appropriate. Now to address that point, the name is in two parts, framerate is quite clear, it tells us that the list is about the framerate of the games, nothing too much there. Police on the other hand, well that is where cultural background and views come in, for example some view the job of the police as being ‘to catch bad guys’ where as others view it as ‘to enforce the law’, now both of these have negative implications but one more so than the other, based on what I have seen many use the first example to view this, they take it to mean that this curator list is to go after ‘bad developers/bad games’ and that if a game is 30fps that is all that is needed to fall into the category . This is not the intent of the list, its intend is to show information that the game’s steam page fails to show, information that many people would like before purchasing a game, it is an example of the consumer enforcing the level of disclosure they want when the retailer (steam) and the manufacture fall short.   Now onto another point raised ‘Why are you singling out 30fps’ , now this is really something only TB could answer, after all there are plenty of other things like this that consumers would like to be disclosed pre-purchase, if FoV is fixed or changeable and what it is set at/range of settings for it, well only TB can tell you why he chose to do 30fps but just because he is only pointing out one of these things does not make the point less valid, people want this information (and given that it is now the 15th most popular curator on steam at the time of writing this I think it’s safe to say there is demand for the info) and since Steam don’t require that information to be disclosed and banned the tag the consumer must resort to other ways of getting it, this is that way.  Now one more concerned I have seen is that this list will make people assume that 30fps is automatically bad, therefore the game must be bad, now this could be a valid point if not for one thing, this is only on Steam, a PC/Mac only distribution platform and if you look back at what has been going on over the past few years with the 30vs60 issue I think you’ll find that among the people who use steam 30fps has already become associated with bad development practices, PR speak (to be polite about it) and marketing concerns overriding developers/publishers being honest about their games with the consumer. If you think this list will make 30fps look worse, do please tell me how you think it looks good in any way to a PC/Mac user currently, many of them are already of the opinion that the only reason they would accept a game to run at less than 60fps is if there rig cannot handle it a 60fps on minimum settings.  One last point I have seen is this ‘Developers should be allowed to choose what information they want displayed’, my response to that: Bullocks, take a look at every other industry there is, you will find that there are legal requirements on what information must be on a products packaging or must be disclosed to the customer pre-purchase, the only reason that these legal requirements are not fully in place for Video games are because the law is slow and written by people who currently don’t understand the subject matter. FoV is a very good example since if it is too low it can cause motion sickness, low FoV can harm a person’s health, you look at any other industry and anything that can do that has to have a mention on a products packaging (this may not be the case depending on local laws but in most of the developed world is the case). Letting Dev’s chose what information they must disclose about the game pre-purchase is effectively handing them a way around the ‘free market’ method of selecting what products should succeed and what should fail, if the consumer has this information hidden from them how can they make an informed choice ? The response I assume many would give to that is read/watch reviews, well this is where another issue comes in so we will skirt that to not derail the main point but pre-release Dev’s can set limits on what a reviewer is allowed to do, so if they say, ‘we’ll let you do a pre-release review but you can’t talk about framerate’ then either the review has to not do the review until release or do it without giving out all the information and if they refuse well someone else is likely to do it, my point, pre-release reviews can be censored by the Dev/publisher."

It lists all curators (in the small window) from left to right, top to bottom in order of followers.  When you're following TFRP, it takes it's place in the top left because it has the most followers in the ""runner-up window"".  When you unfollow it, it becomes removed from the list and is replaced by the lowest follower curator taking its place in the bottom right.  Why is this curator being singled out for removal?  My assumption would be because either the system itself has flagged the curator as ""undesirable"" globally, or the owner of the product has opted to preferentially not show that particular curator in the window.  Lets face it, most people will only glance at the window and not explore the list for curators which ""should"" be there."

The fact of the matter is that a group named 30 fps ""POLICE"", while funny and a total joke as a title, it can cause some PR headache for developers, and that might be unwanted by them as they will need a small amount of working hours to deal with it, especially the indies, that are basing their sales on PR and need to clear that the gameplay is not affected by framerate (as happened by the devs of guild of dungeoneering). So for the suggestion, in contrast of having a group that provides information that can be viewed in a bad way by devs, it would have been better to have something like the ""Unlocked framerate badge"" or the ""60 fps badge"" group, which provides the same information, in a different manner, and can even be wanted by the devs that made a game with unlocked or 60 fps locked games. In a sense wielding this ""badge"" will not cause any problem for the devs that are marked with it.  This way the games that are not 30 fps locked  will be ""rewarded"", while anything 30 fps will not.  Now the games with 30 fps lock may be viewed as being ""punished"", while anything else is not. That causes the current reactions from the devs.  Edit - syntax/grammar"

When's the last time your country was relied on to make a hard decision on international politics, without our backing or support...?  Assuming you're not american. If you are, disregard, because you're nothing more than a frustrated 13 year old bitching about how you hate your family because you're self centered and don't understand the real world.   Here's hoping you never have to live in a real shithole."

Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,TotesMessenger,4,Mon Jul 20 21:25:34 2015 UTC,"Follow-up:  https://twitter.com/Totalbiscuit/status/622041095975927808 - ""Long story short they essentially worked with a blackmailer and outed somebody as gay for clicks. Disgusting rag.""  Further reading on Gawker that I just read:   I would feel sorry if Gawker didn't already have a history of being absolute scum. They have never given a spec of shit about anything other than making money.  Putting the whole Hogan sex tape thing aside for a second since it's an easy example, here are some others:  What about the Gawker Stalker app from 2006 that pinpointed celebrities on map so that paparazzi could stalk them more easily? https://archive.is/mrljD  Did you know Gawker site Gizmodo was banned from CES back in 2008 for using a TV-B-Gone remote to turn off televisions on display during live presentations? After getting banned they posted an article patting themselves on the back for a well-executed ""joke"". https://archive.is/X8VTT  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJRwZMG5GQ4 Here's the video of what they did. It's fucked. Imagine spending months preparing tech and presentations for CES only to have some ""journalist"" fuck with your presentation. I would be furious and they were banned for good reason.  What about their slanderous and incorrect accusations that easyDNS was responsible for a DOS attack against Wikileaks? Followed by a straight up refusal to tweet a correction or edit their original article. http://blog.easydns.org/2010/12/03/wikileaks-takedown-fiasco-underscores-pathetic-state-of-internet-journalism/  What about the deliberate doxxing of controversial reddit user Violentacrez on Gawker site Jezebel? https://archive.is/P4lFv  What about their unpaid interns working 15 hours a week writing articles, moderating comments and doing things that should have been compensated. They proceeded to mock unpaid unpaid interns from the movie ""Black Swan"" calling them ""ungrateful"" for the privilege of fetching coffee for the movie's staff. https://archive.is/MR8Bw https://archive.is/Nb8VT  More recently, what about Kotaku's careless clickbait headline/picture combination of ""Some kickstarter games are lying about game budgets"" right above a picture of Yooka Leele. The writing has been on the wall for a while now. https://archive.is/TDqLO  Obviously not every person working at Gawker is trying to be a total shit-heap. Still, things like this really shouldn't surprise anyone. Gawker has been home to similar trash for the last decade. How can you look at a company with a history like that and go ""Sure, I'll work there - no problem.""   In Summary: If you have continued to work for Gawker or any of it's affiliates up to this point, you are probably a terrible person of some description. You are a cog in an organization that willfully harms people for a dime."
Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,Bright-Spark,9,Fri Jul 17 18:09:08 2015 UTC,This is why I have blocked Gawker and all their subsites from my browser.  The amount bullshit going on there just massively outweight the occasional pieces of remotely worthwhile content.
Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,slimthigh,47,Sat Jul 18 01:14:12 2015 UTC,Not only did they publish blackmail. The blackmailed target works for Conde-Nast a direct Gawker Media competitor.
Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,VidiotGamer,5,Sat Jul 18 15:27:29 2015 UTC,"I really don't think that was an accident or coincidence. Conde-Nast btw, owns a significant stake in reddit, another frequent target of smear campaigns by Gawker and it's subsidiaries."
Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,EraYaN,4,Sun Jul 19 13:55:28 2015 UTC,Let's just wait for criminal charges to be filed and eat all the popcorn we can.
Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,SummerSatellite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:26:32 2015 UTC,"Hadn't heard about this yet, what happened?"
Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,CABoomerSooner,3,Fri Jul 17 18:04:56 2015 UTC,"Gawker decided to assist a male porn star in blackmailing a gay CEO who has a family. Pretty sure it was a doxx, as he had not admitted to being gay. So, these so called 'progressives' outed a man in an extremely insulting way to gain clicks.   Gawker was severely in the wrong, and many of their staff are attempting to distance themselves from this. Yet there are a few who are trying to justify it. Absolutely despicable behavior"
Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,Nichtmagisch,7,Fri Jul 17 18:07:43 2015 UTC,"So, these so called 'progressives'   Don't call them that. Call them what they are: Scum.       Gawker and related shitstains on the media carpet are a greater threat to progressives in general then some conservatives.   Gawker was severely in the wrong, and many of their staff are attempting to distance themselves from this. Yet there are a few who are trying to justify it. Absolutely despicable behavior        I hope criminal charges follow. Last time I checked Blackmailing and Extortion were still crimes."
Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,Obaruler,3,Fri Jul 17 18:38:41 2015 UTC,"""Scum"" is most likely copyrighted by them on the interwebz.   Just call them out in a more factually describing way:  Narcissistic authoritarian hipsters.   When it comes to Gawker: Clickbait hell + the above."
Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,Thing124ok,3,Fri Jul 17 21:49:15 2015 UTC,I just prefer to call them in a more simple way:  Fucking douchebags.  2 words that accurately describes some people very easily.
Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,sockpuppettherapy,-5,Fri Jul 17 22:23:41 2015 UTC,Don't call them that. Call them what they are: Scum.    They're the new 21st century bullies.  Play the victim when inciting the bullying.
Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,sandgnom,2,Sat Jul 18 19:45:06 2015 UTC,If that it happened as described: What the actual fuck?
Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,acathode,3,Fri Jul 17 20:17:04 2015 UTC,"If that it happened as described   It didn't... it's actually worse.  First of all the guy outed is a CFO, not CEO - meaning that he in no way was even close to being a public figure that would warrant this sort of public shaming.  Second, the Gawker article contained a censored photo of the gay porn star's leg+dick. People trying to identify the porn star managed to find an ""HourBoy"" profile page with the same photo, but uncensored.   From there it was easy to find the gay porn star's facebook page - and it is completely packed with posts like these.   In other words, either Gawker got hoaxed, hard, or their source for this story is a raving mad conspiracy lunatic who believes Putin orchestrated 9/11 and is about to invade USA.  ... because it just wasn't enough to publish a extremely unethical article outing a complete no-one as a cheating closeted gay - in what looks to be dangerously close to helping a blackmailer - no, Gawker had to do it based on either a hoax or a raving mad lunatic with obvious mental problems."

Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,lukasrygh23,7,Sat Jul 18 18:37:23 2015 UTC,Have you got their one on clickbait headlines in science journalism?
Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,fckingmiracles,14,Mon Jul 20 21:33:54 2015 UTC,Shiat. Thanks for researching this a bit.
Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,DarbyJustice,4,Sat Jul 18 15:25:38 2015 UTC,"Well, it's how Gawker themselves described it. It's not clear that it's actually true - this is Gawker after all - but they definitely thought they were helping someone blackmail an exec at a competing firm when they wrote the article, just based on what they said in the article itself."
Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,Proxymate,2,Fri Jul 17 21:08:40 2015 UTC,"The problem with gawker is that even if they try to label themselves as ""progressives"", they are what they are: a collection of blogs. They publish so many conflicting posts that you can't really tell if there's an editorial point of view. This is why people keep calling Gawker a hypocritical piece of shit, because it's basically just bloggers tossing whatever they have to say into a big mess.  At least the founder of Gawker seems to realize that the site needs more editorial restraint (which to my surprise, there might have actually been some of to begin with). It all smells of more bullshit though, seeing as he's still defending that they hosted video footage of Hulk Hogan having sex, even after Gawker shamed everyone who dared to look at celebrity nudes. If one guy can't stay on one track, no wonder his collection of bloggers can't even get near."
Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,foundryguy,16,Fri Jul 17 22:39:30 2015 UTC,"Are they just determined to run themselves into the ground? I honestly feel bad for some of their affiliate sites, no one should want to be near these people."
Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,459pm,5,Sat Jul 18 00:48:14 2015 UTC,"So, these so called 'progressives'   This is exactly what progressives do. This isn't progressives in air quotes, it's progressives IN ALL CAPS."
Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,The_BT,7,Fri Jul 17 23:35:32 2015 UTC,This is exactly what progressives do.   You have no idea what the fuck you are talking about.
Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,SgtPeterson,11,Sat Jul 18 06:39:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm curious too..."
Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,Nichtmagisch,9,Fri Jul 17 18:05:47 2015 UTC,"I never had a high opinion of Gawker after the Hulk Hogan thing and pretty much most things that end up on Jezebel nowadays, but this is a new low, even for them.      PS: If you work at Kotaku and have sense of Morality left, get out."
Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,loliger_rofler,8,Fri Jul 17 18:47:58 2015 UTC,"PS: If you work at Kotaku and have sense of Morality left, get out   The main problem would be that these blogs are for assholes, by assholes and they already struggle to hire people with actual talent. It's pretty difficult to believe a MORE respectable publication would want you after working there in any capacity other than janitor."

Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,Sherool,12,Mon Jul 20 01:51:00 2015 UTC,"I though we didn't believe in the whole ""guilt by association"" thing. The celebrity gossip blogs are going to post any sleazy stuff they can dig up, that doesn't necessarily reflect on a technology blog just because they share parent company (they got plenty of issues of their own though).  Focus on what the individual people do, I mean should TB consider leaving Polaris (owned by Disney) because someone over at ESPN (also owned by Disney) disrespected gamers and esport?"
Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,Nichtmagisch,8,Fri Jul 17 20:42:48 2015 UTC,Normally I would agree to this. But I don't think I know a single Gawker owned website that isn't guilty of something like this.
Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,foundryguy,5,Fri Jul 17 20:57:22 2015 UTC,"Bingo. Kotaku has done shit, Jezebel is femnazi haven, even Wired got screwed by them, and Wired was a legitimately cool magazine for a while."
Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,e7RdkjQVzw,12,Sat Jul 18 02:19:18 2015 UTC,"I mean should TB consider leaving Polaris (owned by Disney) because someone over at ESPN (also owned by Disney) disrespected gamers and esport?   The deciding factor here is control over content. In that hypothetical situation, if that guy in ESPN has any control over TB's creative process then he definitely should consider leaving, yeah.   People are suggesting talent leave Gawker associated publications because they think those publications are rotten to the top."
Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,SnapLackOfTraction,4,Fri Jul 17 22:31:22 2015 UTC,"I really hope that Gawker burn to the ground. It is so sad that one of my favorite sites is also part of this network, so I hope somehow they get separated.   Jalopnik is kind of a heaven for car guys that don't conform to certain brands, love odd cars and generally has one of the best communities on the Internet. The writers are also incredibly cool and you can read some of the best things when it comes to cars on the Internet. io9 is also pretty great. Everything else, with the exception of a Jezabel subblog(kitchenette) can go die in horrible fires."
Cynicalbrit,3dndyj,Ekaros,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:06:03 2015 UTC,They have had months to abandon a sinking ship. I don't feel sorry for them after stuff they have pulled... Staying for this long means that you either not strongly disagree or are indifferent about publication and it's policies you work for.

Not the blackmail, but outting them.  Doing this to the CEO of a business, or really any other private citizen, is unacceptable.  Edit: I would make the small amendment that if the CEO was particularly active, vocal, and visible in the anti-gay political movement, it may become more acceptable to out them as they've now become a political/public figure. Never blackmail though, that's never acceptable."
