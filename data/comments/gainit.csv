Unless you go to a gym full of assholes no one is gonna bat an eyelid if you get chalk out.   If you don't like making a mess and being obvious with a block of chalk try liquid chalk.

gainit,3e28sz,Analtoast,0,Tue Jul 21 13:09:48 2015 UTC,get liquid chalk seriously. It's been a lifesaver for me. Also 315 used to kill my grip even with the chalk and now it's no big deal even without chalk. I haven't done any grip/forearm training really either.
gainit,3e28sz,jurornumbereight,3,Tue Jul 21 21:32:31 2015 UTC,Don't worry about it bro. When I started out my grip would give out on 245 lbs. Now I can rep 295 with no grip problems (and even do 315 with alternate grip).   You'll get stronger.

gainit,3e28sz,jaju123,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:00:04 2015 UTC,"The way I improved my grip strength was half deads in the smith rack, I would concentrate holding it at the top until it felt like it was going to slip out then set it down. Also, I bought some foam from home depot and use it to wrap around the bar so I can do bench, curls and other exercises with a really tough to grip bar so it strengthens my forearms.  As for your self consciousness about chalk, I'd suggest getting liquid chalk, I am not sure what brands I have used, but I just searched amazon and this came up.  http://www.amazon.com/Products-2-Ounce-Ultimate-Gripping-Solution/dp/B002ZAKOJK/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&qid=1437494634&sr=8-12&keywords=liquid+chalk  That way you can improve your grip and not worry about going all LeBron in the gym."

Hold them down by your side, and go for a walk around the block and try your hardest to not put them down.  Also adding forearm curls here. They are pretty self-explanatory.   How do you warm up for your 110kg DL  40kg x 10 60 x 8 80 x 5 90 x 3 100 x 2 110 x 1 115 x 1 120 x ??  Try mixed grip or hook grip as well, but only mixed after double over has started to fatigue."

gainit,3e28sz,elektrolytz,2,Tue Jul 21 21:35:57 2015 UTC,"There are a number of ways to increase your grip strength depending on budget.   You can get Champions of Crush (start at the Trainer level or lower) off of Amazon for about $25. Anticipate using them daily for reps for about two months before you are ready for the next level up. These are nice because you can use them anywhere, at the office, in the car, at home, etc. You don't need to take them to the gym and they will improve your grip if you use them daily. Also be sure to watch the videos for the correct way to use them to get the most out of them.  If you want to add to your lifting grip strength while you are lifting, get a pair of FatGripz. They are about $35 for a pair. You just slide them on the dumbell/barbell you are using and then complete the set as you normally would. They work by increasing the diameter of the bar and thus making your grip work extra hard on each lift. The difference is notable in both grip growth and forearm work for every lift. Be sure not to let them out of your sight and to put your name in permanent marker on them if you get a set as they are easy to walk away with if someone were nefarious.   As mentioned, straps, versa grips and RDX hooks will allow you to train Deadlift while taking away the grip issue. You should not use these for low weights but if it is your grip that is holding you back, by all means use it at the weight you need it at. At the same time train your grip and they will catch up to one another.   Don't be embarrassed about using equipment to assist you in great form. Do be embarrassed if you can't hold the lift and have shitty form."

gainit,3e2pqs,areallytallguy,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:45:23 2015 UTC,The whole low rep for strength high for size has pretty much been completely debunked. All long as you're exerting the same amount of energy and tension on the muscles you'll get both gains in size and strength. http://www.strengtheory.com/the-new-approach-to-training-volume/
gainit,3e2pqs,vierce,0,Tue Jul 21 21:18:43 2015 UTC,Not true.   You're saying lifting 10 lbs for 25 reps will give you the same results as lifting 45 lbs for 5 reps?   Try lifting low weight high reps for a year and then see if you can progress in weight as much as someone who lifts heavy. You can't.   Directly from your source:   Gains in strength and muscular endurance are still very much tied to the rep range used.
gainit,3e2pqs,areallytallguy,0,Tue Jul 21 21:23:54 2015 UTC,"That's not what I'm saying at all. no duh you're not going to make any progress on super light weights. It says that in the article. But heavy weights at higher reps vs even heavier weights at lower reps should give you similar results, provided you're utilizing the entire muscle fibers during the lift.  I'm not talking about doing 5 pounds for 100 reps here.   I just get tired of all these posts recently saying that you have to do higher rep stuff to gain size and ""aesthetics"" when that's completely untrue."

After all my sets are done, I cross it off the list. After my workout, I update the exercises in the list with the weight I'll lift the next workout.  I personally take it a step further and, rather than having an app that tracks progression automatically, manually enter my lifts after my workout is finished into an excel spreadsheet. This step really doesn't take long though and is optional.

I'm working on an app that helps to make workout tracking (especially for bodybuilders and powerlifters) simple and intuitive. It won't have any fancy features, just a dead simple way to input exercises, and a way to view the previous times you did that same exercise. I've been using it myself for the last couple weeks and it's simple enough that you can track what you've done while you're resting.

If you select ""Exercises"" you can select individual exercises from the rather dire ""guy with no skin"" interface and log from there -- it's weird, roundabout, and counterintuitive, but you can do it.  Also not sure where text strings are being truncated.  But in general the JeFit UI is old-fashioned (even the ""new update"") and pretty rubbish, but I'm used to it at this point.  I'd be interested in seeing an alternative, but every one I've taken a look at is missing features that I love in JeFit such as log information displayed on the individual exercise page, graphs of progress over time, calced 1RM and what I need to do to beat my current 1RM, sync with multiple devices including web interface, etc."

This was such a shock even a Google search confirmed this feature is not available. Why not allow even a basic search for a routine (eg Arnold, PHAT, 531)?  I find big lifts 2 to be the most intuitive for major lifting routines such as a 531 and it will even allow additional accessory work exercises to be added into your routine.  No application is perfect, but the interface of JeFit is so busy you'd thing you were browsing bodybuilding.com without Adblock enabled.

Maybe get to the gym twice per week to do heavy compounds.  I say this because, as a super skinny person -- I started out at 5'10 and 145 pounds -- I can tell you that you won't look ""fit"" instead of ""big"" unless you put on some muscle.  You will just look scrawny.  Edit:  I should note that I'm not trying to say bodyweight fitness is useless.  It dramatically improved my ability to lift because I was more aware of my positioning in lifting.  It was a great way for me to transition from a totally sedentary lifestyle to lifting.

Also your back and bicep day is on thursday and you are doing pull ups on friday (which primarily targets back and biceps).  Finally maybe just a bit more volume all around, the sets are quite low and the amount of exercises, with a hypertrophy rest time your workouts will likely be 25 minutes at most.

gainit,3e2g9w,spitefulmilkshake,4,Tue Jul 21 13:11:40 2015 UTC,"You're thinking about it wrong.  You have to eat at a surplus to bulk and you can't pick what body parts you want to bulk.  Yes, you can put more training volume into certain muscles, but in terms of fat gain your body will place it wherever your DNA tells it to.  So at best, with your plan, you'd get bigger upper body muscles, gain some fat all over (especially if you tend to put it on your ass/legs easily), and degrade the progress you've made on your legs.    A good program that you'd find in the wiki will balance training volume between the upper and lower body, because that's important for your overall fitness and preventing injuries later.  If you really insist on putting more emphasis on the upper body vs. legs, just look up a bro split."

When I go heavy I rest at least 3 min. For top sets sometimes a little over 5min.    You're stats are way too low to consider a switch to PHAT. Everyone believes PHAT will give you the best gains ever. While it is probably a great program for bodybuilding I would never suggest it to people who don't have a 2 plate bench, 3 plate squat and 4 plate DL. It's simply very hard on the joints and will destroy your CNS if you're not well trained already and have experience.    I recommend switching to another full body routine since you already seem to dislike ICF. Reason being that the mental factor is important as well. When you constantly think about how you hate that program you can't dedicate yourself enough to a workout.    I'd switch to Fierce 5 Novice: http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=159678631    Or Babylover's SS: http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=135564721    Milk out dem linear gainz first then you can go and do da splits. Work on mobility too!! That is the most important thing I can tell anyone that's weightlifting. When you have fuqed up joints like me you'll have a hard time enjoying life and lifting."

As a fellow tall guy (you have an inch on me), you'll definitely have to put some extra effort into your chest and, specifically if you care about strength, your bench press.  The dynamics of long bodies make benching tougher, at least in the sense of hitting your pecs.  On the other hand, you'll certainly start to see that DL shoot up!  If you're looking for a change, might I suggest moving to a 3x5 or 5x5 program to bring your numbers up?  I'm not saying stick to SS or ICF, but incorporating a 3x5 into a higher volume program like PHUL would definitely push you passed some plateaus.  You've definitely made good gains but at the 8-12 rep range with your current routine your body hasn't had any exposure to true strength training."

gainit,3dxvg9,Skinnymotherfucker,8,Mon Jul 20 12:53:09 2015 UTC,Are you trying to just get bigger muscles? The key is volume and progressive overload. Your arms are often not targeted directly in fully body routines in sufficient volume to grow as much as someone who brosplits.  Based on that routine you mentioned I can see why you're potentially not getting as much hypertrophy as he is.   Are you gaining weight? Is he? How much?  edit - 15lb in 3 months is roughly about right. Is he gaining more weight? Or just more size? If you're both scrawny to start with then he could easily be packing on fat as well as muscle and he still looks lean but he looks bigger because of it.
gainit,3dxvg9,F4nboy,3,Mon Jul 20 13:23:17 2015 UTC,"Yes I started lifting purely for aesthetics, but strength gains as a side effect is pretty sweet too.  I'm following version 2 of the mentioned routine so I have direct arm work at the end of every workout, but from the results it doesn't seem to be sufficient.  Both of us have definitely put on weight, in fact, when I asked him the other day he said he was 133lbs, which is 1lb heavier than me, he looks relatively lean, but man his arms..  So what do you think? Should I move on from the beginner routine to an upper/lower split? Or just try out a bro split for a change?"
gainit,3dxvg9,F4nboy,5,Mon Jul 20 13:38:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly it is all about what works for you. There are so many factors that could mean his arms are bigger, I would wager that high volume direct arm work is part of it.  If you want pure aesthetics, just go do a high volume brosplit.   You say you've been working out for 3 months? If you've been consistent then great! If I was you right now, I'd move to a PPL with some volume on it for another 12 weeks and measure your growth over that period.  Although, ultimately, you might end up suffering from fuckerarounditis if you're not careful. You need to pick something and work hard at it for a while, ignoring other's progress as long as YOU are making progress.   I was working out 3 times a week for a while and my wife mentioned my flagging arms so I decided to start working out 4 times a week and just add in a dedicated arm volume workout on that extra day. Seems to be working really well."
gainit,3dxvg9,F4nboy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:49:28 2015 UTC,"Yup I think it's safe to say that I was consistent, I have yet to miss a single workout.  The additional day for direct arm work thing you mentioned was exactly what crossed my mind, I'll try continuing with my current routine and adding a direct arm workout, and if that still doesn't help I'm probably going to move onto an upper/split or bro-split, thanks!"
gainit,3dxvg9,Tux_the_Penguin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:16:26 2015 UTC,No problem.  There is no harm adding in an additional workout as long as you account for it with your calorie intake and that you recover properly. As a newbie you recover really fast so take advantage of it.
gainit,3dxvg9,8u11etpr00f,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:30:56 2015 UTC,"You've got a long time to go. But arms might just be slow growers for you.   I started out at 5'10 135 a little under 2 years ago. Since then I've put on 40 lbs up to 175, but after a cut I'm down to about 168. I still think my arms look tiny, but they're 14 inches which isn't small. My younger brother is 5'8 and his arms are 14 inches and they look big.   The problem is my arms are really long, so they look a lot smaller than they are. The same could be for you, and your friend could have short arms that show off his gains better.   That said, if you're moving up in weight on rows, pull ups (moving up in reps here), bench press, and shoulder press, then you're putting on size in your arms. So don't worry and keep on trucking."

gainit,3dxvg9,F4nboy,2,Tue Jul 21 05:20:16 2015 UTC,so I have direct arm work at the end of every workout   6 sets of arms a fortnight is nowhere near enough to gain any serious size imo. Maybe add a couple more sets onto each arm exercise but even then that is kinda light in terms of volume.

gainit,3dxvg9,Tofinochris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:51:54 2015 UTC,volume and progressive overload.   Forgive my ignorance but progressive overload is the act of lifting more weight over time in order to get stronger and bigger. For instance SL has you increase each compound lift by 2.5kg every workout day.  So I assume this is not the same for aesthetics workouts? You only lift heavy weights once your current weights become to light because you're not aiming for strength.
gainit,3dxvg9,AndrewCrimzen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:12:01 2015 UTC,"You're pretty much correct about progressive overload. Except that it is the same principle for hypertrophy as for strength. You always need progressive overload to improve in any fitness area.   Progressive overload isn't always adding more weight to the bar. It can be reducing rest times, increasing (or decreasing) bar speed, doing more reps etc.  The difference between strength and hypertrophy gains is mostly to do with rep ranges (or rather total volume)/time under tension and % of 1RM for each set.  So if you're adding 2.5kg to the bar and doing 5x5 each time then you will be able to lift closer to you 1RM than if you're doing 3x12, but you'll (normally) spend less TUT and you would normally have lower volume."
gainit,3dxvg9,AndrewCrimzen,4,Tue Jul 21 13:00:20 2015 UTC,"TLDR: You're overthinking this.  First of all, you're comparing progress based on his bicep size.  This is the most Bro way of comparing physique and strength.  It's completely ridiculous, but if it means a lot to you, add chins to a day or two of your program, or add curls if you must.  So many things could be affecting his arm size compared to yours.  Diet.  Muscle insertions (""genetics"").  His program including curls every workout at the expense of more useful lifts.  Again, if you value biceps that much, add some chins or curls to your existing program as accessories but stay with the starter, full-body program.    After saying all this, if the goal of your training really is to have bigger biceps than this one friend of yours, knock yourself out and change to his brosplit, but I'm willing to get that's not what your goal is."
gainit,3dxvg9,broscientologist,2,Mon Jul 20 17:38:07 2015 UTC,"You're right, my goal isn't to have a bigger biceps than this friend, I don't want to be the guy who does arms every other day and have huge arms but a small body, nor do I want to be the next poster boy for ""don't skip leg day"", I'm training to get my entire body bigger.  But as I said it the post, it's just a little demotivating too see sometimes, after all, it's the guy who has the bigger arms who gets attention, not the guy with the bigger legs, but I see your point, and at this point I'm gonna just keep pushing through"

If you're in good shape, you get attention.  And incidentally, there was a thread months ago asking women what they looked for (physically) in guys and the near-universal answer from women was ""not biceps, stop going to the gym and just doing curls you lunks"".  The general ""v-shape"" that you get when you're in good shape was top of the list -- you get this by general working out and especially from lats, but nobody's ever been called a ""rowbro"".  Butts were on there as well which I don't get but whatever makes women smile I guess, so keep squatting."

Work with lighter weight and work on you form a lot while slowly adding weight. You don't need huge numbers to gain size. It'll come with good form then added progression. Make sure you are going to an appropriate depth at least parallel and that you aren't falling forward or having your knees bend in. Try doing a squat that you think is perfect form without any weight at all then add the bar and do the same. If all is well add a little bit of weight till you are no longer achieving optimal form. Once you have a good foundation then you're set just keep with the progression and suck up your pride.

I first squatted the bar with no weights and I was so weak my legs were torn up for three days.  I was stumbling around like an idiot at work trying to go down the stairs in the parking garage.  After that first attempt at squatting I used the next workout to focus on form still with the bar. Now 8 weeks later I'm squatting about 160. It's not a lot but the progress is steady and I'm seeing results. My legs recover very fast now as well.  I almost fell over the third workout with 80 pounds but fuck it.

Start at a light weight. Really light. No, lighter. Sacrifice your ego to make sure your form is on point. Slowly add the weight, but focus more on killing the reps, as this will help with growth.

I'd rather have a carb like that than something like bread or pasta (something more ""processed"").   Chicken breast, lean beef on occasion, eggs, whole milk are good protein sources.   Avocado, coconut oil, olive oil make for good fats.   I know it's tempting to cut corners and dirty bulk, but do your best not to. There's more to health than weight gain/loss. You're 19, you're likely forming eating habits without realizing it that will color your relationship with food for a long time. Bulking dirty isn't awful, but there's no real reason to other than cravings. Plus a cleaner bulk will make for an easier cut."

Watch the appropriate TY videos, go to gym, put weight on bar, start video recorder, pick it up, put it down, watch video and make notes.

Month-long cuts and bulks will leave you wondering why you didn't make any progress after a year.  If you decide to bulk, get into it for a few months and accept some fat gain.  If you cut, don't be like me 1 year ago and give up on it when you start feeling weak and aren't at sub-10% BF overnight.    This is solely me putting my brain in your body, but I would cut until I had a resting 6 pack and then do a slow, controlled bulk for a very long period of time.  Only saying that because that's what I'm doing.  I absolutely have more room to put muscle on my frame, but I want to start from a leaner foundation so I can get shredded again quickly if I ever want to down the line.

gainit,3dzo04,8u11etpr00f,2,Mon Jul 20 21:10:38 2015 UTC,My opinion is because you are constantly cutting/bulking and worrying too much about the little things instead if focusing on the big picture.  We've had this discussion before.
gainit,3dzo04,Lognogs,-1,Mon Jul 20 21:13:25 2015 UTC,Those 1rm's on the squat and deadlift are quite impressive for someone of your weight/training time. If your 1rm's are so high but you are still self conscious about your size maybe you should mix in some hypertrophy work ( I assume you're on a strength program).

I would do a controlled cut (no aggressive, Keto bullshit) down to about 11-12% body fat and then start bulking again. Losing the fat will give the illusion of more muscle mass. Then when you hit that 11-12% body fat start bulking again, I can't gather from the text your training volume or attention to detail but I would definitely count calories to stay lean-ish on the bulk and train at least 3 times a week. Calories without enough training will just make you gain fat :/"

Also if you only want to gain weight, and no muscle (meaning you probably won't look as great) then don't go to the gym. If you want to gain muscle, hit the gym or at least do bodyweight at home. I recommend this. It generally isn't as effective as actually going to the gym, but it's much better than doing nothing. If you don't plan on trying to gain muscle, you should be able to gain weight by eating pretty much anything.

It wasn't really what I ate, I simply ate a lot and I tried to eat healthy. ThisIsATalkingPotato's advice is pretty solid regarding metabolism and exercise suggestions.  Breaking wasn't really required and it's just a hobby. Bboying, especially footwork is super tiring and to be honest, I only practiced breaking 1 time (45 minutes) a week. Honestly, if you are really really into breaking, it can make you less motivated to go to the gym. Put your mind on one goal at a time, and you will be truly productive :)"

Of course, all this assume diet, sleep, and mobility (I like to include this in recovery staples for injury prevention) are on point."

gainit,3dzbvm,LukeatanPeninsula,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:27:51 2015 UTC,I use my fitness pal and track calories by the day and by the week.  ~3200 for instance could be anything between 3000 and 3500 but at the end of the week it would all average out to 20300 (2500x3+3200x4)
gainit,3dzbvm,JimNaysium,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:30:13 2015 UTC,"Problem is your ""estimated"" TDEE is 18900, so you're only +1400 for the week."

gainit,3dzbvm,WockItOut,3,Mon Jul 20 19:46:37 2015 UTC,"For starers, I'd eat the same everyday, which for you would be about 3000 daily. I'd try that for 2 weeks, if nothing changes then bump it up +250 and go from there. Why, because it's easier to ack and your body needs those cal to help with recovery.   The bottom line here is if you aren't gaining weight, then you need to eat more. No need to over complicate it."
gainit,3dzbvm,kingmode_,2,Mon Jul 20 19:56:10 2015 UTC,"Okay, then you're not counting something correctly because the weekly total is definitely the one that matters most.  Are you just estimating what you had for the day and putting one number in at the end of the day?  If so, that's where the issue lies.      Not trying to be a douche but undereating is literally the only possible explanation for what you're experiencing, so there's definitely something missing.  I totally agree that pulling out your phone and going into MyFitnessPal after every bite is overkill, but if you can do it that way for even a few days you'll get into a rhythm of knowing how much to eat daily.  Once you get 3200 in a day out of foods you enjoy, just eat the same things all the time."
gainit,3dzbvm,WockItOut,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:44:32 2015 UTC,"What I usually do is comp in my meals before I eat them, so I might use MFP 3-4 times a day.  I use the product nutritional label as often as I can and only estimate quantities if I have no other choice (which is pretty rare since I prepare most of my food)."
gainit,3dzbvm,kingmode_,2,Mon Jul 20 19:49:26 2015 UTC,"I disagree with what the other guy said, your problem is not overestimating your calories. Your problem is simply not enough calories. I'm maintaining 150 lbs right now with 3000 cals a day, every day. Not surprised you aren't gaining weight when you weigh 158 and eat less than 3k cals on some days."

If I were you I'd go for 2700-2800 calories on all days with 158 Protein with 80 Fat and the rest filled with carbs. And 8 weeks is really not that long of a time.

gainit,3duza6,yungwerther,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:48:48 2015 UTC,"this seems to be a pretty common thing when bulking. it happened to me too, my body looks pretty much the exact same. From what I've seen others say, you might just have to accept the extra fat you put on while trying to gain muscle in the gym. Then when you cut, the fat will disappear and the muscle will (mostly) stay - especially if you keep hitting the gym to minimize muscle loss. if you're eating at a +500 calorie surplus, maybe try just +300 so you can still gain but try to minimize the gut  Personally, I'm just having trouble figuring out the optimal time to start a cut. I don't want to start too soon before I've made any real muscle gain because then I'll just be back to where I've started. but I also don't want to wait too long or else my stomach will just keep getting bigger"
gainit,3duza6,yungwerther,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:18:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input. It might be cause I gained a lot of weight in a short time instead of spreading it out. Like I gained 10-15 in a 2 month period, and didn't gain for about a year, before I gained another 15 lbs in about 2-3 months. I'm about to reach my peak weight I can get to with 3000 calories, when I get there I'll just maintain and try ot gain muscle while losing a bit of fat.   How much weight have you gained? I feel like I should be at least 170 before I cut, because I'm still on the skinnier side for 5' 9"
gainit,3duza6,SmallToSwole,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:29:23 2015 UTC,"It might be cause I gained a lot of weight in a short time instead of spreading it out   I did the same thing when I started in January. I started at about 130 and in the first two months I think I was up to 145 (I'm 5'6). After the bloating though I got a bit self-conscious so I lowered my calories, and I've been at 140 for a while now. Might have to up them again because I haven't been gaining at all, but I'll do it more slowly this time.  As for whether you should hit 170 before cutting I'm not sure, since I don't know what the ""ideal"" weight is based on height - which is something I want to figure out for myself, too. I guess it just depends on your comfort level with your body as it currently stands"

gainit,3dw6o3,dssssd,4,Mon Jul 20 02:20:14 2015 UTC,"A better alternative than that: Subway. Seriously,  it's what got me back into gains and showed me how easy it actually is.

Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches can be very high calorie if you put lots of PB on.  Gainer shakes are good too. I have Optimum Nutrition's serious mass.

I don't know if I'm gaining weight as I don't have a scale (but I am getting stronger slowly) but I enjoy the lifts so I keep at it.  I don't go up 5 pounds a session, usually add 10 pounds after every 2 weeks.  Here it is:  Monday:  6-7 back exercises (5x5 barbell row included) with 3 exercises of 2x20 light weight inbetween 3-4 exercises heavy weight and Squats 5x5.  Tuesday: Core  Wesndesday: 6-7 shoulder exercises (barbell press included, but I keep it relatively light after developing some lower back pain) and 6-7 chest exercises with the same idea as with back, and Squats 5x5  Thursday:Arms for reps, going in between 4x12 for heavy weight and 2x20 for light weights for both triceps and biceps.  I then do forearms to failure, and some core.  Friday: All legs, 5x5 Squats, 5x2 sumo deadlift, 4x8 leg press, 1x1 deadlift heavy.  These followed by leg isolations, if time permits (gym closes early Friday nights), such as calf raises, hamstring curls, etc...   Saturday:All upper body.  All the SL lifts plus the same things I do on Mondays/Wednesdays.  This takes me a few hours but I enjoy it.  Sunday: Whatever I want, sometimes I do core and then swim until exhaustion (400 IMs), sometimes I do the stationary bike for 6-7 miles (try to go as hard as I can for 20 minutes), some core and then the treadmill at walking speed on the highest inclination for half an hour, sometimes I just go to the park and play football (soccer).  Sometimes I just take a break, sleep in, eat well and go to bed early.  Depends.  Try something like my routine, it might help."

I thought I was He-Man until I got close to the failing point (and then the next week actually failed).   If you are still adding 5lbs each week (or each lift) then go nuts. If you are on a plateau that's when the rest really matters. When you push your body to the limit it takes around 48-72 hours to get enough rest to be able to push it to the limit again. Unless you are pushing AAS, it is going to take that long to get back into the condition where you will have a shot at gaining while also not getting injured."

gainit,3dts7l,sknick_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:28:29 2015 UTC,"Ever tried taking Magnesium?  It is supposed to help regulate/reduce cortisol levels.  Cortisol is catabolic.  You might try taking 250mg in the morning & at night & see if it helps any.  Costs like $5 for a bottle.  http://www.mensjournal.com/health-fitness/health/magnesium-the-missing-mineral-20140117   Magnesium helps regulate cortisol (too much can lead to anxiety), melatonin (essential for sleep), and blood pressure, and provides the energy to contract and relax the heart and other muscles. Low magnesium levels can lead to symptoms like exhaustion, irritation, and sleeplessness. ""If you feel fatigued or irritable, or you're having muscle twitches or weakness, those are all symptoms of possible low magnesium,"" says Dr. Gregg C. Fonarow, a professor of cardiovascular medicine at UCLA's medical school. Goodman recommends everyone get tested with a simple red blood cell magnesium test that can be added to a routine blood test by your primary doctor.   http://www.sott.net/article/276505-8-Ways-in-which-Magnesium-rescues-hormones   8 ways that Magnesium Rescues your Hormonal System   1) Magnesium regulates cortisol. Magnesium calms your nervous system and prevents excessive cortisol. Your stress hormonal system (called HPA, or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) is your central hormonal system. When it is better regulated, then your other hormonal axes - thyroid and sex hormones - will function better.   2) Magnesium lowers blood sugar. Magnesium is so effective at sensitizing the insulin receptor that I refer to it as our 'natural metformin'. Better insulin control means fewer sugar cravings. Healthy insulin sensitivity is important for weight loss and PCOS, and it also prevents osteoporosis.   3) Magnesium supports thyroid. Magnesium is essential for the production of thyroid hormone. It is also anti-inflammatory, which helps to quiet the autoimmune inflammation that underlies most cases of thyroid disease. (Other ways to address thyroid autoimmunity include gluten-elimination and a selenium supplement.)   4) Magnesium aids sleep. As I've written here before, magnesium is the great sleep-promoter, and sleep is crucial for hormone production. Sleep is when we should have a surge in anabolic hormones like DHEA and growth hormone.   5) Magnesium fuels cellular energy. Magnesium is so intricately involved with glycolysis and the Krebs cycle (ATP energy production), that we can safely say: ""There is no cellular energy without magnesium."" Glandular tissue like thyroid, ovaries and testes is metabolically very active, so requires even more cellular energy and more magnesium than other tissue.   6) Magnesium makes hormones. Magnesium is involved in the manufacture of steroid hormones such as progesterone, estrogen and testosterone. Magnesium has been shown to reduce hot flashes by 50%.   7) Magnesium activates vitamin D. Without enough magnesium, vitamin D cannot do its job . Conversely, too much vitamin D supplementation can cause magnesium deficiency.   8) Magnesium is anti-aging. The mineral has been shown to prevent telomere shortening, reduce oxidative stress, and enhance the production of glutathione.    But yeah you also need to make sure your weight is going up by at least a 1/2 lb per week"

For that matter track your calories, at your stats it's clear you overestimate food intake.  Also switch to core lifts and a standard program until you're more developed.  More developed meaning more than 160lbs"

Squats without any weight, deadlifts with dumbbells that are 30 pounds each, and I bench with 50 lbs plus the bar. He doesn't really have anymore weights so I've just been adding 5 more reps in each time. Also, I do curls with dumbbells and 3x30 incline sit ups with 10 lbs. It's not a regular workout but it seems like the only option with his equipment.

You should attempt to gain a pound a week for 30 weeks as a start.  If you don't have a scale, get one... It's the only way to tell if you are eating enough long term.  Your buddy's gym is a start, if that's all you have access to.  Presses don't really work core, but you shouldn't focus on core as much as you seem to think.  Once you can do 20 reps of something it's time to up the weight.  If you can't up the weight you've outgrown that gym.    with basic equipment you'll want to do some sort of bench, squat/Deadlift picking stuff up off the ground, bent over rows or flys, pullups, overhead press if you want..."

gainit,3dtgo0,Thrusticus,3,Sun Jul 19 08:02:23 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Finally fixed my jacked up bench grip, and put 30lbs on my lift in one day.  I have disproportionately long arms, and while this makes deadlifting very much fun for me, my bench has always suffered. I usually grip with my little fingers roughly two inches in from the smooth ring on the knurling, as that was what I was advised when I first started. On a whim, I checked what the maximum legal IPF grip width was, in hopes of increasing my leverage for the lift (While I don't really have any aspirations in competitive powerlifting, I like to hold my training to a competition standard.) I adjusted, loaded my 5rm (125), and threw it off my chest into lockout. Felt really good, so I threw one plate on each side, and locked that out too. I was all kinds of ramped up at that point, so I put a little over my bodyweight (155) on the bar, and nailed it. After three months of serious lifting, I've still got a shit-tier, destitute, impoverished bench - but it's one I'm super happy about right now."

gainit,3dq9rv,Shawarma123,22,Sat Jul 18 20:24:23 2015 UTC,"I am a new lifter and a bit weak but I'm doing greyskull lp gradually building up from just the bar to adding a bit of weight.   On Thursday the LA Fitness I just signed up for called me and tricked me into scheduling a complimentary personal trainer session. I hate the idea of paying for pts but since it was free I went in.   Guy was sleazy from the start. Immediately told me my workout was bad and ignored my goals. Said I needed to do a bro split and we were gonna do ""chest day"" today. He had me do as many pushups as I could then hold my longest plank, tiring me out already. Then he had me do bench press 5x10 and pushups between sets for muscle confusion. By the 3rd set I couldn't even push the bar up but he made me do it despite my form completely failing. After that he made me use Smith machine to do 5x10 incline pushing with planks between each set and asked if I could feel the burn. I said I felt pain in my left shoulder and he said that was my muscles getting stronger.   Finally he made me go to some machines and I was completely dead so I was unable to push them at all, looking like a fool in front of all the gym goers. He then took me to his office and tried to sell me 12 sessions for 65 dollars each. He claimed I needed it because look how tired I was and how hard he pushed me, I could not possibly do it on my own. I politely said I wasn't sure if it was in my budget and he asked me what I spend my money on and to see if we could make things work. I just told him id get back to him and left.   What a miserable experience. My confidence was almost shot if I didn't know what a bozo he was. Didn't help me at all, I hate sales men."
gainit,3dq9rv,aboose,16,Sat Jul 18 15:48:21 2015 UTC,"Bro, I too went in for the free PTS and it was brutal. They will tell you to do everything they know you can't do, that way it creates the illusion you really need them.   I wish I would have walked out like you, but I ended up signing up for their once a week PTS about a year ago. When I sat down to sign the paperwork I told them I only wanted a PT to help me for the first three months so I could correct my forms in every way. Ended up not reading what I was signing, assumed it was just legal non sense about how the trainer or LA can't get sued if you get hurt during a session.   Three months down the road I move to my new apartment where my rent is triple what it was, so I no longer have the budget or time for the PT. Went in to my new LA fitness only to realize I signed something like a year contract. I told the PT I had no idea I signed a contract and he plain as day said ""haha, yeah I hear that a lot.""   After many calls to LA corp office with no sympathy at all, I called BBB and within 24 hours an LA big wig calls me up and asks what will it take to make me happy. Cancelled that ish and got a few extra free sessions out of it.  TLDR : got suckered into signing a year contract for PTS at LA fitness. PT told me that was common. Called BBB to get it resolved."

The squat rack area was crowded and these 2 guys let me work in with them, introduced themselves, told me about their programs, etc. etc. and they even complimented my form  About a week ago, I noticed these 3 swolebros were obviously talking about me and I thought they were making fun of me. Turns out they were actually complimenting my progress. They were saying stuff like ""yeah i remember him putting just 25s on each side"" and ""yeah now he's up to 35 with some change pretty soon he'll be up to 45"" but it was kinda muffled and hard to hear at first, but I was eventually able to piece together that that's what they were saying.

I've been doing coolcicada's PPL and I really enjoy it. As long as I time myself between sets (I do 60 seconds for 5 rep lifts and 45 for anything more) I can get a workout done in about an hour.

gainit,3dq9rv,garrettruskamp,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:38:54 2015 UTC,Not sure what the question is but I would certainly be going all 6 days and following the basic template of the routine. PPL is an intermediate routine because of the demanding volume/frequency so you would have to be the judge of when you'd like to switch over. I can't say if you'd do better on it vs SL but definitely look over the thread.   http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=149807833

I seldom test 1RM  but a few weeks back I did 225/365/415 for bench/squat/dead.  I don't know my max OHP but I can do 150 x5.  I didn't get my power rack till December - so training before that was not as effective.  So maybe 7 months.  I probably could have done more or the same earlier - I just wanted to say I hit the 1000 lb club...  I also lost 4 weeks of full training from a car accident.  I was about 205 when I put those up.  You will likely need to be up around there to."

gainit,3dqytu,Mukuro-san,2,Sat Jul 18 19:51:39 2015 UTC,Here are my 3x5 lift progressions:  http://imgur.com/qaY0R7Y  I don't have time to post details right now - but I will today or tomorrow.    As a preview - mostly 3x5 on all compound exercises every other day with Starting Strength style linear progression.  Nothing magic really.  The partway I ended up going to a ABxABx split with 5/6 lifts on each day - still 3x5 for heavy compound lifts.  Also some accessories at 2 or 3x10.  I played around with some 3x10 as well - but 3x5 was 80% of my scheme for any heavy lift.
gainit,3dqytu,Ferrous_Puller,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:24:42 2015 UTC,Wow that's really impressive. If you don't mind could you post details about your workout and diet? Any tips?! :)
gainit,3dqytu,jteedog,3,Sun Jul 19 00:11:11 2015 UTC,"OP, not gonna lie. 5 months is definitely aggressive for the some progress you're looking to make. Although what's the point of a goal if it isn't?   Putting 20lbs onto your OHP shouldn't be too bad, Even at adding 5lbs to that lift every 3 weeks would get you to 135 by the holidays. Hell you could probably 1rm max this tomorrow if you wanted to.   Bench is most likely a solid goal, 65lbs over 5ish months will be challenging, especially given your height. But, you really only have to get 35-45 more to your 5rm to get add 65 on a 1rm. I've seen people make similar leaps, solid diet and super consistent routine will be key here. Don't be afraid to deload if you hit a sticking point towards 2 plates, super common in my experience.  What was your high bar squat working sets? Also just curiously why the switch? Obviously 145 to 315 would be insane, but since I don't know what you were doing high bar I can't say much more.  Deadlift is by far your most lofty goal. 315 would be a good ""expectation"" (something you know you should hit) and I would venture 365 would be a really solid goal. 365 is only half a plate away from 405. Although DL is one of those lifts that just ""clicks"" with people. Once you get the explosiveness down, that lift can really take off. Be careful on loading deads though, bad form can really set back all your lifts with back injuries."
gainit,3dqytu,charcoal91,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:57:31 2015 UTC,Thanks for the insight! :D Yeah I know it's pretty lofty but I'm going to challenge myself.  OHP: Yup this seems to be most attainable given the working sets I'm using.  Bench: I've seen some posts that switch to a 3setx5rep scheme once the weights start getting heavier. Do you have any experience with this or a general guideline for when to reduce volume to continue linear progression?  High Bar Squat: I was doing 5x5 sets of 230 with what I thought was good form until my knees began to hurt. This again is super optimistic but I'm just looking to push myself. I think I will eventually need to switch to 3x5 scheme when I hit the upper 200's.  Deadlift: I've been progressing at about +5lbs per week but it could definitely be noob gains. Even with this the math gets pretty tight to reach that goal. I'll try tho!!!
gainit,3dqytu,charcoal91,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:58:14 2015 UTC,"I had those exact goals exactly a year ago.  The only 1rm I had when I started was bench at 165.  I was 120 pounds 5'4"" then.  Now, I'm almost 130 and hit all those with only deadlift left to go.  I can pull 395 but can't lock out on 405 yet.  Since you're much bigger, I think you can hit those by the end of the year."

gainit,3dqytu,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:48:16 2015 UTC,"I don't follow any specific workout plan or diet, but I do follow certain fundamentals.  Honestly, I think what I do might be considered a bad example, but it's been working for me.  For working out, one of the most important thing I find is to dig deep every workout.  One more rep, one more set, a little more weight at the same rep range.  Push yourself to the absolute max everytime you step foot in the gym.  I'm lucky enough to have been using a private gym so I can take my time between sets, and let out loud yells before each set to get pumped up.  I test my max often, and even if I set a PR, I still calculate 80-85% to do a 5x5.  Deadlifts are almost always singles though.  Although sometimes I will work to a PR and do one set to failure on 80-90% for deads.  The MOST important thing though, is that I've come to love working out.  It's never a chore for me.  I get high off that shit.  This past year, I've had periods where I think I may have been working out too much.  5-7 times a week, and all of those are max effort where I'm too tired to do anything else.  I might even have been borderline overtraining/underrecovering.    As for diet, this is where I struggle.  The only thing I tracked was calories.  I get more than enough protein for what I eat (1 gram per lb).  I typically eat clean, not on purpose, I just don't like junk food.  I have been taking ON's pro gainer shakes, sometimes 3 a day, sometimes I'll go a week without taking any at all.  I hate those things.  I always try to eat as much as possible for each day, but usually fell short.  2600 calories is a good day for me.  Yeah, so don't take diet advise from me, other than eat clean.  Also, I take creatine and pre workout along with the weight gainer shakes as supplements."

Just weigh yourself every day at the same time (after you go to the bathroom in the morning and before breakfast is what's usually recommended for a ""true"" weight).  Gaining one pound of weight a week is generally what people want to aim for with a clean bulk. If your weight is going up at a rate of about 1 pound a week (taking into account normal weight variances from day to day differences) then you're eating the right amount of calories. If not, eat more. That's about as complicated as it gets. The 500 calories above maintenance is really just to get you a general idea of where to start (in my opinion). You can go up to gaining 2 pounds per week but it's a wee bit excessive for most people and you'll likely have more fat than you're comfortable with. (On the other hand, for the first few months after being super skinny, gaining a lot at first is fine because it's probably mostly water weight and your body filling out where it needs to)."

gainit,3dnv3f,LKrambeck,4,Fri Jul 17 20:09:52 2015 UTC,"I've done this at time unintentionally. 2 things. If your on a time frame you'd get there faster on average if you bulk then cut, rather than trying to meet in the middle. And secondly if you want to bulk with nothing but lean mass accumulating, than the answer would be a more accurate surplus. Only as many calories as you need to gain weight progressively. Your body doesn't like time stamp a time card at the end of the day. So your day to day isn't as important as your overall week to week. So if you bulked some days and cut others. It'd be very similar to having a routine where you took the 7 day total of this routine you propose, divide it by 7 and eat that everyday. But if it works for your personal weekly schedule etc. If it something you personally want to do because you enjoy the style of training it allows. Bulk on days you lift, cut days you don't. I've done that diet unintentionally many times. It feels great and you stay lean. I'm a big supporter of lean bulks."

gainit,3dnv3f,Tiny311,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:09:23 2015 UTC,"I do something similar to that, it seems to be working even though it's slow. I try to bulk for a few weeks, then cut for a few(usually no more than 3) weeks, and then bulk again and repeat the cycle. Bulks are longer than the cuts, and I'll usually start cutting when I feel my bf% has risen a bit too much for my liking, so there's not really a set time frame on when I'll start. Progress is slow, but I have a pretty small appetite and I don't like the feeling of eating a huge amount of food everyday   I usually would eat at maintenance(or just a bit above) on rest days, but recently I've been doing cardio so I'm eating a bit more on non-lifting days. I guess it's just like a slow bulk with mini-cuts incorporated when I feel like I need to cut some fat."
gainit,3dnv3f,Maschinengewehr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:21:17 2015 UTC,"There are hormonal changes at play as well. I suggest you look up Layne Norton's bulk/cut cycle if you're interested in shorter cycles. What you're suggesting is basically a weekly recomp variation - it's slow but works better for beginners who need to put on muscle while losing fat. For simplicity you could just use the standard recomp approach which is +20% tdee on lift days, -20% on rest days."

gainit,3dmy4o,StatusCrow,5,Fri Jul 17 16:16:17 2015 UTC,"Depends on your goals:  What are the different repetition ranges good for?  See Realization of Training Goals on Wikipedia.  •1-5 reps primarily develop strength, with more impact on muscle size and none on endurance.  •6-12 reps develop a balance of strength, muscle size and endurance.  •13-20 reps develop endurance, with some increases to muscle size and limited impact on strength.  •20+ reps are considered to be focused on aerobic exercise. They do still use the anaerobic system, but usually at a rate through which it can consistently remove the lactic acid generated from it.  Keep in mind that this doesn't mean you can just do 1-5 reps with any weight to develop strength, for example. It means you should be working at the appropriate intensity (i.e. 1-5RM) so that you can only complete 1-5 reps.  While there is considerable overlap in the effects and goals throughout this repetition continuum, powerlifters typically concentrate on the 1-5 rep range and bodybuilders typically concentrate on 8-12 reps. However, both approaches have forays into the 5-8 range or 12+. Athletes typically concentrate on rep ranges that mimic their sport or a specific periodization schema. - /r/fitness"

gainit,3dmy4o,Ifuckedyourgrandma,6,Sun Jul 19 05:51:50 2015 UTC,"If you're getting confused about numbers of reps you probably read Men's Fitness by mistake (that damn magazine is the death of my brother-in-law's training, I swear).  There's no ONE WEIRD TRICK to gains aside from lifting and eating.  Do SS or SL for 3-6 months and don't think about anything else except that program, then you'll be in a better place to think about questions of volume and intensity.  ""How many reps"" is sort of a meaningless question.  Jim Wendler just programs volume as ""50 DB presses of 50% training maximum"" or whatever, and whether you do them in sets of 5 or 8 or 12 doesn't matter at all.  A longer answer is the reason that you'll hear things like ""5 reps is the best for building strength"" or ""8-10 reps for building size bro"" is because the reps basically indicate how heavy the weight is, not a magic arbitrary number.  If you're able to lift something only a low number of reps (say up to 5) then your heavy lifting is going to prioritize building strength.  If you're able to lift something for a higher number of reps then you're going to lift that thing more times, and volume prioritizes building size.  And no matter how many times you can lift a weight, it's going to build both strength and size, so you shouldn't worry about messing with reps and volume and other stuff until you're much further on in your training.  If you do Stronglifts, it's 5x5 because the weight is supposed to be heavy enough that doing 5 sets of 5 reps is taxing, and something you fail at from time to time, not because 5 is a magic number that studies have proven makes more strength gains :)."
gainit,3dmy4o,Tofinochris,3,Fri Jul 17 17:13:03 2015 UTC,"4x8 is a seen as a purely hypertrophic rep range (muscle growth). 5x5 is seen as both a hypertrophy, and strength rep range (muscle growth, and strength gains).

gainit,3dmy4o,MetallicGray,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:48:31 2015 UTC,"when you look at a workout that says how many reps and sets, they are assuming you are putting on the exact number of weight you need to struggle to complete 5x5 or 5x15. meaning you would fail to do the 6th rep in a 5 rep set. or fail to do the 16th rep in a 15 rep set.   if you are solely looking for size over all, do hypertrophy. probably hypertrophy isolation excercises. get in a high protein diet and drink lots of water. Once you hit the size you want, start working on strenght goals. Besure to lift with sweats on.

gainit,3dn6nm,JimNaysium,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:13:03 2015 UTC,"I think it will probably effect your energy for getting through workouts more than your growth. Since growth happens while you rest primarily I think you'll probably be fine. But it would definitely be better to be in a surplus on workout days.  What I was doing for a while, and seemed to work pretty well for a relatively ""clean"" bulk, was a simple calorie cycle.  Right now I do an upper body/lower body split. Tuesday-Wednesday, Saturday-Sunday. On workout days I would eat pretty much as much as I could, aiming for 500+ but basically letting it be unlimited. The first rest day I'd eat a smaller surplus, around 300. And on the one day a week where it's been two days since training, I'd basically go for maintenance.  So...  Tuesday, training day, 500+. Wednesday, training day, 500+. Thursday, rest/recovery day, ~300 over. Friday, rest/recovery day, close to maintenance. Saturday, training day, 500+. Sunday, training day, 500+. Monday, rest/recovery day, ~300. Repeat.  Different strategies work, I just kind of tried it on a whim and it seemed to give me decent results. Gives me plenty of energy for workouts, and insures I'm in a surplus when I'm healing. If it's two days since I've trained it also, theoretically, stops me from gaining fat."

gainit,3dk3vk,aboose,25,Thu Jul 16 22:28:05 2015 UTC,"I have three points to contribute - basically separate out exercise selection from reps/sets/weight from training frequency.  Exercise Selection:  Somebody who does Starting Strength is going to gain mass, they are going to gain strength, but they are not going to match many people's desired aesthetics.  There are lots of muscles they are not developing to look like a fitness model, bodybuilder, whatever.  So that is one of the things I think are at play here.  People who do more well-rounded routines will tend to look 'better' if you are going for aesthetics.  For a power lifter - they don't want muscle in places that don't move a weight.  Reps/Sets/Weight:  There are a number of well-done studies that are starting to poke holes in the time-honored rep ranges for 'strength' and for 'hypertrophy.'  What seems to be emerging is that the total volume at a decent intensity (>~70% 1RM) is really what matters.  If you do 5x5 to near failure, you will gain about as much mass as doing 3x10 near failure).  In the 5x5 example, you will also have a higher 1RM - so people will say you are stronger.  BUT - if you take the 5x5 person and ask him to to an 8RM - 12RM the 3x10 person will do usually do better.  There is also a CNS effect that can make a low-rep trainer be able to lift even more - but that is separate from muscle size.  Training Frequency:  In terms of frequency, it has been proven several times in scientific studies that hitting muscles 2-3 times a week is better for most lifters than a once per week split - particularly for beginner/intermediate lifters.  TL;DR:  If you want to look good do more than the the 'big 4' barbell exercises; do 5x5 or 3x10 or whatever - just do it to near max effort; it is better to hit muscles 2 or 3 times per week for most people most of the time"

gainit,3dk3vk,Analtoast,2,Fri Jul 17 14:05:07 2015 UTC,If you're really worried about it just add a couple compound 5x5 movements into each day before your ppl routine. That's what I do and I still progress in weight over time and I've received compliments about my size gain after 2 and a half months of that.
gainit,3dk3vk,vierce,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:21:35 2015 UTC,Most of my personal experience since last fall was doing 3x5 for ten different of compound barbell lifts.  I got strong (1000 lb club) and gained a bunch of quality weight (30 pounds) within eight months of starting.  I started on a 3 day full body and then moved to a two day split focusing on compound lifts - so A-B-rest-repeat.  Anecdotally - that is not a program that should get you big.  But here I sit at almost 210 and 15% bodyfat during my bulk.  So apparently 3x5 can work as well.  I honestly think that for me the lower volume (3x5) more frequently - every three days - worked very well.

gainit,3dk3vk,FG3,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:00:38 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind:  I've heard from quite a few people that, when they just went for pure aesthetics right off the bat (splits, isolation, etc), they got lots of pretty beach muscles much faster than others who went straight for getting strength.  However, about 8 months to a year down the road, the people who went for aesthetics started stalling and slowing down while the people going for strength just kept plowing through. Those who did strength first and then later switched to an aesthetic routine went on to enjoy the beach muscles without stalling because they were able to start out with, say, 40 pound dumb-bells and all that.  It's my personal opinion that, all possible modifying factors being equal, you'll get to the end at roughly the same time regardless of what routine or method you start with. If you want aesthetics, just start with aesthetics until you're looking better. Then add some power elements into there and work on getting your strength up so you don't stall around the 8 month mark.  In the end you should do what makes you happy, you'll progress much faster that way because you'll look forward to the workouts instead of suffering through them to ""get the body you want""."

If you want to increase how much weight you can move, do a strength program. If you want to look good, train like a bodybuilder.  And you don't have to choose one or the other, just sort of emphasize your goal. Bodybuilders are still strong, and powerlifters still have muscle mass. Definitely do things like squats, deadlifts, and bench press. But go ahead and throw in bicep curls, lateral raises, crunches and isolation lifts like that.  /r/fitness really isn't the best place for advice on bodybuilding.

Do you think doing 8 reps of squats is going to lead to significantly higher muscle gain than 5 reps? The person who squats 4 plates is going to have much better legs than the person who squats 2 plates, so if you want to get big then the program that takes you in the direction of 4 plates will make you bigger.

gainit,3dkmr2,Slap-Jackalope,2,Fri Jul 17 01:06:35 2015 UTC,"Fellow 6'3"" guy here.  Regarding 'want to stay fairly lean...'  The experience of me and many other folks of the taller persuasion is that starting from where you are at you can gain pretty fast without adding much bodyfat - and for a long time.  The downside is adding 10 pounds to a tall guy doesn't always look like much.  You can hit a weekly gain rate of 1 lb/wk and cruise for a while if you are doing a good workout and getting good sleep.    If you are worried about bodyfat, get a simple caliper like the Slim Guide (amazon it.)  Or just a cloth tape and measure you waist - if it changes its mostly due to fat.  That will keep you from freaking out.  As far as workout, depends how much time you want to spend.  The progression style of Starting Strength and StrongLifts are the key to what make those programs work so well - so understand how that works.  You can pick one of those it get started.  Once you have some experience with the program then you can add in some accessories to develop your arms/chest/shoulders more if you desire.  Ice Cream Fitness is a longer program that does that."

Alot of the progress pics I see of the SL 5x5 end up with guys looking a lot bigger than I would like to be. Do you think that is just due to their diet? Or is that what SL does to people?"
gainit,3dkmr2,Ferrous_Puller,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:41:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, your diet will control how big you get. You will not wake up one day all hulked out - so no worries...  StrongLifts is a good program - particularly if you throw in a few upper body accessories.  I donn't know your goals, but don't underestimate the amount of mass gain it takes to fill out a 6'3"" person.  If you are looking at weights for shorter people it is going to take more for you.  You can use BMI as a guide - if the physique you like has a BMI of 22, then you will need a similarly BMI to look like that.  Just go to a BMI calculator and adjust the weight until you are at the same BMI for your height."

gainit,3dgo14,ctrl_alt_believe,8,Thu Jul 16 03:08:58 2015 UTC,I normally would advise against shrugs. Normally someone who has upper cross (rounded shoulders) is likely to also have over active traps and thus reinforcing shoulder raises is something that can be counter productive. Obviously I can't do a posture analysis for you so I am unable to tell you for sure.  Stretching and myofascial release for the anterior muscles are just as important as strengthening your back. Stretching  your chest and shoulders will allow you to see improvements a lot more quickly. Also look into using a Lacrosse ball to loosen up your chest and you should be set

It is a painful process and when we find an area of pain we would probably want to hold the ball in the area for at least 30 seconds"

gainit,3dgo4i,shibz314,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:01:07 2015 UTC,"Fair enough but if you read the actual article they are talking about you can see that 30g is required for maximal protein synthesis, that doesn't mean anything above 30g is wasted, it means that you get no additional muscle growth stimulation above 30g.  In other words, if you eat your protein intake for the day spread out as 20g servings you won't have as much anabolic stimulation as if you spread it out in less sitings of 30g chunks. That effect does not apply past 30g, eating 50g or 30g produces the same effect on muscle stimulus - that doesn't mean the protein is wasted."

The sodium and the fat involved in these things will catch up to you if you only eat these, but work out sparingly. It will ultimately cause pot bellies and bloated faces and whatever else negative things come with a high sodium diet.  If you're looking for cheap meals that fill up, just make shakes with a bunch of stuff + peanut butter and eat that more frequently. I'd avoid the sodium stuff if you can - not really worth it unless you absolutely have no other options.

The main point I think will help you is that you don't have to eat before your workout. Take some Bcaas and train fasted.   It's so much easier doing a pre work workout if you don't have to wake up extra early to eat breakfast and then wait to digest before going to the gym.   All said and done you may have to wake up five hours early.   But if you do leangains, just roll out of bed, drink your bcaas, hit the gym, roll into work.   Also, I suggest either packing some shakes to take during your 15 minute breaks at work or do olive oil shots. If that absolutely repulses you, you could just do pb sandwiches and whole milk."

gainit,3d9mx9,montagic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:47:51 2015 UTC,Thanks dude. Yeh its around that.. I'd prefer to eat my protein but its gets expensive and powder is convenient I guess.  For my hip I've been to loads of physio which helped temporarily but the pain always came back. I was then referred to a consultant who performed MRI and CT scans to diagnose the impingement. In regards to stretching and rolling - as it's a bone structure defect I'm not sure that would help. I'm planned to go into hospital soonish to have my hip joint chiseled away. That's going to be a whole load of fun!
gainit,3d9mx9,lulbob,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:30:41 2015 UTC,Did they say what it was caused from or how it started? Good luck man
gainit,3d9mx9,ObeseMoreece,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:33:36 2015 UTC,"They don't really know -  my consultant says the body may grow the bone spurs in good faith to help strengthen the joint - but it actually just ends up inflaming the area and creating friction in the ball and socket joint!  This site has a good section on it (I have a cam impingement) and under the causes section it says:  'FAI occurs because the hip bones do not form normally during the childhood growing years. It is the deformity of a cam bone spur, pincer bone spur, or both, that leads to joint damage and pain. When the hip bones are shaped abnormally, there is little that can be done to prevent FAI.  Because athletically active people may work the hip joint more vigorously, they may begin to experience pain earlier than those who are less active. However, exercise does not cause FAI.'   I'm glad it says that last bit as I was sure for ages it was from squatting 3 times a week with starting strength!"

I do have a bothersome hip but I think I'm just a bit off from my collapsed arch which causes my right leg to be shorter. I enjoy squatting too much I couldn't imagine now not being able to squat. I will hope for a speedy recovery for you, but keep your head high you will come out of this stronger than ever!"
gainit,3ddjet,fatcat4,5,Wed Jul 15 12:46:12 2015 UTC,I don't think this is unusual.  Once your body gets used to your program you will have more energy for 'other pursuits.'. Right now it is busy trying to fuel and repair you for your lifts.  You may be hitting the weights to hard actually.  What workout program are you running?
gainit,3ddjet,Ferrous_Puller,-1,Wed Jul 15 12:56:41 2015 UTC,"I kind of put together my own one. It consists of these exercises:   Flat dumbell press. Dumbell shoulder press Bent over row Lying Dumbell Triceps Extensions Deadlifts Weighted Squats Standard Bicep Curls   I generally do 3 sets consisting of 10 reps for each, though on the 3rd set I usually up the weight by one ""class"" and go until failure. Between sets I also do like 50 crunches.  I haven't worked out all the TDP's and numbers and stuff, I just eat a lot. I try eat eggs for breakfast along with some buttered coffee, then have a protein shake right after my workout (water) then eat lunch, generally based on salmon or chicken with veggies or salad, have an afternoon snack, usually tuna or chicken or steak, whatever I can find really, then have dinner which usually has a bit of everything, then another shake (with milk this time) before sleeping.  As I said, I went to this straight up, from not doing any exercise and eating much much less."
gainit,3ddjet,Ferrous_Puller,5,Wed Jul 15 13:17:19 2015 UTC,That is a lot of volume for just starting out.  You don't need that much to grow optimally and it is just overstressing your recovery.  Look at the FAQ/Wiki in this sub for some workout programs.  You should really start with something proven.  I grew a ton on 3x5 for months. I just went heavy.
gainit,3ddjet,spartanjesus27,2,Wed Jul 15 15:57:56 2015 UTC,"/u/Ferrous_Puller is right. Way too much volume. 3x10 deadlifts is a recipe for injury, too. If you fail a rep and go all out, you can screw up your back terribly. Pick a pre-made program by someone with experience who knows what they're talking about. This is way too much to be doing every workout for a novice.   Edit: Also, stop doing crunches. Not good for your spine."
gainit,3ddjet,KessryCheese,2,Wed Jul 15 20:38:44 2015 UTC,"You dove right in, you are probably shocking your body a bit.  Certain hormones ramp up from intense exercise (Cortisol) that can affect sex drive.  Also, your CNS may be a bit burnt out too.  All that combined with eating ""maybe triple"" what you were before and probably feeling eternally bloated from that means that you probably are feeling slow, achy, and tired for a large portion of most days.  This is not a sprint, it is a marathon.  Slow yourself down a little bit and get good rest between lifting (sleep is very important).  All of the habits you are trying to instill in yourself right now need to be manageable in the long run.  That is the key to success."

gainit,3dej95,Blackalchemyst,9,Wed Jul 15 17:29:21 2015 UTC,"That's is because paleo is meant to lose weight. It works because without eating any carbs outside of fruits and vegetables, it is very difficult to eat enough calories to hit your TDEE. This is why low carb diets are often recommended for people trying to lose weight, because it allows them to avoid counting calories since carbs are usually the largest source of calories in a person's diet.  I would suggest quitting paleo since most of the other ""benefits"" are BS and it is mostly an appeal to nature (logical fallacy - natural is better). If you want to gain weight, it will be much easier and more effective to include carbs in your diet."
gainit,3dej95,Zombie_bill_clinton,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:45:12 2015 UTC,"I think some of the things in Paleo are pretty good, mainly the sticking to whole foods. If OP is stuck on Paleo, he should simply up the fruit intake and eat fatty meats. None of this boneless skinless chicken breast bs.   The whole hipster attitude that comes from the paleo crowd is annoying though. I still drink my milk, eat my legumes, etc. Although 80-90% of my diet consists of whole nutrient dense food now."

They're best done as a burnout exercise at the end of chest day. Just do 3 or 4 sets of as many you can possibly do before collapsing, as the last exercise of chest day."
gainit,3db2ad,TheManHammer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:05:25 2015 UTC,"I can't say for sure that they will aid bench either, but they're essentially the same movement so I think it makes sense to think it'd help."
gainit,3db2ad,elzeardclym,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:39:20 2015 UTC,Isn't the resistance too light to induce any kind of strength or hypertrophy gains?  Or does it work because you're already fatigued?
gainit,3db2ad,leonra28,2,Thu Jul 16 13:09:53 2015 UTC,"It works because you're already fatigued. As well, you'd be surprised at how many lifters are terrible at push ups! It adds a whole lot of stabilization strength because you're stabilizing your entire body while working your chest. I could do 50+ push ups if I started fresh with no exercises before them, but after an entire chest/tricep day doing perfect form push ups is quite hard. I'm happy to get sets of 10 good form push ups after chest day."

gainit,3d7mwu,zuk1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:13:17 2015 UTC,45lbs / 20kg
gainit,3d7mwu,drallcom3,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:10:53 2015 UTC,20kg therefore a two plate deadlift = 100kg.  20kg bar and 2 x 20kg plates each side.

Incase you aren't, take a big breath in at the top, hold it tight in your stomach and don't release until the top. When you squat your body is pumping blood to all of the muscles that are being used, hence pumping blood away from your brain & lightheadedness. Source: guy in the gym ha makes sense tho"

gainit,3d52sq,bategjorgija,3,Mon Jul 13 16:43:47 2015 UTC,It's most likely due to breathing because the same thing happened to me. Also cutting out pre-workout on squat days made that go away for me.

gainit,3d5hwx,JackMancactus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:20:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure to be honest.  You can see here that my stats are 5 reps of 105 at a body weight of 78. Then the site tells me my 1RM is supposed to be 122.5 (half a kilo lighter than it told me earlier, but whatever).  Then after I hit the generate program button, and look at the one listed for the Texas Method, I get shown this bunch of numbers here.  Unless I'm doing something wrong, I can't understand how this would be correct. It's not even just the Texas Method that has this. If I look at StrongLifts, it has 5x5 110kg in session 1!  Even Smolov Jr says 10x3 of 105kg in week 1. That just doesn't sound doable."
gainit,3d5hwx,JackMancactus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:34:26 2015 UTC,Yeah I did it with my numbers and it did the same thing to me. I have no idea why they made it calculate the numbers like that. Tick the box up top where it says to use 90% of your 1RM. That will give you the proper numbers.
gainit,3d5hwx,kiirk,2,Mon Jul 13 18:48:10 2015 UTC,"Most programs will make you train at 90% of your max. Just flick that option.   If you have needed to deload four times with StrongLifts, you should have actually dropped the reps to 3x5."

I couldn't eat. I had plenty of people to talk to but I didn't want to. Talking never changed anything.  My mind would be on a loop, stuck in suicide and depression and with this idea that life just was not for me.  Either way I was wrong and things changed for me. I eat perfectly fine now.

gainit,3d2zt4,modernbenoni,4,Mon Jul 13 05:19:56 2015 UTC,"Well the 5x5 set and rep range is chosen specifically because it's a linear progression program. Using the 5x5 range, you can reliably increase the weight on the bar after every workout. If you use a smaller rep range, this might not be possible because you're using higher weight at lower reps. It's going to be much more difficult to have any sort of long term linear progression. Stick with 5x5.  Edit: For the non-5x5 rep ranges, you might as well just do what he says. Nothing special about a 3-5 rep range, and you're not about to revolutionize beginner training by adopting a lower rep range. It's not as though it hasn't been tried before. If it worked better in one way or another, that would be the standard."

gainit,3d2zt4,toki08,2,Tue Jul 14 06:58:23 2015 UTC,"Follow icf to the point for as long  as you can, you probably can't improve too much on that either way. If you think it's too easy, spend this valuable time on getting your technique perfect for you. Cause the weights are gonna get heavy quicker than you think, and when they do, you'll wish you'd spent more time focusing on your form.  You should focus on getting as much rest as possible as this is essential for muscle growth. At least eight hours of sleep every night. You may not feel tired, but if you want to grow, you gotta sleep  You also need to get your nutrition on point. For you this means to eat a  lot more than you're used to. You weigh 108 lbs for crying out loud. I don't care if you eat meat, fish, pasta, ramen, carrots, protein powder, milk or oil. Just put a lot of different foods in your mouth, all the time. Make it your goal to feel full at all time.   The program is more than good enough. Do what it says, and do the things I've told you with 100% effort you will see gainz.

gainit,3d2zt4,fem3n3,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:31:24 2015 UTC,"Its a novice program that yields strength gains (function) but it also promotes correct muscle motor pathways associated with lifting (form).   So in essence, practice the form at these loads and the strength will come for years to come (avoiding injury)."
gainit,3d2zt4,The_Amp_Walrus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:20:31 2015 UTC,"Getting sore is more an indication that you did something out of the ordinary rather than evidence that you're making gains. For muscle growth volume is the main driver. Volume = weight * reps * sets. Lift at least 60% of your 1 rep max. If you lift heavier with the same amount of volume you will get stronger but you won't put on more muscle than if you lifted lighter weights. If you lift too light (40%?) you're wasting time, unless you're working on form or something  specific. If I  were you I would do the program as written, but if you're feeling good do some more sets or reps. No need to rush the weight."
gainit,3d5l11,squeezedfish,2,Mon Jul 13 18:26:06 2015 UTC,"How have your lifts improved?  Are you having to deload more often now than before?  Either way, it's time to change programs so you have something you enjoy.  8 months is a good run on any program.  My questions are mainly geared to finding whether you have exhausted linear gains and are ready for more intermediate programming like 5/3/1, for example.  Depending on your goals, you may want something strength oriented (e.g. 5/3/1) or something with more volume like PHUL or PHAT."
gainit,3d5l11,LukeatanPeninsula,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:59:14 2015 UTC,All lifts have improved as follows:  Bench: 30kg >65kg  Squat: 40kg>70kg  Deadlift: 70kg> 110kg  Ohp: 20kg> 40kg  Rows: 30kg>55kg  Havent done any deloading yet but I am tempted to try a program to gain size ad ICF is mainly strength focused.  I will look into PHUL and PHAT though thanks.
gainit,3d5l11,LukeatanPeninsula,2,Mon Jul 13 19:05:05 2015 UTC,"If Greyskull is appealing to you, then go for it.  Obviously it's totally up to you, but if you make the move over to PHUL/PHAT then I'd suggest following a 3x5 or 5x5 linear progression for the compound lifts.  You've made great gains so far but I think you could take linear progression much further, which you should definitely capitalize on until you can't anymore regardless of strength vs. size goals."

gainit,3d4mjc,facetomouth,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:11:50 2015 UTC,"Screw the trainer, dude.  You already know what to do, you just need to be patient.  Your strength will take some time to come back but a lot of people find that when it does, they're stronger than before.  Just pick an existing program and get back into it, assuring your form is solid.  You'll have to leave your ego at the door and accept that the numbers might temporarily be a little lower compared to where you were in peak form.  If you have to stick to fast food options, just be smart about it.  You probably can't hit your protein requirement on straight fast food without going overboard on calories, but maybe stick to like Subway or something and then have some whey handy.  There are some pretty decent protein bars out there nowadays, too.  Subway, Chipotle, certain Chinese food, etc. have never thrown me off of my macros too badly."

gainit,3d5blz,JimNaysium,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:26:04 2015 UTC,"You'll need to be tracking what you eat, but /r/fitmeals should give you some great ideas when you need some inspiration.    As a 15 year old though, learning how to properly cook and flavor the staples like chicken breasts, steak, ground turkey/beef, whole wheat pasta, brown rice, green vegetables, sweet potatoes, peanut butter, fruit, and whey protein powder in most gainer's diet will give you plenty to start.  If they have one, use your parents' slow cooker to make life easy.  You should play around in MyFitnessPal to at least see how much of each of these things takes you to get 3500 calories, even if you're going to stop counting calories eventually.  3500 is my bulking target and I do a 40/40/20 macro split, but it would just be too easy to send you my meal plan... But seriously, I keep it pretty simple and eat much of the same things every day.  I'm currently on a cut, but on an example 3500 calorie day I probably eat 12-16 ounces of chicken breast for lunch along with a can of beans (pink or garbanzo), a piece of fruit, 2 scoop whey shake, and 2 cheese sticks.  If I don't eat chicken again for dinner, it's steaks on the grill, something with ground turkey (meatloaf, burgers, w/ pasta), or another cut of beef that I'll make a stir fry with.  I also have either brown rice or sweet potato here and will throw in a lot of spinach, broccoli, kale, or brussel sprouts on the side (gotta get that fiber).  Spinach is usually eaten cold in a salad, I wilt the kale in the pan, or I roast broccoli or brussel sprouts at 400 F in the oven after coating with olive oil, salt and pepper.  Just start cooking, counting your calories and fine tuning from there, bro."

I'm eating 4000 calories a day to gain because I have a physical landscaping job, and it honestly doesn't feel that difficult anymore to me. Your stomach will physically expand over time, the first two months are the worst by far.   Speaking of your stomach, some bloating is definitely normal. You're eating way more food than you used to so you'll notice it more. That being said I would not personally do GOMAD. That's just so many excess calories that will turn into fat. I know you're skinny for your height and some more fat on you would probably look better, but too much too fast is not good and you'll eventually have to cut it off.   I would just aim for a 500 calorie surplus. By the end of the month I will have gained around 25 pound in 6 months. A pound a week definitely works. You'll build a good amount of muscle but not too much excess fat. Again at our height it's easy to look lean too."

Having to make smaller meals is just a pain and I'm lazy haha. Again, you'll get used to eating more. It just takes time. Definitely get up and make breakfast as early as you can so you can space out the meals as much as possible.  The thing is you're already getting enough calories with drinking the milk(you're putting on weight) So instead of doing GOMAD maybe just cut it in half or just use the milk to make up the calories you need for your 500 calorie surplus. I think that would work well."

Have a post-workout protein shake (milk+unflavored whey+banana.)  I have been hitting between 0.8 lbs/week of weight gain - so it is going well so far.  I don't find the eating more frequently option to work well for me.  I eat at 6:30, 11:30, and then at 6:00 for my meals.  If I do that I usually pretty hungry at meal time.

gainit,3d1f3r,Ferrous_Puller,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:51:37 2015 UTC,"At 16 I was 6'3"" and 135.  By the time I was 18 I was 180'ish and pretty lean because I was an avid runner.  I hung out around 175/180 then for twenty years (I am 38 now.). So I guess you can say I was pretty happy there - I didn't lift or anything out of high school except a bit freshman year of college.  My current gaining streak started last fall.  I did not set out to gain, I was actually trying to strengthen my back so I could run without back pain.  A month in I noticed I was putting on some muscle so I went all in for gaining.  I had aways felt fit all my life and was not weak by any means - I just decided to see how strong/big I could get.  My arms now are 15.5"" around when flexed - so not huge at all.  My shoulders make a decent 'ball' as well so it helps make them look bigger as well.  I am at the point where the visual gains are slowing down but the mass gains keep coming.  I feel I look pretty good right now at 15% bodyfat and almost 210. Almost everbody this age at least has some fat around their middle - most without any muscle.  Being tall with muscle and OK bodyfat makes you loom better in comparison.  My plan is to keep bulking till I hit 215/220 (225...) After that I will cut down  to 10% and then try a really slow bulk.  My goal would be to stay at 10% and pretty much maintain."

gainit,3d1f3r,Bungalow_Dipstick,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:21:11 2015 UTC,You want more pulling movements. Right now you have a even ratio for push to pull (back and chest) and ideally you want a higher pull to push ratio. I would recommend a 1:1.5-2 exercise push to pull ratio to avoid any muscle imbalances that you may develop. And I would also recommend you throw in some trap and hamstring work (maybe even some calf raises) just to balance it out. Also when doing shoulders don't forget to work your rear delts or you may end up with a rotator cuff injury later down the road.
gainit,3d1f3r,Bungalow_Dipstick,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:27:57 2015 UTC,"Ah.. Gotcha. Well, I forgot to mention I do calf raises so that's my fault.  Can you recommend some trap and ham workouts?"

gainit,3d1f3r,Tayo100,2,Mon Jul 13 05:03:56 2015 UTC,"Theres a couple of things that helped me gain weight:   Eat more often, not bigger portions.  Eat more meals and snacks.  You probably don't have a huge appetite (or you wouldn't be here) and its a lot easier to get a 100-200 calorie snack in even when your not hungry versus a 600-800 meal when your not hungry.  On a similar note, you need to be eating first thing when you wake up and the last thing before you go to bed. Planning:  Have your meals ready beforehand.  Don't force yourself to cook/decide what to eat every few hours.  Have it planned out before hand.  I bulk cook chicken breasts, rice, ground beef, spaghetti, veggies and always have them in my fridge in seperate containers ready to mix and throw in the microwave. Liquid calories are great but I tend to save them for after a whole food meal.  Eat as real food as you can, then drink 8-16 oz of whole milk (I stick to whole milk because it digests slower and has more calories.) Sauces.  Find some good sauces you can throw on a meat + carb combo.  I like creamy sauces because these compliment the meat carb combo.  I always have rice and chicken cooked in a tupperware.  Mix chicken, rice (or veggies), and sauce throw it in the microwave and you have 600+ calories ready in a few minutes."

That's more or less what I do adding in some things like black beans and eggs I don't do milk, or dairy at all except the occasional ice cream cheat. I went out and got a set of Tupperware for every day of the week and I fill them and make sure they're all gone by the end of the week.  There was also a lost on gainit for ~900 calorie burritos which I've done its a pain in the ass to make but they will last you about a week for 6 meals a day.

gainit,3cylr8,Ejaculatingfishboy,5,Sat Jul 11 23:26:33 2015 UTC,Seriously impressive gains. I've been going to the gym for a couple weeks now and I was just wondering how you split up your muscle groups and what your routine looked like.
gainit,3cylr8,MasonIsACat,3,Sun Jul 12 00:25:26 2015 UTC,I probably don't have the best workout routine...but it has worked for me. Everything is 3 sets of 6-7 reps. And then after the last set I drop weight and burn out. Monday: chest and abs Wednesday: legs and abs Friday: back biceps Sunday: full body workout (no abs)
gainit,3cylr8,Atomraygun,3,Sun Jul 12 01:30:55 2015 UTC,"Damn. I hardly ever comment, but just wanted to tell you great work. Did you keep track of how many calories you consumed a day?"
gainit,3cylr8,seanpmc,3,Sun Jul 12 00:27:35 2015 UTC,Thank you. Yes- I tracked them via myfitnesspal and my goal was 3400. I would usually hit that daily and if I did not I would make up the rest the next day.

gainit,3d02tp,danwilcox2,8,Sun Jul 12 10:08:51 2015 UTC,"For biceps and calves think less numbers and more feeling. Squeeze those muscles, do slow reps at first, get a good burn, then speed it up a little bit. You want each set to induce hypertrophy so each set, bring that muscle to a burn, and then spit out 10 more reps or whatever. You don't need that many sets. If you go past a burn -- beyond where you'd normally stop -- 3 or 4 times for each muscle, they will grow and you will be sore as fuck. Also, eat some more protein."

gainit,3cy3bp,refrigeratorbob,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:39:33 2015 UTC,Boneless wings from a restaurant or package are scientifically designed to be delicious - complete with market testing.  If you are making simple chicken and rice then it is probably not seasoned and cooked to the same level.

gainit,3cx5xm,free_ryan,5,Sat Jul 11 17:16:27 2015 UTC,"Okay, this week was crazy! Multiple stories this week!    Story 1: (from last week but who cares) So I was taking a pre workout shyt ...because skwaats. And I was midway through my job when I heard someone busting through the door with loud music on and making strange noises.  Now, I hate when I'm taking a dump and someone is in the bathroom so I go into restroom ninja mode. I hear him gagging/choking (It wasn't Tony Romo tho) and then throw up.    Pretty nasty, yes. He washes his face like 3 whole minutes and I think he was adjusting his hair too. Then silence for like 30sec. Then I hear the shutter sound of his phone. He takes like 5 pics with 5sec. between each but then he goes full paparazzi and I hear his shutter fire like a machine gun. That kid must've took like 20 pics or so. This whole thing took like 5min. But damn, I want to finish my shyt and this kid doesn't leave. Instead I hear him writing and receiving sms. I'm like ""r u srs, bruh!?"" (in my mind). I finish my biz and get out. As soon as I moved that guy ran outta there as fast as he came in. He probably thought there was no one in the stalls. TL;DR: Guy throws up.. takes pics of it while I'm taking a shyt.       Story 2: For the first time ever I witnessed a bro succesfully picking up a MILF. He was like ""Why are you breathing so heavy?"" She was like ""I need more air I'm outta breath."" Then they talked about where they are from, why they workout etc. He offered to give her a ride home and she agreed.     Story 3: So, it was pretty late. Around 11:15pm. Had to workout late cuz of college. I always stroll around my bench during my rest periods when I'm benchin'. Then I saw a bird fly through the gym. I thought ""hopefully that bird gets out of here soon."" because that bird was flying high speed around there. Then after it passed me 2nd time I saw that it was a bat and not bird. Even crazier. At 1st it was funny to watch that thing around and not getting out even though all windows were opened wide because of the heat. But after a while it got really annoying. The bat got faster and paniced. After 10min. a 2nd bat joined and then I had 2 bats flying around me and passing right in front my face multiple times. Luckily this happened at the end of my workout so I did not have to deal with them the whole time. TL;DR: Two crazy bats in my gym at night."
gainit,3cy7cn,awesomeqasim,2,Sat Jul 11 21:15:22 2015 UTC,"Fat really isn't that big of an issue. Dietary fat doesn't correlate with body fat. If anything, it aids with digestion and keeps you feeling satiated.  The only fat you have to look out for is trans fat. That's the bad stuff (most commonly found in fast food and baked goods, both of which you should limit your intake of anyway)."
gainit,3cy7cn,ChwatBot,0,Sun Jul 12 02:17:40 2015 UTC,"You could not add the overt fats. Ie the oil, coconut milk, lower fat milk, less peanut butter.

gainit,3cy7cn,refrigeratorbob,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:55:51 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback! Do you have any foods in mind that I could add to the shake to make sure I reach my calorie goals but not push the fat content too high?
gainit,3cy7cn,refrigeratorbob,2,Sun Jul 12 10:13:16 2015 UTC,More bananas and more protein powder. Fat is 9 calories per gram its hard to beat so youll just need to eat more
gainit,3cxuqz,Ringoko,2,Sat Jul 11 19:24:21 2015 UTC,"How old are you? If you are young you may have to bump up the calories. Try to get a meal in right before bed with some food protein (not whey because it processes too fast).  Also you will have to exercise some patience, 12 days isn't long. After my first week I bumped down weight on a couple of exercises to work on my form, but since early June I've added 20 pounds to my bench press and I've seen similar gains in other excercies too."
gainit,3cxuqz,BIGJ0N,2,Sat Jul 11 21:13:33 2015 UTC,"1) you could try adding a couple hundred more calories but that is most likely not it. As a beginner you can easily gain strength on  even a caloric deficit. And many intermediate lifters still gain strength on a cut.   2) more likely is that you started with weights that are too heavy for you. Are you sure you're working with a weight where you can properly do each exercise with proper form and range of motion?  Even dropping each exercise by 15lbs will really only set you back like a month or so at this stage so don't be afraid to lower the weight a bit.   3) you said you're doing sets of 10. Strength programs typically use sets of 3-5 for the main lifts. So if you're doin sets of 10, it can be harder to actually progress.   And most ppls are geared toward more experienced lifters I believe since they're pretty high volume. You may want to explore a different program."

There seems to be too much guesswork involved with free weights and I feel like I need to have someone experienced tell me if my form is ok. For example I feel like my form is alright until the final set, but two people online now have said the weight may be too much for me.  Instead I have an old multigym at home that I will begin using. It has about 20 different exercises all told. I don't think I can go wrong with form on these exercises. However I'm not sure whether to do all 20 exercises for 3 reps 3 times a week, or whether that will be too much."
gainit,3cxuqz,almondbutter1,2,Tue Jul 14 05:09:16 2015 UTC,"Dude noooo. You just said something very taboo haha.   No weightlifter likes machine based workouts and we will vehemently tell you not to build a routine around them.   Free weights are the way to go man.  When you do machines you're often put into unnatural range of motions cause you're following a set path and not necessarily something that's natural for your specifi body. Plus you don't hit stabilizer muscles and the like.   I'm telling you, if you start on say a machine bench press then build up and go to do actual barbell bench press once you feel ""strong enough,"" your working weight is going to plummet and you'll be totally deflated. Plus you will probably open yourself up to injury at that time since your chest will most likely be stronger than your shoulders.   Just drop the weight, watch form videos, post form checks if you have to, whatever. And again, if you do like 3x5 I guarantee it'll be easier to add weight ech week."

gainit,3cxuqz,almondbutter1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:19:52 2015 UTC,"Pick a weight to start where you will not fail. Where you an complete all your reps in each set with good form.   Then add 2.5ls per dumbbell. If you're able to finish all your sets and reps, add another 2.5 next time.

gainit,3cw2la,Ilokanoman,2,Sat Jul 11 06:56:38 2015 UTC,"Yes. Part of your shoulder will work for stabilization or as a secondary muscle in the movement, but that's not enough. You really should work your shoulders separately. Overhead press is the best compound lift for shoulders.   Having weak shoulders will create a lot of problems down the road. You're only as strong as your weakest muscle involved in a lift. Don't neglect body parts. Try and keep your muscle strength balanced throughout your body.   Your first mistake though is relying on machines. If you're actually serious about gaining, you need to stop wasting time with machines and start tackling the free weights.  Read or re-read the FAQ and choose one of the beginner plans."

It wasn't until the past year that I ate more chicken/fish/pasta since I have a job I can get my own food. And I work at Olive Garden so I get a discount on everything there, I could buy  a salmon for $4.00! Lately after I go to the gym I've been buying a chicken burrito from chipotle which I add: chicken, brown rice, pinto beans, lettuce, cheese, and corn. It comes out out to about 1000 calories and there's a reason cops/fireman always go there. Hope I answered your question.

Eat until you the point where you are going to be sick and try and then try and force a few more mouthfuls. This part is definitely a mental game.  Get a good protein powder/weight gain shake which will help you add extra calories to your diet, it's not necessary and if you can't afford it don't worry but it will make things easier.  Peanut butter, chicken, rice, tuna, milk. Learn to love them.  You are going to have to make a strict routine for yourself for gym and eating and the one thing that is going to keep you motivated at the end of the day is your reason why you are doing this.  So dude as everyone else said make sure you are doing this because it is what you want to do. I don't know your current situation but if you feel like your parents are making you do this because they want the best for you and you feel like this will help you grow and progress as a person, then go for it.  But the best thing for you to do is just start. You can do as much research as possible but honestly the most productive thing for you to do is to get started now. Go join your local gym, maybe find a gym partner, go grocery shopping and bulk cook all your meals. It's not going to be easy, but thats the great thing about it.

One week of not prepping food does not mean anything. Try again the next week. Eventually the habit will form. As with forming any new habit, try to make it enjoyable. I do this by getting high as a fucking kite, putting on some electronica and rocking out. I become a straight up Gordon Ramsay in the kitchen when the music is pumping and I'm flippin' the ground beef in the pan. Learn to multitask. 1, heat oven, 2, chicken on pans and seasoned, 3, sweet potatoes in the water and boiling, 4, brocoli in the microwave, 5, oven is ready - in with the chicken, 6, beans tomatoes and onion in the slow cooker, 7, fry ground beef, 8, 30mins since chicken in the oven, pull out chicken, potatoes, mash, brocoli ready, put it all in the fridge, chilli ready in 3 hours just chillin' and cookin' like a boss. Total prep time - 1 hour for 5 days of food. Bad food will make you not want to meal prep. I've had to throw out some dishes that just did not turn out right. Don't let it get you down. Make it easier on yourself. I eat 6-8 meals a day, only 4 are prepped. Breakfast is a shake or yogurt so no prep needed. Last meal of the day is oatmeal and a shake so also no prep needed. Watch some cooking shows, get excited by cooking. On the weekends I'll cook something nice for myself. Some caprese or something. This will help you to make cooking an enjoyable habit.

It amazes me when people think that calling someone a little bitch is going to suddenly give them motivation to do something. If anything, it's more likely to have the opposite effect.  I'd recommend looking for some foods that are quick and easy to make. I wouldn't recommend eating processed foods very often, but they're nice to have on hand when you're lacking motivation to cook.   Just try to avoid foods that are unhealthy. Even TV dinners or canned food can have nutritional befits if you know what to look for. Also, purchase some raw fruits and vegetables.   Nutrition plays a role in motivation and energy levels. You might find yourself more motivated and able to cook if you eat foods that are high in vitamins and nutrients. Personally, I love a homemade strawberry and banana smoothie.

But with intercostals, it needs to be like ultimate low. Bodybuilder show day low, like <6%, <5% even. Also dehydrated muscles, like right before a show. I don't think many people have these muscles showing at all times."
gainit,3cuqcr,CharlieZX,3,Fri Jul 10 23:31:55 2015 UTC,"Pretty much! Most people don't have those showing all the time.   OP, your best bet when approaching this is to train your Serratus Anterior. They aren't your intercostals, but they are above them and might achieve somewhat of a similar result.   Pullover-style exercises, as /u/TheManHammer recommended, will hit the Serratus well, and along with breathing techniques, might train the body in the way you're looking for. It's a good place to start at least."

gainit,3ctzpv,Paperted,3,Sun Jul 12 15:40:16 2015 UTC,"Scientist here with experience in measurement uncertainty.  I measure myself every morning after I pee.  From this data, I know that my weight can fluctuate as much as 4 pounds from day to day - more usually around 2.  This is from a quality scale under the same conditions - my actual weight is changing.  If I weigh myself once a month - using the same protocol, here is what can happen.  Let's say my average true weight (so the average of a few days to cancel out the variation) the first month is 150.  The scale could read 148 or 152 or anything in between.  Maybe even further than that.  Lets say at the end of the month my average true weight was 153 - the scale could say 151 to 154.  Two possible extreme scenarios: 1) 148 -> 154 = holy shit I need to back off my bulk  2) 152 -> 151 = holy shit i need to increase my bulk  Neither of these two scenarios reflect that actual 3 pound right on target gain rate.  Both of which could cause you to react inappropriately to the measurement and throw you off your perfectly working program.  No matter what interval you want to weight yourself (every two weeks, every month, every year) - you can't base it on a single measurement.  You need to weight yourself on ~4 consecutive (in the morning before you pee) days and average them.  More than 4 would be better in order to cancel out the normal fluctuations in bodyweight.  i kept this pretty straightforward - but this is not abstract math - this is real stuff that happens.  Personally, I weight myself every day (or almost everyday) and look at weekly averages.  I plot them on a graph and can see visually what is happening.  TL;DR:  Never base your weight off of one measurement.  You have to measure at least four days in a row and average them."

Supplements can help to fill in the gaps that you struggle to reach with normal food. For example, protein powder can be used to reach your protein macro goal. Examine.com is a very good website which can be used to find out more about most supplements.   •Protein powder - If meeting your protein goal seems daunting through regular food alone, you may want to consider protein powder. If you are already achieving your protein goal through regular food, there is no need to supplement additional protein. There are many different types, but all serve the same function, providing you with supplemental protein. To tackle a common misconception, it should be noted that protein from protein powder isn't anything special, i.e. whey is the same protein you would get from a glass of milk, it is simply separated from casein protein and condensed. Try [this thread]  •Weight gainer - Weight gainers are attractive to many who struggle to eat high caloric amounts for their dense caloric value. However, they are simply protein powder (as detailed above), with a large amount of carbohydrates or modified starches (e.g. waxy maize, maltodextrin, etc). This isn't particularly healthy or cost efficient. You are better off mixing protein powder with high quality ingredients such as oatmeal, olive oil, fruit, etc. in order to make a more healthy, cost efficient protein shake. -FAQ"

I always go with 1g protein per lb BW (yes this is more than recommended, but makes that math easier, allows for a cushion and let's face it...I get to eat more meat). So that's 160g P per day = 640 cals.   For fat I use .5 (again just makes the math easier for me) 160/2 = 80g F per day = 720 cals.   That leaves 1520 cals / 4 = 380 carbs.   Assuming that 2880 TDEE is accurate.   I'm usually pushing 400+ carbs per day which I can hit with just some oats,  a shake w/milk, rice, chocolate milk and some fruit.   Ultimately, as long as your hitting your daily caloric goal, then protein goal mix/match the fat/carbs how you want....imo."

So far this has been true to me, I'm 2 months in and can already see big differences in my arms, chest and mostly legs. I've even had a few comments of ""are you bulking?""

Outside of that, just be patient and consistent. Others will notice any changes before you do (at least that's the way it's been for me).  Friends and family should start making comments about you lifting in 4-6 weeks."

gainit,3cq3xd,le_comedien,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:55:22 2015 UTC,"One of my many foolish and failed bulk attempts was when I took Cyproheptadine (Periactin) to stimulate my appetite for 2 months and gained 15 kg (!). (I took 4 mg Periactin / day)  As soon as I stopped the pills I lost all of the weight I gained and then some, and my appetite was worst off than before.  Cyproheptadine / Periactin is a 1st generation anti-histamine and it WILL make you eat like a friggin horse - the hunger is insane on it, but it will turn you into a zombie as with any 1st generation anti-histamine it makes you drowsy as hell, not to mention irritable too.

I alternate chest supported hammer row and seated cable row on my bench days.  I do pullups on press days.  Those are my plugins.

The base Greyskull LP is only (assuming 3 days, MWF, ABABAB)  A: Bench 2x5,1x5+ B: Press 2x5,1x5+  M: Squat 2x5,1x5+ W: Deadlift 1x5+ F: Squat 2x5,1x5+  So what Phrak adds is the plugin portion.  Phrak will even say he is not the author of Greyskull, only the maker of one such variant.  It's all good and keeps me interested, personally.

If 3x through the circuit is too much, start with 2x. If 2x is too much, start with 1x the superset. I focus on super form and perfection for these, as I do with my main lifts, and the results have been really great. Always got some DOMs going on, and my lifts have been really steady increasing."

gainit,3ck8sk,TwackyBird,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:03:50 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up over a year ago I lifted a little bit and weighed around 155 but college got the best of me and I decided I liked drinking/socializing and taking study enhances(these make me not want to eat) to do well on tests more than focusing on eating and going to the gym.   Month 1 – Still in college mode - end of spring semester Realized I was feeling tired and weak and had dropped from my standard 150 to 145. Felt scary thin and did not like my image it at all. Started eating 3 meals a day, no idea how many calories, and bought serious mass. Started going to the gym a couple times a week, but honestly I just wanted to gain fat at this point, had little focus on muscle. Took 1 scoop serious mass after light workouts.   Month 2 – Home from school. Desk job. Weigh 150 when I return home. Happy but all my old High School buddies are decently big so I decide I need to get serious while I don’t have many distractions besides your standard 8-5 work day. I discover smoothie king around this time and it has been a godsend on my weight gain. I'm not a huge breakfast guy, which has always been my problem, and now get a medium strawberry hulk every morning on the way to work. $8, but 1200 calories of pure gainz. Start taking creatine and drinking a gallon a day religiously, which is easy at a desk job. Break 1 – Publix evol fire grilled steak bowl – 500 calories of deliciousness. Macadamia nuts are also great for fat and calories. 8 nuts have ~100 calories. I scarf those puppies down during my shift. Have a normal sandwich for lunch, with chips, and banana. Mom makes something for dinner, which is usually protein packed and carbs. I have a couple scoops of synth-6 protein after workouts.  I hit the gym right after work 3 times a week. At this point I'm really thinking fuck legs, no one is going to notice leg growth and I look like my arms are toothpicks, so upper body is what Ill focus on. Broke it into chest/tri, back/bi, shoulders, and gave arms another day all alone if they weren’t to sore.  Saw immediate gains in my upper body. Did this for a full month.   Month – 3 Started around June 15th - Current  Same deal on the food. It’s lame and expensive but mom pays for steak bowls, lunch food, and dinner. I only pay for protein and smoothie king. So I keep it up.  I decide legs aren’t stupid. I should probably hit them once a week and work it in when they aren’t sore. Really just do squats and leg curls. Same upper body split – back/bi, chest/tri, shoulders, and I toss the two legs exercises in with one of those. My buddy told me to do 100 barefoot, bodyweight, standing calf raises a day so I do that also. The routine is just some old routine my buddy had; I have pictures of it saved to my phone so I guess I could email them if you really want it. Honestly though, its me eating. Fuck the “I have a fast metabolism,” I kept telling myself I had. I just wasn’t eating. I eat normal now, nothing crazy like 4000 calories, just enough so I feel full most of the day.  Im assuming this will get down voted because: don't hate on legs, why not 5x5, horrible split, or some random shit. I have a girlfriend that I've been with a couple of years and just felt shitty having sex. Honestly I couldn't believe my gf wanted to have sex with me, felt like such a twig. Focused on upper body so I would feel better about myself in bed. It worked. Now to just get rid of chicken legs."

Recomping often leads to pissing around and not getting that far.  People tend to achieve better results when they just stick with one or the other.  That being said, I am not arguing that it can't happen, just that it probably isn't something most people should go for."
gainit,3cmh0r,yugotprblms,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:28:20 2015 UTC,"Would incorporating some cardio into my routine, say 2x a week or something help with that at all?   Cardio is a burn on calories and helps cardiovascular health. There is nothing wrong with adding cardio as long as you account for it in your TDEE. Keep in mind that your TDEE is not going to be what the machine says or what MFP tells you. It will be in a range of those numbers though. What I am getting at is that your diet, 100x more than your exercise, is going to determine when and how fast you get rid of those 'love handles'.   That being said, to get rid of the 'love handles' you are sacrificing the gains you need to get back the v-taper. The v-taper was lost when you grew into your body. To get that back, it would be easier to be on a surplus and perform more lat exercises/back exercises. That won't happen quick and you'll probably get a little more 'love handles' in the process.    How long should I continue to bulk for x amount of months/weeks, and cut for x amount of months/weeks? When cutting, how many calories should I be eating each day?   As vanity fades with the passage of summer into fall, I would recommend tracking your TDEE and getting some mileage into a calorie tracking regimen over the next month or two so that you can  get an idea what your TDEE is and get a better read on your cut/bulk ideal caloric intake is. There is a science to this and there are a number of books/websites that can help but the gist of it is that you track for a week, weigh yourself, add or remove calories from your day, track for a week, weight yourself, etc. The adjustments are usually 250 to 500 calories. If you learn to do this you will get the body you want faster with the added benefit over time of immediately knowing which foods to grab and which to avoid while eating out or eating in. This also answers your bulk v. cut question as there is no defined period to do either. There is some anecdotal evidence of a benefit if you are doing a heavy cut or heavy bulk (i.e. don't go catabolic trying to rush a cut or get super fat pushing a bulk). As one last thing, a bulk is not an excuse to go absolutely nuts on sweets. Your muscles can't do dick with a slice of cake but those same calories with a breast of chicken? Gains."

Breakfast: 3 cups of coffee  Lunch: Whatever was around the office, approx 500-1000 cals  Dinner: 6 vodka redbulls, maybe an appetizer at the bar or bowl of cereal at home.  For about a year.. I was going through a dark period.  Bar tabs were between 600-800/mo + drinking at home.    I still drink, less, but I actually eat now."

gainit,3cmwq1,blazemore,2,Thu Jul 9 18:16:41 2015 UTC,"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12442909  Several sources of information suggest that human beings evolved on a diet with a ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 essential fatty acids (EFA) of approximately 1 whereas in Western diets the ratio is 15/1-16.7/1.  Western diets are deficient in omega-3 fatty acids, and have excessive amounts of omega-6 fatty acids compared with the diet on which human beings evolved and their genetic patterns were established.  Excessive amounts of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and a very high omega-6/omega-3 ratio, as is found in today's Western diets, promote the pathogenesis of many diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, whereas increased levels of omega-3 PUFA (a low omega-6/omega-3 ratio) exert suppressive effects.  In the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, a ratio of 4/1 was associated with a 70% decrease in total mortality.  A ratio of 2.5/1 reduced rectal cell proliferation in patients with colorectal cancer, whereas a ratio of 4/1 with the same amount of omega-3 PUFA had no effect.  The lower omega-6/omega-3 ratio in women with breast cancer was associated with decreased risk.  A ratio of 2-3/1 suppressed inflammation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and a ratio of 5/1 had a beneficial effect on patients with asthma, whereas a ratio of 10/1 had adverse consequences.  These studies indicate that the optimal ratio may vary with the disease under consideration. This is consistent with the fact that chronic diseases are multigenic and multifactorial.  Therefore, it is quite possible that the therapeutic dose of omega-3 fatty acids will depend on the degree of severity of disease resulting from the genetic predisposition.   A lower ratio of omega-6/omega-3 fatty acids is more desirable in reducing the risk of many of the chronic diseases of high prevalence in Western societies, as well as in the developing countries, that are being exported to the rest of the world."
