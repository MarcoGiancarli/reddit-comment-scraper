budgetfood,3e4x6a,lgodsey,5,Wed Jul 22 01:06:44 2015 UTC,I asked my husband to come up with the title. That's the best he's got.   1 can Tuna  Noodles  Shredded Cheese  Butter  Frozen Peas
budgetfood,3e4x6a,emmastout,6,Wed Jul 22 00:02:07 2015 UTC,A super easy bechamel or even a can of mushroom soup would make it legit.
budgetfood,3e4x6a,OldBeercan,-2,Wed Jul 22 02:58:21 2015 UTC,Frozen Peas? I don't like it.
budgetfood,3e4x6a,emmastout,6,Wed Jul 22 02:57:03 2015 UTC,But frozen peas are awesome.
budgetfood,3e4x6a,NMJ87,2,Wed Jul 22 04:59:32 2015 UTC,Personal tastes. Anything else can replace frozen peas?
budgetfood,3e4x6a,TheShadyChemist313,4,Wed Jul 22 06:30:00 2015 UTC,"heres a tip for everyone, recipes like this are endless and can be done with MINIMAL effort.  back in college i used to do something alike to this like 3 times a week:  2 cups of rice in the rice cooker, let it steam  once its done, and while its hot, toss in a cream of something soup  add in 2 cans of tuna, 1 can of peas and carrots  spice it with black pepper or lemon pepper or cayenne or all 3 or whatever the hell you want  meal ranks in at less than 5 bucks and makes enough to feed 2, or one VERY hungry student.  feel free to add in things like grated cheese or peeled out string cheese to make it gooey and lovely  Cheaper by a mile than the drive through and tasty as fuck - the effort involved is literally measuring rice to water at a 1:2 ratio and then hitting ""on"" on the rice cooker  a more complex and cheesy version of this, instead of using cream of something soup, take some velveeta, milk and butter and do up a cheese sauce in a small pot whle you wait for the rice to cook  or can do white gravy  brown gravy  bechamel  the recipes are endless, the meats can be varied  take chicken thighs bought at like 1.30 a lb, debone and deskin them, toss em in the skillet with 3 tbl spoons of oil, sautee them with huy fong's chilli garlic sauce - add in an onion to cook til transluscent in the fat and oil of the chicken, do up that velveeta sauce and lay all of this over the bed of rice and peas -- or a fun thing to do is to do brocoli with the velveeta and mix that into the rice  again.. endless, get creative. substitute rice for pasta, add in fresh basil and tomatoes, season the fuck out of stuff or cover it in tabasco and sriracha, your choice."
budgetfood,3e2e3v,windowsraf,3,Tue Jul 21 12:50:38 2015 UTC,Holy smokes! If I were met with a plate of these my will power would crumble and I would completely forget my doctor told me to hold onto a low carb diet.
budgetfood,3dzd3o,nud3s,9,Mon Jul 20 19:33:21 2015 UTC,"Buy regular oats for cheap. Add sugar (syrup, honey, brown sugar) and a pinch of salt. Throw in nuts and/or seeds if you want, whatever is best value at the time. Chuck in any extras if you fancy - extracts (vanilla, caramel, maple), cinnamon, nutmeg etc. I suggest not skipping this step because seasoning is the secret to turning boring food into amazing food. Bake at a low heat and then mix in whatever dried fruit you want.   Make as much as you want and store it in an air-tight container.  I find this more delicious than any store bought granola I've ever had, probably because I can make it exactly to my taste. When I'm seeeriously broke (most of the time) I skip any nuts/seeds/fruit and it's still super delicious. Get those spices down and you're sorted."
budgetfood,3dzd3o,Meldamiriel_,4,Tue Jul 21 06:07:12 2015 UTC,"Is there not an oven that you have access to? Granola is unbelievably easy and cheap to cook, but expensive to buy."
budgetfood,3dzd3o,Midgar-Zolom,9,Mon Jul 20 23:21:01 2015 UTC,I bought a bag. It was basically a huge bag of unfrosted flakes. I think I had one almond slice per bowl. It was not worth it.

budgetfood,3dzd3o,cypionate,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:09:42 2015 UTC,I would check the dietary fiber and see how that compares to your regular granola.

budgetfood,3dzd3o,Meldamiriel_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:29:40 2015 UTC,"I find that I'm still really hungry after eating any Malt-O-Meal cereals. They tend to just be empty calories that happen to be pumped with nutrients. Like someone else said, comparing fiber content is helpful because that helps you feel full.   I switched from Malt-o-Meal 30-serving-bags to much smaller, more expensive cereal brands and honestly it ends up costing me roughly the same in the long run. I'm actually satisfied on one serving of Kashi or granola or Great Grains whereas I have to have like 3-4 servings in a huge-ass bowl for the cheapo stuff (or have to pair it with a second food)."
budgetfood,3dzd3o,cryogenetik,3,Tue Jul 21 03:46:26 2015 UTC,"There is almost no nutritional difference between Mini Spooners (MOM) and Mini-Wheats (Kellogg's), and they both have 6g fibre/serving. Oh, and Kellogg's contain high fructose corn syrup. I know not all MOM cereals are made this way, but it's also an unfair comparison. Shitty corn/rice-based cereals will always be shitty."
budgetfood,3dzd3o,emmastout,0,Tue Jul 21 07:04:15 2015 UTC,Mini wheats are also an awful example of a filling cereal. I'm not saying to buy the equivalent name brand cereal instead of a given MOM cereal (i.e lucky charms instead of marshmallow mateys). I'm saying more expensive brands offer certain quality cereals that don't exist for MOM at all.
budgetfood,3dzd3o,Smark_Henry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:47:17 2015 UTC,Look whether it needs to be cooked and  where it comes from. Usually these two factors influence the price.

budgetfood,3e0nzr,WipeDown,2,Tue Jul 21 01:28:35 2015 UTC,Queso: melt it with rotelle and add some chorizo. I used to melt the stuff on steamed broccoli. Or there's always a grilled cheese. Add some salami or lunch meat for some protein.
budgetfood,3e0nzr,gurbs319,2,Tue Jul 21 03:11:04 2015 UTC,"To be clear, use Mexican chorizo, not Spanish.  The Mexican kind is more like American breakfast sausage, and fries and crumbles very well.  The Spanish kind is more of a dry, hard sausage like pepperoni or salami.  They're seasoned similarly though,and both are great with cheese.  Its also usually much easier to find Mexican chorizo and it's a lot cheaper.  For super protein power, scramble eggs with the cheese and Mexican chorizo after you get it fried up.  It's frigging delicious.  Throw in some chunks of avocado if you like, too."
budgetfood,3e0nzr,RotationSurgeon,2,Tue Jul 21 05:41:36 2015 UTC,"You can make amazing Mac and cheese with the stuff, pretty good grilled cheese, and nachos. I can't think of anything else. Look up recipes for Velveeta; that's what government cheese was like back in the day."
budgetfood,3e0nzr,evileine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:38:52 2015 UTC,"You can freeze it if you get tired of it.  Since it's not really cheese, you don't lose much by freezing it."

budgetfood,3e0nzr,FingerTheCat,0,Tue Jul 21 02:21:13 2015 UTC,TIL horrible fake cheese comes in brick form
budgetfood,3dtqsy,Dunkleberry,31,Sun Jul 19 11:09:40 2015 UTC,Try cooking it with stock (chicken/beef) instead of plain water. Add some lightly fried onion and garlic. Spices wont hurt either.
budgetfood,3dtqsy,sharkbag,7,Sun Jul 19 11:21:55 2015 UTC,"And add some fresh tomatoes, makes it really tasty with the salt from the stock, and much more fresh."

budgetfood,3dtqsy,bobyd,7,Sun Jul 19 11:35:53 2015 UTC,Curry or indian mix
budgetfood,3dtqsy,Sheepgurt,2,Sun Jul 19 12:10:41 2015 UTC,"Ras El Hanut, and a little bit of butter or olive oil. If you can't find Ras el Hanut, add bay leaves, ground cumin, coriander seeds, vennel seeds, kurkuma and a touch of cinnamon to the broth."
budgetfood,3dtqsy,godzillary,3,Mon Jul 20 09:40:32 2015 UTC,"This.  Meat and garlic, maybe with mushrooms tastes great!"
budgetfood,3dtqsy,AllwaysConfused,9,Sun Jul 19 18:45:31 2015 UTC,"Cook it in stock instead of water. Melt a couple tablespoons of butter, add a clove of finely minced garlic. Toss that together with the cous cous and serve topped with good grated parmesan.   Or chop and saute a red/yellow/orange (just not green) bell pepper. Add it to the cous cous and toss in half a cup (or to taste) of nice plump raisins."
budgetfood,3dtqsy,HurtMarbles,7,Sun Jul 19 13:54:44 2015 UTC,"I finely chop loads of crunchy red peppers and onion into mine. Add half a can of sweet corn, fresh tomatoes, salt, pepper, a touch of dijon and mayonnaise or balsamic and mayo. Pop the whole dish into the fridge to chill. It's my go to daily lunch when the family is on holidays somewhere warm."
budgetfood,3dtqsy,6F6A9O9,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:07:05 2015 UTC,Do you eat it with a spoon or dip into it with bread/pita?
budgetfood,3dtqsy,HurtMarbles,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:02:38 2015 UTC,"Just a spoon. You don't add that much mayo, just enough to give it a bit of a creamy texture."
budgetfood,3dtqsy,manyshaped,5,Mon Jul 20 14:33:26 2015 UTC,"I add orange or lemon juice to the water - replace about 1/4 of the water.   dried raisins or apricots are really nice. add them with the water and they'll plump up.  Old Bay or Paprika adds a nice heat - about a teaspoon per potion works for me. Allspice, cinnamon and ginger give it a Asian feel.  I pour over the meat juices if I'm serving it with lamb"
budgetfood,3dtqsy,tochirov,3,Sun Jul 19 18:10:10 2015 UTC,"chop up and fry some veg (squash or whatever you've got around), fry an egg (soft sunny up is best)  and throw on a good heap of Mae Ploy sweet chili sauce.   its like a VERY budget version of bimimbap.  but its absolutely delicious, and very cheap to make."
budgetfood,3dtqsy,tochirov,3,Sun Jul 19 18:51:30 2015 UTC,also since Cous Cous is basically just tiny pasta..   a heap of marinara and some parmesan is pretty good too.
budgetfood,3dtqsy,1xl,2,Sun Jul 19 18:53:29 2015 UTC,"A teaspoon of Harrisa Paste is one of my quick favourites, Have you tried dried fruits and different herb/spice combinations. Stir cooked vegetables such as roasted peppers and mushrooms into the rehydrated couscous, or toss with chopped nuts and dried fruits and flavour with a pinch of your favourite spice. Or serve cooked couscous as a dessert, sweetened with ground cinnamon. Garden Peas, feta cheese and fresh mint is going in the cous cous I am serving with my BBQ butterflied leg of lamb tonight."
budgetfood,3dtqsy,captainmagictrousers,2,Sun Jul 19 11:38:23 2015 UTC,I might try the cooked veggies and the mint/feta suggestion - sounds delicious! Thanks :)
budgetfood,3dtqsy,dessininja,3,Sun Jul 19 11:45:06 2015 UTC,I like this couscous chickpea salad a lot.
budgetfood,3dtqsy,aomil,2,Sun Jul 19 12:50:31 2015 UTC,I cook in chicken broth and add (canned) diced tomatoes and boiled green peas. Top with a little Parmesan cheese and fresh chopped parsley.
budgetfood,3dtqsy,psychojeremy,2,Sun Jul 19 13:01:13 2015 UTC,"In addition to the stock tips people have already mentioned, in a small fry pan I cook up finely chopped onions and jalepenos in butter, then I add them to the top of the cous cous before serving."
budgetfood,3dtqsy,maudlinavis,2,Sun Jul 19 15:27:27 2015 UTC,"Vinegar, garlic, onion, lime, cumin, mustard powder, salt, butter, cream, chipotle/hot-sauce, any of the above. Whatever your favorite seasoning is will work."
budgetfood,3dtqsy,respoke,2,Sun Jul 19 16:00:51 2015 UTC,In addition to cooking with broth rather than water i love to take a small jar of marinated artichoke hearts and dump that in juices and all. Adds oil and herbs and delicious artichokes. :)
budgetfood,3dtqsy,buttsiethecat,2,Sun Jul 19 16:43:43 2015 UTC,slightly friend chorizo chunks mixed in with couscous is a good way to jazz it up.
budgetfood,3dtqsy,tochirov,2,Sun Jul 19 17:41:40 2015 UTC,I like adding left over tomato sauce or a can of stewed tomatoes when I cook it. Also whatever veggies that I have it to fridge/freezer. Sometimes I'll even brown a bit of ground meat (beef or turkey) and add that in when I'm using pearl couscous.
budgetfood,3dtqsy,dalikin,2,Sun Jul 19 18:00:30 2015 UTC,"Cous Cous also goes excellent as a salad topping..  bed of greens, pile of couscous, whatever you like in salad and Girard's Champagne Salad Dressing.  Bam.   healthy.. super tasty thats three i've given you."

budgetfood,3dtqsy,MrSnippets,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:17:41 2015 UTC,"I just made some awesome stuffed tomatoes with couscous!  What you'll need: 8 oz smoked gouda or smoked cheddar, shredded  5-6 strips of bacon, fried up crisp and chopped  1 onion, diced  10 oz bag of spinach, chopped coarsely  6 medium tomatoes, with the insides scooped out, with 1.5 cups of their juice in reserve (I usually just get lazy and buy tomato juice instead)  1 c. of couscous  Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees and set the rack to the middle position. Fry up the onions until yellow and translucent with a little olive oil. Add the chopped fresh spinach by the handful until cooked down. Dump the couscous into the pan, and then add the reserved tomato juice. Allow to sit on low for a few minutes, until the couscous cooks fully. Mix in the shredded cheese and bacon bits. Stuff this mixture into the scooped-out tomatoes. Stick in the oven for 20 minutes. Enjoy!"

budgetfood,3dtqsy,taffy-nay,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:33:38 2015 UTC,"Not strictly budget, but my mother makes an awesome cous-cous salad, served warm or cold.  Toast some sesame seeds and the dry cous cous in a dry pan. When they start to brown, you're in the right area, but don't let them go too far. Add a tin of drained chickpeas, a handful of raisins and a couple of tsp of spices (if you can, get some ras-el-hanout. Not a specific spice, but a mix that will vary from place to place, like a garam masala. It's Moroccan in origin, which fits this perfectly). Add the water, and leave aside for 5 or 6 minutes. Finally, add some chopped coriander (cilantro across the pond) and mix everything together.   Either serve now, or put some cling film (saran wrap I think you guys call it) over the bowl and leave to sit for a bit, as it should make the cous-cous grains big and fluffy if they sit and steam for a bit."

budgetfood,3dq4h6,ToiletSpiders,3,Sat Jul 18 15:16:37 2015 UTC,"I think whatever has defrosted, you could cook today. Just don't try to refreeze your fish and mince."
budgetfood,3dq4h6,thirteenthirty7,2,Sat Jul 18 22:12:36 2015 UTC,"i wouldn't risk the mince no. It is one of the high risk foods for storage and prep.   Rice and pasta believe or not are terrible. Or at least in their cooked state. If you want to cool it for a salad, please put them in something like a baking dish so you can spread it out thin and get it straight in the fridge. It needs to be very evenly cooled. It is often contaminated with little spores which aren't in the slightest bit bothered by boiling but will actually be activated by it. You won't kill them by quick cooling, but you will stop them reproducing towards dangerous levels. Both cooked pasta and rice should only be kept for a maximum of 3 days. After this, even in the fridge, those spores will definitely be at food poisoning levels."
budgetfood,3domnp,seaweed_is_cool,18,Fri Jul 17 23:55:57 2015 UTC,As promised…more balls.  Well..um..they were balls before they went in the oven….does that still count?   There are more than just Pizza Balls here but I wanted the title to be consistent with the other posts.   Dough: Make your own dough or buy a Jiffy box. I like this recipe though http://www.mymundaneandmiraculouslife.com/foodie-fridays-easy-peesy-french-bread/  Filling: Sauce and Cheese (get creative!)  Make a mini pizza about the size of your hand with the cheese clumped in the middle and then wrap it up like a flower blossoming backwards. (This is the only way I can describe it….ill clarify if need be.)   The other balls depicted are Zucchini Goat Cheese Bread Balls and Butter Sugar Bread Balls.   Edit: Here's what they look like opened up. http://i.imgur.com/5aIrSB2.jpg

budgetfood,3dphzw,threefishblue,7,Sat Jul 18 04:55:53 2015 UTC,When I make bulk food I find I have to season it like a madman so I don't get sick of it. What'd you make? Maybe someone on here will know a way to spice it up cheap if you try it again
budgetfood,3dphzw,501st_legion,13,Sat Jul 18 09:21:28 2015 UTC,"When I make anything in bulk that isn't closed up like a burrito, I season/spice the final result very lightly if at all before freezing, and simply add the spices to the reheated portions as I go.   It lets me keep using one batch of, say, chicken alfredo, with slightly different taste profiles each time. I might opt for pepper and salt one night, hot chili seasoning another night, curry spice a third, etc... Easy not to get bored."
budgetfood,3dphzw,johhan,2,Sat Jul 18 15:47:06 2015 UTC,Additions can also help.  Caramelize some onion one night.  Grill some chiles another night.

Stuff them with mozzarella or pressed tofu or even veggies. Very damn good. They'll be about 1/3 larger than a golf ball if you do it right, so 2-3 per person."

Chicken thighs, seasoned with salt and pepper, on the George Foreman, and some instant mashed potatoes in the microwave. The chicken can rest while you do the potatoes. Maybe stick some frozen veggies in after the potatoes.  Grilled cheese and tomato soup.   Quesadillas and refried beans.  Grilled chicken and asparagus or zucchini. Or just grilled up a few chicken breasts/thighs and toss them on a salad for lunch, or in a wrap (also grillable!).  Bacon on a GF is awesome...maybe some BLTs?   Oatmeal. Omelettes or egg scrambles with cheese and veggies on the skillet.   For dessert, you could find a recipe for a microwave mug cake, and grill some pineapple on the GF.  I know a lot of these suggestions take the use of two appliances, but cooking in stages is sadly necessary sometimes. Hope this helps a little!"

Make sure the pan is very hot before putting the wraps on. NO OIL - just a dry pan.  Cook the wraps on either side until you see goldeny goodness (aprox. 1 min on each side)  Note on the cheese: I am going to add more cheese next time and wrap it better so it all sticks together better. The picture doesn't look great but it tastes amazing.  Note on the meat mixture:  If you have a food processor I like to buy Morning Star Meat Crumbles and Sausage Links and Puree them together for 10 seconds. It gives it a better texture imo. One bag lasts many meals. Or use real meat (but that's more expensive)."

budgetfood,3dbie5,Roger-Croft,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:48:27 2015 UTC,I find that a dab of butter adds flavor and crisps the tortilla nicely. A small dab before each side. I like this ingredient mixture... looks tasty!

Mix with cooked rice and all spice. It tastes better the next day but obviously you can eat it immediately. This is just a faster way of making traditional stuffed grape leaves."

budgetfood,3d5mwg,cobainsdragon,27,Mon Jul 13 18:39:19 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! Everything you can get in those frozen bags you'll be able to make easily. The majority of things will freeze well and also reheat well and they'll be much healthier.  I does seem like you're using the frozen bags for most meals, so I'm assuming that you don't already have a fully stocked pantry/spice rack. Your first few trips may become more expensive than usual because there are a few staples you'll find yourself picking up, but once you get that settled it will jump back into being easy on the budget.   You can also look through the posts here, on /r/cooking, /r/slowcooking, and /r/eatcheapandhealthy. Definitely make sure to check out /r/mealprepsunday. The basis of that sub is cooking all meals for the week on one day and then freezing, so everything there is really good for what you're looking for.   Here's a list of some basic recipes like what you're looking for. For some of them, if it doesn't seem like quite enough, you can double all of the ingredients.    Meat Lasagna. It's not in the recipe, but I suggest adding chopped spinach or very finely cut bell peppers to each layer for some vegetables. Totally unnoticeable when it's all done. Also, definitely get the ""no boil"" kind of noodles. It's so much easier.  Easy One pan Chicken Alfredo. You can add in steamed broccoli at the end, or chop up some spinach cook down with the pasta.  Cavatelli and broccoli. You can add in either some sauteed shrimp or cooked chicken for a meat.  Shrimp Scampi. You can use chicken instead of shrimp if they're not big on seafood. Would be good with salad on the side."

I've been thinking about freezer cooking lately to both save money, make healthier meals, and stop complaining that it's too hot to cook (which mostly has to do with standing over a hot stove prepping for an hour)."
budgetfood,3d5mwg,blossomteacher,5,Tue Jul 14 12:15:43 2015 UTC,"You might look into freezer cooking or once a month cooking. You can freeze together your veggies, uncooked chicken (or cooked ground beef) and seasonings/sauce. Or entire casseroles. Then just thaw in the fridge the day you want to cook, throw it in the oven or crock pot, and cook your pasta or rice fresh. There are TONS of recipes, blogs, shopping lists, etc.  From what I've read and fiddled with, precooking your pasta (if not in a saucy casserole) and freezing it is problematic. But perhaps someone out there has figured that out!"

budgetfood,3d5mwg,d_mented,3,Mon Jul 13 21:17:29 2015 UTC,I wouldn't freeze the pasta but you could definitely boil it off on Sunday and keep it in the fridge until you need it. Add a little (few drops) oil to keep them from sticking and put them in a zip lock. Just cook it until still slightly firm and heat it up in the pan with whatever else.

Then pile on cooked burger (OR cooked hamburgers which you have cut into wedges) and American cheese. I get a block from the deli and shred it. Stick that in until it's heated,. Garnish with minced onion, pickles, and shredded lettuce. If you want to be really authentic, brush your pizza crust with egg white and sprinkle with sesame seeds.

You may very well have pulled off a good bit of budget food-finding in your area, but in many parts of the US it looks like you overspent.  Admittedly, I live in the opposite of a food desert (Houston is usually the most obese city in the US for a reason), but between the nearest $.99 Only Store and Walmart, I can replicate that box for >$10 (unless that jar is something unusual and you have something other than garlic in that bag).  Now, if I went to a farmer's market and tried to pick up these veggies from one of the local organic farms, I might end up spending this much.

budgetfood,3d0gba,d_mented,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:15:58 2015 UTC,"You could make a chickpea curry. Fry onion and garlic. Sprinkle in cumin, turmeric, garam masala and some kind of chilli (I used dried flakes). Add a tin of chickpeas and a tin of chopped tomatoes and simmer for 5 mins. Serve with rice mix with lentils for added protein and fibre.   Meat such as chorizo keeps well. You could make a kind of paella with it and rice. Fry the chorizo with no oil! Let the juices come out into the pan a bit then add in diced onion and pepper. Fry on low for a couple of mins then stir in rice and paprika. Then add a mug of chicken or veg stock. Stir occasionally and add a bit more water if it all evapourates before the rice is soft.   You will probably only cook half of the chorizo with one meal for both of you. The other half can be fried with some onion, chopped potatoes, a tin of chopped tomatoes and a tin of veg such as sweet corn. Cook the chorizo, onions and potatoes then add the peppers and tomatoes, then add corn when everything else is nearly done.   You can also cook noodles with onions, peppers and tinned veggies such as mushrooms and sweet corn. Try and find a packet of stir fry sauce which is low enough in sodium.  You could also take pasta, pasata/tinned chopped tomatoes, onions and tinned corn etc. And maybe a few herbs and spices and have that one night.

budgetfood,3cty40,jayjaywalker3,6,Fri Jul 10 21:44:03 2015 UTC,"Some people would say the amount of bread in each of these is too much. The marinara sauce has a surprising amount of sugar.

budgetfood,3coek9,Raoul_Duke,-3,Fri Jul 10 00:15:28 2015 UTC,"This is how I cook and I'm not poor. If you can afford it, instead of a rice cooker I'd suggest either an electric pressure cooker or a stovetop one if you have a stove. Being rich I bought a cheap induction hotplate and nicer stovetop one that is induction ready. The induction hotplate is more efficient and more performant(heats faster, cools off faster) than using a conventional range. Unless you have a commercial gas range. I bet there are commercial induction ranges that will rival them as well. Induction heating is used to process steel industrially(melting it a minute or so on a production line).  The biggest benefits of a pressure cooker are it can reduce cooking times by 1/3rd to 16th the time over conventional methods. That means you can take a shitty tough (read: cheap) cut of pork or beef and turn it into tender delicious meat in less than an hour.  The food suggestions here are a little light on protein(mostly coming from beans, which pressure cookers excel at cooking btw)."

budgetfood,3c7gr5,Meltingteeth,10,Sun Jul 5 16:33:07 2015 UTC,"Rice Congee  The main benefits of this food are that it's inexpensive, very filling and reasonably tasty. I think it's also pretty solid nutrition-wise, but I don't keep track of that. It's vegetarian, but I think some unsalted, unseasoned beef would go well in this if it was slow-cooked and tender.     Ingredients:  2.5 Cups White Rice (Long grain) - $.99  1 lb carrots (Chopped) - $1.40  4 Stalks of Green Onions (Chopped) $1.00  1 can Coconut Milk $2.50 (I used Andre Prost brand  Carnation . Target doesn't carry other reasonable brands...)  3-4 quarts of water. Eyeball thickness to taste.   3 tsp Green Curry - $2.50 for a jar, about 1/4 of jar used in this.  1 tsp Corn Starch - $ Negligible.   Season to taste with Garlic Powder, Sriracha and salt. - $ Negligible, you should have these anyway.   Total Cost: About $8.50   How To:   I cooked all of the rice separately in a rice cooker until it was done. I had the rice already cooked when I started the rest. Pour the coconut milk, corn starch, curry and water into a stock pot and set to medium-high heat. While that's heating, chop the carrots into medallions and pour into the stock. Do the same with the green onions. Wait for the soup to boil. When it starts, cover it with a lid for five minutes, stirring twice in this time.  Set the heat to medium and add white rice. If it appears too thick, add more water.  Add the garlic powder, sriracha and salt, all to taste. I season by smell, but do what you are comfortable with. Cover the pot. If you want your rice thicker, keep it on medium for a longer amount of time. Stir every few minutes during this process. Rice loves to stick. Once it's at the preferred thickness and texture (which shouldn't take more than 15 minutes), remove from heat and ladle into a bowl."

budgetfood,3bw6lc,julian3,4,Thu Jul 2 18:33:42 2015 UTC,"TVP (or Textured vegetable protein) is the industrial way of extending meat products. Keeping in the 25% range and you won't even notice. You do need some other ingredients to keep the moisture in though. Typically carrageen is used and some ""isolate"" (rice bran or even some ordinary flour would do). By the way; TVP should be a lot cheaper than meat. So make sure you source that right ;) By the btw: often cereal is used instead of TVP, barley for instance. The same moisture thing applies. Ordinary breadcrumbs can also be used to keep in moisture (along with flour)."

It's cheap, easy, and the taste goes great with most meats. You just put some rice in a dry frying pan, heat until it turns brown and black, then take it out, let it cool, then grind it either by hand or in a processor. It's used as a bulker and for flavour in a lot of Thai mince recipes. Also, it's essentially dry rice so will keep for a long long time as long as you keep it dry."
budgetfood,3bw6lc,probablyanalienbaby,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:00:06 2015 UTC,Brown rice.  A burger with 25% brown rice tastes exactly the same as a regular burger.  If you add other things to the burger for flavor you can get up to 50% brown rice without too much flavor loss.

budgetfood,3bw6lc,MissRippit,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:43:28 2015 UTC,"Spice them up. Garlic powder's a classic. Rosemary goes well with bread, so I add it to mix with the taste of the bun. You can add some heat with chili powder, go for a more regional taste with italian seasoning, a teriyaki marinade, or some cumin or taco seasoning.  You can also get a can of black beans for really cheap and mix them into the burgers to add volume. Not as cheap, but some cooked quinoa or rice will add bulk as well. You can chop up some peppers, whichever ones suit the spiciness you want to add to the burgers."

Corn, peas, and carrots diced and added to chicken and rice -fried rice. Add soy sauce in limited amounts -it is very salty.   If you feel brave: stirfry made with red pepper, carrots, broccoli, and onion is delicious with chicken or shrimp. Season with garlic, soy, and teriyaki sauces."

I use Taste.com.au to pick recipes and build a shopping list, i have it as an app on my phone which makes the shopping list portable.   Another thing to do is use international grocers for things like the rice and spices, because you can get bulk lots that really will last forever for really cheap. Like a kilo of tumeric for $5 or some such ridiculously awesome price.  As you try new recipes, buy new things to add to your spice etc collection. It's so much fun.

To be fair, it was during one of our worst droughts here in 2010 and we were on extreme water restrictions. we lost our bond over it despite a great tenancy and professional cleaning done at the end.   The new tennants there are meth heads. I feel no sympathy for the landlord what so ever."
budgetfood,3bfz3b,Tigers_Go_Rawr,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:33:23 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Seems like a rather dick move from your landlord. I'm lucky, my landlady doesn't really care what I do with the garden in the slightest, probably because the tenants before me turned it into a jungle and I've tamed it.  Could I hire you to come and kill my hedge for me then, please? I've got a hedge in my front garden I bloody hate, I've hacked it back and I'm ruthless with it but it just. won't. die.

Rice/Pasta  Beans (Canned/Dried)  Tortilla Bread  Spices  Salsa   Ground Meat (Turkey/Chicken are usually cheap)  Peppers/Onions/Broccoli   Frozen Juices (Optional)  Eggs  The above list would let you make burritos, chilis, stir-fries, stuffed peppers and a few other things, while offering enough variety of textures and flavours to keep your tongue sane. You said you've got a decently equipped kitchen, so Flour could be a good addition to your listing, as it'd expand what you can bake/enjoy (lots of fruit Loafs beyond Banana after all!).

With those I cook: Chilli con carne, chow Mein, roasted butternut squash, soups, curries and all sorts.

Avoid processed foods. They keep well, but are generally less healthy and won't keep your stomach full, despite their accessibility.  A couple easy meals: Make some kebabs with tomatoes, onion, and shrimp.  Homemade Pad Thai: rice noodles, eggs, green onions. Make the sauce with soy sauce, sesame seed oil, fish sauce, garlic and lime juice. EDIT: Also some Sriracha w/ the sauce of course.  Tikka Masala: Marinate chicken with yoghurt and spices, cook it up and make the sauce with canned spaghetti sauce and a little milk."

Get a paper bag and put a lightly dampened paper towel inside woth the veggies and grain and heat. It may not be exactly what you are used to, but it will be delicious. If you don't want bag it. Take a large microwave safe bowl and put a little water in the bottom, and put a small bowl inside with the grain and veggies and cover it and nuke it."

Hard veg (carrot, potatoes, turnips) will keep for a week or so if you have a shady spot to keep it in, instant stock cubes just need warm water and you can always buy meat on the day and cook it over night.   Dried soup mix, lentils and rice can be stored in old jars or wrap an elastic band round the bag to stop spills or bugs getting in.  Couscous is great - all you need is hot water and a bowl. Add some dried fruit, pre-chopped salad or dry herbs/spices to pep it up. It also keeps for a day or two in a tupperware box."

If you can get one with replaceable inserts, sometimes they come with a flat insert that you can cook eggs in. If not, a cheap waffle iron/grilled cheese maker is great for making food in. I've made omelets in my grilled cheese maker (it came with flat inserts that work wonders). Also if you can get a big George Foreman, they cook bacon absolutely perfectly for sandwiches, and it drains the grease, so win-win. Eggs are relatively cost effective (its less than 3 bucks a dozen at my local corner store, and that lasts for 3 meals with some cheese and/or spices)  here are some pics that might help you out.  George foreman with inserts: http://www.mommylivingthelifeofriley.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/SAM_0504.png  great for both eggs and bacon, but not at the same time.  Here is a waffle iron with inserts, its basically the same concept as the george foreman, just typically smaller: http://www.rainydaymagazine.com/RDM2011/RainyDayKitchen/Cuisinart/WaffleIron/RemoveGrillPlates.jpg  Well i hope i shed some light on some electric appliances you might consider for future meals! BTW this whole time i've had a stove, but i use these because they're easy. They're easy because of the removable inserts. Those are a huge timesaver as you don't have to carefully clean the entire device.

The cheapest I've found is to grab some bacon, a can of condensed cream of mushroom (or potato works well) and a sweet potato. I had milk already (for the soup). Total came out to 8 bucks.   I dice up 4 slices of bacon, cook them,  remove the bacon, then cook the soup in the same pan with the bacon fat. It gives it a smokey flavor and silky texture.   I cut the sweet pot into chunks, boiled with a bit of salt, mashed, then smear it around a martini glass. It just looks cool and is fun to slurp at the end.  Garnish with a piece of crisp bacon to scrape up the sweet potato sides!  Edit: I put cream of broccoli instead of mushroom. It is cream of mushroom. However both would work."

While not exactly a budget thing to do, adding just cooked egg whites (but not the yolk) is a low calorie way to increase the protein in a dish, which seems to help keep me feeling full for longer  - 17 calories for 1 egg white vs 78 for 1 entire egg.  I make scrambled egg whites for breakfast mixed with veggies such as onion, mushrooms, tomato, and spinach.   Needing protein seems to be why I mainly feel hunger pangs during the day (I eat a lot of vegetarian dishes as a low budget strategy), so lentils as jewelledhunter mentioned are good (and tasty!) for me to add to dishes, or I also like butter beans (1 can 120 calories, 7g protein, very tasty and filling in a pasta-type sauce or casserole).

Question yourself if you are really hungry or just really would like some food. Distract yourself if you're not really hungry yet. Vegetables. Tons of vegetables. It's really hard to eat a lot of calories from vegetables. Fruit works good too. Eat some soup, especially with lot of vegetables and no creamy stuff. If you eat some soup before dinner, you'll automatically eat less.  Not a food, but eat slowly and focussed. Your stomach-brain-communication needs some time to realize you're eating and send the message that you've eaten enough.   Also important; watch that you don't eat too calorie dense food. Look at the labels. If you eat relative caloriedense food, you can eat less calories the rest of the day, thus less food and more hunger.   And check out /r/1200isplenty for more ideas.

budgetfood,3anx6n,ReanLu,3,Mon Jun 22 19:10:11 2015 UTC,"Ground meat is very easy to 'pad' with vegetables, adding extra fiber and nutrition. When I have leftover steamed vegetables, I like to blend them with pureed pumpkin and then add them to meatloaf (approx 0.3-0.4lbs puree per 3lbs of meat - I freeze portions in plastic bags and defrost when needed) for a fiber boost. If you don't tend to have leftovers, buy some cheap chopped broccoli - the kind that comes frozen in bricks - defrost and blend with the pumpkin. I use whole wheat breadcrumbs and an egg white to bind.  For things like burgers, stroganoff, tacos and anything that doesn't need binding, I use finely grated carrot and finely grated, peeled broccoli stem. You could probably use other raw, 'hard' vegetables like zucchini, depending on what's cheap. Just squeeze to remove any excess water, mix it in with your raw meat, and add a little extra seasoning to compensate.  Also, whole grains. Brown rice is cheap and becomes more palatable if you soak it overnight with a tablespoon of unflavored yogurt or vinegar in the water, then rinse and cook the next day. Whole Wheat Pasta and Wholegrain Egg Noodles are pretty easy to find in my experience. A modest portion of whole grains - along with a vegetable like broccoli, and some kind of protein - will help keep you satisfied for longer."

Making an assumption here: You've probably have never had to experience real hunger; your body is just adapting to the new routine.  Now that doesn't mean that it's easy... Obviously it's going to be uncomfortable!! But for me, it took a lot of will power and self control to not give in to those pangs and realize they were a temporary frustration that I just had to deal with, rather than looking for a quick fix!!

I'll cook a can of cannellini beans in some spices and add in about half with a squirt of siracha if I need a fuller meal. The soup itself is like 100 calories per 2 cups and very filling.

Cabbage is really cheap and stays fresh for a long time in the crisper, and zucchini is super easy to grow so we always have more than we can eat (it's also pretty cheap at the store and lasts a long time in the fridge).  I think they are both really versatile as well. You can steam/saute/grill/boil and in some cases eat raw to get a wide variety of flavors/textures.

When I was in college and was only cooking for me, I'd often get a big package of boneless, skinless chicken breasts and cut them in half if they were thick (or leave them as is), then individually bag and freeze each portion. Defrost one at a time & bake or grill with spices, serve with a big portion of green veggies on the side like broccoli or roasted asparagus and it's an easy way to monitor portion sizes. I think Perdue sells individually wrapped chicken breasts that are frozen, but doing it on your own is cheaper :)  Also any recipe that has ground beef in it, I'll use 1lb of ground beef + package of Bella mushrooms finely chopped (food processor may be best) and you've doubled the amount of ""meat"" you have.

When using TVP, you first need to rehydrate it by adding hot water, and let it sit for 5 minutes, then drain. If you're making taco meat etc, you would then add your spices and pan fry. For the ceviche, just cool it down after you hydrate and drain, and add all of your ingredients. Best to chill in the fridge for a bit afterwards.

Oatmeal w/ soymilk, raisins, maple syrup, and 1/4 scoop pea protein. Roughly 15g protein and 325 calories. Costs $1.50 per serving.  Kashi Go-Lean cereal w/ 1/2 cup soymilk.

Approx. 15g protein, 200 calories, and $1.50 per serving (if you get a 32oz carton of greek yogurt/cottage cheese).  Lunch and Dinner:  Any combo of rice, beans (or legumes), vegetables and herbs/spices (for flavor).   You want to eat meals with complete proteins (proteins that provide the 20 essential amino acids). Beans and rice are a good combo, as are beans and pasta. Most of these combos will give you about 15-20g of protein w/ 300-400 calories per serving, for around $2-3 per serving.  Beans, rice, tomatoes, onions, green peppers, corn, cayenne, chili powder, cilantro, lime juice, and salt. Cook rice according to directions, drain and rinse black beans from a can. Dice vegetables and sautee until tender, add in beans, cook until heated through, add spices, herbs, and rice.  Pasta e fagioli. Pasta and bean soup. Recipe here.  Vegetable curry w/ rice and lentils  Lentil ""sloppy joes"" with carrots, onions, and green peppers.  More recipes here.  Just remember to eat plenty of protein, be it from beans, legumes, vegetables, grains, or tofu. Nix the almond milk (barely any protein or other nutrition) in favor of soymilk or hemp milk.

budgetfood,3a72a0,gmwrnr,3,Thu Jun 18 10:39:45 2015 UTC,"Get a can of black beans (less than a dollar per can) and make veggie burgers. Just mash them up, add in whatever other burger fillings you want (some spice like chili pepper, vegetables like diced onion or peppers, etc.), and form the mixture into patties. You can freeze the patties and cook them in 10min whenever you want them.  My advice for cooking them is not to disturb the patties as they cook. They fall apart really easily. So oil up the pan, cook for maybe 5 minutes per side (there's no actual cooking required, since the beans are already safe to eat), and while it cooks, kind of wiggle the pan around every once in a while. The whole patty should slide freely, and it keeps any part of it from getting stuck to the pan and causing the patty to break. It's easiest to just slide the burger from the pan onto the bun when it's done, and it helps to take a slice of cheese and just sit it on top of the burger to melt at the end.  Veggie burgers can be made in all kinds of ways. You can top them like a regular burger, add salsa to bring out the black bean flavor, make them spicy with sriracha or cool them down with ranch. The possibilities are endless."

budgetfood,3a72a0,bigc04,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:20:08 2015 UTC,"Spaghetti has to be one of the most filling and cheapest meals you can make.  $2 for a bag of spaghetti or whatever pasta you like. $1 a can of tinned tomatoes. $2 for a bit of garlic. $1 for a bag of oregano $2 for a small bag of salt, and pepper  The garlic, oregano, salt and pepper will last you for another 10-20 meals, so it's almost negligible.  Basically you can make a big meal of pasta for about $8. And the entire bag of pasta (500g) should get your at least 2 servings, or 3 smaller servings if you're a light eater.  I usually buy a few small rolls of bread at the end of the day from the bakery who sells them crazy cheap so they don't have to thrown them out the next day. Use some of the garlic with some butter or perhaps olive oil and make garlic bread quickly under the grill.  This basically takes the meal to $10, but with 3 small servings and garlic bread, you're basically getting a decent lunch, dinner and lunch the next day for about $9.30  I'm going by Australian pricing."

Veg, when still in one piece, will typically last quite a while too. But try to find a shaded spot to save food stuffs, perhaps even bury it (well protected, of course).  After a week, you're looking at protein bars and trail mix. Unless you can find a store in the area, in which case you can buy stuff for a salad meal (different types of lettuce, mixed with tomatoes, cucumbers and a mix of vinegar and oil, topped with nuts for the protein)."

More canned stuff: Don't go crazy with the tuna, because of the mercury content. You're only supposed to have it once a week or so. Salmon pouches can be pretty good, albeit a bit pricey. Other canned goods that are okay at room temperature: refried beans, baked beans, corn, baby corn, canned peaches/pears/""tropical medley."" Apple sauce is also good. Try to pick no-sugar-added varieties.  Dairy: I know Americans are super into refrigeration, but lots of hard cheeses can be pretty good at room temperature (or in a cooler) for a while. I'm not very careful with how I store gouda and it always stays tasty as long as it's well-wrapped.    Also, dried fruit has almost no nutritional value and isn't very filling for the calories.

budgetfood,3a1c5k,Truly_Impressed,11,Tue Jun 16 13:33:24 2015 UTC,"Where are you? What stores are available to you? Are you in a city or rural?  For seasonings, I like soy, fish-sauce, worchester sauce, siracha.  Asian supermarkets usually have larger bottles for reasonable prices. Also, rice and noodles are available there for less (in terms of unit prices) and large bags of spices are available for reasonable prices.  For spices/herbs, pepper (aldi do a large pack of black peppercorns), mixed dried Italian herbs  (lidl/aldi), garam masala (indian spice mix (cumin, coriander and so on), available in packs of up to 1kg in asian stores), smoked paprika (tesco do it, very tasty, great in chilli/jambalaya, good with chicken), chilli powder (asian store again).  If you like desserts now and again, consider some vanilla essence and some ""mixed spice"" (usually a mix of cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, ginger and so on). It  makes delicious french toast. A little (!) can add an interesting hint to a chilli.  Raisins/Sultanas are nice and they keep. Cans/small packs of Coconut milk can dress up a curry and is pretty reasonable from asian stores.  Fresh ginger will keep for ages in the fridge. To use it, I find the easiest way is to peel about a cm and grate it (rather than chopping it up). Ginger&garlic (together) go really well with chicken and Indian food. Wrap in in a sheet of kitchen paper and keep it in a ziploc bag to prevent it overwhelming everything in the fridge.  Sealed packs of parmesan cheese (aldi) can be stored in the freezer and can be grated directly from frozen (you only need a little). It adds a nice savoury note to omelettes or pasta sauces. As long as you keep the air out, it will keep for ages in the freezer.  Ziplock bags (aldi) or clothes-pegs are probably more cost effective for keeping bags of spices fresh in the short term. Also, keep stuff in the fridge even if it would probably keep in a cupboard (soy, siracha, fish sauce). If you buy a large bag of spices, zip-loc the excess and put it in the freezer.  Unless your knife is terrible, I'd leave it, but if it is terrible, tesco do a cheap 6-inch chef's knife that does the trick. It's up to you to learn to sharpen it though. Sharpness is the real key. If you don't have any method of sharpening it, a mug will do in a pinch with a bit of patience  Porridge for breakfast is cheap and filling. Add a pinch of salt while it's cooking.  To dress it up, you can add raisins while it's cooking or add other fruit (sliced bananas, diced apple etc.), nuts, seeds or jam afterwards. A little mixed-spice works too.  Egg fried rice is tasty, easy and filling. All it needs is some small combination of onions/mushroom/peppers/broccoli/grated carrot/chilli pepper, ginger&garlic, a little meat (chicken/port/bacon/even sliced ham), soy/fish sauce, frozen peas, sweetcorn.  Also, watch for meat and vegetable offers in stores and plan your meals for the week in advance using the offers."

budgetfood,3a1c5k,femmeflowers,2,Tue Jun 16 21:02:28 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to think of the ""cheap"" spices you can usually find here for $1-2US(for the budget friendly ones), and also ones that are used commonly and are versatile. With that said; cayenne pepper, cumin, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, red pepper flakes, oyster sauce, fish sauce, soy sauce, sriracha style sauce(or another hot sauce), lemon juice, or some type of vinegar for acidity(i.e apple cider and white are cheapest), powdered ginger and thyme are a portion of what I use regularly, and do not harm the wallet to badly.  Edit- Also, when I was in culinary school one of the teachers swore by his ""salt n pepper"" mix, and used it in/on basically everything. It was equal parts salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder. Moisture will eventually cause it to harden because it does not have anti-caking agents but you can easily keep it sealed for a week or two."

Cumin is something I don't necessarily care about in terms of taste, but everything else is spot on. I already shopped around a little and found a neat asian market nearby that'll have a bulk sale for soy sauce the coming weekend. If I'm lucky then I might be able to pick up some fish sauce as well, I'll have to see what they offer.   Do you have any tips on storing these spices? 'Back in the day' I mostly just kept the bags around - I found that the bags are often cheaper than small plastic tins. But then again that might be worth it if I don't have to purchase any addons for storage.  The salt'n'pepper-mix sounds interesting! I tend to keep a bag of onions around since they are really cheap, but that might make it worth it to pick up onion powder if I can get it relatively cheap :)"

It's not exactly inexpensive to buy dry, but you can grow some if you have a garden or a place to put a box with soil in, provided you live somewhere where the climate is favorable.

You could even mix all that in with the peanut butter to give it a thai feel. then combine the noodles/veggies/chicken/eggs for a delish stir fry!  You should also look into making your own crust and you could do an easy chicken pot pie. use those veggies, chicken, and italian seasoning, boullion cube and flour to thicken it...then do a flour/butter crust.

Pita Bread - I didn't manage to make awesome pocket type pita but they tasted legit and got the job done. :)  Hummus - first attempt! Next time I'll add more water, it dries out a bit after being in the fridge. I also used sunflower seeds instead of tahini paste because sunflower seeds are way cheaper.  The taziki sauce was store bought but I hear it's also super easy to make and if you're making falafel they have some crossover ingredients.   I also used a dried bag of chickpeas (or garbanzo beans, I really think they're same thing different regional name) and soaked the entire bag over night then I separated the soaked chickpeas in half. I used half for the falafel and half for the hummus. It yielded a lot of both. I froze the leftover falafels and plan on eating the rest of the hummus as a cheap snack with the rest of the pita before they start to go bad."

budgetfood,39tfs6,Gustyarse,21,Sun Jun 14 16:39:46 2015 UTC,"Get a small pot of water on the boil, well salted.  Unlike most guys, I advocate using 3 to 4 times as much water as pasta - NOT a huge pot, as people traditionally do.  When water is boiling, add spaghetti, no oil.  Just make sure to occasionally stir.  Stick a small frying pan onto the stove, heat her up.  You can use a small amount of olive oil if you wish, probably not required.  Pancetta, bacon lardons, chopped up cheap bacon - whatever you've got, throw it in the pan and leave it on a medium low sizzle for a bit.  Whisk two whole eggs and one egg yolk together with salt and pepper.  To this add about a handful of grated parmigiano reggiano or any hard cheese you like, whisk it up again.  When the spaghetti is done, remove your frying pan from the heat, then from the pasta water reserve a small cupful.  Now you see why I recommend using very little water: its starchier than it would be with gallons of the stuff.  Put the spaghetti straight into the pan with the meat and mix it up.  Pour the egg/cheese mixture into the pan over the spaghetti and mix well with as much reserved pasta water as you think will work best.  The residual heat from the pasta & water will cook the eggs.  You do not want the eggy mix to receive too much heat, or you will get scrambled egg pasta.  Serve immediately into a lightly warmed bowl - normally I would use some hot water from the kettle and fill the bowl with it prior to mixing the carbonara; pour out the water just before serving and you have a nice warm bowl, makes all the difference ;)  It's little things like heated bowls etc that can transform simple little meals."

budgetfood,39tfs6,silverlaser,2,Sun Jun 14 16:54:04 2015 UTC,"I find that using more than an egg and a half leaves the sauce a bit soupy. Usually I use one egg, and depending on how much pasta I have, I add in a yolk. You then get Carbonnara, rather than Carbonnara soup, as I call it."

You've actually given me an idea.  Next time, I'll use the same method but tilt the pan at the end and use tongs to extract the carbonara, leaving excess sauce in the pan which I can then use for something else!"
budgetfood,39tfs6,Grumpy_Frenchman,2,Sun Jun 14 17:44:19 2015 UTC,"What's your reasoning behind not using more water?  In my experience, if I don't use enough water it can prevent the pasta from moving around with the boil which makes them stick together and cook unevenly."
budgetfood,39tfs6,I_Like_Spaghetti,6,Mon Jun 15 05:10:18 2015 UTC,"Another version, delicious, if maybe (well, definitely) not as healthy.  Cook spaghetti as desired, pour into a strainer, run cold water over it.  In your now empty pot put chopped bacon (or ham, or pancetta, or smoked sausage). Cook it until at the desired doneness, and drain most of the fat.    Deglaze with a bit of white wine, and throw in some heavy cream (say, half a cup or so). Add some white pepper, black pepper, salt, and a good bit of grated parmesan. Add a spoonful of sour creme.  Toss in the sgetti, and mix it up over heat until it is hot.    Turn off the heat. Toss in a whole egg per person, mix it up, and serve.  Bonus variations: cook some chopped onions and mushrooms prior to adding the wine and cream.  Second bonus: add some cayenne pepper to the sauce  Third bonus: top with lots of melty cheese.  I prefer swiss.  And final bonus: add a splash of balsamic vinegar in your bowl and mix in right before eating.  I don't know, it just works.  This one reheats splendidly as well.  Sorry u/Gustyarse, didn't mean to hijack your post!  I'll try yours if you try mine :P"

Chicken Tortilla Soup --  Marinate and slow cook chicken thighs (3 hrs on high, 6 on low) with store-bought fajita mix, shred chicken and set aside.   Grab stock pot and saute a few cloves of garlic, an onion, and a bell pepper (I've substituted a habanero) with some oil for a few minutes.   Add four cups of chicken broth, 2-3 cups of water, and a can of tomato sauce (fire roasted if on sale).   Add a can of drained black beans, about the same amount of refried beans, and the shredded chicken.   Stir all the ingredients together, increase heat to boiling, then immediately reduce and let simmer for 10-15 minutes.   Add soup to bowls and shred a few toasted tortillas on top. Enjoy!

budgetfood,39ixuo,Pandabear811,17,Fri Jun 12 01:15:15 2015 UTC,"I'm the youngest of four (all close in age, all althetes in high school simultaneously), so our family got pretty good at feeding a large number of hungry teenagers on a budget. I'm assuming you have slow cooker - it's life saver when you're cooking for an army.  The biggest thing will be planning meals so that you use all of an ingredient (aka get a ham, eat ham sandwiches and then use ham bone in soup). My family always made loads of food and planned on using leftovers in other meals (and/or eating the leftovers again, depending on who was eating it - I love leftovers, two of my brothers refuse to touch them).  Also, (it seems like you're doing this, but to reiterate) beans can be a good substitute. Red lentils are great - they cook super fast, they're cheap and they can be used in place of ground meat (or in addition depending on how picky your eaters are). We did red lentil spaghetti sauce (cook lentil in boiling water until soft, mix with tomato sauce, add spices) and sloppy joes (basically same sauce on hamburger buns). This can be used for lasagne or baked ziti as well.  Also taco night was a huge thing at our house. Cook dried beans (either pinto or black - toss into slow cooker with ~8 cups of water, cook for 6 hours), mash half with cheese mixed in (makes a little cheese go along way), season the other half with taco seasoning. Serve with tomato, lettuce, cheese, sour cream. On side have rice with tomato + spices mixed in. Layer beans with tortillas, veggies, cheese and salsa and stick in casserole dish in oven until cheese melts for ""mexican lasagne"".  We did a lot of Indian food - chickpeas are a great base (cook similarly to pinto/black beans above), add tomato sauce, curry powder and whatever bits of veggies are leftover (cut into really small pieces if you are trying to convince your kids they aren't there, otherwise leave large). Repeat with lentils or with chicken thigh. Serve over rice.  If your kids will like, add spinach to curry, though that's harder to hide.  Stew meat can be found for cheap. Its a lower quality meat but you don't notice after you've had it in slow cooker for awhile. Change up the sauce you make it with - beef stock + potato/carrot/onion and you've got beef stew; ketchup + ginger ale + onion makes a sweet/sticky thing that's really yummy.   Chicken in slow cooker can be done lots of ways - cream of (whatever) soup, bbq sauce, salsa, italian salad dressing. Serve in sandwiches, over pasta or over rice to add lots of bulk and keep things interesting.  If your family really wants more meat, go for things that add big flavor so that you use less of them - make eggs with chorizo, or add a bit of sausage to a tomato sauce.  In terms of snacking (teenagers), we always had cheese sticks, carrots, popcorn, bananas, apples. Cookies (typically oatmeal ones - add oats + bananas +chocolate/raisins and bake - super easy for any of us to make after practice). Bread for toast. Lots of quick breads - zucchini, banana nut - any leftover fruit/veg were typically hidden in this.  Lots of soup, mostly as a way to use up odds and ends. Stock made of veggie bits or meat bones. Rice or small bits of pasta to add substance. Split pea soup is hearty, especially when served with bread (bread bowls make it fun)."
budgetfood,39ixuo,rominion,6,Fri Jun 12 03:00:04 2015 UTC,"Also I forgot to answer your questions- pastry flour isn't the best for bread, but is great for quick breads or cookies. Here's a quick banana bread.  Cornmeal can be used to make tortillas or used as a base for a meal (polenta/grits? mix in some cheese and spices and it's great). Also you can use when making pizza.  Learning how to make simple doughs is key - bread/pizza/rolls don't take a ton of time. No knead bread is easy - if one of us got ready for school early, we'd mix it and leave it in the fridge to finish when we got home. Here's a blog with details (and pictures of cute kid)."

Biscuits are also good made with pastry flour.  Learn to make roux, which is simply flour and oil cooked together. I'm pretty sure any flour will do for roux, including your pastry flour. It adds a delicious, smoky flavor to foods, and really helps add depth to low meat and meatless meals. Save and freeze all of your broth from cooking meats for use in other meals. Boil it down to condense it. Egg noodles cooked in broth are delicious and filling, as is rice."

I'm not talkin' about Boston Butt here, but those bigass, gnarly-lookin' hunks o' pig with the skin on and a bone stickin' out. You can usually find 'em for around $.99/lb. A quick and easy way to make it is to stab the everloving shit out of it, maybe even work the knife back and forth a little to really open it up. Then squeeze a couple of limes over it, stuff your pork-holes with crushed garlic, and smother the whole thing with a generous amount of salt and pepper. Throw it in the oven at 325 for about a half-hour per pound, basting with beer or water every so-often. Finish by cranking the oven up to about 450 for a few minutes, then sprinkle cold water on the skin to make it pop. Remove pork from oven, remove skin from pork, remove pork from bone. It should pull right off and shred nicely. Caution: that skin is an artery destroyer. Your mouth will love you...your heart, not so much.  Now, if you wanna make it extra fantastic, prepare a curtido while your pork is cookin'. Slice a red onion nice and thin. Add a teaspoon or two of salt and the juice from one lemon.

Here's a good recipe:  For the cornmeal shortcake:  1 1/2 cups unbleached, all-purpose flour 1/2 cup yellow cornmeal 1 Tbs. baking powder 1 Tbs. sugar 1/2 tsp. salt 2 Tbs. chilled unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 1 cup heavy cream  For the strawberries and whipped cream:  3 cups strawberries, hulled and halved 4 Tbs. sugar, or to taste Fresh lemon juice Whipped cream (canned is cheaper)  Directions  Prepare the shortcakes: Preheat the oven to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  In a bowl, stir together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, sugar and salt. Cut in the butter with a pastry blender (or your fingers) until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the cream gradually, stirring until the mixture begins to come together. Knead briefly in the bowl until a soft, moist dough comes together into a ball. Turn the dough onto a lightly (PASTRY!!!) floured work surface and knead gently 3 or 4 times. Pat the dough into an 8 inch round, or, if you’d like individual shortcakes, into a 5 1/2 by 12 inch rectangle and cut into 6 equal squares. Transfer to the baking sheet. Bake until risen and golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Prepare the strawberries and whipped cream: In a large bowl, stir together the strawberries and 3 tablespoons of the sugar, or more to taste. Let stand for 15 minutes to let the berries juice themselves. Add lemon juice to taste, or omit it if you don't want it.  Spoon the berries and their juice over the shortcakes. Top with the whipped cream and serve right away. Serves 6."

budgetfood,39ixuo,NotQuiteVanilla,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:37:08 2015 UTC,"I shop the local small grocery here and there for about 10-15 mins at a time to pick up stuff on sale. It's on my way most of the time and I'm just adding to the pantry. They had $1/$5 fresh pork and pork was marked down for sell-by dates.. so tonight we're having pork stir fry. 1lb (or even less) of pork will easily mix in that and feed my family of 8 eaters (the baby makes 9, but he's still happily having breastmilk only at 5 months).  We mix with cabbage (also on sale), carrots, mushrooms, and seasonings.   We do fried rice semi-often - we do keep hens so we get eggs pretty cheap, though I'm downsizing to 4-5 hens so they can easily  stay cooped up in our movable pen and keep out of my garden which is what the group does if free ranging.    Airpopped popcorn is a cheap/easy snack. Soup is frequent here and the Bear Creek Farms ones are a deal. I found them for under $3 and 2 of those will feed my family with leftovers. It'd be hard to make soup that cheap and theirs is very good!  We also do baked potatoes and salad night. On the potatoes we usually have tuna or baked beans.  The trick for me is to shop sales and then shop the pantry/fridge as we make a list. We buy beef by the 1/2 cow and it's grass fed good stuff for around $5.50/lb - I have most of it cut into roasts since that's the most practical way for us to use it.   I also buy cake mixes when they're on sale for $.99/ea - my 15yo likes making them and it's a decent treat during the week for cheap and without fuss. The icing is hit or miss and most people don't care if we skip it.   We have also started to package leftovers into individual portions and tossing in the freezer. Some of the stuff we have in there now includes curry (it's overtop rice) and a hearty veggie soup. It's a good way to have a lunch or whatever without much fuss and it's good for them.. plus it nixes leftover food going bad in the fridge.   My family includes parents and kids 19g, 17g, 15b, 11b, 10b, 8g, and the baby."
budgetfood,39ihl8,KevinMcP,13,Thu Jun 11 23:10:37 2015 UTC,"Hi,  Our ""big three"" are Tesco, Sainsburys and Asda. Asda are slightly cheaper as a rule, but not by much if you're careful.   All three do various levels of pricing, a premium line, a standard line and a basic/value line.   Beyond the big three Aldi and Lidl are very cheap for a lot of things - I have found their fruit and veg to be fine, rice and pasta etc all fine - but most of their meat tastes like ass.   There are any number of ways to save money beyond the supermarkets, and I think Swansea will have pretty large meat, fish and fruit & veg markets (I'm English, never been in Swansea sober) where if you buy in bulk you can get some amazing deals.   There are also any number of ""Cash and Carry"" places which you can google. These are essentially suppliers for the non-chain shops, so you can pick up some bargains there too."

I would probably stick to things like frozen veggies, but take a look and see what you can find there. Aldi is great for vegetables and non-perishables. Out of the 'big three' that /u/Evsie mentioned, Sainsbury's is noticeably more expensive. I'd recommend Tesco for regular supermarket shopping."

As others have said, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda are standard sorts of supermarkets. I find that their budget ranges (Tesco Value, Sainsbury's Basics and Asda Smart Price) are perfectly fine - pasta, rice etc tastes much the same whether you spend 20p on it or £2.  Aldi and Lidl are known as cheaper supermarkets. There's less choice but fine if you're just cooking a bog-standard menu (don't expect to find too many unusual ingredients there).  Waitrose and Marks & Spencer are more expensive places to buy food. The quality is nicer, but not worth the price imho (but then I'm a cheapskate so what do I know)."

These meals you can have regardless of the occasion or if you want something or not. They are staple meals you know you can eat and be good with (I.E. grilled chicken and rice, burritos, etc...) These normally cost me about 5-7 dollars for the meal.   Next, get spices and learn what tastes good with what. Spices make boring food awesome. Also, learn some cooking techniques to make normal dishes awesome. (Like chicken Cordon Bleu. There are some easy recipes for it and it keeps the cost pretty low.)   Ground Turkey burgers are pretty cheap usually, and you can use the ingredients that are used in it for other things. Turkey burgers  Fried Rice, while not too healthy, can be made with just a few ingredients and it is very cheap. Easiest recipe I know is to make white rice, then refrigerate it for a day. the next day, toss that into a pan on medium high heat, open a can of mixed veggies, get it all together, and pour in some soy sauce. Don't overdo it on the soy sauce. Drop some butter in there to make sure the rice doesn't stick as well and adds some flavor. I hope these help in some way!"

But that's a personal preference. When it's on sale I'll pick up a big bag of frozen meat like tilapia or chicken breasts. Sometimes tofu is cheaper, but in my experience that's only when it's deeply on sale.   A good rule of thumb is to stick to stuff that the store stocks around its perimeter rather than in the middle of the store. That, and if you purchase something cooked/processed then you're paying for someone to make it and they'll add a bunch of stuff in the process. There's nothing wrong with that! I literally just finished the second half of a TV dinner. But just be aware and make the choice consciously.  Plus, spices go an incredibly far way to making meals better.

A tasty alternative would be to marinate and slow cook a couple of boneless thighs with a mixture of soy sauce, teriyaki, and hot sauce. After that you could shred the chicken to make a Spicy Asian Philly Cheese with some Monterey Jack slices and sriracha mayo (2 parts mayonnaise, 1 part sriracha mixed with a dash of garlic powder, lime juice, and a little cayenne or habanero)"

I badly cooked rice for years in a pot but when my wife (then girlfriend) brought her rice cooker over I realized that I had been doing it wrong.

Can't recommend it enough.    You can also do all kinds of things like put a bouillon cube and frozen peas/carrots in the rice at the beginning and make a sort of fake/easy fried rice thing.  Makes cheap, tasty food.  Edit: No idea how but the brown rice button actually works.  I also had challenges cooking brown rice and love the nutty flavor and how filling it is.  Just push the button and it comes out great.  I know I sound like an infomercial but I really think it's an amazing little machine.  Makes something that I struggled with for years so damn simple."

budgetfood,38osa9,somanynights,15,Sat Jun 6 18:33:52 2015 UTC,"In general, the less processed something is, the longer it takes to digest/leave your stomach.   So, steel-cut oats/oat groats >old-fashioned or rolled oats > quick oats.  Steel-cut oats can be tricky to find depending on where you live though. If you want to add some more body to it, add a tbsp or 2 of chopped nuts, or dried fruit.  Minute rice is pre-cooked, then dehydrated, which is why it can be mushy when the consumer re-hydrates ('cooks') it a second time.  Whole grain rice like brown, red or black is most nutritious, and will stay with you the longest.  The easiest way to cook it is to boil it like pasta- so lots of water.  Taste after 25-35 minutes, drain in a sieve when done."
budgetfood,38osa9,kanooka,16,Fri Jun 5 16:45:57 2015 UTC,General rule of thumb I always follow is 2 parts water to 1 part rice.  If you follow this rule you'll never have to drain your rice.

I've had better luck with it with the extra water + draining method. Cook's Illustrated did a good experiment with the 2 methods, and showed that 'pasta method' brown rice cooked more evenly and faster than when using the absorption method. It does make a more separated grain rather than sticky product though....YMMV!"

It's pretty forgiving to be honest, so don't stress exact levels. 3) wait.  The rice cooker will automatically switch from cook mode to keep-warm mode once the water is all absorbed/cooked off."

Peanut butter is very calorie dense, so watch your calories on that. Oatmeal (I buy old fashioned rolled oats) is great because it provides great complex carbs, a decent amount of protein, and plenty of fiber.

budgetfood,38ayix,WipeDown,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:02:22 2015 UTC,"Dried beans are the cheapest source of protein there is, but since you are a college student, canned beans. Usually you can find generic canned beans for really cheap (like 80 cents a can) and a can is typically 21-28 g of protein. If you really want to go cheap, get the dry beans (usually just over $1/lb) and soak them overnight. Bring water to a boil, put the drained and soaked beans in, simmer until they are soft. You can get a $4 bag here for about $5. That is over 400 g of protein and high in fiber.  Canned salmon is good, too, and it's high in omega 3 fatty acids as well. Around here you can get a 15 oz can for about $2.50, which is about 80 g of protein and 6 g (yes, grams) of omega 3s. I think a 7.5 oz can is about $1.50 or so. Again, go generic. They all get it from the same cannery.  Tuna isn't bad, since you can get a can for about .70 here. About 22 g of protein per can, but salmon is healthier (less mercury, more omega 3s).  You'll also want cheap carbs. White rice is as cheap as it gets. Around here, a 20 lb bag for $8. Oats are good and cheap, as is pasta.  EDIT: Canned mackerel is also a good source but a lot of people get weirded out by the bones and the taste is kind of fishy, so some people aren't big fans. I like it as a break from tuna and salmon.  Also, tilapia is usually real cheap. Swai/basa as well. Buy both frozen in bulk."

Total cost is around $12 and it generally makes 4 lunches, for about $3 each.  You can also use other types of chicken, I just prefer thighs.

It's kinda like a Middle Eastern/North African style chili, using eggs as the meat."
budgetfood,386sst,Chummers5,2,Tue Jun 2 19:10:26 2015 UTC,"I usually do a chicken and vegetable plate for lunch. The vegetables come from big blue frozen bag of California Blend seasoned with salt or lemon pepper. I cook those in a ziploc bag to help heat it up thoroughly. The chicken is from either the store-bought rotisseries or you can cook some chicken with one of those cheap marinade pouches (and bottles). Cut up the chicken after cooking to make heating easier.   After microwaving the chicken and vegetables separately, I put hot sauce on the chicken and sometimes use soy sauce on the vegetables.   EDIT: I use the vegetables as an ice pack and leave my lunch on my desk. The vegetables are usually thawed out and easier to heat at lunch time.  I would also suggest /r/mealprepsunday for ideas."

budgetfood,386sst,yoshi314,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:27:35 2015 UTC,Do you have anything at work to reheat food or do you have to eat cold food for lunch?
budgetfood,3830eh,Reek_Greyjoi,35,Mon Jun 1 14:13:55 2015 UTC,"To start with--Apply for Food Stamps and WIC, if they apply in your area, or whatever equivalents are available. They exist to help people genuinely in need. Don't feel ashamed about having to get help. Look for food banks, too. They'll probably ask for your information, but that's just to keep moochers from abusing the system. They'll give you whatever they can, which is usually enough to help you last a week (sometimes you'll get toilet paper or napkins, too).  Other advice I have is to look into foods you can buy in bulk that are, also, filling. Brown rice (NOT white!!) and dried beans are excellent for this. They're both very filling and very inexpensive on a per-serving scale. Plus, you can cook a lot at one time and store it in the fridge for lunch or part of dinner another night. Dried beans take a while, but there's a lot you can do with them. Simply adding different seasonings can completely change it up. And, you can do bean salads, or mash them (I do this with pintos to replace refried beans as a healthier alternative--not as creamy, but it's hardly noticeable by the time you add some stuff to it for a taco or burrito).  Cut back on your meats. Meats are rather expensive and can easily make a grocery bill way more than you can afford. You can find alternatives for the protein, such as beans. And, really, most people eat more meat than is necessary. A single serving of meat is roughly 3-4oz, about the size of a deck of playing cards. For just you and your husband, a half pound of meat is more than a serving for dinner. Your toddler, not eating much, can just have a few bites from your portions. You may be able to find inexpensive meats at a meat market/locally owned butcher shop. Here, we can get chicken for 69¢ a pound, or less, at the meat market, but the same cuts will cost two-three times that much elsewhere.  For produce, shop around and try to find produce stands. They may be road-side or at a flea market, but they tend to have the best prices. Additionally, buy frozen vegetables. They're harvested and packaged at their peak of freshness, so they're as good or better as fresh, and they don't take long to cook (basically just thawing them). You can find frozen fruits, too. They're mushy when thawed, but if you mix in with some oatmeal or yogurt, they're pretty good, especially for children. And, frozen foods don't have the added sodium and sugars canned do.  Look at the per-unit costs of your goods. You want to get the most for your buck, so break out the calculator and figure out if the 12oz or the 16oz pack is the better deal. Sometimes, bigger is not always better, and often, the smaller packs will cost you way more in the long run.  Others may end up suggesting coupons, and they can help save you money, but don't just buy something because you have a coupon. Odds are, whatever the coupon is for is not something you'd normally buy. And, even with a coupon, that brand may still cost more than the no-name/store brand version.  The last tip I have is to simply avoid processed foods. Yes, they're cheap. But, they do not stick with you and you end up eating more and more and getting less. A buck for a bag of chips may sound good, but that same amount of money will buy a couple apples, and half an apple will hold you over better than a whole bag of chips."
budgetfood,3830eh,sykofl,10,Mon Jun 1 15:22:54 2015 UTC,"This is great! And very motivational, thank you!   To add, I dont think I have EVER used dried beans before, only canned. As soon as my canned beans run out, Ill start getting bagged ones!  And youre right about the coupons! A few months ago, there was a certain cereal that had a coupon where everytime you buy that box of cereal, you get a free 2 litre milk with it. We thought ""great! We always need milk for our toddler, so we should do this!"" and for weeks we were buying this cereal and getting these 2 liter milks. So much money was wasted on those cereals, it would have been cheaper to do what we normally do and buy a big family sized box of plain cheerios or rice crispies or something simple and buy our regular 4 litre milk we always buy. I feel horrible not realizing these things."
budgetfood,3830eh,Hemiltonne,7,Mon Jun 1 15:59:54 2015 UTC,"Trying to cut down on processed food is also a good way to save money.  You can do a lot with Quaker Minute Oats for breakfast. Apples and cinnamon, honey and raisins, etc. Boxed cereal is rather expensive for what you're getting."
budgetfood,3830eh,Hemiltonne,5,Mon Jun 1 17:37:30 2015 UTC,"Boxed cereal has become a staple in this house and it needs to stop :( The prepackaged oatmeal too. This is the stuff I was raised on (I came from a poor family, much poorer than my husband and I have ever been). This junk was always in my house, home cooked meals were a rarity, and I never learned how to make oatmeal etc. I want to do better for my family so that we have better food and money to actually save rather than living paycheck to paycheck.  Thanks for the input! It is all very helpful!"
budgetfood,3830eh,Insane_Drako,13,Mon Jun 1 18:24:53 2015 UTC,"The irony is that when you're poor you have little time to prepare food due to work, so you end up buying more processed food that costs more money month-to-month.  I was able to slowly break that cycle by trying to cook a few things regularly (such as minute oats for breakfast) so it became quick and second nature. A lot of low cost cooking is just remembering ratios (2 cups water to 1 cup dry rice, 1 portion of quick oats is 1 cup water and half a cup oats, etc)  Good luck!  EDIT: If you guys are living paycheque to paycheque, I would really look into You Need a Budget as a budgeting system and software to keep track of household expenses. You save up a month's worth of expenses and then budget using last month's expenses, so you only spend what you have. Worth a look, Reddit is a big fan."

Good philosophy to make you think.   Also, getting off instant oatmeal packets is great. I did that. I do instant oatmeal now, just put a 1/3 cup in a bowl, pour 2/3 cup boiling water on top, rest a plate on top of that to keep some heat in. Come back a couple of minutes later and it's done. I'm a fan of putting peanut butter and craisins or raisins on top. Sometimes I get fancy and do a couple of nuggets of dark chocolate, too. Divine.

budgetfood,3830eh,coriacea,7,Tue Jun 2 03:11:20 2015 UTC,"Like I said, dried beans take a while, and it's a learning process. I've found the best results come from putting them in a pot with at least 2pt water-1pt bean and boil for a half hour; turn the burner off but leave the pot there overnight (I always start mine right after dinner); the next day, turn on a low heat (I like to set mine to a 2, a higher simmer) and let it sit. Just be sure to consistently check on them every hour to add more water, if needed. After using the dried, I'll never go back to canned. Such a better flavour!  Don't feel bad about not realizing about coupons. That's really what companies are hoping for. You get such a great 'deal' that you don't really give it any thought. And, watch BOGOs! Often times, stores increase the prices on said items, so you're really not saving any money at all. If you shop stores that offer BOGOs, keep a written log of what you normally buy and the prices so you can know if you're truly getting a deal.  For mik, you can try using powdered. If you don't like the taste, do half milk, half powdered. And, never drink it immediately after mixing. It always tastes best when chilled for a full 24 hours. But, you can mix it immediately for cooking with and not notice the difference at all. Costs more upfront, but it saves a TON of money."

budgetfood,3830eh,AlwaysDisposable,13,Tue Jun 2 02:59:55 2015 UTC,"Buy in season veggies. Frozen veggies can work out cheaper too and help to avoid waste as they won't go off in a few days. If you see a deal such as buy one get one half price and it's something fresh, make sure you can either freeze it or you will actually get through it! Buy in bulk. Big bags of rice and pasta work out cheaper for 100g Look for the cheapest cuts of meat. These are usually meats with the bone such as pork ribs. But if going for chicken, buy a whole one and make it last about 3 meals. Maybe have it as a roast one day, then with left overs have it with a stir fry, pasta salad, special fried rice, curry or risotto.  If you do the above with the chicken, then maybe go veggie for a few days after. If you do, beans and chickpeas and eggs are good ways to get protein.  Look to see what you've already got before going shopping, especially things that are fresh and need using up. See what meals you can nearly make and just buy another ingredient or two, to make it into a whole meal.  Other ways to avoid waste include making homemade soups! Pretty much any vegetable or pulses can be put into a soup and blended up. And they'll be different every time as they'll vary depending on what you've got left.  One thing I love doing is buying a big butternut squash. Peel and cube it. If your daughter will like these then sprinkle over cumin, sage and crushed garlic. Splash over some oil and roast for 30-45 mins. Then mash it. This can be put into stews, chilli con carne, risotto or with pasta. It'll keep a few days in the fridge but I usually freeze it. It's nice and sweet and full of flavour, even more so if you can put those herbs and spices with it."

Adjust the cooking time/liquid amount if needed, I know I tweaked it a little when I first started cooking it.  Add a couple frozen veggie sides and this is a solid meal for 4, for about $10 total (I get the chicken thighs for $1.99 a pound).  EDIT: I've made this with marinated chicken thighs as well.

budgetfood,3830eh,badonkbadonk,5,Mon Jun 1 21:21:55 2015 UTC,"My plan of attack for grocery shopping is this:   I check the sale ads and write down things on sale that I normally buy or that are ingredients for recipes I know. I base my meal planning around this list, and rarely buy things that aren't on sale. For example, this week chicken thighs are on sale for $1/lb. Guess I'm making chicken! I also look for BOGOs, but I don't buy it if it's an expensive brand. Sometimes generics are still cheaper.  I also go into the grocery store later at night and look for markdowns in the meat department. For example, while I was looking at chicken thighs I found a whole six pound chicken for $3.52. Score! You just have to make sure you cook or freeze these things right away because the sell by dates are much closer than normal buys. Sometimes I even find marked down produce, dairy, or bread. Again though, gotta use it quick.  My shopping is generally divided among three stores. This isn't an issue for me because my town is small and I'm not really wasting gas by driving to all three. Two are on the way home from work and one is just three miles from my house. I have two large chain grocery stores whose sale ads I follow, then one discount grocery store where I shop for cheap produce and staple items (like canned/bagged stuff). Also I get meat there if I want something specific and no one has it on sale, because it's cheaper at the discount store.  Some weeks it works out that I do all my shopping at one store, but generally I'm hitting 2-3. (Sometimes more because I also like farmer's markets.)  Buying in bulk is definitely the way to go for even more saving power. Bags of rice, dried beans, 'family packs' of meat, etc.   And try not to throw food out. Veggies not so fresh? Cook them up in an omelet! Or fajitas! Or tacos! And let's not forget the glory that is soup. Tomato base + spices + basically any meat and veggie combination = soup. I use up beef, beans, potatoes, carrots, etc by making a slow cooker stew or soup, or even chili. If I have too many eggs I'll boil some to have a quick snack ready. Bagels + tomato + veggies = pizza bagels. Even old bread can be made into croutons, or if it's only a little stale just toast it and make something like bruschetta. Basically just every few days look in your fridge and get creative with things that need to be eaten.   (Me personally, I rarely throw anything out. Worst case scenario is my dog eats the cooked stuff that's a day past when I feel comfortable eating it - meat, cooked veggies, also bread - and the veggies/fruits go into my compost pile.)   And use spices. Different spices will make the same food taste different from day to day."

budgetfood,3830eh,Leavinonanairplane,5,Tue Jun 2 14:10:49 2015 UTC,"Before I moved back in with my parents to save some money, I did a lot of frugal cooking. Rice cooker and slow cooker were my saviors. Repurpose and reuse as much as you can so things don't need to be thrown out. Rice and beans one night? You can make veggie bean patties and fried rice later. Eggs are my favorite protein of all time. Hard boiled can make a great sandwich filler or topper for salad. I eat mine with soy sauce. Don't skimp on seasonings because it really does make a dish bearable to eat. Salt, lemon juice, vinegar, sriracha, soy sauce and spices (cinammon, cumin, garlic powder, pepper, chili powder) are important. Just today I made a bastardized version of pad thai with ramen noodles, sriracha, soy sauce and peanut butter. Topped with an egg and stir fried veggies and it was a very satisfying meal. Probably cost under $5. Shop at asian/latin/indian grocery stores. Miso soup with tofu, noodles and a ton of vegetables is very good. Now that I live with my parents, I still make this but with ""fancier"" vegetables (bok choy (which can be cheap in season) instead of plain ol spinach, fancier mushrooms instead of plain button ones, etc.) and nicer noodles.   And as far as kids go, they (ok your three year old at this point) should eat whatever you eat. I can't tell you how many parents end up buying the frozen nuggets and fries because that's all their kid will eat. I know it's tough but man, it sucks to watch them."

budgetfood,37zr02,HerbCoDean,6,Mon Jun 1 12:33:38 2015 UTC,I'm going to be able to make about a dozen meals from this after I cook it in my slow cooker overnight.
budgetfood,37zr02,LemurianLemurLad,3,Sun May 31 19:53:51 2015 UTC,How will you cook this? Just wondering I've never cooked a pork butt before
budgetfood,37zr02,NoNeedForAName,12,Sun May 31 20:22:18 2015 UTC,Pork butt in a slow cooker is basically begging to be made into either pulled pork or carnitas.  Neither recipe requires much work. Carnitas require an acidic liquid such as OJ or beer and some basic spices.  Pulled pork works best with a cola or root beer base and some bbq sauce.  Both are very cheap to produce.
budgetfood,37zr02,LemurianLemurLad,5,Sun May 31 20:26:42 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of pork with apple juice in the slow cooker myself. And some spices and whatnot, of course. Mountain Dew is pretty good, too, but it's a little strong if you don't cut it with some water or broth or something."
budgetfood,37zr02,me_brewsta,2,Sun May 31 21:20:20 2015 UTC,"I usually sautee my apple cider pork.  Boatloads of butter, cider, some fresh rosemary, a dash of cinnamon, and a diced up Apple or two?  Delicious!"

budgetfood,37zr02,LemurianLemurLad,4,Mon Jun 1 18:44:05 2015 UTC,I've done pulled pork a lot. What's your recipe for carnitas?
budgetfood,37zr02,bbqturtle,3,Mon Jun 1 00:56:34 2015 UTC,"Sure thing! My basic recipe is this:   4lbs pork shoulder, chunked 1 tablespoon cumin 1 tablespoon garlic powder (or a similar quantity of chopped fresh garlic) 1 bay leaf dash of chipotle powder 1 can of cheap beer (seriously, don't waste good beer on this - a shitty pilsner like PBR works best) 1 teaspoon salt (or more to taste) 1 roughly chopped large onion   (Any of the spices can be adjusted in quantity.  This recipe makes fairly strongly flavored carnitas.  You can easily add more spices or reduce the garlic and cumin for a more mild flavor.)  Cook on low for at least 6 hours and shred the meat.  Plop a big spoon full of meat onto a tortilla.  Serve with diced tomato, fresh cilantro, lime juice and possibly a dash of sour cream."
budgetfood,37zr02,LemurianLemurLad,2,Mon Jun 1 14:03:51 2015 UTC,"When you shred the meat for either dish, do you do it in the juices or do you drain it first?"
budgetfood,37zr02,Man-alive,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:01:13 2015 UTC,"For both, I shred in the juices.  For the carnitas, I serve directly from the liquid. For the pulled pork, once I'm done shredding, I use a slotted spoon to transfer the meat to a mixing bowl to add the sauce.  If the sauces pork is too dry, I add more liquid from the crock."
budgetfood,37zr02,blueside,4,Mon Jun 1 15:09:45 2015 UTC,"Put it in the snow cooker overnight, separate it into multiple meal portions.

Put that in a crock pot with diced onion, garlic, jalapeño on top and lastly squeeze an orange over all of it. Cook on low until tender; about 8 to 10 hours.  After that remove the meat from the crock. Place the roast on an open surface and tear it to shreds with a knife and fork.  You'll have a lot of liquid left in the crock too. Transfer the liquid into and good size pan with the shredded meat and boil it down for more flavor. Now you have carnitas for tacos."

Roast it in cubes without the skin, with garlic and any other seasonings you have, cumin and sage work well, as does nutmeg. Roast for about 30-40 mins then mash it. Then split the mash into 3. Stir 1/3 into a basic risotto mix and another 1/3 into pasta another night. The final 1/3 can be added to another risotto or pasta again or you could mash 2/3 and keep 1/3 as cubes and add to a curry. The squash will keep so you could have it every 5 days or so.   Here's a curry recipe, squash cubes are optional. Dice and gently fry 1-2 onions. Add any curry spices such as chilli, cumin, garam masala or turmeric or curry powder, plus garlic. Add a handful of lentils and a tin of chopped tomatoes. Cook for 20 mins. Add in the cubes of squash plus any other cheap veg such as celery, peppers, according to how long they take to cook. Serve with rice.  Kidney beans are cheap too. Make This kidney bean mash which is really filling and nutritious. Stir fry some veg with paprika, chilli, cumin and tomatoes if you have those spices already, to go with it. Serve with rice or fajitas or tacos.   You can also make a veggie chilli con carne. Fry 2 onions and add celery and bell pepper if it's cheap where you are. Add garlic and any spices you have such as chilli, cumin and paprika. Add a big handful of lentils, tin of chopped tomatoes and a tin of whatever beans are cheapest. You can also bung in any other cheap veg. Simmer for 20 mins. This should make enough for two meals for the two of you. Have one with any left over fajitas and the other with rice another day.  Make lentil soup with left over lentils and veg. Add onions, celery garlic and any other cheap veg you've used. Boil everything up and blend it. If the butternut squash could last more than 3 meals for both of you, ad a bit to the soup.   Make something like pasta with a simple tomato sauce made with the spare fresh tomatoes, left over veg, onion and garlic all fried together until the tomatoes are soft and falling apart."

I found a local place that sold eggs for $1.99 a dozen, and a 5lb bag of potatoes for $2.50. And hopefully you already have oil. Make some spanish tortillas. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqwdlnKF4Pc They go in the fridge real well and you can reheat them for days after. Minus the chorizo from that recipe, due to cost... But you can theoretically eat just that for about 2 weeks for around 6-10 dollars. Seriously, it fulfills your protein, carbohydrate and fat requirements completely. I also like making chicken drumsticks, you can usually find like 8 of them in the supermarket for about 5 bucks. You can marinate them in italian dressing, or hot sauce, then throw them on a cookie sheet for 45-50 minutes at 375 degrees, flip and put back in for 10 minutes. Melt a tbsp of butter and some hot sauce in a separate bowl, and you got yourself some buffalo wings. I have some other recipes, but im making this a wall of text, PM me for others... and dont ever be ashamed to go to a local food bank, walk in and ask to volunteer and help out in return for a box of food, more often than not at the end of the day they'll have so much left over stuff that you'll really feel bad for not taking some home!

What you get is a mixture of rice, that has absorbed alot of the flavours you put into the pot, the cooked veggies, the meat and the garlic. Depending on how thick the garlic cloves were they may have liquified inside their skins and you can press them out with a spoon if you want (tastes awesome!). But even if not they give alot of flavor to the meal by beeing cooked in their skin. So just ignore them if you don't want them.  This meal really simple to make yourselves and only takes a little bit of time. I assume that you highly overestimated the price of a selfcooked meal so maybe this might be a help to you since it's fairly cheap (dirt cheap if you leave out the meat) and tastes great.  EDIT: This recipe can easily last one person for 2+ days. You get alot out of it."

SALAD  Lettuce- $1  Dressing- $0.50 tops  Croutons- $0.50 tops  SLOPPY JOES  Ground Turkey- $1.99  Mixed Veggies (added to meat)- $0.50 (used a bit over half of a $1 bag)  Manwich Can- $1 (bought in bulk from Grocery Outlet)  Bread- $0.25 (the loaf is $1.59)  So under $6 and we'll definitely have leftovers of the sloppy joes.

I've probably drunk something other than water and tea no more than twice in the last 6 months.   But, my SO used to be pretty big into cola as well. My solution (more for health than budget, but it really wasn't too pricey) was 100% fruit juice (no added sugar) and soda water. It gives you the fizzy and the sweet, but not the soda itself. Over time, I think it helped to wean him off of needing a sweet drink at all - nowadays we will make a pitcher of punch or sweet tea for special occasions but pretty much just drink water.   Then again, I don't do artificial sweeteners at all, so this isn't as helpful for people who are into that stuff. I just personally think it's kinda gross. XD"

I drink a lot of ""naturally flavored"" carbonated water (LA Croix is my favorite brand). They have no calories and carbonation, when NOT mixed with something acidic like sugar, has no detrimental effect on ones teeth. I also have an iced tea maker and brew my own at home. Tazo now makes packets of tea specifically for an iced tea maker. For about $4/box you get six packets (read: pitchers) of iced tea. Just keep it in the fridge and fill a water bottle with it if you're on the go. Add a little honey if you need some sweetness."
budgetfood,37j3f2,gurbs319,2,Thu May 28 04:57:07 2015 UTC,What is an iced tea maker? How does it differ from using cold brew tea packets in a pitcher?
budgetfood,37j3f2,penguinsandpolkadots,1 point,Thu May 28 10:25:22 2015 UTC,It is admittedly one of the most frivolous purchases I've ever made. Its basically a coffee pot for tea. It heats the water and pours it over the tea in a basket and then into a pitcher which can take the heat of the water. You can achieve the same results by just heating the water yourself and brewing tea in your own container. I've heard cold brew is the best way to do iced tea but I'm too impatient to wait for that. I have no idea what cold brew tea packets are.
budgetfood,37j3f2,gurbs319,3,Thu May 28 13:50:24 2015 UTC,"You hit on it a bit in your post, but you won't find anything cheaper and healthier than plain old water. The more of that you can drink, the better.  If you want something interesting, you could put some fresh fruit (crushed raspberries, sliced strawberries, and lemon slices is good) in a pitcher and then fill it with water, sparkling would be good too, but more expensive.

budgetfood,37dc6v,Lone_Wolf,26,Tue May 26 21:35:33 2015 UTC,"Get a bag of lentils, usually under $2. I think the HEB near me has their brand for like $0.86 or something. Then you get a big thing of celery, it's $0.50 for like 15 big stalks. Get an onion, doesn't matter if it's small. Spend the remainder on other vegetables, maybe a bell pepper or a couple cremini mushrooms and a tomato.  Cut up your vegetables and throw them in a large pot. Add lentils, add water, add whatever spices you want, and bring it to a boil. Be careful not to add in a lot of lentils until you know how much of the water they will soak up. After it comes to a rolling boil, put the lid on and simmer for 40 mins, check on it every 10 mins or so to make sure the water isn't all soaked up in the lentils.  This is good for as many as 10 servings, depending on the size of the lentil bag you got. I make it a lot, there are better ways to prep it but require extra things like beef broth and olive oil for sautéing the onion first. Bottom line it's extremely nutritious and has lots of fiber and protein. If made well, very tasty. I find that salt is usually needed in moderation."

budgetfood,37dc6v,Xelif,2,Wed May 27 00:25:54 2015 UTC,"Great suggestions here especially beans, rice, and eggs. Here are a few more ideas:   Get someone else to treat you to a meal and you can either pay them back or help with something they need. Ideally, someone you like spending time with that needs a little extra help somewhere. Can you fix things? Update a resume or LinkedIn profile? Whatever you are good at, offer your services in exchange for dinner and try to charm your way to having dinner tomorrow. This way you don't even have to explain your situation if you don't want to and you get to spend time with someone and/or help someone out. If you have absolutely anything in your fridge already get creative and try a new recipe. Check out SuperCook or My Fridge Food. This would depend on where you live, but if there are any free events in your area that offer food, I recommend you go. Find an open house, sign up for a focus group, community events, meetups, go to a bar and eat the peanuts/popcorn if you have to--think of any friends going to anything and tag along or just go alone.   Be strategic with when you eat so you can endure hunger pains through sleep or important activities. Whatever you do, sleep full nights and drink a good amount of water. Try to keep yourself occupied--it's easier to endure hunger if you are too busy to think/do anything about it:  For the future, stock up on frozen vegetables and protein if your choice (peanut butter? Chicken?) in case this happens again and consider shopping at discount stores if available in your area like Aldi or Price Rite."

Get yourself some nice flour tortillas and roll that burrito with whatever you want in it.  Aside from the veggies, everything can be prepared in bulk and stored in your fridge for at least a week (any longer than that, then you should be the judge if it's safe to eat or not) all you would really have to do is assemble and pack a burrito right before you go.

Although I'm in Toronto, we made salmon last night and got everything from Kensington market.   2 Salmon Steaks - $11 1 large sweet potato (baked), asparagus (grilled), a lemon and fresh rosemary - $4  We made this meal last night for $15 for two and it was delicious and extremely filling. I imagine you will be able to get the salmon for an even better price.   EDIT: Costco for us is useless unless you have a chest freezer. The only items beneficial for us from Costco are paper goods and k-cups."
budgetfood,377t7p,pattyrobs,6,Mon May 25 16:23:31 2015 UTC,We just moved from Toronto actually. Both recommendations are very similar so it looks like salmon may be for dinner. We are still mid move so dinner will probably be on hold till thursday once we are more settled in.
budgetfood,377t7p,tgjer,6,Mon May 25 16:52:29 2015 UTC,"Another option for salmon - if you like lox, make gravlax. You can make it in just a couple days, so if you start it tomorrow it should be ready for Thursday. It's quite easy, and costs the same as fresh salmon while pre-made gravlax in the store can cost $30/lb or more.  Mix together 50/50 kosher salt and brown sugar. Add any spices you want. Black pepper and dill are classic. I like to add powdered mustard and chili pepper flakes, plus liquid smoke to make it more like lox (which is cold-smoked after salting).  Rub a thick layer of the sugar/salt mix all over the salmon. Wrap it tightly in saran wrap, and cut a slit along one of the narrow ends to let it drain. Put it on a rimmed baking sheet, and prop it up on an angle in the fridge with the cut side down. Put a cutting board on top of it and weigh it down with some heavy books or something. Leave it in the fridge for 24 hours, then unwrap it, rub on more sugar/salt if needed, flip it, re-wrap, and let it go another 24 hours.  When it's ready you should be able to peel the skin off, leaving you with just the cured salmon. Slice it very thin and serve on crackers or black bread, or just on a plate with a bit of lemon."

A few steps up from the atmosphere in a Grocery Outlet, and admittedly a few (quite a few?) steps down from a QFC or FM, Winco has been my go-to store since I moved back to the west coast. I remember the shock I experienced the first time I shopped there and came out with 5 bags of groceries for $35. Of course, that was a decade ago, and now my bills aren't so low, but in comparison to other stores, Winco offers me the balance of atmosphere and quality that fits my budget. Also, they do have organic products, as well as their own recently developed products, which I find to be at least as high of quality as their lesser known brands.  One of the sales I enjoyed today was whole fryer chickens for $.98 a pound (this is the second week in a row for this sale, I believe). Also, I got four pork picnic roasts for $1.98 a pound. Meat not your thing?  Check out Winco's bulk section for nuts, grains, pastas, candy, dog food, or baking mixes. Also, their 12 oz veggie crumbles are actually cheaper per ounce than their ground beef. Not sure about the comparison to other ground meat, though.   All in all, Winco can be your friend.

All of this illusion is broken by doing so when you could budget the money elsewhere to improve your life situation.

budgetfood,36k9w5,whenthepawn,6,Wed May 20 10:24:36 2015 UTC,"So this is my contribution to budget foods, I love reading by the way.  This is my main staple, I eat it about 3 times a week. All the ingredients I buy together and make 3-4 meals depending on your portions.  3 lb. Bag frozen chicken  3 lb. Bag red potatoes  1 lb. Bag baby carrots  Cheapeat onions at the store 1/4 lb. Bag of spinach and a bundle of celery  Boil potatoes and carrots, fry up 1 diced onion on the side. Cook your chicken however you prefer (I make mine spicy and eat with a little soy or hot sauce) Mix up some celery and spinach on the side. Costs me about $4 or $5 a night. I personally don't think this is to pricey and it's quick and easy.  This costs about $16 here on Pennsylvania so I personally make 4 meals out of this. I usually have some leftovers that I eat for lunch or as a snack after work.   I know it's not the most creative or necessarily cheapest. Sometimes I substitute the potatoes for millet or couscous to switch it up."

budgetfood,36k9w5,jayjaywalker3,8,Wed May 20 04:56:44 2015 UTC,"Probably because they buy ingredients in bulk to get a cheaper price, and probably need to find the best recipe to combine them in the most delicious possible way, so they end up eating a lot of whatever that dish is."

Also build up a spice selection.   But on those days you want to spoil yourself, go to the reduced  price section of the supermarket (don't know if you have that outside the UK) and get whatever you can for as cheap as possible.   I've had speciality cheeses for next to nothing, rump steak for a quarter of its original price, huge salad bags for pennies.  Cooking on the fly keeps your creative juices flowing.   It's like going into your own fridge and seeing what frankenstein dinner you can make, except it's someone else's fridge, I love it.   Also every now and again there are ready meals in the reduced price section, so it can be a cheap treat to not cook everything yourself some days."

budgetfood,36ccqp,marianleatherby,15,Mon May 18 22:14:49 2015 UTC,"Nearly all vegetable or meat scraps can be used to make stock. And stock can be used to make soup. Thus, soup is almost free.   Leftovers can be repurposed lots of ways. Learn flavor profiles and be creative. As a fail safe, nearly all edible vegetable and meat bits can go into fried rice.   So so so many things can be frozen. Cooking for 2 can be a pain in the ass since most recipes or for more. So cook for 4 or 6 or 8 and freeze the rest. Saves time as well, and time is money!   Bulk out meals with less expensive fillers. Grated carrots and breadcrumbs for meatballs, more rice and/or vegetables than meat in a stir fry.   Learn to build meals around something other than meat. Media has made us believe a ""real meal"" is a frisbee sized piece of meat with tiny scoops of sides. Meat can be expensive, so learn non-meat based dishes, or make the meat the 'side dish.'"

For example, when I am using celery, I will cut the top off if it is brown and throw it away. Would you use that? The peelings of carrots? Garlic shells? Onion ends including roots? I am also worried that my stock will end up with a weird ratio of things...like oh this month was 80% peppers.  For meat stocks would you include pan drippings?   Also I like all of your points, and would add specifically using beans to stretch meat since that is more analogous nutrition wise. It's cheaper and healthier to sometimes use meat more as the flavoring than the bulk of a dish. This works especially well for soups, burritos and chili."

budgetfood,36ccqp,squired,4,Mon May 18 16:23:52 2015 UTC,Well TIL.  Thank you!
budgetfood,36ccqp,Darth_Corleone,2,Mon May 18 16:39:03 2015 UTC,"For added flavor, sautée diced/chopped onions & mushrooms with a pinch of salt until they're just about burnt, then deglaze the pan with milk. Add the can of soup and bullion cube, stir it up and add to your chops or steaks after you reduce it for a while over medium-low heat. I like to add crushed pepper flakes for heat!"
budgetfood,36ccqp,squired,2,Mon May 18 16:59:41 2015 UTC,Do you put it over the chops then roast in the oven? 350 for like 45 minutes I'm guessing? Do you cover it?
budgetfood,36ccqp,Darth_Corleone,2,Mon May 18 19:20:03 2015 UTC,"You can, but I prefer to bake the pan-seared chops separately from the sauce (I use the same pan to sear salt-n-pepper-rubbed porkchops and then sautee the onions/mushrooms after I transfer the chops to the oven) and then add the sauce on top after the meat reaches temp (and sits for a few minutes).  edit - I also like to add Worcestershire sauce, but that's hard to add on mobile keyboard when you don't know how the F that's spelled. No cover in the oven needed, and temp (depending on your over) at 350-375, not necessary to turn them over but I do rotate halfway. Use a meat thermometer to test when it's done."
budgetfood,36ccqp,squired,2,Mon May 18 19:22:22 2015 UTC,Makes sense.  I'll give it a shot tonight.  Thanks!

budgetfood,36ccqp,novalsi,3,Mon May 18 19:57:01 2015 UTC,"I picked up the chops this evening but didn't have enough time left to fire them up; went with grilled strip and sautéed veggies instead (only had 15 minutes with a preg wife and still ran a tad over).  I'm gonna cook them on Thursday though and will definitely let you know.   I've done the mushroom soup thing growing up,  but you're absolutely right on with your tips to pump it up.   I'm going to make them this time without a brine to compare to next.  I'm thinking raw cider or cider vinegar would work well for the brine, but I agree with you. Unless it's a big honking piece of meat,  I can't tell the difference and don't have the the planning fucks to  do it regularly anyways.  I'm going to   sear them on the cast iron, direct to the oven at 375 w/ thermometer.   I'll start the sauce as I turn the oven off .  I'm thinking coconut oil,  mushrooms, 1 onion (1/2 for two chops), quarter jalapeño, 2 garlic cloves, deglazed with beefstock, can of mushroom soup,  1 tsp dry mustard, dash of cumin, Worcestershire's, some shredded parm,  liberal pepper, and maybe some thoroughly smoked paprika or smoked salt.   Hopefully it'll take the place of the basted, boneless chops in my rotation. They're tasty,  relatively healthy, and quick,  but they're all also lacking, a lot. The best bit of your recipe is that it should be maybe 15min hands-on (the third time anyways with decent knife skills). Other than the dried mustard and soup,  everything already sits together and is largely ""within arms-reach"". You can also hold the chops in the freezer to limit grocery runs and/or buy bulk. Outside of the cheese,  I think it'll be a hell of a fast/budget meal for those of us with condiments and spices built up.   Thank you for the advice and inspiration! I'll send you a pic.   Also,  if you have any more tips or found a mistake in my above plan, I'm all ears!"

It is always a lie! I have never lived in a place where the price of produce and raw ingredients like bulk beans, rice, grains, dairy and even some meats were more expensive than buying a bunch of boxed and frozen foods. Plus, we all know it's a 1,000X better for you. I'm not much of a meat eater myself, so living off of produce, beans and eggs is super cheap and easy. Along with having a fully stocked spice cabinet so these things don't become monotonous and boring."
budgetfood,36ccqp,justcamp,9,Mon May 18 17:45:05 2015 UTC,"It isn't so black and white. The problem is that a fair amount of stores only have bulk food for ""healthy"" or ""organic"" items... which makes the price too high compared to pre-packaged.

budgetfood,36ccqp,jamison3659,3,Mon May 18 18:21:04 2015 UTC,"Lentils, cabbage, and rice stretch meals pretty far for cheap.  If things are really tight, turn to potatoes. Super cheap and full of vitamins, just don't fry them. Bacon ends are great for cheap meat flavoring.  Produce is generally cheaper from farmer's market while meat is generally cheaper from the supermarket. A cast iron pan is one of the best investments in the kitchen, as is a slow cooker, and a good knife.

budgetfood,36ccqp,evileine,4,Mon May 18 19:18:45 2015 UTC,"I keep my freezer stocked with packets of all sorts of veg. I also buy tins of mixed beans. I make sauces for whatever meat (good, but not expensive cuts) or fish with frozen onions, frozen garlic, cartons of chopped tomatoes and an assortment of veggies. I usually serve it with pasta or rice (always wholegrain, which I've stuck with for years now).  Otherwise, just meat and a pile of boiled/steamed veg. Instant gravy as a bonus.  Frozen stir fries are great too. Quick and healthy. Don't need to add any sauce, meat or seasoning, just cook it until soft and shovel it in your gob. £1 for a bag of stir-fry in ASDA (Wal-Mart's UK business).  It just means I always have enough of a balance of foods around and they don't go off. It's been claimed that veggies that are flash-frozen on the farm retain more nutrients than those lying around in the shop. I can't be bothered with prep either. As a single-ish guy, I don't want to mess around with half an onion left in the fridge etc. I only buy fresh stuff if I've planned something.  For lunches at work, I sometimes do a tub of cous-cous with a handful of dried fruit and nut mix. It's nice with a bit of curry powder. Season it too. Just pour boiling water over it and wait 5 mins. Done. Alternatively, grab some chunks of ham, smoked cheese, pickle and oatcakes or a variation of that. Keep it in a tub and its your own lunchables kit, only slightly classier."

I bought a bunch of fresh veggies in small amounts so I can use them before they go bad (3 bananas, 2 green peppers, 4 ears of corn, a head of lettuce, a tomato, 3 potatoes, 2 crowns of broccoli). I got a dozen eggs, a loaf of bread, a 6 pack of sandwich rolls, deli turkey, a bit of ground hamburger, a couple cheap steaks, bacon, itallian sausage, Velveeta easy mac (my favorite drunk food), cheese, frozen chicken patties. And a few other things I'm sure I'm forgetting. All for around $40.   I'm planning on one of the steaks, corn and a potato for dinner tonight, I'm gonna make stuffed peppers for dinner tomorrow night and that might even last 2 days. I know thats only a couple days there but I'm not good at planning ahead and I like to wing it when it domes to food.  Hard boil half the eggs for snacks. I've got sandwiches for lunch, eggs and bacon for breakfast.   $70 for 12 days sounds like a lot to me, but I don't know where you live and how your prices are compared to mine. I don't think you should worry too much, it doesn't sound like you'll starve."

The only exception is ground beef + bread crumbs to make meatloaf. Chicken thighs are your friend. They are about $1.00 / pound, nutritious, and has minimal prep time. I usually marinade them with a salt rub / soy sauce and then cut off the bones and pan fry them. Bam, a week of meat for < $10. Frozen vegetables. Carrots, broccoli, beans. Usually those also go for ~$1.00/pound and taste just like fresh if you cook them thoroughly. Eggs. Minimal prep time, good nutrients and calories, cholesterol type  is HDL so don't worry too much about that. About $1.00 to $1.50 / pound.  RICE. GET A BIGASS BAG OF RICE. Jasmine goes for about $.60 / pound in a 30 pound bag. Use a kettle to boil rice if you don't have a cooker. Leftover dry rice? Make fried rice: fry it with some eggs, veggies, and diced chicken. Literally put all of them in the pan at once on med heat until everything is cooked. Beans / other canned goods. Also <1.00/pound. I'm not a big fan of beans. If there's recipes that call for them, go right ahead. Yogurt. ~1.50/pound. Buy them for snacking. Healthy, sweet, delicious. Bananas. Combined with yogurt, this is your best friend for lazy breakfasts. About 0.50/pound so buy like 7-8 pounds (about 3 batches), awesome for a quick snack too.   My weekly budget:   Rice ($20 dollar bag lasts me 2 months): $1.25 / week. 12 eggs: $2.50 / week. 5 lb's of chicken: $6.00 / week. 5 lb's of bananas: $3.00 / week. 3 lb's of frozen veggies (lasts 1 month): $1.00/week. A loaf of bread for toast and eggs: $4/week. Do whatever you want with the rest of your budget. I usually get some in-season fruits, in-season fresh veggies, budget a meal outside at a cheap place, buy some beef (ugh I should do that...)"

Make ahead burritos are my go to work meal. I've found its actually less time to just store the prepared stuffing and spend 30 seconds in the morning wrapping it up with your stuffing and extras than 1) spending 20 minutes reheating wrapped in foil in a toaster oven or 2) nuking the frozen burrito to get a soggy mess."

budgetfood,35zl2r,NotGettingFucked,4,Fri May 15 02:48:43 2015 UTC,"I think I played off this one (to be honest, I don't totally remember, since I started it so long ago). I do know I used cote de blanc yeast and I let one bottle sit for 10 months with a couple re-racks, and the others sit for a year (I know the recipe I linked only said a few months, but the other ones I found all said a year, minimum, so I kind of compromised...).   It definitely gets better with age, so if you ""peek"" and taste-test at five months like I did, don't be disheartened. The clove and cardamom one I did turned out pretty well (it was sweeter, but with some definite spice notes, and it ended up coming out around Christmas/New Years, so it seemed pretty festive). The lemon-ginger variant was less good, but still okay.   Go for it! I only do really small-scale brewing (literally in the back of my closet, cuz I'm limited on space/resources), but it's super fun! I've also done some nettle beers that turned out awesome (if you've got any young nettle wherever you are)."

I've asked for the best way of preparing them and she said that you can basically use them as a type of lettuce.

My mom would soak them and rinse them for a few hours changing the water periodically, and then battered and fried the whole thing stem and flower. The stems were really crispy and the flower tasted like a fried mushroom."

Its a bit bitter, like turnip greens or arugula, and personally I like them sauteed. They're a bit too much for me to eat them raw, as they're a bit tough and bitter, but if you eat kale and arugula you'll likely enjoy them."
budgetfood,35zl2r,kiramonster,3,Fri May 15 01:25:12 2015 UTC,"Same as what others have said here ; pick them young, use for salad. Really nice if you massage them with olive oil and a pinch of salt, then you can add whatever else and poof it's a salad! Eat em up!

budgetfood,35zl2r,MaroonTrojan,2,Fri May 15 03:36:30 2015 UTC,"They're dark and bitter, like mustard greens or chard. Fry them in bacon fat with garlic, or mix them in a salad with other leafy greens like you would use arugula. They tend to hold a lot of soil in the leaves, so you may have to soak them several times to get all the dirt out."

budgetfood,35zl2r,bananapeel,2,Fri May 15 01:50:03 2015 UTC,Definitely pick them when they are young. They are great mixed in with other types of lettuce and spinach. I believe these are high in vitamin C and iron.

budgetfood,35zl2r,steeley42,5,Thu May 14 21:48:19 2015 UTC,"This will happen with most plants.  Later in a life cycle, plants will have used up more of their stored sugars (making them bitter), and have just grown larger and hardier in general.    This basically just means more roughage to them.  People who have eaten more roughage in their lives (wild-ish greens like collard, mustard, kale, etc.) can probably handle them.  Others... probably not as well."

budgetfood,35ryn0,Terakahn,17,Wed May 13 00:37:20 2015 UTC,"I like salad in a jar. many recipes online, but basically you put harder veggies on the bottom with salad dressing of your choice (carrots, cucumber, radishes, etc) then tomatoes and wetter veggies, then pack full of greens. I keep croutons, meat (cooked chicken, beef, shrimp etc) and cheese on the side. If you keep the jar upright, you have a really crisp salad to eat any time at work. I find that I can spend $10 on veggies and salad greens and have lunches for a week.   Do you have a locker at work? I used to keep little munchies in mine-- peanut butter and crackers, granola bars, pieces of fruit, nuts and seeds.... all of these things are cheap.  I also do egg cups. Basically, you just put scrambled egg in muffin tins and add cooked meat, cheese, veggies, spices, whatever, and bake. Then I pop it in a ziplock bag with a piece of bread and use the micro to heat it up. It's pretty tasty and will keep you full for quite a while, eggs have lots of protein and are very cheap :)"

Some basics like rice and beans will probably be ok, but Walmart brand food and produce is consistently pretty awful when it comes to healthy options. You could always go for name brands which may be better but that's more expensive than just buying generic at another store. Stock up on toilet paper, paper towels, dish soap, laundry detergent, all that kind of stuff. Bonus: it's more nonperishable than food will be."

For comparison, things that are nonperishable that I would not buy at Walmart but would rather buy at a grocery store: canned tomatoes, black pepper, frozen chicken, vanilla, chili oil, ice cream, peanuts, wine, crackers, coffee.

budgetfood,35hlgk,SpartanMonkey,4,Sun May 10 19:21:03 2015 UTC,"I was told by a professional chef to add vinegar while cooking. He said half a cup to a cup to an entire bag. It's supposed to break down the gas causing enzymes but, while I've done it, I haven't been testing the results. I don't keep a fart journal and I guess I don't note when gas doesn't occur."
budgetfood,35hlgk,ichosethis,2,Sun May 10 22:18:29 2015 UTC,Doesn't vinegar inhibit the cooking of beans? I've read that using vinegar leads to overly tough beans unless one soaks overnight or doubling the cooking time.
budgetfood,35hlgk,HaggarShoes,2,Mon May 11 00:07:32 2015 UTC,I soak my beans so it's not been a problem.
budgetfood,35hlgk,ichosethis,2,Mon May 11 01:22:07 2015 UTC,You have a point. I never notice when I don't fart.
budgetfood,35hlgk,SpartanMonkey,2,Wed May 13 14:34:29 2015 UTC,"You really can't avoid the gas. The gas is caused by bacteria in your stomach fermenting fibers that we can't digest. Usually cellulose, stachyose, and raffinose. The biproduct of fermentation includes methane hence the gas. I think if you cook your beans long enough (go softer as opposed to firm), you'll break down more of the fibers and maybe reduce some of the gas. Although, if you eat beans regularly, you might find that it doesn't become an issue after some time. I eat beans daily and don't really have unbearable flatulence.."
budgetfood,35hlgk,jakbob,2,Mon May 11 17:02:25 2015 UTC,One man's unbearable flatulence is another man's breathable atmosphere.
budgetfood,35hlgk,SpartanMonkey,2,Mon May 11 20:54:38 2015 UTC,Not really refried  are they?  Just smashed. Probably taste great though.
budgetfood,35hlgk,jacobcrogers,6,Sun May 10 18:37:16 2015 UTC,Normal refried beans aren't cooked twice.
budgetfood,35hlgk,thallazar,1 point,Sun May 10 23:21:47 2015 UTC,"Source? Refritos literally means ""well fried."" I know plenty are just boiled and smashed but I've always thought of them as the low fat version."
budgetfood,35hlgk,ared38,2,Mon May 11 02:39:45 2015 UTC,"Well fried still doesn't mean cooked twice.  Taken from Wikipedia. The name is based on a mistranslation: in Mexican Spanish, the prefix re- is an informal form of emphasis meaning ""very"" or ""well"", which has been confused with the English re-, which indicates repetition. Thus, frijoles refritos really means ""well-fried beans"", not ""fried-again beans"". In this dish, the beans are often fried (once), but may also be baked, thus making the term ""refried"" a misnomer on two counts."
budgetfood,35hlgk,thallazar,1 point,Mon May 11 03:25:18 2015 UTC,I mean twice cooked as in boiled then fried. The beans here are only boiled.

budgetfood,35hlgk,thallazar,1 point,Mon May 11 05:09:28 2015 UTC,"How does fried or baked basically mean boiled and mashed? I accept there are variations, but fried sounds like the most common variety according to wikipedia."
budgetfood,35hlgk,ared38,1 point,Mon May 11 05:14:28 2015 UTC,Refried beans (Spanish: frijoles refritos) is a dish of cooked and mashed beans   From the start of the article on them.
budgetfood,35hlgk,thallazar,1 point,Mon May 11 05:26:17 2015 UTC,"Huh, interesting. The ingredients and preparations section of the page has an alternative conception:   The raw beans can be cooked ... and converted into a paste ... The paste is then baked or fried with lard or vegetable oil   I wonder if it's a regional thing."
budgetfood,35hlgk,ared38,1 point,Mon May 11 05:33:10 2015 UTC,"Probably, I see them cooked a heap of different ways."

budgetfood,35f2le,iloveoprah,3,Sun May 10 02:20:17 2015 UTC,second this. I really struggle to make perfect green beans
budgetfood,35f2le,ForTheBacon,2,Sun May 10 03:17:10 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you like them but we always steam them.  You can cook as log or short as you like.  We snap the ends off first.  Salty water.  Steamer basket.  That's it.  It looks like OP may have sautéed than in a pan.  Possibly after the chicken.  This would work well, too."
budgetfood,35f2le,rogueop,1 point,Sun May 10 03:53:35 2015 UTC,"You need ham or bacon to make them perfect, but a little white onion, salt, and pepper will do."
budgetfood,35f2le,alysaface,2,Sun May 10 04:00:43 2015 UTC,I used pork lard from a local farm. Nice bacony taste!
budgetfood,35f2le,pring0,2,Sun May 10 13:17:22 2015 UTC,"Sautéed in a pan at medium heat, cover for a few minutes to steam. I prefer my beans a little crunchy so it didn't take long for me. I used around half a tablespoon of lard and a tsp or two of sea salt to season. I add a table spoon or so of water in the pan to create some steam once the lid is on it.  Also, cut the ends off like said previous... That seems to take longer than actually cooking them to me, but you get faster at it the more often you make them."
budgetfood,35eel3,Purpleclone,15,Sat May 9 15:14:34 2015 UTC,"You could make her a tuna melt.  Just preheat the broiler, then while it's heating up drain the tuna and mix it with about 1 - 2 tablespoons of mayo, depending on your/her preference.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  If you have some celery in the fridge, chop that up and add about a tablespoon.  If not, check the spice rack and see if she has celery seed because that adds a nice flavor as well.  Don't sweat it if she doesn't have either of these.  If she likes pickles and has some on hand, you can chop some of those up and add about a tablespoon of those to the tuna.  Same for an onion.  Decide which bread you'd rather use, the white or the pumpernickel, either one would taste fine, and toast 2 slices. Put the toasted bread on a baking sheet and spoon half of the tuna mixture over each one.  If you have any tomatoes, it would be a nice touch to add a slice of tomato to the top of the sandwich, but again, don't sweat it if you don't.  Then put your cheese over the top and stick it under the broiler for about 3 minutes, until the cheese is all bubbly.       Another option would be a grilled ham and cheese sandwich.  IMO you can never go wrong with that!"
budgetfood,35eel3,GeeEhm,3,Sat May 9 15:48:48 2015 UTC,"Damn, that sounds really good. Thanks!  Also, do I add the celery and stuff when the stuff is in the broiler?  Also also, is this a cucumber, and would it be a good substitute for celery?"
budgetfood,35eel3,Beefyface,5,Sat May 9 17:07:45 2015 UTC,"That appears to be a cucumber, and it wouldn't be a good substitute for celery in tuna salad.  I vote for a nice and easy grilled ham and cheese. If she likes mustard you can put some on it before broiling (bonus if it's spicy brown mustard.)  Are you only looking for sandwiches or is that just what you normally do?  Edit: if she's eating it for breakfast, she might want something more breakfast-y. Do you have any eggs? You could make a grilled peanut butter sandwich just like you would with cheese."
budgetfood,35eel3,brendanvista,2,Sat May 9 18:05:18 2015 UTC,"Any food will do, it just seems that I can't possibly screw up sandwiches as much as I would some other food."
budgetfood,35eel3,brendanvista,4,Sat May 9 18:08:51 2015 UTC,"French toast is really easy and pretty hard to mess up. Basically, you mix eggs, sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl. Mix well. Then put some butter in a pan on medium heat. Once warm, dip the bread in the egg mixture, making sure it's coated, and then let it fry for a couple minutes until it's cooked and brown. There are some really easy recipes on Google, though some call for other spices or egg whites. Don't think you need to follow those and overcomplicate things. Try to follow this one: http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/french_toast/  You can serve with powdered sugar, fruit, syrup, coffee, juice, butter, etc."
budgetfood,35eel3,Beefyface,2,Sat May 9 18:16:36 2015 UTC,"But I don't have eggs. Or cinnamon. Or fruit that's not in a cup.  It sounds lovely, and may work for someone else, but unfortunately, it won't work for me :(  Thanks anyway!"

budgetfood,35eel3,konagingerface,2,Sat May 9 19:18:23 2015 UTC,A grilled peanut butter and jelly/honey/sliced pears sandwich would be great to wake up to.
budgetfood,35eel3,Chuchubear,3,Sat May 9 19:28:43 2015 UTC,"I think you got this from the other replies, but just in case... cucumber won't substitute for the celery but it will taste good and add a nice crunch.  What you'll do is preheat the broiler, toast the bread, make the tuna salad, then put the tuna salad on the toast, top with the cheese, and put in the broiler.  As someone else noted, make sure you watch it when it's in the broiler because food goes very quickly from raw to burnt when it's being broiled.  You can keep the oven cracked open to the first notch to help you keep an eye on it."
budgetfood,35eel3,1YearWonder,2,Sat May 9 22:33:26 2015 UTC,"you can totally put cucumber in tuna, it's not a replacement for celery but just to give it some crunch and mouth-feel. the tuna melt sounds amazing, so that's a great option. Also like a grilled cheese sandwich and the soup wold be nice if you have butter for the bread, and spices like paprika, a little bit of salt and pepper for the cheese"
budgetfood,35eel3,neurophilos,1 point,Sat May 9 19:26:09 2015 UTC,"Nice, I think I'll do tuna melt on pumpernickel with cucumber, onion, and some soup on the side.  But I still need to know what to put in the broiler and what not to put it in"

It's also far cheaper and healthier to make your own napolitana sauce rather than using sugar loaded jar stuff.  And.. I'm not sure why you added water. I've been making lasagne for 20 years and have always used dried-pasta sheets. The sauce cooks the pasta."

Also, it may not matter to most people, but Costco actually pays it's employees well and even part timers get decent benefits, so I like to think that affects your quality of service."
budgetfood,3571ej,dailyapple,33,Thu May 7 18:03:38 2015 UTC,"You're dead on about the store brand comparison. I once bought a pack of Sam's Choice socks. They were ok.   My friend's mom had a Costco membership and bought him a pack of Kirkland socks. He lent me a pair once when I forgot to do laundry (we were roomies). MY GOD, the quality was in a different category.   If it matters, we used the same laundry detergent and softener, so that wasn't really a factor. Neither was the laundry method or even washing machine and dryer since we would normally do a joint laundry run to the nearby laundromat."

Why support Walmart and their policy of paying employees the bare minimum -- remember the news article about Walmart stores holding food bank drives for their own staff?

Don't support corporations that enrich their shareholders on the backs of impoverished staff."

One thing nobody has mentioned that I love it for (at least the one in my area) is that costco often gets more seasonal/rare items. I have walked in and once found some pretty rare olives (for the USA). It was only a one time thing and I sadly never saw them there again, but I notice that happening somewhat frequently at Costco.   So in that respect, sometimes you can find some pretty cool stuff at Costco you werent expecting. I have never found that to be the case at Sams club"

I've been out of work for three months and unemployment got screwed up and hasn't paid out in a month. I have no savings, no food stamps, so I know about shit being tight. There is always a way around shopping at walmart, even if it's rice and beans, which are a better protein for you than chicken, the price of which has skyrocketed over the past few years, anyway. Shopping your values means making sacrifices and if it comes to a choice between significantly reducing my meat intake for a couple of months and giving the bloody fucking Walton's MORE money, I'll eat the fucking beans. Being poor yourself doesn't give you license to help keep others in poverty, which is what you're doing when you give your meager funds over to a company like walmart. See if there's a Winco in your area, and Costco will save you the same amount of money as Sam's Club as so many people here are saying. Also, ethnic supermarkets, if you have any around you, are usually even cheaper for meats, spices, and produce and definitely cheaper for rice (which, if you aren't eating brown rice, you aren't really helping yourself out by eating a bunch of it because white rice has next to no actual nutritional value anyway).

All kidding aside, I agree with everybody else in this thread, the food and service is better. I can't speak about the clothes since I've never purchased any.  Edit: Since we are in budget food, I just wanted to elaborate on how awesome the food is. They hire excellent butchers in their meat department. I once did an informal side by side comparison of their eye of round roasts (I make my own beef jerky). The typical store roasts would be improperly trimmed and not as fresh. I usually have to trim a few extra oz of fat off the roast, that's money gone. Conversely have never had a bad cut from Costco. I just love the consistency.   Oh and $5 Roast Chickens! As somebody trying to eat healthy on a budget, these are a godsend. One chicken can last me a few dinners an even fit into my macro cycling.

Secondly, they actually pay their employees well, which means that they give a shit about their job, meaning that you'll have a decent experience shopping there, as well as supporting them for it.   Third, the Kirkland brand is so much better than Sam's Club it's not even funny. the Costco orange juice for example is significantly better than the name brands.

Sams is owned by walmart and follows the same shady business practices that lead to shitty products.  This includes their produce and other food.  Walmart works for its investors, not its customers, and it shows.  Costco's management is focused on long term profits, meaning they are customer oriented.  The CEO said something along the lines of, ""Im not after our current customer basis, Im after their children.""  Holy shit that is a powerful statement.  It means that he want Costco to be so appealing that all his members children choose to shop there.  The difference in these philosophy shows up in the quality of their products, how they pay their employees, and how they handle problems with customers.  I would eat a berry pie from costco, I would be pretty disgusted to eat the competing pie from samsclub."

If you're taking care of like 8 people on a shoestring, probably, but if it's just you and 1 or 2 other family members, it's probably better just to pick one. I'd imagine the food cost at Sam's is balanced out by the lower cost of other consumables (TP etc), but it also probably depends on the location."

They put one person on the snack bar on Saturday and Sunday, a person who eventually doesn't give a shit - not that I blame them. The bathrooms are filthy.

I don't believe you can even purchase anything in-store other than the non-member items (alcohol in some states, prescriptions everywhere, etc.) if you don't have a membership card.

budgetfood,3571ej,Iamalwayswrite,-4,Thu May 7 18:23:00 2015 UTC,"I really want to like Costco, and I absolutely despise Walmart, but I find it difficult to give up my Sam's Club to shop at Costco.  I've been shopping at a Sam's in an affluent area for nearly two decades.  My Sams is very big, very clean, very bright, very well stocked, and the clientele is well dressed and well mannered.  By contrast, the Costco in my area seems smaller, darker, less stocked, over crowded, and the clientele seems more typical of the sort you'd find at Walmart.  In other words, I not only vastly prefer the shopping experience of Sam's Club, I find the shopping experience at Costco rather displeasurable.  I can best describe the difference, for my area at least, by  comparing Target to Walmart.  I'm not a snob, I've spent the better part of the last 20 years aspiring to the middle class lifestyle.  Yet, being on a tight budget is no excuse for poor attire and certainly does not compel one to conduct themselves improperly.  I have a family member who for a time worked at Sam's as a department manager.  They seemed to do alright, although they did eventually move on to bigger and better things, so it's not as if workers at Sam's are working in a 3rd world sweat shop, even if most of the products Sam's sells were produced in one.  Yet, Costco sells the same products, produced in the very same third world sweat shops, so even if they pay the person who rings up the total and takes your money slightly more than Sam's, on the grand scale of things there is very little difference."
budgetfood,3571ej,serialp0rt,9,Fri May 8 04:38:22 2015 UTC,"Yet, being on a tight budget is no excuse for poor attire   It absolutely is, what are you talking about? If you are on a tight budget your ""level"" of attire is way, way below food/shelter/HAVING attire at all.  Also the employees at Costco are far and away better taken care of than Sam's Club. They have a very high entry level wage, a lot of places pay 1.5x for sundays, excellent raise/benefit structure, etc. If you don't have aspirations for a particular career, you can actually make a pretty good living at Costco."
budgetfood,3571ej,Iamalwayswrite,4,Thu May 7 19:47:02 2015 UTC,"Slightly more? Nope. Almost double to start, and with benefits. Benefits! Their turnover is practically nil in some areas -- more where I live, because it's a student town."

budgetfood,3571ej,theredvixen,2,Thu May 7 20:48:13 2015 UTC,"Costco may seem darker because the warehouses rely on sunlight (look up, lots of big windows) instead of powering tons of lamps.

You just couldn't possibly be any more wrong. Costco has 10 times the qualitiy of Sam's Club. Sam's Club could hardly give two shits about the ingredients or treatment of the employees where the product comes from, or even the actual quality of the product. Costco will refuse business from a place not meeting THEIR standards. You really should know what you are talking about before writing out a giant diatribe of non sense."

Now, just moments later they are working on an identical TV that will end up in a Sam's Club you ignorant piece of shit.  They made perhaps as much as a dollar an hour working on the TV destined for Costco you dumb fuck, the same dollar and hour they made working on the TV headed to Sam's.  The life of a factory worker in China sucks more ass than your face you slimy shit eating fuckwad.  The life of a cashier at Sam's would seem as grand to them as the life of Donald Trump would seem to the cashier.  They also have a lot fewer options than the cashier at Sam's, with nothing to look forward to but more of the same until the day they taste the sweet relief of death you dimwitted cunt.  So here's your dipshit ass crying about how Sam's Club employees don't make as much as Costco employees, (when your stupid fucking ignorant ass doesn't even have a shred of evidence to support that beyond you heard somebody say that once), so you're crying in your Fucktard Flakes because I bought my TV at Sam's and Bobby Sue only made a dollar over minimum wage ringing me up.

Run warm water over the container until you can pop it out, and put it in a saucepan with a shallow layer of water, and use medium-low heat. Flip it over a few times and raise the heat the more it melts. Other foods can be cooked in an oven (place them in the oven while it is still cool, covered), in a skillet (low heat, stir often, add fat or liquid). I feel that food tastes better unmicrowaved, but that may just be a sort of placebo."
budgetfood,351zaj,foppishfox,1 point,Wed May 6 23:18:13 2015 UTC,"The selling point for us getting one was time, sometimes we're on a really tight schedule and the fact that you can nuke things like this in 3 minutes instead of the 50 minutes it takes in the oven was a big deal."
budgetfood,351zaj,AmantisAsoko,1 point,Thu May 7 00:11:50 2015 UTC,"I've lived for a few years without a microwave and I don't miss it. At first I lived by myself just out of university and didn't have much space/money in my tiny apartment for one. When I could've afforded to buy one I realized it wasn't something I particularly felt I needed.  I'd say you'll get used to living without one. Once you start adapting (by defrosting in water, steaming veggies on the stovetop, etc), you'll see it's not such an essential thing as we might think."
budgetfood,351zaj,_SilverStag_,1 point,Thu May 7 00:39:46 2015 UTC,"I have lived without a microwave for a year. I try to decide what I need to defrost 24-48 hours in advance and just put it in the fridge. If   it's shorter notice, I stick it in a bowl of cold water and it will be thawed in an hour or two. Make sure to freeze things in a thin layer, that way they will thaw quickly and evenly. Like if you put 4 chicken thighs in a bag, put them on a cookie sheet or something until they freeze solid and separately. Otherwise it's going to take forever. Honestly, I think using a microwave to defrost food ruins it the majority of the time.  I reheat leftovers either on the stove or in the oven. It takes a couple extra minutes, but it works fine. I have space to get a microwave now, but I don't think I will.  It's just not necessary."
budgetfood,351zaj,kaylenfalse,2,Thu May 7 03:30:37 2015 UTC,"oh but it MUST be cold to lukewarm water. Warm water seems to draw the blood out of the meat and really affects it. Trust me on this, you will ruin your ground beef if you thaw it in warm water."
budgetfood,351zaj,kaylenfalse,1 point,Thu May 7 03:34:00 2015 UTC,Microwaves are more efficient and cost effective. Microwaves that range in the 150 to 200 range can have some pretty neat features like grilling and steaming.  I never use my microwave because I love the process of cooking on my stove and grill.

I do rely on the microwave for quick heating, but I can do the same with the stove top or oven. But I am thinking of dropping it all together, I know when I go into a tiny house, I'll drop it for sure. My dogs eat raw, which is usually frozen. I just set what I need in the sink. By the time I get home, its still real cold, and I heat my meal. My dogs just eat cold raw feed."

Add in White and Brown sugar, and suddenly you have a delicious chocolate chip cookie, minus the chocolate chips. Change the ratios and add some peanut butter, bam peanut butter cookies.   I'm not saying this cake cookie isn't great, but if you're wanting any type of cookie, they are quite possible the easiest thing to bake, ever.   Ninjaedit: Don't actually put those things together in the order I said them. Sugars with butter and eggs, mix in flour (w/ baking soda and salt, possibly) then fold in chips."
budgetfood,34uv8e,werkz4me,2,Mon May 4 22:32:58 2015 UTC,"I hear you. Pancakes/waffles, quick breads/muffins, cakes and cookies are all very easy and much cheaper to make from scratch."

I like to simmer it for at least 8 hours to break down as much of the gelatin out of the bones as possible, but if you're in a hurry 3 hours will still get you a nice broth.

budgetfood,34qq87,Fyoucon,38,Sun May 3 20:24:49 2015 UTC,"You're right. I didn't post a recipe initially because I didn't have one. I improvised, so the measurements are estimated. They may be off. This dish cost me about 4€ max.   Ingredients:  1 cup Macaroni   Cubed Bacon & a few slices of Chorizo (as much as you'd like)  1 cup Milk   1-2 cloves of garlic  2 tablespoons of flour  Around 1/2 cup Chili Smoked Gouda   Around 1/2 cup Muenster   Salt& freshly ground black pepper  Parsley (preferably fresh)  Chili flakes  (Optional: Beer)  Firstly, cook the macaroni until it is al-dente. You want a bite to the pasta because you'll be cooking it in the sauce to finish later. While that is cooking, start your bacon. Cook until crisp. Once it's nearly done, add the chorizo and garlic. The chorizo is cured already, so it does not need a long time. Make sure that you don't burn the  garlic. Let it cook for a minute, then add the milk and flour to make a roux. Normally, you'd need butter as the thickening agent, but the fat from the meat will replace it. Wisk until the sauce thickens. Make sure to wisk out any lumps. Add in salt, pepper, parsley and chili flakes. Next, add your cheeses and continue to wisk until it is all combined and lookin' nice. (This is where you'd add in a hefty splash of your favorite beer. Unfortunately, I drank all of mine last night, so I didn't have any handy.) Add in the cooked macaroni to combine flavors and finish off the cooking process. Stir for a minute or two then plate the dish. Garnish with more parsley and a few cranks of black pepper.   Hope you try it out"

Chicken and Romaine salad got me through a year in college and it never grew old.  If you have a small crock pot, put some sliced chicken in there with any sauce you like.  I would buy those big packs of Romaine and eat it 2 meals a day, some on lunch sandwiches and a salad for dinner.  I'd have different dressings to keep me interested."

One I've had great success with that relates to the protein/salad suggestion is chicken caesar salad wraps. It's about as easy as it gets to make - bone out a rotisserie chicken from a local grocery store (if you have one that does rotisserie chickens - if not, get a chicken and cook it to suit), layer the meat along with romaine lettuce onto a tortilla, add some parmesan cheese (and I also like a dose of cheddar) and drizzle to suit with a decent caesar salad dressing. Very low carb count (read: just the tortilla, so, 10-15g or so each?), very low sugar amount (read: whatever's in the salad dressing, so check labels!), plenty of protein, and big enough flavor to notice."

Stir a small amount of protein into the rice with the veggies, add a flavorful sauce (fish sauce, soy sauce, worchestershire sauce, garlic powder and butter) and you have a complete meal for one that's fairly inexpensive and good reheated.

It was more like a hotel room, but also without any other furniture. (Yay student research projects abroad.)  I found an electric hot plate for $20 and had a 2L camping pot. That combined with a long-handled spoon got me through. Lots of soups (easy because it was 1) winter and 2) South Korea AKA the land of soup) and stir-fry. I would often cook rice, move it to the one bowl I had, then cook the rest of the meal, and combine them. Or just eat out of the pot. It was a lot like camping.  My entire kitchen there was:   hot plate 2L pot long-handled spoon 1 small butcher knife 1 small cutting board 1 bowl   The fridge/freezer will help hugely.

My method,  cut your veggies in large pieces,  peppers in quarters onions in rings, leaf greens whole etc.  sort your veggies by how long they will take to cook.   Oil the grill, put down the veggies that will take the longest, sprinkle some spices and put the top down,  keep adding veggies and spices as needed.  It gave me another veggie option rather then raw or steamed.  One of my easy go to dinner was sandwiches or bagels stuffed with grilled veggies.  Good luck."

Well, this persistent myth is totally false.  Sugar and carbohydrate-rich foods raise your blood glucose level, while alcohol actually has the opposite effect — it makes your blood sugar drop.   So just eat and not drink on an empty stomach and you'll be fine.   Not at all the same thing as drinking an extremely sugary alcoholic drink.   Though now that I think about it, maybe that would balance things out?  Still.. I wouldn't expect that to be very good on your body."

Go to the liquor store, look for any bottle that says 100% agave. In most places, $20 will give you many choices. Go for a reposado in most cases (pale yellow / straw, not white or brown).

budgetfood,34givg,the_bearded_wonder,1 point,Fri May 1 03:07:44 2015 UTC,My mom used to make this for us when I was a kid. Heat up a flour tortilla on a pan so that it gets lightly toasted. Then spread the avocado on it and add a little bit of salt to taste.
budgetfood,34givg,Q631FvrIC9AevYGZ9yjt,1 point,Fri May 1 03:14:56 2015 UTC,"Avocado toast!! For a quick simple breakfast slice an avocado spread it on two pieces of toast, and top with whatever you like (I usually do a bit of lime juice, salt, some chipotle seasoning and a small drizzle of olive oil).  Also, anything like eggs, sandwiches, salads, etc. are all better with some avocado.  I just came around to them recently, and they're incredible."

budgetfood,34givg,fritopie,1 point,Fri May 1 04:11:05 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite recipes is what I lovingly refer to as ""turkey mush.""  Fry up some onions and peppers. Whatever you like, personally I do 1 of those little tins each of diced jalapenos and green chilis. Toss in some garlic too (or garlic powder). Once everything is tender, throw in a package of ground turkey. Once the turkey is browned, drain the excess liquid and pour in about 1/2 of a regular size can of tomato sauce. Stir, and sprinkle with a generous amount of cumin and chili powder (more cumin than chili powder). Add more of the tomato sauce as needed to get a nice stew-y consistency. I usually end up using about 3/4 of the can total.   Top with a generous portion of shredded cheese (extra sharp cheddar works nicely - about a half cup to a cup) and stir it in. Serve in bowls over half a diced avocado each - should serve 4-6.   If you want a little extra crunch, a cup or so of corn is a nice addition.   Ninja edit: lately I've also been sprinkling the whole thing with a bit of lime juice for extra bite. The acidity mixes well with the sweetness of the avocado."

budgetfood,34givg,paige8,1 point,Fri May 1 04:19:29 2015 UTC,"Looking at just the thumbnail, I thought that was a cart full of avocados, omg!  You can make guacamole. In a food processor or blender combine avocado, salt, garlic, chopped onion, and (optional) jalapeno. For one large avocado, I will usually do half a red onion, 3-4 cloves of garlic, 2 jalapeno (I like spicey!) and, dash of lime (or lemon will work) juice, and 1 teaspoon of salt, but you should play around with the proportions and if you want to get fancy you can try adding some other herbs, like cumin or cayenne or chili. This is great a spread on sandwiches, chip dip, burrito/nacho/quesilldo/etc. topping.  Mushed avocado can be used as a substitute for mayo in egg salad, tuna salad, and chicken salad sandwiches.   You can use mashed avocados in baking as a replacement for oil/butter. You can replace it at 1:1 ratio, however, sometimes you will need to add a bit more of the wet ingredients (or just plain old water), as avocado is drier. Try avocado blueberry muffins, avocado brownies, avocado cupcakes, avocado double chocolate cookies, avocado chocolate cake... You can find tons more on pinterest.  They are good as a topping for burgers, salads, sandwiches, etc. Apparently you can make them into fries.  Halve an avocado and remove pit. Crack an egg in it. Top with some salt. Could also top with shredded cheese. Bake in the oven until egg is cooked. Eat for breakfast.  Never tried myself, but you can freeze them."

budgetfood,34givg,amykhar,1 point,Fri May 1 05:45:29 2015 UTC,"Start heating up some oil on the stove.  Slice them.  Dredge in egg.  Dredge in flour.  Then egg.  Then Panko.  Drop into oil.  Fry until golden brown.  Remove from oil.  Dip in ranch.  For realz tho, you can probably just dredge once.  Do either egg + flour.  Or egg + panko.  If you're lazy like me.  Just be sure, either way, that you season what you dredge the slices in just a little.  Good ole salt & pepper.  Though IMO a little spice is nice as well.  Sometimes I forget though, so I spice up the ranch dipping sauce instead.  Uhm... yea.  Guacamole is always good.  There's a trick you can google that will help make it last longer.  You mix up some really salty water and soak the peeled and pitted avocado halves in the water.  Then make your guacamole.  You should add sour cream to your guacamole.  Trust me.  And another thing that fights the dreaded brownness that plagues guacamole is sticking the pits in the guacamole before storing it in the fridge for the night.  Either way you probably won't get more than 3 days out of it before it goes all nasty on you.  But that's not terrible for guacamole.  Mash up some avocado and mix it up with mayo and a little lime juice.  And there you have yourself a fantastic avocado spread to glob on your burgers or sandwiches.  Avocado deviled eggs.  Idk what happened to the recipe that I had for them, but damn they are good.  Just google it.  I'm sure you can't really go wrong with any version of that recipe."

budgetfood,34ezaf,PanzerPancho,2,Fri May 1 05:38:17 2015 UTC,"Are you also getting bread on your WIC vouchers? Why not make peanut butter toast and scrambled eggs? (Breakfast foods aren't just for breakfast!)  We lived on a lot of scrambled eggs when we had WIC. You can use some of the milk to help ""fluff"" the eggs up before you scramble them. If you can't afford to get bacon to go along, sliced ham, turkey, spam, and even hot dogs (odd, I know) make good additions to just plain old eggs. If you're more adept to cooking eggs than I, you can also fry them and make omelets. (Yes, you can use your American cheese in with the eggs as well. Just make sure you tear it up small so it'll melt easier.) This is in addition to the hard boiled eggs mentioned previously.  If you're getting rice (forgive me, its been a few years since I was on it and I can't remember everything I was getting), you can make a variation of fried rice. It'll be on the plain side, but just cook some rice, scramble some of those eggs, and add some canned (or fresh if you're getting the fresh fruit/veggie allowance -- can't remember what its called) veggies and call it a meal. (If they're canned, just make sure to drain the water first.)  I don't really have any other suggestions that haven't already been mentioned. If you find that you absolutely CANNOT use all the milk and eggs up before they go bad, I would start asking friends and family if they can use it. (Peanut butter seems to last a good while, that's why I didn't include it.) We, a family of four, would only go through about 2 gallons of milk a month -- and we were getting 5.75 (odd number, I know) gallons a month! We gave it away (which is really about the only thing you can do, besides throwing it out)."

Whatever meat is on sale and cheapest that week is what you're eating lol.  Scrambled eggs with onion on steamed rice, bit of sslt and pepper is a yum egg fried rice without having to use oil or find scraps for veg and flavouring.  It's one of my faves.  Another fave is mackerel curry, which is th3 cheapest canned fish on the shelf.  Just fry onion, crushed Galic and curry powder and some salt in oil until it's golden and toasty.  Add canned mackerel, juice and all.  Heat through, boil down if you like it dryer.  Serve on fresh hot steamed rice.  Don't add the curry powder If you don't like curry but up the garlic, and it's still delicious.  For sushi, first make you own sushi ginger and vinegar by slicing a load of ginger and boiling In some vinegar and sugar and a pinch of salt for 5-10 mins.  Pour into a glass jar.  When making sushi rice which is just any medium grain rice, sprinkle some of the vinegar on the cooked rice, and that is your sushi rice.  Ball it into big bite sizes, and top with avocado and else you want.  Grab some sushi ginger, Dip it in soy and enjoy.  These recipes I've given you are not miserable meals either.

(Freezer) I'll probably add some chicken legs from my freezer buts its nice on its own too.  2 cheese & broccoli soup.  4 servings of chips, beans, fish fingers.  4 baked sweet potatoes with whatever topping I decide on.  2 cheating Sunday dinners (warmed up sandwich beef lol with home made Yorkshire pudding, carrots, stuffing from my cupboard, broccoli)  That's 26 evening meals. The rest will be whatever spare food I have, cobbled together.  I'll also be making coleslaw, banana loaf & perhaps carrot & coriander soup, depending on leftover carrots. Maybe brocoli pasta bake, depending on leftover ingredients.  Breakfast & lunch will be a choice of coleslaw sandwich, beef sandwich, cheese toastie, chocolate spread toastie, ASDA coco pops, granola, plain toast, spicy veg rice, fish finger sandwich.  Then there's all my chocolatey treats and crisps.   Hope this gave you some ideas. I can give recipes if you need them. All this amounted to £52.24 including delivery. Knock off the spinach which I bought for making chicken palak at my mums house, and you could buy mince for lasagne. You wont need all the diet fizzy drinks i bought either. I couldnt resist.  You might need to make amendments for things like onions, garlic, mixed herbs pepper, tea, coffee etc which I have in stock. Also I didn't include milk as I buy it weekly, but its only 89p for 4 pints in lidl. Also you won't need the loaf tin, sieve, cooking spray and baking paper either lol. But if you're freezing things you may need freezer bags and/or Tupperware boxes (poundland do sets of 3)."
budgetfood,34ffa7,cabbagebrains,1 point,Wed May 6 22:34:19 2015 UTC,"I'm in the US so I won't be as specific as someone who can give you Asda and Tesco pricing details but here are some ideas:  Get a canned ham. This will be your most expensive item. Then buy a couple of onions and a bag of dried split peas and dried white beans.  You can make split pea soup (add a little ham to it) and ham and bean soup for minimal cost.  Also get some cornbread mix to go along with that.  These are popular southern dishes in the States.    I would invest in eggs for your breakfast.  Boil them and they are incredibly cheap sources of protein and last a long time in the refrigerator.  You need that protein since you bicycle so much.   You can make a cheap version of Shepard’s pie that could feed you for a week or more.  Buy 1 lbs of ground beef, a bag of potatoes, peas and some corn and layer it in a baking dish.  If you have extra money add some cheese.    You can make fried rice.  Get a big bag of white or basmati rice and boil it, add a can of peas, corn or beans (or whatever you like) and drop a couple of eggs into the mix.  Get a couple of packs of soy sauce (you could get this for free from a restaurant instead of buying the whole bottle but it would be a good investment later) and add it to the mix.  Then sauté the whole mix in a frying pan.   Also, with rice, you can add some canned  beans and chopped canned tomatoes to make Mexican beans and rice. You can get a seasoning pack for $.50 in the US.    Google some of these recipes.  I almost guarantee you can make all of these together for under  50 pounds. Good luck!"

Them with some diced chicken breast and some frozen veggies are my go to for quick meals with a good protein kick.  Add in a scoop of greek yogurt (packs of two large tubs from Costco too...

budgetfood,348uag,Peteyisthebest,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:30:51 2015 UTC,"I don't know where you live, but here's some of the tricks I used here in TX to eat cheap. (I mentioned location because it may change pricing)  I like to make a big pot of rice, beans, and ground turkey, and spice it up to suit whatever style you like. I like my food very spicy, so I add lots of cayenne, and ghost pepper sauce. You can cook raw meat in the microwave, just do a quick search and a little cross referencing to make sure you're cooking it long enough. Cook your rice, cook your meat, and mix it all up in a microwaveable dish. Add beans, whatever seasoning, and microwave again to get even heat. You can do this without meat as well. I usually use one pound of ground turkey, 2 cans beans (one refried, one whole), and 2 cups of rice. I'm 6'3, about 235 lbs, and I get 4-5 meals out of that alone. If you consider you've got 21 meals in a week, this takes care of a quarter of them. maybe more if you eat less than I do. Cans of beans are around 1.20 here, and rice is something like 2-3 dollars for the medium bag. Ground turkey brings up the price some, but it's only 3-4 dollars a pound. Cheaper if you buy higher fat percentage. So you're looking at around 8.40ish for 4-5 meals, and you have rice left over for another dish. That leaves you around 25 or so if we add in tax or possibly higher prices. Also, I like this a lot cause you can change it up with different meats, seasonings, and beans. On another note, I love Mexican food, so this is pretty much like having Mexican food all the time. If you hate that type of food, consider using mixed veggies and rice, or possibly look at using more American seasonings to change the flavor.   For breakfast, you can microwave eggs, and they sell microwaveable sausages and bacon as well. I avoid the sausage and bacon because I'm getting old and fat, but you could look into them. Eggs are super cheap, a great source of protein and other nutrients, and can be made in a lot of ways. I don't know how hot the water gets in your kettle thing (assuming it's an electronic water heater), but you can boil them using that. I liked to microwave a couple in a coffee mug, and make some toast when I was eating breakfast at work every day. Just put two eggs in a standard coffee mug, throw in a slice of butter if you have it (not necessary) and microwave until they look done. I would recommend 20 second intervals, and stir between each one. They make some pretty crazy shapes and spill over if you dont stir. One carton of eggs is roughly 2-3 bucks, and bread to make sandwiches with them is 1.50 a loaf. So you're looking at a potential 4 dollars for breakfast for the week. If you want to get fancy, buy a small bag of sugar, and a can of oatmeal, and your total jumps to around 7-9 dollars a week. that brings your total to around 15-17 dollars.   If you're like me, you like to have something to take the place of ""dessert"". I usually buy whatever fresh fruit is the cheapest and freeze some, and eat it as my dessert after dinner. If they don't have a lot of fruit where you are, bananas with powdered sugar is delicious. Bananas are very very cheap, and powdered sugar is as well. You could also use the sugar you bought for your oatmeal and save that extra 2-3 dollars. So for ""dessert"" we'll say your total weekly would be around 4-5 dollars, and that's actually allowing for a lot of fruit. That puts you around 20-22 dollars.   If you can skip desert, you can repeat the ricebeansmeat combo again for the same price, and still be within your budget using the leftover rice. I know this isn't an exact plan, but it should get you started. It's going to suck as you build up your spice selection, cause spices cost a little more than I included in the budget, but I bet you could snag some kind of seasonings from the student cafeteria to spruce it up. Shoot me a PM if you'd like some of the other meals I make on a budget. I only included what I know you can make with a microwave. Good luck!  edit: the bananas part, I meant to say you mix the powdered sugar with just enough water to make it kind of like runny frosting. sounds gross, but I promise it's delicious."

If you dont.... Get a large bowl that fits in your microwave. Put in a serving of pasta and fill with water. Coom until tender. Add on some meat flavored pasta sauce.   Thai ramen recipe: cook some ramen noodles however you normally do. DONT ADD THE FLAVOR PACKET. Mix 2 tbs of crunchy peanut butter, some siracha or hot sauce, and some soy sauce in. Some good stuff there.   Other idea: cook some rice, add in some frozen veggies, and some kidney beans. That'll last a few days.

Just do a rough calculation to see how many calories of beans you get for a dollar or something.

budgetfood,3416zm,Apoffys,5,Mon Apr 27 14:59:42 2015 UTC,"Section 6. Toxicity of article  Phaseolus vulgaris:       The toxic compound phytohaemagglutinin, a lectin, is present in many common bean varieties, but is especially concentrated in red kidney beans. White kidney beans contain about a third as much toxin as the red variety; broad beans (Vicia faba) contain 5 to 10% as much as red kidney beans.   Phytohaemagglutinin can be deactivated by boiling beans; ten minutes at boiling point (100°C, 212°F) are sufficient to degrade the toxin, but not to cook the beans, the U.S Food and Drug Administration recommends boiling for 30 minutes to ensure they reach a sufficient temperature for long enough to completely destroy the toxin.  For dry beans, the FDA also recommends an initial soak of at least 5 hours in water which should then be discarded.  Outbreaks of poisoning have been associated with cooking kidney beans in slow cookers.   The primary symptoms of phytohaemagglutinin poisoning are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Onset is from one to three hours after consumption of improperly prepared beans, and symptoms typically resolve within a few hours.  Consumption of as few as four or five raw, soaked kidney beans can cause symptoms.  Canned red kidney beans, though, are safe to use immediately.

It is a great deal, and really helps us bring our costs down, but we still need to add protein, milk, abundant snack veggies, and $random_condiment such as bbq sauce, ranch dressing, spices, which we buy each month to build up supply.  I am very surprised you can get through a whole week on $35, especially eating fresh (not dry beans, for example). Peanut/almond butter, a family-friendly staple protein has gotten expensive, especially if you only buy from good sources.  Fyi, our large family eats a lot of 3rd world food because corn, beans, and heavy rice are very filing AND nutritious."

So it would be fair to say that we eat $350 a month in food. We eat pretty well though - almost everything is a base of rice, pasta, or potatoes but we do eat meat 2-3 times a week, can afford veggies and fruit, milk/juice on a daily basis, ect.   I used to eat off $100 a month for myself before my new job/living with boyfriend and it was doable but not fun. Required a lot of planning, essentially a vegetarian diet, and lots of baked potatoes, lentils, pasta with red sauce, and generic Mac and cheese made with water and margarine. No milk, no juice, lots of fucking apples and dishes involving onions and eggs. So it's possible but honestly if there's any way you can squeeze even just $50-$100 monthly extra in things would be a lot better in my experience."

It's always on my counter because it's used so often. We just store the round tray upright when not in use, behind it.  Heats top and bottom simultaneously.  Never burns. Makes toast, heats cookies and french toast, crisps up french fries, gently cooks stuffed mushrooms, heats pizza of course, but also defrosts and cooks frozen pizza with ease, and just as fast as my oven.  This thing, for as silly as it looks -- is a GREAT broiler.  We thought it would take too long for the pizza to make the trip a full rotation, since it's only under the top broiler once on each rotation, but the bottom is so hot during the entire voyage that it heats up top and bottom just fine and cooks everything fairly quickly. Plus, if you're the family member who's job it is to always burn the garlic bread by forgetting it -- this is for you. The product being broiled is always visible and there is a timer -- you can't forget it.  The heat shuts off when the timer dings, even though it still rotates -- and its never out of site.

In the next room over, your wife pretends to be asleep. But she's not asleep, and you both know it. She quietly sobs into her pillow, likely the only comfort in this world she knows.   You reach for ice cubes, dropping them in the pan. Behind you, a tower of old pizza boxes stands and mocks you, like a statue commemorating your failure. 'Work, damn you.' you mumble as you cover the pan and drop it in the oven. Your wife finally stirs, coming out of her bed for her weekly confrontation.   'What are you doing? ' she screams, pretending that for just a moment you haven't been doing this for years.' Come the fuck to bed. ' Her eyes are puffy and tired,but you can't tell if she's been crying. They've been puffy and tired for so long.   ' You don't understand!' you scream at her. 'In my dreams, I can see it. I can taste it. I pull pizza out or the oven and... It's perfect. I've done the perfect reheat.' You step towards her, madness in your eyes. Your smile betrays the surreal atmosphere you've created. Lightly, the scent of pizza fills the air. 'Today, I am a madman. But tomorrow, you will revere me as a god!'   You leap backwards towards the oven, flinging open the door and grabbing the lid from the pan with your bear hands. You don't even notice the burns as you as you chamber past, grabbing your greatest achievement.   'Behold!' You scream, holding out your trophy. The pizza looks fresh as the yesterday you got it. As you take a maddened bite your wife runs from the house crying, still in her nightgown. But you don't care. You devour your slice and weep, because you had done it."

budgetfood,33w1bo,Hennessey10,1 point,Sun Apr 26 12:25:10 2015 UTC,"Just get yourself a pizza stone. Center rack, preheat to 425, heat for 10-12 min or until the cheese just starts to melt, take it out, put in mouth, chew, swallow, win. Crust comes out crispy yet still fairly moist (very important you don't overcook it, an extra few minutes can leave you with a crouton), and cheese is nice and gooey. If the cheese hits the stone you get some crispy, slightly burned cheese to eat and the ones for home use are fairly inexpensive and sized small enough to basically use as a plate but still big enough to hold a pizza for about 4. Have to be careful using it as a plate since it stays hot but it keeps your pizza hot n crust crispy. The stone absorbs water so it keeps steam from forming under the crust like it would on a plate. It's pretty much the only way I heat my pizza.  Plus, you can make your own pizza and bread with it. Get a cheap bread maker, one that will knead and rise dough for you, and you have a great bread making setup between the two."

Just adds a little more flavor. They have some heat but good flavor too - not just pain like a Habanero.

budgetfood,33s9y4,Meltingteeth,6,Sat Apr 25 03:19:01 2015 UTC,"Edit: Changed spring onion ""leaves"" to ""stalks"".  Recipe: (Makes 8 servings or so)    Ingredients; Price ($)   1 French Bread loaf; $1.09 Bundle of Spinach Leaves; $0.59 1 Red Bell Pepper; $1.10 1 Green Bell Pepper; $0.75 Market Pantry EVOO (Drizzled); ~$0.25 (Full bottle was $5.89) 1lb Boneless/Skinless Chicken Breasts (Clearance); $3.30 3 Spring Onions; $0.89 for bundle Dusting of Basil and crushed red pepper; Do it if you have it, if not you'll be OK. $0.05 Provolone cheese (Prepackaged, sliced store brand); $3.00 Tomato Sauce with no salt added @7.5Oz(Or actual tomatoes); $0.50   Total: $8.22    Instructions:   Preheat oven to 350F. Over medium heat, saute sliced bell peppers in a pan lightly coated with EVOO. Eyeball this until they look a bit wrinkled and have minor caramelization. While those are going, proceed to next steps. Apply very thin coat of olive oil to bottom of 13x9"" glass pan. Slice bread into medium-thin pieces and line bottom of pan. Drizzle EVOO lightly on top (to preference.) Cover top of bread with rinsed spinach leaves (De-stemmed as much as possible is my preference.) Toss on the bell peppers from above and immediately place the chicken in the pan with another light coating of EVOO. Flip every three minutes until cooked through. Cut it into strips/chunks before or after it is fully cooked based on your preference.  Slice up the green part of the spring onions and put the rings on top of the bell peppers. I used three bulb Stalks for this. (If you're very strapped, you can place the bulbs in containers of water in direct sunlight and they will grow.) Scatter chicken across the dish. Carefully pour as much of the tomato sauce on top of the dish as you wish, however make sure that it's reasonably uniform across. I used the entire 7.5Oz can. Cover the top with provolone cheese, making sure that there are no large gaps. Dust with basil and crushed red pepper to taste. Place on center rack in oven for 25-30 minutes. Remove and serve. The dish should keep in the fridge for four or five days, mainly limited by the bread's texture."

budgetfood,33q9qe,Lilusa,1 point,Fri May 1 18:04:41 2015 UTC,"I absolutely adore slow cookers. However, I adore them for what they were conceived for: slow cooking in a closed, relatively airtight pot. Stews, soups, things that need to keep moisture in.  Why some people absolutely feel the need to ""adapt"" any recipe to be done into a slow cooker is beyond me. Wanting to ""roast"" a chicken in a slow cooker makes absolutely no sense.  Mind you, I'm afraid it's always been the case with any electrical appliance one might think of: you'll always find a wacko wanting to use a device for something different from what it's been conceived for. Remember the people who imagined cooking a salmon in the dishwasher, wrapped in tin foil [the salmon, heh, not the dishwasher]? Yep, that kind of wacko.  I'm not saying that all alternative uses of an electrical appliance are stupid. Wanting to use a slow cooker for keeping mulled wine warm, why not. Using it to keep candlewax liquid for crafts, why not. But there's a point when you need to use common sense and understand how a device works and what it produces."

While I agree about the rotisserie chicken example and the crispy skin, I hardly could suggest those two appliances as a replacement for a crockpot. Was that chicken a misuse of a crockpot? Sure. But you can't knock a crockpot out of the running for a true, properly made meal. They're three separate tools with three separate purposes. Identify as such.  And before I get lit up with downboats, as an example, a poster described a recipe of making a roux and mixing up into a crock pot. That's the heart of cajun cooking: taking the time to make it right with the right tools, the opposite of a crockpot. He/she is rallying support by mixing up two completely separate cooking styles. If anything, blame the dumbasses trying to make a roux-based dish or a rotisserie chicken in a crock pot, not the crock pot itself."

I have 3 really easy things after you cook your chick, whichever way you choose to cook it:    barbecue chicken salad: mix chicken with barbecue sauce and throw on a salad with black beans, corn, etc and ranch dressing (mixed with a little barbecue sauce).    quesadillas: add a little oil to heated pan, cook tortilla on one side until you see air bubbles, flip, add cheese, chicken, salsa, etc until cheese melts and then fold  chicken casserole: mix chicken with cream of something soup and mixed veggies.  put canned biscuits on top.  bake at 350 for 30 minutes or so       edit: for budget, make drop biscuits out of Jiffy or Bisquick mix"
budgetfood,33nh2a,whenthepawn,9,Fri Apr 24 01:26:27 2015 UTC,"You don't really need to over-complicate chicken. Either bake them for 45 minutes at 350 or pan fry them for 40ish minutes (it's been a while since I pan fried leg quarters).  You can add flavor with a marinade before cooking or a sauce after cooking. For marinades, I use about a third of a cup per pound of meat and let it sit for about an hour and a half. Usually you want to stick to the 1:3 rule, where you have 1 part acid and 3 parts oil in your marinade. Good acids are lemon juice, orange juice, wine, and vinegar. I like to use olive oil for the fat part, but it gets expensive so I just use canola oil most of the time. From there, add whatever spices and flavors you want, just try to avoid premade spice mixes that are full of salt.  If you don't want to bother making a marinade, you can just let your chicken soak in a vinaigrette instead. Greek yogurt and some herbs/spices should work as well."
budgetfood,33nh2a,natziel,3,Fri Apr 24 00:16:39 2015 UTC,"Copied from somewhere else.  Sweet and Sour Chicken:  For the sauce...  1 8-ounce can pineapple tidbits in their own juice, drained with 1/2 cup of juice reserved 2 tbsp brown sugar (i have used both light and dark and they both work well - I will use dark today) 2 tbsp white vinegar 2 tbsp ketchup 2 tsp cornstarch 2 tsp low-salt soy sauce    For the chicken...  1 tbsp all-purpose flour 1 tbsp cornstarch 1 pound chicken, cubed and with fat removed 1 tbsp canola oil 1 medium red bell pepper 1 medium onion   In a non-copper bowl, mix the pineapple juice, brown sugar, vinegar, ketchup, 2 tsp cornstarch, and soy sauce. Make sure all the clumps of cornstarch have been dissolved! Set the sauce aside, while the chicken is cooking.  You then nead to coat the cubed chicken with 1 tbsp of flour and 1 tbsp of cornstarch. I find that the easiest way to do this is combine the flour/cornstarch mixture and chicken in a plastic bag and shake it.  Next, heat the canola oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat. When the oil is smoking hot, add the chicken (avoid adding any leftover cornstarch in the bag). Cook on the first side for approximately 4 minutes and then flip with tongs. The chicken should be a light golden brown.  While the second side of the chicken is cooking, cut up your pepper and onion into roughly 3/4 inch slices.   After about four minutes of cooking, both sides of the chicken should be golden brown. At this point, you want to remove the chicken from the pan and place it on a seperate plate.  In the same skillet, throw in the red pepper and onion. If your oil was hot enough, there should be plenty of oil left to cook the veggies. Cook for three minutes, flipping a few times in the process. You want your vegetables to be crisp, so don't cook them for too long! Three minutes is usually the perfect amount of time.   Once the peppers and onion have cooked, add the sauce mixture, that you made previously, into the pan. Cook for about two minutes and the sauce should thicken nicely. Be sure to stir the sauce and veggie mixture several times during this cooking process or else it will burn.   Add the cooked cubed chicken pieces and the pineapple to the sauce. Stir everything together real well and cook for another 2 minutes.   Serve with white rice."

You're going to suck it up for a few weeks and go to the local food pantry to get some free food. You're going to take the money you would have spent and go to the thrift store and find a crockpot. Next, you're going to take a bit more of that money and go to your local ethnic (chinese or latin) grocery and buy a big bag of rice and some bags of beans. You can prepare these in hundreds of ways with very few other ingredients to make delicious meals. The internet will help with this. As you start doing this you can scale back the amount you get from the food pantry.  You will do this until your financial situation improves. Then you will donate back to the food pantry and thank them for helping you get back on your feet."

budgetfood,33lvaf,endwomenssufferage,13,Thu Apr 23 18:08:45 2015 UTC,"Very sound advice!!  OP, the other thing you want to do is find out when the local colleges in your area let out for summer and when their dorms close.  College kids throw out a lot of shit when they move out, all of it designed for living cheap.  You may find some of the appliances you're missing, and they're probably throwing food away as well.  I had a friend who parked next to the dumpster early on one dorm's moving-out day and taped a sign to their side windows saying ""Starting fresh!  Looking for food, spices, mini-fridge, microwave, crock pot, pots and pans!""  She got 'adopted' by some students who donated their stuff to her and then asked their friends in the dorms to drop their food off to her as well.  She drove off with her car pretty much stuffed to the gills.  edit: OP, there's a sub for /r/WVU (not sure what other colleges might be in your area).  You might try posting there, listing the kitchen stuff you'd like to have and asking if people would be willing to donate theirs to you at end of term.  With luck, someone over there will be willing to coordinate logistics (ie, gather some of it in one place so you can make just one trip over, maybe ask their friends about food they'd be discarding)."

budgetfood,33lvaf,Miss-Rubi,4,Fri Apr 24 16:06:27 2015 UTC,"Watch a YouTube video called Depression Era Cooking. She gives the low down on how to eat on a really minimal budget.   Rice, potatoes, and eggs are good staples.  You don't need a crock pot, etc. You don't even need spices. Salt, pepper, onion and garlic will do. Cubans are known for eating without spice. You can too!  Now here is my advice to save money so that you can eat better:   use water to dilute all your shampoos and conditioners. Boil the water first to get rid of any bacteria. I did this a year ago and nothing bad has happened to my scalp. You only need a little squirt of shampoo to get your hair clean. grab extra produce bags at the market, to save money on saran wrap and freezer bags. grow herbs if you can. Basil and cilantro are easy to grow at this time of the year (spring and summer) even in shady spots. You can use plastic baskets that strawberries come in as planters."

Walmart has $1 spices that are decent when you get the money.  You can also hit up other companies for free samples.   As for food stuffs, you said there was a Kroger nearby? If you can make the time for it, go right as they open. They will be throwing out what meat and/or veg they cannot sell. Most Kroger's don't just straight up toss it, though. It's set on a table to be picked up by customers like yourself.   Do not doubt the power of discards! Many restaurants have fully cooked and perfect, untouched meals that were just never picked up.

I've spent YEARS trying to replicate my mother's chapati rolling technique and I've still got a ways to go. Watching her roll chapatis is like watching a magician.   My tip for anyone trying this out is don't worry too much about getting them round at first. Just get them to an even thickness. The shape won't matter when it's in your belly.  Bonus: And if you REALLY want to go pro, you'll need a jet burner."

I think I spent $14 doubling the ingredients on her Chilli beef mac n cheese and got about 10 meals out of it, plus feeding me and my two grandparents the night I made it.  So, pizza: Pita bread, pizza sauce, cheese. Your ingredients here. For me, it's Shredded ham, diced bacon, a little hot salami broken into small pieces, pineapple and if there's any in the fridge, chicken and egg. (If the chicken's raw, make sure it's extremely small pieces, this doesn't take long to cook.) throw it all together and into the oven at 180c for 15minutes or until the edges start to burn (Sadly, it's not done until then because the edges of pita bread are so small and aren't stacked unless you want topping stuck to your oven tray.) replace or add anything you want. Mine costs $25 for 5 servings, usually with about 1/4 kg of cheese leftover since I buy 1kg blocks for cheapness. They come out to about the same size as a large pizza, but are much thinner, crispier and tastier than any of the pizza joints here.  And at about $5 a piece, I'd call that a better bargain than $15 + delivery that pizza places charge for a single large pizza."

You can also mix the granola with a simple, healthy cereal and some milk/almond milk and it will keep you full much longer than the cereal by itself.   Slow cookers are amazing for eating cheap. So are simple saute recipes. Curry goes a long way and is delicious and so do soups. Rice is just a filler, but if you make sure what you pair it with has fats and protein, it will keep you full."

Always prep a couple or servings of meat at a time, and the same goes for veggies. I suggest roasting the veggies, which you can do the same for whole cuts of meat, ideally, as well.  All week long, you can use portions of each of the prepped foods, combined with different condiments and proportions, can be really satisfying and easy meals.  So, for example, I baked some cashew and garlic salt crusted white fish on sunday. I made noodles that day, as well, and some veggies. For dinner tonight, I had already eaten the rest of the veggies at lunch, so I am having reheated noodles with the fish and a table spoon of medium salsa and a tablespoon of aioli (mayo).  It is filling as hell and delicious. Completely delicious.  Would also work with chicken, I recommend dark meat because it's more filling and on budget."

budgetfood,33ebff,ToiletSpiders,2,Wed Apr 22 11:43:29 2015 UTC,"To me, you can't beat salad. I buy a large bag of romaine for ~$3 and spend maybe another $~3 buying veggies to put in it (cucumber, bell pepper, broccoli, carrot, maybe avocado). A hard boiled egg on top. That can be a meal itself, but I typically use it as a side for my meal every night. So if I make something cheap and simple like just spaghetti and sauce, a salad makes it more complete. It also helps me eat less of the main dish so I have more leftovers. If you put some cooked chicken into the salad then it is definitely a complete meal.   I would also try more pasta recipes. Even if you start slow with just jarred sauces, it still gets you into the habit of cooking."

When the tomatoes have reduced a little, add 2 cans of chickpeas. Add a good amount of oregano, stir and simmer till the chickpeas are soft. Eat with rice, pasta, bread, or just a fork. It's a nice little italian dish.  I also do a recipe where I get a can of cheap salsa from walmart for 70cents, fry it up till it has almost no water left. Add veg if you have, some homemade taco seasoning (google it, it's cheap, healthy, and delicious). Add half a can of black beans, keep water aside.  Once the beans are a little softer, add a little chicken stock, and add rice al dente. Slowly incorporate the black bean water. Once it's well cooked, should be yummy. You can add more beans, meat, or tofu to this. Or some chipotle :D  Italian Stew (italians don't like it when I call it sauce) Fry 1lb of meat, I prefer beef but whatever's on sale Drain the fat, add 1 onion chopped fine and some optional garlic Add 3 cans of tomatoe paste. You can replace 2 with a large can of diced tomatoes for texture. Mushrooms can also work well in this. Add water (I use that water to rinse out the cans of paster), and let simmer. Flavour with oregano, paprika, and pepper.  I do a curry with just cans on 99cent walmart cans. Fry up an onion, garlic, ginger, etc that you have lying around. Not neccessary, but adds flavour. Add whatever veg you have left in the fridge/found half off, and meat should you find some on sale. Butternut squash, potatoes, and eggplants go pretty far this way. Frozen veg works too. Once the veg is softish, add 2 cans of diced tomatoes, simmer till they have a bit of colour. Add 2 cans of chick peas rinsed. Add water as needed. Chicken stock powder is also great. I like osem, but you can use even the ramen powders that your friends don't finish _^ Then, add Then add curry powder. You can make your own garam masala, or find stuff 1/2 off a sobeys sometimes. I like the shan powders, they're a buck each, and so spicy that they last months. If you have, add tofu, aways nice in these recipes. You can thicken the sauce with a can of creamed corn. Once it's nicely simmered, add 1 can of coconut milk. Don't let it boil too long, the curry will get less creamy. Creamed corn is cheaper and works well mixed with coconut milk. Taste, and adjust flavour. I often mix 2-3 shan curry powders to make it taste best. You can serve it on rice or lentils, whichever is cheaper and you're not sick of ;)  I also do a recipe where I get a can of cheap salsa from walmart for 70cents, fry it up till it has almost no water left. Add veg if you have, some homemade taco seasoning (google it, it's cheap, healthy, and delicious). Add half a can of black beans, keep water aside.

You can add more beans, meat, or tofu to this. Or some chipotle :D  As for kitchen equipment, I'd suggest that sometimes walmart has sales and very cheap appliances. A slow cooker could be great so that the food's ready when you get home. Also, a hand blender could be great. Almost expired veg can make a great soup for cheap."

budgetfood,33chly,chicklette,3,Tue Apr 21 17:24:26 2015 UTC,....most things?  I tend to go for whatever bulk meat is cheapest.  Crock pot that with some fairly cross cuisine seasoning then eat it for a couple weeks in various iterations.  Example.  7lbs of pork shoulder cooked slow and low in the ole crock pot.  I made pork sandwiches with a spicey slaw buy amping up the bbq flavors when reheating the meat (bbq sauce and spices).  Made it into pork tacos by throwing down on the cumin and eating with cilantro onions jalepenos and cheese.  Made tamales out of some of the meat.  Added soy and hoisin sauce and stir fried with veg and rice noodles.  Hit with sriracha.  Really its all about the spices....which unfortunately are often not budget friendly when purchased all at once.  Eventually you end up with a nice spice rack to pull from though.
budgetfood,33chly,whitepepper,4,Tue Apr 21 17:36:02 2015 UTC,"Cumin  If you got one spice to buy its cumin, its delicious on chicken breasts, stir fried vegetables, in indian dishes, in stews, in dips  Really, its a must have  People often overlook spice but buying a few spices can go a long way, once you got a few different spices you can turn the same old potatoes and onions and other cheap food into delicious stuff, and cumin is a very good one to start  Another one I use a lot is cayenne pepper and chili powder but thats more of a personal taste"
budgetfood,33chly,AnonXXI,3,Tue Apr 21 16:11:09 2015 UTC,"Eggs. Eggs in quesadillas, rice, burritos, with potatoes, in a fritatta with some potatoes or cheese and spinach, an omelette could have anything in it, make a hollandaise sauce with some lemon and pour it on bread, fry them, scramble them, mix them into pretty much any meal, poach or boil them and stick them on a salad or in pretty much any soup, put some balsamic on a boiled one and you have a great snack, soft boil them and eat them with bread and goat cheese (or butter), mix them with milk or water and dip your chicken in them after the flour and before the panko for frying. Probably the most versatile protein available since it's so much easier to change a liquid than a solid. I'm sure most people have eaten plenty of eggs but they are really versatile if you're tired of just scrambled."

Also, if you need to bring the price per serving down, skip the seafood and sub in chicken.  Using boneless, skinless breasts ($7 for 2 breasts from Costco - I am certain you can buy cheaper chicken elsewhere or use leg/thigh meat, etc), it cuts the cost per serving down to $1.68/pp."
budgetfood,336kge,homewardbound25,115,Mon Apr 20 00:44:26 2015 UTC,the flavor are totally different so no...But it's up to personal reference. I bought one from costco awhile back but i had to toss it out because i never used it more than 2 times.  Jar minced garlic just doesn't have that same garlic taste that you normal would get from raw garlic. It's not hard to mince them either so don't kill the dish by using jarred minced garlic :)
budgetfood,336kge,Xoimgx,30,Mon Apr 20 01:56:05 2015 UTC,"I can't even figure out why someone downvoted you. This is exactly true. Go out and buy a bulb of garlic and mince it, and compare it to the jarred stuff. Even just the smell. The jar stuff has no smell at all. I used to buy the jars because I was lazy. Then I realized I was already chopping onions, peppers, etc, what is one extra step to chop garlic too? Improved my knife skills a lot to do it constantly so I'm not even mad. Buy bulbs of garlic. They're better."
budgetfood,336kge,corycory,62,Mon Apr 20 02:23:35 2015 UTC,"Man, you and I must have gotten different jarred garlic. I use the Kirkland stuff and it has quite the potent aroma.  You're right though, taste is not 100% the same. However, I've found that it works just fine for stronger dishes where garlic isn't the star. Vinegar based marinade? Sure, jarred garlic. Pesto? I'm chopping that by hand."
budgetfood,336kge,SpliceVW,3,Mon Apr 20 02:57:51 2015 UTC,A lot of Asian dishes come out better if you use fresh garlic though. I think it has to do with the liquid and how it caramelizes. You can't beat the convenience of a jar though.
budgetfood,336kge,holofernes,1 point,Mon Apr 20 05:13:42 2015 UTC,I can mince garlic very quickly. If you use the right techniques it doesn't feel like an inconvenience in the least and the taste comparison is night and day. I never use jarred minced garlic anymore.

budgetfood,336kge,Erocitnam,2,Mon Apr 20 02:43:31 2015 UTC,"I've never had the jarred whole cloves, sorry.

budgetfood,336kge,corycory,1 point,Mon Apr 20 03:17:04 2015 UTC,"I am no expert either,  but I would guess that the whole cloves attract less of the liquid and also its taste, as less surface area is coming into contact with it, unlike the minced stuff where every little piece is touched by it."

I've never been a fan of garlic presses as too much of the bulb is left behind. I mince the clove(s) then sprinkle a very hearty pinch of course salt over it and drag the side of a chef's knife over the garlic/salt mixture. The salt will help crush the garlic.
budgetfood,336kge,RichHixson,2,Mon Apr 20 20:09:22 2015 UTC,"I bought an ikea press when I lost my main one, and was shocked at how it seriously gets the WHOLE clove through- even without skinning, the entire clove itself (and somehow none of the skin??) gets pressed.

budgetfood,336kge,Fredthecoolfish,1 point,Mon Apr 20 22:05:22 2015 UTC,Yeah but then you're not controlling the sale in the dish as well unless you account for that in the recipe.  I still think it's not as good of an idea as smashing it then mincing with a knife.
budgetfood,336kge,IanalystI,1 point,Tue Apr 21 03:47:10 2015 UTC,"another way to ""peel"" them is get 3-4 cloves on your chopping board, a big/thick knife.  Raise your hand up high in the air like you bout to make them learn today, and smash down hard on the cloves with the flat (side) surface of your knife..The outter layer will come off very easily, then proceed to mince them :)  Or you can go to asian grocery market, they usually them peeled garlic in plastic container box for ya."

It's still good, still tasty, and really saves on cleanup when I just need a good big spoonful of minced garlic rather than having to peel/ chop/ mince/ tidy away the papery bits/ etc. I tend to use it a lot when I'm going to be making a sauce that needs to cook down for a few hours, since the low heat and extra time give it a chance to really bring out all the flavour."

budgetfood,336kge,Quatroking,2,Mon Apr 20 00:58:17 2015 UTC,Not been an issue. It's a huge jar. Lasts an obscene amount of time.
budgetfood,336kge,redshoewearer,0,Mon Apr 20 04:57:25 2015 UTC,Yeah but what is the difference between a huge jar of minced garlic and a large stock of regular garlic? How does this not bum you out when you realize you're out of minced garlic?

budgetfood,336kge,Fredthecoolfish,2,Mon Apr 20 09:52:23 2015 UTC,"Like any food that is pre-prepared and not fresh, some of the flavour will have gone. It's the trade off you make for convenience.

Jarred is more flavorful IMO and way easier to handle and you get nice juices that you don't get when you chop it fresh.

budgetfood,333ppf,Calmor,3,Sun Apr 19 20:52:06 2015 UTC,"Shin ramyeon (it's Korean Ramen, pronounced ramyeon) tends to actually come in really large bowls instead of cups. The packets are about 1.49 too. Worth it though. Try it with some beef and garlic. Or throw in a slice of cheese and bak  choi.   What I do with it is, I take a dolsot (Korean earthenware cooking vessel) throw in some sliced beef and sliced garlic. When that's about half finished I add shaved potato (just use a peeler) cook it for a few moments before adding the water and packets. After it comes to a boil add the noodles. When the noodles are done turn off the burner and crack in an egg and let it sit for about 30 seconds to a minute before mixing it in. The potato kind of disintegrates and makes a nice thick broth/stew. It's hearty and fairly cheep."

The creamy chicken and roast chicken are our faves.  I often add peas and cook it down to reduce for an extra 10 minutes.  You can also drain most of the water out, add half the seasoning packet and add peanut butter. Trust me, it's amazing.  A weird one that I love is to add cubes of sharp cheddar once it's in my bowl. When they get all melty, it's so good.  Also, squeeze in the juice from a whole fresh lemon. So refreshing!"

Other brands I've tried the noodles come out soft and squishy. Ichiban is the best. Use the packet and crack an egg into it at the end. Best ramen ever.

Since this is /r/budgetfood it seems pretty reasonable to me to point out that Maruchan and Top Ramen are both much cheaper than any of the ""premium"" brands people are recommending in this thread.  Ramen in general is universally awful for you but it is very cheap and satisfying. My personal preference is any flavor of Top Ramen with frozen mixed vegetables and a poached egg. I add the frozen vegetables and water to a saucepan, bring it to a boil, then add the  ramen noodles and seasoning and stir it up. When the noodles start to soften up and break apart, I reduce the heat and crack an egg into the soup, then cover and simmer it for about 4 minutes. If done correctly the egg should be cooked with a gooey center, but you can adjust the timing to get a more runny or fully cooked egg. :)"

She's fond of the variety in our local Asian market, and just adores the kind with all the different packages inside: oil, spice, powered broth... the more tiny packages inside, the merrier as far as she's concerned.   I have to say a few of them smell vile, but they taste delicious!  Me?  For beef ramen, I like to make the noodles, drain off the water, add the broth powder, and then butter.  For chicken, pork or shrimp, I like to add some veg (peas, mushrooms, sprouts, and/or shredded spinach leaves)  scrambled egg sliced into ribbons, and maybe some left over meat if there's any in the fridge.

budgetfood,333bvv,bubblebeatrhino,6,Sun Apr 19 03:05:53 2015 UTC,"Sandwiches can be really fun if you buy a variety of toppings, especially focusing on veggies and a hearty bread. If you have the time, grilling or toasting your bread makes it even better. You could also incorporate your hummus here for a healthier spread than, say, mayo.  Try out more ""meaty"" veggies as well - large portobello mushrooms, eggplant, lentils, beans, etc. - and use them as meat substitutes for traditional dishes you like such as steaks, burgers, meat sauces, and the like. Eggplant parmesan, mushroom burgers,  lentil spaghetti sauce... Just about anything you can think of! Soups and casseroles are also a great way to use up odds and ends and incorporate nearly any veggie and/or protein you could wish. Broccoli cheese soup, potato soup with cheese and onions (or any other potato toppings you enjoy), french onion soup, and hearty stews all fare just fine without meat, as do the traditional ""throw a can of creamy soup in with egg noodles and let it bake"" midwestern casseroles.   Since you've been doing a lot of pasta, I'd recommend giving some different grains a go. More nutrient-dense options like brown rice, wild rice (both of which are my personal faves), barley, bulgur wheat, etc. may help you feel a little less stuck by giving your recipes a different backbone and flavor profile to work with. I personally enjoy quinoa but I think it's something you either love or hate. I also love wheat berries but I'm not sure how budget friendly they are as a staple grain.   You could also try switching up your cooking methods if you're getting bored. Try pulling out a slow cooker, roasting something yo usually brown, or grilling something you usually roast. Sometimes just the way you cook things can have a huge impact on flavor and texture and switch things up enough to keep you from feeling stuck in a rut.   Good luck!"

budgetfood,333bvv,PausedFox,3,Sun Apr 19 10:25:01 2015 UTC,"You need to look after your proteins. As I recall, the three sisters compose a complete protein -- beans, corn, squash.  If you do not have a rice cooker (I use Aroma), then get one. Brown rice is better for you than white due to slower carb, fiber, and vitamins.  Get a variety of dry beans: lentils, black, pinto, garbonzo, navy, lima if you can stand them, red kidney if you promise to cook them thoroughly. Now you can make bean soup, bean salad, red beans and rice, and home-made hummus.  Check out the cheap pasta -- my local store has the cheapest whole wheat pasta (from Mexico) and it is the best tasting.  Frozen veg mix are great for soup. Again, look for the welfare-grade frozen veg -- tastes great and you will not notice the percentage of broccoli stem vs crown in soup.  Red potato, sweet potato, bulk carrots, jalapeños, are cheap and tasty. Eat the skins.  Make sure you are eating the slow-cook oats, not the minute or instant oats.  Buy cheese in blocks. Slice or shred it yourself.  Eliminate sugar from your diet. Vegetables will taste so much better.  Consider buying a bottle of Nellie & Joe's key west  lime juice, a bottle of Cholula hot sauce, a bottle of lite soy sauce, and/or a small jug of apple cider vinegar. They all pack a lot of flavor.  Also check out curry. Not my thing, but a lot of people like it. Dal and naan recipes are worth checking out, too."

We make a crock-pot-full on the weekend and then freeze it in single containers which we use for the next month or so.  For quick dishes, we do pasta, soup and grilled cheese, quesadillas, or sub rolls packed with cheese and fresh veggies.

budgetfood,32xfgy,topher78714,4,Tue May 5 16:20:52 2015 UTC,"Puffed brown rice cereal - broken down in a food processor - is a popular GF alternative to breadcrumbs, and I've heard of people using Rice Chex (processed in a similar way) instead of panko for deep frying. Oatmeal is also a possibility, but unless the package guarantees it's gluten-free there might be some cross-contamination with wheat products.  That said though, breadcrumbs are not always necessary for making burgers. Meatloaf is a different story, because it often contains vegetables and needs eggs and breadcrumbs to compensate for the extra moisture, but I've made burgers with minimal breadcrumbs or none at all. Provided you're not using 95% lean turkey (aka ground breast meat, 'ground white turkey' - 80/20 made with dark meat is what you need) and you stick to dry seasonings (salt, pepper, onion powder etc.) they should hold up fine when cooked in a skillet."

Buy a roaster chicken. Now, obviously, a good free range chicken from your butcher would be best, but let's assume you want cheap. Looking at my local grocery store web site, a roast chicken is on sale for 1.29 a pound. I'll pick a 5 pound bird. That's under seven dollars. Buy some potatoes (another sale! 2 bucks for a bag!), some celery, onions and carrots. (3.25 for all three). Also buy some butter, flour, a head of lettuce and some rice. You're under twenty dollars and you should be able to eat for many, many days off this.  First day is the roast chicken. Heat the oven to 450. Take the chicken, remove the giblets (eventually you can use it for stock, but for now just toss it), pat it dry. rub a bit of oil or butter on it. Coat liberally with salt, pepper, and whatever spices you feel like. Me, I like cloves of garlic under the skin and some paprika, but follow your heart. Put in on a rack in a roasting pan (you want the drippings!) and toss in the oven until the temp of the thigh gets about 160 (wiggle the wing. When it comes off, it's usually ready). How long does it take? Depends on the oven, really. Somewhere between an hour and an hour and a half.  Make some mashed potatoes if you want, or just roast them in the pan with the chicken.  When chicken is done, take it out and remove it from the pan onto a cutting board. It's going to be juicy and hot, so watch out. See all that good stuff in the pan? You can use it to make a delicious gravy.   Eat like a king. You'll have plenty of meat left over.  Save the bones. Tomorrow you're going to use it to make some chicken broth. (No time to type out instructions! It's easy. Just look it up!)  From there, you have a good deal of chicken meat. Sandwiches are a good bet. That flour can be used to make some bread. You also have all you need to make a chicken pot pie. The crust is easier than you might think!"

Therefore, I suggest my favorite fried rice:  Cook up a big pot of rice and have it ready in the fridge.  Heat some oil in a skillet. I like coconut oil because of the high smoke point.  Throw in a bunch of leftover vegetables and meat, chopped to bite sizes.  Stir, so everything is coated with a little oil. Then add some rice. Stir again. Heat through - takes a couple minutes.  Crack one egg into the middle. Stir til the egg is cooked.  Add a dash of soy sauce. Stir again.  Voila!"

budgetfood,32xfgy,stonecats,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:32:48 2015 UTC,"Stews are still my favorite thing to make for myself, and if you're only feeding you they last about a week.   I don't really have a favorite recipe because I just make it up as I go, but here is the general idea behind how I make a stew:   Buy the cheapest boneless beef cuts you can get your hands on. Stew meat is usually marked up, and any grocery store with a full deli will cut anything you want into stew meat anyway.  Buy any veggies/tubers you'd like to put into a stew. Currently, because its getting warmer, I've been adding a lot of veggies. Ordinarily I just use onions, potatoes, and carrots. Also garlic is great.  Grab some beef stock, tomato paste, and any seasonings you'd like (I like Worcestershire, salt, pepper, and paprika) Optional: Get some cooking red wine, or the tastiest stout beer you know to really bump up the flavor.  Pan sear the beef, put it aside.  Sautee the garlic and onions in a little oil in the same pan from the beef.  Put the beef, onions, Garlic, broth, a little tomato paste, and your seasonings into a tall pot. Cover and simmer on low for 3 hours. (If you're adding beer/wine add it now).  After 3 hours add your cut potatoes and carrots, and any additional veggies. Cook for another 45 minutes to an hour.      Once you get proficient with this basic formula for stew you can change up the total time it takes, and the ingredients really easily. You can also add more broth (and tomato paste) and make a vegetable beef soup."

I go to a few throughout the year, and summer festivals can be brutally hot. You may want to rethink not having a cooler because you'll want drinks close by. The camping areas are often a good walk from anywhere selling drinks (and alcohol is more expensive there so you'll want to take advantage of the amount they'll allow you to bring in ;).

budgetfood,32r0dn,b1llb3rt,13,Thu Apr 16 02:49:40 2015 UTC,"She got a dinner's worth of tacos.   She didn't even get a dinner's worth of tacos. No meat, no cheese, no sour cream?  I've shopped for grocery for three people for an entire week with not much more than $29. We ate lots of beans and potatoes and things like that but we did eat. Oatmeal and rice were big staples as well. Thank god (or your own personal deity of choice) that my daughter was young enough to still get WIC so she always had milk, cereal, peanut butter, cheese and juice.   When we'd get our food stamps at the beginning of the month, I would buy a pound of bacon or ham, divide it up into 8 portions and individually freeze them to use in beans or rice for a bit of flavor. A big bag of rice. Big bags of pinto and kidney beans, split peas and black eyed peas. Big bag of cornmeal and flour for breads - cornbread, pancakes, etc. Brown sugar for the pancakes and oatmeal.   Toward the middle of the month, I'd go back to the grocery store and buy more beans and rice. Maybe eggs and cheese if there was some on sale. Some jam for the oatmeal and bread again, if it was on sale.   About every three months out grocery store would put hamburger on sale super cheap - I think a 10 pound bag for $7. I'd buy a bag and divide it up to use slowly until the next sale.   My husband and I ate a lot of instant noodles and boxed mac and cheese, and there were times when we'd have flour and water pancakes topped with gravy made from flour and powered milk.   I don't miss those days a single damn bit."

You may not starve if you're careful and buy the right things at the right places, but you'll get damn tired of rice, beans and potatoes for 99% of meals after a while. I don't miss being poor and having to strictly budget everything - the occasional week where I'd splash out and buy rocket, lettuce, halloumi, cherry tomatoes and the cheapest balsamic on the shelves just to have a nice dinner of fresh things, always had to be offset by a week of instant noodles afterwards.

You went for fresh produce!"" is missing the point. The whole point of this is to raise awareness of the fact that food stamps are kind of forcing people to eat more canned and processed foods than they should have to. In the long run, it's cheaper to teach people to cook with produce and good ingredients. Keeps people healthier. But it's GP, so everyone immediately hates her."
budgetfood,32r0dn,MediocreMittens,2,Thu Apr 16 14:39:40 2015 UTC,"I have personally lived on food stamps with no other income before, in the San Francisco area.  I don't know if it varies by state, but in California a single person can qualify for up to $176/mo in food stamps, which is around $40/week.  However, food prices in the SF bay area are generally around 40% higher than they are in the Chicago suburbs, where I now live, so that would be like having $24/wk here in Chicago.  Even so, I was eating a healthy diet and not losing weight.  Eggs, rice, beans, pasta, and potatoes are really cheap.  And in the real world you get the whole month's allotment of food stamps at the start of the month, which enables you to stock up on non-perishable staples at a bulk price and then slowly make your way through them while using the rest of the money to supplement them with fresh vegetables and meat.  Living off of food stamps requires planning and requires keeping leftovers, but it's possible."

A common trick that I see on the internet is to keep a tupperware in the freezer where you keep all the scraps of onion, the little nubs of garlic, the stringy bottoms of celery, carrot etc. When it comes time to make stock, bust those out and save yourself the trouble of wasting fresh vegetables in the stock."

budgetfood,32r0dn,blahblahwordvomit,2,Thu Apr 16 03:47:22 2015 UTC,"My wife and I only budget $100 for groceries twice a month for two people. Divide that by two, and it's $50 per person for half a month.  Half a month is a little longer than 2 weeks, so it's actually a little less than $25 per person per week.  It's not that hard, but you probably can't just take $25 to the store every week and get everything you need.  You probably need $50 or $100 and to just go once every 2 or 4 weeks because it's not like you can buy half a jar of pickles or half a tube of oats or something.  Doing this involves making things from scratch. Buy pasta and pasta sauce. Get some canned vegetables. Get a dozen eggs and some milk. Get some rice, beans, and lentils. You can get some meat but don't go overboard. Meat is just part of a meal, not the meal itself most of the time. Get flour, baking soda, salt, sugar, etc. for baking. Those are one-time things that don't need replaced that often, certainly not all at the same time or every week. I get a lot of cheap tortilla chips because I tend to take whatever leftovers we have and eat them as nachos. Get some bread and lunch meat and you can have sandwiches and use that bread, the milk, and eggs to make French toast. Get the oats in the cardboard tube to use for oatmeal or baking or whatever. Get some apples or something for a quick to-go snack. Get some canned soups for when you really just don't feel like cooking. Get some Spam and mix it up with your scrambled eggs. Use the baking supplies, pasta sauce, cheese, and whatever fresh veggies you get and make a home made pizza. It's not as hard as it sounds. At Aldi you can get Mac N Cheese for 25 cents a box or something ridiculously cheap.  When making something with ground beef or ground turkey, we usually mix it 50/50 with lentils. It doesn't taste much different, but you get double the ""meat"" for not much more in price. If you mix up a pound of beef and a cup of lentils and make taco meat or something, then you will have enough leftovers to eat off of it all week. Making things from scratch all the time can get tiring, so we use a Crock Pot a lot. You can make anything in one of those. To make this budget work, you definitely have to save leftovers, but you don't just have to eat them as-is. You can use the leftovers as ingredients in other meals. For instance, leftover Easter ham could become a topping on your home made pizza or could be diced up and mixed in with scrambled eggs instead of Spam."

There have been times in my life where things have been extremely lean and I've only had $20 to feed a family of 3 for a week.  The fact that she spent money on fresh herbs and limes really struck me as ridiculous.  Someone really struggling would have spent those few dollars on either more beans and rice, or some cheap chicken, or peanut butter...something that would actually fill a person up.  Sidenote:  About 6 months ago I submitted a shopping list and meal plan to feed up to a family of 4 for about $26 a week.  You can look at it here if you're interested.

Would make a massive batch of Peanut Butter Chicken with these ingredients.  Would be between 2500-3000cal per person per day.  And that would be about $29 per person/per week.

Stir it around until the onions are cooked.    Drop in the chicken.  Now, it all depends on what chicken you got.  Let's say it is boneless/skinless chicken thighs. Make sure you salt them and cook them until they are done.  Take them out and chop them up.  Put a couple cups of water in the put, a couple bay leaves are nice but not needed.  Add in cubed potatoes and the lentils.  Cook until the potatoes are just done.  Add back in the chicken and (if you have it) some hot sauce and a 2-3 packets of Goya Saison.  If not, just use salt and pepper.  Heavy on the pepper.  Let that simmer for about 7-8 minutes, then add in enough peanut butter to thicken it to a stew consistency.  If you have a can of tomatoes, put them in there too.  Let it simmer a few more minutes then serve over rice.    Here's a twist:  Before adding the peanut butter, and while potatoes are dropped in.... add more water and cook the rice right in the stock!  Then add the peanut butter to the entire thing."

budgetfood,32afmh,autowikibot,2,Mon Apr 13 09:52:19 2015 UTC,"Sinangag:       Sinangag or garlic fried rice is a fried rice that originated in the Philippines. It is cooked by adding stir-fried garlic to rice and then seasoning the mixture with salt and pepper. Vegetables, meats, and other ingredients may be added but it is generally left bare, because other ingredients may interfere with the flavour of the meat dish eaten with the fried rice. Sinangag is mostly paired with ""drier"" meat dishes, and very rarely with soupier ones. It is a common, everyday breakfast dish, as the rice used in sinangág is normally leftover from the previous evening and thus has a more preferable, firm texture. It is also to avoid wasting rice. Sinangág is a constant component of the breakfast staple tapsilog and its derivatives.

You can swap milder varieties of chilies for the habaneros for a less spicy dish. Pablanos and anaheims would be good. You can soak dry beans overnight to make the dish even cheaper, but this would require longer cooking before adding the other ingredients.  Just go with the beef alone, it will turn out fine. You can add/remove a lot of the ingredients on there and still get a good result. Add a tablespoon or two of Worcestershire too. I know you have it."

budgetfood,324pwb,fromupeast,37,Fri Apr 10 15:47:11 2015 UTC,"I'm very sorry for your loss.   Lasagna can be made a lot easier if you use the no cook noodles. A very simple lasagna with just noodles, sauce, ricotta and mozzarella I think would be good with a salad. Maybe add some spinach to the sauce or ricotta if you'd like. Or frozen stuffed shells, manicotti, or ravioli. Any of these options you could make in large enough batches to have leftovers for a day or two with minimal effort.   I would also suggest things like: polish sausage and frozen pierogis, frozen fish with a baked potato, grilled chicken salad (if your grocery store has a salad bar it makes this option even easier), lunch meats for sandwiches and maybe some macaroni salad from the deli. A lot of grocery stores I go to have a butcher and they often have pre seasoned meats, or even stuffed chicken breasts, etc. That with salad, or even canned veggies, would make a decent meal.   Of course all of these options still require some cooking and putting together, but I think a hot meal really does a lot for your mental well being.   If you want to do absolutely no cooking, I would inquire with a few local restaurants about catering. Getting one or two dishes that your family really enjoys that will last all week may be worth the expense. It's not too terribly expensive, either."

Portion it out and freeze in 1 person servings  -Ground meat - beef, pork, whatever - tinned tomatoes, onions, garlic.  -Tins of beans - any kind. Can add to ragu for chilli or open up a bunch and make bean chilli/casserole with some tomatoes and spices.  -Pasta - sheets, spaghetti, shells, macaroni.  -Whole chickens - cook 2 at a time, low & slow, 350F for 3-4 hours, then shred and freeze in portions for quick fix meals.  Big bag of potatoes - bake in a 450 oven for 1+ hours & serve with beans/cheese/ragu sauce/bacon/eggs.  Fresh tomatoes/cucumber/salad.  Apples, oranges, grapes, bananas.  Big block of strong, tasty cheese - or bag of grated.  Bread - freeze 3 or 4 loaves.  Milk  butter  bacon   eggs - fried/scrambled/hard boiled/poached - 2 eggs are a meal for 1  sausages  -veggies: carrots, peppers, tins of corn, cauliflower, cabbage - all can also be shredded & eaten raw as salad   Hope this is of help."

Now, I miss her but it hurts a lot less. I feel like I value my time after she passed because I felt really close to my family and needed to just feel that I loved her and missed her. I look back on at time as precious in its own way. Still wish she was here instead. But, for me, opening to it helped me get through it. I'm not sure that makes sense. Best to you.   When I'm doing simple cooking for more than one meal, it's all about the staples I can prep to later throw together. I buy lots of frozen veggies, put them in a couple of cookie sheets or pans and roast them with olive oil and salt and pepper. Maybe 400 degrees for 15-20 or more. I've done those frozen tricolored peppers, corn, peas, carrots. Or, just chopped up fresh carrots, beets, potatoes, etc. and cooked a little longer. Broccoli doesn't work well. It burns. So, then I use those roasted veggies as a base for a meal. Sometimes I put grated cheese on he veggies and just have that with bread. But, the pile of veggie leftovers will keep in the fridge for a week. Later, I'll heat some up with sausage in a frypan or put on Mac and cheese.   Also, having a bunch of cooked chicken breasts can be a good base for things.  Simple easy chicken Or, I've thrown a bunch of potatoes in the oven, then had those with salsa and toppings for a meal. Super easy.   Oatmeal and peanut butter is a quick good meal. Yogurt.   Don't forget sandwiches. People can make those for themselves when they get hungry by themselves. Yum.   Hugs."

budgetfood,321hz8,shaleesmo,6,Thu Apr 9 20:42:13 2015 UTC,I used to use it a lot while camping to make cobbler.

Best if done on the coal remains of a large fire.  I suppose you could also just use a casserole dish in your oven though.

budgetfood,321hz8,mcclaner,1 point,Wed Apr 15 07:43:25 2015 UTC,"Depends on the fruit, mostly. Recipes all around!  But some simple guidelines:    You can use as much fruit as can fit. You bake the fruit with the pancakes. Fruits like banana, apple, pear, pineapple, etc can be put in the pan, and then the batter is added on top of those. Raisins and most berries need to be added immediately after the batter when the batter is still liquid, but the bottom is slightly cooked already. This ensures they don't become burned, hard black disgusting shitstains but instead become soft, nice and sweet delicious moist pieces of heaven. Bacon is added before the batter, fried out a bit, then the batter is added, then optionally cheese. Dutch pancakes are not usually covered in maple syrup because we don't really have maple trees. Instead we use sugar, sugarsyrup, jam/jelly/marmalade, cinnamon sugar, appelstroop (applesyrup?), rock-candy sugar and many more of those typical Dutch things. Even more savory toppings like cream chive cheese + salmon upon a plain pancake are delicious as a fresh afternoon snack.   You can make it as complicated as you want it to be.  This wikipedia page gives a basic, but incomplete idea of the Pannenkoek."

I don't really use nonstick for anything other than crepes and cooking eggs they're super easy to clean.  I have a carbon steel pan I cook everything from and casserole cocotte with lid and everything I can cook on the fire AND put in the oven.  in terms of tools you don't need much get a pair of full metal tongs and a wooden spoon, maybe heat resistant silicone spatula (usually red handles). you're pretty much set.  in terms of knives, you can get by with a chef knife and paring knife OR if you're not scared and have great knife skills you get one chinese chef cleaver and do everything there. i don't recommend anyone but chinese master chefs doing that."

budgetfood,31ydxg,ktt3ja,2,Sun Apr 12 23:41:43 2015 UTC,"both a crock pot and a pressure cooker are amazing kitchen tools for their specific uses but shouldn't be the only option. if you're on a budget it's better to get multi use items. single use equipment limits your choices.  spaghetti bolognese is great because you can literally make bucket loads of the pasta sauce and freeze it. let it cool before storing it in either single serving size plastic tubs or ziplock bags (i pour enough sauce for a single serve into a ziplock bag and seal it up let it freeze flat). just make the pasta to order. pretty much any pasta sauce that you can make without the pasta really.   the same with curry. although I don't really like doing this, my ex-gf loves it so whatever. but I'll make a bunch of ""japanese"" curry (I make the roux myself but it's identical to the japanese curry cubes you buy at the store. mix it in with vegetables like potatoes, carrots, onion and green peas. I prefer using mince beef in my curry. and then it's just rice you have to make to order.  it's good because even when I'm busy at work she can come home to a home cooked meal made by ""me"". one thing I've learnt if you're a workaholic, make sure your partner is well fed and always laughing. being funny and being a good cook definitely is in my favour.  also I make loads of mini-quiches I make everything up and the instead of cooking it in a regular flan pan, I make it in a muffin/cupcake tray. cook as you do the freeze them, just need to be reheated in the oven.  and waffles, instead of egos regular cooked waffles freeze really well too. so I buy frozen berries or chocolate chips and make a whole bunch of waffles and freeze them. just put it in the oven to heat up again.   in concerns to cooking Chinese food you're not in industry cut it up however the fuck you want most of it is sautéed in a wok anyways. just make sure you hone your knife each time you use it and sharpen it regularly. I sharpen my knives every ~3 months or so. but I use my knife 70hrs a week.  cocotte pots are fan-fucking-tastic. I love the shit outta mine. just make sure there are no plastic handles. they will bubble up. they will melt. they will burn you. oven safe everything.  in terms of recipes websites I like The Smitten Kitchen because the photos are pretty. I have no affiliation with whoever that is. also Dennis The Prescott. again. pretty photos. no affiliation. lucky peach on youtube is great. same with Mind of A Chef on youtube is rad. anything Anthony Bourdain is cool.

budgetfood,31ydxg,5rc8t,1 point,Tue Apr 14 17:18:01 2015 UTC,a electric crock pot is essentially a dutch oven with an automatic temperature control.
budgetfood,31ydxg,dhjin,1 point,Tue Apr 14 17:56:12 2015 UTC,Exactly. With timers et al which act as a benefit...
budgetfood,31ydxg,5rc8t,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:26:00 2015 UTC,"The beauty of a crock pot is that the heat comes from the bottom and the sides and is kept low and consistent with a thermostat.  The heavy lid locks in moisture, so you truly can just set it and forget it.  Just walk away for a few hours and come back to a beautiful braise, stew or chili.  I am a big proponent of the crock pot for braising.  But, maybe you have limited space. Or maybe you have cats that might jump up on the counter and burn themselves on a hot crock pot while you’re away at work.  After all, the crock pot was designed to take the place of a Dutch oven in the first place, so cooks wouldn’t have to heat up their oven to cook a meal.  The main concern in adapting a crock pot recipe for a Dutch oven is temperature regulation.  Most crock pots have two heat settings: low and high. Depending on the source, these could convert to about 175°F and 195°F, respectively, or it could just refer to low and high wattage and not temperature at all.  Since there is no Low or High setting on an oven thermostat, we kind of have to take a guess.  One thing about cooking in a Dutch oven inside a conventional oven is that usually the cooking process is a bit faster than using a Crock Pot.  If a crock pot recipe calls for 8-10 hours of cooking, you can probably complete the cooking in the oven in about 3 1/2-4 hours.  That doesn’t mean, however, that you’ll have the temperature twice as high in the oven.  When using a Dutch oven, I generally heat all the ingredients on the stove top until they reach a boil and then put them in a preheated 210-225° F oven.  This very low oven temperature will ensure that your food reaches a safe temperature but will cook proteins gently so that they stay moist and tender.  While I have seen braising temperature recommendations as high as 325°F, I maintain that braising should be done slowly and at a low temperature.  I would absolutely use a Dutch oven in place of a crock pot if I needed to, and I would keep the oven set no higher than 225 degrees F.  I would cook the meat until fork tender, which I generally find takes between 3-4 hours.  Other than being able to walk away from it, I found no advantages to using a crock pot over a dutch oven. What really turned me off was a recipe for a roast where you first had to brown the meat in a dutch oven and then put it into the slow cooker and add the other ingredients. If I've got it in the dutch oven already, what is the slow cooker doing for me? it's unnecessary.  A slow cooker doesn’t reduce liquid the same way a Dutch oven does, so the resulting braises and stews may be thinner. However, you can still reduce the dish yourself — just remove the contents (or slow cooker insert) from the machine and reduce on the stovetop. The difference is in evaporation--you don't get that in a Crockpot.  TL;DR  A cocotte without the lid in the oven doubles up as a roasting tray. roast a bird etc.  put a shallow pan of water and some wood chips, it's a smoker.   on top of the fire it's a cast iron pan.   fill it up with oil it's a deep fryer.  the dutch oven is more versatile."

Beyond that- beans are a great protein. You could pre-make bean burritos for your work meals as well. Oatmeal makes a more filling meal at home, and with a tablespoon or 2 of peanut butter can be super filling.   However, this budget is going to be difficult to sustain over a long time.

budgetfood,31vwfk,DarkApostleMatt,7,Wed Apr 22 11:52:29 2015 UTC,"My former grocery budget when I had my own apartment was 100 a month, and every third month was only 80 a month. The reason it was cheaper on the third month was because of the things I bought that lasted several months, and the way I planned my meals. So, this may not work out perfectly for you, but I can definitely offer some insight.  Breakfast: Grab a can of rolled oats (the 3 minutes in the microwave kind). They're healthy. They are boring as hell if you don't add stuff, but we're going for cheap survival here so grab a can of rolled oats, and I hope you've got some cinnamon and brown sugar in the house.   Food you can leave in the car all day (Lunch): I'm partial to potatoes for stuff like this. Slow cooker potato dishes seem to taste good at any temperature. I'm not sure how good that is in terms of bacterial growth though... Something to consider. The Ramen would also be alright here if you have a way to heat the water up.  Dinner: The cheapest meat I've been able to find is usually chicken sold in a 10 pound bag called chicken quarters. Cut it up yourself into individual portions, wrap those, freeze them, and pull one out for each day's dinner. You can usually get veggies to steam on the cheap to make your food a little less boring. Peppers, carrots, and potatoes are my go-to cheap options for steaming up.   If this doesn't look it'll get you through the week: Ask your friends if they can spot you a home cooked meal or two, or hit up a food bank. There is no shame in asking for help. People want to help people, so let them.   Breakfast: Rolled Oats  Lunch: Ramen (or potatoes)  Dinner: Chicken and Veggies"
budgetfood,31vwfk,Vroonkle,1 point,Wed Apr 8 21:42:28 2015 UTC,"This is solid advice.  For lunch, you can also roll up cooked potatoes in tortillas with anything you might have--a cooked egg, some refried beans, some cheese. Roll them up in foil and that's lunch."
budgetfood,31vwfk,jenilynTX,12,Wed Apr 8 20:31:35 2015 UTC,"Ramen is actually cheap but not very nutritious for its calorie load. Some of the cheapest food has to be cooked unfortunately! For now, I say supplement your existing foods with some fresh in season (sale) fruits and vegetables like apples and oranges. In the long run, investing in a good cooler and/or thermos will allow you to purchase items in bulk, cook them, and bring them to work. Cheap great sources of protein are hard boiled eggs, nuts and nut butters and beans. Dried beans can be cooked, then frozen for later use in smaller portions."

First of all, a cooler would be nice for drinks and things. Both coolers and ice are cheap at Walmart. As for food, get things that will last as long as possible, but are still somewhat healthy. Peanut butter and banana sandwiches were one of my go-to's. Rice cakes are good. I would get the caramel corn ones and slather it with peanut butter and raisins. Pouches of tuna or salmon can just be eaten straight out of the pouch, or mixed with an avocado to made a sandwich. Trail mix is awesome, not the kind that's basically M&M's with obstacles, but actual fruits and nuts. Protein shakes. One small jar can go a long way, and you really only need to mix it with water. Fresh fruits and veggies to your taste of course. Pretzels are cheap and awesome (Not the kinds loaded with weird flavors). Hope that helps a little :)"

budgetfood,31vwfk,DudeManFoo,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:26:28 2015 UTC,"About a two weeks ago, I heard about ""butter coffee"". (coffee with 1 Table spoon of coconut oil, 1 Table spoon of butter) I started drinking it in the morning. I am not hungry before lunch and I have more energy. On top of all that, I lost about 4 lbs. Pretty cheap too, even with grass fed butter.     I am also thinking I will start a lunch that will be the same most days of 1 muffin from fresh ground wheat, boiled egg(s), and a smoothie made at home.     Mainly for health, but it is pretty cheap as well."
budgetfood,31vwfk,guavaa,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:48:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, but you won't be eating a lot. You genuinely can't eat big meals and you can't eat every time you're hungry or eat until you're full. Meals stop when you run out of the food you've planned to eat, not when you feel sated. I was in this situation for a few months. I have a pretty poor appetite so I managed, but it wasn't healthy. I second the suggestions to go to a food bank. Or ask your friends for a loan- it sucks, but they will understand. It's not extravagant to ask for help to eat.  Eggs are your friend. Definitely experiment with different egg recipes- that will keep things from getting boring.    This was my go-to way to spend $20, with approximate prices in parentheses. Of course, it should go without saying that you are buying the cheapest versions of all of these. Also, be wary of perishables- when you're on a tight budget, you can't really afford to have a loaf of bread go moldy. Some stores are better than others at pulling older products off the shelf, so be sure to check the best-by date. Rifle around on the shelf and find the product with the latest date.   My list:  Bread ($2.50)  Eggs ($2.50)  Butter ($3)  Pasta ($1/package, but you should get a few packages so probably budget $3 or $4)  Cheap marinara sauce (Target's generic stuff is usually $2, sometimes on sale for $1)  Some frozen veggies ($3 or $4)  Some pre-cut romaine lettuce ($2)  Salad dressing ($3)  Altogether, this comes out to $20-$25, so you can make it work if you walk into the store with a $20 in hand (assuming groceries aren't taxable in your area- if they are, buy the cheapest frozen veggies available and/or cut out the bread). With this menu, you can have salad, pasta (tip: add 1/2 tbsp melted butter per serving of marinara sauce- it will taste way better), veggies, eggs any way you can imagine, and buttered toast. It will get repetitive- you'll be eating pasta every night- but you can still do a lot. Also, note that although frozen veggies might be more expensive than fresh (depending on what vegetable we're talking about and whether or not it's in season), they won't go bad before you have a chance to eat them so you reduce the risk of having to throw out food (and therefore money). If you plan on living with such a tight food budget for more than a few weeks, I would recommend frozen for sure. If after this week you can go back to spending more money on food then I might consider fresh if they're cheaper.  Here are some example meals, assuming that your vegetable was asparagus, because that was my favorite (...although I just saw that you requested meals which would keep well in the car, and these don't exactly fit the bill... oops):  Monday night: pasta and sautéed asparagus with salt and pepper  Tuesday night: pasta and salad  Wednesday night: pasta and asparagus baked in the oven   Thursday night: pasta and salad (you can make your own croutons from a slice or two of bread if you have some olive oil on hand!)  Friday night: at this point I am usually sick of pasta so I have an egg or two on toast for dinner with some asparagus Saturday night: pasta and the last of the salad  Sunday night: pasta and the last of the asparagus  Breakfasts are all eggs and toast. Pasta sauces are marinara or maybe some browned butter when you feel sick of marinara. If you eat a late breakfast (10 or 11am) then you can usually make it by on just two meals a day. If you want, you can even make a hollandaise sauce- it will take 3 of your dozen eggs but I think it's worth it, it tastes really good on eggs (egg on toast with hollandaise, mmmm) and on asparagus. Experiment with cooking eggs different ways- sunny side up, poached, scrambled, with and without herbs.   It's no fun, but you can do it! But that said- please please please reach out to other people in your life. Everyone should be able to go to sleep on a full stomach."

budgetfood,31py46,UyhAEqbnp,2,Tue Apr 7 06:09:21 2015 UTC,"That's a really limited way to go. I might suggest getting a camp stove or hotplate, as either can boil water, and also accommodate a small pot or frying pan. You might find this drastically expands your choice of what you're able to eat: as well as give you the ability to eat more quality foods, which will make you healthier and feel better. A small kitchen kit that can fit inside a small-ish plastic tote (use the tote as a sink for washing dishes after meals) and includes a small pan, pot, knife and cutting board, as well as a plastic place setting with ""silver""-wear might be worth it.  All that said, I know this doesn't fit your parameters. With what you have now, you have options, as long as you buy cold-storage food daily or more often than daily. That way there's no need to store cold, even if you buy cold. Fruits and vegetables are going to be your friend though. Remember: they grow in the ground- so they don't really require cold storage in the short-term. I think you'll find citrus fruits will be awesome. You can eat raw, squeeze onto other stuff for flavor, squeeze for juice. They are packed with nutrients and natural sugars and keep very well.   Obviously- whole-grain breads and canned meats are good. Don't underestimate salt and pepper- they can do a lot when something just lacks flavor. Mustard!!! Buy it. You can keep it dry stored for 1-2 months before spoiling. It should serve as your salad dressing, your sandwich/hotdog/burger condiment, etc.   Here's an example meal:  1/2 head romaine lettuce 1 can precooked tuna/chicken mustard  whole grain bread/tortilla/pita apple/orange for side  Line bread/tortilla/pita with lettuce, squeeze some mustard, add meat. Add a squeeze of lemon if you want. Salt and pepper. If you're willing to use knife and cutting board, chop up and add a roma tomato, or a stick of celery, or some onion, or cucumber, etc.   Limited resources= higher importance of improvisation. Approach your meals as an opportunity to be inventive. Start experimenting. Aim for having two weeks' worth of meals that provide variety while using entire store-packages of ingredients."

If you invest in a high-quality cooler, you can keep it cool using frozen bottles of water.  Stick two or three in a friend's freezer, and switch them out every day or two.  No melty mess!  Another great option for things, like eggs, which are best cooked on a flame, is an alcohol stove.  You can make them yourself from beer cans."

If your interested in how much chili can change and how much better it can get check this out. http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/pressure-cooker-chili-recipe.html  Make your own chili powder first off. Never buy it in the store it's closer to sawdust than chili powder.  I personally don't like beans in my chili. So i tend to leave those out of any recipe I am making. I also find the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce alton brown uses far superior in taste and heat level and I can't leave it out of almost any chili I make. His list of meat is more expensive so you can trade that out with what you want. The whole deglaze the meat with beer and thicken with chips is genius though.

Here are some additional tips to make this recipe even more budget friendly: -Use whatever ground meat you can find on sale! Consider using a 50/50 mix of ground beef/pork etc depending on the weekly sales  -Consider reducing the amount of ground beef called for in the recipe and increase the beans.  Add as many beans until you reach your desired thickness for the chili -Replace the canned beans with dried beans (soak dried beans over night, rinse well and simmer in double the amount of water until soft, then add to recipe)  -Purchase spices and staple items in bulk which is normally much cheaper - When ground beef goes on sale, consider making a double or triple batch and freezing for future meals"

budgetfood,314vmn,AltoidNerd,74,Thu Apr 2 00:40:25 2015 UTC,I don't have a problem with the recipe but this is not gumbo nor does it resemble gumbo in any meaningful way.
budgetfood,314vmn,HeidrunTheMighty,4,Thu Apr 2 01:19:59 2015 UTC,"Apologies, see comment to /u/thecowboyspider"
budgetfood,314vmn,TheCowboySpider,40,Thu Apr 2 02:25:34 2015 UTC,Gotta say this is not a cheap Gumbo. It is a cheap Jambalaya.  Gumbo is a soup. Etouffee is a stew. Jambalaya is a rice dish. (Think about the three in increasing quantities of rice and decreasing quantities of roux/stock)
budgetfood,314vmn,Daveezie,21,Thu Apr 2 01:54:54 2015 UTC,"That's not even jambalaya, that is just red beans and rice."
budgetfood,314vmn,bringindabacon,10,Thu Apr 2 03:22:25 2015 UTC,"It's not really a jambalaya either.  The thing is there are certain methods and ingredients that set jambalaya, gumbo, or any other cajun/creole dish off from just a plain rice dish, soup, or whatever.  What OP has is a red beans and rice packet with Italian sausage.  That may be tasty but it has zero cajun/creole influence.  Not to go off on a tangent but being New Orleanian I see a ton of ""cultural appropriation"" when it comes to our food and it's frustrating.  Even if OP made a soup with these ingredients it wouldn't be gumbo.  And no matter what OP does with these ingredients it's not jambalaya.  Jambalaya is meat+trinity cooked down then stock then rice.  Add tomatoes for creole and hold tomatoes for cajun.  Gumbo needs to be started with a real roux then trinity.  If those two components aren't used it's not gumbo.  And not to be a complete ass but Italian sausage is a complete no-no.  Cajun or andoulle for authentic taste but plain smoked pork if you can't find something else.  I've seen kielbasa in a pinch but I'm not a fan.  Definitely not Italian.  Cajun and creole foods have deep roots in French and African cuisine so Italian flavors will clash heavily with the dish.   That being said I'm sure OP's food tasted fine and on a Wednesday night when I'm getting home from work that's about all that matters."
budgetfood,314vmn,TheKidOfBig,1 point,Thu Apr 2 05:01:43 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah, now I'm all stoked to make some creole/Cajun/anything from down there.  Do y'all do much in the way of spicy foods? Like, proper spicy? I live in New Mexico, and I often think that y'all must be the only food culture in the US that could compete with ours in terms of spiciness."
budgetfood,314vmn,sleaux_meaux,2,Thu Apr 2 08:21:56 2015 UTC,Normally the really spicy food doesn't come from a restaurant. But every table has hot sauce and Tony's. It's normally the home cooked stuff that has a great kick.
budgetfood,314vmn,TheKidOfBig,1 point,Thu Apr 2 13:21:35 2015 UTC,"In that case, it sounds like we might actually eat spicier food here on the whole. There are definitely a lot of New Mexican joints around here that serve incredibly spicy food. We love our red and green chile! In fact, when I was a server, if people would ask whether or not the chile is hot, I found the best thing to ask was ""well, are you from around here?"" If the answer is yes, then no, it's not that spicy. If you're not from around here, I don't know, probably it is.   We eat a lot of chile! Seriously, a lot. We judge places by the quality of their chile. In fact, it's even our official state question- ""red or green?"" We put it in pretty much every single food, now that I think about it. I mean, I don't personally like chile wine or beer, but people do make it and consume it...  Come visit us some time! It's a beautiful place."
budgetfood,314vmn,TheCowboySpider,3,Thu Apr 2 14:36:57 2015 UTC,"We definitely can handle our spice. And if you go to a more hole in the wall place you can find a place that isn't gonna skimp but its similar to what you were saying if you are a native that what you get in the restaurant wont be spicy to you because they have to tone it down for the tourists.  Generally when traveling waiters are often quick to warn me that a meal is gonna be ""spicy"" to which the usual response is a laugh abd then ""don't worry I'm from Louisiana."

budgetfood,30wjn6,marshmallopeepz,5,Tue Mar 31 16:29:09 2015 UTC,"I am going to go from memory so I will give the broad strokes. Sorry for not being specific but I am watching a crazy documentary on Scientology so I am a bit distracted. It is actually pretty simple - 3/4 cup of each colour lentils, a quarter of a small onion, chopped up really, really small, a couple of carrots, cut into thick circles, two small potatoes, diced, a small can of diced tomatoes dumped in, vegetable broth to cover all. Oh and spices. I use pepper, a clove of garlic, and crushed red chili flakes. Sometimes I throw in a handful of wild, white, or brown rice, if I have it. Helps thicken it. And I add a can of chick peas (drained) in the last hour. Cook on low for 9 hours. If you want to speed cooking, you can boil the lentils for ten minutes on the stove before slow cooking. Important to cook lentils thoroughly or you'll have a sore tummy.  The best part about this is you can't really screw it up if you know crock pot basics, and how to flavour. It can end up soupy or stew-y depending on your liquid content and both of those options are great!   I pack it into a large glass container and take it to work for the whole week- keeps me full and meets my nutritional needs. Sometimes I eat it with crackers.  I buy lentils in bulk at Bulk Barn, as well as my rice and vegetable stock cubes. Chick peas are a dollar a can at No Frills, as well as the tomatoes. Produce is pennies if you are just buying small, single items. Super easy to keep it cheap and simple!   Sorry if I left anything out- like I said, I'm distracted :) happy cooking! I hope you try it and like it!"

budgetfood,30wjn6,ChrissyWhit,5,Tue Mar 31 15:32:54 2015 UTC,"Hey Big Boss. Honestly, for one person (and occasional pals), $200 is a massive food budget. Read up on BudgetBytes and you'll find a bunch of recipes that you can double and freeze.  If I were to give some specific tips, though:   If you're a usual carnivore, try to tone down the number of meals with meat in them. Meat tends to be pretty expensive and inflates the cost of a meal quickly. When you do buy meat, buy it with the goal of stretching it as far as possible. For example, I bought a pound of ground turkey recently, half of which went into a turkey chili (the ""Weeknight Chili"" from Budgetbytes - total of 6 portions). I mixed the other half with grated onion, garlic, seasoning, and bread crumbs, and fried up some turkey patties for dinner one night to make a sandwich, plus some caramelize onions. I had a few leftover patties, which I slice up and put on pizza with jalapenos (BudgetBytes also has a really easy pizza dough recipe - homemade pizza is the the most brilliant thing I've discovered in the past year). Another example is chorizo. You can buy a package for relatively cheap, and chop a couple links into each batch of soup or stew you make. The one package of chorizo will end up stretching over a week and a half's worth of food. Buy these kinds of Ball Jars. The wide mouth is important. If I were going to have to restock a whole new kitchen, this would be one of my first purchases. You can buy a pack of 12 of them at the grocery store by the pickling shit for probably around $8. Whenever I make a batch of food, I portion the food in there, maybe top it with a 1-inch layer of rice if it's a stew-ish/curry-ish thing, and then put it in the fridge. On the way to work I can just grab a jar. If you sterilize the jars carefully (microwave is useful for this - some water in the bottom of the jar, then you steam the shit out of them - just sanitize the lids separately), then the food also lasts a ridiculously long time in these jars. I've been criticized by food safety peeps for not following proper canning protocol, though. Dried beans are great. Lentils are even better. The latter have a bit of a hippy-ish reputation, but they both can sit in bags in your pantry for the better part of a millennium. Lentils are also stupid easy to cook - basically just like rice. You add it to the pot and all of a sudden you have a lentil stew. Take the budget balance you'll inevitably have left over, and buy boxed red wine."
budgetfood,30wjn6,OlivettiFourtyFour,2,Tue Mar 31 18:53:30 2015 UTC,"beans and rice, make a big batch, have it as a main dish one night then as a side with the left overs."

You can just make some type of sauce or mix/match all kinds of stuff to make a variety of dishes. I would cook the chicken, saute onion, add garlic last 30 seconds. Add a can or two of black beans and tomatoes. Add chipotle pepper in adobo, home made chili powder, cilantro. Let it simmer until it thickens into a sauce and add cilantro at the end. Tear up the chicken thighs and toss the skin if you want. Chop that up and add it. Server over brown rice. Real cheap and pretty easy.  You can do asian style if you want, indian.

The Instapot works as an electric pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker and cooks up stalks and bone broths in a couple hours!  You would have the initial purchase price but then you could start making more meals yourself. From what I understand, you can cook a whole roast dinner in as little as 1-2 hours.  You can also just toss in and let the machine do the cooking which is great when you are not into cooking.  For budget meals, this allows you to pick up any cuts of meat that are on sale (tougher cuts are great for slow cookers or pressure cookers and yields super tender results)  I would also look into lentils.

Maybe not the absolute cheapest, but you can get very high quality bulk foods for very reasonable prices. You can get the super premium stuff like real brown sugar, real sushi rice, real chocolate syrup, real whole grain flour (not the high fructose corn syrup soaked BS) etc etc that you can't even find in local stores. They basically sell full pallet boxes of food so you are cutting out the middle man of the grocer. And the best part is it gets shipped direct to your door so I don't have to lug 25 pound sacks of rice home on my bicycle.   I've got a whole pantry full stocked up from buying in bulk from them."

budgetfood,30iiy3,JirdyBirdy,8,Fri Mar 27 18:10:57 2015 UTC,"This recipe usually lasted for about a week for me. Roastd pork for about $15 where I lived. Just use regular salt and whatever herbs and spices you have on hand. I used this recipe on beef as well but much shorter time in the oven. I have successfully cooked this recipe without banana leaves.  assuming that's $30-$40 worth of meat for two weeks. use the rest on potatoes and hardy-leafy vegetables (broccoli, kale, mustard green and such). For 2 weeks worth, that's about $10-15 where I lived. Since you mentioned that you can cook. You can make potatoes and stir-fried mix veggies, which should fill you up for not too much calories unless you go overboard with potatoes or cooking fat. Maybe switch things up with fresh salad and mashed potatoes. Sweet potatoes are lower than potatoes on glycemic index so you can substitute that as well.  With roughly about $30 leftover. I would personally buy berries and almonds or cashews for snack. berries are relatively low in sugar  when compare to other fruits and I just love almonds and cashews.  Eating on budget and reducing calories are pretty mentally challenging, especially at the same time. I hope what I have for you here are helpful. Good luck!"

budgetfood,30iiy3,Darigandevil,6,Fri Mar 27 18:59:56 2015 UTC,"I too have had to give up junk food and made the switch to healthier eating. Using myfitnesspal helped a lot to see just how many extra calories I was consuming. You have to be honest with it or it won't work. Record EVERYTHING! Here is what an average 2 weeks looked like for me when I started my diet.  Breakfast- 1-2 eggs (best hard boiled for an on the go meal) 1 banana, oatmeal or greek yourgurt. Average about $20  Lunch- Salad heavy. Usually shopped around fresh produce sales. To truely eat cheaply one must not be picky. My salads would include lettuce, bell peppers, cucumber, broccoli, red onion, mushrooms, carrots, some dried fruit (if on sale) and a little of balsamic vinegarette dressing. Remember it's counterintuitive to drench the healthy salad with blobs of ranch. All my veggies are raw. It isn't that appetizing at first but after a week I got use to it and you will too. You have change your taste bugs to be successful. My salad would run me under $10 a week easily. I would through on a hard boiled egg too sometimes for added protein.  Dinner- for dinners something as easy as a chicken quesadilla with whole wheat tortillas and some cheddar cheese. Canned beans are a huge help. They give needed protein and usually run under a dollar a can. Rice is great as a filler just don't over do it cause all the grain can add up quickly. Also frozen veggies are a great and cheap way to beef up a meal.  Snacks- Veggies. Get use to them they are the secret to healthy living. A bag of baby carrots costs a dollar and can last me for up to four day snacking on them vs a snickers bar that costs a $1.20 and will only satisfy my hunger for about an hour.   Once you get use to them you won't even think of fast food as an option anymore. Everything will start to taste sweeter, saltier and more savory without any additives. Changing my diet was the best decision I've ever made. I can truely appreciate the wide tastes that food has to offer instead of the crap that was put in front of me growing up. Hope this helped and good luck.  P.S. remember that protein in general is always pricier but that's okay because we don't need a lot of it to eat a healthy balanced diet anyway. Veggies are the star of the show and the more colorful and diverse your plate is generally the better it is for you. Happy eating!"

Bulk cooking meals is a great way to get over fast food, as your meals are ready to go right when you want them.  I've been making chicken with rice/sweet potato with vegetables in bulk. Freezes and microwaves well, nutritious and tastes amazing.  2 chicken breasts, 1 cup rice/potato, half a cup of mixed veg comes to less than 500 calories.  I marinade the chicken breasts (about 20 a time) for 2 days in hot or bbq marinade and bake them in the oven for 20-25 minutes. I use onion, corgette, brocolli, spinach, or whatever frozen vegetables are in my freezer for the veg. Peas go great with the rice.  A bit of lemon juice and some herbs make the veg yummy.   I got the idea from this video.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbH9PPRBfc"

Buy a small whole turkey or a good sized turkey breast.  You can cook it in a Reynolds oven bag following the directions on the box, although their cooking times on the box are a little long, you can find a minutes per lb chart online.  With a good sized breast you can get 6 or 7 lbs of meat for $25 where I live. You will have a lot of meat that gives you lots of options.  I will usually make steamed veggies such as broccoli, baby carrots or green beans which are quite inexpensive when bought fresh.  Additionally I will boil some new potatoes which are inexpensive per lb.  this will give you lots of leftovers that you can have for dinners.  You can take some of the meat make turkey sandwiches or mix it with celery & mayo and make ""chicken salad"" made with turkey for lunches and sandwiches.  You can take the carcass and boil it with some veggies and add some pasta to make turkey noodle soup.  You can take some tortillas and cheese and make quesadillas.  The options are endless and while the initial purchase may be $25 or $30 you can get a whole lot of different meal options at a low cost per meal/snack"
budgetfood,30iiy3,Akpheart,3,Fri Mar 27 22:05:36 2015 UTC,"First off just asking these questions is going to get you a great start in the right direction so nice job on the start!  My recommendation is to start out by trying to eliminate specific items that put you in a path of bad eating. Is it fried food items, ranch, cheese, or candy that are your worst enemies?  Just knowing ahead of time what you should steer clear from is a great head start. After that start to find snacks that you can bring with you or fast food / fast casual restaurants that have snacks that you can enjoy, but don't conflict with the food items that you are trying to eliminate from your diet. The best food items you can choose are raw produce, and if it's local or in season all the better.  Lots of markets have ready to eat meals and sides that are fresh and raw if you need something quick. I really appreciate what you do and I hope this helps. Cheers buddy!!"

budgetfood,30fhxa,W_Edwards_Deming,15,Fri Mar 27 06:06:43 2015 UTC,In what way is halal more cruel than an industrial slaughterhouse?
budgetfood,30fhxa,colinsteadman,-12,Fri Mar 27 06:10:12 2015 UTC,"Industrial slaughter houses put the animal to sleep before slaughter so there isn't any suffering.  From what I've seen, halal animals just have there throats slit while they are wide awake. There are some very distressing videos on YouTube, which I have watched, showing it. They are very NSFL, so if you hunt them out, remember what has been seen (and heard) cannot be unseen."
budgetfood,30fhxa,pipocaQuemada,18,Fri Mar 27 06:19:25 2015 UTC,"If done properly, animals don't actually react to having their throat slit with a razor sharp blade:   To determine whether cattle feel the throat cut, at one plant the author deliberately applied the head restrainer so lightly that the animals could pull their heads out. None of the 10 cattle moved or attempted to pull their heads out. Observations of hundreds of cattle and calves during kosher slaughter indicated that there was a slight quiver when the knife first contacted the throat. Invasion of the cattle’s flight zone by touching its head caused a bigger reaction. In another informal experiment, mature bulls and Holstein cows were gently restrained in a head holder with no body restraint. All of them stood still during the cut and did not appear to feel it. Disturbing the edges of the incision or bumping it against the equipment, however, is likely to cause pain. Observations by the author also indicated that the head must be restrained in such a manner that the incision does not close back over the knife. Cattle and sheep struggle violently if the edges of the incision touch during the cut.   On the other hand, many of the methods used to stun animals aren't 100% effective, or are done improperly at some slaughter houses.  You can find NSFL videos of almost any kind of slaughter.  After all, as Temple Grandin also notes,   Even though exsanguination is not an approved method of euthanasia by the AVMA, the author has observed that kosher slaughter performed with the long, straight, razor-sharp knife does not appear to be painful. This is an area that needs further research. One can conclude that it is probably less distressful than poorly performed captive—bolt or electrical stunning methods, which release large amounts of epinephrine."
budgetfood,30fhxa,W_Edwards_Deming,13,Fri Mar 27 15:01:10 2015 UTC,"I find it very hard to believe that it is worse than industrial slaughter. Have you heard of ""The eternal Jew?""

budgetfood,30fhxa,colinsteadman,5,Fri Mar 27 06:26:28 2015 UTC,"im sure industrial slaughter isn't much fun for the animals.  I've seen videos of them being very skittish and abviously afraid to know that. But having watched a couple of videos of halal places... I wouldn't give them the same weighting, halal is barbaric. Having seen a cow have its neck cut to the spine while its awake and conscious, as it thrashes about in what must be agony and total shock and fear... Nope!  I've not heard of the Jew thing.

budgetfood,30fhxa,Gustyarse,1 point,Fri Mar 27 00:13:54 2015 UTC,"I've never done buttermilk myself, but I THINK it's usually something you soak it in? After you essentially marinate it in the butter milk, repeat the blot-flour-egg-flour mixture. And don't forget to let the chicken rest for a few minutes after dipping it, it'll help it stick better."
budgetfood,30fhxa,Gustyarse,2,Fri Mar 27 00:29:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, apparently the buttermilk has acid which helps the ""brining"" process.  I think it also reacts well with the baking powder to make it crisper.   I will try resting it next time, thanks."

If your meat has skin, rub yellow mustard all over it (just a little more than it takes to tinge it yellow) then put it in your breading mix. Will have the crispest skin ever with great texture, and you won't taste the mustard.   If the meat does not have skin, dip it once in flour, then an egg wash, then in your breading mix."

budgetfood,308aus,Darth_Corleone,6,Wed Mar 25 16:59:30 2015 UTC,"Place the following in the slow cooker: chicken thighs marinated in Sriracha, chopped onion, a few garlic cloves, a handful of small potatoes, chopped baby corn, a can of sliced water chestnuts, a can of chickpeas, and enough chicken broth (or seasoned water) to alllllmost cover the contents of the crock pot. Add a good bit of yellow curry powder, then add a little more. I said MORE!!! There you go.... Now stir it up and let it cook all day on low. Skim the fat floating on top after 6+ hours, then add a can of (well shaken) coconut milk. Let it cook another 30+ minutes to an hour, then serve.   We like ours over jasmine rice but you can use more potatoes and have that as your starch if you prefer. You can sear the thighs on a hot skillet before you add them to the slow cooker at the start of the process, but this is optional and adds to the clean up. I always do, though, and use some of the chicken brother to deglaze the pan when they're nicely seared (superficially seared/browned, not ""cooked"" ; they will cook plenty in the crock pot, so you're just doing this for the added layers of flavor). Finally, you can stretch this meal to great lengths by adding more chickpeas, more potatoes, or by dropping a few raw (still in the shell) eggs into the broth an hour or so before you add the coconut milk. The eggs absorb some of the color and flavor of the broth, and we love them. Just make sure you don't crack them if you stir after you drop them in!"

Beef, pork, chicken, all work with any combination of flavors you like.  Choose some of your favorites:   Jalapenos Onion Garlic Your favorite soup mix Coconut milk Soy/Teriyaki Sauce Starches (see below) Fresh herbs (rosemary/ginger can work wonders!) Cream cheese (this is a favorite, providing a way to turn any meal into a cheap, delicious dip when slow cooked long enough).   When using beef and pork, be careful of the fat content.  Too much, and you'll have to strain out the edible meat from the lake of grease.  If it's pork chops or leaner beef, just let it roll.  Cheap crock pottery is one of our favorites, and cook times can be all over the place.  3 hours?  Great.  12 hours?  That's great too.  Many people add starch (pasta, rice, potato).  I'm all for it, but compared to slow cooked meat, starches are pretty picky about cook times.  Too long and you have mush, too short and you have raw potato and/or crunchy rice/pasta.  With these, practice makes perfect, but I usually skip them, as crock potting is a ""no rules"" zone for me, and I don't wanna watch the clock."

It's this site: www.thuisafgehaald.nl Maybe you can use it as a source of information/inspiration. You can either sign up as eater or the one that cooks and it is location based. I think it's lacking in food suppliers at the moment and it should have more of them. I was lucky for a while because there was a very active cook near my last place of work. Twice a week she cooked a very good Indonesian meal for only 4 euro.   So great idea but it really has to catch on.

budgetfood,3065rt,VerlorFor,-5,Wed Mar 25 00:46:21 2015 UTC,"Hi everyone! I'm making a totally free app called Eats -- here's the website. What it does is pretty simple. It's also up on Google Play.  Eats is an app that lets you put up the baked goods or extra food you cooked at dinner up for sale, or buy a cheap meal off of your neighbors. Posting is simple, all you have to do is snap a picture of the food, fill out a quick form and you're done. We'll geolocate your position automatically, so neighbors/customers will only be able to see a list of food that's around them (they won't see where you are specifically).      This is definitely still a prototype, but we just wanted to see if it's something that would be of interest to this community. It would be great if we could get some feedback so we can build stuff you'd really use, so here's a quick spreadsheet here if you'd be willing to fill it out. Thanks! :)"

budgetfood,3065rt,oneonetwooneonetwo,4,Wed Mar 25 04:28:50 2015 UTC,The better solution seems to be getting to know your neighbours socially and then having them over for dinner.
budgetfood,3065rt,VerlorFor,2,Wed Mar 25 14:18:17 2015 UTC,My experiences with a similar dutch website were really positive. The cooks posting their meals are usually people with a passion for cooking. I have got meals from four different people and never once I had any reservations about eating the meals.   So how this works: You're visiting the cooks. You meet them in their homes and socialize for a bit. So you can get to know who made your food and check the area where it's made. At the site there are reviews of former customers. How is this any different then ordering something from a random food place?

Don't forget base ""parts"" like broth,  seasoned ground meat, chicken breasts,  etc to help make some entrees/sides/sacks later.   Cookies.   I make a huge batch of cookie dough (usually chocolate chip) roll it up in wax paper so it's a cylinder,  freeze it for a little while,  cut it into cookies,  and then freeze those in bags with the cooking temp/directions written on the bag.   You can bake 1 or 2 for a quick personal sweet snack,  or a bunch for a larger group.   They keep a long time. You get some extra portion control help (I do anyway) and while cookies are not technically healthy,  i like to believe it's good for the self to indulge,  with restraint,  on occasion.

budgetfood,302fdb,pcreese,1 point,Tue Mar 24 10:51:34 2015 UTC,"That is interesting.... we have 2 chest freezers, and we never use them for premade meals.  That's more of the realm of the indoor fridge/freezer.  IMHO, the real value of a chest freezer is abusing your local grocery store deals, and then filling the freezer and using those as the basis for meals.  Examples of what we fill chests with (bear in mind, we own a BBQ team)   $1.99 a pound baby back or st. louis ribs $.99 a pound pork butts $1.99 a pound pork loin $1.99 a pound bacon   We'll stock crazy amounts of the above, and eat off it over the course of the year.  Anything amazing that crosses our path is also a target (last year was $1.50 for 6 frozen white castles, and a bunch of $4.50/pound beef tenderloins).  Prepackaged meals are great, but if you're making enough to warrant the usage of a chest freezer, it sounds like they will have to preserve VERY VERY well."

Fortunately we have a microwave in my institute so I can bring stuff to reheat. Last week I made a giant batch of chicken fried rice- there are a million recipes online, but the gist of it is jasmine rice (cheap if bought in bulk), chicken (use breasts or thighs, whatever), a few scrambled eggs, green onions, onions, whatever veg you want to add (i like red and orange bell peppers instead of the traditional peas and carrots), sesame oil and soy sauce. That should cost you no more than $10, and it can last you a full week. Whip up a big batch, pour it into some containers for lunch and you're good to go! Word to the wise, I would invest in some glass containers instead of plastic if you're going to be reheating that much food- it's much better for you."
budgetfood,2zyfdo,unicornfairyprincess,3,Tue Mar 24 09:57:56 2015 UTC,"Make sure to eat breakfast before you leave the house.  Take a lunch with you. From what it looks like you keeped stocked all the time you could take some kind of sandwich (tuna salad, egg salad, peanut butter) If you got a thermos you could also take soups.  Take a few snacks with you (homemade granola bars, fresh fruit, ect.) And find some good crockpot recipes you can start them before you leave everyday and they'll be ready when you get home."
budgetfood,2zyfdo,TaylorMerea,2,Fri Mar 27 15:46:53 2015 UTC,Have you ever checked out crockpot freezer meals?  Basically you make these bags of items that you put in the freezer. In the morning you take the items out of the bag and put them in the crockpot on low. When you get home supper is ready and since there are two of you leftovers for lunch the next day.   I would also suggest taking the time to do some food prep on the weekend. Cut up cheese. Make muffins.  Do grocies and make a food plan for the week.   Good luck

I dont like sandwiches, but they are often the obvious choice-- PB&J is easy and can make a good snack if not a good meal. Tuna sandwiches are easy. Lunch meat is kind of expensive, but you can find good deals. You can pack a reusable container of cereal (or oatmeal/cream of wheat, if you have a microwave), and bring a small container/bottle of milk to go with it.  I like to make chicken and rice with vegetables. Pinterest and similar sites have hundreds of chicken recipes, so you can have greek chicken one day and mexican the next, then some italian flavored or asian flavors... all with similar ingredients. Frozen vegetables work well here. When you get tired of rice switch to noodles. Spaghetti heats up really well, and is cheap. You can learn to make sauces if you want to mix it up.   Maybe make some quiches with all those eggs and some veggies?  A good first step would be to buy reusable containers of various sizes, decent lunch boxes or small coolers, and ice packs that fit well into them.  Then, find a microwave!"

You can also serve this over vegetables or chickpeas if you are opposed to rice.   Stir fry is another cheap option. Veggies, meat and sauce.  I know you said no pasta...

I've found that going vegetarian is makes our diet much cheaper where I'm from (Netherlands), but it could be different in your area.   What I'd advise you to do is to make meal plans because the only way you're going to get through this is by planning how you spend every cent. Plan it so that you spend, on average $3,30 for each day. By planning you can in buy bulk (because you know you'll use it for a later meal), which will save you a pretty penny.

budgetfood,2zvfih,Canyouhelpmeottawa,2,Sun Mar 22 13:03:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know if any of the super markets around you do this but our local one will mark down meat to a reduced price 1-2 days before the sell by date. I always buy what I can when I see it (goes fast) and freeze it for when we need it. If any of them do maybe ask them if they do the markdowns at a specific time of day (or day of the week) so that you can get the best choices of what's left.  Also, I always find lots of coupons for frozen veggies online or in the Sunday paper."
budgetfood,2zvfih,TaylorMerea,2,Fri Mar 27 16:00:24 2015 UTC,"Eggs are going to be the cheapest keto-friendly protein available.    Frittatas and quiches work well for lunch/dinner, and can be made with whatever leftover meats and veggies you have from other meals.    Egg salad is a good lunch too, and boosts the fat content nicely."
budgetfood,2zvfih,jamori,1 point,Fri Mar 27 17:49:45 2015 UTC,"Canned tuna, celery, onions. I'm not sure about where you are, but I can buy bags of frozen fish fillets for a few dollars. Go to a butcher, ask for their cheapest cuts of meat. Use the bones to make bone broth with your celery and onion scraps. Troll your dollar stores for frozen veggies and the occasional meaty items; my dollar store has a really good selection of frozen food for just a little cheaper than from a regular grocery store.   Good luck!"
budgetfood,2zvfih,cruisecontrolx,1 point,Tue Mar 24 14:03:09 2015 UTC,"I just want to comment on the farmers market bit. Depending on where you live there is a good chance you have specialty produce markets of some kind. A common guise are ""asian"" stores. While I love farmers markets, a lot of them tend to be street fair sort of things and don't always have the best prices on produce. Also, if you have a grocery outlet near buy you can always stock up on frozen veggies on the cheap. Unfortunately with your budget you are probably going to have to cut a great deal of meat out of the equation. But, do check into pork butt/shoulder roasts on sale, and chicken leg quarters. May need to do your own butchering, but it saves a lot."
budgetfood,2zvfih,inkoDe,0,Sat Mar 28 01:21:49 2015 UTC,"Rice. Beans. Buy them both in bulk, cheap (like 5-10kg at a time). Eggs are cheap also."

budgetfood,2zm4gh,hungryceliac,82,Thu Mar 19 18:56:03 2015 UTC,"Stop drinking soda and gatorade and save $80/month, bake your own GF stuff from mixes freeze half and cut your cost here by half."
budgetfood,2zm4gh,bannana,8,Thu Mar 19 19:48:41 2015 UTC,Or bake from scratch. There's a lot of GF alternatives to wheat flour. I for example use corn flour and almond flour.
budgetfood,2zm4gh,Tuss,2,Fri Mar 20 13:24:20 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. As a chef, I can honestly say that locating a bulk store will decrease your food costs exponentially.  Sure, your first few 'bakes' will be subject to the errs of trial and error, but you'll quickly get the hang of things.  You can find just about any recipe on google, but be sure to read the comments for further tips and ratio tweaks. I've had to wing many a recipe in my day, and I can honestly say that ever single person out there can bake, provided they have access to the internet and can read instructions.   Don't play around with baking too much (in regards to amounts and ratios) unless you really know what you're doing. Eventually, you'll be able to improvise and concoct your own creations on a whim. It's truly a liberating and exciting experience."
budgetfood,2zm4gh,PseudononymousChef,4,Fri Mar 20 16:07:59 2015 UTC,"Though I know a person who fail at baking. You think it's really easy to melt butter, add milk/water to 37degrees and then pour that over the yeast. But that person, omg. He boiled the water to ""get rid of bacteria"" and then poured it over the yeast while scolding hot. He then put it in the freezer for 5 minutes because it was ""too hot"".  Some times, stupid takes over and it won't go away,"
budgetfood,2zm4gh,Tuss,2,Fri Mar 20 16:41:35 2015 UTC,I cannot agree more.
budgetfood,2zm4gh,PseudononymousChef,3,Fri Mar 20 18:49:35 2015 UTC,"If you're the sort of person who cannot stop tampering with recipes, baking might be out of reach.  My mother-in-law makes great food on the stove, but destroys anything she bakes because ""it doesn't really need that much flour or sugar or butter"" or whatever she's decided is bad for her this week."

budgetfood,2zm4gh,PseudononymousChef,161,Sat Mar 28 10:11:24 2015 UTC,You're eating a ton of processed food. Of course it's expensive.   Rice and potatoes are both gluten free & can be easily varied. There's ZERO reason to purchase specialty gluten free foods when you can make them yourself.
budgetfood,2zm4gh,sirenita12,44,Thu Mar 19 19:41:30 2015 UTC,"Processed foods + sugary drinks. I still buy some processed things, but dropping almost all sugary drinks and processed food cut my bill well in half.  Plus, I've learned to cook quite a few new things and been eating far more fruits and veggies. Definitely a win-win-win."
budgetfood,2zm4gh,palmermarc,4,Thu Mar 19 20:17:27 2015 UTC,"We eat a lot of rice and potatoes. It wasn't in the grocery list because I buy it in bulk online. :)  I've been trying to make more stuff myself at home, but it's incredibly difficult to make some of his favorite baked goods (muffins, especially) gluten free. So far I've only really gotten french bread and pie crusts down."
budgetfood,2zm4gh,bannana,21,Thu Mar 19 20:31:43 2015 UTC,"but it's incredibly difficult to make some of his favorite baked goods (muffins, especially) gluten free   Why is this difficult?? GF muffin mix is readily available, usually just add some liquids and bake. Freeze what you won't eat in a few days. You are being lazy IMO.  Or you could just stop eating muffins.    Muffin mix, cake mix, bread mix are all available. Red's GF Bread Mix will make two loaves larger than any store bought GF bread for the same cost as one store bought loaf.    And really I can't say this more strongly STOP DRINKING SODA there is no reason to put those worthless calories in your body and you are spending a fortune on it."
budgetfood,2zm4gh,trigg,31,Thu Mar 19 21:01:31 2015 UTC,I like how the main concern that keeps getting repeated - - Cut out the soft drinks and gatorade - - is the one thing she continues to dodge and not address.
budgetfood,2zm4gh,bannana,4,Fri Mar 20 01:28:55 2015 UTC,"I've tried a couple of the GF muffin mixes, but neither of us liked how they came out. I make a lot of stuff at home - we probably go through 4 loaves of my homemade french bread a week and I make pancakes & biscuits some mornings. I just don't have good recipes for everything he likes yet."
budgetfood,2zm4gh,Le_Mews,21,Thu Mar 19 21:16:13 2015 UTC,"4 loaves of my homemade french bread a week..pancakes & biscuits    Holy crap that's a lot of bread and baked goods over there, how do you stay in shape? If I ate like that I would be very much overweight."
budgetfood,2zm4gh,princess2293,5,Thu Mar 19 21:38:18 2015 UTC,"It's not as much as it sounds. 1 loaf makes 2 sandwiches so I'm sure they're smaller than what you'd normally buy at a bakery. We both run in the morning and then do a short workout, but I don't imagine it would counteract a super calorie rich diet."
budgetfood,2zm4gh,princess2293,13,Thu Mar 19 22:02:26 2015 UTC,Are you making sub sandwiches from the French bread? Try slicing it like regular bread. Huge difference.
budgetfood,2zm4gh,uberneoconcert,1 point,Fri Mar 20 15:00:10 2015 UTC,"I have a SIL that had to go gluten free a couple of years ago.  Whenever we get together, we make sure everything is GF for her.  It is INCREDIBLY easy to make GF baked goods, and GF foods in general.  Just take a regular recipe and instead of putting regular flour in it, put GF flour in it.  After many hits and misses, the family has decided that King Arthur Gluten Free flour and Betty Crocker Gluten Free flour make the food taste the best (AKA - it doesn't have the nasty aftertaste some of the flours can have).  Then, use some zanthem gum (this is just to make it stick together better - the gluten free flour tends to make things a little runny).  Then, wa-la, GF baked goods. Feel free to reply if you have questions on this. :)"
budgetfood,2zm4gh,uberneoconcert,-2,Fri Mar 20 15:49:31 2015 UTC,"I tried just substituting GF flour (I use king arthur, and I've tried many others) for regular flour in recipes and it tastes terrible or comes out with a pretty unappetizing texture - the only exception being for a roux. I respectfully disagree that it is easy to translate baking recipes to GF successfully."
budgetfood,2zm4gh,probablyanalienbaby,4,Fri Mar 20 16:06:49 2015 UTC,"Have you tried using zanthem gum (I think that is how it is spelled, sorry if it is wrong).  Throw the right proportion of that in there and it should fix the texture issue.  We have used this for breads, cakes, cookies, muffins, you name it, and seems to work every time."
budgetfood,2zm4gh,avo_cado,0,Fri Mar 20 16:10:39 2015 UTC,"Yep, after many failed attempts I did finally manage to make a french bread, but the ingredients were entirely different from regular french bread. I think the only thing I used from my original recipe was baking powder, yeast, and sugar. I also ended up using a blend of 2-3 flours, and tapioca starch to fix the texture. It's not perfect, but it's the most edible bread we've had so far."
budgetfood,2zm4gh,SayceGards,5,Fri Mar 20 16:21:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly it sounds like your perception is the problem. You should try to appreciate your homemade foods for what they are as you learn to cook: a substitute that you refine based on learning cooking skills and your own tastes. We went through an extreme budget cut and I'm shocked now that even when we go to a five star restaurant (like for Valentine's Day) it just doesn't come close to the value, and the quality is often worse than what we make at home. For example, I can taste now when veggies are cooked in veggie or canola oil rather than butter or olive oil; I know if they used pre-chopped garlic vice freshly; I know if they served me soup from a can..."
budgetfood,2zm4gh,Ishaaa,3,Fri Mar 20 22:25:10 2015 UTC,"It's just upsetting because before I poured so much time and effort into perfecting the meals I made, which mostly involved pasta or bread, and now it all feels like it was for nothing. I made every single meal from scratch - fresh bread, sometimes even homemade pasta, soups, etc and I can't apply what I learned before to making those same things GF...everything made gluten free is far too different to just adjust the recipes that I have (except for soup). I cannot explain how frustrating it is to start over. I know I should come up with new menus instead of trying to mimic the food we had before, but that's what we crave the most day to day is the food we're familiar with. I'm sure it's easier if you grow up on this stuff, but suddenly having to switch to GF food after a lifetime of eating the same things is nightmarish. Most of my food now feels like I'm using what I know (sauces, spices, etc) to just cover up how awful the GF adjusted part of the meal is, rather than working with it."
budgetfood,2zm4gh,Stewthulhu,3,Sat Mar 21 01:44:36 2015 UTC,"Aw. Yeah that must be frustrating. I could not cook up until maybe two years ago. Seriously, when I was 22 a normal meal I made at home for myself was sautéed onion, pickles, and just random stuff on a plate. Now that I think I can cook, this morning I meant to make sautéed green peppers and onion with scrambled egg. Well I used a pan that was too small for the veggies so they steamed and were soggy. So basically my breakfast had the mouthfeel of dinner. It gets better, we all have to learn but only by trying over and over."

budgetfood,2zm4gh,Jagc1123,50,Fri Mar 20 16:09:54 2015 UTC,"You're spending $39 on whole foods and $63 on processed crap. You have plenty of room to save money here.  First of all, prepackaged foods like those corn dogs, taquitos, and muffins have very inexpensive ingredients - you're just paying for the luxury of not having to make them yourself, and you have to ask yourself if that's truly worth it.  Secondly, soft drinks and Gatorade... you might as well just set your money on fire. Seriously. There are no nutrients you need in there. It's not food. So take it out of your grocery budget. And if you can't justify spending $22 extra every week on discretionary 'treats', which is where those items go in the budget plan, then don't.  Third - let's talk meat. Meat and dairy are always the most expensive things in a fresh-food-based grocery list, and vegetables pretty much just always cost what they cost, so focusing on getting good prices for meat is the number one most helpful thing you can do for your budget (after cutting out processed crap). So here goes:   One of the best things I learned to do was to wait for really good sales on ""staple"" stuff like chicken breast or ground beef, buy a huge amount, and freeze it. Even with a small freezer, sales happen often enough that you should be able to get away with never paying full price for that stuff. Another important thing is learning how to make the most of inexpensive cuts or formats: Learn to butcher whole chickens. Learn recipes that suit inexpensive cuts of red meat. Etc. Deli meats and pre-sliced cheeses are incredibly overpriced, and it's not hard to cut them out and fill that functional need (sandwich fixings) in other ways: Learn how to make chicken salad from whole chicken. Make your own beef roast and slice it up. Buy a whole ham and slice it. Buy cheese in blocks/wedges and slice them yourself. Etc. Finally, this goes along with my ""never buy full price"" rule. When it comes to non-""staple"" meats/cheeses, don't make your meal plan first then go in and buy whatever you need without considering the price. Instead, go in, find whatever is at a super good price, buy it, then plan around it. I get away with some really nice meals this way - rack of lamb, aged steak, etc. Flexibility and patience are key. You won't get to indulge every craving, and you won't have 100% control of your weekly meal plans, but again, you have to decide for yourself if the luxury of having exactly what you want when you want it is worth the added cost.   Also, as a final point, WTF? Why is your fiance dumping all the responsibility on you? If he's a picky eater with diet limitations and he wants you to cook, he needs to be helping you find things he can/will eat. You're already doing all of the work. It's not fair that you have to try to mind-read and do tons of recipe research on top of all that."

I'm going to start buying whole birds like I mentioned in my post though. :)   Why is your fiance dumping all the responsibility on you?   He works all day, every day, and does a lot more for me than I do for him IMO. I really enjoy cooking/planning meals anyway, I'm just inexperienced with it because I'm young and obviously not used to cooking without gluten.

Id definitely get rid of the Boars head, my guy was really into that brand as well but almost $10/lb is crazy! Walmart has good brands like Sarah Lee for $5-7/lb, much cheaper! or if you're feeling semi-adventurous I always see whole Turkeys on sale, I bought one and roasted it (surprisingly not as hard as I thought it would be) and broke it down for lunches all week, froze some as a soup for dinners another week.

Usually I figure I need x pounds of meat for y meals, go shop the sales for that, STOP, come home, plan meals, and then shop for any fresh ingredients I need for those recipes.  It sounds annoying, but in practice it ends up overlapping slightly. I might be shopping for a small list of things for the tail end of last week's meals during the same trip that I'm looking out for sales for this week's meals. I end up going about every five days. No big deal."

budgetfood,2zm4gh,wachet,27,Fri Mar 20 04:06:21 2015 UTC,"My father has celiacs, and I learned a lot from it. The number one thing to remember is it doesn't have to SAY ""gluten-free"" anywhere on the packaging to actually be gluten free. A lot of companies are making big buck of this new ""gluten free"" movement a lot of people are participating in (even if they don't have an allergy or intolerance).  Buying the stuff like Udi's will empty your wallet.   Go to a Kroger, usually they have a big ""whole foods"" type section where they sell special flour for making gluten free bread. Super easy and pretty good. Also, Schnuks if you have it, but Walmart or target are just as good. Remember, you don't need the label. Look at the ingredients, and if it sounds risky, don't try it unless he's willing to spend an hour plus on the toilet.  GF bisquik will save your life. You can make chicken strips by using the bisquik to make a flour/egg mixture.    Definitely take out the sodas and gatorades.   Use egg noodles (I think they're GF) and frozen vegetables (make sure GF) to make your own makeshift stir fry.   Frozen fish is good, just thaw and pop in the broiler with a side of mashed potatoes, sautéed bell peppers, rice, anything. Basmati rice is excellent, and you can buy the 90 second microwave packets too.   Just remember to stay away from things that are listed as a thickener or corn starch.  Speaking of which, you can make all your old recipes if you switch out your staples to GF. Cornstarch, baking powder, flour (GF bisquik) etc.   Let me know if you have anymore questions, this is all just off the top of my head.   EDIT: also, Aldi. They're super cheap and a ton of their stuff is gluten free."
budgetfood,2zm4gh,capatiller,4,Thu Mar 19 19:12:39 2015 UTC,"it doesn't have to SAY ""gluten-free""   Definitely. I buy plenty of supplies that aren't labeled gluten free, but obviously the muffins are normally going to contain flour. I looked at so many brands of ""regular"" corn dogs and they all contained wheat flour. Very frustrating. I tried making corn dogs myself and it was a fail. I'm focused on making hamburger/hot dog buns at the moment, but corn dogs will be my next gluten free project.    Go to a Kroger, usually they have a big ""whole foods"" type section where they sell special flour for making gluten free bread. Super easy and pretty good.   I don't think we have Kroger in Florida, but I would love to find somewhere that sells rice flour, potato flour, and tapioca starch in bulk. At the moment we have to buy it off amazon and it's not cheap.   Love, love, love GF bisquik! It has been such a life saver. I use it all the time. :)    Use egg noodles   Sadly, all the ones I've seen did contain wheat flour. The only good GF noodles we've found were some of those really thin asian rice noodles. I don't remember what they're called."
budgetfood,2zm4gh,palmermarc,28,Thu Mar 19 20:56:42 2015 UTC,"Some of your foods are really specific, probably bc he likes them. For example,  corn dogs are not usually a staple food in a healthy adult kitchen. It's a nuisance to try to find non-wheat flour corn dogs, it seems, so why don't you just...not buy corndogs? Corn dogs are usually reserved for the county fair, or for children. I feel like they are giving you more trouble than they're worth, plus they're really processed so you might even feel better cutting them out."

We didn't spend nearly as much on food last week because we had leftovers from a big pot of chili, but normally it does run into the $200s, and a few times it has been nearly or right at $300.

budgetfood,2zm4gh,sirenita12,2,Thu Mar 19 20:47:55 2015 UTC,"Here's one of my favorites. If you can cook Chilli you can cook this, and it's a similar spice level.  Jamie Oliver - Hungarian Goulash  I use pork butt instead of shoulder (generally available without skin or bone). It makes a big portion and we make at least a couple of meals out of it. I sometimes use the leftovers to make tortillas (it's basically spicy pulled pork), but with Celiac it depends if you can find edible gluten free tortillas.   BBQ puled pork is also good. A recipe like this is fine. You can buy your own BBQ sauce to start with if you want to ease into it. Once you've got the meat serve with potatoes and vegetables of your choice."

The shoulder is actually the meat around the shoulder joint, the butt (or boston butt) is just above that. This is one of the better pictures I found to explain it.   Basically, they taste and look very similar, just different names. Where I come from, it's common that the Shoulder comes bone in skin on, and the butt comes with no bone or skin. I'd roast the shoulder on the bone, but use the butt for recipes like the above ones as I'd only use half a butt (3lbs ish)."

budgetfood,2zm4gh,thorvard,6,Fri Mar 20 02:56:38 2015 UTC,"Your lettuce seems quite expensive- here it runs about $.99/lb and the heads are about 1 lb a piece. Prepackaged will always be more expensive unless it's on sale.   Your fiancés diet is mostly processed foods. Cut that out. Are you making meals most of the time? If so, make different things for him to eat. Stir fries with rice and veggies are really quick and cheap. Quinoa is rather expensive but can go quite a long way and you can do a ton of different things with it.   Stop buying soda. It will hurt for a while, but its totally worth it. Also, as far as the chips go, get a bag of popcorn and pop that when you want a salty snack. You can flavor it with different spices or even parm cheese.   I ate a lot like your fiancé, and slowly incorporating things didn't go so hot. I did everything pretty much cold turkey or just switched right away and it worked out so much better. When that's all you have in the house, its a lot easier to fix something then go to the store and get more things.   Also, as far as your meat- buy in bulk on sale. And freeze whatever is left over. And especially in stir fries - a little meat goes a long way. My husband is a big guy (6'5"") and I can get away with one chicken breast in a big vat of fried rice. It will definitely stretch.

This is possible, even with a gluten free diet.   Here are some of my recommendations:   Wean yourselves off of the sugary drinks. You will be much healthier and happier with your bill if you stop drinking so much sugar water. The gatorade is only extra calories unless you are truly dehydrated. It is not a healthy drink. IF you must have gatorade, save $$ by buying the powder mixes instead of the bottles. Cut back on the processed/frozen meals. These meals are very unhealthy and tend to have ridiculous sodium levels. I will attach a recipe for homemade corn dogs below. Leave out the flour/sub in a gluten-free flour such as rice or oat flour, and you'll be good to go. Try to find an alternative to sandwiches for lunch. Leftovers are always a great choice. Also, Boar's Head? Is that a must-have deli meat brand? Try getting a cheaper brand. Try to eat less meat. Having vegetarian meals is healthy for both you and your budget. Buy things in bulk. Sounds like you are already doing that with rice, but there are lots of things, like meat, you can do this with.

budgetfood,2zm4gh,kenzyson,4,Thu Mar 19 21:20:33 2015 UTC,"I eat this veggie hash thing from a Vegan cookbook, forks over knives and my wife and I both like it.  1 red pepper and 1 leek chopped and sautéed in saucepan for 8 minutes.    Add 3 garlic cloves and 2 tbsp rosemary minced for 1 minute  Add 1 turnip and 1 sweet potato (not a yam), juice and zest of one orange and cook for 10 minutes or until tender.  Add in kale, salt and pepper, and cook for an additional 5 minutes or until soft.    I think for the most part, if you just use whole foods then you can stick to gluten free pretty easy.    Additionally, I feel like there's sort of a difference between being a picky eater out of need vs preference.  My wife can't handle spices and tomato sauces as she gets nasty heartburn etc.  So we pick meals based on her needs, but then preferences sort of have to shift for the sake of health and budget.  If you're eating processed foods to begin with, you've sort of killed off the budget food side of things.  I would suggest doing a lot of soups and hash sort of recipes.  Look up Chickpea stuff and Veggie Hash, and Brown Rice Bowls, and Soups etc.  If you can get over the meat and cheese purchases I feel like you'll see the budget dwindle pretty fast and just replace those proteins with beans, quinoa and lentils.  Lentils are like a wonder food.  Add that and some quinoa together with cumin and maybe some sweet potato (not yam) etc you can rock some pretty tasty dishes that you can refrigerate and reheat throughout the week.  EDIT: Oh also check out spaghetti squash.  Super easy to cook and pretty bomb ass tasty as well.  Easy to add it with some ground beef, cheese, and sauce etc and get a pretty rad meal."

Plus, they'd taste much better too.   What I do is buy a package of fresh chicken breast and cook two (three if they're kinda small) in the oven with some salt, pepper, garlic, cayenne pepper, and cumin. Then after it's cooled I slice it thin and use it in burrito bowls, wraps, salads, etc. I do this on sunday so I can have my lunches prepared for all week. Even if the boss takes us to lunch it's only once a month and it won't hurt to sit in the fridge or it'll work for dinner. I feel like that would greatly help with your expenses right there.   The avocado seems expensive but I tend to think they're worth it because they are delicious and healthy. Are you eating one per day or just half? The same with the greens and the feta? How often do you go to the store?  edit: I'm gonna go ahead and suggest budget bytes as a resource for good recipes that can be healthy and filling as well.

Add the target debit card discount and there's another 5%. I get like 6-7 medium sized chicken breasts out of it and freeze roughly half to 1/4 of it depending on how much I'm going to use each week. I should really add more chicken to my meals and less fillers for that protein benefit.
budgetfood,2ziml1,Lykii,33,Thu Mar 19 17:56:57 2015 UTC,"Here apples are about $3 for a 3 pound bag (has roughly 10 apples) and bananas are about .60 a pound ($1.50 or so for 5-6 bananas). Bell peppers and avocados are about $1-$1.25 each. Italian dressing maybe $1.50 for a bottle. Boneless, skinless chicken breasts go for about $1.99 a pound with two chicken breasts being roughly 1lb, so $5 worth of chicken would be about 5 breasts. Yogurt is about $2.50 for a 4 pack, but cheaper if you buy in the quart containers instead.

Thou i do most bulk / when things get tight shopping at walmart and fresh thigns form Pubix seeing they have a bigger sltcion n take care of the stuff.   but overall Publix is on avg $0.75 more then wal mart but is better quality. At times you will pay less or more then wal mart at Publix like BOGO i always bulk up on BOGO when it is something i use all the time yes they jack up about $1.25  but overall its cheaper then you pay for say 4 items of same thing at wal mart at full price."

budgetfood,2ziml1,minemycraft,26,Thu May 14 06:32:49 2015 UTC,"Precooked chicken is fantastic for convenience. It's also terrible on the budget and usually terribly on the ingredients.  Feta cheese tastes good, but is also relatively expensive depending on how much you use. Italian dressing can taste good, but again: the nutritional effect can be terrible. The same applies for some yogurt.  You seem to be buying premade products, and there's nothing inherently wrong with that. But it does mean that you're paying a premium and also probably buying stuff loaded with salt/sugar/fat.   And avocado and bell pepper are great, but they're like one of the most expensive things per size in the produce section that I can think of.   Don't buy pre-cooked chicken. Don't buy the most expensive produce. Purchase a bunch of kale, or a bunch of spinach, or cabbage, or whatever. Don't add cheese. For a dressing add something more like balsamic vinegar; don't fall into the prevalent trap that salad needs to be drenched in fatty dressing."

The avocado is also pretty pricey for me. You could just as easily just NOT eat the avocado with your salads.  If you spend $700 per month, that's just over 23 dollars per day. Your breakfast of a banana or apple costs less than a dollar, your lunch of a yogurt costs 2 dollars. Where is the other 20 going? Even if you put filet mignon on your salad every day you'd be hard pressed to spend $20 on it.   Do you eat out at nice restaurants every weekend? Do you throw away most of your fresh foods that you buy because they go bad before you use them?

Where do you live? Are avocados cheap? I'm in Canada so I only buy avocados once in a while even though they're delicious.   I feed my partner and I for around $50-$60 a week max. We're both active and eat well. Here's how I do it:  I buy whatever meat is on sale each week. Sometimes it's a 2 pack of pork tenderloin, sometimes it's roast, sometimes it's a big pack of chicken parts or whole chickens. I usually spend less than $15 on meat and most of the time I'm buying something where half goes into the freezer for later. I also buy canned tuna every week and frozen fish when it's on sale.   I buy a head of spinach and a head of lettuce every week. I buy fresh tomatoes, a green vegetable (usually broccoli or green beans), crunchy vegetables for salad (cucumber or purple cabbage or radish or bell pepper if it's on sale), apples, bananas, oranges when they're good. I buy a big bag of carrots, onions and go through them over a few weeks. I usually also buy a root vegetable, whatever's on sale.   Buy brown rice in big bags. Same with any other grains and pastas. Buy cheap bread or learn to make your own (or use pitas/tortillas whatever is cheaper or just cut down on bread which is what I did but my partner has not.) Buy a tub of yogurt and buy some small tupperware containers to bring it to work. Buy frozen berries when on sale and make smoothies. Eat more eggs.

Learn how to make (or forego entirely) common dressings or whatever.  What are you eating that costs so much? Chicken and beef are expensive, but not $700 a month expensive. For instance, 2 bottles of dressing, 2 pounds of broccoli, squash, asparagus and brussel sprouts cost me $28 last week. That's enough food for a week, easily. Even if I added $20 worth of meat, that still puts me way, way, way under your $700. We have 3 people in our house and we probably spend $300-$400 a month, and that's a pretty inflated estimate.  Stop buying processed food. Don't buy pre-cooked anything. Get 10 recipes you like, buy the spices required (spices last forever) and buy a weeks worth of groceries at a time. Cook 6 chicken breasts on Sunday night and you'll have enough meat for the week. Easily. Hell, make 3, freeze 3, get two steaks and marinade them for half a day, cook them, cut them in half and you have 4 meals.

budgetfood,2ziml1,Randumbthawts,3,Thu Mar 19 04:04:38 2015 UTC,"Go to Localharvest.org and see if there are any local CSAs you can join for produce.  Look into ones that offer half shares, since your not feeding a family of four.  Its much cheaper than grocery store in the long run, and the produce is much fresher and grown in your local area.    Minimize processed foods.  Learn to cook from scratch.  You dont have to do it every day, but once a week.  I tend to make one large meal, and freeze leftovers into single serve portions to reheat as needed.  Make a few different things each week, and your freezer will soon be full of a variety of meals so your not eating the same one thing all week.  Go meatless several days a week.  Tons of websites for vegan recipes out there that are extremely budget friendly.  Look for high nutrient low calorie meals.  Just because its vegan doesnt mean its healthy.  Donuts and cakes can be vegan.   You said your doctor told you to eat healthier.  The menu example you gave has some issues in my mind.   Cheese, yogurt, dressing are all high calorie, low nutrient items.  You starve yourself most of the day only which will lead to temptation, not to mention lower metabolism.  Your menu example also didnt include any grains or legumes.  Whole grains like brown rice, barley and oats are low cost, healthy additions to your meals.    Grab a small crock pot from the store to make tons of low cost meals that are ready for you when you get home. Sloppy Joes on whole grain buns  for example :  http://www.jamieoliver.com/news-and-features/features/vegan-sloppy-joe/#q1KuObrym3v2O4Bg.97  Vegan Slow Cooking for Two book has one of my favorite Skyline style chili recipe.  http://www.amazon.com/Vegan-Slow-Cooking-Two-Just/dp/1592335632  Fatfreevegan.com and blog.fatfreevegan.com are my favorite go to vegan recipe idea spot."
budgetfood,2ziml1,missuninvited,1 point,Thu Mar 19 16:44:08 2015 UTC,"Along the same lines of making one large meal, I like to cook one large batch of meat at the start of the week - say, a whole chicken or a big package of lean ground beef - and then portion it out across other recipes throughout the week.   Roast a chicken on monday night and have some for dinnner, and then the rest of the week you can use the remaining meat to make soup, pasta with chicken, a hearty salad, and baked potatoes with ""barbecue chicken"" (I just shred the chicken and add a little sauce) or chicken tacos. If you're using whole ingredients and doing things from scratch, you can actually make those decently healthy with plenty of veg.   I agree with going meatless for a few days a week too though! Whole grain pasta or stir fries with plenty of veggies, soups with lentils and other beans, and bean/legume salads are all hearty meatless options. I love beans!"

Go to Costco/Sam's Club and buy meat in bulk whether it's strips or breasts or a whole chicken. Take a little bit out and freeze the rest. Make 3 days worth of meals at a time, put them in separate containers so your meals for the next few days are made. Don't buy vegetables precut and packaged. It's so much cheaper to buy them whole and prep them yourself.   If you'd rather have a higher quality meat, look at buying meat directly from farmers. You seem to not care about price much and I've found that meat straight from farms is a much higher quality than meat from most stores. This depends on the freezer space that you have though, since you usually have to buy quite a bit. Very worth it, imo.   also ask in /r/eatcheapandhealthy. they're a great sub."

budgetfood,2ziml1,antibread,8,Thu Mar 19 20:38:48 2015 UTC,You can buy yogurt in larger tubs and it's significantly cheaper than buying individual cups. You would just have to portion out each serving when you want to eat it.
budgetfood,2ziml1,Jellodyne,5,Thu Mar 19 22:20:43 2015 UTC,if youre trying to lose weight each activia has a shit ton of sugar. i would avoid them except for the occasional treat. 17g of sugar is completely unnecessary

budgetfood,2ziml1,basidia,5,Fri Mar 27 21:38:10 2015 UTC,"All yogurt has probiotics naturally (unless for some reason it was pasteurized after becoming yogurt, which is unusual.) The container will say ""contains live and active cultures."" The only difference with Activia as far as I know is that they have a unique trademarked culture called ""bifidus regularis."" Honestly, I perceive this to just be a marketing gimmick. If you just buy store brand yogurt, you will be getting probiotics!"
budgetfood,2ziml1,HellbornElfchild,3,Fri Mar 27 22:36:54 2015 UTC,"I used to buy individual fruit on the bottom yogurts to take to work, now I buy large plain yogurt container and fruit jelly for flavor. I got some 8 oz semi-disposable containers (which dishwasher up fine). I drop a spoon of jelly in and fill the rest with plain yogurt. The end result is less sugary than premade yogurts, so better IMO. I tend to get the jellys with fruit solids in it for texture. You can do get cherry, raspberry (with seeds), orange marmalade (delicious!), strawberry, blueberry (I drop in a couple of frozen blueberries which thaw by the time I eat them), apricot, or whatever. Basically anything. I get shredded coconut, but I have to add some agave nectar to make it sweeter."

I eat yogurt every day for lunch and it is far from breaking my budget. I would also compare the cost of buying the cups versus the big tub as well as the cost of flavored yogurts versus adding your own fruit and flavorings. Unflavored yogurt + honey + whatever fruit is cheap right now = delicious.

My family of 3 doesn't even spend $500/month and that includes the household products and food in our trips to the store.   Re evaluate your true food intake needs to survive and start from there. If you cook for yourself you will save alot right there. Also cook enough sometimes for leftovers to take to work. Taking your lunch saves a ton of money. If you need snacks, get more fruits and vegetables, make your own low fat cakes and cookies. Work for your food instead of just having it done already for you. Not only will it show you the amount you spend and bring it down, it will help you control the amount you eat too.  You shouldn't have to spend more than $250/month max, including household needs. Good luck"

The salads I've been eating are a change, and the $700/month will hopefully go down.    A big expense is the organic meat and produce I've been buying.  I did just find a local meat place that sells for close to 1/2 price compared to my local grocery store."
budgetfood,2ziml1,NorthernDen,2,Thu Mar 19 17:57:11 2015 UTC,Buy bulk.  Costco has frozen chicken breasts for like $1/lb
budgetfood,2ziml1,SayceGards,2,Thu Mar 19 00:07:01 2015 UTC,"Are you buying precooked chicken? If so, stop doing that and buy whole chicken breasts and cook them in your slow cooker for a few hours on your day off. You can also make soups with the stock if you so choose- add some dried beans and frozen veggies.  Sounds like you like huge salads, but you might want to try varying the ingredients- sometime try just buying heads of good lettuce or whatever other green you like.   You don't need to add dressing every time- the longer you eat fresh greens, the more you will learn to like the flavor. This is especially true when you pick more colorful and flavorful greens. Purple cabbage, radishes, fresh purple onions, carrots, etc. are awesome by themselves. Sometimes I will make a meal out of shredded ""coleslaw mix"" which is cheap at my local grocery. Collard greens or kale can be awesome to munch on without any dressing.   Combine any of the following in your food processor or blender to make an awesome salad dressing- Balsamic or Apple Cider Vinegar, Hot or Dijon mustard, Hot peppers, Freshly ground pepper, your favorite type of onion, garlic, olive oil, cashews soaked in water overnight. Experiment with common flavor combos like cilantro, lime and garlic or tomatoes and basil. Try a little dash of sesame oil with soy sauce and ginger.   Regular yogurt is probably fine if you watch added sugars and will be less expensive than Activia.  You can also try mixing it up with bulk nuts and seeds- again, watch out for added sugars or oils they can sometimes be roasted in, but any nut other than peanuts is good if you are watching your health. If you can, avoid buying pre-portioned stuff and invest in some snack sized lunch containers.   I watch carbs, so I often cook a bunch of hardboiled eggs for emergency snacks that I keep in the fridge- they can be added to salads or eaten plain. Cage free eggs are still pretty cheap here.   I'm a vegetarian, and for awhile after I went veg, all my meals revolved around beans. You can make some really great, veggie packed healthy chilli if you have a slow cooker. Dried beans take a long time to cook but are extremely cheap, and canned beans aren't bad for you if you watch additives and need to save some time. Add black beans, garlic, and a dash of olive oil and cook em over night, then add bell pepper, onions, chillies, tomatoes, paprika, cilantro, cumin, oregano, and just every veggie you can think of. If you are a  recipe person, head over to /r/eatcheapandhealthy. I'm sure they have recipes for stuff like that for you."

I think you have gotten some good ideas but I did want to suggest cooking a whole chicken.   Whole chickens are cheap and once cooked are good in the fridge for several days.     An easy way to cook a whole chicken.  Wash the chicken and dry The outside off with paper towel.  Put the chicken in a baking pan. Cut a lemon in half and squeeze it inside and on the chicken. Put a spring of Rosemary and thyme inside the chicken and add the lemon rinds as well. ( you can also add a fresh garlic clove.) ( if you don't want to invest in the fresh herbs use a tap of each of the dried herbs)  Work 2 tsps of oil into the skin of the chicken.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper and garlic powder.  Cover with foil   Bake at 350 for 30 mins, remove the foil and bake till the chicken is brown when the leg is poked with a fork the juices run clear."

budgetfood,2ziml1,antibread,1 point,Fri Mar 27 20:23:38 2015 UTC,"Some of the items listed are good take aways. I would look to see about buying in bulk as well at a costco or something simular. You could buy your meat there, and freeze most of it. This would bring your monthly meat bill down. As for the other items see how much you are really cooking. I find it much cheaper to cook a larger dinner, and split out some for my lunch the next day.  So you could cook two chicken breasts, and use on on a salad the next day. Hope this helps."

budgetfood,2zhi1o,nyllena,6,Wed Mar 18 17:06:17 2015 UTC,"Once you go beyond the obvious of stay away from sodas, chips, etc., and get down to actual meals, it's all in the planning. One example of a two week menu could be like this:  First off, buy only whole chickens. It's much cheaper than buying pieces for each meal, so long as you have a decent knife. If you buy two or more at a time, once you get them home, cut them into leg quarters (2 per meal), boneless skinless breast  (1-2 per meal, depending on how you use them), wings (package four or more together for one meal), and keep the back/bones left over to make broth for a good soup. For two weeks, I would suggest two whole chickens. With those you can make: 1) Roasted chicken leg quarters with onions and lemon 2) Barbecued leg quarters 3) Fried chicken wings and fried rice (Asian inspired night) 4) Chicken noodle soup 5) Fiesta chicken stew (Tex-Mex) (1 shredded breast) 6) Salad with grilled chicken strips (1 grilled and sliced breast) 7) Chicken and veggie stove-top 'casserole' (1 diced breast) 8) Grilled chicken wraps (1 shredded breast)  Since you can most likely find whole chickens for $2.00 per pound or less, 2 five pound chickens will cost you no more than $20, and you can get eight meals from them. For the above recipes you would also need (listed by recipe number): 1) 1 large onion, sliced, and one lemon, sliced, plus side dishes. (Suggested sides are 1 cup of frozen peas seasoned to taste, small baked potatoes) 2) Barbecue sauce (homemade or bottled) and side dishes, suggested sides are baked sweet potatoes and 1 lb. frozen green beans. 3) 1 cup of rice (uncooked volume), oil/butter, soy sauce (if desired), 1/4 to 1/2 cup frozen corn, 1/4 to 1/2 cup frozen peas. 4) 1 large onion, 1 lb sliced carrots, 8 oz pasta 5) 1 cup of black or pinto beans soaked and cooked, or 1 can, drained and rinsed, 1 cup frozen corn, 1 jar of chunky salsa, and 1 cup of rice, if desired. 6) 1 head of lettuce (reserve a small amount for chicken wraps), 2 carrots, shredded, 1 tomato (Or other salad ingredients of your choice), salad dressing (bottled or homemade) 7) 1 cup of frozen mixed vegetables, 1/2 cup of rice, butter, 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1 cup of shredded cheese (if desired). 8) shredded lettuce and 1 package of tortillas (retain rest of package for another recipe), plus sides (suggested side: refried beans)  I would estimate at most another $25 for these other ingredients especially if you bargain shop. So far you're at $45 and that's 8 dinners done.  Now, buy a large package (about 4 lbs) of ground beef. Buy buying a large package and separating it into 1 lb portions yourself, you can save a bit per pound. Hopefully you can find this for under $4.00 per pound, keeping you down to under $16. Use these 1 lb portions to make: 1)Hamburgers (naturally!) 2)Chili 3)Spaghetti with meat sauce 4)meatloaf  For these four meals you will need: 1) Buns, hamburger 'fixin's', and sides. (Suggested sides are homemade fries, baked beans) 2) Black or pinto beans (1 cup dried beans, cooked, or one can drained and rinsed), 1 can tomato sauce, 1 can diced tomatoes, chili seasoning. (Suggested side: cornbread) 3) 1 lb spaghetti noodles, 1 can diced tomatoes, 1 can tomato sauce, 1 onion, 1 bell pepper, spaghetti seasoning. (Suggested side: garlic bread) 4) This one is tricky. Everyone has their own favorite meatloaf recipe. Personally I like to add an egg, some shredded cheese, crushed buttery crackers, and a little milk. Go with what you like here. Suggested sides: Baked potatoes and frozen green beans  I'd hope you can get the rest for about $15, but I have no idea where you are so let's say about $20. Now we're up to 12 dinners for $80.  Here's where it gets interesting: Breakfast: keep it simple. Make oatmeal or grits (depending on where you're from and what you like) in a crock pot overnight. This is cheap and easy. Add a piece of fruit like an apple or banana. Not very exciting, but it's healthy, and should run you about $10 or less, bringing the total up to $90.  For your lunches, if you need them, Take leftover from the nights you have them (I would say from the soup, fiesta chicken, chili, and spaghetti at the very least.) Boil some eggs for egg salad on the days you don't, and take some egg salad with crackers, salad from left over salad ingredients, a baked potato, or a peanut (almond, sunflower, etc.) butter sandwich, with some fruit or carrots. Stay away from deli meats as they are full of additives and cost way more than fresh meats per ounce. You've got $15 or so to play with here to buy what you need for lunches.   Finally, for those last two nights: use your leftover frozen corn, peas, green beans, mixed veggies, etc, and a can of tomatoes to make homemade vegetable soup. Use the uncooked eggs you have left over from making lunches and any cheese you have for omelets, with any fresh veggies or fruit to go along with it.  I know this isn't the most exciting menu, but I've been where you are, and trying to keep a family fed with good food on a budget can be done, if you're creative about it, and try to take the focus off of eating a lot of meat. I hope this helps. Feel free to PM me if you have a question on anything I posted."

Add a little soy sauce with rice; dinner 2: Use the remaining rice to make ""fried rice"" using a bag of mixed frozen veggies, cubed tofu; dinner 3: if any rice left..make burritos or enchiladas with canned beans, salsa, cheese; day 4: Quiche and salad (you can make a broccoli and cheese quiche with frozen pie crust, frozen broccoli and 1 cup cheese, for salad keep it simple, fresh greens taste great with a little oil and vinegar; dinner 5: Leftover night (we do tho once a week where we put everything out); day 6: Lentil soup, easy! Many recipes, use water and bullion cubes to save $ don't buy stock/broth; day 7: Whole wheat pasta and marinara sauce w or w/o lean ground beef. Healthy, budget-conscious ideas. My main tip is to do meal planning every week and think about how to stretch good foods (ie.brown rice) into different meals of switch small things like whole wheat pasta. Good luck!"

budgetfood,2z8rep,MsSunhappy,1 point,Tue Mar 17 02:59:47 2015 UTC,"Cook rice to desired consistency, then mix with soy sauce, Sriracha, chopped scallions, and toasted sesame seeds. If you can get your hands on some shichimi togarashi or furikake, season your rice bowl with either of those as well. As for the egg, simply fry it in a touch of sesame oil. As for a garnish, I recommended topping the whole shebang with kimchi (store bought or homemade) and a few slices of avocado."

budgetfood,2z8rep,inbound_95,1 point,Tue Mar 17 13:54:44 2015 UTC,"Fried rice omelette! It's delicious and super filling. First, fry yourself up a bit of fried rice (I like to add peppers and onions to mine, you can add whatever you like/have on hand!) with a little sesame oil and soy sauce. Set the rice aside when it's done. Next, beat two eggs with a little bit of milk and make yourself an omelette. Once it's done cooking, spoon the fried rice onto the omelette, fold and serve. I like topping mine with a bit of hot sauce or Sriracha."
budgetfood,2z7yhk,greenleader84,10,Mon Mar 16 11:00:53 2015 UTC,"Hey! This is how I usually make my mussels. Pretty substandard recipe but it works great for me! And it's cheap.   Stuff you need:   White Wine from your local supermarket. Do NOT buy cooking wine. The cheap kind would do fine. My local tescos has wines on sale all the time. For reference, I bought some Sauvignon Blanc that was going on the cheap the last time I made these.  Chopped parsley. You can buy those pre-chopped ones in those shakers.  Chopped Garlic (About 3-4 cloves)  Chopped shallots (About 3-4) A pot large enough for your mussels (assuming you have 1kg). This pot must have a lid.   Procedure:   Soak the mussels in cold water for 10 minutes while you chop the other ingredients.  You might want to pull out all their appendages if you're bothered by them. Some recipes also ask to remove the barnacles, but I don't really do that because I'm really lazy.  Discard all already opened mussels, those with holes. Hopefully they're all still alive prior to cooking. To test whether they're alive, knock them lightly on the table, and they should slowly open their ""mouths"".  Pour 2 cups (this is an approximation - use as much as you see fit. It should only cover the base of the pot) of white wine into the pot.  Add shallots and garlic to the wine Start the fire, and boil lightly until you see the first hint of steam.  Add the mussels immediately once there's steam.  Add the parsley on top.  Continue cooking the mussels, with the lid closed. You're cooking the mussels with the wine's steam. Cook until the mussels have all opened their ""mouths"". As long as the top few mussels have all opened up, the rest can be assumed to have been cooked.  When the mussel flesh has turned white, that's when you know you've cooked for too long. It should be a nice pretty orange.    So yeah, this is a student's budget rendition of preparing mussels. Made this for my girlfriend on our first date and it worked. It's not complicated, and it works as long as the mussels are fresh and your white wine isn't too crappy."
budgetfood,2z7yhk,liverman,9,Mon Mar 16 15:50:17 2015 UTC,I'd also suggest taking the mussels out when they're done and then melting some butter in pot with the wine. Once it's melted pour it over the mussels and dunk some crusty bread in that tasty broth.

budgetfood,2yrcto,KennyisFez,10,Thu Mar 12 03:59:35 2015 UTC,"Enjoyable! Overall, a really good video, but I do have some suggestions, from a technical standpoint:  Audio. Nothing ruins a video quicker than bad audio. Your audio is passable, but ideally you'd want an external mic. However, most smartphones have great mics on them, and a good audio app (even the stock one) can export the audio for use in your video editor (mp3, wav). The best part about using your phone is that it's small and concealable. For instance, you could place it on the shelf above your stove and it wouldn't be out of place. Or, just outside of frame.  Lighting. It's much easier to darken a bright video than it is to brighten a dark video. Ideally, you'd want a Three Point Lighting setup, but that's not always possible. I recommend getting a couple of clamp-on shop lights to use. Get a 100w bulb (key) and a 75w (fill) bulb, cover the lights with parchment paper, and you should be good. The camera should handle the extra light well, but if you're doing it manually, you'll want to adjust the shutter speed and aperture.   Framing and Composition. Rule of Thirds. Most people are aware of this, but they don't know they're aware. Divide your frame into thirds. Keep subjects on the left or right third, and put the focus on the intersections. Headroom. The actual cooking shots are good, but the intro/exit shots aren't framed as well. This is all stuff you'll learn, and over time you'll get better and composing your shot. You didn't do bad, you probably just didn't know how to set it up. Not an issue!  White balance. Grab a sheet of computer paper. Set up your lighting, and then set the white balance manually. I think the lighting in your video contributed to the yellow hue - but more lights and properly white balance will give your video a much better look/feel. I keep a 3x5 notecard in my camera bag so I can adjust WB.  Other than the technical points, I enjoyed the video! Keep going! Good stuff! I also subscribed, so keep it coming!  EDIT: Don't mix bulbs!!! If your overhead light in the kitchen is fluorescent, then use CFL bulbs in your shop lights. If it's incandescent, then use incandescent bulbs. And to add to the confusion, fluorescent bulbs also come in different hues, so you'll need to match them."

budgetfood,2ygza9,oznobz,9,Tue Mar 10 00:09:39 2015 UTC,"My mom passed away when I was young and while the Relief Society brought us meals for a while, they eventually stopped.  My brother, my dad, and myself had meals consisting of exactly what you'd expect 3 males who have never had to cook for a family would have.  I was just a kid when I started cooking for a family, you've got a kid, so it's kinda the same.  I think I'd trust you more than I'd trust young me, but decisions had to be made and you weren't around then (or at least if you were, you were probably just as young as me.).  I remember my grandma coming down from Utah and she looked at me and she was like ""Zachary (yeah, even when she said my name, she'd spell it wrong, but I'm only a little bitter about it), you need to make sure these meals are somewhat balanced!  You need more colors!""  With that, lets start our first section - What makes a meal!  Brown and white are good for quick easy meals, tacos, meat and potatoes, burgers, etc.  But it's not very healthy for you.  I was 9 or 10 years old and I was put in charge of making sure that my family was eating properly.  Often what happens is people will make the mistake of thinking that an entree is a meal.  It can be, but often it isn't.  A meal has 3 things in it.  A meal has a protein.  There's a protein out there for everyone.  My dad loved beef, so when I was cooking for him, the meals usually resolved around beef.  My fiance hates beef.  So our proteins tend to be leaner things like Turkey, Chicken, and Beans.    Next a meal has 2 things with color, one of which must be green.  Green things suck.  I hate them.  When I go out to eat, I never opt for the salad.  You know why?  Because I'm not a cow.  Do you see horns?  Do I have spots?  No.  Why don't I just start getting a salt lick while I'm at it.  I was probably the pickiest eater, which is probably why I had to make the meals.  Anyways the easiest thing to do to keep a constant flow of greens is a great big bag of spinach.  Its super versatile, has a light taste to it, can be thrown in everything, and even I will eat it.  Next choose another color to go with it, maybe you want to make a spinach, apple, walnut salad.  Maybe you want to have some carrots with dinner.  I don't know you, but you seem like a smart person who can see if something has color.  Finally, a meal has a filler.  This is your carbs.  Yeah, its probably unhealthy to think of them as the filler.  Do not eat white carbs.  The whiter the bread, the sooner you're dead.  Whole wheat pastas, brown rice, whole wheat breads.  Yeah, whole wheat doesn't mean its nutritious, it just means its not as bad for you.  In the case of your diabetic father, you probably need to limit this section drastically.  So now we know what we need for a meal, but what about a weeks worth of meals?  How do I come up with 7 ideas a week?!  That is crazy!  That is why we move to section the second, Meal planning!  I hate this part of my life.  I can't think of anything to eat.  My fiance is just as bad.  All of our fights are about food and they happen when we are hungry.  Its kinda pathetic.  I mean, I seem like a well-rounded sane person, but trust me I am only 2 of those things, and by well-rounded I mean my belly (though I've dropped 20 pounds in preparation for the wedding #tootmyownhorn).  Your toddler now has a job.  His job is to come up with 7 meals he will eat.  We have already established what a meal is.  So now we just need to get a toddler to understand it.  The color method works best.  ""We need to go find these colors for dinner!""  Take him to the vegetable aisle and let him pick things out.  Yeah, you might end up with a cucumber, a red bell pepper, and some sausage.  It's up to you to make this work.  For this example, you'd get some rice a roni, cook it up, and in the sausage.  Gut out the insides of the pepper and then stuff it.  Put it in the oven and top with cheese.  Serve with a side of cucumbers (lightly salted).  My experience (albeit limited) with toddlers that if they pick it out and they have an active experience with the food, they're more likely to try it.  This also takes the burden of planning meals away from you and gives you a chance to be creative.  You seem like the creative type.  Lastly, as somebody who bakes, casseroles are your friend.  Also, budgetbytes is an incredible website, but if your kid won't eat it, then it won't work for you.  I remember myself growing up, I'd never eat the food my mom would make.  When I started making the food, even though it was the same thing she would have cooked, I'd eat the hell out of it."

budgetfood,2ybfv2,Hazozat,2,Sun Mar 8 10:33:44 2015 UTC,"Pork and cranberry go well together. Throw a can of cranberry sauce (jellied or whole berry) on top of some chops you lightly seared (med - high heat for a min to brown them slightly on each side). Turn heat down to medium to med low and stir cranberry sauce till it has covered the chops. Cook for 10 minutes till bubbly. Fancy!  A staple from my childhood was pork chops w/ mushroom gravy and rice.    Easiest way is to sear chops as I stated before, throw a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup on top and half a can of water. 10 minutes and it should be simmering nicely. I would start the rice first and you should have it all done at same time.  This is assuming of course your standard 1/2""-3/4"" chop. Thicker than that, lengthen searing time a bit and overall cooking time. Avoid over - cooking and drying it out. Sadly, that was also a staple of my childhood. Ha"

Mine ends up being around $80 a week because I have to get some pre-prepped foods for the days I work really late and can't use the crockpot.  Outside of that, my meals are pretty cheap to cook because I wait until chicken is on sale and buy a lot to freeze until the next sale. I happen to like chicken a lot, but it's much cheaper than beef around me."

I get a haircut for $14 once every three months.  My grooming costs aren't regular enough to warrant a grooming category, so haircuts go under food.  As do many other similarly periodic but not common expenses.  If I need a haircut, and oil change, and more shampoo/bodywash/etc all in one month, the food budget shrinks to accommodate it. So calling them food works for me."

Defrost them (doesnt take long). Use one as the bottom and for the top, roll out the second one. I was shocked to find this works with even a cheap pie shell.   Baste the top with some egg yolk and bake for 30 min (I think).   Mine turned out beautifully."

(not serious) :D  I usually pick up the $4.99 roasted chicken at costco cause if you don't pick one up you're doing costco wrong. Someone on reddit once said.  Last night I was down to leftovers which was the chicken so.  I took off the breast and chopped them up.  Dropped some olive oil in a pan and steeped some garlic and basil for a little while then medium and threw the chicken in.  Cooked that for a little while and threw in a can of diced tomatoes.  Before that mixed up a simple popover batter and poured it into a popover tray and threw that in the over and shortly after had popovers.  Combined on a dinner plate was pretty good and cost me I think about a buck 20 for the tomato can, hardly anything for the popovers from scratch and half the cost of the whole roasted chicken.  for a pretty big dinner."

Yes, it does cost money but I ended up saving much more than I spent paying them. You get a bunch of plans to choose from, and you can switch as much as you want for free, you can pick which store you like to shop at. It gives you a bunch of easy to follow recipes and one big shopping list to take to the store and buy.  I paid for the whole year up front, so I didn't have to worry about paying every month. And after the year I felt comfortable enough to do it on my own. And every week they send you a pdf email of your recipes and grocery list. So I can still go back and use those if I want for free now.  Just my 2 cents."

budgetfood,2xi9yp,GotStomped,4,Sun Mar 1 16:14:35 2015 UTC,"Depends what region you live in because agriculture /= vegetable production in many areas of California e.g. the Central Valley. The Salinas valley produces a good deal of the vegetables consumed both in California and the U.S. as a whole. Furthermore, most of the companies doing business with grocery stores are large enough they will still need to send the produce through the same supply chain meaning there's not a huge difference in the distribution costs."

budgetfood,2xi9yp,CowsGoMooToo,5,Sun Mar 1 13:28:42 2015 UTC,Many supermarkets have dedicated baggers so the cashier can keep scanning away for their entire shift.
budgetfood,2xi9yp,ginzeh,1 point,Sun Mar 1 15:43:14 2015 UTC,Even in places that don't have a bagger it's really not that slow. Scan then in the bag it goes. I like bagging my own stuff in the places that don't bag but it's not really faster. Especially if it's a larger shopping trip and the customer gets behind in the bagging.
budgetfood,2xi9yp,Lolicansayfuckonhere,1 point,Sun Mar 1 19:21:38 2015 UTC,Yea for the majority of shopping markets and really any major store there are people at the checkout counter who bag your items for you.  Most people then take the cart out to their car and promptly leave it either just out of the way or at a return area in the parking lot.  Very few people at stores other than ALDI return the cart to the building sadly.

Buy a bag of Lentils and buy Kale instead of regular lettuce.  Lentils are a cheap dried protein that you dont have to pre-soak. You can substitute it for ground meat in nearly every recipe that calls for it.   Kale is very versatile and cheap. You can eat Kale raw in a salad or chop it up and throw it in a soup or stew. My favorite thing is to use Kale as a lettuce wrap. Its a sturdy leafy plant and has a lot of healthy qualities to go along with it. It also lasts quite awhile in the fridge.  Look up ""stove top desserts"" for cakes/cookies that you can make in a frying pan. It's cheaper than buying pre-made stuff (usually) and are delicious if you have a sweet tooth!  Breakfast! Breakfast is cheap if you stick to one meat and one carb. Pancakes, bacon and eggs make for a great breakfast lunch or dinner! If you have a toaster oven you can make biscuits and gravy. Make a parfait of one fruit and cornflakes and/or honey with vanilla yogurt.   Look up nearby restaurants and see if they have any coupons. You can order your food to go (if the coupon allows) and bring your own drinks. Make it a picnic if weather permits. Bring it home and light a candle to make it special. Or if your SO wont be offended by the coupon enjoy the restaurant scene at a discount!  Know anyone local? Ask if they wouldn't mind hosting you and your SO for dinner and offer to bring a dessert item or something to help with dinner. Offer to help clean up after or help prepare it. Even if you split the ingredient cost it shouldn't be as much as eating at a restaurant.   Hopefully some of this helps!"

budgetfood,2x8u4x,carlodt,34,Fri Feb 27 05:05:12 2015 UTC,"Back when I worked in a cube farm (well, a different cube farm than the one I work in now) I had about a quart of wood glue sitting on my desk.  I'd used it when I built a trebuchet to use in our ongoing battle against the support department.  We had to start using indirect fire after I half blinded a coworker for a couple hours when I shot him in the eye with a stale marshmallow.  Anyway, I got a loaf of JJ bread because, hey 50c.  But for some reason I didn't eat it, just left it on my desk for a couple days.  Eventually I brought in a small sheet of aluminum, since wood glue won't bond with that.  So once the loaf had dried such that I wouldn't have to worry about it rotting, I began sealing it with the wood glue (Titebond II - good stuff).  Once the loaf had been entirely coated in a 1/4"" thick layer of dried glue, I brought in a drill and make a couple of holes.  (My boss did ask me why he was hearing a power drill from my cube - I pointed at the loaf.  He rolled his eyes and walked off, assuming that I wasn't directly hurting anyone.)  I found a crap network cable, cut off the ends, and using more glue turned the loaf into a network device.  Unfortunately it wouldn't boot, so I had to call IT to help be debug why my personal Windows 2008 Loaf Server wouldn't boot and connect to the network.  (Being an engineer I was friends with most of the IT guys.)  ITGuy: ""carlosdt...  sup?""  Me: ""My Windows 2008 Loaf Server doesn't seem to want to boot when it's plugged into the network.  I think there may be a wiring issue in the tap.""  ITGuy: ""Okay, I'll be right up to check it out.""  (He needed a break and new me, but needed to log a real call.)  After sitting around for a while marveling at the craftsmanship of the loaf server, I convinced him that it clearly was a production server.  So we installed it in the server room on a half used rack, with a note detailing that it was critical to the company's network infrastructure.  So that's my story of how a half dollar loaf of JJ bread ended up as a critical piece of network infrastructure."

Udon is also healthier and, in many cases, cheaper than ramen when you break down the costs.   If you want to try something that doesn't use soup, you can use a yakiudon/yakisoba take on it by stir-frying the ramen with beef, sliced carrots, onions, scallions, etc. Here is one basic example (I omit the bonito flakes)."

budgetfood,2wxwfu,gingerattacks,7,Tue Feb 24 03:48:40 2015 UTC,"As a native of Chicago I can confirm, real deep dish pizza is like a pizza cake. Thick chewy crust with a solid 3-4 inches of cheese on top, and then the sauce on top of it all. I would consider this a pan style pizza and not real deep dish. But then again, they are both amazing so why argue over semantics. Who cares what you call it as long as it is delicious."

budgetfood,2wxwfu,gingerattacks,3,Tue Feb 24 15:22:19 2015 UTC,"It's not too bad, I wouldn't say 3-4 inches but an inch isnt that far off. OP's pizza isn't so much Chicago-style deep dish as it is a pan pizza, since the cheese and toppings are on top. If you can, try to find scamorza cheese at an Italian deli. It's a firmer mozzarella perfect for deep-dish. I would line your cast-iron to the brim with the dough, do a 3/4 in layer of cheese, then put your toppings and then sauce on top until it's near full, then bake for at least 45 minutes at around 425.   There's a place here in Chicago called Gino's East and they have a deep dish with a solid layer of sausage. Just a big ol' sausage patty. It's awesome."

If they're already helping, hitting them up for all the funds for food seems like it sends the message volunteering isn't enough.   Look into fundraisers for charities.  Google it for tons of ideas.  If this is part of an organization,  have they set an annual budget?     Talk to grocery stores about your idea.  They may donate gift cards to their store.  They may sell you some foods at a huge discount.  Short dated food and day old bread you may be able to get free,  assuming another charity isn't already picking up from there.   Canvas all the stores.    Also look to see what the chain stores do through their corporate office.  You might be able to get a cash donation  talk to other food banks in your area.  sometimes such as during harvest season a food bank finds itself drowning in one type of food.

It's basically chicken/veggie gravy with dough dumplings.  You an make a TON of these dumplings with flour and milk.  You can scale it up as much as you want.    Her recipe is really simple but the dumplings (basically noodles) require some labor.  You could also probably just use pastas, maybe lasagna broken up. Or even spiral noodles.   http://www.copykat.com/2009/02/03/cracker-barrel-old-country-store-dumplings/    I do things a bit differently because I add chicken, carrots and potatoes.    I boil a whole chicken until it falling off the bone.  I remove it and take the meat off the bones.  I add the bones back to the pan and cook the carrots and then the potatoes till done.  I then use this broth (I taste it to see if it needs bouillon)  to cook the dumplings in.   I then combine chicken, veggies, and dumplings with the gravy.   - serve.    You will need some way of serving this, cups with lids, so consider that in costing.  Also Empanadas.   You can call them meat pies.     Ok it may sound complicated and ethnic food is challenging but trust me these are versatile.  Here are some tips.  I recommend baked Empanadas which are essentially meat pies.  So these can be eaten warm or cold.  They also only need to be wrapped in wax paper, plastic foil etc.   Here is what I recommend.     Wrappers - if you can find these, they are pretty cheap.  You can get like 12 for $2.00, 2-4 will feed one person. OR you can make them.  This is a bit labor intensive but you can do it for next-to-nothing and it is fun!  There are also recipes online to make these.   You should probably cost out the price of making your own but it seems reasonable if you can get a good rate on butter : http://laylita.com/recipes/2008/02/06/how-to-make-empanada-dough/ - This recipe is for baked ones.  Filling!  Ok, get whatever you can find on sale.  You can seriously put anything in these including sweet stuff.  Think of casseroles, carbs, sauces/gravy. Any meat will do, shredded pork, shredded chicken, ground beef, ground turkey, shredded turkey, tuna, beans.   Mix the meat/beans with potatoes , carrots, rice, peas, corn, cheese.  What is important here is to make the filling taste good and pack protein and carbohydrates.  Google casseroles* they are super cheap and easy to make. When cold that casserole mixture can be spooned into the empanada.     *If you need help trying to figure out what to do with odds and ends PM me or ask on here.  People will create a solid recipe that can be used to fill these up.     Follow America’s Test Kitchen Baking suggestions (use whatever oil you can afford) .  I think it is 425 for 25 minutes.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF3CyhL5KhE   These an be served warm or cold and microwaved and handed out."

Just chop up an onion, maybe carrots or celery or any other veggies you want to use, pretty small (maybe quarter inch dice), sauté  over high heat. If you have some bacon or something, I like to do the bacon first and cook the veggies in the bacon fat (you may need to add some additional oil too.) Then add the rice and soy sauce and mix it all around until incorporated and relatively dry.

budgetfood,2wmyz6,blacksockdown,2,Sat Feb 21 21:23:57 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend is Indonesian andd she told me that in Indonesia when you're lazy and still need a decent rice dish, you should know about the magic of adding an egg to the rice. One egg and a pinch of salt will alraedy make the rice edible, but you might wanna add some more flavors. For example    garlics (this will really help the taste along),  onions (perhaps my all time favorite vegetable) more veggies ? you can add whatever you like, it's rice, what can go wrong? And it's for your health.   Now what I really like to do is to add kecap (soy sauce) and/or sambal (hot sauce). I don't know how available this is worldwide, but anything will do, really. Also, make sure you add the egg well after you put the onion/garlic on. It doesn't have to be all solid when you add the rice. Just experiment with it yourself."

budgetfood,2wgygz,micmahsi,2,Mon Feb 23 23:16:41 2015 UTC,"Full credit where credit is due: The Spicery. Got it in one of their monthly boxes.  Budae Jiigae - Army Camp Stew  Ingredients   4 sausages (hotdogs from military rations were originally used, hence the name) 4 slices of smoked ham cut into thin strips 1/2 Chinese leaf cabbage, or sweetheart cabbage 1 bunch spring onions, or scallions 125g mushrooms 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1 tbsp chopped fresh ginger (about a thumb sized piece) 125g dried noodles (think this is about one dried ramen pack, not sure though) 200g beans, edamame or broadbeans recommended, but use what you have to hand 2 eggs Tomato puree Soy sauce Sugar Vinegar   Spice Blends   Kimchi : garlic, ginger, belacan (shrimp powder & starch), ground coriander Budae Jiigae: chilli flakes, ground celery seed, salt, mustard powder, white pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, whole bay leaves, thyme Korean Chilli Flakes (sub in medium-mild chilli flakes if you got some)  White & Black sesame seeds (optional)   Method   Mix 1tbsp sugar, 2tbsp vinegar, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 of the Korean chilli flakes or otherwise, and all of the Kimchi spices, stir into the sliced cabbage and spring onions to make a very pared down and speedy version of kimchi. Real kimchi would be preserved and fermented for a while, but this stuff is nice in itself, like a mild spiced vinegar slaw. Leave to get all tasty for 30 mins. Fry sausages (or boil hotdogs) until cooked through and set aside. Mix remaining chilli flakes, fresh garlic and ginger, 1tbsp oil and 1 tbsp soy sauce together into a paste. Boil 1.2 litres of water with Budae Jiigae spices, 1tbsp of the chilli paste, 2 tbsp soy sauce, 2 tbsp tomato puree,  and 1 tsp sugar. Boil eggs in this broth for 6 minutes. Remove eggs and place in cold water. Add 3/4 of the kimchi,  all of the ham, mushrooms, noodles and beans to the broth and cook for 5 minutes, or until the noodles are cooked. Peel the eggs and cut in 1/2 lengthways. Chop up sausages/hotdogs into bitesize chunks. Divide broth into 4 bowls, add some sausage chunks and half an egg to each bowl, chuck on some of the remaining kimchi and sprinkle on some sesame seeds if you're using them. Serve with the remaining chilli paste on the side.   This recipe probably isn't that authentic, more inspired by the original really. It was developed around US Army camps in South Korea during the war, where the locals would do what they could to stretch out the food they could get from military rations (baked beans instead of edamame, spam instead of smoked ham etc.). When I made it it actually came out really tasty, and with a little tweaking, this recipe could go back to it's roots of being super-budget."

Dairy would add cholesterol too.   And most people already get enough fat in general in their diet that extra isn't necessary.  It's also adding calories without any significant nutrition.   The only thing some people might need more of is calcium but dairy isn't the only source of it.  If you had to add something milky or creamy, healthier options might include nut milks and butters or soy milk.  For example almond milk in place of cow milk: twice the calcium,  no cholesterol or saturated fat, no hormones, etc  There's also a cancer warning that comes with commercially produced dairy products.   In America almost every dairy except organic ones use bovine growth hormone to maximize production.  rBGH raises IGF1 in dairy which causes the American Cancer Society to issue a warning"

Instructions  Start by sautéing onions in 2 tablespoon of olive oil until they start to soften.  Season diced chicken with 1 teaspoon of kosher salt and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper.  Add chicken to pan and cook over medium high heat until chicken has started to brown.  Move chicken to one side of pan, in the other side of the pan add an additional tablespoon of olive oil and sauté uncooked rice for about 2 minutes or just until some grains start to turn golden brown.  Stir in black beans, canned tomatoes, seasoning for rice, and water. Bring to a simmer, cover and reduce heat to low. Cook about 20 minutes or until rice is tender.  Sprinkle with cheese, recover and let set for 2-3 off heat to melt cheese.  Garnish with fresh tomatoes, green onions, sour cream and guacamole.  Cook time is right around 30 minutes.

This may help your craving somewhat.  For example - ramen, healthied up by adding some vegetables and maybe some tofu.  A cup of miso drink (a tablespoon of miso in a cup of hot water is VERY savory).  Carrots and peanut butter, or carrots and hummus.

It is supposedly healthier for you than regular salt, and it was the only acceptable substitute for sugary gatorade that I found for electrolytes. I only had like 3-7 grains at a time. Pretty yummy."

A picture of one of my favourite things, with burnt bread and no recipe??  For those who haven't found it - Ox Tail is a common ingredient in a lot of places around the world, and is usually very cheap!  You can substitute for something like lamb neck, anything cheap with bones and tough meat.  Beef cheeks can be cheap and make a decent substitute but oxtail is almost always the cheaper choice, and it's delicious.  I'll share my recipe off the top of my head since I just do what I feel like when I make it.  You want to share yours?  Oxtail ragu Pappardelle  Equipment   Pressure cooker Ladle Tongs Can opener Large pot for pasta Strainer for pasta Medium sized bowl 1x Dinner plate for prep Dinner Plates to serve Cutlery   Ingredients   1KG oxtail Large packet of dried pappardelle pasta 400g can of diced tomatoes 1 Tablespoon tomato paste 1 Large onion, diced (med) 2 carrots, diced (sml) 3 ribs celery, finely sliced Olive Oil 1/2 cup cheap dry red wine. Salt Pepper I would say Pecorino Romano but this is budget food, so lets go with parmesan.   Method   Put pressure cooker on stove, turn heat to Med-High Put carrots in pressure cooker Drizzle in olive oil, swirl the cooker around to make sure its all coated (use your judgement for how much olive oil) Fry for a couple of minutes Put onion and celery into cooker Fry until things are getting some colour - you want a bit of malliard reaction happening.  As usual leave any fond on the bottom. Pour all this out into your bowl Brown the ox tail in batches, add small amounts of olive oil as necessary.  As each batch is finished pop it on the plate. The cooker should be empty now. Deglaze with the wine Open your can of tomatoes In the time it took you top open the can of tomatoes the wine should be partially reduced Add the tomato paste Add all the veggies Add the meat Add the can of tomatoes Pepper to taste Don't stir Seal the pressure cooker, turn heat to high Bring to high pressure Turn heat down to low Cook for 45 minutes Turn heat off, let cooker release pressure naturally When pressure cooker has released all pressure, open lid Using tongs, remove bones - meat should fall off.  Discard bones Return open cooker to high heat (to reduce) Fill pot with water, bring to boil Add a generous amount of salt Put pasta in pot Cook al dente In the time it took the water to come to boil and pasta to cook, the ragu should have reduced appropriately. Strain pasta Serve pasta on dinner plates ladle ragu on top Cheese to taste   It's far less complicated then above I just wanted to list every step I could think of.  TLDR, pressure cooker + meat + tomato + onion, celery, carrot = yum?"

Yeah the broiler got away from me while I was drinking and talking with my dinner guests hence the blackened bread.   Ingredients: 3 lb oxtail, 5 carrots (chopped), 2 stalks of Celery (halved and chopped), 2 large Leeks (halved and chopped), 2 cans (28oz) whole tomatoes, a few sprigs fresh Thyme, a few sprigs fresh Rosemary, 4 bay leaves, 4 cloves, 2 tbs flour, 4 cups of cold water, 1 bottle of porter beer (I used Lake Louie), 1 lb pappardelle pasta, Olive oil, salt and pepper to taste  Preheat your oven to 425 with a high sided roasting pan inside. You want to start off by prepping your oxtails. Cover them with a splash of olive oil, salt and pepper. When the oven is up to temp, transfer the tails into the hot pan. Allow them to cook in the oven for around 20 minutes. Until they look like this.   While the tails are cooking you can get your veg prepped. Chop carrots, celery and leeks and put them in a bowl. When the tails are browned take them from the oven and set them aside. Turn the oven down to 325.  Add your veg to a oven-safe cooking vessel (I used a Dutch Oven) with a shot of olive oil. While they are cooking away over medium heat add your chopped Thyme, Rosemary and whole bay leaves.  Stir often allowing them to cook for 20 minutes or until you see a nice browning of the bottom of your pan. They are not burning that is solid flavor. Place the browned oxtails into the pot and cover with the beer, tomatoes, cloves, and 4 cups of cold water. Then bring to a boil.  Once it is boiling, put a lid on it and pop it into the oven. You want to let it cook for at least 5 hours. Make sure to stir it about every hour and to add a splash of more water if needed. But remember we are not making a soup so take it easy on the liquids. At the end of the 5 hours shred the meat from the bones. Depending on the oxtails you are using there could be smaller tail bones that are hard to find or bones that have broken. Make sure you are careful to get all the bones out no one wants to bite down on a tail bone"

budgetfood,2vdxxf,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Feb 10 16:24:55 2015 UTC,"Ragù:       In Italian cuisine, a ragù (pronounced [raˈɡuː]) is a meat-based sauce, which is commonly served with pasta. The Italian gastronomic society l'Accademia Italiana Della Cucina has documented 14 ragùs.   The commonalities among the recipes are all meat-based and all are to be used as sauces for pasta. Typical Italian ragùs include ragù alla bolognese (Bolognese sauce), ragù alla napoletana (Neapolitan ragù), and ragù alla Barese (sometimes made with horse meat).  In the northern Italian regions, a ragù is typically a sauce of meat, often minced, chopped or ground, and cooked with sauteed vegetables in a liquid. The meats are varied and may include separately or in mixtures of beef, chicken, pork, duck, goose, lamb, mutton, veal, or game, as well as offal from any of the same. The liquids can be broth, stock, water, wine, milk, cream, or tomato, and often includes combinations of these. If tomatoes are included, they are typically limited in quantity relative to the meat. Characteristically, a ragù is a sauce of braised or stewed meat that may be flavoured with tomato, to distinguish it from a tomato sauce that is flavoured with the addition of meat.

Few inputs to make it a bit different, or atleast how most italians eat it, try and tell me if you like those changes.  -use a fattier pancetta  -try to make the egg more creamy, should look like this:  http://static.buttalapasta.it/625X0/www/buttalapasta/it/img/ricetta-spaghetti-alla-carbonara.jpg  -use less parmesan and add some pepper  Also, one of the most interesting changes to the original recipe is to prepare it with some onions, basically before you cook the pancetta: http://cdn-1.cook.stbm.it/thumbnails/ricette/1257/spaghetti-alla-carbonara-27679-orig.jpg  The onions and pancetta have not to dry much, and the cooked onions wil give a sweet sweet (exactly sweet) countertaste to the pepper and the salty taste of pancetta making it an extreme balance between tastes."

They microwave pretty good too.  From your suggestions the sliders and chicken fried steak style sound best. Or chopping roughly and throwing it in a green salad.

Then you put them through a cheese grater, and I'm talking a big hole one. Then soak them in cold water for 30min-1hr to make them crispy. If not you can just shove em on the waffle iron and depending on how thick you've made em you'll have delicious hash browns."

budgetfood,2u2xg7,TheJadedRose,2,Sun Feb 8 18:09:50 2015 UTC,Do your research and don't buy cheep or convenient.   My hubby and I bought the plates that go into our panini press/griddle because we figured we could save the appliance space and boy was that a bad idea the waffles it makes are flabby and sad and now we are having trouble justifying upgrading.   If you love waffles and will make them all the time I think you want something heavy duty. It needs to get hot and really hold its heat to quickly crisp the outside while still having a fluffy steamed interior. ATK recommends the Chef's Choice WafflePro Express (M840). For around 70 bucks I think it is priced decently if you are really into waffles.  They have two designs depending on whether you like classic or Belgium waffles.   I say spend the money if you can. If you go cheep you are just going to get frustrated with the results and throw it out.
budgetfood,2u2xg7,TheJadedRose,3,Sun Feb 8 19:49:28 2015 UTC,"Well I was thinking maybe $20 max, at least for now.

Also if a tool they recommend is really pricy (over 100 bucks) they usually offer a ""best buy"" option and will explain the differences between the pricy option and the best buy so you can make an informed decision.

The only time waffles came out flaccid was when I mixed the batter wrong. Other than that, they always come out with a delicious crispy outside and steaming, fluffy inside. It also has a setting for how hot you want it to get. We always prefer to buy quality and this one, even at $20, is just awesome.  I'm sure there's many out there that are vastly better and for 3 times the price, but considering this is r/budgetfood I feel this waffle maker fits the sub.   EDIT: I've learned that if you're going to use instant pancake mix for waffles, add about 1/4 cup of brown sugar (for every 1 cup of dry mix you prepare). This helps caramelize the outside to give it a crispy texture and provides a bit more flavor to it."

budgetfood,2u4xwq,Raildriver,1 point,Fri Jan 30 04:47:39 2015 UTC,"Think I did this one time. They are tasty, maybe even tastier for some. You get a bigger proportions of the toppings compared to traditional pizza that will have more bread depending on how thick it is. Pretty much all pizzas in any form is tasty. It all depends on if you picked good toppings. When you do it like this, it becomes really savory, but not as filling. If you want a more filling pizza, Trader Joe's sells pizza dough for under $2. Think like a $1.60, at least where I'm from. Want to save money? Try no sauce. Sauce takes away from the cheese, and without it, you get to appreciate the cheese a lot more.

Takes maybe 15 minutes to make mix dough & make dough balls. Then hours for it to slow rise to develop proper texture. Then 30 minutes at least at room temp before working the dough.

budgetfood,2tt808,ironwolf233,4,Tue Jan 27 05:30:47 2015 UTC,"PENNYWISE POULTRY: mother-clucker… CHICKEN *When purchasing chicken whole, remember these points: broiler-fryers (one to three pounds) are the youngest, most tender chickens, but they yield the least meat. Roasting chickens, at between four and six pounds are older and less tender, but meatier. Stewing chickens, the oldest and least tender, are the meatiest and most economical. * Keep in mind, also that poultry is graded only on the basis of “U.S. Grade A” or “U.S. Grade B.” there’s no such thing as “prime” chicken. *watch for specials on chicken, then buy some of today’s dinner, some for the freezer. And remember, it takes a little extra work to fry a big batch of parts, put a second bird in to roast, or stew an extra one for another day.    TURKEY: PILGRIM II, BACK WITH A VENGEANCE… *Should you buy a Tom or a Hen? Both are equally tender, and good eating. And there is no difference in the cooking or length of roasting. Most labels simply say TURKEY, but in some areas, large toms weighing 20 pounds and over are often advertised as such and are usually priced a few cents less per pound than smaller birds. *what size should you buy? Giblets and Neck are included in the weight of each wrapped bird, so consider this when figuring the size of the turkey you’ll need. Good rules of the thumb are: allow 1 pound per serving when buying a turkey less than 12 pounds, or ½ to ¾ per pound serving for one over 12 pounds. Remember, too, that since it takes so little additional time and fuel to roast a larger bird, it’s smart shopping to buy a big one that’ll give you good first-day slices plus extra for snacks and a second-day dinner treat. If you count on about 1 ½ pounds per person, you’ll have enough. *leftover turkey parts are excellent for broth or stock.    ECONOMIC SEAFOOD: Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters… and they were yummy.    *When buying fresh fish: the cost of fish varies at certain times of the year, depending on the variety of fish you’re buying and the area you live in. Ask your local market what fish are in season now and what are the best buys. *Fresh fish can be purchased whole, dressed, in steaks, fillets or chunks. When you buy it either whole or dressed, look for the following characteristics: firm flesh; fresh and mild odor; bright, clear, full eyes (not cloudy, pink, or sunken); red gills, free of slime; shiny skin with the color unfaded. *Frozen fish may be bought by the pound whole, dressed, in steaks, fillets, chunks, portions, and sticks, when buying look for the following: the flesh should be solidly frozen when you buy it and not discolored or have any freezer burn. It should have little or no odor. (keep frozen until ready to use). *Canned fish comes in a wide variety of styles and offers an economical alternative to its fresh or frozen alternative. Tuna, Salmon, Mackerel, and Sardines are the most abundant (and therefore cheapest) kinds of canned fish. It is prudent to only use the (pricier) solid or fancy canned versions of tuna when appearance is vital, otherwise go with chunks, flaked, or grated (the last two being the cheapest) *Salmon is available in the following grades in descending order according to price: red or sockeye; Chinook or king salmon; medium-red; coho or silver salmon; pink salmon; and chum or keta salmon. The higher priced varieties are deeper red in color and have a higher oil content. *remember to buy frozen rather than fresh fish, unless you live in a fishing area where prices of fresh fish are extremely good. And if you’re willing to fillet a fish all by your lonesome, you’ll usually save about 50%. *remember, all white meat fillets can be interchanged in recipes if breaded, rolled, stuffed, or topped with sauce. So choose the least inexpensive."

For example: a dozen eggs in a carton marked EXTRA-LARGE must weigh, according to government standards, 27 ounces; those marked LARGE, 24 ounces; MEDIUM, 21 ounces; and SMALL, 18 ounces. *how to calculate cost per serving: divide 12 into the cost per dozen. For high-quality protein, eggs are one of the best bargains around. *Egg grades: Most supermarkets carry both AA and Grade A eggs and sometimes grade B. All have the same nutritional value. The difference is in the appearance. The Grade B egg usually has a thinner white and a flatter yolk. Regardless of the size of the egg, AA and A eggs are perfect for poaching, frying and cooking in the shell and, of course, are the most expensive. Grade B, on the other hand, is cheaper and is a good buy for scrambling, making omelets or for use in any recipe where perfect appearance doesn’t matter. *when checking the price of eggs of the same grade, but different size, keep this formula in mind: if the difference in the price per dozen medium and large eggs is seven cents or more, the medium size is the better buy per pound. If the difference is 6 or less, the larger size egg is the better buy. *Eggy racewar: brown shell versus white shelled eggs. Both have the same nutritional value. The color is determined by the breed of hen. Shame on your for thinking one is better than the other. *Don’t wash the eggs until you’re ready to use them or you’ll remove the thin film on the shell that keeps the innerds fresh. *Eggs tend to be the most plentiful and cheapest during the winter because this is the time when farmers don’t want to raise a bunch of chicks. *on preserving: egg whites, Tupperware + fridge, egg yolks, Tupperware + just enough water to cover them + fridge (around 4 to 5 days each). *the 2 egg omelet is one of the easiest, and most economical ways to use any leftover meats, cheeses and vegetables.    DAIRY: cow-juice… ‘nuff said. *imitation sour cream is cheaper than the real stuff (usually). When used in hot dishes like stroganoff and lasagna, you can’t tell the difference from the real thing (also, dips made from the imitation are just as tasty). *cheese prices vary with choices to suit all needs. Generally, the highest priced ones are the aged natural cheeses, while the lowest in price are the processed varieties. *to find the relative costs of various cheeses, compare the price of equal weights of cheese. As a general rule, you’ll find aged or sharp natural cheeses cost more than mild ones; imported cheeses frequently cost more than domestic ones; and pre-packaged, sliced, cubed, or grated cheeses may cost more than wedges or sticks. Also, the larger packages are often the best deal. *save small or end pieces of cheese for garnishes. If the pieces become hard and dry grate them and refrigerate in a covered container. *If mold appears on a natural cheese, DO NOT PANIC, REMAIN CALM, SCRAPE IT OF. It’s harmless and does not affect the taste of the cheese. *try cottage cheese and chives as a change from sour cream as a topping for baked potatoes. *cheese (except cottage, cream, and Neufchatel cheeses) taste best when served at room temperature. Remove from fridge about 30 to 60 minutes before eating. *two points when cooking with cheese: use low-heat and avoid overcooking. Otherwise the cheese will become stringy or tough, this is true no matter how it is cooked.    FRUITS AND VEGETABLES: Patience is bitter, but its fruit is sweet. *if you select fresh fruits and vegetables that are not pre-packaged, don’t pay extra for perfectly round red apples. Appearance is irrelevant so long as they have the same nutrition. *Save the liquid from cooked or canned vegetables. Store in fridge and use for soups, stews, casseroles, for meat cooking or in lieu of water in gelatin desserts. *use all vegetable scraps for soup stock, don’t toss anything. *Buy seasonal fresh foods when they’re most plentiful in your area; the prices will normally be lower then. Also, buy only what you’ll use in a short time (with the exception of onions and potatoes which will keep). In general, September is the peak of harvest-time for many fruits and vegetables that are locally grown, at other times frozen or canned veggies may be your best buy. *prices of canned or frozen fruits and vegetables are also influenced by seasonal changes just as much as their fresh counterparts. Normally, there will be a substantial, perhaps even dramatic, drop in prices about the time as a new crop is packed. During these weeks, which usually occur in late spring or summer, you might see six different kinds of canned vegetables on sale. *if you have yard-space to spare for growing (consider the amount of light in your area) it never hurts to have your own crop, which you can freeze come winter. *Canned mushrooms cost more than fresh ones. Many people think the reverse is true, but they are liars and heretics who must be purged. The truth is that the canned ones cost about 50% more. *Fruits and veggies are often reduced for quick-sale, and are to be considered if you want to buy them for immediate use. Also, don’t hesitate to buy fruits that freeze well. Even near-overripe bananas can be frozen. The skin will blacken but the inside will be perfect for cakes, breads etc. Or, you can bland the fruit with other ingredients and then freeze it. *when oranges are in season, the cost is usually very reasonable, but it still pays to compare the loose ones to the packaged fruit (usually the packaged ones are cheaper). *when buying loose-packaged frozen vegetables, it pays too look for the larger sizes. Also, when buying berries in plastic crates, aim for the smaller ones, as they tend to have much better flavor. *the difference between grades of canned fruits and vegetables is not a difference in quality, but of appearance. You do not need to buy fancy grades for stews, soups, pies, etc. Lower grades are just as nutritious, the flavor is often just as good and the price is usually lower. What is different may be the color (tomatoes or peas), size and uniformity of pieces (as in peach slices), or tenderness.    SALADS AND SANDWIDGES *For longer lasting, fresher tasting slad greens, don’t wash them until you’re ready to use them. Tomatoes and cucumbers get moldy and rot. Lettuce turns rusty and gets limp. Purchase only as much lettuce as you need for the salad, the stuff has a shelf-life of a flash-grenade blast. *For a change of pace in salads, use escarole, chicory, and spinach instead of iceberg lettuce. As another lettuce and tomatoes alternative, consider making your own coleslaw. Cabbage is reasonably priced and goes a long way. Use have for coleslaw, half for cooked cabbage and several outer leaves for a rolled cabbage dinner. *save on salad dressing by making your own. *Pick out firm, medium-sized heads of lettuce, for the larger ones tend to be overgrown and tend to be slightly bitter. If you spot a reddish discoloration at the stem end, don’t be concerned, for this is nature’s way of telling you the cut was made when the head was picked. *As a general rule, you can count about 4 servings from a medium sized head of iceberg lettuce, or 1 pound of loose greens, or 1 ½ pound head of cabbage. *For cost-cutting on sandwidges, try baking your own breads, slicing cheeses by yourself, and buying luncheon meats unsliced.  CAKES, PASTRY: smoke wheat everyday… *cake mixes make you add the eggs for no real reason. So why have them add the egg, instead of some other ingredient? It’s a psychological trick, it really seems more likely that cracking a fresh egg just makes you feel more like you're actually baking something homemade, instead of feeding your party guests a powder-based dehydrated space food. In an age when everything was becoming instant and automated, people just wanted to feel like they were still needed. *day old baked breads, rolls and cakes are usually marked down but are as fresh as if you’d bought them yesterday and stored them at home.  If you have enough freezer space, buy enough of these marked down baked goods for a week at a time. Also, storing bread in the fridge or freezer extends the freshness, reducing spoilage. *bulk oatmeal is one place for large savings. The round-cartons cost a lot more per pound than the five or nine pound packages. Much like flour, the stuff can be used in a lot of varying recipes, cookies, cereal, meat-loaf, toppings etc."

Tazo was actually one of the weakest chais that I sampled when trying to find a nice, robustly flavoured one.  If the Yogi chai still isn't intense enough, just add whatever spice or flavour you're craving more of (cardamom, cinnamon, coriander, peppercorn, allspice, cloves, anise, ginger, nutmeg, vanilla, almond, saffron, etc.).  I always add an absolutely obscene amount of cardamom.  I also stick to whole spices because they can be fully strained out, unlike anything powdered, although I do break apart large items like cinnamon sticks and cardamom pods for better infusion.  I sweeten with honey and add a pinch of salt to bring out the various flavours.  If I'm using the microwave I'll use 100% milk and bring it to a boil a few times to intensify the fullness, then add a teabag, salt and honey.  On the stove I'll let the spices simmer in a small amount of water for however long I want my house to smell like magical deliciousness, then strain out the spices and add some microwave-boiled milk, some teabags and a pinch of salt and honey to the remaining concentrated liquid spice."

It is called chai masala. It is just the chai spices. I make a trip to the Indian neighbourhood nearby. (I can grab an indian lunch at the same time for $3 so I am happy.)  But it is for stovetop.  Boil 3/4 mug of water and put in whatever base tea you want to use. Earl grey and black tea was fine on my end. Then when it starts boiling, add 1/4 tsp to 1/2 tsp of the chai powder. Extra cinnamon, cloves and cardamon if I am feeling a solid kick. My friend puts in ginger peels, which albeit more authentic, is too overpowering for me. You can also put in dry mint leaves. Then while it is still boiling, I like to put in a bit of honey, small extra hint of vanilla and 1/2 mug of 1% milk. It will all heat through together. Dont let the milk overboil of you will get a skin on top and it becomes a pain to clean off the stove.   All done! Add extra whatever sweetness if you need anymore."

Store in a closed container in the fridge (I personally just put my tea bags in my mason jar, seal, let cool, and then throw the whole thing in the fridge). Now, whenever you want a chai tea latte, you just pull your concentrate out, shake, and fill your glass ~halfway with the tea and then the rest of the way with vanilla soymilk. Whoila!

My brother is independent enough to live on his own (with daily visits) and he loves to cook! Most recipes are too hard for him though, and he feels he is too old for the kids books.

budgetfood,2tfnr9,gingerattacks,13,Fri Jan 23 23:25:49 2015 UTC,"We've compiled these recipes into a big, easy-to-read binder. My three consumers all love to cook, and they take pride in what they do.  When it comes to preheating the oven and sticking something pre-prepared in for 20 minutes they can do it no problem. What we often do whenever we introduce a new recipe though is go through it step by step with them as many times as it takes for them to comfortably prepare it by themselves. They kind of ""test out"" of it.  Of course we are always there when they're cooking as well and keeping an eye on them, but I'm confident they could easily live independently with minor supervision. We've had a lot of success with these, have him give them a go!  In regards to the kids' books, I recommend just type the recipes out and putting them in a professional looking, adult binder. See if that changes his view."

Cream of mushroom soup from a can always tastes the same, and some people like their grandmother's version or mother's version of some foods best simply because that's what they always grew up with. I can see how it is also a nice familiar flavor for those that really like/need stable routine.  I'll never forget my mom's story about split pea soup. When she was dating my dad he told her how much he always loved split pea soup growing up. So she toiled for hours on a tiny stove to make a real, proper split pea soup from scratch with soaking, boiling a ham bone, etc. As gourmet as she possibly could. She served it to him and all he could say was, ""Well it's not the same."" Turns out he grew up with the condensed soup in a can and that was what he liked.   They later had a really good laugh about it, but I can see how useful consistent packaged ingredients are in this case."

We had this guy ""Jon"" who was a little learning impaired, but together enough to be able to live by himself. He came in, did dishes for ~3 hours a day, 5 days a week, took his food home, and that was it. I started digging and talking to him, and he was the sweetest, most straightforward guy I'd ever met (he had no filter, and I have a dry sense of humor. We got along just fine).   He'd give you all the clothes he was wearing if you were cold and would walk home naked because he had more at home. His family actually had to have someone manage his finances because he would give money to anyone that asked (yeah, people are fucking leeches).   He had a cookbook like this from a local organization that would pick him up every other week, take him to a Kroger or WalMart, and help him budget and balance how much of what they needed for the next 2 weeks. You have no idea how much things like this help. He would always be so proud because he could double recipes and bring extra to work for lunch the next day. He got the foundations of cooking down, and started experimenting.  That was 10 years ago, and I still see him around town. I saw him around New Years, and he told he about the turkey he made for Christmas, with mash potatoes and gravy, stuffing, steamed vegetables, a casserole, and a pie. I guess he invited a all the ladies over from his floor in his building and they all ate together.   TLDR: All it takes is a chance, interest, and someone to show you."

I live in the Seattle area and didn't have to pay an initial fee to use the service but there is a minimum dollar amount required to get free delivery. Just curious, what is the $300 fee for?

I actually used the can of chicken and rice first when I made it yesterday morning and then added the long-grain wild rice later in the day. After I posted this, I discovered that adding so much rice caused the rice to absorb ALL of the soup, so now it's just chicken and rice, not chicken and rice soup. It's still good and way better than chicken and rice in a can (and 10x more servings).  So I got to have chicken and rice soup with my SO for lunch yesterday, then we had chicken and rice for dinner and now I'm having it for breakfast. Still delicious."

The ingredients are:   Shredded chicken (boiled or leftovers) Yellow saffron rice Chicken bouillon cubes (They use 2-3, but always cook a big pot)   Basically, you just boil the three together until the rice and chicken is done and then add salt, pepper, whatever spices you like. It's amazing.   Also - I am a vegetarian and remade a vegan version of this for those who may want to go that route - I use ""Better than Bouillon"" vegetarian ""Chicken"" and a type of fake chicken strips called ""Beyond Meat"" and it tastes just like the original."

Tumeric is also very healthy and tastes great.  Serves 4-5 with 3-4 chicken breast pieces. Use Medium Heat for whole process    Thaw the chicken until it’s soft enough to cut (~1-3 hours) Cut chicken into cubes, and place in water to the side Cut onions (½ - ¾ onion : 3-4 chicken breast pieces) Cut garlic (1 bulb : 3-4 chicken breast pieces) Finely chop clean Ginger (1-2 tsp full)  Cut one green chilli of any variety (serano is recommended for a nice kick)  Mix onion, garlic, ginger, and green chilli together and set aside 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil in a pan (make sure pan is DRY) add ½ teaspoon of mustard seeds to oil  add ½ teaspoon of small cumin seeds to oil  Allow oil + seeds to warm for a little (be careful of eyes and skin - oil will splatter) Add the chopped onions, garlic, ginger, and green chili to the oil sautee until the onions are brown  keep stirring - wait until the mixture turns brown  Add 1 - 2 cut tomatoes (cubes) into the mixture, stir for a couple minutes until blended with the onions Add turmeric powder (2 teaspoons) into mixture Add cumin powder (2 teaspoons) into mixture Add Chicken without the water from the container it was in to the mixture Stir  Add 1 more teaspoon of turmeric Add 2 more teaspoon of chili powder Stir the chicken/ mix well Add 2.5 cups of water and let cook until chicken is tender (~15 - 20 mins) Add 2 teaspoons of salt  Add ½ a lime (optional)   If you don't have a local Indian market, I also found a recipe that doesn't call for any seeds.

budgetfood,2t1dbl,welpie,6,Tue Jan 20 10:04:09 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about fire hazards. The chance of a fire from a slow cooker is very low. I would recommend buying a new one just to make sure it works properly, but second hand is fine.   First of all: If I turn it on in the morning, and leave it unattended, will it be alright?    Yes, even the most basic have dials to set the temperature if not the time.  On my cheap one we have a dial with settings low, high, and auto. Low is for the whole day,  high is to heat something up fast, and auto cooks while your gone and cuts out if it gets too hot.   Also, are slow cookers suitable to make smaller amounts with as well? Could I make chili (or soup or stew or anything) for only 2 (or maybe 3) days in it?   Certainly, there are hundreds of cheap recipes free online for slow cookers, if the recipe is for a lot more people or servings just divide the ingredients to suit the amount you want. Or better still, if you don't want the same meal for nights on end maybe try and get your roommates involved. Show them how cheap and delicious it is.  Lastly, your english is excellent."

budgetfood,2t1dbl,k-red,4,Tue Jan 20 17:14:53 2015 UTC,"It's not too huge of a concern, as most things you put in a slow cooker release enough water to keep it okay.  There's nothing stopping you from adding more liquid for even a split recipe, too. :)"
budgetfood,2t1dbl,nokomn,2,Tue Jan 20 17:32:13 2015 UTC,As long as the lid is on you should be fine for at least 8 hours with a few cups of water/stock/other liquid.

budgetfood,2t1dbl,Andolicious,1 point,Wed Jan 28 15:55:03 2015 UTC,"I personally use an ""Aroma Sensor Logic Rice Cooker, which also functions as a slow cooker. I like that it has a lid which snaps shut, and a handle, which makes it great for dates. Some other slow cookers simply use gravity to secure the lid- mine has a vent for steam to escape (safety feature, I assume).  The plug is a standard US three-prong plug with grounding- testing the connection for a building line fault could be helpful. The cord is the same as a cpu power supply- replaceable if it becomes damaged.  The cooker can be set for several hours, after which the unit switches over to a ""Keep Warm"" function when your food is done cooking. It stays on ""keep warm"" for I think about eight hours before automatically shutting off.  For the aforementioned reasons I find this model superior to slow cookers with ""Off/Low/High"".  I particularly like the Sauté then Simmer function- the cooking insert is non-stick- a little olive oil, onion, garlic, and you're off to a good start. When you add liquid, the heat automatically switches to ""simmer"".  Steamer tray is included for steaming veggies when you are cooking rice, which can be cooked using the ""white"" or ""brown"" settings.  10/10 would purchase again.  As far as recipes- pork butt with Dr. Pepper and chipotles (Coca Cola will work) are an easy place to start!  Better, OP?"

As long as there's enough liquid it shouldn't burn.  Also, it depends on your slow cooker.  My little 3 qt tends to run hot, so the last time I put a roast in my SO's 5 qt, the meat wasn't done to my liking after 8 hours (I wanted it easy to shred) and even the veggies weren't soft enough for me!

budgetfood,2sw24q,Randumbthawts,9,Mon Jan 19 02:04:29 2015 UTC,"I love my CSA!  A friend and I split a full share.  Our CSA doesn't have the ""week old"" thing; I believe leftover boxes are either given to the people hosting drop-off sites or given to our local food bank.  However, I do get weekly PYO privileges at the farm.  I try to do the PYO every week: it gets me some exercise, and I try to preserve the PYO stuff for over the winter and through the spring.  Veggies get blanched and frozen (though I do pickle some as well), berries get made into jam or cooked into waffles / pancakes / muffins / whatever and frozen, herbs get dried or frozen, excess greens (mostly from lettuce month) get made into soups and frozen.  It's nice because (a) I feel like I'm getting full use of my share; (b) in winter when veggie prices go up, I still have plenty of ""free"" veggies to use; (c) dinner can be as easy as I like - I can defrost some soup, or throw some veggies on some pasta, or make a stir-fry.  I also love that my CSA continues to expose me to veggies or types of veggies that I didn't know about before (I'd no idea that basil came in flavors like lemon, anise, and chocolate!), and that I eat fresher and healthier foods.  I also like that the produce lasts so much longer than store-bought produce :)  I love my CSA!"

budgetfood,2sw24q,not2reddit,2,Mon Jan 19 15:50:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure where you live or where you researched.  If you're in the states, you might check Local Harvest.  Also check for CSAs that aren't in your immediate vicinity; some CSAs will deliver to drop-off points 30-90 minutes out from the farm, or will bring your box to a farmer's market if they're going there already.  So there may be a CSA where the farm's not necessarily physically local to you, but can still deliver to your area."
budgetfood,2sw24q,meeper88,3,Mon Jan 19 20:03:15 2015 UTC,"My wife and I started this last year. We bought a half share, which is supposed to be 1 grocery bag-size haul every 2 weeks (rather than every week). I want to see the size grocery bags they are referring to, because we get tons! Even with waste (which I'm using this as an opportunity to reduce waste in general), we still come out ahead. We liked it so much that we ended up doing it in winter as well, as our farmer also has access to bulk reseller pricing to supplement what she gets out of her garden.   Sample of what we get:    1 dozen eggs (once a month, so every other box)  1 winter squash white or sweet potatoes (or both)  lettuce or cabbage spinach or kale or swiss chard tomatoes  zucchini (so much zucchini in summer)  At least 1 bell pepper (so many bell peppers...)  1 hotter pepper (jalapeno seems to be the most common, but we get pasilla sometimes) Some kind of fruit, sometimes several types (grapes, peaches, berries, apples, etc.)  carrots and/or parsnips some type of onion (green, smaller fresh onions on the stalk, dried) or garlic  a wildcard veggie (fennel, rutabaga, etc.)"
budgetfood,2sw24q,kuudereingly,5,Mon Jan 19 15:12:37 2015 UTC,"I want to see the size grocery bags they are referring to, because we get tons!    That's one of the things you get with CSA's: you share the farmer's risk.  If it's a bad year, he at least makes a living wage and gets to keep service his loans and keep his farm, while you get veggies cheaper than the rising prices in the supermarket; if it's a good year, you get lots of extra veggies and he makes slightly less profit :)  For your waste: if I get overwhelmed, I pass some on to friends and family.  (Honestly, I don't have a lot of waste; I preserve stuff for winter/spring.)  And for regular food waste (trimmings and such), save them in a ziploc and freeze them, then use them to make soup stock.  I'm a bit jealous of your winter CSA; ours tried it a few years ago, but it didn't really work out for them so they stopped.  OTOH, I do put up a lot of stuff for over the winter, so it's not like I'm suffering :)"
budgetfood,2sw24q,meeper88,2,Mon Jan 19 16:23:36 2015 UTC,"Some of the waste is definitely due to not being used to having fresh veggies all the time, which need to be used in a timely manner. We get our share on Wednesday, and the more delicate stuff is already starting to suffer by Friday/Saturday when I have a chance to really go through it."
budgetfood,2sw24q,kuudereingly,2,Mon Jan 19 16:49:05 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this'll help, but I get my veggies late Wednesday as well and most of the stuff that will suffer by the weekend are leafy things.  My ritual is to get home and separate everything into 4 piles: veggies, berries, greens and herbs.  The veggies get set aside; the berries (if any) go immediately into the fridge.  The greens go into the crisper and the herbs are tossed onto the top shelf of the fridge for later.  Herbs seem to be the most sensitive, so I start with them.  Sometime before I settle in for the evening on Wednesday, I'll pull out the herbs and rinse them off, then place them onto a towel to dry.  As I settle in for the evening, I'll pull up something I've been meaning to watch and sit in front of the tv with the herbs.  Everything gets picked over.  While I watch tv, anything that's going to be dried gets strung into bunches; and anything that's going to be frozen gets de-stemmed and finger-shredded.  I use the commercial breaks to hang the herbs for drying or put them on trays and put them in the freezer.  Anything that gets mixed with oils or other stuff before freezing gets processed and put aside until after the episode, when I'll spend 5-10 minutes in the kitchen doing that kind of stuff.  Greens are usually the next most delicate, so Thursday is greens night: I'll rinse the greens off before dinner, run them through the spinner, and leave them to do a final drip-dry.  They get picked over, de-stemmed and finger-shredded over Thursday night's tv, then stored in baggies in the fridge.  If I have energy, I'll chop a few veggies and toss in some cheese, nuts, fruit or whatever else I have on hand, to pre-make salad.  By Friday, I usually have a decent grasp on what veggies I'll be using that week and what will be leftover, so Friday night is veggie night; it's usually longer than the other nights.  I'll sit in front of the tv, cleaning and chopping whatever veggies aren't going to be used that week, as well as any that I might be using in recipes and that can be chopped ahead of time.  After the show's ended, I go into the kitchen and blanch-and-freeze any veggies destined for the freezer as-is; the rest gets put into baggies and stored in the fridge, ready to be cooked into dishes and either served, stored or frozen.  I like my method, as I can justify ""wasting"" time in front of the tv by processing the veggies that I'd need to process anyway.  The tv engages my brain while the veggies engage my hands.  By the time I'm done watching tv on Wednesday and Thursday, I usually have the energy to pack everything away as needed.  The only problem night is usually Friday, and the thing that usually gets me stuck is trying to blanch stuff before bedtime - I'm usually really tired by the time I'm done.  But having the blanched stuff out of the way that evening makes it easier for me to work with the rest of the food over the weekend, so I generally stick with that schedule.  Anyway, don't know if any of that might help you; I just find taking care of the veggies while I watch tv to be a decent combination: I get to relax and do what I really want to do (watch tv) while also accomplishing what I need to do so as to have some free time on the weekend (clean and process veggies)."
budgetfood,2sw24q,meeper88,1 point,Mon Jan 19 19:02:00 2015 UTC,"The stuff about herbs is great. Of the types we like, I try to freeze those--sometimes I don't get to them in time though. I've never air-dried herbs, but I want to give that a try. I have an Aerogarden but I'm almost afraid to start it up again (I make my own seed pots) because I got positively inundated with basil at the exact wrong time (lots of back to back travel). Maybe I'll try again this year and preempt it and make pesto."
budgetfood,2sw24q,kuudereingly,1 point,Mon Jan 19 19:20:14 2015 UTC,"Most herbs, you just string from their stems and hang upside down to dry.  I have a utility room (washer, drying, water heater, tool chest) where I've strung a couple lines of twine across it.  Every 4 inches or so, I knotted a small bulldog clip (those metal, satchel-shaped paper clips for large amounts of paper; these hold like 30 pages) into the twine.  When I have herbs that I want to try, I gather them in small bundles, knot a bit of string around the stems, then clip the other end into the bulldog clip.  When they're dry, I just pull them down and store in jars.  I'll use the dried herbs in cooking and cream cheese spreads (for some reason, dried herbs tend to work better for me there), and I'll sometimes make up sachets or potpourri.  Catnip gets dried and packaged for presents to the cat people in my life.  I've been meaning to get around to making essential oils -- they keep giving us lavender and some other stuff -- but haven't started that yet.  Maybe this year ... ?  Re: basil.  May I suggest trying flavoured basil?  Our current CSA grows about 12 different types of basil each year, and we've got in the habit of sitting down one evening each summer and doing a basil tasting.  My mom loved anise basil; most everyone else loved the lemon basil (Mrs Burns' lemon basil, especially).  Lime basil is a decent complement to the lemon; sometimes a bit too delicate to hold up on it's own, but adds something to straight lemon basil when mixed in.  Don't really have a good recipe for chocolate basil yet, but I'm still looking.  We plant basil every year, and it's usually at least two lemon and one lime; we go with them because those are our favourites and we figure we can always get regular basil at the farmer's market."

budgetfood,2stg2x,toadsanchez420,45,Sun Jan 18 08:54:08 2015 UTC,"I see these posts and I think to myself ""I could buy a couple of pounds of rice and a couple of pounds of flour from the bulk section for about $5 total, and I could survive two weeks.""  $35 a week should be plenty if you're just feeding one person.  Just avoid prepackaged and overly expensive foods. Set an arbitrary pricing system: if it costs more than $2 per pound of actual edible food, it doesn't go in the cart.  Imho, the main limiting factor for the kinds of food you can make on a very strict budget is your ability to cook.  Of course you need to get really creative and innovative in order to avoid eating the same beans and rice meal every day.  But within a month of smart purchases on that budget you can stock your kitchen with most of the basics you need.  In the mean time, research recipes online that can be made with the few, disparate ingredients you have on hand.  It's an invaluable learning experience.  Don't buy meat at first.  Anyone who grew up broke knows that meat is a luxury.  [Once you have a foundation of food basics in place you can hunt for the good sales on meats, stock up, and freeze them.  Chicken is usually the cheapest.]  First thing is to find a store that sells cheap bulk foods.  I had a WinCo near me. It was cash only but had a huge selection of bulk foods.  (It's better to buy with cash than credit when you're poor anyhow.)  Buy rice, pasta, dried beans (red, black, northern, pinto, lentils, dried peas, etc. etc. - so much variety), dried potatoes, oatmeal, polenta, herbs and spices - bouillon is great for creative cooking - maybe curry if you're into that sort of thing, etc.   Also get plenty of flour and yeast.  You can bake loaves of bread for pennies.  Bread is just flour, yeast, salt and water.  Get tea for drinking something other than water.  Bulk food is not as flavorful (especially the herbs), and often lower in quality but is the cheapest way to survive.  Store the dried bulk stuff properly and it will last a very long time.  When you can spare the money get a big cheap bottle of olive oil - you don't need evoo. The regular stuff has a higher smoke point for cooking anyhow. It's healthy and can replace all other fats needed for cooking.  Pick up a block of cheese on sale.  Bags of potatoes and onions and garlic can be pretty cheep and last quite a few weeks. Aldi has canned foods pretty cheap.  Get a bunch of cans of tomatoes and tomato sauce for sauces and ingredients in other things - it's a good source of vitamin C.  There are so many options depending on your taste preferences. I can't possible type them all out.  I could cook countless tasty meals with these ingredients because I was forced to learn how to use what I had on hand.  If you don't have an important ingredient, find a way to cook without it.  You can make bread without yeast for example - make unleavened bread, or you can create your own starter and make your own yeast.  You really only need flour and water!  Your diet will be mostly carbs and starches at the beginning, but you can get proteins from beans and tubs of generic peanut butter at first.  I grew up with nothing but government cheese for protein for years.  Eventually you've got all the basics stockpiled, and your very small weekly budget can go towards other ingredients to make more interesting recipes."

budgetfood,2stg2x,fxpstclvrst,16,Sun Jan 18 14:09:24 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you've done a lot already, so that's good!  The typical thing I can think of is stretching foods by adding fillers like rice, potatoes, and pasta. Serve soup or stew over rice, turn vegetable stew into minestrone by adding pasta, bulk up your breakfast eggs into a scramble by adding potatoes.   If you don't already, start buying meats 'bone in' and use the bone scraps to make broth for soups, use the tiny bits of meat for tacos, scrambles, fried rice, etc.   You can cook oatmeal in bigger batches for breakfast. Buy the old fashioned kind, cook it plain, refrigerate it, and just add flavors to your bowl for the day.  You can do the same with grits.   If you drink coffee, switch away from creamers and go back to sugar and half n half. A pound of plain roast beans costs the same as a pound of vanilla roast beans.  You can refrigerate unused coffee from the pot for future use too. Just do it fairly soon after it was brewed, don't let it sit on the heater all day."
budgetfood,2stg2x,khatfield79,7,Sun Jan 18 09:53:35 2015 UTC,"First off, I know exactly what you're going through!  Here are some tips of mine that I used when I made 9.50/hour.   Have you learned how to make your own gravy?  It is a great way to stretch out a little meat and give you a little more control over sodium intake.    Try making a bunch of gravy and cooking a few strips of whatever meat you'd like (use the fat from the meat for a more flavorful roux).  I then let the gravy stiffen up a little and add peas/favorite veggies.     Pour gravy mix into casserole dish and top with mashed potatoes (cheesy if you have it) and bake till brownish crust is formed on the potatoes.  It makes a lot and stretches 1-2 thin cuts of meat (or 1 normal cut) into 4-5 meals.  Also invest in a little yeast...making bread saves a lot of moolah!  You'll have to do.more meal.prep.by yourself but that savings are great! Also check ethnic markets for affordable produce and meat."

budgetfood,2stg2x,beta_pup,6,Sun Jan 18 21:37:56 2015 UTC,"Eggs every other day for breakfast. You need protein. Switch it out with oatmeal every other day for fiber. Throw in a banana with the oatmeal when you cook it and it'll be plenty sweet enough; skip as much sugar as you can, that shit'll kill you.   Red beans and rice:   equal parts red beans, canned or fresh tomatoes (whichever's cheaper), and cooked rice. First you cook the tomatoes down to a paste without extra liquid in it (keep an eye on it or this'll burn), then you throw in the rice (you want to cook down the tomatoes first so it's nice and thick or the rice will get goopy), then you throw in the beans. Cook it all up until it's hot, throw in salt, pepper, loads of oregano, and chili powder. You have a meal. If you want to make it fancy and you happen to have some sort of meat lying around, you can add that in - hot dogs, chicken, meatballs, sausage, shrimp, anything will work to dress it up.   Make hard boiled eggs and throw them in your ramen. Eggs are a traditional staple of ramen in Korea and you'll need the protein; over in /r/ramen they have tons of recipes. Chop up some carrots real fine and add them in too; you need the vitamins if you want to stay healthy.    Roast carrots and have them with dinner. Chop up carrots, sprinkle on some oil and shake them around, throw them in the oven (350-400) for about an hour. Same can be done with potatoes, sweet potatoes, beets, etc.   Baked potatoes: wrap potato in foil, put in oven for an hour and a half, or two hours, on 380 or so.   Toppings for baked potatoes: Get an onion, chop off the ends, peel off the nasty outer skin, shop it up and put it in a foil packet with some oil - enough to keep it from sticking, not enough to make it swim. Sprinkle with salt (and garlic and lemon juice if you have it). Throw in when you throw in the potatoes, pull out when you pull out the potato. Sweet roasted onion on top of your potato, yum.   Steamed broccoli with parmesan cheese is also good. The other night I cooked up a bunch of mushrooms with about a teaspoon of mushrooms and we topped butter baked potatoes with them, delicious. Baked potatoes are also good with chili as a topping.   Chili: 1 pack ground meat. Cook on stove until crumbly, add in 1 can red beans, 1 can cooked tomatoes, 1 chopped onion, some salt and pepper, some chili seasonings - either pre packaged or your own recipe, both are good. Cook until done. Serve on its own or with cheese. Use a little over macaroni and cheese, baked potatoes, and rice.  Baked ziti: Cook up a batch of ziti pasta until it's still a bit chewy. Mix it up with a can of sauce, and some meat if you've got it- sausage, cooked ground beef, whatever. Top with cheese and bake in the oven on 350 for about half an hour."

One I made was Ratatouille, but might not be ideal if you hate the veg. I think it cost me £6 ($9) total and I'm still eating it for two meals a day after 5 days! I had it the other day with brown rice, also had it as a pasta sauce and with some burgers I got. It's super simple and super healthy, mostly veggies but I added a bunch of beans in there too for some extra protein.  I also made a big pot of Beef stew. Again, loads of onions, carrots (they'll not taste like carrots after a good stewing!), potatoes, some cheap cuts of beef, stewed for a few hours and the sauce thickened with flour to make it really hearty. You can also use sausages instead of beef if you want to make it cheaper. Think that cost me about £5 and lasted for 6 or 7 meals. Had it with rice/crusty bread mostly, or just on its own.  Chilli is another good one, can be done with almost any cheap meat too."

If you buy your beans dry and cook them yourself first, this would be even cheaper.  Pasta is good but don't think you always have to do it with red sauce. Try some variations with cheaper stuff and it may be surprising.  As far as snacks go, I've found if I drink the actual recommended amount of water I'm supposed to, I don't get hungry enough for snacks. If that doesn't sound like that would work, really plan out your snacking because the things like chips/candy etc add up way too fast without having any nutritional benefit."

To answer your question, there are some great pasta dishes that can be made very cheaply.  You can make things like baked ziti in massive quantities, portion it out and then freeze it.  As for meat, look at making ghetto pulled pork in your crock pot.  Pork shoulder is regularly on sale in Naples, FL for $2.99/lb.  If I were you, I'd buy about 30 pounds of it, make it, weigh out 6oz portions and freeze those.  There's a lot of great food for you.  Just wrap it in a flour tortilla with Sriracha and you have a delicious meal, especially if you don't like veggies.  Also, sell the car and use whatever money you have for a cheaper one you can pay cash for.  You can't afford any debt.  Even better, if you can get a bus pass, that would be the way to go.

Our pie crust can sometimes be made with suet way up north, but most people would not eat anything with suet in it.  Today we feed animals suet, not people. Some people use lard as a more palatable substitute.  The northern part of the lower peninsula of Michigan (the glove shaped part) and all of the upper peninsula are what used to be called ""copper country"". Copper mines were big business, as well as logging, for generations in those areas.  Most copper miners/loggers ate pasties on a regular basis. They would bring them to work and eat them later in the day. Because they waited most of the day to eat the pastie cooks (mothers, wives, daughters) made the pie crust thicker and very dense so the pie would hold up on the trips into the mines and logging country. So now a traditional ""Michigan"" pastie has a thick heavy crust and lots of cheap root vegetables and potatoes.  These miners and loggers were mainly from immigrant families from all over Europe that may have been in America for only 1 or 2 generations. Lotsa of Irish in particular. That would explain the similarities in ingredients."

Two weeks of intensive outdoor exercise simulated the strenuous wartime physical work Britons would likely have to perform.

budgetfood,2rx52p,emeraldmist01,23,Sat Jan 10 01:37:36 2015 UTC,"Slowcooker!  It makes things SO much easier. Beans cook perfectly, you can do oatmeal overnight for the next morning, cheap meat becomes tender and perfect. Also, if space is an issue, you can use the griddle as a place to make pancakes and bacon.   This week we did a chicken / white bean 'chili' made with salsa verde by chucking that into the slowcooker. Ready to eat when we got home, had some toast and salad with it. (Salad is spinach drizzled in olive oil and salt and pepper. Super easy, fairly healthy.) Lunch was leftovers.   Day two, same chili over rice, roasted some broccoli. (Also had salad and bread with brie to stretch it to dinner for four and lunch for two.) leftovers for lunch.   Day three, spoon it out of the slow cooker into a casserole dish with some frozen corn, pour cornbread batter on top (we made from scratch but jiffy mix is tasty too) for tamale pie. We roasted a sweet potato on the side. Lunch was leftovers.   So I guess what I'm saying is make a big pot of something versatile, then just keep adding to it to transform it. Then, when you're sick of it, freeze it. Tonight's dinner is mac and cheese defrosted from last week with some mediterranean style kale (because cheap but nutrients).   Typically our menu for a week involves one slowcooker item that can be transformed / eaten over rice, a rice based dish, a pasta (not meat based, though we add vegetarian refried beans in to up protein, you can't taste them at all), and a bean-based dish. Budgetbytes is my bible, she's got plenty of cheap, 30 minute meals, and I use her stuff as inspiration. Don't forget to also buy in season, and frozen is usually cheaper than canned.   EDIT: We aren't vegetarian but eat that way because it's cheaper and a bit healthier. Most of our protein cones from beans and rice or corn, or eggs. Eggs are great, you can add an egg over easy to almost anything."

budgetfood,2rx52p,MrsEaves,9,Sat Jan 10 15:59:00 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely check out stir fries and Chinese food in general. They're great because nearly any recipe you find can swap tofu or eggplant for your meat, depending on what you feel like - both are cheap and delicious when prepared properly, and super healthy! I like eggplant when I want something soft and delicate, and tofu when I want something crispy and light/airy. Indian food is another great one to try - you can do some awesome curries with onion, potato, chickpeas, eggplant... Whatever veggies you feel like, really. Get a good curry powder and a can of coconut milk - you can freeze that in an ice cube tray and just use 2 tbsp here and there to give your curries a little heft.   Eggplant tip: prepare however your recipe calls for it (halved, chopped, etc), then salt generously and allow to sit for about 20 minutes. This will draw moisture out, and in my experience makes it taste more flavorful and less bitter. Rinse the salt off after 20 minutes, pat dry lightly with a paper towel or two, and use as a base for your favorite stir fry or curry. A single eggplant is like forever food... It's incredible how giant of a pile you get for $2.  Tofu tip: Preheat your oven to 400 degrees, then slice your extra firm tofu block in half side to side so you have two thin sheets of tofu. Wrap in a layer of paper towel, then wrap with a kitchen towel. Place under a cutting board with a nice heavy object (I like my 20 lb mortar and pestle, but books work great) and let it hang out under that until the oven is ready. Once the oven is ready, cube the tofu up, pop it on a cookie sheet with space between each cube, and bake for 20 minutes while you prep the rest of your recipe (start your rice immediately, then work on your stir fry sauce and any veggie prep). You should get nice, crispy tofu cubes that will have a nice crust and stand up to a stir fry with the sauce and veggies you just made. I'm a meat eater, but I legitimately crave this tofu ever since I figured out how to make it crispy without frying, which is an enormous pain.  In terms of recipes, I always taste and adjust as I go. What you're really doing with these types of dishes is making a gravy/sauce that provides all the flavor. Taste and adjust that to your liking, and you'll have a solid dinner. If things seem a little bland, especially Indian - add a bit of salt and taste. I find most Chinese recipes (thanks to soy sauce) are plenty salty as is, but benefit greatly from a bit of sweet (sugar, raisin, fruit) or sour (vinegar) to add tartness. Cayenne is awesome for adjusting heat. You'll want things a little overspiced, since you're making up for rice.   On that note - my favorite rice comes from a 20 lb bag my Korean friend gave to me after he was moved, straight from the local Asian supermarket. I have no idea how much it was, but it is definitely going to be cheaper there if you have that option, and it's way tastier than the normal store stuff. It has flavor and texture! I always look forward to eating it because it's so tasty.  Spices - for Indian cooking, you'll need some odd ones. If you have a food co-op, natural foods store, or anything with a bulk spice section, that's your in to get those spices for cheap if you don't have them.   I like mapo tofu/eggplant, sesame tofu, kung pao eggplant, and the BBC has some pretty solid offerings for curry recipes. They suggest curry paste, I usually do curry powder and cumin, plus whatever other warm spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, etc) strike my fancy, in small amounts to taste. Base recipe here, adding, subtracting, and substituting whatever sounds tasty is highly encouraged. I've used cauliflower and chickpeas before - whatever is on sale or what I feel like.  If you have a slow cooker, give dried chickpeas (and other beans) a try. Soak overnight, plug in in the morning, fresh chickpeas when you get home. Just as easy as canned if you have the slow cooker.  Lastly - if you don't meal plan already, definitely do that. If you can aim to base a couple of meals around produce and do meat 2-3 times a week at most, you should be able to knock your grocery bill down quite a bit. And if you need recipe inspiration, Budget Bytes is great for good, cheap recipes. Foodgawker is awesome for getting motivation to try new things, or just getting fun ideas for how to use ingredients in interesting ways that will shake things up a bit, and may inspire you to make your own substitutions too."

budgetfood,2rx52p,lalapelosa,3,Sat Jan 10 03:10:26 2015 UTC,"Plan you meals for the entire week. Purchase foods you can reuse throughout the week ie: buy a bag of carrots, then have carrots as a cold side dish one day, chop some for soup another day, and cook them with a roast for a third day. Also plan for leftovers: you can get at least 4 meals out of a full pan of lasagna, so there's two dinners and two lunches, or four dinners, etc. you can freeze it as well if you don't want to eat the same thing every day.  You can def do this! I lived on $25/week in college without a meal plan. You'll be fine."
budgetfood,2rx52p,_blackbird,4,Sat Jan 10 04:30:20 2015 UTC,"I spend about this much at the grocery store and am also a college student.   For breakfast I eat instant oatmeal made with milk and then add peanut butter. This keeps me full for most of the morning.   I second another commenter's suggestion of a slowcooker. I can do this once a week, put it in tupperware containers, and then have lunch/dinner for the rest of the week. I tend to stick to ones that involve less than 5 ingredients and don't involve anything beyond me dumping everything into the crockpot. You can get chicken breasts at Sams for reasonable prices or look for sales at your local grocery store.  When I'm on the go at school, sometimes I pack a sandwich. Usually, I buy a bag of ciabatta rolls and freeze them. I take them out as I need them because they thaw quickly. I get 1/4 to 1/2 pound of salami and pepperoni, some sliced provolone cheese, and then whatever else I'm feeling like. These sandwiches are really filling (for me)."

budgetfood,2rx52p,lilac_chevrons,2,Sat Jan 10 04:50:49 2015 UTC,"I did this last year as a senior in college. $40/week is completely doable. I didn't own a slow cooker but if you don't mind leftovers reheating a meal is much faster than cooking a complete meal every night. I also typically had two types of meals in the fridge so I had a bit of variety. Some of my favorites:   Pearl (Israeli) couscous - I found it cheap at Big Lots. It's also cheap if your local store has it in the bulk food section. I toast in a pan with lemon juice and a bit of olive oil. Then add chicken or vegetable broth (or from bouillon cubes) until couscous is cooked. Add some sauteed mushrooms, a big double hand full of ribbon chopped spinach, a chopped green onion and just a bit of mozzarella or parmesan cheese and salt and pepper. The more vegetables you throw at this the better. It sort of ends up a bit like risotto imho.  I also made roasted vegetables a lot to serve with couscous. It makes a great  hot or cold salad. Just chop vegetables into similar size shapes (I used zucchini, yellow squash, tomatoes, onions), toss with garlic powder, salt, cayenne, and a tablespoon or two of olive oil and roast for 40 - 50 minutes at 400F/200C. If you want a bit of protein some cooked, shredded chicken is a pretty good addition.  Scrambled egg and avocado tacos are healthy, have protein, and cheap. 1 Avocado should last for 4 meals of tacos if you portion it out carefully. Roasted potatoes and veggies are also good taco additions.  I originally found this recipe from this subreddit. I just use 2 cans of tuna (I just use water packed, cheap tuna). I sub spinach if I don't want to pay extra for cilantro, throw in some chopped onion, a bit of garlic powder and cayenne instead of the chopped jalapeno. Also coating these in some cornmeal before cooking makes them worlds better.  Speaking of cornmeal, mixing cornmeal with water and chicken broth/veggie broth/bouillon is a super cheap and easy way to make polenta. I mix one cup of cornmeal with water as a slurry, then add the slurry to some just boiling broth and cook until thickened. I normally throw in chopped spinach for some extra veggies as well. It makes a great casserole base (add sauteed veggies cooked with canned tomatoes and dried oregano and basil, some cooked spicy sausage for protein, top with a bit of mozzarella and bake). Good luck!"
budgetfood,2rx52p,IcarusCrashing,2,Sat Jan 10 07:26:45 2015 UTC,"Buy a kind of meat (chicken, pork chops, beef chunks) and either poke it with a fork, add somene tenderizer and seasoning (salt, pepper, garlic, or seasonall). Then marinade it overnight and bake it. Or you can make your own shake and bake.  Also, Tilapia is really easy. You can get a bag of individually sealed pieces and yaw one at a time under cold water. You can just put lemon juice (and butter) on it, or bread it and bake it. It cooks very fast compared to most meat."
budgetfood,2rx52p,lolpiplup,2,Sat Jan 10 08:16:45 2015 UTC,"As a college student myself, I can totally understand the struggle! I would recommend a few things to start:   Tons of fresh fruit and veggies. They're both filling AND nutritious! Who would've thought! :D The key to low prices is seasonality for produce, which is a double plus because they also taste better. Citrus is in! Cheap proteins! If you're like me and love some meat, go for the cheap stuff! They're not necessarily not  tasty, just usually not as tender! My go-to cut for a long week is pork shoulder/butt. It's cheap, tasty and tastes great reheated, because let's face it, you'll be doing alot of that! Carbs! can be a good thing if you don't load up on them. They fill you up and give you energy. Also serves as a great vehicle for pan gravies and fried eggs if you're into those things. You can totally get rid of carbs in your diet if you wanted to, but since great grains like spelt/farro/wheatberries are becoming more available, it might even be a central part of the plate!  When you have time, build up your prep skills. Efficient knife work will ~cut~ down on prep time, pun intended. Also, plan ahead! I usually have an idea by morning of what my dinner will be, so during breaks from studying or tiny gaps in schedules, I spend 5-10 minutes prepping as a sort of decompression or relaxation before working again. By the time dinner rolls around it should only take half an hour to throw together.  Be creative! Sauteed, steamed, stir fried, roasted, poached veggies can be jazzed up with a good array of spices. A good vinaigrette goes a long way too. As for proteins, marinades are FUN and easy to throw together and usually give good results as does rubs for roasts. Stews and braises are nice once in a while too if you know you won't have time later in the week!    Long winded speech over with.... I hope I helped... kinda... as you can tell, I like cooking more than I like stuDYING. Good luck!"

budgetfood,2rx52p,shankrocha,2,Sat Jan 10 09:18:18 2015 UTC,I agree with using a slow cooker.  I work crazy hours and am rarely home to cook.  Throw a whole chicken in the slow cooker and it's done when I wake up. Very tender and I can eat on it for four days. Cost about $8.  I'm also a fan of the individually wrapped sweet potatoes (cost about $1 a piece) that you cook in the microwave and bags of frozen vegetables (also around $1).  Not the most tasteful meals but they're healthy and help me get big and strong.  And bbq sauce. Sweet baby gains.

budgetfood,2rx52p,neuroticallyexamined,1 point,Sat Jan 10 23:59:27 2015 UTC,"Check what fruit and vege are in season before committing yourself to a recipe. Something may sound cheap (like pumpkin), but if you're buying out of season it can increase the cost significantly.  Eat lots of vege and source from local markets instead of large chain stores. This cuts out the cost and you will find you likely get fresher produce, it may just not look as pretty.  Find the staple can items on special. Beans, tin tomatoes, etc. Buy a few at a time and you're always able to whip yourself up something quick, tasty and nutritious.  Learn how to use flour - it's cheap and can add some bulk to your meal. Things like a stew using your tin tomatoes and some veges will be a whole lot more filling if you add some simple dumplings from flour and egg and let them cook in the stew before serving.   Use your freezer! It will save waste!"

budgetfood,2rcnvr,Howdyto_darling,1 point,Mon Jan 5 06:44:40 2015 UTC,"Eggs are mad dope cheap, like 85% protein and full of micronutrients.  In terms of cheap, nothing beats beans. They have a fair amount of carbs in them, so I tend to replace a lot rice/bread/noodles with just more beans (if you are watching macro ratios).   Depending where you live, pork can get cheap, especially pork shoulder, you can roast it, pull it, throw it in a slow cooker, etc.  Whey protein is actually super cheap for price per gram of protein, so if all else fails, just take more protein shakes."
budgetfood,2rcnvr,terroristdactyl,1 point,Mon Jan 5 19:36:37 2015 UTC,"Meat slop. Original recipe here http://www.silverhydra.com/2011/10/meat-slop/  High protein, high fiber, low carb, cheap, filling, and easy to make in large batches. Tastes pretty good too.   2.5 -3 pounds of ground meat (turkey or lean beef work well) 2 medium red cabbages, shredded (You can use a knife, a box grater, or even roughly chop it then give it a few good pulses in a food processor if you have one) 2 or 3 cans of tomato sauce, depending on can sizes. Try to get about 40 oz of sauce.  1 red onion, diced 1 package of mushrooms, sliced (any kind. Regular white button is fine) Add black pepper, hot sauce, and curry powder to taste.   You can brown the meat in a pan first for some extra flavor, but this is easily a one pot recipe as well. After browning or without, throw it all in a big pot with about a cup of water. Stir it up, bring it up to boiling, and then reduce heat to simmer for about 20-30 minutes, uncovered. Add water if necessary to keep it from burning. It should resemble a thick stew, or a thick chili, not a soup.  Recipe above will make about 7 big portions. Portions are big because you need to eat a lot of it to fill up. It refrigerates well and reheats well on the stovetop as well. Put it in saucepan, crack an egg into it, and maybe a splash of water and you can heat it up just fine.  It's also a good way to clean out some odds and ends from your fridge and cupboard by throwing it into the pot while it cooks. Canned (cooked) beans, sausage pieces, lots of different veggies (carrots, peas, spinach, broccoli, bell peppers, etc)."

budgetfood,2rbb48,elvaz,9,Sun Jan 4 17:34:44 2015 UTC,"To keep it simple, I would cut it into pork chop-sized portions, lightly salt them, and then grill/pan fry/broil/poach them. The trick with any of these methods is not overcooking the meat. For very thinly sliced portions, the cook time could be under a minute.   Once cooked, you can dress it however you like. Something Italian is a good default, e.g. marsala or piccata as it won't overpower the veal. It could even be as simple as drizzling a fruity olive oil and a squirt or lemon on it. If you are going to use a sauce, prepare it ahead of time so that it is ready when the meat is cooked.   Since you like spicy food, here's a Thai dipping sauce that I put on everything: http://shesimmers.com/2009/06/how-to-make-jaew-thai-dried-chilli.html. Chimichurri could also be a good dipping sauce.   To round out the meal, how about mashed potatoes and whatever is green and cheap? Mashed potatoes are delicious and you can use excess sauce as gravy for them."

The cooked and flavored meat was dried with the help of the sun and packed into bags produced from sheep's stomachs, needing only water to make it into a meal.

Maybe a strategy that could work and is super easy because you're just mixing and matching small healthy items that don't require cooking. Could do yogurts, fruits, milk/juice, cheese sticks, beef jerky, hardboiled eggs, muffins, olives, baby carrots, etc. Just mix and match what you like."

budgetfood,2r4n6x,phpistasty,3,Fri Jan 2 20:38:02 2015 UTC,"Trim a pork shoulder joint, I think mine was about 4lb.*  Preheat oven to 325f.     Make your favourite ""rub"", I use: Salt, pepper, paprika, cumin, onion powder, garlic powder, sugar. Rub this all over your butt! (lol)    On the hob, heat a couple of tablespoons of sunflower (or similar oil) in an oven proof casserole dish with a lid something like this.   Brown all sides of the pork in the oil.    Then add a chopped onion, and a couple of chopped cloves of garlic.      Add a can of Dr Pepper.    Put lid on and put it in the oven for a couple of hours.    Remove from oven when pork's internal temp. is 190f.    Stand pork on a rack with a tray underneath and cover relatively loosely in foil. I also put a couple of pairs of oven gloves and/or a towel or 2 on top. let it rest - anything up to an hour is fine.    Strain the remainder of the onions and juice through a sieve, put juice to one side and onion/garlic to another.    Meanwhile, finely chop half a white cabbage, grate a couple of carrots. Squeeze the carrot gratings hard to remove excess water. Mix this in a bowl with a couple of big spoons of mayo, some mustard (I used Dijon), some Worcester sauce, lime juice, salt, pepper, and anything else you like!  put it in the fridge.    Grab the juice you strained, skim the fat/oil off the top and put it back in the casserole dish on the hob and boil it to reduce it.  set aside again.     With the onions, I added some golden syrup, white wine vinegar and some balsamic vinegar and gave it a stir; set aside.    After the pig has rested, shred it, throw away crappy bits. (if you want, you can put it back in the oven on the highest heat for 10-15 minutes, to try and crisp up the bark a bit before you shred it).  Then, get the amount you require, put it back in the casserole dish on the hob, add some of the juice, and heat. This is the stage I added BBQ sauce.      Assemble bread/pork/coleslaw/onions/yellow chili/bread.    *I trimmed the skin off and cooked this separately for some awesome crackling.  Edit: Just realised I didn't cost for the can of Dr Pepper - oh well, was in my fridge, and I guess any stock or beer would work as well."

Best part is, a lot of the ingredients are cheap right now!  Mexican Spaghetti Squash Casserole:   1 Medium Spaghetti Squash (Currently $.88/lb in N. Colorado) About a pound of any ground meat you like, I used about .8 lb of ground chicken 1 Lime (currently 4/$1 where I live, last week they were 10/$1) 2 Cloves Garlic 1 Red Bell Pepper 1 Onion Kale (Currently on sale for $.99 where I am) 1 can fire roasted tomatoes Cilantro 1 can tomato paste 1 can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce cheese -- I used cotija. This increased the cost of purchasing ingredients pretty significantly for me as that block of cheese was like $5. Good news is, I used very little of it and have a lot left for other uses and if you don't want to spend that money, you can use a different cheese.   Preheat oven to 375. Cut spaghetti squash in half and scoop out the gross stuff. Rub the inside flesh down with a little olive oil and some salt and pepper. Put the squash face down on a baking sheet and bake for 40 minutes. I bake for this long because I like it to be REALLY done with as little crunchiness as possible left so it's more like real noodles. While that's going, brown up your meat and set aside. Sautee your onion, garlic, and red bell pepper and when those are done add your meat back in and then add the fire roasted tomatoes, tomato paste, and peppers in adobo sauce. I chopped mine up before I added them. This is going to be a SUPER thick sauce. Do not do what I did. I wanted it to be more the consistency of Spaghetti sauce so I added some vegetable stock to thin it out. If you look in my picture theres some liquid in the bottom of the bowl so I think I made my sauce too runny. Leave it thick and goopy. Add some cumin if you like. When your spaghetti squash comes out of the oven, throw some coarsely chopped kale in the sauce just till it wilts a little bit. Make your spaghetti noodles by dragging a fork along the inside of the skin of the squash. If you cooked it for forty minutes, they should come out super easy. Turn your oven down to 325. In a casserole dish put your noodles in a layer on the bottom and then cover with sauce mixture and cheese. Bake at 325 for about 10-15 minutes until your cheese melts. When you pull it out, serve with some chopped cilantro, more cheese, and a lime wedge."

For breakfasts, eggs will add some variety at $1-$2/dozen. But the bulk should be whole oats. By memory, $4 should get you 20+ servings.  Also, you should buy some kind of oil or butter, but I hope you have some because that will likely add a big proportion of the expense.  Edit: if you can afford it, add in some canned tomatoes, tomato paste, or salsa. Maybe a few carrots as well.

I shopped in my local asia store as lentils,rice and soy sauce were super cheap there... I agree with the person saying eat oatmeal at least once per day. I did that over a longer stretch when I was at university and it fills you up so well.

Dinner sides are crab rangoons, pasta sides, home made breads (pita mainly, also tortillas and biscuits), and egg rolls. Dinners and oatmeal include a 4th adult, eggs etc. and lunch do not.   Kitchen equipment is a standing mixer of questionable quality, a turkey oven of shitty quality (hence my choices in breads), a small forman grill with no temp control, a two-slice toaster, stove top, and microwave.

I'm sure you can find a recipe for this but it's basically a zucchini split long ways, seeds scooped, and stuffed with a mixture of veggies, meat, and grains. Zucchinis and onions are usually the only fresh veggies I add and those store well.  Baked pasta? Like a pasta casserole.

Toss in a couple of roast chicken carcasses (or 3 lb of wings, thighs or drumsticks) and 3 quarts of water. Bring it to a boil and skim the foam off the top.

Drop in a couple garlic cloves, half a tablespoon of peppercorns and a teaspoon of dried parsley or thyme. Reseal the cooker and bring to heat for another hour. Strain the final stock.

So yeah, get a cheap one, try it out for yourself.  If you like it, great, or if you don't like it, or it's not worth the space it takes up, give it to a bachelor or new parents.  I've recently been trying to eat cheaper & healthier, and I think they're amazing; they're first thing to ever get me to cook regularly (I'm 32, roommate bought one 6 months ago).  Salsa Chicken is like the grilled cheese equivalent of a slow cooker.  Boneless chicken + salsa = cheap, healthy, flavorful meat ready to use in quesadillas, burritos, tacos, sandwiches, nachos…  /r/slowcooking is an amazing resource, as well.  In addition to meat entrées, you can also make stuff like mulled wine or other hot spiced beverages, as well as cake that stays super moist, and a bunch of other random and/or weird stuff (pizza?!).  EDIT: You can dress these up differently, too.  If you make a big batch of salsa chicken, you can later add beans & corn for nachos, and add pineapple and teriyaki for sliders, drench one in cheese & sauce like it's enchilada filling, etc."

budgetfood,2qpets,jackiedoesdomestic,5,Mon Dec 29 17:27:13 2014 UTC,"There are minimal differences between white and dark meat.  This article states the difference between the two calorically speaking:   The catch is that when it comes to fat and calories, there is very little to distinguish between boneless, skinless chicken breast and boneless, skinless thighs. According to the Department of Agriculture, 100 grams of the former contains 0.56 grams of saturated fat and 114 calories, and the latter 1 gram of saturated fat and 119 calories. Dark chicken meat is also nutrient rich, containing higher levels of iron, zinc, riboflavin, thiamine, and vitamins B6 and B12 than white meat   And gives reasons why many people perceive such a huge difference between the two.  The reason that makes the most sense to me being:   Poultry producers also realized that they could market and advertise the slight disparity in calories and fat content between dark and white chicken meat to their further advantage—not only to perpetuate the chicken craze, but also to retail a ""premium"" poultry product that could be sold at a higher price. They didn't deliberately malign chicken legs; they simply wholeheartedly extolled the salubrious qualities of breast meat. Chicken was a healthy option, but chicken breast was the healthiest, and it turned out that consumers were willing to shell out for the well-being of their families.   I, for one, will take the few extra calories and fat for the extra flavor and moisture (and nutrients).    To add : I meant to say that I second your suggestions.  They are all easy and tasty, and depending on the cost of meat can be cheap.  I just got caught on a tangent and distracted at work.  Forgot to finish my thought."

Add the partially sautéed veggies (optional - you can add whole kernel corn and\or corn meal at this point to get a consistency that you like; I've had luck using half a box of corn bread mix, but this adds sweetness you may not want in your patties). Stir it all together until well blended.   Form into round-ish patties, then press them into seasoned flour (or corn meal) to coat both sides generously. Toss the breaded patties onto a lightly oiled hot pan and fry both sides until you get a nice crispy crust. You can freeze them after they cool and they microwave very well.

budgetfood,2qp1vu,TheRealLilSebastian,3,Thu Jan 15 06:39:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what the Paleo diet is exactly (don't really follow all the diets just try to eat decently well.)  I am not sure what you mean by food stamps ""covering"" baby foods and oatmeal because food stamps can be used for any non-hot food item where I am at (meaning no take out, or cooked food)  I believe that you are looking at a meal plan that include mostly fruits, veggies and meats correct?    Many people use pasta, rice, and potatoes to stretch meals to make them cheaper.  To compensate for this I would suggest finding cheaper veggies to play that role.  Cabbage, carrots, and some squashes come to mind.  Unfortuntely you will have troubles if your diet is high in meat content.  As I am sure you know meat prices are ridiculous, and wjust keep rising.  Can you eat eggs?  they are still a fairly cheap source of protein.  Look at cheap cuts of pork, learn to use a lot of chicken as both of these can be under 2 bucks a pound.  I occasionally see beef round roast for around $3 a pound.  Learn to watch for specials and stock up when on sale!  Lastly the SNAP program is not really intended to completely cover your entire food needs.  It is to supplement your budget.  Especially if you choose to follow a strict diet, you may still need to make sacrafices in order to afford it.  Beware too that it actually gets tougher as you begin to earn more.  We were once getting over $500 a month, now less than a hundred even though our net income did not raise by that much.  I wish you luck, and hope you find a way!"

But it looks like many years ago, it might have been Atkins or low carb... I'm not 100% positive.  Either way, low carb is great for diabetics and my husband would love to eat more meat than bread and pasta... if we cut out the bread and pasta, we could afford a bit more meat.  We do eat eggs and dairy.  And as for the SNAP covering the baby food, I added that because the monthly allowance covers 5 people, but only 4 would be eating the same as us.  The baby's food would be jarred baby food or infant oatmeal, which is covered by SNAP, and we budget about $40 a week for it.  When I lived in a different state, SNAP did not cover jarred baby food or infant cereals- that was only allowed with WIC."

budgetfood,2q39w6,The_Alarm,11,Mon Dec 22 19:03:22 2014 UTC,"Serves 2:     Sausages  x 4 Potatoes  x enough Onion x 1 large White cabbage x 1 small Garlic cloves x 2 Butter for mash, plus sour/double/single cream or milk for added nomminess. Herbs to taste, I used Thyme, mustard seeds and black pepper. Stock x 3/4 pint (2-3 cups?) I used chicken. Cornflour (or other thickener) Veg oil Gravy browning x few drops (because I like darker colour gravy)   Medium slice onions. Peel potatoes and cut into smallish chunks, the bigger the chunk the longer the cook. Slice cabbage. Peel and crush garlic.      In a casserole dish suitable for stove top (or frying pan) heat the oil to a medium heat and throw the onions in, cook for 5-10 minutes until soft, then add the garlic and a twist or 4 of black pepper.  After another 5-10 minutes, empty onion mix into a bowl.    Turn the heat up a bit and put the sausages in so they brown. At this stage I like to scrape up all the brown bits of sausage off the bottom of the pan. Put the onion mix back in and reduce the heat back to medium. (You could have left the onions in, but I don't like them to go too brown for this dish, I like them soft and moist).      Meanwhile: Mix a couple of big teaspoons of cornflour with a little cold water, stir until there are no lumps. Add this and the gravy browning into the stock and stir, add this to the pot with onions and sausage.  Stir again. (I put a little red wine vinegar in at this stage because I had some hanging around, white wine vinegar, or red wine would probably be fine too, you just need something a bit sharp.)     Throw in some herbs. (feel free to add these with the onions).    Put lid on, turn heat down low. I left mine on for an hour.  Check it semi-freqently, give a stir, and top up with a bit of water if it's getting too thick for your liking.    With half an hour to go, put potatoes in saucepan, pour over boiling water and bring to the boil. Simmer until potatoes are soft enough for a sharpish knife to go in with hardly any force.    With 10-15 minutes to go, put the cabbage in a saucepan, with maybe a little salt and pour on boiling water and let simmer gently for 10 mins.    With 5 mins to go, drain potatoes - let the steam release from them for a few minutes, and transfer to a bowl with a tbs of butter and 2 of cream (or whatever combo you like).    Mash the potatoes - Actually, I guess this is techincally creaming, as I use an electric double hand mixer, an absolute no brainer way to make lump free mash.  Put mash on plate, add cabbage, add sausages, pour the onions and gravy as you so desire!   Questions welcome :-)  PS - I used to just grill/broil the sausages, mash the spuds with a masher and throw on some instant gravy. Then I started to enjoy cooking a lot more, and appreciating that a little bit of effort and prep increases the quality and satisfaction of a meal 10X."

budgetfood,2q4g9l,Calihipster,3,Tue Dec 23 00:34:04 2014 UTC,"I just thought of this and have no clue if it would work or not.    Cut a small hole in the  top of the watermelon, fill it with vodka and place in your fridge for a few days then transfer to the freezer(freezing right away will probably inhibit the transfer of flavors according to my wild guess).  Then remove and cut hole for dispenser.  Bring to parties, get laid.   edit: if you want to get super fuckin wild attach a bottle of vodka(from the freezer) upside down on the top of the frozen watermelon so that the flow of vodka through the watermelon is unrestrained.

You have twelve days, that works out at slightly less than a dollar per day.   Eggs are a good idea, they're surprisingly filling. I also recommend oatmeal. It can be made with water instead of milk if you can't afford that, although it's not as nice. Buy a bag of frozen mixed veg and throw a handful into every meal. Butter is a good, cheap and unobtrusive source of calories: add a spoonful or two to any dish that'll support it. Cheese does the same, but it's more expensive."

Pasta is just another starch and can be flavored with just about anything.

Should only cost you about $5, more or less depending on if you have rice already or not. Dried red beans are really cheap, just make sure you soak them the night before tossing them in the crockpot or on the stove.  Tuna fish sandwiches can also be paired with eggs, mayo, and a little celery and can last for a while in a pinch, especially if canned tuna is on sale.

budgetfood,2pzq6z,michellengineer,5,Sun Dec 21 23:36:41 2014 UTC,$40?! How many are you cooking for?
budgetfood,2pzq6z,Monty44863,1 point,Mon Dec 22 00:58:24 2014 UTC,2 people. I bought one of each item listed and it surely didn't come out to $10 per meal. I'm starting to wonder if shoplifting was involved.   Then again the prices listed on the site are per serving. Stores don't usually carry sauces per tablespoons or just one cup of noodles or spinach etc.
budgetfood,2pzq6z,michellengineer,4,Mon Dec 22 01:10:31 2014 UTC,"I could see how it could be $40 if you don't have a stocked pantry. But you should just have things like flour, pasta, olive oil, onions, garlic, milk, etc. on hand!"
budgetfood,2pzq6z,Monty44863,1 point,Mon Dec 22 01:16:00 2014 UTC,"Flour is always on hand. Pasta is used regularly. Onions garlic milk often go bad when its left there so its always used and bought when needed.   When someone is on a budget or close to broke, there's a lot of things that simply aren't on hand.   I think budget bytes is more for when you have a lot of left over food items and need meal ideas. When I think budget bytes I think ""buying these items will guarantee nutrition and last at least a few days when your broke enough to almost need a food bank but prefer to try manage a grocery list better"" unfortunately that's not the case."
budgetfood,2pzq6z,Anomaline,3,Mon Dec 22 01:36:44 2014 UTC,"That seems...way too much. Did you buy all organic or something?  Looking at that with some budget/time-friendly substitutions, you can get...two 1lb sacks of frozen mixed veggies for ~$3, milk for $2, cheeses for $4 ($2 a bag), and $2 pasta at a Wal-mart/chain grocery store. The rest are spices and butter.  If you're missing a few spices when you cook, the dish is still going to be decent. Or, hell, realistically you don't need any spices. They're flavor enhancement, not the dish itself."

A small bag of non organic mixed veggies (corn, peas, carrot mix) is 2.99 for a small bag. Milk is $2 for a small carton, less than a litre but i bought the 4L for 5.99 instead of paying over $8 for it locally. The pastas I bought were 3.99 per bag, it was a no name brand. Cheese, even discounted is $6.99 which was also the smallest amount available. The Alfredo sauce per container is $5.99. Canola oil is 4.99 for smallest container. Olive oil is double the price for the same size as the canola.   Small bag of onions is 3.99. Gloves of garlic were 2.99. Frozen spinach was 2.99 per small bag.  All of the shopping was split between Safeway and Giant Tiger. I had a membership discount at Safeway and found a few things marked down. None of the items were organic.

budgetfood,2pvnjz,PoeDancer,13,Sat Dec 20 11:37:37 2014 UTC,"Karaage is a delicious, healthier, and easy to make fried chicken. The potato starch coating makes them crisp, but less sharply crunchy and greasy, and the bite sized pieces ensure you get the perfect ratio of crunch to juicy meat!  You need  -chicken thighs. As much as you want. Preferably skin+bone on because it's cheaper to debone yourself  -potato starch. Purchaseable at most Asian markets. Corn starch is an adequate substitute.   -Seasonings. I like salt, pepper, ginger, garlic, and a little curry powder.   -whatever the fuck dipping sauces you like.  -some kind of frying vessel (preferably cast iron pan)  -oil (not olive)  instructions:    Cut the meat off the bones and strip most of the skin off. No need to be precise.  Cut into bite sized chunks. Season with whatever. Edge on the lighter side- you're eating with a dipping sauce anyways and it's easier to season more later At least 2 inches oil in a heavy bottomed pan on high heat. When a wooden utensil bubbles when you stick it in the oil, you can star t frying. While waiting for oil, cover chicken in potato starch. Get em nice and white.  Fry them til golden brown. Enjoy with ketchup, sweet chili, honey mustard, whatever floats your boat   Edit: forgot to say this is my boyfriend and my favorite munchie food. Fry a big batch (we go through a whole flat of 6pc thighs ourselves!), and blaze it up"

budgetfood,2pvnjz,ndimoro,1 point,Sun Dec 21 05:09:51 2014 UTC,You don't need to create a crust like breadcrumbs do. The moisture from the chicken is enough to stick the starch on! The crust in karaage is created from drying the outer layer of chicken.

budgetfood,2ps8xb,danni091,8,Sun Dec 21 18:51:51 2014 UTC,"When I'm tight on grocery money I will sometimes pick up some ground pork instead of ground beef. It's probably not your best option for something like a burger patty, but in things like spaghetti or meatballs, it's fairly similar. I seem to always use it the same way in different recipes: I take whatever veggies I have leftover in my fridge and season/saute them (usually this is any or all of garlic, onion, carrots, celery, bell pepper, jalapeno, leeks, mushrooms, etc.) to soften the veg and decrease its moisture content by a bit. I then will add this mixture to the ground pork after it's cooled a bit. From here I usually make stuffed peppers, stuffed portobella mushroom caps, meatloaf (usually individual to save cooking time), spaghetti or meatballs with it. Adding the veg is a good way to bulk up an already cheap protein, use any perishable veg in your fridge, and to help disguise the un-beefy taste of the pork. Adding something with umami like soy sauce or mushrooms helps cover the pork taste as well, but I really don't mind the taste - you just can't pretend you're eating beef :) I'm sure it's way more versatile than these few things, but find what methods work for you and stick with it is generally my cooking motto."

Brown the ground pork, add soy and garlic, and then add veg. It's lazy and easy and gets you cooking. I really like it as a meat base for fried rice. It's also good as the basis for a Thai salad or Americanized lettuce wraps.  It does taste different than beef, so if you or the people you're cooking for are challenged by different tastes in your standard repertoire (These burgers taste funny), then you may just have to do different dishes.

To freeze, put on a piece of parchment paper in a single layer and freeze and then transfer to a freezer ziplock bag and suck the air out of the bag.

Gonna have to remake it with the juice to see the difference. Should have used more apples. I used two smallish Braeburns, and it needed a third one. Added about 3/4 cup of chopped flaked almonds, but you could use chopped walnuts, pecans, or roasted almonds. I think it needs some crunchiness.  Substituted Pumpkin Spice mix for cinnamon, and upped the dosage. It works AMAZINGLY. (So shush, you pumpkin-spice-nay-sayers). Didn't have any bread loaf tins, so I used a monster 9x11 Pyrex, and it baked just fine. The only problem is you'll need all 70 minutes of the cooking time, if you decide to use larger pans (duh), so I was up until quite late waiting for it to finish. But now I have a delicious breakfast and my flat smells like heaven!   It's got a similar moist, crumbly texture to banana bread.

I prefer the regular or Italian kinds to the Mexican flavor, but do as you will. Heat it up in a bowl with the microwave, 2.5 minutes should do. I like to stud my bowl of mac with the tomatoes, then grind salt and pepper onto them.  There's a lot of liquid in the can that just makes the mac watery, so I save it and add it to my taco meat. But sometimes I get fancy. I fry chunks of hot dog in a large non-stick frying pan until they get a bit brown, possibly adding diced onion. Then I use the can of stewed tomatoes to deglaze the pan, getting all that glorious fond up. I cook it down until it has formed a decently thick sauce, then put that on the mac.

budgetfood,2padbv,boba-boba,6,Mon Dec 15 01:50:06 2014 UTC,"It should actually the other way around. The reason grapefruit juice interacts with so many medications is because it interacts with liver metabolism enzymes, the ones that are responsible for ""detoxification"".

budgetfood,2padbv,Piscenian,22,Mon Dec 15 04:26:22 2014 UTC,"This is pretty easy. Get your oven broiling-- mine has a setting for lo broil or high broil, I did low. Cut your grapefruit in half and then use a knife to separate the pieces. Put cinnamon and brown sugar on the top and then broil for about 7-8 minutes or until the sugar is nice and melty. Take it out, sprinkle with more sugar if you like and eat it. I like this method better than how my mom fed it to me as a kid which was just cut in half and drowned in white sugar. The warmth and the cinnamon makes this feel like a really good winter breakfast or snack. You could also try this with honey or maple syrup.   Also a warning for any who may not know: grapefruit can interact with certain prescription medications including birth control. I enjoy one occasionally but it's not a food to eat regularly if you take certain drugs. Usually a quick google search of ""grapefruit and [the name of your medication]"" can tell you if there are potential interactions."

You can do all your prep and cutting while sitting then you only have to stand up to put the bowl in the cooker.  An easy recipe is to put a big onion, a few carrots, some celery, a potato, and a big can of diced tomatoes in the pot. Add a can of tomato sauce. Then add water until it just barely covers everything. It's best to stir every couple hours, but it's fine to do it when at work or overnight. Use whatever stew meat is on sale. I usually like pork ribs for this kind of thing. You might want to hold off adding spices until the end just so you don't overspice it and ruin the whole thing (16 year-old me once put a whole garlic bulb in a stew.)

budgetfood,2pajx1,patchgrrl,0,Sun Dec 14 23:18:03 2014 UTC,"this sounds pretty tasty. I wonder if the concept would hold up with, say, a ranch or spinach flavored dip, if i'm not a salsa person."
budgetfood,2pajx1,patchgrrl,2,Sun Dec 14 23:44:12 2014 UTC,"I'm not a huge tomato person, either, but the two integrate so well with each other, so once it's all shredded & mixed, it's really just tasty chicken at that point.  There have been recipes I've seen using dips or dip mixes.  For real, though, go check out the sub… they can help you way more than I can."
budgetfood,2pajx1,patchgrrl,2,Mon Dec 15 00:06:36 2014 UTC,"One of my favorites is ranch chicken. You just lay your chicken in the crock pot (any type will do, I prefer boneless/skinless thighs myself) and sprinkle a packet of (Hidden Valley) ranch powder over it.  (If you use boneless/skinless breast, add about half a cup of water).  It really is that easy, and it's beyond delicious.  It pairs nicely with just about everything.  Potatoes, rice, noodles, veggies, etc.  It also makes fabulous leftovers."
budgetfood,2pajx1,Willow_kender,2,Mon Dec 15 13:01:30 2014 UTC,"The beauty of the slow cooker is that it does not require skill. I think your friend got you the perfect tool for your situation. For unbeatably easy clean up I strongly recommend using liners.   Throw in cheap steaks and cream of mushroom soup and cook on low for 4-8 hours. Adding chopped onions and sliced mushrooms is an option. Sprinkle on parsley when serving for presentation and flavor.   A pound of hamburger meat, a chopped onion, a can of greenbeans, a can of corn, a big can of stewed tomatoes, a can of potatoes, a can of carrots, and a can of broth. Vegetable - beef soup for days. Season with basil, parsley, thyme, salt and pepper. Less than $9. Low heat for 6-8 hours.  A pound of hamburger, a large chopped onion, 2 chopped peppers (use bells if you don't like heat), a can of kidney beans and a can of diced tomatoes. Season with chili powder and salt and pepper. Serve on broken tortilla chips and top with cheese. Low heat for 6-8 hours.  Chopped ham, cabbage, potatoes, carrots, onion, and season with caraway seed, salt and pepper.  Serve with a splash of vinegar. You can add sauerkraut if you like it. Low heat for 4-6 hours.  Chopped chicken, onion, carrots, celery, and egg noodles with chicken broth.  Season with salt, pepper, and garlic for chicken noodle soup. Low heat for about 6-8 hours. Add the noodles in the last hour.  Pork shoulder (Boston butt) in bbq sauce. Low for 8 hours. Shred for pulled pork sandwiches.   Carrots, celery, onion, potatoes, and a quarter inch of water with a chicken or a beef roast or a pork roast on top. Low for about 6-8 hours.   Greenbeans are amazing in a crock pot if you need a side for a few days. Ham hock or salt pork or bacon grease and onion powder, salt and pepper."

Add another vegetable with it and you'll have a super healthy meal.  I also like channa masala, chickpeas in curry.  If you have your own favorite curry sauce, grab it, half an onion, and three cups of chickpeas. Simmer until chickpeas are tender.  Hummus! Hummus is great! Chickpeas, tahini, some lemon juice, salt, and olive oil. Hummus goes great with veggies, I also like it with poultry.   These are all done with chickpeas that have already been soaked."

I'm pretty lazy so my taco build is white rice, black beans, shredded cheddar cheese and hot sauce (white rice takes the longest to cook).   If you don't want to be so lazy you can cook pineapple in hot sauce. Pineapple is perfect for picking up hot sauces without being too spicy!

budgetfood,2p9udd,Silly_Buisness,6,Wed Dec 17 15:52:48 2014 UTC,"I only use dried beans, and Im a vegetarian, so I have a ton of suggestions! First, I would recommend cooking a ton of them in your slow cooker (so you can just turn it on before you go to bed or to work, and you don't have to worry about it) and freezing them. Because they're dried, it's always annoying when you want to use them and can't because of the time it takes. I usually make about three cups worth of dried beans at a time. Here are a couple recipes to get you started: http://www.budgetbytes.com/2014/07/slow-cooker-black-bean-soup/ - http://allrecipes.com/recipe/black-bean-and-corn-quesadillas/  You can also use chickpeas for some pretty awesome things, like in the place of croutons:  1 (15-oz) can chickpeas (or 1.5 cups cooked) 1/2 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil 1/2 teaspoon fine grain sea salt 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, and then roast in the oven for about 20 minutes at 400 degrees.  OR you can roast them and eat them like chips. I make salt and vinegar chickpea ""chips"" often, and my boyfriend loves them. Here's the recipe: http://ohsheglows.com/2010/08/03/easy-salt-vinegar-roasted-chick-peas/  I hope that helps - you'll have the best luck getting creative and good uses for chickpeas and black beans on vegetarian and vegan websites. Even if you're a big meat eater, some of the ways vegans use beans is pretty awesome and always delicious instead of just hummus and couscous with beans in it. (:"
budgetfood,2p9udd,MrsEaves,5,Sun Dec 14 22:20:37 2014 UTC,"I always toss my dried beans (chickpeas, black beans, whatever) in a crock pot with some water before I leave for work in the morning. They're perfect when I get home! I like to use chickpeas in minestrone and hummus. Black beans are great for black bean soup or black/red beans and rice if you have a ham bone to cook them with."
budgetfood,2p9udd,sriracha_everything,4,Sun Dec 14 20:01:53 2014 UTC,One trick about chickpeas: include 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda in the soaking water and the cooking time will be greatly reduced (cook in different water than you soak in).
budgetfood,2p9udd,MzScarlet03,2,Sun Dec 14 20:49:19 2014 UTC,You should try a chickpea curry. You can adjust the spiciness to taste and can sub out what you already have in the house ingredient wise. Here is a sample recipe: http://cookieandkate.com/2014/quick-vegan-chana-masala/

budgetfood,2papnk,Asdyc,5,Sun Dec 14 22:07:25 2014 UTC,"If you already have chili powder and cumin, you can make chili. I live alone, and that usually lasts me a whole week.  Simple recipe I use is: 3-4 tablespoons of chili powder 2 teaspoons of cumin 1 lb ground beef  1 cup of water 1 can of pinto beans drained 1 can of red kidney beans drained 1 can of diced tomatoes 1 can of tomato sauce  (these are all the normal sized cans) 1 medium onion chopped some garlic cloves (I use like 5 cloves because I love garlic) diced 1 jalepeno (usually green bell pepper, but jalepeno is a lot more affordable, goes a longer way, and imo more delicious) [Optional]  In a pot, on medium-high heat, saute the onions in a little oil. Once half translucent, add ground beef and cook until a little pink. Add the water and wait for it to simmer. Throw in your garlic, jalepeno, cumin, and chili powder. Then add in the rest of the ingredients.   You can add more spices to your taste. I sometimes add a tablespoon of chicken buillon if I have it to make it taste a little better. And onion/garlic powder.  Crackers and cheese are optional. I wouldn't recommend it if you're on a budget though."
budgetfood,2papnk,waTabetai,1 point,Mon Dec 15 03:09:32 2014 UTC,"I'd like to add that Chili is great for freezing and then reheating, so you're not stuck with one kind of meal for the entire week.   I usually try to make 3-5 types of dishes and then just fill the freezer up to the limit with them and then I just rotate 'em to make sure I don't just get sick of it.   Atm I've got chili con carne that works great with rice, mincemeat sauce that's great with pasta, a thai curry wok that's amazing with rice and a noodlewok that's just great as it is - All of these are very cheap since I fill them up to the brim with different kinds of cheap vegetables and beans."

budgetfood,2p88xv,TheReverendBill,46,Sun Dec 14 05:19:58 2014 UTC,I got the butter for cheap because it was about to expire so it was a manager special at sprouts + employee discount. I already had the parm in my fridge because that's what my husband likes to eat on pizza. There were no small packages of fresh parm and I knew if I bought a bigger package it would go bad before I could eat it. I used what I had. I downvote because how does criticizing my cheese and advising me to spend more money on food contribute to the /r/budgetfood discussion? The essence of the subreddit is to do the best you can with what you have on hand. Sometimes it feels like it's not even worth it to submit posts because reddit can be so negative when all you're trying to do is help. You submit something with canned beans? Should have saved money and used dried beans. You submit something with cheap cheese? Should have made it taste better and used expensive cheese.

For future reference, though, hard cheeses like parmesan freeze quite well, and will keep in the fridge for quite some time. If you find the flavor worth the extra cost, you can buy a wedge of a nice parm, cut it into a few smaller pieces, and pull from the freezer as needed. You can either grate as needed, or grate the entire (smaller) piece and store in an airtight container in the fridge."

Take whatever you store your bulk items in to the store with you and before you start shopping, ask a cashier to tell you what the tare weight of your container is. Pint sized mason jars weigh about .4-.5lb, these little plastic containers weigh .10 lb. It helps the cashier if you write the tare weight on the container, many people put it in sharpie on their mason jar lids so it's easily referenced. I didn't write it on the plastic containers because they were all the same and it was easy to remember. So then when you check out, the cashier can just subtract the weight of the container. Usually if it's between two weights, I'll round up meaning I subtract more than the container actually weighs and you pay less for your food. It helps you know how much to buy for the containers you own and prevents those plastic bags from tearing and raining oatmeal all over my freshly cleaned register. >_O"

I have a question for you, though: I go to Sprouts in the DFW area all the time and bring my own containers for the bulk goods, and every time I get confused looks from the cashiers. No one seems to know how to handle the tare weight of my containers (that I've always weighed beforehand). Is this actually possible to do smoothly at a Sprouts?"
budgetfood,2p53rh,jimmyolsenblues,1 point,Sun Dec 14 02:27:14 2014 UTC,"From what I've seen, sprouts has pretty high turnover rate and newer cashiers might not have encountered it. There's a touchscreen button that they can hit that says ""manual tare"" and then pick the tare weight. If you refer to it as a manual tare, it should be pretty easy for them to find. Or just try to identify the more experienced cashiers.   If you're hitting them up tomorrow, also be sure to grab the navel oranges 5 lbs for $1. They are some damn good oranges."
budgetfood,2p53rh,recessionbeard,0,Sat Dec 13 21:49:00 2014 UTC,"It's because of the horrible point of sales system sprouts has. There isn't a ""tare"" button. So you cant just put any container up there and tare it out. Instead they have options like ""tare 0.01"" and so on. Most people's containers weigh more than 0.21 which is the highest the computer will allow a cashier to tare. Those weights are inputted in the system with sprouts bags and packaging in mind, not everyone else's.   Head cashier here. 10/10 know my sprouts shit"

budgetfood,2p3zjc,whatthefuckamidoing,7,Wed Jan 14 04:23:00 2015 UTC,"Both dried and canned beans at Aldi are cheaper than anywhere else. The one nearest to me has black beans, Great Northern beans and pinto beans dried and a pretty wide variety of canned ones.  The brand of tortillas they carry are called Benita. They're very good.  Their pantry staples like flour, sugar, butter, shortening, cooking oil and the like are super-cheap but perfectly good quality. They also have a small but good, basic selection of herbs, spices and seasonings.  We buy old fashioned oatmeal in big containers there. Also raisins, nuts and other dried fruits. In that same aisle is the peanut butter, which knocked my socks off as I'm normally a Jif-only kind of girl.  The cheeses are extremely good for the price. They carry mostly the usual American, cheddar, mozzarella and Swiss, but there are a few specialty ones that show up from time to time that would really surprise you.  The produce can be a bit more hit and miss. If you can pay attention to when they're their trucks come and get it right away, you'll find some fantastic stuff. It gets picked over quickly so a day or two later and what's left won't be nearly as nice.   Edited to grammar-Nazi myself."
budgetfood,2p3zjc,loveshercoffee,5,Sat Dec 13 01:00:23 2014 UTC,If you have an appropriate phone you can download and install the Aldi app.  They also have a website aldi.us.

I definitely sing the praises of Alidis. lol  They have baking supplies for cheap. My store always has a Hispanic section....so you can find tons of different kinds of tortillas, veggies, corn meal, etc. I find that stuff nice....'cause lets be honest, just about anything can go into a tortilla and you've got yourself a meal. Any meal. Including dessert. lol  Their seasonings are pretty cheap. I think this would be my #1 thing to get and have. Spices seriously make the difference between something that's just edible and something that tastes super yummy even if you're cooking on the cheap-cheap.  I would definitely hit up the veggies. My local store just had 10lb bags of potatoes for $3. So I grabbed one of those. Potatoes are another one of those things that you can do just about anything with.....even desserts (hello potato candy lol).   But yeah.....spices add some life to these ol' boys.  They have big bags of rice at a good price.   I always stock up on beans, canned tomatoes, they have super cheap soup (like, 50cents a can ....if I were to buy that same size can of Campbells in a 'regular' grocery store...I'd pay almost $2 for it).....if I get soup, I usually get something to cook with .....'cause casseroles and crock pot stuff seems to go far and be filling, even if it isn't the most glamorous stuff some times.  Beans and tomatoes.....I usually make a super hearty homemade chili. I toss in whatever vegetables I've got around. Soo yummy.  Maybe look into some cheap and budget meals.....that might give you an idea on what kind of things you'll wanna look for at Aldi. (lol I've been doing this myself and trying to come up with an uber cheap menu....that's why I suggest that).  Also, if you want organic products or gluten free.....they've got a ton of it at cheap prices."

Of course, then you have to add the cost of a bread machine on (which can get pricey if you buy new they are ~$100). I have one, it takes <5 min to measure out the yeast/water/flour and hit a button. Come back in 3 hours and your house smells amazing and you have more bread that tastes better.  Even if you DO buy a $100 machine, if you're saving $1.00/loaf you can make it back pretty easily if you have a family that eats a lot of bread."

Say it takes me two hours to mow my own lawn, or I can pay someone $30 to do it.

And trying to put such a concrete monetary value on free time does get annoying, really quickly. Especially when it comes to stuff like cooking. If you apply good hourly to time spent cooking, then the ""most frugal"" option is to just order delivery for every meal.   But people enjoy cooking! How much, exactly? And it's certainly not pure enjoyment; there are always steps in the process that we don't like. Since we're putting a monetary value on free time, everything you do with it has to be worth that much to you or you're being un-frugal. Sometimes I bill myself out at a few hundred an hour, depending on the job. I certainly don't rate my enjoyment of cooking, or much of anything, that high. And yet it's a ""waste of my time"" to do anything if I don't feel like it's worth that much to me.  We should just value our free time at whatever we're willing to do with it. I feel like making some bread, so I'm going to do it. I don't have to ""remember"" that my time is worth something for my time to have value. It's worth exactly what I feel like it's worth."

budgetfood,2olkux,Chronx6,2,Mon Dec 8 02:31:26 2014 UTC,Okay lets say you value your time at $8/hr- basically around US minimum wage. Lets say it takes 15 minutes to mix the ingredients and another 10 to pan it/your involvement in cooking it/ect. So 25 minutes. So a little less than $4 in time alone. This isn't taking into account of taking up kitchen space or your oven time either.  Granted this isn't taking into account the time of picking up the loaf or the gas costs but as you'd already be there for other things you might be going out of your way by a few minutes to walk down a new row and pick something off the shelf.

And no your not being paid but in a cost analysis you have to try to quantify everything to get a truly clear picture. As money is just an abstract of time you spend doing things and payment at jobs are the easiest way to place a value on that time its what you tend to go with in an analysis.
budgetfood,2olkux,Alicecold,8,Mon Dec 8 02:40:38 2014 UTC,"Eh, I'd say a more realistic valuation of the time spent baking would be to ask how much you value your time on reddit, because realistically that's what a number of us give up when pursuing offline hobbies."
budgetfood,2olkux,rayzorium,7,Mon Dec 8 02:45:40 2014 UTC,"Assuming two loaves per week with a total time using the oven of 30 minutes, the average person in the US will add energy costs of about $0.12 to each loaf if they have an electric oven and somewhere around $0.07 if they use a gas oven.  Here is a tool to use to figure that. http://michaelbluejay.com/electricity/cooking.html  Since most places in the US have a minimum charge for the first 1,000 or so gallons of water used per month, I'm thinking it probably adds no additional cost to make this bread twice per week, assuming the use of tap water.

That depends, though, doesn't? A lot of people reddit from work or from their mobile while waiting in lines or whatever. The thing about baking bread is, yeah, there is a lot of downtime during rising, but it can still take a few hours with needing to do something active smack in the middle of it (mix, knead, rise, knead, possibly portion into rolls/buns/what have you, rise again, then bake) at least in the recipes I've used. It's not like a crock pot where you set it up then you can be gone all day and then stick it in the oven. If you let bread rise for too long it can be almost as bad as not rising long enough, again, depending on the recipe. There are time saver ways to do this, but it's really not saving much time. Plus I've never made bread without making an unholy mess in the kitchen, so add another 15+ minutes of clean up, between dishes and scrubbing flour out of every crevice.  I mean, if your plan is to hang around the house all day or running errands where you can come back whenever to do the next step, it can still be well work the time, but it's really not comparable to reddit (or interneting in general) which can be done any time, anywhere, or however long or short a time as possible."
budgetfood,2olkux,pizzaonabagel,2,Mon Dec 8 18:41:32 2014 UTC,"The argument with time being money isn't so much about not getting paid to make bread as it is about an extremely low paying endeavor encroaching on ones free time.  It's also worth noting that dude's recipe is for some pretty bad bread.  It's straight up flour/salt/yeast... bleh.  Good bread, from home or the store, is going to have quite a few more ingredients.  Very small quantities though, so nothing to dramatically raise the price.  Additionally, I get bread cheaper than $2 from the store all the time, so there's a lot of wiggle room here on the actual savings.  Let's say you use 2 loaves of bread a week, that's a savings of 2 bucks a week.  Or at least so it would seem.  The bread you make at home is going to be very different than the bread you buy from the store.  First off, they don't call things the greatest invention since sliced bread for nothing, good luck getting your home slices into even uniform slices ready for sandwiches and the toaster.  Chances are, you're not going to get as many slices out of your loaf as the professionals do.  So you might end up needing a third loaf of bread per week, cutting that $2 savings in half.  Home made bread doesn't keep like store bought.  Store bought bread is full of preservatives.  Yes, we've all been told our whole lives... ewww!  NOT PRESERVATIVES!  I have too, so I tend to agree, however, when you've got mold all over your two day old bread you'll probably be wishing it had some preservatives in it.   Bread from the store can last up to and even exceeding a week.  Very rarely do we ever throw bread away because it's gotten old, but back when I made bread all the time throwing away half a loaf was a common occurrence.  I don't mind giving stale bread to the dogs, but I would never consider giving them moldy bread, so with the store bought bread there is literally never a wasted crumb.  You're going to have one hell of a time trying to reproduce the quality of store bought bread as well.  Notice in the video dude's loaf kinda thumps down on the counter?  Don't get me wrong... with home made bread it isn't that hard to make something that tastes absolutely amazing... hot and fresh from the oven.  However, the next day, not so much, the day after that... bleh.  There's a reason they used to sell day old bread to poor people.  You're going to be wanting to make bread every other day at least.  You can experiment with refrigerating dough balls, but they don't keep much longer than bread.  Therefore, several times a week you are going to have to make dough.  You are quite simply going to need a good mixer with a dough hook.  It's an absolute must.  If you don't already have one, they are several hundred dollars which will therefore take a couple years for those ""savings"" to kick in as you spend the next two years making bread every other day to work off the price of the mixer.  The long and short of it is possible to save a very small amount of money making bread, but it's more work than getting a pet.  If you like to cook (and don't mind washing dishes), baking bread once in a while is great.  Everyone should do it.  Hot and fresh from the oven... oh my!  Everyone knows when you go out to eat you tell yourself you're not going to fill up on bread, but then it comes to the table all hot and delicious so you just can't help yourself.  That's not hard at all to do at home, once in awhile.  Becoming your own personal bread distributer for your family is another matter altogether.  It's a lot of work that simply does not pay for itself  unless your time means nothing to you.  What I mean by that, and what pretty much everyone else means by that, isn't that if it doesn't pay $20/hr I aint doin' it!  What I mean is, there are only so many hours in the day.  My days are already pretty full, and I never feel like I get as much time to do the things I'd like to do as I want.  Spending a dozen or so hours a week mixing dough, baking bread, slicing bread, and washing extra dishes, all to save $1-2... yeah, I don't think so.  If you're sitting at home right now staring at the wall, sure, save yourself a buck or two.  Finally, I'd like to point out that bakeries are fairly local.  Which means the money you spend on bread, for the most part, stays in your local economy."
budgetfood,2olkux,Reggae4Triceratops,2,Mon Dec 8 19:18:51 2014 UTC,"Or other incidentals like, the equipment needed (split across all bread made, it's very very small, but if you don't have it to begin with it's a huge cost) or soap and things to clean the equipment used.  In the end though, it still works out to cheaper, just not by an entire dollar.   But, more importantly, this is a comparison of basic white bread which you can buy fairly cheaply in the store. If you get into more hearty or specialized breads then the value of doing it at home sky rockets. The cost difference between the ingredients (when bought in reasonable bulk quantities) versus the basic white bread ones is very little, but the loaves cost 2 to 4 times more in the stores."

budgetfood,2olkux,random012345,1 point,Tue Dec 9 00:45:12 2014 UTC,I think if you're making bread for yourself by hand then the weight falls on it being cheaper to buy bread at the store and freeze what you don't eat immediately.   If you're a big family and eat bread constantly? Then buying a bread machine and making your own can be much much cheaper by a huge margin.   I think the answer to the question depends on where you live and your situation.   My spouse is from Eastern Europe and in her home town there are so many bakeries producing such cheap bread that it would be almost impossible to make it for cheaper on your own.
budgetfood,2oh10n,whitherward,8,Sat Dec 6 17:28:36 2014 UTC,"My advice is to make a weekly menu. Decide what you like.  Meatloaf mondays? Taco tuesdays? Liver Wednesdays?  Whatever,  do the whole week, then sit down and list your ingredients.  Then it'll be easy to see what you need. Get really good at those 7 (ish) recipes. ( I generally look up ""easy"" versions of recipes.  Otherwise i get things like arugula crusted lychee goat cheese burgers, and ain't no body got time for that)  Make double, freeze it so when you don't have time,  you just reheat it. It's really cheap when you know exactly what to buy. Not knowing is so overwhelming and confusing. As for utensils,  I have a blender,  a big flat pan, a sauce pan,  a crock pot, a stock pot (for soups), a good set of knives, something to bake in and a metal spatula I can. NOT. live without.  You don't need much to start out with.  If I had to get kitchen stuff, I would get a ""big flat"" pan,  a metal spatula,  knives and the sauce pan,  and maybe a wooden spoon or something.  You'll discover what you need through practice.  Hope this helps! Good luck!  I stated out like you and I've not once given anyone food poisoning! (So far) p.s. TOTALLY invest in a rice cooker. You can do all sorts of things with a rice cooker! Mine was $30 and works like a champ. P.p.s I do use metal utensils because I don't use non stick stuff. I would rather scrub my nice stuff than replace my pans every year or two because they get scratched.  Again,  you'll learn what you like as you go."

budgetfood,2oh10n,Wayne_Skylar,6,Sat Dec 6 22:50:21 2014 UTC,"You're a college student, so I'll give you a super simple recipe to get you started. You like meat, right?   I'd second the suggestion for a cast-iron skillet. You can pick up a Lodge skillet at Walmart for 20 dollars. This skillet will last you a lifetime. Not only that you can put it in the oven for baking things too. They are very versatile.   So get a skillet. I'm guessing you have knives and forks and a plate? Get some meat. It can be anything, pork-chops, chicken-breast, steak. Best to start with beef, because if you undercook it, things will be ok. Go to the grocery store and just buy a cut of beef that you think you'd want to eat. It doesn't really matter as long as it's not a huge hunk.   Also while you're there pick up some vegetables. Get some broccoli to steam. If you want a starch, pick up some potatoes to put in the oven.   Steaming the broccoli: Take a bowl, fill the bottom bowl with about a half inch of water. Then take your broccoli, if you bought it from a bag it should already be cut, but if not, just take a knife and start cutting pieces from the larger stem. Put them in the bowl. Take a plate, and put it on top of the bowl upside down and put it in the microwave. Microwave it for like 5 minutes or until its tender enough to eat. Put some salt / pepper on it and you're good. You can also add things like butter or lemon juice, but I like mine plain.  The steak:  Pretty simple. Put some kind of grease in your skillet. It can be PAM, butter, vegetable oil, lard, crisco, whatever. You want to use just enough to cover the bottom and no more. Turn the eye on your stove to halfway. Once the skillet is hot, put the steak in. The key to not ruining a meal is, when in doubt, cook it at a lower heat. Yes it tastes better if you cook your steak at a higher heat, and get the edges charred, but you'll get to that later. It should take around 10 minutes to cook. Here's the secret though, if you want to know if your steak is done, just cut into it and look! A big part of cooking is tasting things and looking at them while the cook to check on them.  Finally the potatoes. There are lots of ways to cook them. I tend to buy the smaller ones, cut them into pieces, and boil them. This will take about 30 mins, so start doing that first.   Another simple recipe, breakfast!  Learning how to cook a good breakfast quickly is one of the things I'm proud of. I can start a pot of coffee, and have eggs, bacon, and toast ready by the time the pot is done.   Scrambled eggs: Take three to four eggs and crack them open into a bowl. Take a fork and mix them vigorously until it's a yellow mixture. Add some salt and pepper to the eggs then. Be careful not to overdo the salt. Some people add a little milk here too (about a tablespoon). Take your skillet and put the burner (the eye) on a medium-to-low setting. Put a little butter in the pan. Just enough so it covers the bottom. Once the butter has melted, pour the egg mixture in.   The eggs will start to congeal along the bottom. Once that happens, take a fork and gather the congealed bits of the eggs in the center. The rest of the liquid egg will then start cooking, keep doing this until they are solid, but still a little wet. Dump them on your plate. They'll continue to cook a little more as they cool.  Bacon is simple. Take four to five pieces, put it on a plate, and put it in the microwave.   As for toast, I'm sure you know how to make that!"
budgetfood,2oh10n,bb411114,12,Sun Dec 7 00:06:52 2014 UTC,"Get any skillet you can. If you have the money invest in something cast iron as it wont ever go bad seriously you'll be 80 using the same skillet. If you but something aluminum or cheap, it might last you a year or two. So invest here. Cast iron can get pretty cheap to http://www.walmart.com/ip/Lodge-8-Cast-Iron-Skillet/5969627  If your just making rice, and really nothing else then you can chea out on the rice cooker. The moment you cook something else in a cheap unit though you'll never have perfect rice again. Rice cookers have issues absorbing scents, and flavors of strong foods fish, onions, and teriyaki is particularly bad about this.   I have a cheap 10 dollar rice cooker that I got from Big-Lots it is a Oyster brand and it makes perfect rice.   To use a skillet turn the element of the cooking surface (usually a oven, or hotplate). Spray a nonstick coating to the pan (""some use butter, others use shorting, some us pam doesn't really matter. Cast iron skillets can eventually become non stick themselves and will no longer need this step. From here place your item of choice into the skillet and allow it to cook halfway through depending on item the time will vary, then flip and repeat on the other side. this is a generalization and will very heavily depending on: cooking times, items being cooked, and recipe.     Budget food isn't really all that hard, it basically boils down to trying to get the most food for the least money. You do this buy buying low then freezing. Say there is a sale on carrots, buy a whole bunch then cut them as desired or leave them whole, then freeze what you don't use for your meal. Now you'll have carrots on hand. Repeat this with meat, fruits, and other vegetables, as well as just about anything. If you don't have a freezer you can do the same thing with canned goods.   Just buy cheap, and discounted foods and work your menu around that. You can always have a few staples in your house though as they are always cheap such things are: Rice, pasta, and beans. None of these expire or need refrigeration, they also have long shelf lives. As well they can all be bought in bulk. I buy a 4 pound bag of Jasmine rice at walmart for 12 dollars. Its a relatively nice brand, they do carry much cheaper kinds. The rice last me about three weeks, but I am the only one who eats it, I eat it twice a day, and eat about 2 cups a day.   Pasta can be purchased for about 3-8 dollars when talking about cheaper brands, and 10-15 when talking about fancy brands.   You'll need a pot to cook pasta. It takes nothing to cook pasta, and a can of tomato sauce, and a real tomato, and onion to bulk up the sauce cost about 3.50. Beans are pretty self explanatory. You will need a pot to cook the beans in, or your rice cooker can do the job if it is a nicer one with a timer otherwise the weight will probably turn it off of cook long before the beans are done.   Get some stocks: the three main types are beef, chicken, and vegetable. a large box cost about 1-3 dollars and can be kept outside the refrigerator. These are nice to have on hand as they can be used in all manner of recipes, from soups to sauces they are invaluable to the budget chief. Boolean cubes are also a nice and cheap alternative to stock.     Spices are pretty easy really, sprinkle them onto meats, vegetables, and fish before cooking, and add a little bit after words if desired.   Walmart sells some spices in powder forms for as low as a dollar. A few that I'll mention that are worth wile to cheap on hand are: Salt, black pepper, chili powder, oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder,cumin, paprika, and red pepper flacks. honestly though this boils down to your taste pallet. Spices are not really expensive and usually don't go bad so buy as you want, and keep a few on hand.   Ask me any questions you have I am also a brook college student who cooks on a budget."

They are sometimes called wand blenders, hand blenders, Bermixers (after the brand name of professional models made by Dito-Electrolux), or boat motors (a nickname for larger commercial-grade immersion blenders, popularized by Emeril Lagasse and Alton Brown). They may be used for pureeing soups and emulsifying sauces. Some can be used while a pan is on the stove. Immersion blenders are distinguished from blenders and food processors that require food be placed in a special vessel for processing. They are distinguished from hand mixers which do not chop the food as it is blended.

budgetfood,2oh10n,slaming,1 point,Sat Dec 6 19:41:26 2014 UTC,I love my skillet. One tip if you've been used to using a standard frying pan with a plastic handle. A cast iron skillets gets hot. VERY HOT. Don't think that the handle isn't hot thats hot too. Keep a cloth near by for when you wan't to move the skillet about
budgetfood,2oh10n,LumpyOneEye,3,Sat Dec 6 20:23:51 2014 UTC,"I'm in college, getting the hang of things for myself as well. I think it's important to remember that everyone is different. Our shopping lists, our kitchens, our tastes. No one can really tell you what you need to have. The best thing is to take it step by step and figure your own style out. Start with the basic kitchenware: pans, pots, a strainer, a cookie sheet, spatula, big stirring spoons and then plates/bowls/silverware. Next, compile recipes of things you like to eat. Begin with recipes that have short and simple ingredient lists. Always read the entire recipe to make sure you have the kitchenware. When you are making your grocery list, compare the recipes. Choose things that have a lot of ingredients in common. That way you don't waste as much.  That's how I go about it anyways. It helps me a lot to have a plan. After that, you'll find yourself wishing you had a cheese grater or a egg separator or an electric mixer. You'll pick these things up slowly as you grow as a cook. Don't feel like you need to jump in head first. Good luck!"

budgetfood,2oh10n,jbooten,3,Sun Dec 7 00:01:15 2014 UTC,"I'm a grad student who loves to cook. I think I got my kitchen set up pretty nicely on a small budget for <$150.   Equipment:  I got a group set of stainless steel pots (two sizes of sauce pans, a large pot, and two nonstick frying pans) for pretty cheap at Walmart. Glass baking pan and a small cast iron skillet for cooking steaks and similar stuff. Splurged on a good set of Ginsu knives because dull knives suck.  Other random things include wooden spoons, cutting boards (one for meat, one for veggies), potato pealer, big plastic bowl and strainer.   These cover all the basics. Sure you can get a rice cooker here, or a slow cooker, etc, but I prefer using one thing for everything. I have yet to cook anything that required more than these items.  Basics foods:  I'd keep a standard supply of spices. If you don't know spices start with some basic stuff like oregano or basil. Black pepper, paprika, chili pepper, ginger, turmeric, cinnamon. Work your way from there.  I always keep garlic, onions, potatoes and rice on stock. I also get much of my veggies frozen to save money and keep them from rotting in the fridge if I don't use all of it.  I would buy the food items one at a time for various recipes and maintain so you don't get overwhelmed with it all at once. It'll also give you a chance to figure your cooking style and favorite ingredients."
budgetfood,2oh10n,chrisbluemonkey,3,Sun Dec 7 02:05:34 2014 UTC,"Another thing:  Ask your friends if they know how to cook and start cooking with them!  I grew up cooking for a big family, so I came to college equipped w/the know-how, and was surprised at how many of my friends/dorm mates didn't know anything.  Some of my best college memories are from cooking w/a mixed group and teaching people how to cook.  Some of the best dishes I've ever had came out of a summer of cooking in a house with 5 people all at mixed levels of expertise (wine braised short ribs by a guy who had been attempting cooking for 2 months!) and one time we set our kitchen on fire w/a hot pan of grease!!  (whoops!)  Share the learning experience!!"
budgetfood,2oh10n,Teriyaki_Pterodactyl,3,Sun Dec 7 02:07:43 2014 UTC,"I'd get a cast iron skillet and a ceramic coated Dutch oven. Then I'd check thrift stores for a metal spatula,  cleaver,  paring knife,  wooden or plastic solid and slotted spoon, and measuring cup/measuring spoon set.  Sometimes dollar tree carries measuring instruments and these great thin but viable stainless mixing bowls.  I've even used them as double boilers before. That's a good set of equipment to get you started. As you make Things you'll start to build a wish list of other pieces.   Edit: I meant to say that I cook all my rice in the Dutch oven listed above.  Add water and rice.  Bring to boil with lid on.  Stir and let boil for a moment.  Replace lid and remove from heat.  I love how all kinds of rice turn out that way and I save myself another piece of equipment."

I'm going to tell you something that has saved the life of my pans, keep them well lubricated and avoid soap as much as possible. This means shocking it with water while it's still hot from cooking. An old sous chef I worked with gave me that advice for my egg pans. This is also very important for cast iron skillet as soon as you have them seasoned. It keeps them non stick."
budgetfood,2oh10n,mylifeissucky,3,Sun Dec 7 03:25:34 2014 UTC,"It's the colder months, soup can go a long ways.  You'll need a stock pot.  A single pot could feed you several days.   Soup in a nutshell is learning to just throw stuff in a pot and add some spices till it tastes good, soup is one of the easiest to cook.     Start with a Mirepoix (Carrots/Onions/Celery), Add a can of tomatoes, maybe a tablespoon or two of tomato paste.  Add some beans, dried beans are cheapest.  Get bones if you can, they really add to the flavor Brown the bones in the skillet or bake at an hour at 350), add those to the pot and simmer for awhile, Remove the bones.  Salt and pepper to taste, Add protein such as a smoked sausage, chicken, beef, etc... Simmer, idea is low and slow which allows the flavors to blend and mature.     Fresh maybe better, but you can always use the sale item veggies that the store wants to move.  They don't have to be visually appealing, you're just going to chop it up and throw it in the pot.  http://www.foodnetwork.com/how-to/photos/how-to-make-flavor-bases-mirepoix-soffritto-and-more.html"

Those things last for many many years, your GRANDCHILDREN will be using it still, likely for quite some time after you had passed away and your kids are older. Those things last forever.  I would say to get some cloves, curry powder and allspice and a few choice seasonings. Usually, I have found enough for one person from a dollar store. You can check the dollar store for your seasonings and spices. Salt and pepper are had there, often in a set there as well, I have seen."

Recipe list is pretty much done! Feel free to cook these in any order, the only recipes that require leftovers are the Fish Cakes and Tacos/Chili.    List of (hopefully cheap) things to buy: Onions (at least 6) Green Bell Peppers (at least 3) Lentils (dried - they don't need pre-soaking like other beans) Small container of Cajun Seasoning like Tony Chachere's or Slap Ya Mama Vegetable Oil (if you don't have this already) Shredded Cheese (i'm not sure how much you have, but with some these recipes you might need a little more)  Bacon (optional - you can buy an 'ends and pieces' pack for this, and cut the bacon meat/fat into small pieces to add flavor to the Red Beans, Chili, and/or Potato Quiche) Curry Powder (if this isn't already in your spice cupboard) 1 can Cream Of Tomato Soup  Day 1 - Red Beans and Rice 2x cans light red kidney beans, 1 can chicken broth, carrot, onion, green bell pepper, cajun seasoning, basmati or botan rice.    Saute one or two finely chopped carrots, a finely chopped green bell pepper and a chopped onion. Blend or mash one of the cans of beans until smooth, like refried beans, then add the chicken broth and the other can of beans. Season with Slap Ya Mama or Tony Chacheres, or just use cumin, salt, black pepper and red pepper flakes. Serve on top of steamed rice.    Day 2 - Tuna Noodle Casserole Spaghetti noodles, 1 or 2 cans tuna in water, cream of mushroom soup, shredded cheese (optional).    Cook the noodles and mix with the mushroom soup and drained tuna. Optionally top with shredded cheese, and bake until golden-brown on top, or just serve as-is with vegetables.      Day 3 - Chicken ""Shepherd's Pie"" 2 chicken breasts, onion, cream of chicken soup, frozen peas and corn, potatoes, milk, butter.    Make a double batch of mashed potatoes - you'll use the rest later. Cut the chicken into small chunks and cook with a finely chopped onion, add to a casserole dish with the soup, some frozen peas and corn. Top with the mashed potatoes and bake until golden-brown on top.    Day 4 - Tuna Fish Cakes 2 or 3 cans of tuna, cold leftover mashed potatoes from yesterday, flour, 1 or 2 eggs, milk, breadcrumbs, lemon.    Mix the potatoes with the drained tuna and (if needed) season with salt and pepper. Make patties from the fish/potatoes (add flour or corn starch if the mixture is too 'wet' to handle), and add flour and milk to an egg to make a thick batter, or just use some of the pancake mix. Dip the patties in the batter, then cover with breadcrumbs. Pan-fry or bake until golden brown. Serve with a lemon wedge and steamed asparagus.    Day 5 - Two-Bean and Chicken Tacos Chicken breast, lentils, one can chickpeas/garbanzo beans, onion, green bell pepper, flour tortillas, taco seasoning, tomato paste, shredded cheese, lime.    Cook the lentils according to pack instructions, about three times the amount you think you'll need (they'll be used in another recipe). Cook an onion sliced into thin strips with the green bell pepper, then add the chicken (cut into small cubes) and cook thoroughly. Add the lentils, chickpeas and/or garbanzo beans and a little tomato paste. Season with taco seasoning and lime juice, top with cheese.    Day 5 - Three-Bean Chili Lentils, grillin' beans, great northern beans, tomato paste, tomato sauce, taco seasoning, onion, carrot, cheese (optional), pillsbury crescent rolls and/or rice.    Saute the onion and carrot, both chopped finely. Add the lentils and both beans to the pot, along with a tablespoon of tomato paste, the tomato sauce, and taco seasoning to taste. Simmer for at least 20-30 minutes or until the flavors have developed enough, and serve in bowls topped with a little cheese, with crescent rolls for dipping or rice on the side.    Day 6 - Potato Quiche (aka Spanish Omelette) Potatoes, 8-9 eggs, shredded cheese, onion, green bell pepper, defrosted frozen peas and corn.    Cut the potatoes into thick slices and boil or steam for about 10-12 minutes, or until just starting to soften. Cook the onion and bell pepper in a skillet, then arrange the potato slices on the bottom. Sprinkle over the peas and corn, then pour over the beaten egg. Top with cheese and cook under the broiler (or cover the skillet and cook on the stovetop) until the eggs are firm. Cut into slices and serve with vegetables, like honey-glazed carrots.    Day 7 - Vegetarian Curry (Tikka Masala style) 1 can garbanzos/chickpeas, lentils, carrot, onion, potatoes, curry powder, butter, cream of tomato soup, basmati rice    Cut the potatoes and carrots into cubes and steam or boil until slightly softened. Saute the onion and a few teaspoons of curry powder in the butter. Once the onion is cooked, add the carrots, potatoes, beans/lentils, and tomato soup. Simmer to reduce the sauce, about 10-15 minutes. Serve with rice.  If you get to Day 8 and you need another recipe, PM me what you've got left and I'll see if I can suggest something else. But if you have leftovers, you could freeze and stockpile them for the end of the week!"

It's not dissimilar to comparing one type of meat to another.    Personally, I prefer everything but the breast.    I either buy a whole chicken and roast it whole, or butcher it for various parts including breast if I am making curry.  Or I buy legs/wings.    I don't think breast warrants paying the extra money. For about the same price as 2 breasts, I can buy a whole chicken."
budgetfood,2o6zz2,Man-alive,2,Wed Dec 3 22:27:08 2014 UTC,"Well of course there's going to be a taste difference - Especially since there's a higher ammount of fat in the thigh and as such you get a juicer piece of meat with bigger leaway, making it easier to not let it get dry and such.   But I'd still say that you can discuss how much meat you get from every piece of breast/Leg you get.   Edit And I can absolutely argue if I can get more edible meat from lets say chicken, or salmon.   Taste is hard to argue if it's better or worse but when only talking about how much meat I can get for my money, I think it's fair to make comparisons."
budgetfood,2o6zz2,Man-alive,1 point,Wed Dec 3 22:34:57 2014 UTC,"Sure, I get you.     I suppose I am looking at it from the point that I personally don't value breast that much.   It's just how I see it, I am not necessarily right :O"

From a whole chicken I get: 2 breasts (bones and skin removed) 2 legs and thigh pieces (skin removed) 2 wings - I store these in the freezer until I have enough to cook for a meal About half a pound of chicken skin/fat - I render out the fat and keep it in a jar in the fridge, and I eat the cooked skin with salt Bones and scraps, including the neck, the wing tips and the tail - I make a simple bone broth from these, cooking them on low heat in salted water for a few hours.    You might also get chicken livers with your whole chicken, which are good with rice and onions. If you don't mind spending some extra time in the kitchen, they are worth the money."

My first attempt at breaking a chicken down was horrible, and I still can't cut a boneless breast as cleanly as they come pre-packaged. Nevertheless, I feel I am still getting a bargain, especially when I get a whole chicken for $1.49 a pound or less."
budgetfood,2o6zz2,CommitteeOfOne,0,Thu Dec 4 00:08:04 2014 UTC,"That's the best part: from the carcass you can make stock.   Cut off all the meat and stick the carcass in a ziploc bag in the freezer. Put two frozen carcasses in a large (8-qt) pressure cooker with 3 liters of water. Bring to a boil and skim off the scum that forms on the top, then seal the top and bring to a boil for an hour. Let it cool enough to open, then add 3 thinly-sliced onions, a few carrots, some parsley, a couple garlic cloves and a tbsp of black peppercorns. Bring it back to hear for another hour, then cool and remove the lid and strain through cheesecloth. If you don't have a pressure cooker, just throw everything into a pot, bring to a boil and then stick (covered) in a 225 degree (110 Celsius) oven overnight.   The stock that you get from this will be incredibly rich and nutritious, far far better than anything you get in the store. And, since you'll be getting 3 liters out of it, you'll be saving see serious money."
budgetfood,2o6zz2,CommitteeOfOne,0,Thu Dec 4 03:30:46 2014 UTC,I think so. I watched a couple videos on how to cut up a chicken and how to deboned one.  I did a pretty good job even my first time. It was also kinda fun.

budgetfood,2o6lvl,Man-alive,5,Thu Dec 4 00:17:18 2014 UTC,"There's a lot of things you can do that won't up your budget too terribly much, I think.  Things like chain meals can really boost your meals without adding too much to your bottom line.  A rotisserie chicken is around $5-8.  Using that as a base, I make pasta, enchiladas, etc, with 2/3 of the meat.  I then boil the carcass and make stock.  With that, I add a bouillon cube or two, some fresh veggies, noodles and the rest of the meat for chicken soup.  The whole thing ends up costing around $2 per serving.  I recently made beef short ribs for short rib tacos.  I then used the left over sauce from that (some veggies and salsa that cooked with the beef) and boiled up a lb of black beans for soup.  I served that with rice and the left over beef from the tacos, and the whole thing came out to less than $2 per serving.    both of those recipes are things that take a while on the stove or in the crock pot, but have a really low prep time, so you shouldn't have to spend hours slaving when you have kids underfoot.    also, breakfast for dinner (eggs, hash browns, toast, pancakes) can be really quick and easy, and very cheap!  hope that helps. :)"
budgetfood,2o6lvl,itsamutiny,3,Wed Dec 3 20:15:04 2014 UTC,"I have one for sunday for you:  Spatchcock chicken with egg fried rice and zucchini/courgette   (Cost about £2 per person).    For the chicken: Using a big knife, feel for the backbone of the chicken, and cut down either side of it and remove it.. Should be simple. Flatten/squash the chicken.    There are a million methods for marinating it. I just got a bottle of one of my favourites: Cabana's malagueta sauce and generously covered both sides of the chicken. You can use whatever you want. You may want to cover it, roll it up and put it in a bag for a few hours. I didn't have time and it still tasted great. (of course, you have little ones, so maybe a sweet BBQ sauce or something might be more appropriate).  Cook it for 40 odd minutes on a medium heat. (depends on the size/weight of chicken, but a spatchcock cooks quicker as it's flat. I cooked mine on a rack in a tray so the heat can get underneath.i also turned mine a couple of times, rebasted, and moved it up to the top to blacken it slightly. Remember to allow 15 mins or so for resting.    For the rice. Take some frozen peas out of the freezer, put them in a pan and pour some hot/boiling water over them and leave them, this will soften them enough for when you need them. Cook some boiled rice in the usual manner, rinse it with hot water and let it stand for some time, half an hour or more is good.     When the chicken is resting put the rice in a wok with some heated oil, stir in some soy sauce.      Move the rice to one side of the wok, break in an egg, and mix/scramble it really well.. I find a chopstick is great for this.. Whizz it around until the egg is firmer, then stir it into the rice. Repeat for another egg. For every 35g of uncooked rice I use 1 egg. Then add the drained peas and some pepper (shouldn't need salt, the soy sauce takes care of that. Cook until it's warm, shouldn't take long. For the courgette/zucchini. Chop the ends off,slice into 4 slices, drizzle with olive oil, season, then I put mine in my George foreman grill for a few minutes, but they can easily be done on a grill/broiler or a skillet.  In my picture, the rice doesn't look great, I think the soy-sauce makes it look a bit brown, but my god it tastes great, so even if you don't do the rest of the meal, at least try doing the rice some time.  The chicken will probably be as good as what you coat it in. But it was cooked perfectly, very tender and moist (must must rest it).  When the chicken has cooked and rested, I just simply cut it in half where the spine was."

I would suggest that you branch out a bit more into oriental cooking, using rice and eggs.  In my area, eggs are currently priced at about $0.15 each, which makes them a great value.  If, on Wednesdays (or other days), you made an egg fried rice, using say 2 eggs per adult (5 total), and skipped or used only half of a 12 ounce package of frozen vegetables, it would add protein and it is likely it would save at least a few cents.  I would also suggest that boil a few eggs for the kids for lunch.  Just have them around and available in the fridge.

Take off heat and rinse immediately with cold water. I peal them immediately, or they keep cooking.   The reason I start with hot water is to make them peel easier, I have tried all sorts of methods, but this one seems to work best.    This works for 1 or 2 eggs, I don't know if it would work the same for more?    Some people prick the fat end of the egg to stop the shell cracking. I find it works sometimes.

budgetfood,2nz5kz,sallydreams,14,Mon Dec 1 20:58:33 2014 UTC,"This is my lazy frugal soup that I throw in the slow cooker while I drink my morning coffee and its ready to eat around lunch time.  First off, everyone should always have onion, celery and carrots in your fridge at all times. Bullion cubes, broth or stock in your cabinet is also pretty standard. If you always make sure to have these basics on hand at all times (I even get the discount onions, celery and carrots at the store.  You just chop and put in the freezer until you need them.) If you have those staples you will have endless opportunities for soups.   half a box of broth/stock or one can. one cup of water boiled with a bouillon cube in it (I do this for the saltiness, or do all of it with bullion cubes adjust water accordingly. Whatever is available) 1 cup Lentils (or 1/2 cup or 3/4 cup. If you want to stretch your lentils you can reduce how much you use without taking away from the tastiness of the soup.) 3 carrot sticks chopped 1 medium onion chopped 3 or 4 stalks of celery chopped (Or a cup or more each of pre chopped mighty soup trio) Whatever veggies are about to go bad. Just add those suckers in until you are pushing them down trying to fit! Also, be open to adding sweet potato or whatever is edible and on hand that you think would make this more delicious.  Pictured: Kale, Japanese Cabbage, and broccolini.  3/4 cup of (if youre like me) whatever open jar of spaghetti sauce is open and in your fridge right now. I use spaghetti sauce instead of tomato paste simply because its cheaper per ounce. You could use a can of stewed or diced tomatoes with juice instead or if you're an over achiever and make your own add that. 1 can of your favorite beans drained or not, depending on how much liquid you like in your soup. (optional; pictured: black beans) Seasonings I use are Cheyenne pepper, parsley, minced garlic or fresh, pepper, lemon pepper, maybe throw in fresh jalapeno or three with seeds if you have it. I have a cold so I made this soup pretty spicy but usually its just got enough kick to make it interesting. You know what you like, add a tsp of each spice until it tastes the way you like it.   If in a slow cooker, it takes roughly 3hrs on high to soften the carrots. On low probably 6hrs. Otherwise just boil on stovetop until your veggies are soft enough to serve.  Makes enough for 8+. Freeze leftovers!"

budgetfood,2nz5kz,laurabythesea,6,Tue Dec 2 00:04:23 2014 UTC,"I think a whole bag of lentils is around $2. Kale is 99c for a HUGE bundle (I advise buying kale instead of lettuce. Way more versatile, lasts longer and is cheaper this time of year), celery was $1 for a bundle, an entire bag of onions is $1.99, the Japanese Cabbage and broccolini was the last of my local csa box ($35 per box). The portion of pasta sauce and broth was 70c maybe ($1.50 for whole box of broth).  If I had to guess around $3-5 for the whole pot."

It tastes exactly like what I've found in Japanese/Chinese restaurants. To prepare the rice in the first place, I boil 1 cup of dry white rice with 1 and 3/4 cups of water and some salt for 13 minutes, then fluff it and let it rest for 13 minutes. That makes twice what I need for two people, then I'll fry the leftovers like this.  Edit: Most people will want to boil 1 cup of rice with 2 cups of water. I like mine a little dryer. Also, rinse it to get the extra starch off a few times first, or it sticks to itself and makes rice paste. (Or don't rinse it, add a teaspoon of vinegar, and use the sticky rice to make ""sushi"" rolls with avocado, cucumber, and carrot.)"

budgetfood,2nz38j,Cheapfoodplease,4,Mon Dec 1 20:39:52 2014 UTC,"Made this because I purchased some red beets at a very cheap price and I was afraid they would get old.  Made enough for 3 big portions, since I only managed to finish one of the sausages on the plate.   Threw in 5 red beets in the oven for 40 minutes at 200C/392F with just a drip of oil in the bottom to make sure they'd not burn, salt and pepper. Threw 2 big onions in a frying pan at low heat and let them be there for around 30-40 mins... Threw in around 1/2dl water which translates to 0.4/.8 cups.   After that I fried my cheap ass sausages (10 S.E.K/1.3 Dollars for three sausages) and made sure to put some spices on them to add flavour. I used chili and some BBQ powder.  Lastly I threw some sauerkraut (misspelled it in the title... Damnit) in the frying pan at high heat for around 3 minutes where I had previously had the sausages, was some fat left in the pan.  A filling meal that was very cheap and relatively low on calories. If you want a higher ammount of calories, make sure to just add some extra oil to your onions, sauerkraut and red beets while cooking them.  You don't really need to use dijon mustard, it's kind of expensive... But I had it home, so why not and it tastes lovely."

budgetfood,2nwhqe,irbilldozer,2,Mon Dec 1 12:12:46 2014 UTC,"Skinny Taste is actually already covered on Pepperplate. Otherwise, so far I've copied over some recipes manually from ebook versions if cook books, used food network or Pioneer Woman, or added a simple vague recipe manually so that I remember to pick up missing ingredients. The recipes from Pioneer Woman are actually easier to follow on Pepperplate because it doesn't have a photo of each step.   For the manual ebook recipes I just open them side by side on my computer using Calibre and copy the chunk of recipe with ingredients, then copy the chunk of recipe with instructions. It automatically formats if it has numbers so that it doesn't double the number or it numbers automatically if the recipe had line breaks.   I'm only one person, so I didn't want to invest in a meal planning service and used to decide my meals on the fly. Like I said, I often had produce go bad before I used it. I had tried some free trials of meal planning services for 2 and I just wasn't interested in the recipes they had. Now I cook enough to have leftovers for lunches, but I can move around recipes on the calendar if something comes up."

If there is degradation of the food, it's not due to bacterial digestion/byproduct, it's due to regular organic decay, unless the temperature of the freezer is poorly regulated resulting in thawing and refreezing.

budgetfood,2ntiht,The_Nermal_One,2,Sun Nov 30 13:01:05 2014 UTC,"Ramen and canned veggies, both are seriously cheap. Get the ramen bricks rather than the cups, you control the (mostly too much salt) ""flavor"" packets.  Make the ramen, nuke the veggies and add them (sans juice/water) to the ramen, maybe add a little shredded cheese.   Fun fact, hard cheeses like parmesan don't have to be refrigerated. Either buy a brick (more spendy but way better flavor) or the green can stuff. Either way, store it in a zipper bag, doesn't have to be cold but dry is a good idea.  Also look for ""shelf-stable"" milk. King Soopers here carries Horizon Organic, you can find it in the dairy (refrigerator) but the small boxes are also on the shelf in ""aseptic"" boxes.

budgetfood,2ntiht,Natsukashii,3,Sun Nov 30 06:57:45 2014 UTC,But if you can get eggs from a private source that have never been refrigerated it is safe to leave them on the counter for several weeks. Unfortunately it is getting to be winter and chickens stop laying in the winter if left to their own devices. So the places where you could get fresh unwashed eggs (like farmers markers/neighbors) are probably letting their chickens rest for the winter.

budgetfood,2npx5v,herpslurp,3,Sat Nov 29 15:13:05 2014 UTC,"Parbaking:       Parbaking is a cooking technique in which a bread or dough product is partially baked and then rapidly frozen for storage.  The raw dough is baked normally, but halted at about 80% of the normal cooking time, when it is rapidly cooled and frozen. The partial cooking kills the yeast in the bread mixture, and sets the internal structure of the proteins and starches (the spongy texture of the bread), so that the inside is sterile and stable, but the loaf has not generated ""crust"" or other externally desirable qualities that are difficult to preserve once fully cooked.

I bought in bulk, scoured for deals and used my crockpot like a fiend. I would buy a whole chicken (or duck, whatever), roast it and then make soup with the leftovers and save the pan drippings to use as cooking fat. So 1 chicken can go a loooong way. Pastas are great and cheap, even cheaper if you make the pasta yourself (tastes better too). Pork shoulder is great if you can get it on sale to make some pulled pork. Just don't eat out a lot, plan your meals before going shopping and check the ads for sales."

Bulk cooking things like Chili, Quesdaillas, taco meat and Curries are staples in my freezer, along with pre cooked chicken and when you get a good deal beef cut thin, marinaded in teriyaki and frozen makes for great stir fries even with cheap cuts"

budgetfood,2np6wk,IncipioMutatio,7,Thu Dec 4 18:20:24 2014 UTC,"It partially depends on what the food prices are around your area, but $40 a week is very manageable if you don't spend too much on luxuries  or high end stuff. I manage to eat about 2 pounds of food a day on average, and about half of it tends to be meat one way or another.  Definitely bulk-buy chicken breasts and thighs when they're on sale if you can, but any kind of chicken at $2/lb or less is ideal. Bone-in thighs tend to be cheaper, so if you have the patience to cut those bones out you can save a buck or two a week, which goes a long way.  Buy a few pounds of dry beans for easy calories, bulk-buy rice every few months, and don't be afraid to spend on things like spices and herbs, which go a long way to making a bland meal interesting. If you already have a good spice cabinet, then $50/week should be a breeze.  A typical week's groceries could look like this: 5 lb boneless chicken thighs $10 2 lb dry black beans $4 2 lb onions $3 2 lb tomatoes $3 2 lb carrots $1 2 lb celery $1 2 dozen corn tortillas $1.50 5 jalapeno peppers $1 Bunch of cilantro $.50 1 dozen eggs $2 1 gallon milk $2 a few cloves of garlic $1    Comes out to $120/month on weekly stuff, and then you have $80 left over for things like    cereal (goes a long way with milk for calories) rice ($20 worth should last you a few months unless you eat it daily) flour baking soda cooking oil spices frozen vegetables (corn, green beans, broccoli, etc) cheese (those big blocks of gouda... mm) coconut milk bread crumbs bullion dry herbs    Really, the hardest part about eating on 40-50 a week is not wasting your money on things like snacks, pre-prepared food, frozen dinners, expensive cuts of meat, or things that will go bad before you finish. Go for the dirt-cheap vegetables like carrots, celery, and onions (incidentally the trio for a mirepoix), the cheap cuts of meat like chicken breasts/thighs and ground beef/pork, and the bulk grains that stretch your dollar out so you can afford to splurge on the stuff I said not to waste your money on, LOL.  If you can learn how to use your spices, herbs, and salt properly, even a dish of rice and beans can come out to be fantastic, as long as you have the patience and the knowhow."

Let that baby boil for roughly 48hrs. Turn it off and bag it up in quart sized bags or measure them out into bags how you see fit and freeze flat for easy all year storage!  Just thaw and use for soups or whatever later. :-D  *I also want to note that this can also be done with whole chicken carcasses or if you want to get beef scraps from your local butcher.

Add the frozen OJ and let it melt.  Heat it for about 10-15 minutes but don't let it boil.  The orange juice will make it bitter if it boils. Taste the cranberries to see if you need to add more sugar.  The OJ has quite a bit of sugar so you might not need extra but I added about 1/2 cup.    I keep my ginger frozen so I have it whenever I want some.  I just grate it frozen into whatever I need it in.
budgetfood,2n84up,drhalfnhalf,1 point,Mon Nov 24 02:51:36 2014 UTC,"This recipe and suggestions is so helpful.  I tried homemade cranberry sauce (same basic ingredients) last year and it was terrible.  I wasn't going to try again, but now I know just DON'T BOIL THE ORANGE JUICE.

budgetfood,2n6wjh,sirqueefsalot,5,Sun Nov 23 19:59:13 2014 UTC,"For food ruts i usually turn to ""the complete asian cookbook"" which is a giant cookbook from the 70's  with recipes organised by country of origin. I pick a country and find a recipe I can make with what we have in the cupboards.   Another option for your eggs and lunches problem could be miso rice.  Put leftover rice in a bowl with some Wakame and miso paste, add boiling water and stir so the miso dissolves, the rice softens and the wakame  rehydrates.  Only use a pinch of wakame as it rehydrates into a much bigger shape.   Miso rice could work for your husband and you depending on how soy and breastfeeding work together. I guess that you would still want to feed the baby eggs instead of miso. But that could help with the amount of eggs you eat."
budgetfood,2n6wjh,silly_squirrel,2,Sun Nov 23 21:13:57 2014 UTC,This book is outstanding. Every dish I've made from this book has been of a great quality.
budgetfood,2n6wjh,Liam892010,2,Fri Nov 28 04:17:16 2014 UTC,"It is hard to give specific advice without knowing what you've usually got in your pantry, but a few ideas, focusing on things that can be portioned out and saved for later:   Leftover rice -> Fried rice.  Fry with mixed vegetables and whatever protein you have handy. Black bean hummus.  Loads of recipes online.  You can make it without the tahini by subbing in a small amount of peanut butter. Croquettes.  These are fried balls of rice, cheese and leftover protein. Frittata - an oven-cooked omelet, can be as simple as just eggs and potatoes (aka Spanish 'tortilla', often eaten cold).  Fake pad thai.  This is a Thai peanut sauce mixed with noodles.  A recipe for it was posted here a while back and was hugely popular.  Meatloaf/meatballs.  Classic meat extender.  Add carrots, celery and onion to extend even further.  Change up the recipe by using Italian seasoning or taco seasoning.    Good luck."
budgetfood,2n6wjh,stygmata,4,Sun Nov 23 20:25:07 2014 UTC,"Fried rice is a good idea. I usually break it out for dinner when we have run out of food and I need to hit the freezer for leftover meat bits. But having it ready on hand would make for easier lunches.  As for the fake pad thai, I tried it with little fanfare. I think it is because I already have a peanut butter sauce I use (with shiitakes and pork) and my husband is spoiled."
budgetfood,2n6wjh,stygmata,3,Sun Nov 23 20:41:46 2014 UTC,"Hah, I hear that!  Also, have you tried customizing basic ramen by adding greens, mushrooms, scallions, pretty much any veg, and leftover proteins?  Use homemade stock if you can, or half a seasoning packet to cut down on sodium."
budgetfood,2n6wjh,stygmata,2,Sun Nov 23 20:46:14 2014 UTC,The custom ramen is another one I pull out when things are slim. ;) Husband doesn't seem to care for it much... but he gets to suffer. Its messy to eat. I usually do that for dinner exclusively because of steeping mushrooms and chopping veggies.  I've started buying rice sticks (rice noodles) at the asian food store. All you have to do is steep them in boiling water for about 3-5 minutes. I prefer them over ramen... tastes less like college.
budgetfood,2n6wjh,stygmata,2,Sun Nov 23 20:54:49 2014 UTC,"Wow! Well - It honestly sounds like it you're not that lacking for inspiration, but that some of the food preferences in your household may be what's holding you back.  Which is something I get.  What are some of the biggest successes with hubby?"
budgetfood,2n6wjh,stygmata,2,Sun Nov 23 20:58:47 2014 UTC,"Gordon Ramsey's Spice Sausage and Rice. That peanut butter thing I make. Cajun red beans and rice. Anything that punches you in the face with flavor I suppose. We can't make anything with a lot of heat anymore (baby). He likes curry, but I'm not a big fan. Everything he likes makes for great dinners, but not lunches. I make amazing sandwiches IF there is actual money to buy Columbus meats (there never is).  No cheese/milk/dairy except butter.  The time crunch and motivation to prep ahead of time are my biggest constraints for lunch."
budgetfood,2n6wjh,dessininja,3,Sun Nov 23 21:04:41 2014 UTC,"Heat can always be added!  A bottle of Tabasco and some curry powder can sort that out.  What about the strategy of making a roast, a whole chicken, or a ham on weekends?  Then the remainder gets turned into ham salad, chicken salad, or sliced beef.  Chicken salad can be portioned out into containers, and curry power/sauce or tabasco or chiles can be added to his portions.   I realize large proteins can be a big line-item expense."
budgetfood,2n6wjh,sew_butthurt,1 point,Sun Nov 23 21:10:03 2014 UTC,"Also, we like anything out of a wok, but that requires lots of prep. Maybe I should explore that and prep ahead of time?"

Got the chicken wings at my local Vons market for ~$7-8 for some pretty decent sized wings (not the smaller stuff). It also came with plenty of wings. I also bought the Sriracha sauce there for ~$2.   The garlic powder and onion powder can be found at Wal-Mart for ~$1. Flour is also inexpensive at Wal-Mart if you don't already have any in your pantry.  Of course, the prices vary depending on your area, and the quality of ingredients you use, but I'd say it's affordable especially for something that tastes amazing! Definitely worth a try."

Come practice and you can get it in one stroke.  Best part is that this method can be quick and silent and you won't need to use much force if you get the angle right."

budgetfood,2mz803,TerricottaPye,36,Fri Nov 21 11:59:29 2014 UTC,"I grew up eating cold burritos for school lunches since they are basically like health wraps if you put a bunch of lettuce in them.  One of my summer jobs was a furniture mover so our lunch was whatever we could eat in the truck between stops; and at $13 an hour, I wasn't going to spend $8 on a fast food lunch. Best part about burritos is they can't really get smashed like a sandwich and don't require a container/utensils like a salad.  I really like grilled chicken, lettuce, tomato, avocado, and bacon with a little roasted salsa mixed with crema (sour cream with a little salt, lime and mayo).  I'll switch it up with some carne asada and black beans instead of chicken and bacon every other day.  To make it more mediterranean just take out the beans, avocado, and salsa and then add some olives, cucumber, and feta with creamy Italian or Ceasar dressing.    You can grill up all the meat for that week's lunches on Sunday and put them in the fridge.  The night before I would assemble the burrito and put my water bottle in the freezer (3/4 full).  That way I could just throw all that into an insulated sack the next morning and it would stay cold all day.    tl;dr Any salad or sandwich can be wrapped up in a large flour tortilla that is easy to pack and eat when you don't have a kitchen at work."

When I had to pack a lunch with no way to reheat I normally made a big batch of bean salad on sunday then took some every day in a tupperware container.  Sandwiches are easy and versatile.  Wraps are a nice alternative to sandwiches.  Salad in a jar is another thing that can be made at the beginning of the week and then thrown in your bag each day.  Hummus and crackers or pita bread travels well. Nacho chips and salsa are also a nice alternative but in the same line. Edit: definitely make your own hummus though. Super easy to make and is way, WAY cheaper than buying it at the store.   You can cut up some carrots/celery at the beginning of the week and throw some in a plastic baggie each day. Makes an easy, healthy snack.  That's all I can think of at the moment but if I come up with any others I'll add an edit."

I use two big tablespoons of peanut butter, some minced cloves of garlic, some fine-chopped ginger, a few good shakes of crushed red pepper and chili powder, and splashes of soy sauce, sweet chili sauce, sesame oil, and sriracha.  Drain the noodles, add to the pan sauce, stir to coat, and add whatever veggies you have on hand. Cook til everything's cooked through and adjust seasonings to your taste.

It's tremendously filling.  But you can tailor it to your hunger needs: double on the bread layers and amount of filling, or just slice it in half and eating each portion at different snack times.  It's slightly versatile in that you can substitute the jelly for honey and add banana slices.  Not to mention mixing up the jelly flavors.    Peanut allergy?  A quick google search yields many yummy peanut butter alternatives.  It does not need to be refrigerated which is a super extra plus for those that have to go to work sites or does not have a refrigerator at work.

Some people add flavors too it in the blender but I think flavor is what the other food I have is for lol. I really ended up liking it.

Another simple one you can vary up with spices:   Rice or Quinoa (pick one) Frozen Veggies Sliced up Chicken, Ground Beef, or other protein   Fry up the protein, in garlic & onion if you're ""adventurous"".  Once it's pretty close to done, toss in the frozen veggies straight from frozen.  Fry up until it's all done.  Cook the rice in a rice cooker/pot on the side while doing all of this, and combine everything in the pan, and container it out.  So easy, and you can change up the spices however you like.  I personally like to season the meat & veggies while they are cooking with creole seasoning, or cayenne & chili flakes, but whatever works for you.  I call it my ""Student Mix"", because it's so basic, cheap & easy, I made it all the time in university."

They can be cheap, simple, and even healthy too (although unhealthy recipes abound).  Probably the simplest one I know is salsa chicken... you literally just throw some chicken breasts in with a jar of salsa, and when it's done cooking the chicken will shred easily with a fork.  Now you've got awesome chicken you can stick in burritos, tacos, eat over rice, etc.  You can also buy yourself a thermos to bring things like hot soup, pack sandwiches with fruit or veggies for a side, salads, etc."

The process as demonstrated in this video   http://youtu.be/nTcLbA1rEZE  Is quite quick although the video is overly long.
budgetfood,2mxbah,blumpkin,6,Fri Nov 21 05:51:57 2014 UTC,Is it cheaper? I'm paying 3$/lb for butter on sale and a quart of heavy cream easily costs that. How much cream is required for a pound of butter?
budgetfood,2mxbah,oneonetwooneonetwo,4,Thu Nov 20 23:45:21 2014 UTC,"I tried it once. It was not cheaper, nor did it taste noticeably better than storebought butter. And it is a real pain in the ass to do it by hand. I personally won't be trying it again."
budgetfood,2mxbah,blumpkin,1 point,Fri Nov 21 01:25:14 2014 UTC,It's a cool thing to try but you're definitely not exploiting an angle the shops have missed.  It's good for using up cream you've not got round to using. It's better to have a little bit of butter and some buttermilk than half a pot of spoiled cream.

Yeah, pretty much, I would do it to use cream that was otherwise going to go in the trash I guess, or more likely just plan a dinner that requires cream to make. The problem is that butter made this way doesn't get nearly as firm as storebought butter, and due to that extra moisture, its shelflife is much shorter than the regular stuff. I think you get about 10 days max out of homemade butter. This makes me wonder though, can you freeze cream? Or will it split or something?"

budgetfood,2mxbah,dicey,3,Fri Nov 21 08:22:38 2014 UTC,"Having read this report from the USDA, it looks like butter and other fats and oils will come down in price again. There is a much higher demand from India and China which seems to be driving prices up due to exports. I don't eat red meat, but it looks like you should be much more worried about meat prices considering climate issues. Making butter at home really isn't that difficult, so you could give it a try, as some people have suggested here. Also, use ghee. It's clarified butter and lasts longer and has a higher burning point.   Edit: I also save all of my cooking fats... duck, chicken, goose.... they keep for ages in a kilner jar in the refrigerator and are perfect for cooking potatoes, vegetables, and other things in the oven. Butter prices are pretty high, as is most food in the UK, compared to America. The butter I bought tonight cost $3.43.

Costco or Sams club would be cheapest ($5-$6). Take wings and drumsticks off and eat that immediately (as sides in a meal I'm preparing that day). Then completely tear the chicken apart into strips and pieces and put them in ziploc bags or Tupperware. This will be about 1-1.5lbs of meat. I would use this throughout the week.

I often don't even cook it quite that long- I'll cut about 10 minutes off the time, pull out the bird and check the temp to see if it's within 10°F of 165°F, and if it is I just tent it with foil and let it sit on the top of the stove to carryover cook while I finish up all the sides."

budgetfood,2mqgd4,oxnerdki,32,Wed Nov 19 13:09:51 2014 UTC,"Pho, maybe. Boiling those bones is a messy, time-consuming pain in the ass. The problem with prepackaged is that the absolutely cheapest ingredients possible are going to go into the meal; so cheap, in fact, that you may not even be eating what the packaging suggests. The same is pretty much true for restaurants, unless you are going upscale. Casher7 has a point with the chickens, though. I think I read that grocery stores use them as loss leaders to get you in the door. Though we're talking about hormoned-up, brutally tortured corporate chickens, I'm assuming."

budgetfood,2mqgd4,natstrap,11,Wed Nov 19 05:39:33 2014 UTC,"It depends entirely on what you put on it, but if you keep it basic, yeah, you can. I used to make my own sandwiches all the time (actual subs, not just a sandwich with two slices of bread). From my own experiences, it wasn't difficult at all to bring costs below that of Subway, however, I was making sandwiches for the entire week in order to do so.   You'll find that you can't really get the slices of meat in small-enough packs for just one or two sandwiches, and with veggies and fruits, you simply can't purchase small-enough quantities for only one or two sandwiches. For myself, a single bell pepper was enough for three sandwiches, one large onion was enough for an entire week, while a package of meat was enough for four to six sandwiches.   Lettuce, spinach, and field greens were a different story entirely. A single bag of Spring Mix was more than a dozen sandwiches; I usually ate half of the greens mix as a salad and half used for six or eight sandwiches. Doing anything less and the mix would go to waste.  Even shopping at Wegman's (a higher-end grocer), six sandwiches (with fruits, veggies, and greens to spare) could be done for $4 / 10-inch sandwich. Shopping at Walmart or Shopper's would probably bring it down to the $2-3 range, especially if you went with the store-brand goods.  Edit :: I'll add that you can't load up on any one particular ingredient for this to actually become a better price. If you really like to pile up the meat or cheese, you're going to be looking at $6 / 10-inch very quickly, and if you enjoy a lot of both, you're quickly hitting $8 per sandwich."
budgetfood,2mqgd4,NoNeedForAName,4,Wed Nov 19 05:30:39 2014 UTC,What about roasting a chicken or a turkey instead of buying deli meat? Getting a 4 lb chicken for $5-6 would be enough meat for a weeks worth of hilariously meaty sandwiches.

For around $6 you can get a weeks worth of sandwiches.  I'm not picky on vegies so I would just use whatever I had left over from making dinner.

Once you start piling on veggies it really depends on what veggies you like and whether or not you'll finish the leftovers before they go bad. And cheese can get expensive, too, depending on what kind you use.  And in my experience cheap store-bought meatballs taste like shit, and it's rarely worth it to make your own.  But then something like a chicken teriyaki might be cheaper to make on your own. Chicken and teriyaki are both cheap and easy, and IIRC the chicken teriyaki isn't a $5 footlong.  So I think your answer is, ""It depends."""
budgetfood,2mqgd4,morechatter,6,Wed Nov 19 21:15:43 2014 UTC,"it's rarely worth it to make your own.   I'm wondering what makes you say that! I actually tried making my own meatballs to go with some pasta the other day and found that I could get something like 20 meatballs from a pound of ground beef and some breadcrumbs, that all turned out fantastic.   I'm wondering how the math works out in the end, but I'm pretty sure that the savings could be worth the trouble-- $1.50 for maybe six meatballs and $2.50 for a handful of spinach (~$.30), half a tomato (~$.50), a bit of onion ($.20), a third of a bell pepper (~.$.40), some jalapeno slices (~$.30), and 1/2 a cup of shredded cheese (~$.80) doesn't seem unreasonable, if the bread is $1 or less."

But my sandwiches are really, really freakin' good.  I think I'll go home and have a couple of sandwiches for dinner. EDIT:  Update from last night.  Made a sandwich.  It was delicious. Olive oiled one side of two pieces of Dave's Killer Blues Bread.  Broiled for a few minutes. While bread is being imbued with toasty goodness, use a mandolin to slice a lemon, about 1/8"" thick.  You'll need four slices.  Also cut pickles into spears. Remove bread, leave broiler running. Apply ham to bread.  (~7oz) Apply two slices of habanero pepperjack to ham. Apply a handful of feta to pepperjack. Apply bottom half of sandwich to broiler. While cheesing goodness is happening, slather untoasted side of remaining bread in mayo. Eat a pickle. Eat another pickle. Remove bottom half of sandwich from broiler once cheese is browned.  Top evenly with lemon slices, dust lightly with chili powder, then apply bread to that.  Cut sandwich in half in order to properly admire the crossection of lemony-cheese-meat sexiness. Apply sandwich to facemouth."

If you cook 8 portions but 3 or 4 portions end up in the garbage, then the food waste is also a considerable financial waste.  That and don't forget health costs.

budgetfood,2mqgd4,ionsquare,3,Thu Nov 20 01:04:16 2014 UTC,"There are a lot of things I rarely eat anymore because it's not really worth the time to me.  I made chicken burritos the other day.. first time in months. They used to be a staple, but now my work schedule isn't so consistent, and I just can't plan for cooking a meal that takes me over an hour to make. (mostly because the chicken takes at least 45 mins to cook from frozen, and doesn't keep once thawed for any real amount of time)  Meatloaf. I don't really like it to start with, but it's my bf's favorite at this point, so I used to make it at least once a month. Beef's gotten expensive unless I go super-low-quality which makes both of us nauseous. I started buying bread crumbs instead of crumbing bread myself because it's almost the same price and so much less effort... but the loaf itself still takes an hour to bake after spending 20 minutes working seasonings and bread crumbs into cold ground beef. If beef prices went back down, I'd start doing that again. As is though? Chicken is cheaper and easier.  Unless I'm trying to impress someone with my baking skills, I don't really make pies from scratch. Exceptions are meringues. Those do not freeze well, and frozen meringue pies taste like plastic. Pumpkin, apple, cherry, and chocolate pies taste just fine from the freezer section, and all you do is leave them on the counter overnight to thaw.   Taco seasoning. Yeah, it's simple: cumin, chili powder, corn starch, salt. I don't use cumin or chili powder for anything else though... and buying them costs about as much as buying a bulk jar of taco seasoning, for like, half the volume. And it lasts for fucking ever."

I'm fortunate to live near a great fish market that sells prepared sushi-grade fish for a reasonable price.  If you can find that, you're golden.  I've been making probably about $60 worth of good sushi for about $18 at a time using this fish.  It's very satisfying putting a slice of sashimi on some sushi rice and then knowing I'm NOT paying $4 for that particular piece.  Also, fun fact: that delicious spicy mayo they drizzle on top of maki sometimes is just mayo mixed with some sriracha"
budgetfood,2mqgd4,ToiletSpiders,3,Wed Nov 19 23:47:35 2014 UTC,"That $60-for-$18 ratio has really caught my attention. I never gave homemade sushi much thought (just always assumed it'd be equally expensive) but I'll definitely look into trying it soon.  Are there any critical mistakes I should avoid? I don't have a fish market near me, so would it be okay to use supermarket fish or would it be unsafe? I'm not sure how to distinguish between regular fish and sushi-grade fish.  Also, I'm not a huge stickler for quality, so I wouldn't mind going the frozen route if it's just as cheap (or even cheaper). Do you know anything about that?"
budgetfood,2mqgd4,esgresh,2,Wed Nov 19 07:17:28 2014 UTC,"I'm actually not usually a fan of fish, so the quality probably makes a big difference here.  You want to find a block of fish that looks something like this, which is what you slice up to make the sushi.  I usually get one of tuna, one of salmon, each for around $7 at my market.  The extra stuff is pretty cheap.  Sushi rice is just rice, vinegar and a little sugar.  The seaweed is about $2 for a pack of 10 (I usually use about 3 per meal for two), and then I also fill them with cucumber and japanese omelet (tamago sushi: just egg, soy sauce and a tiny bit of sugar in mine).  So given all that, the fish is the most expensive part by far.  Just keep in mind, as I said, that a slice of that fish and a little handful of rice would go for $3-4 each, and you're making a lot of them.  If you buy a sushi mat (they can be $1-2, don't get any that go for more than that), then you can make your own sushi rolls (maki), which again would be something like $6-8 each depending on what you put in them.  Give it a go, you'll never want to get restaurant sushi again!"

budgetfood,2moi0j,Vaughnicorn,3,Tue Nov 18 22:05:05 2014 UTC,"I'm in a similar position this month. Garlic and chilli can hide a bland meal, cumin if you already have some to hand.   Pasta, garlic, chilli or cumin is a nice base. If you have enough money for any legumes like chick peas or beans, you'll have a filling meal."

Not sure where you are located so I cant speak on cost of ingredients BUT if you get chicken, beef or pork and some veggies and flour you can make stir fry, Pasta with chicken or pork or sausage, pizza or flatbread and you can even make a few tortillas and get a head of lettuce and whip up a wrap with leftover stirfry"

You don't have to chop them up super fine because they're going to get blended up in a bit. Add in about 1/5-1/4 of the frozen corn. Dice the potatos, you don't have to remove the skin if you don't want to, just scrub them well. Add the diced potatoes and all of the vegetable broth. Season with paprika, cayenne, salt, pepper, and cumin and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat and cook until potatoes are fork tender. Allow mixture to cool slightly and then blend using either an immersion blender or working in batches in a traditional blender. Return to pot over low to medium low heat and add most of the remaining corn (save only what you want for a small garnish). Add the cup of almond milk. Heat over low heat for about 20 minutes or until heated through. Serve topped with additional corn, diced bell pepper (the other half of the one you didn't use) , and sliced green onions.   You can definitely use peppers other than fresno like jalapeno or poblano, I just liked them cause they were red and they were $1.49/lb. They have a very good flavor. Also, you can almost definitely find a pound of corn cheaper than $2, I've gotten them as cheap as $.69. You can also used fresh or canned corn if you like. You could also swap out the almond milk for soy or even regular milk."

budgetfood,2mg9t2,saddetective87,4,Sun Nov 16 07:55:06 2014 UTC,I make coddle durring the winter and it is super easy.  I usually buy thick cut bacon because rashers are impossible to come by in the US.  For a while i would just throw all ingredients in a pot and boil it for an hour but i found another recipe that was a bit better.  I boil the sausage and bacon first to make the broth then fry them a bit to make them crispy before putting everything in a dutch oven to bake.  It is the ultimate fatty addicting comfort food.
budgetfood,2mg9t2,Electro_Sapien,2,Sun Nov 16 17:21:18 2014 UTC,I'd be forever grateful if you could post your coddle recipe. There's a local place that makes coddle and I've always wondered if there was an easy way to make some at home.
budgetfood,2mg9t2,spirit_spine,2,Mon Nov 24 11:47:02 2014 UTC,"1 pound of extra thick cut bacon  1 pound of sausage links  1 large onion  5 - 6 potatoes depending on size  2 carrots  1tbsp fresh chopped parsley  Chop the bacon and sausage into small pieces and place in a frying pan to brown.  Transfer sausage, bacon, and grease to stock pot.  Add about a quart of water (simmer some water in the frying pan to get all the cooked bits off and add that to the stock).  Simmer bacon and sausage to make stock, I usually simmer/boil them for a half an hour to an hour depending on how rich the stock is looking.  Chop potatoes into large chunks, slice carrots, and loosely chop up onion.  Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Place potatoes, carrots, and onion into dutch oven, add bacon and sausage and mix together.  Fill dutch oven about 3/4 of the way to the top of the vegetables and meat with stock.  Place dutch oven with top on in the middle of the oven, cook for 40 minutes.  Check to make sure it isn't drying out, stir and add water as necessary to bring stock back up to original level.  Turn oven down to 350 and cook for 30 minutes.  Remove dutch oven and let sit for a few minutes.  Sprinkle finely chopped parsley over the coddle and serve with thick sliced bread or soda bread.      The recipe can easily be adjusted next time, often coddle isn't precise so you can always add more potatoes or more meat.  I don't keep exact measurements when I make it I just kinda throw everything together until it looks right.  Some recipes just have you boil everything but I prefer frying the bacon and sausage to make it crispy.  You could easily just add everything together in the dutch oven, add water nearly to the top of the contents and put in the oven for the same amount of time or boil it on the stove for a good hour but I prefer making the stock and baking the coddle."

With the vegetables, make sure you get them all in the bottom of the pot. You could see in my original submission I had some stacked around the chicken. Those weren't as yummy as the ones down in the chicken juice. Also, when you take them out, I would season them with garlic powder and pepper.   I would make this again."

budgetfood,2mer31,sirvesa,18,Sat Nov 15 21:57:36 2014 UTC,"I agree on finding a food bank or church and getting help.    My advise on food would be to get beans, rice, lentils, and find large bags of potatoes on sale. Stock up on those as your basics.   Canned tomatoes, and bags of frozen vegetables (green beans, peppers and onions, etc).  Plain oatmeal, bananas, eggs.  If you have money left over, buy protein (chicken legs or thighs, ground beef).   Things would be easier if you have basic spices in your cabinet.  Bananas and oatmeal are for breakfast. You can cook oatmeal with a little milk if you have it.   Make variations of tomato bean stew with rice. Lentil soup with black pepper and/or turmeric.  Cut potatoes into cubes, roast them and cook them with eggs.  Boil the chicken, use the cooked chicken and make rice and chicken. Boil the bones a bit more to get a thick stock and use the stock in the aforementioned stews and soups.  Feel free to add frozen vegetables to each stew or soup you make. Cook potatoes stuffed with some ground beef and tomato sauce (bake potatoes, slice them down the middle and stuff them)."

budgetfood,2mer31,Sedela,7,Sun Nov 16 00:15:03 2014 UTC,"Check the ethnic grocery stores for rice and beans. They're usually very cheap there. They also occasionally have good deals on vegetables and meat. Pork shoulder is inexpensive, and there are plenty of recipes for preparing it in a crock pot. Add some spices, and you've got carnitas for several days. Check the bulk aisles at the supermarket. Oats, dried fruit and flour are cheap there, and you can use the first two for an easy hot breakfast. Herbs and spices are also cheap there, and those are the key to making inexpensive food interesting. Dollar stores are also good for prepared items, and herbs/spices.   Like the others, I'll also recommend food banks. Use them if you need to, and donate to them later. That's what they're there for."

budgetfood,2mer31,triviaqueen,10,Sat Nov 15 22:56:09 2014 UTC,my first thought is rice + beans + a whole chicken (rotisserie) or pork shoulder that you can cook and cut up and reuse for a few different meals.

budgetfood,2mer31,teccomb,3,Sat Nov 15 23:32:48 2014 UTC,I'd stay away from meat and go with beans and eggs.  Produce can be really cheap at discount farmers markets (as opposed to trendy ones). Get some flour and yeast to make a cheap and easy no knead bread.  They are dense and go great with winter squash soups which are cheap to make this time of year.  Beans and rice are cheap at International markets.  They also might have some inspiration for traditional dishes from some poorer parts of the world.  You can make tortillas and flat bread to add character to beans and rice.  Black Bean soft tacos.  Hummus flat bread sandwiches.  Pumpkin and black bean burgers.  Fried Rice with egg drop soup.  Roasted veggie spaghetti is a good way to use lower quality produce.  Red beans and rice.  Lentil loaf and roasted carrots.  Chick pea curry with broccoli pakoras. Chili and corn bread.  Embrace pbj. Crust less quiche and fritattas. When looking at recipes be willing to substitute like crazy.  Stick to what you've got on hand it will turn out good enough.   Sometimes when things get hairy here I'll make a nutritious meal just for the 3 and 5 year old. For adults I'll serve kicked up ramen such as beef ramen with peach habenero and lemon Balm or whatever else is in the garden.  That fills us then we eat their left overs.  Good luck to you!
budgetfood,2mer31,chrisbluemonkey,3,Sun Nov 16 00:32:52 2014 UTC,"If you have basic staple items (rice, beans, oatmeal, noodles, etc.) it makes it a lot easier. The cheapest way (although not always the most exciting way) is to cook based on the sale items in your flyer. If you were willing to share your local flyer or what items are on sale and what you already have, I wouldn't mind making a mock meal plan. If not, there are websites that you can search for recipes by the ingrediants you have.  Look up coupons, but only use them on items you would actually buy. Look in the discount sections of the store, this is especially good for items you can freeze, like meat and bread.   I've seen a lot of food blogs lately do SNAP challenges and try to live on $25/week for food. That might be a good place to look for some recipe ideas."
budgetfood,2mer31,meeooooooww,2,Wed Nov 19 04:21:42 2014 UTC,"Pretty close to my usual grocery budget for the same size of family, it's doable if your kitchen is decently stocked. That said, I'm not sure what grocery prices are where you live - I'm in western Canada so I think my prices are probably a lot more than if you're in some places in the states but I'm not positive.   A bit over $100 but hopefully it gives you a general idea (and hopefully groceries are cheaper where you live) This week I bought: 1lb Bacon $4 Pork tenderloin $11 4 Chicken breasts $13 Farmer sausage $10 Frozen Perogies $4 24 Italian sausages $22  Puff pastry $2 2 boxes triscuits $4 800g cheddar cheese $9 2 boxes granola bars $3 Cereal $3 4L milk $5 Dozen eggs $3 1lb butter $4 1 loaf bread $1.75 Peanut butter $4 Apples $3 Yogurt $3 2x Jello powder $1   The bacon and pork tenderloin were enough to make 4 bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin, so that's 4 dinners.  The chicken breasts, a bit of of the puff pastry, plus some milk and chicken bullion made 2 chicken pot pies for 2 more dinners.  Farmers sausage was separated in to three packs, each with part of the bag of Perogies is another dinner for 3 more dinners.  12 of the Italian sausages are separated in to 4 packs to be dinners with rice or pasta we already have for 4 more dinners.  The last night I use the remainder of the bacon (about half a pound), some bread, and eggs to have bacon and fried egg sandwiches.  Each dinner is served with rice, pasta, or potatoes plus veggies. I already have all of those so don't include them in my budget, though, which doesn't help you unless you've got a bit or could do a food bank to get some basics and then supplement with your $100.    I use the other 12 sausages and the puff pastry to make 10 2-packs of sausage rolls to freeze - those are my husband's lunches for work.  Kids and I have leftovers, peanut butter and jam sandwiches, or triscuits with melted cheese plus snacks (yogurt, fruits and vegetables canned over the summer).  For snacks and add-ons to lunch I use the butter, eggs, peanut butter, and flour &amp; sugar that I already have to make cookies. Plus the granola bars, fruit, and jell-o.   Breakfasts are milk &amp; cereal, yogurt, or oatmeal (which I already have).   I also can and freeze a ton in the summer so I don't buy things like fresh vegetables, most fresh fruits, or jams. So unfortunately my budget doesn't include those (or the basics that I already mentioned). But hopefully it gives you some ideas.   It's not super exciting if it's what you're doing for just a couple of weeks (since obviously this meal plan is a lot of repeats) but if you can gradually freeze the limited selection of meals you'll have lots of variety in your freezer and eventually build up so that rough weeks you don't have to buy more than milk and bread."
budgetfood,2mer31,xlastnameleft,2,Sun Nov 16 18:02:55 2014 UTC,"To give the kids somethink nice to snack on you can make shortcake. Thats just flour butter and sugar, so you can make a lot very cheaply."
budgetfood,2mer31,sayleanenlarge,2,Sun Nov 16 00:40:42 2014 UTC,"If you want meat,buy a bag of frozen boneless skinless chicken breast fillets. Depending on where you live and the availability of discount grocery stores, they cost ~$6-10 for a decently big bag--they're an easy way to improve a meal that would otherwise be lacking. Soups, sandwiches, and pastas are probably the cheapest and most filling things you can make. e.g., some canned or boxed tamato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches, spaghetto, etc.  Starches and grains are really filling. Make sure your meals have something like potato, rice, pasta, etc. You could easily make pasta like gnoccni. Spice up rice with frozen veggies and eggs, maybe add some diced chicken.

Carby, but delicious and very filling.  I usually add some poultry seasoning to the gravy since I don't have all the bay leaves n things.

budgetfood,2mchyu,alkali_h20,2,Sat Nov 15 05:19:15 2014 UTC,"Coming from a background in food service management, I prefer plastic because wood tends to harbor more bacteria and are harder to keep sanitary. I also like that plastic is dishwasher safe. To each their own, though."
budgetfood,2mchyu,redneckJesus,6,Sat Nov 15 05:37:11 2014 UTC,"Thats outdated information, wood absorbs and kills that bacteria but plastic (particularly if its stored damp) provides a much better growing environment."
budgetfood,2mchyu,Bluecollar_gent,6,Sat Nov 15 11:52:46 2014 UTC,"Actually, wood cutting boards help with reducing bacteria, not plastic. Although, being able to wash a plastic cutting board in a dishwasher is more convenient than taking proper care of wooden cutting board."
budgetfood,2mchyu,renational,5,Sat Nov 15 06:19:40 2014 UTC,"This isn't actually a conclusive statement.  As with most research, the answer may be far more complicated.    Specifically, they couldn't ""isolate"" the bacteria from wooden boards.  This could easily mean the bacteria move into the pores where they spread and grow.  This could allow the wooden board to shed bacteria for over time.  Plastic boards on the other hand do not allow bacteria to migrate inside, thus allowing them to be isolated but also washed in a dishwasher.   Personally, I would use a wooden board for produce that gets wiped down, but a plastic board for meats followed by a dishwashing.  I would do this at least until long term use studies are produced."
budgetfood,2mchyu,syr_ark,1 point,Sat Nov 15 16:17:21 2014 UTC,"This. A study done in 1992 that has been questioned in it's methodology is not going to convince me that a porous surface is not going to hold bacteria better than a non-porous surface. In order to really test that, you'd need to not only test the surface level bacteria after washing but over time and you'd need to actually crack the board open and see what was inside in the pores. If other Redditors prefer wood for their purposes, great, but I wish people wouldn't assume that there's only one right way to do something or you're WRONG."
budgetfood,2mchyu,lethaltech,1 point,Sat Nov 15 21:14:19 2014 UTC,"It's preference at this point but your statement that wood ""harbors"" bacteria is false. It is true that wooden boards can hold bacteria, but wooden boards do not transfer (cross contaminate) the bacteria as readily and when the board dries the bacteria dies.   Wood does not kill off bacteria and/or pathogens. It absorbs them. The bugs, bacteria, and nasties are sucked into the first millimeter or so of the wood and are trapped there. They generally live a couple of hours. How you feel about this is up to you. Technically, these bacteria are still there. That means that they are still a threat—in theory—to any foods placed on the cutting board. In practice they do not transfer to knife edges or cross-contaminate other foods because the board will not let go of them. They stay trapped in the wood and die as the board dries.  So what about plastic and poly cutting boards? New plastic boards are easy to clean and sanitize. Bacteria don’t penetrate the surface and can be washed away easily. The problem comes when the cutting board becomes scarred (which happens much more quickly than with wood boards). Knife scars on plastic boards are not clean incisions. The cuts fracture, creating a microscopic web of fissures below the surface which provide a safe harbor for bacteria. It gets more and more difficult to remove the pathogens through hand washing. A plastic or poly board can go through the dishwasher, which is verboten for wood cutting boards, but that becomes less effective as the cutting board becomes more scuffed and scarred. When a plastic board becomes scraggly enough to snag your dishcloth when you wash it, throw it out.   Source:  Best advice. Use both kinds, but dispose of your plastic boards sooner than your wooden boards?"

budgetfood,2mb9uv,crocs_and_jorts,19,Sat Nov 15 19:17:34 2014 UTC,"Carnitas!  4-6 pounds boneless pork butt  2 large onions  4 garlic cloves  1 tablespoon ground cumin  1 tablespoon ground coriander  1 tablespoon ground oregano  ***1 can of chipotle en adobo sauce  2 bay leaves  48 ounces chicken broth  1 cup of orange juice (no pulp)  1 tablespoon salt (a little less if 4-pound pork butt)  2-3 tablespoons olive oil  Cut one onion into big chunks and dice up the garlic. Cut the pork butt into 2-inch chunks. Place pork butt, garlic, onion, coriander, cumin, oregano, bay leaves and salt in a big pot. Add the chipotle peppers with adobo sauce. Add the chicken broth and OJ; it should cover the pork butt, but if it doesn't add some more OJ. Bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and simmer uncovered for 3-5 hours, or until most of the liquid has cooked away. Stir it every now and then and shred the meat as it gets tender. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Transfer the meat from the pot to a baking sheet and drizzle the oil over it; toss to coat the meat. Roast for about 10 to 15 minutes or until the meat starts to get crispy. While it's roasting, cut up the second onion and saute in some olive oil.  After the meat is done roasting and the onion is done being sauteed, serve on flour tortillas. Other ingredients can be added as preference  dictates. If you prefer, you can serve with fresh guacamole or even pico de gallo (which is my favorite for carnitas). This dish is very good with regular pico de gallo, but in my opinion, it's fantastic with pineapple pico de gallo.  *** Adding a whole can of chipotle peppers en adobo sauce will make your carnitas VERY spicy. For milder carnitas, only add 4-5 peppers and  the adobo sauce from the can. For medium spice, add 6 or 7 peppers and the sauce from the can. It also depends on the weight of the pork. If you only have 4 pounds of meat, 3 or 4 peppers will be fine for milder carnitas, with 5 or 6 peppers for medium spice, and the whole can for VERY spicy carnitas.  Once you get down to about 1-1/2 to 2 pounds of carnitas left, it makes an amazing pork chili (see below).  Leftover Carnitas Chili  Base:  Leftover Carnitas meat (2 pounds or so)  1 onion  2-4 cloves of garlic  1 bell pepper  3 stalks of celery  2 or 3 already-cooked ears of corn (optional)  Three 15-ounce cans diced tomatoes*  Two 15-ounce cans tomato sauce*  1 can diced green chiles  one 15-ounce can of dark red kidney beans  one 15-ounce can black beans  Brown sugar  Seasoning:  2 tablespoons all-purpose flour  2 teaspoons granulated sugar  1 tablespoon garlic powder  1 tablespoon red pepper  2 teaspoons ground cumin  4 teaspoons chili powder  1 tablespoon onion powder  1 teaspoon dried basil  Put all the ingredients for the seasoning into a baggy and shake until well mixed. Set aside for later. Take the leftover carnitas and heat over medium-low heat in a large pot. While it's heating up, take the ears of corn and use a knife to remove the corn kernels from the ears. Chop the onion, garlic, bell pepper and celery and add to the carnitas meat. Cook until the veggies are soft. Add the diced tomatoes (with the liquid),  tomato sauce, diced green chiles, and cans of beans (drained and rinsed). Stir well. Add the seasoning mix, along with some salt and pepper to taste.  Add a couple of pinches of brown sugar to cut the tomato acid a bit. Cook for at least 2 hours, more if able, over medium-low heat. The longer it cooks, the better. Stir every 15-30 minutes, making sure it doesn't stick to the bottom. If it does, scrape the bottom and mix the carmelized tomato sauce into the chili (it's pretty tasty when that happens). However, be very careful not to let it burn on the bottom (not tasty at all).  Serve with toppings as desired, such as cheddar cheese, sour cream, crackers, etc. You can also serve it over rice or over Frito's and topped with cheddar cheese for a delicious Frito pie.  *The amount of diced tomatoes and tomato sauce depends on how much carnitas meat you are using. Add until you think it's sufficient. I recommend buying some extra in case you need more. (Some inspiration was taken from Tyler Capp's 2 a.m. Chili.)"

I usually rub it with a fairly basic rub (like Memphis Dust or just Cajun seasoning and some brown sugar) and cover it with foil until the last 2 or 3 hours.  But that also depends on the cost of brisket in your area. It's very affordable where I am in Texas, but when I lived in California, it definitely wasn't.  You could also bake a large ham, which you can serve for almost every meal and use as a base for a lot of simple and cheap dishes. Fried ham and eggs for breakfast, black beans and ham, or a very basic jambalaya if you add some sausage."

budgetfood,2mb9uv,strixaluco,1 point,Fri Nov 14 22:04:29 2014 UTC,"Does the meat get warm enough at 250?

budgetfood,2m89h6,PatatasFritatas,52,Thu Nov 13 23:21:32 2014 UTC,"I appreciate the thought. BUT, storing your spices right above the stove like that is a bad idea. Ideally, spices should be stored away from heat sources and in dark place to best preserve their flavor.  Additionally, I would not want to reach over a hot stove to get to my spices. Besides the obvious safety risks, I think it's pretty much a guarantee that I would accidentally drop a bottle into a pot or pan eventually."
budgetfood,2m89h6,sanderwarc,14,Fri Nov 14 00:49:50 2014 UTC,Also the oil and grime from the stove will get into those hangers.
budgetfood,2m89h6,adudeinblue,3,Fri Nov 14 03:07:36 2014 UTC,So it's not very good to have a spice rack that sits out on the counter? Just curious.
budgetfood,2m89h6,LuxieLisbon,4,Fri Nov 14 04:54:01 2014 UTC,"Ideally, no. Light contributes to the degradation spices.  You're also only supposed to buy enough ground spices to last 3-6 months and enough whole spices to last one year, for maximum potency. But I don't know anyone, myself included, that actually follows that guideline."
budgetfood,2m89h6,sanderwarc,11,Fri Nov 14 13:29:02 2014 UTC,I grew up in a super small kitchen and we always kept the big jugs of spices on the back of the stove directly with no problems other than sometimes the moisture from cooking would gunk up the garlic powder. I guess it's just what I'm used to so keeping them suspended behind the stove doesn't really bother me and it's what works best for my small kitchen now since that was space just being unused. I also usually cook one pot meals though so it might be a different story if someone regularly has all four burners going.

I mix a can of rinsed black beans and a can of corn in after it's done. I put sour cream on top because it cuts how spicy I like it (I use Tofutti bc I'm vegan.) Eat with tortilla chips if you like.

budgetfood,2m5hy1,Shaydie,2,Thu Nov 13 14:22:10 2014 UTC,"You can do a really simple jambalaya in a rice cooker.

Add some sliced kielbasa, a can of diced tomatoes, a small onion diced, garlic minced, and bell peppers/chilies if you have them.  Season with creole seasoning and smoked paprika and let it cook.  Since the kielbasa is already cooked, once the rice is done it's ready to eat and tastes even better the next day.  You can garnish with spring onions if you're feeling fancy (pro tip: have a small herb garden with at least green onions and basil) and add some Louisiana style hot sauce to give it some kick.  The reason I'm not suggesting andouille sausage and chicken is because it's more expensive and you have to make sure it is cooked all the way through.  You could add shrimp, but then it won't last as long in the fridge (2 days vs 1 week)."

In Australia, the main result I found was a huge conglomeration of CSAs around Brisbane but, with such a large network in one place I'd be surprised if there weren't other CSAs in your states/territories; again, trying googling your state+""comunity-supported agriculture"". for the UK, you can try here and for France, here   Also, if you look for a CSA, make sure to check areas outside your immediate vicinity: besides pick-up at the farm, a lot of CSAs will allow you to pick up your share at local farmer's markets (assuming they're going there anyway), and many (at least in the US) have pick-up points 30-90 minutes out from the farm."
budgetfood,2m3za3,AzureMagelet,2,Thu Nov 13 02:05:43 2014 UTC,Yup! We have a few CSAs around here that actually do neighborhood drops. They just set up certain days of the week where they will do drop offs to your neighborhood. It's awesome.

Replace tahini with peanut butter, and garlic with garlic powder, and lemon juice with some vinegar or anything acidic really if you're a cheapass.  Peanut butter: can be cheaper to make if you keep an eye on prices and if you prefer the 'natural' stuff. Just put peanuts in a food processor (no shells). Same goes for any nut butter.  Bread: flour, water, yeast, salt. /r/breadit or /r/sourdough if you don't even want to buy yeast. If you go with natural levain (i.e., sourdough) then a loaf can cost you as little as 20 cents."

budgetfood,2m14x1,somethink_different,1 point,Wed Nov 12 19:00:17 2014 UTC,I think the trick is in how much salt to use during the soaking/cooking.  If you salt them from the start(soaking) it makes the outer layer harder and when blended leads to that grainy mouthfeel.
budgetfood,2m14x1,iamdelf,13,Wed Nov 12 21:09:38 2014 UTC,"Peanut butter (or any nut butter) is literally just putting nuts in a food processor or blender and pulverizing it.  Butter is easy if you happen to have a Kitchenaid mixer. You just throw heavy cream in the bowl, turn it on with the paddle attachment and wait. Then just knead out all the watery stuff (keep it! It's buttermilk, which is awesome for pancakes and such) and boom, you've got butter.  Check out this book. It has mayonnaise, sour cream, ketchup, cheese, and a bunch of other awesome stuff."
budgetfood,2m14x1,elevader,14,Wed Nov 12 03:09:45 2014 UTC,"I think that unless you find cream on cheap, it's more expensive than buying an equivalent amount of butter. Is this true? (Assuming OP is asking for money saving purposes.)   Also, question! I tried throwing a bunch of sunflower seeds in a food processor. (Salted, can't remember if roasted or not.) They turned into a coarse meal but didn't grind up any smaller or butterier than that.   Was this a problem with the sunflower seeds (maybe you can't home-make butter out of them?), the food processor, or should I just have blended it longer?  A useful site, and a few other ideas for OP:   Frozen fruit if you do smoothies (buy it cheap when it's seasonal, slice it up and freeze it in bags) Refried beans (I cook dried beans and an onion in the crockpot, add some salt, and use an immersion blender, other techniques are possible) Sauerkraut (look up lacto-fermentation. Kind of strange if you've never done it before, but it works amazingly.) Tortillas (Delicious! I think this is the recipe I used, with butter instead of lard. They take a little longer to make, so buying might be more convenient, but they're really good.) Popcorn (use a popcorn maker for ease, or live dangerously and use the stovetop.) Milk kefir as a yogurty base for smoothies or in baked goods (requires milk kefir grains. Do you know any hippies?) Bonus: Use the whey from your kefir to make ginger ale. Oh sweet Cthulhu it's the best."

For salt and pepper, if the turkey is already salted when previously cooked we won't add any salt to the pot.

It gets pretty soft, but not so soft that it wouldn't be a little odd in an apple sauce.)"

budgetfood,2lyayy,Tharoth,13,Tue Nov 11 09:40:11 2014 UTC,"Indian stores tend to have cheap rice/beans/lentils etc. I think 5kg of rice cost me somewhere in the $10 region - expensive as a one-off, but it would last you for ages. If there's someone you can cadge a Costco card off they have stuff like bulk (~$10) pasta. Also, like dejaenten said, keep an eye out for Aldi specials. Also, if you can, try and shop at malls that have both Coles and Woolies - my local only has Woolies, and without competition their prices are higher.  Seriously though, if you're in the $20 a fortnight region hit the Red Cross/St Vinnies/whoever does free meals in the CBD. You're exactly who they are for. Remember, they don't hand this stuff out based on what kind of person you are, they hand it out based on need, and it sounds like you have the need.  Finally, if you live in a capital city, make an appointment with your local MP's office. Labor and the Greens will have pointers to local resources, and the Libs are hyper-sensitive to poverty issues, so it's a hot-button topic for them too. Those fuckers work for you; might as well remind them what kind of job they're doing.  Best of luck, mate."

budgetfood,2lyayy,dejaenten_,6,Tue Nov 11 18:38:40 2014 UTC,"Eggs, lentils and homemade baked beans. Any of these things served with rice make a filling and nutritious meal that will cost very little. As someone has already suggested Indian shops are great for cheap staples like lentils and rice, also spices. For $9.30 you can get 2kg of rice, 1.5kg of dim sims and a dozen eggs from aldi. 2 dim sims with rice, or an egg with rice can make an ok meal, it isn't fantastic, but is better than just eating white bread. Check out your local green grocer for things that are cheap. In season at my local green grocer you can get fruit and veg for well under $1 per kilo, they not always pretty, but they're fine to eat.  Last year I got green apples for $0.29 per kilo because they were small and not pretty.  Which part of Australia are you in? Are you able to grow some some of your own food? Zucchini, tomatoes, and salad greens are all very easy to grow. Salad greens can be grown in a small pot and be ready within a month, and you can pick leaves from the lettuces and keep harvesting from the pot for months. There are also charities around who can help you. If you want some recipes send me a PM and I'll type some out for you, or if you want some info/advice on growing some of your own food I'm happy to help with that too. I've been in a similar situation food wise before, and if you're not careful you'll end up sick from malnutrition."

Ozbargain is handy site for keeping an eye out for supermarket coupon codes and deals at shops in your area.  Go to supermarkets near closing time to score meat and bread reduced for quick sale.  Big cans of tuna are great for throwing in just about anything, and they're a good source of protein. Have a look in the paper and visit your local Sunday markets for people selling eggs and veggies.  Cheaper cuts of meat make tasty meals if you use the right cooking technique, or just throw it in a slow cooker with a bit of this and that.  If you are struggling, please reach out to Vinnies or the Salvos. You shouldn't be going hungry, you could make yourself ill. They're there to help people.  Have you heard of Loaves and Fishes?They sell large food parcels at reduced prices. I know they're based in Brisbane and travel to Toowoomba, but I'm not sure where else they go.  It may be worth checking out.   All the best to you."

It also keeps in the fridge longer than most meats do.   Precut cabbage, frozen kale, frozen corn. Lots of nutrition and shelf life. Frozen edamame, microwaved for 2-3 minutes.   Cured meats. I often keep some chorizo around to add extra flavour. Frugal as it only takes a few grams to make a huge difference.  Onions, scallions, green onions, peppers ... Sliced thinly. I sometimes use a vegetable peeler or a vegetable noodle carving tool.   And most important, ¼ of a lemon, lime, or juice. This may be less frugal, but it turns a cheap stock into a vibrant, fresh tasting broth.  I find a more satisfying broth more filling."

budgetfood,2ln3qx,the_kitchen_queen,11,Sat Nov 8 02:48:20 2014 UTC,"Meat. From this point on, only buy meat that's on sale or marked down. Repackage as you need for yourself (eg. I'll buy a huge pack of pork chops and then put in ziplock packs of 4 or a 3lb-5lb family pack of ground meat and package into 1lb bags) and freeze that. Now, anytime you wanna make whatever meal you want the meat's ready. Learn to butcher a whole chicken, there's lots of youtube videos.  Also freezing many fresh veggies when they're in season is a great idea. We occasionally visit road side farmers stands near the end of the day when they have stuff left over and make deals for large quantities (""So, I'll take that crate of corn for $2""). The farmers are generally up for deals like that since they don't really want to put it all back on the trailer and take it in just to try to sell it again tomorrow.   Lastly, stocks. Make them with the chicken carcasses or meat bones from the stuff you had frozen. Quart freezer bags or recycling sour cream style containers works very well.  Edit: a few tips on meat: get as much air out of the packaging as possible. If you can get a vacuum packer, it's really the best. Air is what gives your meat freezer burn. Proper butchers will properly either vacuum pack or tightly wrap their meat and have it ready to freeze immediately."
budgetfood,2ln3qx,jet_heller,1 point,Sat Nov 8 13:51:13 2014 UTC,"We wrap our meat tightly in plastic wrap and then foil. That helps to keep the air off, and it means you can put multiple portions in one big zip top bag!"

budgetfood,2lemqi,locolarue,1 point,Thu Nov 6 15:58:30 2014 UTC,"Me and my roommate use canned tomatoes (get the ones with spices! Even the Food Lion store brand has two spiced version now!) corn, black beans, rice, chicken or sausage, a packet of mexican seasoning and get tortillas and make tacos/burritos/etc. Add some onion or pepper if you want. This is one of our go to meals, we eat it once or twice a week.  This makes enough for two big tortillas for dinner and then two or three more for lunch or dinner the next day.   You could do something similar for chili. Black beans, kidney and chili beans, cut up the chicken, make rice, add canned tomatoes or some tomato paste, voila, chili.  Fry up the spam and add it to your baked beans or use the spam in chunks in chili with the baked beans.   Get some peanut butter and jelly and bread. I get the big store brand jar that's like dice pounds for eight dollars at Food Lion, lasts about two weeks, I eat PB&J for breakfast most days.   Pasta you can make some sauce and heat up part of it and make noodles as you need them--eat it italian style, with a side of sauce, maybe only on half your pasta.  Butter some bread, add garlic powder, bake for five minutes in the oven, there's garlic bread to stretch your meals farther.   You could also make mini pizzas using the tortillas. Use your spaghetti sauce, smear some on a 4""-6"" tortillas, top it with some sardines (use whatever's cheap, we had sardines) and sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top, bake for ten minutes. Fold in half, enjoy. We did this as a quick dinner a few times to use up sardines.  Hardest thing will be finding cheese cheaply, but you could use less cheese and instead another tortilla--maybe flip it during the baking process?"

I like a little garlic salt and if you can get them cheap an egg will liven things up a bit.  That shit will stick to your ribs too.
budgetfood,2lemqi,DawnTheDreamer,-1,Wed Nov 5 22:16:48 2014 UTC,Chili powder and dry/canned beans could go a bit further. Corn starch or flour could be used as a thickener along with water.

That will last awhile. Bags of lentils, chickpeas, black beans, and rice can be gotten cheap and will fill you up in a pinch. Cabbage is usually pretty cheap and can be filling if eaten with a little meat. Find out which store near you has the best prices on value packs for chicken legs and store them separately in the freezer. Also, small whole chickens can be roasted, stripped of their meat and their bones can then be used to make a yummy chicken stock."

budgetfood,2lemqi,halifaxdatageek,3,Thu Nov 6 00:28:06 2014 UTC,Oatmeal + cocoa powder + blueberries  Peanut butter and banana sandwiches  Brown rice + frozen peas and carrots (the hot rice defrosts them without cooking them too much)
budgetfood,2lemqi,halifaxdatageek,1 point,Wed Nov 5 23:50:53 2014 UTC,"The oatmeal sounds fantastic, I'll have to try that. Do you have a ratio for that, or do you just eyeball it?  Peanut butter and banana used to be one of my favorite sandwiches as a kid. I can't believe I forgot about them. I'll have to snag some PB and B soon."
budgetfood,2lemqi,classic0090,2,Thu Nov 6 14:55:30 2014 UTC,"1 cup oatmeal + 1 tbsp cocoa powder + 1 cup blueberries.   Mix, add water to moisten.  To save money, you can go 1/2 cup blueberries and it'll be just as good (I've done that when I'm on the verge of running out, haha)  My father ate PBB nearly every day of his working life. I've eaten them nearly every weekday for the past ten years. They are a proud and noble foodstuff :)"
budgetfood,2lemqi,redshoewearer,1 point,Thu Nov 6 15:53:02 2014 UTC,"Thank you! I'll give it a try once i get to the grocery store later today.  Do you know if PBB is freezable, or if it has a fair life if I make them in batches? I like to make things ahead of time."
budgetfood,2lemqi,goethean_,2,Thu Nov 6 15:55:24 2014 UTC,"Bananas get really brown when you freeze them and the texture changes to almost crystalline. I don't know how to explain it, really... like the texture of freezer burn?  I only freeze bananas when I'm going to make fake ice cream or otherwise puree them though, so I don't know how good they are once thawed."
budgetfood,2lemqi,fangs124,1 point,Thu Nov 6 16:01:07 2014 UTC,"Good to know, thank you! Would the frozen bananas translate well to smoothies?"
budgetfood,2lemqi,classic0090,1 point,Thu Nov 6 16:07:05 2014 UTC,"Yeah I usually will throw bananas in the freezer once they're past the point of brown I like to eat them at. Then I'll either puree them with a bit of milk and cinnamon (and peanut butter if I'm feeling frisky) for fake ice cream, add them to a smoothie, or thaw them and use them for banana bread.  Just be aware that frozen bananas get this weird liquid nitrogen effect going, where when you try to peel them your fingers feel like they're going to fall off. I use a knife to score the peel first to speed the process. And, if you are not lazy like me, you could also cut them up and throw them in a ziploc before freezing them. I just put them in the freezer in their peels because again, I am lazy."
budgetfood,2lemqi,classic0090,1 point,Thu Nov 6 16:24:30 2014 UTC,"Awesome. Thank you, I'm going to have to give it a try, bananas are one of my favorites."
budgetfood,2lemqi,rodney45,2,Thu Nov 6 16:34:19 2014 UTC,"It is not freezable. I've tried, haha! The banana disintegrates on thawing, whole sandwich is a soupy mess, bad times.  They're good for about three days without refrigeration (again, speaking from accidental experience) and I'm not sure how long with refrigeration.  If you wanted, I'd suggest making a whole ton of peanut butter sandwiches, and then at the last minute adding the banana fresh.  After ten years I can make one in 90 seconds (I've timed myself, the trick is to snap the banana in half rather than cut it), so it was never really an issue for me :P"
budgetfood,2lemqi,rodney45,1 point,Thu Nov 6 16:02:47 2014 UTC,"Interesting, I guess I won't be trying the freezing.  It's good to know the rough life span. I will probably do the PB sandwiches and then adding bananas when needed.  I'll get to practicing, maybe I can beat your record :P"

Sounds plain and not that sexy but it will help you save some money and you will not go hungry so its a definite win. If you can you can go to Amazon and get ""Indo Mie Mi Goreng Instant Noodle, 3 Ounce (Pack of 30)"". Those noodles are awesome they are not like regular ramen you boil the noodles first then fry them they come with oil, sriracha, soy sauce to brown the noodles and onions if you want them in there. So rice, beans, noodles go vegan for awhile it will save you some money."

budgetfood,2lemqi,Gen_McMuster,1 point,Thu Nov 6 04:41:26 2014 UTC,Can you tell me what the sodium content is? Amazon didn't seem to have that information and the questions had conflicting answers.  I assume most of that sodium is in the soy sauce and sriracha that you mentioned.
budgetfood,2lemqi,iswearimachef,2,Thu Nov 6 14:59:18 2014 UTC,Sodium content is 470mg
budgetfood,2lemqi,goethean_,1 point,Thu Nov 6 17:49:39 2014 UTC,Cool thanks. Do you know if that is mostly from the toppings/flavorings? I assume it is.
budgetfood,2lemqi,gloryfortune,2,Thu Nov 6 18:09:13 2014 UTC,I would guess the same also the packaging didn't really give a complete breakdown. I would believe the most sodium come from the sriracha but that is an optional topping I will have to say as a fan of spicy it does make the noodles very tasty but you don't need it.
budgetfood,2lemqi,minkastu,3,Thu Nov 6 19:20:35 2014 UTC,"Firstly, go find the cheapest source of eggs and potatoes. I found a local place that sold eggs for $1.99 a dozen, and a 5lb bag of potatoes for $2.50. And hopefully you already have oil. Make some spanish tortillas. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqwdlnKF4Pc They go in the fridge real well and you can reheat them for days after. Minus the chorizo from that recipe, due to cost... But you can theoretically eat just that for about 2 weeks for around 6-10 dollars. Seriously, it fulfills your protein, carbohydrate and fat requirements completely. I also like making chicken drumsticks, you can usually find like 8 of them in the supermarket for about 5 bucks. You can marinate them in italian dressing, or hot sauce, then throw them on a cookie sheet for 45-50 minutes at 375 degrees, flip and put back in for 10 minutes. Melt a tbsp of butter and some hot sauce in a separate bowl, and you got yourself some buffalo wings. I have some other recipes, but im making this a wall of text, PM me for others... and dont ever be ashamed to go to a local food bank, walk in and ask to volunteer and help out in return for a box of food, more often than not at the end of the day they'll have so much left over stuff that you'll really feel bad for not taking some home! Good luck!"

budgetfood,2lemqi,RyerOrdStar,7,Thu Nov 6 16:07:26 2014 UTC,"Also I'd say go for canned vegetables over frozen. Not only are they way cheaper but they're healthier too.   I disagree! Canned veggies have been processed quite a bit. They have to be washed, cooked, then packed in salt water (to keep them sterile in the cans) before they're put in cans. With each step of processing, you lose a ton of nutrients. Frozen veggies are basically washed then thrown in the freezer. Frozen veggies are also cheaper per weight (you're paying for veggies and only veggies, whereas in canned veggies, there's a lot of water) and you can divide them into several portions easily. Where I live, one pound is less than $1 for about 4 servings, which makes about a quarter per serving."
budgetfood,2lemqi,Yarsl,1 point,Wed Nov 5 23:26:32 2014 UTC,"Depends on where you live. Where I live, farmers have been promoting canned AND frozen veggies as a way to eat fresh food all year round :)"
budgetfood,2lemqi,julicaro,1 point,Wed Nov 5 23:40:13 2014 UTC,"Interesting! Where do you live? I'm from the US, so the canning process may be different elsewhere. Or it could've changed, who knows!"
budgetfood,2lemqi,Idras_Hairline,2,Wed Nov 5 23:53:03 2014 UTC,"I'm up in Canada, last I checked most things were canned pretty simply:   Sterilize can. Insert food, fill with water/brine/etc. Seal. Profit!   IIRC, most liquid fillings are for flavour and/or tradition, rather than germs.  I am not a germ specialist  Also, I found this report that compared fresh/frozen/canned."
budgetfood,2lemqi,goethean_,3,Thu Nov 6 00:20:43 2014 UTC,"Interesting report!  In the US, vegetables are typically blanched before they're canned. This makes them pretty sterile, but not 100%. The salt in the liquid actually pulls the water out of any leftover bacteria to keep it from reproducing. (If there's even a tiny bit of bacteria in there, it will grow crazy fast, because it's warm and wet inside the can. So when that can gets eaten, that tiny amount of bacteria has become a HUGE amount of bacteria and has all possibility of making someone sick.) Between the cooking, the salt, and being closed off in the can, it stays pretty sterile. I always heard that each of these steps took a lot of nutrients out, but if that report is to be believed, it's a negligible amount!  Source: microbiology."
budgetfood,2lemqi,chowy26,1 point,Thu Nov 6 00:31:26 2014 UTC,"Processing usually only goes so far as to add salt, for plain veggies at least. You only run into weird shit your body might not process very well in soups, chilis and other ""meals in a can."" canning vegetables has been around for a long time, and the process hasn't changed that much."
budgetfood,2lemqi,dmc0012,1 point,Thu Nov 6 01:24:49 2014 UTC,"Nothing wrong with canned foods at all. They're still the same vegetable/fruit that they were when they began. All I was saying was that they lost more of their nutrition by the time they get to the table than frozen fruit/vegetables. Vitamins are lost when they're blanched, and then when they're put into the salt water, nutrients come out through the cell wall into the water, which is drained off before eating. Then when they're cooked, they lose nutrients there. With frozen produce, they get a little bit of nutrient loss when they're rinsed, but they are typically frozen immediately afterwards. This sometimes means that they have more nutrients than fresh produce. They don't lose any nutrients when they're frozen, but when they're cooked, they lose some."

Their chicken breasts are usually cheap and taste the same as any where else's. Their pre chopped and washed spinach is something we always buy, as well as their milk. We also like their sour cream better than other name brands. Another thing is a lot of their food is organic, if you are into that, and cheap. I can get organic salsa there for $1.19. Their nut butters are very cheap too. I believe they are owned by the same company as trader joes so their items are quality. The only thing I have heard to stay away from is their frozen pizzas. Apparently they taste like cardboard."

Some of the frozen ready-made foods taste like garbage, but 1) you get that in Walmart, too, and 2) OP won't be looking for those.  That said, while Aldi's is cheapest for pretty much everything, I find that you have to get lucky to get a better-than-average price with their meats.

I'm used to eating slightly lower than brand-name quality (and can only detect the difference on certain things -- breakfast cereals, chips, etc). So for me, the transition to Aldi's various store-brands was pretty seamless; the quality is roughly equal. If you're used to name-brands, it'll be an adjustment."

Their ice cream and cereals, for instance, are the same as Kemps and General Mills respectively, at least in the Midwest."

Totally a good idea for those who need the extra dollars, but not beneficial in the long-run.  Again, I like the idea, but i feel like OP needs more help in the future and not for the 'i'm gonna spend this extra money on booze.'  I (as others have) suggest finding a food kitchen/bank near your place.  It's probably a hit to your ego, but you NEED food to continue living.  Use it as a resource until you're back on your feet.  I don't think it's worthwhile to feel ashamed for needing sustenance to continue living.  If you're in-between jobs/paychecks, keep food banks in mind.  Donate to them to them to help people who are in the position you once were in.  You can only do so much at any given time, just make sure you give back when you have some extra time."

You need to go to a food bank. If you won't, then there has to be a way to get $20 together. Pawn something and then buy it back. Borrow $20. Get a credit card and pay it off. This is only possible if you know your going to have $20 later. That's where the income side needs to come in."

So be extremely diligent with your payments. Check your balance and statements every month even if you don't think there is a balance on that card that month, that might be the month you got hit with some fee or maybe an SO used the card. And always double check that your payment has been applied to your balance. I messed up a few times by paying the same credit card twice instead of paying each card once. Be careful, little tiny insignificant things like paying a cc one day late can really have an impact on you for many years."

I want to have a card that I can use and immediately pay off just for the benefit of my credit score.  I am sad that I can't just apply for a mortgage/homeowners loan just because I have ""no"" credit. It sucks that because I am able to live within my means I am pretty much useless as an applicant.

One trick you might try that I do to save space is to put liquid or semi-liquid food (like stews, which I eat a lot of) into a plastic container, freeze it, and then seal it into a vacuum bag.

budgetfood,2l9x0v,CaptainWeb,3,Tue Nov 4 17:36:52 2014 UTC,"An easy way to get around this and still keep a budget are a few key components...  Learn to buy your meat in larger packages when they're on a better sale. When you get home, break the package down into meal sized portions for one and freeze them individually, so you can just thaw single portions at a time without having to pay more money for less meat (for instance when chicken goes on sale for cheap in bulk). It doesn't take long to portion everything out.  Eating something like a protein, side veggies or salad, and some sort of grain (rice, pasta, bread) is an easy and balanced meal and be changed up in many different ways. Most produce you can purchase per pound, and even things that come in bulk like onions or potatoes last a long time, and other things like celery, carrots, etc. will last quite awhile so you can use it bit by bit.

Essentially taking the chicken, removing skin and some of the 'slimy bits', and putting it on sprayed foil.   Put some rind of lemon on top (fresh!), and sprinkle paprika, thyme, sage, and rosemary on top. Lastly, put the slices of lemon on top.  I put this in a toaster oven at 175ºC with the (2) slices of spaghetti squash (covered in foil) shown for about 30 minutes. Meat was about 75ºC at that point, lastly broiled it for about 5 to 8 minutes.  It is served with 85g of capellini, and a cheap (primo) spaghetti sauce (need to spice that one up!).  The chicken happened to be halal - the guy I get it from has 'normal' sized chicken, as opposed to be Italian grocery near by has monstrous sized legs.   My guess for cost on this one would be $1.54 (chicken) + $.20 (capellini) + $0.30 (lemon) + xxx (squash was on hand) = ~2 to $2.25 for the plate."

It seem's that I've struck a chord with you, because you have resorted to name calling. I guess you truly do have poor taste in not only food but with a variety of other things.

Anyways, you aren't reading what I'm saying—I'm saying there's no color theory for food (as you were obviously going to reference color theory and the theory of aesthetics, since you're making a bad color reference in your 'analogy')   You've still not shown a shred of data relating to food. You've linked to two resources on color, which was predictable and what I tried to get in front of—I'd still like you to explain your statement, that chicken and pasta and squash can't pair.  Seems like you're unable to do that, though."
budgetfood,2l7dkg,GalacticCannibalism,0,Tue Nov 4 20:51:47 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure you fully comprehend the notion that even though I'm using an example about poor color combination, I'm also referring to the idea the flavor combinations sometimes clash, much like color. Nonetheless , color combination does play a role in food to here's an example: http://imgur.com/gVW10Yh  http://issuu.com/caivano/docs/1415peacock  Also,   Actually, that's quite a complicated question. Many combinations of foods (and herbs/spices/etc, or other ingredients) seem to ""taste good together"" to most people, but there are also things that taste good in combination only to some people or only in some situations.   Some of it has to do with combining types of things (like a grain product and a fatty/milk product, which may be better than combining two grains--say rice and bread). Sometimes having a variety of ""textures"" is good too. Asian and other cultures also like to combine things that have 5 flavor profiles all in one item (or just some of them)...e.g., something sweet, salty, sour, spicy, maybe ""bitter,"" etc. Other cultures have their favorite combinations some of which others would agree with, some not.   Some combinations are well-known to cooks, new and old. Those who cook wider-ranging dishes, or who have ""studied"" cooking, food combinations, etc, will tend to know more though.   Check out some of these links for lots of conversation and ideas about those things:  http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/553864  http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/c...  http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questio...  http://ask.metafilter.com/100256/Cilantr... (esp. the longer answer near middle of the page of answers)  And there's a whole new theory called molecular ""food pairing"" that's around now too, and a bit complicated.   There are also others who have written about food chemistry and what makes flavors and makes various things happen you might be interested in too... check out my answer here for a list of some of those people:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...   (Actually, tomatoes + ice cream may not prove the point since tomatoes are really fruits, and if they're made sweet enough--through carmelization while cooking or by adding sweeteners or other flavorings-- I guess there's no big reason some form of them shouldn't be similar to eating other sweet or sweetened fruits or purees with ice cream.

While the noodles are boiling, heat cream of mushroom soup and sour cream in a deep pan. Add milk to thin out the sauce. You just want the sauce to simmer.   Microwave the meatballs (or bake if you've got the time), add them into the sauce, and add in noodles once they're done boiling. Stir to combine.  Bam. Dinner. Less than 30mins prep time. You could also add in more mushrooms by slicing and sautéing them in a pat of butter before adding everything else to the pan.  I usually eat it with a side of green beans."

With most of these foods the taste just gets better over time as the seasonings work their magic. Nowadays people are amazed when you know your way around a kitchen; women find it really, really attractive. In a month you can be chopping vegetables almost like pros on tv. It's probably no more expensive than buying packaged foods which consist of sugar, salt, flour, and fat. A bunch of spices from the dollar store will cost $10 and last 2 months.

Branch out, it will make your pee smell better too.  Favorites of the season: beets, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, sweet potatoes, squash, rutabaga.  Next: why just birds?  Tofu, eggs, and beans are awesome.   Grains: do you have a Costco or trader Joe's? They both have very good prices on quinoa. High protein delicious grain, slightly nutty flavor. It's not dirt cheap, but it is quite good for you. I mix in sauteed vegetables and feta cheese.    Lastly, if money wasn't a factor and you could eat out every night, what would you order? I'm a mostly stay at home mom, so money is tight. I really miss Chinese take out, but I can't justify paying $10 per meal (and I can eat a lot, so I don't get a second meal out of it).  So I try to make my own.  Scramble eggs, stir fry veggies, add rice, make a sauce from soy sauce, sriracha, spices from the cupboard... Veggie fried rice!"

I start with garlic and onion, because I think it flavors the oil and thus the other vegetables. Then go hard to soft. Carrots need to start before eggplant, beets before broccoli.  Keep in mind size, too. If you cut the carrots super tiny, but the sweet potato in large chunks, they won't be done at the same time."
budgetfood,2kltrf,CrazyPlato,8,Wed Oct 29 01:11:27 2014 UTC,"Spice it all up. Pretty much any of those foods are bases for a lot of dishes; the difference is in how you season them. Take chicken for instance: add a teriyaki marinade or ginger and you have an asian dish, add cilantro, garlic, and chili pepper (or taco seasoning if you're looking for super cheap) and you have mexican food, etc. You can make all kinds of food with what you're using, if you just add some flavor to it."

I like to get the big cheap roasts with the skin still on... delicious crispy fatty pork skin!  And try different recipes with your chicken/turkey. Oyako Donburi is delicious. Shred the meat and make tacos. Throw chicken breasts into chili and let it slow cook until it falls apart. Sautee sliced sausage with chopped cabbage. Make curry. Buy spices or blends (cajun seasoning is awesome, so is Old Bay if you're on the east coast). Learn how to stir fry. Eat tofu or beans."
budgetfood,2kltrf,StockerBox,4,Tue Oct 28 23:04:25 2014 UTC,"Try cooking rice with chicken broth or some kind of powered soup base to give it more flavour, and I'm also a huge fan of garlic mashed potatoes. Frozen pierogies are pretty cheap and come in different flavours - boil em then fry them with some onions.  It sounds like you just need more recipes, spices and to expand your veggie selection. This is my go to for easy, tasty, chicken breasts, or this for leg quarters or thighs. Buy whole roast chicken and eat for a few days - they're usually cheaper cooked for some reason - then make a chicken stock. For sides you could do potatoes (mashed, baked, boiled, scalloped, seriously so many things), carrots, beans, broccoli, peas, whatever you like.  If you're feeling in a rut, just look up a new recipe for whatever cut of meat or veggie you have in your fridge.

It's definitely possible for her to be unable to eat any of it. It's also kind of weird for you to attribute her allergies or possible dislike of seafood with her being female."
budgetfood,2kltrf,PoeDancer,-9,Tue Oct 28 23:41:01 2014 UTC,"I just said it's possible.    And compared to the shit women I know have actually done, this is far from out there"
budgetfood,2kltrf,Idras_Hairline,7,Tue Oct 28 23:34:06 2014 UTC,"I just said it's possible.   I know. That's why I said that having allergic reactions to all seafoods is also possible, and not super mega rare. What bothered me was when you said it was ""a crazy woman thing.""    compared to the shit women I know have actually done   Or you know, those women who did crazy shit are actually just crazy people, and lots of sane women wouldn't do the same.  Rather than attributing it to women, attribute it to the person being crazy. :) Because crazy people can be of either gender.   If you go to Askreddit ""Worst Roommate Stories"" threads, I'm sure you'll see there's ""crazy men things"" and ""crazy women things"" that selfish people do to establish control. SOME men are guilty of the same thing as SOME women."
budgetfood,2kltrf,PoeDancer,-2,Wed Oct 29 00:27:29 2014 UTC,"I don't think it's even debatable that women have a much more socially recognized array of crazy capabilities.    I knew a girl who convinced me she was vegetarian, so that she could freek out, claim she was pregnant, and start eating meat ""for the baby"", hoping I'd buy her stuff out of some misplaced sense of chivalry.  And it wasn't even my pretend kid.  So when I hear some strange ""fact"" about someone, it's my first instinct to start considering all the ulterior motives they might have for wanting others to know that.  The thread is already going to be full of people giving real suggestions, while I'm sitting here wondering why OP feels responsible for cooking their roommates meals every day.  I have never done anything like that with any of my roommates.  We all just get our own stuff and do our own thing.  Roommates can be really, REALLY fucked up people sometimes, and you gotta look out for yourself."
budgetfood,2kltrf,Jennfizzle,4,Wed Oct 29 00:43:53 2014 UTC,"I don't think it's even debatable that women have a much more socially recognized array of crazy capabilities.   You see, most people would think of that statement as being sexist, as well as not backed up by any science. Also since you are using anecdotal evidence, ""crazy people stories"" on Askreddit provide lots of anecdotes of men and women being all sorts of crazy.   Society certainly makes it easy for some women to manipulate in order to receive money or physical things. But just because YOU happen to know more women who are manipulative, doesn't mean there aren't manipulative men as well. In fact, you might want to take a look at what kind of women you are befriending. That shit ain't normal, yo. Certain types of people attract certain other people, as certain flowers attract bees.    crazy capabilities   By the way, the spectrum of abusive relationships, physical, or verbal, can happen to any gender. Once again, if you want proof, I'd ask you to seek out Askreddit stories about abusive relationships or crazy ex boy/girlfriends.   And if you want some stories about crazy men (usually), check out /r/creepypms. There's lots of creeps who guilt trip, manipulate, insult men and women to get sexual satisfaction.    it's my first instinct to start considering all the ulterior motives they might have for wanting others to know that.   It sucks that you feel the need to think this way. People often say I'm too trusting of others (not that I take shit from people if they try, obviously), but to be honest, I haven't been fucked over by anyone I know, really. In fact, I've been surprised by my community's honesty (I've lost my wallet and my phone on multiple occasions, and got them back each time) Maybe you should consider finding a better environment where it's easier to trust strangers.   you gotta look out for yourself   True! As OP says though, she doesn't mind eating just poultry. And by the way, the roommate is not purchasing red meat because OP does not eat red meat either, so it's both of them limiting themselves. It's not as if the roommate is the one placing all the limits.  Also I have never had a problem with sharing food when I was just rooming with another girl. We were already pretty good friends, and we pooled most supplies equally. Roommates are not bad when you know for sure they're not crazy, and you already like them!"

(If you aren't already)  It's cheaper in the US because breast is more popular, but I actually prefer thighs because they are juicier and more flavorful (if a little more fatty).  Cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, onions are all pretty cheap, I think. You can roast them, make soups of of them, etc.  Spice wise, if you're okay with eating spicy food, get a jar of curry paste. (Paste, not powder!!!!) Use it to make curry sauces over rice or potatoes, or just as a seasoning to whatever you cook!

budgetfood,2khlzv,chrisbluemonkey,5,Tue Oct 28 11:36:04 2014 UTC,"It's really good.  The way I really like it is to blacken some chicken and serve over Alfredo linguini with lots of lime mixed in to the sauce and squeezed over the top.  When not using blackened chicken I'll do some variation on the following  Sautee sliced onion  Add black pepper and cayenne.  (Chopped habenero is great here if you've got it)  Add sliced or quartered limes (about 4 per small onion) to the hot cast iron skillet and let them caramelize slightly.    Remove limes without burning yourself and squeeze all juice back into pan.    Add in home made or store bought Alfredo sauce of your choice and stir.    Pour over or mix in pasta and serve with limes for garnish.   This is great meatless or with a variety of well handled meats.  I prefer any meat to be on top and crispy such as blackened chicken, slices of sausage, or as in the sandwich example,  crispy fried strips of Italian meats."

I'm willing to entertain the not budget aspect although in some food deserts it is much less expensive to make this meal than purchase the meat and veggies fresh.  But ""disgusting""? I'm sorry but that just seems more subjective than we should get in a food sub. If it were candy coated fermented fish then sure. Although for all I know that's some Viking dish.  But I think people were equating not classy with disgusting.  Just because some don't think subway Meatballs taste good it doesn't mean others don't.  Or that the idea wouldn't translate to meatball subs from other places.

Stir fry with some olive oil, garlic and salt, then add broth and steam until softened.  Top generously with favorite tomato sauce, more than you would for the equivalent amount of pasta.

Two, it eliminates the problem of running out of one thing before the others.  That allows you to tweak the recipe.  Only got 8 eggs, well hardly noticeable; got more beans, well it all mixes up and you don't have to worry about how much to put in each.  As for frozen,I always let mine thaw.

budgetfood,2k4azi,kyha,1 point,Fri Oct 24 02:26:20 2014 UTC,"My favorite way to season rice?  During cooking.  And I have to say, a pinch of salt in the cook water does wonders.  Wisdom gleaned from /u/thealtonbrown (from his show Good Eats, and books he's written):  Undersalting during cooking is the leading cause of oversalting at the table.  If you cook starch without salt, it will never taste right.  I once cooked 3 cups of rice in my friend's rice cooker, and told him ""I'm going to salt it.""  He was worried that I'd raise the boiling point of the water with the salt -- and I showed him, very deliberately, how I took less than 1/8 tsp of salt betwen my thumb and forefinger and sprinkled it in the mix.  When he tasted it his comment was, ""It's amazing how so little salt can change the flavor that noticeably.""  Seriously.  White rice + water with nothing else is a recipe for making something that tastes more bland than library paste.  There is nothing that will make it taste anything other than bland.  And don't limit this to just salt.  Any other herbs or spices you might be interested in playing with, any boullion or broth or vegetable sauce you might want to impart the flavor of, anything at all will be picked up by the rice.  This is the secret of saffron rice, and it works just as well for anything else you might want to cook it with."

budgetfood,2k3ohn,reol7x,6,Thu Oct 23 15:21:21 2014 UTC,"Here's an idea - pick a central food type, typically a meat, and cook up enough of it to last you all week.  Use basic seasonings while cooking.  Now, pick sauces and sides that will change up how that meat will be eaten.  Let's use chicken as an example:   Make chicken wraps using greek yogurt+lime juice as a dressing.  Add spinach, peppers, whatever you like.  You can use low fat ranch dressing too, or hummus for a Mediterranean vibe! Taco night with chicken, diced tomatoes, avocados, etc.  Use a lettuce ""taco"" for lower carbs if you want to. (lettuce can also be used for wraps!) Saute veggies and have some diced chicken and veggies with whatever sauce you choose.  Broccoli+chicken and a nice soy sauce or with Sriracha on top - yum!  Or create a peanut sauce using peanut butter, brown sugar, and soy sauce for a Thai flavor.  You can also stir fry it with brown rice. Cook up some spaghetti squash (or regular spaghetti) along with a red sauce and have chicken and pasta. Make a soup or stew using chicken broth, potatoes, carrots, celery, and spices. Make chicken salad by mincing the chicken and mixing with mayo or greek yogurt, hard boiled egg(s) - as many as you like, diced pickles and onion.  I like to sprinkle dill on it because it's delicious.  This is great in sandwiches or wraps, or even by itself.

Total = $6.75-$7  Steak was half off, a weekly meat mark down. Avocados are on sale for $1 ea. Cucumber and onion are pretty cheap year round. I buy eggs in 18-packs because it's cheap and I eat a lot of eggs, it's about $3 for the pack. The seasonings were all already on hand, as was the bleu cheese and butter, so I don't remember how much they were. The fat I cooked the steak in was rendered from some beef marrow bones I roasted a week or so back. (The bones were purchased from an Asian grocery, $3.50 ish for 2lbs.)  The best part was that it was also ridiculously easy. I salted the steak overnight, cranked the fat up to high, and seared it for about a minute on each side, then turned the heat down, melted the butter and spooned it over the steak. Took it off the heat, put the cheese on, tented it, then fried the eggs in the steak pan. The cucumber was chopped with red onion, a dash of sesame oil, rice vinegar, pepper, and soy sauce."

budgetfood,2jzw8i,Bologna_1,4,Wed Oct 22 15:05:21 2014 UTC,I've always heard that adding salt too early in the cooking gives you tough beans. Do you have that issue?
budgetfood,2jzw8i,mosswalker,4,Wed Oct 22 17:43:27 2014 UTC,"Interesting point. I did a little research...   The Science of Good Cooking suggests that a combination of brining and salting are key to helping beans cook more quickly and more evenly. First, they suggest brining the beans overnight by adding a salt to their soaking water. Then add a little salt (emphasis on ""little"") to the beans at the very beginning of cooking to keep things going.  This two-punch combo of salt action works to break apart the calcium and magnesium ions in the outer skin — the ions responsible for tough skins. This makes the skin softer and more permeable, allowing water to penetrate more easily into the bean itself.    So what does make beans tough?   The culprits are usually either cooking them in hard water, cooking them with acidic ingredients (like tomatoes), or old beans that are past their prime.

budgetfood,2jzw8i,chicklette,3,Wed Oct 22 20:48:06 2014 UTC,The problem with cooking a bag of mixed beans is that some of the beans (like lentils) will take maybe 25 minutes of cooking to get soft while others (like kidney beans) can take up to 2 hours.
budgetfood,2jzw8i,Natsukashii,3,Wed Oct 22 21:03:39 2014 UTC,"I either do the slow soak method mentioned here already, or the quick soak, which is bringing the beans to a boil in enough water to cover them by 3 inches.

After that, I either toss them into the crock pot on high for 8 hours or on the stove at simmer for around 3 hours - just until tender.  I like to add either pieces of bacon (I really like the ends for soups/stews and it's pretty inexpensive), or a ham hock, smoked turkey neck, etc.    Another option is to forgo the meat and add peppers, a can of tomatoes and some onions, some cumin and cayenne, and make a black bean soup."

Same kind of thing as /u/Bologna_1's instructions.    You soak them over night to rehydrate the beans.  Then I don't even toss out the water (I just make sure there is enough) and just turn the stove to 4/10.  I toss in cumin, chili powder, garlic powder and cayenne pepper galor.  I cook the beans until is all taking on a chili like consistancy and just make sure there is enough water in the pot.  Then I add salt...I was told somewhere that salt can prevent the beans proteins from breaking down if you add it too early so I wait until about 30 min-1 hour before the beans are ready.   Beans are easy enough to make that once you get them correct once you should be able to figure it out every other time. And don't be scared to pop a bean into your mouth to figure out how un-cooked it is."

budgetfood,2jszlw,FrawgyG,10,Mon Oct 20 19:17:08 2014 UTC,I keep forgetting that there are entire countries where ovens aren't just assumed to be in every kitchen.

budgetfood,2jszlw,Bonfrito,3,Mon Oct 20 22:43:53 2014 UTC,"Toaster oven, if you have an opportunity to grab one and aren't cooking for a lot of people. It's so much faster and easier."
budgetfood,2jszlw,FrawgyG,5,Mon Oct 20 22:51:10 2014 UTC,"Absolutely! you'll need the following...  1-2 Pounds Potato  way to boil potatoes  Salt  1/4 cup vinegar  1/4 cup cooking oil  cold water  Cut the potatoes in whatever shape you want to eat them, then put them into a pot and completely cover with water. Put about 1 tablespoon of salt and the 1/4 cup of vinegar in the water, and put on heat. Once they start to boil, only let them boil for about 8-10 minutes (a finer dice needs less time because of surface area).  Once they have boiled, drain the potatoes and pat them dry with a towel or paper towel.   Heat up the oil in a pan on medium to high heat, and wait for the oil to be loose in the pan (slipping around like water instead of syrup). Once the oil is hot, add the potatoes and let them cook for about 7-15 minutes, depending on size. Move occasionally to keep them from burning and to get all sides crispy.  There you go! Crispy pan fried potatoes that can go with anything."

budgetfood,2jszlw,Purpleotterbox6,4,Mon Oct 20 22:44:08 2014 UTC,"you can microwave potatoes, and they come out similar to baked potatoes. Honestly I prefer them, it only takes ~7 minutes compared to like 45 in the oven.  edit: granted i'm not sure you would want to microwave these potatoes with all the stuff on them."
budgetfood,2jszlw,OatsNraisin,3,Tue Oct 21 05:00:03 2014 UTC,"Just pan fry them on med-low, with a lid on, stirring/shaking pretty frequently."
budgetfood,2jszlw,scottyb83,2,Tue Oct 21 05:45:34 2014 UTC,I do something similar to this using a bag of shredded hashbrowns. Maybe you could shred the potatoes and just cook them in the skillet.   Or bake them? And then cut them up.
budgetfood,2jszlw,OatsNraisin,1 point,Sun Oct 26 07:00:05 2014 UTC,"Potatoes are easy to bake in the oven.  Puncture it with a fork all over, then zap it for 4 minutes and it's done."

budgetfood,2jszlw,mehdbc,4,Mon Oct 20 20:11:06 2014 UTC,If I was going to the trouble to cook the potatoes in the oven I would sure as hell roast the broccoli too. Infinitely better than steaming. Night and day difference in flavor. If you cut the potatoes up small enough and used frozen broccoli you might actually get it to work alright throwing it in all at once.
budgetfood,2jszlw,tehzephyrsong,4,Tue Oct 21 05:51:56 2014 UTC,"potatoes take a long time to cook compared to the meat and broccoli. I'm sure there are methods that you could do it all together but I like the potatoes roasted, the broccoli steamed, and the beef pan browned."

I like mine to still have some bite. I time things so they are done close together. I sometimes stir fry the meat in the pot before adding the broth, and sometimes I steam that too. When the noodles are done I dump it all into the broth, swish it around, and drain. Sometimes I stir fry everything separate and dont dump them into the broth.  If it's shin I have noodles and broth.

Breakfast  12 eggs. 1 package bacon. 1 pack shredded cheddar. Butter (unsalted).  Cook all the bacon in the oven allowing fat to fall below into a dish or tin foil.  Crack the eggs into 5 separate tupperware containers. Scramble all of them, then drop a little butter, salt and pepper into them. Close containers and refigerate.  Take 5 sandwich bags, fill each with a small handful of cheese.  Wrap 5 portions of bacon in paper towel, place inside bag of cheese.  Refigerate.  At work, 30-60 seconds of your eggs in the microwave (don't overcook).  Spread the cheese on the hot eggs, mix together well.  Enjoy.  Lunch   Those cans of chili and soup that you can microwave right in the can are a lifesaver. They have much less saturated fat than a fast food burger. Chop up all your favorite vegetables (cucumber, broccoli, carrot, bell pepper) throw them into 5 lunch bags. Refrigerate and bring to work. Small container of balsamic vinagrette or italian. Buy a good lunch bag. This will make you WANT to pack it with food and bring it to work. Your cold food will stay cold until lunch and you will have enough room to toss a drink in there. Trust me, it's a good investment. Here's mine (14 bucks, good size, insulated): http://amzn.com/B006HFC3K2 People crave carbs during lunch. Buy some good quality french or italian bread and give yourself a portion size to bring to work. Water. Seriously. For fucks sakes. Bring a big bottle of water to work. Throw some ice in it and drink throughout the day. You won't feel lethargic and it will wake you up, I promise.   3 years ago here was my daily work routine: Skip breakfast, work ass off all morning, Huge lunch full of saturated fat, loads of salt, and a huge soda or energy drink. Tired as fuck by 3pm. Go out and buy another red bull. Get home tired as shit. Can't figure out why. Order pizza, go to sleep, repeat 5 days a week.  I work 12 hours a day. If you allow it, it will destroy you.  I let it rule me for 3 years, but I couldn't handle my own diet ignorance anymore. Now I actually USE food to help me be productive at work.

budgetfood,2jntht,peanut6661,16,Sun Oct 19 16:17:38 2014 UTC,"When I was a a bachelor and big into my personal health (As a bit of a rebound from drinking myself into a coma most nights and subsisting off of hot pockets and Totinos Party Pizzas and delivery Chinese), I would usually have a dinner consisting of fish or chicken, vegetables, rice, and some sort of sauce.  I would steam the veggies (Broccoli or brussell sprouts were my favorite, but I would also eat cauliflower, carrots, mixed veggies) in a microwaveable steamer bowl, and use the water runoff from that to cook a cup of rice on the stovetop. While this was cooking, I'd cook a cut up and thawed chicken breast, or two small fish fillets, in a skillet.   After the meat was done, I'd plate everything, and use the juices left in the skillet from the meat, with a little bit of whatever (Mustard, milk, cream, butter, or bbq sauce...Maybe with a few spices and such, whatever felt like it'd work. Not a lot, just enough to pull the juice together so I could use it to add flavor to the vegetables or rice, or complement the meat) added, to make a nice, light sauce to pour over whichever part of the meal seemed best.  Frozen chicken, frozen fish, instant rice (Not that boil-in-a-bag crap), and frozen or fresh veggies are stupid cheap.  The above meal would take me maybe 10-15 minutes, total, and it was quite filling and tasty. I will still usually use it as my go-to when I'm not cooking for both my wife and I, if she's out of town, because it's so simple and easy.  EDIT: If you're cooking to make a lunch to pack for work, I imagine the above would work well, but I'd try to find something to replace the rice with, as rice usually doesn't keep well in a refrigerator or lunch box, in my experience. But, even then, chicken and some steamed vegetables with a bit of sauce would surely be a satisfying and filling work lunch.  EDIT 2: While the above meal is a recommendation for a single person's dinner, you could easily double or triple the amount of food, to store for later meals, without any real increase in cooking time. I added this remembering your 'too tired to cook'. Best of luck with your situation, I hope you can find a solution."

Your probably only want to make them half sized so you don't have too much food.  Make them and then eat them as left overs for dinners.  If you don't know how to cook then start with a cooking for kids or cooking for teens site.   For lunches I buy the bags of salad mix and add things to them.  I always have grated cheese, nuts, pumpkin seeds, dried fruit to put in my salad.  Sometimes I will cook chicken on Sunday slice it and have it on a salad or boil some eggs. Just make sure you have some protein and fat with your salad or on it so you don't get hungry in a short amount of time.  Breakfast oatmeal can be made in the microwave very easily .  Start with 1/3 of quick cook oats and a cup of water. (I use 2/3 of a cup of water but I like my oatmeal thick). Cook for two mins. Add sugar and milk and eat.  You can also add fruit or nuts after cooking."

I add potatoes, celery and carrots ($2.99 for $5 or cheaper on sale, $1 and $1)  roast at 350 for 30-45 minutes or until done by a thermometer.   The rack is important then the fat drains down,  if you don't have one elevate on balled up tin foil.   Can be cooked in crock pot.   Makes 10 individual meals at least and can be frozen.

I agree that homemade is so much better and really not that hard, but we are really not answering his question here.  For some advice OP: read the label to see if there is any added sugar, corn syrup, glucose/fructose, etc. There will likely always be a little bit, but it shouldn't be in the first few ingredients for sure. You may have better luck asking a local subreddit for advice on this because most people on this sub seem to be from the US, where there are completely different brands/formulations."
budgetfood,2jmhyz,wachet,1 point,Sat Oct 18 21:21:14 2014 UTC,passata is just crushed tomatoes. It works by itself as a sauce without needing anything. That's why I suggested it.

budgetfood,2jmhyz,wachet,1 point,Sat Oct 18 23:07:06 2014 UTC,"Eh, we're all different. I like making homemade sauces, but seeing as the question is about pre-made sauces, all of that information I could give becomes trivial. My two ideas are things I have done when I've not felt like actually cooking and they're not bad - sugar content is much lower, so the chance of sweetness is reduced too. Oddly, I made a tomato sauce today and it uses another pre-made sauce as an ingredient purely to add sweetness."
budgetfood,2jmhyz,BloodBride,2,Sat Oct 18 23:10:11 2014 UTC,"No idea, tho I just suggest buying crushed tomatoes+reduced tomatoes and adding peppar+salt+any spice/seasoning you want.  1000% cheaper, tastes the same really."
budgetfood,2jmhyz,Krehlmar,4,Mon Oct 20 22:20:18 2014 UTC,"to be honest, instead of paying for a pre-made tomato sauce, which tends to cost a fair bit, I tend to go with a tin of tomatoes and a small container of tomato puree mixed together. This usually costs around 59p and merely needs mixing together, no real effort. If you don't like that plan, Lidl tend to sell jars of passata, which work very well as a standalone sauce. It's about 59p (price does go up sometimes) and is pretty big."

Put that in the casserole dish, crumble some Ritz crackers or potato chips on top and bake it for 15-20 minutes at 350.  Substitute 2-3 cooked and cubed chicken breasts for the tuna and add some of that salsa. You can keep or get rid of the veggies, totally up to you. Sprinkle some shredded cheese on top and bake it for 20 minutes or so at 350.  Make sure to add a little bit of extra milk since the box directions don't take baking into account.

Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in nonstick pan on medium high heat. Add in a scoop of potato mixture and flatten out 1/2 in thick. Once golden brown on the bottom, flip and cook the other side. Serve with applesauce or sour cream. SO GOOD!!"

budgetfood,2j2tno,bentwhiskers,1 point,Mon Oct 13 20:10:33 2014 UTC,"Instead of always thinking of your meals as recipes, focus on your main food groups. I usually try to have a protein, a carb and a veggie and/or fruit in every meal. I try to keep individual frozen portions of chicken breast, pork loin, steaks, and ground beef for protein, beans, rice, tortillas and noodles for carbs, a few different kinds of frozen veggies, and then I also buy fresh veggies each week. I also have a well-stocked spice cabinet (find a store with a bulk section, or try an ethnic market in your town for the best prices) and try to keep fresh garlic and onion around. With these sorts of things to stock your cabinet you can actually make a wide variety of dishes with just 1 or 2 additional ingredients. For example in the past week I've made chicken tacos (chicken breast + seasonings + onions + peppers + lettuce wrapped up), pan seared pork loin with roasted green beans and garlic bread, strip steak in a red wine reduction sauce with roasted asparagus and black beans, and chicken alfredo pasta with broccoli. All of these were made with the addition of a small handful ingredients (mostly fresh vegetables) on top of the stuff I buy on sale and stock up on. For meats I just wrap them up in saran wrap and freeze them in individual portions, so I only thaw out what I'm using. All of these meals were made for <$5/person, most of them about half of that. They are also better tasting and healthier than you are going to get at most places."

budgetfood,2j2tno,DaemonXI,2,Mon Oct 13 03:34:14 2014 UTC,Yeah Føtex are a bit more pricey than discount shops. I think 22% fat is fine in some dishes like bolognese and the likes.

Put frozen peas into rice until they are cooked. Add some herbs, lots of salt and pepper. Drain rice. Add rice to pan with the chicken. Stir. Enjoy.   Ginger Thai chicken   Get a large pan or wok very hot with vegetable oil. Add chopped spring onions (scallions), onions, garlic and grated ginger. Add noodles 2 minutes later. EDIT: Chinese style soft noodles, not pasta. Add chicken. Add pepper. Done. Enjoy.   Chicken noodle soup   Add the chicken carcass to a large pot of simmering water (NOT boiling). Add chopped carrots, celery, onion. Leave for 3 hours just barely bubbling. Remove the chicken and take the remaining meat off. Chop the meat into small bits and put into the pan. Add a small amount of cornflour and stir for 5 minutes. Add pepper, salt, ground parsley/thyme and noodles or pasta twirls. Simmer for 5-10 minutes until the pasta is cooked to your liking. Enjoy."

budgetfood,2j2tno,fatcatsinhats,2,Mon Oct 13 02:40:15 2014 UTC,"A whole chicken is one of the most economical meats available. It's great how many meals you can get out of it!  Pork belly chops are also pretty cheap and a great source of energy due to the fatty meat.  You can pick up 4 for about £3/$4, then just make some mashed potatoes with gravy and add sweetcorn or peas. There you go: a very filling meal for 2 for £4/$5 or so.  These days I cook more expensive meals than I used to because I'm on a good wage now, but when I was skint I would have to find creative ways to eat with very little money. Some weeks I'd have to survive on only £10 but I'd always manage.  I think an important thing is to ensure you have staples like bread, potatoes, rice, pasta, butter and salt/pepper to make bland ingredients taste better. Canned fish like tuna is also very useful."

Breakfast/postworkout: 1/2 container of cottage cheese with 1 tbsp of strawberry jam mixed in   Lunch/Dinner/Preworkout:  1.5 cups of rice or pasta, 8 oz chicken, can of spinach, some kind of sauce (tomato, terriyaki, etc.)  Normally I just cook the chicken by tossing 8-12 breasts in the crockpot with basic seasonings (salt and pepper) and cook on low for 8 hours.  Then I shred it and store it.  I make rice and pasta in bulk too so when I'm ready to eat I just put chicken and rice or pasta in a bowl with some kind of veggie and whatever sauce I'm in the mood for so it's a little different each time.

Cooked black beans with onion butter, chilli powder and cumin. So good.   I think if you look for cheap sources of protein it will fill the hubby but cut the grocery bill.

It can even be bulked up with the addition of egg noodles. Buy a can of coconut milk and curry paste, mix those together and cook on the stove according to the given instructions then toss shredded chicken in. If you have the extra cash, spend $1 on some red cabbage, and stir that in as well. Let it cook down and serve over rice. Shred chicken and toss with mayo, salt, black pepper, diced apple, Dijon mustard, honey, golden raisins, and walnuts. This last recipe isn't cheap, but it's an easy way to turn mundane chicken into a jazzy dish. I like to serve this chicken salad on toasted challah bread with arugula or spinach."

budgetfood,2iz2e6,loveshercoffee,1 point,Sun Oct 12 11:57:56 2014 UTC,"I know it's kind of a bit more than many people want or have time to do, but could you make your own tortillas? They'd probably be too big a pain to do every time you wanted a burrito, but if you made a small batch of 8 at once, I'm sure it would be less expensive and you don't need any special tools. The lovely thing about tortillas is that you can use any cheap flour and any cheap fat in them and they come out nice.  If you had an afternoon free, you could cook up your own dried beans, portion them out and freeze them to use as needed. They are sooooo much cheaper than canned.   You could probably even make the entire filling and freeze it, then just make a batch of tortillas as needed."

While the stuff that already comes formed inside the pan isn't the best tasting stuff, where I live it is really cheap.  Plus, now this is just me personally, I'm not really a fan of pie crust to begin with, it's more about the filling to me and the crust just serves as the element that holds everything together.  So having just an ""ok"" pie crust is no big deal to me, personally.  Also, for some people making pie dough is no big deal, personally I have fun making it from time to time, but then there are other people I know, such as my mother, who doesn't enjoy making it (or cooking in general) at all.  For her even though making a pie crust is no big deal to others, it's a major ordeal that stresses her out so much that she wouldn't even consider making something that involves making pie crust (she's tightly wound and stresses easily)  I guess what I'm trying to say is that I do agree with you that pie crust isn't a big deal to make, however, for some, it's something that's just a hassle and even crosses into becoming a burden for them.

budgetfood,2itc0h,OhYeahThat,6,Fri Oct 10 11:46:43 2014 UTC,My best tip for cleaning as you go is to fill your sink with hot water and soap BEFORE you start cooking.  Make it a rule!  It's so much easier to stay on top of the dishes after that.
budgetfood,2itc0h,g1i,3,Fri Oct 10 13:06:53 2014 UTC,"It gets easier with time. It also helps if you prep first, and rinse / clean as you assemble stuff. If you're rushing to get stuff done and not prepping, you'll never clean as you go.  Aim for simple dishes (ingredient and technique-wise), and either make certain things ahead, or buy pre-assembled stuff. Like bagged salads, bake at home breads, etc. they aren't always easy on the budget, but if you make a huge salad for the week, you can dish out a few plates each night.  For some classic one-pot meals, I especially love pot roast. It requires lean, tough cuts of meat which are typically cheaper to buy.  Chili, gumbo, potato soup, and barley stews are all great meals that are pretty easy on the wallet. Pair with a salad and you're good to go. I also live love how good they are next day, too.  Edit: Can't deal with typos."

You have to watch the food! Over time and depending on the recipe it gets easier to do. It also helps to have a limited supply of dishes, if you are inclined, as I am, to use many when you could reuse a few throughout the process. It's so much more fun to end up with a nice meal and not have a zillion dishes and cleanup. Also, Delegate if you can."

budgetfood,2itc0h,HtlrLuvsJuice,3,Sun Oct 12 17:16:07 2014 UTC,Just a suggestion to who ever. You may want to drain the fat off the beef. Im not big into the greasy flavor it adds.
budgetfood,2itc0h,locolarue,2,Fri Oct 10 03:22:48 2014 UTC,"Yeah, this particular recipe is the only one I don't drain the fat off of, as the electric frying pan is too bulky to manoeuvre round. Sometimes I soak the bulk of the fat up with a couple of paper towels."

First I fry 1/2 lb of spicy ground sausage, 1/2 lb of diced smoked sausage or kielbasa and 1/2 pound of chicken livers but I do omit this sometimes.   I add a bunch of finely diced onion (it calls for 1/2 an onion but I just do what feels right) same with a green pepper. Sometimes throw in a red pepper if I have it.    A couple stalks of celery.    Cook until soft and maybe gets some brown on.   Add 2 cups of rice.   2 cups-ish of chicken broth.    Some cayenne, garlic powder, salt and pepper or creole/ Cajun seasoning.   Cover and cook until rice is done.   Fluff up.   Add 1/2 cup-ish chopped fresh parsley.   Taste.   Adjust seasoning.   If you have a rice cooker you can make the rice in that and add to the pot with the parsley.  But that defeats the purpose of 1 pot."

Rice, garlic, onion, red pepper flakes, parsley, white wine, chicken broth, shrimp, scallops, peas... Dollop of butter and a handful of Parmesan cheese.   Probably costs me $15-$20 to make, serves 4-6.   Other then that, definitely chili, chicken & orzo soup, sausage & pepper sandwiches ..  I also love to get spicy ground Italian sausage, brown it, throw in some pepper & onion, then dice up sweet potatoes & russet potatoes and bake until potatoes are done. Then crack a couple eggs on top and bake again until they're cooked to your likeness. Delicious with a little Sriracha on the side!

The thing is, I have made a variation of this one dish meal a couple of times and the pasta always gets pastey and gooey.

budgetfood,2itc0h,dsrtwhlr,2,Fri Oct 10 02:34:21 2014 UTC,"That means the pasta is sitting in water for too long. I had that happen when I'd microwave a big thing of pasta and then forget about it for five minutes. Gross, gross, gross. Finally figured it out."

I would guess that adding the pasta later could reduce mushiness, but would it reduce the thickness of the soup.   You claim to be a good pasta chef so I trust you know what you are doing; I mostly wing it."

budgetfood,2itc0h,theryanmoore,2,Fri Oct 10 10:58:36 2014 UTC,"Soup. My favourite these days has been butternut squash (or pumpkin, or another gourd that you prefer). If you have an immersion blender or food processor, that will help. This soup is alright chunky, but it's fucking mindblowing when it's creamy and smooth.  Ingredients :  one large squash 2 onions garlic, as you like (I would even use a whole head) fresh ginger (a tablespoon or more) apples (or apple butter) coconut milk or coconut cream (one can) cinnamon pumpkin spice blend (or the spices in it) turmeric coriander basil cayenne (if you like it hot) salt black pepper coconut oil or butter   Chop onions and garlic and caramelize in coconut oil in the pot you are going to cook the soup in.  Boil water in a kettle if you have one, or you can have a pot with water boiling in it while the caramelizing is going on. A pot of water isn't technically dirty when you're done with it, so this can still count as a one dish meal. If you truly want it all in one pot, you can peel and chop the squash into cubes. I like to half or quarter it, slather it in oil and cinnamon and bake it in the oven. It takes ~30 min+ to bake, depending on your oven.  Add squash, boiling water, ginger, and spices to pot. If you are using fresh apples, add these also. Bring to a rolling boil and cook until the squash is breaking apart. If you're using apple butter, add it once soup starts lookin' like soup. When it's tasting how you want it and is cooked enough, reduce heat and add coconut milk.  I hope you have an immersion blender, cause you're gonna need to blend the everloving shit out of this amazing soup in order to get the full effect."

I put 2 cups of brown rice, 1 14 oz can of those ""recipe starters"" sauces, and 1 can of water in a big rectangular glass casserole dish. Stir them all together, so the rice is pretty evenly distributed. Then put about 6 or 7 thawed or fresh chicken breasts right on top of it all, and get at least a little of the liquid on top of the meat. Bake for an hour at 350, and there is half a meal for at least a week.   I made some cut up roasted root veggies and a big squash in another dish of the same size, coated in a bunch of pumpkin spices, turmeric, salt and pepper and juuust enough oil to make the spices stick, baked at the same temp as the chicken but finished at 400 for an extra 15 mins. Ok, you need a mixing bowl, a cutting board and a knife for this part, but its an easy cleanup while everything is cooking. Best part, once it is cooled, you only need cling wrap to store it all.

I camp a lot.  It's a challenge, but if you put a big pot/pan off to one side of the burner/fire you can treat it like a wok or a griddle where you have different heat zones. I guess stir fry is the basic underlying technique, but I cook a lot of stuff that's just oil of some sort (coconut is killer if you're cool with the taste), add the meat and vegetables in order of how long they take to cook, salt and pepper, splash of vinegar and maybe sugar/agave, maybe some hot sauce, and you're golden. Doesn't always look brilliant, but works well for paleo style stuff that's about 3/4 veg 1/4 meat. Huck in some spinach and basil right at the end, maybe some cilantro or green onions depending on the components, and you're golden. I just use whatever vegetables are around, doesn't really matter as long as you know how long they take, that's the key to avoid over/undercooked ingredients once you kill the heat."

Each serving (not including your vehicle of delivery to your belly) comes out to about 200 calories! Super awesome!  It's important that you wait until your avocados are ripe, other wise, they won't mix up well and your egg salad will be chunky. Unless you're into that kind of thing... ;D"

budgetfood,2ikpa7,Cendeu,2,Tue Oct 7 21:41:00 2014 UTC,"For what it's worth, those eggs are cheap due to federal subsidy. Pushing for the same for small farmed ethical production would be the way for this to happen.  Or shop local at a farmers market. If avocados go for that cheap, you likely have some good egg vendors too. May be a buck or two more, but the eggs are also much better tasting if the chickens eat a proper free range diet."

I'm not against supporting free ranged product if it's competitive (not even cheap as or cheaper) but $5-8 a dozen? It's the same reason I don't buy starbucks coffee or the ""organic"" milk. I just can't afford to uphold the amount of consumption that my household goes through with the rate of the products."
budgetfood,2ikpa7,Dmanator,2,Wed Oct 8 03:54:04 2014 UTC,"If you get the chance, make friends with a farmer. Organic/free range/small farm eggs are $8 a dozen where I lived as well which is simply more than I can afford while making minimum wage when there are options that are only $1.25 a dozen.   I did make friends with a farmer though and was able to get 18 eggs for $4. Not as cheap but certainly reasonable and fresh eggs taste soooo much better! (note, they require a little more work if you plan on baking with them. The whites don't whip as well and the yolks are not always uniform in size. Usually the yolks also have a stronger color which can tint your product.)"

Italian-seasoned breadcrumbs 1 egg, beaten Mushrooms, tomatoes, onions - all finely chopped; I use about 1/2 c. each of the first two, and 1/4 of the purple onions Seasonings of your choice (I use 1 T. + 1 t. seasoned salt, and 1 t. garlic powder) 1/2 c. finely-chopped black olives (canned are preferable, for this)    Instructions:  1) Slice into quartered rounds and boil the squash for about 10 mins. (or shred and boil); brown the beef in oil while this is going on - it's ok to mix in the veggies (except olives) while sautéeing the meat, and I actually think this makes it better. Season meat/veggies while sautéeing.  2) Drain the squash and mash it with a fork until it's a pulpy consistency, unless you shredded it - in which case, can skip that part. Let the beef and squash cool to room temperature.  3) Mix everything together except the olives, and put in a 8x12 or 9x13 greased oblong casserole dish.  4) Top with the chopped olives.

We have our own gardens & tons of farms all around that would suddenly need a new place to sell their crops. Have chickens & turkeys to hunt/raise. Deer everywhere to hunt.  We can & freeze a bunch of produce every year already, so we just ramp that up. I'd start spending on cattle to process also.  More money would be spent on freezers & canning. Thankfully we have the room.  We canned something like 10 bushels of beans this year alone, so I think I could get by. Most difficult thing would be losing access to rice.

budgetfood,2ii5yt,crazybouncyliz,13,Tue Oct 7 12:31:35 2014 UTC,"Several months. I overbuy pantry and freezer staples, and don't feel like cooking what I have, sometimes.  Instead, I end up buying what I ""want"" to cook.  I'm not one of those coupon hoarders by any means, but overbuying is a terrible habit.    I read this reddit to help break myself of these bad habits, and because I'm also wasteful, and I hate that about myself.  Like forgetting about the onion I sliced for a sandwich and that bag of spinach I bought for smoothies until both are spoiled.  I'm also the queen of waiting too long to slice an avocado.  Do'h!  Spoiled!  I noticed this really began when I was at a very high stress job, and, when I'd leave the office, I'd stop at the store and mill about, shopping for dinner even if I didn't need to. I realized this was a ""break"" between my day job and the evening shift of all my responsibilities at home.  It was pleasurable to walk the aisles of the store with nothing more involved than ""chicken or fish?  Oh, hey, this new product looks interesting.""   It was relaxing.  As soon as I gave up my parking space at work to devote time to walk to and from work, I stopped doing this because now I'd have to come home, get in my car, and drive to the store. I seldom wanted to do that once I was home, so just breaking the ""5:00 errand habit"" was great.   I still overbuy when I DO go to the store, though.  That's the next habit to break.  Every year I go on a ""use it up"" phase where I only permit myself to purchase dairy products and produce, and everything else has to come from the freezer or pantry.  Time to do that again right about now."

So that, plus our freezer full of meat and because our recent splurge at Costco... I would estimate about 5 weeks.

Nido can cost as much as milk equivalent if you buy it locally in a south american grocer where it's popular.    eggs by me have >month good till use date, so i do finish them before they get to spoil.    eggs can keep longer if you lightly spray them all around with cooking oil.  lightly spray the dozen, flip all eggs over in the carton, then spray again. do this when you first get them to add 33% more fridge life."

I freaking love egg fried rice and eat it several times a week. Super, super simple dish. Sometimes I fry chicken in another pan and stick it in the mix, other times I just put sriracha on the rice and chow.

We usually make more rice than two people could eat for one meal, and use the rest to make some easy fried rice.   Here is the recipe I've used if you are like me and need measurements (I'm always afraid I'm going to screw it up without them). The best part is you can mix and match whatever veggies/meat you have, I've thrown in green peppers, shrimp, chicken, carrots, frozen peas, whatever."
budgetfood,2ibyly,Athilda,11,Sun Oct 5 23:04:40 2014 UTC,"Here's the secret tip that no one's mentioning:  Asian food is, by and large, relatively simple to cook.  There's some exceptions of course, but by-and-large, it is rather easy to cook  most Asian cuisine.  The big secret?  Spend time ahead of turning on the stove/fire preparing as much as you can.  Read and re-read the recipe and ensure you have everything ready and at your fingertips because (and again, there's exceptions to the rule, but...) generally Asian food cooks very quickly and if you have to pause to chop up onions,  the rest of the dish will get too soft or overcooked and leading to an inferior dish.  I would encourage you to get fish sauce, coconut milk (NO sugar added!), galangal (aka blue ginger), lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves.  A bottle of fish sauce will last a very long time!  For a long time, my daughter was using it instead of soy sauce on her rice and even so it took at least six months to go through the bottle!  Since she's out of that habit now, it takes a year!  It's also inexpensive.  Coconut milk can be made by hand, but it is a laborious process and it is probably cheaper in most places to buy it canned.    The galangal, lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves are best fresh, of course, but can also be found frozen or dried.  Avoid the galangal powder unless you can't get it any other way.  Sometimes it is called ""Laos powder"".  I have had good luck using dried slices of galangal and the dried kaffir lime leaves are also useful.  Both must be rehydrated with hot water for at least 10 minutes for best effect.  Anyway,  the inclusion of these ingredients to your pantry will open a wide variety of recipes for you!    Another ingredient to get is Holy Basil, or Thai Basil.  There are lots of greens in Asian cuisine that we don't see too much of here in the West, but there are some reasonable substitutes.    Good luck on your journey!  You are in for a great experience.  Just remember to have fun with it and not get too stressed.  Oh, one last thing:  shrimp paste is only for die-hard fans.  If strong odors are a big deal to anyone in your family (and indeed, anyone living within a quarter mile of your kitchen window)  it may be best to pass on any recipe that requires ""shrimp paste"".  You've been warned! :)  PS: My solemn apologies to anyone who adores shrimp paste."

budgetfood,2ibyly,Shnoox,5,Mon Oct 6 03:12:32 2014 UTC,"Sumo soup (chanko nabe) is one of my favorites and is a great way to use up bits of leftover ingredients from other stuff. There's no set recipe for it. It's more of the Japanese version of ""baby, you got a stew going"".  It's super easy to make. Get a pot of miso or dashi going (I think dashi is lower in salt). Both are cheap. I like to throw in udon noodles first. Then take any and all of the following things and arrange them in clumps on the surface of the broth.  -wontons / dumpings   -tofu  -sliced (pre-cooked is safest) meat or fish  -carrots  -mushrooms  -daikon  -bak choi  -scallions  -sugar snap peas  -fish cakes  -edamame (we usually have a frozen bag of them, mostly to have as snacks)  -Broccoli  -green beans  Honestly, whatever you're into or have lying about. I like to crack a couple of eggs into the broth too. Garnish with seaweed for fanciness.   Serve the whole pot on the centre of the table and let people take what they fancy. It's a popular dinner in my house and I think it's probably the healthiest thing we eat. Low fat, high protein, lots of veg. Uses up odds and ends that wouldn't make a coherent meal otherwise very nicely.  Edit: just to be clear, I don't mean pre-cooked meat in the sense that you bought it cooked.

budgetfood,2ibyly,rybi,6,Mon Oct 6 01:51:53 2014 UTC,"Peanut Noodles  Ingredients   6 oz of thin spaghetti (Angel Hair also works) 6 tablespoons creamy peanut butter 2 teaspoons garlic powder juice of 1 lime 4 tablespoons soy sauce 1.5 tablespoons spicy sesame oil (you can use regular sesame oil just add some red pepper flakes) 16 oz  mixed Asian vegetables    Steps   Set the pasta to cook and steam the Asian vegetables until cooked.  The best way to make sure the sauce is evenly distributed across the whole dish is to make the sauce in the bowl that you will be serving the pasta in and simply add the cooked pasta to the already made sauce rather than adding the sauce to the pasta. In the large bowl combine the peanut butter, garlic, lime juice, soy sauce and sesame oil. Whisk vigorously until the mixture is combined.  Once the pasta is cooked, slowly add it to the bowl of sauce, about 1/3 of the pasta at a time to ensure that it is properly coated by the sauce. Once all the pasta has been added then add the cooked vegetables."

budgetfood,2ibyly,cupcakewrangler,2,Mon Oct 6 01:54:37 2014 UTC,"I just made a yummy, Asian-inspired salad with only a few ingredients, so it was easy to prepare and relatively inexpensive.    Simply dice a few kirby cucumbers, mix with a splash of soy sauce, sriracha, sesame oil, chopped scallion, and a pinch of sugar. You could even include rice wine vinegar to achieve a more pickled flavor. This is a nice, palate cleansing side dish to accompany your meal.     For something a little more substantial, use the aforementioned ingredients (sans cucumber) as well as garlic powder & onion powder to marinate anything from chicken to pork to steak to tofu. These flavors take well to the grill, so if you have access to one, definitely try it out."

budgetfood,2i9pa2,maohaze,72,Sat Oct 4 11:26:28 2014 UTC,"These see the shiny skin and the bright green color? These avocados are likely Hall or Choquette.  They do not have the rich, buttery texture that you expect from a ripe Hass.  They are fantastic for baby food.  You can peel and dice, mash and season, freeze in ice cube trays, and have a high-quality, high-nutrition baby food ready any time you like.  These avos are good for salads, where a creamy dressing will help hide the more watery texture.   These avos are also very good for sandwiches expecially where cheese and mayo are being employed.  They're a VERY good avo for BLTAs, for example.  These avos can be used to make soup!  Check around, there's quite a few fantastic avo soup recipes,  many are served chilled, but some are warm, too.  Lots of variety there.  LASTLY,  try grilling these.   Get your grill medium hot, cut in half, lightly brush the cut surface with some oil to minimize sticking,  DO NOT remove the skin,  place cut side down, and give them 5-10 minutes to get hot all the way through.

budgetfood,2i7x5q,username-rage,1 point,Sat Oct 4 02:01:59 2014 UTC,"Uhhhhh well you have nothing with banana so far, what gives? derp, didn't see the peanut butter one.   Banana and cinnamon is a classic. Plain ol' maple syrup and milk is my all time favourite. Another good one is toasted sesame seeds, almonds and dried figs, with optional yoghurt and honey. Num num. I like to cook the fruit into the oatmeal instead of putting it raw on top. You can do this with any fruit, banana, apricot, peach, strawberry are all ones I love. Personally I don't like it with apples cooked by this method as it makes them slimy for some reason, I like to either pre-cook the apples first or have them raw.  I cook it with the fruit and water then add some milk towards the end when it's starting to stick to the pan. The milk cools it down and allows it to keep cooking and makes it creamy without feeling like you're eating a whole bowl of milk which is too rich for me."

budgetfood,2i6dy8,FrugalRoots,9,Fri Oct 3 20:47:07 2014 UTC,"Chili, especially if you've already got the beans.  It's pretty cheap and you can really stretch it out.  Here's how I do mine, if you're interested.  I didn't include quantities in here, because it's all variable.  Generally, i use about a pound of meat, and 4-6 oz. each of kidney beans and black beans.  For that amount, I go with 2 tbsp of cumin, 2 tsp of coriander, 1 tsp cinnamon, and then add Chili Powder and Cayenne Pepper to get the desired heat.  This scales up or down pretty easily.   The night before, soak your beans in a bowl of water (if you're using dry beans.  If you use them from a can, ignore all this and just put them right into the chili.)  Before you start putting the chili together, boil the beans for 20-30 mins.  I usually go for an equal mix of black beans and kidney beans, but this works with pretty much whatever beans you want.  First I mix all my spices- usually a fair amount of Cumin, some Coriander, ground peppercorn, a small amount of Cinnamon, salt (not too much), and Chili Powder and Cayenne Pepper to taste.  Brown some ground turkey (healthy/cheaper option) or ground beef.  Add some of the spice mixture and mix well.  In a large pot, I melt about 2 tbsp butter (or coconut oil) and add a diced yellow onion and a few cloves of garlic.  You can also add some chili peppers, but if you're trying to keep the cost down you can go without them.  Once those are sweated out a bit, add some more of the spice mixture, and mix in the meat that you just browned.  Add your beans now.  If you're using canned beans, make sure to drain them first.  Finally, add about one jar of Tomato Sauce and the rest of your spice mixture, and a bay leaf if you have one.  Mix well and let it simmer.    Check regularly, and start tasting after it's been simmering for a few minutes.  If it's getting too dry, add some tomato sauce.  Add more spices as needed.  You can also throw in a little dark chocolate if you want, but it's not necessary.  Let the whole thing simmer for at least 90 minutes- the longer the better- tasting regularly.   When it's ready, I like to grate some cheddar on top and serve with sour cream and tortilla chips, but that's not really necessary.  It makes a great meal just as it is.    The whole thing should be around $10 or less, and you can easily get 8-10 meals out of it, especially if you're also eating a starch like rice with it."

Simmering them for a long time with your basic carrots onions and celery gets a great dish started. Paired with a grain like quinoa or cous-cous (which you can sometimes get ridiculously cheap), it makes a hearty grain-and bean meal. I know you're eating a lot of those right now, so it might get old too, but it'll at least taste different than beans and rice.   When you're a little more in the flush, I find that lentils and a mustard-based dressing can really add a hearty feel to salads. Try spinach with some almonds, avocado, and lentils with that mustard dressing. Very fatty and filling for a salad (obviously the 'cado is more expensive, but anything with a thick texture works, like cubes of sautéed mushrooms or even some meat)."

budgetfood,2i6dy8,turk1559,3,Sun Oct 5 00:18:14 2014 UTC,"Nothing like my grandmas :/  But i use a cup of pinto beans, soak that over night or for little over 12 hours. Put the beans in the crock pot with ""enough water (i dont know exactly how much i add, but enough so that the water doesn't boil out)and put it on high and wait 4 hours.  30 minutes before the beans are nearly done cooking, i put a cup of rice with 1 + 2/3rds a cup of water into the rice maker and .. well, turn it on.  That's about it! But i use tony chachere's.. granted, it's been ""cheapened"" over the years and now it contains lot more salt than ever before, but i still like it. Also, some black pepper and other assorted spices i experiment with, but can't recommend.  But yeah, this makes enough for me to eat for the entire day. It's like eating the food of the gods for me, but something just ticks in me to where i go ""Ugh, i can't be eating this every day"".  __  All in all, 2 pounds of pinto beans is like 7 bucks, rice is enough 7~ish, this is enough to feed me for nearly a month, but i can't recommend. I do supplement my diet it with instant noodles, eggs and other stuff."

That'll give you an entire chicken's worth of meat to make meals with, so 2 breasts, 2 thighs, 2 drumsticks, 2 wings. You can eat them straight up with rice or whatever, or you can shred it and add it to thing. You should be able to get at least one sandwich worth of chicken salad out of the pickings left on the carcass. Then there's the carcass (and backbone) that you can use to make broth with, which happens to be wonderful for making rice and beans!"

I planted green onions seeds about three years ago in my yard in the midwestern US and they have survived all the winter since then. I just go out and pick how much I need to cook and leave the rest in the ground. They will begin to seed themselves and you've got a nice mix-in for ramen then. Maybe drop an egg in as the water is boiling and you've got a descent meal.

South West does have a market advantage in grains, roots, beef products and during the winter and early spring when most of our produce has to come from Peru and Chile.  our low cut beef is regional, but much of the better cuts come frozen from Australia and Argentina, as restaurants buy up most of the quality local cuts.  since you are coastal, we probably also have some advantages in fish and seafood particularly with our major asian customer base.  is organic well served South West?  here in NYC it's a major racket."

budgetfood,2i5cb4,johnnysurfacepickles,4,Fri Oct 3 01:24:37 2014 UTC,"Gotcha. $150-$50 for the Con=  $100 food budget;)  I would stick to non-prepared foods such as rice, beans, fresh produce, etc. Prepared meals can be  expensive and so can freezer meals, so a 'slow diet' is the way to go in my opinion.  Whole roasted chicken is a great move.... you might even use it to make sandwiches instead of using sliced meat from the store (which can be relatively expensive). Eggs are great for breakfast or for making an egg salad sandwich. Pasta with tomato sauce is a great meal when living on a fixed budget too.     Since you are a student, I am sure can find a few 'free pizza if you help us make posters' sort of meals during the month. Try and seek out free campus meals whenever you can and you will save money.  I wouldn't go to the store and buy $100 of food all at once. Instead, I would budget about $50 for the big trip you are planning tomorrow. Buy chicken, rice, vegetables and fruit on sale, etc. Pick up oil, salt, sugar, flour, etc. if you need them. Before you head to the store, check out the sales flyers for a couple stores in your area. You can save a lot of money by dividing your shopping trip between two stores. You would be amazed at how food pricing can vary from store to store. For instance, one store by me was selling a single lemon for $1, while the store down the street was selling 4 lemons for $0.99. daa Fuck??"

I don't know where you live, but look up the stores near you and see if they post sales fliers online. I live in the Midwest, and most of the stores near me will post their weekly sales online. Read all the fliers and see what meats are cheap; then buy a bunch of those and freeze most of it, so it can last you through the month.  You mentioned buying bread -- bread actually freezes pretty damn well, so if you eat about a loaf per week, buy four and freeze three of them.  Also, you won't find prices as posted these days, but this can be a very helpful link for making a bunch of meals on the cheap: http://www.aturtleslifeforme.com/2011/06/freezer-meals-on-cheap.html.

You can replace the Vegan milk and butter with regular and it'll still work, though taste may be slightly different. I think I'd actually like to try this with almond milk some day.

budgetfood,2hmmit,newttle,0,Sun Sep 28 07:39:59 2014 UTC,They should probably be closer to room temperature. You want to add just a little bit of the warm liquid at a time and stir like hell so it doesn't cook the egg. If you have a stick blender or a regular blender set to low it will probably be easier to make it that way so you don't have to concentrate on mixing it as you're adding your broth to temper the eggs. You might try using a measuring cup to add the broth so you can get a steady stream.

It's more efficient and it means you're not buying ready meals on the way home because there's nothing in the fridge. Also: oatmeal. It's ridiculously cheap, is filling and healthy - the perfect budget food.  I don't generally keep a lot of fridge food. Eggs, milk and bacon or ham, a bit of cheese to grate on stuff, whatever meat I've taken out of the freezer for tomorrow and maybe a jar of mayo. Root veg like onions and carrots keep a long time and are very useful. But really I'm more a freezer person: meat, bought in bulk and portioned out into takeaway containers, bags of corn and peas and broccoli and cabbage, and a couple of ready meals or frozen leftovers for nights I'm too tired to cook. But your food cupboard is where the real fun's at. With lots of spices and sauces, you can spin a dozen variations on the same basic ingredients."

I should be buying the biggest package I can and freezing what I can't use right away. Super helpful right there.  Oatmeal isn't a bad idea either.

budgetfood,2hjt9c,ihearttardis,2,Sat Sep 27 00:58:06 2014 UTC,"No problem. Perhaps you might try buying a whole roasted chicken from the supermarket or local store. A whole chicken provides enough meat for a week, reheats well in the microwave, stores well in the fridge, and is actually cheap when you consider how many meals you get out of the bird (its about $6 for one in my local supermarket). Saves you a lot of cooking time too. From here, I would place a few other prepared ingredients in tupperware such as rice, mashed potato, blanched string beans, sliced lemon, mustard, etc. When reheating, just add a bit of water to the tupperware and you should be good to go....and Voila, a cheap and healthy meal!  In terms of freezing prepared foods, I would stay away from this if you want to eat meals that do not turn dry. When you freeze food, the water within the food turns to ice, and these ice crystals burst the cells open. When reheated in the microwave, these damaged cells loose all their moisture. Thus, you end  up eating dry meals, especially when it comes to chicken. Instead, prepare a few meals at a time (or perhaps for the week in one go) and store your meals in the fridge. Since you aren't freezing the food, it won't turn dry. Lowering the power of the microwave can help too."

budgetfood,2hdjhz,DHamson,3,Wed Sep 24 22:42:05 2014 UTC,"Poundland and Iceland are cheap but the selection and quality is poor, especially Poundland. Can you find yourself a Lidl or Aldi? The next rung up is probably Tesco, a better selection but it's not quite as cheap. If you have a freezer and a decently sharp knife you could look into buying whole chickens etc and portioning them out. Also the times vary from store to store but stock that's about to go out of date gets marked down at the end of the day, buy and stick them in the freezer when you get home. (Once, many years ago now, I was in Tescos late on Christmas eve, and there were vast piles of food all marked down to 10p, it was glorious.)"
budgetfood,2hdjhz,sennalvera,1 point,Wed Sep 24 23:09:46 2014 UTC,Lidl and Aldi seem to out of reach but I actually literally live inside of a super Tesco. The prices do seem to be a bit higher than I'm used to but based on the fact that it made your list I imagine it's simply the exchange rate from USD to GBP that's killing me. Would finding a local butcher be any cheaper do you think?
budgetfood,2hdjhz,sennalvera,1 point,Wed Sep 24 23:18:42 2014 UTC,"It depends on the butcher but generally not, supermarkets can negotiate wholesale deals that small sellers can't match. And as a rule grocery prices are always going to be higher here. I don't know why, I think it's to do with your farm subsidies in the US, but your food is a good bit cheaper than ours is. (However we do have better chocolate.)"

budgetfood,2hak0c,r3dast3rik09,6,Wed Sep 24 02:40:41 2014 UTC,"5 chicken thighs ($3.50) 5 chicken drumsticks ($2.85) 1 green bell pepper and 1 red bell pepper ($1.00)  8 oz sliced mushrooms ($1.50) 1 yellow onion ($0.33) 4 cloves garlic ($0.10) 5 Roma tomatoes ($1.00) 2/3 jar Trader Joe's marinara (or whatever you like) ($1.79 for the jar, so $1.19 for this amount) salt, pepper, seasonings ($0.10) EVOO ($0.15) 3/4 stick butter ($0.56) 1.25 lb penne rigate from TJ's ($1.25)    Wash chicken. I kept half of the skins on and half off, personal preference. Season with salt, pepper, EVOO and meanwhile, let a deep skillet heat up with some butter. I used 3/8 stick for the thighs and 3/8 for the drumsticks.  Brown the chicken, 7 minutes each side and set aside. Did this over medium heat. Meanwhile slice your onion thin, mince garlic, and dice your bell peppers and tomatoes.  Add some of your fat from skillet to a Dutch oven, with a bit of olive oil. Medium heat, first add garlic for a minute and then your mushrooms/onions. Let this cook till water out of the mushrooms and season with salt/seasonings. Took me like 8-10 min roughly.  Add your bell peppers, marinara, and tomatoes. Once this reduces and begins to bubble (5-10 min, I think), go ahead and add your chicken pieces to the pot. Cap it with a lid and put it on medium low heat for about 45 min. Everything should come together thoroughly. Sorry my cooking vocab is shitty but you get the idea.  Serve with pasta, I'm doing a thigh and drumstick with 1/2 cup cooked pasta and a ladle and change of your vegetables.  Feast and repeat! This will be dinner for me for the next 5 days!   Total comes out to I think $13.53. Since I'll be having this over the course of 5 meals, each serving is roughly $2.71 per."

Other meats are all over the spectrum, especially beef. With the low price chain (and big discount stores) pricing chicken breast at $1.99/lb, it's possible that the others were obligated to follow that pricing or lose business.

With this said, there are a number of ways to minimize the amount of money you spend on food:  1) Eat fresh foods instead of processed foods. Processed foods tend to cost more money. 2) Check out a number of markets in your area and compare prices. You would be amazed at the price difference of lemons from store to store. 3) Try and eat Italian inspired foods such as pasta, tomato sauce, etc. I found it much easier to make Italian recipes on a tight budget when compared to lets say, French cuisine. 4) For specific recipes, check out The Candy Algorithm."

(I live alone, this was enough for 3 days of breakfast, if you only eat one serving per sitting.)  1 yam or sweet potato (.50?) 1 apple of your choice (.30?) (I used Braeburn, a more tart one would be lovely too!) 1 half of an onion (.30) 4 strips of bacon (3.99 on sale)  Peel and dice spud, apple and onion, set aside. Dice bacon strips.Throw that pork in a frying pan and let it sizzle. Prepare a vessel lined with paper towels to drain the bacon chunks once they are done to your liking (but not super crispy). Set aside. Drain half of the bacon grease from the pan. Throw in your produce and sautée on medium heat. Realize you need more bacon once you see the ratio of meat to veg (it shrinks). Grab an additional frying pan and hurriedly cut 4 more strips of bacon with scissors. Cook 'em up good, and add them to the existing pile, while making sure the produce isn't burning. :)  Once your onions start to become translucent and the apple starts to sweat, turn up the heat to medium-high heat to get a good crispy exterior to your produce. The bacon/apple juice glaze compliments the potato really well. Reintroduce bacon into pan and heat through.  Realize you didn't add any seasonings. Sprinkle cinnamon on your pile of yum and stir to coat.  Scoop onto your plate, add a little dab of butter, and smile.  EDIT: Picture added.  http://i.imgur.com/VtclA6L.jpg"

budgetfood,2go71i,ethereal_pixie,14,Thu Sep 18 02:32:14 2014 UTC,"Here's the recipe (I doubled it to make enough for a few leftover lunches):  Ingredients   1 medium yellow squash $.89 1 medium zucchini $.89 1 medium potato ~$.45 1 medium tomato ~$.30 1/2 onion, diced ~$.40 1 tsp minced garlic (already had) salt and pepper to taste (already had) 1 c of your favorite shredded cheese (I used Italian blend) $1.00 thyme to taste (already had)   Directions   Start off by slicing up your veggies in relatively thin slices (not too thin)  In a skillet (after greasing with your favorite no calorie, non-stick spray) sauté up the onion and garlic for a few minutes. After the onions and garlic are a golden brown, put the mix in the bottom of a greased pan. The original recipe called for an 8x8 but I used what you see and it was perfect.  After this, stack the veggies in an alternating formation. Sprinkle your salt, pepper, and a generous amount of thyme on top before covering with tin foil and cooking for 30 minutes at 400º.  After they've cooked a bit, take it out, remove the foil and sprinkle your 1 cup of shredded cheese on top. Put it back in the oven for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. If you'd like to use less cheese to cut back on the calories that's totally fine, but as it stands, one serving is ~131 calories/$ .98 with the recipe yielding 4 servings.  As I mentioned earlier, I doubled the recipe so what you see pictured to your left is 8 servings. If it's a little too vegetable-y for you, you could also sprinkle a little bit of bread crumbs on top or add Italian seasoning as well though this dish is quite yummy as it is!

But in case you aren't, here is my general recipe:  Bottom layer (meat):   1-1.5 lbs ground beef some garlic, put through a garlic press (optional, but garlic is awesome) 1-2 chopped onions (optional as well, but onion + garlic = angels in the kitchen) 1 tablespoon flour a teaspoon or more of worcestershire sauce 1 can beef broth 1-2 tablespoons brown sugar 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar, balsamic's probably great as well. Optionally, you could substitute wine for this, although I'd remove the sugar and reduce the amount of beef broth you add. salt & pepper   This will allow it to hold together a little more than the traditional only-beef layer, and the worcestershire/vinegar/sugar will give it more complexity  2nd layer:   chopped carrots (lightly boiled, maybe 5 minutes) + frozen peas, can sub frozen chopped carrots if desired or virtually any other veg. Most people use corn, but I find it's lacking in flavor, color, and nutrition   3rd layer:   4 large potatoes of any variety 2 cloves of garlic, boiled whole (although without paper) with the potatoes mash that after it's cooked (garlic included! At this point it's lost all its dracula-chasing-breath) with enough milk to make it mashed-potatoey but not runny so you can still pile it on top of the dish butter to liking, a healthy 3 tablespoons or so. If unsalted, add ~1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 c parmesan   put the first layer in a casserole dish, followed by the veg, then the potatoes, garnish with paprika, then bake for ~30 min"

budgetfood,2ghju2,drewcrump,2,Mon Sep 15 21:03:13 2014 UTC,I like Kraft or Annie's for taste but I have had luck in the past mixing something richer in with a cheaper brand to make it more palatable!  Try sour cream if you like it or whole milk or even cream!  Otherwise donate the boxes and learn the lesson on what you like!
budgetfood,2ghju2,GypsyJune,2,Tue Sep 16 05:31:05 2014 UTC,Try using sour cream instead of milk. Completely changes the taste and it is delicious.
budgetfood,2ghju2,B00kk33per,6,Tue Sep 16 15:58:26 2014 UTC,"I feel the exact opposite. In fact I actually prefer their Kroger brand Mac and cheese to Kraft.   Now let's be clear, not talking about the super cheap brand. Kroger has three brand levels, the private selection brand is their top tier. Then Kroger brand. And then the bottom is value or something weird...  None of that stuff is any good. I generally like every Kroger brand I've purchased.   I saw another Kroger employee lower mention that the psst brand is the relabeled value brand...  Like I said before I've not found anything good in that brand  And I go out of my way for their boxed Mac and cheese. I find the Kraft tastes too fake and not like cheese at all..."

budgetfood,2ghju2,Benny0,1 point,Tue Sep 16 12:58:50 2014 UTC,I find them passable. Besides the savings here is relatively big percentage wise. But the cost is so low you might as well just buy kraft.

budgetfood,2ghju2,PacManDreaming,31,Mon Sep 15 20:14:43 2014 UTC,"I actually work for Kroger and can tell you this is pretty often true, but not always. A lot of the time the new low price sticker means that it is at a reduced retail for an extended period of time. I dislike this sign campaign though, because I do feel it is misleading.   On another note, the Psst label is exactly the same as kroger value, the only thing different is packaging. If you didn't like something when it was kroger value, don't buy it now that it is Psst thinking the formula might have changed.  I rarely buy Psst brand products, something is always off about them. Most of the time I just stick with Kroger brand because I get my 10% discount."
budgetfood,2ghju2,spokeymo,5,Mon Sep 15 20:26:16 2014 UTC,"I agree with this about the labeling, I work in produce at a Kroger and while often the ""new low price"" sticker means a higher price than before, I know that for example the avocados at my store got marked down to a lower price and now have those stickers."

I have yet to find something that was a lower price when those stickers are placed on the shelf. I usually buy my frozen vegetables at Kroger. The 12oz. bags went from .88 to $1.00, with some being $1.29. Guess what was placed on them every time the price went up? Same deal with everything I else I buy there on a weekly basis. I'm sure some things might have a lower price, but I haven't found them, yet.  I only go to Kroger's because it's close and because they carry Graeter's Ice Cream.

budgetfood,2ghju2,ThreeFistsCompromise,6,Mon Sep 15 23:59:22 2014 UTC,"The extra ""s"" is something more common in the naming of older restaurants, grocery stores, etc., which were named after the owner or family that ran the place. Think: McDonald's, Walgreens, Trader Joe's. These all refer to an actual person whose name is a part of the store's title, and it reflects that the business is theirs. The extra ""s"" refers to the possessive nature of the owner in relation to the store, and in this case it's a false addition (it's not ""Kroger's Store"")."
budgetfood,2ghju2,Gerbil_Juice,4,Tue Sep 16 02:44:27 2014 UTC,"I had a foreign boss before who added an S to names which didn't have one, like Krogers, Subways, and Wal Marts. For names ending in S, he added a ""the"" to the beginning and took off the S, for example The Walgreen, The McDonald, The Randall. I could never figure out if this was intentional rebellion against English, or just a second language quirk. He even did it to the name of the restaurant chain we worked for, so that made it all the more perplexing."

budgetfood,2gg03j,joethehoe27,3,Mon Sep 15 17:17:59 2014 UTC,"If you want to remain thrifty, costco or grocery store dried brands will work. In some cases, it can be cheaper to buy a grinder then roast and grind whole spices.  The 2nd option is almost always tastier but, in a pinch, store bought spices work fine. For every day cooking, I use cheaper, store-bought stuff but, if I was to have friends over or planned on making something special, I'd buy whole and roast/grind them myself. The only thing I'd really have to think about is saffron. If I was going to spend the time making a dish that highlighted saffron like a paella or something, I'd consider spending the cash on some good quality saffron.  The first thing you should have is a quality sea salt and a pepper grinder. The individual salt and pepper grinders work well too and they're relatively cheap. I bought a fine sea salt that is beginning to clump a bit so I might switch to a more granular version of it."
budgetfood,2gg03j,InertiaticFlow,2,Mon Sep 15 17:23:55 2014 UTC,"Costco has good spices, but spices have a shelf life and with the Costco spices you probably won't go through them fast enough.

budgetfood,2gg03j,mrm1776,1 point,Mon Sep 15 10:19:53 2014 UTC,"These are all very good suggestions. I would advise trying a little of each of them and see what works for you. For instance, growing a herb garden saves money and doesn't take a lot of space at all. You can grow many herbs in small pots - basil, cilantro, dill, etc. You can even make sure you always have green onions by growing them in shot-glasses on the window-sill. I assume that as a college student you have some shot glasses. I'm 26 and I still grow them in shot glasses.   If you live in a colder climate and your herbs are only plentiful during the short summer months, look into preserving them to last you all winter. You can make a basil- infused olive oil by laying your excess basil leaves in olive oil that will last you for months. You can even make your alcohol fancier - My excess mint leaves are currently floating around in a jar full of cheap, white rum to make mojito rum.   On that note, look into foods that can be used in multiple ways, to make other foods, or long-term meals that can be stored in the freezer to use as ingredients in your fancier endeavors. You can buy a tomato plant for cheap (I got a patio tomato plant for $10 that I never had to transfer or re-pot at all this season - just make sure it gets enough sun) and use it to make a simple tomato soup that can be eaten all by itself and used as a base for something else. My tiny patio plant got me six quarts this year!   Look for ways to use the ""whole"" of the ingredient you're cooking with. In the above-mentioned tomato soup, I included many of the green stems still attached to the tomato, which make for great flavor. Banana peels are actually edible (toss the entire banana into a smoothie), as are many other types of peels. I just recently learned that some people don't eat the skin of potatoes, which is crazy if you ask me.   Search online for things you  can make many meals out of. For example, you can buy a decent-sized whole chicken for cheap turn into a week's worth of meals. Cover it in olive oil and some herbs you grew on the deck, toss it in a pan on a bed of potatoes, carrots, onions and garlic (carrots and potatoes roughly chopped with  skins on) and save the onion and garlic peels. Roast it in the oven and have the vegetables, legs and wings for a meal. Maybe two meals. Carve the chicken and use the meat in whatever other meals you wish. Take the chicken bones, along with the onion and garlic peels, as well as some other simple ingredients and make a stock to be used as a base for many other, fancier meals.   The idea is use the food/ingredient as fully as possible, to cut down on costs of many ingredients you would use to make these fancier, more elaborate recipes. This is a skill will benefit you far into the future. I learned and mastered it while in the same position as you but still continue to cook this way, because, frankly, it's awesome. Good luck!"

The book is called Food That Works and will most likely be released this spring but definitely by fall 2015. There's a Kickstarter right now for bringing her book on the road in the spring to demonstrate her method but the book will be published regardless of whether or not she meets her goal. She has cool little menus in it and no ingredients go to waste. I'm particularly pumped because I'm intimidated by cooking in general so this is a friendly approach to it but it sounds like you are doing that already.   My advice in the meantime would be to get some recipes that have similar ingredients but use them differently so you're not eating the same thing over and over again. Freeze leftovers or extra that you make and you can eat it further down the line.

budgetfood,2gcppk,rave_kitty93,3,Sun Sep 14 07:05:06 2014 UTC,"I post this blog more often than any other. It has lots of great recipes and you can modify them to your needs. This is also a good blog. And this is a list of 9 blogs focusing on good food that doesn't break your wallet.   My boyfriend is British and only eats meat and a few veggies, I'm a vegetarian (for all practical purposes, I eat chicken about once a month) and love veggies and healthy eating. I've found that with creative thinking (and adapting recipes/separating ingredients within reason) it's easy to cook for people with two radically different sets of needs. I can buy groceries for both of us for a week for £25 sterling (that's about $40). I keep a stocked pantry (olive oil, herbs and spices, condiments, flour, rice, beans, tinned tomatoes, asian ingredients...) that I renew when necessary. The chinese/asian grocery down the road from me has a lot of really good cheap ingredients that allow me to make a variety of cheap and tasty meals. I also get fresh vegetables and supplies from the Turkish shop nearby. It's cheaper than the big chain stores. Farmer's markets are amazing if you have one in your area.   I found a free breadmaker on our local freecycle website, and I make my own bread for a fraction of what it would cost in a store.   A lot of celebrity chefs have cook books based around frugal cooking. Jamie Oliver, Delia Smith, Nigella Lawson... and most of the world has to survive on budgets much smaller than those we are used to in the west. I have, over the years, collected cookery books about chinese, mexican, north african, spanish, japanese, italian, indian, thai, and other kinds of foods from all around the world. Any culture with a vibrant street food culture and a rural population will have good, wholesome recipes made with cheap and fresh ingredients. I have collected most of my cookbooks from the UK equivalent of a garage sale and second-hand book stores and charity chops. Amazon often heavily discounts cook books, too.  Last tip, get some seeds and grow small pots of herbs on your windowsill. Fresh herbs will make your dishes come alive, and they are so cheap to grow.   TL;DR Do some research on the internet. Be creative. Be adaptable. Take advantage of ethnic grocery shops and farmer's markets. Make your own bread. Grow herbs. Enjoy the journey!"

budgetfood,2gaurr,wendytheroo,1 point,Sat Sep 13 22:24:12 2014 UTC,"I'm guessing, make stock as usual, remove some from the stock pot, replace what you took out with more water, resume simmering, take out more stock, replace what you took with water, Xinfinity, or until it gets too watered down"
budgetfood,2gaurr,roconoco,1 point,Sun Sep 14 19:10:24 2014 UTC,Exactly. I like to get at least three rounds out of each batch of bones but don't constantly have broth in the crock pot.  This explains it pretty well. http://gnowfglins.com/2012/08/08/perpetual-stock-broth/
budgetfood,2gaurr,jet_heller,1 point,Mon Sep 15 01:33:26 2014 UTC,Also look for roaster chickens. They're bigger.
budgetfood,2gaurr,balkenbrij,1 point,Mon Sep 15 04:36:07 2014 UTC,"i like to make chicken with rice. I takes quite some time to make but a pressurecooker might help (and save on the energy bill also). It's chicken, browned, some onions, some bell peppers and some chicken stock and leave that to simmer for a long time (+3 hours). The onions and bell peppers will be completely disolved and give a nice rich sauce. This only works well with pieces with bones (although i'm trying breast tomorrow) If you want you can add mushrooms and/or other things and even curry flavor packages or something to what you like Put some beans (these ones, not the seperated) in boiling water for 5 minutes, rinse them with cold water and you can stir fry them to go with it. It's really easy, doesn't cost to much and you can use it with everything from mashed potatoes to bread (especially good when you make it with a lot of sauce, just use some cornstarch to thicken it up)  I'll surely try your listed recipes, thanks."
budgetfood,2gaurr,RedShirtDecoy,1 point,Sat Sep 13 20:29:21 2014 UTC,"Not sure where you live but here is an idea... if a whole chicken is cheaper than a cut up chicken you can actually stick the entire thing (once cleaned out, cleaned off, and prepped with salt and pepper) into a slow cooker.    Since a whole chicken is far cheaper where I live I tried this once and it was the best chicken Ive tasted.  Just salt and pepper the outside, add some onion powder to the bottom of the crock with just enough water to cover the bottom (1/4 cup maybe) since the chicken has enough water in it already, throw the ready chicken breast up into the slowcooker and cook on high for 4 hours or low for 8.5.    Super tasty, super cheap, and super easy.  Plus change up the spice palette every so often and you can add it to many different things keeping it interesting."
budgetfood,2gaurr,toastedalmonds,1 point,Sat Sep 13 21:30:38 2014 UTC,"You could also consider CSAs. We get all of our meat from a local farm. Added benefit of supporting local business and not consuming hormones or antibiotics, but they are relatively inexpensive compared to grocery store prices. Every month we would get 12-14 lbs of meat and two dozen eggs for $95.   One of the things we had to get used to with the CSA was that every month the chicken only can whole with the skin on. My favorite thing to make with it is pulled chicken sandwiches.  Just take most of the skin off, plop it in a slow cooker, and season it as you wish (I would cheat and use the flavor packets at the store)."
budgetfood,2gaurr,jenilynTX,1 point,Sat Sep 13 23:41:20 2014 UTC,"CSAs by me are universally much more expensive than the grocery store. I would love to be able to afford it, but $5 and up per lb for a whole chicken, and $4/lb for soup bones puts it well out of reach.  I love the idea, and if I had the money, I'd certainly like to buy a chicken every week, along with a piece of beef. But in practice that money would buy enough meat for twice as many meals at the store.   Which, I guess, is part of why it's hard to fight the factory farms."

budgetfood,2g8si6,lethifer,43,Fri Sep 12 22:51:36 2014 UTC,"Reasons why I use Costco instead of Sams club:  . Costco has consistently been good to its employees. They have a much higher average salary, a much higher rate of being insured, and when Sam's was laying off people this year Costco was doing Just Fine, Thanks.  . Costco has what is probably the best return policy of any store ever. Don't like that big box of oranges you bought after eating half of them? They'll take them back.  . Costco's store brand (Kirkland) is very high quality. Many of the items are just white-labelled producs from major manufacturers, and the prices are very good. It's a far cry from buying Sam's Choice or Great Value branded items.  . Costco makes the majority if their money on membership fees. This quite simply means that keeping members happy is their top priority."
budgetfood,2g8si6,brokedown,8,Fri Sep 12 23:05:32 2014 UTC,Good to know! This is my first time getting a membership.

budgetfood,2g8si6,j_platypus,13,Sat Sep 13 00:03:48 2014 UTC,"It's worth it. Really all the Kirkland brand items are high quality. Their regular toilet paper may be slightly rougher than a cloud, but they just came out with extra soft. Their vodka is fantastic, and their garlic bread! Other things that are so much cheaper at costco:   Goat cheese Feta cheese Fuck it all the cheeses  Their olive oil is very high quality. Make sure you get the pure and not the mixed oil, they are clearly labeled.  If you use a lot of tomatoes buy the gigantic can for about 2.50. It comes with a similar amount of tomatoes as the $8 box of 8 cans. Keeps for a couple weeks in the fridge, I have never had it go bad.  Sour cream is good there. So is Greek yogurt. I also like their butter.   This isn't exactly budgetfood, but most costcos have these flavored fruit ice creams that are frozen in the Shell of the fruit, there's pineapple, coconut, mango, passionfruit. They are super tasty.   Best trash bags in the world are the Kirkland brand compactor bags. Super thick and stretchy.   Different costcos in the same area sometimes carry different things so if there's more than one near you check them all out!   Sorry for my rambling. In case you couldn't tell I really like costco."

I spent probably $200 on booze because Costco in my state doesn't sell liquor thanks to state laws, and it was literally half the price than what I pay up here for the same brands. I finished off my Kirkland vodka a couple years ago and it makes me sad"
budgetfood,2g8si6,j_platypus,2,Sat Sep 13 16:34:44 2014 UTC,"I just moved up to Washington from San diego, and on the drive up we bought 18 bottles of their vodka. It's so much more expensive here!

I also used Costco to order bridal shower invitations and they came out amazing. Umm they also sell and install tires with a pretty good warranty, and their jewelry is very high quality and regularly appraised for more than it was bought for when getting an appraisal for insurance reasons.

I often eat it as-is, but you can also add cooked chicken or shrimp for a little extra protein. Serves 4-6 depending on appetites.  Recipe:   1 pound any kind of pasta 2/3 cup natural creamy peanut butter (I used Jif) 1/4 cup soy sauce 1/4 teaspoon ground red pepper 1 teaspoon sugar or honey (I used honey) 2 tablespoons vinegar 2 cloves garlic, minced (You can use a grater with small holes, it's quicker) 1/2 to 3/4 cup of the pasta water red pepper flakes (optional)   Bring a pot of water to a boil and throw the pasta in, cook according to directions. While the pasta is boiling, dump all of the other ingredients except for the water into a heat-safe bowl.  When the pasta is done, reserve up to 3/4 cup of the cooking water and drain the pasta. Slowly stream the cooking water into the bowl while whisking until you've achieved a smooth sauce with a desired consistency.  Toss the pasta with the sauce and then serve into 4 individual bowls. Top with red pepper flakes if desired. (I do this every time because I like mine REALLY spicy, and because I think it makes it look nicer.)  Enjoy!"

budgetfood,2g4ovb,cmontage,3,Thu Sep 11 23:35:55 2014 UTC,Well 2/3 cup of PB is really high in calories imo. Maybe it could be changed with PB2 or less PB with some light cream or so. Also less pasta and add chicken for less calories there
budgetfood,2g4ovb,serenity345,3,Thu Sep 11 21:15:47 2014 UTC,"I make a similar sauce with Sriracha, agave nectar, and PB2. Way fewer calories and quite tasty. The pb2 allows for much greater control of the sauce's consistency as well."

budgetfood,2g4ovb,beta35,4,Thu Sep 11 21:38:24 2014 UTC,"Sure! This is derived from a recipe I found on another sub a long time ago.  1 Tbsp Sriracha, 1 Tbsp agave/honey (I prefer agave, but honey is a bit thicker) , 1 + 1/2 Tbsp PB2 , 1/2 tsp Soy Sauce (optional), Black pepper to taste (I usually go with 1/2 tsp)  For the water, start with 1 Tbsp then increase by 1/2 until you reach your desired consistency. If you're using it for dipping the 1 Tbsp should probably cut it, but if making a sauce for noodles you may want to use more."

budgetfood,2g4ovb,plusfive,3,Thu Sep 11 21:55:09 2014 UTC,"It's dehydrated peanut butter in a powdered form. You just add water to your desired consistency. It's amazingly healthier compared to the regular stuff, as well as economical."

budgetfood,2g4ovb,jerrymazzer,3,Fri Sep 12 03:33:46 2014 UTC,Amazingly lower calorie... I hate to nitpick but I really hate the notion that lower calorie always means healthier. PB is a great source of fat.

Add scallions, pepper, etc to taste.   Alternatively, complete step 1, melt some butter in a pan, fry, remove fillets, melt some more butter, add flour to thicken to a roux, put in some lemon juice and dill, and serve the lemon butter sauce on top of your fish with capers to taste.

Especially if you're intending on burning through five tea bags per pitcher like this.  Speaking of which, they also make bigger sachets actually intended for iced tea (my store didn't get them this year, but we're smaller and don't always get the full retail offerings), and being Tazo, those probably count for this sale as well, if not discounted anyway, being the end of summer."

If this is the case, my recommendation would be this:  make rice exactly as you have been with whatever recommended volume of water (let us call this ""Volume A"") and at the end of the cooking time (35 minutes)  pour off the extra water into a measuring cup.    Let us call this ""Amount B"".  Put the lid back on the rice and let it sit five minutes, fluff with a fork and serve.

budgetfood,2fx2cw,A_Sneaky_Walrus,3,Tue Sep 9 20:09:48 2014 UTC,I make a ton of pulled pork in the slow cooker for my husband to take for work. He's a sandwich freak but I don't want him eating nitrates and artificial shit every day. Leftovers are good as well.

budgetfood,2fx2cw,spielbug,1 point,Tue Sep 9 18:49:10 2014 UTC,"Does a cold cut combo sandwich from Subway count? At $5, I find them to compare well with homemade sandwiches pricewise, especially if you get it with all the veggies. All the stuff they put on there adds up if you get it at the grocery store. One footlong can be for two days lunches."
budgetfood,2fx2cw,Fingebimus,1 point,Tue Sep 9 21:21:58 2014 UTC,"I don't know about prices where you live, but subway is at least double as expensive as fresh sandwiches in Europe."

If you used that $5 plus tax at the grocery store to buy a few buns, a head of lettuce, a cucumber, a couple tomatoes, and depending on  if you want more substance with meat or egg, grab a pack of either eggs, coldcuts, or a can of tuna, and that $5 (plus a tad more) can give you lunch for the whole week maybe. Mmm.. now I want to make subs."

budgetfood,2fx2cw,StrungoutScott,2,Wed Sep 10 00:31:08 2014 UTC,"If you have access to a work fridge, I've come to love buying a pre cooked roast chicken from your local supermarket ($5-$8,) and buying some greens and veggies an making a simple chicken salad. It usually lasts the entire week, and you can usually get buy on less than $20.00 for the week."
budgetfood,2fx2cw,flamingopanic,2,Wed Sep 10 05:57:04 2014 UTC,"I have a few.   First, lasagna. It's pretty easy to make, it's delicious, and it freezes well. Make a whole lasagna. Let it cool. Cut it into servings and freeze in the freezer-safe container of your choice. The night before you want to take a serving to work for lunch, take it out of the freezer and put it in the fridge. The next day, microwave for 3-4 minutes (depending on the microwave) and enjoy. You can also make some garlic bread, cut it into servings and put them in individual baggies to accompany the lasagna and/or make a side salad (make sure you keep any croutons separate, as they will get soggy) with a little Italian dressing in another container to eat with your lasagna at work.  My second favorite is tacos. Get some tupperware plates with dividers and covers. Whip up your favorite taco meat, and then put all the toppings you want into the dividers and cover. Put a couple of tortillas in a baggy and enjoy soft tacos for lunch.  My third favorite is chicken salad in a pita pocket. Whip up your favorite chicken salad and put it on a lettuce leaf in a container with a lid. Cut a pita in half and put it in a baggy. Yummy lunch in less than 10 minutes, and it can last 2 days minimum."
budgetfood,2fx2cw,shaleesmo,2,Wed Sep 10 03:14:16 2014 UTC,That lasagna idea is making me soooo hungry :)
budgetfood,2fx2cw,mistyflannigan,2,Wed Sep 10 10:06:02 2014 UTC,"I had the day off so I visited the $.99 only store.  They were putting out Special K flatbread breakfast sandwiches, a 4 pack for just $.99 or $.25 per serving.  They also had Thai Kitchen Thai Basil Chicken and Noodles frozen meals for $.99 along with various Weight Watcher Smart Ones entries.  Sprouts has a new crop of Gala apples on sale this week for $.49/lb.    I'm working a compressed 4 day/week schedule, so I eat breakfast and lunch at work.  For breakfast I will have one of the Special K sandwiches ($.25) and a banana ($.35) and since it is not my month to buy coffee, my morning Joe is free until November.  Breakfast is $.60, which is less than the federal government allows for food stamps.  Lunch will be one of the Thai Kitchen meals or leftovers ($.99) and a Gala apple ($.20).  Sometimes I splurge and drink a Diet Coke, which I bought last week at Ralphs for $1.99 plus tax and CRV ($.05 per bottle) for a 6-pack of 16 oz. bottles.  (The hospital cafeteria charges employees $1.75 for a Diet Coke and does not sell sodas with sugar.)  If I do not drink the Diet Coke, my meal cost is below SNAP (food stamps) allowance.  I could also have a Marie Callender's chicken pot pie from Costco, on sale this month so the net cost is about $1 for each pie.  This is high is sodium and fat, but  since I have low-normal blood pressure, I will eat one on occasion.  Dinner is a wildcard at my house because I'm usually really tired after work.  If my husband is also working late, I may just eat a sandwich or bowl of cereal.  This would cost <$1 per meal.  If I cook, it's usually bonelss chicken breasts that I buy on sale at $2/lb, a starch such as a potato, corn, or rice, and seasonal vegetables.  I try to make enough for dinner the next day for both my husband and I.    Our indulgence over the warm summer months has been Thrifty ice cream from Rite Aid.  Unlike the other brands that are only 1.5 quarts, this ice cream is 1.75 quarts.  It has been on sale regularly for buy one, get one free, so we get 2 containers for $5 but that doesn't last long when our kids come home for the weekend from college.  Macaroni Grill near our house has a great happy hour with $5 flatbread pizzas.  I eat half of the pizza along with a $3 happy hour beer or glass of wine and take the other half to work the next day.  We also like Taco Surf, which has a $3 featured beer each month and great happy hour prices on tacos with free chips and salsa.  If it is too hot to cook, happy hour is a good alternative.  Most of the bars attached to restaurants in my area have Taco Tuesdays with $1 tacos and half-price appetizers.  I have been going to happy hours for dinner ever since I was a poor college student.  Although we make a good income, we have 2 children in college.  We don't want them to be saddled with outrageous student loans, so we are doing as much as we can to help them get a good start in life.  We plan our meals according to what is on sale and when we find an exceptional deal, we stock up.  Sprout's Gala apples will stay good for months in the refrigerator and we have an extra freezer in our garage for bulk purchases.  I was also able to buy a 32 oz container of plain Greek yogurt at the $.99 Store today and want to make the bread recipe circulating around this forum.  I will probably keep the dough in the garage refrigerator because it is too hot to use the oven this week.  Once it cools down, I will make bread for sandwiches and pizza dough for calzones.  The medical center where I work hosts a farmer's market every other week and has pretty good deals on produce, so I shop there early because they consistently sell out before noon.   Both my husband and I take a lunch but do go out with coworkers for lunch once every other week.  Lunch is generally cheaper than dinner.  BJs near my work has lunch specials for about $7 and since we have to go back to work, we cannot order expensive drinks.    It is nice to go out sometimes so you do not feel deprived.  Since we live near the beach, we like to hit Taco Surf or another inexpensive local beach place, and then walk along the sand after dinner.  It's a great way to spend a Friday evening after a long week at work.  Look for local eateries with drink specials and make a meal out of bar food.  It is not unusual for my husband and I to eat dinner and have a drink for under $20 for us both.     The commercially prepared frozen meals are high in sodium and the diet types do not fill you up, so you will need to supplement your meal with something else, such as fruit or vegetables, or you will be starving by 3:00 PM.  A couple of weeks ago I ate on the Weight Watcher's meals and by 3:30 PM I was in the cafeteria, where I bought an ice cream sandwich at the incredibly marked up price of $3.50.  You might want to pack an afternoon snack  like yogurt or string cheese so you don't hit the vending machines."
budgetfood,2fx2cw,cupcakewrangler,1 point,Wed Sep 10 18:31:31 2014 UTC,"Do you like pinwheels or sandwich wraps? Buy a large stack of tortillas ($2), lunch meat or a whole roasted chicken ($6) and separate the meat from bone so you have shredded chicken. Add cheese, bean spread and veggies if you like. Roll tightly and slice and you have pinwheels for for less than $20 a week. I really like smoked turkey, harvarti, spinach and sriracha mayo that I make myself."

budgetfood,2fn97j,JapanNow,8,Sat Sep 6 17:57:24 2014 UTC,"Cooked beans in a bean pot will inevitably make a thick slurry ""sauce"" (also called bean juice or bean liquor) as a result of the starches in the beans releasing after they cooked.    As I understand it, it's this liquid which also happens to contain the gasses which can contribute to bean flatulence.   In any case, I frequently cook a pot of beans in both a crockpot if I have the time, or just over the stove in a deep pot, and the sauce you're referring to happens naturally if I don't add too much water, and, let it simmer down to reduce.  I'll typically add a can of chicken broth to whatever type I'm making, but if you want to keep it vegan, you may wish to add fresh or purchased vegetable stock to add to the flavor of the bean liquor.  What you're describing sounds like Cuban Style Black Beans, albeit without tomato or tomato paste, it sounds like.  Here's a vegan recipe for you which starts with pre-cooked canned beans.     Note that this recipe does NOT drain and rinse the canned beans. This means there will be a thick slurry already there from the bean starch when you put them in the pot.   This recipe is an easy way to just try the dish and see if you like it, before committing to the much longer method of making it from with dry beans.  Here is a recipe for another style, which does rely on dry beans. You won't want the ham hock if you're keeping vegan, but sofrito is a tasty way to cook up beans."

Beans contain starches that humans can't digest, but human gut flora can.  Flatulence is the output of gut flora (among other things) as they eat the stuff.  Starches diffuse into water from the beans while soaking or cooking.  That includes the digestible and indigestible starches.  There is plenty of starch (both varieties) left in the beans after cooking, so if you are prone to flatulence you are going to, err, flatulate."

Looking back at old receipts to estimate costs of food can be helpful as well. I know that one store in my neighborhood is cheaper for produce, while another is cheaper for other items. So when I make my grocery list I can know what I should buy at each store. Additionally I know how much I'll approximately be spending before I go shopping.  If you're looking for cheap suggestions: PBJ, pasta (freezes well), carrots and hummus (hummus is relatively cheap at Aldi), banana bread/muffins, ramen (super gourmet if you add mushrooms or snap peas or sriracha)"
budgetfood,2fl1vn,occultnemy,2,Fri Sep 5 23:36:14 2014 UTC,"Look for things that can be used for lots of different meals. I love Tabasco for this reason, maybe a good salsa, depends more on what you like than anything.   Jasmine rice, it's wonderful. I didn't realize rice could taste so good. Use it to fill out a smaller meal or eat it alone with soy sauce.  Whole chickens, very cheap and the possibilities are endless. This week a stuffed it with diced tomatoes and onions and roasted it. Used most of it in fried (jasmine) rice and veggies. Used the rest for sandwiches.   Tilapia is actually pretty decently priced, I just paid ~$7 for 8 fillets. I use it as a cheap ""nice"" meal.  Potatoes are also great, mash em, fry em, put them in a stew.  Soups are great, I make some soup once a week to use up any veggies that are too small to make a side dish out of and anything that is going bad.  My all time favorite is definitely tamales. Not as hard to make as you'd think and very cheap if you use the right ingredients."
budgetfood,2fl1vn,lok_nez,2,Fri Sep 5 23:53:17 2014 UTC,Second the rice. My parents only made minute rice growing up. So I always thought rice was gross. Then I went to Japan and found out what it should taste like. I have been hooked since.   Bonus its cheap.
budgetfood,2fl1vn,KeepFoodAffordable,2,Sat Sep 6 00:02:47 2014 UTC,"Another technique is to go into the store with an idea of a few simple meals you can make (instead of a set plan), and shop whatever happens to be on sale/most affordable.   Grocery stores rotate sale items regularly, and food prices (for fresh foods at least) rise and fall with the market, so keeping your options open once you get to the store is an important part of shopping most efficiently."

In my area there is a store that sells most of the spices used in Southern cuisine for $1/per, in a plastic jar with a shaker cap.  It sounds like what you are looking for.  The quantity and quality varies a lot for that $1.  I bought one of everything I used (if I didn't already have a spice jar for it) and justified it as filling out the spice rack.  You don't want to keep buying that stuff though.  Get your refills (in bags) from a bulk store or an Asian or Mexican grocery, if you have them in your area.

budgetfood,2f8328,raymond8505,20,Tue Sep 2 04:26:35 2014 UTC,"Salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, basil... if I can only pick 5.  Buy your spices on sale and the ones you use a lot at Costco.   It takes a while to build a spice collection but buy the very basics and new ones as you need them. They can be pricey and to buy all at once is a waste.  See what you like to cook and build from there. Skip recipes (for now) that have a bazillion spices.   I bought one new spice a week for a few months when I got my own place. That worked well and didn't make a terrible dent in my wallet."
budgetfood,2f8328,MarfaStewart,8,Tue Sep 2 07:14:33 2014 UTC,I would agree with this advice   Only thing I'd add is that sometimes buying the mega size at costco isn't a good deal.  Many spices go bad after a few years (I know firsthand).   If you're unsure go with a slightly smaller size until you see how fast you go through it.  Watch your local grocery store for sales.

budgetfood,2f15ns,enlach,2,Sat Aug 30 23:41:22 2014 UTC,"Guys, the easiest way to do it is to bake the coconut on 350F for about 10 to 15 minutes until it cracks. The meat will keep the water in.   After it cracks, let it cool & proceed to break it apart.   Some people pierce the coconut to drain the water first but I've done it without piercing it. It totally works."
budgetfood,2f15ns,laserguidedshark,2,Sun Aug 31 01:24:39 2014 UTC,"Here is an easier way:  Just use a hammer and a thick metal nail, and make a little hole on the top. Then just pour it into a glass.   Once it's empty use the hammer to crack it open and use a small knife to scoop out the ""meat""."
budgetfood,2f15ns,nachtmere,2,Sun Aug 31 03:58:55 2014 UTC,"If you have a 12 inch chef knife you can use the non-blade side to crack the shell. Simply turn the knife over and give the coconut a good whack. Turn the nut and whack again. It usually only takes two or three hits, and it splits pretty evenly once you get the hang of it."
budgetfood,2f15ns,Eat_The_Muffin,1 point,Sun Aug 31 10:33:25 2014 UTC,Opening coconuts is easy if you have a hard surface and know what you're doing. The method I use is to hit it firmly in the middle of each of the three lines that run down it (they run between the 3 dark indents at the top) with a hammer or smash it on something hard.  You will probably want to poke holes in the eyes and pour out the water first.

This time of year, people will sometimes just give you zucchini because it is so plentiful.  Drizzle some olive oil in the pot. Slice vegetables about 1/4"" thick. Use eggplant, zucchini, summer squash, tomatoes, onions, and/or whatever is on sale.  Layer the vegetables in single layers with onions on the bottom and tomatoes on top, and repeat until crock pot is full or you are out of vegetables. On the top, spread out a can of tomato paste and some sliced garlic. Cook low 4-6 hours. I like to serve with parmesan cheese and fresh basil, but you can really go wild and do what you want."

budgetfood,2eug9q,Winterspark,3,Fri Aug 29 03:20:47 2014 UTC,"Not really. That was an exaggeration sorta. We have a Walmart around ~12 minutes away, but that's it. If we want anything else (and we do, often) we have to go to the adjacent town which is 20 minutes to get to the town. Plus time spent driving in the city itself.  I live in the middle of the school/residential district on the side of town. Our town is basically a rectangle with Houses and Schools on one side, fast food and gas stations (and random places like hair salons etc) in the middle, and groceries on the far side. To get anything more than our single small walmart, you have to keep going past it and hit the next City which is bigger than ours.   We're not that small at all, we just have no real businesses compared to a big city. We've relied on our Big Sister city for that forever. Meanwhile we have much better schools and better parks/neighborhoods.   I'm guessing (in the next ~100 years or so) we'll merge into one city (like Minneapolis–Saint Paul) were we will have the people and schools, and they'll have the businesses and college."
budgetfood,2eug9q,Cendeu,2,Fri Aug 29 03:48:36 2014 UTC,"Ah, that's interesting. I've never really lived in a town like that before. The one I'm in has some areas that are more heavily business oriented vs areas that are more residential, but even the business areas tend to have lots of residential areas very close to them and the residential stuff, barring a few wealthy areas, typically have close access to the basics (grocery stores, gas stations, etc.). I have at least three grocery stores within 2 miles of me, for instance, among many other businesses, yet am still in the suburbs of the city.

The (north)west side of town is all of the residential, hence the tons of streets and parks. That bleeds into the ""gas station and fast food area"" as you go east and down 34. Going further down 34 you get to the walmart and the end of town right before Center Junction (that's where 34 hits the interstate, and divides Cape from Jackson).  From there you can stay on 34 to go to this side of Cape, or take the interstate to get to the other side of Cape. Just glancing at the map you can tell Cape is quite bigger than us. I think they're around 5x our population. But everyone in Jackson goes to Cape to do pretty much anything other than fast food or haircuts, so we're slowly building towards each other."

Don't prepare the meals in bulk, stored for more then a week, these tend to go bad. The tofu adds a ton to the cost, I cut a block of tofu up enough to last two weeks but it adds about a dollar per meal. Tofu also does not save well. Miso Paste is cheap, broth makes the meal so don't skimp out on the broth, I added egg whites to the broth and made the broth separate from the solid food. DO NOT store the noodles inside broth, they will become soggy and not editable. Store them prepared (boiled) but dry in containers with the tofu cubes, mushrooms, and other ingredients. Boil the broth and add the miso paste to it after removing it from heat, and store the broth in a jug. The egg whites aren't just good for flavor, they add serious proteins and are very good for you. Just a side note, I reconstituted dried mushrooms in MSG overnight, adding some sesame seed oil to them for flavor."

budgetfood,2eo4a5,nullreturn,8,Wed Aug 27 20:59:51 2014 UTC,"My recipe for my ""authentic"" rice (yours does look good though) is as follows:   Get the rice you're going to make (white grain, doesn't matter if it's parboiled, long, medium, or short but I use long grain white), throw it in a pan with approx. a 1/2 tablespoon oil (I use olive/peanut)/1 cup dry rice and a bay leaf (1 leaf for 1 to 2 cups dry rice, 2 leafs for 3 to 4 cups, etc.). Keep stirring until it reaches a nice golden brown color (you can smell it), DO NOT let it burn, or you gotta throw it away (~6 minutes, but I have a gas stove). Add a half can of chicken broth (15 oz.) and a half can of tomato sauce (8 oz) (I usually make at least 2 cups dry rice, so it would be 1 and 1 per 2 cups dry rice, then add 2 cups water with [1 teaspoon of both garlic powder (had good results with minced/finely chopped garlic) and 1 teaspoon oregano (per 2 cups dry rice) and add salt to taste (depends on saltiness of broth), you can also add jalapenos. serrano, or cayenne powder now]. Let it soak up the majority of liquid (might have to add up to a half cup of water for personal taste, I like mine a little crunchy, my GF likes it soft), then throw the lid on it and throw it in the oven to keep it warm (I use all steel pans, so if you can't (plastic handle, etc.) just cover and move to back of stove). Let it sit for about 15 minutes, remove bay leaf(s), quarter lime, and squeeze 1/4 lime per cup of dry rice, fluff with fork, and serve.    Comes out to about ~$3 for 4 cups prepared, at 3/4 cup per serving, that's ~$0.60/serving."

I'll add some kimchi, sambal sauce and a fried egg to make some quick/cheap/delicious bibimbap.  Whenever I have leftover smoked brisket and I'm tired of sandwiches, I'll add it to a bowl of instant ramen (anything with more than one flavor packet).  Add some bean sprouts and a soft boiled egg and you have a pretty decent bowl of noodles in no time.  You could do this with just about any leftover beef or pork.  If you're not in the mood for soup, you can drain the broth and stir fry the cooked noodles and meat with some veggies."

budgetfood,2eje0f,agentfantabulous,2,Mon Aug 25 17:27:59 2014 UTC,"Really depends on the leftovers. I suppose the strangest thing I've done is taking some left over homemade mac and cheese and using a blender and some more milk, turned it into a cheese sauce for chicken. In general though: Soup, salad, sandwiches, rice, and pasta. Most left overs can be turned into one of the above (or paired with in the case of the last two.)"

budgetfood,2eje0f,the_pimpstress,1 point,Mon Aug 25 18:27:40 2014 UTC,"Depends on the leftovers, obviously, but I tend to incorporate it into new dishes because I rather dislike the same thing reheated, unless it reheats really well, like soup. I've turned meatloaf into pseudo-meatballs for pasta, left over veggie sides I usually make fried rice or stir fry out of. If I have a lot of odds and ends of things that mesh decently with each other, I'll make a frittata with them or soup. If I accumulate a lot of meat scraps, I'll often make chili with them."
budgetfood,2eje0f,Spokanechub,1 point,Mon Aug 25 19:26:37 2014 UTC,"Depends on the leftovers and how I planned. If I were still living with just my boyfriend I would do this:  Sunday night: Crock pot chicken, eat whatever we want; shred the rest. Monday: Chicken salad sandwich, and chicken pot pie Tuesday: Chicken pot pie for lunch, and chicken enchiladas Wednesday: Left overs. Thursday: If chicken left, eat that with extras.  If I have left over meats, I throw them into a soup with veggies. If I have left over dinner, I eat it for lunch.   Planning your meals around you meat and making that meat last as long as possible can really help not only budget your meals better, but also eat more of the meals you make."

budgetfood,2eje0f,RichieSM,1 point,Mon Aug 25 20:53:58 2014 UTC,Like everyone else says truly depends what it is. What I usually do is use a frying pan with a lid. Helps circulate heat and keep moisture in the food so you don't get dry over cooked meat. I may lube the pan with oil or butter but sometimes I throw in a piece of bacon and let the juices come out of that as lube and proceed reheating my food.  If you're using a microwave I recommend using a bowl and out a wet paper towel on top. What that does is heat up the water in the paper towel and helps keep moisture from escaping the food. I've also seen people use a plate and a wet bowl covering the food on the plate.  I prefer the frying pan method though. Hope that helps some

There are always 'leftovers' in my fridge simply because there is no way in hell I'm going to cook every single meal I eat every day, that's insane to me. So when I cook I always cook double or more depending on the dish (cheap dish I'm cooking a shitload, expensive probably two or three servings).

budgetfood,2efxjw,PostPostModernism,3,Sun Aug 24 20:31:03 2014 UTC,Depends where you live. Real coconuts are fairly easy to find and can be pretty cheap if you go to an Indian or Mexican grocery store.   When making coconut milk with real coconuts you also have shredded coconut left over which can be used on cereal or when baking.
budgetfood,2efxjw,novemberdream07,6,Sun Aug 24 15:12:12 2014 UTC,For me it's $2.00 for a coconut but $4.50 gets me half a gallon of coconut milk.

Let 50 g (1.75 ounces) butter get to room temperature. Mix 2 eggs and 1,5 dl (0.63 cups) sugar fluffy (best with an electric whisk). Add the butter and 200 g/5-6 dl (7 ounces/2.1-2.5 cups) grated coconut and keep mixing until smooth. Let it rest for 10 to 15 minutes to let the coconut soak up some liquid and make the mix firmer. Or if you are using moist coconut from making coconut milk; add more coconut! :D Use two spoons to make about 35 dollops on cookie sheets with paper on. Bake for about 12 minutes in an oven at 175ºC (347ºF).   These are yummy as they are. But you could add some lemon zest to the mix or/and dip the cookies in melted chocolate once they are cool.  Keep them in a sealed container or wolf them down while they are moist. Just don't let them dry out too much. Can be frozen and are great when lightly warmed in microwave.

budgetfood,2eeb0d,xlarukux,14,Sun Aug 24 00:28:31 2014 UTC,"Le recipe:  As I commented yesterday in a post by /u/MilitantApathist, I normally buy 10lbs of chicken at once from Sam's Club and cook it all at once  Chicken:  Ingredients:   10 lbs of boneless skinless chicken breast 4 1/2 c water 4 bullion cubes 1/8 c olive oil   Directions:   Cut your chicken into 1"" cubes while trimming most of the fat. Get the biggest skillet you have.  Turn the temperature to med-high. Spoon olive oil into the skillet as needed so nothing burns. As soon as the skillet is 325°F add enough chicken to fill the bottom. Cook approx 10 min stirring every 2 min until the chicken is browned then set aside. Repeat steps 4-6 until all the chicken is cooked. Combine chicken, water, and bullion cubes in a large stock pot, cover, and set to low heat. (note: the stock doesn't need to completely cover the chicken) Cook covered for 15 min, then uncover. Continue to cook uncovered until most of the stock has boiled away. Do not cook longer than 30 minutes otherwise chicken will be too soft.   This is how I cook all of my chicken. Its tender and juicy and can be combined with any meal. I freeze the extra  For the teriyaki sauce I used THIS RECIPE, added vegetables (I love water chestnuts), replaced mirin with half regular cooking wine and half rice vinegar. You will need to adjust the proportions according to how much chicken you cook. I also replaced the peanut oil with canola since I'm allergic to peanuts. Skip to the last step where you reduce the sauce, then add the chicken last. I sprinkled some wonton strips on top for a little extra crunch.  Sweet potato mash is super easy. Make just like regular mashed potatoes. At the end I add a bit of salt, brown sugar, cinnamon, and butter.  The rice was Uncle Bens ready rice :o I'm cheating.  I only used 3lbs of the chicken, so total it cost me ~$9 to make four meals.  Let's all save money by eating healthy homecooked meals!"
budgetfood,2eaam3,MilitantApathist,27,Fri Aug 22 15:43:10 2014 UTC,Go to the super market early in the day and ask the meat guy what is marked down. You can get good deals on meat that is about to hit its sell by date and put it in your freezer.
budgetfood,2eaam3,Lolerwaffles,21,Fri Aug 22 16:18:46 2014 UTC,"Now is your moment to start bulk shopping, or plant a garden.   There are two people in my house. Costco meat is 1/2 the price per pound as anywhere else in town so we buy it there, vacuum seal potions we're not going to eat, and have several meals worth of meat from one shopping trip. We also buy whole chickens. When the local butcher shop had a special on half a pig we bought it, and it has lasted us almost a year. Buy 16 catfish fillets at Costco? Freeze them in two packs and have fish for months. Vacuum sealer is your bff as far as freezing meat is concerned. Don't forget to label everything.  Bulk veggies are also great. I freeze things individually on a cookies sheet so I can pull out, for example, as many green beans as I think we're going to eat. When I can buy an absolutely absurd amount of carrots at the farmers market, I do and freeze them. Shred zucchini and freeze to make into muffins throughout the winter.   If you are willing to plant a garden you can make all sorts of tomato sauces and freeze them. You can freeze your own veggies for the price of building a garden once. I also like slicing and freezing peppers for use all year long to avoid having to buy them later.  Berries freeze really well if you have a cookie sheet and are patient. Gallon bags full of soup or chili frozen on a cookie sheet stack really well in the side of the freezer. Butter will last almost a year in the freezer without going weird.   Good luck."

budgetfood,2eaam3,yggdrasils_roots,7,Sat Aug 23 10:10:01 2014 UTC,"Veggies- Carrots, broccoli, green beans, and other veggies that you would steam freeze well.  Blanch them in a boiling water bath for about 30 seconds, and then immerse them in an ice bath immediately.  Strain them, pat them dry, and arrange them in a single layer on a cookie sheet, then put them in your chest freezer. Once frozen, put them into a freezer ziploc, or vacuum seal them. I prefer the vacuum seal method because foods won't get freezer burn for about two years this way.  I got my vacuum sealer off ebay for about $50.  Fruits- Similar to the veggies, only you don't blanch them. Just cut them (peel if you like), arrange in a single layer for freezing, them bag or vacuum pack them. Meats- These freeze best either vacuum sealed, or wrapped first in a layer of plastic wrap, then in a layer of foil to protect from freezer burn.  We buy bulk hamburger, divide it into 1 lb portions, and freeze these individually.  Bulk steaks, pork chops, etc, get frozen individually too, rather than freezing the whole package.  They keep better that way. Just make sure to label everything. Soups/Sauces- If you're going to vacuum seal these, you must freeze them first in a container, then pop the frozen portion out and vacuum seal it as a solid.  Otherwise, go to Costco and get the plastic takeout containers with the lids, or save up your old yogurt and sour cream containers.  Another good method (and the best for space saving!) is to freeze them in Ziplocs so that they're flat.  Casseroles- Making lasagna or enchiladas?  Make a bunch. Buy the aluminum casserole pans at Costco and use those to store the casseroles.  Wrap the top well with plastic wrap and then foil to keep them fresh.  Dairy- You can freeze milk, cheese, and butter. I've even frozen cracked, beaten eggs in freezer bags before when I've had too many eggs. The cheese gets kind of crumbly and doesn't shred very well after it's frozen, but it melts just fine and tastes the same. The eggs get a bit thicker and their consistency changes a bit, but they work well in recipes and scrambled eggs. No difference in the butter or milk. Caution- Don't freeze anything with potatoes in it.  The potatoes turn really grainy and mealy."

You can of course get frozen veggies, but you can also get them and pre-slice/chop them for ease of use and decrease prep time.  Here's a good article on freezing foods  Edit: formatting"
budgetfood,2eaam3,Chronx6,4,Fri Aug 22 18:16:42 2014 UTC,"Anything and everything. Okay not quite but still. I recommend looking up freeze dates and learning to tell how good or bad something is by sight. (In general standing ice is bad for example).  Learn to freeze food correctly. Basically you want to get things as cold as possible as fast as possible. Easiest way to do this is a lined cookie sheet in the freezer. Single layer things and for bulky items (like most meats) have space between them.  After that you want to store things airtight and then label them. What it is, date frozen, and when you should use it by (if you want to do the math then and there.)  You can freeze a lot. Meats, Vegs, fruit, butter, milk, cheese, prepared foods, and more. Also look into freezable and microwaveable containers for left overs. Amazon has a lot of them.  Buy in bulk and on sale. Cheap chicken? Buy extra and freeze it. Farmer's market trying to get rid of peaches? Heck yeah. BUy and freeze.  Oh on fruit: If you can stand it sweetened, tossing them in a ziplock bag with some sugar and letting them make their own syrup before freezing means that they will freeze better. The syrup prevents large ice crystals."
budgetfood,2eaam3,ajanitsunami,3,Fri Aug 22 18:26:28 2014 UTC,"I have a chest freezer as well. I normally buy 10 lbs of chicken, cube it, and then cook all of it at once. I then portion everything into quart sized bags so I don't have to dice up chicken every time I want to cook. I also do the same thing with ground beef and turkey. The precooked meat cooks a lot faster so I normally throw it in my food towards the end.  I also make my own TV dinners which I bring to work. I'll portion out some of the chicken, a grain, and a veggie and then freeze it in a Tupperware. You then microwave the meals for 3-5min just as you would with any other frozen meal. At any time I normally have at least 5 full meals RTG.  All of this cooking takes 2-3 hours, but its easier to cook everything at once than to cook for 45 min/ day."

budgetfood,2e88cy,joeverdrive,3,Fri Aug 22 03:23:08 2014 UTC,"If you have a slow cooker, I recommend taco chicken bowls.  I eat it in tortillas to make it last longer.  Or BBQ chicken--all you need is 2 lbs chicken, an 18 oz bottle BBQ sauce, and you can throw in a diced onion and some garlic, Worcestershire sauce, whatever spices you want if you feel like it.   But really if you have a good sauce, you don't need additional seasonings. 6 hours on low, then shred it up and eat it on bread of your choice or by itself if you like.   Those two recipes easily come in around $10-$15 each, at least where I live."

After you finish grilling the first side flip it and sprinkle a bit of shredded cheddar on it. It'll melt a bit from the heat and when the 2nd side is grilled, flip it over so the melted shredded cheddar gets to grill. Sprinkle some shredded cheddar on the 2nd side and let that melt. When the 1st side is nice and grilled give it one more flip to grill the 2nd sides shredded cheddar.   Watch it closely.  You don't want to burn the cheddar just grill and crispen it up.  You get the melty gooey american mixed with the tang of the cheddar."

budgetfood,2e2wgs,jet_heller,3,Wed Aug 20 15:03:17 2014 UTC,"We live on a ranch so our meat selection is similar.  We make homemade pizzas with spicy pork sausage, cheese and sauce as a topping.  You have to pre-cook the sausage because otherwise it gets a bit greasy. If you make your own pizza sauce, or just use a cheap spaghetti sauce it does not cost too much.   We also use Mexican seasonings on the ground beef to make enchiladas, soft tacos, or taco rice(instead of tortillas, serve the taco fillings on top of rice).

budgetfood,2e2wgs,PanTardovski,1 point,Wed Aug 20 15:22:32 2014 UTC,"Feijoada:       Feijoada (European Portuguese: [fɐjʒuˈaðɐ], Brazilian Portuguese: [fejʒuˈadɐ]) is a stew of beans with beef and pork,  which is a typical Portuguese dish. Feijoada is also typically cooked in former Portuguese colonies such as Brazil, Macau, Angola, Mozambique and Goa (India). However, the recipe can differ slightly from one country to another.   The name comes from feijão, Portuguese for ""beans"".  The basic ingredients of feijoada are beans with fresh pork  or beef. In northwest Portugal (chiefly Minho and Douro Litoral), it is usually made with white beans; in the northeast (Trás-os-Montes), it is generally prepared with kidney beans, and includes other vegetables such as tomatoes, carrots, and cabbage. The stew is best prepared over low heat in a thick clay pot.  It is usually served with rice and assorted sausages, such as chouriço, morcela (blood sausage), farinheira, and others, which may or may not be cooked in the stew.

budgetfood,2e2wgs,MinnesotaNiceGuy,2,Wed Aug 20 18:03:55 2014 UTC,"Venison tacos are the best! I think it's because the meat is so lean.   Chili is really good half venison and half sausage.  Try a Made Rite too.  It's like a sloppy Joe but without the tomato.  This is almost the recipe, but you can do it in a pan with a lid on medium a little quicker.   Oh! And Hopping John soup for the winter! Make about 2 cups rice and use one can of black eyed peas per half pound of sausage.  Just brown the crumbled sausage until it's done, (if you drain the meat save some of the fat) the then fold in the beans and rice. It's going to be thick, more like a rice dish. All of the flavor comes from the rice and black eyed peas, but serve with hot sauce, tapatio or valentina works well. If you want to be fancy you can throw peppers and onions in with the frying sausage, but I never have.   And you could make a variation of dirty rice.  Just substitute meat of your choice for the crumbled liver."

Bring the water and ½ cup milk to a low boil in a saucepan. Whisk the other ½ cup milk with the poultry seasoning and flour; add the mixture to the boiling liquid and whisk until a smooth creamy sauce forms. Assembly: In a large bowl, mix the sauce from step one, one cup water, quinoa and stir to combine. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Slice the chicken breasts into thin strips and lay the chicken breasts strips over the top of the quinoa mixture. Sprinkle with the seasoning. Bake uncovered for 30 minutes. Broccoli: While the casserole is in the oven, place the broccoli in boiling water for 1 minute until it turns bright green and then run under cold water. Set aside. Bake: Remove the casserole from the oven, check the mixture by stirring it around in the pan, and if needed, bake for an additional 10-15 minutes to get the right consistency. When the quinoa and chicken are cooked and the sauce is thickened, add the broccoli and a little bit of water (up to one cup) until the consistency is creamy and smooth and you can stir it up easily in the pan. Top with the cheese and bake for 5 minutes, or just long enough to melt the cheese.   Serves 6 with generous portions, 8 with moderate coming out to ~$1.67-1.25 a serving depending.

budgetfood,2dv1ee,gambris,115,Mon Aug 18 05:31:37 2014 UTC,"Go to Walmart or the cheapest superstore you have near you. If you have a friend with a Sam's Club or Costco membership, ask them to let you tag along.   Get one of the bulk bags of frozen veggies. Something with broccoli or cauliflower in it, because cruciferous veggies are necessary.   Chicken, ground beef, and pork are going to be your best bets for meat.  Get a large bulk package of ground beef and maybe a bag of chicken thighs. Freeze the ground beef in small freezer bags so you can thaw individual servings that will last you a day or two.   Maybe a bag or two of the cheapest pasta you can find. Canned fruit in water.  Canned tuna. Maybe a few eggs. Nutrition-wise, eggs are cheaper protein than meat. They're also cheaper if you buy them 5 dozen at a time.  About $10 for 5 dozen where I live in California, and I keep them on the counter.  They don't spoil for about two weeks that way.   A bulk bag of oatmeal for breakfast would help too.   Bread is expensive.  Consider making your own.  It's not that hard.  Tortillas are also cheaper and you can freeze them too.    Cheese is also expensive.  Go all-out and get a big block one week after you've covered some staples.  Cut it into smaller chunks and freeze that too.   If you have a Grocery Outlet or some other dented-can store nearby, see if they have bacon ends and pieces. I usually get 3 lbs for about $5.  Fry it all up on low heat and put the grease in a jar and use it for cooking.  Great flavor, no worse for you than butter, and you get to eat the tasty bacon chunks.  Just refrigerate or freeze the fried pieces and bring them out to flavor your dishes.   Canned sardines and kippered herring are really high in Omega-3 fats (good for your heart) and they're pretty cheap protein too.  Throw some kippered herring on some rice and veggies.  It's pretty tasty.  Consider at some point buying a large bag of rice.  Again, cheaper in bulk, and it pretty much keeps forever if you store it the right way. Same for beans.   Look at each shopping trip as an opportunity to buy something in bulk that will last you a couple of months.  Start stocking up. Don't just buy simply as much as you would eat in two weeks.  Get one bulk purchase every shopping trip and use the rest of your budget on the smaller, more perishable items.  Learn to freeze a lot of stuff.  Learn to bake bread.  If your neighbors have fruit trees, ask to pick the fruit and then make freezer jam or simply peel and freeze the fruit for later use in oatmeal and other dishes.   Another good idea is to go become a volunteer at your local food bank.  They often give away perishable, unused food to the volunteers.  My father used to volunteer for Second Harvest Food Bank and was coming home with loads of fresh produce and dairy every week that didn't manage to get distributed.  You might find yourself with a lot of extra food that way."

budgetfood,2dv1ee,willic,7,Mon Aug 18 06:22:55 2014 UTC,"I can't top that. Thats basically how I live. I just wanted to add an extra tip in. Breakfasts are epxensive meals often. So instead of buying perishable stuff, buy your favorite fruit, and some nut of some kind, and make waffles or pancakes homade. You ca make a huge batch from scratch and then freeze them. It will feel like a treat, but if it has fruit and nuts in it, it will be quite healthy. Instead of expensive syrups that are unhealthy, either skip the syrup, use honey, or make homade syrup and can it so you only have to make it once. Dandelion syrup is delicious if you have dandelions in your area. You can make syrup out of almost any edible flower. So pansies would work as well. If not, just make a basic fruit syrup, especially if you know someone who has berries or fruit trees."
budgetfood,2dv1ee,hypnofed,10,Mon Aug 18 14:53:23 2014 UTC,"Another great cut of meat is pork shoulder.  It'll cost under $2/lb, but the problem is that you need to buy at least 5-6 pounds at a time.  If you manage to get one, cover it with an inexpensive spice rub and cook at 250F until it's around 195 internal.  You know it's done when you put a fork in it and it twirls like spaghetti.  If you have some seasonings in the kitchen, look for spice rub recipes and make your own.  Ham is also good in the same way.  You know those spiral-sliced hams that everyone serves on Thanksgiving and Christmas?  You can buy them all year, and they usually cost $2-3/lb.  Buy some rice and a bag of frozen mixed vegetables too.  And when it's done, use the hambone to cook some black bean soup, which is really pretty cheap too.  Cook black beans with the hambone (and any leftover drippings from when you cooked it), a few cloves of garlic, some diced chiles, and a can of diced tomatoes.  I know you said you don't like tomatoes outside of salsa, but that's actually the effect you're going for here.  Also, on the note of volunteering at a food bank, it's worthwhile to note you may well qualify to get food from one.  People in your situation are exactly what social safety nets are meant for.  Don't feel bad about taking advantage of charity when you legitimately need it.  Lastly, and this is difficult because it's not cheap: vitamins.  When you're eating poor and the same thing every day for 10 days in a row, you'll inevitably miss something here and something else there because your diet has no variety.  They're expensive because they're exclusively sold in bulk.  Ask your friends if they take vitamins and if so, whether you can have a small handful.  Break them and take half a pill a day.  Even if they're ""women's"" vitamins and you're a man, go for it.  Wrong-gender vitamins just have slightly different formulations and anything in it your body doesn't need will come out in your urine; no muss, no fuss."
budgetfood,2dv1ee,mousetaps,2,Mon Aug 18 10:11:01 2014 UTC,"Meat/dairy is by far one of the most expensive things you buy.  Cut down on that and your budget for other stuff that last way longer goes up.  Meat/cheese related items tanks food budgets.  Even when you think you're getting a deal buying in bulk it's still MANY times more expensive than pasta, rice, beans, etc.  The only meat I consider a true deal is the manager specials / about to expire stuff - which not all stores have.  However even then you can drop $5 on meat that might not make it through the night.  I suppose a lot has to do with how you use it, perhaps I'm fucking it all up - as the kids say.  I feel like I just got burned hard on a big bag of chicken breast.  They were cheap per pound but I didn't realize how few calories chicken breast had.  With that in consideration it's like I was throwing money away.  Tasty tasty money.  That $10 could have been MUCH better spent on something that might have made it though the week at least..  I like to buy one of those grocery store precooked chickens then pick off it for about 2 weeks adding it to soups, stews, etc.  Adds that bit of flavor and texture that makes bland food that much better.  But if you find yourself eating a significant amount of meat often your wallet will suffer.  That's $5 / 14 days.  Much nicer math."
budgetfood,2dv1ee,Yolanda_Neptune,1 point,Tue Aug 26 07:47:21 2014 UTC,"In my experience, the cheapest meat you can get is chicken leg quarters (generally going for .70-.90/lb, which is better than a whole bird where I'm from). The leg quarters are especially important because they are fattier so when you roast them you can render a lot of schmaltz (chicken grease) out of it. You can use schmaltz just like bacon grease, it's great stuff. The other advantage over mince here is that you get the bones, which you can boil into stock or add when you're making rice and beans for more flavor.  I'm a big chicken leg quarters proselytizer."

budgetfood,2dv1ee,aclave1,16,Tue Aug 19 23:02:24 2014 UTC,"The most important thing here is filling calories. You can buy like 3 dozen eggs at once for about 5 dollars, they come in a big square thing. That's 18 eggs per week, less than 3 per day. So buy two of those. Rice and pasta are pretty cheap too, you could make stir fry with some soy sauce, rice, and eggs. You can buy a couple onions to flavor it, though onions don't provide many calories. I've seen giant cans of sweet potatoes which should have plenty of sugar and calories. Bread is pretty cheap, go with whole wheat. Look at the back of it, and the first ingredient should say whole grain, not enriched grain. Whole wheat tastes like shit in my opinion, but it's much more filling and lasts longer. There's also steal cut oatmeal which sits in your stomach for a very long time.   In general, try to buy the biggest package of whatever because those are typically cheapest. Most stores have a price per unit somewhere on the shelf, it's basically a "" bang for your buck"" indicator. The lower the unit price, the better. If they don't have that, just whip out your phone's calculator and do some division! The price of the item÷the quantity is the unit price.   Hope this helps!"
budgetfood,2dv1ee,locolarue,6,Mon Aug 18 05:51:59 2014 UTC,"eggs are a definite budget necessity and getting whole wheat instead of white is a good tip but sadly I'm too poor now to get anything in bulk, that's why I got the beans and rice ahead of time."

I'd also suggest food banks. Personally, me and my roommate live off of burritos and pasta. Sausage or bulk chicken, store brand canned beans, corn, and tomatoes, whatever sauce is on sale. Peanut butter sandwiches for breakfast, make a huge pot if pasta or burritos and eat the leftovers for lunch.

You can also cook some broccoli in the broth before putting the noodles in to add something green.  check out /r/ramen for some other ideas."

Look for maybe a preopening of a restaurant, chili cookoffs, see if any restaurants give away free items if a certain sports team does something, stuff like that. In my area if the baseball team scores 6 runs you can walk in and get a 6pc mcnugget for free no purchase necessary.  Can't hurt to throw an ad on craigslist saying you're a little short on cash and would love an opportunity to be a food critic for an aspiring chef (usually young chefs love the opportunity to impress a stranger and cook up a big meal!).  I've had a lot of friends in a similar situation and while they are content with staying on a frugal diet, a special meal or food item can really lift the spirits when it's free. Best of luck!"

Maybe a headline like ""Aspiring young chef? FOOD CRITIC""   Then just in the actual post say something how you went to culinary school and are a studying sommelier, and maybe how in order to do that you need to get more experience judging different flavors and some experience in the industry, therefore you'd love to offer your services for free.  In doing so you can offer a thorough critique, pointers, and friendly conversation in exchange for a meal prepared by the chef to be. If you want don't even have to mention that you're strapped for cash right now. .  Also I think with your experience it could be very plausible to offer your services to several local restaurants. Just go in and introduce yourself to the manager, explain your situation how you're well qualified and are pursuing further experience and education in the taste industry. And how you'd be willing to come in and maybe help sample some possible expansions to the menu offering your professional opinion on them or give the chef an authentic surprise rewiew. Just be polite and explain how it could be a win win where you offer your services for free in exchange for hard experience taste testing as well ""what they hope is a delicious cuisine"". Will be pretty hit or miss but hey you have the qualifications and I know lots of places that would love this opportunity"

I just tossed in the cilantro and lime at the start.  Slice and sautee the vegetables. I added some vinegar because I felt like it.  Debone and cut up the chicken, season it (with the cayenne and the spice mix) and sear it. Make sure the pan is HOT when you put it in and don't let the grease pool or it'll get rubbery.   I'd do a few things differently next time. I only made 3 bowls before I ran out of chicken but I have a ton of beans and rice left. Could double the yield just by doubling the chicken.

It consists of taco-flavored ground beef served on a bed of rice. It also frequently comes with shredded cheese, lettuce, tomato, topped off with salsa. It is a very common meal in Okinawa,  and is often served as a school lunch.  The dish was created in 1984 by Matsuzo Gibo and introduced at two of his cafes, Parlor Senri and King Tacos, located just a minute from the main gate of Camp Hansen in Kin, Okinawa.  Taco rice is a popular dish among U.S.military personnel stationed in Okinawa as lunch or late night food. KFC put it on their menu throughout Japan in 1996, and Yoshinoya (nationwide gyudon restaurant) serves it in the chain's restaurants in Okinawa prefecture since 2004. It is one of the most well-known dishes of the Okinawan cuisine outside of Okinawa.

They're great because there's an inner lid on the dip portion and another lid on top so even if the dip does leak (though I've never seen that happen) it still won't get all over your kid's lunchbox or backpack.

It would probably bee good with less or no whites. Not a sauce lover, so I never got the recipe. But if you're a sauce person you might be able to improvise something.  Or try crumble them as close to a powder as possible and mix them in dressing for sallad, or maybe hamburger dressing. It should make it thick and rich. I haven't tried it, but if you like a fried egg on your burger this cold be a hit.  Maybe use the yolk powder in something already containing eggs, like an omelette or pancakes. Just let the mix rest after adding the yolks to allow eventual small lumps to absorb the liquid, then mix again before cooking.  I've never faced your problem, so I'm just pulling things from my tired brain. If it turns out awful; please don't blame me. Good luck!"

budgetfood,2d5o4h,bringindabacon,3,Sun Aug 10 22:20:33 2014 UTC,"A can of tomatoes has tomatoes, maybe some juice, and usually some type of citric acid and maybe salt.  A jar of cheap salsa has all sorts of preservatives and additives that aren't necessary.  On top of that a can of tomatoes is $1.20, a habanero is $0.30, throw in some chili powder, cumin, and salt and you've got maybe an extra $0.40 of spices.  Your salsa was $4? My tomato can and spices was under $2 and has the added benefit of having no preservatives or other additives.  You can even throw the other $2 to a bunch of cilantro to really liven the dip up.  Though I'd suggest you grow herbs in Mason jars outside so you can have free cilantro whenever you'd like."

Just because it is cheap doesn't make it junk.  In Minnesota, we have an extremely high population of Latino or Hispanic residents.  This dictates salsa to some extent.  Try and find the ""start up"" salsa brands.  Newer brands often can't afford multiple preservatives that aren't sodium based.  thanks for the tip about cilantro!"

budgetfood,2d2nv3,Prtyvacant,9,Sat Aug 9 18:57:56 2014 UTC,They don't have cornbread in the UK because you can't boil it.

If you're feeling adventurous this chicken biryani is cheap and cheerful, although maybe not to everyone's taste.

Everything can be made the night before, scrub and clean the potatoes the night before.  1.5 to 2 hours before dinner,  load the spuds into the oven at 350. Do not keep opening the oven door.  That many potatoes well take at least an hour to cook. If you want to have a veggie serve it with a couple of bags of salad, and store dressing.  For dessert you could do something easy like brownies ( use a mix, make the day before) and ice cream.  Easy way to serve Ice cream to a large group. Get the ice cream that comes in a square box.  Open the box all the way up. And cut it Into slices and cut each slice into two.  You can do it the day before with out removing the cream from the box, and then refreeze it.   Good luck."

However, If I see it during the week, I can be sure it'll still be there by Sunday Evening when they mark it down with the 25% off before tossing it out the next day.  I buy it and put it straight into the freezer if I dont have immediate plans for it.  mmm...ground lamb...."
budgetfood,2cwn85,spyyked,3,Sun Aug 10 21:58:38 2014 UTC,"Ground lamb is perfect for gyros! Take that lamb and add a couple teaspoons of salt, then mix together by hand and stick in the fridge. The next morning, pulse some garlic, onions, oregano, bacon, and pepper in the food processor and add the meat, then pulse until it comes together to a smooth puree. Refrigerate that puree for a few hours to make it easier to shape if you'd like, or just continue to forming it into a brick-ish mound. Bake it at 300 for about half an hour, until internal temperature is 155, then let it rest for at least 15 minutes. To serve, cut off slices and fry them with no additional fat, then serve with diced tomatoes, tzatziki, hummus, cucumbers - whatever you like! I especially like this served with or on pita."

budgetfood,2cwn85,bluesox,8,Sat Aug 9 20:48:31 2014 UTC,"When chopping vegatables you frequently end up with ends that you don't use. Onion ends, celery ends etc. Put these into a bag in the freezer and use that bag when making broth/stock later.  If you want to go REALLY out of the box, mealworms are used culinary in many parts of the globe and can easily be farmed at home. It is probably the least expensive form of animal protein you can get.  Got friends who aren't as good of cooks as you? Make a deal with them that they buy ingredients and you cook for you and them.  Sprout dried beans for a nutritious veggie.  Always drink water. Cook in bulk, freeze individual portions to microwave later. A single pork chop can season a pot of beans for five people.  Grow as much as you can of your own food. Zucchini, tomatoes, peppers all grow fine in containers. If you want to save money on container, use empty 1 gallon milk or OJ jugs.  Eat out as rarely as possible. But if you do go to fast food, get extra ketchup, mustard salt pepper etc.  When ever you go to a farmer's market bring business cards with what services you can provide. Write ""willing to barter"" on the cards.  Learn a hobbycraft, (quilting, knitting, chain maile, jewlery making etc.) attempt to trade your finished products at farmers markets.  Go to the farmers market right before it closes and make offers on the entire stock of what a seller has left. You won't get the best picking, but you are likely to get really good deals since you've saved the seller the effort of packing anything back up.  There is nothing dangerous or unhealthy about MSG and it can really spruce up inexpensive ingredients. If you have a significant other, when it is time to grocery shop, each of you go to a different store. Text or call prices to each other and only buy from whichever store is cheapest. Works best if there are two competing stores nearby so you don't negate your savings by having to take two different vehicles. Identify EVERY weed that grows in your yard. Find out which ones are edible.  Apply for assistance. Many people don't know that they qualify.  Most foodbanks do not require you to prove anything. If you are struggling, but it doesn't look like it on paper, find a food bank in your area."

It will save you a lot of cash.  Farmers markets often have begs that are misshapen or broken but fine in basket under there stalls (you can still see them) they are cheaper.    Cook and store in season.  I save drink bottles. In the fall I get a box of tomatoes and stew them, add cooked onion and salt and pepper (often some basil as well) store them in the drink bottles and freeze them.  I have enough tomato stock for the year which I use to make soups, and tomato sauce.   I have also made my own tomato paste this way,  and frozen it in silicone cup cake pans. Then I transfer it to a bag.    As a child my family would do nothing more then take the core out of the tomato and then freeze them whole.  You can just as easily cook them down in the winter as in the summer.   When cheese is on sale I buy extra and put it in the freezer.  I use my chopper to make my own grated cheese which I toss with a bit of corn starch and store in the fridge. Much cheaper then buying pre grated cheese. Plus you can make custom mixes."

It normally saves a lot of money to freeze  a bunch of dinners in advance since you can stock up on supplies when you see a deal, and it keeps you from eating out due to laziness of not wanting to cook something.

The one I go to serves a southeast asian population where fresh leafy greens are a staple, and that type  of produce (lettuce, cabbage, green onions, cilantro) always seem to be good quality and way cheaper. A bunch of green onions runs me 99¢ at Safeway but I can get 3/$1 at the Asian store.   Fruits like apples generally are hit or miss, except lemons and limes which are good and also much cheaper."

Here are the staples that I think you should look at:    rice  beans  lentils - can be used in a rice medley or soup or something but can also be mixed in with ground beef to basically double that amount of ""meat"" that you have while altering the taste very little  pearled barley  oats (old fashioned/steel cut) - made into oatmeal or used as part of other meals such as home made granola or oatmeal cookies or whatever  flour - makes bread and other baked goods  pasta  pasta sauce or even the cheap cans of tomato sauce  cheap spices and cheap baking staples if the person doesn't have them already (baking powder, baking soda, margarine, oil, sugar, etc.)  whatever meat is on sale and the cheapest.  Don't be picky.  If it's close to its expiration date, then freeze it.  broth, bullion cubes, etc.  whatever vegetables the person wants. Try to stick to cheaper things, but most common veggies are relatively cheap.  Potatoes are usually cheap and are nutritious and filling.   Here is a recipe that I use a lot for a cheap batch of meals.  I don't worry about following it exactly either.  If you don't have something then either leave it out or substitute it for something else.  If you have something that isn't listed there, toss it in anyway.  If the person doesn't cook much, then you might want to search for easy recipes.  Soups are easy, but several other things are as well.  Pasta is crazy easy.  Home made is always cheaper, though, so that's the way to go for something like this.  I agree with the recommendation for Aldi that /u/Samantha797 made.  That will really stretch that $60.  Maybe add milk to the list if you want.  I leave it out because I'm lactose intolerant and therefore have very little experience making meals with it."

budgetfood,2cu78d,lovelylayout,3,Thu Aug 7 01:30:52 2014 UTC,"An excellent way to get more bang for your buck, if they like yogurt, is to just buy one tiny little thing of yogurt, and a bunch of milk, and make your own yogurt with the milk. It's super simple. Heat the milk up to 185, let it cool down to 120, stir in like a couple spoonfulls of the pre-made yogurt (make sure to get the kind with active cultures on the label) and then let it sit someplace warm for a while, like the oven with the light on. You will know its yogurt when it turns into yogurt. Voila! yogurt.   I know they sound decadent, but all a quiche really is is a crust, which you can make for like 10 cents worth of flour, and some eggs all beaten up, and literally any kind of vegetable or meat you have in the entire fridge. I like to make these at the end of the week, when I'm running out of ideas and have random scraps of stuff left over.   Hope this helps!"

I used to volunteer at a church to cook community meals, we had a lot of people come who needed the food because of financial problems, but also a lot of people who were just older and lonely and needed the conversation. I always ate with the group, and it didn't feel awkward or anything. Most communities have charities or churches organized to cover dinner most nights of the week, you just have to look them up.  There is also no reason not to sign up for food stamps, look into charities like the local food bank, etc. by providing your friend with these resources, you are ""teaching a man to fish"" until he can get back on his feet.

Like everyone else said, but I'll add my own what gets me through the week (family of 3)  Beans, dried is cheaper, canned is quicker Dry pasta, almost always on sale and you can buy it in bulk cheap Rice Meat in bulk, frozen into individual packs (usually chicken breasts) Seasonal produce, so right now usually I see watermelon, peaches, strawberries, corn, and other stone fruits on sale for dirt cheap.  Onions and peppers can be bought pretty cheap and make a good base for most soups and casseroles  Deli meat if you can find it cheap makes good lunches Bread, to go with sandwiches or just as toast Potatoes, you can make a lot with potatoes and they are filling on their own, plus a big bag is usually found at dirt cheap prices   That's also really nice of you and I bet that your friend appreciates it very much!"

We just make new yogurt out of the last few ounces of the old yogurt.  No offense to the folks who own and love their yogurt makers but if money is what you are looking to save on yogurt or if storage space is at a premium in your kitchen there is no need for this device."

For anyone curious here's what you do:  -Heat a covered pot of milk (can use any type I believe but I always use whole milk or 2%) on the stove until it boils and then turn off the heat.    -Let the milk stand for a few minutes then stir in a spoon or two of some yogurt (store bought, leftover doesn't matter).  Let sit covered overnight in a warmish place (60-70 F)and smell it the next morning.    -If it smells like yogurt and looks like yogurt, its yogurt.  If it smells like rotted milk, its rotted milk.  Throw it out.  If it smells like yogurt but seems a little thin, leave it out for another 1/2 a day and check it again.    -From here you can strain it to make greek style yogurt or just toss it in the refrigerator.

Have you ever made Rice A Roni?  Whenever you make Rice A Roni, you have to start by browning it.  You're browning the vermicelli.  Vermicelli is a form of pasta (I just looked up the definition, and it says it's similar to spaghetti, actually!).  I don't think anyone questions this, because the vermicelli in rice a roni looks so much like rice. :)  And it's mixed with rice, which soaks up the water.   I seldom eat meat, myself, so I probably wouldn't add meat if I didn't have to.  Someone wrote in the comments though that soy sauce and cheese don't mix, and I really was drooling over that cheese on  the ramen (my mom used to add a big slice of cheese on my ramen when I was a kid, I used to love that, and I hate ramen now, because I hate the big noodle soup, but if it was a little noodle flat cheese uhh..mess, I might be able to do it. haha.  maybe once.  if i have a lot of tummy medicine close by).  Maybe I should just stick with your idea.  I have organic ramen in my cupboard, but the packets that come with mine are  a bit bland.

budgetfood,2cnbwd,DigitalCatcher,3,Tue Aug 5 05:30:08 2014 UTC,"Recipe for jerk chicken   Not OP... and honestly, I've never made it as well as I've had it made for me (which bothers me, I used to be a chef).   Still, basic recipe:   Spring onion (bunch), ginger root (~ thumb size?), garlic (3/4 cloves, or a good squirt of puree), 1 shallot (or 1/2 a small white onion), scotch bonnet chillies (I use 3, de-seed for less heat), thyme (not loads), lime juice (4/5 tbsp or the juice of 1 lime. Next time I want to try adding some zest too), dark soy sauce (decent shake, not loads. 1/2 tbsp?), 3-4 tbsp brown sugar and 1tbsp ground allspice (may be pimento in the US) and a glug of oil.   Play with amounts to suit your taste, the key flavours are the scotch bonnets, the allspice and the ginger (arguably the sugar and the lime too).   Blend that lot, taste (adjust for personal preference & seasoning... if it's too salty with the soy, add more sugar, you want a thick-ish paste, rather than a thin marinade). Smear all over chicken of whatever kind you prefer (I tend to do drumsticks and thighs as they're cheaper, slash the surfaces or stuff the marinade under the skin too).   BBQ (slowly, over smoke if possible) or 45 mins in a medium oven (180c/350f)."

Bread, certain cured meats, and mustard along with fresh tomato make good sandwiches, as would peanut butter and honey or banana. Pancake mix would just require water. Canned soups and pasta sauce would all be fine as long as you could eat them in one sitting. Canned tuna, vegetables like corn and peas, and olive oil could be tossed with pasta with a little salt and pepper. You could also mix tuna with mustard for sandwiches. Oatmeal, dried fruit, brown sugar, and cinnamon for breakfast. You could add peanut/other nut butters there too. Fresh vegetables and fruits like apples, cucumber, tomato, banana, corn, peppers, and onion can all be left on a counter for some time. Cucumber, tomato, and onion can all be tossed together with olive oil, salt, and pepper to make a tasty salad, or sliced and put on your cured meat sandwiches.   If you're in the US, I wouldn't leave eggs out as all eggs from supermarkets are washed and susceptible to bacteria growth. If you buy them from a farmer's market, they'd probably be fine though."

If your new job has longer hours and more physical or mental demand,  chances are you won't want to spend the extra time at first,  while you are ramping up,  to do an overnight soak on beans, take longer to cook a rice based meal,  or do a lot of prep work to eat quite as healthy as you have been with a less demanding job.     Definitely get some of these things, they are excellent staples.   But take the time to do a slow walk around the store, reading labels,  and asking yourself ""if I'm exhausted at the end of a day,  is this food quick,  easy,  and within my nutritional desires?""  Or at least not super unhealthy.     Canned tomato products and ""cream of"" soups would be on my list,  as well as tuna,  olives,  pickles,  condiments,  salad dressing,  cooking oil,  powdered milk,  sauces (my store brands are very tasty), Mac n cheese,  things like canned oranges and dark chocolate for a quick treat, with the benefit of the dopamine from the chocolate.   Maybe a little to the side of the pure survival staple list, but those things are are more nice to have on hand than necessary.   And you are going to want to treat yourself without feeling guilty.   Get store brands on most things when you can.   With a lot of the staples, you'll never notice a difference.  As someone else said,  sales!   Congrats and good luck!"
budgetfood,2cj3gc,Middygal,6,Mon Aug 4 00:21:34 2014 UTC,"Along these lines, some simmer sauces would probably be a good addition.

I have a few (Thai Green Curry, Indian Butter Chicken, Molé etc) at all times for when I'm too lazy/tired/it's late.

Keep in mind ground spices last for about 6 moths and whole for a bout a year. You can still use them after but they aren't as good. Some can be frozen.  I'd also add pouched/canned meat to this if you like any of it.  If you have a deep freeze or space in your freezer then I'd stock up on freezable perishables that you use a lot of. Freezing your own fruit, getting a bunch of chicken breasts and partitioning them for freezing, that sort of thing.  To freeze something you want it frozen as fast as possible. Place a sheet pan in the freezer and get it cold. You may line it if what your freezing might stick (you can also already have it in the packaging although it will slow the freezing). Layer your freezable in a single layer and put it somewhere the air can circulate. Once they are hard store them in an airtight package and your good to go.  I wish you luck!"

It's also free of water, so it's incredibly dense, versatile, and easy to store.  Carbs? Rice is fantastic, but beans contain more fibre and even a healthy serving of mid-quality protein.  Omegas are the leaders of the fat world, and if you're looking for a pure, dense source of these essential fatty acids, flax is your friend, though it's also very carb and fibre heavy, and there have been some studies that suggest large quantities of flax to be detrimental to digestive health, causing blockages when not consumed with adequate water.

I used to work at a place that used Frank's as its base for anything mild/hot, and we had another half-dozen flavors as well. It wasn't a well-thought-out plan but the idea behind it all was you choose a flavor sauce, and then a temperature for it (eg. ""teriyaki-hot"", ""honey mustard-mild"", ""jerk-xx"", etc.) when we should've done one or the other, not both.  Point is, I put together and tried out a ton of flavor combinations because of mis-fires, orders people decided they didn't like, and extra leftovers. Frank's holds its own pretty well over most of them except the teriyaki (washed it off entirely), honey mustard or white bbq (mayo in the mix coated it too much), or jerk (spices mixed in and you couldn't tell what's what except the vinegar)."

budgetfood,2cgcn3,Bueen,1 point,Sun Aug 3 09:57:07 2014 UTC,Quick question about the frying method: how do I avoid splattering oil everywhere? Is it all about temperature? Every time I try to fry chicken in a pan or pot I end up with oil burns and spots all over my stove...usually as a result of the first 30 seconds of cooking in the oil.
budgetfood,2cgcn3,dudemann,2,Sun Aug 3 13:54:10 2014 UTC,"Pat the meat dry, its moisture coming in contact with the hot oil that causes that to happen. Also, drop it in slowly and use a deep pot. This won't completely stop it from splattering, but should help quite a bit."
budgetfood,2cgcn3,charbonxii,2,Sun Aug 3 08:03:08 2014 UTC,"Definitely what Bueen said. Any moisture in/on something will cause big time bubble splatter action, but there's no way to completely avoid oil splatter. I don't know if its meant for this but I bought this big round metal screen I put over pots/pans if I'm frying on a stove top. It was like $5 and it's just a wire mesh filter thing with a handle so it catches most of the splatter and then you throw it in the dish washer.  Also, if you're kind of new to frying, be aware of 2 things: if you're messing with chicken, you might want to invest in a thermometer to make sure the inside is up to temp to avoid raw/pink chicken (outside cooks fast, inside takes a while, especially with bone-in meat)... and anything you drop in the oil brings down the overall temp a few degrees easily so you need to give it a few minutes in between drops to get back up to temp or you'll have dangerous, halfway-warm, oily food."

budgetfood,2cclv7,itz_working,18,Fri Aug 1 17:01:04 2014 UTC,"My standard answer: pork shoulder. It's plenty cheap, and if you have a slow cooker, smoker, or even just a Dutch oven, you can turn it into pulled pork and add that to a ton of different dishes.   My other recommendation is to buy chickens whole, cut them up for the meat you need, and then turn the carcasses into stock. I'll turn the last bits of meat and bone from two carcasses, an onion/leek, carrot, and some herbs into three quarts of seriously flavorful stock in a pressure cooker. In two hours, a pressure cooker draws out more nutrients than I get from 8 hours simmering in a stock pot--seriously, the bones turn to dust with a little pressure. There's so much gelatin in the stock that it basically solidifies when refrigerated.   Last but not least: canned tuna. I'd recommend getting a good salad recipe (I make mine with hard boiled Eggs and avocado), or learning how to make croquettes (you'll have to suffer through a bit of carbs in the breadcrumbs, though). Would also recommend getting the kind in the envelopes instead of cans--hardly any extra water or oil inside, so the flavor is great."

budgetfood,2cclv7,Oafah,7,Fri Aug 1 18:27:48 2014 UTC,"5 protein per egg isn't fantastic, but it's not bad either, especially if you're trying to keep your carbs down as eggs are 100% carb free. But it's more something that's going to tip the balance more than be a solution in and of itself. Egg whites are good if you're out to avoid dietary cholesterol, but you lose most of the nutrients when you avoid the yolk. Either way, it's a tradeoff.  But I have to disagree with the statement that eggs aren't cheap. I'm buying them in the 18-pack right now for $3.28, so around 18-19 cents an egg. And that's with me insisting on getting the cage-free variety.  Edit: While low in carbs, each egg does contain roughly a half gram each."

As someone mentioned, load up and freeze if there's any sales.   Often its cheaper to get a whole food rather than one cut down. By this I mean, where I live its often cheaper to get a whole chicken, then it is to buy the breasts or thighs. If you cook it up you can then use the bones for soup. If you're doing something like keto where you need to be really low carb, be careful with the carrots and other root veggies. Leeks I believe aren't too bad, but its been a while since I looked.  Butchers can be surprisingly better deals if you have a freezer (we can get freezer packs here that will save me $25, though I'm buying $100 worth in a go).

Google the specific cut of meat on your smart phone before you're purchase to make sure it's high protein.   As far a pork butt\shoulder in roast form goes, a lot of the content is fat and has a fairly mediocre calorie:protein ratio.

As a budget-gainer, powdered whey is actually the cheapest and best source of protein you can buy, and believe it or not, it's incredibly flexible. It's an obvious choice for smoothies, but also makes a nice dessert topping when whipped with almond milk and some fruit. Although some argue that heating it is bad (denaturing, wiki it) it is actually incredibly useful in high-protein baking. I have a recipe for low-cal cake that'll blow your mind and cost you mere dollars per batch.  As for non-whey protein sources, canned meat is by far the cheapest source. Check dollarama for canned mackerel, which is not only high in protein, but rich in omega 3 fatty acids. Tuna is also a good substitute and makes a nice substitute for any baked savoury dish calling for chicken."
budgetfood,2cclv7,funchy,5,Fri Aug 1 17:25:03 2014 UTC,Dried beans are also decent source of protein and are excessively cheap.

budgetfood,2cclv7,timevast,1 point,Fri Aug 1 21:00:23 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure that's true that ""proteins"" are expensice.   It depends on what foods people are calling ""proteins"".  Every one thinks about meat first.   But meat isn't a ""protein""; it's a food higher in protein (all well as saturated fat).   Technically all living things have protein - plants too.     Plants get a bad rap for not having enough protein,  but that's because the arbitrary way the government lists nutrition of foods.  Although people's intake should be limited by calories per day, instead the government guidelines is based on whatever size they deem a serving. It gives a skewed idea of what foods are ""proteins"".  Per calorie,  broccoli has 11grams which surprises most people.    If you can get free of the idea of using animal products, there are less expensive sources of protein in the diet.  Animals are costly to raise."
budgetfood,2cclv7,Gold900,1 point,Sat Aug 2 15:27:54 2014 UTC,"The problem is, the nutritional guidelines don't take protein quality into account. Broccoli is indeed a superfood, but the protein it contains is lacking in several essential amino acids. Whey, casein, egg whites, most meats, and even soy are going to give you a corrected amino acid score close to 1.0, whereas most plants don't even crack 0.7."

budgetfood,2cclv7,Gold900,2,Sat Aug 2 14:43:44 2014 UTC,"Here's a couple things I do:   (BTW I eat kinda a paleo diet: 100% clean, high protein and very low carb. I can't eat any grains, legumes, nuts, or fruit and the only dairy I can handle is yogurt that I can be certain is lactose free. I'm also on a strict budget)  Home made Greek Yogurt:   I sterilize all my gear first by boiling it.   4 lt whole milk  1 cup live yogurt (read the label, find one with as many live cultures as possible and no additivessugar, flavour etc)  Heat the milk gently to 82c (180F)  Remove from heat and cool to 46c (115F).   Mix in a little of your milk with the yogurt starter to make it easier to stir through the milk.  Add to the milk and gently stir it to inoculate the milk.  Leave it in a luke-warm place to maintain the temperature for 12 to 24 hours (24 if you're lactose intolerant, 12 if you're not)  At this point I take enough off to use as a starter for my next batch and store it in a sterilized jar in the fridge.  Once it's set strain it through some fine mesh fabric in a sieve/colander over a bowl til you have the consistency you like.  You can use the whey that comes off it in a bunch of different ways (almost all of the protein is still in the yogurt)  Beef Bone Broth. You can source meaty bones from local butchers for free, or for next to nothing. Hard to calc out the protein content of it but IMO this is a great addition to my daily diet, definitely worth including in the diet for a cheap boost to the daily protein intake plus a bunch of other beneficial goodies!   Loads of recipes online and simple to make so I wont burden you with a recipe here. If you have a slow cooker you're good to go.  Not sure where you live but if you're concerned about the whole grain fed meat thing try to get grass fed bones. I'm in New Zealand so I'm lucky there, we don't grain feed our beef animals.  Any cheap tough gristly cut of meat will become the most succulent tasty morsel if you have a slow cooker!"

I have yet to go through the first bag (apparently it is kinda bad for the yeast, but I keep mine in the freezer and have had no problems yet) and I bake quite a bit. YouTube has tons of videos on kneading and techniques. It is mostly time consuming, but pretty therapeutic (kneading takes a bit of energy) and fresh bread is AMAZING. And it's cheap, depending on the type of bread and price of flour. Plain sandwich bread is simply yeast, water, flour, oil, and tiny bits of sugar and salt. If you like making things by hand, definitely look into it."

Factoring in prep time (assuming minimum wage earning potential) plus the extra electricity expended to blast the oven, is it actually cost effective to bake your own loaves at home?"
budgetfood,2cb0b0,jas25666,2,Sat Aug 2 21:11:56 2014 UTC,"Bread takes a couple of hours but most of it is hands-off work (actually doing work is about 10 minutes). Assuming $10/hr, and making two loaves at once (most recipes generally call for it and it's the same amount of work) that's like $0.80 per loaf in ""labour"". I priced ingredients recently, and I was getting about $0.70 per loaf in ingredients (admittedly I bought a brick of yeast which makes it much cheaper). Electricity varies based on your oven (mine sucks) but can't be any more than $0.50... So you're looking at around $2 a loaf, $1.20 if you choose not to count labour for whatever reason (you're doing it while watching TV or something leisurely anyway, you like doing it, you want to impress someone with the smell oh my god the smell is glorious, etc).  Generally the rule of thumb is that it's not cost competitive with the super basic white sandwich bread you can get at Wal Mart (but the quality doesn't even compare, so there's that). But where you save is when you're making ""artisan"" breads with multiple grains and special toppings. That's where store-bought bread gets expensive.  Also keep in mind once you learn the basic techniques you can basically do a bunch of other things the same way, not just ""bread."" Dinner rolls, burger and hot dog buns, doughs of all kinds, etc. So it could be a worthwhile skill to learn even if you're not doing it to replace every day sandwich bread."

Most fruit, especially berries, will be also far more (though they can be worth it).  Even local favorites like corn aren't really any cheaper than even the premium grocery stores around here.  Seems like the organic and eat-local movements have driven up the price extremely.  Good deals can be had on things like greens, spring onions, herbs -- anything quick-to-grow, really (and herbs are bizarrely expensive in grocery stores, like $4 for a few sprigs of mint).

Put it in a disposable container and refrigerate. Can last up to a month or better yet, freeze it, if it can be into small cubes even better.   For Puerto Rican Beans:   1 - 15oz cans of beans(white/pink/red  or kidney beans) 1 -tablespoon of sofrito 1/3 of green pepper or canned red pepper 1 - small yellow onion 1 clove of garlic 6oz or 3/4 of tomato sauce 1 - chicken,  beef or ham bullion cube 1 peeled russet potato(or similar) cut into large cubes (about 8-12oz) 1/2 packet of sazon you can find sazon and boullion examples here 1 tbsp of olive oil 1/2 cup of water salt and pepper to taste   Put onions, peppers and garlic first with the oil and water, heat on med-high for 5-7 minutes.  Add the rest of the ingredients, put it on medium and cook for 25 minutes constantly stirring. after that, put it over rice and enjoy. I sometimes like to add an egg to get some extra protein in there and if i want more to save for later, i put 2 cans of beans and add about an extra 1/2 of each ingredient listed above.  All of this cost me here about 10-13 bucks and that amount of beans will last me for a week. It seems like work but its not, its easy and fast. After a while youll remember the entire process and do it by heart.   If you choose not to make sofrito you can always buy it Goya brand.  Dont be afraid to buy some of these online, At least I have when the deals are too good to pass.  Edit: formatting"

Maybe they have plenty of baby supplies on hand and didn't have to use some of that money for diapers or child care.

budgetfood,2c6h27,jmurphy42,7,Thu Jul 31 03:40:35 2014 UTC,"Plan your protein!  What kind of meat are you going to base your soup on?  I have recently started using Kielbasa to bring down costs, and have switched to more of a gumbo style or chowder style ""soup"".  When you decide on the stock and the protein, the available vegetables should present themselves and the optimum spices are fairly obvious.  When I have chicken, I will use a bit of chicken stock or cream of chicken soup.  When I have beef, I make a hearty stew or a delicious/simple chili.  Kielbasa gets made into gumbo or chowder.  Corned beef on sale?  It goes in with cabbage and potatoes whether it is March or not.  My chili is really getting dialed in, is ridiculously cheap (if I use ground beef), and I can eat it for days straight (in a variety of ways...such as dip for chips or filling for burritos) without getting tired of it.    My ""recipes"" are as simple and varied as ingredients and money allow.  I always keep potatoes, carrots, celery, canned beans, frozen/canned vegetables, onions, garlic, and a variety of soup stocks/""cream of"" soups.  My spice cabinet is pretty full, but it is always important to have the stuff you use a lot in bulk.    As an example, here are the ingredients to the 3-days worth of chili that I made yesterday in my crock-pot (and will be eating for at least 2 meals today as well).  I usually have a cheap portion of beef as well as half a pound of ground beef...but this batch I only had burger, so I used a pound.   Pound of burger 2 cans of Kidney Beans (1 light 1 dark) 2 cans of tomatoes (1 diced 1 stewed) 1 small can tomato sauce half an onion 3 cloves of garlic roughly 2 cups of frozen peppers (red, green, gold) punch of salt, punch of pepper, generous chili powder and garlic salt, fair amount of cumin and Monterey Steak Seasoning.  For this batch, I also added a half a packet of bad powdered enchilada sauce.  Even at my small town supermarket in the middle of nowhere, that is about 5 dollars worth of food that will be most of what I eat for 3 days straight...happily."

Texas Red Chili (warning: this is NOT cheap, but it's delicious. It can be bulked up and stretched even further by adding a couple of cans of black or pinto beans and canned diced tomatoes... or cutting the amount of meat and subbing in those ingredients) Chicken Chili Verde Chicken and Gnocchi Soup (I bulk this out with more veggies than the recipe calls for- if you don't want the soup too thick add additional stock) Spicy Tuscan Soup (You can use Italian sausage instead of breakfast sausage, but it's often more expensive.  All of the recipes above make at least 6 good portioned servings each.  As for making chicken soup...  You can make your own stock (I usually do), use stock/broth that is store-bought, or use bullion. I usually use the brand Better Than Bullion instead of the little dry cube kind. I usually start with 4 - 8 cups of stock/broth. Sometimes I cook the chicken directly in it if I only have raw chicken, but if I have a lot of leftovers from something like a whole roaster I just chop that up and throw it in. Then I add:   Shredded cooked chicken (2 chicken breasts is enough for 1 pot, you can add more if you want) Celery Carrots Onion Garlic (Insert other veggie you like in soup) Salt Pepper Herbs (usually stuff like thyme, basil, sage- do it one or two at a time and taste as you go) Carb (rice or pasta- you can either put it uncooked in the soup and cook it, or put it in already cooked... just be aware that cooking it in the soup will absorb a lot of the liquid and reduce how much you have)   Minus the rice or pasta, add all your ingredients to the liquid, bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer for about 30 minutes. If the rice or pasta is already cooked add it after that and eat whenever you want, or add it uncooked and give it the amount of time it dictates on the package."

(If you use dried beans, which I strongly suggest, soak them over night and rinse before adding them to the crock). Add the spices you prefer, but go a little light on the salt to start. The hock is salty and you can add more at the end if needed. Cook it up, dish it up, add a dash of apple cider vinegar to your bowl and enjoy. Even better if you have some corn bread."

I save my veggie scraps left over cooked veggies, meat bones and sauces in the freezer. I make stock when there is enough to fill the slow cooker to the top.  Add every thing in plus a few cloves of garlic and cook all day. Stirring the bones and veggies will give you cloudy stock, so try not too.  Strain your broth, store in disposable water bottle what you aren't using that night.    In a pot add 5 -6 cups of broth and 2 large potatoes. Cook till the potatoes are very soft. Add the chopped up stems from two  bunches of broccoli and some florets, and  1 and a half cups of cheese (any kind except mozzarella , a mix is best)   When cheese is melted blend then together using a hand blender thin with milk.   Because of the cheese this soup is filling. But still has lots of veggies.   I often have leftover cheese so this works well for me.

It was all stuff I already had in my pantry and I only used half a can of on sale Spam, so I estimate the total cost to be around $2-$2.50."

Cut one breast in half then into strips   Season with lemon pepper   Throw into hot cast iron and start choping up a green mix  Give some to my rabbit and say good girl (very important step :-))   Pull out chicken and put on top of lettuce with some cheese if you have it and some Italian dressing.   Good, cheap, fast, and surprisingly filling!"
budgetfood,2c2rpv,soarineagle,2,Wed Jul 30 13:18:08 2014 UTC,"My go to meals were pasta and rice bowls.   For pasta, buy two jars pasta sauce, mushrooms, tomatoes, a meat, and one onion.  Cook the meat.  Saute the onion (bonus: with garlic) then add mushrooms. After those are sauteed, add diced tomatoes and all sauce. Season, if you have the stuff. Let simmer at least 30 minutes.  If you want to get real fancy, add a bag of frozen vegetables.  Rice bowls: Cook some rice in a cooker. Bonus flavour: use one can coconut milk instead of the same amount of water, add chopped garlic. Bring a pot of water to boil. Dunk some spinach in, drain after ten seconds. Season blanched spinach with sesame oil and salt. In same boiling water, cook some carrots chopped to about one inch and halved. Add some vinegar. Boil these until you are ready to eat. In another pan, cook some meat with garlic, chile, and sesame oil. Put fixings on a bowl of rice. I always had kimchi, gim, and dried fish on hand to add.  In pan used for meat (still hot), crack one egg. Add one palmful of water. Cover with a lid, bring to medium heat. Cook until film of white on top of yolk is cooked, then put on top of your bowl and break the yolk.   I also eat mac and cheese a lot.  Saute 1/4 onion for every box mac and cheese. Cook a clove of garlic with that.  Chop an apple and warm on the onion. Chop a sausage for every box mac and cheese. Cook. Drain the noodles, add Italian seasoning. Make sauce according to directions, add about two shots cheap white wine. Chop some cheddar into 1 cm cubes, stir in. You don't want them to melt completely. Stir in onion mix and sausage chunks. If you're feeling fancy, spread in a baking dish and cook at 400 until you can't take it any longer. Eat. It's better than straight mac and cheese for taste, texture, and nutrientwise.  These all take about 30 to 45 minutes at the most."

Get a rice cooker for the rice, they're perfect for student cooking (as long as you've turned it on at least 20 minutes before you need it you can forget about it for hours). Boil frozen peas and sweetcorn, fry up the meat, then add the vegetables and rice to the pan and mix it up. Throw on a little soy sauce at the end.    It doesn't sound like much but it's surprisingly tasty, really easy to cook, healthy, and really cheap. Especially if you buy in bulk - dried rice and frozen veg/meat lasts practically forever."

I've done Southwestern Salad with black beans/corn/jalapeno dressing and a chicken tortilla soup combo, Italian salad with a pesto dressing with spinach and white bean soup, plain ol' american salad and chicken noodle soup.. the possibilities are endless and the mason jars make GREAT food storage containers because they're glass and the smells/colors don't leach on to them and they dont warp like plastic. You could do chili/cornbread. I've seen it on Pinterest where you put the chili in a mason jar, put the cornbread mix on top and then bake the whole jar to cook the cornbread. Pop the lid on and your lunch is all together. Chicken salad and bring a side of whole wheat crackers. Especially delicious if you also bring a red apple."

A lunchbox or work fridge and a microwave at work.   Tacos.     Find your favorite taco meat recipe. Cook it with some tomato sauce and split it into 2 sandwich-sized freezer bags, and freeze them. One bag will make two servings of 3 tacos each.  Put the frozen bag of meat in the fridge the night before taking it to work. Chop up a little lettuce, tomato with some cheese and put it in 2 snack bags. Each snack-sized bag will make 3 tacos. Take 3 corn tortillas, a bag of taco meat, and a snack bag of dressings to work. Microwave the tortillas and meat and throw the dressings on top. 3 delicious tacos, and 3 more the next day with the rest of the meat and the other bag of lettuce and whatnot!    Soup    Find your favorte soup recipe. Mine is chop every vegetable in your fridge and simmer in chicken broth for 30min. Freeze it in portions. Take 1 portion to work.    Breakfast burritoes    Cook a packet of sausage and giant serving of scrambled eggs. Place a mixture in a tortilla with cheese, roll it up in foil and throw it in the freezer.    Chili    Find your favorite chili recipe. Cook it.  Freeze it in portions. Take a portion to work and microwave it.    Tuna Salad    Unfortunately this doesn't last long and doesn't freeze well. Makes good sandwiches and salads though!"

You could also plan ahead to make bigger dinner portions and then take leftovers for lunch on somedays...or freeze to have the following week for lunch. Here are some quick ideas for using leftovers creatively:  - if you're cooking potatoes then add a few more to the roasting tin and then add leftover potatoes and any veggies to a scrambled egg mix to make an easy frittata/Spanish omelette.  These reheat very well. - if you're cooking pasta, add an extra handful to the pot and then set aside.  Throw this into a home made salad for an easy pasta salad lunch.  - leftover meat makes a really easy filling for sandwiches, wraps and quesadillas.  An easy quesadilla is simply leftover chicken, taco sauce or salsa and some cheese.  - if you roast a chicken, save the carcass and make your own stock which can then form the basis of a chicken soup."

I like to do simple fried rice (onion, garlic, EVOO, eggs, and a bag of mixed veggies like peas and carrots).  However, my favorite way to prepare is as follows:  Cook rice day before and sit in fridge overnight.   Get rice and stir in some hot mustard (you can get the dehydrated spicy mustard or jars of spicy mustard in the 'Asian' sections of most markets) until spicy enough, and add a good amount of fish sauce.   Defrost frozen veggies under cold tap water and add them and the meat to the rice.  Cook onions in EVOO for a few minutes until slightly translucent, add garlic and cook until fragrant. (If you're using green onions add the white tips and garlic at the same time, and the green stems at the very end).  Dump into pan and push to the sides so as to make a spot to scramble two eggs. Once those are mostly scrambled, stir to combine and heat until rice is just about crispy."

The onion keeps it very moist on the inside and gives a yummy caramelized onion flavor on the outside. Then melting some white american or swiss, mm.  TIP! Try not to break up the meat and over-mix it - i find it makes the burgers kind of rubbery. Use 2 forks to kind of fold everything together and the texture will be much more enjoyable."

First, get your rice or noodles cooking, then cook your ground chicken til it's brown and, well, mostly cooked.  Drain and set aside.  If you like bell peppers - red, orange, or yellow - get one of those.  Add butter, an onion and some garlic to the pan, along with the pepper.  For the spices, just use a lot of curry powder.  My girlfriend says she had a very bland childhood and so now likes to use every spice possible.  We like to add a little bit of cinnamon, a lot of curry powder, some chili powders or ground red pepper (however spicy you like), salt and pepper and..who knows what else.  Anyway, you want to move that around in the pan on a medium high heat for a minute or two to toast your spices.   Turn down the heat to a bit below medium, add the chicken back in.  Toss with spiced veggies and add a little beer or wine to the hot pan to deglaze it.    Then add half of that bottle of Thai Peanut Sauce (it should be pretty cheap at the store, I think you can get a bottle for ~3-4 dolla).  Slap a lid on that pot and turn your heat to low, let them flavors luxuriate.  Throw in some spinach on top to wilt if you feel you're lacking in greens.  You can reduce the liquid however much you like, but it's good and saucy to go on rice.  Very delicious!"

Chop or mince garlic and ginger, an egg (optional), some defrosted spinach, a little soy sauce, a little sesame oil and then put them into dumpling or wonton wrappers. Feel free to experiment with the additional ingredients!  There are plenty of cooking directions online. I just put them in some hot oil, then add water til it's about halfway up the side of the dumplings, put a lid on and let it boil/steam until the liquid is gone, then add 5 tbspn of water, 1 tbspn of plain flour and 1 tbspn of vinegar mixed up into the pan and let it cook until the liquid is gone. Makes nice crunchy bottomed dumplings :)"

budgetfood,2bppy0,AtomicPenny,14,Fri Jul 25 19:46:06 2014 UTC,Exactly.  The first 2 thoughts that popped into my head when I saw this:   That looks disgusting. That doesn't seem very cost efficient.
budgetfood,2bppy0,DoubleTapThat,3,Fri Jul 25 21:18:28 2014 UTC,....people post nasty food ideas on here all the time why the hate if youve never even tried it? Ramen is definitely budget if you have 300 packs in your closet that you got for free. Plus bread can mold and is good for a limited amount of time.
budgetfood,2bppy0,DMdoesGB,3,Sat Jul 26 00:17:06 2014 UTC,"I don't see any budget caviar recipes here.   Yeah, that's because when ""budget foods"" come to mind, caviar would probably be the last possible thing a person thinks of.  If you seriously think that budget eaters are as likely to have caviar on hand as they are ramen noodles, I'm not sure where to even begin.  But even if it was hyperbole, the recipe is still cheap.  Yeah, bread by the slice is cheaper, but I don't think anytime a recipe posted to this sub asks for rice we should question why it wasn't calling for beans instead.  Now, as for what I assume this would taste like, I'd assume it's pretty gross and a complete waste of time to prepare it."

Redbull(I try not to buy those in general, but sometimes I just need something to jolt me awake) anyway, when they have sales on redbull, they are better priced than walmart, target or my grocery store.  I've seen their 8.4 oz redbulls go for 5 for a dollar which is about $1.67,(i've only seen them as low as 1.88 at walmart) the only place i've seen redbull go for cheaper is costco, but you have to buy them in bulk in order to get a decent price."

So, chopped up the cabbage, chopped up a very large head of onion and threw them all into the skillet with some oil. I let them sauté for a bit, initially covering the skillet in order to reduce the volume of the veggies. Threw in a couple of cans of tuna and let that cook for a bit. I wanted to us a binder for all of this, so I threw in 4 eggs, some Sriracha, and a bit of salt. Girlfriend looked at me weird. Honestly, it was pretty tasty, very high in protein, it has the fiber to help digestion (though cabbage will probably make you gassy, as I have found out today), and it was pretty cheap.

Bell peppers, red onion, some nice round cuts of chuck tender, and a box of mushroom and herb couscous.    A package of mini sweet peppers or a red and green bell both work. I like the mini sweets myself. I slice these very thin. Thin sliced red onion. Here you're aiming for the same thickness as the peppers. The chuck tenders come in little 3/4 inch 6 packs from walmart for all of 4-5 bucks for basically two decent portions of steak or three if you're not too hungry. You're going to pull these out of the fridge and season with a generous portion of salt and FRESH GROUND black pepper while you prepare the veggies.  Near East makes this stuff which is amazing if you can swing a sauce pan into your lineup but if not, you could probably sub in some pan-toasted garlic bread for a grain.   Veggies get cooked first, just a teaspoon or two of oil in the pan and soften these up. Once they are done, transfer to a holding plate and drop a sheet of aluminum foil over the top while the steaks cook.  Speaking of steaks, those are just as easy. Once the veggies are out, I drop in a little more oil and heat it up between 300 and 400 F (IR thermometer here). Then the steaks go for a minute, two at most, on each side depending on thickness and desired doneness. Rest these suckers on top of the veggies under the foil for another few minutes while you set the table and enjoy!"

budgetfood,2bbs6y,jon-one,9,Mon Jul 21 22:33:52 2014 UTC,I hunt. Keeps the freezer full for the cost of a bullet and a few extra bucks a month to keep the chest freezer humming.  Sometimes I buy chicken at the grocery store. I wait until it is on sale for under $2/lb.  Ditto with beef sales. I prefer to go in on a cow or half a cow with friends/family.  A friend of ours butchers a pig for us every year in exchange for using some of our garage space over the winter.  Our meat consumption stays high (we eat meat at least once daily) regardless of the grocery prices or economy overall.
budgetfood,2bbs6y,AtomicPenny,3,Mon Jul 21 23:53:16 2014 UTC,"Nope. If you're smart about it, you can have plenty of meat and still be cheap.   I hunt, so I get a good bit of meat in exchange for a good bit of time. I buy meat in bulk and freeze. Many meals will have meat as an accessory rather than the main course, making the overall meal cheaper as it's mostly starch/grains. If I'm making a stew or other one-pot-meals, I buy large cuts of cheap beef and prepare them myself."

budgetfood,2bbs6y,stinkytoes,2,Tue Jul 22 03:24:03 2014 UTC,"Not so much, you just need to know how best to use it. Two tips:  First, learn to cook pork shoulder. If you have a slow cooker, you can easily set it up before work and come home to fall-apart pulled pork that can be eaten on its own or added to a ton of dishes (and reheat well in a microwave to bring to work for lunch). You can even roast it for a nice center piece entree, or get a meat grinder (Norpro has a nice one for just $30) and use it to make sausage.   Second, learn how to cut up a chicken. Get good at it--in just a few minutes, you can turn two whole birds into four breasts and four legs, and with a little effort turn the two carcasses into stock. Again, toss one in a slow cooker overnight or all day long if you don't have the time, or use a pressure cooker if you can and draw out every last protein molecule from the leftovers. It'll be far tastier and healthier than what you buy in the store, and you can freeze it for months in ready-to-use portions."
budgetfood,2bbs6y,jackson6644,1 point,Tue Jul 22 17:05:31 2014 UTC,"We're definitely eating less meat and have made changes in what we are buying.  I used to cook mainly with flash-frozen, boneless-skinless chicken breasts and ground beef.  In the last 9 months I have only bought ground beef once. It was $1.50lb and I bought 10 pounds, or 20 meals, and froze them.  I've found chicken legs and leg quarters for $.69lb and I stock up hugely. I also bought a bunch of ""holiday"" meat to toss in the chest freezer.   My saving grace has been bacon. The cost per pound is PAINFUL, but I can get at least 6 meals out of a package. Flash-freeze it it two-slice stacks and throw them all in a ziplock in the freezer. As an added bonus, the stack defrost in less that 20 minutes.  Other than that: lentils, chick peas, and beans of all kinds. Even my carnivorous husband is dealing well with our new Panasian menu."

budgetfood,2bbs6y,autowikibot,9,Mon Jul 21 21:31:18 2014 UTC,"Vegetable:       In culinary terms, a vegetable is an edible plant or its part, intended for cooking or eating raw.  In biological terms, ""vegetable"" designates members of the plant kingdom [according to whom?].  The non-biological definition of a vegetable is largely based on culinary and cultural tradition. Apart from vegetables, other main types of plant food are fruits, grains and nuts. Vegetables are most often consumed as salads or cooked in savory or salty dishes, while culinary fruits are usually sweet and used for desserts, but it is not the universal rule.  Therefore, the division is somewhat arbitrary, based on cultural views. For example, some people consider mushrooms to be vegetables even though they are not biologically plants,   while others consider them a separate food category;  some cultures group potatoes with cereal products such as noodles or rice,  while most English speakers would consider them vegetables.  Some vegetables can be consumed raw, while some, such as cassava, must be cooked to destroy certain natural toxins or microbes in order to be edible. A number of processed food items available on the market contain vegetable ingredients and can be referred to as ""vegetable derived"" products. These products may or may not maintain the nutritional integrity of the vegetable used to produce them.    Image i - Vegetables in a market in the Philippines.

You can also make a nice raw veggie platter with peppers, celery, carrots, and hummus. Maybe add some crackers, cheese, and sliced deli meat for the non-vegetarian option.  Additionally, onion and bell pepper may be broader categories than some realize. Branch out to hot and sweet peppers and explore the different applications of sweet, yellow, green, and red onions, just to start. If you want more specifics, I'd be happy to keep going."

budgetfood,2baq8b,Puzzles21,4,Mon Jul 21 19:31:50 2014 UTC,"Cool! So, if you want to start experimenting with new veggies, I've found either pasta or rice is a great base. Both are fairly cheap and can give a nice variety day to day.  You can do all sorts of primavera. The basic strategy I use is to look at what I want to experiment with and then think about what shape would work best with that. Let's say I wanted to do zucchini and squash. You could do some nice thin half moon slices with bow ties (and probably thin slice red onion, red pepper, maybe sausage, garlic, etc.) or cut on a bias and combine with ziti, or cut into really long, thin strips and combine with angel hair. If I was going to use peas, I'd probably use medium to large shells and maybe add diced bacon and fried yellow onion, possibly ricotta. Then there is slightly less common (at least in the states) stuff like broccoli rabe. Essentially the process is this:   look at your ingredient think about a way you can cut it find a pasta shape that can either carry that food or has roughly the same shape as that food fry veggies in a large hot pan with butter or canola oil, season, and add anything you think might go well with that item toss cooked pasta and fried veggies until thoroughly combined   The rice route is to get your East Asian thing on. Keep some soy sauce and Sriracha handy. It doesn't hurt to have some curry powder or its component ingredients (turmeric, cumin, chili powder, etc.) lying around as well. The process is basically the same, but you don't have to worry about pasta shape. You can check out different types of cabbage, bok choy, and any ingredient you're comfortable using in a more European context should work equally well in this.   stir-fry all your ingredients in a large, very hot pan or wok (don't use butter; use canola, peanut, corn, or any other high-heat oil) cook your preferred rice (I'm a fan of basmati, it's a little more expensive, but still pretty cheap) douse veg with soy sauce (taste often to make sure you haven't done too much) and Sriracha or chili oil or whatever you like to make things hot include a lot of minced garlic and ginger in the stir-fry serve veg over rice   With both of these, there's a lot of room for exploration. Try different combinations, different meats, spices, and herbs. A fried or hard boiled egg can really change the tone of a dish. Bacon, strong cheeses, pickled vegetables and fish, fruit, vinegar, anything your heart desires. Be adventurous. These are just a base on which you can build a whole repertoire of dishes. Good luck!"

For greens: I just chop them up and saute on high heat with oil and garlic (add onion if you want).  Don't cook them too long -- they get grey and gross.    Variations: Instead of oil, render bacon fat and cook in that.  Add the crispy bacon at the end.  Additionally, or alternatively, add balsamic vinegar (or any other vinegar to the end product).    For Cabbage: It is surprisingly good cooked in basically the same way as the greens.  Cook on really high heat to get some browning.  Just salt and pepper.  Throw in a knob of butter after you throw in the cabbage and the heat decreases a little (this keeps it from burning).  Variations: Add caraway seeds, beer and chicken stock after the initial high heat sir fry.  Makes it a bit German.  Or, use bacon and add potatoes and you have Bubble and Squeak (British)."

budgetfood,2b8wsh,hulahulagirl,1 point,Mon Jul 21 01:10:11 2014 UTC,But at that price could reheat with some cream and thicken it up.
budgetfood,2b8wsh,CheezyArmpit,4,Thu Aug 7 08:36:29 2014 UTC,"I'm sure it would be fine, I often freeze soups, stews and curries."
budgetfood,2b8wsh,MarcMurray92,1 point,Mon Jul 21 14:38:56 2014 UTC,I haven't tried freezing it. I do know that this keeps in the fridge really well for about five days so it's good to cook on Sunday and eat for your lunch for the week.

budgetfood,2b8wsh,PureLand,1 point,Mon Jul 21 01:35:06 2014 UTC,Thank you for sharing this! I think I'll make this on Wednesday!
budgetfood,2b8wsh,leeresgebaeude,1 point,Mon Jul 21 01:57:05 2014 UTC,This looks really good.  I used to eat this a lot when I lived in California and for far less. But this is quite a pricy meal living in Alaska where vegetables can and often do cost more than meat.  I however will find a way.

During the last five minutes of the rice cooking, I fried two eggs and sauteed some spinach in butter. The runnier you leave the eggs, the better this meal is. In a bowl top the rice with the eggs, spinach, a little bit of shredded cheese and soy sauce."
budgetfood,2b9nyb,everyletterback,4,Mon Jul 21 04:27:47 2014 UTC,Egg yolk on rice is a beautiful thing.
budgetfood,2b98jy,intoon,4,Mon Jul 21 01:29:09 2014 UTC,"This week at Meijer, eye of round roast are $2.99lb. Cover it with a thin layer of kosher salt. Let sit at room temp for an hour. Sear all sides in in a cast iron skillet in olive oil. Bake in cast iron at 225* with a meat thermometer inside. When the internal temp reaches 112, shut off oven. Let the roast temp raise to 119 and take out of oven. Let the roast rest for 15 minutes before slicing. This is not a picture of ours, but it looked exactly the same! Went well with some home made horseradish sauce, red potatoes, and Caesar salad"

budgetfood,2b8sfb,philipsys71,5,Sun Jul 20 22:28:57 2014 UTC,"1/2 a gallon of whole milk (assuming I buy a full gallon, which is cheaper per oz) is about $1.75 where I am. 1 cup of plain yogurt (again, priced assuming I buy a larger carton) is about $1.00. Pretend I already happen to own cheese cloth. Ignore the cost of vinegar. 2 cups of ricotta runs about $3.00 at my local grocery store, less if I buy a larger carton of store-brand.   Homemade ricotta can be delicious, but there's nothing ""budget"" or ""live on less"" about it."
budgetfood,2b8sfb,scabagly,2,Mon Jul 21 02:21:09 2014 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing. It's delicious and fun to make, but I don't see it as cheaper."
budgetfood,2b8sfb,yesnis,2,Mon Jul 21 05:40:39 2014 UTC,Cheeses is expensive in Asia. Throw thrifty out of the window and enjoy fresh ricotta if you are in US or Europe.
budgetfood,2b7wlt,agaric,11,Sun Jul 20 16:41:04 2014 UTC,Bought this a couple months ago.. it already paid for itself one month later.  I love making soup in 6 minutes at pressure.
budgetfood,2b7wlt,_thx1138_,6,Sun Jul 20 17:45:16 2014 UTC,I've been thinking of trading in my rice cooker and slow cooker and get a combo one like this (that can also pressure cook).  Would be awesome.
budgetfood,2b7wlt,ZwiDomini,2,Sun Jul 20 19:11:56 2014 UTC,"Thats actually the reason I bought mine, I was cooking with my rice cooker, soups and stuff and it wasent cutting it, I asked for one of these are a b day gift, loved it ever since"

budgetfood,2b7wlt,dakkster,3,Mon Jul 21 03:31:03 2014 UTC,They cook 70% faster due to the increased pressure so they use less energy.
budgetfood,2b7wlt,stygmata,4,Mon Jul 21 04:00:12 2014 UTC,Time is money. Haha simple. You have more time to do other things... Maybe cleaning the house or just some other stuff that you wouldn't have the time to do if you had to spend an hour or so prepping and just cooking.
budgetfood,2b7wlt,dakkster,-5,Mon Jul 21 00:32:19 2014 UTC,"No, time isn't always money."

budgetfood,2b7wlt,InFaDeLiTy,3,Mon Jul 21 02:53:57 2014 UTC,Are there any safety risks with one of these?
budgetfood,2b7wlt,_thx1138_,4,Sun Jul 20 21:44:51 2014 UTC,"Not anymore, really, no, but I don't really ever find myself needing to use pressure to cook."
budgetfood,2b7wlt,runawaysaints,0,Sun Jul 20 21:49:28 2014 UTC,Any new multi cooking pressure cooker like this one has several safety features that would break the seal before any harm could possibly happen.
budgetfood,2b7wlt,raznog,3,Sun Jul 20 21:56:28 2014 UTC,This looks great. Most of the recipes seem to assume relatively large proportions though? Any tips on whether its also good for solitary eaters?
budgetfood,2b7wlt,AndyNemmity,1 point,Mon Jul 21 00:35:36 2014 UTC,"Im a single eater so ya, it works great for one person, I just adjust any big recipes, that or I throw the leftovers in the fridge and have them for lunch the next day."

budgetfood,2b7wlt,Brantleyx21,4,Mon Jul 21 04:25:43 2014 UTC,"There are two kinds of pressure cookers, electric (like the one above, just plug into an outlet) and stove top, a pot you put on the actual burner/stovetop.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nOIRoe6mU  it cooks food evenly in a pressurized environment. it reduces the cooking time into a fraction"
budgetfood,2b7wlt,Hughtub,2,Mon Jul 21 15:47:15 2014 UTC,Are pressure cookers good for veggies? My boyfriend is a vegetarian and the main application seems to be for meats.
budgetfood,2b7wlt,sanjessica,2,Mon Jul 21 00:28:44 2014 UTC,They are awesome for cooking dry beans. So much faster. But don't spend $140. Get a $30 stovetop one.
budgetfood,2b7wlt,xanthreborn,2,Mon Jul 21 01:10:14 2014 UTC,"I have it, love it. Making rice in it now (which took quite a while to figure out the right times, but once you have it, amazing)"

Food wise I make loads of lentil, rice, bean, pasta dishes, its great for soups, for awhile I would throw in some steel-cut oats, brown sugar and dried figs, woke up to the best breakfast ever.  I can buy the cheaper cuts of meat, lots of beans, rice, lentils and pasta and the end product turns out awesome.  This is not an ad L I just love the money this thing has saved me."
