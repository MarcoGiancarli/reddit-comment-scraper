baduk,3e35fc,kision314,2,Tue Jul 21 18:26:15 2015 UTC,I will keep that book in mind for when I get a little stronger :D
baduk,3e35fc,SickWilly,2,Tue Jul 21 19:08:16 2015 UTC,"I also have the Davies book, as well as books 1,2, and 4 in the same sequence: In the Beginning, Joseki, and Life and Death.  They seem to be pretty good for my level. Do you know of anything major that they overlook? Any texts which would be a good supplement?"
baduk,3e35fc,brain_brain,4,Tue Jul 21 19:29:52 2015 UTC,"The books lay a really great foundation. In my opinion, attack and defense is the best of them. The tesuji book is good but a little shallow. There's a LOT of tesuji and it takes a lot of time to be able to recognize them in problems, let alone games.  I think ""In The Beginning"" and ""Joseki"" are less important for DDKs. I haven't read through those ones, actually but the hardest part for DDKs to understand is the concept behind the joseki. They are patterns for a reason and each move is important, but I don't know of any books that do a good job of explaining why each move is necessary.  Besides that, I tend to focus on other things besides opening for DDKs, because losing because your group got killed is far more likely than losing from being behind a little (or a even a lot) in the opening.  I don't remember the Life and Death book, but I'm pretty sure I read it. I think it was decent. Life and Death is a tough subject because I think quantity is important. Seeing the same patterns many times makes it a lot easier to do Life and Death because you get to see the different patterns and how little things like an extra liberty affect the status of a group.  Anyway, Attack and Defense is by far my favorite book as a kyu and helped me tremendously. Tesuji was good too. And the rest in the series are good, but not as impactful as those two titles.  Hope that helps."
baduk,3e4w62,Mrbarnarne12,7,Tue Jul 21 23:51:50 2015 UTC,"Pro ranks or more like honorary titles.  9p's will, in general, be stronger than 1p's, but the strength difference is very small (maybe 1 stone difference)"
baduk,3e4w62,itstoearly,3,Wed Jul 22 00:00:37 2015 UTC,"Specifically, since pro ranks are mostly awarded for long term cumulative success relatively new pros can be stronger than their rank implies since it's impossible for them to advance very quickly (without taking one of a small handful of specific titles).  A 9p is guaranteed to be pretty strong since the weaker pros will never advance that far, but longevity again plays a role; it's possible to get to 9p by being a strong player for a long time without ever being one of the very very best."
baduk,3e4w62,NoLemurs,2,Wed Jul 22 02:39:25 2015 UTC,Also I think professionals aren't demoted. You can stay on 9p even when your increasing age leads to a drop in performance.
baduk,3e4w62,Thuruk,6,Wed Jul 22 09:27:50 2015 UTC,"In general there isn't more than a one-stone gap between 1p and 9p these days. A hundred years ago, 9p - 1p might have been 3 stones difference."
baduk,3e4w62,Shadonra,0,Wed Jul 22 00:15:24 2015 UTC,"Were there any handicap stones in those matches, even just a few?  Pro ranks aren't separated by a full stone of strength; they are estimated to be about 1/3 of a stone difference on average.  So a 1p playing a 9p at 3 stones would be close to right.  Even at no stones, the gap probably isn't as wide as you'd expect."
baduk,3e4w62,hikaruzero,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:59:50 2015 UTC,Inseis can play top pros at like half a stone. A lot of the new 1p are stronger than the older 9p.  I don't think what you are saying is right. I might be wrong however.
baduk,3e4w62,forgotmypwnofap,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:34:46 2015 UTC,One other factor is that pros dont rank down when their performance goes down. If awarded the pro dan ranks stand. Also while amateur ranks are based on all games in Japan they have (or did they change it now?) a special tournament that determines the dan ranks. IF you dont perform well in that competition but you play well in the others your rank does not reflect your strength.
baduk,3e4w62,elathalion,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:23:30 2015 UTC,"In the old days, there was a larger gap between new pros and top pros. Over the years, Go has spread, study has become more refined and serious, and competition has increased. There's less deviation in strength among pros now.  Today, a new pro in Korea or China is not very different from a top pro. Certainly not by 3 stones or even 2. Often it's the reverse; the new generation of 1-dan pros is stronger than a lot of the old, established 9-dan pros who are past their prime.  Let me put it to you this way: if God himself became pro, he'd still start at 1p and wouldn't make it to 9p for a few years at least. In 40 years, Lee Sedol will be an old man and probably not be able to compete at the same level, but he'll still be 9p.  A lot of the insei (students) who fail the pro exams are basically pro-level as well, and sometimes beat pros in open tournaments. Last year, Mark Lee, an amateur from Korea, won the US Open, which included some Chinese pros, with a perfect 9-0 record. He previously studied to be pro in Korea, but never made it.  To become pro today, you need to already be among the best in the world. (At least in China and Korea. The standards in the US, Europe, and even Japan are a bit lower.)"
baduk,3e4w62,Mikuro,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:00:58 2015 UTC,Korea also introduced a system where you can become a pro by qualifying for and participating in professional tournaments.

baduk,3e12bp,WaywardCatholic,6,Tue Jul 21 03:27:32 2015 UTC,"What helped me around then was taking time to read, using the reading skills from easy go problem practice. Just get used to thinking about what will happen a couple moves ahead instead of playing stuff that looks good. It also helped me to watch stronger players until I had a better sense of good shape. I liked Nick Sibicky's lectures because he has a class of DDKs who asked all the DDK questions I was wondering about.  There are concepts that are important for SDKs, I picked up on those from things like Nick Sibicky's videos. One big one is that you should attack to gain profit, rather than necessarily trying to kill. Another is not creating a bunch of weak groups that let your opponent do that to you. For conceptual stuff, what I wish I had had at that level was Clossius' new daily game review series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5mVjO5OFYSwjlZHXyzJII3zj5jVC65vp. It's full of examples of how people should have applied basic direction of play but instead played slow, pointless moves. With these games he shows repeated examples of what DDKS and SDKs do wrong and what would have been better. It's a great way to learn by example I think."

baduk,3e12bp,beer_and_pizza,3,Tue Jul 21 04:14:32 2015 UTC,"I remember the wall to SDK being rather tough, but I think the reason for that is that I didnt realise how quickly you raise through DDK ranks. (At DDK you can study for a day or two and see huge improvements, its one of the fun things of being a beginner at go! :D) SDK ranks take a lot longer to ascend through so it'll seem like youre at a wall sometimes when really it's just that its a little harder to rank up.  If you are on a losing streak or get quickly demoted after being promoted then I feel your pain. All I can say is that you just need to keep studying and keep playing and rough on through it. There's no other way than with sweat and blood.  That being said I kept raising to 10k and being demoted to 11k. I remember reading ""Lessons In The Fundamentals Of Go"" and that pretty much helped me break through my funk so give that book a try if you haven't :) It's popular amongst many players. Also, I found that doing lots of tsumego at specifically 14k promoted me all the way to 12k instantly so make sure you do that if you haven't yet."
baduk,3e12bp,BenzineBro,2,Tue Jul 21 07:50:10 2015 UTC,"What helped me more than anything else at your level was to play as many games with ample thinking time as possible, and use every chance to get them reviewed by a stronger player."
baduk,3e12bp,Probably_a_redditor,2,Tue Jul 21 09:34:00 2015 UTC,Reread lessons in the fundamentals and do tsumego until your eyes bleed lol I remember my plateau at around that point. It's then that you have to start really forcing growth. It only gets harder from there
baduk,3e12bp,leonprimrose,2,Tue Jul 21 12:47:58 2015 UTC,"If you really want to improve, you have to do more than just play, and since everyone has a different problem, sadly I can't just recommend a book and send you on your way. A trick I like to use even to this day is to review all my games, even in my head is fine, but instead of simply reviewing it and seeing where I went wrong, I keep a journal/notebook that I write in every day with all the things that I should keep in mind and improve on. It is really a big help because it is a nice way of organizing my thoughts because even if I recognize that, for example, I have to work on my shape, I may forget this whilst I play, so reading my notebook beforehand is a big help. Since I have it in a journal-type format, it also encourages me to play everyday so I have an entry for every day :D Good Luck"
baduk,3e12bp,Blade106,2,Wed Jul 22 14:23:59 2015 UTC,Read Attack and defense from Kiseido. Usually that book pushes you into SDK after the first 3 chapters.

baduk,3e12bp,SickWilly,5,Tue Jul 21 12:46:50 2015 UTC,"That is the most influential book of my kyu career. Over a couple of months it got me from 9-11 kyu to 5kyu really quickly. I read it initially as a DDK and then 1-2 more times as a SDK, and recently just finished it again as a Dan. There is great stuff for lots of levels.  The core concepts are great and were a great introduction to attacking concepts as a DDK. I gained a lot from the specifics and more nuances of attacks. And as a dan it was a good refresher, although it was pretty easy for me. But it was a good reminder of fundamentals.  So I say yeah, it's definitely applicable to DDKs, but to get everything out of the book being 5kyu would be helpful."
baduk,3e12bp,leonprimrose,2,Tue Jul 21 15:26:34 2015 UTC,I can see that :) I've read it once myself. Going back through Tesuji now. I'll probably revisit it again soon

baduk,3e12bp,leonprimrose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:41 2015 UTC,I suppose I can see that. I didn't read it until I was already SDK level myself. What pushed it for me was a reread of lessons in the fundamentals and a couple teaching games I think

Can you go over hundreds of very easy tsumego until you can no longer see why you'd give the wrong answer because it's just so obvious? Can you play many slow games and review each one (by yourself or with help)?  The more you can put in, the more results you'll have, but don't push too hard or you'll be too tired or bored to maintain the effort."

baduk,3dx221,eksert,6,Mon Jul 20 06:25:31 2015 UTC,"when you're fighting in your opponent's area of influence, you can't afford to play lax moves that don't threaten anything, or you risk either dying outright or being chased for a LONG time, the endresult being that you'll live with 2 points while your opponent got the rest of the board and you resign in shame.  That's why you need to look for forcing moves wherever you can get them. Attatching on the second line like that is a probe and asking the opponent ""which forcing moves will you give me?"" if your opponent captures the stone you generally get the most forcing moves, which is why that doesn't happen too often in high level games.  A similar tactic is crosscutting on the second line to get the most forcing moves as possible.  I'd post a few diagrams to illustrate, but appearently you can't do that on reddit?"

baduk,3dmxwo,batholomew,2,Fri Jul 17 16:02:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know why OGS players like kicking so much. I think move 19 forces white to make an ideal extension and your corner still has aji on the 3-3 point.  At move 29 I think M3 would be sente, forcing him to run away, then you can still choose to attack somewhere else. Instead white gets a base with move 36."
baduk,3dmxwo,Thuruk,2,Fri Jul 17 16:21:00 2015 UTC,noted. thanks for your time and input. Instead of kicking I assume I should have played O16 (the one point extension) right away.
baduk,3dmxwo,sparks314,2,Fri Jul 17 17:33:30 2015 UTC,"From one of dwyrin's lectures (if I remember correctly), kicking is good when they only have or can make a two space extension, because it makes them over concentrated. By kicking when they have a three space extension (or can make a three space extension), you're essentially given your opponent good shape. I'm usually happy to take a kick if it means I get a 3 space extension."
baduk,3dmxwo,BenzineBro,2,Fri Jul 17 22:13:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know why OGS players like kicking so much.   Not just OGS players, DDKs in general. It's beyond me."
baduk,3dmxwo,Bigfatsnoozy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:17:38 2015 UTC,"I believe it's used so frequently because the aji at the 3-3 point is often ignored by other DDKs. I never conciously realized there was a weak spot there until pointed out. So I and others might have adopted a practice which only works because our opponents do not punish by using its inherent flaws.  Even in this game my opponent, knowing the weak spot, misplays and dies in the corner, right?"
baduk,3dk2gp,nocashvaluedrumz,3,Thu Jul 16 22:17:41 2015 UTC,"Hope this helps, I haven't posted any reviews here before, so if I make any mistakes forgive me please. These are some things I saw in your game  Move 15: Try to be a little more conservative regarding the corner. You made a good play with the pincer, but you might think about playing on the 3-3 to respond to the approach. If white tries to jump out to the center, you can cut him off.  Move 63: Use something like b2 to block. Your move way an overplay that led to the corner dying  116: Note how the placement of your stones was an elephant jump that white decided to cut  131: Slow play and strengthens white in the corner. I would play at F14 to cap white and strengthen your moyo  154: This hane is huge. The person who makes it first gets to push the other back from their wall. You should not have played on the first line to seal the corner, instead you should limit white's group on the left with your own hane, or extend out to prevent white from reducing your moyo.  161: Connect at F8 instead of taking  225: Too greedy, just extend to L18 instead"
baduk,3dk2gp,WaywardCatholic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:15:59 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot! Really appreciate you taking the time to go through it :)
baduk,3dk2gp,Yxven,2,Fri Jul 17 00:49:36 2015 UTC,"I am assuming you are black. I'm not gonna nitpick every move. I'm just gonna mention some important ones.  5, r14 is the normal approach on a 4 4 point. This is what makes move 7 look so weird.  21, This move has the wrong idea. Cutting off white would be very large, but this move doesn't do that. It only threatens to cut off white. White doesn't want to be cut off, so he should just jump out one space. Thus, if white responds optimally, black's move helps white build territory. What black should be doing is approaching the upper left corner with C14.  27, This move is on the wrong side. White gave you a weak group to attack next to your wall. You should shove white up against your wall while building territory on the other side. Something like g3 deprives white of a base while building you solid territory.  43, I kind of like this move, but it's not a good time for it. It's a leaning attack that threatens white's weak group, but white's group isn't very threatened as long as it can make a base. We're also giving white a lot of solid 3rd line territory with this move.  You'd be better off with something like g3.  53, Leaving weaknesses in your wall is not typically a good idea.  At least you're building something in the center with this.  57, This move is pretty bad. It really hurts your stone in the corner. Cutting directly with d5 is better.  63, This move can just be cut and killed, so it's not very good. D2 would be a more normal response.  67, You should do go problems until it becomes obvious that this move doesn't work. Reading mistakes happen, but trying to recover like this makes games unwinnable.  81, If this move was at a2, you could have a ko for life.  83, if this move was b5, you could have a ko for life. As is, you're dead in gote (meaning your opponent doesn't have to respond).  85, Your giving your opponent another stone in gote here. I recommend goproblems.com  89, This is a nice move.  90, This move is bad. You need to pull back with n14 or you face double atari shenanigans.  93, This move gives you bad shape. Pulling back with o13 is probably best here.  95, This move is the wrong direction. You're pushing him into your moyo. It'd be better to play o13. He'll kill your two stones with m15, and then you can turn with n13.  101, You need to play s12 if you want to keep your wall intact.   107, n12, m12, n14, m13, o11, o10, n10, m11, p10, o9, r11, q10, r10, q9, s12 is not good for you.  121, These double ataris are getting pretty painful. This move should be at n8.  149, you screwed yourself here by reducing your liberties. If you played an outside liberty like g19, you win this.  153, This is like slamming the barn door after all the horses have escaped. You should play a move like e12.  159, you really need to defend the double atari with g11.  We're gonna stop here. Your biggest weakness right now is reading. If you'd like to improve quickly, do around 20 go problems per day."

baduk,3dk2gp,Yxven,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:48:16 2015 UTC,"You should definitely do the Graded Go Problems for beginners series, it is probably your best resource. But it is important that you don't look at the answers until you have read out every reasonable continuation and really feel like you understand the problem.  The Tsumego Pro app is nice, but you have to resist clicking around and finding the answer. You should not lay a stone until you are certain of the correct moves. Overall, I would say this resource is a nice supplement for when you don't have your books like ""Graded Go Problems"" or ""Get Strong at Tesuji"" around to read, but you shouldn't rely on it, because the tsumego in these apps don't really systematically address all the aspects of your playing the way a good problem book does.  I wouldn't mess with goproblems.com, its probably the least efficient way to study tsumego."

If you think you can take it as territory, you can play to get that before you pass.  Any dead groups are captured and scored... if both players disagree on what's dead, you're not done playing.

baduk,3djicq,novagenesis,2,Thu Jul 16 23:34:40 2015 UTC,"First the ""dead"" stones, that is, stones that can be captured no matter how their owner plays, are removed. If there is a dispute over whether a group is dead, the way it's resolved varies based on the ruleset used, but it usually involves some form of playing it out.  After that, if a connected region touches only one color of stones, it is territory. If it touches stones of both colors, it is considered ""neutral"" and neither player gains any points from it."
baduk,3djicq,princekamoro,2,Fri Jul 17 04:56:39 2015 UTC,"If you're talking about irl go, just take off the dead stones on the board and put them into your respective capture bowls, then add back the dead stones from your bowl into your opponent's territory (So for every stone you captured from your opponent, they lose a point), then you count how many points they have, and they count how many points you have. You can do this by rearranging the territories in the squares for easy counting (slightly advanced, you have to make sure that you're not actually changing the score by shifting the territory around) or you can just manually count each point. The person with the highest score wins."

No, there's no way to keep it from happening, either in automatch or otherwise.  Some players are just rude.  Some people are rude in real life too.

baduk,3dh7xj,anadosami,8,Thu Jul 16 06:35:02 2015 UTC,Clamp at B18 maybe? I can't immediately find a way for white to kill the group (or even reduce it very much).
baduk,3dh7xj,4698468973,6,Thu Jul 16 08:39:25 2015 UTC,clamp looks safest
baduk,3dh7xj,CarlR,2,Thu Jul 16 11:32:08 2015 UTC,"What about W at B19? I think the clamp is safe, but white can gain 6 points in sente (compared to the hane):  http://eidogo.com/#2GF2jhYBX"
baduk,3dh7xj,zehipp0,2,Thu Jul 16 20:40:20 2015 UTC,"B19 was the one response by white that required some reading for me. If black chooses to play C17 in response, and six points is too much to give up, then I think black should fight the ko. The ko looks locally favorable to black to me. If black chooses to play D19 in response, I think white has no choice but to play B17, and then I think black should play the extension-to-the-edge move at A18 in response, which completely ruins the ponnuki that white needs to make the semeai hard for black.  If white tries to connect out via A16 and A15 and short black's liberties, black has to be mindful of a snapback but then gets to capture C18 for life. If white responds at A17 for the immediate atari, black responds naturally at C17 and all sequences I run through lead to black capturing C18 and living.  I can't find it on sensei's site or elsewhere at the moment, but extension-to-the-edge is a useful tesuji in some cases that I don't totally understand yet. This might be one of them, or maybe not.  edit: if there's a best play sequence starting with (black) D19-B17-A18 that leads to death, ko, or seki, I can't find it! Please show me."
baduk,3dh7xj,4698468973,2,Thu Jul 16 21:12:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, here's the best result for white I could come up with (white comes in through the left side), which is about 6 points gote.  http://eidogo.com/#hnTO27Ms"
baduk,3dh7xj,zehipp0,2,Fri Jul 17 08:01:19 2015 UTC,"Black A15 after white A14 leads to ko, which might give a better result for black, but I'm probably missing something. Otherwise, that looks like a pretty fair sequence."
baduk,3dh7xj,4698468973,2,Fri Jul 17 08:12:05 2015 UTC,"Yep, I read out a ko too, black takes first, but it's really big for white. The kind of ko depends on whether D15 is sente, and if it is, white has to play there first, which gives a two-step ko."
baduk,3dh7xj,zehipp0,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:16:21 2015 UTC,Still seems dangerous for black if white connects at C17 with move 8 instead of playing the Atari.  Edit: Ok maybe not. This corner is pretty complicated.
baduk,3dh7xj,monkeymule,4,Fri Jul 17 19:38:27 2015 UTC,"After C18 - D19, what about B19? Some variations: http://eidogo.com/#uBiPE2R9:0,0. White could also respond at B18, but I think black can make an eye or capture first"
baduk,3dh7xj,zehipp0,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:26:51 2015 UTC,"Very interesting, I wouldn't have considered that. Once you realise C19 doesn't work for white, it seems reasonable."
baduk,3dh7xj,monkeymule,4,Thu Jul 16 12:03:34 2015 UTC,"Playing move 7 at A16 seems wrong to me.  That move doesn't really do anything, it doesn't help your shape, it doesn't take a liberty.  Playing B16 instead threatens to make an eye and also prepares for the hane at A17.  For example, if you play B16 and then white responds at A16, if you make the eye and then white fixes on the outside, the best white can do in the corner afterwards seems to be an unfavorable ko, so maybe you could play elsewhere.  If you play B16 and white interrupts the eye with D15, you can hane at A17 an now it's difficult for white to find time to play C19 because they need to watch out for self Atari."
baduk,3dh7xj,zehipp0,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:51:37 2015 UTC,"After Black A17, White plays A18, I read out a ko (whether black connects or plays around C19, white's next move should be on the left, either take the stone, or A14)"
baduk,3dh7xj,monkeymule,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:07:57 2015 UTC,Yeah I suppose there is a ko there.  My objection was more that A16 didn't really seem like the honte so in a situation like this it's probably a mistake unless there is a specific reason to play it.  If you just need to live I think Black can still get a seki with A18 after B16.  Giving it a second look I think the clamp at B18 instead of descending is probably the best answer.
baduk,3dh7xj,Ryuukun,2,Fri Jul 17 19:33:42 2015 UTC,"Clamp looks best here. But yes, this corner is 100% alive."

baduk,3dd8o9,not-dan,7,Thu Jul 16 00:54:43 2015 UTC,"Hi OP,  I think this is an interesting idea! I am happy someone is pursuing it. But I am a money nerd and do have a few questions for the campaign.   You are looking for up to 8,000 AUD (~6,000 USD) for this project with flexible funding, meaning you will keep all funds even is the max is not raised. Is this money simply to cover your labor and costs? If so, will you be able to complete the project even if you don't raise the full amount?  Will you be a permanent host of the server, once it launches? What if any long-term maintenance costs will there be (time, labor, money?).  I like the spirit of your idea a lot but I would be really interested in seeing what kind of input people involved in OGS or the other existing clients have."
baduk,3dd8o9,dmwit,5,Wed Jul 15 14:26:13 2015 UTC,"More to the point: 8000 AUD is the wrong order of magnitude for what a server with the proposed feature list costs. Get serious, please."
baduk,3dd8o9,dmwit,4,Wed Jul 15 17:26:32 2015 UTC,"Just to give some perspective: here in the US, 6000 USD is two weeks of entry-level programmer time. Even at a tenth that cost (roughly minimum wage) you're only getting five months. Kaya.gs took more than a year and a half to go from alpha (i.e. an already working server) to beta, and they had several developers."

baduk,3dd8o9,Blandis,7,Thu Jul 16 00:54:53 2015 UTC,"Cool project. These are some of the thoughts I have:  I think it is a shame that there is no open, good standard Go protocol. I know there is the one IGS uses, which seems to have been quite widespread in the past, but not so much anymore. It is also very evident that it isn't originally intended to be parsed by a machine, as even in the supposedly ""machine readable mode"" it is horrible to parse.  That being said, this is quite an undertaking. Not only the technical parts, but also getting people to use it. A go server is no fun with no players.  Are you going to design the protocol so that it is not only possible to implement new clients, but also different server implementations? Being able to connect servers in networks would be quite cool too. Like in IRC. That way the burden of hosting could be distributed and wouldn't rely on one person.  OGS has an ""API"", and IIRC these days the have opened up the real time part which makes it full featured enough for people to write their own client, so there already is a server for which people can write their own clients. If the server is going to be controlled exclusively by you anyways, maybe the fact that the OGS server code is closed source doesn't matter that much? By letting servers connect in a network, you could reap the full benefit of having a more open server side."

baduk,3d7vdy,revolvingdoor12,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:41:29 2015 UTC,Regarding your aji comment at move 121. I think you can get away with the cut at H13. I've played around a bit with some variations - some work some don't. http://eidogo.com/#AAJv0b6m  Disclaimer: I'm a bit below your skill level so some of the readings may be a bit naïve... I still think the cut could work though.
baduk,3d7elx,_pharaoh,3,Tue Jul 14 02:35:34 2015 UTC,"At 20 kyu you really don't need a review, you just need to play.  You saw things yourself, the snapback you made with 67.  If you can see things like that in self review you are getting better.  ""Oh yeah, I should have just taken the stone there.""  Find yourself in that situation again and avoid that mistake next time.  I can do a more in depth review though.  Move 5.  It may be a little hard to see, but it is better for black to play G11 over G3.  Your stones are at C10 and D4.  Jumping out works better with the C10 stone.  This is a minor thing at your level of play, but still something to think about.  As you get stronger, it becomes much more important.  Move 7.  It's a bit better to move at E9 over D8.  It creates influence that pushes towards your bottom group while putting more pressure on whites E11 stone.  If white protects that stone by jumping back, you can become more secure on the left with C5, 6, or 7 afterwards, though C5 is probably the best choice of those.  If white says ""NO"" and invades, you can lean more heavily onto the E11 stone, building more influence, forcing him to respond, and forcing him to live small while you get bigger points.  Again, this is a smaller detail at your level of play, but becomes more important as you get stronger.  Move 13.  Just invade the 3.3 point at L3.  J3 points at the weakness there and tells white ""hey, fix that or bad things will happen,"" and gets you about 2 points in the end.  L3 says ""These points are mine, you left a weakness and now bad things are happening to you,"" and gets you about 30 points - about 10 points in the corner and removing about 20 points from white.  This is a moderate thing for your skill level, easily fixable.  Study some simple invasions, 3.3 invasion of a 4.4 is about as simple as they get.  It becomes major after you fix the next point I'll talk about.  Know when your groups are dead.  Don't play dead stones.  The exchange for moves 43 and 44 killed that J9 group.  It's dead with very little aji.  Now go to move 63.  You are playing into that group with no way of connecting to another group or making two eyes.  You are just playing a dead stone.  You continue by connecting K10 after the dead stone gets in atari.  It doesn't matter that it's in atari or not, it's already dead.  Don't waste that move doing nothing.  Sorry if the review is a little harsh, but it's honestly the quickest way to fix some mistakes.  If you want to fix most of your issues, it's just studying tsumego and joseki."
baduk,3d7elx,Norwazy,3,Tue Jul 14 03:19:28 2015 UTC,"it's just studying tsumego and joseki.   I think your post is entirely awesome and covers everything I felt like saying. Studying tsumego is amazingly helpful but joseki is not really appropriate for a 20k.  I would say don't worry about joseki at all until about 12k, except for the standard 4-4 variations and the 3-3 invasion on 19x19. Those are useful to learn at about 16k.  Clarification: It makes little sense to memorize joseki and it takes at least a 14kyu with decent 19x19 experience to understand the reasoning behind some of the simplest joseki patterns. Once you can answer every ""why not this move instead?"" question, you fully understand the joseki. You don't have to fully understand them to play them properly, but you need to at least understand every move in a broad sense in order to play them properly and respond when your opponent goes off-script."
baduk,3d7elx,eikons,2,Tue Jul 14 08:00:18 2015 UTC,It isn't harsh. Thanks for the advice. The 3.3 invasion sounds better but not entirely sure how I would get away with it? Probably just need to study some Joseki haha. Inexperienced.
baduk,3d7t0b,boxedfood,2,Tue Jul 14 04:36:02 2015 UTC,"I would say that a review is a bit hard because you're rather new to baduk (in-game dialogue says 2 month?) and white (2 dan) is quite a lot more experienced and skilled than you are.  I think he was going a bit easy but he still ended up killing most of your groups.    Read up on the different fuseki (opening) and then pick one to play for a bunch of games for a while.  The san-rei-sei fuseki that you played is a rather special fuseki where you risk everything to set up a big frame work, invite an invasion and then fight to the death.  (You weren't doing that at all.)    Have a look at some popular fuseki here:  http://senseis.xmp.net/?search=fuseki&searchtype=title.    I recommend taking a look at Chinese or Orthodox which may be what you were trying to accomplish.  Some people will say don't worry about fuseki/joseki starting out, but imho why start a game in a bad way when you could start it in a decent way?  Don't worry about in-depth stuff, play a bunch of games, read some more, rinse & repeat.  Btw, here's a fun test to see if you are the type of person who might like to play sen-ren-sei.  http://sanrensei.info  Here's my result (and I deliberately picked what I thought would be sen-ren-sei solutions LOL):  ""You know a lot about using influence, but you don't like to play all-or-nothing games or games where you must kill your opponent's group inside of your moyo. We might recommend that you use other influence-oriented fusekis, such as the Chinese family of fusekis (Low, High, Mini), takamoku-based openings, or tengen. All of these openings are more flexible than san-ren-sei and it's usually possible to switch from influence to territory if the position requires it."""

By playing D11, it weakens her opponent's group, and if her opponent jumps out to strengthen the group, she can naturally fix her weaknesses in her own weak group as the game progresses."
baduk,3d5eyg,brkirby,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:32:07 2015 UTC,It's interesting because what happens in the video is that the opponent leans on D11 to get strength and attack the upper group. I guess she just realised that even with the splitting attack her group wouldn't die?
baduk,3d5eyg,WieWasWo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:53:31 2015 UTC,"Also, her group isn't weak in the sense of ""threaten to get killed""; the black stones aren't having a base yet, but plenty of room to develop -- they are flexible.

baduk,3d5eyg,ralgrado,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:13:39 2015 UTC,H4 seems to want to develope the top side since hajin already has a stone on q4. her initial stone will become a small but stable group while white gets the corner and some moves on the top.  Black didn't play the joseki though since he varied with his hane at D8. After D11 white has to take care of his own stones after which black can attack whites corner to settle his d11 stone.  If black plays elsewhere a white move like d12 seems to make it too easy for white.

baduk,3d3toj,DBEdin,3,Mon Jul 13 08:22:48 2015 UTC,"I've heard a corner of more than 15 points labelled a ""big corner"" (by Nick Sibicky IIRC, that may be wrong though).  Nonetheless, on a 19x19 board we have 361 intersections. We could therefore say that a ""big corner"" takes up around 5-7% of the board (remembering the stones have to take up an intersection too). Two big corners would thus take up around 10%. Two normal corners might be about 7%.  There's an old proverb that says if you lose all 4 corners (~14-20% of the board by our metric), you should resign. I emphasis old because for two reasons: (1) it is, and (2) it's very possible to win with 0 corners - even/especially professionally (for an example have a look at Dwyrin's lecture on the games of 'legend88'). As a result I don't set much store by it, though I have noticed it is significantly more difficult to win with 0 corners than it is with just 1.  That being said, while the centre is without doubt the largest area of the board, it is also much harder to defend than corner and side territory and it's much easier to invade and reduce loose central frameworks.  To answer your second question, I believe Kageyama's sentiment that you must always balance territory and influence is the lesson we have to remember. Statistically I would wager that the variance in results would make any averages fairly meaningless, and the moves you would play to specifically meet corner territory target would no doubt give your opponent time to play bigger points elsewhere.  Below SDK level I think the results would vary more significantly than SDK and dan/pro-dan. As for changing over time: this is just speculation but I imagine there would be significantly higher averages of corner points prior to the Shin Fuseki period (around 1933). This is because ""older style"" Go was much more territorial and put less emphasis on the centre of the board.  My general mind set would be something like: make sure you have at least 1 corner, but be wary of trying to take all 4."

Unfinished games almost always are due to one side not having any chance of winning, generally from getting a group killed (and would disproportionately feature fighting).   Unless we could think of a way to account for how these cases play out, the analysis on finished games wouldn't mean too much. Let's say it shows that black taking more corner territory leads to higher win rates. What if black plays the same style and prioritizes corner territory, but when white creates fights and often leads to resignation (by either side), White's winrate is higher?"

baduk,3d1xcx,herminator,2,Mon Jul 13 09:37:39 2015 UTC,"Ok, regardless of anything else: R14 is a terrible move. If your only takeaway from this thread is to never play a move like R14, you'll gain a stone in strength. You gained almost nothing from that, but you just solved all of you opponents weaknesses by forcing him to connect his stones.  As to the question, I would probably just push through at Q14. The wall you build is worth so much more than the measly 15 points your opponent gets in the corner.  The alternative is to fight in the corner. /u/dailyprogo has posted a fine analysis of some of the variations there."

Definitely seems that R15 was a mistake :)  I suppose the simplest solution is in fact to push through and form an outer wall. I was a bit hesitant to do so because in the game my opponent had a stone in the bottom right, plus the consideration of taking gote etc. Maybe I just need to have more confidence in taking influence.

baduk,3cz1la,Ocdar,3,Sun Jul 12 02:02:56 2015 UTC,"if you play move 3 at C14, white can't defend both the double atari and the corner group"
baduk,3cz1la,attribute,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:08:58 2015 UTC,"Couldnt White just move at A-13?  Edit : Nevermind, I think I have it. Thanks!  Edit 2 : Actually, still having problems. sure you lose a stone with the double atari, but it seems white can still live in the corner."
baduk,3cz1la,gogameguru,2,Sun Jul 12 02:21:17 2015 UTC,"This is really a tesuji problem, because white's group isn't surrounded anyway. C14 makes miai of A16 and B13. If white chooses to live in the corner, the double atari is very satisfying for black, and black keeps sente."
baduk,3cz1la,gogameguru,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:16:17 2015 UTC,"Even so, I'm still having problems understanding whites original move at C-15, as well as a situation where white wouldn't chose to live in the corner. The double atari might be nice, but it doesn't really influence too much after everything has resolved."
baduk,3cz1la,hikaruzero,3,Sun Jul 12 03:25:59 2015 UTC,"It looks like the only point of this problem is to teach you the tesuji at B15. After that, white's best options are to eat B15 or tenuki (depending on the value of the left side). Eating one stone is a more efficient way to live than making two eyes in the corner. If this was given to you as a life and death problem it was miscategorized, so I can understand why you might have felt confused."
baduk,3cz1la,wandamoo,2,Sun Jul 12 09:39:49 2015 UTC,"The app isn't just life and death, this was just the first instance in which the computer's move (B-16) seemed inferior to another move it could have done (C-16).  But I think you're right, that the point of the problem is to teach B-15, so the computer made an inferior move to easily show what the overall effect of B-15 could be.  It would be interesting if the problem came up again later, but with the positions reversed, to teach you how to live in the corner"
baduk,3cz1la,Thuruk,2,Sun Jul 12 12:12:14 2015 UTC,"I'm still having problems understanding whites original move at C-15   Neither C15 nor B16 can really be said to work for white (since white fails to stay connected either way); C15 is just one way white can attempt to resist.   as well as a situation where white wouldn't chose to live in the corner   White may find the outside influence and sente to be more valuable than the corner.  If white lives in the corner he gets a few points, but sente alone might be worth more than the corner, and even if it's not building additional outside influence may be more valuable depending on what the rest of the board looks like.  In some cases white might prefer the corner, in others white might prefer the outside; either way, white is losing one or the other, which is a victory for black as far as the problem is concerned.   The double atari might be nice, but it doesn't really influence too much after everything has resolved.   It does affect a lot on the outside, actually.  White's two stones at D12 and C11 are badly blighted (especially D12).  That is to say, they are smashed up against a solid black position with many liberties, and are therefore hard to use and no longer valuable.  If white has influence, say, along the bottom side of the board which faces those stones, white might have been able to build a framework if he didn't allow the double atari.  The framework would likely be more valuable than white's corner position, and having sente to build that framework would also work in white's favor.  So allowing black to double-atari would ruin any chance white has of developing a good position on the side.  Edit:  Compare this position to this one -- which would you rather have?  The one with the corner or the one with the gigantic framework?  :)  Hope that helps."
baduk,3cz1la,hikaruzero,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:57:55 2015 UTC,Do you always consider the whole board in every tsumego?  I believe most tsumegos don't want that.  They are about one thing: to kill or to live.  In this case there should be an explanation about considering the whole board.  If there is not then I think OP is right.  Our goal was to kill white but white found a way to live.

It's hit or miss. I've sent games to get reviewed to Go Teaching Ladder and have yet to hear back and it's been at least a few months. http://www.go-academy.org/ has worked for me and someone usually gets back to you with a review in a week or 2. The quality of reviews has been pretty good. I play on OGS and have a friend who I've been learning with for many months now and he is about 5 stones stronger than me, so I've been lucky to get his help. We push and motivate each other to get better. If you play on OGS you can post on their forum and get a review, or request a teacher. That server is much more reliable than Reddit."

To prove it theres this review request where 2 roughly 5k players have given comments and one dan level player.  Not to mention this request where someone did a 15 minute review by video and this request where a 5k went through the game as well.  Most of the time I cant do reviews because some dan player does a review and covers all the important points that I want to make.  Also, considering that all it takes is to upload and post the link of the sgf file there's no opportunity cost for doing it so I dont see why you are discouraging it."

I guess I just didn't get lucky. I'm discouraging it because it isn't as reliable as other resources. I got my hopes up before trying to use reddit, but only ended up being discouraged myself.

baduk,3cyo4v,BenzineBro,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:25:32 2015 UTC,Whenever I uploaded games I'd get pretty good reviews from multiple people.   It sounds like you just got unlucky or you uploaded games that you won or didn't comment on or something? Is that the case?
baduk,3cyo4v,BulletD0dger,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:09:43 2015 UTC,"Not the case. In the comments on one game I posted for review, I wrote something like ""I know I missed an easy tsumego situation where I could have killed black"" and ""black had 2 weak groups and I had no idea how to attack them for profit"" and I got 2 responses. The first solely critiqued my opening and said nothing else. The second posted an eidogo link and said can you solve this tsumego (referring to my situation). I waited a week, nothing else, so I took it down. So like I wrote in my original post here, hit or miss, gotta get lucky. As for me, I'm not posting a game on reddit again, which kinda sucks because resources to get games reviewed are limited as is."
baduk,3cyo4v,waterbucket999,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:28:18 2015 UTC,"The format of reddit tilts reviews more onto the side of discussions I think. I agree that a dedicated review site like GTL is probably a little better for formal reviews since you're guaranteed a person 2-3 stones stronger will go through the game with some effort. One note I think is that an ""ideal"" reviewer is around 2-4 stones stronger than yourself. It's not necessarily better for someone way stronger to review, since at a certain point, it becomes hard to separate the comments that will help and ones that are just nit-picking at a certain strength. A 7k player for instance probably has a very good idea what separates someone of his strength from a 10-12k player, whereas a 5d player might have very little practical idea at what would help a 12k player and what's better left for 5k level.  Side-note: I've personally only had good experiences with GTL, both as a reviewer and review-ee, I'd give them another shot. Could be that the prospective reviewer was busy and had to pass it along, which happens sometimes."
baduk,3cyo4v,BenzineBro,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:34:58 2015 UTC,"pro game-watching   This isn't a good idea unless you are maybe 5k and above. (This is still quite optimistic) The idea of using games to improve is by thinking to yourself where the correct move is to play and when something else is played to think for yourself why your move could be wrong and what the new move hopes to achieve. The problem with pro games is that the reasons for playing moves can be a little deep if you don't have the required preliminary knowledge to help explain moves. If currently you are losing to the ""newest of players"" and wish to improve then you don't have any business learning from pro games.  The risk of watching pro games is that you start to memorize moves without learning their meaning. This is absolutely toxic for your game because then you don't know how to follow up on the moves. This will cause you to lose a lot of your games. (The same is said for memorizing joseki.)   provide results that show.   First of all, it if very rare that you will find that you will improve on a 1:1 scale in terms of study time. It is very often that you will go on losing streaks when you study because you will have a lot of new concepts in mind which you won't have the experience to implement. It's all well and good to study positions in a book but on a real board positions can get messy and tricky until you figure everything out. Not to mention that when you learn new things you hold the old ideas in your mind simultaneously until you learn how to use the new ideas. (I know this from listening to this audiobook on learning.)  This means that when you learn a large volume of new things you will actually see a dip in your game play instead of seeing a direct increase. So don't be so focused on winning games in order to see you improve because you're just setting yourself up for disappointment.  Finally, it's important to do tsumego but it is also important to learn about other aspects of the game as well. Have you picked up any other books on Go outside of tsumego? If not then pick some of them up and learn that as well.  Long story short, just keep studying and have patience. You will improve and losing streaks happens to all of us from time to time. There's no magic way through it but to grit your teeth and stick with it. It's very likely that you'll learn the one thing that you are missing and pound your way up through the ranks soon enough. :)"
baduk,3cyo4v,waterbucket999,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:06:27 2015 UTC,"I personally like pro-games a lot. To me, it's very relaxing as opposed to doing problems or the like. If you go through a lot of pro games relatively quickly, it gives you a good sense for shape and direction. You're right in that it's hard to read into the specific tactics unless you're pro level yourself, so I wouldn't study pro games move-for-move unless you're with a discussion group or have a strong amateur dan minimum commentating for you."

baduk,3cyo4v,acceleratr,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:44:19 2015 UTC,"The kgs teaching ladder is a good place. Ask if someone wants to play a teaching game and you may get lucky. Look for dsaun(1k-1d), he plays teaching games every now and then.  I don't think watching or memorizing pro games is a good way to improve, especially for beginners. You should focus on basic direction of play, shapes and simple tsumego. Even spending too much time on reviewing I don't think is a good idea, since beginners are too weak to know what they should have done anyway.  Get the learn to play go series of books and read those, also there's the usagi go books that are free(google it, it's on senseis library). Opening theory made easy is also a very good book."
baduk,3cx1jd,metaperl,3,Sat Jul 11 15:05:47 2015 UTC,"Your moves are well thought out; going through your plays I can see your intentions and you make more good plays than bad plays which is good. The game was decided very early on because your opponent took advantage of your weak opening moves. You tried hard to recover the difference once black had firmly established himself but it was pretty much decided by around move 30.   I highly suggest brushing up on your Joseki. The opening is the most important and often lacking part of gameplay for beginners and once you master basic joseki sequences your game will improve rapidly. Always remember that the order of importance in games goes: corner, middle, and yose.   edit: I forgot to mention a key piece of advice that I found very useful when I was first learning go; always look at the big picture and consider all your options. I know that once you get into the flow of a game it is very easy to forget to think and start playing on instinct but unless you are a professional player more often than not that kind of play style can backfire on you. Always try and think of which move will benefit you the most and take your time to really consider every single play. A very good way to go about it is to think, ""Where can I play that would annoy my opponent the most?"""
baduk,3cx1jd,ThatOneAsianDude,2,Sun Jul 12 07:24:34 2015 UTC,"W8 It's probably not the right choice, but this isn't my strong suit either. I guess P5 would keep it simple. W16 Peeping like this is seldom good. You ideally want to save this for later, when maybe you can cut it. I'd go for L5, or if I'm feeling really aggressive, N7. W24 Too small. O17 seems better, since that corner stone is starting to look lonely. B25 Oh, dear, black noticed it too. B29 This is overly greedy. W30 L4 makes life much harder for black. W36 This no longer threatens anything. F3 would be my choice. W62 Very small, doesn't threaten anything or protect anything worth the trouble. Black has already escaped by now. W68 This threatens to split two groups which are alive. W70 You're ""forcing"" black to shut off a weak spot. W74 If you want to do something to black in this area, R2 is far more effective. W82+84 You should really not fear cross-cutting so much. A bit of mayhem can create chances after all. W152 Did you think of K17 and Q17 around this time? They're fairly big threats, so black would be crazy to ignore them. It's a free +3 if you play them both. W172 Both Q17 and L14 are still bigger. W190 MUCH better shape would be to defend this at O11 since that protects the N12 stone too.   Overall, I'd say try to be little more adventurous, and learn from all the excitement that gets you. Worst case you lose a bit more, but it's okay. You learn more from losses anyway.  Oh, and when you think you're losing, change to berserker mode. Doesn't always work, but it's better to go out in a blaze of glory because at least you will have a really clear point where you can resign."

That being said, I have a Korean vocabulary of roughly 100 words and I've watched several Korean TV series with English subtitles and I don't think I learned a single word that way.  The most productive thing I've done is a few lessons in Rosetta Stone.  (I had free access to it for a short time.)"
baduk,3cxl02,mrnoonan81,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:15:43 2015 UTC,"Supposedly, learning this way doesn't work at all if you have the subtitles on."
baduk,3cxl02,butthenigotbetter,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:05:31 2015 UTC,"One thing it did do, though, is give me some grasp on pronunciation and usage of the words I do know.  (The Korean I hear in my life is limited to a few individuals and even then, it's not conversational.)  Short of watching, say, Pokoyo in Korean (kids show), I can't see someone deducing the language from TV even without subtitles.  If you don't know where one word ends and the other begins, there's nothing to be gained.  This is why I say you need a foundation first."
baduk,3cxl02,BoneHead777,2,Sun Jul 12 04:19:55 2015 UTC,"Learning from subtitled video is enormously inefficient, although it's possible. If you want to invest effort into learning Korean, it's definitely not the best way.  WITHOUT subtitles though ... you would have a hard time verifying if your guesses were anywhere near the meaning of the words. A lot of words just aren't common enough that you could guess all of them.  The only time you can really use videos as your primary language learning method is if you'll be watching them anyway, and regularly, over a very long time period (years) and you have zero intention of doing more efficient language learning.  There's also the slight problem that Korean has a different writing system. If you don't rehearse that, you will be unable to read or write it."
baduk,3cxl02,kamikazzoo_,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:34:47 2015 UTC,"Basically, as far as I'm aware, this is the one language learning method which actually works better for children. That being said, children are terribly slow at learning a language (compare the skill of a one year old with that of an adult who has been seriously studying a language for a year. After spending a year in Brazil, I'd say my Portuguese was comparable to that of a 5yo.)  However, adults do that well because unlike children they have the possibility to fall back on information. If you don't do that, you're doing yourself a huge disfabour. You'd still learn the language, but it'd take really long and I suppose that your language production skills would seriously lack behind since you get zero feedback.  So do yourself a favour and study it properly. Set a foundation and then watch baduktv."
baduk,3cxl02,kamikazzoo_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:47:55 2015 UTC,"That's how I learned English, but I started when I was 7 and have no idea how effective this method is as an adult. I also know of a Romanian girl who is fluent in spanish because of telenovelas. But BadukTV will be so specialized I don't think you'll learn a lot of things.  Better binge-watch kdrama. Also Korean cinema is really good.  Edit : from the other comments I feel the need to point out that if this method ever works, it would take a loooong time. Like years."

His topical lessons are spot-on, especially the ones about opening. He explains reasoning behind the initial moves, followups, possible counter-strategies, suitable josekis, trick plays, what to look for in a particular opening -- what your general strategy should be -- and usually peppers it with a special move or two that has a more general application in the game, but comes very handy in that particular opening. All that in a single 1 hour lesson. Quite condensed stuff and more than well worth the 40€ monthly fee for spectators (you don't get to play in the league, but you have access to all the saved lessons and can ask questions during live ones).  Yunguseng Dojang is suitable for mid-kyu to low- and mid-dan. Try looking up his free lectures; scour the account and check out the samples."

If you want to get stronger, the most important part is persistence. If you never enjoy the thrill of winning, you'll get bored or frustrated. It's much more rewarding to beat a human opponent, after all.  On KGS (and probably other servers), there are players who are quite weak, since you're not the only one just starting out.  The thing with tsumego is that there are a lot of patterns which you may encounter, but in a single specific game you will only encounter some of them. Whoever has them figured out perfectly will win, but in most games you will encounter situations neither side knows at all, too.  If you have a lot of potential situations figured out, you can create plans which use them, and you won't have to wonder what to do which saves a lot of time. Online, nearly all games are timed, so being faster is a major advantage.  At first, tsumego will not seem all that useful, but the more you know, the more you'll start to run into them in games."
baduk,3cw0y1,revolvingdoor12,8,Sat Jul 11 06:25:46 2015 UTC,"The Direction of Play is a great book for expanding your perception of the game and I found it very helpful. That said, Kajiwara was a bit of a romantic and not all of his ideas about Go were accepted or followed by other pros. My advice would be to experiment with the concepts you learn from the book, but remember that there are many ways to play and don't treat anything as doctrine.  In your game, using 10 to approach at R14 would also be good and would arguably be approaching from the 'wider' side. However, it looks like Black's moyo would be bigger after that and Black's already one move ahead, so O17 is also playable.  Personally, I would usually play 10 at F17 because (as White) it's a good idea to challenge Black's moyo on the left and reduce its scope (F17/F16 are good points for Black soon too). A very loose, but useful rule of thumb is: me bigger, expand; you bigger, reduce. Reducing at O17 or F17 is a reasonable choice for White in this opening.  R14 wasn't a mistake for Black either - if anything, we might just call it territorial and many strong players play like this because they don't like giving up the corner too easily.  A pincer at the top would also be a good choice though and, if White invades at 3-3 for example, Black can aim to come away with sente and expand his moyo further. If that's your preference, you could also consider pincering at M17 after White slides to Q18. I can imagine Kajiwara questioning either R14 or R17, because they give white an opportunity to play around K17/K17 (reducing Black's top left potential), but that's not an absolute rule.  I think what you might be feeling is partly the motivation to do more with your stones, because of Kajiwara's passion. You might also be feeling that the star points tend to simplify the game. They're less directional and more forgiving than most other opening moves (except maybe 3-3) so star point openings tend to be simple with no clear 'best move'.  If so, that's good! Just use that motivation to experiment and try not to feel too dissatisfied with your game. There are no real mistakes in the game you've shown up to 14 and I wouldn't be able to tell you whether it was played by 15 kyus or pros. Continuing at R6 is also reasonable for Black.  If you're feeling that your games seem a bit too simple or dull, try mixing it up with some 3-4, 3-5 or 5-4 point openings as you read through The Direction of Play. Those openings will force you to be more considerate of the direction of play and will usually make the game more interesting for both you and your opponent. :)  And remember, there are many ways to play and many interesting paths to follow in Go."
baduk,3cw0y1,gogameguru,3,Sat Jul 11 07:06:30 2015 UTC,"It's not a huge deal but I don't think o17 is the best move. If white wants to break up blacks position he should play f17 to prevent a double wing. Usually you want to approach a 4-4 that has a side extension. Leaving that aside, in general R14 is considered slightly better than o17 because you are approaching from the side where you have a helping stone, as opposed to playing in the opponents area(which means a fight will be slightly more difficult), but the difference is small and they are both fine(for any level)."
baduk,3cw0y1,acceleratr,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:27:12 2015 UTC,"There's nothing immediately wrong with this way of playing. Especially not at 15k. Extending to R10 or Q10 immediately might lead to a double approach on your corner, which, while not an impossible way to play, might lead to complications early on that aren't easy to handle. The kind of direction of play choices I would pay attention to in your position is stuff like ""should I back off or pincer?"" and after a 3-3 invasion ""should I block e.g. left or up?""."
baduk,3cw0y1,Hugaramadingdong,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:04:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's especially awful to play like that. At 15k you will rely far more on being able to read out close contact fights better than your opponent, anyway.  It's very hard to see the benefits of one choice over the other in fuseki when you can't simply read out the consequences. Don't sweat the details too much just yet."

baduk,3cva7y,TomSwirly,2,Sat Jul 11 04:21:07 2015 UTC,"Erlang could probably be somewhat slower than C++ but likely only marginally.  First guess - you didn't use explicit typing so your integers (bools, etc) are objects instead of primitives.  This might result in huge and unnecessary costs..."

baduk,3cva7y,zehipp0,3,Sat Jul 11 05:39:28 2015 UTC,"First of all, you should be using C or C++. Basically, those to are your only options. There is a reason why something like 99% of top chess and go engines are written in those two languages. I tried converting my go engine to D but when the old program could do 50K heavy single-threaded 9x9 playouts in a second the new one could only do about 20K. And D should be pretty darn fast. I've never heard of Elixir but I am almost certain it is a very, very bad choice.  Second, when you are picking a move from a list of empty squares you don't have to remove the tried moves. Guess the first index i, if that doesn't work try i+1, then i+2, wrap around if necessary. If we come back to i then just pass. If you are not careful, removing moves from the middle will cause reallocs which are expensive. This is a pretty minor detail though.  Third, you should update everything you can incrementally. Finding out all the empty squares by looping over the board is much more expensive than just incrementally updating a list. Same goes for a lot of other stuff. If you do not wish to change the language this is where you should focus your efforts."
baduk,3cva7y,TomSwirly,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:30:23 2015 UTC,"I hear you and you are correct, Erlang/Elixir isn't a great choice, tho I'm arguing that C/C++ do not offer the same type of ease when it comes to network distributed computing with embedded supervisors, running on different architecture, etc. It is really best of class in that domain AFAIK. So that's the whole point of this little project, trying to see if my hypothesis has value :) Also, I have done it once in C++ before (without the distributed part) so it'd be no fun doing the same thing twice ;)   On your two points, just want to thank you for taking the time to think about it. I'm not sure your second point apply, as Erlang implements all of its list as linked list (there are no arrays in the C sense) - removing something in the middle is supposed to be O(1) and accessing an element by its index is O(n). Profiler says that I'm not at those type of optimization yet anyway, everything else is just so damn slow :) As for the third point, I actually had first tried this approach and all the bookkeeping necessary to update the list of empty coordinates (when adding a stone, it's easy, but when capturing groups or playing ko, it's a bit less so), I couldn't get it to be much faster than just looping over the elements of the Tuple that I use for storing the board. Nonetheless, it's a good point and I'm keeping my eyes peeled to see if there are other things that could be computed incrementally. Thanks!"
baduk,3cva7y,TomSwirly,2,Sat Jul 11 23:10:34 2015 UTC,"Playing a move and finding empty coordinates are both O(1) with arrays, with linked lists it's O(n) for both (if your linked list is the whole board 19x19, thats on the right order of magnitude - 400x). Plus, for an immutable board you're probably recreating the board each time you play a move - again O(n) vs O(1) for mutable arrays if you just play the move, then unplay it. You basically need mutable arrays, or else hack around not having them."
baduk,3cva7y,TomSwirly,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:57:44 2015 UTC,"If your arrays aren't mutable, you will be in big trouble.  EDIT:  I wrote a much longer comment with details."
baduk,3cva7y,TomSwirly,3,Sun Jul 12 18:32:58 2015 UTC,"I thought about this a bit and concluded that it is going to be impossible to do in Erlang - C++ is going to be your only choice.  (C is not a good choice.  Even if there were marginal efficiency gains, the tremendous increase in the effort required to construct the program in C over C++ would not be a good trade-off - but in fact, carefully written generic C++ code can be more efficient than C, thanks to the marvellous optimizer that often speeds your code up by half an order of magnitude and quite often a lot more, and has much more information to go on in a C++ program.)  Don't get me wrong - I believe that for many tasks, languages like Erlang offer perfectly acceptable performance, but this isn't one of those tasks.  You have underneath the hood a very large number of very small objects - at the lowest level, a lot of stones on squares.  In Erlang, at some point each of these is a dynamic allocation of some type.  Your poor heap will be trashed - but more, you lose locality of reference.  Your data pipelines sit barely used - and correctly used data pipelines can again lead to half an order of magnitude improvement in performance over reading each word in independently.  Even worse, since mutations are discouraged in Erlang, each change to a board results in a host of dynamic allocations to make a new board.  Generally, optimizing early is a bad idea - but in the case of a brute force activity like ""playing Go"" you have to write the code from the start to be as efficient as possible.  How would you do it in C++ to make it super-efficient?  The first thing to look at is the board representation - how do you represent the current board position?  A classic idea that might work well here is the bit board - each stone is represented as a single bit in a string of bits.  This means you need two boards - one for the black stones, one for the white - so how is this better?  It's better because you can use the processor's own native operations to do operations lightning fast, at the cost of a small amount of memory - memory you instantly save because there are no heap allocations in your board.  Let's suppose you have a 64-bit processor (and the code we write will be very efficient for 32-bit as well...)  One row of black or white pieces takes 19 bits.  We can fit three of these into one 64-bit word.  So we can fit all the black pieces into 7 64-bit words, so our total structure is 14 64-bit words.  (We could lose one word by packing the last black row with the last white row but I think that's going to cause more trouble than it's worth.)  struct RawBoardLayoutInMemory {     // In real code, you'd have more sophisticated C++ structures that would hide all      // of this from you but still provide this raw, linear, in-memory layout.      uint64 pieces[2][7]; };   Suddenly a lot of operations become extremely cheap.  Copying a board is a 112-byte straight copy - your data pipeline will handle this for you very fast.  Comparing two boards for equality is a straight comparison of up to 112 bytes - but you have a 64-bit processor so it's actually 14 arithmetic operations.  How many stones on the board?  Counting the number of bits set in a word is one instruction on many machines, or can be heavily optimized using bit trickery.  What about adjacency?  You could do various bit manipulations but much easier, you store for each position on the board a bit board containing just the adjacent squares.  (Cost?  56 bytes * 19 * 19 or about 20K, which you allocate and fill once, at the start of the program.  Nothing!)  Then you use ""bitwise and"" (&) and in 7 arithmetic operations you get an adjacency board.  Perhaps the real program might be quite different - but I hope I've given you the flavor of how you'd approach such a solution.  More, I think it's pretty clear that such an approach would intrinsically beat any structure you could possibly set up in Erlang by an order of magnitude or more because there really is no way in Erlang to lay out a lot of bits in memory and get the processor to do all the work directly for you.

baduk,3cslj1,BenzineBro,3,Fri Jul 10 23:59:07 2015 UTC,"A friend of mine is a big fan of the 3-3 since it seems that it makes a lot of players panic until they realise just how ""inert"" the move is. (i.e. It takes only 4ish points right away and its a little harder to develop with. Nothing to be afraid of.) His usual fuseki is a 3-4 shimari with the 3-3 in the opposite corner on the same side.  I find that dealing with the 3-3 is a matter of building a moyo since black doesnt have much capabilities of building one. (Obviously this is just one approach and isn't an ""instant win"" formula. The game is still competitive regardless)  I find that a lot of players like to split at the 10-3 point right away which seems to be good for black since he can push white around right away and make profit. (3-3 and 3-4 shimari is about as strong a position you can get with 3 stones in 2 corners so that gives plenty of scope for attacking.)  Just my 2 cents."

I'd copy and paste the bolded Chinese addresses into Google maps to make sure you're getting the right location.  I'm planning on going back this winter for a week.     When I went to the Taiwan Chi Yuan (professional association), the receptionist said that people play there on Wednesdays.       Since it wasn't a Wednesday, I went to the 棋聖 Kisei/Qisheng go club that she recommended instead.  I played the owner there, 程清江 Cheng Qingjiang, and after giving me 6/7 stones, the game ended within 1 point.  He's very strong, and said that foreigners show up to the club every now and then.  I'm not too sure of the range there, but the vast majority of the players were dan level.  I played two others who were either strong SDK or dan.     Language may be an issue.  Although Taiwanese people take 6-7 years of English, the general population isn't that great at it.  I'm sure you'll be able to get a match, however.     The professional association is located: 台灣棋院文化基金會 Taiwan Chi Yuan Culture Foundation 台北市100羅斯福路三段28號8樓 No. 28, Section 3, Roosevelt Rd, Zhongzheng District, Taipei City, Taiwan 100 8th Floor (Quick walk south from Exit 2 of Guting Station on the MRT)       A go club here: 棋聖模範棋院 Kisei Model Go Institute 台北市106復興南路二段200號3樓 No. 200, Section 2, Fuxing S Rd, Da’an District, Taipei City, Taiwan 106 3rd Floor (Quick walk north from Technology Building Station on the MRT)"

baduk,3cjakg,Mikuro,5,Wed Jul 8 23:46:59 2015 UTC,"Providing an objetive answer; probably not.  On the other hand, if you are enjopying it, and really think you have something new or interesting to offer; yes, it the f*ck does!  What's your approach to the ranking system? As a chess player for many years, this is the only feature in which I find chess is superior to go. I do prefer an elo-alike system; players start in a ground level (maybe around 1600) and after every game a simple algorithm adjusts the elo. To me it'd be interesting a mixed system, something like 1800-12k (I guess in OGS you have this, but I think the ""elo"" is only found in your profile).  Just my two cents."
baduk,3cjakg,emdio,3,Wed Jul 8 12:03:23 2015 UTC,"There are several servers that use Elo or something similar, sometimes in addition to rank. Tygem, for example, has distinct ranks and ratings. Your rating is like Elo. Your rank is based on promotion/demotion by the number of games won/lost in 20 consecutive games.  GoQuest has a similar system, although their rank promotion is a bit quicker (3 wins in a row to promote, I think). So sometimes you'll see a 2000 15k and a 1600 1d. It's weird at first, but if you play a lot of games eventually rating and rank begin to correlate. I find rank on GoQuest to be fairly useless and only pay attention to rating, at least until the mid-dans.  BrainKing has a 1:1 relationship between Elo-like rating and kyu/dan ranks.   AGA and KGS also have ratings that correlate to ranks, but they use a more complex statistical model than Elo. There are advantages and disadvantages. The good part is that a player can zero in on their actual rank in very few games (maybe 3). The bad part is that the stability varies much too wildly based on your playing frequency. If you play a lot of games, it becomes nearly impossible to promote if you improve (this is why so many KGS players have multiple accounts; it's easier to start a new account than to promote an existing one up to your level). If it were up to me, there'd be a sigma floor built in to prevent this rank lock-in.  None of the Go systems I've seen are zero-sum, which is probably for the best. I think Elo is traditionally zero-sum."
baduk,3cjakg,Mikuro,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:45:25 2015 UTC,"Many thanks for the info, much enlightening.  I don't know much about the Elo-alike systems, but I bet it's a zero-sum one (after a game, the winer adds the same points as the loser diminishes). Not sure if a no zero-sum could have some side effects (inflation? deflation?) due to this asymmetry."
baduk,3cjakg,emdio,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:12:09 2015 UTC,"I don't have much experience with chess, but looking at FIDE's web site, I see that it's not strictly zero-sum because players have different K-values. These seem to be similar to sigmas, except that FIDE sets them at fixed values based on rating, age, and number of games played. Seems like a reasonable balance between simplicity and effectiveness.  If two players have the same K-value, it will be zero-sum, so in practice it often is.  It looks like they also have a separate system to determine entry rating after your first tournament. I'm not sure how you enter a tournament without any rating; do chess tournaments not typically have divisions? *shrug*  Anyway, it seems like FIDE's system, whether it's strictly Elo or not, is pretty well thought-out and could be applied to a Go server easily enough. The specifics of the ""entry rating"" are probably more important in the Go world since we really, really care about rank and playing opponents of similar strengths."
baduk,3cjakg,Mikuro,2,Wed Jul 8 17:54:46 2015 UTC,"do chess tournaments not typically have divisions? shrug   Only by sex :)  No, at least AFAIK, and I'm talking about open tournaments, in the first round you are paired (almost?) randomly. Afterwards they are paired by their score (but then again, not having their elo into account).  Abiout the ""entry ranking"", I agree with you, say 100 Elo, make a much larger difference in go than in chess (for example, first round surprises in open tournaments are not that weird in chess, but I'm sure would be imposible in go). Maybe some tsumego or tesutji puzzles could be of any use?"
baduk,3cjakg,emdio,2,Wed Jul 8 18:10:54 2015 UTC,"An upset on the order of one rank is normal enough. 3 or more is rare but does happen occasionally.  According to the AGA, a player should have an 84% chance to win against a player just one stone weaker. That would put one rank at nearly 300 Elo points. I don't suppose you see chess upsets with a >600 point difference too often, do you?  That would mean that if you start at zero, go Elo ratings should go up to about 11,000! It's true that Go seems to have a wider range of playing skill than chess."

baduk,3cjakg,makoivis,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:51:48 2015 UTC,"You can see how your graph moves every day. If you have a lot of games on your record, each new win makes very little difference. It can get to the point where you'd need to win dozens of games in a row to promote.  It's not totally locked, just more rigid than anyone wants. If you don't play so often it's fine."
baduk,3cjakg,olosh,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:37:43 2015 UTC,"I'm confused about this idea of lock-in, which I hadn't heard before. I thought KGS had an algorithm which weights old games much less than recent games. My rank is always shifting."
baduk,3cjakg,makoivis,2,Fri Jul 10 04:12:47 2015 UTC,That's how all the rating systems work on OGS and KGS already: they use a rating system that's not entirely unlike ELO that's then mapped to a kyu/dan rank.
baduk,3cjakg,sphaso,2,Wed Jul 8 13:52:20 2015 UTC,IGS and OGS use ELO style rating but KGS is totally different.
baduk,3cjakg,oren740,3,Wed Jul 8 14:14:05 2015 UTC,"KGS usea a similar method, it just incorporates your most recent games as a regression function basically.   It's really just an extension of an ELO-like rating system."

Sometimes someone nags the OGS devs to make it so but it seems it's not gonna happen. Why OS is a great feature? bugs can be addressed pronto, features can be discussed knowing how it actually works, anyone curious can see what's happening and possibly why etc.etc. Of course there's also the problem with managing multiple devs, but I've never seen this being a problem, even in semi-big projects (e.g. pouchDB).

Since then, there have been some improvements specifically to address weak points of MCTS (such as ko fights and liberty races), which helped the programs get to strong dan level, but at this point it seems most of the low hanging fruit is gone.  MCTS programs get stronger with more computing power, but the gain gets increasingly smaller. At this point we can still expect programs to get stronger due to better hardware, but only slowly. Unless there are more algorithmic breakthrough, it may take decades before the hardware gains lift the programs beyond pro level."
baduk,3cadtt,herminator,2,Mon Jul 6 13:11:17 2015 UTC,"To me computers seem to get stronger every year. I believe computers will be beating top pros by 2030, but not by 2020. I have the crazystone 2013 program and it's pretty strong (kgs 5 dan, but can make some endgame mistakes). I've also seen some 5 dan bots on kgs these last years, and can't remember seeing this back in 2012. I don't think AyaBot was stronger than 1 dan back in 2012, but now it's at 4 dan on kgs. There has just been a new release of crazystone too but I don't know how strong it is."
baduk,3cadtt,acceleratr,4,Mon Jul 6 10:43:50 2015 UTC,"The top bots get a stone or two on KGS because the time requires the human player to play quickly.  If the top bots were required to play at a more leisurely pace, their mistakes would be more easily seen.  I also have Crazystone 2013, and while I can't judge its playing strength, I have let a couple of dozen dan players play the software.  I'd guess that the software ranks about 2 - 3 dan at 1 minute a move speeds or slower.  A Monte Carlo simulation is only as good as its input.  Creating a great Go heuristic is hard, and takes time and research."
baduk,3cadtt,ggleblanc,2,Mon Jul 6 11:23:45 2015 UTC,"Creating a great Go heuristic is hard, and takes time and research.   I thought that's the whole point of Monte Carlo. There is no great heuristic for Go thus you use MCTS."

I haven't played against it much though but it definitely felt stronger than 2 dans on kgs. I lost my first game and won the second, but I used a few undos and the bot made a stupid endgame mistake lol. I think it messes up in the endgame, I believe I also remember this from kgs, but it's strong in the middle game."
baduk,3cadtt,acceleratr,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:33:40 2015 UTC,"I don't particularly feel well with rating strength based on time settings like blitz or ""1 minute a move.""   I dunno, it just doesn't feel right to me compared to things like ""up to 10 mintues per move"" which I think is a reasonable amount of time for important moves. It feels like a gimmick to me - ""Haha, you can't think fast enough"""
baduk,3cadtt,Edoexplosivepawn,2,Mon Jul 6 11:45:13 2015 UTC,I've been out of the go scene for a few years but computers reached 6dan!?  Is this when they play long games or only for blitz?
baduk,3cadtt,blinkSCV,0,Thu Jul 9 21:40:52 2015 UTC,Its also a question of resources. AFAIK there is not even one person who works on Computer Go full time. The programs are commercial and developed by one or two people and in private as commercial programs. There are no big research projects and or IBM pouring millions into the problem. No doubt if they were go programs would see a lot more improvement. But I agree it seems a few more breakthroughs - either in developing new concepts or more likely in applying old/different concepts to go programming - as happened with MCTS would be necessary for go computers to reach professional levels.
baduk,3cadtt,takaSC2,3,Mon Jul 6 14:10:39 2015 UTC,That isn't true at all. There is a university in China that has an entire department dedicated to Computer Go AI's.
baduk,3cadtt,Daegs,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:47:38 2015 UTC,That is really interesting! Which university? I thought both Crazy stone and Zen (the strongest programs) are both private programs developed part time by their developers!
baduk,3cb5j5,Thuruk,3,Mon Jul 6 15:15:46 2015 UTC,"Hi, I gave it a shot.  http://eidogo.com/#3unlEiyR:0,0 Explanations below.  At move 20, black is ahead and there are two major extensions left.  Your move ended up with a weak group and two fairly settled white groups using the two extensions.  I would suggest taking the top extension and setting up a corner invasion, then see how white reacts.  If he wants to play ""let's enlarge our frameworks"", consider playing along because your framework is bigger on the right side.  I don't quite understand the intentions behind the moves around 55, but I gave some variations that seemed less painful for black (to me).  Near the end, the block going outside is a mistake.  You can block inside and white is dead in the corner.  Since you did block outside and letting white live in the corner, you should follow through and use the thickness to attack the bottom.  It's a tough and probably losing battle but probably the best you can do at that point."
baduk,3cb5j5,useless_panda,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:21:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Move 20 I considered the extension too, but I was simply too afraid of running a moyo contest and went for the default break up. But your variation looks much better."
baduk,3cb5j5,wren42,3,Mon Jul 6 22:41:27 2015 UTC,"I did a short review of the first 20 moves to look at how you got to that point.   http://eidogo.com/#4sUoINcUH:0,0  you should NOT be afraid of a moyo contest at move 20.  you have a huge lead due to white's blunders in the early game (even though you missed the big play at k4).  These may not have been visible to you, but they are significant.   also, there was no need to surrender so early. I understand that having him live in what you considered your secure corner is disheartening, but this was by no means a lost game.   You have enormous influence on the top, and whites right side group is very vulnerable.  you can easily convert some points in the center."
baduk,3cb5j5,ILOSTJZ,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:31:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much. :-)  As for why I didn't counter pincer, it wasn't on my radar at all. I considered taking the corner or jumping out, then chose to change direction mainly because I had watched it in a dan game before and wanted to try it.  Usually I take the corner. I'm a boring player when pincered.  Guess I need to be more open for other possibilities and read a lot more."
baduk,3cb5j5,wren42,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:33:27 2015 UTC,"Huh, this is the second commented game I've seen in a short while that has focused a ton on fuseki for a relatively low-rank game. If you don't mind, could I ask your approximate rank?  To be honest, I'm of the opinion that the first few moves make little to no difference in double digit kyu games. In particular, I've gotta disagree with your comment about black having a huge lead by move 20, as well as your comment on move 9 in the game. If white had passively let black build a moyo it might not be ideal, but if white's strength is invading, then there's no telling where the game would end up. That is how these games tend to go - they are decided almost solely on who makes the fewest mid-game fighting errors.  Which brings me to my main point - I think focusing on mid-game fighting and life and death is definitely the way to progress at the ~10k level. I guess it couldn't hurt to learn some opening principles, but even at my level I lose games to players who clearly know no opening theory whatsoever with alarming regularity."
baduk,3c98wg,andeanballs,6,Mon Jul 6 02:10:56 2015 UTC,"I'm winning more with people but losing more to bots   Probably because bots are completely unfazed by nonstandard openings and will maintain their level of consistency. Humans are more prone to psychological attack.  For me, I think I fare well against such openings. I'm not an aggressive player, but also not scared, so an opening that is ""novel"" and doesn't abide by opening principles generally won't hold up. However, if it's an opening specifically used to create fights (and the opponent makes sure to force them), that's when they'll have a real chance of winning. It becomes a game about who's the better fighter, and that's going to be me only about half the time."
baduk,3c98wg,anon445,3,Mon Jul 6 04:30:09 2015 UTC,"in the games of the player I'm speaking of, he would go for 5 to 7 moves in that fashion before starting any possible fight. Yeah, the game goes for the cooler head and better fighter in those cases. It's also a good exercise for sense of direction imo. we should play sometime"
baduk,3c98wg,Breitschwert,3,Mon Jul 6 05:24:16 2015 UTC,"People like to dive into new and unexpected situations head on. If you play an uncommon corner opening, people feel compelled to respond there right away, so if you play a very high stone and they respond soon, you will get the result you want (a fight and/or resulting early influence).  People should realized that a corner secured by an uncommon move is a very open corner and should be approached from the outside and only invaded/taken/reduced severely at the last possible moment (if even at all). If someone plays a 8-8, the corner will most likely require more moves to be secured. 8-8 and 5-7 are definitely center oriented, so you must take care not to jump into it, but make sure the outside is less valuable first."
baduk,3c98wg,BenzineBro,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:02:22 2015 UTC,"That's true about people jumping in corners, like they learn the ABC's of the game an repeat formulas henceforth. I think that a lot of players play for winning too much and are not having enough fun.   It's so interesting how it's a psychological game too right? Endless in nature. The fact that you see moves like 5-4 or 6-3 in pro openings speaks to me that they like to dive in that aspect of Go. O Meien style shimaris are also maddening moves and very fun.  For me it would be a dead game if it would be all about josekis and dry analytical thinking. The jungle of weird openings is vast, and the ones that dominate the upper ground early in the game such as the whirlwind or the uber-ponnuki have proven me to teach a lot about how the board works.  Some fun pro madness :) http://senseis.xmp.net/?StrangeOpenings"

Might want to change up the format though. Keep it to 1 proverb an episode (there aren't too many out there and some of them are quite obscure) and just spend as much time as possible analyzing the proverb and looking at situations in pro games or any high-level game where the proverb applies, doing the same for situations on the contrary. It is a lot more work but you won't run out of proverbs, you will improve from going through all those pro-games and your videos will be worthwhile even for a stronger player.  TL;DR- Go super in-depth with only one proverb for each episode to maximize learning and available material."

baduk,3c8zww,revolvingdoor12,3,Mon Jul 6 00:47:29 2015 UTC,"The specific example you give is not the kind of ko that can break the game, because white will have an opportunity to move elsewhere. In some circumstances, that pattern can lead to an infinite number of ko threats for fighting another ko, which you might just think of as another tactical advantage you can aim at.  A very interesting version of this is termed  eternal life.  To the best of my knowledge, KGS does not recognize superko, at least in the default rules (Japanese). In fact, I don't even think Japanese rules have a super ko rule. Under this ruleset, if a situation like eternal life arises, they just call the game a draw. There was a recent game highlighted on Go Game Guru in a major tournament where an eternal life arose."
baduk,3c8zww,mkmatlock,5,Mon Jul 6 02:24:09 2015 UTC,KGS does the correct thing. In Japanese rules after you repeat the position it declares the game N.R. = No Result. For other rule sets like AGA KGS will correctly ban the superko cycle. I don't think OGS implements these things.
baduk,3c8zww,KillerDucky,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:39:32 2015 UTC,"Indeed, for the rulesets that are supported KGS implements the appropriate form of ko.  This occasionally gets very confusing for players using AGA/Chinese who accidentally stumble into a long cycle and see a random square pop up (signaling a ko ban)."
baduk,3c761v,eksert,3,Sun Jul 5 14:41:52 2015 UTC,"Others will offer variations, I'm just here to share my thoughts.   I would play like white did in top left right, or perhaps make a two space extension. The reason I say this is because I don't think playing k4 will aid much in your learning. You can learn all the variations there are, but still be unaware of the justifications that guide them. And if your opponent decides to deviate, it may be hard to find a suitable punishment without the underlying principles.   It can certainly be fun and interesting to play it, and if that's your goal, explore away. But because you came here looking for follow-ups, it seems like you want to learn the ""right"" play; I want to forewarn you of the dangers of learning variations and the reasoning superficially. If you learn the principles, the variations will come naturally.   Anyways, ""attack and defense"" (elementary go series) has many variations for 3 space invasions, and also includes much of the rationale behind each move. I'd highly recommend it, if you have access.   Forgive me if I sound presumptuous. Just want to prevent someone making the same mistakes I did, if it's the case."
baduk,3c761v,anon445,2,Sun Jul 5 15:13:03 2015 UTC,Thanks mate! I am trying play faster by jumping 3 space.. I will check attack and defense absolutely!
baduk,3c761v,anon445,0,Sun Jul 5 18:17:30 2015 UTC,"If you go to josekipedia and try the same sequence, except white plays a small knights instead of one space jump as a response to the approach, it brings up a few more variations that you could get some ideas from. You'll have to read out what works and what doesn't and why, but it might help, since I know there aren't too many easily accessible resources."

baduk,3c6bgb,TwirlySocrates,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:24:58 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to document Go activities in the Metro Vancouver area for a while, and here's everything I know:  The Pacific Plaza (Unit 3010) club meets, at least, every Sunday. I don't know the exact times, but I know it's open at least from about 4 p.m. until late in the day. There's a $5 drop-in fee. Someone I know loves it there, but I've only ever been there once. They have a schedule posted on their door that says they meet daily, but I'm pretty sure that's no longer the case.  I think there's also a Go school in Richmond run by Cathy Li, 1p. I don't know much else about that, so you would likely need to email her (see here) for any more information.  Cathy Li also holds tournaments every few months at the Taiwanese Cultural Center in Vancouver (Marpole area). Once again, the best way to find out about these is to email Cathy Li and ask her to be included in her mailing list.  The UBC Go Club, as far as I know, still exists. They have a Facebook page, which should be your main source of information.  If you're willing to travel as far as Burnaby, there's the Nikkei Center Go club near Edmonds. They list their meeting dates here. Drop-in is $5, and you regularly get 10 or so players. Personally, this is my favourite place to play in Vancouver.  Further north in Burnaby, there's the SFU Go club. They might be holding informal meetings this semester - you can check their Facebook page to ask. They usually meet every Friday, from about 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.  If you're going to visit one of the university clubs, it's best to manage your expectations a bit. I used to frequent the SFU Go Club, and the last time I checked, they had very few players and was primarily comprised of gamers. I've never been to the UBC Go Club, but I've heard similar stories about the place.  Edit: If you want to get to know more players, you could also try joining the Canadian Go Association online league. Some of the players there live in the Vancouver area and may be willing to meet up."

baduk,3c5i4f,blackberrydoughnuts,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:12:19 2015 UTC,"hi, 5k (ish) here!  (move 6) the first thing you failed to do was take advantage of your opponent's first mistake - w's q10.  this is considered fairly poor for white because of b r13, which, because q10 is a fourth line stone, it can be undercut when white tries to make a base for himself. b r13 also forces w to try to create a base on the left hand side or his little q10 stone (usually with something like w r7) can be harassed for lots of profit for black.  if he does respond (like he should) you get sente to approach the top left.  w should have simply approached your top right stone from the right hand side, the standard approach is r14.  if w still wanted to split, which is slow, r10 is better than q10 because it gets undercut  speaking of the top left, you made a direction of play error by approaching from the wrong side.  B f17 should have been something like c15 or d15 (the most common approaches in this position). c/d15 is better because it prevents white from creating a framework on the left hand side of the board for free, and even if white pincers there are josekis for those :)  (move 30) should probably have been responded with something like k/l 14 to protect the k16 group's shape. w lives there anyways because of the weaknesses in your group there.    (move 49)j13 was a waste of a move and gave your opponent sente.  Best to leave the aji there for later when you can more effectively use it, and not have to give up big early game moves.  (move 97) c16 is a bit of a stretch- it would make more sense here to try to help out your c11 stone, by creating a base or jumping out to try to connect.  because you didn't do this, your opponent got to keep you in and attack c11...  (move 132) b13 probably should have died - w b12 is nasty business...  you abandoned the k4 group until it was way too late to save it, leaving weak groups on the board like that is never fun to have to deal with later  (move 226) those late game moves are always frustrating... when you have a lot of cut points like that make sure to read them out!  I think the biggest things to look at would be your early game fuseki, and not playing away until your groups are able to fend for themselves. if you would like some fuseki lectures, I've always been a fan of Battousai, who gives lectures on kgs every other wednesday in The Enclave (under social in rooms) He also has a youtube channel!  link to his lecture playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0m6tAcZoPE&list=PL05D44E6870BF7154  I hope I helped! :D"
baduk,3c5i4f,midocelli,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:16:39 2015 UTC,"r12 is better than r13 for move 7 I think. It puts more pressure on the white stone, the knights move approach is usually very strong against 4th line stones. I also think it would be OK to tenuki to approach the 3-4 (although that approach should be the from the right direction unlike the game) and then deciding which direction to approach the splitting stone from based on how the game develops."
baduk,3c5i4f,sharkweekk,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:01:38 2015 UTC,"r12 also has weaknesses at, say, r14 later, and the large knight is technically an enclosure for the top right that still puts some pressure on the q10 stone. q10 is in enough of a bad spot as it is because it's a high stone too.  because I like to play a bit more solidly in the opening of a game, I think I would still prefer r13.  as for the tenuki, that would simply be poor timing, as you can get a free move in (white is pressured to make a base) and then you can go and approach the corner anyways.  The tenuki is also undesirable because if you lose sente in the 3-4 approach w gets sente to approach your top right in sente, which helps him develop the right hand side."
baduk,3c5i4f,midocelli,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:41:39 2015 UTC,"I think this game was characterised by a lot of crazy fighting, white got away with lots of really questionable moves.   Try focussing on where you should play after White's move 14.   Move 30: White gets to hane at the head of three stones here; Move 36: White gets to play at the head of two stones here.   These two groups of stones end up being liabilities.   When the opponent plays at the head of the stones, to continue to develop this group in another direction, means you can't gain liberties for the group very fast.  The point you play fills a liberty plus you have to share liberties with the stones already played. So if your opponent can hane at the head of your stones, the development of that group is much slower, and if your opponent makes moves that develop her groups faster than yours, then opponent is getting the better deal.  Move 37: Starts a ladder which doesn't work, when Black saves his group from atari with move 43 at M15, White gets to double atari. White's laddered stones make good thickness for white. I want to say get better at reading out ladders, but I also want to say, this was only possible because of the weaknesses of the two stone and three stone groups that white got to play at the head of a few moves earlier. How could you have avoided those two weak groups causing this problem?  Move 224: White hanes at the head of two stones, Move 228, white plays at the head of two stones...  Two stones aren't very good shape when in contact with the opponents stones, you need to have ways of dealing with their lack of liberties if the opponent attacks. Otherwise you have to make a lot of bad moves to save them.  Often it is better to push one or twice more, to get a solid group which has no weaknesses.  I think working on shape, and making your groups more solid is a good goal, reading out crazy fights is crazy hard, so its better to make sure the fights are only as crazy as you can handle.  Do this by making sure you make groups that are well connected and have good shape."

I can't guarantee that any of these variations are the best ways to play, each of them is arguably situational and not all of them are appropriate for this particular position.

baduk,3c05o5,Thuruk,2,Fri Jul 3 16:03:21 2015 UTC,The sequence Thuruk is talking about is: http://eidogo.com/#4hGrl0Y5A. One of my favourite openings :).
baduk,3c05o5,UhOhTenuki,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:02:20 2015 UTC,Seems kind of awful for white.
baduk,3c05o5,baudtack,2,Fri Jul 3 19:10:05 2015 UTC,"http://eidogo.com/#DWMMcCfH  While the above sequence looks bad, the last move here is the reason the sequence is good, it is almost surely sente (if white ignores q9 is the proper punishment), which means black has expanded his moyo in sente, and likely gets a double-wing formation."
baduk,3c05o5,Chariot,2,Sat Jul 4 05:29:14 2015 UTC,"So it's a ""this is not bad for white because the alternative (what you posted) is worse for white"""
baduk,3c05o5,mkdz,2,Sun Jul 5 04:25:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, although it is important to ask ourselves how much we really needed in this area. Black spent his first 3 moves trying to develop the right side of the board, so he should get something pretty okay over here, being alive with points is almost certainly enough."
baduk,3c05o5,Chariot,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:31:06 2015 UTC,Have you looked on [josekipedia](josekipedia.com)? There's many variations there for each opening.  Here's my favourite variation from two of these openings that you're missing:   Kobayashi Low Chinese
baduk,3c05o5,UhOhTenuki,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:25:54 2015 UTC,This is a modern continuation for the orthodox when white splits. White usually doesn't split these days because it give black too good of a framework.

baduk,3c0z0y,anon445,4,Fri Jul 3 21:55:51 2015 UTC,I don't agree. Winning can often be a matter of who made the larger mistakes at my level.
baduk,3c1tsw,koticgood,2,Fri Jul 3 23:51:26 2015 UTC,"The best way is to practice. It seems you already have the right idea with doing tsumegos. When you finish a game, try reading out sequences in the review that you couldn't in game. Don't worry if starting out is rough. Spending the time and effort is really what activates your brain."
baduk,3c1tsw,Ornable_,2,Sat Jul 4 00:09:39 2015 UTC,"Do tsumego, do not use an electronic device to do so as it encourages guessing instead of reading. Do them on paper. Play one color go Learn better shape Very Important: Create and know the purpose of your move. If you know the intention of the move then it does a couple things to help you remember such as creating association which is the basis of all memory and giving you something to recall e.g. (what move did I play to break up my opponents influence and break the ladder in the lower left?)"
baduk,3c1tsw,fei2id,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:33:39 2015 UTC,"Tsumego practice will help you read ahead, but you need a lot of it. Like thousands of them."
baduk,3c1tsw,butthenigotbetter,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:45:10 2015 UTC,"I believe in playing moves you don't understand. If you know that a move does or does not work, avoid playing it.

baduk,3c1tsw,Trezker,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:00:10 2015 UTC,I rarely read 2-3 moves ahead. The more important questions are what are you looking at? Why is this important? How many solid and potential points do you and your opponent have? Where you can you maximize that number.
baduk,3bzw67,I-love-go,3,Fri Jul 3 14:35:43 2015 UTC,"Hah. I've known Tasuki some time ago. Im quite sure he would be very happy to see more poeple learn from his materials.   Those are mostly Cho Chikuns go problems. Very basic stuff that lets you develop reading skills from scrach, up to dan level.   Good basic stuff is always helpfull. Never forget where you came from.   A side note - Tasuki, if you're reading this. Lets play go? Teach me.   :)"
baduk,3bzw67,Angry_Jester,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:21:03 2015 UTC,Yes :) I'm using them to improve as well. I'm around 7k and I'm going through all 900 beginner's first. Don't feel above them (I did for a while) because there are some clever things to be had in them and they're good quality problems. I post the ones I particularly like as I go through them on my Tsumego Daily series
baduk,3bzw67,leonprimrose,4,Fri Jul 3 14:44:00 2015 UTC,"There is some pro or other who carries around a book of ~10kyu level problems and just does them all the time, because he believes instant recognition of those is more useful than spending an hour deeply reading a problem.

baduk,3bvy6p,butthenigotbetter,3,Thu Jul 2 16:39:33 2015 UTC,All i found was ko too lol it was from cho chikun so no answer key. My guess is that ko is right. It feels bad for ko to be right though doesnt it? Like we failed xD other than that i actually dont have a proper answer for you. I spent a lot of time working on it and staring at it trying to find something better lol it was a challenging one
baduk,3bvy6p,Thuruk,2,Thu Jul 2 17:15:08 2015 UTC,"""ko is wrong"" is really a problematic way to think though. Sometimes ko is the best you can do locally, and depending on your ko threats, you could win it, or use it as a series of ko threats itself.  Anyway, a lot of the Cho Chikun set have ko as their best answer, so that's probably it."

baduk,3by5ic,RoyGeraldBiv,6,Fri Jul 3 03:08:35 2015 UTC,"In an infinite space it would be impossible to prevent the someone from living, with even amount of moves.  Just running in any direction for example, simply extending a shape takes one liberty and gives three, so it profits two liberties for each move out into the open board.  If your opponent can only play one move to match that per turn, there is simply no way the group could ever be captured.  Now, maybe if one player had two moves for every move of his opponent on an infinite board, that might be possible to prevent life."
baduk,3by5ic,monkeymule,2,Fri Jul 3 04:00:59 2015 UTC,"if one player had two moves for every move of his opponent   Incredibly difficult. One stone, attachment + hane, extend/nobi, extend + hane at other head of two stones, empty triangle (the only way to prevent immediate capture), extend + hane (I hope this was clear)"
baduk,3by5ic,anon445,3,Fri Jul 3 04:42:31 2015 UTC,"Don't extend, do a 1 space jump instead. You don't care about losing a few stones, what you want is to eventually make life somewhere.  Anyway, the question is what we mean by ""making life"" in a context where the opponent makes two moves in a row."
baduk,3by5ic,nachof,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:35:10 2015 UTC,"If one space jump, then atari between and hane. It's a similar situation as before. I really think life is impossible in such a rules set, even if it's an infinite board with infinite moves."
baduk,3by5ic,anon445,5,Fri Jul 3 16:42:19 2015 UTC,"There's the shape game where you try to make life in a 17x17 box. It's not solved, so no one knows if you're alive or dead with perfect play on both sides.  With infinite space, you're alive. Even if the opponent kills off one of your groups you can just make another and another until he gets tired and gives up.^"
baduk,3by5ic,Thuruk,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:29:05 2015 UTC,For your first question no. It's impossible to prevent life. u/monkeymule explained it well  For your second there is actually a challenge game that does exactly that. I forget the exact size but it's exactly as you mentioned and there is a smallest box surrounded by black stones that white can make life with perfect play on both sides.
baduk,3by5ic,leonprimrose,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:04:22 2015 UTC,"Even on a 19x19 if the only thing someone is trying to do is live, and not doing crazy invasions, then it's pretty hard to prevent them from living. But in that situation you also often don't care because you'll be able to profit from a lot of local play."
baduk,3bv16n,kob93,7,Thu Jul 2 11:23:17 2015 UTC,"At that level, getting a teacher is best.  Other than that, the regular advice still remains: tsumego, playing regularly, reviewing games (yours and pro), reading advanced books.   What's helped me is taking a break from go at times, just one or two months long. When I come back, I'm a little rusty (joseki, fuseki, etc), but I retain most of what I learned, while being more able to get away from making the same mistakes I did before. I think playing too much can get us stuck in these ruts of the same patterns, and getting away from it to clear your head is a way to loosen the hold of repetitive mistakes and oversights."
baduk,3bv16n,anon445,2,Thu Jul 2 12:42:17 2015 UTC,"hey anon, thanks for replying, good info, I actually do the same thing when it comes to breaks , but i am already coming off of a long break."
baduk,3bv16n,odnihs,3,Fri Jul 3 03:55:20 2015 UTC,"If you know Chinese or Korean, watching weiqitv/baduktv is really helpful I feel. Unfortunately, the resources  in English are rather limited at that level (there's only a few pro commentary books), but I'd probably suggest just going through the classical tsumego series (gokyo shumyo, xuanxuan qijing, etc) until you are really comfortable with them. The higher level graded go problems for dan players and the latter two volumes of Lee Changho's L&D and tesuji series would also probably be good. I think the most important thing at this level aside from better reading is just better positional judgment (aka knowing if a situation or a sequence gives you a favorable result or not), which is probably best improved via reviews from pros (of either pro or amateur games)."
baduk,3bv16n,Thuruk,2,Thu Jul 2 14:11:49 2015 UTC,You could also start learning Chinese or Korean and unite the fun of learning a language with the purpose of having more studying material. ;-)

baduk,3bv8me,donjuan100,3,Thu Jul 2 12:47:56 2015 UTC,"Hello I am in the same boat as you We have just started a Go Club in Columbia, SC. We have been an AGA chapter for about 2 months know and are meeting at a local game store.   For reaching out to members and letting them dictate use as much social media as possible and ask people to interact with officers and each other. Things like Meetup and Facebook pages work well for this.  Our officers meet about 30 min before the actual meeting just for housekeeping stuff. Basically most of our meetings have been just playing games with each other or teaching new players. We have less than 20 people and half show up regularly at this point. But we think once we get some more members we may do some type of game review.   Also goclubsonline has some pretty great management features for a new club to use.  We have a large stock of Go books that we can check out to members using that software to track who has what.   Our 3 officers are actually pretty new to go and one of our members is actually much better than us. He is very nice to review games and give us and other members tips.   My biggest piece of advice is not restricted to go at all but projects of this nature in general. Find 1-2+ people that have the same level as enthusiasm as you do for the project to work with you. This is so important because if it's just you leading the charge doing everything it will burn you out. And somewhat related is to make sure the officers are clear about everyone's level of time commitment and responsibilities. This last part will help make sure everyone is on the same page when regards to club activities.   PM any questions you got. I am very active in trying to get this off the ground here in SC and would happy to help you with any questions you may have and hopefully I can learn something to help my club as well."

baduk,3bv8me,Deciq,3,Fri Jul 3 16:18:09 2015 UTC,"I think it really depends on the dynamic of the group and what rank the majority is. Generally if there's 1-2 players who are much stronger than all the rest, they could do reviews/lectures on different parts of the game for the weaker players.   A schedule for this group would look like:  6-7pm: Free play/9x9/13x13/19x19 (Waiting for all the members to arrive)  7-8pm: Lectures & Game Reviews (Different topics weekly like tesuji, joseki, fighting, end game etc)(pro or club games)  8-9pm: 19x19 games  But if most of the players are all around the same level, then showing up to just play a few games works well. If this is the case, then if the club stays consistent you'll most likely have guests who may be stronger that pass by (most of the time on vacation or business travel) who could do a guest lecture.   Schedule for this group:  6-7pm: Free play  7-7:30pm: Graded Go problems  7:30-7:40pm: Break time  7:40-9pm: Free play  General Advice:  Make a facebook group that's easily findable, get AGA registered, be consistent with times, and promote the club! (Well designed club shirts are the bomb)  Also, think about hosting a tournament every 6-12 months (at a school, library, cultural festivals, comic conventions) for players who want to travel from other cities/regions. Fun outing events are great every couple months with your club, family and friends (picnics, BBQ's at parks, beach go, etc).  I've been a part of most clubs in South Florida and pass by Go clubs whenever I travel. My brother lives in Philly so I might attend your club at some point in the future. :)  TL;DR: Just be consistent and make your club easily findable. Hope this helped!"

Your #1 priority should be to get people excited about the game (#4 on Nick Sibicky's 13 commandments for teaching Go). If you're hoping to draw in beginners, lectures aren't going to work as well as just sitting them down and introducing them to the game and playing a few rounds. Variations on Go work nicely for this too (capture Go for example).  I am part of a small group in a town of about 20,000. There are six of us. Not too bad for a rural area! We've recently gotten two beginners to join us. We just meet and play once a week at a decent cafe. We swap reading material but studying is done on our own time. Occasionally there are questions like, ""so who's memorized the avalanche joseki?"" It's pretty unstructured and that's worked OK so far.  I generally don't start looking to introduce structure to a club of any sort until there are more than about 20 members."

Be open to beginners and be able to teach them in a way they have fun with it! I think that starting the club by just playing games is good, and then seeing what members might want. Try and get strong players at the club who can lead too!  Make a website, AGA listing, email list, and keep them updated."

baduk,3bt7jw,hikaruzero,7,Wed Jul 1 23:35:30 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on the specific problems.  I'm about 1d, and there are some 3d problems in that book which I can solve almost at a glance, and others which I struggle with even after 5-10 minutes of staring at it.  When you say you can solve them within a minute, are you talking about some of them or all of them?  If you're talking about some of them (let's say 50%), I don't think that's terribly unusual, though I would expect a 10k player to only be able to solve a few at most.  If you mean nearly all of them in under a minute, you just might have excellent reading abilities but be very lacking at concepts/strategy.  Have you, by chance, made a strong habit of solving problems, and solved a lot of them?  I have a close friend who, while he doesn't play Go, we do play a few different games together (RTS, TBS, etc.) and he also generally has competent tactics but is very weak at overall strategy.  And I also play Go occasionally with another player who has dan-level reading abilities but mid-kyu level judgment and strategy.  So it's not unheard of by any means.  On the other hand, I would describe it as very uncommon to have such a steep imbalance between reading/tactics and judgment/strategy.  I think if you post a couple of example games, we might be able to tell you what we think about your play.  Even if you aren't looking for reviews, just posting a few games for us to glance over should give us a much more accurate opinion.  For what it's worth though, no, I don't find the problems in that book to be overrated."
baduk,3bt7jw,NoLemurs,16,Wed Jul 1 23:35:09 2015 UTC,"When you say you can solve them within a minute, are you talking about some of them or all of them?   Another question here is if OP is actually solving the problems.   It's pretty common to run into players who have developed a good intuition, and can guess the first move on a hard problem with 60-70% accuracy but who aren't actually reading out the full solutions.   These players also tend to believe that their accuracy is much higher than it is because of confirmation bias."
baduk,3bt7jw,hikaruzero,3,Thu Jul 2 00:18:38 2015 UTC,"I suppose that's a fair point.  It's one thing to be able to guess the answer intuitively, but it's another thing to be able to read out all of the wrong sequences and determine the answer for certain beyond all doubt."

This bias is attributed to a metacognitive inability of the unskilled to recognize their ineptitude. Conversely, highly skilled individuals tend to underestimate their relative competence, erroneously assuming that tasks that are easy for them are also easy for others.   David Dunning and Justin Kruger of Cornell University have postulated that the effect is the result of internal illusion in the unskilled, and external misperception in the skilled: ""The miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self, whereas the miscalibration of the highly competent stems from an error about others.""

Being able to solve in a book and being able to apply that skill to a real game where you're being pressured both by time and your own mistakes are completely different things.
baduk,3bt7jw,useless_panda,3,Thu Jul 2 03:15:13 2015 UTC,Yeah and I find that knowing there is a way to kill (as in a problem) v.s. realizing that you can kill or be killed in a real game is different.
baduk,3bt7jw,fei2id,5,Thu Jul 2 08:37:26 2015 UTC,"When you solve a go problem it shouldn't just be about finding a single answer.  It is about examining and reading out possibilities, and exploring them, what happens if your opponent plays outside of the best possible moves, what if the opponent, doesn't know he's dead and tries some shenaigans?   Whilst its tempting to think that finding the key point or moves that are the answer in the back, is the solution, there are also typically continuations that aren't played but assumed.  Everyone knows a bulky five is dead, but have you played out the sequence to kill it? Could you do it in a game?  There is also a certain amount of memorisation that occurs when you play go or do tsumego, and so maybe it is less about having read out the sequences and having memorised answers, this kind of way of answering tsumego, isn't as useful.   Try doing the tsumego again and instead of finding the right answers, find out why they are right, and find out the wrong answers and why they are wrong. The why of tsumego is more important than getting them right or wrong."
baduk,3bt7jw,Thuruk,6,Thu Jul 2 17:40:47 2015 UTC,"Short answer: your rating doesnt determine the go problems you solve and the go problems you solve dont determine your rating.   Unfortunately you may be very wrong about if you are actually solving the problem (and i hope its not on a computer guessing until you get it right). If you are able to read well then you are able to read well, reading in a go problem is easily translatable in game.   However if you are able to read well and solve these problems in your head, then you must be lacking pretty severely in basics such as direction of play, utilization of thickness, other things you can certainly read and learn in books.  The only way to know for sure is to see your games, not the problems. You should ALWAYS be interested in game reviews if you are kyu level and I feel dan players benefit from game reviews as well. Both self reviews and reviews from stronger players are perhaps the best way to improve you go. The only better thing I can think of is to actually play more games."

This bias is attributed to a metacognitive inability of the unskilled to recognize their ineptitude. Conversely, highly skilled individuals tend to underestimate their relative competence, erroneously assuming that tasks that are easy for them are also easy for others.   David Dunning and Justin Kruger of Cornell University have postulated that the effect is the result of internal illusion in the unskilled, and external misperception in the skilled: ""The miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self, whereas the miscalibration of the highly competent stems from an error about others.""

Anyway, even if OP can really solve problems from a book, that doesn't mean e has 3d reading skills. Actually using reading skills to read moves accurately and consistently in a game is a lot harder than doing problems from a book. Part of reading skills is knowing when, where, and how to read, and book problems spoon-feed you examples so that you're not training those parts of the skills."

baduk,3bt7jw,Snoron,2,Fri Jul 3 20:45:43 2015 UTC,"Adding to previous comments, I'd also say that solving a tsumego problem in a book and solving it in a real game are two very different matters. When you're solving problems in a book, you know there's an answer, so you look for it no matter what. In a game, you may give up after some time.

baduk,3bq7dy,sharkweekk,2,Wed Jul 1 07:00:28 2015 UTC,"Non-fuseki problem: http://eidogo.com/#vC0xmQPk  EDIT (my two cents for the fuseki problem): settle the bottom left with C2 or D2. Admittedly E8 encloses nicely for white, but it's gote, so black can invade the upper right next."
baduk,3bq7dy,ILOSTJZ,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:41:03 2015 UTC,"I like this idea as well. Some of the other suggestions, splitting at E8 for example, don't really seem to have a good follow up. Especially considering that white makes life with C3, any attack on the two space extension seems not to make up for the fact that black's group just got robbed of eyes. One of the typical ways to attack the two-space extension (b D11, w C11, b E9) allows white to slide all the way to B6, leaving black with nothing.  I think the saying ""strengthen yourself before attacking"" seems to apply here. You can also consider the balance of territory, black seems to be winning (considering the invasion options in the upper right), so playing ""solid moves"" is really all he needs to do right now.  Furthermore, if white gets to connect on the outside with the double keima, he is still not yet solidly connected, so there is some useful aji.  All that said. I'm 5k, so I'm probably totally off track."
baduk,3bq7dy,mkmatlock,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:01:51 2015 UTC,"I'm a way out of practice 5k (so probably 10k).  For the problem, I think A14 works. Black has a shortage of liberties.  On the fuseki, I'm currently looking at sliding into the upper right corner before solidifying the lower left. The lower centre is heavy and potentially problematic, but I'm not sure I can fix it with one move.   I'm sure I'm entirely wrong. ^  Hoping to find time to get back into the game, first time I've seen this study thread. Great idea and well presented!"
baduk,3bq7dy,pfafulous,2,Wed Jul 1 09:32:51 2015 UTC,"A14 allows black to play the two stone edge squeeze tesuji at B13 and black wins the capturing race.  Incidentally, this is the closest I've ever been to seeing the two-stone edge squeeze in an actual game."

baduk,3bq7dy,qwedswerty,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:32:52 2015 UTC,I like the idea with the fuseki and maybe attack and defense problems :) I haven't really done much with them but I think that might be a good place to differentiate between Tsumego Daily and the PGSG. As a study group you doing the type of problem that fosters more discussion would make a lot of sense :)  great series btw :) Keep it up!  edit: Just watched the pro game and this is my face -> ( O-O )
baduk,3bq7dy,leonprimrose,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:13:16 2015 UTC,"So in these types of situations I ask myself a series of questions: 1. Are any of black's groups weak and need to be defended?  2. Are any of white's groups weak and need to be defended? 3. If neither side has any weaknesses, where is the biggest point on the board?   Black's groups are strong (or at least appear to be in my DDK eyes), and I see a white group that has no eyes, which means it can be attacked so I would try to keep it split from the 2 space base on the left. The 2 space base has only one eye and can be harassed to gain strength (a leaning attack) and effectively split white's group. I am debating between D8 and E8. E8 looks like better shape for black, but D8 is a shoulder hit which shouldn't be ignored. D8-D9-E8-E9-F8-F9 is how I would invision the sequence ending up and now black has nice thickness to possible surround white's group."
baduk,3bq7dy,BulletD0dger,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:08:43 2015 UTC,For the fuseki problem i'm going with D3. It secures blacks group in the corner and if white encloses him on E8 black can cut later on and attack preferably the white group on the right.  If black jumps out (on D8 or E8) then white can play C2 starting to get a base of his own while taking away from blacks base.
baduk,3bo31t,NothingButTheRain-,2,Tue Jun 30 19:40:30 2015 UTC,"Wow, I'm surprised that white was able to keep the chunk on the left side. Normally, wouldn't one expect a successful attack at such a large chunk, protruding near center?"
baduk,3bo31t,jinnyjuice,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:15:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when I look over this game record the left side makes the least amount of sense to me.  I think there were a couple big opportunities (and tens of small ones) to avoid that area becoming a huge area for white:   Move 45 - While living in the corner is a decent strategy, it happens in gote. Jumping out with C6 is also dubious. I feel like jumping to E11 might be the best choice here. It pressures the weak white stones and if the group gets strong enough, then C6 starts looking attractive. Move 63 - It's hard to sugar coat this. S8 is a bad move. You didn't take e11 earlier, but you should really have taken it here. Even if white still gets E11, having this group run into the middle will mitigate how big the middle can get. I know that group needs some eye shape, but you should find it somewhere a little more active."
baduk,3bo31t,cstoner,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:01:08 2015 UTC,"I think if you cut Q6 or P7 at move 93, the game will be turn pretty much in your favour.  You kill R5 group and attack P9 group to either kill or for profit."
baduk,3bo31t,useless_panda,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:44:24 2015 UTC,Yup you're right.  I stand corrected.  =)
baduk,3bo31t,useless_panda,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:08:57 2015 UTC,"Move 19:  Playing this move says I want to develop on the right!  But the right has very little potential to develop.   I think it would be better to enclose the top left as you have the potential to develop the top.  Move 21:   Pincering here doesn't seem a good idea, you are making a weak group, whilst your stones get to live here and white's stones in the bottom right corner die in the end, white gets to take the left and the lower side, two huge territories. Ultimately this group of stones took more moves to make a profit, white got to play better moves and make more territory. So this lead to a bad exchange for Black.  Move 37:  This extension is too large, white approaches the top left gets a nice solid group then invades the giant extension, after a few moves both the approach stone and the extension stone end up captured, this area ends up becoming whites huge territory.   A smaller extension which was defendable would have allowed black to reduce or even remove white's territory in this area.  Moves 63 - 108:  here white sacrifices the corner, and gets the bottom and left examine the exchanges here and consider how much black is gaining, vs how much white is gaining, blacks moves actually help white to make a nice wall to surround territory, none of black's moves really threaten anything to white, just allow white to fix.  Whenever Black was making territory, he did it at the cost of white making more territory. Black's moves were slower, and whilst black made soild territory that couldn't be invaded, white got to make a lot of potential.  Work on playing less solidly when making territory, if white does attack just know how to deal with it, instead of making it so white can never attack.  Try to ensure you don't play moves that just surround territory like Move 107. Black had Sente but didn't put it to good use, white takes sente and build a nice wall in sente around her huge territory."

baduk,3bo31t,Blade106,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:07:09 2015 UTC,"Move 7, N3 is totally joseki, a modern one at that. Black plays joseki properly, however it was probably bad timing for such a territorial joseki. For reference, the normal continuation is White Q4, Q2, S5, R10, R2, K3. Black has good development on both sides and white has a strong corner. There's still aji on the bottom."
baduk,3bo31t,HelioSeven,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:52:56 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I have never seen that one before. Waltheri confirms that is the widest path after the two space extension, out of a few hundred instances, but without having looked too deeply into it the hane under still seems preferable to me.  Interestingly, the pattern these two played has one exact match on Waltheri, a game between Suzuki Yoshimichi and Lee Ishu in 2012, although the order is slightly different. In that game, white does indeed follow up with a wide 4th line pincer, as I expected."

The fourth line play is a strong reduction of black's huge wall.  51: Good response from black. It would be too slow to build territory directly in the center.  58: A very big point, threatening the invasion at H3. Game seems even at first glance at this stage.  59: Personally, I would prefer to jump out directly without this exchange.  62: White is going for the decisive play it seems.  64: A bit heavy from white.  67: I believe this is the wrong direction, black's wall is at the top. At first glance I would consider O7 instead with the aim to play from the other side.  80: Good sequence from white. The two black stones at the bottom is under pressure and he's moving away from the wall.  84: The tesuji.  93: Result is very favorable for white.  I don't think the play in the mid-game was slow, I believe the result was down to the white invasion on the bottom. It's usually a bit ""meh"" to use big walls just to make territory.  Disclaimer: It's late and I went through the game quickly (plus I'm not that good at this game), please point out if there are any errors in my comments."

baduk,3bilhv,elfeck,7,Mon Jun 29 15:02:24 2015 UTC,"http://eidogo.com/#3ooXIzzgK:0,0  Here's several variations. He was definitely dead, but you just missed some aji that let him live."
baduk,3bilhv,SickWilly,4,Mon Jun 29 15:54:44 2015 UTC,"Some variations: http://eidogo.com/#2rOXcDExr:0,119"
baduk,3bilhv,Zwejhajfa,4,Mon Jun 29 15:55:21 2015 UTC,"There are a number of points where play could have gone differently to allow you to keep him dead, but one of particular interest to you may be B143.  There's an important life and death principle you can learn from this situation: capturing two stones along the edge generally does not make an eye.  As a result, you actually don't have to respond to W142 to limit white to one eye in the corner.  You could use B143 to connect at R8 and eliminate the aji that ended up letting white live.  If white then plays atari at S3, you do not have to connect at T5 and let white live by playing at S2.  You can play S2 yourself immediately.  White then captures at T5, you capture back at T4, and notice that because white only captured two stones along the edge, he hasn't actually gained enough space to have an eye there.  Therefore, he is still dead in the corner."
baduk,3bilhv,arimnaes,4,Mon Jun 29 17:45:56 2015 UTC,"He's dead at move 142, you can tenuki"
baduk,3bilhv,iopq,3,Mon Jun 29 20:06:04 2015 UTC,"I think if you just seal him in in a way that he cannot run or make eyes by threatening your stones, his shape is dead, a L-Group."
baduk,3bilhv,Thuruk,2,Mon Jun 29 15:38:44 2015 UTC,Move 147 was the dying move for black here.  You have to save the three stones in atari right there or else white makes a 2nd eye and lives.
baduk,3bilhv,Tristamwolf,3,Mon Jun 29 16:01:22 2015 UTC,That part is true. But there's a problem if Black connects those 3 stones. Can you see it?
baduk,3bilhv,SickWilly,2,Mon Jun 29 16:12:57 2015 UTC,"I see it now, yeah.  He'd gave to get out there a few moves sooner to be safe and finish the kill"
baduk,3bilhv,Tristamwolf,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:11:29 2015 UTC,"Going back a little further, the problem is that S8 and Q5 are both aimed at protecting the side stones from this problem, but S8 doesn't actually accomplish the goal, and is redundant. Because of the lost tempo, Black ends up being too late.  But backing up further, the problem is that S3 is not needed. If White were to play there, S1 kills. The irony is that S3 turns the three not-connected-at-T5 stones into a liability: when there are only two stones, capturing them does not make an eye (as Black can recapture), but capturing three stones does.  Backing up further, the problem is really all the way back when Black plays T6 instead of connecting solidly at S6. It's just plain bad shape. This kind of ""hanging"" connection is for fights in the middle of the board, specifically where you can't afford to leave any cut at all (because ladders work). Against the edge, it tends to just leave you with, best case, an extra stone in your own territory, as you end up being forced to connect anyway due to ataris from the outside. Worst case, it allows additional attacks, because T7 later becomes an atari.  This is not the only place where Black plays too close/complicated and creates opportunities for White. In fact, even the original ""killing"" move at T3 is not needed (neither is the later connection at T4, although it's a little harder that way) - all that's needed is to protect all the outside stones from being captured. Even if White is allowed to block at S4, two eyes are not possible in the corner - this is something where textbook study is necessary. O5 touches the White stones and makes a target for no reason, later resulting in some pressure around O4; Q8 needlessly permits the cutting point at R8 (White cannot possibly make an eye in this area, and it is not too late to protect P9, if that's the concern). M5 could be at N5 to reduce the complications, too."
baduk,3bilhv,zahlman,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:16:45 2015 UTC,"in my quick glance, it looks like T5 is a move you missed. I'm sure there re better ways, but T5 definitely contributed to your losing. play T5 instead and see how many more options you have!"

baduk,3bhqpn,metaperl,7,Mon Jun 29 09:13:36 2015 UTC,"You made influence in both the lower left and top right but never used it.  Maybe move 29 should have been attacking the weak white stone at C10 forcing it towards black's thickness in the lower left.  Rather white got to make a strong group in response to move 29, and the wall black got to build had no purpose, it couldn't really be used to attack white's strong group.  Moves 93 - 97, whilst Black extends 1 stone at a time, white Plays faster moves that split black, Black gets to connect but white has removed any potential in the middle, the influence in the lower left and top left hasn't achieved anything.  Be aware of just what the value of your played stones is, and also, where your points are coming from.  If you get influence, make sure you get some benefit from it, influence isn't very good at building territory, you need to build it in sente, and you need to make all the walls, and white gets to play a stone everytime you do.  So use it to attack your oppponent, whilst your opponent runs, you get to make some good moves.  And even if you have influence, doesn't mean it can be used, only build influence if you have a plan on how to get a benefit from it."

B 29 N5 seems like it would be sente. B 33 Provokes white to reinforce on the 4th line. Far too kind. B 47 H16 is vastly better. You cover the cut with a ladder, and push along the 4th line. B 55 How does N5 look now? B111 B12 threatens to connect to B15, but also to B8 via a monkey jump."

baduk,3beeii,iAmQuantum,6,Sun Jun 28 13:21:05 2015 UTC,"I think it's a great video for DDK's and SDK's alike. Even if you've been playing go for a long time, it's possible to lose sight of some of these basic guidelines. I'm about 5k, but I feel like this video has improved my performance since I watched it."
baduk,3beeii,Pinkamina_D_Pie,4,Sun Jun 28 16:44:37 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. 5k as well (on KGS though), and I've found this video really useful."
baduk,3beeii,hqrpie,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:43:37 2015 UTC,"As a 6k, I'm thinking I shouldn't watch any more of these. My biggest hurdle is reading, and a series about how to win without reading will probably hurt me in the long run."
baduk,3beeii,sharkweekk,3,Sun Jun 28 19:32:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think its about not reading.  It's about examining the way you play and the way it affects the game.   A pro doesn't read everything out, they read out the important things, not just that, they don't start complicated battles, which then require a lot of reading out.  Everybody has a certain amount of brain resources to play go with, you want to only spend your brain resources where it makes the most effect in the game.   The skill to play solidly with basics, means that you can focus on the really important things, rather than trying to read out everything.  Ratings in go are sqewed, precisely because many people have unbalanced skills in go, many people may know a lot of joseki, because memorisation is easy, they may even be able to read pretty well, but if they haven't mastered the basics, then there will come a point where they will get stuck and not improve.  Part of reading, is knowing what moves are good or likely, and part of that is ensuring you have a solid understanding of the basics of go, studying the basics of connections, haengma, direction of play, etc. will give you better reading skills because you will be able to tell where the next move should be played, and how to deal with it."
baduk,3beeii,hqrpie,2,Mon Jun 29 09:50:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I don't see this video as being about ""not reading"". Reading is absolutely essential. However, one must not forget about the basics, and Dwyrin shows that it's the foundation of solid playing."
baduk,3beeii,sharkweekk,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:27:07 2015 UTC,"The series might not be about not reading, but one of the rules is that he won't read more than a couple moves ahead. I'm assuming he's going to be winning most or all of these games, so for someone like me who has diffuculting finding motivation to do go problems, and who's in game mistakes often come from not reading far enough out, or not reading deeply enough into my groups' weaknesses, I can't help but think that it will motivate me to be lazy to reinforce bad habits and to see how to win without reading."
baduk,3beeii,sharkweekk,2,Mon Jun 29 21:02:42 2015 UTC,Pro's don't start complicated fights? I thought the whole history of post Lee Chang-Ho go was dominated by strong fighters specifically because Lee had trouble with complicated fights (compared to the other aspects of his game).
baduk,3beeii,Thuruk,2,Mon Jun 29 21:06:27 2015 UTC,"I guess you're right then, good luck with your go in the future."
baduk,3beeii,dwyrin,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:52:16 2015 UTC,"I think so too, truthfully. Without reading ability I can't really judge whether a group is in trouble either. It's easier when he does it with his 8D ability working (un)consciously."
baduk,3beeii,Thuruk,5,Sun Jun 28 20:42:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know...That sounds suspiciously like what I mentioned at the start of the video.  That some people believe that there's something else going on with us Dan level players that we're keeping from you in our explanations.  But really, there isn't  Just focusing on direction of play, shape, large moves, etc..."
baduk,3beeii,Ornable_,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:54:06 2015 UTC,"It's just that I spend an undue amount of time on watching lectures, trying to learn basics, reading up on theory when my reading is and has always been so low that I will just mess up the most basic evaluations or fights. Maybe I should rather spend that time doing tsumego until I start losing from lack of heuristics rather than lack of reading."
baduk,3beeii,Hemb,5,Tue Jun 30 11:25:10 2015 UTC,"Reading is important but I got to 6k on KGS on mostly direction of play. I hardly did tsumego before I got to this rank. I don't play often and instead watched a lot of videos talking about what areas to play in. I will admitt that there are many times where I've misread some tactics. However, even now there are more times when I've regreted playing in one area instead of another part of the board. Also, in the video, Batts mostly judged his group based on if he can be cut and if he can be surrounded. So while it's true that you need to read to evaluate your groups, it doesn't have to be as complicated as one might think. Does this mean you should stop doing tsumego? Absolutely not. But it's a good idea to balance your study."
baduk,3beeii,leonprimrose,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:09:34 2015 UTC,"You do use your knowledge throughout this game though, playing joseki and proper moves because they are fundamentally sound.  But it's kind of circular: you know what the proper move is so it is easy for you to zoom to it and justify that it is the proper move.  I think it would be more helpful to focus on what the basics are and how to apply them, rather than focusing on what you aren't doing.  The ""no joseki"" and etc. rules complicate the point, which is focus on fundamentals.  The list on the left side, for instance, could be a list of fundamentals that you keep referring to.  Explain which ones you're focusing on in which positions and why.  When the fundamentals start interacting is when it gets complicated.  By making all this explicit you can really show how these fundamentals work in practice.  That is the hard part for many people, keeping the ideas in mind and knowing which ones to apply when.  Just one opinion.  I really like the idea of focusing on fundamentals."
baduk,3beeii,dwyrin,4,Thu Jul 2 04:14:04 2015 UTC,Its funny. Im around 6 or 7k and this is sorta the way ive been training myself to think for the past month or two in trying to improve. Exactly this. Play simply and strong and just try and be as basic as possible. I came to the conclusion that my problem was overextending and not keeping an eye on weak groups so i have been doing this to learn control and solidarity in my play. i mean i still try to do a little more than the bare bones basics but still  Edit   also funny how similar things happen to me. In kyu ranks you can often just give people enough rope to hang themselves. I try very hard to not kill things. Usually when something dies nowadays its because the killed themselves

baduk,3bajor,mattburnsinchina,3,Sat Jun 27 10:17:15 2015 UTC,"Do you speak Chinese? If you do, then there are tons of clubs in Puxi and a couple in Pudong. I have been to at least 4 different ones in Xujiahui alone! I have been out of Shanghai for 6 months now and no longer have my wechat account with me :/ None of the clubs are actually advertised anywhere, as is usual in China, it's all about guanxi, once you get into one, you get into all of them ;)   Maybe the most accessible of all to a laowai would be the 13 cafe in Jingan. Marc, the owner, is Chinese but speaks very good English and most of people going there are both strong and fluent in English. It's kinda their thing ;) Very nice people anyway. http://site.douban.com/212999/ (乌鲁木齐中路166弄13号)  When I first came to Shanghai ~5 years ago, I actually ended up playing with old people in Fuxing park. Now that summer is there, I'm sure they'll still be there :)  As for other places, like the ones in Xujiahui I mentioned, well... I don't remember the addresses. Maybe the easiest one to find was the one on Nandanlu / Tianyaoqiaolu (xujiahui station), it's inside a big community center building. From Tianyaoqiaolu, going down to Nandanlu, take a left a the crossroad and you should find it (the main door isn't on the street, you have to take a left before finding it). Then you go up, I think it was on the same floor as the ping pong club. OK, that's probably not very helpful, but it's not like there a tons of community center at that crossroad, so if you REALLY look for it, you'll find it ;) I seem to remember they meet on Sunday afternoon, and there is probably always an aiyi in there you can talk to to get more info. The people going to that club also go to all the other Xujiahui club, that's actually how I got started.  There are 2 big clubs in Minhang, one of them meet on Sunday, I think it's the first sunday of each month, at 一诺咖啡馆 (No. 247, Lane 99, Wanding Road), they probably still do, it's an old ass club. The owner, Yao Shen, speaks good English and welcome foreigners, a very nice bunch of people. I think they are 假日围棋社 on Weibo and I may have the email of the guy lying around somewhere if you are interested. It's damn far tho, if you are in the middle of Puxi ;)  As for Pudong... well, there used to be my club, but it died when I moved to Puxi :D There are many strong players in universities and I have been to a few of their clubs. Again, it's all about guanxi, it's not like I could just freely enter an university if I wasn't going with one of the student from there... so it's not very helpful, what I'm saying is that depending on your age and circle of friends, you may be able to just ask them to introduce you to those places, even if they don't go/care for it in anyway. Most big universities have one such group of people meeting to play games, it's not a popular game, but hey, every school has its bunch of unpopular kids, where do you think they go? It's not like they have Magic the Gathering :D"

baduk,3bam7g,metaperl,11,Sat Jun 27 11:00:22 2015 UTC,"It's important to remember that all proverbs and ""rules"" beside the actual rules of the game can be bent and sometimes broken depending on the situation. It's important to understand that just because we don't normally play on the second line that it's always bad and never worth playing.  The move played is a normal probe like move called the submarine and it's purpose is to try and live in the corner or the side depending on how the opponent responds. It's normally played when the opponent is strong in the area the player will normally need to do sabaki to help stabilize it.   Whether or not he won the game was due to other factors than this move, it's possible to make a mistake and win. Your opponent just needs to make more mistakes which are punished by you. :P I wouldn't be so surprised."
baduk,3bam7g,BenzineBro,4,Sat Jun 27 11:09:43 2015 UTC,"It's similar to a 3-3 invasion, except it has more options to go out to the side instead of 100% going into the corner.  Some info here: http://senseis.xmp.net/?4463Enclosure24Approach  Similar in eidogo too: http://eidogo.com/#kjd:pdttjcttqfpb  The eidogo page shows that typically this is done when black has a large extension on the side. Thus white wants to have some presense on the side not just the corner."
baduk,3bam7g,KillerDucky,2,Sat Jun 27 19:19:54 2015 UTC,"I think it might help to consider that the approach at R8 is more or less sente for black. Although the exchange is not yet made, it is reasonable to assume that white will respond at R2.  Once that exchange is made, the resulting N17-Q16-R8 formation looks a lot like a standard 4-4 shimari and extension, where a submarine probe is viable.  As noted in my other comment, it seems to me that whether black goes for the corner or for the outside, he gets a lesser result either way. It looks strange, certainly, but it is not without its own kind of logic."
baduk,3bam7g,HelioSeven,6,Sat Jun 27 21:28:04 2015 UTC,"White should not have played this move in this situation, but it is a normal move in certain situations, where black has support on the side and it's more of an invasion or a probe."
baduk,3bam7g,OmnipotentEntity,5,Sat Jun 27 13:56:53 2015 UTC,"I disagree, it's certainly an unorthodox approach, but I'm hard pressed to find fault with it. If white approaches on B, black blocks with an iron pillar and white is giving away too much territory. If white invades the 3-3 directly, black blocks on the wider side and takes sente to occupy R8. Since black has all the territory so far, white probes with the submarine and black gets a lesser result either way (going for influence or for the corner).  Not what I would play, but seems respectable enough to me."

There has been a lot of play on the top side, adjacent to that corner. If the 4-4 stone had been isolated this 2-4 move would not have been played. It's a move called a submarine, a deep slide with little or no previous stones to support, it which is a kind of invasion. It has some strength because it's open in two directions at once, and so it's able to build a base for eyes in at least one of them (this is an example of miai thinking), and it may also run into the center or some combination of the above. The way this move was played, I'd guess it's a kind of probe.  To understand it, it might help to compare it with its alternatives. Maybe White didn't want to play B as you suggested, because he didn't want Black to respond with a tight pincer? In that situation he would have had two options: invade 3-3 and get sealed in (not good, especially so early), or run towards the center with a weaker base than he had in the game. Running while weaker would mean that Black could harass and threaten the group more to get territory.  I'm not saying that playing at 2-4 was the best move, I haven't analysed the situation very much (and I think I would have played on the open left side instead), but it's not a mistake just because it's on the second line. There could have been perfectly good reasons to play it."
baduk,3bam7g,Phhhhuh,0,Sun Jun 28 23:05:47 2015 UTC,"At the amateur level so many mistakes are made that is really possible to come back from almost any situation.  If this move was a mistake, it's still early enough in the game that white can come back because black WILL make mistakes and white just has to take advantage of them."
baduk,3b81mv,into_lexicons,6,Fri Jun 26 18:42:47 2015 UTC,"You didn't do anything wrong, if it really says you lost by 16 then the program is faulty. If I counted correctly, you should've won by 16 points, could it be you misread GoQuest and it actually gave you the win?"
baduk,3b81mv,flip321,3,Fri Jun 26 18:52:56 2015 UTC,"It must be a faulty result then, it definitely counted it as a loss. Here's the screenshot:  http://i.imgur.com/tEz86uv.jpg"
baduk,3b81mv,show111,6,Fri Jun 26 18:57:52 2015 UTC,It does say that you lose by '-16.0'...could it be that it recorded the win correctly and that this is actually a bug with how it notifies you?
baduk,3b81mv,show111,3,Fri Jun 26 19:06:45 2015 UTC,"The rating system definitely counted it as a loss, too. My rating dropped by 40 points and is now showing 1006."

baduk,3b81mv,NoLemurs,5,Fri Jun 26 19:15:49 2015 UTC,"Lost by -16.0, that's a new one lol!"
baduk,3b81mv,go_virre,3,Fri Jun 26 19:18:37 2015 UTC,"GoQuest's scoring system is usually good, but occasionally buggy. I definitely recommend taking an extra move or two at the end of the game to connect up all your groups - since GoQuest uses Chinese counting, it doesn't cost you any points, and if your stones are all clearly connected up, GoQuest is much less likely to make a mistake.  In this case, I suspect that the weakness /u/ZZZBoson commented on is what confused the system."
baduk,3b81mv,ZZZBoson,3,Sat Jun 27 09:01:45 2015 UTC,"GoQuests documentation recommends connecting up because of score estimator issues (the mentioned weakness) However as GoQuest is 3 min blitz you should also play a server with non-blitz, as another ddk I recommend OGS (KGS level of entry makes it have less new players even if It is a good server)"
baduk,3b81mv,ZZZBoson,5,Sat Jun 27 09:11:15 2015 UTC,"As the others have said, you won that game. However, you left a weakness in your position at the right edge, which GoQuest apparently is too weak to realise. Can you find it?  I really encourage you to keep trying to play against real people or at least a stronger computer opponent. Of course it can be frustrating to lose against stronger players, but I think you will pick up bad habits from playing against such a weak opponent too much."
baduk,3b81mv,BoneHead777,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:39:30 2015 UTC,"Ah, you're right! I should have linked at 8,5 before I passed, so he couldn't atari me against the side. Thank you for pointing that out. Maybe that's what caused the bug?  As far as I know GoQuest is all real players, although you never get any more information on your opponent than just a name and a rating. I'd love to play against stronger opponents to learn more. I feel like there's a wide gap where it's hard to find players on my meager level. I tried about half a dozen games on KGS and got completely mauled. The lowest ranked opponents I could find were in the 15-18 kyu range, and I wasn't able to make even one living group against any of them. Having to resign within 50 moves makes me feel like I haven't learned anything, and I'm sure my opponent feels like I was a waste of time, too."
baduk,3b81mv,Tristamwolf,3,Fri Jun 26 19:49:08 2015 UTC,"I apologize, being unfamiliar with GoQuest I assumed it was an app that lets you play against a computer.  I think it's a good idea to play lots of 9x9 games early on, since it teaches you all the basic tactics and will improve your ability to read ahead (the most important skill at any level imo). Moving on to the big board too soon is a waste of time if you don't know what you are doing in small scale fights. 9x9 gives you much quicker feedback on whether a move was good or not :)"
baduk,3b81mv,BoneHead777,3,Fri Jun 26 20:06:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, I belive GoQuest is all real players, except occasional bots which always have ""bot"" in their name.  I agree with ZZZBoson. GoQuest is a lot of fun, and I use it often when I have a few minutes to kill. But you need more serious venues if you want to really improve."
baduk,3b81mv,4698468973,3,Fri Jun 26 22:21:30 2015 UTC,"Try OGS perhaps, I feel like there are way more weak players there than on any other server. Likely because it looks good and doesn’t require any additional setup so it attracts more newcomers. I prefer it over other servers, so far. As a warning: once you get over the 20k barrier or so, OGS ranks are lower than on most other servers. I’m 16k OGS and 14k KGS, for example."
baduk,3b81mv,ralgrado,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:50:44 2015 UTC,"Actually, OGS is relatively strong compared to other servers at later levels.  According to Sensei's, a 1Dan OGS is roughly equal to a 4Dan KGS, and known Go streamers like Clossius' relative ranks on OGS to KGS actually support that."
baduk,3b81mv,Chariot,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:12:13 2015 UTC,"Yea, that’s what I meant. If you’re rank x on OGS, you’re probably ±3 ranks stronger on KGS"
baduk,3b81mv,4698468973,2,Sat Jun 27 19:39:56 2015 UTC,"I thought at first this might be one of those quirks of Chinese counting, since that's the ruleset you played with, but no, you won under Chinese rules too, by my count.  So that's strange.  BTW, you can play bots on KGS, or try the KGS Teaching Ladder room for games with people who will help you get stronger."
baduk,3b81mv,oren740,3,Fri Jun 26 19:19:39 2015 UTC,Afaik unless Sekis are involved the difference is at most 1 point between chinese and japanese scoring.
baduk,3b81mv,Orc762,5,Fri Jun 26 21:23:17 2015 UTC,"Unless one side plays multiple dame points, which appears to have happened in this game"
baduk,3b81mv,BoatsandJoes,2,Fri Jun 26 23:56:26 2015 UTC,Thanks for this advice! I guess I'll be checking out the teaching ladder since GoQuest seems to have some bugs that need ironing out. Do you know if there's any similar things available on iOS or Android? I do play on mobile a lot.
baduk,3b84u4,sparks314,4,Fri Jun 26 19:06:19 2015 UTC,"That sounds ideal. The reason it would be useful to go over on an actual board is to make sure you are remembering your moves, rather than just blindly clicking ""next"". But 5-10 minutes is an ideal review. If you feel it would be especially useful to review the endgame, it might take longer. If you have 45 minutes, typically it is better to play a new game rather than review; maybe 1 out of 10 or 1 out of 20 games deserve a special review?    I find its easier to go through variations in an editor, but I go through them so quickly, I'm not sure if I'm learning anything from them.   Play on a board. Do the variations in your head. Then play out the main line in the variation to check that you didn't make a mental blunder before returning to your actual game.   What are the big things you look for in reviewing, besides the obvious mistakes?   Main thing is just to replay the game on a board, see how much you remember, see what new ideas hit you as you read through the position on the board. It can be interesting to replay it from the other side of the board if you remember it well enough. If you didn't count in the game, count in the review. If you are focusing on some specific topic in your other studies, focus on that in the review.   Do you review games you've previously reviewed?   It can be a good device to gain perspective to, say, review a 16k game again at 6k to realize how far you've come, but not really. Maybe in an amazing game if I have a new idea the next day, or if I review it once for the benefit of a weaker opponent and once for me; but generally if you are going to put that much time into a game, make it a pro game.   How much time do you spend on a game you lost vs a game you won?   You should spend the exact same amount of time on both. You look for best play for both sides in the game, and then you actually play it out in the review. If you have to chose a game to review, pick a loss, just because you probably, on average, made more mistakes so you're more likely to see one of your typical screw-ups; but more important than a win or a loss is to pick a close game, because there aren't many exciting strategic choices in a landslide. (Although if the landslide resulted from a close fight and a kill, looking at the fight might still be interesting.)  And more important than that is not to try to ""win the review"". Some people seem to strongly prefer to review won games so they can gloat about their own brilliance and ask people to praise them for doing well. Other people prefer to review lost games so they can prove that ""they really should have won"" if it weren't for those meddling go players."
baduk,3b84u4,semraxua,3,Sat Jun 27 01:34:25 2015 UTC,I spend generally 10-20 minutes generally and replay on sgf. I found some of my mistakes by myself. But generally having my game reviewed by some strong players made me realize my moves and effects better. I try to get my every game reviewed by others if they have time and save the sgfs into a folder. I tend to go back and investigate the comments from time to time. They also help me to get a list of things that i would concentrate on in my games like 'safety first'.
baduk,3b84u4,eksert,2,Fri Jun 26 19:30:12 2015 UTC,"It depends for me. I don't review blowouts that are wins for me, but I review (or atleast click through) everything else. I don't spend a ton of time reviewing my own stuff and instead look at dan level games and read books with that time."

baduk,3b60hq,nocashvaluedrumz,2,Fri Jun 26 18:16:22 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of basics/fundamentals that you need to know to progress correctly in go. The reason people hit walls in their improvement is because of a lack of fundamentals. The earlier you start getting lessons the better.  For people in my club I make the following recommendations if they consider it: 1. Make this decision after playing for a few months to get past the ""fad"" stage. 2. Choose a qualified pro, not just a high ranking strong player.  3. Be patient, improvement takes time. It will take at least a year before you see benefits."

Go is a beautiful game, and sometimes we need to take a step back and just appreciate how awesome a board looks with a game in progress. Even in the deadlock of endgame, one can almost get the sense of walking among the stones, meandering through strange twisting corridors of black and white. The stones make a strange rattle with every step. The amber tones of the board poke through the black and white to fill the field of vision with a cool richness that begs the eye to wander. And professional games, with their strong adherence to shape, really do look more beautiful in an almost visceral way."

But its just the worst feeling to draw 4 lands in a row or have to mull to 4 because of no lands. A lot of games add a bit of randomness and being a good player is more about playing odds. Thats fun in its own right but i like things that are purely skill vs skill
baduk,3b5hsb,leonprimrose,6,Fri Jun 26 12:25:08 2015 UTC,"When I was in high school I would play Axis & Allies with my friends. I loved the game and I loved the grand large scale strategy of it. After a game, I'd go home an go on the (dial-up) internet and research strategies, I wanted to get better. Then since it was Axis & Allies and it took a really long time to set up and play, and you needed five people who all wanted to play the same really long board game, we wouldn't play it again for several months. I also learned as some point in my research that there was an optimal strategy that lead to the allies winning large percentage of games. Both these things were rather disappointing to me.   It was also in high school when I first learned about go. I liked the game immediately, and liked to read about it, but not actual strategy stuff. I liked reading about how old the game is and how go endgames were the inspiration for surreal numbers and how computers were no good at it. I liked reading proverbs that I didn't understand because I didn't have enough play experience. I only played against other people that had no real idea of what to actually do in the game, even basics like corner, side, center.   So I wandered my college years, and some post college years like this, getting my strategy fix from Rome: Total War or Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri not realizing that my true love was there in front of me the whole time. It was like a bad romantic comedy, she was beautiful the whole time I just never saw it!   Then I got a go program on a whim and the computer kept beating me. How dare it!? Doesn't it know that computers aren't good at go? So I researched strategy. It was Axis & Allies all over again, except this time I didn't have to wait months for the next game. I could play the computer again right away. Then when I decided it was time to face humans, I could play them right away.  So tldr: I like go because you can always get better, there are mountains of material to help you in that quest to get better and you can always get a game without waiting."

Irc channels are easy to setup and manage ( so easy in fact, that i volunteer to be a mod or even start it ).  I think the main problem with this would be the number of people necessary to make the chat at least semi-active, it might be a good idea to get into contact with the mods of the sub and some other well known go players ."

Good thing about it is that you can access it through your browser ( depending on the server ) or your favorite client, and there are alot of servers  where you can create a channel for free. I usually prefer it because like most people i like to idle in several channels at once. (this is common practice with irc's, so expect alot of people idling )  If you want to make it simple you can try reviving ( guessing that it's dead, not even sure )this subreddit's kgs room ( might be your best shot ), creating a new and improved one would also do."

My big dissatisfaction with online go is that most people don't want to chat. They just silently play and then log off. I would really enjoy getting to know a group of people.  My big problem is that I now live in an area with very poor Internet access, so voice chat is often not possible. IRC would be a great option for me; I hope something like this gets implemented.

In the mean time: Though it's not quite what you're after, I would definitely check out Go streaming on Twitch.tv (BattsGo is a good place to start, his commentary is aimed at slightly stronger players compared to, for example, Nick Sibicky's lectures). And also watching professional games (or at least high-dan amateur games) on KGS and IGS. Twitch and 9-dan server games always pull reasonable crowds (100+ for some amateur games on PandanetIGS, not sure about Twitch) and the chat logs are usually overflowing - they're good places to meet more sociable fellow Go players.

And while I disagree with the conclusion, I do feel like Rym and Scott make a case why Go would not be seen as a good game if it were treated like a designer game in today's market.   At worst, this video summarizes why Go isn't more popular in today's gamer culture, despite being the ultimate strategy game."
baduk,3auzfj,Chariot,27,Tue Jun 23 18:50:08 2015 UTC,"I kind of get their point but I do get frustrated any time people present go as ""remembering patterns"", it's a poor way to explain the game. For example, in chess your first 20-ish moves out of 60 total moves might be literally from a book, and we don't say that chess is a ""pattern"" game. I do agree that go is probably unique in games in that understanding what is even going on takes much more practice though."
baduk,3auzfj,kqr,11,Tue Jun 23 19:28:02 2015 UTC,"Well, in a way, chess is actually more intuitive. Contrast how bad it is to lose a piece in chess and in go. Losing pieces is actually one of the few intuitive feedback paths there are in go, and even so, it tells you very little about how you're doing. Sometimes losing pieces is the greatest thing because your opponent is wasting moves capturing while you gain influence elsewhere. That doesn't happen to the same extent in chess."
baduk,3auzfj,elcubismo,13,Tue Jun 23 22:09:34 2015 UTC,"This is a bit inaccurate. Chess games tend to venture from ""book"" lines well before 20 moves, unless both players are world class and both are willing to venture into that opening and such a depth.  Also, chess is widely regarded as a pattern matching game.  I believe go is pattern matching as well, to an extent. Humans actually can attribute a lot of their intellect to pattern matching because that's how our  brains work. This is why it seems so intuitive for us compared to computers."
baduk,3auzfj,Mefanol,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:04:59 2015 UTC,Probably worth clarifying if we are talking about 20 go moves (20 stones on the board) or 20 chess moves (twenty exchanges of plays).  There is quite the difference there!
baduk,3auzfj,elcubismo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:55:41 2015 UTC,Definitely a difference lol but I was referring to chess and so was the comment I replied to.
baduk,3auzfj,Mefanol,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:23:09 2015 UTC,"Well, I figured you were, but the comment you were replying to might have been thinking 20-ply (10 chess moves).  In a go oriented setting I tend to assume that ""moves"" means ply."
baduk,3auzfj,elcubismo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:13:48 2015 UTC,good point - i meant 20 moves each. even 20-ply is not so common at the tournament level
baduk,3auzfj,Kennen_Rudd,4,Thu Jun 25 14:55:10 2015 UTC,"For example, in chess your first 20-ish moves out of 60 total moves might be literally from a book, and we don't say that chess is a ""pattern"" game.   We probably should, though.  Modern board games tend to include a variable setup to reduce 'scripting' of the opening, and often at least a minor amount of hidden/random information during the game to reduce how far you can theoretically look ahead in the game.  I think Go is a great game mind you. It's basically the benchmark for zero randomness, open information games - if you're making a game with those qualities you'd better make an incredibly good case for not just playing Go instead, because your game is probably more complex with no real justification."
baduk,3auzfj,Chariot,5,Tue Jun 23 23:55:16 2015 UTC,"Another person worded it well in a different comment in this thread. A weak player cannot just memorize a joseki dictionary and suddenly be good. Even if he memorizes a joseki dictionary and a fuseki dictionary and a mid-game book and an endgame book, there's more to the game than just repitition of those patterns we have seen. Sure, we are good at pattern recognition and computers are not so we tend to define our gameplay in that fashion, but the reason we study go problems is to increase our comprehension of situations in go, and this comprehension is more than simple pattern recognition. It is heuristic in nature, but that does not mean it is simply following patterns we have read in a book."
baduk,3auzfj,Kennen_Rudd,6,Wed Jun 24 00:03:14 2015 UTC,No I'm aware of that and they're exaggerating for comedy. They don't even think Go is actually a bad game.  Learning Go isn't just memorising patterns but for a new player who might come here and be told to learn the names of a bunch of stuff and do Tsumego every day it can certainly feel like it is.
baduk,3auzfj,burritoninja007,6,Wed Jun 24 00:14:12 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, I recall an article years back where they did an experiment of seeing how many moves a novice vs a pro can memorize.  First they used classic go patterns, joseki, etc like a plausible game and the pros crushed it.  Then they did it again with completely nonsensical and random moves and the novice did just as well at recalling the order and location of moves as the pro.  I think there is something to be said in exercising pattern recognition in getting stronger, much like muscle memory for a painter or a martial artist.  If you think of go as an art form as well as a game, then your own database of patterns acts as your baseline fundamentals in the same way basketball players don't have to think about how to dribble."
baduk,3auzfj,Ithm,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:24:39 2015 UTC,You should post that article if you can find it.
baduk,3auzfj,Alphapix,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:20:17 2015 UTC,Yeah but josekis and tesujis can repeat themselves a dozen times in a single game. You don't see that in chess.
baduk,3auzfj,eikons,6,Wed Jun 24 05:50:18 2015 UTC,"I understand their point about heuristics very well, although I think they are misunderstanding some basics of go. A 16kyu can't just open a joseki book and get good that way. You still need feedback from the game to learn why things are good or bad. That feedback comes in the form of positional judgment, which is itself a skill you need to learn.  This is where 9x9 games really shine. There's quick feedback, and you'll see why moves are good or bad immediately.  The reason we play 19x19 is because it introduces more complex game mechanics such as influence, moyo and aji. I know that the oldest boards we know of were 17x17, but I'm sure that the game originally started out in even smaller sizes - and people started scaling up to make the game last longer and become less predictable.  If you don't start at 9x9 and (as an outsider) just look at what high level players are doing, it will indeed look like a game with zero feedback."
baduk,3auzfj,FootofGod,7,Tue Jun 23 21:40:54 2015 UTC,"I enjoy the spirit of the talk! It definitely is why GO is so hard to teach. As someone who has taught people for a long time, it's, yeah, frustrating for most people because there's so little feedback and such an unclear path.     Of course, I disagree about the patterns. With understandings of basic shapes and the ability to apply them, GO requires much, much less memorization than a game like chess. That's more appropriate. People have openings and opening traps prepared thoroughly to where there are dozens of seemingly viable branches that simply lead to ""Game Over."" You just have to know they're bad, by either also prepping them or running into them long enough to leave a scar."
baduk,3auzfj,Kennen_Rudd,4,Tue Jun 23 22:21:01 2015 UTC,"Right. They're on the money here, really. It's why Keith Burgun says Go is ""not really made for human consumption"" (one of his many humorously wrong opinions, IMO, but there's a grain of truth there).  Terra Mystica is an example of what a 'modern' Go might look like. After the randomised setup there's zero variance and open information all the way but there's a lot of little mechanisms and feedback loops surrounding the basic ""put a piece on the board"" gameplay. It's not really a good two player game and has a bunch of other design issues I can't stand but is incredibly popular regardless because it's far more attractive and inviting than traditional abstracts.  Tash-Kalar is another modern take on the stones-on-the-board game and is a great game but it's not really an abstract at all considering it has card draw variance and hidden information. Interestingly though a lot of the negative comments you'll see about it that aren't ""it's random"" echo those you might find about Go - dry, super hard to see what's a good move, very spatial, have to memorise a bunch of patterns etc."
baduk,3auzfj,leonprimrose,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:03:03 2015 UTC,I took it as a good explanation of why the game isn't more popular myself. The way he spoke in that video seemed to say more that Go is a great game but does a bad job of making your average person invest into it
baduk,3auzfj,mcsquiggedy,19,Wed Jun 24 13:05:10 2015 UTC,"Go: minutes to learn, but your first thirty games will be absolute defeats that you don't even understand until they're explained to you afterwards.   Go: pure mathematical elegance, until you reach one of several edge cases, in which case it depends on which rules you're using and whether your bowls are weird plastic hexagons.  Go: it's like having a conversation, in a language with only a dozen words that all have completely different meanings based on slight changes in context.  Go: yeah, I guess I forgot to mention ladders...  I wouldn't choose any other game to study, but if Go is deceptively simple, it's a terrible liar."
baduk,3auzfj,trumpetman9,3,Tue Jun 23 19:33:42 2015 UTC,"In regards to your first point, I think that a lot of the misunderstanding comes from the lack of solid pedagogy. I know that a lot of the game is learned through playing (and losing), but I feel that a lot of times players who try to teach the game give new players too much information at once instead of gradually building it. Even the order of information is vital and often overlooked!"
baduk,3auzfj,kqr,4,Wed Jun 24 04:57:43 2015 UTC,"No, they're talking about two people sitting down a rainy afternoon. One of them says, ""Let's play a game!""  The other goes, ""Sure, what game?""  ""I have this Asian strategy game which sounds fun.""  ""Sure!""  And they bring out board and pieces and read the rules.  They plop down pieces.  They have no idea if they're playing good or bad. No idea what so ever.  The only way to know how you're doing when you are a complete beginner is to ask a more experienced player, ""How am I doing?""  The fact that you're assuming a teacher of some sort tells you loads about what kind of game go is. It's not something you figure out with your friends, because it's terrible at teaching you itself. I didn't have a teacher to review my games when I learned to play Monopoly. Nor when I played pretty much any other game. I learn the rules and then I can figure out myself what's good and what's bad. Not so much with go."
baduk,3auzfj,mcsquiggedy,2,Wed Jun 24 06:10:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the situation I had in mind, which I've experienced from both sides, includes a teacher. The difficulty is that there are so many basic things (ladders, false eyes, etc.) that you can learn the boring way or the frustrating way, and you end up with a lot of boredom and/or a lot of frustration.  So far, the best solution I've found is to play a couple games with no strategy whatsoever, just to let the new player get the stones under their fingers. Then I might show them two eyes, and give them false eyes, ladders, and ladder breakers as standalone problems before playing more in earnest.  On the other hand, I learned to play when I was in elementary school, and most of the people I've taught were on the younger side. If you have an exceptionally intelligent or motivated student, it's a much less delicate operation."
baduk,3auzfj,BoneHead777,2,Wed Jun 24 11:09:06 2015 UTC,"I'm teaching my 7yo brother how to play go. Since he luckily isn't too proud to play handicapped games we can play a lot and I sometimes point out things. After I've mentioned a concept a few times he starts to grasp it.   As an example, in his first few games he would often try to save a group in atari in a way that still leaves it in atari, essentially giving me a point for free. Whenever he did that, I showed him and let him take back the stone. Now, he catches it on his own and doesn't do that mistake anymore.   He's still terribly lost during endgame though. I often have to give him tips as to what he could still do since he doesn't quite seem to grasp it yet and tends to pass despite there still being 5 or more unsettled areas on the boars."
baduk,3auzfj,GeekNightsRym,14,Wed Jun 24 18:35:49 2015 UTC,"Haha.  I'm one of the hosts of that lecture.  It's an hour long, and the core conceit is that ALL games (even great games) are bad at SOMETHING.  We riff on a lot of other games that we personally love.  The moral boils down to:   No game is ""bad"" unilaterally.  Games are ""bad at"" something. ALL games are bad at something. Just because a game has a negative quality doesn't mean you can't enjoy it, respect it, play it, etc...   I am hard pressed to think of any game that is literally perfect at all things for all people."
baduk,3auzfj,qwedswerty,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:01:16 2015 UTC,"You definitely have some really good points that I agree with! But some parts are kind of just missing the mark in my opinion. The book reading thing just isn't true. It's true that it requires a huge amount of study and experience playing the game to evaluate positions, though! I have only read one book on evaluating positions, but that book almost had no memorization of patterns etc in it.   It's also not true in my experience that go players only play go. Go players a real often board game geeks, and in the western world it's not uncommon that they have played other board games a lot in the past before trying go, especially chess.   Your comments about immediate feedback loop got me thinking, and the next time I'm showing go to someone I will start with a 5x5 board (super small) to get a more immediate result, I think it will be better. Thank you!"
baduk,3auzfj,GeekNightsRym,2,Wed Jun 24 07:27:07 2015 UTC,"5x5 is how the Go club at my uni ran ""open teaching"" games for people who had never played Go before at non-Go events.  It worked wonderfully to get people into the game!"

baduk,3auzfj,kqr,4,Wed Jun 24 06:17:25 2015 UTC,"Why can't it be both? Seriously. The presentation was humorous, but it does illustrate a problem you need to tackle when making games: how to provide feedback on how well the player is doing."
baduk,3auzfj,hqrpie,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:09:40 2015 UTC,"Well either it's absolutely humorous, and there's not much to argue about, or it really tries to make a point, and then I totally disagree with what is said.  First, it seems obvious to me that no game is perfect or bad. A game should be enjoyed by those who play it, which is a purely subjective matter, and is therefore good at some things and bad at others depending on what the player seeks. If you don't like sweating, football is definitely not a good game.  Second, there is feedback in go ! The question is whether you're good at appreciating the feedback the game gives you. When you begin, the feedback is that you place stones on the board, and you may feel really happy with this. Later on, you'll better understand the feedback, and feel that playing only nobis is not that great. It's the same with capturing stones : you get the feedback that you've just captured a stone, and it's great. Later on, you'll understand that it may not be worth giving up sente. At my very modest level, one kind of feedback that is hard to grasp is thickness. I'm like ""yay, building a wall !"", but I may be wrong doing this, and I'll know that in a couple of years or so :)  Warcraft 3 provides immediate ""feedback"" to the player on how well she's doing : I'm building this, I'm making this amount of money, my hero is level 5, etc. etc. But does it really tell the player if she's in a good position ? Maybe choosing this unit over another was a bad choice which will be made clear later on. Maybe actually, level 5 is not that great at this stage of the game. Etc.  So yeah, go does not provide the player with an indicator saying ""you're ahead !"" or ""you're behind !"" (although one can always count !), but it seems to me that it's the case with a lot of strategy games, is it not ? I think the video tries to say that go is a very complex game, which it is. If you're not looking for a complex game, then go is definitely not for you. But that's just obvious."
baduk,3auzfj,GeekNightsRym,5,Wed Jun 24 11:09:22 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest you read Garfield's ""Characteristics of Games.""  Yes, Go has positional heuristics. But they're extremely non-obvious to a beginner, and often misleading even if they're seen without assistance from a more experienced player.  Go has minimal first-order directional heuristics, and the intuitive ones at that level are flat out wrong (in terms of leading a player to victory).  Chess has a stronger first-order directional heuristic: move toward the enemy king.  It's not a good strategy, but it's better than random strategy, and it's human-intuitive.  It bears more fruit than the first order directional heuristics in Go.  Chess's first-order positional heuristic is also more human-intuitive: captured pieces.  There are fewer pieces to capture, and each piece, especially high value pieces, materially limit your options for play.  While this does technically happen in Go as areas of the board are filled, it's a much slower heuristic loop.  Warcraft 3? That game has shit for positional heuristics, especially simple or early ones.  It's a terrible example."
baduk,3auzfj,hqrpie,0,Wed Jun 24 12:17:24 2015 UTC,"I still don't understand how minimal heuristics makes a game bad. It's just more abstract, and if you don't like it it's absolutely fine. I'm not sure I like chess, for example (I don't like the spirit of it), which, of course, does not make it a bad game. Why should a game have an intuitive/obvious ruleset ?   Now if the point is to say that every game is bad at something (including, apparently, being intuitive), then yeah, it's true, but I fail to see the interest of such an obvious statement. Unless, of course, it's part of a humorous attempt.  As for the ""terrible example"", I'm sure you understand that I was not talking about ""heuristics"", but rather about the ""feedback"". It's true that go's heuristics are not obvious (which, again, I fail to see as a good or bad point)."
baduk,3auzfj,GeekNightsRym,4,Wed Jun 24 12:38:20 2015 UTC,"Did you watch the whole lecture?  We talked about some 30 games.  Every title card was ""X is a bad game.""  The whole point is that Go isn't a bad game. NO ""bad"" game is a ""bad game.""  Games are bad AT things.  Saying a game is ""bad"" because you don't like it is a useless thing to say.  Saying a game is ""bad at teaching novice players how to play"" is an interesting thing that drives discussion.  Notice that we also said CounterStrike, Tribes 2, Racewalking, Dungeons & Dragons, Settlers, and even the PAX Omegathon are ""bad"" games.  Games we love. Games that are (arguably in some cases) bad AT something specific.    We were basically tired of people saying various games were ""bad"" simply because they didn't like those games. The hope is to elevate those conversations to something discussable.  E.g., Settlers is bad at being interesting for skilled players."

baduk,3auzfj,kqr,13,Wed Jun 24 11:11:36 2015 UTC,"This is amusing, and there's a kernel of truth in their conclusion. A lot of Go players really don't play other games seriously. I know there were some Go players who were also nearly pro-level in Shogi (was it Iwamoto?), but they're few and far between.  I've often said that Go is the opposite of chess:   Chess's rules are complicated and arbitrary Go's rules are simple and mostly natural (aside from ko and komi). Once you know the rules of chess, you can apply them fairly easily Once you know the rules of Go, you still have absolutely no idea what to do   That's basically what he's getting at when he says it doesn't teach you how to play. You'd need to be a god to really understand how to play from reading the rules. Even when taught basic principles like eyes (not part of the rules), it's still hard to wrap your head around it.  Then again, I made it to shodan just by playing, certainly not by memorizing books.  Personally, I'd much rather learn by playing than learn by reading. I go to casual game clubs now and then, and when we pick a new game, as often as not we ditch it before we even begin because the rules become so tiresome. I don't want to spend over half an hour just learning how to set up the board..."
baduk,3auzfj,princekamoro,5,Tue Jun 23 19:36:51 2015 UTC,"aside from ko and komi   I agree. I'd argue, however, than even ko and komi are natural. I know some teachers even ask beginners what they would do the first time a ko comes up and most people suggest not allowing repeat positions. It's a natural idea. So is komi, really, even though it took a few thousand years to catch on. Rules like castling and pawn promotion, on the other hand, are entirely arbitrary."

baduk,3auzfj,princekamoro,4,Tue Jun 23 22:12:42 2015 UTC,There used to be a loophole where you could checkmate your opponent with an illegal move. There also used to be a loophole where you could castle vertically.
baduk,3auzfj,gazzawhite,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:04:23 2015 UTC,"There used to be a loophole where you could checkmate your opponent with an illegal move.   Well technically, the loophole was that the move wasn't explicitly stated in the rules to be illegal."
baduk,3auzfj,hqrpie,5,Wed Jun 24 04:16:16 2015 UTC,"What? I thought the loophole was that you couln't challenge the move's legality, because you can only challenge stuff during the game, and checkmate ends the game, along with your chance to challenge stuff. They later added a rule patch that basically says checkmate ends the game if it was done with a legal move."

baduk,3auzfj,kqr,2,Wed Jun 24 12:47:32 2015 UTC,"Any board position in chess where a king (the most valuable piece of the game – the players get one each) is facing unavoidable capture is called a ""checkmate"" position, and it marks the end of the game. The player whose king can not avoid capture loses.  These days, the rules specify that   The player who puts the opponent's king in checkmate has won the game. This immediately ends the game, given that the move that lead to the position was a valid move.   The extra condition on the end wasn't there before, and since the rules stipulate that the validity of moves must be questioned during the game, you could, before the extra condition, technically just plonk a piece down illegally anywhere, as long as it created a checkmate position, and you'd win. The checkmate position, however illegally you ended up with it, terminated the game and therefore any questions about the validity of the move."
baduk,3auzfj,princekamoro,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:32:08 2015 UTC,Sorry I failed to be more specific. I understood this part but my question was more about what kind of illegal move was involved (cf. Ralgrado's comment below) :)  Thanks !
baduk,3auzfj,ralgrado,2,Thu Jun 25 10:03:22 2015 UTC,"Ah, literally any move that ends up in the checkmate position. Probably easiest to accomplish by a piece to an arbitrary place as ralgrado suggested."
baduk,3auzfj,hqrpie,2,Thu Jun 25 10:14:34 2015 UTC,"The first loophole is a combination of two rules: You can only challenge an illegal move while the game is in progress, and checkmate immediately ends the game. If someone mates you with an illegal move, the game is already over, so you can't challenge the move. To patch this, they changed it to checkmate ends the game, provided it was done with a legal move. That way, if the move was illegal, the game is not over and you can still challenge it.  For the castling loophole, one of the conditions for castling was that neither piece involved has moved from their starting location. However a newly promoted rook hasn't moved from its original location, so it can castle with the king, despite being on the opponent's side of the board. They later required both pieces involved to be on the same rank to fix this."
baduk,3auzfj,princekamoro,2,Wed Jun 24 23:34:40 2015 UTC,Illegal in what way? Moving a piece to an arbitrary place or was it something different?

baduk,3auzfj,Tasty_Yogurt,2,Thu Jun 25 10:42:05 2015 UTC,"It's pretty natural for something to be done about the problem of ko, but that something is pretty arbitrary and ultimately seems to be based on what ""feels right"". We have at least 3 or 4 distinctly different variations of ko in use in the world right now, each with its own quirky consequences."
baduk,3auzfj,Maser-kun,2,Tue Jun 23 21:00:48 2015 UTC,"The ""basic ko"" rule is the same everywhere, though."
baduk,3auzfj,Tasty_Yogurt,2,Wed Jun 24 07:18:50 2015 UTC,"The bad thing about komi is that it's very ugly and ad hoc, plus after all these millennia we still don't even know what's an ultimate fair komi value is supposed to be. (But it seems it's always bigger than what we currently think it is.)   There are more elegant ways to balance a game but they didn't catch up in Go."
baduk,3auzfj,Maser-kun,3,Tue Jun 23 22:06:07 2015 UTC,"With the pie rule, the first move will always be a move that divides the board evenly. That means that the first move will never be the strongest move available on the board.  To get the best games, I believe that both players should play the best move at all times. Therefore, having to play a sub optimal first move would feel a bit strange to me."
baduk,3auzfj,fei2id,2,Tue Jun 23 23:41:27 2015 UTC,"If you want to get very technical: the move that ""divides the board equally"" would be the strongest move under those rules (even though it would not claim the most points) because it would be the move that gives you the best chances to win. A standard ""good"" move like a star point would not be strong, because it would give your opponent an advantage.  If you don't want to be very technical: yeah, the first move sure would be ugly. (I wonder which it would normally be?) I guess that's part of the reason the pie rule didn't catch on. Me, I'd rather have the ugliness of the weird first move rather than the ugliness of increasing the score by some strange number that you don't even know to be optimal. Ultimately, it's a matter of taste."
baduk,3auzfj,hikaruzero,2,Tue Jun 23 23:48:35 2015 UTC,"In that case I prefer the ""Use for determining komi in Go"" from your link. One player chooses the komi and the other chooses black or white.  One big advantage of komi is the half point, since it makes draws impossible (apart from eternal life). You could say ""white always wins ties"", though. It would be equal to a 0.5 point komi without needing to actually use komi."
baduk,3auzfj,hqrpie,3,Tue Jun 23 23:57:56 2015 UTC,"I learned a lot from reading go books, none of it is really pattern matching from what is learned. It teaches things like shape and direction of play and broad topics like that. So it is more like a guide of where you should be thinking about moving than pick a pattern and play the right stone. Other than that you need reading skills and to be able to count (or have excellent visual geometry estimation skills) to know how you are really doing in a go game."
baduk,3auzfj,hikaruzero,2,Wed Jun 24 03:54:23 2015 UTC,"Go's rules are simple and mostly natural (aside from ko and komi).   Interestingly, another rule that I've felt is somewhat unnatural is the rule that disallows suicides.  On the one hand, there is a certain advantage to doing so.  It simplifies gameplay a little bit, and you only have to add one rule (""no suicides"") to get that simplification.  On the other hand, Go with suicides is perfectly viable, and is actually even richer in terms of dynamics -- aside from changing the status of some groups (which is a ""one way or the other"" decision), it adds to the number of potential ko threats, so games that allow suicides can have even greater depth and complexity to them.  IMO the key reason why disallowing suicide seems unnatural is because you don't have to add any new rules regarding allowing suicide.  Think about it:  the only case where suicide might be problematic would be the case where it allows infinite repetition (single-stone suicide at the end of the game).  But we already have an infinite repetition rule:  any of the ko rules, which prohibit any move that would recreate the previous board state.  Single-stone suicide would do that, so obviously it would be disallowed anyway.  Even situational superko (which would trivially allow single-stone suicide since the player to move is considered part of the board state) would prevent infinite cycles since you could only make the same suicide move once at most.  So it seems to me that disallowing suicide is just adding one extra rule that limits some of the dynamics of the game arbitrarily.  What do you think?"
baduk,3auzfj,hqrpie,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:27:05 2015 UTC,Isn't suicide just a worse way to pass ?
baduk,3auzfj,qwedswerty,4,Wed Jun 24 06:19:43 2015 UTC,"Isn't suicide just a worse way to pass ?   Not really.  As I mentioned, allowing suicide has two important side-effects:   The status of certain kinds of groups change.  Most groups keep the same status, but some dead groups become seki, and some sekis become either dead or alive. There are now more ko threats on the board, since you can now fill some kinds of eyes.  [Example: if black plays at T19 now, he is immediately captured but now white must play at T19 himself, or on black's next turn black will play there to reduce white's group to one eye.]   Either way, it adds some additional complexity and now players must read just a little deeper to determine the status of groups.  So it's more than just a way to pass."
baduk,3auzfj,taejo,2,Wed Jun 24 11:38:46 2015 UTC,"Yes I understand now, thanks !"
baduk,3auzfj,hqrpie,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:58:27 2015 UTC,"I agreewith the guy above you.   For your question: imagine your opponent having a three space eye and you have already filled two of the spaces and now you need a ko threat. Fill the last space to threaten to kill the group.   I can't think of a way to use to just plainly get a local advantage, though. And if it is only used as ko threats, it's somewhat dumb... Also difficult to keep track of the ko rule and much easier to get into ko loops?   Game design wise, suicide allowed seems like a slam dunk, but maybe there are some practical things that just makes the game much better without it, kind of like how the most popular rule set(s?) have some slightly more complicated rule for dealing with ko than just ""no repeated position""  and bent four in the corner."
baduk,3auzfj,taejo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:11:38 2015 UTC,Usually yes. Sometimes it can be a ko threat.
baduk,3auzfj,hqrpie,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:19:42 2015 UTC,"I think we're not talking about the same thing actually. To me suicide is illegal in go, you can't play it. If you do, then it just implies that you give stones to your opponent, who can play elsewhere.  I think that what you're referring to is self-atari, which is allowed. But maybe I just don't understand what you are saying."
baduk,3auzfj,todeyius,2,Wed Jun 24 10:56:45 2015 UTC,"Nope, I'm talking about suicide. Suicide is legal in some rulesets, and can be a useful move. Sensei's Library gives examples where it can be ko threat and where it is the only move which allows one to win a capturing race."

baduk,3auzfj,Daurak,3,Tue Jun 23 19:18:57 2015 UTC,I do wonder what it would be like to play go on a board that was attached to gnugo and could light up areas that are estimated to go one way or the other.  That could give the sort of feedback they're referring to in other games.
baduk,3auzfj,aletheia27,3,Tue Jun 23 22:18:39 2015 UTC,"I've long thought about doing something like this. There are two ways I see of making machine-assisted go:   Let the machine assist with the ""macro game"". This means it highlights areas that are contested, important areas, areas that are safely yours or your opponents, areas with high aji and so on. After that, it lets you pick a specific move based on that information. Let the machine assist with the ""micro game"". The board is divided into areas based on what's going on, and the machine lets you pick an area, after which the machine will run some simulations and select the best move in the area you picked. The machine selected move can of course be overridden.   The latter is similar to how RTS games work, with the computer providing a basic AI for each unit (if enemy within sight, walk towards it and attack when you are in range) while letting the user completely handle all the larger economic decisions such as which area of the map to put units in, what to put resources into and so on.  I really like the latter idea because it lets the computer do what the computer is good at (brute force with a limited scope) and it would even the playing field between skilled and unskilled player without devaluing the effort the really skilled player has. A really skilled player will probably always be overriding the move the machine picked – and be better off for it – but an unskilled player can still start building intuition about whole-board thinking without being wrecked by miscalculating liberties."
baduk,3auzfj,Phnglui,2,Wed Jun 24 09:01:47 2015 UTC,"That would be an interesting alternative to handicap stones, which can force the more skilled player to make risky, occasionally bad moves to trick the other player into making a mistake.  With a computer to help in the small life and death game, you can see what good moves look like and still have a challenge for both players."
baduk,3auzfj,aletheia27,5,Wed Jun 24 20:59:22 2015 UTC,"Go is simple.  You win by surrounding the most empty spaces.  But you move as fast as your opponent(1 move each turn) so whoever can do it most efficiently, will win.  That is where shape comes from, efficiency.  The more you play the more you utilize different shapes, which every one has a different purpose.    Go feels daunting, and a game only the dedicated should play.  It's ancient, complicated, takes decades to ""master,"" has patterns...  But in the end it is only a grid with markers and just a few rules!  What is complicated about that? You can play for leisure, for work, for friendships, for relationships.  What will you use these lines and circles for?  Let's relate this to War. War in the world has just as much.  Why should we deploy more men, take control of an outpost, invade the bad guys house?  To strengthen those other soldiers, to gain advantage in that area, to pressure the bad guy or use what was taken as bate or ransom.  Should we use a sniper rather than an assault team? It's more efficient and sneaky, but less forceful and strong.  It is a decision that is easier to make the more experience with we have with war.  And we would know because of our experience, not Memorization!  What about civilization? How are civilizations started? With a blank sheet(9x9 to 19x19 grid), with the men you gather(stones) and the resources you collect(empty space surrounded).  How do you use your men for building, farming, and reproducing?  What's your goal? A strong, a producing, a family, and/or a religious civilization? Then you add another civilization into the equation.  She is building at the same time! What is her goal? Does she want to build faster than you(Framework)? Get strong fast to attack and then steal your resources(Moyo then Invasion)? You each have the same amount of time(turns/moves).  Whoever uses their time, resources, and people the best will have the advantage and will get what they want in the end.  Whoever has more practice will know how to do it better.  You can do endless relating to the game!  I use it for my spiritual and personal growth.  How!?  Humans are machines that are really good at relating.  Just as we relate stories to our life, or bicycle card games to board games, or politics to sports, math to nature, I relate my life and structure to Go, and vice versa.  A new player won't understand, a stronger player will.  It is a tool that is to be used, just as a calculator to math, and a sundial to time.  Go is a bad game if you make it one, or a good game if you make it one.  Use it how you wish, don't listen to others if they used it wrong, or don't understand its use.  Hammer or nail gun?  Neither is good or bad.  It just ""is."""
baduk,3auzfj,ProtoJazz,3,Tue Jun 23 20:56:09 2015 UTC,"This actually really bugs me.   Take their settlers example with regards to feedback. I'd argue that recognizing if someone is surrounding a larger space than you is at the same depth as recognizing if someone has more resources than you. If I did something and get a bunch of resources in settlers, that's a good move? I'd argue not really, and anyone who's good at games I'd argue could also disagree with that being a absolute statement. In Go it's nearly identical. I made a move that captured a ton of stones. Good/bad? idk. Ability to say something happened? Almost a pure parallel.   I'd actually praise Go quite a bit because it manages to maintain the same level of depth as other games in terms of interactions while not having nearly as many direct symbols that state that those interactions are happening.   If there's any reason that Go is a bad casual game, it's because:  a) It is much deeper than other games in terms of strategy. b) It takes too long to play compared to other games. c) It's a 2 player game. d) It's not played by casual people.   This really irked me..."
baduk,3auzfj,kqr,3,Wed Jun 24 07:47:37 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that the biggest reason igo is a bad casual game is because it's not intuitive.  It's simple, but there's no real way to describe it by comparison to people who haven't played.  With shogi, you can say, ""Well it's a lot like chess,"" or with Settlers of Catan you can say ""it's a German strategy game,"" and in both instances you can at least have a vague idea of what it's going to be like.  With igo, it's really hard for new players to wrap their minds around territory capture over piece capture, and the fact that the stones never move.  The early game of igo just makes no sense to beginners because you have to predict what the shapes are going to look like instead of reacting to what the shapes are.  There's also the fact that there's no definitive end.  Have you ever actually met a brand new player who knew when a game was over?  When I teach people I usually have to tell them when to stop.  Literally none of it is satisfying, as a player, until you have a satisfactory understanding of the rules, which may not happen until you've played at least ten games.  It takes a lot of investment to even be considered garbage at the game."
baduk,3auzfj,kqr,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:35:41 2015 UTC,"A lot of intuition is related to the paradigms we grow up in. Some of the super satisfying moments for me was figuring out what the most efficient configuration of space is. It's not really a go problem, but a math problem...but was still super satisfying.   Hm... that's an interesting experience. Most of the time, the people I teach who are brand new usually say something like, ""well I guess I have nothing left to play"" or ""I can't do anything now, what should I do?"" That seems like an indication that the games over to me...."

They were talking about watching only the actual game line and figuring out based on that why the pros played the way they did. Which just ain't happening.  As they say, it's just like watching Street Fighter. If someone showed you the alternate sequences in Street Fighter, of course you would see that they turned out worse! But the point is that you get very little feedback at the time the move is played. Bringing in time travel by assuming knowledge of alternate futures changes things entirely. :)"

baduk,3auzfj,fei2id,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:13:28 2015 UTC,"How to count is in the rules of go, thats how games are scored and won. Same with Catan but I understand that you mean knowing what to count is not something easily defined in a rulebook if the game has not ended for Go.  There are also hueristic counts in Catan such as points you can lose and points you will gain and just as in go if you count them and use that in strategy you have a better understanding of the situation as well as a better chance of winning.   The point still remains though that strategy itself is not and cannot be defined as a set of rules and as such all strategy games are in the same category. Thier argument of go being a bad game is really an argument that strategy should not be part of a game or at least to the extent it is in go and that is a terrible way to look at gaming."

I just finished reading the invasions section at the end of Attack & Defense and I'm trying to think about applying those ideas to responding to the invasion that begins on move 55.  It seems like because of white's strength in the bottom right, black is not strong enough to play the diagonal move on move 56.  Perhaps a one-space jump out would have been better, although there's not really anywhere for your stone to run to.  I might have just connected underneath at S12 instead and used that stone to build a wall on the outside, then tried to drive the weak white group at L15 toward the wall.   I'd be interested to hear what stronger players think about this."

So you'll know how to handle those corner approachs and enclosures.   I'd recommend Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go and lots of tsumego (go problems - life an death or tesuji)."
baduk,3avip4,sparks314,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:21:48 2015 UTC,"14, C15 is much better. Completely enclosing corners is almost always good.  17, C15 still pushes through due to your opponent's bad shape.  21, still want to push through.  23, This is the wrong side. We're not worried about black dieing here because he is so large and has easy access to the center, and we can't threaten white as long as he can run out to the side. Hence, we still want to push through.  25, You're starting a leaning attack here.   28, Normally when someone touches your stone do you something more directly to reinforce that stone like iron pillaring (p16) or haning (o18).   33, Getting completely enclosed in the corner is a bad result for you, so you want to come out here with D5.   35 and 37, you're attacking a group that is already alive, so these are end game moves. End game moves shouldn't happen until the life and death status has been decided for every group.  39, D9 is the move that escapes with these stones.  41-49, your position is turning into swiss cheese here while white is keeping his wall solid.  63, don't play moves like 61 unless you plan on defending it when they atari it. The proverb is ""the ponnuki is worth 30 points."" Meaning tossing a stone away like this is much bigger than it looks. You wrecked your own eye space with this sequence, and white has huge influence now.  71, you hurt your own group with this move. You noticed and fixed some of the damage, but you would have been better off not playing 71 and at all.  77, I don't know why you're trying to crawl out with this group. If you were being chased and cornered in real life, would you drop to all 4s and crawl to safety? This should be at H7. If you don't see why that works, it should be at G6.  85, should be at k6.  98, This move is an overplay, you can either cut it off or connect your heavy floating group by playing b5. B6 would kill it unless he wants to start a ko.  101, I hope you read out your corner options before playing elsewhere.  111, if you're gonna reenforce this heavy group this way, you should play j11 first. Otherwise, he can create two cutting points by playing k11.  115, This sort of move is a cap. It says, ""I'm going to limit your potential growth and then run out into the center."" The problem is M9, M12, and M11 make that plan sketchy. You'd be better off with R9. R9 says ""I'm going to make a two space extension in one direction or the other and live.""  137, T11 should be ignored by white.   159, 158 says ""I'm going to kill you in a capturing race."" 159 says, ""I'm not afraid of the capturing race at all. I'm going to throw away liberties to prove it."" Never throw away liberties. S14 is the move that removes the danger of the capturing race.  177, This move is very bad. You're giving a very large very alive group more eyes at the cost of -1 points.  181 is also very bad for the same reasons.  183, o19 is much better here.  185, black doesn't really deserve to live in the corner here. White is too strong. You'd be better off dropping down with M3.  242, Up until this move you could have saved your group with b5."

baduk,3av340,useless_panda,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:20:02 2015 UTC,"I prefer E6 in that position. The black group isn't actually in any danger, so the reduction on the side is a pure points play, in the sense that it swings the points by a certain amount, but has no real impact anywhere else on the board. You can think of it as a big endgame move. There's even a bit of a miai here, as the player that doesn't get the side can take C17, so it's pretty even in any case. One should also consider that E6 reduces the power of the ""iron pillar"" shape at O4 (even though the move itself was a bit of a mistake from white)."

Another was a comment about how a dan level player should be able to fight their way out of a corner somehow, or live (it's been several years, so I don't quite remember what it was saying, and don't care to rummage through to find it). That made me set that as some sort of milestone for becoming a dan player, but as I got stronger (10-15k), I realized that it wasn't a good metric at all. They were basically saying that ""strong players know how to play, and wouldn't get cut when running away.""  ----Conclusion----  Anyways, as you can see, those are very small points relative to the great benefits (imho) an interactive tutorial can have in jumpstarting a person's interest and ability to get through a game. It allows a sort of learning that books/pdfs do not, and isn't at all tedious (in my experience, as well as some of my friends') to go through. I highly recommend it."

baduk,3alj8g,eksert,3,Sun Jun 21 11:43:20 2015 UTC,"My thoughts below -  6: Really passive from white, it's rare to go for 6 moves without an approach.  13: Agree with your comment, it's vital to keep white separated.  14: I prefer B over A in your comment. It's better for the surrounding stones to be strong when playing a severe move. In this case, it's a little early to be attacking the group directly.  19: Move played is correct, white is in big trouble with two weak groups under attack.  23: Q3 puts more pressure on white.  25: I would prefer L14. J15 is a bit iffy, notice if you played L14 now, J15 would be considered too close to the thickness.  27: Wrong side, and not quite the right idea I think. You want to take advantage of white's overplay by strengthening the L15 and O12 groups. White is giving black a chance to give L15 an out into the center. With the way the game has progressed, F17 is not so important and black can always settle there easily by taking 3-3.  31: It's important to keep going into the center. It seems black got intimidated here.  33: L14 is much better.  35: Big mistake, black has to keep white separated. I would say this move is a consequence of not having an overall plan in the game. It's important to recognize that attacking the two white groups is key.  39: B18 is the standard shape.  40: The correct punishment from white.  42: White connects one group easily.  43: Does quite work, and too small even if it does. Again, need to have that overall plan and play accordingly.  45: Wrong direction, black needs to consider the safety of the corner group.  56: Perhaps biggest result of top left play is that white gets sente to come back to the important part of the game.  57: Too small, white connects easily.  60: Good decision from white, this helps P9 a lot. Both white groups are now safe and the game is decided in my opinion.  Looking back at my own comments, it seems a bit harsh, but you played quite well. You put white in a lot of trouble up until move 25, but then it seems your attention got shifted to the top left instead of the powerful attack you had started. It's important to not play by the seat of your pants and have an overall plan, then play according to it."

baduk,3ai9yi,ProoM,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:23:29 2015 UTC,"1) Seems like an even game with fair result for both, would even prefer white slightly because  black's J5 is not doing too much at the moment. In the game, black could've gained an advantageous situation, had he played out the sequence correctly (normal sequence after P2 was bQ2, wP3, bQ3, wM3). Compare that to wO3,  bP2, wO4, bQ6, wL3. Clearly the second sequence is much better for white. Also, keep in mind that you're invading black's area - of course you're not going to have a lot of territory and a huge success over there. The key point is to have a strong group that your opponent can not attack easily.    2) It's just a shape problem rather than some sequence, but if you want a plausible sequence, lets say after wP10, bP8 (which is wrong because Black's side is small and he's making a weak group), wR15, bQ14, wN11 etc. Result: white gets corner (black can't invade with weak group around) and white gets center influence and reduces black's influence"

baduk,3ahf80,Areign,4,Sat Jun 20 05:14:32 2015 UTC,"Don't atari at crosscut.  You could have kept extending along the fourth line instead of hane'ing again.  For joseki, you should have hane'd his attachment (Q14) and proceeded from there (but your sequence was fine, until your second hane)."
baduk,3ahf80,anon445,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:22:26 2015 UTC,"thanks for those answers, it mostly mirrors my analysis, except for the not atari'ing at cross cuts, i'll keep that in mind, though i dont think it would help here.  is there any kind of rule that i should look for when to hane? i really thought 2 would be fine, do i just need to read it out?"
baduk,3ahf80,revolvingdoor12,4,Sat Jun 20 06:18:38 2015 UTC,"Just to confirm here, anon445 isn't saying don't atari ANY cross cut - he's just saying on this occasion it does not work. Careful reading (beyond 1 or 2 moves) is always key. In fact Black S12 was a risky (over)play - he could have killed your two stones without descending to the 2nd line. (Risky because he gave you a move to possibly salvage your stones by connecting)."
baduk,3ahf80,anon445,2,Sat Jun 20 06:25:08 2015 UTC,"I'm saying, as a general rule, don't atari at a crosscut. After the second hane, he cut, and you immediately atari'd (the wrong direction, if anything). It's usually much safer and correct to extend the weaker stone, or protect the weaker group.  Hane at the head of two stones is good (which is what you did both times), but every rule still requires reading to be justified. The second hane might be valid (might even be the best move), but you would have to read out variations and use your best judgment as to the ideal course of action."
baduk,3ahf80,demonarchist,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:35:03 2015 UTC,"In this situation hane was too much. Just extending along the fourth line was surely good enough, especially so given that (a) Black was pushing from behind and (b) you were effectively erasing the most fruitful option of his bottom shimari (to extend upwards).   If the situation was reversed and YOU had a shimari at the bottom, then you could consider the second hane. You would want to open up as wide as possible. Even better, bend around Black immediately when he attaches.   Note that Black's choice of joseki was bad. If you have a shimari in one corner and are deliberating how to answer a  approach in the corner facing them, a pincer is almost always a good option."
baduk,3ahf80,BulletD0dger,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:50:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I basically filed this away at this point under really greedy or alternatively needed to read it better.   It's the first time I've come across a cross cut being so effective so I think I'll be more wary."
baduk,3ahf80,ProoM,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:48:04 2015 UTC,"The attachment is a valid response (depending on the position) to the 3-4 low approach and leads to joseki, one you should study and see what positions white and black end up with. You should not immediately be thinking this is overplay, how do I punish.  http://eidogo.com/?id=xIamEXAn:0,0#19hqkGBwG:0,0 In this position black seems to have covered much space and he can tenuki. You approached the corner and this usually means you will not walk away with sente since black will want to respond with a joseki that will allow him to have sente. However, in this joseki, if black finds the top imporant and wants to secure his group, he will need another move, giving you sente. Otherwise, there is a ton of aji in black's group for you to exploit now or later.   I remember in Sibicky's video about the 9 responses to the keima approach to a 4-4 stone, the attachment joseki is a very strong play in handicap games and leads to the same shape you see here but the stones are moved over a line.  Hope this helps."
baduk,3ahf80,qwedswerty,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:03:06 2015 UTC,"Ok, I just assumed it was bad because again, sibicky mentions as much in some of his videos, I haven't gone through all his videos yet and have kind of skipped the joseki ones because I feel like at 16k it seems more important to focus on reading and tesuji.  The sad part is that every game I play against 15-17k players, I manage to missplay horribly multiple times and still win by like 15 points because I'm better at setting the bigger part of the board. I feel like no one ever tenukis. (Though in this match I played stupidly one too many times and lose a massive group).  Anyway thanks for your help."
baduk,3ahf80,qwedswerty,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:44:19 2015 UTC,"Well, too be honest, P12 hane was way way too agressive and left too many cutting points. If you can read that you can get away with playing it (e.g. deal with a cut in a good way) - Great! If not- don't play it. Q12 or Q11 were normal moves in this case."
baduk,3ahaa4,princekamoro,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:17:21 2015 UTC,"First game, move 39. You're saving stones that aren't important. Worse than that you're creating two weak groups. Move 42, your opponent is helping you, he wants to spend two moves to take 3 points instead of attacking a weak group. Move 43, oh, honey, you need to give up that one stone and strengthen your group with J6.  Second game, move 6. Responding to the 3-3 is the biggest move on the board no contest. The thickness you get from the typical invasion joseki is great on an open board. Move ten black is a lot stronger than you locally, so don't hane just extend. move 22, I'd prefer to approach at O3, or if you want to make an extension, make a 5 space extension to make a Chinese-like formation.  Third game, move 17, it's too early to start running these stones out. By move 35, you have hurt your corner and have a somewhat weak group between 2 strong opponent's groups. This is like the mistake in game 1 but not as bad. Move 73 what is this shape? It's an extension that your opponent already peeped. Did you read out what would happen if your opponent did the obvious? This might have been a good time to invade in the C16 area.  Fourth game, move 19 that stone is weak, don't help it get strength by attaching to it. Move 45, I'm pretty sure Q1 wins the capturing race. Move 65, this invasion hurts your side. Move 101, Q15 to secure your corner and keep the pressure up on white to make eyes. 179 Ignore the atari, play D18 and when white takes connect with E19."
baduk,3ahaa4,sharkweekk,2,Sat Jun 20 09:04:41 2015 UTC,"General notes: you don't have to save every stone. If you're playing a move to save a stone or group of stones, ask what they're doing first. If they are cutting stones, or breaking up a large opponent's territory, or involved with the life and death of other groups then it might be worth saving them, otherwise, leave it until the endgame. Proverb  You like to play the joseki that starts 4-4, approach, extend, invade. This is an fine joseki in the right situation, but it weakens the original approach stone dramatically. Combine this with your immediate compulsion to then save that stone and it can lead to catastrophe. You play the invasion when you can treat the original approach stone lightly or when it's gotten strong enough that it's not hurt much by being close to a wall."
baduk,3ahaa4,sharkweekk,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:14:23 2015 UTC,"Here, I reviewed 2150908: http://eidogo.com/#Evvfs8ex:0,0  I'm ~9k on OGS, so there are plenty of stronger players that can give you a better game review. In the meantime, here are the three major points I'd encourage you to work on:   Play the biggest move. I think this is your biggest problem right now, you played so many small, slow, or useless moves in the beginning that you were way behind early on. Don't attack to kill, attack to make your opponent live small (while you profit from it). This is something that all DDK and most SDK players need to work on, it's often better to attack from a distance and threaten to kill, while making points for yourself or improving your position, than to jump right in to an opponent's group and try to kill it. With, of course, the one exception that if you've done lots of tsumego and you've read out the entire sequence and you can kill your opponent's group by playing inside it or attacking it directly, and it makes sense to kill it relative to the whole board, then go ahead and kill it. But, for a while, try to just force your opponents to live small. Every time my opponent ends up with a huge 50-stone dragon on the board that lives with three points, I'm having a good game. Don't peep. Seriously, play twenty or so games without peeping. You're developing a bad habit, peeping when it doesn't gain you anything. For the next twenty games, if you're about to play a peep, don't. Find a different move to play instead. There are good times to peep, but you don't know what those are yet, partly because you're not looking hard enough for better moves."
baduk,3ahaa4,4698468973,2,Sat Jun 20 09:51:31 2015 UTC,"I added to your commentary here. I'm 8k AGA (probably low, we'll see in August) and have held 6k on KGS while I still played there actively. Overall, I think you're generally correct and just fixing this stuff will be a big help for a DDK.  Jumping into the corner on move 9 wasn't a great move, but what killed this game was the total inconsistency regarding that move. Having jumped into the corner, black should be happy with the corner and not try to have the outside as well. If black didn't want to live small in the corner while white gained influence, black should not have played that way."

As long as they're just letters you won't remember what they mean, but when you can apply them to things happening in your games they'll be much easier to remember."
baduk,3afw0x,Areign,2,Fri Jun 19 20:45:12 2015 UTC,"Just ask, that's normally the easiest way to figure out what something means.  Joseki - A set of standard local moves typically used in the opening, which give acceptably equal results to both players.  There are thousands of these, so don't try to memorize every one of them, but memorizing a few is important.  Fuseki:  Common large-scale opening patterns.  There are a decent number of these as well, but far fewer than Joseki.  Learning these becomes useful over time."
baduk,3afw0x,sparks314,2,Sat Jun 20 02:52:16 2015 UTC,i would recommend watching things on youtube and looking up the terminology when you see it on senseis library
baduk,3afw0x,Areign,2,Tue Jun 23 17:49:18 2015 UTC,"Go Books (both recommended)  Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go (Great overall book that you'll read multiple times)  Opening Theory Made Easy (Great for DDK on openings)  Sensei's library (http://senseis.xmp.net/?FusekiPages)  Play games online. Once you see a new opening, check it out after the game. Once you see an opening that didn't work very well, check out how to use that opening on sensei's library or josekipedia  Professional games are a good source to learn many openings and how players utilize their strengths (check out go4go.net, free but you have to sign up)  YouTube. leonprimrose's suggestion - Nick Sibicky and some of the others on youtube have great videos. I enjoy dwyrin's videos, though they're aimed at a little bit higher kyu.  For vocab, sensei's library explains a lot, and has a lot of great advice. Plus, you can wiki-surf. ;)"

I've been told that by many dans that if I can't read the solution in a minute to keep going back and starting over until my reading improves but at this rate, it's going to take me forever to finish this volume. And since it's feedback friday, all I have to say it that you've been doing an awesome job and to keep at it. I know this may seem like more work, but I think 2 different problem might be necessary, one geared towards the 20-15k and another for like 15k-5k range. Sorry mr. dan players but for you guys to be at your ranks I'm assuming you do your necessary tsumego regardless. I know graded also has fuseki problems, maybe do one fuseki and the other regular L&D?"

Go back to volume 2! Anyone who can solve the hardest problems in volume 3 quickly and accurately (<30s/problem, 95% correct) is damn near dan level. Volume 4 is actually fine practice for low level dan players.  You really can't go wrong by doing too many easy problems.  Another suggestion instead. If you're stalling on Graded Go Problems, maybe switch to Cho Chikun's Encyclopedia for a bit, and start at the beginning with those.  Again, you really can't go wrong by doing too many easy problems, but it's very easy to waste a lot of time doing problems that are too hard to really gain much practical advantage."

Just finished Earth Awakens). But generally they're right. I'm not dan level but typically reading efficiency improves reading depth better and faster than just trying to read more and further. I usually focus on problems about 5ish stones below my play strength so that I just hammer in pattern after pattern and situation after situation. We're building an encyclopedia in our head. Better to have a larger encyclopedia than otherwise.  Thank you for the kind words :) I've considered that several times actually. I would need more book sources to pull from though in order to do that. It's not so bad to keep up with 1 per day but 2 would be twice the work even with the stuff I need. That's why I thought about the once a week beginner problem to give a small amount more variety. Maybe instead, I keep what I'm doing and look for a challenge problem once a week. Once I get some higher level tsumego books lol  It's a work in progress :P  I also considered the fuseki idea but I felt it was too theoretical. What good this type of series is best for is local reading. Especially at weaker sdk and ddk strengths. Players like us need to follow Lee Changho a little bit more in order to improve I think. Mid game is where dan level players are made!"

Gocommentary's videos kind of utilizes this style. Of course there is only one correct answer in the end, but the discussion as to why this is right and those are wrong would be very helpful for fuseki/mid-game postions. I know these are probably difficult to find, but this could be fun. This is the setback with tsumego/tesuji, you can't really promote a discussion.

baduk,3a8u21,anon445,2,Thu Jun 18 03:34:53 2015 UTC,"My count has the game at roughly 96 for white to 85 for black. Assuming there are no captures or komi, you need to give up fewer than 6 points to win the game -- and I don't see a way to do that. Your smallest sacrifice looks like the three stones at B5 and that's too many points to give up.  Maaybe you can give up the three stones at B5 (block at F7, B C6 atari, W E7 connect, black has to extend to B6 because connecting at C7 doesn't work, white D8 atari because the C7 atari induces black to crawl along the bottom... etc.), and then if you can get sente from the fight, play F12 and see if you can reduce enough from that move to make it a game again (because black can't block at F13) ... but you'd still have to play a flawless endgame.  Probably the right answer is that black's F6 is a winning move no matter what your response is, so you had to see that and fix it before this point.  edit: obtw, post your games to something like eidogo.com if you can so that it's easier for people to play around with variations."

Even when you're confident you've lost the game, its important to continue playing out, because there are sequences that come up. Also, its fairly easy close to end game to pick up a lot of points, especially as new players. Once you've played through a couple hundred games, and know what to expect, you can consider resigning early. Until then, my advice would be to play through each game."
baduk,3a4bwr,sparks314,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:44:34 2015 UTC,I believe his question was about if it's time to start counting. And the answer is no!
baduk,3a4bwr,qwedswerty,4,Wed Jun 24 22:58:57 2015 UTC,"I have made a few annotations: https://imgur.com/nUOAxSx  If it is black's turn, s/he should play at A, and capture the white group immediately above it.  If it is white's turn, s/he should play at B and capture the black group below/around it.  Black can also play at C, forcing white to play 2 spots to the left of C (otherwise white will lose that one stone). Notice that white cannot play at C because this would put BOTH his/her stones into atari.  There is still room to move at the points marked X. If black had both of those points, s/he would have one additional point of territory. If it is black's turn, he should play the top X because it puts white's 3 stones across the top in atari. White then must connect along the top (otherwise black will capture those three stones next turn), and then black gets to play at the other X point, securing that one extra point of territory.  Finally, someone still has to play in the bottom-right corner as white's single stone near then can still be taken. If it is black's turn, he could play in the corner and then white cannot immediately recapture that corner stone because of the Ko rule. White would have to play somewhere else, and then black can play where that white stone was so that his corner stone won't be captured next turn.    As a thought experiment, let's alter the board slightly. Say white has a stone at A and black has a stone at B, and it's black's turn first.  Black: Top X  White: connect across the top to save his stones  Black: Other X  White: Bottom right  Black: C  White: Two spaces left of C    Now let's say it's white's turn first.  White: Top X  Black: Other X (to avoid capture)  White: Notice white can't play in the spot below the Top X or s/he will be captured when black plays in that gap on the top line. So s/he plays bottom-right instead.  Black: C  White: Two spots left of C to avoid capture  Black: Spot below the Top X  There are a few longer interesting variations if white plays the Left X first, but I'll leave those to you ;)."
baduk,3a4bwr,revolvingdoor12,4,Wed Jun 17 07:47:40 2015 UTC,I would strongly advise you to start playing on a 9x9 board. You probably could've play 5-10 games on a 9x9 board in the same time you played this game. Is this a game on a 13x13 board but played on a 19x19 board?  When you start playing go most (if not all) people play local moves most of the time so there is no big difference if you play a 9x9 board or 19x19 except that you need a lot more moves on the bigger board to finish the game.  For the scoring issue maybe go to KGS there should be a beginner room somewhere and ask for a game in chat and that you want to have scoring explained to you and how it would work in real life.
baduk,3a4bwr,ralgrado,3,Wed Jun 17 11:35:43 2015 UTC,"In the lower right, there is a white group of four stones in atari that itself puts a black group of 5 stones in atari. Whoever plays first can get a lot of points.  And in the upper right white can still push a bit."
baduk,3a4bwr,Thuruk,2,Wed Jun 17 03:21:07 2015 UTC,"If you aren't sure if it was worth finishing, then it was worth finishing. When the game isn't worth finishing, you'll know it :)"
baduk,3a4bwr,davou,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:32:15 2015 UTC,Link to the scoring rules you asked for.
baduk,3a4bwr,useless_panda,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:21:02 2015 UTC,"The short answer to your question is: since you are still learning the basics, you should play to the end.  The slightly less short answer is: W is well over a 100 points ahead here. In a game between 'more advanced' players, as you put it, then I would say black should resign.  On a side note, others have mentioned the stones in atari in the center. Playing there first is certainly big (about a 20 point swing in the game), but I think playing in the bottom right corner is still worth more. If W plays R5, that's worth about 20 points right there, and the end game moves W gains are worth even more."
baduk,3a4u25,hunterkane6,2,Wed Jun 17 06:07:32 2015 UTC,"There are two things that you might want to work on.  First, learn about sente and gote. What you want to do, is to play sente moves first, then play a big gote move. In this game, in the endgame you again and again played very small, very slow gote moves while there still were sente moves on the board. Once you learn to recognize sente moves and look for them, you will instantly improve very much, I'm sure of it.  Second, you did a very strange thing that many other new players do. You waited until there were (almost) no more endgame moves, until both players completely solidified their territory and then you played the 3-3 invasion. You absolutely did not deserve to live there. The opponent messed up, you deserved to die. (OK, maybe not the best choice of words there.) If you ever intend to play the 3-3 invasion (or any invasion, really), don't wait until the very end of the game. Play it while the position is still vulnerable, while there's still aji. I am not sure when was the perfect time to play that 3-3 in this game, but you easily could have played it at around move 124, maybe earlier.   There were other simple errors, strange joseki choices. (Look at moves 166, 126, 178.) I think the most important thing for you will be to learn about sente and gote, though."
baduk,3a4u25,Tasty_Yogurt,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:20:42 2015 UTC,"I think this is why you should play against much stronger opponents sometimes.

baduk,3a4u25,Thuruk,2,Wed Jun 17 12:59:15 2015 UTC,"Well, that's true, but on the other hand the stronger player will be able to do that exact thing to you: play something that should not work and get away with it, making you think that their overplay was a legitimate thing.

baduk,3a4u25,Tasty_Yogurt,2,Wed Jun 17 13:24:28 2015 UTC,"I want to play against stronger players but there are few that want to play against DDK. I also feel that I need to learn how to punish overplays and bad moves before I start playing better players. I might be good at playing people who make good move choices as they make sense. But playing against weaker players who make moves that I don't understand and I don't know how to punish them. At that point I might seem strong, but only against strong players. If that makes sense."
baduk,3a4u25,Tasty_Yogurt,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:39:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I have been trying to notice sente more often though i'm not too good at it yet as I dont know what moves might be sente. Other than those moves on the first line when solidifying territory and you can tell which moves you will need to fix or not, leading to sente. Do you know of any good resorces for learning sente and gote?  I fully expected to die in that 3-3 invasion. It was quite the jerk move for me to even attempt to play it. I just saw that it was possible to cut off that group and he missed it.   I also have not looked into joseki at all. That would be why those moves look weird. I don't know when would be a good time to start studying joseki. I felt I should get stronger before I focused on joseki, maybe i'm wrong."

baduk,3a06nc,Orc762,6,Tue Jun 16 05:00:07 2015 UTC,"It is a well-known phenomenon in competitive gaming, referred to as ""going on tilt."" It's when you become frustrated and start snowballing (in the bad way). Generally, it's about becoming annoyed while playing the game, but it includes any sort of negativity that affects a player's skill and causes them to continue playing worse and worse.  And with a turn-based strategy game like Go, it's effects are probably more significant because frustration generally leads to anger, which leads to aggression and recklessness. This is a more viable strategy in real-time games, such as call of duty or a MOBA, but in Go, you need to be calm and calculating to play your best."
baduk,3a06nc,anon445,4,Tue Jun 16 05:25:52 2015 UTC,Get mad - go hyper agressive and die in lane - blame the jungler.  It is known.

Does nothing to help team play and simply accelerates the snowball.   At least in go, I can take time and calm myself and regroup with no one to kick me."

baduk,3a06nc,FarodinAngels,3,Tue Jun 16 05:10:04 2015 UTC,"The healthiest thing to do is to learn to get rid of ""bad days"" altogether. What I'm about to explain can apply to Go, but it can apply to anything in life.   Negative stuff happens to everyone all the time. Of course, you can't control your environment so that nothing negative ever happens to you. However, if you realise that negative experiences can lead to negative thoughts, and that negative thoughts can give rise to negative emotions, you start to have some options.   The general answer is 'mindfulness', being able to control and judge your thoughts, while maintaining full control over how they affect your emotional state. It may sound like some vague Buddhist thing that doesn't belong in Western society, but the benefits of it are enormous. And no, it's nothing like brainwashing, it's actually the complete opposite. The jist of it is that you ""train"" (yes, it takes rigourous practice) your mind to stop thinking whenever a negative thought arises. What constitutes a ""negative"" thought is something that you have to learn to see for yourself, although good guidelines exist. For example, the main reason why people are bored is because they're thinking about what they'd rather be doing, instead of focusing on what they're doing right now. These ""if only"" type of thoughts are usually completely useless and should be kicked from your mind as soon as you notice them.   Anyway, there are people/books/webpages that explain it a lot better than I do. I've been doing this for a couple of years, and nowadays there is very little that can actually put me in a bad mood."

Especially, I recommend just stepping back from the game for a moment or two.  If I am getti g stressed over Go, I go play splatoon or some other game that requires less brainpower.  If IRL is the issue, well for me go is my place to relax, but if it's not yours, go to whatever helps you relax and save Go for later"

I know you are 15kyu, so I think you should read some go book, reviewing games is always good, but I think you first need to understand better the game before reviewing games such like this. If you read some books first, you'll understand better what's going on (or why your moves are bad or good). So my books suggestions are:   Basic Techniques of GO - Start with this one! Direction of Play - Then read this one!   After you've read this, I'm SURE you'll be at least 5kyu, probably even better. But of course, you must understand them. Start reviewing your games with the things you learned in mind. Here is a torrent with these books and much MUCH more: Go Education Collection)  I know I haven't really answered what you've asked for, but I am sure, I mean really really REALLY sure you'll get better very fast after reading these and understanding them.

You actually did pretty good tactically (not sure about strategically).  Was this a blitz game?  Anyways the main take-away thing is you let him make lots of thickness and then you proceed to play near the thickness.  That will give you a hard time and require much more reading.  Even tho black made more mistakes, you probably had a much harder time to read.  Play away from thickness!  Cheers."
baduk,39zdvp,useless_panda,2,Tue Jun 16 08:39:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for all your comments! My main fear is that I also like playing for influence because I've seen how a territory-focused player can lose because of central moyos created by influence. Thus my first reaction to influence is to try to prevent it, which clearly doesn't work. I might need to adjust to play for a better balance of territory rather than just try and get all the influence..."
baduk,39zdvp,DoitiEtok,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:38:20 2015 UTC,Yeah I think you played pretty good and made full use of the mistakes black made.  If you have more time you probably won that match.  Definitely check out the stuff brunodea suggested though.

baduk,39ubzg,sphaso,2,Mon Jun 15 14:57:45 2015 UTC,"Well, if you have chosen to let your browser remember passwords for example. It will autofill the form with the password and huzzah. Or you could just trick user in to filling the login form himself and capture the result. Or just use the existing session and run commands unbeknownst to the user on the server.

If, at the start of the game, I only want every stone to live, I can do that.  If, at the start of the game, I only want every stone to live, I can do that.  Stones are really hard to kill. They die, sure, but it's because we start asking them to do multiple things: live and make territory, live and cut, or live and kill. Maybe we want them to live and to not inconvenience us with a move for a while.  Good go is about leveraging the threat to kill as a weapon to do something else. And if they goof, all the better.  Stones that run don't make points. Stones that merely live can end up earning only two. Stones that attack, or secure profit, those are the stones that win the game.

However, I play so that I don't have to kill. Not to mention, a small proverb I learned from a teacher on KGS:  Killing is often gote."
baduk,39toyx,eksert,2,Sun Jun 14 17:57:37 2015 UTC,"Sure let's look.  Move 11 Don't play close to strength! Just solidify top corner with N17 and you're fine.  Move 13 here we can see that you've covered a lot of board, and your opponent played really solid. That's great so far.  Move 15 as your opponent is really enclosed in his corners, I'd think about Q14, so I can build big moyo on top. Your move is text book one, and its fine. just dropping ideas.  Move 19 book like play  Move 21 Here i'd disagree. You have weak formation in upper left and in bottom right corner. I'd just secure one hole. #20 makes your right corner weaker, so maybe secure there first?  Move 33 you got some points on side, but now your #21 is in weird spot, and your opponent got a lot of strength. That's a bad result, I'd definitely fight here and start with R8 or R10 at move 23.  Also in your variation with #33 you could cut white, instead of connecting under, couldn't you?  Move 35 Why do you play there? There is nothing there to gain, don't blindly answer opponent moves! Playing here is not urgent, what can white do there? Cut you out? The center is wide and open! Connect under? Didn't he in your variation? That is really important moment when you can shape the flow of the game, this is really important to identify moves like that and take initiative.  Let's look how board looks right now: White has: 12 points UL corner 22 points in BL corner 4 points right side some strength  Black has:  23 points in LR corner Perspectives on top  Fate of the game depends on how top will turn out. That's the place to play, not some small lower side. What are the moves there?   S15 - secure corner M16 - secure side F15 - secure side, get effect on center E18 - secure side, get better endgame   I think all these moves are fine, and it depends on style. If someone has strong preference about these moves, then tell me!  Move 47: Your variation gave you some strength to the center, but that wont give you any points, really that's worth nothing. It's better to leave places like that open for later, important things like top should be played first!  Move 49: Look at analysis above.  Move 55: Waste of initiative! Top!  Ok, to conclude: You have to learn to go back and fix your holes, you had 3 times a chance to fix top, and instead of it you build few points in center. gEt your priorities straight. Corners, sides, center!  And actually I don't know what to write more, so good luck in future games!"

baduk,39mu6e,BenzineBro,6,Fri Jun 12 21:25:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to be super helpful, but I can at least point out that O16 in your second variation is terrible shape for white (slamming into the black stone at P16)  Black would probably come out at P15 instead of blocking obediently at P17 in your variation, as the cut doesn't work anyway.  Black now looks much better than in the given variation.  (Possible continuation: white Q17, black P17, but after this R15 and L17 are miai for black, he is happy with either, and looks much better than white either way)"
baduk,39mu6e,mkmatlock,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:17:08 2015 UTC,Why would black play P17?  Thanks for the reply. :)
baduk,39mu6e,mkmatlock,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:13:42 2015 UTC,"This is the situation from your variations (with my continuation) I was saying was bad for white: http://eidogo.com/#3hWJi4nHs  Black plays P17 to avoid being cut. This is different from directly playing P17 in the variation you gave where white runs into black's P16 stone.  In general, I think its bad shape wise for white to run into a 4th line stone like this, especially when pushing from behind at the same time."
baduk,39mu6e,hikaruzero,3,Sat Jun 13 17:01:29 2015 UTC,"I've added my thoughts and a bunch of variations to consider for you here.  Overall it strongly seems like black's response here is a mistake and white can make a steady gain by exploiting it.  I've added some thoughts about how to exploit it for you, and commented the variations you originally added.   I don't play high pincers very often and I dread it when its played against me so I figured that I should play it to figure it out.   ""My opponent's good move is my good move."" :)  A high two-space pincer here is rather complex but not unreasonable.  They tend to favor the player who can fight better.    One well-known but complicated joseki that results from this pincer is called the Magic Sword of Muramasa.  It is renowned for being very complex, much like the large avalanche and taisha josekis.   What I dislike about these kinds of pincers is that it often feels ""directionless"" since it's unclear something what these high stones do.   In general, a pincer emphasizes development on the side of the pincering stone.  A high stone emphasizes influence and best prepares for a fight or running battle.  And a 2-space pincer tends to be a little less severe, but also a little safer.  It also tends to deny a quick settlement of the position; 1-space pincers leave more aji to settle, things like attachments and cross-cuts.  All taken together, it seems that this move is saying something like ""I want to develop an influential position on the top side, and provoke some patient fighting that will not allow you to settle too quickly/easily.  My goal is to draw out a larger position I can build from or support a future fight with.""  The gained center influence is like an investment; it doesn't have so much immediate value but if capitalized on at the right moment can yield a bigger gain down the road.  It's a bit like playing the stock market, you can make a nice profit by cashing in at the right time.  But if you miss your opportunity or the stock never develops value, you may end up at a loss.  Hope that helps."

baduk,39mu6e,seriousmurr,2,Sat Jun 13 00:31:06 2015 UTC,"First B's response does not seem to be part of any joseki.  I added 2 simple joseki for black for reference.  Anyway something is probably suboptimal with his response.  I am not so strong as to see a clear path to ""punish"" him, so I'll try something simple to make his response suboptimal.  So I added a joseki to use for reference and comparison (starting at W move 6).  I end up using that for a simple exchange that should make his original response suboptimal by reduction, see this.  Anyway, just an idea.  Disclaimer: I am using an older joseki book as reference, so there's a possibility they might be outdated.    Edit:  Forgot to mention, I don't really agree with your original suggestions.  When W strengthen the pincer group, I'd attack and/or encircle the corner as black.  Since B has lower right corner, I'd first pressure the corner stone from somewhere from below (R15?  not sure).  Thickness pointing downward would be nice.  N17 can be ignored until it proves useful later on; it gains little in term of territory and it's not good to make W any thicker around the M column.  Probably something like this."

Isn't it better to get a real strong teacher, such as Guo Juan, with 1 lecture a week? Every single day seems unecessary, as you wont have time to put the advice into practice. I used to have her as a teacher, and usually she would review 2-3 games and then we would play a game, for 55 euro in 1,5 hrs. If you want cheaper there are some high kgs dans that will teach, such as ""finnish8d"" for 20 euro an hour, that's typically the price for high dan amateurs. I'd much rather get 1 lesson with someone of that strength than 2 lessons from someone of my strength had I been your level lol."
baduk,39l1v2,acceleratr,2,Fri Jun 12 14:20:15 2015 UTC,An hour lesson a week doesn't feel like enough to me. I understand its important to get a very strong player to help because they will focus on basics and fundamentals. Compared to a 1 Dan who may have hit 1 dan by self teaching. But... it would be nice to be able to get all my games reviewed. I think getting your games reviewed is more important then playing multiply games without them being reviewed. And i dont make a lot of money working part time while going to college. So im hoping i can get someone affordable and who will work with me on a good schedule. Then a 40 dollar lesson once a week for a hour. But i am takign your advice. Im goign to try out Kaz and see how his teaching goes. And maybe ill do his lessons once a month on top of the mon - fri amateur teacher im hoping to hire.
baduk,39l1v2,baudtack,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:58:17 2015 UTC,I highly recommend Batt. He's looking for Monday students. If you want more than an hour a week you'd have to talk to him about it directly.
baduk,39l1v2,waterbucket999,6,Tue Jun 16 15:22:16 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for a teacher and willing to pay, I'd recommend you go with someone that has actual teaching experience that is high amateur dan (if you're 3k, I'd say 4d+) at the minimum. If you're not getting a trial lesson beforehand, you're taking a bit of a risk otherwise as just being a strong player doesn't necessarily make someone a good teacher."
baduk,39l1v2,razzinos,2,Fri Jun 12 14:45:06 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. When i was a 7 kyu i hired a 4 dan AGA player from the Boston go club to review 5 games a week and play me when he could. In 3 months i became 4 kyu, but both of us became busy so i had to stop. Now ive been doing self study and i only just hit the tip of 3 kyu after 3 months of reading books.... I think having a stronger player review your games once a day makes progress soar. So im looking for that experience again. Even if there not a great teacher a 1 dan on KGS is much stronger then i am. At least in my experience. But i do appreciate the advice. Ill ask for a trial lesson. And besides if the lessons arent helping me i can always halt the lessons.  I dont think im taking to much of a risk."
baduk,39l1v2,hikaruzero,3,Fri Jun 12 16:52:09 2015 UTC,I suggest to use KGSTeachingLadder. There are plenty of low dans there and all you need to do in return is to give a couple of lessons/reviews to weaker players

You might not be able to hire even a single professional landscaper to do a bang-up job of maintaining your property for that ... but wouldn't you say it's reasonable to throw that at, say, the high-school kid next door who will mow your lawn to make some scratch to buy that new video game he wants?  He won't do nearly as good of a job, but it might still be good enough for you to relax on the weekends and not have to mow it yourself.  Also, there are some amateur idiots out there who enjoy mindlessly teaching Go for free (like me sometimes! haha) -- and probably some of them would enjoy having an extra $50 a week for whatever, and would be willing to teach a little more than usual for it.  It's better than nothing, and if you're already doing it for free, well ... doing it for $7/hour just makes all kinds of sense, doesn't it?

baduk,39g23m,kaijanai,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:52:06 2015 UTC,There is a very similar tsumego in Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go. I wonder how often this technique crops up in actual games.
baduk,39f7ue,metaperl,3,Thu Jun 11 09:10:46 2015 UTC,"I think the result you got responding to the move 19 invasion quite good, you got a group to run and made profit on both sides.  I just have a comment about move 18. In my opinion it was your first mistake, (someone stronger than me might disagree, but I think your moves before that were top notch). A note about enclosures in general, and how that relates to your game."
baduk,39f7ue,sharkweekk,2,Thu Jun 11 10:23:58 2015 UTC,"I think I agree with move 18 being poor, move 17 by Black is poor, Black should probably be approaching white, not playing to enclose a 4-4 point.  So Move 18 should have been something that put pressure on Black, maybe approaching Black's upper right on the right side, Black should then finish surrounding his corner, and white can make an extension on the right side.  When you make a long extension you should already know what to do if your opponent invades, that is you should have a plan, you need to make your stones strong and your opponents weak, so you start by making a base for your weaker stones. Ideally whilst attacking your opponent, whilst they are struggling to live or escape you make your groups strong.  So I would say your move 20 is the wrong direction you are approaching a strong stone formation, rather you should have attacked the invading stone. The result is that Black doesn't have to respond to your move, and gets to make a free move making his invasion stronger.  When you play on the fourth line your goal should be to get influence, if you play on the fourth line to take territory, you have to make many more moves to secure that territory.  When Black invades, your two stones are on the fourth line, so you should probably be planning on making some good influence whilst Black's invasion ends up living small on the side.   Instead you start trying to take territory, your fourth line stones aren't helping you get territory, so its almost as if you are just making your own groups by playing there, after move 32, the group is secure because of the 4 stones you played on the second and third lines, the fourth line stone isn't really contributing to the group.  When you want to take territory, play third line stones, you'll find it easier to secure with less stones, or if you play fourth line stones aim to make influence. When you make a move understand exactly what its meaning is.  A lot of getting better is understanding what a move means and how to use it correctly, using fourth line stones to take territory will mean you will have to play more stones to secure territory, giving your opponent the chance to play better moves, and get ahead in the game.  Black's move 69, is a gift, when your opponent plays a move like this you need to play one that is very good, your move 70 however isn't very good, its just a stone in the middle.  It doesn't attack anything, it doesn't connect to any other stones, it doesn't threaten to attack any stones, it doesn't reduce black's territory, rather it helps him because he can now attack the weak stone to make a big territory."

Move 44 seemed better at o13 or so, more points. Same with 46, not a very urgent move. Move 50 could also start around o13. If black plays there, he reduces your potential. M18 was better than move 82. Move 84 at q9 is a stronger shape than p9. Move 143 you should respond at L8"

Can cost an awful lot if you don't know how to answer it correctly."
baduk,39ei90,Shiranaru,3,Thu Jun 11 04:59:55 2015 UTC,"Well to start with, at the end of the game, stones that are objectively dead get removed and added to your score so 'taking the points' really is just filling in a point of territory on your side.  Sometimes it is good to take the stones to reduce aji (basically means lingering threats you need to be aware of like a cutting point or a group of yours with few liberties), it's awful when you have a group that is objectively dead but you leave them and they come back to life later on when you overextended or miscalculate.  As for how to get better at invading, there are a number of good guides, but I think you may want to work on the fundamentals first, you are clearly quite new.  I'd recommend nick sibicky's YouTube channel which has videos on invasions and also the fundamentals like shape and stuff like that. Tsumego puzzles will help you to improve in some aspects of both defending invasions and invading others.  Good luck!"
baduk,39ei90,Areign,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:03:51 2015 UTC,"If you had spent 3 moves inside your territory to capture, you would have cost yourself 3 points.  The prisoner stones are already counted in your favor."

baduk,39ei90,ZXRP,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:44:18 2015 UTC,"Just be sure it's a corpse; that is, be sure that the group is dead and isn't in a capturing race against one of your own not alive groups. Things that look dead can come back to life if your own groups surrounding them don't live."

baduk,39chib,Shadonra,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:30:33 2015 UTC,"In the link, the problem given starts at move 20. The two solutions are all the moves after it. If you know a better one, instead of down voting perhaps you could give examples on better moves to solve the problem that begins on move 20."
baduk,39ats3,mkmatlock,3,Wed Jun 10 14:21:38 2015 UTC,"Just some thoughts from the top of my head -  11: The plan is aggressive.  12: I would prefer to keep this peep in reserve, don't think it's necessary to play it immediately.  18: Like this move from white, the choice is better than the hane shape-wise.  19: Black would've played this move in response to a white hane and get great shape, but because white played a direct extension, now this move looks too slow. Black played J17 to attack, but now black is the one under a bit of pressure after for instance a white play at J15.  20: Not sure I like the attachment, would prefer J15 instead.  23: Very solid move. I would prefer to be a little quicker and play at K17 instead.  28: White ends up with a strong shape, but the points in the corner was a lot to give up. Note that in comparison, white J15 black G16 would leave white some opportunities in the corner for essentially a similar result with the two groups.  34: I don't like the joseki choice from white. He has to start thinking about the point difference in the game, and because of N12, it's hard to see how to make use of the wall.  48: I think the timing for this move is too early.  52: This sequence would work if white already has an enclosure in the bottom right. However, since he doesn't, the correct sequence of play is to play in the latter area first. It's still hard to see how white will overcome the point difference, but he has to start by getting the entire right side, the bottom is then step 2.  63: Too easy for black, I'd say the outcome is decided by here.  67: B4 is enough for black.  To address the points you raise in your post, at least in this game, white fell behind in territory because of move 20. It's always iffy to attach to isolated stones. In this case, white not only strengthened a stone that was black's main weakness, but gave away a lot of corner territory in the top left.  In addition, if you find yourself down on territory all of a sudden in a game, it might be good to try to focus more on the big picture in your games. I find it helpful to always have a big plan for the game and use this to decide on the big strategic / directional moves you play. You can refine your plan as the game develops and in response to specific moves, but it's important to never be playing by the seat of your pants.  For instance, if it's move 1, the plan could be as simple as ""get territory"" or ""get influence"". Depending on joseki choice, etc., this could evolve to ""make territory here"" -> ""attack this stone"" -> ""Have 15 point lead, just play super conservative, don't die and I'll win!"" or ""neutralize this moyo"" -> ""have to invade somewhere, but where???"" -> ""Invade here!!(?)"".  As you can see, a lot of big picture plans I think tend to involve the balance between territory and influence. If you're keeping track of your overall plan on a move-by-move basis, I don't think you'll ever be caught by surprise at how the game has developed."

baduk,394kr8,Tristamwolf,3,Tue Jun 9 06:28:11 2015 UTC,"Good shape, has good potential to make eyes, and is hard to attack.  Bad shape has poor potential to make eyes and is easy to attack.  Good shape example, gives you almost a complete mouth or geta shape. No cutting points.  Bad shape example gives you two cut groups with no eye potential, White can easily attack these groups, and even if they live, White can most likely get an advantage from all the moves Black has to make to live, escape or run. It is not that this shape can even be attacked, it is already heavily under attack.  Making good shape, makes groups that are easier to keep alive, and/or connected. And so do not require you to play a lot of extra moves to keep them alive."

baduk,394kr8,Areign,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:19:35 2015 UTC,Those types of shape are bad shapes usually because of efficiency. Among other reasons of course but try this: place that shape of black stones alone on a board and count the liberties. Now place the same number of stones in a pillar and count the liberties. Which has more?  edit: I would like to add this is just one part of what makes good shape. But I find it to be the easiest way to explain to newer players. If you don't quite get shape yet then you don't quite understand eye potential and influence. u/Mescale actually has a more thorough explanation but it might be a bit much for some newer players(I'm not sure how new you are lol)

""since your sequence is wrong, it is clearly about shape""  i do not follow.  It may be that the fact that it is easy to break out, is a result of blacks bad shape, but i think that its really a question of, do you want the sequence that leaves you with two weak groups, or do you want the sequence which leaves your opponent with two weak groups...  I tend to think of shapes as things with the ability to make eyes or get cut, i think the issue here is simply that he can't kill that white group, I think its possible to change the situation so that white can't survive without (what i consider) black's shape significantly changing."
baduk,394kr8,BulletD0dger,3,Tue Jun 9 15:57:21 2015 UTC,"Its a sequence that results in a much better shape for black. Thus a question concerning shape. I understand what you mean about its just a proper sequence to not be cut and start a fight, but you're playing a better sequence to improve the shape of your group and fix said issues. The resulting shape at the end is more beneficial for black.   Good shape is the result of playing good sequences. Knowing what good shape looks like can help determine the sequences that you aim for."
baduk,393ihr,prosgorandom,10,Tue Jun 9 00:14:36 2015 UTC,"if its a submarine invasion (second line behind your group) squish it from the sides, he needs between 6 and 8 in a row (depending on sente and ability to hane) to live on the one line.

baduk,393ihr,nuketesuji,3,Tue Jun 9 04:36:11 2015 UTC,"they have to live locally inside your territory and your task is to kill them.   Not necessarily. If you can kill them, by all means consider it an option. If you can't, you can still get a lot of free moves in the area by playing such that your opponent has to respond to stay alive.  In fact, it may sometimes be better to let your opponent fight for their life even if you know they'll eventually succeed than try to kill outright. While your opponent is fighting for their life, that's when you build solid foundations around them."
baduk,393ihr,kqr,5,Tue Jun 9 01:34:44 2015 UTC,"I know what you're talking about, and you're right, but I think OP is talking about those times when your opponent blatantly plays inside your completely secure bit of territory, where he should have absolutely no chance of living, which is something you wouldn't do, but 25k do all the time. Like this.  In a position like that, it would be an awful idea to go: ""Oh, I'll sacrifice some territory to get thickness!"" ""Oh, I'll make him live small!"" ""Oh, I'll profit from attacking!"" or any other proper thing that you are normally supposed to do. You kinda have to kill this absurdity, and when you're new you may not necessarily know how. /u/nuketesuji gave great and useful advice:   squish it from the sides, he needs between 6 and 8 in a row (depending on sente and ability to hane) to live on the one line.   The important thing in a position like that is to limit the space the opponent has. If he has no space to make a base or escape, he won't be able to live, no matter what he does. A common mistake is to contact play and try to capture. You don't want to capture, you only want to prevent two eyes."

baduk,393ihr,Thuruk,4,Tue Jun 9 09:32:42 2015 UTC,"When someone invades, they either have to live inside, or escape.  Your goal is to make sure that neither happens.  the edge of the board is tricksy, very tricksy, many things just work there, you probably just don't know enough of the tricks, do tsumego and think about how the edge of the board, affects the play.  Examine what shapes are common, and where their vital points are.  Some useful things to know.   On side on the second line, you needs 8 stones in a row to live unconditionally, 6 stones in a row dies.  In the corner on the second line you need 6 stones to live unconditionally.  Examine how this works, and also think about how this affects a 9 x 9 game.  Also if you think sides are tricksy, corners are like extra double tricky, for real yo.  If you have your stones on the fourth row, the territory is invadable if it isn't fully surrounded, really if it is surrounded the opponent should die, you just need to know which moves to play."

baduk,390b0p,WritingPromptIdiot,9,Mon Jun 8 08:57:26 2015 UTC,"I just happened to have taught my 15 year old younger brother to play Go over the weekend. A solid foundation and understanding is everything.   Start as simple as you can.  * The goal of the game is to surround as much territory as possible. Show a couple of examples as to what territory looks like (you can even show how it's more efficient to surround territory in the corner and on the sides, as opposed to the center)   Black gets the first move. You are allowed to place a stone anywhere you want on the board (suicide rule comes later). Then both players proceed to place stones in turns. These stones do not move once they are placed. Make sure to explain the concept of liberties in the very beginning. Connecting groups, making eyes, all these things follow naturally after the concept of liberties is explained. Make it absolutely clear that the stone has 4 liberties (above, below, left and right). A lot of beginners often think that liberties also work diagonally.  Now comes capturing. Place a white stone on the board, and place 3 black stones around it, so that the white stone is in atari. When you place the 4th black stone on the last liberty, explain that the stone is captured, because (and this is important) it has no liberties left. So explain that NO LIBERTIES = DEAD Proceed with asking them how they would save the white stone. Most people will place a white stone on the last liberty. Then explain how those stones are connected, and that they now share liberties. In order to kill the two stones, you need to fill in the 3 remaining liberties with black stones. Give an example of how diagonal stones are NOT connected, and do not share liberties (by showing how you can capture one of them without capturing the other, for example).  Suicide rule and ko rule. These are pretty straightforward, and shouldn't be too hard to grasp. You're not allowed to place a stone in such a way that your stone(s) is/are immediately captured, etc.    Honestly, I think it's better to have a game on a 9x9 board to begin with (giving handicap stones to the novice, if you want), so that they see these rules in action. After that, you can start explaining the concept of eyes.   If you really want to make them interested, give them a ridiculous number of handicap stones (I gave my li'l brother 9 stones on a 9x9, and he beat me in the second try. He got really motivated when I took a handicap stone away, as he got the feeling he improved almost instantly. After we got to 5 stones handicap, I decided it was time to move to a 13x13 board.)  After (or during the game), you can point out their mistakes and suggest where they should have rather played, and what the thought behind it is. Giving them a couple of general principles like 'the value of connecting' or 'restricting eye space' can give them a good boost in the beginning.   Hope this helps, and good luck!"

baduk,390b0p,blue1_,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:48:39 2015 UTC,"This is basically where I was when I first started teaching my friends. I used to just play and stop them when they made an illegal move. Now what I do for new players is teach them capture go first on a 9x9 board. Once they get the idea of not letting their individual stones die and such, assuming they want to continue learning, I bring them to a 19x19 and teach them territory. I also send them through the Interactive Way to Go around that time as well to familiarize them with the concepts of the game."
baduk,390b0p,leonprimrose,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:39:00 2015 UTC,"I have had the best luck teaching people by having two simultaneous people learn from you at the same time.  Teach them the basics, play anywhere, liberties, and tell them that the points in the game are from surrounding territory.   Then, tell them you will fill in all other rules as they play capture 3 with each other. I've found that the game is less intimidating if both players are new. Definitely less frustrating for the new players.   Anyways, one they play capture 3, most other concepts will come out. KO, ladders, etc.  Once that's done a few times, have them play a real game of 9x9 or 13x13. Don't tell them how to play better... Only interrupt if they do something illegal. Then help them count the points when the game is over.  That's it.. Now if they had fun.. It's all a matter of ""playing better""."
baduk,390b0p,Jsnake666,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:47:33 2015 UTC,"Until they learn to count liberties and some of the basic fighting shapes, games are going to be fairly random.  They won't have reasons behind any of their moves.   I like playing ""the connecting game"" -- I start them on a smaller board (9 or 13) with 2 stones of each color in diagonal corners on the star or 3-3.  The first to connect these two starting stones or capture one of their opponent's starting stones wins.  This teaches them a LOT of basic strategy -- what connection means, what cutting means, basic fighting shapes, the value of fast vs solid moves, and some capturing/life and death.    I find a few sessions of playing this game will get most people up to speed in terms of shape and fighting technique.  After they get smart about playing defensively and living so they have a couple ""ties"", then you can introduce territory and scoring naturally.   edit: example learning games just to give the idea http://eidogo.com/#2FRxX1e7o:0,0"

If I add a move, it means that I think it was better than what was played in the game, but I could be wrong and in some positions I didn't have a very good idea about what to play, so take everything I wrote with a grain of salt.   I think B played better and deserved to win even without the divine move at 224. A bad thing about B's play was that he left weak groups undefended and didn't seem to care about sente in the endgame as much as he should have. W was playing more timidly and slowly, though.

Usually when I send out a request I go by the following rules of thumb:   If I invite someone same strength or weaker, I politely elect to play white. If I challenge someone stronger I play black 5 minutes main time (10 minutes is also totally fine in my experience, never tried 1 minute) 10 minutes per 25 stones.   That said I've had a few quicker offers (1+5 for instance), but I've not had much luck with longer times. I agree that when you really need to read hard (at my level anyway), 10 minutes can often not seem enough (unfortunately when it's not, it's usually the deciding factor, but I tend to shrug it off a bit more if I lose because of time constraints). 10 minutes per 25 stones is what I've sort of come to see as standard though, at least against those I've played..."

baduk,38ciph,gamedrifter,1 point,Wed Jun 3 09:40:59 2015 UTC,"The first thing that I saw is that the joseki in the bottom left and upper left is not quite enough for black. If you haven't heard of it I highly recommend kogo's joseki dictionary. Its free and is a great resource.   Move 16 for white is extremely slow. Never ever do something like this. Your two space jump response was a good move to continue expanding your moyo.  The invasion in the upper left is also good timing I belie ve, but again a poor joseki choice.    I think 31 isn't correct. I think a two space jump on the third line gives you a solid base. Also threatens to scoop out more white territory if he lets you in. 31 is too high and white has options to take away your base and create profit for himself through attacking you.   At 55 I'd cut white at L12. I think you can cut that group off and make white pay.   68 was too greedy by white and the cut was good. 71 however is not needed.   79 should be at Q6.  Better to be a step ahead and in a position to hane. I don't think he has any way to cut you.   95 was a good try to kill. You got white to play a few moves he didn't need to save the group.   Disclaimer: I'm a 5 kyu in kgs... So don't take any of this as gospel. Except move 16, that was terrible."
baduk,38ciph,Wasuremono41,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:33:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insights and criticism. 95 I read out a little and figured he would probably save the stones but that if he were careless I might be able to kill. My real goal was just to give myself some breathing room while he dealt with the threat so I could seal him in.   I have Kogo's and I will try to remember the responses I found there, I just don't use it during games.  I knew my joseki in the corners wasn't ideal in the moment but I got tunnel vision and couldn't see anything else, which is one of the biggest problems with my play. I find it does get better the more I play.   Right now I am trying to work on not always responding to where my opponent plays."
baduk,38ciph,Wasuremono41,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:56:24 2015 UTC,Yeah don't use kogo's during games. If that's the only joseki that you know to respond to that you did fine.   If I had to pick who was stronger from just the game record I would pick black. So keep up the good work!
baduk,38ciph,wren42,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:15:46 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say I even ""knew"" that joseki, it's just what I played because I'd never seen anybody play that before. Thanks for the compliment :)."
baduk,38cdiz,xiaodai,4,Wed Jun 3 08:42:11 2015 UTC,"Whoever said that in the first place was very confused. Chinese rules use 7.5, and Japanese rules use 6.5, but this is not for the purpose of parity.  Only under AGA rules are the results always the same with area or territory counting, due mainly to the passed-stone rule."
baduk,38cdiz,Mikuro,10,Wed Jun 3 14:17:36 2015 UTC,"This title makes no sense at all. The result of Chinese and Japanese rules can be the same, can differ by a point, or can differ by many points. None of that is in any way related to the value of komi.  Chinese komi is 7.5 because 5.5 was found to be insufficient in practice and since Chinese scores usually differ by two points (1 zi), a switch to 6.5 was pointless."
baduk,38cdiz,herminator,3,Wed Jun 3 10:34:29 2015 UTC,"or can differ by many points.   Normally, no. This only happens if either player passes before the end of the game, which there is no reason to do as far as I know. Am I missing something?"
baduk,38cdiz,kqr,6,Wed Jun 3 10:47:13 2015 UTC,"Chinese rules count points in seki, so any unbalanced seki will create additional points for one player (e.g. two groups with an eye separated by one without eyes like this: http://senseis.xmp.net/?Seki#toc4). Furthermore, players can sometimes create a ko, or not defend an existing one, during the dame stage and play it to get extra dame points (see example at: http://senseis.xmp.net/?TerritoryAndAreaScoring#toc8)"

Also, the 6-4 approach just gives black so much territory.  Finally, how fast did you play your moves?

baduk,37ylj1,Tasty_Yogurt,11,Tue Jun 2 17:59:38 2015 UTC,"It's really hard to answer, because there are no easy algorithms to tell if the group is weak or strong, if the shape is good or bad, or where the defects are. Being able to do that is what makes you a good player, and it only comes with experience.   There are some simple tips though that can help you. If you want to find out if the group is weak, first you can ask yourself: ""does it have 2 clear eyes already?"" If yes, it's obviously 100% safe. If not, ask: ""does it have a base?"" ""can it easily make 2 eyes any time it has to?"" ""can it easily connect to a group that is safe if it needs to?"" Maybe it has a sort of miai to live in 2 possible ways, so that it is impossible for the opponent to block both at the same time? Are there strong opponent's groups nearby? Do you have access to the center?  How can you find a shape defect? Well, even if you are very new, I can imagine you sometimes notice the defects in the opponent's shape already. Look at the picture. I'm sure that you can see that W's shape is flawed and has cut points, while B's shape is strong and can not be cut. B can give a double atari and capture stuff. This is an easy example. Sometimes shape defects are very hard to see. I miss lots and lots of them in my games. But normally if a double atari is possible, this might be a shape defect. If some cluster of stones has very few liberties, it might be a shape defect. If you can peep and disconnect, it might be a shape defect.   Here are some articles on good shape. 1 2 3.   It's impossible to give a comprehensive answer on what makes a shape good that would be applicable in all possible situations. I think the only way to really learn it to play lots of games and analyze your mistakes afterwards. Tsumego may be helpful, although not all tsumego is about shape, mostly it's focused on life and death."

baduk,37ylj1,seigenblues,5,Wed Jun 3 14:13:18 2015 UTC,"Overall, you need the experience to learn more. When you play, pay close attention to why certain things work or doesn't work.  A group's strength is determined by it's eye potential and/or ability to run.  Defects in shape usually refer to cutting points and how it can be exploited by your opponent. There are common patterns that can be recognizable, but it takes experiences to do so.   Whether a shape is good or bad is determined by it's potential to make eyes. This includes things such as space or quite literally the shape of an eye. Good shape is also hard for your opponent to turn an eye into a false one. Again, there are patterns that can be recognized but it takes reading and experience."

Does your group have two liberties? Bad! But the one next to it only has one? Suddenly, totally ok!  it's a useful framework to which you can add your tesuji & shape knowledge :)"

baduk,3804m9,fierynipple,1 point,Sun May 31 23:07:41 2015 UTC,"Okay, here's how I get Tygem to work on Linux. It's a bit of a process, but since you're using Linux, I assume you're okay with that.  Set-up  I run Ubuntu, although this will probably work on many other distributions.  To play Windows games, I use PlayOnLinux. It's basically just a front-end for Wine with some fancy features, such as the ability to download needed dll files without scouring the dark corners of the Internet.  Here are the steps:   Install PlayOnLinux through whatever means you like (Ubuntu Software Center, Synaptic, apt, etc) Download the Tygem installer from their website. Note: You might need to temporarily turn your adblocker off to see the download link. Open PlayOnLinux, click ""Install"" and then click ""Install a non-listed program"" (down in the bottom left of the UI) Go through the install wizard:   Choose to 'Install a program in a new virtual drive'. Type in whatever name you like. When it asks you what you would like to do before installation, select 'Install some libraries'. On the next step, I usually make the virtual drive 32 bits, though I'm not sure it really matters. HERE'S THE IMPORTANT PART: When it's time to install additional libraries, select POL_Install_mfc42. This knowledge was earned through much hardship. Now, click 'Browse' and select the Tygem installer you downloaded previously (TygemGlobalSetup.exe) Now go through the Tygem install wizard. It'll do some set up and then start downloading files from the Internet. You may or may not get errors at the end of this process (possibly something about confirming some sort of version number). Don't worry about these errors, just click through them. Once the install is done, select TyegemGlobal.exe to make a shortcut. Then, when PlayOnLinux asks again, select 'I don't want to make another shortcut' to finish off the process.  Now in your PlayOnLinux window you will see TygemGlobal. It's also likely that a shortcut (and an obnoxious link to the website) has appeared on your dekstop. You can use either one of these to start Tygem. (In PlayOnLinux, just select TygemGlobal and hit 'Run').   Be warned, this works but it is VERY buggy. In particular, woe to you if you go browsing through the betting menus; you are almost guaranteed to crash the program. However, it works great to watch games. It's all right for playing games, but you'll likely run into bugs. I personally just watch games on Tygem anyway, since the ranks are a complete mess at my level and so I don't find it much fun to play.  Hopefully this works for you. Like others said, qGo also works, but the interface is a nightmare and it is also buggy. There's really no non-buggy way of playing Tygem on Linux outside of using a virtual machine."

baduk,3802v0,arimnaes,2,Mon Jun 1 15:44:16 2015 UTC,"My thoughts on the first ~50 moves:  B3 is actually fine (so is playing B3 at the 5-3 point as your alternative move suggests, though it's much less usual.)  I assume by ""invasion"" you meant ""approach,"" in which case, yes, it's true that approaching a 5-3 point from the outside would be much less effective for White than approaching the weak side of a 3-4 stone.  However, if W4 is an approach against Black's 3-4 stone, Black can just take the empty corner (or respond, if he prefers) so he's still fine.  B5 is a bad move.  By attaching directly to White's 4-4 stone, he makes both stones weak, but now it's White's move, so White gets the critical second move here.  White can hane on either side of Black's stone and immediately injure it further, leaving it with only one direction to develop.  Unfortunately, W6 is not a good response.  For single stones, missing even a single liberty is a significant weakness, so it's urgent for White to hane or at least directly extend the D4 stone.  F3 doesn't do enough to help White's stone and hurt Black's.  Now Black gets to hane first with B7, and he gets a much better result in this corner than he should have.  W12 is probably the right distance.  White's E3 stones have bad shape (note the empty triangle formed by E4, E3, and F3) and they are undercut by Black's D2 stone, so a standard two space extension is reasonable for helping settle them.  Playing farther risks leaving an invasion point for Black.  Playing away with W14 is probably correct.  If White blocks at F5 and Black and White continue up the board pushing against each other, the J3 stone will end up badly placed next to White's wall.  Since White already invested a move there, it's correct to play away, since if Black continues in the lower lefthand corner, White can simply extend along the edge again to keep his stones safe.  W18 should be at S15.  Black has offered you a free atari, and if you take it, his connection at R16 makes Q16 into a slow move (Black will have the same empty triangle shape that White has in the lower left.)  If Black doesn't connect at R16, then White gets to capture the R15 stone, in which case you get to omit the connection at Q14.  That's why taking the atari first is important.  I also agree with your decision to tenuki with W22, and it's in a large area of the board, too.  It's also worth considering enclosing the lower right corner with W22, probably at O3.  Because you have two large, low extensions, the 3-3 invasion is very attractive for Black.  Enclosing makes that invasion much more difficult and also helps ensure that your lower lefthand group won't get into trouble later.  I believe the only joseki move for W24 is to hane at D13.  Black should respond to your peep by simply connecting, and then he has a nice wall facing his position in the upper right and can either turn to take the corner or play an extension in the top center that will unify his position.  When Black blocks the corner instead, pushing through is critical, so good decision on your part.  However, when Black extends to D13, you absolutely need to to connect at C13.  This is your first mistaken tenuki.  It's good to focus on remaining aware of when you don't need to respond to your opponent and can play a larger move elsewhere.  However, not all moves that look small actually are small.  A simple connection or extension often completely changes the meaning of a position by removing a critical weakness, ensuring that a group has a base, or preventing a group from being sealed in.  These are what we would call urgent moves, and they should nearly always be played before moves that are big in terms of points but not urgent (obligatory Nick Sibicky video link.)  In this case, Black can push in at C13, and when you block at B13, you're left with two cutting points.  It looks like you were aware of this, based on some of the alternative sequences you played out.  However, you misread the ladder.  It does work for Black, because the J3 stone is one line too far away to act as a ladder breaker.  So Black should immediately push and cut, capturing either your C15 stones or your C12 stone.  Black made a big mistake by making the D12-C11 exchange first, which indeed makes the push and cut no longer work.  Your reasoning for making the extension rather than connecting at C13 was that White would be ""trapped inside.""  This is not exactly true, however, because Black's shape has severe weaknesses.  If Black continues pushing from behind by playing at D12, White can hane at D11 with no fear because his shape is completely solid.  Black's D14 stones are then very short of liberties, and he has potential cutting points at E12, E14, and E16.  This means he can't play the move he wants to play, which is to hane at E11.  He has to play a timid move instead, like jumping to F13, which means White succeeds at getting up to the fourth line and can extend down the lefthand side (which starts threatening to activate the cutting points in Black's lower lefthand group as well.)  That's the power of having strong shape when your opponent has weak shape.  Learn to appreciate this sort of result!  Relatedly, it looks like you let Black off the hook after he played the wedge at E10.  Black's D14 stones are so short of liberties that the first move you look at should be the atari at E11.  If Black connects, your follow-up cut at E14 looks nearly devastating.  Black has too few liberties to atari down, obviously.  He also can't atari out starting at E13 without massively damaging his position above.  He can play atari at E12, letting you connect at F11, and then capture your cutting stone by playing F14.  But you still have additional forcing moves that will leave his entire D14 group as a blob with no eyes, no influence, and no points.  Basically, his shortage of liberties ensures that he has no good options.  Compare this to the game result, where you gave up your F10 stone without a fight, and as of move 50, Black has managed to nearly link up all his stones along the left side (there is still some cutting aji for White, but it's much less severe now.)  Black also has sente.  So this is a pretty major missed opportunity for White.  Your group on the left was already safe, so the extra points you made by capturing C8 are not very much compensation.  And I just read a little further ahead and saw that you ended up capturing the D14 stones anyway, haha.  Still, Black shouldn't have let you get away with that after the exchanges made through move 50.  Had he used sente to, for instance, descend to B16 and then A16, both of which threaten to capture your C15 stones, and then fixed his remaining outside weakness with a move like the hane at F11, you would have been faced with a much more difficult game."
baduk,37ypxx,eksert,2,Sun May 31 15:08:11 2015 UTC,"One thing you can do to review your own games is to use a resource like josekipedia when you get a result in a corner that you aren't happy about. The result in the top right was an absolute trainwreck, black gets 4th line territory and a huge wall facing out. White gets almost nothing. You may have heard that you shouldn't be memorizing joseki yet, but it would be a good time to start learning some basics ones.   The typical thing to do against that pincer in the san ren sei is just take the corner. If your opponent blocks the right direction, then you will take territory and sente to approach the other corner. If you do jump out against that pincer, use a one space jump instead of leaning with the knight's move. Then shoulder hit the isolated stone to build a wall towards the center."

Definitely agree with them showing good shape. Really helped me get a feel for how to develop from 3-4 points, joseki, and common patterns along the sides.  Not that they will show less optimal joseki, and you'll want to make sure to study modern joseki immediately after studying the older pro games (I'd say go through a pro game a day for a month, and then move on to modern joseki).  You don't want to improve your shape and then start playing inefficiently in the corners, do you? :P"
baduk,37vrfg,anon445,2,Sun May 31 17:24:48 2015 UTC,"Ack, sorry about that. I didn't think to give a link. Hopefully they answered your questions! I also use Go4go.net. Commentary can help, but is not required. Most commentary requires so form a payment for product such as buying books or subscribing to a service. However, there are some free commentaries out that but they require a little digging. Thanks for watching the videos!"
baduk,37vrfg,Clossius,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:19:09 2015 UTC,"By the way: How do you think watching reviews ranks among the various ways of getting better (and lnowing good shape). I feel like i learn that by watching your reviews, and it is way more fun than looking at pro games (which I find to be a bit too much work for me to do it a lot).  Thanks again for doing the reviews, I think it fills a needed gap of shorter instructional videos. Sibicky and Dwyrin are good, but often I do not have an hour to spend uninterrupted. Your 15-20min videos are perfect for someone with a busy life :)"
baduk,37uxiw,sharkweekk,1 point,Sat May 30 16:39:07 2015 UTC,I would like to continue the old pro theme and suggest this game by honinbo dosaku http://gokifu.com/s/26f-gokifu-16831119-Yusui_Sanchi()-Honinbo_Dosaku().html

baduk,37uxiw,FarodinAngels,1 point,Sat May 30 18:46:09 2015 UTC,I've always wanted to see the 16 soldiers game in its entirety but I never found it. It's a Go Seigen game. I would suggest either that or The Game of the Century
baduk,37rhuo,seigenblues,6,Fri May 29 20:21:16 2015 UTC,"OK, since some people here said that they weren't familiar with eurogotv in the first place, maybe I should make a bit of a ""Greatest Hits"" compilation of their best videos.  A lecture by Catalin Taranu 5p: I imagine strong players might get the most out of this one, it's pretty in-depth and gives a nice insight into the pro thinking.  An interview with /r/baduk's favorite pro, Haylee  An extremely underwhelming interview with the rising star, Ke Jie  The Murugandi reviews series: I think ddks will be easily able to follow these. They are kinda rambling at times, but they really helped me when I was a very new player. Maybe the most interesting review is the one of an early Ke Jie game."
baduk,37rhuo,Tasty_Yogurt,1 point,Fri May 29 22:34:08 2015 UTC,"As a beginner player I loved the Murugandi reviews, I'm glad they did that series, and I wish the site was more user friendly, like the way gogameguru is, probably would have attracted more support."

baduk,37rhuo,Tasty_Yogurt,1 point,Mon Jun 1 10:47:30 2015 UTC,Someone should ask them(or him) to make the videos public because having them private is nonsense. I can send him a message on youtube I guess but I don't know the guy.

baduk,37rhuo,acceleratr,5,Tue Jun 2 16:47:30 2015 UTC,"I'll admit I never really watched EuroGoTV other than looking at the occasional broadcast they were replaying on KGS (I know they would often put more effort into it that others appreciated, like videos and whatnot, I just didn't watch those).  Nevertheless I certainly consider it a loss to the community as a whole for them to leave.  I understand their reasons, and certainly can't blame them...but it's hard not to be sad to see them go."
baduk,37rhuo,Mefanol,5,Sat May 30 06:15:01 2015 UTC,VIP model is horrible for niche markets. Much better to make all content available and ask for donations or do fundraisers. The problem with VIP is that your VIP members can't grow your audience by sharing your best content because you put it behind a paywall. I never even knew about eurogo tv and over the years I have asked several times for resources and it was never mentioned once.  Dwyrin's patreon is at just over 350 per month (and hopefully it continues to climb for more great content) and Nick Sibicky has also been experiencing great success on that model. So it's not like the Go community isn't willing to pay for quality content.
baduk,37rhuo,gamedrifter,6,Sat May 30 11:28:40 2015 UTC,"They seem to complain about not getting donations or subscribers, but I'd never heard of them before now"
baduk,37rhuo,ProtoJazz,6,Fri May 29 21:35:49 2015 UTC,"They were among the first to put any English-language Go videos on YouTube, before anyone else started doing it, and those were pretty good. After some time they stopped releasing new lectures though and kinda faded into obscurity. I mean, uh... even greater obscurity than the one all the Go youtubers are naturally doomed to."
baduk,37rhuo,Tasty_Yogurt,2,Fri May 29 21:45:48 2015 UTC,Makes sense. I've only been playing about 3 or 4 years
baduk,37rhuo,ProtoJazz,-1,Fri May 29 21:46:59 2015 UTC,I also hasn't heard of them or bothered signing up for their content. Lots of good lessons to learn here though
baduk,37rhuo,ralgrado,2,Fri May 29 21:49:21 2015 UTC,I've seen them on tournaments. They were making video streams of the top boards at some of them.
baduk,37rhuo,cazique,1 point,Mon Jun 1 10:42:58 2015 UTC,That's how I ran into them as well. They also got some mentions in the AGA E-Journal from time to time.
baduk,37rhuo,rowe92,7,Fri Jun 5 22:58:05 2015 UTC,"I never really went on EurogoTV because it was just a confusing, ugly site. Could have done with a proper design and some sensible UX"
baduk,37rhuo,acceleratr,1 point,Fri May 29 21:39:34 2015 UTC,"The youtube channel doesn't have any playlists and there's a ton of videos that's not really interesting like 3 hour videos of people playing in tournament games, so the good stuff can be a bit hard to find. They have also unlisted the Murugandi lectures, so you need direct links, meaning they want you to go through their website to find them. That's just a bad move, those are good lectures and could have gotten a lot of views had they not done that. They have a lot of good pro lectures from years back. I have organized what I consider the best lectures here: http://learnbaduk.com/baduk-resources.html"

The Orion's Belt and Milky way fuseki are similar to Bwilcox's great wall fuseki b ut instead of being through the center, they run along a side.

baduk,37r3rx,shikadsapo,3,Fri May 29 19:09:08 2015 UTC,Sounds like fun! If we could find out what Orion's Belt and Milky Way fuseki look like we could have a galactic showdown!  the bottom of this page is what where I heard those names  No luck in finding them yet XP

baduk,37nela,Mikuro,1 point,Fri May 29 09:11:27 2015 UTC,"Many years ago I wrote a neural net-style go AI. I didn't program in the rules, exactly, but I did write in a bit to exclude illegal moves and go with the AI's next best choice. I'm not sure if your model ranks all moves or simply produces one, but if it ranks several, you could graph how many choices you need to reject by move number. Ideally the graph should skew downward from generation to generation.  It's not so different from teaching a small child. If they play somewhere illegal, I just ask them to take it back and choose a different place."

As for the original line, capturing instead of extending to the first line is a fundamental tactical idea that you should study carefully. There are joseki where you do it, even not right against the edge (and thus allowing the opponent to atari and make the ko shape). The common idea is that the descent gives the opponent a free sente move (putting the single stone in ko-atari is not as forcing)."

baduk,37fnzc,Thuruk,9,Wed May 27 19:43:42 2015 UTC,"This is cool, though I'd be also very interested to see Haylee vs An Younggil. He's probably not coming to the congress, but maybe sometime over the interwebs."
baduk,37fnzc,guruPanda,2,Wed May 27 08:42:27 2015 UTC,They came to Seattle together a few years ago.  I saw them just play '5 in a row' against each other but no go.  :)
baduk,37fnzc,oren740,5,Wed May 27 17:00:14 2015 UTC,"Not much of a contest if it's even. Should put some handicap to make it interesting. I don't think a team of similar ranked players makes one much stronger, if at all."
baduk,37fnzc,nikkentobi,5,Wed May 27 08:45:29 2015 UTC,it'll be a learning experience!
baduk,37fnzc,nokes,2,Wed May 27 08:54:50 2015 UTC,I kind of want to see a drunk match between you and Nick.
baduk,37fnzc,Breitschwert,3,Wed May 27 20:24:46 2015 UTC,"i'm sure that'll happen at some point.  On camera, at least... it's already happened plenty ;)"
baduk,37fnzc,4698468973,4,Thu May 28 01:08:10 2015 UTC,I'd like an even game. It is much more enjoyable to watch and can be more easily understood I think. You play a game with handicap stones if you want to make it challenging for both players. I guess it depends on what Haylee would like to do.
baduk,37fnzc,hqrpie,5,Wed May 27 12:32:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, me too. It'll be valuable just to hear Nick's thought process against a stronger opponent, and to hear Haylee's response. I don't want one side or the other to win so much as I want to learn from their game play, so an even game would be better."
baduk,37fnzc,Luidesys,3,Wed May 27 18:34:33 2015 UTC,I'd prefer an even game as well. Keep in mind that live-commenting is already a burden !
baduk,37fnzc,Breitschwert,2,Wed May 27 15:45:19 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't. The strength difference is large, it won't be much of a game unless Haylee goes easy. I also disagree about handicap games being challenging for both players, how exactly is taking handicap stones more challenging than an even game?"
baduk,37fnzc,revolvingdoor12,3,Wed May 27 20:04:34 2015 UTC,"Handicap games are more difficult for the person that has to play against them, because the opponent has a really high advantage in points already on the board. I don't want an even game, I basically want to see how Nick can improve by Haylee pointing out the mistakes in his normal play. That wouldn't be possible in a handicap game, it would be mostly tactical mistakes there, as the white player has to catch up."
baduk,37fnzc,FrobisherGo,2,Wed May 27 20:43:18 2015 UTC,"I agree, even with the strength difference it will be nice to see and hear the thought processes of these two players in-game - what they expect and don't expect from their opponent, how they react to certain moves, etc. Hearing ""I would have moved towards this corner if it wasn't for black's handicap stone"" or ""I can invade here because my handicap stone provides some extra strength"" is a bit less helpful for us as observers... That said if they want a balanced game then they're perfectly entitled to that. Maybe they could do both?"
baduk,37fnzc,Blandis,3,Thu May 28 01:31:53 2015 UTC,"It's funny because I remember Dwyrin/Battousai saying a while ago that he asked her but she didn't seem interested - this was before everyone knew who she was. But I remember Nick said he made her theme song for her, so this must be her way of showing appreciation!"
baduk,37fnzc,4698468973,6,Wed May 27 12:23:50 2015 UTC,It's also possible that the AGA realizes that they're two of the most popular go YouTubers and wants to attract more attendees.
baduk,37fnzc,gamedrifter,3,Wed May 27 13:50:49 2015 UTC,"Not just the AGA; Nick recently posted a video imploring his watchers to be ""ambassadors for Go"", helping to increase the popularity of Go in the U.S.  Getting three of the most popular Go celebrities from YouTube together seems like a pretty smart move."
baduk,37fnzc,dwyrin,1 point,Wed May 27 18:30:44 2015 UTC,"I think it's a little more than that too. This is an exhibition show match designed to be entertaining and educational, and promote Go, it's taking place at the major US Go event of the year. She seems very busy between her streaming and the work she does with the IGF and probably gets challenged a lot due to her status as a pro that also streams content.  I wouldn't be surprised if she makes a habit of turning down all requests unless they are set up in a special situation like with one with Nick."

baduk,37h6oc,slugsnot,8,Wed May 27 16:37:19 2015 UTC,"Similar strength here. my mindset for 4+ stone games is to give the opponent as many opportunities as possible to make small errors. For me this means avoiding well-known joseki that settle positions and being patient enough to win points later in the game. Remember that in a 4 stone game you will make up points middle game and endgame. Even in the late endgame you will make up points.  Michael Redmond's book, ""ABCs of Attack and Defense"" has some ideas for 4-stone games, by the way."
baduk,37h6oc,cazique,3,Wed May 27 18:04:53 2015 UTC,"Yep. The best way for white to win in a handicap game against me is to give me enough rope to hang myself -- which I will dutifully do, over and over and over again.  Invade 3-3 and then use a slightly less common variation? I'm boned. Count the board early and use influence to develop moyo that will be just too tempting for me not to try to invade? I'm boned. Play an ""attack everything, live everywhere"" strategy? I'll fall for it, and I'm boned."
baduk,37h6oc,4698468973,1 point,Wed May 27 18:25:05 2015 UTC,Both of you have given me solid advice. Won several games in a row. I compiled your ideas with a few of my own and came up with a very strong strategy. Thanks!
baduk,37h6oc,aletheia27,2,Thu May 28 09:29:01 2015 UTC,"Personally, if the game is 4 stones or less, I find it's not too difficult to win from simple mistakes from my opponent, like direction, shape, and balance of positions. But if it's over 4 stones, then I feel like using reading strength to get an edge is a better approach.   My current AGA is 3D but it's lagging behind from lack of recent games. I consistently beat AGA 4d players and tend to match AGA 5d's although there's a lack of them around here."

baduk,37il7m,4698468973,1 point,Wed May 27 22:21:59 2015 UTC,"Does gokibitz have a way to add variations?  I've added some comments. I'm only around 8k KGS currently, but they should do until a stronger player comes along."
baduk,37il7m,ralgrado,1 point,Wed May 27 23:52:02 2015 UTC,I think 5 stones difference is great for comments. You should be able to point out the most important mistakes while stronger players might still add things it would be too much imho.
baduk,37il7m,guruPanda,1 point,Thu May 28 11:32:09 2015 UTC,"Your biggest mistake easily is to take gote when you could tenuki. Examples are moves 15, 17 (amove in the corner might be appropriate, but an enclosure on the right would be much better), 21, maybe 29, 31 (you have the ladder, why connect?), 75, 77, the list goes on. Review your own games for instances like this and learn when to tenuki when you can. That alone will gain you three stones easily. Then I would recommend reading ""Attack and Defense"" by Ishida to know what to do with your Tenukis ,and you'll be SDK in a heartbeat :)"
baduk,37il7m,leonprimrose,1 point,Thu May 28 10:57:39 2015 UTC,"I looked through the game quick. My advice to you is to keep an eye on the whole board more. After every move that isn't part of a natural sequence ask yourself: ""Is this move sente"" for both your moves and for your opponent's. Basically, the old urgent vs big discussion. First, are your groups safe? Second, is the move that either you or your opponent played sente? (if you play it does your opponent need to respond. If your opponent plays it, do you need to respond?). Lastly, is there a move on the board large enough to take gote for? (Would I be willing to hand the reigns of initiative over for this particular move and how can I justify doing so.)  The solution to this is lots of tsumego really and some playing around with shape and attack and defense. Lessons in the Fundamentals is always a good book to dip into for some basics and ideas. Remember, initiative is important :)"

baduk,37h7i0,itstoearly,2,Thu May 28 10:01:46 2015 UTC,"If your opponent plays a non joseki move, and you don't know how to punish it, then you should invest in some joseki books that take the time to explain the reasoning behind the moves in joseki sequences.  Once you understand why joseki moves are what they are, then you will know why your opponent's move is bad, and from there it is easy to punish."
baduk,37h7i0,zaccbruce,1 point,Wed May 27 19:19:50 2015 UTC,"Any recommendations? I've never really looked at joseki in any detail myself. Robert Jasieks books on joseki have caught my eye.

baduk,37h7i0,Thuruk,1 point,Thu May 28 07:31:25 2015 UTC,"I suggest leaning on the D4 stone. Depending on how he responds, if at all, you can take the corner or seal him in for influence."

baduk,37fk7w,gmarcel,1 point,Sun May 31 09:55:51 2015 UTC,"As said, the author said that is not true, it only affects the time it takes for the bot to make its move. If the bot has to make his move in a certain amount of time, then the hardware matters greatly.  I am running on a i7-4700HQ cpu @ 3,3-4GHz. On max settings, cs takes as long as it wants for a move, sometimes over a minute or like 1 million playouts. On lower strengths it basically caps its time to think. On the settings where the bot and you have byoyomi there is no strength settings at all since it all depends on the hardware at that point."
baduk,37fk7w,sundaay,1 point,Sun May 31 12:19:57 2015 UTC,"If it's hardware independent it will be capping the number of playouts, not the time to think as time to think is hardware dependent.  edit sorry just seen you are talking about crazystone and not champion go!"

baduk,37d7rt,Edoexplosivepawn,3,Tue May 26 20:37:36 2015 UTC,There is a way to kill the corner without a ko. So that's a better solution.
baduk,37c6sq,IMKR1,4,Tue May 26 15:34:36 2015 UTC,"Do you have any example games where this occurred? We can definitely give suggestions for specific situations.  Many times, surrounding a position and keeping it small is the best way. An effective reduction is really just about limiting your opponent's ability to expand their framework. Anything more than this is an invasion. Perhaps it is invading frameworks that you are hesitant to do?  It's a little hard to give generic advice here. There are about 10 different ""standard"" reducing moves, and each is useful in a different kind of situation. There is a great book on it called ""Reducing Territorial Frameworks"" by Fujisawa Shuko, but it's aimed more at the 5k-1d level."
baduk,37c6sq,mkmatlock,2,Tue May 26 16:26:22 2015 UTC,Do you know a good pro game i can watch that shows good use of invading and reducing?
baduk,37c6sq,SickWilly,3,Wed May 27 04:43:18 2015 UTC,"Without seeing any games it's hard to tell, as others have mentioned. There are 3 basic moves for reducing (emphasis on basic), each applicable in different situations. They are the shoulder hit, almost always against a 3rd line stone. This is biased toward one direction. The cap, again against a 3rd line stone. This unbiased towards direction. The last move is along the ""sector line""  on the edges of your opponent's moyo. This is a lighter reduction than the others.  There are many more moves for reduction, but typically you don't need them until higher ranks. So I emphasized the basic ones.  However, if you're getting to the point where you can't find a way to reduce effectively, maybe you're waiting too long before trying? The most urgent reduction, or invasion is when your opponent only needs one more move to make an area secure territory. But often times it's correct to reduce before then so it never grows to the right size."
baduk,37c6sq,Thuruk,2,Tue May 26 17:25:52 2015 UTC,Maybe you're just too slow. Try to deny your opponent the framework by playing there before he makes it so strong that you don't know how to attack.
baduk,37c6sq,iopq,2,Tue May 26 18:08:13 2015 UTC,Watch how professionals invade frameworks and either escape into the middle or live inside. They're usually much lighter and sacrifice stones to make their invasion sente.

baduk,37b91s,Zwejhajfa,2,Tue May 26 10:52:19 2015 UTC,"And he wasted a liberty which might hurt if white ever gets a chance to cut at P15.  But I think in this case it's even better to play Q15 in response to the wedge, because I think it will capture the black stone, destroying black's dreams of surrounding white. At least I don't see what black could do against that."

baduk,3797rb,nate451,1 point,Tue May 26 16:41:45 2015 UTC,"I've been meaning to make ""How to study pro games"" my video of the week for a while now. Last week I wanted to do something relating to handicap games and this week I wanted to do something short and fun.   I wish I were stronger so I could lead the discussion more, but I wish I were stronger for a lot of reasons. My very first game, I picked one that was very straightforward, so it would be easy enough for anyone to follow. The problem is, it wasn't the most exciting game since there wasn't a midgame to speak of. It's hard to know what people want and harder still to go out and find a game that fits that, which is part of the reason I crowd-source. I picked an old game for this week in hopes that it would be a bit less overwhelming.   I hope people ask questions when a move doesn't make sense to them, but I understand that it can be hard to even know what question to ask."

baduk,375bb8,Chaosduck7,8,Mon May 25 00:32:16 2015 UTC,"It's not the sheer number of games you play but rather the effort you put in that helps you improve. There are people who can play a dozen games a day but still never improve, if their moves are quick and thoughtless and they don't go over their mistakes. It sounds like you're putting in a lot of effort if you're mentally exhausted after each game, which is good. Keep at it, and don't play more games than you want to.  To answer your question, on a typical go-playing day I play about three games if it's online, or just one if I'm at my go club."

I can play a ton of games online if I'm not putting the effort into reviewing and learning, or I can play one and get mentally exhausted just as the OP describes.  The only thing I'd add to the above is to remind the OP that it isn't worth trying to strive to be like someone else. Instead strive to be like the you you want to be. Shoot for small incremental obtainable goals and eventually you'll get to where you want to be. Look to people already far ahead of you and you'll always be playing catch up."

baduk,375sgk,superponible,3,Mon May 25 03:05:07 2015 UTC,"B8: you didn't have to play that move. No need to defend there. W7 was a very poor move and it was your chance to ignore it and grab a big point.   B26 should have been at C3. Did you misclick there? Playing at c2 makes a week, weird shape.   I think B44 was a great move - expanding and erasing what little influence W got on the bottom. It was clever.  I sorta understand B46 - you are trying to build a moyo in the center - but it would be better, I think to not get fancy and play a simple block at K3 instead and then double hane at the head of 2.  With moves up to B60 black is trying to get lots and lots of center influence, which would be nice, if black's shape wasn't so awfully thin and vulnerable. B60 is a bad move: you make an empty triangle - a bad shape - while forcing the opponent to atari you. It was a very self-destructive play. You are harming yourself with that move. Better to defend at J10, or to block at K3, or anything else, really.   With B68 you sacrifice a bunch of stones to get some influence towards the center. I think it was really good if that was the intention!  Move 76 is important, because it reveals an important problem. With W75, white is threatening to either 1) capture a single stone or 2) to destroy your nice bottom right. (Unfortunate turn of phrase there.)  To prevent white from capturing 1 stone, play at L4. To prevent white from ruining the bottom play M3.  You can only play one of those things, so you have to decide - which would be worse? To lose 1 stone, or to lose about 15 points of territory? It's really obvious if you put it like that, right - who cares about 1 stone, save the gazillion points with M3! But in the game you get scared: ""oh no, he wants to capture something, I better stop him before he gets 3 points there!"" and play L4 and lose the entire bottom as a result. Sometimes you have to abandon stones, to make sacrifices.   B154 was very big, and good. B makes lots and lots and lots of points with it.   W254 was not good. You just pressed ""pass"" by playing that move. What would be better? Anything on the bottom left that threatens to enter W's territory - F1, for example. Q1 would also be better.  In fact, you play there right after, which is good! But it would be so much better if you didn't waste a move and played there immediately.   Why was B300 ever played? Or B296? B302? You played inside your own territory, destroying 3 of your own points for nothing."
baduk,375sgk,Tasty_Yogurt,3,Mon May 25 11:33:49 2015 UTC,"I would recommend you work on good shape.  Move 48 - 54, Black creates really bad shape because there are so many cutting points, White has a load of forcing moves to make Black play bad moves. A diagonal connection is a good shape, but when one of the empty diagonals is filled, it needs to be connected on the other, otherwise it becomes a weak shape.  Move 56: A hane introduces a weakness. When you play a hane you want to know either that you have a way of dealing with this weakness if your opponent uses it against you, or you know you will get enough compensation is it is used against you.  Black's hane at move 56 doesn't get anything, it adds another weakness to Black's Group.   Move 60: You have probably been told not to make an empty triangle, I am not going to say, don't make an empty triangle. I am going to say, If you have to play an empty triangle, ~10 moves ago you played a bad move. So as long as I'm telling you not to do things, I'm going to say, don't play a bad move 10 moves ago.  Back to the empty triangle, Look at that group of stones, how many liberties does Black's empty triangle have? 2.  What if white plays at F10? Now it has 1 liberty, lets say Black Connects at E9, Now what if White plays at D11, Black has lost 6 stones, white has made territory and all his stones are connected.  What if Black had not played the empty triangle? on Move 60? White could not cut at F10, because the stone at F9 has 2 liberties, Black can just take away one of white's F10 stone's liberties. And Black has won the capturing race. This cut does not work.  The move 60 means white has to play at G7 to connect his group, this also puts Blacks stone in atari.  Black has forced White into making an ok move. it not only connects White's stones, it threatens Black's stones.  If Black wants to save his stone he has to play H6, but the shape he has made isn't good, this group only has 3 liberties.   Move 63: White now uses some of those forcing moves, due to Black's poor shape he made during moves 50 - 54, now Black can't play to save his black group at H6, move 65, puts another of his stones in atari, another forcing move... Black saves his stone.. And white gets his 3 stones group instead with move 67.  Because of Black's poor shape White can cause a lot of mischief, so when you play your stones, you need to make sure they are easy to connect, easy to defend, and are as strong as they can be. Otherwise White can do things like this...  If we look back to move 48, What was Black's goal here? To try and block White in? But this move has a weakness at G8 which white takes advantage of, this move then leads to a lot of plays which lead to bad shape and a bad result for Black.   Lets say that Black's bad move that lead to the empty triangle and other bad shapes is move 48.  What better moves are there for move 48 to achieve the same outcome. Are there any good moves to block White in? Or should Black play somewhere else?  There are lots of good shape lectures on the internets, so find one, watch it, and think about why those shapes are good, and when you play a game, think about playing those shapes, when you consider a move, think about moves that will make good shape, are those moves, good for you, will they help you achieve a good result?"
baduk,375sgk,IMKR1,3,Mon May 25 15:03:04 2015 UTC,"To prevent white from capturing 1 stone, play at L4. To prevent white from ruining the bottom play M3.

It's really obvious if you put it like that, right - who cares about 1 stone, save the gazillion points with M3!   to add to this, after you realized your mistake of saving 1 stone and losing bottom right, you shouldve played O3 instead of O2 at move 80. it would have stopped white from getting couple points more."

baduk,375qdw,nedlt,2,Mon May 25 06:13:54 2015 UTC,"I agree that if you treat the current black moyo border as territory it looks kind of even. The problem with influence though is that it is not territory, it only threatens to take territory. If white can get in some invasions and reductions (which there's still plenty of time to do) then things start swinging massively back towards white.  Good moves for white? F12, H6 (Maybe I6 for someone a bit stronger than me), not to mention a walk along the middle line which black would have to block while letting white build up a strong wall facing the top right, and the TR corner is still in doubt. Personally I think the killing atari at C11 is actually quite large, although again someone stronger may not see it that way...  Just my 2c, the point is that I think white has quite a few good moves to swing things heavily in his/her favour and black couldn't possibly block them all to make all the territory s/he's threatening..."
baduk,375qdw,revolvingdoor12,1 point,Mon May 25 08:26:38 2015 UTC,"I think if white just plays the 3-3 point in the top right he can hardly lose. Even if this isn't the very biggest move, there is just not enough points on the board for black to catch up."
baduk,375qdw,guruPanda,1 point,Tue May 26 23:31:14 2015 UTC,"If we look at the actual game, we can tell that white is able to destroy almost all of blacks territory. Even though white only wins by 3.5, this is only because black was able to hold on to his large moyo near the bottom right, everything else becomes tiny."
baduk,375qdw,DoitiEtok,1 point,Mon May 25 14:30:56 2015 UTC,"White is far ahead in territory. Black has influence, but turning influence into territory heavily depends on sente.

baduk,375qdw,guruPanda,1 point,Tue May 26 23:28:12 2015 UTC,"To me, it looks somewhat even. Black has the potential to make more points than white but white has a lot of opportunities to reduce. Although if the person saying that white is winning is a strong player then I won't argue with him."

baduk,372dcj,eksert,7,Sun May 24 05:54:34 2015 UTC,I should add that we're only playing the centre 12*12 of the board.
baduk,372dcj,eksert,4,Sun May 24 05:56:08 2015 UTC,"That changes a lot:) Black stones are dead if it's white turn. A group can live if it has 2 different eyes. In other words if you can only kill a group by playing 2 stones at the same time it is alive. Check diagram 10 at http://english.baduk.or.kr/sub02_02.htm?menu=f12. White cannot move at ""m"" or ""n"" if he does not kill any stones."
baduk,372dcj,seriousmurr,2,Sun May 24 06:02:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your explanation. My opponent still has a bit of confusion about eyes. He feels that because the black stones at the bottom have liberties around them, thay they should not be captured. Sorry if this seems painfully basic, but could you please respond to this confusion? Thank you again! We're in China, but none of our friends can answer our questions."
baduk,372dcj,blue1_,4,Sun May 24 07:01:25 2015 UTC,"Ultimately whether a group is alive at end of game is not determined by liberties, as those can be reduced, but the eyespace they surround and if they can make 2 eyes for themselves in that space."
baduk,372dcj,Teraka,3,Sun May 24 07:06:43 2015 UTC,"Deciding if a stone is alive or not at sight is just a shortcut, and besides both players must agree. If in doubt, just continue playing."
baduk,372dcj,Thuruk,1 point,Sun May 24 08:10:06 2015 UTC,"Well, calling stones dead before they're captured means that even if the defending player plays perfectly, he won't be able to save the group.  Right now the stones are still on the board, but as long as you don't make a really bad mistake or just let him play without blocking him, you'll eventually capture those stones. That's why it's useful to consider them as dead either for counting score without having to actually capture all the dead stones on the board, or for him, for realizing that he can't save that group regardless and should just start playing elsewhere instead."
baduk,372dcj,blue1_,0,Sun May 24 18:36:08 2015 UTC,"Technically, if you're using Chinese rules, you could just play it until all his stones are removed from your territory. In practice no one would do that if both sides agree that stones are dead.  In Japanese rules, in case of such a dispute you'd play it to the end and then return it to the disputed position for scoring, since you'd need to fill in your own territory to remove a single stone."

baduk,3728ix,revolvingdoor12,2,Sun May 24 04:33:05 2015 UTC,"Hey I'm not very strong but there is no way that white can kill black that I can see. This shape doesn't actually happen very often tho, because white will get thick walls on either side in sente, and black will live will ~10 points, so even if black lives the result heavily favors white. Because we usually start in the corner, and it takes 3 moves to surround the a start point, usually black will respond before this can happen."
baduk,3728ix,Quothe2,2,Sun May 24 05:13:58 2015 UTC,"yeah, black can live, but white gets a lot of thickness.  alternatively, white would spend multiple moves killing, so black gets 2 moves minimum elsewhere on the board.  I don't see this as great for black though, unless some of the areas that would be affected by white's influence are settled already.  EDIT:  A lot of the moves you made seem like they'd make good Ko threats, too.  Especially the P4 move, since white can lose those two stones if he doesn't respond."
baduk,3728ix,Tristamwolf,2,Sun May 24 05:26:17 2015 UTC,"Black q2 threatens to connect underneath, and is a good place to start. If white tenukis, then black doesn't need to play again either. If white keeps black split, then r6, r7, r5, q7 will live, but white will get very strong outside."
baduk,3728ix,StationaryNomad,2,Sun May 24 07:14:36 2015 UTC,"I am pretty sure that black R3 on the 3-3 point lives unconditionally, with correct play.  Black R6 should also either live or escape unconditionally, on the board shown.  If there are surrounding positions that might complicate things, but if the nearby area is pretty open this should be fine and gives white fewer forcing moves to become thick.  Actually I think there are a lot of moves for black that would live here.  I feel very confident saying ""black can live in a variety of ways.""  Example board"
baduk,371m3x,Orc762,2,Sun May 24 00:41:47 2015 UTC,"Each move threatens to capture. Consider Diagram 2. If black ignores then white B captures. In diagram 3, black answers at 6 because white's atari would be too good a result for white. I don't really see a better result for white. If you are still confused, then you should give us more information like the variations you are reading out."
baduk,371m3x,Ornable_,2,Sun May 24 01:33:35 2015 UTC,"I don't have the book here, but I'm assuming that it is a black tesuji and that black is driving white. The key to the driving tesuji is a shortage of liberties. Look again at your refutations. Did they fail to create more liberties for white, but instead attempt to go back and capture a stone? Now, as black, don't save that stone, instead see if you can counter atari. After white picks up that stone, you probably have another atari that will make white fill the spot where your stone was. This move will also make your shape stronger. You may need to add a final move to settle your shape, but that's okay. For a small sacrifice, you turned a weak group into a strong one.  I hope this helps."

baduk,36zrzx,johanka5,9,Sat May 23 15:05:17 2015 UTC,"it really helps me   No, you think it helps you. Honestly, given your grade and the low quality of score estimators, it's probably more of a mental crutch than anything else. I wouldn't be surprised if you often resign this way when in reality you had a fair chance of winning.  Some people will call it cheating, but I don't see that it really matters in that sense. It's more important that you should be confident in yourself - you don't need these tools, and even if they tell you something you don't know it's not that important. If you're not certain you're irreversibly behind, keep playing - if you're wrong, never mind, your positional judgement will get better.  You also say it's hard to count, especially when it 'looks even', but I think you're too focused on an exact number here. Unless it's near the end of the game, you can't count that accurately anyway, and if it 'looks even' that means the game is probably reasonably winnable even if in some abstract terms you have a small disadvantage."
baduk,36zrzx,show111,5,Sat May 23 15:14:59 2015 UTC,"thanks for pulling rne back into reality. i need to start counting at one point either way, and this substitute won't cut it. it's just that when i get nervous, i get really nervous.   i guess it's also bad that i'm a datafreak. if something knows something i don't, i'll start thinking that i need it, because more info = always good.   however, since it isn't that accurate, as you say, and i can't do this in speed go, i'll learn how to count.   i'll go over the various methods at SL when i have some time.   thank you for your input. i appreciate it greatly!"
baduk,36zrzx,hikaruzero,5,Sat May 23 19:34:08 2015 UTC,"More importantly than whether it can be considered cheating or not, I fear that by relying on a score estimator (which usually isn't very accurate until the endgame), you're hindering your own development by not learning how to count.  It would be wise for you to stop using the score estimator anyway, since depending on it will inhibit your improvement.  It is important to learn how to count in order to improve your judgment.  As for whether it's cheating, it depends on each person, but personally I wouldn't care.  The reason is, score estimators are typically pretty awful at determining the score.  They are completely worthless in the opening and early middlegame, and only start becoming useful in the late middlegame.  The endgame is the only phase where using a score estimator can be called ""accurate,"" (and even then, actual counting is always more accurate anyway) but by then, the game is basically already over.  So really, it just tells me, ""my opponent can't count, neither can the score estimator, therefore I have a really big advantage because I know how the flow of the game needs to proceed and my opponent has no idea.""  So it's kinda like ... does handicapping yourself count as cheating?  Lol.  Imagine a game of baseball where instead of a human batter, you could use a robot batter.  But the robot batter only has a batting average of .050, while the humans are up in the .200 to .400 range.  Can you really call shooting yourself in the foot ""cheating?""  :)  If using a score estimator is ""cheating,"" then it's a total failure of a cheat because it gives you literally no advantage whatsoever, it's like wearing drunk goggles to a police checkpoint thinking that because you are drunk and they are goggles they will help you see better.  Rather than ""cheating"" I'd call it a ""mistake."""
baduk,36zrzx,hikaruzero,1 point,Sat May 23 16:39:04 2015 UTC,"yes, that's true. at one point i need to start counting, so better get it over with then. sigh :P it's not the aspect of the game that draws me most.   haha, if people were betting on the match it might count as cheating if i handicapped myself.   i'll go over the various methods described at sensei's library soon, then.   thanks for your input!"
baduk,36zrzx,4698468973,1 point,Sat May 23 19:27:02 2015 UTC,"Yep, two things you will need to embrace are reading and positional judgment (which includes counting).  Both of them are fundamental skills that, together, enable effective play in a generic way.  Not sure if you're familiar at all with RTS games, but more and more I regard these two skills as similar to the RTS concepts of ""micro"" and ""macro"" respectively.  Micro (short for micromanagement) in RTS games is a measure of how well you position and use your units tactically to maximize their effectiveness.  In Go, the primary driver of tactics is reading ability, which can be honed by practicing tsumego problems and learning tesuji.  On the other hand, macro (macromanagement) in RTS games is a measure of how well you manage your economy so as to out-produce your opponent on the large scale, as well as developing available technologies to allow for producing units that are more strategically effective in combat.  In Go, positional judgment is a fundamental strategic ability that allows you to analyze the results of positions and conflicts (preferrably before they happen!) and make your positions/stones work together, increasing their efficiency.  In RTS games, micro and macro together are often referred to as ""mechanics,"" and top players have very highly-developed and finely-tuned mechanics, allowing them to play high-level games with creative strategies and robust tactics.  Similarly, in Go, players who can both read out positions and also judge them effectively are also well-enabled to play high-level games.  There is a well-known professional Starcraft 2 player named Destiny who once put up a series of 16 videos where he demonstrates a certain point about mechanics in the game.  In the first video, he explains that most of the advice he gives to lower-level players that take lessons with him is to just focus on mechanics, and he feels that choosing the right strategies is much less important.  In the series of videos, what he does is he chooses a highly ineffective strategy (mass Queens, which have diverse abilities but are slow and not combat-effective) and then works his way up into higher leagues using this handicapped, inflexible strategy just by out-producing and out-micromanaging his opponent.  The point he tries to prove is that mechanics are more important than choosing the right strategy, when it comes to being good at the game.  I feel that reading and positional judgment are similarly important for playing well in Go.  When you look at, say, a 9-stone handicap game between, say, a dan-level player and a double-digit kyu (DDK) player, there should be no way that the dan player can win, but he does anyway simply because he has so much stronger reading abilities, and such a better understanding of the resulting positions, that he doesn't need to fight battles starting from a favorable strategic position, his skillful reading and judgment abilities allow him to achieve a good result anyway.  Anyhow, this is how I've come to see things with Go, and a lot of times when I give advice to weaker players I tell them to just do tsumego to improve their reading ability, and to focus on mastering the most basic strategic concepts, and to learn proverbs and their exceptions.  I also find myself encouraging learning how to play out of joseki.  Once you can read deeply and understand both why and when some positions are better than others, then we can talk about the nuances of joseki and choosing the right fuseki or middle-game strategy, and other higher-level concepts.  Hope that helps!"
baduk,36zrzx,gamedrifter,2,Sat May 23 21:02:50 2015 UTC,"The sooner you start practicing counting, the sooner it will start benefiting you in your games. How are you going to count a game if you're sitting across a table from your opponent? What if you're playing blitz and don't have time to load the game in another window?  There are about 60 points to a side. There's 15 points in each corner, and 15 points from the 4-4 to the side's halfway point. So you should be able to glance at a game and get +/- 20 points really easily. 20 points is a big margin of error, but it's a start. From there you keep practicing and getting faster and more accurate.  Counting helps you make more critical examinations of the whole board position, helps you decide which moves are more valuable than other moves, helps you notice groups that are in danger (or groups that you can threaten).  And since I started focusing on counting, I've lost four ranks..."
baduk,36yrp4,eksert,3,Sat May 23 06:44:54 2015 UTC,"The approach in response to the orthodox formation has become quite popular in the last few years. The easy way to explain it is to say that the approach is ""more active"" than the wedge move.  The more complicated explanation is that black can pressure a move like k17 from m17 and build up a moyo along the right side by pressuring the corner."

baduk,36z1mm,IMKR1,4,Sat May 23 09:23:42 2015 UTC,Here is a review I made.

baduk,36z1mm,Tasty_Yogurt,3,Sun May 24 01:44:19 2015 UTC,"W12 could be at D6. I can't say C6 is wrong.   After B13 I would be pretty unhappy, because I would want to do two things at the same time: I would really, really want to play D8, because if I let black play C8 I would get surrounded and feel really bad, but at the same time I would want to play something like K3 to give my pincering stone a bit of a base, because I don't black attacking it and getting points out of it. In the game, W plays L3 and makes a 3 point extension. Why a 3 point extension, though? I doesn't feel safe.   With a sequence up to B23 white connects his stones, but this is a good result for B, black's position is strong.   W26 at Q12 looks really strange to me. Why put a stone on the 4th line, why not on the 3rd? It's much easier for the 3rd line stone to make a base and live. Was there an idea behind this? I'd play it around R10-R11.   After B27, I think everyone's first instinct would be to play R12. You could get to hane at the head of 2 stones this way. Backing off to Q8 feels really strange. You may think you are getting a base for yourself, but you are still undercut by R13 stone.   I think W32 is just bad. That's not how you protect your group. A move to protect would be R12, but a 2-point jump up is too thin. You are still very, very vulnerable there.   I'd probably play move 34 at D8 and get out of there. The push and cut you are trying to do there should not work at all.   What did you intend to do with W52? It's such an unexpected move, I don't see what it was meant to do.  W142 at J10 was a mistake, because black goes right through. I should have been at H11 if you want to hold on to the rest of the center.   W176 at S8 wasn't necessarily a mistake. B would get to connect no matter what.   W210 at G5 is a mistake, you pretty much played a pass. Stop playing stuff like that and you will gain several ranks.   W224 at O2 is juicy and big. It is in sente, and you get to steal his points. It should have been played earlier (instead of awful stuff like W210, for example) before B gets a chance do defend there and prevent it."
baduk,36xu21,IMKR1,1 point,Sat May 23 00:40:39 2015 UTC,What game? There is no link. Facing a direction means the direction a stone or stones wishes to expand. In other words its primary direction. For the 3-4 this is typically the direction where the natural approach is(or enclosure). I'm planning on doing a video about the direction of play in the opening actually :P
baduk,36xu21,acceleratr,0,Sat May 23 01:04:53 2015 UTC,oh wow i fail lol.  i put link in
baduk,36xu21,acceleratr,2,Sat May 23 01:27:16 2015 UTC,"All the 4 opening moves have a clockwise primary direction, meaning each of the 4 stones wishes to extend to each own side, making all the sides equally big."
baduk,36xu21,cinemabaroque,1 point,Sat May 23 03:09:45 2015 UTC,"Essentially he is talking about the direction of play that is most important. At this stage in the fuseki that means the widest side.  For example, if black enclosed in the upper left white would have many good options on the left side. A Chinese style advance around the left side star point would be my first instinct but even a small or large knights shimari in the lower left would be good as the low stone would counteract the influence from black's enclosure."
baduk,36xu21,hikaruzero,0,Sat May 23 02:14:11 2015 UTC,"When he says ""facing,"" he's talking about the natural direction of play that the stones set up.  Consider the lower left corner move, a 3-4 move.  No matter who plays in that corner next, you can expect that play to be on the left side of the board rather than on the bottom side of the board.  If black plays, he will approach from the left side, and if white plays, he will enclose toward the left side.  So the stone can be said to be ""facing the left side"" in terms of the direction of play, since all the most effective moves in that area are on the left side of the board.  Note that the direction of play can change quickly -- for example, if white enclosed that corner, the enclosure would now be said to be ""facing the bottom side"" since the most natural plays relating to that enclosure would be on the bottom side of the board.  There is also a related fuseki pattern called ""facing 3-4 points"" (Japanese: mukai komoku; Sensei's library discussion) where two same-colour 3-4 points face eachother.  Again, like with the above, they are said to be ""facing eachother"" because the natural move for either corner and either player will be ""toward"" (on the same side as) the other corner.  Hope that helps!"

baduk,36vzfx,mkmatlock,3,Fri May 22 15:45:41 2015 UTC,"I'm a big proponent of handicap games and I think you point out a big reason why I think they're good for learning in that it puts you in positions where you either have to play from behind as white or take advantage of strength as black. Anyways, my thoughts on this -  I think once you get to around 4+ handicap stones, you're essentially waiting for your opponent's mistakes. With this in mind, it's generally good in my opinion to jump around the board a lot, leaving as many positions as you can open-ended. You don't know what the payoff from any opponent mistakes will be (maybe you get a big wall, maybe some fourth line territory, key here is that ""mistake"" is not necessarily killing a big group), so you want to be able to make the choice when it actually happens. Following from this, if I'm playing from black with handicap, I like to play super solid and spend extra moves to ""kill positions"", basically locking down local results before anything bad can happen later. Purely anecdotal, but there seems to be an intimidation factor at play when white is jumping around a lot, there's this pressure for black to follow him around, even when it's not 100% necessary too.  Of course, the fewer handicap stones there are, the closer it gets to a standard game. You can probably play pretty close to your standard style in a 2-3 stone game and be okay. In this case, something like giving up sente when black didn't have to would make up 1 stone difference, so you would just need 2-3 to essentially get back to an even game."

The second is to avoid well known joseki and get a presence in several places. As more stones are played your opponent's advantage grows proportionally lesser. This seems to work okay. The third is to cut and fight from the beginning, trusting in your superior reading. This is most fun. :) I'm sure you'll get more suggestions."
baduk,36vvx6,leonprimrose,3,Fri May 22 15:16:45 2015 UTC,"From the beginning (just a few main points):  S4 should be at O2 probably. In the game white became really and you still didn't really have the corner because white could clamp at S2.  O7 is okay, if he haned like you showed, just N8 and connect after, separating the white groups. Or you can atari as you showed and then atari the other way (N8) and then connect.  K15 is really bad. If you want to play at the top, M17 is a good move because it extends from your corner and threatens to undercut white's group. White should have played k17 instead of k16 in the beginning.  E8 is better at D8.  You tried a bit too hard to kill the bottom left white group; should have just blocked the corner and let white live small. Instead you lost a ton of points (at least 7) in the corner.   The J17 variation at move 137 sort of works (it's ko actually), but even if white just plays M17 after L18 and then plays G14 after you connect the top group, black still comes out the worse end of the trade. Bottom line, G17 was not good.  P13 instead of R9 is better. White should have just linked the group up with P13 after R9 probably.  If you play P13 instead of S7 it seems like you can kill the white group. Basically P13 N13 Q10 and white is short liberties.  Concerning your  M8 F9 variation at move 211, after F10...E10 F8 G8 F9 G11 G10 G12 H10 J11 J10 E12 J11 L11 and you are dead.  It seems like you tried to be a bit too fancy in this game. Attaching on top of 4th line stones is usually bad unless it serves a very special purpose. It's fun to experiment and all, but imo it's better to stick with moves you understand, and when your reading gets better you can justify playing fancier tesujis. If you try to play too many fancy moves ""for fun"" they're probably going to be bad unless you've backed them up with proper reading and calculations (don't worry I suffer from this too). At least when you try them in a game, make sure you read out viable sequences within the game rather than just playing something because it looks like something you read out of a book or saw in a pro game. You were in byo-yomi for a while though so I guess it's excusable."

baduk,36tacc,leonprimrose,7,Thu May 21 23:06:28 2015 UTC,"P15 surrounds the corner completely and connects your stones, that's a pretty great result for white."
baduk,36tacc,sharkweekk,4,Thu May 21 23:13:03 2015 UTC,Exactly. P15 gives white a superb result with black completely sealed in and white's stones being incredibly thick. In an even game at the mid dan level this result would pretty much mean that white would win. The only time this would be ok for black is if it were late middle game and black already had very thick positions on the top and right sides to negate the potential that white gets. Even then it would almost certainly be better to come out and separate white into two groups and just capture one of them.  Black does much better to just play P15 after the second approach than to attach on both sides which just needlessly strengthens white.

baduk,36tacc,NoLemurs,6,Thu May 21 23:23:04 2015 UTC,"It's really worth remembering that a lot of the time there's no need to do anything to benefit from a joseki mistake; the resulting position is its own punishment!  P15 is definitely called for here, just because it makes your stones so magnificently strong, but the real issue with the joseki for B is that he's spent 4 moves to make only  about 15 points and no influence. If this has happened even remotely early in the game, that alone is a catastrophe for B."
baduk,36tacc,cinemabaroque,2,Fri May 22 01:03:08 2015 UTC,"This is so true. Often there is no way to punish a joseki mistake outright, the punishment is that they're lacking potential or are 5 points worse off than the common pattern."

baduk,36tacc,fzztr,2,Fri May 22 17:04:32 2015 UTC,"i'd say the best way to utilize this aji or respond is to leave it for later.  black is already living relatively small and weak in comparison to white's influence being built, and if black takes the time to fix here, white gets to put those moves into development elsewhere.  Also, white has two different 2 stone walls that could potentially be used to make some solid side territory here.  Either way, I feel very happy with this result as white."
baduk,36ss3i,leonprimrose,15,Thu May 21 20:49:09 2015 UTC,"I wrote a long answer to this question here a few years ago: https://gogameguru.com/how-to-get-better-at-go/  Do you mind if I ask roughly how strong you are? The answer to this question depends a lot on your level.  For example, until you start reaching the low kyu levels (say 3k-ish) you'll likely gain more by solving mostly tesuji problems, with a smaller proportion of tsumego (try 80/20, for example). As you improve to low dan level, and start to feel pretty confident with most tesuji problems, try gradually changing mix to about 50/50.  If you're fairly serious about improving (it sounds like you are) stick with a routine for at least 2-3 months so that you give yourself enough time feel whether it's working. Even if you're at a level where it takes a long time to improve by one stone, you should start to feel the increased fluency and clarity in your game after a few weeks when your study is working. If it's not working for you, experiment with the balance between games/problems and tesuji/tsumego.   Consistency from day to day is very important, especially if you don't have a lot of spare time (like most of us here, I imagine). Even 15 minutes a day can do wonders, as long as you're consistent. Consistency is also the biggest challenge.  You want to learn in the fastest and most efficient way possible, so, unless you're already a high dan level player, ignore advice about only studying games without commentaries, never looking at the solutions to go problems and studying mostly tsumego. That kind of approach to study can work, but is mostly for players who are already near pro level, already have a good understanding of most techniques and have a lot of time to study every day. That's probably not you, or most of us here. So allow yourself to learn from finding out that you got a problem wrong, you'll discover a new technique and that's what solutions are for.  Unfortunately people have a tendency to take specific advice on improving (which is usually aimed at fairly high level players) and generalize it to players of all levels. This is sad because parroting the same (mostly inappropriate) advice to everyone retards other people's progress and makes them become frustrated. Some people sink a lot of time into a particular approach and then try to justify it by forcing it on everyone else, even if it's not working that well. You cannot argue with such people. Advising beginners to solve tsumego is the epitome of this (seriously reddit? they should be playing games and having fun). It's better to take advice from those who've actually walked the path to wherever you want to go, rather than following second and third hand knowledge.  Other stuff is covered in the article above and Benjamin and Sorin's articles (which Mef linked to) are also helpful. This is another good take on improving: http://www.mechner.com/david/go/improve.html  The important thing to understand is that some of the advice in those articles and elsewhere is mainly for people who are training to become pro. It's not one size fits all. So, by all means, try an approach for a couple of months and then review how it's going. Don't get emotionally invested in any particular approach to the point where you can't let go. The time you've already invested, whether you got the results you wanted or not, is a sunk cost.   One of the benefits of being serious about improving at anything is that it helps you learn how to learn. That takes time and the best approach isn't the same for everyone if academic research is to be believed.  EDIT: Fix 'autocorrects', thanks phone!"

For the former, The Endgame by Ogawa and Davies is quite good.   For the latter it depends a bit on why you're resigning but the usual books that people probably recommend (Attack and Defense, Get Strong at Attacking) might help.  It also depends on whether you're resigning because you pushed your advantage too hard (e.g. tried to kill everything and failed) or your opponent did a whole lot of crazy stuff and you weren't sure how to deal with it.  If you feel like you might be overplaying, The Way of Creating a Thick and Strong Game is a book all about playing the 80% move rather than the 100% move. The idea is that you can still win with 80% moves as long as you're consistent, and it's less risky.  If you're more having trouble navigating your way through the game, Catching Scent of Victory is a book that some people swear by. The author comments about 20 of his games, but covers the different phases of play as their own topics in different sections.  Also, have you watched Hajin's videos on Youtube? She might help you to figure out what you should be thinking about at different stages in the game.  Hope this helps :)"

baduk,36q3im,zaccbruce,4,Thu May 21 08:08:34 2015 UTC,"Okay, take this with a pinch of salt, because this is fuzzy fuseki science; but the way I see it, these particular walls have a weaker (single stone hane) end, and a stronger (3 stones in a row) end.  When facing each other, there is a large distance between the strong ends; and accordingly there is a lot of room in-between for the opponent to invade and fight in. The resulting situation will often be that about half of your moyo turns into territory, while the other half will see a wall coming under an uncomfortable counter-attack, due to how flimsy it actually is here with its two cutting points.  Non-facing walls take into account this slightly more pessimistic take of the situation. While its direct potential territory is less huge in scale, having one of those 3-in-a-row stones nearby provides stronger support for the inevitable fight that will ensue. It's more flexible in the sense that you're more likely to be able to dictate the flow of the game from there on out."

baduk,36my7d,Phhhhuh,1 point,Wed May 20 17:29:21 2015 UTC,"Well, I've had my eye on Invincible for some time, though it's not cheap... Not sure what other ""must have"" books there are though. At some point I'd like to have Ishida's update'd joseki dictionary, but that day is a couple of years away. And those volumes are not cheap either!"
baduk,36my7d,zaccbruce,1 point,Thu May 21 09:47:33 2015 UTC,"Have you got 'Lessons in the Fundamentals'? Seems like just about everyone recommends that. 'Tesuji', 'Attack and Defense' and the Graded Go Problems series all seem to be universally agreed on. Actually, now I start to think about it, there's a heap of great books. Must try resist the urge to buy more books..."
baduk,36my7d,othkhvn,2,Thu May 21 10:01:20 2015 UTC,"I'd do a search around before making the purchase.  That being said, purchases directly from Kiseido probably support them more -- and hopefully they'll publish more.  For some reason, gogameguru has Invincible at a cheaper price normally (although you have to pay shipping).  You can usually find Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go at 10% off on Amazon."
baduk,36my7d,Phhhhuh,1 point,Thu May 21 12:18:54 2015 UTC,"I have Lessons already, it's great! I have Tesuji too."
baduk,36my7d,Phhhhuh,1 point,Thu May 21 13:49:33 2015 UTC,"Invincible is still cheaper through GoGameGuru, even accounting for the sale."
baduk,36om5d,ZXRP,5,Wed May 20 22:20:22 2015 UTC,What I sometimes do is keep my hand away from the mouse / don't take a stone in my hand until I'm a 100% sure about what my next move will be. Usually this little physical distance you take is enough to force yourself to think about your moves.
baduk,36om5d,FarodinAngels,3,Thu May 21 00:18:35 2015 UTC,"A guy from the local go club who studied chess as a child said, that they were instructed to sit on their hands to not fiddle with the pieces and to move only when they have decided the move.  He still does it while playing go :)"
baduk,36om5d,pernanm,2,Thu May 21 15:42:08 2015 UTC,"Yes! That's what Tarrasch (a strong chess player) used to do, he would just rest his hands on his knees :)"

baduk,36om5d,leonprimrose,1 point,Thu May 21 08:12:14 2015 UTC,"O way to combat it other than forcing yourself to slow down. That means don't play until you've looked over a few sequences. Conversely, get better at finding shape points. How strong are you?"
baduk,36om5d,leonprimrose,1 point,Wed May 20 23:53:46 2015 UTC,I am 6k on KGS at the moment.
baduk,36om5d,leonprimrose,1 point,Thu May 21 05:29:57 2015 UTC,Alright yeah. I get how you feel lol it's just a matter of making yourself consciously aware of it while playing and stopping yourself from making moves you haven't read. Avoid blitz.
baduk,36om5d,ampersand38,2,Thu May 21 11:36:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I for sure need to stop the blitz. The problem of course is that I don't often have time for a slow game. Blitz can be a tiny bit addictive sometimes though. ""I have to end on a win"", which can take a long time to appear!"
baduk,36om5d,Mefanol,1 point,Thu May 21 17:38:02 2015 UTC,haha xD I understand the desire to end on a win. If at all possible I would say carve out an hour into a couple days a week for full games regardless of how they end. you could still do blitz but make very certain you slow yourself on these long games.

baduk,36nhmk,olosh,2,Wed May 20 17:52:49 2015 UTC,You mean like watching stronger players' games?
baduk,36nhmk,cstoner,1 point,Wed May 20 18:35:07 2015 UTC,"Not quite. I watch plenty of pro games and love to do so. But watching a full game record I only get to see the ONE possibility which is actually played out. I want to see many possibilities from the same start position, like several fail attempt paths at a tsumego before seeing the correct solution, or like several possible joseki variations branching from the same start point."
baduk,36nhmk,sharkweekk,2,Wed May 20 19:14:01 2015 UTC,There are plenty of foreign broadcasts of pro games. They usually have a couple pros commenting and they will play out variations on a demonstration board.
baduk,36nhmk,cazique,1 point,Wed May 20 20:01:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know about tsumego or joseki, but there are screen savers for playing out games: http://senseis.xmp.net/?ScreenSavers  If you had sgfs of problems (including solutions) you could load them into the screen saver."
baduk,36nhmk,jonnydomestik,1 point,Wed May 20 18:36:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, I love to watch pro games like that. But I wonder if the screensaver would be clever enough to display all the variations and paths from a problem sgf one by one ?. And downloading them all and loading them into the viewer would be a hassle. I just want to sit and watch loads of possible paths and variations play out from the same starting point, one by one."

baduk,36k8my,sharkweekk,1 point,Wed May 20 00:18:17 2015 UTC,"I have a question about the endgame of Seigen v. Hun-hyeon. What happens to the stone at T5 regarding scoring?  Wouldn't the logical move for white be T6 to capture it and thus earn another point? Or is it considered dead once both players pass? If this is the case, why wouldn't black play T6 (rather than pass) to save that stone? If T5 is not considered dead, does that therefore mean that T6 is a valid point of territory for black? (And again if so, why wouldn't white just capture it rather than allow it to make territory?)  I apologise for the wordy questions but I have seen this sort of situation in the endgame of several professional games and I don't understand why either player is content to just leave a stone there that could be captured..."
baduk,36k8my,revolvingdoor12,1 point,Wed May 20 06:27:57 2015 UTC,"Since white passes first, black fills, then white passes again. White would do this because he counted and didn't have the ko threats to take the stone."
baduk,36k8my,glitchytsuki,1 point,Wed May 20 10:32:15 2015 UTC,"But if white did not pass and instead captured, black would then have no follow up, black would then pass first, and then white could fill, leading to W+2 rather than W+1... (Or did you mean the fact that white wins regardless was the reason for white's initial pass?)  I assume therefore that in its current state, T6 is considered Dame and therefore does not contribute a point to Black's score?"
baduk,36k8my,revolvingdoor12,1 point,Wed May 20 10:54:09 2015 UTC,"Black has ko threats if white captures and black eventually wins it. Yes, you can consider T6 dame.   edit: So basically white did not take the ko because it leads to a ko fight where black eventually wins (you can confirm yourself, black has more ko threats)."
baduk,36k8my,Luidesys,1 point,Wed May 20 11:00:43 2015 UTC,"Black does have a few followups, however. I didn't count them, but they are there, so white would have to respond, and black would take back. In the end, black wins the ko, so there is no point in white fighting it."
baduk,36k8my,glitchytsuki,1 point,Wed May 20 12:03:04 2015 UTC,http://eidogo.com/#DPT6HYj5  I did a brief review of the first 80 moves of the amateur game of the week.
baduk,36k8my,Luidesys,1 point,Wed May 20 10:39:52 2015 UTC,"just joined the r/baduk and just seen this thread.  exactly how do I participate in those problems? such as the life/death problem assigned, and the one, two, three joseki problems.  i dont see where the answers are and it lets me just click anywhere"
baduk,36k8my,IMKR1,2,Wed May 20 12:54:34 2015 UTC,you have to figure out the answers yourself and you can post them here. sharkweek will provide the correct responses in a follow up thread.
baduk,36k8my,BulletD0dger,1 point,Wed May 20 15:07:10 2015 UTC,"In the pro game, after white passes, why can't black play H19 to force white to fill at F19?"
baduk,36k8my,mkdz,1 point,Wed May 20 13:03:09 2015 UTC,"Both those points are dame anyway, if you're counting manually they'd be filled in. You can verify yourself if you do a score count at the end, F19 is not included as a point for white."
baduk,36k8my,waterbucket999,1 point,Wed May 20 14:51:01 2015 UTC,"Ah, ok thanks."
baduk,36mebi,IMKR1,2,Wed May 20 13:22:36 2015 UTC,"A took a quick glance of your game, and two things stood out. First, you are overly aggressive and cutting too much, leaving yourself with multiple weak groups.  Second, you are playing responses to forcing moves, but without the forcing move being played.  For example, move 126, or 156 - why fill before you have to?  You are essentially passing."
baduk,36mebi,itstoearly,1 point,Wed May 20 13:57:03 2015 UTC,"Ah ok that make sense on the move 126 and 156 play.  could you also elaborate more on the  ""irst, you are overly aggressive and cutting too much, leaving yourself with multiple weak groups. Second, you are playing responses to forcing moves, but without the forcing move being played."" i need to see examples in my play to fully understand your feedback, as im still new, thank for the help though"
baduk,36mebi,foobar__,1 point,Wed May 20 23:27:21 2015 UTC,I also think there are too many weak groups. The top white group looks dead if black 97 is at e18.
baduk,36mebi,foobar__,1 point,Wed May 20 15:05:29 2015 UTC,that means E18 is a vital point for my group?  i was thinking i can still make 2 eyes if i go G19 or any point in the group

baduk,36ikcx,DBEdin,2,Tue May 19 17:28:17 2015 UTC,They will get oil from your hands after playing many games.
baduk,36ikcx,ashep24,2,Tue May 19 21:39:31 2015 UTC,"You can wash off the machine oil - that's bad for the board your stones will be touching. Instead just buff them; I've used jeans, and an old cotton sweatshirt, to give my slate stones a nice, semi-gloss finish that almost looks like they've been waxed."
baduk,36ikcx,fireproofpress,-2,Tue May 19 20:36:05 2015 UTC,"I've never even seen go stones irl, but i'm pretty sure the shine you talk about comes from the finish they had ( in the factory ), and not from later care or use."
