subnautica,3e1uie,FutureSynth,2,Tue Jul 21 09:06:37 2015 UTC,"If you look on the sidebar there is ""Subnautica Task List"" that is the official dev's Trello, basically allowing us to keep an eye on what they have done and doing. This game is ""single only"" though at the moment as it is still in early access, so there is that, you will be going solo, and spending a lot of time looking for resources, and I will admit, that it looks a little bad (since it defaults to low quality, need to use the F3 and F8 menus to change the graphics to at least quality 3)  However, there is a game on Steam called ""World of Diving"" that is multiplayer, it has a few more features as of this writing, it is early access as well, but I have not played it so I am working off the steam store page.  Another is ""Stranded Deep"" that appears as a less ""preset"" game, it does have diving and on-sea gameplay, with an interesting crafting system, again, I am working off the Steam store page here.  I would say if you can afford it, get all, as they are 3 sides to the same ""diving and exploring"" experience, I am between jobs at the moment so I can't afford the other two yet, but honestly, having 3 games on the same theme, when they are all Early Access means you won't get bored as quickly while waiting for new content.    NOTE: I have watched a bit of gameplay of the other 2 on Twitch and they do appear interesting, hence why I wish listed them."

Also the cyclops and bases do not require power. The seamoth can be recharged via the cyclops so unless you forget to keep an eye on your power level you shouldn't have to worry about powercells too often.

Having the tube the the same size when there is no reason to go around the ladder is a waste of space aesthetically and from a engineering view it's a waste of materials.

subnautica,3d9c4n,AtopiaUtopia,5,Tue Jul 14 14:49:51 2015 UTC,The game is in early access and not very well optimized. My custom built Vishera 8650 4.0ghz  16gb Ram R9 285 PC still gets massive frame-rate drops sometimes. (especially when I debug spawn 1000 peepers at once)
subnautica,3d9c4n,SilkSk1,2,Tue Jul 14 15:26:36 2015 UTC,"I am pretty new to PC gaming, are early-access game this laggy often?"
subnautica,3d9c4n,SilkSk1,5,Tue Jul 14 15:32:00 2015 UTC,"Yes. At this stage in development, the developers main priority is adding content and designing the mechanics, after which they will work on optimizing it all for maximum smoothness. For what its worth, my frame-rate drops are much less frequent and severe than they used to be, so it's not like they are ignoring the issue. But again, this is typical of early access games, with very few exceptions (Killing Floor 2)."
subnautica,3d9c4n,midnightblade,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:37:20 2015 UTC,"It's likely because you're running it on recommended settings. The game sees you have 2GB of video ram so it cranks up the graphics, nevermind what graphics core you have. The 840M is a decidedly low end graphics card, especially a mobile 840M so you'll likely need to adjust your settings."

I feel like this could be used to great advantage if you wanted to establish a base in said caves. I mean, it isn't really cheating since you did have to explore it to set the pipes in place. It's kind of like a giant 3D map.  Pretty nifty, imo. Nice work!"
subnautica,3coegb,Bellypunch,2,Thu Jul 9 16:40:21 2015 UTC,"At no point was any kind of cheating intended. I laid the pipes entirely for the purpose of making the caves easier and safer to navigate. I knew about the x-ray glitch (it makes lockers, fabricators and other build-able things visible through the cyclops canopy no matter the distance or obstacles) already, but I didn't know it applied to pipes. It was only afterwards that I discovered that I had revealed the caves in this manner.  Also, I already put a base in one of the caves. If you look closely at this picture, you can see the three lockers I built there."
subnautica,3coegb,Bellypunch,2,Thu Jul 9 17:10:54 2015 UTC,"Ooh, nice base. I haven't started a cave one yet, but it's on the list. Didn't mean to imply you were cheating, either. I just meant that using the pipes with the mapping idea in mind wouldn't be cheating, not to me anyway. Actually, it's a darn good idea. I've been using dive reels as markers, but I'll be trying the pipe system on my next expedition.  EDIT: Adding a bit I forgot. I didn't actually realize the x-ray thing was a glitch. It's been present since I started playing the game, so I just figured it was intended."
subnautica,3cpsis,jakenice1,3,Thu Jul 9 20:16:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, play it. Just spend a few days exploring and doing whatever comes to mind. Get a Seamoth, build your Cyclops, explore everything, build a real base, then build a colossal absurdity of a base just for fun. Play with your tools until you break them, then build some more. Lose a Seamoth in the jellyshroom caves, get chased by the damn demon eel things, run out of power and escape with a seaglide, then mount a heroic rescue of your beloved Francois...not that I've ever done this or named a Seamoth...cough  Best advice for getting up to speed is just play. Fake it 'til you make it, that sort of thing. See what the game has on offer already, then see what's coming. Work backwards. Trying to catch up on early access games with an active and growing community is like trying to catch a cat: much easier if you're in front of it. I'd suggest the trello board, and this sub, but you already have those resources so that would be no good. I'm certain someone else can give you better advice, probably more useful advice too, but this is the only method I know of that works for me.   EDIT: Do not ever stand in front of a rampaging cat.

He started to hear it only to look up and have it diving down near him when it kept out of the water. The game then conveniently spawned 2 more near him and he had 3 reapers all snaking their way straight for him 50m away. All he could do was hide in one of those large coral tubes until he ran out of air.

subnautica,3c4o3j,Aquareon,6,Sat Jul 4 19:17:25 2015 UTC,I'm thinking on-base hydroponics.  The Aurora was a colonization ship.  It was surely filled with all the things necessary to start a colony.  There would probably be seeds on board somewhere.  The exploration of the Aurora really needs to be expanded in a big way.
subnautica,3c4o3j,eightbitbeard,2,Sun Jul 5 03:58:45 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Your base should be good enough for simple, hydroponic systems. I think they might want to add another base structure for this, though, as the current pieces are too narrow. Maybe a larger, rectangular room to place plants in."

There's also /r/submechanophobia, which is like the other but more centric on machines. Subs, oil platforms, that type thing.   The aforementioned fears are more than likely what gets to you about the game. I don't think the devs went in trying to build a scary game, rather they built a vast underwater world, and individuals brought their fears into it. The open sea is a creepy place, and the further down you go, the more you feel it. Crushing weight all around your little safe bubble, light fading as you descend. Anyone with a rational brain would begin to fear at this point, simply because you have no clue what's floating just beyond your lights. Is it a fish? A whale? The kraken? Can't know. That said, the game is spectacular. I can't wait to see more gear, upgrades, base structures, and expanded biomes. We have a ways to go, and right now our scope of gameplay is a bit limited, but it won't always be. This is one of those games that gives Early Access a good name.

subnautica,3c1h0m,SilkSk1,2,Thu Jul 9 13:47:45 2015 UTC,"I might be on a different version. Both my cyclops and seamoth experience hull compromise at 200m depth, cyclops collision damage begins at 100m for me."
subnautica,3c1h0m,TaiBoBetsy,2,Thu Jul 9 18:33:47 2015 UTC,"Maybe. Here's what it's like for me.  Cyclops takes crush damage at -100 meters. Alarms blaring, leaks appearing, the whole mess. When I added the hull reinforcement module, it increased the limit to -900 meters. However, I still got notifications about unsafe depth (-125 meters) and maximum depth (-300 meters). But they were only notifications. Safely ignored. No such damage appeared.  Likewise with the Seamoth. It currently has no depth limit. No impact damage, and no crush damage. However it still gives the unsafe depth and maximum depth notifications that can be ignored."

If you like survival games that are difficult because of other players and dinosaurs, and want to play with friends, then ARK is really good. I've been playing that a LOT lately and the amount of friends that play with me helps a lot. Not to mention the devs for ARK update it almost once a day with a big update almost twice a week!  Subnautica is also good, but more of a solo survival exploration game than anything. The downside is that its very unfinished at the moment and there isn't a whole lot to do after a certain point except digging for the lava biom.  That being said though, its definitely worth looking into both in the future as they both have great devs that know what their game needs.  If you want my personal recommendation, I'd say go with ARK as there is a whole lot to do and explore with constant updates. I think the devs stated that they already have 300+ hours worth of content already in the game.  TL;DR Ark is a great investment, but be aware its multiplayer and you can get raided and whatnot."

That was back when Assassin's Creed II was released, and they patched it away after it sparked an outrage. Even broadband can be shitty, and having the game stop just before you finish a mission just because TWcast doesn't provide you the service they should is just frustrating. If you have a laptop, then you may move around and play in places without available internet. Or you're switching ISPs and you're suddenly unable to play a single-player game. The requirement to be online was a stupid DRM design and I'm happy it's gone. I'd reckon that a ton of people just pirated the games in question because of that.  What I am talking about is the requirement to be online in order to feed your dinosaurs and defend your base from other players. While there is a PvE mode, I do not like having no endgame other than building bigger bases, taming more dinosaurs, and killing the broodmother. Having some sort of system that makes griefing in absence impossible would be best. Then you could still kill othet players or have tribe wars."

subnautica,3bz46q,angrydroid,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:12:45 2015 UTC,There's a difference between preference and bias. You can prefer one thing over another but still give an unbiased advice about them.  Essentially what they're asking for is honesty. I love subnautica and think it's going to be an awesome game. But I'm brutally honest about its shortcomings when recommending it to others.  You don't always see that. Just a few days ago on Steam someone said they had a very tight budget and were asking about sub's longevity / replayability. Several responded - quite dishonestly I feel - that the game is currently great on both counts.

What happened in your case does sound a bit screwy. I've had less extreme experiences. Like if I save while on the cyclops I find myself outside of it after reloading. It used to be (but I thought they'd fixed this) that the seamoth wouldn't save if docked with the cyclops. It's all just part of pre-release bugginess.  There is the console, though.

Go exploring, set up some bases. Have you set up a base in The Jelly Cave? The Dry Lava Bed? Built a thermal powered base near a heated lava tube?  Or draw your own map.

It's the only way I use cheats - and I really like it because otherwise it is pretty impossible to use the sub because you have to continually build so many power cells!  And if you are doing that fabricating on the cyclops, it takes. Like 15 power to make a power cell which gives you ~15.  Ugh!  Anyway use it to explore the map a bit more.

subnautica,3ao0uv,Shtankyhangdown,9,Mon Jun 22 02:25:15 2015 UTC,"Pros   The first game that's ever accurately captured the ambiance of snorkeling/diving for me. Utterly stunning and immersive... I vividly remember my first sunrise/sunset. Perfect mix of alien and familiar aesthetic. I love the relatively clean futuristic look and feel. At times, terrifying. Definitely as bad as the time I met the Leviathan in Mass Effect 3.   CONS   The crafting tree feels a bit thin, still. Aside from the fancy stuff required to build the Cyclops, most other resources can be easily found in 20-30 minutes. I want to crave things I can't afford, and spend hours getting the resources together I lose my sense of direction a lot, which makes it harder to find new biomes. I would love some kind of in-game map (maybe it could be a high-end craftable item or multiple items, and it would have to be a map you'd fill out yourself as you go). (The big one): once you've spent a few hours with the game, survival is super easy. Food and water are abundant, and the predators are mostly happy to leave you alone if you stay out of their way. That's fine if you want to use it just as a sandbox and build amazing underwater bases and explore, but I like my sandbox with a big dollop of survival on the side.

That's mostly a matter of play-testing, but also giving the player the ability to overcome them over time would help. They would also give a greater purpose to building multiple bases - having somewhere to sleep nearby could be really useful."
subnautica,3ao0uv,Doglatine,3,Mon Jun 22 17:44:15 2015 UTC,1) Good development transparency (see sidebar).  2) The stunning surroundings and the ability to go on for hours discovering new places if you take it slowly.  3) Pretty concept art.

It could be next week. Macworld is abotu Mac support, and new world areas.  After Macworld, we tentatively have an update planned called 'Moon Pool.' This update would include Moon Pool, Observatory, and Generic Room components for bases. Much 3D art has already been completed for these components.  The timing of Moon Pool is, like all Subnautica updates, very uncertain. I could be two weeks after Macworld, it could be four, or we might change tack and do something else instead of Moon Pool. Assuming it is between two and four weeks after Macworld, and assuming Macworld arrives this week or next, Moon Pool could arrive between the second and final weeks of July."

subnautica,39hosh,Thor_PR_Rep,4,Thu Jun 11 20:00:19 2015 UTC,Airsack fish can be turned straight into water. Only replenishes 15 hydration though. Craft a skinsuit or whatever its called to passively produce water in your inventory. It makes staying hydrated something like 75% easier because all you have to do is occasionally check your stuff.  Also you used to passively heal. Now you have to use first aid kits made by using kelp as bandages and bleach I'm pretty sure.
subnautica,39hosh,kezdog92,4,Thu Jun 11 23:24:40 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you need to take a good look at what you can make in the fabricator. Find something that sounds interesting and craft it. The suit (not the radiation one) /u/kezdog92 mentioned is a great one to make, it periodically puts water in your inventory which is super handy.   When you have your inventory open, take a look at the blueprints tab. You can add blueprints by putting fragments (cream coloured boxes found in different biomes) in the fragment analyzer on the escape pod.  Find a cosy place and build a base using the builder (found under 'tools' at the fabricator); bring lots of titanium. I personally like to build my first base on the border of the Kelp Forest and the Grassy Plateau biomes, both those biomes are nice looking, and there's often a large, deep cave in those areas. Just remember to bring a beacon with you so you can find your base again.  If you want to explore, you'll need a Seamoth or a Cyclops (Seamoth is more practical I think). To build a Seamoth you'll need a fragment of it analyzed. Check what else you need for it in the Blueprints Tab of your inventory.   To heal, you need to make a first aid kit which, if I remember correctly, is found in the same section as the knife.  I hope what I talked above is the kind of stuff you were hoping to hear!  TL;DR: Thoroughly look through what you can make with the fabricator and check out the Blueprints. Then build cool stuff (they'll eventually take you places)."
subnautica,39hosh,peaceandturtles,2,Fri Jun 12 02:40:14 2015 UTC,Salt turns into Bleach which makes water. You have to catch fish and cook them to heal and restore hunger.

It can also kill them if thrown into objects enough. Also try the stasis rifle/knife attack.  You CAN tame stalkers by feeding them but it is difficult to pull off without getting chomped first. All they do is become passive to you and attack whatever else attacks you in their area. They DO NOT follow you however. Basically guard dogs.  Unsure about how they are going to fiddle with the environment. They are implementing biome/species eggs and some sort of science system involving DNA, biological analysis and study subjects we don't know about yet.

The level of consciousness and awareness of what you're actually doing is so low that for you it's okay to do it.  I don't expect you to change your ways or for me to have any difference in the way you view things but I wanted to force the concept into your head that behaviour akin to that isn't accepted among people who actually value each other and their needs and interests.  I hope you come to see the benefits of not shunning others even though you may not like them entirely, I hope you see the peace and resolutions it can bring you which so many strive to achieve, I hope you live a good and happy life, buddy, but I will not tell you that the way you currently percieve others will bring about anything other than self-loathing and loneliness."
subnautica,38tp6y,Bellypunch,-6,Mon Jun 8 02:05:36 2015 UTC,"I'm well within my rights to dislike someone based on their personality. Is it better if I found another reason? You seem to dislike me based on my personality, yet I don't hold that against you. Maybe you feel a need to defend someone by telling me about my own inadequacies, which are based on nothing except your own conclusions. I agreed with another person, who also felt dislike for the video creator. Why not target them?   Why should I not distance myself from the people I don't like? Should I be more open and accepting, and simply deal with other people when I don't have to? To what end? So I can sit at my desk and tell people how wrong I think they are, and why it would be better for them to not judge? Isn't that being judgmental? So I can pretend I'm making the world a better place by talking down to others in a way that looks positive? You don't have to like anyone. You don't have to put up with anything. Roll over and deal with things you don't agree with and call it acceptance and tolerance? I don't believe the world would be a better place for it. I believe we'd all be better off if everyone said what they actually felt. Instead of using phrases like ""I'm not going to tell you..."" and then telling me, why not just say what you want to say? I'm not going to insult your intelligence by saying that's a ridiculous way to do things and makes you look pompous. See how that works? It's a form of passive/aggressive behavior.  You don't like my opinions, and you think without people like me, the quality of life would be improved all around. The feeling is quite mutual. The world is a place where you aim to find like-minded individuals, and bond with them. You have not found that in me, and for some reason, it seems to bother you enough that you had to explain yourself to me. Countless people do this every day, and it baffles me. Why go to so much trouble to argue that your negative feelings against me are justified, but it's wrong for me to not like others? It doesn't matter. In the end, nothing does. In a couple of days, this thread will be buried, and neither of us will give the other a spare thought. I can't stop you from arguing with me, so do whatever you feel you need to. But next time, just be a regular person and tell me to die in a fire. Don't analyze me, and don't try to make me feel inferior."
subnautica,38tp6y,Foolski,-1,Mon Jun 8 02:39:00 2015 UTC,". But next time, just be a regular person and tell me to die in a fire   What??? No! If you think that's a normal way to interact with each other rather than discussing things to form a mutual understanding of each others point of view then I don't know what to say.  I don't want to live in a world where everyone is like-minded, I want to live in a world where everyone has the fundamental patience to listen to each other rather than just hate one another because they don't have the understanding of the other point of view, let alone give time to achieve it.  If you don't like someone or something then sure distance yourself, but your comment isn't distancing yourself from the video creator, it's just hating him because he isn't what you like. I don't either expect you to be tolerant of everything or everyone, but again that wasn't just intolerance, it was sought out agitation.  My first comment was made in blatant disgust and you're right, I didn't have to make it, but at the time my disgust overrode my clear thinking. I'm sitting here now knowing that if I try to bend the will of one I have to bend the will of them all and I can hardly pretend to accomplish that by myself.  What do you mean in the end nothing matters? As in life? I don't have quite the same thinking but mine is somewhat similar. I believe that we should enjoy and experience it as best we can, for me that means filling my life with love and joy, not telling people to die in a fire on the internet, what a dark existence that would be.  I'm going to bed as it's late, I sincerely hold nothing against you, I sincerely hope you have a good life and live carefree.  Night."

I liked the air tank upgrade (the higher storage one, I didn't understand the lightweight one - I thought it would take up less slots...). The hot knife was cool but once it wore out I just went back to the regular knife. The workbench in general is a great addition, I can't wait to see more stuff. Beacon labels are fantastic.   I'm waiting for more of a reason to explore. Exploring was awesome when I was still discovering new things that were functional (like lithium), but now I'm just bored because I've exhausted all the content. I'm looking forward to having new stuff down near the lava vents.  I've put ~20 hours into the game so by no means am I bothered that I've 'exhausted' the content - in fact I'm surprised at how much gameplay I got out of an alpha!  Keep it up!"
subnautica,38tr2b,artard,4,Sat Jun 6 19:39:43 2015 UTC,"I agree, the sense of exploration kind of wanes after you see everything, and as long as the world is entirely static, that will never change. Even after new content is added, you will exhaust it at some point.  Really, if the developers are dead set on keeping a static world, there still should be procedural elements to keep the sense of exploration there. I mean, static entrances to randomized caves, for example, or random shipwrecks and seabases scattered about.  I think the best idea though, is to have procedural terrain outside of the static map. Start the player in the static map, so they can see the aesthetic the developers are going for, but outside of that map, have procedural terrain so that the player can never ""exhaust"" the content, and can keep exploring outwards."
subnautica,38tr2b,Arsonide,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:42:13 2015 UTC,"I assume the lightweight tank helps lessen the impact the tank has on your swimming speed (I hadn't noticed, but I read that tanks make you swim slower)."

The heat blade is practical for long trips without the Cyclops, never tried the diamond one. Also I'm pretty sure the lightweight tank isn't working as intended, but the high cap one is pretty useful. With the Seaglide the faster swimming fins don't seem useful enough, the electric ones are way more useful even though they don't recharge much.  I love the workbench potential in general and the beacon labels, makes it so much easier, just need color on the bleeps now :p  Oh and I use the Cyclops doors way more than I should..."
subnautica,38tr2b,arziben,3,Sat Jun 6 20:28:50 2015 UTC,I don't even use the seaglide anymore. Much prefer to just swim with my 150 cap tanks. Takes up less space.

subnautica,37ig89,Kylel6,4,Wed May 27 21:37:21 2015 UTC,"Pheromone cloak.  You use an upgraded transfuser (or a different tool altogether from the workbench) to harvest pheromones from creatures, and apply them to the cloak/suit. On a button press, the pheromones activate over ~5 seconds and the creatures you borrowed the pheromones for will  perform differently towards you, EG: completely ignore you, run from you, or follow and protect you as if you're their young for a set duration. Once it runs out, you need to harvest more and the creatures will catch onto your scheme.    May not work on all creatures.  Examples:    Harvest and apply pheromones from certain plant life, and peepers will swarm you making them easy to capture and eat.  Harvest spike coral pheromones to use, and they'll ignore you and stop spitting at you.  Harvest stalker pheromones, and trick stalkers into thinking you're a female stalker. Stalkers will then bring you scrap metal in attempt to impress you with their nest-building skills.    Could also perhaps use this as a way to cause certain, previously unavailable creatures to spawn. For example, say female reefbacks are 3 times the size and have some sort of biological material you require. Some sort of fuel, some sort of whatever. Reefback milk is an insanely potent power source. I don't know. You need to harvest different kinds of DNA and pheromones, chemicals etc. to generate the perfect scent in order to attract one.   Once you've done that, apply the scent in an area where reefbacks usually are, at perhaps a certain time of night, and a huge reefback will come running... which you then do whatever you need to do in order to get the material you need.   ...Unfortunately, the great Sea Emperor considers female reefbacks quite the meal.... You never know what else will smell the scent you use. See where I'm going with this?"

Imagine having 10 terraformer fragments, and the terraformer fragment would get that 10x upgrade AKA bigger terraforming capabilities or more specific capabilities (adjustability)...

subnautica,371njs,Mr-Lumpy,1 point,Sun May 24 13:08:35 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. I stocked up my cyclops with supplies and resources including cooked fish. I was planning to go as far a I could, in search of the island or whatever it is. After hours of preparation and storing huge amounts of cooked fish and water, along with 17 Power cells and plenty of metals, I was off. About 35 minutes of exploring later my hunger was low. I went into my food locker only to find rotting fish. That's what killed me. Hunger."

Or maybe they have more ""shiny"" parts, because you know, It's a lot darker in there.    New vehicles.   What I mean by this is that, maybe we can make little things like this guy. Maybe you can enter that thing and go around the bottom of the ocean.  More Submarines would also be cool. An smaller one, with maybe more speed.   New animals on the island.   The title says everything. More animals, maybe Amphibians, or some kind of birds.   More biomes.   I know there's an Ice one and a Swamp one coming (And the Lava one of course).   New kinds of islands.   With different flora and animals, maybe without Floaters beneath it.   Weather.   Not only weather, but also waves."

I'm imagining a little Seaglide-sized rover with a very small (4x4? 3x3?) inventory, useful for scouting and quick expeditions, with limited video feed. Of course, they'd have a fairly short battery life and be relatively expensive, so it'd be best still going and spelunking yourself, but they'd be nice for scouting."

subnautica,371opi,TheBlueRaja78,6,Thu May 28 01:16:16 2015 UTC,I think the hallways are the right size if we had rooms to connect them to. Refrigerators is a brilliant idea.
subnautica,371opi,Orion246,2,Sun May 24 03:21:31 2015 UTC,"Refrigerator : titanium 2x >glass> wireling kit  Power is drawn from local power source, (generator or cyclops engine)  When power source  is 1% or less food will start going bad. The more refrigerators you have the faster the drain.   Large room: titanium 6x (2x by 2x wide) (1x= 1 window/reinforcement option) no power drain.  Sleep/medical: large room > 2 advance wireling kits >  titanium 3x > glass 1x > silicone 1x Medial/sleep rooms have same design as large rooms but have a pod taking up most of the room centered. Used to restore health but advances time of day by 12 hrs. Food and h20 requirement is NOT affected. (If Food and H2O are both 60% when entering, they will be 60% when exiting) Power IS requiored and drained from base power generators. Not an option in cyclops.  Edit: grammar is hard when drinking"
subnautica,371opi,adhoc92,2,Sun May 24 04:50:44 2015 UTC,I'd just be happy if we could stick a big glass dome on our bases and use it as an observation deck or some kind of underwater greenhouse.

subnautica,371opi,streex321,3,Sun May 24 03:26:05 2015 UTC,"More creatures. I know they already have a rather extensive roster of beasties but more is always better. Maybe keep the teeny fish like the peepers or garryfish near the surface and the deeper down you go, things get bigger and more predatory. Like something that can eat the reaper leviathan as a light snack.  Also a few more submarines would be cool, like a mining/drilling sub that you could use to gather materials or a sub with some sort of weapon on it to protect you from the aforementioned hellbeasts."

subnautica,371opi,indu777,2,Tue May 26 04:35:49 2015 UTC,"Stackable Items. Recipe Break Down Sub Menus.  These are my main complaints. I love the game otherwise.  Stackable items because the basic ingredients for a power cell, a very important item once you expand your tech, take up 10 slots. (Copper x2; Acid x6; Quartz x2). Sure you can synthesize them But when you're out collecting it is a bit hard to do.  It doesn't even have to be as extreme as Minecraft (x64). It can just stack up to 10 or 15.  What I mean by a Recipe Break Down Menu is something along these lines.  When you hover over ""power cell"" it shows what you need. (silicone, battery x2)  It would be nice if you could hover over Silicone or battery and see what you need to make those items.  For example I could go to Seamoth>powercell>Silicone>Quartz x2  If that makes sense."
subnautica,371opi,Rex_Marlowe,2,Sun May 24 03:22:27 2015 UTC,Stackable would be great. I had 12 lockers full of stuff in my cyclops before my map reset

subnautica,36rx6u,Tiro1000,7,Fri May 22 02:38:01 2015 UTC,Terrible idea. Another bullshit mechanic to babysit. IM good with having to already baby sit calories and hydration
subnautica,36rx6u,Juxtaposn,-1,Thu May 21 17:48:17 2015 UTC,The game is too easy for me as is.
subnautica,36rx6u,Juxtaposn,8,Thu May 21 17:59:53 2015 UTC,"Its not supposed to be hard, its supposed to be fun. Adding mindless mechanics to take care of just wastes my time and patience and detracts from the actual purpose of the game; to build and explore"
subnautica,36rx6u,ProfessorJonesJr,2,Thu May 21 19:01:02 2015 UTC,"There's more than one ultimate purpose for the game, that's why there's three gamemodes.

subnautica,36rx6u,peaceandturtles,4,Fri May 22 05:53:12 2015 UTC,"Like a lot of the others I think fatigue could get old quick (maybe just add it to another game mode?).   But it would be sweet if sleeping could heal you, or something like that. Maybe drain your calories and hydration so it doesn't get abused."
subnautica,36rx6u,Coillscath,6,Fri May 22 01:04:52 2015 UTC,"I think this is the best answer. Don't tie sleep to a fatigue stat, instead make it another way to heal besides first aid kits. That way you have a good reason to rest up at your base after an excursion in order to save on first aid kits."
subnautica,36rx6u,dragonfyre173,1 point,Fri May 22 12:06:26 2015 UTC,"I like Skyrim's way of handling sleep. It's not at all required, but when you do sleep, you gain the Well Rested buff. This game's analogue of Well Rested could be something like a 10% swim speed buff for an in-game hour or two. Nothing major, but helpful."
subnautica,36rx6u,TheBlueRaja78,2,Tue May 26 04:38:24 2015 UTC,that sounds like a good idea. It would be cool if it increases health. Could use a battery or fuel cell to function
subnautica,36rx6u,dhoooorm,2,Thu May 21 17:47:30 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of fatigue a lot, as survival seems a bit meh currently since I don't have to really do anything except eat.

The project lead might decide 'too bad lets move this unready feature on the next release'  or may decide its worth changing the new target date a few days ahead.

subnautica,360x3f,SovietTesla,5,Fri May 15 04:03:28 2015 UTC,I definitely hope so. People can be incredibly creative with mods.
subnautica,360x3f,WigglenatorYT,2,Fri May 15 07:26:08 2015 UTC,Specially in a exploration game like this one. Look at Kerbal Space Program. It has added tons of things to do and tools to play with.  Also both KSP and Subnautica run on Unity which is a very mod-friendly engine.
subnautica,360x3f,ours,3,Fri May 15 11:07:15 2015 UTC,I think if Subnautica does release mod support the game would probably get ten times more terrifying XD Imagine what some of these people could come up with.
subnautica,360x3f,WigglenatorYT,2,Fri May 15 12:43:19 2015 UTC,You mean like a super massive predator in the open ocean capable of swallowing the cyclops with a reaper species living like a remora underneath it to pick off your seamoth as you try to escape?
subnautica,360x3f,irishyoga1,2,Fri May 15 13:43:25 2015 UTC,In a sense yes. At like 1000m deep there should be a huge sea monster with such capabilities. Have it be like the only one and make it like to were you have to escape it somehow if it does swallow you. XD
subnautica,360x3f,WigglenatorYT,2,Fri May 15 14:26:47 2015 UTC,Have little creatures actually living inside it that you have to deal with as well
subnautica,360x3f,irishyoga1,2,Fri May 15 15:08:44 2015 UTC,"Ahh yeah, that would be awesome. XD Like have crabs and bleeders and stuff in there. Have to get a small sonar beacon because you wouldn't be able to see in the bile of the stomach."

subnautica,360pkk,kalon9999,3,Fri May 15 02:48:06 2015 UTC,Mine sank when I dropped some red gem disks in it. Did you drop any items in it?
subnautica,360pkk,Mendrak,3,Fri May 15 06:50:19 2015 UTC,"No, just loaded the game to see a black sky (it was daylight illumination in the water) and no escape pod. I freaked out, then looked down. There it was.  Of course, neither the dragline nor builder actually work now, so my dystopian paradise is ruined."
subnautica,360pkk,Mendrak,2,Fri May 15 08:33:27 2015 UTC,"I noticed all my stuff wasn't working too (air tanks, flashlight, builder etc) but if I built new ones they would work. So I dumped the old ones and made new ones."

subnautica,360pkk,henderman,1 point,Sun May 17 10:21:12 2015 UTC,"Perhaps it could be an event that happens a preset time after you start a game, like the aurora explosion.   Basically, about 5-10 days after the aurora explodes, a terrible storm comes through, with rain lighting, and huge waves. The storm causes your escape pod to become damaged beyond repair, and sink.  So you have to either build a cyclops / new base by this time, or somehow figure out how to do so afterwards. Would add a bit of forced progression, don't you think?  EDIT: you would be warned a little bit beforehand, like the explosion."
subnautica,361646,WigglenatorYT,5,Fri May 15 05:49:02 2015 UTC,It would make sense to increase the danger as we go deeper so bigger and more dangerous deep sea beasties are a must.

The Oculus Rift provides an approximately 100° field of view, stretching the virtual sea world beyond peripheral vision.The player's view of the game is no longer boxed in on a screen and is only limited by what their eyes can see.

subnautica,35blfn,Forceflow15,9,Fri May 8 19:19:39 2015 UTC,It's the best pre release game I've played. It has enough to make it playable and fun without it feeling too beta-ish. And it'll only get better.  I bought it to overcome my fear of the deep ocean. It's made me braver but I still panic and scream like a little girl.  Buy it if you want adventure in the depths of an endless ocean. But be wary of a couple hang ups here and there. Other than that it's just a great project to support in development.
subnautica,35blfn,HearHimHearHim,4,Fri May 8 20:17:14 2015 UTC,"Just as one small correction, the ocean is not endless, it has been mostly mapped. I do not know what the final plan is for random generation or whatnot, but for the moment there is a finite limit to what you can explore.   EDIT: a word"
subnautica,35blfn,goingbananas44,2,Sat May 9 02:02:52 2015 UTC,"You're right. But honestly, without a map it seems endless and starting off it REALLY seems endless.  Though it may be mostly mapped, technicalities make for a boring game. :)"

subnautica,353f66,ours,3,Wed May 6 20:25:50 2015 UTC,"Sweet I'm glad they gave us a choice.   I made all the vehicles, most of the tools, got the more important blueprints, upgraded my cyclop's armor, have a huge amount of resources including 14 bars of gold.  I ventured into the deep abyss where the bioluminecent fish linger littered with hot air vents and bone sharks, and every minute of two I found myself saying, ""goddammit I just ate a big eye like one minute ago and I need more food!?"" Way too many times.  I would love if they could adjust the rate of depletion, because for how far I got, It felt more like a chore then survival to be honest. I mean, could you imagine how morbidly obese you would get eating that much, that fast?"

Second game though was fine. Had plenty of time to get everything I needed for the suit.   Still haven't worked up the courage to go to the wreck yet.

subnautica,34ent7,NickRowan,2,Thu Apr 30 21:14:09 2015 UTC,"The Aurora cannot be explored before the explosion.   Rather, the explosion will rip open the front and you can use the ramp up to get into the belly of the Aurora (alternative: an underwater tunnel)  Also, don't stray too close, as the explosion can kill you."
subnautica,34ent7,ScanianMoose,2,Thu Apr 30 22:03:32 2015 UTC,"The ship explodes and then radiation covers a large area around the ship. Your life pod is safe and you can make a radiation suit later when you feel like exploring the ship or the area around it. If you have a welder you can repair the ship and stop the radiation.  Though at this point once you have the radiation suit I don't believe there's any real reason to fix it yet. If you're underwater when the ship explodes you'll miss it, you don't get much warning either.

Before the last stable update, the limit was 4GB (which didn't work), but now they switched to 64bit in experimental, so the game is not restricted by this tight limit any more, meaning that 4GB systems are now more or less substandard.

subnautica,3447ho,AG74683,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:20:37 2015 UTC,It doesn't fix the core issue - the game just keeps ammassing more and more RAM usage until it crashes - but it definitely should make it work a bit smoother. Graphics card might also be a problem.

I love this game and the feel of exploration and mystery it has, and I don't want to hider it's community's growth. And to the people asking why we keep posting despite no upvotes, you guys forget that we are YouTubers. We are not looking for karma, but for views. We're just trying to get our channels off the ground. I know a lot of people see YouTubers as greedy and just trying to shove content in your face, but at least in my case, it's a way of doing what I love while trying to help with my parents money problems. I know that sounds corny and fake, but it's true, and it sucks. I really hope that the other YouTubers on the subreddit also stop their posts, because I genuinely want this game and it's community continue to expand as far as it can.

subnautica,3328mt,drmonix,0,Tue Apr 21 19:19:02 2015 UTC,"If nobody likes them, they'll get downvoted. I'm not sure why it would make more sense to ban them than to just let them get downvoted into oblivion. At least, that's been my position so far, and I think it's worth waiting it out a little longer to see how it goes. I suspect the influx of Let's Plays is tied to the times when a popular YouTuber posts one - all the people who want to be like them jump on the Subnautica bandwagon hoping it's the next big thing, then they eventually abandon it. Then it flares up when another huge YouTuber plays it. I think over time it will sort itself out. If it gets worse we can make some sort of rule."

Three days later he posted two videos simultaneously which got downvoted, and he hasn't posted anything since then. So he doesn't seem like someone who just keeps posting anyways even after getting downvoted. He hasn't posted anything since getting downvoted.  /u/junksintrunk has posted two videos. That's hardly a deluge. If he keeps it up, I would see your point, but I think it's a little harsh to expect someone to never post again just because their first video doesn't get upvoted. Ditto for /u/cerebralpenguin."
subnautica,3328mt,danhedley,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:28:17 2015 UTC,"You make a fair point, but I don't think it is relevant to the side I'm trying to point out. Yes these guys all have only posted two links, but there aren't just the three of them. Tons of people in the gaming culture are all scrambling to get views for their channel, and the two or three videos posted by each let's player not only add up over time, but encourage more people to post their own let's plays.   On the front page of r/subnautica there is a small amount of other content compared to let's plays, and unless a rule is made I don't see that changing.

subnautica,32qisg,prokchopz,1 point,Wed Apr 15 23:17:26 2015 UTC,"The way i describe it, it sounds as if youll be taking over the ocean, but i know the devs dont want that. Let me better explain my idea.  Lets say you have a bad reaper problem. In other survival games, you would build weapons and traps to kill them, but in subnautica, you use your environment rather than weapons. So if you use breeding, you can do 2 things: build a predator to take care of them, or find something to detour them non violently. The predator is much more dangerous, but will most likely be more effective sooner. I didnt mention this, but you can only give 1-2 physical and behavioral attributes to an egg, but that creatures offspring can get more. It would take you multiple generations to get your creature perfect; if you let him out to early, they could reproduce and destroy everything. It would be game over, unless the emperor could stop them. But another way to stop the problem is by finding something they fear, or a weakness. Say you discover that they dont like big flashy bright things. You could alter mesmers to make them very territorial and so they live in packs, so when a reaper invades, the mesmers could scare it off.  I dont know if i misunderstood what you meant; if i did, i apologize. But i hope this clears anything up or fits in better for you. But i do agree with the others, this would probably make  the game way to big."
subnautica,32qisg,Iorith,2,Thu Apr 16 01:12:11 2015 UTC,"I like it in theory but that would make the game ungodly huge I think.  Maybe just cloning would be ok, I'd love having a pet reaper following my cyclops."

Currently, there is no falling damage, so exploring the mountains isn't dangerous.

subnautica,325alj,punkfac3kid,2,Fri Apr 10 18:28:30 2015 UTC,They problem is; the goals are far to clear cut and you can 'beat' the game as in escape within like 2 hours of doing shit to progress the game.  To put it lightly I feel in Subnautica's state (even with a lack of a lot of the content) I still can get lost in Sub for days if I'm not careful and FarSky was like oh cool I won.... Dota time I guess.....
subnautica,325alj,oberhamsi,5,Fri Apr 10 21:51:59 2015 UTC,still worth it on a sale. i played through it and enjoyed it.

Definitely worth it if it is on sale in my opinion.  As for the mods abandoning it, it was just one guy and I do get the feeling he abandoned it but he polished and finished the content that was there before he did. In the early days there were plans of a lot more content and even alpha of some of the content but then one day he decided the game was ""finished"" and it went to full release and the alpha testing for the new content stopped and the new content was scrapped in favour of polishing what was already there.   TL:DR There isn't much there, but what is there is solid. 2-3 hours of fun and that's it."

subnautica,325alj,droznig,2,Fri Apr 10 22:55:36 2015 UTC,Well it was just one guy and making games seems like a huge amount of work so maybe he decided to actually have a life instead and no one can fault him for that.  The indie devs that make it appear (to me at least) to be either   A: Incredibly talented and dedicated almost to a fault or   B: Have a good head for business and know when they need help and basically have to be able to start and run a small company professionally.  Or C: Very talented and doing minimalist games which require less work and can be manageable for just one person. 2d side scrollers for example.  That's my observations any way.
