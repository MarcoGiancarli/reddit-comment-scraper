Beekeeping,3e4k8o,beckeeper,4,Tue Jul 21 22:18:44 2015 UTC,You Florida beekeepers and your meditations under the bee tree. :P
Beekeeping,3e4k8o,Zealtos,2,Tue Jul 21 23:07:23 2015 UTC,Calm and collected like a monk
Beekeeping,3e4k8o,amethystrockstar,2,Tue Jul 21 22:34:28 2015 UTC,Wow but seriously that wall of bees... didn't notice it first time. That's quite a swarm...
Beekeeping,3e4k8o,amethystrockstar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:47:15 2015 UTC,I was laughing before I was asked to pose üòè
Beekeeping,3e4rk2,amethystrockstar,2,Tue Jul 21 23:14:33 2015 UTC,"If it's that hot, you'd be cooler with a shirt on. :P Maybe it'd be hotter if you had platform heels on, we could get out some $1s and make it rain for you."
Beekeeping,3e4rk2,Zealtos,2,Tue Jul 21 23:37:43 2015 UTC,Well it was actually breezey that day. By that point my shirt was soaked so the sweat and air really helped on the skin. I felt a million times better than with a suit  But I like the heels idea. I want rain :)
Beekeeping,3e4rk2,Zealtos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:41:28 2015 UTC,"Doesn't Texas have it dump though? Oregon it rains all the time except Summer, our Winter is essentially black skies and torrential rain for 3-5 months and then lighter rain with wind."
Beekeeping,3e4rk2,Zealtos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:51:11 2015 UTC,Have it dump? We have a brief rainy season in spring. All wind rain and clouds dissappear by June usually.
Beekeeping,3e4rk2,Zealtos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:56:31 2015 UTC,"Okay, because I was told that Texas has a bunch of rain happen all at once (like what would be days or weeks of rain in a few hours)."
Beekeeping,3e4rk2,laharre,3,Wed Jul 22 00:57:24 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, we get dumped on. For about one month out of the year... and we will get torrential downpours.  Unfortunately, lots of rain ‚â† not dry.  The dirt can only hold so much water.  All the water it can't hold runs off into our streets and catch basins... There are still trees mostly submerged this year where lakes overflowed.  Unfortunately that water does no good where it is.  It's kind of sad watching all the grass turn totally brown and die just a few feet from the water line. Imagine if you had a potted plant and gave it a week's worth of water in one day... you'd have a dead plant after a week cause it'd dry up in a day or two here.  So yeah, we get rain... just not near as much as we need and in way too short of increments."
Beekeeping,3e4rk2,laharre,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:25:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, while here it rains almost constantly for 8-9 months, so we have hills that store it pretty well. This year was the warmest winter on human record globally, so I had sunny skies and my girls flying since February, when normally they'd have to wait for sunbreaks in April to really show off."
Beekeeping,3e4rk2,dstroud,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:46:36 2015 UTC,That's awesome! We had a super mild winter but also a huge amount of snow suddenly.  Delayed our start a bit to late feb
Beekeeping,3e3x1c,futureblake4,2,Tue Jul 21 19:35:50 2015 UTC,"Super interesting, thank you so much for sharing!"
Beekeeping,3e3x1c,Hanselcj,2,Tue Jul 21 22:40:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I thought the microscope view would be pretty cool on that varroa mite.  Really cool if it wasn't coming out of my hive!  ;)"
Beekeeping,3e3x1c,Nameless_Archon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:05:04 2015 UTC,"This is a couple of pictures and some videos of my sticky bottom board after 24 hours of installing the sticky board.  I've got a little usb microscope that I used to capture most of the images/videos.  I show the mite first at 30x then zoom into 200x.   The mite count was about a dozen, but I found many more (perhaps a hundred) of these small larvae crawling around.    I‚Äôm guessing the mite count isn‚Äôt too bad, but I‚Äôd love to see what you guys/gals think.    As for the larvae, what the heck are they and why do I have so many of them?  Is that something to worry about/treat?"
Beekeeping,3e3x1c,amethystrockstar,3,Tue Jul 21 19:36:54 2015 UTC,"Not a beekeeper, just someone interested.  That larva in the initial frame looks like a small hive beetle larvae. Compare identification characteristics here: http://www.tbhsbywam.com/small-hive-beetles/  Edit: At 1:48, you can see the larva up close, with the dual rear spines.  Expert may chime in to correct me, but I'm pretty sure you need to monitor/deal with these, as they can ruin a hive if not handled."
Beekeeping,3e3x1c,amethystrockstar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:35:31 2015 UTC,"Yep, that looks like it.  Those three pairs of legs are the same, too.  So now I wonder what my best move is.  I didn't notice any beetles in the hive itself, though I wasn't actually looking for them when I did my inspection..."
Beekeeping,3e2v0w,Tjololo,3,Tue Jul 21 15:14:02 2015 UTC,"Is she from this year or 2010? If she's from 2010, I'll believe she's out of eggs, somehow, but if she's from this year, I can't believe she's out of eggs, only out of sperm. If she's out of sperm, donate a frame of eggs/young brood from your carnies. Order in a new queen or let them raise a carnie queen for you."
Beekeeping,3e2v0w,Zealtos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:28:44 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, she's from this year. I just got the nuc this year, she came from California.  I was actually planning on donating a frame of brood/eggs from the italians to the carnies, as the carnies currently have no eggs/brood either. They just superseded the queen, and I think they're in the period before she starts laying again, but I was going to move a frame over to be sure. Now, I have no brood either place.  That's not 100% true. I have a friend with a hive of italians that's exploding, I'm going to see if I can get 2 frames of brood off her and put one in each hive, that way I can hopefully get them working. If she can spare that, I'm not going to order a new queen, just let them raise one from the brood frame. But if she can only spare one, I'm going to pick up a queen probably Wednesday or Thursday to get it installed, whenever she gets delivered.  Thanks for the insights! Here's hoping they get well soon enough to make it through the winter, our dearth is coming pretty much any time now, and they have very few bees, and little stored. I'm hoping I can make up the excess with sugar water later in the season."
Beekeeping,3e2v0w,Zealtos,2,Tue Jul 21 15:33:03 2015 UTC,"The reason I asked was that she has a blue dot, which means she's from a year that ends in 5 or 0 if she's properly marked. If she's from this year, then she either is doing fine and you're having trouble seeing her eggs, meaning this is a perception problem, or she was poorly bred and is running low on sperm, which I would be confused by since she presents a fairly strong retinue.  There is the possibility that her biological lifespan is somehow extremely short and she's double laying because she doesn't care for some reason.   I think it might be good to grab your mentor, show them the video and some brood frames in person. She acts like she's a fresh queen but she's marked, and you didn't do that."
Beekeeping,3e2v0w,mygoddamnameistaken,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:47:34 2015 UTC,What is that blue dot anyways?
Beekeeping,3e2v0w,laharre,2,Wed Jul 22 00:00:12 2015 UTC,"It's a marker that serves a few purposes. It tells you the age of the queen, as the color changes every year so you can tell their age. It also let's you know if your bees have superseded, as your new queen wouldn't have one. Probably most important though, it helps you find your queen for inspections or replacing her."
Beekeeping,3e2v0w,Zealtos,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:15:30 2015 UTC,"It's usually paint. There's an international queen code for each year. Since queens don't live more than about seven years, but most often more than three, there's only five colors that rotate twice a decade. Blue is for years ending in 0 and 5, so a queen with a blue dot was born in 2010 or 2015 since we assume a queen from 2005 or 2000 would be long dead by now.  It serves a secondary purpose as helping a new beekeeper (or general beekeeper) with the ability to spot her more easily since it takes practice to see a queen by simply looking."
Beekeeping,3e2v0w,kckaaos,2,Wed Jul 22 00:55:48 2015 UTC,"Also, you may not be able to see the egg for a few days.  It depends on lighting, the comb color etc."
Beekeeping,3e2v0w,kckaaos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:53:45 2015 UTC,"Ah I didn't know that, that's pretty interesting. I'll have to take a look. I wouldn't be able to get a queen anyway until Thursday at the earliest, so it would have to wait until then regardless. That would probably give enough time to see a few eggs. I marked the frame she was actively laying on, so hopefully I'll see some stuff."
Beekeeping,3e2u58,Tjololo,3,Tue Jul 21 15:07:00 2015 UTC,I think those eggs were laid by a queen.  Why do you think they were laid by a worker?
Beekeeping,3e2u58,Texas_Beekeeper,2,Tue Jul 21 15:13:29 2015 UTC,"Because there's many eggs in a cell, and they're all haphazard. It was my understanding that a queen would only ever lay one egg in a cell.  Additionally, you can see the other video I just posted. The queen looks like she lays, but then when she moves you can see right into the cell and I don't see an egg there. I think the queen may be out of eggs. That hive has been weak for a while, and they aren't having the buildup I'm seeing in the other hive."
Beekeeping,3e2u58,Texas_Beekeeper,5,Tue Jul 21 15:15:47 2015 UTC,"2 and 3 eggs per cell is common for a first year queen, especially one that has recently begun to lay.  They look to be in the bottom of the cells as well, and a laying worker can't lay that deep.  A laying worker usually puts them on the sidewall.  Also a lot of those eggs look to be centered.  Another indication it was laid by a queen.  I'd really have to look myself to tell for sure, though."
Beekeeping,3e2u58,Texas_Beekeeper,2,Tue Jul 21 15:44:50 2015 UTC,"Interesting. That's a good point that they're on the bottom of the cells, I didn't think about that. What's your recommendation? Try to put a frame of brood in there and see what happens? If they do start producing a queen, should I kill the old one to be sure she doesn't kill the new queen, or let her go and let the bees handle it?"
Beekeeping,3e2u58,Texas_Beekeeper,3,Tue Jul 21 16:50:49 2015 UTC,"As long as she is still producing workers, I would let her go.  New queens go on a drone laying frenzy in the beginning of their life.  Watch the population numbers, and whenever you inspect, look for workers.  Personally, I'd close it up for like 3 weeks and see where I am then.  Is this your Italian hive?"
Beekeeping,3e2u58,Here_Four_Beer,2,Tue Jul 21 21:48:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is my italian hive. Do you mean not inspect them for 3 weeks and see how they're doing? If she's not laying, or is out of sperm, or what have you but she's just not doing it, what would happen if I didn't inspect in 3 weeks? Would I miss a window to replace her and save the hive?"
Beekeeping,3e2u58,Zealtos,3,Tue Jul 21 22:04:59 2015 UTC,"No, by that time, they'd have already replaced her. :)"
Beekeeping,3e2u58,kckaaos,2,Tue Jul 21 22:05:43 2015 UTC,I would wait. The housekeeping bees will discard the excess eggs laid in your comb.
Beekeeping,3e2d42,weissensteinburg,10,Tue Jul 21 12:40:18 2015 UTC,"Generally we tell people you just can't plant enough to support a hive. However if you can really plant in numbers of acres that might be different. Numbers are all over the board because of local conditions, different crops and just lack of info. And most the info is on hive per acres needed for pollination not support of the hive. 40-50 hives is the most you generally want to put at a single permanent apiary. Bees will fly for up to 3 miles from the hive (an about 18,000 acre area) and collect from the best sources in that area as long as things bloom and they can fly. That works out to 360 acres per hive. But if you are in the middle of monoculture farm land that number might be much smaller, like 0. The hives taken to almonds in CA every Feb cant be supported the rest of the year because its too monoculture and the almonds only bloom for a few weeks. What is around you is probably going to matter more than anything you can plant unless you really can do acres and acres.  This list will help. While that list says that certain species of clover will provide 500lbs of honey per acre in a good year but that just seems way too high, maybe someone out west can say otherwise. The links for books at the bottom of that page (Honey plants of North America) will be of a lot of help to you.  The National Honey Board says it takes two million flowers to make 1 pound of honey. This says 326,000 flowers per acre of clover (admittedly that's a New Zealand species of clover). That works out to 6 acres per lb.  The standard recommendation is to have 80-90 pounds of honey on a hive for winter that would be 180 million flowers. Then add in what a hive needs to support itself over the year while it is gathering that 90 lbs, plus whatever you take off of it in honey.  If the above 326,000 flowers/acre is close that is at least 552 acres just for the 90lbs which seems much more like reality.  Obviously planting multiple crops through the year that provide good nectar sources changes all that."
Beekeeping,3e2d42,svarogteuse,4,Tue Jul 21 13:26:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback, it sounds like we wouldn't ever provide enough to fully support them, but planting a few acres of flowering forage could be a good supplement.   It's odd the two sources provide such drastically different numbers. According to Wikipedia, one acre of clover would support 5.5 hives, while your numbers say 552 acres per hive. I'm guessing reality will be somewhere in the middle, and of course dependent heavily on the weather and location."
Beekeeping,3e2d42,svarogteuse,2,Tue Jul 21 14:24:36 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing the wikipedia numbers are the maximum someone got once off the crop under ideal conditions and a super strong hive geared to maximum honey production (multiple queens, or even none with all the brood removed so the workers only forage).  The 552 is more real life since most places have a mix of land use. The actual number required might be smaller but IRL forest doesn't provide a lot of nectar, water none and the heavy producing acres are mixed in with  low ones and it ends up taking a lot more physical space to support a hive than numbers suggest in just acres of plants."
Beekeeping,3e2d42,Davin900,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:36:04 2015 UTC,Good point. I suppose if we do go this route we'll start small and potentially over seed some clover in the surrounding pastures as the number of hives grows.
Beekeeping,3e2d42,dstroud,6,Tue Jul 21 15:50:11 2015 UTC,"These questions always seem a bit funny to me.  I just want to put things in perspective... I keep bees in the heart of Brooklyn, NYC. There are hundreds of happy beehives here in NYC with no appreciable farmland for miles. They all do great. I've even worked with hives on 30-story rooftops in Midtown Manhattan.  They don't need dedicated space or crops to pollinate. They'll find it.  One of my hives has already produced 100 pounds of honey this year (their third year) and there's no end in sight! And they live on a tiny concrete rooftop in one of the densest cities in the world.  You have nothing to worry about!"
Beekeeping,3e2d42,SnickeringBear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:12:41 2015 UTC,"That is pretty incredible- and reassuring- to hear. Fascinating, what good opportunists honeybees are."
Beekeeping,3e2d42,shadetreephilosopher,3,Wed Jul 22 03:03:26 2015 UTC,"These are generalizations but might help a bit.  Get a current copy of The Hive and The Honeybee and read the chapter on pollination.   It is normal to have up to 100 feral colonies of bees per square mile of mixed forest and meadow.  This translates to one colony needing about 6 acres.  Above this density and winter losses tend to cut the number of colonies significantly.  If you want backing for this number search for Seeley Arnot Forest. For pollination purposes, a typical recommendation is 1 colony per acre up to 4 colonies per acre depending on how long the bloom lasts and how attractive it is to bees.  This is much higher density than can be supported based on most crops that need pollination. As mentioned by others, most locations can support about 20 colonies of bees in a single apiary.  Where rainfall is not a limiting factor, this can go up to 80.  By trial and error, I've learned that 20 colonies is a good number here in North Alabama. If your cultivated crop is marijuana and you are trying to produce psychoactive honey, all bets are off.  The bees might have trouble flying home! :D :O :)"
Beekeeping,3e2d42,Schrodenger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:43:28 2015 UTC,This is a very interesting question.  I have wondered before why orchards aren't also in the bee business.  My guess is that anything that would be planted under the orchard trees to help the bees survive would also take precious water away from your orchard.  Are you considering the extra water as part of the equation?
Beekeeping,3e2d42,Schrodenger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:17:02 2015 UTC,"An acre of a monoculture crop that only flowers for 1-2 months isn't nearly enough to support even one hive. The bees need to collect pollen and nectar during the entire summer in order for them to have enough food for the winter.   That said they don't usually stay within just an acre of space. Bees can fly 3-4 miles, which allows them to collect from potentially 50,000 acres of land. As long as the area has plenty of wild growth you can easily support a large number of hives. With only an acre of land you don't need to worry about planting food for them. I live in a rural town and they have no problem finding sources of food."
Beekeeping,3e2d42,Schrodenger,2,Tue Jul 21 13:05:23 2015 UTC,"Right, we have much more than one acre of our crop, and are willing to plant several acres of other flowering crops to support the bees. I'm just trying to understand what order of magnitude we're talking...10 hives to an acre or ten acres to a hive. I'm sure with just a couple hives we would be okay, but if we start looking towards 25-100 I would think there might be problems."
Beekeeping,3e2d42,FoodBeerBikesMusic,0,Tue Jul 21 13:35:03 2015 UTC,"For that you would need to give a bit more information as to where you're located. If you're in an arid environment or a tropical one like Florida, or the barren north of Canada.  I guess I misunderstood when you said supplementing with some of your own. Some to me was a something like 10ish. 25 hives is quite in an undertaking without prior experience.   There have been beekeepers in the past in Pennsylvania that kept thousands of hives on their farm but this was before the monoculture crop, before pesticides and all the other issues bees have today. Of course if you're on a farm larger than 50,00 acres you can always have multiple yards and spread the bees out so they don't fight for resources.   Generally for a bee yard you want to not go above 25-40 depending on your climate but it's not a hard rule since areas vary so greatly."
Beekeeping,3e2d42,knackbock,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:41:58 2015 UTC,"We're in Central Florida, surrounded by a lot of forest and pastureland. 25-40 is about what I would expect us to have, enough to bring a measure of safety and diversification to our pollinator source. Anything over the first few and we would likely bring someone on to help manage them."
Beekeeping,3e2d42,FoodBeerBikesMusic,0,Tue Jul 21 14:16:42 2015 UTC,"Compared to other areas Florida is an easier place to take care of bees since you don't have much of a winter. From what I've heard you do have a nectar dearth where there isn't much for the bees to forage, and Varroa mites, small hive beetles and wax moth can be a bit of an issue.   It goes without saying but you should start with 2-4 hives at first to make sure it's worth the effort. Taking care of and maintaining bees can be an interesting challenge that not everyone is up to.  I've lost count of the number of starter kits that are for sale on Craigslist.   The best advice and information would be from your local bee club.   Here is a link to the state association http://floridabeekeepers.org/  Here is a link to each areas local association http://floridabeekeepers.org/localassociations.htm  As a whole beekeepers are a helpful bunch and typically very friendly and willing to help new people out. The locals will be able to give you the best advice, certainly better than a guy up in Michigan can who doesn't know much about the Ecology down there."
Beekeeping,3e2d42,Grimsterr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:35:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks, we've been to the local meetup once at our county extension office and it certainly was beneficial! We'll be keeping in better touch with them as we get more serious about it."
Beekeeping,3e2d42,Zealtos,3,Tue Jul 21 17:56:52 2015 UTC,"That said they don't usually stay within just an acre of space   This! I have about ten acres of red clover right next to me that was planted for cow forage....and my bees ignore it. No idea where they go, but apparently something further away was worth the extra trip distance!"
Beekeeping,3e2d42,Grimsterr,4,Tue Jul 21 13:28:01 2015 UTC,"Red clover relies mainly on bumblebees for pollination, to reach its nectar you need  tongues longer than the honeybees have."
Beekeeping,3e2d42,Davin900,2,Tue Jul 21 14:34:17 2015 UTC,"Ah....that explains why they weren't on that, or my catalpa, even through both are about 50' from the hive."
Beekeeping,3e2d42,Grimsterr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:58:14 2015 UTC,"I've read (been reading a lot prepping for the first hive) that clover is usually the last resort for honey bees, though apparently bumble bees love the stuff."
Beekeeping,3e2d42,Grimsterr,2,Tue Jul 21 14:21:15 2015 UTC,You should see how they hate pear nectar. ;)
Beekeeping,3e2d42,Jfurmanek,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:48:15 2015 UTC,"Unless you own roughly ~20K acres around you, then your 1 or 2 acres of planted will hardly be a drop in the bucket of what your hives collect.    Now a more poignant question may be ""how many hives would I need to make sure my plants are well pollinated?"" and to that I dunno, I'd start with 3 since that seems to be a good number to start with to help even your odds for a successful first winter which seems to be the make or break for starting out."
Beekeeping,3e2d42,s33761,3,Tue Jul 21 14:24:00 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thanks. I knew bees will travel far to find flowers, but I never knew they needed so many. The number of hives required for our plants is pretty well established in the industry (about 200-250 for the acreage we have now), but we aren't trying to provide 100% of our own bees, just supplement what we rent."
Beekeeping,3e3btc,RedWingWoody,2,Tue Jul 21 17:12:04 2015 UTC,It's probably nothing.
Beekeeping,3e3btc,Senno_Ecto_Gammat,2,Tue Jul 21 17:14:09 2015 UTC,"2 eggs in one cell is only an issue if its spread all over - single occurrences happen occasionally. Its more common in younger queens than older ones.  More important is egg position - base of cell is fine, but on side walls can indicate laying workers."
Beekeeping,3e3btc,scottish_beekeeper,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:30:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you! They were both in the bottom, like they were twins or something. She's a first year queen from the south."
Beekeeping,3e3btc,scottish_beekeeper,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:32:16 2015 UTC,I would consider it pretty normal for a first year queen to 'double up' occasionally.  The only other option I can think of is a brand new young queen from a supersedure who has just started laying - but you can confirm that one when you next find your queen...
Beekeeping,3e3btc,Zealtos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:27:29 2015 UTC,"It's not uncommon for a first year queen to multi-lay, usually she keeps it below five. Laying workers can't lay at the bottom of the cell and will lay an egg, walk away, come back and lay another so there are sometimes 8-15, so a single double lay isn't anything I would worry about, the nurse bee workers will remove the extra egg later."
Beekeeping,3e3btc,danimalod,2,Tue Jul 21 23:10:31 2015 UTC,"These were definitely very tidy eggs. I'll know more tomorrow when I swap out the feeders and inevitably peek under the lid.

Beekeeping,3e3btc,Zealtos,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:47:43 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tidbit about the nurse bees removing the extra egg.  I was wondering if two larvae would start go grow in there and be smooshed/die or something else.  Thanks.

I still need to get tested to see if I'm allergic to bee venom.  I have a few books I'd like to read before I get started.  I need to find a good location.  I haven't even been to an apiary yet to experience it first hand.  I have a few financial obligations I'd like to take care of before I get started as well.  I'm really enjoying this sub though, and I'm looking forward to when I can say, ""So glad I read about that on /r/Beekeeping!"", when I'm worried about swarms, wondering when to split, or add a new super, opening the brood chamber, checkerboarding, etc."

Beekeeping,3dzsnp,jetosedefaire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:03:21 2015 UTC,"hm, brood box's have frames in them? only asking because theres another box below it."
Beekeeping,3dzsnp,PoliteAnarchist,4,Tue Jul 21 01:43:52 2015 UTC,"Depends on whether theres a queen excluder board or not. No excluder, and you'll find brood in the centre of the hive - where its the warmest.   You'll find honey on the end frames, and around the edges of the brood frames, provided the hive isn't too full (then you'll have a swarm risk anyway).  Also, the darker comb indicates brood. It could be repurposed as honey comb though, so it doesn't completely rule the honey out."
Beekeeping,3dzsnp,needanadult,3,Tue Jul 21 01:55:02 2015 UTC,3 inches of honey is the best queen excluder and is less harsh on worker's wings. The queen won't cross a band of honey. Mostly I was commenting on the dark comb. I wouldn't want to eat honey out of brood comb either but maybe I am too picky.
Beekeeping,3dzsnp,PoliteAnarchist,3,Tue Jul 21 02:07:33 2015 UTC,I'm not so sure about queens not wanting to cross honey cells.. Commercial beekeeping experience tells me otherwise.

Its not a problem its natural behavior. Put to many of anything generating heat in a confined space during 100 degree days (and not much less at night) and they are going to seek cooler conditions. A lot of their behavior is adjusting the conditions for the brood. Having too many bees in the hive is going to block air flow over the brood which needs cooled. They aren't going to go back in because even with upper ventilation the bodies block the air flow.  Make sure they have a nearby water source, the closer the better so they have to fly less. Prop the lid with a few pennies but expect them to beard."
Beekeeping,3e010n,apocolyptictodd,6,Mon Jul 20 22:24:22 2015 UTC,"I guess if you push someone enough you might be able to convince them to sell you bees but at certain times of the year it's not a good idea, especially in the northern areas.  Packages are a common way to start keeping bees, these by necessity need to be sold in the spring. Since they are starting with nothing, no comb, no stores, and a queen that is new to the colony they need all the help they can get to get build up before winter comes. Even then it's a gamble for them to make it to spring.  A nucleus colony is a better way to go, in my opinion, but you still want to get those in the spring or early summer. Basically you need to get it right now as they need time to build up their stores before the cold months come. You can push this a little longer than a package but spring or summer are the only times you can go that route.  You could try to grab a wild swarm but they face the same problems as packages they do however tend to be better acclimated for your environment.   I guess you could try buying a full hive from someone. I've come across a few guys that are going that route but you'll spend $600 going that route. Which isn't a bad idea but certainly not that common. This option would again be most likely in spring and summer, but would be the only option that could work in the fall. However you'd drop a big chunk of money on bees that might live through the winter where if you just wait till spring you would at least get a summer to work with them before you have to worry about winter.   It really won't work to buy bees in the winter. That time of the year you often make spring orders but nothing is shipped since they would just freeze to death, or starve in northern areas.   Now the most common advice you'll get here is to join the local beekeeping club, get some books, you can purchase equipment and get it ready, or even try and find an experienced bee keeper that will let you come to their apiary to look around. Get some helpful tips and see what keeping bees is like. I would also research information online, granted some of it will conflict of course.  A great place to look is the work of Michael Bush, http://www.bushfarms.com/beeslazy.htm, or just a quick search of youtube will net you some decent videos."

Beekeeping,3dyclf,IanBauters,5,Mon Jul 20 15:15:37 2015 UTC,"It depends on what your potential customers want. Most Americans want liquid honey. Europeans are more fans of creamed honey  which is crystallized honey, but done in a manner so its smooth. No one wants randomly crystallized honey.   Since I'm in America I leave it liquid, I haven't even had anyone ask for creamed. Depending on how you sell and where you are you might want to make a small batch of creamed and see how it sells. If it does well do more."
Beekeeping,3dyclf,svarogteuse,4,Mon Jul 20 16:12:04 2015 UTC,I think your plan sounds better. I don't see the point in letting it crystallize.  Let it crystallize and then what? Doesn't really offer a solution of what to do with honey...

Beekeeping,3dyclf,Grimsterr,2,Mon Jul 20 19:39:36 2015 UTC,"A lot of beekeepers tell me that I need to crystalize my honey.   Huh?  That seems absurd.  If your honey is from some flowers (say canola and related plants from the mustard family), it'll crystalize anyway no matter how much you try to make it stop; and if it's from some other flowers, it won't crystalize unless you abuse it (artificially dry it too much)."
Beekeeping,3dyclf,rmxz,2,Mon Jul 20 18:36:08 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, thank you for all the answers! Didn't expect so many of them! For those of you who don't know the practice, just let me explain for a moment. I will not be doing so myself. My mentor taught  me that after removing foam for approximately 4 days, we need to put the honey in a cold place at about 14¬∞C. Then I'm supposed to stir my honey without inducing new air to it for about 5 minutes, 2 times a day. To optimise crystallisation, we add 5-10% crystallised honey from previous batches. Only then you pour your honey.  I have known this to take over 2 months. The result is smaller sugar crystals than when you lit it crystallise on it's own. But apparently it's region bound. I must however say that my mentor always told me that liquid honey isn't honey‚Ä¶¬†Nevertheless, I'll probably keep mine liquid for this being my first year."
Beekeeping,3dyclf,Zealtos,2,Tue Jul 21 07:14:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sounds like your area beekeepers prefer creamed honey. Oddly, it also means they've left a market gap for things like liquid honey.   I'm American, I like comb honey and liquid honey, I like the presentation of chunk honey. I like having guests over and see the wonder on their faces when they see the jars I keep of honey from every batch I've ever harvested and the different colors and tastes each holds.  You also have options like mead, which has it's own quiet culture. I know some people that use honey like molasses for their baked goods.  In the end, I can only be firm that they're your bees, your honey, your way. If you do what's right for you and your bees, then there should not be any reason or cause for reproach. :)"
Beekeeping,3dyclf,bjelkeman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:00:04 2015 UTC,"Where are you at? In Sweden, the honey we get crystallises whether we want it or not. If we don't stir as per your mentors instructions, then it supposedly crystallises in much bigger crystals and becomes very hard.   We kept some of ours liquid, but it started crystallising after a few weeks. Our stiring process took about a week, then you could see it was leaving a trace in the honey as you stirred, which is the sign to poor it. A few days later all the jars had crystallised honey."
Beekeeping,3dyclf,witehare,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:17:47 2015 UTC,Huh. Is there something about the nectar in your region that means the honey will crystalize quickly on it's own?  The only reason I can think of for creaming it would be to get out ahead of that.

Beekeeping,3dyclf,kckaaos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:31:24 2015 UTC,"If you live in an area with certain types of flowers, the honey is probably going to crystalize.  The reason, in this case, that you want to go ahead and force it is so you can control the crystal size.  Fine crystals make a really thick spreadable honey.  You may want to google ""spun honey"" to get some ideas on how it is made.    If you let the honey do it on its own, the crystals will be random sizes, chunky etc.  However, you can ""seed"" the crystals to make them uniform."

Please take away the smoker from your partner, your bees don't seem to be agitated at all, a little smoke goes a long way. Literally two puffs in the front and two in the top and a ten count are enough for most twenty frame boxes.  Why are there no bees on your frames though? Were they all smoked into that beard? That was a super pro pour! :D If you're ever not sure though, feel free to use a funnel. (you lurkers who read these things too!)  Scooping the bees at the end was probably the best decision I could have suggested (no smoker would be a close second). Good job Grim! I hope things go well!"

There were literally no bees left inside, I missed an -excellent- opportunity to actually see my queen because there probably weren't 100 bees left on the frames total.  This was my first time doing anything with bees, my wife was basically scared shitless running the smoker, my kid was in his own beesuit taking the video.  I had no clue how much smoke I needed :D    No one got stung!  In the short time I was out there though, I sweated a bucket, maybe 2, the suit was basically wet when I took it off.  The next day I went out there and retrieved the tea pitcher and the nuc box from inside the hive and moved the separator up some, in my shorts and no smoke.   I'm still yet to get stung, though."

Beekeeping,3dy2bf,Pixelated_Fudge,6,Mon Jul 20 13:55:46 2015 UTC,How much larvae? 7 bees is a laughable loss. Not anything to worry about
Beekeeping,3dy2bf,amethystrockstar,4,Mon Jul 20 15:20:25 2015 UTC,"7 is probably not anything to worry about. Adults only live about 45 days and there is a constant cycling. If you have a hive of tens of thousands of bees 7 is not a concern a lot more died in the field and never came back.  Robbing would involve seeing bees fighting at the entrance. Do you see that?  Bees remove larva for a number of reasons. Could have bad varroa and not be able to develop, could have some other disease. In both cases look at the larva is there anything unusual about them: color, undeveloped mites on them? Bees will also remove larva particularly drone larva during a dearth. If they don't have the nectar or pollen to feed the larva they might toss them, or even eat them. How is the nectar/pollen flow in the area.   Going in the hive to see if they have nectar/pollen stores would be good, regardless of the dead bees. But again 7 is not really a concern."
Beekeeping,3dy2bf,svarogteuse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:08:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. There wasn't any fighting at the front and the larvae was kind of grey on one end. Pollen is Pretty good around here. Loads of flowers from neighbors and my place as well. I just wanted to make sure. Thanks!
Beekeeping,3dy2bf,svarogteuse,2,Mon Jul 20 14:16:21 2015 UTC,Grey headed larva could be  more of a problem. They should be all white. How old are the larva? Are they small a few days old or are they pupa that are older and starting to develop eyes? Are you sure they are bee larva not something else?
Beekeeping,3dy2bf,svarogteuse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:00:51 2015 UTC,Maybe the grey could be apart of the bee developing itself? Like maybe it's body? The hive it self seems healthy.
Beekeeping,3dy2bf,kckaaos,3,Mon Jul 20 15:08:47 2015 UTC,"Thats why i asked how old they are. If they are really pupa then yes color can be part of the development but its one of the last things to be expressed, after the eyes start to develop.   If they are really larva, pre capped cell larva they should be entirely milky white. Gray at one end doesn't match a symptom of a specific disease (all over gray/black could be chalk brood, yellow/brown European foul brood) but they should not be gray at all and what you are calling gray could be something else.   Gray headed larva could also describe wax moth larva or Samll Hive Beetle larva which is why I asked of they are really bee larva."
Beekeeping,3dy2bf,s33761,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:17:31 2015 UTC,"To put this in perspective, a queen can lay as many as 3,000 eggs per day.  Eventually, the hive's death rate will be the same as the laying rate.  So 7 bees is really only a tiny fraction of the bees that died that day."

Beekeeping,3dz0jw,noobyllama,2,Mon Jul 20 18:04:18 2015 UTC,"Call your local beekeeping club. Or any local apiary should be willing to help. Unfortunately, the only bees worth collecting are honey bees. Although they are just a beneficial to local flora and fauna as honey bees, other species aren't worth relocating because they don't make honey. I would continue with your fence building until the bees become too much of a nuisance to continue. Then you may have to pay for removal of the hive."

As far as I've been informed, bumblebee nests aren't usually larger than a fist, but I don't have a lot of first hand experience with them. Wood is a better material, but a shoebox would supposedly make sure you'd know you have enough space to place them into on the first try if you wanted to build them a box. Bumblebees are still worth buying and selling to specialized markets, like greenhouses and researchers."
Beekeeping,3dud2c,theZanShow,5,Sun Jul 19 15:47:04 2015 UTC,"After reading through a few books on beekeeping, I've decided that foundationless was the way to go. I was worried at first that they'd cross comb like crazy or that comb would fall apart or somehow it would turn out to be a total disaster. Doesn't seem so, yet!   I flanked each foundationless frame with a frame of foundation or drawn comb (these hives aren't fully mature yet) to reduce chances of cross combing. I split the brood nest with the foundationless, moving the foundation frames closer to the edges. I am figuring that next year I can start removing the foundation frames out of the hive after the winter, when they're empty. I ultimately want to go 100% foundationless, and I figure this is the easiest and safest transition method.  I hope to phase out the brood sized boxes altogether as well and standardize to mediums. The heavy lifting is not something I really like! I had to start with brood sizes though as that was the size the nucs came as (and I didn't want to perform comb surgery on a weak hive)."
Beekeeping,3dud2c,amethystrockstar,2,Sun Jul 19 15:57:03 2015 UTC,"So why foundationless? I do foundationless for cut comb honey but otherwise only cutouts go foundationless. And it is always scary rotating frames. If you tilt too much they come loose. I know it saves you a little space to go foundationless but for brood I don't see the advantages. Do you plan to extract honey all foundationless??  As for cross combing, you handled it very well. I had to learn that lesson the hard way recently. I checkboard all foundationless with drawn out foundation comb now. Good call moving foundation frames to edges. If you're trying to phase out frames for any reason that's the way to go as eventually that will be just nectar and pollen that you can take. Or even capped honey if you're lucky. Really pretty comb, nice pic"
Beekeeping,3dud2c,amethystrockstar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:59:03 2015 UTC,"I chose to go foundationless for a few reasons.  1) According to my research, it's better for the bees. There are a few theories as to why, and I can't recall from which source I got each theory, but they are likely derived from one of the resources I mention below.  The only foundation I can get has cell size of 5.4mm. Having read my books, I have realized this yields a few things: bigger cells mean bigger bees, bigger bees means longer gestation (is this the right word for bees?) periods in the cell. When 5.4mm foundation is removed from the hive and bees are allowed to freestyle their comb, the size is smaller. Natural cell size is between 4.7 and 5.0mm. This difference in diameter of nearly 10% means the bees coming out are substantially larger. Is this a good thing? Not necessarily. I trust Mother Nature's R&D team more than the handful of beekeepers out there who experimented with cell size a hundred years ago. I assume that many animals are, through evolution (or creation, if you believe that) suited for their environment.   Man's intervention is not necessarily best for the bees. Smaller bees may mean better immune systems. It supposedly make varroa less able to cling to their hosts. Smaller bees means shorter gestation period. This is important. Apparently every 8 hours shorter capped time a pupae undergoes, half as many varroa come out of that cell. Apparently bees that come out of 4.95mm cells come out 24 hours sooner than bees of 5.4mm cells. That's a significant reduction in varroa.  Source, also in the Bush book I listed below.  Healthy bees are important. Here in Southern Ontario, we can sometimes have nasty winters. I want my bees to survive them. My mentor (treatment free, feeds syrup, 5.4mm foundation beeswax or plastic) has been losing hives at a rate of ~40% a winter last couple winters. The local commercial beekeeper (treatments, feeds, 5.4mm mostly plastic) where my bees are being kept experienced 60% hive loss last winter. I can't make money losing bees like this! So even if foundationless is less efficient for honey creation by X%, it's still better (imo) than dead hives. Obviously if my bees die at phenomenal rates too, this point argument isn't well supported.  2) Foundation introduction means introduction of whatever was in the wax into the hive. Herbicides. Insecticides. These organic compounds naturally stay in organic wax, and thus are introduced into the hive. I'm not the type who think antibiotics and all that are evil. I just think introduction of antibiotics and all that into a system that doesn't need them is bad.  3) Money.  Propolis-etc sells deep foundation for ~2.00$ a sheet. Medium for ~1.30$ a sheet. By going mostly foundationless, I have saved close to around 200$ in foundation alone. Plastic is arguably cheaper as it's reusable. However I've read (and had experienced with my mentor encountering) the bees not taking to plastic. If you're really the hippy-dippy-type, you can argue that chemicals can leach out of the organic plastic into the organic wax. Doesn't really concern me as I do use plastic tupperwares and all that, but I don't call bullshit on it either - working in a factory working with plastics, I know better.  4) Effort / Time.  If going beeswax, I need to replace foundation every 2-3 years (recommended from my research). Initial frame construction time is about the same - I glue popsicle sticks in - about the same effort as inserting beeswax foundation. However, knocking out the foundation to then reinsert is a little more time consuming, especially in a used frame. What, 20 seconds a frame? With 200 frames to do? I'm lazy.  I do plan on extracting foundationless for the moment. I want honey. My girlfriend wants wax. So, crush and strain it is. Saves me the initial investment in an extractor. It forces me to cycle out the wax, ensuring a healthy disease-and-residue-free frame is inserted back into the hive. Maybe when I start scaling up my hive count to 10+ hives I might consider an extractor."
Beekeeping,3dud2c,amethystrockstar,2,Mon Jul 20 20:53:27 2015 UTC,"While I can't get behind all those reasons, they're definitely worth noting. It's all preference too when it comes down to it. Just realize that what's best for the bees and is more ""natural"" is not always the best solution in an unnatural situation such as human managed honeybee colonies."

Beekeeping,3dud2c,sdega315,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:44:33 2015 UTC,Which books did you read/think was most informative?
Beekeeping,3dud2c,rhackleford,4,Sun Jul 19 17:34:19 2015 UTC,"I've read a few books now and have worked with my mentor (10 hive hobby keeper) for three years. This is the first year where I have my own hives. I am of the attitude that bees can look after themselves and the organic approach is the desirable approach. Some will scoff that my attitude is too hippy-dippy-like, and you have to understand that my attitude colors how I feel about certain resources.  I would say that over the past few years the most helpful books were (in order I read them):  D. Cramp, A practical manual of beekeeping: how to keep bees and develop your full potential as an apiarist. Spring Hill, 2008.  This was one of the first I read, after the Beekeeping for Dummies (wouldn't recommend as a go-to resource). Since I wanted to try a more natural approach and have a better of understanding why to do certain things the way they're done, I would recommend this one over some of the other generic overview type books. I think it's important to understand the bees to develop your own practices effectively. This book does cover more conventional keeping practices including the use of antibiotics and other intervention treatments. If you're interested in that sort of thing, it's covered.  R. Conrad, Natural Beekeeping: Organic Approaches to Modern Apiculture. Vermont: Chelsea Green Publishing, 2 ed., February 2013.  Originally borrowed from the library, later bought for reference. This author is about how conventional practices are unsustainable and more organic approaches must be taken to beekeeping. A preacher, in a way. The book covers some interesting topics backed with research - something I really like to see. This book definitely focuses more on organic approaches (as suggested by the title). Sometimes the author goes off talking more about ideals which makes it less of a manual. Suggests treatments for common beekeeping problems. Again, this is like an overview book, but with a strong focus on sustainable practices. There is surprisingly little mention of top-bar hives - I doubt the author had any experience with them, really, at the time of writing.  L. Crowder and H. Harrel, Top-Bar Beekeeping. Vermont: Chelsea Green Publishing, August 2012.  Top bar hives are something I'm interested in. This book, although short and misses some overview concepts needed for an absolute beginner, details particular manipulations required for a top bar hive. A topic book. If you're interested in the top-bar hive route, this may be a book for you. Of course, any book written about top-bar hives is going to have to favor foundationless ideas and more natural approaches to beekeeping.  M. Bush, The Practical Beekeeper Volume I, II & III Beekeeping Naturally. X-Star Publishing Company, 2011.  A later purchase, this book I found really influential. The content of this book can apparently be found on the Bush Farms website. I prefer reading paper over screen, so I bought the (relatively expensive) book off Amazon. The author writes as if he's a teacher speaking to you. A more intimate feeling with the reader, like having a mentor. Unfortunately (?) all his suggestions and recommendations are based almost entirely off his own experiences and/or anecdotal evidence - something I don't really like, but something you sometimes can't avoid. He overviews beekeeping techniques and practices that minimize work for the beekeeper. His thinking is rational (imo) and apparently it works out great for him (though I imagine you wouldn't be publishing a book on the topics if it didn't). Perhaps a better read for not the complete beginner, but someone who understands conventional beekeeping. Since Bush emphasizes techniques and practices that minimize work load, the concepts may be lost on someone who doesn't, for example, know what it's like lifting a brood box full of honey.  There are a few other books I've read, of course, but these ones I say cover the more important topics needed for anyone interested in natural approaches to beekeeping. Seeing as this is my first year on my own keeping hives, and winter is coming, I can't speak on how useful my education is in the real world just yet!  EDIT: Link out to books."

Don't spray them on bees, obviously, but I can't think of any that would directly harm them. Follow the labels. I use glyphosphate in my backyard vegetable garden as close as ten or twenty feet from the hives.  Pesticides can be used safely too, you just have to follow the label carefully (no wind, no blooming flowers)   Question 2: Fear is hard to deal with. I personally believe that facts are the best approach. Bee allergies are actually quite rare (less than 1% of the population, I believe), but are often confused with sensitivity to bee stings (stings swell up big).  The biggest problem I've seen is that many people's fear of bees isn't reliant on facts, but on fear itself. Nothing you say may be able to change that."

Beekeeping,3dws3l,Zealtos,2,Tue Jul 21 08:04:54 2015 UTC,"Depending where you live, most weed killers are bee friendly (even commercial neonicitinoids are by far better than the organophosphates that used to be used) by law but you can spray in the morning or evening before the bees get to them so the weed killers are dry by the time they do. Weeds are also often a great source of nectar for the bees. Clover and dandelions grow wild where I live, and are a great underlying source of nectar for my girls, even when things are down to just them. Blackberries are a pest bramble that thrive here too, but the berries and honey are delicious.  I get to deal with a lot of new beekeepers, my advice tends to be the same as for you: Gloves, veil, and suit to cover anywhere you feel insecure at that point. When I started out, I was so poor that I used a warmth jacket to cover my arms because it was beige and could keep stingers away (I didn't get stung that year until I went to get a swarm in shorts, the protection was more for my mental state). Everything else is just education, it's okay to be afraid, we just divide things between rational fears and irrational fears. Once you know what is what, there's a lot less fear involved."

Places like Denver require 2m fences so the bees fly over people's heads, I just point them at a yard fence if the owners are worried. Having a hive rarely makes you more likely to get stung, it's getting in there and getting to know them that does that, they're more than happy to ignore you as long as you're not within 1-5m of their front entrance."

Beekeeping,3dwdrv,bombalicious,3,Mon Jul 20 02:16:47 2015 UTC,"this is a copy paste from the artical if you cant find it. it also has pictures.  A honey bee has three sets of legs, and each set is different. The last two legs‚Äîthe hindlegs‚Äîare designed to compress and carry the pollen pellets that are characteristic of honey bees and bumble bees.  We‚Äôve all seen those hard round nuggets in various colors and sizes, but did you ever wonder how the bees pack the pollen into a ball? Well, the secret tool is called a pollen press. The pollen press is actually made of two flat plates that are hinged together. One plate is on the distal end of the tibia, while the other is on an adjacent segment called the basitarsus.  If you lined all the leg parts end to end, starting at the thorax you would see:  coxa‚Üítrochanter‚Üífemur‚Üítibia‚Üítarsus‚Üípretarsus  However, the tarsus is further divided into several sub-segments: the basitarsus and four small tarsomeres.  What I have shown below is the joint between the tibia and the basitarsus, because that joint is the pollen press.  When the joint is bent, the plates pull apart and the bee stuffs the opening with pollen that she collects from her body. First, she uses all six legs to scrape the pollen into one place: the inside of the hindleg basitarsus. Then she combs it off the basitarsus with stiff bristles on the edge of the pollen press called a pollen rake. She cleans the left with the right and the right with the left, until the open press is full of pollen.  When she straightens her leg, the plates close against the pollen and force it up into the pollen basket. It‚Äôs like a tube of toothpaste: when you squeeze the two sides together, the paste comes out the top. Here, when the two plates are squeezed together, the pollen is forced up into the pollen basket. Although it may seem backward, the pollen basket is actually filled from the bottom.  Every time the bee grooms the pollen from her body, she works the pollen down to the inside of the basitarsus of the rear legs and then into the press before she gives it another squeeze. Is that cool or what?  The leg part shown below was taken from a dead honey bee I found in my driveway. She had one of those cards that said, in case of her death, she was leaving her body to science. RIP.  Rusty"

Michael Bush (http://www.bushfarms.com/bees.htm) being one of the most influential.   Here are some plans for the bottom board,inner cover, and telescoping cover.    http://www.michiganbees.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screened-Bottom-Board_20110324.pdf http://www.michiganbees.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Inner-Cover_20110316.pdf http://www.michiganbees.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Telescoping-Cover_20110321.pdf  A feeder is handy, but I really don't like the jar feeders, instead I like to put the feed deeper into the hive so you avoid robbing as much as possible. Either the frame feeders or the hive top ones are  nice. Especially the latter as they hold much larger volumes and you don't need open the hive up to refill it. That is to say you can refill it without the bees getting out at you. The absolute cheapest route though if a baggy feeder. For Nucs I just cut a hole in the lid and put a gatorade bottom with a bunch of holes drilled in it, really small holes are a must. When not feeding I cover the hole with a piece of wood. These covers are just a migratory cover so it's just a sheet of wood.   Here is video of someone using a baggy feeder.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdr05UtUnes  Now I wish I could claim credit for the plans or the video but they are not mine, the plans are from my local club but I didn't make the. Also I'm not much for fancy joints so I just use butt joints for the covers and screened bottom board. It's much easier to work with and good enough for me. I'm too lazy to put a nicer joint on it and it works alright."
Beekeeping,3dw1iv,Schrodenger,3,Mon Jul 20 02:20:01 2015 UTC,"Now it's not cheaper but I firmly subscribe to the all medium equipment. I don't have a bad back yet but it's coming. I know Michael Bush uses 8 frame mediums in his yard. It costs more as you need more gear but it is really nice having everything standard, and lighter.  Also Bush goes the foundationless and I've been doing the same. Putting foundation and wire into frames is a pain, the bees don't seem to care either way, but with deep frames they blow out more if you use an extractor than medium frames do.   Most of what I mentioned goes down a personal choice, which seems to be the status quo for beekeeping but I really like not putting foundation in the frames as I don't need to buy the foundation, nor do I need to put it in. It's always something you can try later. I started with all foundation initially but eventually just went to just a starter strip, and now just the wood nailed in sideways."
Beekeeping,3dw1iv,DirtyGhettoOmelette,2,Mon Jul 20 02:23:27 2015 UTC,I find that bending metal sheets was way to hard for me to get right. If I build another cover I'll just tack a piece flat on top instead of fancying it up.
Beekeeping,3dw1iv,madapiarist,2,Mon Jul 20 02:55:56 2015 UTC,The easiest way to get it right is with a tin knocker aka a bar folder.  I get my tin cut to size with the corners cut already.  Of course you have to know a guy with one you can borrow or rent.
Beekeeping,3dw1iv,Schrodenger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:27:42 2015 UTC,"Use a hand seamer, they aren't too expensive really but work really well. You could also just skip the metal all together and just go with a painted wood surface like the commercial lids."

Beekeeping,3dwpfy,dstroud,3,Mon Jul 20 04:05:22 2015 UTC,New deep in middle. Checkboard all deep frames evenly between the two. Keep brood central if possible. Honey pollen and nectar to sides.
Beekeeping,3dwpfy,amethystrockstar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:36:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the recommendation!  The only drawn deep comb I have is from the current bottom brood box so doing this without disturbing the brood nest sounds tricky.   I suppose I could take the outer frames of mostly honey from the current brood box and checkerboard those in the center, then add frames with foundation in the outer spots on both boxes? Or would it be better to preserve the current order of the frames and just move every other one up, splitting up the nest (intuitively, this worries me).  Edit: Pyramiding sounds like a good way to accomplish this, no? http://www.honeybeesuite.com/pyramiding-getting-bees-to-move-up/"
Beekeeping,3dwpfy,amethystrockstar,2,Mon Jul 20 12:19:16 2015 UTC,I've never had problems checkerboarding a healthy hive and this pyramid method still involved busting up the lower chamber and checkerboarding so I'm not sure I see a huge difference. You could just put the empty box in the middle and wait.  I'm sure they'll build in it either way  Ps what part of tx you in?

My advice, although I wasn't a part of our association starting (but I've been an officer for four years running, currently VP), is to make sure you have your constitution and by-laws (if you're getting that formal) in good order, and have an organized structure. Politics can suck and take all the fun out of it. Also take into account what your potential membership wants to see in an association. We primarily cater to hobbyists; our meetings don't do much to draw or assist commercial beekeepers (like myself, although I find it fun to network and I like seeing the creative stuff everyone comes up with).  If you need a sounding board, feel free to PM me!"

Beekeeping,3dw3hi,Farmboy9,2,Mon Jul 20 00:44:37 2015 UTC,"Ok so now you're learning the disadvantages to mixed equipment. Here are my thoughts:   hive 2 is most likely queen less and has been a few weeks maybe. Normally I'd drop a frame of fresh eggs and brood in but... well you can't exactly do that since your other 2 hives are Langstroth hive 3 is experiencing high drone populations but that's fine as long as you have plenty of worker comb.  you can feed hive 3, especially if you're in a dearth. I recommend inner feeder to reduce robbing from hive 1 hives 2 and 3 probably would benefit from entrance reducers if you're going into a summer dearth you could also remove the new box from hive 1. Then find brood and honey/nectar/pollen to supplement hive 3 and balance the power. Make sure to brush or shake off all bees from frames in hive 1 before putting them into hive 3. Since they're both in Langstroth they can benefit each other. hive 2 you could feed and give a queen. You can either try and purchase a queen or encourage hives 1 or 3 to make and cap some queen cells.  Then cut out cells carefully and graft onto combs of hive 2 of you get tired of tbh and want to move those bees to a Langstroth you can do foundationless frames and cut/rubber band the comb into Lang frames."
Beekeeping,3dw3hi,amethystrockstar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:07:43 2015 UTC,If I were to move hive 2 to a langstroth and gave them brood from hive 1 would they make an emergency queen from there? There is not very much worker brood in hive 3 should I move some over from hive 1? All of my hives are foundationless if that explains any or all of this
Beekeeping,3dw3hi,amethystrockstar,3,Mon Jul 20 01:38:09 2015 UTC,Foundationless doesn't matter really. Frames are what matters. Both those options are sort of viable... hive 2 needs a solution soon before population goes too low. I guess you could cut out some brood comb from hive 1 and try to somehow give it to hive 2 but I'm not sure how to even give cut comb to a top bar.   You can also transplant some worker brood into hive 3 if you want or just feed hive 3 either way it'll help boost them. If you go for some weird cutout maneuver of hive 1 to hive 2 then keep that in mind when giving to hive 3. Don't wanna take too much from hive 1
Beekeeping,3dw3hi,Zealtos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:46:39 2015 UTC,"You take a sharp knife and cut it to form. It's messy, ugly, and it's something that I find deeply distasteful since I have to butcher entire sections of brood for a possibility and not a guarantee of it being helpful to my TBH. This is one of those places where a long hive is what I'd prefer, but that 27 degree angle is important to foundationless hives if you don't put bottom bars in."
Beekeeping,3dw3hi,amethystrockstar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:28:59 2015 UTC,How do you make sure it doesn't fall out?
Beekeeping,3dw3hi,Zealtos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:48:29 2015 UTC,"With that kind of transplant? The langstroth topbar is the only part that moves between the hives. I'd have just ripped the nails out of that frame, so the next time I put it back together, it would be glued, which would mean the last time I'd probably modify it, otherwise face losing the equipment.  The comb is otherwise solidly built to that top bar."
Beekeeping,3dw3hi,amethystrockstar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:26:22 2015 UTC,Oh ok so the bars are same width as Lang frames. That simplifies it a lot. Just disassemble a frame haha

Beekeeping,3dvr98,Ciene,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:13:36 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah, there is a reason, like I said we only have about ten or twelve weeks left in our season, and then there will be no food, it will be cold, and whatever they have is whatever they have. I'm already gambling by letting the one hive requeen this late, I can steal brood to bolster them but not without cost to the hive the brood came from. I was just thinking that if I had a hive that could get a laying queen up and running she could produce some of her own workers and take off some of the cost from my other hives."
Beekeeping,3dvr98,Ciene,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:19:11 2015 UTC,"Right, so let them make their own queen, and they will do that. If they haven't accepted a queen in a whole week, then they don't want her. They want either the queen that you can't find, or a queen they made.   Also, you can try smoking the crap out of them, and they might accept her, they might have laying workers (doubtful) and can't tell that they have a real queen right there."

Beekeeping,3dvr98,amethystrockstar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:07:45 2015 UTC,Dude this is a mess.   your first split... did you separate it far away from the original hive? Maybe those bees just went back home let bees requeen themselves... called queen cells are not something you always have to act on you didn't get a swarm if it had comb... Idk how you went from no queen to it has a queen but either way if it had comb and such I'd wager there's a queen in there. why split the hive after you've already potentially combined queens? Just let them figure it out. Weakening them further with splitting isn't the answer. start seeking advice before going on a crazy switheroo spree. It's hard to tell what causes what and where exactly you went wrong with this long disheveled chain of events  I wish you best of luck... you should just reassess your bee situation and figure out who is queenright and who is queenless and we can help better :)
Beekeeping,3dvr98,amethystrockstar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:15:03 2015 UTC,"I actually did a kind of 'just to be sure' inspection and both hives have no queens. One has Queen cells while the other wants its queen dead.   So, yeah, I agree its a friggin mess, on the swarm colony, the owner of the property was away for a week and called saying there was a ball of bees in his bushes, I had no clue how long they had been hanging there but they had one sheet of comb with honey and eggs, guess they just gave up on finding a home and set up shop. I scooped them with my hand and they stayed in my box for exactly one night, the next morning they started leaving for a branch on a tree about 30 feet up. (I assume thats where my queen was.) I blocked the hive and took them home, and returned with a ladder, by the time I had returned however, they were gone. So that's kinda where the queen had gone, sorry I didn't include that but the post seemed long-winded enough already.   On why I split them, I've heard from several people that non-local stock is not very good around here, and the local bees are better, so I'm just letting them raise their own Queens to see if I can get the Winter Hardiness that I seem to usually lack. And I had the other Queen already so I was just trying to find a home for her.   My first split also was only only fifty yards or so from home, so yes, I'm assuming they did indeed go home. Must've used 'absond' wrong :D  Everything has kinda calmed down tho, the bees know whose who and what hive they belong too and now I play the waiting game."
Beekeeping,3dvr98,Zealtos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:48:55 2015 UTC,"I bet you had the queen to begin with if you had the comb on the swarm hive. Likely they just absconded.  I've had that happen  once with a new swarms that built on a branch and went to another branch after being boxed  As for first two queenless hives, I'd switch it up. give the frame with the capped cells to the queen haters and give queen to queen cell hive... but likely queen haters already have a queen and your bees are trying to make a queen anyways. I get it now that you were trying to get both the cell queen and the new queen in the splits, but if that hive was already suffering splitting won't help.  Gotta keep survival of hive in mind primarily. Let the hives recover then maybe you can split with local genetics and make your own queens. For now queen rearing and genetic tinkering aren't really options if all your hives are struggling and in crisis."
Beekeeping,3dvr98,amethystrockstar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:53:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thats kinda what I was thinking on doing, I was worried that the switch up would leave the Queen cells without adequate caretakers however. Also, the hive with the Queen is only a two-frame split, I have checked, re-checked, and checked again for Queens or Queen cells, and have seen neither."

Beekeeping,3dvr98,amethystrockstar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:04:16 2015 UTC,"True enough, I put the queen cell hive into a nuc about an hour ago because they are only four frames strong currently, otherwise they're good and strong.

Beekeeping,3dso3m,nemom,2,Sun Jul 19 02:53:26 2015 UTC,88-89. High humidity. I know this looks like bearding but we weren't sure because of the huge amount of them.

Also, had you smoked these bees just before photographing?"
Beekeeping,3dso3m,RW_Highwater,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:46:25 2015 UTC,There are two brood boxes and one super. Every box was pretty full. We had smoked them several hours before I took the picture.

Beekeeping,3ds70f,apocolyptictodd,3,Sun Jul 19 02:46:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, basically the bees learn their surroundings and such.  They'll fly around in erratic patterns around the hive entrance.  Often this happens after a bunch have hatched.  Bees are incredible with their ability to navigate"

Beekeeping,3dp9ez,HomieApathy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:34:03 2015 UTC,"It will grow fine. In fact, it will grow really well. Forever.   Make sure you plant it in it's own special spot well away from important bits of garden. It will send tap roots down 3 metres into the soil, which is further than many trees! For this reason, it's a really good plant to put under an orchard, as it will bring nutrients up from really deep in the soil. Bees love it."
Beekeeping,3dp9ez,yoyoyo_its_me,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:40:58 2015 UTC,"Comfrey won't ruin your soil. In permaculture, it's used to extract nutrients from the deep soil for shallower-rooted plants like trees in an orchard. I've also heard the leaves are very handy for composting, and it grows prolifically enough to keep a steady supply.  If you want a plant to ruin your soil, try lawn grass."

Beekeeping,3dp9ez,BackyardAnarchist,2,Sat Jul 18 13:14:32 2015 UTC,ya you caught me i only read the first couple paragraphs in the comfrey wiki but it uses alot of nitrogen so if you dont compost it where it grows its a net negative to your nitrogen levels.   i literally had to scroll down one more time :/
Beekeeping,3dp9ez,BackyardAnarchist,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:15:17 2015 UTC,person has no clue what they are talking about. It is actually used in organic gardening and Permaculture. It is very deep rooted and takes nutrients from those deeper root zones. It is a herbaceous perennial so every year when it dies back it's stems break down quickly releasing those same nutrients at surface level for more shallow rooted plants.

I did try that last inspection but it was hard to move all 10 frames just a tad. I kept trying apply gentle but firm pressure to get them to move, but they always ended up jerking from one end to the next. Patience was not a virtue of mine or the bees after all the time I spent trimming the comb though.  I'll try doing it frame by frame next inspection!

Beekeeping,3dn9yw,RedWingWoody,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:58:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, a hive tool is acceptable. If things go into a nectar dearth and you start seeing dead bees around your bucket, it would be better just to pop that into your mouth and eat it yourself. I have seen full blown robbing this year and it's not been pretty.  Otherwise I suggest making sure your spacing is good. Bees tend to glue up the sidebars with propolis, it's an easy mistake to not fully press the bars together again and so it builds up. You can lose entire frames worth of space this way, so my close up method is to press them all together to one side, then center all my frames. This requires my tool and leverage."

Beekeeping,3dn9yw,Zealtos,2,Fri Jul 17 19:27:19 2015 UTC,"Space the frames properly, make sure your frames are waxed, put properly filled out frames next to undrawn frames if you can (this promotes them building it properly on the empty frame), and then you just battle with them.  Scrape off improper comb every two weeks.  Don't let it build up wrong for too long.  Once it is drawn out you can keep the comb for multiple years, so it is worth the patience."
Beekeeping,3dn9yw,Zealtos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:43:33 2015 UTC,"First year beekeeper here. My local beekeeping shop recommended I use black plastic foundation to help me see the eggs development phase to larvae to emerging in order to better learn about the bees. The hive builds the first 7 frame perfectly then starts this nonsense where they build weird comb or bridge it across to the adjacent frame. That pattern of 7 good, 3 bad has held true for 2 hives with two deep supers each (the last supers added a month ago). Any advice?"
Beekeeping,3dn9yw,Zealtos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:35:53 2015 UTC,"In addition to proper spacing, preferably between two already drawn frames which is hard as a starting beekeeper try adding some extra wax to the frames.   Scrap off what is here and melt it down. Take an old paint brush and brush that over the embossed cells so it has a good coat of wax.  It also helps if there is a good consistent nectar flow coming in when you add frames. Putting in frames during a dearth (a lot of the country in the heat now) or sporadic nectar flows tends to make them do some strange things, like take wax away from one place and use it elsewhere. The did better earlier in the season because there was a good nectar flow. Feeding them if you have removed the supers can help draw comb. The number of young bees also makes a difference, recently emerged workers tend to make more wax than older ones. If the queen has slowed down laying because of a dearth there are fewer younger bees to make wax.  Oh and not really helpful at all just quit using plastic and use wax because they don't tend to do this sillyness as much on wax."

If it turned out CCD was caused by some sort of spore forming bacteria going back and seeing how long its viable would very valuable.

You are making assumptions you know what CCD is and what future technologies would be available to investigate it.   As far as a reviewer that all depends on exactly how the hive was preserved and if a proper scientist could show that it was preserved in such a way that spores didn't enter afterwards now doesn't it? No one questioned the flu virus in the bodies preserved buried in permafrost inside coffins because it was clear the virus didn't come from an outside source after death. it all depends on what is found and what they are looking for in those hives later.

However, just like dogs, humans selectively breed honeybees for traits that we desire.  This significantly speeds up ""evolution"".  Plenty of scientists the world over are working to breed bees that are resistant to the threats they face right now and it will happen much faster than nature could ever do on it's own."

Beekeeping,3dmzem,Zealtos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:04:02 2015 UTC,"They burn foulbrood hives.  It is so contagious its cheaper and easier to burn the bees.  Some bees can survive with it for a prolonged period of time, but they pretty much always die.  Burning bees and equipment is cheaper and easier as a commercial person than letting it wipe out your whole apiary.  Aggressive euthanasia of the bees has proven very effective and it is relatively uncommon now."
Beekeeping,3dmzem,NosemaCeranae,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:42:29 2015 UTC,"It depends. You are assuming that evolutionary resistance is going to happen faster than extinction.  Presumably the survivors would be genetically resistant, but that does NOT mean they will pass that trait on (necessarily)  Such genetic resistances are likely to be recessive.  After all, if they were dominant, the bees would already have that trait.  So, hybrids (of all forms of life) are typically one offs.  For instance, suppose I cross breed a rose that is immune to all rose diseases.  The seeds produced by this rose will seldom pass the traits on since they are recessive in nature. The way I mass produce these traits is to repeatedly cross breed the roses.  Suppose Rose_A+Rose_B=Rose_C and Rose_C had highly desirable traits.  Since those traits are likely to be recessive, the offspring of Rose_C will not have them unless Rose_C is pollinated with another Rose_A, Rose_B or Rose_C.  So, the challenge is to take these bees that survived and breed them with other bees that survived.  Of course, with bees, this is even more of a challenge since one of the survivors must be a queen and one must be a drone. To add another layer of convolution, the queen has presumably already been bred and therefore cannot be crossed with a surviving drone. However, this does NOT mean she wasn't bred by a drone with the recessive trait.    I am not saying this is impossible, though.  But with highly destructive diseases and pests, it is unlikely that a recessive trait will get passed on.  Not impossible, but highly unlikely.  These genetically resistant bees are unlikely to happen naturally.  It takes careful manipulation to get it reliably.  Now, suppose the trait is only marginally recessive...say half of the bees have the trait.  Now the extinction rate is much lower.  All of the dominant genes die off and the recessive genes are all that's left.  That is a workable genetic solution to many hive pests and diseases, but it requires that the trait be only marginally recessive."
Beekeeping,3dmzem,Zealtos,0,Sat Jul 18 02:40:00 2015 UTC,Cancer is mainly a disease that you get after you have already reproduced so there is not as much pressure to select against it. Also a relatively small amount of the population develop cancer.
Beekeeping,3dmzem,NosemaCeranae,2,Fri Jul 17 16:28:06 2015 UTC,"Cancer is far more common than you realize, what you've described as ""getting"" cancer is what happens after it's out of the control of the white blood cells. It is not uncommon for you to get around 11,000 cancer cells each day, out of your 100 trillion, which are then culled out by the white blood cells. Essentially everyone gets cancer.  Moving onto your questions, I think your lady is talking about AFB, which we burn because it's like smallpox for bees and is both virulent and extremely difficult to control once an outbreak occurs.  Evolution would be the answer to CCD, if it was caused by a single factor like poison, instead it's often a multitude of factors which contribute to an overall stress between things like disease, poison, pests, poor nutrition, etc."

In other words it must cross the basement membrane.  A single cell may be dysplastic, or unusual, but that doesn't make it cancer."

Beekeeping,3dje7v,witehare,7,Thu Jul 16 20:42:18 2015 UTC,"Looks pretty normal for an exposed comb hive. The wax is white because its unused, it gets darker as bees spin cocoons in it. Its only a single comb because they were not there very long. What probably happened was a swarm clustered on a branch then before they could find a cavity it started raining and rained for 3-4 days. The bees started building comb just in case but as soon as the rain stopped they found a cavity and moved on.  We see that sort of thing in the south of the U.S. and in particular South Florida much more often. Bees can survive the winter exposed down there. If the bees in this hive had been exposed in winter they would be dead. Its unusual for them to do it in the north and it would be temporary, usually because conditions suddenly became bad enough the bees couldn't fly and stayed that way for a few days."

Beekeeping,3diei9,UnicornProfessional,3,Thu Jul 16 16:21:21 2015 UTC,"Well, the way it was explained to me is this. Workers generally land and walk into the hive, and so they focus on the pheromones that are on the landing board. When you put up the screen, they start walking around it without any issues.  Robbers focus on the pheromones from inside the hive, so they try to fly directly in. This also helps get them past the guard bees, because they're coming in super fast to get as far in the hive as possible as quickly as possible.  A robbing screen will prevent them from flying directly in, I was told if you sit out you can actually watch bees bounce off of it, confused. They can't figure out how to get around it, and if they do they're moving slowly enough that the guard bees can keep them out.  That's how it was explained to me anyway."

Beekeeping,3djdmd,peachesinyogurt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:14:23 2015 UTC,"Just went through this. A friend offered his small lot to keep my bees on, I agreed since it is gated and located about four kilometres out of town.  Problem was that the gentleman who owned the adjacent lot, his son was allergic to bees (or so he says) and spends a lot of time out there sawing wood. I decided to call the son and try my best to explain to him that he is in no danger at all unless he actually tries to disturb the hive. He wouldn't have any of it so I gave up and decided to put my bees in my yard to avoid any conflict between anyone (jokes on him because he's three doors down from me).   My best advice to you is education. Educate the land owner on the matter and assure him he's in no danger nor is anybody around him unless they deliberately disturb the hive. For extra good measure tell him to stay about ten to fifteen feet away from the entrance because this is the bees flight path before they get up and out of your hair.   Seek legal advice, a consultation cost me $50. However, this is my area. Your prices may vary with lawyers. My lawyer told me people can sue, but people can sue you because they fell at the end of your driveway. He told me that they'd have to prove it was in fact my bee that done did the stingin'. Most likely a case that'd be thrown out.   Is it a big piece of property? Is it used for anything else? You may want to get the owner to stick up some no trespassing signs.   Is there anybody that owns anything around it? If so, you can a. Include them or b. Avoid and deal with the crap, if any, later.   I hope you don't have the issues I did. Good luck."

To me, the two most important things are access and genetics. I make sure with the owner that I'm free to work on the hives whenever I want/need to and I can access on my own. Second thing is genetics - make sure you have docile bees. Don't hesitate to replace the queen if they are aggressive. Zero tolerance.  As for liability, we (in Germany) are required to have insurance. Most beekeping clubs handle this for their members, so if you are in a club and pay your fees, you have insurance."
Beekeeping,3djdmd,Zealtos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:25:51 2015 UTC,"I'm an urban beekeeper with hives on other people's yards. Usually the things I have in writing are that the hive and it's contents belong to me and whatever the state/county want in writing for legal stuff. I check HOA if it's applicable.   To me, a bad situation is one where the homeowner suddenly doesn't like me, I leave, and then come back, am not permitted to the hive and am informed that my services are terminated. If I don't have the documentation signed by myself and the home owner showing that I'm the owner of the hive, they could possibly claim it as theirs and fight me in court or mediation over it where there's a possibility of them actually keeping it.  Worst case for people claiming stings and liability, especially if I've fenced off the bees, is me saying things I don't want to with ""My bees are inside my hive, I don't own the ones outside. Were you stung by a bee inside or outside my hive?"" That helps most people to stop, otherwise they have to actually prove that the bee came from my hive.  Lastly, because of how law can work, it can be dangerous to post warning signs to help people protect themselves since it makes you liable for recognizing the possibility of danger, check your local laws though."

I have hives about 6 miles apart. Nectar flow at one site slows to a crawl month a before the other site which takes off in June when the Chinese Tallow bloom. The charts and maps would lead you to believe both sites have the same, or nearly the same nectar flows which they don't.   Florida has its own forage maps, your state might also. But looking at the map at both sites it tells me they should be right on cabbage palm territory.

However, for some people, tax deductible donations are very important and people are looking for them."
Beekeeping,3di0wt,Ciene,3,Sat Jul 18 11:46:24 2015 UTC,"Hives cost around $200 each.  Suits around $100.  Feed is $2-4 per gallon, and you are going to need to feed sometimes 4 gallons per month (I estimate around 12-20 gallons per hive in my area).  You will need to treat 2-3 times per year ($4 per treatment).  You will need to visit each of your hives once every two weeks, so you need to maintain roughly 250 hives per week.  Want to move your bees?  They are heavy.  You will need a truck and a lot of manpower or a forklift.  You will need liability insurance (roughly 1-2k per year).  You will need all your licenses and permits (another 1k per year). Then there is the other big equipment?  Are you melting wax? Gonna need a wax melter and some candle molds.  Honey?  On 500 hives you will need a pretty significantly large extractor system or a LOT of time.  What about storage for all the equipment not on the hives?  You could put 2 or more honey supers on per hive.   Thats 1000+ boxes you need to store when they aren't in use, plus all the boxes from dead hives.  Plus the trucks extractors and all that.   Then theres taxes and fees and regulatory payments you need to make.  You claim you will be a non profit but I honestly don't know enough about taxes to say it won't work...but it sounds like a farm like any other.  You are probably looking at around $200k plus to get started plus costs to maintain everything as stock dies and equipment breaks and so on.  You then want to put hives in peoples back yards.  People are hard to deal with.  They have dogs, kids, parties, and want to mow the lawn.  Every sting is potential for someone to go to the hospital, and that will cost you a LOT of money.  So what are the 500 hives for?  You are trying to make a profit by keeping the bees in back yards and making honey?  Honey sells $15 per lb if you are REALLY savvy and take a lot of time.  You have to get bottles, labels, and licenses.  You have to set up a shop and explain to people over and over again that your honey is local organic and it is SO much better than the store because of x and y.  Or you can wholesale it.  $2 per lb.    Then theres the beekeeping lessons?  How will that work?  Do you plan on setting up a beekeepers association?  Setting up associations is hard work.  Managing them is even harder.  Where will you teach?  It is hard to find a land owner who is open to having strangers on his land, especially when theres a chance the strangers could get stung by bees or injure themselves.    Selling equipment?  If you can get equipment and sell it cheaper than the online sources then great!  Otherwise you have stiff competition.  Don't forget you have to add sales tax to all of the stuff you sell.  All your services too.  On the subject of taxes you will need to be registered with every state, county, and city you operate in.  Each one of those costs money too.  You then say you want to be a non profit.  I honestly am not a tax person, and I have no idea how that will work...but more power to you!  There are a lot of beekeepers out there.  It is a very competitive market.  Don't let people fool you, there is a lot of money to be made if you can figure it out, but there's a lot of money to be lost if you mess up.  Beekeeping is honestly not a very lucrative business, and I have seen a lot of beekeepers give up for a 9-5 job because it pays better."
Beekeeping,3di0wt,Ciene,2,Thu Jul 16 19:22:36 2015 UTC,Thank you for taking the time to respond.  We know that the start up costs are high.  It's why we are trying to throw together an attractive crowd funding package.  I'll try to answer some of your questions as i come across them.  Some of this equipment we already have.  Half of our unit has been involved in beekeeping for 10 years as a hobby and some at a professional apiary.  No one there wears bee suits.  I dont wear one either.  Managed to go all summer so far and only took 3 stings.  We had planned not to feed unless the hives have a lot of comb to draw out but both of us realize that me may have to.  That cost is factored in.  We have all of our licensing but it was much cheaper then your estimate.    Our beekeeping lessons are simple.  We have people come and watch as we work in the apiary.  We let them go hands on and talk about different aspects of the hobby.  We let it run for a month and a half.  We would teach it at our home where our bees are.  We plan on selling equipment locally.  we are withing driving distance to an Amish community who makes amazing quality beehives.  If we buy in bulk and pay up front and in cash our discount is really high.  This will allow us to assemble and paint them ourselves and we can charge about what most places charge for a single hive.    We have access to a commercial extractor that we can use.  We will have to use it at shitty hours but we will get to use it for next to nothing.  Our insurgence is just that insurance.  We pay it so we dont have to worry about all those things.  I'm not talking abut putting a beehive in the yard of a person who does not want it.  If they are agreeing to own a beehive i assume they know it comes with bees.

Beekeeping,3dee3x,JacobLambda,3,Wed Jul 15 21:35:04 2015 UTC,"We have a lot of those in my country, but in Slovenia they use them 95% of time, purely because of tradition. Those hives are called A≈Ω (Alberti-≈Ωnidar≈°iƒçeva ko≈°nica). You insert frames into it as you would put books back into bookshelf as seen in this photo  There are 2 types of it: A≈Ω grom and A≈Ω standard, small differences in dimensions.  Pros of A≈Ω: Smaller frames, you have to work only with frames, not boxes so it is easier to handle if you are older or are having bees just as hobby.  Cons of A≈Ω: If honey flow is high you can't make hive bigger like you could with LR hives, so you have to extract honey more frequently.  All around this have will not get you same amount of honey you could get with LR hives.  If someone wants to know exact dimensions i could get that information from my hive maker. Feel free to ask me any questions on those hives."

I've been searching around and see a lot of people in North America interested in playing around with this style of hive, but nobody can find plans and it's hard to even find suppliers of pre-built hives. I imagine somebody could make a nice little business shipping these around the states.  I wonder, do people using these hives only take out one frame at a time, and do they have a problem with ""rolling bees"" accidentally as they re-insert the frame? Or do they take out one frame and keep it out to create extra space for manipulating the rest of the frames (as is typically done with Langstroth hives)? I hope that question makes sense.  Also, a video on youtube suggested that the windows inside the door are optional and mostly used for transport. Do you find that to be true? It would seem the bees would make a mess in the non-frame areas if you didn't always use the interior windows."

I live in one of the top 10 tallest residential buildings in the US, and these guys chose to take up residence on my terrace.   There has been some debate as to whether or not we should let them find their own home, or relocate them to a new owner. And I think we're going to relocate them with the Chicago Park District. They have a nature center with some other hives they use for educational purposes.  I went this route because I'm not sure if they will find a home in the middle of downtown Chicago where they are wanted! And their new home may be subject to extermination.

Beekeeping,3dekqn,pinkbits,2,Thu Jul 16 05:23:10 2015 UTC,"No, austenite is a grain structure that occurs in steel.  What happens is a queen will age and either due to a decrease in her fecundity or more likely a decrease in pheromones she produces the colony will decide that a replacement is in order (by a democratic process believe it or not!).  A replacement is reared who flies off, mates, and returns to the hive to begin her work as a queen. Rather than a fight to the death, which is neither necessary nor beneficial to the hive or the new queen, the old queen will continue laying until she dies."
Beekeeping,3dekqn,austenite,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:34:17 2015 UTC,Wouldn't that be more desirable to a single queen setup?  Then the queen on the way out can keep up production as much as she's able until the younger one starts and they'll theoretically be producing more until the older one dies.

Beekeeping,3dbwyp,berticus,6,Wed Jul 15 01:56:17 2015 UTC,"I never understood the ""breeding programs."" All queen breeders selecting queens that don't die, make a lot of honey, require minimal feeding, and are acceptably gentle.  Literally every single one.  We emphasize some traits over others, but in the end if bees aren't strong to mites they don't survive long enough to be breeding stock.  You don't have to be a scientist.  You don't have to count the opened brood cells.  Just breed bees that don't die, make honey, and are nice.    The biggest problem in my opinion is the vast majority of beekeepers are afraid of making their own queens.  They import genetics that they hope work well in their area even though the breeder is sometimes thousands of miles away, and spend $17-25 per queen instead of spending 2-3 hours per week to make 30-100 queens.  I am biased, and I have my own anecdotal evidence.  For the last 3 years I haven't had the money to buy queens, so I had to make my own.  This year I haven't had to treat any of my roughly 100 hives.  It is a very small sample size compared to the large companies, but it makes me very optimistic for the future.  My only problem is that my ""acceptable defense"" is a little more aggressive than most people, but over time I think I can calm them down."
Beekeeping,3dbwyp,BryansBees,4,Wed Jul 15 04:40:42 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of beekeepers don't have hives they can dedicate to raising 30-100 queens. Most are hobbyists with fewer than 10 hives and many have only 1 or 2. They are breeding with who knows what drones from ferals nearby and other apiaries. Queen breeders are forced to maintain adequate European drone sources, random beekeeper in South Florida or the South West doesn't have that luxury.  Even in North Florida I can point out which hives have raised queens and which have purchased ones. The ones with raised queens in my apiary are assholes, the drone sources in the area are much more defensive than proven European ones from hundreds (I only order from S. Georgia and Florida now, CA queens didnt do so well) of miles away.  Then you get to losses. If you have 100 hives losing one doesn't matter as much, or you have the resources to requeen from another hive or combine them. With fewer hives having a single hive lose a queen, and fail to raise one (dragonflies are my enemy they destroy my virgin queens regularly) its much harder to recover. A single hive down in my 10 hive apiary is 10% of my hives, a guy with 2 hives looses 50% when he looses one and if something happens to the queen in the one he has left he is in trouble.   These are also the same people who don't check for mites and have no idea why their hives die only showing us pictures weeks later. If we get the genetics out to them it helps us all. They are not contributing good genetics, they are just holding on. I have already had one guy who bought a nuc from me come back 5 weeks later and get another because he killed them (overrun with SHB, probably lost the queen before that).    Then you go to the larger end. Once beekeeping becomes a real commercial business you don't have time to raise queens too busy traveling around to pollination contracts. Most those guys aren't going to check for mites anyway and treat and requeen on a schedule as it is. If they can spend $20 on a queen per hive and reduce the price of both treatment and labor installing that treatment all the better. They don't care about locally adapted queens, no where is local when you go from CA to FL to ME in a year. It costs them less to spend $20 a hive than setting up a permanent apiary staffing that apiary and raising their own queens.  Yes the programs matter. The time it takes for an unmanaged hive to die of varroa is generally said to be about 2 years. You are benefiting from them since as the genetics spread out into the world your bees get those traits. Yes you might eventually develop them on your own in isolation, or you might not.   We are purposefully trying to sort circuit what should be thousands of years of evolution in a short amount of time. In this case towards a specific goal. The breeding programs are the way to do that quickly, the way you are doing it might get there eventually, or might not.  Also if your neighbors are buying program bred queens the drones your queens are mating with are contributing those genes to your stock even if you don't have them already.  If I had 100 hives I would be getting at least a few queens a year from diverse sources just to try and introduce more diversity into my yards. Then selecting the best of those and the ones I raised to retain an introducing more variety next year. Evolution can only work with what it has. If your bees don't have good traits they may never do a good job against varroa. Your other management techniques may be covering up and compensating for less varroa resistance. Adding those traits to your stock can only help in the long run."
Beekeeping,3dbwyp,svarogteuse,2,Wed Jul 15 13:53:33 2015 UTC,"On the small scale end you are absolutely right.  Hobbiest beekeepers can't contribute much to the gene pool.  Though there are many of them, they are generally not in a position to breed, and compared to the thousands of hives commercial beekeepers have they are a drop in the bucket.  I still think they can raise their own queens very effectively and easily by taking frames with queen cups and using them to make splits cheaply and easily, but in the end that is not always possible or simple enough.  My main concern is the commercial guys.  The first point you made was about the word ""local.""  Beekeepers do migrate, so the word local may not have been the best choice.  At the end of the day the beekeeper you described needs bees that can survive travlling from CA to FL to ME in a year, and survive the beekeeper's treatments, and overall treatment over the course of a year.  In this case they just need to survive the beekeeper.  If the beekeeper selects his best bees every year then he is selecting for bees that will work great for him.  That is part of why I think beekeepers need to breed their own bees.  Every beekeeper puts his or her bees through a different experience.  A different gauntlet.  What is good for that beekeeper may not matter to another at all.  Having his own bees that do well for him is awesome.    In terms of cost, which is my biggest factor that I care about, queens are $20.  You sound like a commercial guy.  You know that beekeepers can keep 1,000+ hives per beekeeper.  In a large operation you can use a LOT of queens.  In one operation I worked for I think we used 1,500 queens per year.  Assuming the queens are $20 each (depending on dead loss and shipping it can be more like $25 certain times of year) that is $30,000 spent on queens.  You can almost hire a new guy to JUST raise queens for that, not to mention all the other value they can generate the rest of the year.  I don't know anything about the 2 year quote.  Hives I have seen decline VERY rapidly.  Any time you are selecting your own bees you are fast tracking the progress.  Every beekeeper is by selecting for traits, rather than randomly letting survivors breed.  Artificial insemination gives a little more control, but keeping my strongest bees in one yard where I mate my queens isn't all bad either.  I can't always control all the genetics, but that is good.  Some randomness discourages inbreeding and can introduce beneficial traits that I did not previously have.  A significant portion of my hives are from swarm and hive removals as well, which surely introduces bad genes into my stock, but I don't view that as a problem.  Any weak genetics that are unacceptable will eventually be weeded out by starvation, parasites and pathogens, or by me squishing them for behaving in an unacceptable manner.  My bees never have to be perfect.  They probably never will be.  It is biology, so what is perfect anyways?  My bees will probably never be immune to everything.  I don't expect them to.  Sometimes Chalk Brood, beetles, Tracheal Mite, and other stuff pops up.  It happens.  Using my own bees and my own genetics I feel makes a very big impact on my own stock, perfect or not."
Beekeeping,3dbwyp,BryansBees,2,Thu Jul 16 03:24:57 2015 UTC,"Bryan, selective breeding is a little more complicated than if they die or not. In natural selection, there are two major components involved.  First, you have selective pressure. In our case, this is varroa, brood diseases, winter severity, beekeeping practices, and nectar supplies (among many others). This part doesn't take experimental conditions or a scientist to understand. To a degree, if selective pressure were the only component here, it would be better for everyone to make their own queens, since the conditions change slightly depending on where you are.   The second component of natural selection is more complicated. This is genetic diversity. The depth of the gene pool decides how successful natural selection processes can be. The ""most fit"" queen for any pressure depends on how many queens there are, and their genetic diversity. In the case of making your own queens, this is where your abilities (and mine, as a scientist myself) fall short. Our gene pool consists of our current queen's genetics, as well as the genetics of any queens in drone mating distance. The more those other beekeepers make their own queens, the more similar our stocks become, making our collective genepool smaller. Generation to generation mutations still occur, and there will always be queens that are more ""fit"" than others, but this is a ""hands off"" approach which ignores the advances of science and relies on nature to fix itself. It will, we've seen that in countries that have had Varroa for thousands of years, but our beekeeping culture will be destroyed in the thousands of years point mutations take to make these advances.   Then, you have the scientific approach. You look at a broader gene pool, including a variety of common varieties, as well as uncommon ones that are known to have traits you want. You cross-breed for wanted traits, and determine the genes involved. This accelerates the process by thousands of years, taking the work nature has already done and applying it to our bees. This is what you and I cannot do at home. If we rely on the forces of nature, we will have to live with the higher hive losses varroa and other parasites and diseases have brought us.   That's not to say introducing queens is perfect. Obviously, success rates with installed queens vary. I'm very new, and have little experience to go on, but I do find it peculiar that some people have absolutely no luck with them, while others will tell you they requeen all of their hives every year with almost no issues (and just get a replacement when they do). I for one will be looking to get some good genetic stock going in my apiary, but to each their own. I'm not trying to tell you how to keep your bees, and I hope I didn't come across as rude. I just wanted to point out why this research IS important, and must continue for the betterment of our trade and/or hobby."
Beekeeping,3dbwyp,laharre,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:33:28 2015 UTC,"Aren't a lot of things like this due to too much human intervention in the first place though? Is the answer really more human intervention?  Bees are under attack from humans. It's our fault they are dying off. And because we're lazy, rather than stopping the attack on them, we want to create ones that don't mind us attacking them quite so much?"
Beekeeping,3dbwyp,offense_taken_now,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:52:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's due to human intervention.  That same argument would mean that we would stop trying to do anything about climate change, deforestation, endangered species, and loss of habitat.  We're a very destructive society because we have moved beyond the basic laws of nature.  Unless we go back to hunter-gatherers, we will continue to have a negative impact on the environmental balance.  The best option is to use our toolbox to try and undo some of the damage we have done to the environment.  This means using science to help nature.    As far as gentleness goes, that's a double-sided coin.  Selective breeding is used both for survival (resistance to mites and disease) and human benefit (honey yield, gentleness).  The first, because it is needed to sustain our use of the honeybee in agriculture, the second because it makes selective breeding more profitable (the government funds a lot of the research, but you still need to sell the queens to make a profit, and to get the genetics where they're needed).    Honeybees wouldn't even be in North America without our intervention, not to mention all of the parasites and diseases.  It is our global economy that has spread their entire set of parasites and diseases to all but a few small corners of the world.  If we do nothing, honeybees will survive on their own, but beekeeping as a hobby and business will become unsustainable.  I for one feel that we have an obligation to use science and technology in every way we can to benefit the environment."
Beekeeping,3dbwyp,laharre,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:04:06 2015 UTC,"A better analogy would be that instead of reducing our environmental impact to combat climate change, we try and make the planet more resilient to our relentless attack.  The biggest issue is our relentless breeding. In the last 30 years our population has doubled. If we don't do something about the population explosion pretty soon we'll be the victims of our own success. And if we don't tackle that big issue, any attempts at helping out honeybees / the environment / endangered species etc will be wasted effort.  Personally, I would rather see far less scientific intervention in the environment. It's shown time and time again that it messes things up far more than it helps."
Beekeeping,3dbwyp,offense_taken_now,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:12:37 2015 UTC,"True, I'm definitely not saying that anything we do science/technology wise is going to ""fix"" the problems we are causing. We, as scientists, are near-religious in our love of nature, as science is the study of the natural order. We are simply trying to patch this thing every time we see a leak, hoping that the idiotic politicians shut their mouths long enough to listen to the facts and DO something. (obligatory Bernie 2016 propaganda). Selective breeding will help keep bees a part of our agriculture while the politicians fight over what to do about bigger problems like climate change and genetic modification."
Beekeeping,3dbwyp,laharre,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:18:18 2015 UTC,"This is a really weird topic.  Bees aren't from the US, or really most of the places they are found now.  They are introduced.  Really they are invasive, displacing local pollinators.  Humans need bees, and not just the hive or two per acre that would occur naturally, but sometimes up to 4 per acre on orchards.  If humans disappeared the bees would CRASH.  I don't think they would go extinct, but without us feeding and caring for them their numbers in the world would decline sharply before it stabilized.  At least that is what I think.  Bees are under attack from parasites, pathogens, and the pesticides from the very plants that make their mass existence possible.  Without pesticides we wouldn't have access to the number of plants and money and resources that is keeping the artificial system of bees we have alive.  Humans may be impacting the bees, but without the very crops poisoning them they would die because the beekeeper couldn't afford to care for them.  On the aggression note, this artificial system also demands that the bees not hurt the farmers.  If the bees are too aggressive to get contracts the bees lose their value, and ultimately die, so docile bees are important, but I don't think they need to be as docile as we are making them."
Beekeeping,3dbwyp,BryansBees,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:24:19 2015 UTC,"A couple of thoughts:  First of all, it sounds like you're arguing that breeding one's own queens will reduce diversity.  While it's true that if all the beekeepers in a town stopped buying queens from other places you might see a homogenization of the gene pool, it will also mean that global beekeeping won't lose the genes in that region.  As someone studying how long-lived isolated forest bee populations resist Varroa, I often lament the fact that everyone is buying queens from the same few stocks across the country, meaning that national genetic diversity is getting hurt.  That being said, if queen breeders do find genes that confer Varroa resistance, buying those queens and mixing them with locally adapted stocks will likely be the best way to fight back against Varroa.  And second, no place has had Varroa destructor for thousands of years.  Varroa jacobsoni have lived on the Asian honey bee species Apis cerana for a very long time, (probably millennia) but V. jacobsoni jumped onto European honey bees and speciated into V. destructor about a hundred years ago, as best we can tell.  Just so all the beekeepers here have that in mind.  This is a VERY new problem, and does warrant attention."
Beekeeping,3dbwyp,Macracanthorhynchus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:42:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info on Varroa!  I believe what I had heard was probably referring to jacobsoni.   As far as diversity, I agree on all fronts. Diversity wouldn't disappear unless everyone in an area raised their own queens, and even then would just be smaller. The problem is, many mentors and associations teach just that.   As far as national queen suppliers, I completely agree. Your average California mass produced queen is just as bad, if not worse, than your own. My cheap packages I started with had queens that were nothing to be proud of. One was bad enough the girls replaced her, the other is doing alright, if not stellar. The breeding I was defending was true selective breeding, like the USDA program. This has already yielded steps in the right direction, like hygienic queens that have been well received, and VSH/pol-line, which has yet to catch on but has higher efficacy against Varroa."
Beekeeping,3dbwyp,laharre,2,Wed Jul 15 14:58:19 2015 UTC,"Right.  Hygienic fights chalkbrood, not so much Varroa.  VSH is more effective, but dreadfully hard to test and select for. (Trust me.  I spend a lot of my days doing it!)"
Beekeeping,3dbwyp,Macracanthorhynchus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:53:57 2015 UTC,That's why these breeders are so important. I'm sad that Glenn Apiaries got out of the game right before I started. I'm hoping to track down some VSH/pol-line queens when I start requeening.
Beekeeping,3dbwyp,laharre,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:09:29 2015 UTC,"Sorry in advance.  This is going to be a long rant.  We both agree that the first component is the main part beekeepers have control over, so I am going to skip over most of that part.  One of the key things I seem to have not emphasized is mating the strongest of the surviving stock, not any old survivors.  In terms of genetic diversity there is a HUGE variety of bees.  Carniolans, Italians, Cordovans, and Russians just to name the most common ones, and of those every breeder's strain is a little bit different.  You are correct.  I will never have access to unlimited genes.  I will never make perfect stock.  That is the beauty about biology though, nothing is ever perfect.  I bring in swarms, I try to introduce new genes through other breeders, and I do what I can to prevent inbreeding, but you are right, I will never have access to all strains of bees, and I will never make the perfect queen.  Especially since bee genetics are so finicky and we will probably never fully understand how they work.  I don't think the universities will either, though.  The second half of that paragraph is where you lose me a little.  To pretend I have a smaller gene pool with 100 bees on three locations surrounded by at least 5 other commercial beekeepers, and lord knows how many hobbiest beekeepers while universities tend to have VERY small sample sizes is a bit unfair.  They may have a larger selection than I realize but universities tend to have less than 50 hives (usually a lot less), and the sample size is usually very small by the end of the experiment.  One university breeder I met ended the year with 10 hives of his stock left, and that is not uncommon.  Everyone buys from different breeders, moves their bees to different states, and there is a HUGE potential for a lot of mixing of genes.  Most universities have one location and import bees and try to use artificial insemination.  They have more control for sure, but I don't know about more access to diversity.  Over time close beekeepers may get more genetically similar bees, but with the overall bee migrations (especially given how many bees are on almonds in February) there will always be a huge mixing potential.  Also, I was under the impression Varroa was relatively new, having recently hopped over to honey bees from a bumble bee species.  I don't think bees have been battling Varroa very long, and specifically they have only been battling Varroa for (less than?) 30 years in the US.  Most beekeepers do not raise their own queens.  They typically order them from out of state.  By importing bees from foreign stocks there is little adaptation or evolution occurring.  Beekeepers take their strong genetics and throw it away every time they purchase queens from far away places.  Especially Kona queens, which did not have Varroa until I believe last year.  I also don't think our beekeeping culture is really in danger at all.  I had 4 hives roughly 3 years ago.  Now I am hoping to break 100 this year.  Our bees are plenty strong to survive, grow, and thrive with proper care.  What we really want is to improve our stock to be more productive with less inputs.  I am sure my stock would all die out if I just left them alone.  The idea is to improve my stock over time.    The only great advancement in science that the programs are using is artificial insemination.  There have been discoveries in genetics and very intricate details about bee genes, but I am skeptical that is helping them be much more productive than every other beekeper who uses artificial insemination, and there are a few.  There is at least one person using artificial insemination to select queens in Ventura County, where I am from, and there is at least one person doing the same in LA county, which is right next door.  The university using the same method doesn't make them all that special.  Is it REALLY that much better than wild mating though?  A queen mates with roughly 10 drones, and I don't honestly know what the drones have to do to mate successfully, but I am skeptical that the method does not damage the queen, And I wouldn't be surprised if it promoted drone genes which are less than ideal for natural mating.  How do we know that mated queen is vastly superior than one that just mated in the yard around the same drones?  I am not sure we do.  We hope it is better, but that is not the same thing.  Literally every beekeeper in the country could be doing at least open mating, which is not perfect and not without challenges and risks, but is honestly pretty simple, it can save a lot of money, and it can push bees in a more positive direction than purchasing far away queens does.    Few beekeepers mate their own queens.  Beekeepers in California introduce queens from Hawaii, Texas, the Dakotas, and other states.  These are not states with fires, drought, and cool ocean currents.  These are states with hive beetles, flooding, and high humidity.  Sometimes even snow, which is totally alien to our environment.  These are bees that are treated for mites in ways that a California beekeeper may never use, introducing the stock to totally new miticides, pesticides, and other chemicals.  Then when these bees die, they are replaced with more queens from the same or other far away places, rather than locally adapted bees.  I will never pretend to be perfect, but every year it feels like I need to feed and medicate a little less, and I produce a little more.  Anecdotal evidence at best, but I don't have the time or patience to run a full survey, and in the end I am saving a lot of money making my own queens.  I feel other beekeepers could benefit in a similar way.  Part of raising your own queens is introducing them once they are fully raised, and that is a really fun beekeeping discussion.  A typical acceptable take rate on introduced queens is 70%, but you are right, it varies tremendously.  There is no evidence to support this claim, but in my experience the closer related a hive is to the introduced queen the more likely they are to accept her.  If you change queen breeders you will likely have an abysmal take rate.  If you raise your own queens you will have a GREAT take rate.  I actually had a minor accident and had a queen hatch early while I had no queen cages available.  I introduced her to a hive by letting her walk in.  She didn't seem to have any bees jump on her, and a queen was laying in that hive 2 weeks later.  It appeared to be a complete success.  Meanwhile if I purchase from a new breeder even leaving a queen in a 5 frame nuc for 5 days isn't enough time.  Bees will sting and kill her immediately upon release.  That being said, the bees will immediately try to replace her, and generally do so successfully.  No matter what you do you will need to introduce queens in some way though, if I make my own queens, queen cups, or introduce someone elses.  We all want strong stock.  Every single one of us.  I just don't understand why when the university does it that it is big news, while literally every other queen breeder out there is striving for the same exact goal, and they don't get any credit.    We may not be measuring everything as directly as the universities do, I don't see any reason why universities are more fit to make a super bee than literally every single queen breeder in the country."
Beekeeping,3dbwyp,BryansBees,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:17:24 2015 UTC,"I understand your points!  I think one of the biggest confusions in our argument is that it has become a battle of absolutes. It sounds like your queen raising situation is pretty good, high colony counts in the area, swarms, and likely the commercial beekeepers around you bring in plenty of new blood. On the other hand, you have ""generic"" breeders that do nothing special. Artificial insemination by itself is no better or worse than the old fashioned way.   The main advantage of breeding research is in the genes. Yes, Varroa is a new problem, but that doesn't mean resistance genes can't exist. Resistance genes often are carryovers from similar threats, that help when a new threat appears and make their genetic stock more fit. The research that really has the potential to help is the research hunting genes, not just breeding for the sake of it. Hygienic queens, and much more importantly VSH queens, are great examples of this. The benefit these stocks have over survival stock is that we know they have resistance genes, that confer that resistance to their offspring. Survival stock is important, and is how many of the genes researchers are looking for originated, but an ""island"" of survival stock will never be as good as it could be with resistance genes. If you, or your neighbors, introduced VSH queens, or something similar or better researchers find in the future, it could improve your stock, which as you said, everybody wants. I never intended to say that you were wrong, and if I came across that way I'm sorry. I just wanted to get across that while your success is great, it doesn't mean this research isn't important for the future."
Beekeeping,3dbwyp,laharre,3,Thu Jul 16 12:09:46 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping to requeen at least one of my hives with a VSH queen this fall. Disease/parasite resistance selective breeding is some of the most important work being done on honeybee survival, even though it doesn't get as much attention as other issues."
Beekeeping,3dbak5,reknaps,3,Tue Jul 14 23:01:36 2015 UTC,"Bees will only draw out comb when they need it and can spare the resources. If you're in a dearth they probably won't have the honey stores to warrant drawing more comb. I ofteb have bees chew my foundation a lot if they aren't drawing it quickly.  You probably dont, but If you just happen to have drawn comb, it  wouldn't hurt to put a couple checkerboarded in to get them to move up and draw some. Consider taking off the excluder as well. If you get brood in your super ( with two deeps I haven't had that happen yet) just shake the bees out frame by frame into the deep boxes gently and put it back on until the brood hatches out. Removing it will encourage the bees to move up. Otherwise, just give them time and wait for a bloom to start in your area."
Beekeeping,3dbak5,DirtyGhettoOmelette,2,Tue Jul 14 23:15:01 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. I'll try removing the excluder sometime this week.
Beekeeping,3dbak5,vossejongk,3,Wed Jul 15 02:03:25 2015 UTC,"Remove the queen excluder untill they start to draw comb, that fixes this problem 99% of the time.  They see the excluder as a barrier and will rather swarm then start building those frames. Remind that the natural way for bees to build is downwards.  You can kickstart the process by putting the honey super between the 2 deeps for a day, they'll race to fill out the empty space between the split brood nest you just created. If for some reason you're too late and the queen already laid eggs in the super just take out the frames, put them in the fridge for half an hour and then put the super on top. This kills the eggs/larvae, the bees will remove them and you get nice virgin white honey comb :)"
Beekeeping,3dbak5,laharre,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:18:58 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'll try taking off the excluder soon to see if they pick up the pace.  I'll try the sandwiching the super between the deeps as plan B if removing the excluder doesn't help much.
Beekeeping,3dbak5,jayhawk73,2,Wed Jul 15 02:02:59 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same situation with one of mine. I had been feeding until I put the super on, and I think we hit a slight dearth soon after. They're building on it, but very very slowly. In my area, they don't need any supers to overwinter, so I'm not too worried. I might have to feed my second hive some in the fall though, they requeened themselves and have been struggling to catch up."
Beekeeping,3dbak5,laharre,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:41:42 2015 UTC,"I'm in the exact same situation.  I'm going to do a full inspection tomorrow, but a quick look at the super showed they weren't pulling foundation much at all.  Hopefully that changes soon..."

Beekeeping,3da6g3,amethystrockstar,2,Wed Jul 15 00:20:53 2015 UTC,Sweet!  I would offer tips but Texas is completely different than California.  In California we all complain about the drought and Varroa.  The Texans I know complain about flooding and hive beetles.  Neither of those are a problem in California.  I do know a few commercial beekeepers who send their hives to California for winter though!
Beekeeping,3da6g3,Rogue369,2,Wed Jul 15 00:39:32 2015 UTC,Well in my region it's actually a bit similar.  We are typically drought status more than half the year. This year's flooding was very strange and unusual but we do get a nice short rainy season. shb can be a big problem especially during wet times but otherwise drought and varroa are the big offenders here too. That and africanized bees.  Our winters aren't too bad. Mine overwinter with a deep and a medium just fine.

Was this mounted to a tree in the woods, on a pole over a lake, etc? Usually birdhouses are placed around people and generally people wouldn't appreciate bees moving into their house for blue jays.  Why were they allowed to live there for 15 years and what changed, why were they no longer welcome?"
Beekeeping,3d64ql,xnonamefacex,2,Tue Jul 14 13:25:17 2015 UTC,"I didn't get many other shots worth showing. Mostly just bees on comb. Got honey on the lense early on box was about the size of a medium hive... maybe a bit larger. Ended up filling most of 2 mediums with it probably 5 or 6 good large sheets of comb then some jacked up corner shaped comb house was mounted to a branch but the branch above it had grown since it had been placed effectively wedging the box in place. The tree was in the front yard, and old live oak that gets shade and shelter all year the owners have never had issues with the bees and actually enjoyed their presence. This year though 2 people got stung and apparently dad is allergic so they had to go the weirdest thing about it all was the 4 or 5 sheets of comb hanging in the same tree on a branch just 10 feet away. I guess they swarmed this year and failed to keep the branch hive dry enough during our rainy season as the comb was fucked up and abandoned."

Beekeeping,3d4gvc,Notmydirtyalt,3,Mon Jul 13 13:19:02 2015 UTC,"You could try misting them down with sugar water the next time you open the hive it'll help calm the bees by distracting them. They'll be too busy happily lapping up the sugar water to care that you're poking about inside. I swear compared to smoke it's like I found their master off switch.   Starting at one edge try hover sliding the pieces together, which should help to push the bees out of the way."
Beekeeping,3d4gvc,redindiaink,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:11:53 2015 UTC,"Fantastic Idea, do you use just the sugar water or do you use it with the smoke? And have you tried a feeder to lure them away from the hive or just the spray?"
Beekeeping,3d4gvc,redindiaink,2,Tue Jul 14 07:35:36 2015 UTC,"I still use both because I find there are days where mine can be a bit more defensive than others. I smoke the entrance lightly, give a puff under the lid and smoke myself a bit. I wait a minute or two then pop off the top and mist the tops of the frames with sugar. If I notice the hum of the bees increasing in intensity while I'm working I give them more sugar.   The Bee Regulations in my province disallow feeding away from the hive, and I want to discourage robbing and predation regardless, so I use a frame feeder. I'm going to switch to a top feeder in the winter."
Beekeeping,3d4gvc,SpaceRiot,3,Tue Jul 14 13:19:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure how you keep bees in your part of the world, but here in the northern hemisphere we don't open the hives under 14 ¬∞C. You talk about winter and very cold weather, what kind of routine checks need to be done in this period? Surely there's no nectar flow, no bees flying and nothing to check on. Over here, any disturbance in the winter can be disastrous."
Beekeeping,3d4gvc,danimalod,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:18:35 2015 UTC,"Both hives due to circumstance were moved in high summer with only a pair of boxes, the move occurred during heat which cost the hive quite a lot and left them stressed, we've been routinely checking by cracking the top to see if they need supplementary feeding to over winter the hives. Each hive received a third box in late march with extra frames through April to facilitate any collected food in Autumn. However one hive which is more docile has retreated into the brood box which left me in fear of colony collapse/weakened queen due to not being able to get enough new workers out in time for winter. The second more aggressive hive had us worried that there was a second queen or dying queen or dead queen that was causing the overly aggressive behaviour and that unless I robbed the other hive of brood the second hive would not over winter in time to swarm with a princess. So I had to get in and confirm that both hives had food, living queen and brood cells active due to the inappropriate moves they underwent.  Temperature wise I went in on a 14C day and temps around my part have hovered just above double digits since. Bees have been sighted coming in and out during this time, I don't know if this was sighting behaviour of new territory in preparation for spring or an indication they were low on stored food and required supplementary feeding."
Beekeeping,3d1w59,secret_tiger101,12,Sun Jul 12 21:17:29 2015 UTC,"You are correct about the hive rearing a new queen.  However:  Allowing swarming has several disadvantages:  1) You lose half of your honey makers.  2) If they nest somewhere undesirable (inside a wall cavity, in a chimney, etc., they are likely to be exterminated.  3) Swarming might scare the bejeezus out of your neighbors.  They may start legal issues over your hives, eventhough a swarm is harmless."
Beekeeping,3d1w59,kckaaos,5,Sun Jul 12 21:31:42 2015 UTC,"Another issue is survivability. At least in north America, honeybees aren't endemic, and with the added stressors bees deal with today (varroa, nosema, SHB, etc), they don't do so well ""wild"". The swarm your hive puts off isn't likely to make it unless a beekeeper gets a hold of it, and not only does the lower population in your own hive lower honey yields, it also leaves your bee population weaker and more susceptible to robbing, pests, and bad winters."
Beekeeping,3d1w59,laharre,3,Sun Jul 12 21:56:41 2015 UTC,"Letting them swarm breaks the brood cycle which can be a good thing if you want to use it as a way to control varroa, but with a large portion of the foraging population gone leaving a younger population of nurse bees and not many foragers you weaken the hive in other ways. The bees that are set to swarm feast on honey in preparation to vacate which can create scarcity for the more established hive which won't have the same number of foragers that can go get more pollen/nectar after the rest have gone. The swarm that left has no resources until they can establish themselves in a new spot so their focus will be on making a new digs which requires aheckuvalot of resources. They're also incredibly vulnerable to predation/weather until they're well established. If they swarm at the wrong time they won't survive.   I'm new to this, so I know I missed a lot of other finer points on why its a bad thing. Its a lot simpler (and less stress inducing!) to make a split. Two hives out of one, a new queen and you get to pick when it happens (for the most part). Not as much fun as standing in a cloud of swarming bees though."
Beekeeping,3d1w59,redindiaink,4,Mon Jul 13 03:04:21 2015 UTC,"A new queen is a variable in what is (hopefully) already a successful hive. She might not lay well, or the hive might become more aggressive with her at the helm. After her mating flight, she might not make it back to the hive at all!   If you have bees that you aren't happy with, feel free to let them swarm and start with a new queen. If you are happy with them, why take the risk?"

Swarming is a natural process and interrupts the reproduction cycle of vorroa mite.  It's too bad we can't let them swarm and always catch them.  Hell, I catch swarms only to find their beehive empty later.  I've taken to locking them in with a queen excluder."

Bumblebees are constantly in people's properties though.  If we feel people can't really afford it we work something out with them in terms of giving a donation (usually ¬£5) towards petrol or something. I did a job the other day for an old lady who was blind, who's carers only left her with notes so she couldn't quite work out how much she had.

This allows the bees to break the brood cycle while preventing panic to your neighbors.  It also allows you to keep all of your honey makers AND it helps them fulfill their natural propensity to swarm in the Spring.  You can artificially swarm them, too.  IMHO, artificial swarming and splitting a hive is considerably different."

Beekeeping,3d2byr,aTomzVins,2,Mon Jul 13 20:34:29 2015 UTC,No wax coating. If they want to build comb they will build comb. It seems like they always start at the very bottom edge of the popsicle stick. So maybe putting the lowest edge of the top bar in the middle is enough to encourage straighter combs. Of course nothing is 100% with bees.  Currently the Popsicle stick I use is thinner than in that photo so there is not as much distance between where they start the comb and the full bottom edge of the top bar. I also use two sticks so it covers most of the width of the bar.

Beekeeping,3d2byr,aTomzVins,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:40:10 2015 UTC,So the bees will start on the bottom of your frame without any guides? Are there any tricks to it?
Beekeeping,3d2byr,rhackleford,2,Mon Jul 13 20:35:24 2015 UTC,"ya keep the plastic foundations you get when you buy a nuc and then use them to flank an empty frame (similar to checkerboarding), the bees fill in the empty spaces. (once you get those filled out you sandwich empty frames with straight complete combs / rinse / repeat) -i find wax/wood starter strips are just a waste of time, ive had no better results with or without so i go without and save myself the time.  -they build comb faster when you feed them -make sure your spacing is exact when you first start and you wont have any problems (handle with care until they are completed to the bottom of the frame though) -with my next set of frames i want a line of fishing line across the frame 1/3 of the way up from the bottom just to secure the bottom of the comb before its drawn all the way to the bottom of the frame. long story short you do not need wax guides."
Beekeeping,3d2byr,aTomzVins,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:50:10 2015 UTC,"I like to sandwich between drawn combs too. The challenges I've encountered is that it works best with brood comb, but it's not always ideal seperate brood combs too much. If I put a foundationless frame beside a honey comb that is too far along they often just extend the honey comb rather than draw a new comb."

If you know how to avoid brood, and just slice empty cells or honey cells, you can snag a very small amount of wax, and melt it to apply.

Beekeeping,3d18z5,Schrodenger,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:29:10 2015 UTC,My hive is doing spectacularly since my last inspection.  My top brood box is around 85% drawn with lots of capped brood.  I found these two possible queen cells on an outer frame that hasn't been drawn out very much.    It has been almost 3 weeks since my last inspection due to rain/weather/work.  I added a medium super and filled the top feeder.  Is there anything else I should consider doing?
Beekeeping,3d18z5,OysterToadfish,2,Sun Jul 12 18:13:42 2015 UTC,"Those are queen cups, they become queen cells when they draw them out completely *if I understand the terms correctly which is doubtful. The big thing is to make sure there isn't a larva inside it flooded with royal jelly, which is a white color and quite distinctive. Bees like to have a certain number of queen cells to be ready just in case but they aren't a danger till they build them out the rest of the way and fill them getting ready for a new queen.   Many beekeepers like to cut those out whenever they see then, and since I don't have personal experience to say otherwise I do the same as long as I know there is working queen in the hive.   As long as you found fresh eggs in the hive, and/or the queen working along you shouldn't have much to worry about, but definitely keep an eye on the hive and check within a week or they could swarm.   If you're in an area that isn't going through a nectar dearth, and they have plenty of honey stored you can probably stop feeding them now. Chances are they won't take the syrup when there is other more natural sources around anyway."
Beekeeping,3d18z5,OysterToadfish,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:30:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  There were no eggs/larvae in the queen cells.  Also, I have no way to know if there is a nectar dearth.  I see plenty of natural sources of pollen/nectar around my area and this NASA website (http://honeybeenet.gsfc.nasa.gov/Honeybees/ForageRegion.php?StReg=MD_12) shows plenty of significant sources of pollen/nectar in my state.  My bees started feeding from my hummingbird feeder and there was not a significant amount of honey/nectar in the brood boxes so I filled the top feeder."

Beekeeping,3d149p,svarogteuse,2,Sun Jul 12 20:10:28 2015 UTC,"They could, but I do not think so for a few reasons:   They are covered in plastic now Humidity is in the 60% range  Storage location is about 85 degrees"
Beekeeping,3d149p,vossejongk,2,Sun Jul 12 20:38:12 2015 UTC,I'd be more concerned that if there are any SHB eggs already in the frames they will hatch out in 2-3 days and ruin the honey. Covering them in plastic will only keep new pests out. If you can freeze them until the day before you are ready to extract.

Beekeeping,3d149g,-thedartedash-,2,Sun Jul 12 17:29:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, the cells in the upper corner of your brood frames are infact capped honey. Most hives look just like this - they use the honey in the brood frames for feeding the newly hatched bees, if I recall correctly."
Beekeeping,3d149g,GFrohman,2,Sun Jul 12 17:35:39 2015 UTC,"Looks like small hive beetle, though I'm not sure because I've never seen on in real life. Get some ""Beetle Blasters"", fill them with vegetable oil, and the beetles will die in there. (I think, again, I've never dealt with them before"
Beekeeping,3d149g,trevdak2,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:01:56 2015 UTC,"You are correct here, and fill the beetle blasters up 25% with veggie oil, any more, and you risk spilling the oil. Vegetable oil, or any oil will kill bees on contact. But more oil will not kill any more beetles than the 25% will."
Beekeeping,3d149g,Ciene,2,Sun Jul 12 19:34:06 2015 UTC,"Certainly those beetles are small hive beatles. Squish them at every chance. As long as your bees are maintaining a strong colony you'll be fine.  That is to say the population stays high, they don't have an excessive amount of space in the hive so they can't cover it all, they don't go queenless or abscond or swarm or any of the issues that make hives weak."
Beekeeping,3d149g,Schrodenger,2,Sun Jul 12 18:24:22 2015 UTC,First that is a nice brood pattern.    Look up freeman beetle trap.  That is what I use on my hives as small hive beetles are endemic in SE Virginia.  If they get bad you can put in a freeman beetle trap and dust the bees with powered sugar.  See   http://freemanbeetletrap.com/  For some more details.    PS  I have no relation to the company I just use their product.
Beekeeping,3d149g,TomVa,2,Sun Jul 12 18:29:27 2015 UTC,"Hive beetles should be killed on sight, use beetle blaster hive traps in the hive body, two for each brood super. Fill the bottom 25% with veggie oil, the cheapest you can get. As soon as you take the lid off the hive, look at it, as they like to hide up there. If you see them in the hive, smash them, unless the queen is next to them. All it takes is one beetle to kill off a hive, and a few bees aren't worth the risk.   Thats capped honey, the cappings get darker as dirty bee feet march all over it. The brood pattern looks perfect."
Beekeeping,3d149g,Ciene,2,Sun Jul 12 19:32:47 2015 UTC,"Don't panic on the hive beetles.  They can become an issue if you don't control them.  The bees will handle them up to a point as long as your hive is strong.  Like others have said, get some beetle traps and the bees will chase the beetles into them for you.    Beetles can devastate a hive if they go unchecked, but it is not uncommon to see one or two in a hive.  Think of the hive as an onion.  The outside is honey then inside that is pollen, then inside that is brood.  Rarely will you see a frame with just brood in it.  It will likely have a ring of honey around it.  with pollen inside that."

If it's a SHB then I expect /u/Texas_Beekeeper to show up to tell you to kill it, and all others without prejudice.  They can kill your hive and if that's what it is then you should do something now.  Unfortunately, I don't have the experience to offer advice now but there are a lot members here that can help."

They will kill a weak hive, but if your hive is healthy you have nothing to worry about.  That is coming from California though.  Other states complain more loudly about the critters.  Second picture is honey."
Beekeeping,3d149g,cab0addict,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:10:21 2015 UTC,"On pic 2, It is very normal for brood frames to have capped honey and pollen on the upper 1/4 of the frame and sides.  This allows the nursery bees to feed the larvae without having to travel to the outer brood frames or the honey boxes for food.    I'd be more worried if a brood frame didn't contain pollen/honey."
Beekeeping,3d149g,s33761,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:43:14 2015 UTC,"Those are small hive beetles and  you have a problem. Smash them when you see them (look for them), get some traps, put DE on the ground around the hive, caulk all the cracks in the hive ( the corners, the bottom board, the inner cover, and the top ) so they don't have a place to hide. There are other things to do also, one of them is to get a book about bees and read it so you will know that bees store honey & pollen in the corners of brood frames. I'll post you a list later, gotta go now. Good luck. Go smash some beetles."

Beekeeping,3cxu4o,sdega315,5,Sun Jul 12 01:23:39 2015 UTC,That's a great photo! I have a hive that's been going strong for 4 years. I've never requeened it... even when I know it has swarmed. My beekeeping philosophy is to let the bees take care of there own business. I have four hives and the one I leave alone is my strongest!
Beekeeping,3cyw65,raymiedubbs,6,Sun Jul 12 01:07:59 2015 UTC,First the bearding (bees on the outside of the hive)  That is normal.  Where I live 3 out of my 5 have have way more bees on the front porch than that every night.  The ones with less recently swarmed.   They would swarm because they are bees and that is the way that they propagate.     The only thing that I can think of that you might have done is to move an empty frame or two in the middle of the brood ball before they decided that they were going to create some new queens and swarm.  This way the bees would not feel like they were honey bound or out of space for expansion.    You have queen cells then they have a succession queen.  Now is the time to check for verroa mites.  If you have them then you may want to consider watching the hive and wiping out any drone comb when the worker brood emerges; then do a sugar dusting of your hive.    In three or four weeks you need to check for brood.  A week for the queens to emerge.  A week before they (one of them) mate and a week or two before you can spot any brood or eggs.    If you do not have any brood by then you have a problem and need to go on line and figure out where you can buy a queen or alternately steal a frame of capped brood and a frame with fresh eggs to get the hive to produce another queen.    BTW don't be surprised if your hive has no brood at some point in time in the next few weeks it could be that you are just in between queens.  That is always the unnerving time for me.  Do they have a queen and it is just timing or are you queenless and need to address it.
Beekeeping,3cyw65,TomVa,3,Sun Jul 12 02:46:26 2015 UTC,Great.  I inspected for verroa on Monday before the swarm and saw no signs.  I had a good amount of larva and capped brood as well.  They have drawn out a pretty large amount of drone comb though.  Maybe 20-25% of the brood nest is drone.  Should I cut it out and see if they draw out worker comb or just leave it be?
Beekeeping,3cyw65,TomVa,2,Sun Jul 12 02:56:27 2015 UTC,Since you don't have a mite problem I would not do anything for the next three weeks.  Just button up the hive and hope for the best.  In three weeks maybe four weeks is when you need to be concerned.  Check for brood.    No brood in 4 weeks and you needed a new queen and if you can find it a frame or two of capped brood to help your worker population.  Something to watch for in about 2 weeks is when the new queen goes out for a mating flight.  Most all of the bees will pour out of the hive and hang out all over the front of the hive for about 15 minutes when the queen leaves for her mating flight.  I have seen it twice . . . it is almost as impressive (and way less depressing) as seeing a swarm but you have to happen to be near you hives when it happens.  Depending on where you live there are laws/rules about requeening due to Africanized bees.  I saw a post about this from someone in Fla. a while back.
Beekeeping,3cyw65,JoeHut,3,Sun Jul 12 03:05:45 2015 UTC,I'm in NY so there are no killers up here haha.  There are a couple local breeders around that I can get one from if need be.  Do you suggest letting all the queen cells hatch and let them fight it out or should I pull all but one cell?
Beekeeping,3cyw65,SpaceRiot,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:21:19 2015 UTC,"Here in germany TBHs aren't very common and I use Zander myself, so out of curiosity: How do you check for varroa in a TBH?"
Beekeeping,3cyw65,rhackleford,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:56:39 2015 UTC,"It takes 9 days for a queen cup to get capped. Obviously last sunday and the day after there must've been either eggs or larvae in them. You say you weren't worried because the cups weren't capped, but when that happens you are far too late (the old queen will have left by the time you notice capped cells). If you see a cup in the future please check for egg/larvae instead of the cap, this gives you time to act.  The hive can and will work out the queen situation. Seven days after the previous swarm your first new queen will hatch, she will try and seek out the other queens. It's entirely possible she's unable to find all of them, in which case she'll leave the hive with another swarm the next day. And if you're completely unlucky, the ""unfound"" queens can do the same thing and swarm as well until they're all born, killed or cleaned up.   The question is, do you want to risk this or will you manage your new queens?"
Beekeeping,3cyw65,rhackleford,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:39:16 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info.  I think since I'm new I will just let the bees work out the queen situation.  They know better than me.
