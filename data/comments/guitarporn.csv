guitarporn,3e2v5i,Fafhands,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:14:55 2015 UTC,Cool! What's the tremolo system on the Red Special like? Is it some construction underneath the black half circle? Of is it more like strat?
guitarporn,3e2v5i,keepitdark,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:40:17 2015 UTC,"There's a few bits hidden under there, yeah. It's a floating term system too. To be honest I rarely use the trem at all. I've had the SG about 6 years longer so when ever I needed that kind of effect I'd either use bends or bend the neck a bit or both of those things. Need to learn some new techniques to make the most of it."

guitarporn,3dxzcr,pheesh_man,2,Mon Jul 20 20:10:28 2015 UTC,Are there two different woods on the fingerboard or is that just the tape marking it off? Or is that the route for the truss rod and the finger board hasn't been attached?
guitarporn,3dxzcr,pheesh_man,3,Mon Jul 20 18:50:57 2015 UTC,No idea but I'm thinking rosewood with a maple stripe.  Rumor is that this is for the Bob Weir shows and this is definitely a Garcia type guitar
guitarporn,3dxzcr,chowpa,3,Mon Jul 20 19:28:12 2015 UTC,There are frets on that guitar so it's not the route for the truss rod. I would like the maple stripe idea. I'm surprised more guitars don't use different kinds of wood on the fingerboard. It looks pretty cool
guitarporn,3dxzcr,AntiFIanders,0,Mon Jul 20 19:35:17 2015 UTC,"Well, there are a lot of guitars and basses that have stripes going on the very outside. Having two different woods of equal sizes wouldnt work well for sustain, especially on bends."
guitarporn,3dxzcr,pain-and-panic,2,Mon Jul 20 20:26:54 2015 UTC,"It looks like it's just tape.  Consistent with the width of the masking tape to cover the gap between the two side pieces.    A fretboard, especially one without finish, would be questionable with two pieces of wood.  The expansion and contraction due to moisture and temperature changes would make for an uneven surface.  Cool idea visually but the functionality would suffer."

guitarporn,3dhsl7,Kat_V,4,Thu Jul 16 15:32:43 2015 UTC,That is a foam ear plug to stop the trem spring from coming out and getting lost ..
guitarporn,3dhsl7,Maxthelion83,3,Thu Jul 16 15:33:58 2015 UTC,Forgive my ignorance but could you please elaborate on this? How could a tremolo spring get lost if there's no arm screwed in?
guitarporn,3dhsl7,bill37663,3,Thu Jul 16 21:30:58 2015 UTC,"We aren't talking about the trem springs in the back of the guitar here, instead the small ( about a cm long usually black ) spring that sits directly under the trem arm and gives it tension and resistance so it doesn't flap around on the guitar. The plug provides two uses, one, because of its obvious colour, reminds you as soon as you open the case to install the arm, but if you ( or your guitar tech or whoever else ) picks up the guitar the spring won't fall out on a dark stage and be lost ( which isn't fatal but its a pain, and yes I do carry 3 spares in my case but its still a pain ). Just a little mod I use based on previous experience."
guitarporn,3dhsl7,bill37663,3,Fri Jul 17 01:12:26 2015 UTC,Standard or 62 reissue?
guitarporn,3dfl5b,irritatedrhino,2,Wed Jul 15 21:52:10 2015 UTC,"Protip, winding pickups is hard to do by hand, second to building a nice neck. I personally wouldn't recommend that you build your first guitar with hand tools and include a floating tremolo, since the routing out for the tremolo has to be very precise to actually look good. I think that it will be kinda hard for you to get it straight. If it's a bit off, you'll notice it straight away, I'd recommend this type of ordeal if you want it to look good having not much experience. If you want a nice, playable guitar to be proud of, buy a neck and the pickups and work just on the body this time around. See it as a process, that you'll get better at. I usually tell my friends that anyone can build a solid body for a guitar or wind the pick ups, that's just time consuming, the neck requires alot of special tools, like how are you going to be able to handdrill for the tussrod? Are you going to carve the wood out underneath the fretboard instead, do you have the skill and tools to carve that cavity, since it needs to be kind of perfect fit for a tussrod for the tussrod to not bounce around inside. See it as a process that you develop, you'll learn alot of things just building a body of you own, and don't get yourself into something big that you might not be able to finnish, since that is counteractive of your theraputic goals.  If however you see this as a process and you'll be happy with whatever kind of guitar, then shoot and go crazy!  Also, use a piece of cloth (towels work for me) underneath your guitars, you don't want it dinged up while working against a flat hard surface. If there's something on that hard surface, it'll put a dent in your body straight away."

guitarporn,3dbprj,wrongwayjay,2,Wed Jul 15 07:29:17 2015 UTC,"This guitar doesn't make you sound better. Yeah, original 1950s/1960s Les Pauls are great guitars from what people say, but they have become collector's items. There's nothing magical about them. What makes them special is that they were made before guitars were made by CNC machines, so their exact (neck) shape may vary from guitar to guitar. Also, the pickups are hand wound, so number of windings (=output) varies aswell.  I most likely wouldn't buy one. If I wanted a vintage sounding Gibson, I would rather buy a recent model or a used one and put in low output pickups."

guitarporn,3dbprj,littleredguitars,2,Wed Jul 15 15:03:03 2015 UTC,Jimi Hendrix's guitars cost less than that.
guitarporn,3dbprj,reverbdotcom,5,Mon Jul 20 19:18:31 2015 UTC,Definitely overpriced.  I could MAYBE see an lp standard from the first year of production being this price in mint  condition but it's only a 1960
guitarporn,3dbprj,mrjaguar1,8,Wed Jul 15 01:56:45 2015 UTC,"I agree this is overpriced, but actually Les Pauls from 1958 to 1960 go for considerably more than first year models, which would be 1952. In 1952, the original LP had a very unstable trapeze tailpiece, less desirable P90 pickups (the humbuckers were introduced in 1957), and a very shallow neck angle which made intonation problematic.   By the way, in reference to the title of this post, the reason for this is likely because this shop is in the UK, so they will likely be shipping internationally. The shipping price is most likely the default on their account, not something the specifically choose for this listing.   I feel like I should also mention that they probably know full well they aren't getting that price for it. Super high end sales like this require a lot of negotiation, so they just needed to put something to get the guitar listed. Most likely, if this one sells it'll be in the $180,000 to $220,000 range. An outrageous amount of money, sure, but 1958 - 1960 Les Pauls (aka ""Bursts"") are pretty much the most prized vintage guitars on the market."
guitarporn,3dbprj,1ns,2,Wed Jul 15 02:16:00 2015 UTC,Since its from the UK does Jimmy Page personally deliver it if you buy it ? For that price it only seems fair .

The 3 guitars will really go well together. Plus the finish on the LP is epic.   This G&L (when I do get it) will become a metal guitar so I'll upgrade the humbuckers.  Picture of LP coming..  :)

guitarporn,3d1eyz,blackrussianroulette,3,Sun Jul 12 20:37:54 2015 UTC,Just a replacement knob from Amazon. The control is actually a blend knob. Tone and volume are all the way up and the knob works like a pickup selector but makes a smooth transition instead of one or the other

guitarporn,3d22hc,Zanna15,4,Sun Jul 12 22:09:17 2015 UTC,What is the advantage of fanned frets...? Better intonation or something?
guitarporn,3d22hc,tawndy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:04:14 2015 UTC,"Much better intonation. The scale length is different for each string (from nut to bridge) to put all of the strings under the same tension. Because of this, have to adjust each fret to keep the notes the same as a normal guitar. I have played one at a local shop and the sound was absolutely stunning."
guitarporn,3d22hc,Camero0n,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:21:47 2015 UTC,Not so much tension and intonation as it is that the higher strings ring better with a shorter scale length and the ssme with a longer scale length for bass strings. It is more noticeable on a normal guitar. The bass strings sound more full and the pin strings sound more bright. Also the fanned frets is more ergonomic.
guitarporn,3d22hc,SignatureStorm,2,Mon Jul 13 10:19:18 2015 UTC,So much nope going on here. Intonation is not improved with fanned frets. Balanced string tension and ergonomics are the big benefits.
guitarporn,3d22hc,SevenStringJones,3,Mon Jul 13 18:26:20 2015 UTC,I also said it wasn't for intonation.

guitarporn,3cxfoa,LucasJLeCompte,3,Sat Jul 11 21:16:12 2015 UTC,"I love these things.  TBH the only thing that ever kept me away from a JP model is the fact that it's a ""signature"" model.  For some reason I just never liked having a signature model anything.    I'm a bit hypocritical though, since I have a Peavey JSX (Satriani) half stack - but that's because when they discontinued it I got it new for $1500, when the heads alone were selling for $1800 usually, and the cabs for $900.  That, and they're arguably the most versatile prog metal amps ever built."
guitarporn,3cxfoa,stabsthedrama,5,Sat Jul 11 22:05:08 2015 UTC,Fun fact Les Pauls are considered signature models of the guitarist Les Paul.
guitarporn,3cxfoa,arnoldlayne98,2,Sun Jul 12 04:29:41 2015 UTC,"I have always hated them regardless of that fact.  They're gigantic coffee tables with little upper fret access.  No thanks.  I also don't like how far up and towards the neck the bridge is on them - I'm more used to Ibbys/fenders/jacksons/etc where they're a lot further back and down.  The only one I've ever played that I liked, which I really really liked - was a AAA top double cut.  Thing was beast."
guitarporn,3cxfoa,stabsthedrama,2,Sun Jul 12 04:33:38 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. I just don't like Gibsons in general, they're an overrated manufacturer in my opinion."
guitarporn,3cxfoa,arnoldlayne98,2,Sun Jul 12 05:08:34 2015 UTC,"I understand what you mean with signature models. With my experience with JPs, I feel like they are the same guitars that JP himself plays. Other signatures just seem like they are copies of what they are based on."
guitarporn,3cxfoa,manofthemosh,2,Sun Jul 12 01:54:40 2015 UTC,"I'm the same way but so many other musicians use them, and they are one of the most versatile models I've ever played/owned. At least they're not plastered in signatures or immediately recognizable to the average person as a signature model. I love my jp7"

guitarporn,3cvfyp,Rellek_,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:41:50 2015 UTC,Very nice guitar.  I've been thinking about getting another Schecter since I got my Corsair a while back.  How is the build quality?
guitarporn,3cvfyp,VIPERsssss,2,Sat Jul 11 03:14:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't have a ton of experience with all the different brands and types of guitars available, so I can't really compare it to anything. I have had a love affair with Schecter since the mid-2000s. I have always read great things and would stare at their website. A broke college kid could dream right?   I can say this. I'm really picky, and almost always find something wrong with whatever it is I am doing, and 48 hours with this guy so far and I've only found one small issue. I bump the volume knob from time to time. To me, not a big deal.   The hardware is silky smooth. The guitar isn't the lightest I've held, but I prefer that. I LOVE the mother of pearl bindings and inlays, and the ebony fretboard stays nice and slick, oily I guess is how most would describe it. My first time having tuner locks, a welcome addition for sure. Stringing up is a breeze, usually requiring less than half a turn to get up to standard. I have a Jackson Dinky with a Floyd Rose trem and while I get why people like them, I personally can't stand it. Maybe I'm just too impatient, but I like being able to change strings or tunings without having to deal with the balance those required. That's probably ignorant lol I dunno just a personal thing I guess.   Lastly, I loves me some EMGs. The 81/89 combo screams.  There are a ton of different single coil, humbucker push/pull knob variations that can be achieved (or so I have read and been told) that I haven't even began to experiment with yet.  Anything in particular I can answer that I didn't bring up? I'm sure I missed a bunch lol"

guitarporn,3crvx0,ifvcu44,5,Fri Jul 10 10:50:12 2015 UTC,You could do that or go for something like a Seymour Duncan Hot Rails which is a hot/heavy humbucker that is a single coil size.  There is no going back once you route out the cavity on such a nice body.
guitarporn,3crvx0,HEADBANG_2_BEETHOVEN,2,Fri Jul 10 11:21:04 2015 UTC,If you put on a pick guard one could go back but not tonewise because of the loss of material  But yeah I'd explore options
guitarporn,3crvx0,cinaed666,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:44:14 2015 UTC,I have and because the pickups will be custom hand made ones I decided to forget going a HSH route like every other person and his pet does and do something different. im going to go with a single coil which has grunt to sound like a humbucker so it has the heavyness of the humbucker but also can do single coil clarity for blues and softer music.

The tele it belonged to got a custom neck a few years ago), typed in telemaster and this thing popped up fully loaded with the electronics included. I threw a bid up, won it, and couldn't be happier because I saved a fair chunk of change (like $300 - $500 chunk of change), and the stock electronics don't sound half bad. GFS pickups.   Still plan on making tweaks to it but for now, it's good to go!"

New pups, pots, tuners, etc still waaaay cheaper than a gibson.  Are you trying to buy a new Gibby?  With all the questions of quality and the price increases, I'd def look at a used LP first."
guitarporn,3cjjlp,lippyjose,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:28:24 2015 UTC,"Same price I paid :) Yeah, I find I play it a lot more than the strat (or any of my other guitars for that matter). The strat is an American Standard so feels a bit counter intuitive that I play the cheapie more :)    Def would only by used, new wasn't on the cards. Budget dictates that even though I agree with you re: recent not matching older quality.  Have you modded your epi?  If so what have you done, and would you do the same again?"
guitarporn,3cjjlp,lippyjose,2,Wed Jul 8 20:09:26 2015 UTC,"Nice!  Yeah I also have the same set up (almost) as you.  I've got the black Epi and an American special strat (HSS).  Great guitars, lots of fun to play.   I did do some work on mine.  It sounded good and verything, but I had done extra cash at the time and a free Saturday afternoon, so I figured I'd go try done stuff.  I put in SD Whole Lotta Humbuckers, kluson style tuners (just liked the way they look), and some little stuff like the input jack, etc.  I really like it and would do it again.    I was really on the ""I want a gibby LP"" thing too, but after making some mods, I'm pretty happy with the Epi, especially at about $250ish of upgrades vs $1500 for the Gibby LP.  It's not and never will be a ""gibson"", but it sounds great for me and I saved a lot of money going that route."

Loads of fun to play and has that hot dearmond sound that makes for a killer blues tone.  I was looking at another one in town for $600 but it just seemed like too much.

guitarporn,3bilmi,bumpyfelon,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:34:43 2015 UTC,personally i love my t-5 the neck and action are set just right on mine so i can play it for hours. I love the tones i can pull from having it plugged in and usually run it through my marshall silver jubilee or straight through a pa with no effects. You can get some wonderful dirty blues sounds as well as soaring cleans. I have nothing but positive things to say about it other than the price haha but it was well worth it in my opinion!
guitarporn,3bilmi,Ferrocile,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:41:01 2015 UTC,That's awesome that it gets good dirty sounds considering what it is. Does it have legit pickups?
guitarporn,3bilmi,Ferrocile,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:31:53 2015 UTC,"they're decent, i thought about swapping the one visible bridge that fits in the single coil but when I took a good look at it looked impossible to change out with out actually cutting into the guitar so I said fuck it ill leave it and use pedals or amps to get a different sound."

guitarporn,3bjpm2,Ferrocile,2,Mon Jun 29 20:31:28 2015 UTC,Thanks! It's sweet. They are essentially the same as an l-00 but the neck meets the body at the twelfth fret whereas most l-00s meet at the 14th. The only non reversible part of the conversion is the compensated saddle. It was originally straight across.

guitarporn,3b8efo,Decon87,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:34:18 2015 UTC,I'm used to Gibson and PRS. Never heard of either of these brands. Are they more luxury than what I'd find in a shop?
guitarporn,3b8efo,True_Mammoth,3,Sat Jun 27 00:08:57 2015 UTC,"RAN is a custom shop brand.  Mayones kind of is, kind of isn't. They're not quite a custom shop, but for all intents and purposes we'll call it custom shop quality. They offer a few limited options for their guitars and they make extremely high quality instruments within those parameters. Same goes for Strandberg (the two up front).  Though if you have enough money or skill to be endorsed by either,  I'm sure they'll make you whatever you want.  Are they more luxury than what you'd find in a shop? I guess that depends on what you need and want out of your instrument. As far as quality goes, once you're in the $2000+ range it's probably preference more than anything, but each of these instruments probably goes for around $3500+ new. That and the wait list for them is probably ~10 months."
guitarporn,3b8efo,Decon87,3,Sat Jun 27 01:11:06 2015 UTC,All of them.
guitarporn,3b8efo,Guitarknowitall,3,Fri Jun 26 21:51:43 2015 UTC,I'd have to go for that Mayones. I really want a Duvell. Though I think I'd get it with the Poplar burl top and the Trans Graphite finish.
guitarporn,3b8efo,SkaJamas,2,Sat Jun 27 01:15:14 2015 UTC,"It's got a poplar top, but with the red finish. That wenge / bubinga neck is definitely the highlight though."
guitarporn,3b8efo,SkaJamas,3,Sat Jun 27 04:20:43 2015 UTC,...do I have to?
guitarporn,3b8efo,SkaJamas,2,Sat Jun 27 15:36:21 2015 UTC,How are the first two strung? Is the knob/ball thing on the head side and the tuners on the bottom?
guitarporn,3b8efo,peachy901,2,Sat Jun 27 06:33:43 2015 UTC,The strings get locked in at the head similar to how a Floyd Rose clamps it's strings. The tuning is done using the bridge. There's a threaded barrel inside that get pulled outward by the end piece creating tension on the strings.
guitarporn,3b8efo,SkaJamas,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:46:12 2015 UTC,if you can take close ups or if you know any place that has diagrams that'd be awesome

guitarporn,3b8efo,cyancynic,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:11:57 2015 UTC,what are your thoughts on headless guitars since I'm going crazy on whether I should buy one or not?
guitarporn,3b8efo,cyancynic,2,Sat Jun 27 05:15:30 2015 UTC,"That depends entirely upon what you want out of your guitar. If you want compact size, easy transport, and super lightweight then go headless. If you aren't concerned with that then you could headed or headless. Aesthetics play a bug role as well. Headless guitars tend to be much smaller, so if you're a bigger person they may look ridiculous on you."

guitarporn,3b557m,sambooka,3,Fri Jun 26 02:30:31 2015 UTC,I really love the tone I'm getting from it. The 57s have such a nice sound. I'm running it through a 77 Twin Reverb and it sounds superb. I got lucky with this though. Paid about $850 because the previous owner drilled a couple small holes all the way through the headstock. Wouldn't even notice them unless I pointed them out.

Trust me the 57's in that guitar are amazing. I was using it for slide and you could really nail that Elmore James sound."
guitarporn,3b557m,Logical_proof,3,Fri Jun 26 12:28:34 2015 UTC,Nah.. even if they were p90s I have a couple of lollars waiting for the day..  I had a 57 in my es165 and swapped it for a lollar late 40s style p90 (non adjustable poles). I still have 1 (2?) lollars in a drawer waiting for the day..    Dont get me wrong.. the 57 IS a good pickup.. like it better than the seth lover but I have an early 70s ttop that just blows everything else out of the water..
guitarporn,3b557m,sambooka,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:57:20 2015 UTC,"After I wrote that I kinda figured you must plan on swapping them. I have a Seth Lover in a G&L Bluesboy and I hated it at first. I was super disappointed with how dark it sounded. Then I plugged it into an AC15 and my impression was completely changed. It took me way to long to bond with that G&L but now I love it. I am seriously going to miss those 57's on that 135 though, they were the best sounding ones I have played."
guitarporn,3b557m,SemiHollowCarrot,2,Fri Jun 26 14:22:01 2015 UTC,funny.. I tried the seth in a 165 and a telecaster (neck for both.. I am more of a jazz player).. and I didnt find it bright so much as lacking mids.. bringing the pickup closer to the strings helped the mids and the high end but but the low end because super woofy..put the the ttop in the tele and the 57 in the 165 and everthing came back to normal BUT I love a good p90 in the neck so I put the lollar in the 165.
guitarporn,3b557m,Spicy_Potatoes,0,Fri Jun 26 15:15:15 2015 UTC,"Careful, some of the P90 versions are actually P100 pickups, which are humbuckers and do not sound like P90s."

guitarporn,3axw3o,Foxxy__Cleopatra,5,Wed Jun 24 11:25:26 2015 UTC,3 Texas specials and one stock Tele neck on a sonic blue mexican strat. It came pre modified like this off of eBay for a great price and I couldn't be happier with the tones. This is the only Fender I'll need to buy.
guitarporn,3axw3o,diddlydiddler,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:29:33 2015 UTC,"does this give it the exact tele sound or more like replica?  I'm thinking if you toggle the tele pickup on and move the bridge into position the bridge pickup would still be active, no?"
guitarporn,3axw3o,diddlydiddler,2,Wed Jun 24 19:41:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, if you turn on the Tele, it will be paired with whatever pickup is selected on the 5-way.  I just post a demo, so you be the judge if it sounds like a genuine Telecaster or not :p"

I wish you had the ability to just have the tele neck, I think that's the one tone missing.  All told, it sounds like a really nice ebay find."
guitarporn,3axw3o,diddlydiddler,3,Wed Jun 24 20:53:09 2015 UTC,"Yah, it needs a taller nut and a new set of notched saddles, I'm thinking about putting in a toggle for the neck just so I can get EVERY combo (Neck+Bridge, Tele only, every pickup).

guitarporn,3ar0me,gibson85,3,Mon Jun 22 20:57:20 2015 UTC,Does it sound any different after sanded down?
guitarporn,3ar0me,AntiFIanders,3,Mon Jun 22 23:28:36 2015 UTC,When I sanded the finish off my late 90s Fender (MIM) Strat the sound blew me away.  Hard to describe but the guitar just came alive.  The amount of grain filler and finish they put on those guitars was disgusting and took an incredible amount of work to remove.  The body was 7 pieces of poplar (seven o.0) with a laminate on top and back.  Eventually I finished it with flat black and skipped the grain filler.  Definitely my favorite Frankenstein guitar.
guitarporn,3ar0me,Erikm82,3,Tue Jun 23 01:34:30 2015 UTC,"Fender is notorious for using what the called fullerplast( look it up!) that completely deadens the wood, but it makes it much cheaper and quicker to manufacture. I took my girlfriends old squire affinity strat and completely removed the poly coating. It took fooreeever. I took a heat gun to it and it made the plastic pop right off the guitar. After a new thin satin coating the guitar never sounded so good."
guitarporn,3ar0me,xXMarethXx,2,Tue Jun 23 07:02:05 2015 UTC,"I'm beginning to feel the same about this guitar,like i said I never played it much before this project,but I can definitely tell that it has more of a unique sound in a very good way. I would have to agree with you,it feels more alive."
guitarporn,3ar0me,littleredguitars,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:10:46 2015 UTC,"I've had some time to sit down a play it and it sounds great to my ears. I read up before I started sanding it that it may change the tone,I honestly never played it much before I sanded it,so I can't really say if it has affected the tone much."
guitarporn,3ar0me,xXMarethXx,3,Tue Jun 23 00:10:25 2015 UTC,"Sir, you have a Jazzmaster there..."
guitarporn,3ar0me,TheRedditor560,3,Tue Jun 23 02:17:43 2015 UTC,"It's a jag technically.  The only real difference between the two besides possible electrical/pickup layouts is that the neck pocket goes deeper on a jag to achieve the shorter scale length (24"" i believe) compared to a jazz which is at 25.5"""
guitarporn,3ar0me,LeeroyGeeBiv,2,Tue Jun 23 02:55:49 2015 UTC,"So it's a jaguar, with a jazzmaster selector switch. What kind of pickups are those?"

guitarporn,3ar0me,Godzuki17,2,Tue Jun 23 02:42:29 2015 UTC,"Oh boy,prepare yourself for some good old manual labor. I used a hand sander for most of it,and then manually sanded the corners and edges by hand with low grit sand paper.  To get around the hardware I had to use a blow drier to heat up the remaining finish and then peal it off with a screwdriver CAREFULLY,zither wise you'll but a nasty knick in your guitar.  But,the most important part is that I am extremely lucky to have a grandfather who works with wood as a hobby,so he did a lot more sanding and eventually stained it and put a clear coat on it for me.  I know getting into it would be a lot of hard work,and it was,but I knew exactly what I wanted and I wasn't going to let a little labor stop me.  So if you have access to the right tools and are just a little bit crazy like myself,you too could have a natural finish guitar haha"
guitarporn,3ar0me,thafisherking,2,Tue Jun 23 03:15:42 2015 UTC,I love working with my hands and I see this as a good challenge to try. Do you know what kind of stain and coat he put on it? This would be something great to do during the summer.
guitarporn,3ar0me,Godzuki17,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:35:14 2015 UTC,"I'll ask him and get back to you ASAP. You've just got to have a good attitude about it,after I began peeling the first little bits of finish off I thought what in the world have I gotten myself into?  Because once you start peeling it off,there's no putting it back on,at least in my case.  And it's also like the lottery too,you never know what kind of wood will be underneath that finish,I was very lucky to find that mine was a solid piece and not 6-7 pieces of thin wood pressed together.  So I would recommend starting at a spot on the guitar that will let you figure that out before you go tearing into it."

guitarporn,3a8arq,theGuatemalanYMCA,6,Thu Jun 18 17:38:21 2015 UTC,"For those of you questioning the gear I used to shoot this, let me give you a little background; First of all, yes I am a professional photographer with thousands of $$$ worth of gear - but none of it was used for these shots.    Pics are from October 2012 - about a week after I got the guitar (I only just found this sub), a friend was over showing me some of her newest photos from a photography class she was taking. We got to talking about photographing shiny / reflective objects and she saw my guitar in the corner and asked how I'd go about shooting it with very basic gear.    I grab a black 2mx2m piece of cloth I use to hide things on set, 2x $3 LED torches and a walkabout/disposable Canon Rebel Xsi/450D with the 18-55mm kit lens and a 50mm f1.8 - these were bought second hand in early 2012 for about $300 with some other stuff I actually wanted more.    Black cloth goes onto the kitchen bench, guitar on cloth, the torches shining straight up at the white ceiling (photographers trick to turn a crappy small light source into a large pretty one). Move around until you see an appealing angle, move the torches slightly if needed to get an even reflection and shoot.    While I used a DSLR, very similar results could be had from using a phone camera if you take more than 10 seconds to try and photograph something.    My point being - guitars are inherently such pretty things, that getting good photos of them isn't hard.    Or into guitarist friendly terms; having tons of gear is no substitute for actually knowing what to do with the gear."

guitarporn,39lfyx,CaterpillHURR,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:26:28 2015 UTC,I remember the first time I looked down at my guitar and saw blood on my guitar it took me a few seconds to realize it was mine. I was so preoccupied.
guitarporn,39lha9,thepeacockspeaks,17,Fri Jun 12 15:50:32 2015 UTC,"Looks like it's been made to look older than it is somehow. For example that truss rod cover is from a recent Standard, but has been yellowed to look aged.   Also, the logo is canted off to the right, very strange looking. OP, if you could post some more photos, specifically the back of the headstock, the control and neck pickup cavity and the inside of the cutaway it might give us a better idea of what guitar you have.  It's certainly not a '58/'59 like you've said below."
guitarporn,39lha9,RiotBadger,9,Fri Jun 12 22:34:38 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right, all that plus the fact that a reissue 1958 VOS is worth 5 times more than what you traded for a supposed actual 58 has me very sceptical.  Late 50's Les Pauls go for tens of thousands of dollars. I hate to be a downer OP, and if you like it and it sounds great then that's what matters, but I'd be shocked if that's really a vintage Gibson."
guitarporn,39lha9,Progdoggy,7,Sat Jun 13 00:15:03 2015 UTC,It's also got the tune-o-matic bridge rather than the ABR. Snot green newer tuners as well.   Also the weathering sucks. Shit tons of elbow wear with no nicks in the picking area? Sketchy.
guitarporn,39lha9,jazzyt98,5,Sat Jun 13 01:46:41 2015 UTC,"This is definitely artificial heavy relicing. You see gibsons like this all the time on places like the gear page etc. The fact is a real nitrocellulose coat would never get this way unless you left it sitting out in the rain then rubbed tobacco juice and coffee all over it after beating it with a chain for ""belt rash"" and ""wear patterns""  I mean it can look good obviously but this is an example where it may have gone just a tad overboard. I personally am not a fan of the heavy relic style, OR of 40's-50's pinup style art, so this guitar clashes pretty hard with my aesthetic. Now if this were left as a mild relic goldtop this would be a fucking tits guitar"
guitarporn,39lha9,ryoga415,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:09:42 2015 UTC,"I agree, I gave the top a pass because OP said it had been refinished. They could have used Poly which does craze a little like that. Big benefit of the doubt though."
guitarporn,39lha9,RiotBadger,5,Sat Jun 13 08:02:37 2015 UTC,That. Is. Rad.  Edit: don't even care if its fake. Still rad as fuck.
guitarporn,39lha9,kidlarge,4,Fri Jun 12 16:01:34 2015 UTC,"If it was 50's it'd have to be a '56 for reasons mentioned below. Top carve looks wrong, pickguard/knobs/inlay material/trc/tuners look new/wrong. The logo looks wrong or newer too, and the les paul script is too low on the headstock.  Flip it over, take a photo of the back of the headstock and the inside of the cavities."

guitarporn,39lp9p,TheRedditor560,2,Fri Jun 12 16:44:33 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, is there a major difference in quality between the S2 series guitars and other similar models? Or is it just choice wood and custom Pup's?"
guitarporn,39lp9p,StoplightLoosejaw,2,Fri Jun 12 20:17:56 2015 UTC,"Well, I'll try to explain it the best I can.  The SE models of prs are a lower costing model that isn't ""cheap"" by any means. I own one actually and it feels like a very expensive guitar. The guitars are manufactured in Korea but then sent up to Maryland, U.S. To be set up/inspected. The SE line uses a different top wood too, it's called Maple Veneer, which sounds/looks great but it isn't through and through maple.  The s2 is crafted straight out of Maryland. No if ands or buts about that. Some of the differences in SE vs s2 is that the s2 has ""s2 locking tuners"" which NEVER go out of tune man. You can beat this thing up and it'll never slip. The top like I said it different from SE vs s2. The s2 uses a figured maple top so it's a nice hard block of maple. The fret inlays are different, the s2 uses a higher quality design.  Now I don't know much about the core models, $2k and up, but I know they are sick!! Their core models, like the rest of their guitars, are crafted with precision like no other manufacturer. The wood they use is phenomenal, hardware is great and the pickups, oh man the pickups sound amazing.   I HIGHLY recommend searching on YouTube for a ""inside prs factory"" those videos changed the way I look at PRS guitars   Here you go!"
guitarporn,39lp9p,StoplightLoosejaw,2,Fri Jun 12 21:13:57 2015 UTC,Thanks. I saw these videos a while ago but I'm definitely going to watch them again. Oh what I would give for half that equipment to build my own guitars...

Custom Warmoth Vintage Modern construction 1 piece Quartersawn Dark Indian Rosewood Tele neck with 6150 frets, 1 11/16"" but width and a compound 10-16"" radius. It's unfinished and will be played raw. I'm going with a brass nut and Schaller tuners. It took me 5 months of hunting every other day on their Showcase. In speaking with folks at Warmoth they rarely do many ""exotic"" telecaster builds because of the nature of most Tele players being more traditional. They had lots of roasted maple, flame maple, Birdseye maple and even some mahogany but rarely ever do all Rosewood. It was agonizing 3 week wait but she looks beautiful! She'll be paired with a 5A flame maple body with swamp ash back (pics in my profile history).   http://imgur.com/a/7IqOJ"

Not a deal breaker by any stretch.   I would definitely give this guitar high marks. PRS SE's continue to crush the competition when it comes to build quality for the price. I can't imagine the $2000 American made single cut style guitar can play that much better than this does. Get a good set up and you're good to go."

guitarporn,395oy4,Seaguitar,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:19:30 2015 UTC,"Yes actually. I did the JP1 mod not too long ago. It definitely brightened up the amp just like people on the internet say it will. One thing that I noticed that I didn't read about was that the output level then dropped quite a bit as well. The amp still sounds good, but its simply not as loud as it used to be. It's not an issue for me since it's just a home use amp, and the overall tone is much better.  If you do the JP1 mod (you literally just cut jumper number 1, that's it), you can wire it to a switch and put it on the face of the amp, but I didn't bother because I'm pretty sure I'd never flip it back."

What made you go for the Strandberg over other boutique builders?   Most of my gear is vintage themed, but I've recently thought about something like a Boden because they're just perfectly engineered music tools. They don't worry about sticking to the molds of the past and I kind of like that. Granted, it seems like these are geared towards high gain folks, but I don't really think that's all they'd be good at."
guitarporn,38olbq,dlheidemann,2,Tue Jun 9 13:03:38 2015 UTC,"A million answers:   I love it. I've had three different .strandbergs* now and this is definitely the best so far.  I do play mostly high gain stuff but I also enjoy zoning out with some ambient cleans. This guitar will handle anything you throw at it.  The design and lack of traditional guitar features is why I chose strandberg again. This is what a guitar should be.   There are a lot of YouTube videos of these guitars being used for jazz, cleans, etc. They're very versatile sound wise but more importantly, they're ergonomic and extremely comfortable."

guitarporn,38fk6u,fwinzor,2,Thu Jun 4 02:12:28 2015 UTC,Agile 8 String owner with EMG 808 here. The guitar is pretty awesome. I heard that they can come with minor defficiencies but mine came out perfect. The EMGs are ok but I strongly prefare Bareknuckles and guess I'll change them some day.
guitarporn,38fk6u,InfiniteQuasar,2,Thu Jun 4 13:08:04 2015 UTC,Yea I love emg for distortion and high gain but you always get a dirty clean and can never get that crisp clear clean like a passive can. IMO. Thanks for the input!
guitarporn,38fk6u,MonitorZero,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:21:51 2015 UTC,"No Problem. Also I've found that the Bareknuckles retain an amazing clarity in high gain territory. But I also think that among the EMGs the 808s are not the greatest. Imo it shows that they were their very first 8 string pickups, and they improved with the later models. Nothing wrong with some good old 81/85, though."
guitarporn,38fk6u,InfiniteQuasar,2,Thu Jun 4 14:42:56 2015 UTC,Yea even with 8 string pick ups I would sooner go for a 7 string baritone before going to a full on 8 only because the 8 string pickups are not the best yet. My other 7 string schecter is tuned to a mock 8 string (drop Bb for the first 6 and a low G as the 7th) and it sound way better than any 8 string IMO.

guitarporn,38el2d,Ferrocile,3,Wed Jun 3 21:09:27 2015 UTC,I am a total strat guy and I love the body shape of that natural strat.  I do not like all of the extra filigree on it.  I mostly like that the body shape allows for me to play it resting on my leg while sitting down.
guitarporn,38el2d,Ferrocile,2,Wed Jun 3 19:18:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's hard to beat the original strat design. Some of our guitars have that custom pinstripe on it, I don't think they will all have that when we put them into production."

guitarporn,38el2d,MinusOnePotato,2,Wed Jun 3 19:55:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you! We really like that one. Did you happen to read the description of it in the details of the video? It's actually inspired by the Nilsen Guitar (aka Plankan, here's a pic) which was arguably the first mass-produced solid-body electric guitar. It was made in Norway in '49 (I think?) and 500 were produced. Very interesting instruments, no pickups but it had a magnet and a condenser for each string.  Anyway, our Nilsen Spirit is a tribute to that guitar. We didn't want to do a remake, so we did a guitar that the Nilsen company would have made if they had continued."

guitarporn,387ewr,andKento,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:25:51 2015 UTC,I like how everyone is hating on his strings but noone says shit when someone posts a pic of their First Act or Squier guitar taken with a Nokia from 2004 with a bunch of trash in the background.
guitarporn,387ewr,SamaliciousCrunk,3,Tue Jun 2 15:20:44 2015 UTC,"Because guitars are beautiful. An instrument is an instrument, whether it be a Wangcaster or a pristine 1959 Les Paul with a beautiful burst, and instruments are art. Not to mention, even a cheap guitar is signifying someone actually getting into guitar... Even if it's not a great choice, maybe it was all they could afford, and they're still getting into a wonderful hobby. It's not about how much it costs, or how many toanz it has, it's about feeling.  But those strings look like shit."

guitarporn,3834uw,himynameisroy,2,Tue Jun 2 06:31:05 2015 UTC,"I'll give you the rundown as I understand it.    The short answer is:  There is nothing ""bad"" about Norlin era Gibson's.  there are good ones and bad ones, and ones that are good but nobody liked, and etc.  With that said, they put out new designs that buyers didn't find necessary, and didn't sell.  They also introduced changes to the Les Paul, that purists are still wailing about today.  Some example of those changes are pancake construction bodies (multiple thin layers  stacked and glued together, instead of solid mahogany with a maple cap), flatter top carves, larger headstocks, 3-piece tops, 3-piece necks, mini-buckers, headstock angle changes, and the ever controversial volute.  There are also claims of crappy QC, ""mystery woods"", and on and on.  The internet is full of reasons that people hate those guitars.  I've been lucky to play a '72 Deluxe and a '78 Deluxe (they looked like the far right and far left guitars OP's pic), and both were beautifully made and sounded very nice.    I don't have much experience with Norlin era guitars, so take my post as what it is; commentary, on internet commentary."

guitarporn,37vrnr,I_swehttam_I,4,Sat May 30 20:26:15 2015 UTC,Why are ibanez so praised in this sub?  Why are they good? Just asking because i barely got into guitars a couple months ago and i like knowing something from every brand. Are their cheaper guitars good?
guitarporn,37vrnr,OcularJamdown,12,Sat May 30 20:28:47 2015 UTC,"Actually one of the best things about them IS their quality across the board.  I got my 7321 on craigslist for $250 with Dimarzios already in it and refinished, and it is no lie one of the greatest guitars I've ever played.  I got it set up, and I re-did all the soldering and swapped out the switch and pot for dimarzios, and it's now even better - so all said and done like $300 for the guitar.    Their necks are arguably the best in the business outside of custom guitar shops, and even then it's really a taste debate.  It'd be hard to argue that they don't have the best necks in the sub $1000 guitar range.  Their shape and weight/balance is always amazing, and their tone/versatility is amazing as well.    Sure you can compare them to any other axe out there - be it ESP, Carvin, Jackson, etc...but in the sub $1000 range I really feel like there is no competition to Ibanez.    Once you start getting into the $1000+ range, at that point it's all about taste anyway, and you already know what you want.  Ibanez still puts out a great high end guitar, but obviously the high end ones have a lot more competition from companies like EBMM, Mayones, Carvin, Blackmachines, Caparison, etc....  Notice I left out the ""classic"" type guitar companies like Gibson, Fender, Rickenbacker, etc... this is because I don't feel like it's a fair comparison.  Axes like Ibbys can absolutely harness blues/jazz tones, but someone that's really into Rickenbackers or classic strats is usually not the kind of person that will be into a 7 string Ibanez.  Gibsons can be an exception, but they're ridiculously heavy compared to an Ibanez.  I love my 7321 about 1000x better than my Strat."

First thing I did was obviously the locking Schaller tuners, and then the pickups - the 2 single coils are vintage 54 noiseless, and a Seymour Duncan Slash in the bridge, a new teflon nut, and painted the headstock and bridge."

It's a black 2010(?) squier that came with Hot Rails. I'm planning to put in some thicker sounding humbuckers, throw on a black with a red side stripe pickguard, change it to master vol/tone, 3 way switch and probably do what you did with the headstock. Maybe I'll even add some red racing stripes Did you also paint the neck? I love unfinished/satin necks but I don't want it to look uneven."

Whether it's a fender or Squier, IMO it's a useless instrument until it has locking tuners on it.  Strats just do not hold tuning, even without using the whammy.  When using the whammy, fuckin forget about it.  I suppose that depends on how much you like it and if you're willing to spend $60-80 on it, but ya."

guitarporn,37umyd,SubcommanderMarcos,-4,Sun May 31 04:42:10 2015 UTC,sanding will not brake it. there are different degrees of sand paper. theres a proper way to do it without needing to laser cut. i didnt say anything cunty in my first post i actually complemented the idea. some people just cant take criticism i guess.

guitarporn,37fpyk,skillmau5,4,Wed May 27 19:44:28 2015 UTC,"I think a big part of it is the significance in rock music. Les Paul's from those three years (1957-1960) were extremely prevalent in most rock albums from the 70's.   Besides that, they're pretty awesome guitars. The weight, pickups, neck widths - almost everything - is used as the model for Gibson guitars today. These things are so great that people will pay tens of thousands for replicas. I mean of course the perfect guitar depends on the player, and tone is completely subjective... But this guitar is responsible for a huge percentage of the tones you find on classic rock records.   The last point is the rarity. Despite their popularity in the 70's, there really aren't that many of them kicking around. Personally, I agree with you that the price is pretty ridiculous, but owning one is like owning an original piece of artwork. Sure you can get new copies of varying quality for cheap, but there's something about the idea of owning the original that makes people go fucking nuts for some reason. Just my two cents."
guitarporn,37fpyk,optiplexwhisperer,4,Wed May 27 21:32:44 2015 UTC,"well, this one is over-priced by about 100k. a good condition '60 burst will run you roughly 160-180k, and this one has had a giant chunk taken out of the top, which is the most iconic part of the guitar (hence why they are referred to as ""bursts""). when this eventually sells it will be for far less then the current asking price.  first run bursts, les pauls produced from 1958-1960 (after which the les paul model changed to the sg body style) combine all the elements that makes something collectable. rarity, quality and iconic-ness.  only about 1600 were made during those 3 years. during the late 50s production model electric guitars weren't made en-mass like they are today, so every guitar back then was very much hand-crafted like custom made guitars of today. there wasn't import restrictions on woods, so you could easily import high quality foreign woods.  and lastly, the image they convey. many, many artists are closely associated with these guitars. Peter Green, Paul Kossoff, Jimmy Page, Slash, Billy Gibbons, Keith Richards, Duane Allman, the list goes on and on.  they are collectible guitars that also happen to be iconic, rare, great playing, incredible sounding guitars."

guitarporn,37fpyk,batman1285,1 point,Wed May 27 22:30:30 2015 UTC,Slash's guitar isn't even a Gibson. It's a replica made by Kris Derrig I'm not sure what true vintage Gibsons he does own and when he acquired them/recorded with them.
guitarporn,37fpyk,PostPostModernism,-1,Tue Jun 2 03:22:45 2015 UTC,"Maaaan, if you want those authentic retro tones you gotta pay big.  That old growth wood, dude!    /s"
guitarporn,37fpyk,daddydidncare,-4,Wed May 27 19:59:54 2015 UTC,I'd love to meet the clueless dunce that would buy something like that.
guitarporn,37fpyk,RiotBadger,7,Wed May 27 13:58:28 2015 UTC,"Hi, nice to meet you.   If I had the right amount of disposable income I would definitely own a burst."
guitarporn,37fpyk,iamAARAN,6,Wed May 27 16:36:43 2015 UTC,"Plus at this rate, it's basically an investment. There's only going to be less as time goes on, and you won't be hard pressed to find a buyer if you did want to sell it."
guitarporn,37fpyk,daddydidncare,-1,Wed May 27 16:48:43 2015 UTC,For that price? You know nothing about guitars then.
guitarporn,37fpyk,RiotBadger,4,Wed May 27 16:49:07 2015 UTC,"Obviously not, I bow to your superior knowledge..."
guitarporn,37fpyk,FiddlesFromMyFingers,2,Wed May 27 16:56:41 2015 UTC,"He's right. Not even the Lloyd Loar mandolins go for that much, and there are waaaayyy fewer of those. Plus, it's had extensive work done. Maybe if it was in mint condition and owned by a big name, like if Hendrix bought it, put it in a closet, got high and forgot all about it, a quarter mil would be reasonable."
guitarporn,37fpyk,RiotBadger,1 point,Wed May 27 17:30:25 2015 UTC,"Scarcity doesn't automatically predicate a high asking price, the demand has to greatly outweigh the supply.  Also, I said i'd own a burst, not this Burst - I've always preferred the feel and look of '59s so that would be what i'd be looking for if I was ever in that position."
