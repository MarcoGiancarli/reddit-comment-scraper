As stated on the top of the every page in the directory:   This directory listing is considered an expert interface to locating PDF documents. Please refer to the main forms and publications landing page for more details on locating specific forms, publications, or instructions.   So it's just a different way to access media (mostly pdf's) from their webservers instead of getting it from their main websites.  Still a pretty cool find!"
opendirectories,3d9cs6,bhwork,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:31:05 2015 UTC,"Oops, you're right. I didn't consider that using the title I chose would lead people to think it is US citizens tax returns, or something of the sort. I should have been more specific. Thanks for the heads up, and I will keep this in mind."
opendirectories,3d9cs6,tzenrick,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:50:24 2015 UTC,"It's not a database, just a directory listing of the forms available on their website."
