You can either flat out refuse to eat more than usual and exercise like hell, which will keep you skinny until you eventually land in the hospital (or IP) with an NG tube, or you can go along with their calorie plan as much as possible but keep up the other ED behaviors (weighing/measuring yourself, logging food, etc.) to keep yourself sane until they back off enough for you to restrict again.  If I were in that position my first instinct would be to eat everything they give me really quickly, and then ask for more and more until they get so annoyed they let me eat what I choose, and then do the whole chew&spit/throwing out food/crumbs on a plate thing. Downsides of that is you'd gain weight really fast, probably feel nauseous all the time, and it'd be really hard to keep up long enough to work. There's not really an easy way out here, and you're going to end up gaining some weight either way.

Do you currently go to school or work? How do your days look like?  Maybe try setting up small goals for yourself every day (write them in a calendar), just like to get out and go for a walk, read a chapter in a book, cook a healthy meal. That has helped me a lot with depression/motivation issues. Not every day is good but I feel better. I have a tiny pocket calendar I write a little list of things I want to do every day and after I have done them I make a little + sign next to it.    When I feel really down about how I have eaten, ""ruined my life"", ""ruined my body"", I just try to take a second and reevaluate. Those thoughts have no good purpose, they only serve to make you unhappier so its better to try to rid of them best as you can. Its hard to give advice on eating often, because I know if you are obsessed with food any kind of new way of eating can be taken to an extreme. How do you eat right now? What does your average day  look like?"

Here's a list of what I have eaten today:  http://imgur.com/a/5lGDI (I'm sorry it's in German.. But I guess you can still figure out most of it)  My average day consists of going to school and eating about 200 calories until noon. Then I get home and suddenly I catch myself eating all the things. Pizza, ice cream, bread, nutella, fast food... Whatever unhealthy thing to eat you name, chances are high, I just had some of it.  I'll try setting up small goals and stay more active during the day.

Maybe you could try to plan out your whole day meals and try to divide it more evenly. I found if i ate too little early in the day I would get really hungry at night and then I would eat way way past when I was satiated.  Your food log looks good for today! Do you mostly binge out of hunger or is it something else?  Yes, fighting the thoughts is the hardest thing in it all. I think most important is to let go a little and to trust that if you stick to your plans you will meet your goals, and only thing that can come between you and your goals are the negative thoughts."

I mean, most of your diet will be fruits and veggies.   If you don't want to do that, then plan out your days. Write down what you're going to eat the next day (1 egg white, an apple, 15 pretzels etc) and then stick to it. You don't have to make a decision if you're going to eat it when you're in front of it if you've already decided the night before.

You can also take a body pic once a week and compare that way.  Sometimes it can show more of a difference than the scale when you are working out.

proED,3dy8be,p00piepie,2,Mon Jul 20 17:36:59 2015 UTC,"Hmm, although it's possible that she's lost fat and gained muscle, muscle growth is a really slow process. At most, a woman without the use of steroids will gain 1lb of muscle a month, and 0.25lb a week. (You can read more here). With OP's projected weight loss, I don't think this is the case.  OP, on assuming that your activity level is correct, I would check your calories again. The ranch dressing on your salad can add up to 250cal if you're not careful. I'd measure everything on a food scale that goes into my mouth if I'm not losing weight. You said you work in a kitchen four days a week--do you have to taste the food? If your shifts are 3-6 hours long 4 days a week and you have to taste the food without keeping in mind what calories they hold, (and depending on what you serve/cook), it may add up to a lot of calories over the shift. If they're right, maybe you're just in a plateau!   You also may just be holding water weight, because working out--especially building muscle--holds water for recovery. Also, between the 121.8 pounds and 120.4 pounds, did you weigh yourself at the same time with the same circumstances? (Recently urinated/defecated, no clothes on, early morning?) Keeping urine before weighing yourself can add up to 1.5lbs worth! (If you drink a lot of water and liquids!)"
proED,3dy8be,p00piepie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:35:53 2015 UTC,"I really anal about weighing myself and weighing food, I do both the way you said. I use mfp and weigh out everything. I don't eat at work. I eat 1/3 cup oatmeal (nothing was clear if calories were counted by measuring it cooked or uncooked so I measured uncooked) with a scoop of protein powder in the morning, and either a pbj sandwich with the condiments weighed out or two chicken breasts for dinner. That's it.   I just measured my bust, waist, and hips. I've lost about an inch for each of these.   Could it be that I just messed my body up, I've been going through ""cycles"" since I was 11 (I'm 21) where one year I'm ED and the next year I'm not.  Should I just up my exercise, add some cardio? I don't do cardio."
proED,3dy8be,SkinniMinni,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:46:45 2015 UTC,"--Whoops, thought I was responding to someone else. I'm editing this post to cater it to you, because I added in some things that were on the basis of a different conversation.  Edited!: For the oatmeal, I would suggest to measure it cooked. Having it uncooked doesn't take into account the water or any other condiments you might add, like salt or sugar. If you really aren't losing weight, it may be that your body is holding water for muscle recovery, or you've plateau'd for the past few weeks. It could also be due to hormones, and the female body tends to hold onto fluids/water weight when menstruating, but that'd only matter if you're weighing yourself on your period or up to a week before it. The last thing I could think of is using medication that messes with your BMR.  You did lose inches off your body, though, so it means that something disappeared! Cardio is great for creating more of a calorie deficit, so if you want to get smaller in general, I think it's great. But, if you want a body recomp, keep the weight lifting/bodyweight exercises going. You can of course, do both, but I don't think not having cardio would be the reason why you aren't losing weight.   Keep on pushing through though! If you still can't lose weight in the next few months despite having an extremely restricted intake and exercise routine, I think it calls for a trip to your GP. There may be something else going on with your body."

proED,3dukmp,Secretly_skinny,4,Sun Jul 19 16:56:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with foobar. The two weeks will be over really quick! In fact, if you're not usually active when eating ~450cal (I'm going to guess around 250 for the cereal and 200 for the salad w/o dressing, I like overestimating), it may be hard for you to sustain on that. Also, eating nothing for dinner might arouse suspicion from the supervisors at your camp, so be careful about that. If you need to eat to horseback ride without feeling sick or lethargic, go ahead and give yourself that boost. I think it's more important that you don't draw attention from others that you might have an ED that you undereat. I would be worried about them contacting your mother with concern. However, that is my opinion; just be safe! Honestly, when I can't count calories, I drink a lot of water before and during my meal, and pay attention to how my body feels. I have a tendency to eat more than I need when I don't do this, so if I don't have an already determined portion I've made (like at restaurants), I do this and it never seems to mess up the scales for me. Also, if you have a somewhat portable digital food scale, could you possibly bring it along with you to weigh your meals? I'm not sure how much privacy you get, but if you're able to eat in your room should they provide one, you may have enough closure to be able to weigh your foods and put it away quickly."

And a good thing to do is start with the basics, no liquid calories, no sweets, chug lots of water and stick with protein to drop weight fast.  What I'm doing right now is eating a HUGE plate of salad with protein (gives the full feeling, which is good if you're used to eating lots, and it's pretty low cal)  My salad consists of ~100g lettuce ~80g cabbage ~50g carrots/beets/tomatoes and sometimes I add broccoli or heart of palm for variety. Protein anything from 60 to 100g of shredded chicken or another protein if I'm having a meal with family. And no fatty dressings, I use balsamic vinegar (10 cal tbsp) but going without dressings is even better if you like the taste.  Well, you gotta find what works for you and stick with it.

I don't really have a social circle where I live now, partly because I work from home, and partly because I'm horribly shy.  I have several acquaintances that I see at the gym, but the few times I've brought up diet it's been met with ""we all need to eat more regardless of if it makes us fat because muscle"".  I did go to a BBQ for one of the couples we know from the gym last week, and I ended up overeating (freaking m&m cookies slay me).  I have hid bingeing in the past while it's happening by taking food to my office downstairs, or making several trips through the kitchen grabbing handfuls of food until it's gone.    I was diagnosed with panic disorder/gad when I was nine, and I'm 31 now.  I get bouts of depression as a symptom of the anxiety.  My dream circle would be other fit chicks that meet over things other than food and bars.  I do have to get over being shy first."
proED,3dqt0f,weightliftingwaif,2,Sat Jul 18 21:54:59 2015 UTC,"I'm unsure of whether my friends know I'm restricting or not. One day, I went out with my friends for lunch and they insisted that I eat with them. I ordered a mushroom burger and took it apart. I ate all the lettuce and mushroom, and only half the meat. This was at an early time where I didn't realize that what I was doing was ""ED-esque"", and my friends asked if I was restricting because of my appearance. I was sort of offended by it, because of the way they blatantly asked it. I said no, and that I was full. Both of the people I went out to eat with were tall and male (6' and 6'3'' respectively) and ate a lot. They reluctantly the situation go, but every time when we went to lunch and I ate so little, I'm sure it validated their suspicions. I was talking to the taller one a few months later and he told me he was hungry. Curious, I asked what he ate, and he told me he ate a few hot dogs, some soup, and water. Without thinking, I responded, ""Wow, that's so much."" In reality, that doesn't even meet half the daily requirement (TDEE) of a 6'3'' moderately active man. He gave me a weird look and said, ""You know, that really isn't a lot. You should probably eat more."" I felt so embarrassed. Ever so often, it comes up and he says stuff like, ""Welp, you're still not eating enough. Eat more.""--and leaves it at that. This is actually the opposite for me; I will eat NOTHING out, but I will eat like a cow inside my house. Whenever I am doing homework, I will subconsciously think of taking a food or nap break to procrastinate. In my head, I assume it's because ""it's a natural human function that can't be avoided"", so it validates my procrastination instead of doing it ""for no good reason"". If I go out and study, I only drink the tea that I ordered from the place, and I go monk mode on studying. Although, I actually don't hang out with people, and I haven't seen a friend for about four months, so I don't get pressured to eat. Once in awhile, my parents will invite me out to eat, and I get soup (200cal!) wherever we go.  Nope! I don't have a social life. I was diagnosed with manic depression/general anxiety disorder at age 11. I feel like I have terrible mental stability and my psychological well-being can be thrown off by anything. I stopped my treatment at 13 because I knew that I wasn't trying to make any strides to become better, and pills/therapy was just an excuse to make up for my failures. I really hated myself and I still regret a lot of things I didn't do because I blamed it on my depression. I've been able to function without pills and therapy, and I'm too scared to go back because I'm certain that I'll be diagnosed with an ED and will be forced into rehabilitation. I have been speaking openly to the person I talk to the most from real life about it. They don't know I have an ""ED-esque"" thought process (from what I know), but they know that I eat way less than I should. Admittedly, I had one of the thinspiration blogs open on my tab and I was sharing my screen with him for some math homework, and I think he saw that tab. He had to. He read out all my tabs except that one.  Other than that friend, the only other person who knows is my boyfriend. I tried to hide it for the longest time, and since we are long distance, it worked perfectly for awhile. However, I started losing weight and I told him about it, mainly because I wanted to share my happiness with someone. He was asking how I was losing and, well, it didn't go well. Once I came over and lived two weeks with him, is what really made him believe I have an ED. He's underweight and only eats ~900cal a day, and the fact that I ate even less alarmed him. We've gotten into a multitude of fights over it, and he used to tell me to eat everyday. It stressed me out, and he found out that I browsed /r/proED, which we got into a big argument over. When he brought up /r/proED and claimed it was a bad influence, and was only making it worse, I broke down and told him it was the only place for me to be myself, and that he wouldn't accept me, but /r/proED will. I think it really bugged him, because he then asked me to never go below 105, and now he's completely stopped with asking me to eat.   Edit: Geez, I write a lot. Sorry for my entire life story!"

So: don't mind doing it quietly in front of people, uncomfortable if it's brought up in public. Nope. I feel very uncomfortable eating anything BUT ""rabbit food"" in front of people.  I like nights out drinking because I usually dance a lot and shed water weight, and also my tolerance is very low (especially on an empty stomach). Most people know not to ask me out to dinner anymore, but if I need to I'll just eat and purge. Used to have a panic disorder, still deal with generalized anxiety (but my ED saves me from it). I love how numb my ED makes me feel. I haven't cried in months, even thought fucked up things have happened. My therapist once said ""You don't feel your feelings, you purge them."" I've unfortunately gotten drunk and told a fair few of my friends what was up. They can tell anyway. Plenty have approached me with concern. I keep my family so far out of it though.

proED,3dq736,electille,5,Sat Jul 18 11:12:15 2015 UTC,"Oh that sucks.   There's nothing by itself that would explain 5 lbs, unless you've been bingeing.    Water weight can add a couple of lbs: you may have been dehydrated at 111, but you are retaining now. Certain foods will even make you retain water.   Constipation can add a pound or two.   But it's not real weight: it will go away in time. Low fat foods can make you constipated, but so can other certain foods: salty foods, high carbs,  etc.   Finally, your scale can read differently if it is in a different location on the floor.  That too doesn't make you weigh any more.   It may be a combination of all of these.  Have confidence though: a calorie deficit always makes you lose weight. You know how to eat and exercise to a deficit. Just keep doing what you're doing and you'll get back to 111.    It sucks but it happens. Just try to think about what you ate in the last couple of days and try to figure out if something might have contributed, and try to avoid the one or two things you suspect and see if it goes away.   But you got there before and you'll get there again.  It's a slow,  steady process, but you can do it."

proED,3doic5,foodisevil,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:17:14 2015 UTC,BMI is not the most accurate measurement of body fat and  low body fat may be what's causing the problem. For example my  BMI is 17.1 but my actual body fat is ~20% of my weight according to my body composition scale. This is because my bones are super thin so they weigh a lot less than the bones of someone like my friend who is three inches shorter but clearly has bones half again as thick as mine.  Stress can also be a factor but for me I tend to just continue spotting and bleeding when I'm stressed...for months. It's really annoying.

Although he eats a lot more than me, he definitely has a small deficit which is why he's where he is (I guesstimate him to eat around 1200 a day). It's frustrating for me, because I want to be smaller than him. I hate feeling like I'm a big whale whenever I'm in his arms; I want to feel small when he hugs me. He always pressures me to eat and knows of my fasting tendencies. He and I argue a lot about it, especially when he found out I browsed /r/proED. During that argument, I broke down and told him that no one else supports me and this community is all I have. Ever since then, he hasn't pressured me to eat and we don't talk about it anymore. It makes me really sad, because I wish my SO would cheer me on and support me, but he doesn't want me to change. It puts a weird cognitive dissonance in my head because I would naturally think he'd want me to not be fat--but he's also telling me to keep the fat. He is definitely my IRL thinspo because he is ridiculously skinny and has a big thigh gap. You can see the separation on his spine and his shoulder blades clearly. When hes sits down, there isn't any fat gushing out like my body. I was actually really happy when I could fit in his shorts, because it made me feel less fat. His shorts are really baggy on him though, so it's probably because of that.   One similarity I can think of is not really an eating habit, but it's looking at food. I love watching food being made and I love making food! For whatever reason, watching food being made and making food makes me want to eat food less. We'll watch cooking videos by FoodWishes together and we've made lasagna together when I visited him! (Although, I actually only got to eat one small slice. His father loved it and ate most of it.)

proED,3ddy5a,Secretly_skinny,4,Wed Jul 15 14:55:35 2015 UTC,"Waking up lighter than when you went to bed is the norm. A few reasons:  1) While you sleep, your body does the bulk of its maintenance and repair work (even moreso if you've been exercising during the day). All this requires calories. This is also why sleep is so incredibly important—you need that downtime to focus on maintenance and repair of body tissues in order to function normally.  2) You dehydrate while you sleep, which can account for some of that weight loss.  3) You do a lot of your digesting while you sleep (your body can devote more energy to digesting when it's not busy doing other stuff like moving around). The digestion process (including all the friendly bacteria in your gut that do a lot of the digesting) burns calories.  Getting lots of sleep is DEFINITELY important for weight loss and overall health.  Edit to add that your body never burns one form of fuel at a time—fat (either from food or stored bodyfat), carbs (either from food or stored as glycogen), or proteins (either from from food or muscle); it always burns a combination of these things. The type of activity you do (including length and intensity) dictates the proportion of which fuels are burned. So when you are burning calories (even while sleeping), you are burning some amount of fat, but not just fat."

I did that maybe 2 months ago though and will do it again eventually just to make sure accuracy has been retained. I don't find myself that worried about it anymore.

Get plenty of sleep and don't obsess, as (at least with my experience) the stress impeded my weight loss. Also, if you drink cut out alcohol!!"

Keep up the weight lifting, it helps your body keep burning calories after you've stopped working out.   Honestly if you want to lose weight, 1400 kcal a day is high. I'm around the same stats as you and I'm sticking around 500 kcal a day, plus the gym. But that's my decision, ymmv.   If you want a buddy, I'm here for you!"

proED,3daskl,FoofyFoof,2,Wed Jul 15 01:35:56 2015 UTC,"The answer to your question is about 12lbs if you're willing to do anything.  Weights are not really for weight loss, and will usually impede your weight loss progress. If y  ou do a lot more cardio, and cut calories to something close to 800, a realistic goal is about 2lbs per week.  But you can do as much as 3 lbs per week if you just about kill yourself trying.   Find a bike, either a real one or a stationary one, and go as hard as you can one hour in the morning and one hour at night.   As for cutting below 800 calories, all of the research says you will have long term weight loss problems if you go beneath it. So I always try to stay just above it.   If you can do the Cardio, that's 1200 calories. BMR is probably about 1300 calories. Intake of 800 calories is a 1700 calorie deficit, nearly a half pound per day, should you should hit 3lbs per week or 12 lbs over the 4 weeks you have left. It won't be remotely fun."

proED,3d996f,1YearWonder,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:08:16 2015 UTC,"Any warm liquid should help relax your tummy, and if you start dealing with indigestion, gas, or heartburn, laying down on your left side can help. A warm hotwaterbottle or heating pad can be soothing as well. Pretty much the same advice as for period cramps, but skip the Midol.   Over the next couple of days, you'll want to pay attention to the fiber content of what you're eating (or take fiber supplements) to help 'move' things along. You don't want to end up constipated after all this. Black coffee is also a good idea, it's a natural diuretic and might help clear you out. I see you say you don't purge, and that's really smart. Avoid laxatives too (except for their intended use), they come with their own set of issues.   Most of all... don't get discouraged. This happens to all of us, more often than any of us would like. It's not how often we stumble, its how often we get back up that matters."

I have noticed that the cheaper the restaurant the more food they give you. Quantity over quality I guess. My first idea is to ask for a box right away and put about half of your food in it and save it for later in the day or the next day. I would assume they give out like 3 serving sizes.

Distract distract distract. Don't dwell on temptation. Just treat the fast like it's not a big deal, just another day.  This is what works for me personally.

Johnson, JUDDD, 5:2, Intermittent, Juice, Dry, etc. There are many different fasts. You also have the ability to alter them to whatever suits you best.   For me, personally, yes, I would fast. I fast at least 2 consecutive days a week (I only eat 5 out of 7 days, and under 600 calories those 7 days, on top of a regular work-out). However, I don't binge.   If you find you may have a binging issue, than fasting may trigger more binges. You need to learn what works for you.   I'd suggest starting a simple 12 - 24 hr fast, and then working your way up to a 72 hr fast. That should give you a good idea on how you deal with fasting.

I'd been doing fine for almost a month (I have BED) with completely zero cravings for junk food etc, until I watched a video of a Japanese YouTube star who eats like, 4kg of instant noodles in 30 minutes.  I wouldn't say that these girls 'binge'. They do not look lost, and helpless, and pathetic when they're shoving food into their mouths. They look fucking cute and adorable, taking big bites of food while cooing about how delicious it all is.  Maybe it's just my ED speaking, maybe it's just spite and jealousy, but I think that all these girls purge. I'm sorry for how messed up that sounds. :("
proED,3d0o5l,drunkenphilosophy,4,Sun Jul 12 16:02:24 2015 UTC,"so do you think watching them is more likely to make you binge or prevent you from doing so?  also, keep in mind they're paid to do this so they gotta look all cute when they're being recorded. and that was something i was wondering--do these people just deal with the weight gain for money? how sustainable is this type of cam job? it's quite a curious fad."
proED,3d0o5l,drunkenphilosophy,3,Sun Jul 12 16:09:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry! I completely blanked over your question in the first place, my bad. I was very triggered by it (it's in my post history). It reminded me of my past self, who was prone to random bouts of overeating, but I was still very skinny then.  You're right, it's their job to look cute. Thing is, I think most people with BED don't just binge because they're craving food or hungry, they binge as an emotional response to stress or certain triggers. Whereas with Mukbang, they're eating because it's good food? Idk.  I didn't read the NPR article, but I did see a great documentary on Mukbang on Nowness (linked to Youtube). One of the most prominent female Mukbang stars quit due to 'stress' because she was becoming very prolific and big money was involved, but I don't know if that is due to weight gain, and I doubt it. As for sustainability...I doubt it is. I think of shows like Man vs Food and this is kind of like the vlog version I guess?"
proED,3d0o5l,Virgil1414,2,Sun Jul 12 16:18:02 2015 UTC,"yes, it's certainly not a case of people with BED recording themselves during a binge nor is it an exact equivalent of a binge episode.

It's probably better to know how your restricting/fasting has been affecting you so that you can adjust afterward to avoid serious health issues (by taking supplements or eating more veggies or whatever). If any of your bloodwork does come back abnormal (and assuming your doctor doesn't suspect you of having an eating disorder), you should be able to pass it off as a one time thing by saying you've been sick or something like that."

You just have to wait it out. Your stomach isn't used to digesting so much so suddenly. Don't weigh yourself for four days if you don't want to see high numbers. It's just water and food weight. It'll come off by the fourth day and you may even weigh less than pre-binge.  I've not tried cutting out all grains, but I know you might get carb flu, which is what keto dieters get when they start. I'm thinking of going keto but not sure. If you cut out grains, that might be what you want be up doing."
proED,3czat2,Virgil1414,2,Sun Jul 12 05:01:46 2015 UTC,right? I mean strict keto is harder than grain free - raw vegans are also grain free for example - but it's a serious thought. i was at 20% carbs today with my only actual source of carbs being hummus nd Greek yogurt. tempted to shoot for 5% for Sunday (today? tomorrow? fuck the early am)  it certainly hides the heavily disordered eating lol.
proED,3czat2,Virgil1414,3,Sun Jul 12 05:08:30 2015 UTC,Going keto is actually an amazing excuse to hide disordered eating because keto is in the realm of normal dieting. I might actually try that. Gluten free is also one of my favorite.

Nutella? who needs that shit lol).   I definitely noticed a difference while off it, especially in my belly. I suspect it might be a gluten intolerance (not allergy/sensitivity), but tbh I'd rather sneak in a slice daily than ban it and then binge.   I've heard heaps about people who feel a lot better after cutting grains entirely - so maybe you're one of those!   p.s keto induction almost killed me I swear...good luck with it!

As for the actual stretch marks, there isn't much you can do, because it's an actual tear in a deep layer of your skin. I went crazy when I first got mine and tried so hard to get rid of them. I tried all the myths about rubbing cocoa butter on them and all the expensive stretch mark creams, but to no avail. I finally did research on the effectiveness of stretch mark creams, and there were little results. I couldn't handle having them all over my legs; I swore off wearing dresses and skirts. Although, there is new evidence that suggests tretinoin cream helps the NEWER stretch marks heal, tretinoin is Rx only and can be extremely hard to get a prescription for. I went to my derm and asked about my stretch marks, and she said that I could put the tretinoin on my stretch marks to try to heal them. (Better try than not, right?) Here's some more info here!  If you're restricting to 800 calories a day and aren't losing any weight, recheck your calories. People have a tendency to underestimate how many calories they've eaten. If you're not losing when you think you're on a calorie deficit, you're probably just not on one.

Picture 1  Picture 2  Picture 3 This is a few weeks old, taken after I actually was able to poop.  Sorry for the tmi, by the way. A huge part of my dysphoria comes from being constantly bloated from constipation."
proED,3csfwl,FoofyFoof,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:37:55 2015 UTC,"Constipation is a function of lack of dietary fat. Eating more fat will, of course, not help you meet your goal weight, but it will get rid of the constipation.  You might try eating more fat two days in a row out of four and seeing if you prefer the lack of bloating to the weight loss.  It will slow your progress, but you might look better overall.   I've also found that a colon massage will help. Your colon runs down the left side of the front of your body from your rib cage to about the height of your belly button, but directly underneath your rib cage. Look online for diagrams.   What you can do is to take your right hand, make a fist, and then roll your fist over your colon, from the highest part to the lowest, like if you were rolling your fist over the keys of a piano to play then one at a time. Push hard. Start at the bottom and roll towards the bottom, then move up and roll towards the bottom again, etc. You'll need to do this several times.  You can also make circular motions with your fingertips.  Push pretty hard, but not enough to hurt.   That will losen everything and pull it away from the walls of your colon so it can move down.   An enema is also really effective and they are cheap."
proED,3csfwl,toastedenigma,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:14:42 2015 UTC,"mineral oil will help with the constipation! It coats the G.I. tract making it easier for stool to be expelled, without the physical pain from over using laxatives. It is found in the laxative or stomach problem area of the drugstore.  I would take maybe a capful of the mineral oil every morning and that would help ensure that I was able to go later in the day.

It's natural to retain water from time to time. The higher number on the scale doesn't mean you gained any body fat.   Last night I gave myself permission to have a cheat meal. I normal eat 900 a day but yesterday I ate 1,600 extra calories. So 2,500 all together. When I woke up this morning I felt gassy and bloated but I didn't gain any weight. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. Just remind yourself that it's important to indulge every once in a while :)"

I would suspect your drinking on the weekends is where you're making up most of your calories that you're cutting during the week... especially if you mix your booze with pop or juice. Even if you don't, booze is crazy high in calories (1 rum and coke is like 300 calories!), but that's not the part of all this that concerns me (although I can totally understand why you'd be frustrated).    Going to be blunt, I think that eating as little as you do while drinking on weekends is a recipe for disaster, even if everything has been fine until now. It would be incredibly easy for you to become WAY more intoxicated than you meant to from much less booze than an average person. I really, REALLY, hope you're being incredibly careful. Drinking on an empty stomach can be bad, but drinking on an empty (and shrinking) system can be even worse. Not only are you more susceptible for alcohol poisoning, but also at risk of unscrupulous people taking advantage of you as well.   I don't really drink anymore. I used to, and when I did regularly is when I was at my biggest. Some things you can do to cut down on the calories consumed by drinking are to have drinks mixed with water/soda water/slice of lemon (gin and tonic, vodka soda water and lime ect).   I honestly think you should just drink less altogether. It would help you to get off this plateau, save you money, and would be a responsible personal choice. I'm not saying to stop drinking altogether... but at 300cal's a pop (even just plain vodka is like 100cals per shot), the drinks kind of cancel out your restricting. Add that to the risks you take by drinking too much right now, and I just dont see the benefits. It's still fun to go out and dance without drinking, and then you get the added benefit of calories burned while dancing."

I always make sure to either mix rum or vodka with diet soda or seltzer. Never ever EVER regular coke or juice. Could that still be a contributor?  You are right though, I should definitely drink less. I eat more when I drink, and if I don't I barf. Ick. I never thought about how that might be bc of restriction.  I also really appreciate your concern, that's very kind of you. Thank you for helping me look out for myself! Thank you for the advice :)"
proED,3cl6ah,1YearWonder,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:04:54 2015 UTC,"Right on! Glad to hear you play safe and keep it sensible. I do think that if you're hovering at around 600cals of food consumed, that it's the booze keeping you on this plateau. Even if you just had 3 shots of straight vodka, that's half your daily calories in just booze right there.   Remember, the reason that we feel like we do when we drink is because of the 'toxifying' affect of alcohol, and because of the time it takes your liver to scrub that out of your bloodstream. If you have food in your stomach, it helps to lengthen the amount of time it takes for the alcohol to be absorbed into your bloodstream, which dilutes the effect a little bit by spreading it out over a longer period of time. Basically, the solids in your stomach soak up the booze, and solids take longer for your stomach to break down than liquids. If your system is empty and you dump a bunch of booze in there, your body can become overwhelmed. That's alcohol poisoning, and let me tell you everything about that is awful... the experience, the treatment, the recovery... its all awful. Best to avoid.   Take care. :)"

Are you including whatever you're drinking on the weekends in your total calories consumed? Alcohol is a huge contributor to going over your max, and quickly. Carbs stick to you like glue and alcohol can cause bloat.  Starvation mode is a myth. As long as you continue eating at a deficit, you will inevitably lose weight. If you think you're only consuming 600 calories a day for a consistent amount of time, and have yet to see expected results, then recalculate your calories and recalculate them again. Do you use a food scale to measure your serving sizes? Are you snacking on anything ""small"" like a marshmallow here or there without tallying those calories? Are you drinking any beverages, alcoholic or otherwise, without including those calories in your count?"

I don't think I completely understand it (I'm bad with numbers). I think a food scale is a good idea. I think I estimate far too often rather than measure stuff out. But could that really make that big of a difference? Even if I'm eating closer to 1,000 calories, can I still lose?  Sorry for all the questions, the research I do never seems to help much since everything is so specific to different people. I really appreciate the help you have given me!"
proED,3cl6ah,Virgil1414,2,Wed Jul 8 20:09:44 2015 UTC,"Are there any resources that go into the deficit more?   I'm not sure I entirely understand this question. I agree with /u/1YearWonder that drinking on the weekends is likely what's keeping you on your plateau.   I think I estimate far too often rather than measure stuff out. But could that really make that big of a difference?   Yes, it can make a huge difference. You should try a few things over the next 2 to 4 weeks and see how it affects your plateau: First, eliminate the booze altogether. This isn't permanent-- think of it as an experiment. Drink ice water with lemon instead of booze. Consider it a challenge to yourself and remember, the booze will still be there in a few weeks. It's not going anywhere. Why do you need to drink it today or this weekend? Are your friends depleting the earth of its booze supply? Is this your last chance ever to get a buzz? Have you suddenly forgotten how alcohol tastes or makes you feel?  No.  Seriously, just try drinking water instead of booze for 2 to 4 weeks and tell me how it goes.  Secondly, commit to actual serving sizes. Whatever you're estimating needs to be measured-- either in a measuring cup or by weighing it out. You don't even have to do this for an extended period of time. Just try it for a few days or a week, and measure EVERYTHING. Compare it to the amount of food you've been estimating as a serving size. Is it the same as your concept of a serving size? More? Less? This is particularly interesting for different types of food. Liquids, like milk and juice as well. Do you add things to your tea or coffee? Measure it out. Add it to your calories per day. You will really quickly get an accurate count of what you're putting into your body. And hey, if it's 600 calories, that's great! If it's 1,000 or more? Now you know why you've been the same weight for a year. Don't subscribe to fat logic."

Sometimes how your body feels can be deceiving, so you want to make sure you're not making mistakes in calculation.  One of the ways I break plateaus is to eat normally for a day. That usually helps. After the initial gain from water weight and food weight, you'll drop further.   Also, your BMI is 15.9, so at the point, it becomes difficult to lose more or to lose as quickly as you had."

When I was in high school, not working out, naturally thin and high metabolism, yadda yadda my thighs were still bigger.  I became very anorexic, down in the 90s and still, my thighs seemed to me to be bigger proportionately than they should be.  How much of that was true and how much was body dysmorphia I don't know, but all the women in my family just have bigger thighs.  I have come to terms with the fact that my stomach can be flat, my collar bones and hip bones protruding and everything else satisfactory to me, but my thighs will never be like two finely slender twigs.

I think that in distance running, your body will naturally slim down your legs because it's not effective to run far if there is a lot of mass on your legs.   If you have big thigh muscles, which a lot of people actually do have, eating at a large deficit combined with long distance running should slim them down."

Also, while people often say that you can't ""catch an ED"", the truth is, you can develop disordered eating, and browsing /r/proED can make you want to engage in disordered behavior. I mean, this is simplifying things a lot, but I always like to think that the difference between an anorexic and a normal crash dieter is that an anorexic lasts longer on the crash diet while the normal dieter gives up.

How long have you been counting calories with the purpose of losing weight and have you lost any weight in this time? You should be losing even on 1200 kcal especially if you are working out. Are you weighing out all your foods?  You are already restricting and should be losing weight if you are counting your calories correctly.
proED,3cisjg,pihapuu,2,Wed Jul 8 08:27:51 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest getting a food scale so you can accurately count your calories. (Mine just arrived yesterday, and I'm loving it!) Virgil is right when she says people underestimate their calories eaten, and overestimate their calories burned. I also realized that, one of the reasons why I was 'plateauing' was because of these 'hidden' calories. For instance, I'd go to Subway and get a chopped salad with chicken, spinach, lettuce, and tomato. Not that much; it's about 110-200 calories. However, I did not take into account the ranch dressing I was putting on, which had 145 calories per  gram! I put so much ranch on my salad that, my ranch costed a lot more calorie-wise than my salad. Definitely check your calories. Also, since you drink a lot of water, be sure to weigh yourself at the same time everyday, preferably after emptying your bowels/peeing. I've taken off two pounds after peeing and then weighing myself. Not doing so will be more inaccurate and may make you think you're not losing weight, when you're just retaining liquid. Also, keep in mind that salty foods will make you hold more water weight!"

I bought a scale a few weeks ago though and I have yet to use it, so it's just been MFP guestimations, and then in recipes I make It'll say how many calories a meal is and I'll just enter those calories. And if i have a few extra bites of something here or there I'll do a quick add of a couple hundred calories, even if I think it was only 50 calories, just to be safe. And when I work out I know it could overestimate the calories so I log about 100 calories less than what it says I burned, again to be safe. About the vegan thing, I've been eating like this for many years now and actually I always have crave bread a lot. I'll just need to be tough and say no. I think I just must be eating way more than I think I am. Probably olive oil...I seem to incorporate olive oil every damn day. I'll make sure to weigh everything from now on, and avoid salt at all costs.

proED,3cguwj,AwwwwwSewerBunniis,4,Tue Jul 7 20:25:47 2015 UTC,"Welcome!  I think the first step you should take is eating on schedule. Plan exactly what you're going to eat for the week and follow it. If you've been binging a lot, you might not want to restrict anything below 800 since that might trigger a binge.   Once you get used to eating on schedule, you simply modify the schedule to eat lower calories.   Good luck! I think you can do this :)"

proED,3cguwj,ThinCutie,4,Tue Jul 7 22:39:18 2015 UTC,"BED is the most common eating disorder out there. I think a lot of people don't even know they suffer from it until they're put in a position where they no longer get the exercise they used to, and thus visibly see the changes.   And it sucks. Sounds like you've had an incredibly rough time. We have a lot of people and resources here, especially for those who binge! I have no doubt that you're capable of reaching your goal weight.   I'm sort of an 'all or nothing' type person (which I'm sure a lot of folks who binge can relate to), so I chose nothing. And I haven't binged over my BMR in 3 months. 'Out of sight, out of mind'. I stay very far away from food. Junk and fast food is already banned in my household, so it's much easier. I know some users and friends who have to deal with family bringing home their favourite junk food, which makes it much more difficult. Sugar is know to trigger binging, so be on the watch for that!   And lastly, welcome to the sub! These posts are totally acceptable, and encouraged, so don't worry."

proED,3cghv4,incerta,3,Tue Jul 7 18:55:11 2015 UTC,"Always plan. I've realized that binges are usually the result of failing to plan. If you start the day saying to yourself exactly what you'll eat and exactly how many calories that will be, then you should be able to avoid binging. You can even pre-log your food the night before, so that it feels more set in stone.   And yeah, mindless eating is not usually a good idea even if the food is healthy. A lot of obese people get fat by mindlessly eating sweets throughout the day, so be careful about that."

However, snacks are great for your blood sugar. It's all about balance. Plan your snacks instead of eating them without knowing.   A food scale helps, too.   My advice to you would be to eat super low cal foods, just to give you the impression you're snacking. Check out our tips wiki in the sidebar to see a list of suggested snacks."

You could talk to him about your goals and try to spin it off as like a fitness inspired goal and maybe you can encourage each other.

I have a strict rule to not eat three hours before bedtime, and my sleeping patterns are extremely irregular, so I'll play it safe. However, it causes me to go to bed hungry, sometimes with stomach pains. Therefore, I normally will eat a small fruit, like a medium sized banana, to boost up my energy before I go to my weight training class. I've noticed that, although I won't feel satisfied after the banana, the water I drink while working out helps me feel less hungry, so when I do eat my lunch after, I eat less than I normally would. If I felt like I didn't work out enough, I'll go to the gym around 6pm for an hour, mimicking a small fruit before the gym, and then a small meal based around protein after. (To keep my muscles!)  Sometimes, when I feel really incomplete with my workouts and it's closer to 9pm, I unfold my yoga mat and follow some of my real-time workout videos on YouTube.

I felt terrible about having them go to waste, so I hid the entire box in my room, and everyday I would give out as many as I could to my friends, or a homeless person asking for food. I was afraid of them going to waste because, since it was from the local bakery, I had no idea if it had any preservatives, and it was in open-air. If you try what Virgil suggested, maybe you can save the candy for one of your planned binges? Another thing I'll do is look at thinspo when I'm craving to motivate myself!

No amount of weight lost is ever enough (as you know). For me, it's like a math equation- I know if I restrict to this many calories, then I will lose this amount of weight in this amount of time.  I know I can manipulate the number to my choosing, so why not do it?   Deep down, I guess I want to believe that reaching a lower weight will make me happy even though I know this is not true."

BUT, I remember looking at those photos horrified, thinking I looked huge.

proED,3c11jx,sunshinechild,3,Sat Jul 4 04:00:40 2015 UTC,Your mind is messing with you. Probably because you're malnourished and tired. Try to maintain your weight for a while. Up your calorie intake very slowly so that you stay the same weight you are now. Maybe work out? I did that once and I actually felt better because I was more clear-headed and my body image got a little better too.   Just try for a little while to maintain and keep reminding yourself that you're underweight so there's no way you're not skinny.  You can pm me if you want.

Don't be put off by brands that are generic 'bodybuilding' stuff - as long as the nutrition labels check out, it's all good. The most common one you'll see is whey protein - soy protein powders exist too, for vegans.     1g of protein = 4 cals, so with the average scoop providing 20-25g protein (depending on brand) you're looking at 120-160 cals per serving, usually. The other calories come from additives, that's why some mass-gainer brands have only 25g protein but also 30g carbs, pushing the calories up.     I personally really like the SAN Metaforce (both Vanilla Almond and Rocky Road flavors) because it's lactose free, and I'm intolerant. I also loved Optimum Nutrition's 100% whey Rich Chocolate and Extreme Chocolate flavors.   My other protein staples: canned tuna in water, edamame (soybeans) and turkey ham/bacon.   p.s if you have a sweet tooth and money to burn, I'd recommend checking out Quest bars."

I'm on day 2 of a fast, and I hope to keep it going for as long as I can.   When I have a real bingeing episode, it usually takes at least one day for my body to bounce back, and sometimes it takes longer. It especially depends on how hard you were restricting prior to the binge, and for how long. My rigid restriction meant that I had real hell to pay after bingeing (my poor poor, slowed-digestion is still crying)."

That being said, I hope I never binge again."
proED,3br3z2,linkedhorizon,3,Wed Jul 1 14:03:57 2015 UTC,"I used to be bulimic and then AN B/P type so I don't consider something a binge unless it is a true binge...subjective loss of control, eaten in under an hour, eaten with the sole intent of being purged, and enough food that anyone would consider it a large amount. I used to binge on about 10,000 calories in an hour or less and then purge it. I've never not purged a binge and if I binge it is planned and I fasted for the rest of the day, so honestly my weight was always either stable or losing.  I haven't binged since Thanksgiving though, and before that it had been two years since I did my usual binge routine which would involve going to the store to buy a shit ton of food to purge. Instead of binges I just sometimes eat things that weren't in my meal plan and they go over what I wanted to eat by 200-600 calories. If I go over my calories for the day I don't usually gain weight unless I go over my calories for a couple days in a row, then I'll gain about two pounds for every few days of over-eating. Sometimes I go over my planned calories on purpose because as long as I only do it only once a week it actually helps me to break through plateaus.   Binges seem really really unappealing to me honestly. My stomach can't fit what it used to and because I used to be bulimic if I were to binge (I have tried because I missed the euphoria of it) I will get a panic attack and that makes the activity pretty much completely not tempting because it feels like hell. If I were to binge it would probably be because I was in a situation where I was forced to eat something. I would never binge and not purge it immediately after. Not a good way to live, awful actually because the more you purge the more likely you are to make a binge  a regular thing, but I just don't think I would ever be able to do that.

Food didn't taste good anymore and when I would try to binge I would get so anxious that I started having panic attacks. My diagnosis has supposedly been changed from bulimia to AN restrictive type so I don't know...I guess I just transitioned from one ED to the other. I do make sure to eat every day at least 300 calories. That helps. Restrict too much and your body will automatically want to binge. I also mostly eat food that is low calorie but very filling (huge bowls of 100 calorie or less soup) so even if I wanted to binge, I usually couldn't stomach it. Take vitamins. Don't avoid fats and proteins because they fill you up and the fuel burns slow.   But yeah..I wish I could give good advice. Its something that still confuses me. I just lost the craving completely. I'm afraid of binging or purging, so now I can't do it even if I wanted to. Don't completely deprive yourself but gradually decrease food so your stomach shrinks too much to binge, take vitamins, konjac fiber, lots of fluids, and vary your caloric intake so your body doesn't think its starving, and don't keep ANY foods around that are triggering for you. I only buy safe foods and I can't keep bready things around because I get hungrier when I eat bread. I also stopped eating foods that I used to binge on because I created an association with them and binges. I buy the same foods over and over and if I notice myself obsessing over a food that is around, I take a bite and then toss the rest. That one bite allows my brain to stop obsessing over that food and I am less likely to binge. Also remind yourself...that food isn't going anywhere. This isn't the last time you will have a chance to eat it before it disappears from the planet. There is no NEED for it. Sometimes I eat a bit of mustard too weird as that sounds...the savoriness sort of satisfies me and I'm not as hungry anymore. That's just what I have noticed for myself...everyone is different I'm sure, I wish you luck though. I never want to go back to those binges...they were an honest to god addiction. I did have to pretty much detox myself for a while. Not let myself b/p and it felt like hell for two weeks and then...became second nature. A new normal was established. Now I don't and can't really look back. A binge just seems tedious and anxiety provoking and awful to me. You just can't look back. Remind yourself that if you slip once it will be a downward slope so you can't do it. The same for purging. I try not to purge because purging and binging go hand in hand. One leads to the other."

I think crossover is actually really common with ED's, people seem to go back and forth between the two and I think most end up b/p'ing eventually. I was reading an article about that actually which was pretty interesting.  http://www.scienceofeds.org/2012/07/01/predictors-of-diagnostic-crossover/  Good luck though! It is possible to beat binging though...seriously I thought I would die before even coming close.

Participating here helps me to remember how important that goal is to me, and that I'm not the only one willing to use some relatively extreme tactics to get what I want, or the only one who loves feeling in control in this way. I also hope that others here don't judge me tooooo harshly for where I'm starting in the process of getting hotter this time around, but I also know that even if they are, it's probably not as harsh as how I'm judging myself, and I try to be at peace with that judgement and just let it help motivate me!"

I also felt incredibly guilty because it felt like I started it for him by being so intense about my own food habits and weight stuff. It's pretty rough, feel free to pm me if you want someone to talk to/commiserate with about it."

He was a lot bigger a couple years ago, not overweight but chubby, and that sparked him to start restricting to lose weight. And I mean he does look a lot better than when he was chubby, for sure. But he doesn't like that his stomach has a bit of pudge, but if he were to just do weight training and build muscle to tone himself up, I don't think he'd feel the need to restrict as much as he does.  I hate pointing any of this out to him though cause I feel like a total hypocrite lol. He doesn't know about my past/current issues with food. He knows I've wanted to lose weight for a while, and he's been encouraging and everything which is nice (better than having to hide it and always hearing ""but you're not fat!!!"").

It seems like it could be weirdly helpful to have him not know about your good stuff, like it could help to reassure you that his possibly disordered habits aren't your fault. I guess in terms of advice I don't have much, my strategy in high school was mostly trying to both accept that recovery/a more traditional approach to eating had to come from him, not me, and trying to encourage the healthier ed habits like eating a lot of vegetables and drinking a lot of water, and letting him know that I liked his body as it was.

I feel like the intense exercise ""shocks"" your body into high gear, and the high-protein low-carb meal keeps your metabolism up. I also feel like getting plenty of sleep is really important—my body seems to hang on to weight if I haven't gotten a lot of sleep.  For example, I usually run and lift weights, so my body has become relatively used to these activities. But yesterday I went on a 25-mile  bike ride and I was absolutely DESTROYED by the end of it because I hardly ever bike. My legs were all floppy feeling and I was utterly exhausted. For dinner I had four BBQ ribs and some Brussels sprouts, and then ended up sleeping for nine hours.

Often times the rate of weight loss has to do with age (and therefore basal metabolic rate). If you're young, you can expect to be able to lose (and gain) very quickly. However, as you age your rates of gains and losses slow down.   Losing this quickly could be considered unhealthy by some, so I would suggest that you don't tell anyone if you're losing weight this quickly.

My advice would be to make sure that the food you do eat is rich in protein and fat, NOT carbs (carbs are the only macro we don't need). And make sure you get your electrolites. Drink enough water, eat enough salt. If you don't eat enough vitamins, then take a multivitamin. You should be fine.

Most of that was probably retained water anyway.   I've learned to accept things for the way they are, and I don't try to fight stuff like that. I know I have triggers, I've accepted them, and I move on from when they happen.  When I go on a first date, I tend to come back and binge a bit, and I had a first date this week. I still beat my goals.   Instead of fighting your triggers, accept them and keep stuff around you can binge on that has fewer calories. Carrots or popcorn will do for me. I can binge on it but it doesn't take me too far off track.  Since I know what my triggers are, instead of fighting them, I just prepare for them.   In any event don't beat yourself up for what you did. Everyone has triggers, they are part of life. 3 days later, you'll be back underneath what you were. It happens. Be prepared for the next one."

Most of the weight is water retention from carbs and salt, so that goes away in a few days.  I also read in an exercise science textbook that your brain cells can die if you're in a high stress environment and they don't have enough glucose, so its probably a safe reaction to stress to get hungrier."

Perhaps just taking the time to do this can help mitigate some of the pressure to purge. You might also want to explore what triggers a purge, and then actively try and avoid it.

My family and roommates think I'm the most Type A person they've ever met - even when I was in recovery my room during inpatient was spotless and decorated like a catalogue (my version of sticking it to the man?). I make lists like crazy and I think that's why dieting apps become so addictive for me.  I also tend to have my life more together and tightly wound when I'm in the middle of a long Ana streak, but the second I binge (even a little) I feel like a slob and a mess. Interesting."
proED,3b9zd6,Ariana_Rex,3,Sat Jun 27 12:16:50 2015 UTC,"I'd say no.   While I do like my things nice and neat, I tend to be messy at times and neat at times.   I have ADHD, so growing up my grades were C's, D's, and F's, until middle/high school where they started to get better. (Because of ADHD, I'm also very impulsive and not too patient.)  I'm a perfectionist that never achieves perfection.   However, I am an introvert (and a very serious one at that).  I'm both confrontational and non-confrontational depending on the situation and who I'm dealing with.   So all in all, I'd say stereotypes are just that: stereotypes."

proED,3b9zd6,NinjaButler,2,Sat Jun 27 09:07:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that either applies or that I even fit neatly into either diagnostic category. My diagnosis had been binge/purge type anorexia for almost a decade and now it is restrictive type. So I guess...in theory...I should be a mixture of both traits since my behavior is essentially both anorectic and bulimic? I'm introverted, non confrontational, prefer calm and order in my life, but I am horribly disorganized and failed half my classes in school. I never identified with either stereotype completely."

proED,3b9t10,Klairvoyant,2,Sat Jun 27 04:34:49 2015 UTC,"For vodka- add in a packet or two of artificial sweetener. Sweetness makes alcohol taste less like shit, and as a bonus the zero-cal stuff is actually like 100x sweeter than sugar so you'll only need a little.  As for food, Get a few bags of plain frozen veggies (broccoli, brussel sprouts, squash, etc) and have one whole bag for dinner. Cheap, tasty, healthy, filling, and low cal!

I like mini Babybell mozzarella cheese as a snack, Laughing Cow cheese wedges, eggs and egg whites, canned fish (crab, tuna, salmon; all in water, not oil), turkey breast, romaine lettuce, cottage cheese, yogurt (okay, I bought it but haven't eaten it yet, lol), coffee, splenda, hummus.   Yeah, it's not too varied, but I really don't understand food or anything so it's sufficient enough.   I recently added back diet soda, but I limit myself to four cans a day, and I savor it slowly, in order to avoid bloating."

Also, if you can keep a separate cabinet for your food, do it! It's hard to see your roommates food and be triggered to break your streak, at least for me."

I also switched to drinking mostly red wine because a whole bottle is about 600 calories and I'll get full and drunk well before I finish a whole bottle and usually won't even want to eat. I knew ballet instructors telling girls to drink vodka because it makes you light...but I stick to red wine. Never gained or bloated from it.  I also keep mostly super easy things around for food...powdered soup packets like 45 calorie spring vegetable cup o soup, 35 calorie miso soup, 25 calorie wakame soup, miracle noodles, lots of frozen veggies, 100 calorie bags of popcorn, brazil nuts, rice cakes, coffee, light greek yogurt, and low fat cottage cheese. Those are pretty much my staples that I always have in stocked. Also shredded broccoli slaw...100 calories for a whole bag which will usually last me two days and newman's own 35 calorie sesame ginger dressing.   Also buy some ziploc baggies and prepare snacks for yourself. I always have bags filled with a portion of nuts or gummy bears or rice cakes or carrots. I like hummus but I use edemame humus instead because its lower calorie."

proED,3b9t10,AllHailTheGremlins,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:34:55 2015 UTC,"I tend to only buy fresh produce, eggs, coffee, and skim milk (for the coffee, otherwise I try to avoid too much dairy). There are some other odds and ends I buy, but those are the basics. I never keep any junk food in the house because I know I'll binge, but I also know I'll never stoop low enough that I'd take my roommates' food.  My usual dinner is cooking some kind of vegetable (like broccoli or zucchini) on the stove with just a little bit of olive oil and some fresh garlic cooked in.  If I have breakfast, it's just some instant oatmeal (I like sweet, so sometimes I put in splenda) or an egg (cooked in olive oil, not butter).  As for lunch, I usually meet up with friends at a dinning hall. I'll have tea and a small salad with balsamic vinegar (I avoid creme dressings most of the time). I don't like eating much around other people so this is usually the easiest part of the day.  I have issues with stress eating and binge eating so it helps a lot to not even keep junk food in the house. At least if I had a bad day and break, then I binge on low cal food and not chips and cookies.  Sometimes I have a hard time with affording ideal foods. I've had to go grocery shopping at The Dollar Tree before. That's a tough one, but my rule of thumb has always been vegetables first. Meat is a once in awhile treat if I can afford the calories. I also avoid high fat dairy (whole milk or butter) and wheat products (bread and pasta). I'm not successful at cutting them out completely (I've been struggling with binge eating lately), but I've realized that those are the most calorie dense foods in my own diet so I've tried to cut down. I have an especially hard time avoiding pasta, but that's mostly because I'm an awful cook and pasta is just so damn easy!"

So here is some advice to avoid binging/overeating.  Don't skip meals. When you go to eat again you'll often overeat end to being too hungry.   Make your first choice of food a very nutrient rich food such as broccoli. I like to melt a little butter into my broccoli. Very filling and healthy.   Make a daily habit to exercise for at least 30 minutes. I personally aim for 1 hour 45 minutes of running or biking hills. You will notice that your hunger will be a bit more stable.   Don't skip on fat. Fat is necessary for digestion of certain vitamins.   Learn what your body wants. After years of working on it, I've been able to tell what my body needs based on how I feel and what I'm craving.   And importantly, don't skip meals. Eating regularly keeps cravings at bay and you won't get crashes that lead to binging."

proED,3b95rp,LESBIAN_PRINCESS,2,Sat Jun 27 03:04:37 2015 UTC,"Try exercise if you binge. You also can't hold it against yourself if you do. Exercise will not only burn off a good portion, if not all, of what you ate AND will relieve stress/anger from your binge. Plus you can get pretty damn fit.   I've suffered from Anorexia, bulimia, binging for years and spent more time than I would like to admit in and out of hospitals. I know how horrible the isolation can feel, but there is support out there. If you're not ready to go find support, there are definitely people you can confide in.   Side note: more muscles you have the more calories you burn doing nothing. Which means you can eat a bit more without weight gain."

Try broccoli, a tablespoon of butter, and some salt. Maybe some Parmesan cheese as well. It'll be about 140 calories which is pretty nice. Be sure to include salt because that is most likely why your muscles ache. Don't skip on the butter. You need it to absorb and break down vitamin A and K. Without those you're going to get sick.   I know exactly how you're feeling. Your body is being pushed to its limits. You don't want to end up in the hospital because you can't even fight off a cold.

Try taking multivitamins so your body doesn't crave nutrients as much.   If you know you binge at certain times of the day, exercise during those times. (Because people rarely stop in the middle of working out to eat.)  Most importantly, get into the swing of things. Get a schedule and make it habit."

proED,3b7vrf,lurker546,12,Fri Jun 26 18:01:23 2015 UTC,"You don't meet the diagnostic criteria for anorexia, a term which is far too liberally bandied about.   You may have some kind of disordered eating, but that can't be determined without a doctor and honestly from your descriptions it sounds like you're just practicing a VLCL--a very low calorie diet. It's very possible to do that healthfully and for short term, and it doesn't mean you have a true eating disorder. And at 1,000 calories per day, you're not that far below the lower end of a healthy diet (~1200 calories recommended).   The purging is a little more concerning but it does not sound like you make a habit of it. I know this is /r/proED but if you want to lose weight, restriction has far, far, far fewer health complications than bingeing/purging, which can severely affect your teeth, esophagus, and stomach long-term, causing everything from dental disintegration to Mallory-Weiss Syndrome. But again, it doesn't sound as if you've made a habit of it.  My advice: ignore your coworker. It doesn't sound like she has any idea what she's talking about. If you want to lose weight, set a daily calorie goal you think you can stick to that puts you at a deficit; it sounds like you've already done that. Record everything via a program like MFP or LoseIt. Again, 1000 calories per day is not very extreme, particularly at your weight (if you were severely underweight and active, it might be). I would even venture to say that if it works for you, it is healthier than remaining at your current weight. I'd just advise you to try to get enough nutrients in the food you do eat--protein in lower calorie options like grilled chicken or broiled fish, plenty of low-calorie vegetables, etc."

(I find this to be the easiest option. Coffee keeps me full until around lunch time.)  2) Lie. Tell them you had a huge breakfast, and/or you plan a large dinner. Trivialize it. Make them feel paranoid or ashamed to have doubted you.  3) Spread your calories out over the day so you can eat 3 meals of lower calories to come out to your same total of 1,000 calories.  4) Have something for lunch that is absolutely negligible in the calories department. What I love to do is have a pot of broth, which takes only about 2 bouillon cubes to be tasty. Those are ~ 5 calories each. Tell your coworkers you're eating soup. Unless they're really up in your business they're not going to snoop around in your bowl questioning you about its lack of contents..."

Buy frozen chicken breasts and only cook one at a time--going back for seconds is a hassle when it takes 25 minutes to cook one in the oven. Get lots of fibrous veggies. They're filling and low-calorie: brussels sprouts, broccoli, green beans, salad greens. Use cooking methods that don't require oil or which require only a tiny bit of spray: boiling/steaming/broiling/sauteeing (you can use other things for flavor here like low-sodium soy sauce). A nice sauteeing option is 1/4 tsp butter, soy sauce, and 1/4-1/2 tsp Splenda. Fill yourself before the meal with either water or broth (again, it's very low-cal) or both."

On my account, I put that I wanted to lose 2 pounds a week, and it gave the regular old '1000-1200' calorie minimum. There's no way I'd lose 2 pounds a week with that, and I suspect you wouldn't either.   Your BMR is ~1150 calories. One pound is 3500 calories.   If you were eating 1100, that'd only be a deficit of 50 calories a day. (50 * 7 == 350) That is not a two pound deficit. You'd still need to lose another 3150.  Again, you probably lose more, because that's just your BMR, and I didn't include an activity level.   MFP has to, for legal reasons, put 1000 calories or more as your minimum intake.

When I wasn't trying as hard to lose weight and I didn't feel the insane pressure of the ED voice in my head pounds would just drop! Young metabolisms I guess.  Have you started taking measurements? When I reach plateaus (currently in the worst one I've ever experienced) I measure the smallest part of my waist (the part that folds when you bend over), hips, bicep, forearm and thigh and there would always be incremental changes there that made me feel better. Just motivation. So I guess that's not really a tip, but maybe it will give you peace of mind.  However, your stats look incredible!"

proED,3b1w9v,foobar5678,2,Thu Jun 25 15:26:58 2015 UTC,"It's simple physics. Any deficit will result in loss. I read this one theory that plateaus are caused when your body burns the fat but starts storing more water to compensate. So even though the number on the scale doesn't change, you're still burning fat. Then after some time it gives up on storing the extra water and you lose a bunch of a numbers of the scale really quickly."

A lot of Asians are Apple shaped meaning the fat gathers around their mid section when they gain. Waistlines larger than your hips is a good indication odd obesity and your likelihood for heart disease and diabetes. In Asian countries a different BMI chart is used with lower BMI measurements for the overweight and obese criteria. However that chart still has a BMI of 18.5 as the low mark for health. Considering the amount of small boned  adults with BMIs of 17~18.4, I'd say it's incorrect.   I've been <17.7 BMI my entire adult life and I'm 33 right now. That doesn't mean I'm toned or in good shape. Just that I have small boned and like many Asian women I lack boobs and butt.

I mean, the difference is marginal. A BMI change of 20.3 to 20.6 doesn't tell much. Bodyfat percentage, measurements, AND BMI all paint the pciture of how we look.  People get too caught up on the numbers. For me, I like to use my measurements as an indicator of weight loss. I used to weigh myself 2+ times a day when I was first sucked into this, but now I haven't weighed in weeks. There is just so many fluctuations and variable to take into account  that the number can be misleadingly high (or low)."

Try to get as much of low cal foods like vegetables as possible, and eat that somewhat enthusiastically, comment on how delicious the vegetables are. 2) don't ever bring up food amounts, but if they ask, rotate between different answers like ""I ate a really big lunch"" (potentially describe a fake meal), ""I'm just not hungry, I don't know why,"" or even just laugh it off and say you filled up on veggies/salad or whatever low cal thing you ate. 3) like u/Virgil1414 said, keep the emphasis on health and talk about how great/healthy you feel! Also a lot of people don't think that people who restrict a lot can enjoy food without binging/hating themselves so the more emphasis you can put on how tasty/enjoyable the relatively small amount of food you're eating is, the less suspicious they're likely to be! Just don't be too over the top. Good luck, it sucks how difficult parents can be about this kind of thing."

It's so easy to make people believe that you're on a new healthy eating-routine, especially since a lot of people are not very knowledgeable about what actually constitutes as healthy food.  Additionally, creating evidence that you've eaten is a great idea, if at all possible.

You mention that your family eats dinner pretty late: you can tell them that eating heavy meals at that time makes you feel awful, you can't sleep well afterwards and wake up bloated, so you'd rather eat dinner earlier. That way, you will eat dinner alone and will be able to control your meal better. When you do it couple of times, comment on how better you feel. This is what I did and now I eat dinner separately, usually even skip it, and even though my parents suspect I have an ED they don't say anything other than ""have you had dinner?""

But when I do find myself with food I don't want, I try to give it to other people. For example, a few weeks ago my downstairs neighbor gave me an entire coffee cake because it was buy one get one free at the store. That was very thoughtful of them, but I sure as hell wasn't going to eat it, so I gave it to a friend I was hanging out with that night. So it was win-win: the cake didn't get wasted, I did a nice thing for a friend, and I didn't have to eat it. So now I just try to give away food that I don't want to eat."

Drink lots of caffeine, it helps suppress your appetite.  Find out what causes you to binge. Had a bad day? Finally started losing weight?"

I mean, I can chug 2 bottles of water back-to-back and still feel the urge to binge 15 minutes later.  I do need to drink more caffeine.  I love coffee, but I'm always afraid that black coffee has hidden calories that I'm not counting.  I would rather just not binge and not look into it."

That is step 1.   2 bottles of water   I don't know what that is, but I usually drink 1L of water when I have a snack. You feel really full after.  Another thing you should try is make a rule for yourself that you can only binge on junk after eating something healthy. Have a salad (no dressing or other crap, just vegetables!). The point isn't to enjoy it, it's just a speed bump before the junk food. Except when you get to the junk, you won't be hungry anymore (or as hungry).  It also sounds like you're not eating enough protein. Chicken and turkey breast are low calorie high protein. Fills you up and satisfies any cravings."

I eat a ton of everything and just keep eating until there is so much pressure on my heart that I force myself to vomit.  I don't crave anything in particular.  It's the fact that I'm putting something in my mouth and eating it that I'm under the compulsion to do.  I just lose all sensibility and just cram everything in my mouth.

You need to find a way to convince yourself binging is wrong. Logging is just a suggestion- I used to look at pictures of myself when I was fat. Before you binge, take a good hard look at yourself in the mirror. If you don't like what you see, that should motivate you not to binge.    I can chug 2 bottles of water back-to-back   Well, that's not even a third of the minimum you should be drinking in the first place, so try more. I've heard that lemon/ice water helps some people more.    has hidden calories that I'm not counting.   Well, if you've looked up the nutrition for it, and log it, I don't see how it's hidden? Use a zero cal sugar supplement, and measure your milk. If you're really scared, over-estimate the calories.   A normal cup of coffee:   1 cup (250 ml) - 1 calorie  2 tablespoons of sugar - 32 calories  1/4 cup (60 ml) Milk, 2% fat (that's a lot of milk for coffee!) - 31 calories   That's 62 calories, if I'm being generous."

I went in with a mindset of ""I can eat absolutely anything I want, but I have to own up to it"". I saw my binges, I saw the difference between good weeks and bad, and the binges got smaller.

Not to mention that I'm too short for runway/fashion modeling, don't have enough retail appeal for commercial modeling, I have way too much cosmetic surgery to go through before I can even think of make-up/face modeling, don't have the dimensions for lingerie/swimwear, and I'd just end up scammed if I started boudoir/alternative modeling.

I went from an EU size 38 to 32 (size 0 in the US I think) and because of vanity sizing even that size is too big sometimes. But I've found that the only things you really have to substitute when you get thinner are every type of trousers; jeans, shorts, etc. For me they're the only things that REALLY have to fit (I like skinny jeans), so when I got thinner I only bought two new pairs of jeans, one blue and the other black, for less than 10 dollars each. I'd say you should only get some new shorts and jeans, if you like them skinny: check when the sale season starts and tour the cheapest stores. Also check the children's section, as /u/ThinCutie said, for cheaper items in smaller sizes.  Good luck! :)"

A cheap pair of jeans in Women's sizes start at $30. A regular priced pair of jeans in Junior's sizes start at $14, and I can usually get them during a sale and nab 'em for $10.

Along with:    3 litres of water  workout  avoid carbs  avoid sodium    Everyday.   That way, your BMR and TDEE will still be high enough to have a decent deficit- how much you eat directly relates to your metabolism, and consequently your BMR (which makes it easier to gain weight in the long run).

That's what I do a lot of the time because I am beyond the point of pretending for the benefit of other people and eating out of obligation. I bring my own pre-packaged safe food with me and if anyone asks I just say I have a special diet because of health reasons. Its awkward, people find it odd, but I get to make it through the day without ripping my hair out or purging.   Whatever you do, just don't make the mistake of fasting all day.

I think losing just ~10 lbs and focusing on toning your body is what will gice you the results you want. The main difference I see between you and your thinspo is body composition. You are at a small size/low weight already, but you may look larger than your bmi suggests because of your body fat %, not your weight. You could probably even stay at your current weight and focus on changing your body composition instead. It makes a huuuuge difference."
proED,3afnxy,0hBaby,2,Sat Jun 20 06:25:16 2015 UTC,"My current work-out is all core and lower body. It's been little over a week, though, so I haven't seen drastic results yet.   Do you think sticking to HIIT might help?"
proED,3afnxy,Rapugzel,3,Sat Jun 20 06:29:21 2015 UTC,"You'll definitely need to be consistent and give it some time in order to see drastic results. But it helps that youre already so small, so usually the progress shows much sooner than on larger people. As for HIIT, that will burn fat, but prolonged aerobic exercise is ideal. However, if maintaining a super high heart rate for a longer period of time feels significantly harder to you, stick with HIIT instead. It'll be easier and more effective in the long run if youre not feeling the prolonged intensity.  You wont be able to build much muscle if you dont plan your meals around your workouts. Go with mostly simple carbs (fruits, white bread, etc.) and a bit of protein 1 hour-30mins before your workout, and lots of protein and more simple carbs within an hour after your workout. And if your workout exceeds 1 hour, you should try and get in some more carbs before continuing. Without eating food at the correct time, you'll likely not gain as much muscle and end up burning muscle along with bone mass from malnutrition during your workout. So, essentially, whatever youre going to eat that day should be before and after your workout if possible. Good luck!"

proED,3adpkb,Shizzbee,6,Fri Jun 19 07:36:06 2015 UTC,"From someone who has to deal with binge eating almost daily:   1) Keep yourself surrounded with people (if you live with your family, for example: it's harder to binge when people might see you)   2) If nothing will distract you, force yourself to be distracted. Read a book and think ""I can't eat until I finish this chapter"" (then the next, the next, and the next until you don't feel like binging anymore)  3) When you do binge, write down how it feels on your phone or somewhere accessible. Read this when you feel hungry. You might also want to write down how it feels when you DON'T eat so you can compare.  4) Write a set of rules and read them constantly. One of mine right now is to drink at least 2 glasses of water during every meal (so that I will feel fuller), it might help you.  5) Chew gum all the time. I used to do this and it really worked. If there is something in your mouth you can't eat.  I hope some of these help. Keep strong!! <3"

proED,3adpkb,linkedhorizon,3,Sat Jun 20 09:06:16 2015 UTC,"The thing about binge-eating is that it can happen with any food, not just junk food.   As for what to do about, I recommend sitting down and writing out a meal plan. In addition, pick times you plan on eating and stick with them, eating smaller meals more frequently, if only to stave off that 'full' feeling.   It might also help to explore what triggers your bingeing. For example, I know that a change in my environment or strict regime makes me far more likely to binge (like visiting family, going on a trip, etc.), so I do everything I can to minimize these things.   The worst thing you could do right now is to constantly worry about bingeing. If you think you'll binge before you eat, and you continue to think about, chances are that you'll do it."

I restrict, purge, obsess, but I'm happy doing it- so it's not the same, right? Feels weird to say it. A lot of ED sufferers hate their bodies, which admittedly, I do as well, but I just feel like that's normal. A lot suffer from depression, or other mental disorders, which I can say in certainty I don't.   I like weighing myself. Seeing that number drop lower and lower. I feel good when I count my calories. When I'm extremly hungry is when I'm the most motivated. I love it. I love feeling like I'm starving, makes me feel super pretty. The best is when I feel faint, lets me know I'm doing something right.   I love eating less than 500 calories. I'm so happy when I see how low my carb intake is.

In places where obese people are few, skinny people don't look much different than the average person. Just because you're doing something bad for your health doesn't mean you have a disease. Were people who wore corsets also diseased? How about Kayan people who wear neck rings? Or investment bankers who work 100 hour weeks so they can make more money? When some people purge or count calories they think not of disease but of getting better jobs and finding more qualified spouses. So, to answer your question, only people who believe it themselves have eating disorders. And I would guess most skinny people don't think they're sick.

Therefore, anything you can do to boost the pH level of what comes up will reduce the damage to your throat and teeth.   Baking soda is a good thing because it has a pH of 8 and it's edible in small quantities and dirt cheap.  So drinking it before you purge will boost the pH level of the contents of your stomach. The only downside is that it can generate carbon dioxide gas, so start with a little.   A half teaspoon in water, and drink, then purge.   Afterwards,  you can then gargle with another half teaspoon and swish to neutralize the acid on your teeth, then spit it out.   Note that baking soda has drug interactions, so research the interaction with any medication you are taking or ask your doctor.   Note also that this doesn't make purging safe. It will make it a bit safer, but you'll still damage your teeth and throat, nothing will really avoid that.    You can try meditation apps to help calm you if you find yourself in the mood to binge and try to get control over your feelings. If it reduces the urge to binge, even a bit, it's worth it."

Instead of eating just my dinner I eat that AND the binge food.

You're not alone and definitely wouldn't be the first person to come back from this. It can be done, and it can be done at your age (which is truly, not that old.) You've taken the first step, which is acknowledging the problem and your own role in it.  I got caught in a cycle of over eating when I was in my early 20's, I got up to around 245lbs at my highest. The biggest part of regaining control over my body was really thinking about and identifying the situations in which I over-ate, and why I did it. Another thing was giving myself the freedom to say ""no"". I think we live in a society where we're encouraged to be agreeable, if someone offers you a slice of birthday cake, it's rude to say ""no"". When we do, we feel like we need to explain ourselves which gives an opening for others to cajole, argue, and weaken our position. Learning to say no, mean it, and be proud of myself for saying it helped a lot. There's so much freedom in ""no, I'm not hungry"" and ""no, I won't eat that."" Your age is a HUGE boon here, you are an adult, you have absolute authority over your body. You can say no, and barring an involuntary psych admit, no one can force you to do otherwise.   Restricting is good, but I would encourage you to watch your carbs. After I hit 245, I radically changed my macros in addition to calorie counting. I would very much recommend looking into r/keto and r/paleo. Obviously don't spend your days eating scads of bacon, but the basic principles can be applied to a calorie restricted diet. I went from 245lbs to 155lbs in about 6 months. The only time my weight has bumped back up, such as currently, is because I became lax on my carb intake.

They don't ""up your metabolism"", or ""burn fat"", they just cause you to be less hungry.   That said, stick to tea and coffee before you start any appitite suppressant.

I still had a thigh gap, even at my largest (130 lbs, which gives me a BMI of 19.8).   I'd say for certain, a BMI between 15-17 should get you a thigh gap. Again, it's dependent on your bone structure, it's your hip bones that decided where/how big it is.   Lean muscle also helps.

proED,39uul7,Mikeyt83,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:04:47 2015 UTC,"Boca burgers are soy based. Unfortunately all beans have a very high carb content, so while the vegan black bean burgers are better tasting in my opinion, and have somewhat equitable calories, their carb content is higher.   I usually get the vanilla plant fusion, and I'd give it an 8/10. It dissolves into water without too much issue, and I think the taste is pretty good as far as protein shakes go. I like mine better with lots of ice.   Thanks for this thread! I keep wishing that there would be a low carb vegan subreddit, but I just don't think enough people keep those kinds of eating habits."
proED,39uul7,Mikeyt83,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:33:43 2015 UTC,"Okay. So here's my go-to when I absolutely have to eat something:  1/2 small to medium head of cabbage (rough chopped bite size pieces) 1/2 medium yellow onion (fine chopped) 1/2 tbsp. vegetable oil Pinch of salt Black pepper to taste Cayenne pepper Red pepper flakes  Basically chop and sautée onion until starting to get translucent. Add some black pepper. Stir. Add cabbage. Stir. Add salt, pepper, and cayenne to taste. Let cook on medium heat for awhile, stirring occasionally. If the liquid appears to dry up, add some water, which will also help steam the cabbage at the same time. Keep doing this until cabbage is meaty and tender but not mushy. Then remove from heat and let set in cooking pot. Remove to sealable container and seal while still warm. It helps the cabbage to keep cooking and getting even tastier. Then refrigerate for future eating.   I'll add a picture later but this makes enough for at least 3 meals. All in all this clocks in at around 170-200 calories and 16-17 net carbs if you ate the entire thing which would be difficult to do.   Also, I like to add a chopped carrot in for another 25 calories and about 4.5 net carbs, but it's an excellent source of vitamin A. You can also add a little hot sauce. And you could think about using nutritional yeast flakes instead of salt. It would add another 20 calories to the total but only 1 net carb, 0 grams of sodium, a lot of flavor, and tons of vitamins, especially the b vitamins.   Again, don't freak out about the calories. This is enough for like 3-4 filling meals, keeps well, and tastes good at any temperature (I don't microwave either)."

This dish has really helped me not miss food on fasting days. Also, it helped me bust through my last plateau, and I've lost 4 pounds in the last three days. Woo woo!!! LOL.

I used to be really skinny in my teens and early twenties. 5'9"" and 135 as a guy. For me it was the perfect weight. But then I got into a dysfunctional relationship and gained like 70 pounds over 4 years. Got out of the relationship in January of this year. Since January, I've lost a little over 40 pounds of it using ADF, switching mainly to a whole food plant-based diet, and moderate calorie restriction on feeding days. And there was a good 1-1.5 months during finals (law school), where I stopped dieting completely and just ate whatever. So yeah, I'd say it works well. Over the course of the semester, I went from a size L shirt (pushing XL) and size 36 pant (probably really a 38) to now a size M shirt (almost back in a S . . . yay) and a size 33 pant (probably a 32 by now but I just wear belts so I don't have to buy clothes until I get closer to my goal). I've still got another 25-35 pounds to go before I'll feel super comfortable again, but I haven't been this happy in a LONG time or felt this hot and sexy. LOL. I get that it's not for everyone, but it does help if you accidentally binge one night because those extra calories are spread over the fasting days where you didn't eat anything, so over time it kind of negates the damage a bit.

But I am also a biochemistry and biology double major and if there's anything I can contribute its that you really should just drink water steadily. Don't drink a ton at once even durning or after meals. Set out a water goal (I.e. I want to drink X ozs today) and then spread it out. Don't get focused on sodium or something just stay under or at the general healthy guidelines for the day (MFP app will tell you how many mg that is) and then just drink a healthy amount of water (I like to drink 8 full glasses at around 8ozs each minimum). Sodium won't make you bloat as long as you stay around your healthy daily amount. And remember sodium is very very important for brain function. It is vital so please don't cut it out of your diet or think that it is some evil molecule. It really is crucial In the right amounts so make sure to eat the right amount and take a multivitamin containing potassium to help brain function even while restricting/fasting. Mineral water can have decent amounts of sodium without all the calories. So this is a good alternative to eating foods to get nutrition.

She used to wear tonnes of pretty clothes, do her hair, her make-up, it always fascinated me, especially her being almost fifteen years my senior.   I grew up pretty thin, even thinner than her (I ate sparely as a child, and my mother refuses to user sugars, butters, and oils in her cooking). I'd get made fun of being skinny sometimes, but it never really bothered it (pretty validating, to be honest).   Everyone called me thin and skinny, except for my sister. She'd grab my stomach, and call it babyfat. She'd say I'm too fat to wear certain clothes. I wasn't allowed to wear make-up, or do my hair, or she'd call me slutty.   I was upset, because I grew up idolizing her, and what she got to do. And then when I was old enough to do it, she'd shit on me for it.   I cut contact with her last August for a lot of reasons. I was really happy. However, I realized that I didn't just want her out of my life, I wanted to prove her wrong. In the last week of April, I cut my calories to 700 a day max, and exercised everyday. Since then, I've lost 17 lbs. I don't care what it takes, but I'll get to my goal weight. I'll be thinner than she ever was. No one will ever be able to call me fat."

She crossed a lot of boundaries in my life, and has put a huge strain between my parents and herself.

It's so much shorter than typing out anorexia), or at least a very strong predisposition. I remember in 2nd grade I'd try to test how much self control I had by going as long as I could without food. I was always jealous of my super skinny friends and their tiny wrists especially.   In 5th-6th grade I became an emotional eater, I was never truly overweight and I never really binged but I'd be unable to stop myself from eating 4+ slices of cake in a day if it was there, and I had digestive issues constantly from eating so much crap. Getting fat along with other personal struggles turned my eating on it's head.  In 7th grade I started dieting, and getting thinner just became an addiction."

(I remember my drama teacher making comments about my weight, as if the bullying from other kids wasn't bad enough.)

proED,39n2in,skinnypod,3,Sat Jun 13 07:53:41 2015 UTC,"I was a chubby kid, then a chubby teenager, then a depressed and anxious teenager. The anxiety made me lose weight, but I couldn't enjoy it at the time. Then I started SSRIs which made me not-depressed but also very hungry. I've been through several medications, and they all made me fat, but they all helped with depression and anxiety. When I come off them, I get skinny, but I also go crazy.   In the process of gaining and losing and gaining weight, I discovered LiveJournal and Proanorexia, although if I hadn't, I still would have ended up in the same position - I felt stupid and ugly and helpless and lonely.   I've never enjoyed restricting. I've never liked being hungry. I wish I could. I do like being slim. At some point, I 'discovered' purging. I told myself I'd only do it in emergencies. It's been three or four years since then, and I can't remember the last time I went a whole day without purging.   It sounds like a cop-out, but I really do believe that I wouldn't have developed an eating disorder if I hadn't gotten so fat. I see a lot of people talking about how their families are very thin-focused, very judgemental, very appearance-based. My family is the opposite; warm and caring and accepting. But, despite being very smart people, my parents didn't know much about nutrition until fairly recently, so they just repeated what they had been told as children - eat everything on your plate, mashed potatoes (with butter and salt) are healthy because they're vegetables, running is bad for your joints.   I have always been a sugar addict. It's actually been pretty humiliating at times. If there was an Alcoholics Anonymous for sugar, I would have joined years ago. My parents tried to limit how much sugar we ate; we always found a way around it.   I have never been a real consumer of pop culture. I don't read fashion or lifestyle magazines (they bore the crap out of me). I'm not interested in what 'society' thinks women should look like. I'm not interested in what 'the media' has to say about my body. I don't follow trends. That whole world is just not what I'm into. What drives me is deeper than that. I find it insulting when well-intentioned people blame the media for eating disorders. It implies that I'm so impressionable, so vapid, so shallow and desperate for attention that I would risk my life to conform to an arbitrary standard. I am risking my life, but not for such obvious reasons. I want to be free."

I agree that blaming models and celebrities for inspiring EDs is unfair and insulting to people with EDs.  Addiction to sugar seems difficult. Did you find a way overcome your addiction?  Eating, for the most part, is a family thing. I think that's something people without EDs don't quite realize. We control some of what we eat but for the majority of family life, the person who cooks makes the decisions about nutrition.   Restricting seems like an acquired taste (no pun). One gets use to the feeling of hunger and welcomes it. Ive always found purging to be harder, so I'd be like, ""If I eat this, I'd have to purge, so I'm not going to eat this.""  EDs are weird in that they promise freedom through enslavement. Don't get me wrong, I hope for freedom, but I'm not sure I'll acquire it. I sometimes wish I were a normal dieter - the ones on /r/loseit who actually get freedom after weight loss."

proED,39li6w,knocksondoors,7,Fri Jun 12 15:56:58 2015 UTC,"Let's calculate:    2 lbs of weight loss a week == a deficit of 7000 calories a week. Your BMR == 1262 calories a day. BMR - caloric intake == 262. 262 * seven days a week ==  1834.   That's a deficit of only 1834 calories. That's ~ a quarter of what your deficit should be to lose 2 lbs a week.   Now, don't be discouraged- I didn't calculate your exercise deficit into it, it's probably much more. However, I also didn't adjust your BMR based on your activity level (one, because I can't rightly say what it is, two, that would make it higher).  So, all of those ""you can lose 2lbs a week healthily if you stay above 1000 calories!"" are really only for people with a high BMR. They hardly apply to those with a BMI in the healthy range, and especially not for us in the 18.5 and under range. Y'all need to start adding a bigger workout into your routine if you want to see big changers (cardio and HIIT are recommended).   /u/Knyburg has great advice for a plateau (the controlled binge always works for me- so does the restricting). Just remember to keep your water intake to 3 litres or more!  Edit: Just 'cause I like math, let's calculate how many calories your burned from exercise!    2 lbs of weight loss a week == a deficit of 7000 calories a week. Your BMR == 1262 calories a day. Your BMR with exercise (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week) == 1262 * 1.55 == 1956 calories a day BMR - caloric intake == 956. 956 * seven days a week ==  6692. Running 4 miles == ~ 325 calories.  325 * seven days a week == 2275 calories burned. 10,000 steps == 276 calories. 276 calories * 5 days a week == 1380 calories burned. 1380 (steps) + 2275 (running) + 6692 (diet) == 10, 347 caloric deficit every week (for your current weight/BMR).  10, 347 / 3500 == 2.95 lbs.   This is the basic math of how much weight you should be losing at your current exercise level, weight, age, gender, and height.   This doesn't take into consideration genetic or hormonal imbalances (which whilst rare, can change results by ~300 calories). It doesn't take into consideration your environment (stress level, sleep cycle, etc), or your water weight/ waste weight.   Make sure that you're logging all of your calories, and that you track all of your exercise accurately- it's very possible that you could be eating an extra couple hundred calories a day, and not notice, or that your heart rate isn't elevated enough when you run."

proED,39li6w,ThinCutie,2,Fri Jun 12 20:47:49 2015 UTC,"If I could throw in my 2 cents, I'm willing to bet a lot of it is water weight.   Unlike the math, weight-loss is not linear. While it's possible to calculate rates and outcomes, the timeline is a grey area. Some weeks you won't lose a pound, other times, you'll lose 3 pounds in one day.   Chances are, you're still on a plateau, so you've got to tough it out, and the results will come.   And insomnia sucks. ): I don't have all the science behind it, but it can hanker weight loss a bit. So, you'll reach your goal, it'll just be a bit tougher.   Good luck! If you have any other questions, feel free to ask! Lots of users here are more than willing to help."
proED,39li6w,FoofyFoof,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:38:30 2015 UTC,"You're double counting the exercise. Her BMR is 1262.  The 1956 is the 1262 BMR + an estimated amount for the exercise she's getting.    Your BMR never changes, they just add in an estimated amount for exercise so you don't have to calculate it precisely.   You'll notice 1956-1262 is about 700.  When you calculated her daily exercise,  it was 325+276 or about 600.  So the two numbers are pretty close.   What she needs to do is to make a food diary. Everything she eats needs to be written down and calories calculated. She could be underestimating. But people can have a wide variation in BMR . The number you get from mfp is an average. If she spent some time fasting or very low cal, her BMR could be as low as 900.  A food diary and an estimate of exercise calories is the only way to calculate BMR. If she's not losing, she doesn't have a deficit, so BMR will be whatever she's eating less exercise.   Your BMI does go up when you start exercising, but only for a few weeks, as your body adapts to the exercise. Some studies have correlated a higher BMR with muscles, but that was more recently debunked.  It's a little higher, but not much with muscle."

Not even if it's someone who goes on this sub a lot.   And ftr, the pedophile in the link isn't even clever about it. He comes across as uneducated, unintelligent, and sort of desperate. It's quite clear what his intentions are. I remember the creep from the other site I mentioned was like this too. I doxxed him later - got his name, address, credit card numbers, family history.

Either way, I agree with /u/DietSodaAddict on her height-I'm 5'3 and my current body looks like a mix of her second and third body pics.

proED,39gz90,DietSodaAddict,3,Thu Jun 11 21:16:47 2015 UTC,"Really, that short? I was guessing more around my height. She looks taller 'cause her legs are more in the photo.   In the first couple, you could see her shoulders, even her chin shadow, and most of her upper shins. In the last one, you can't see the top of her shoulders, and you can see almost down to her ankles."

proED,39i48r,frustrateded,6,Thu Jun 11 21:39:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think a 24 hour fast would be good. Usually the 2-3 days before a fast, you should be eating at around your TDEE (and exercising). You're practically setting yourself up for failure.  I would try going down to 1,000 calories (which is a perfectly fine amount for a woman) with exercise.  You will eventually lose weight if you do this, even if the scale doesn't show it at first.   I honestly wouldn't get too tied to the number on the scale. Even though weight seems like everything sometimes, it really isn't.  Also, once you get to a BMI below 18 or 19, weight loss is very, very slow. Be patient and don't be upset if the number doesn't go down for a few days."
proED,39i48r,DietSodaAddict,2,Fri Jun 12 00:16:24 2015 UTC,What is TDEE?
proED,39i48r,electric-bones,3,Fri Jun 12 02:26:52 2015 UTC,Total Daily Energy Expenditure. It tells you how many calories your body (roughly) burns in a day.  Here is a calculator for it   http://iifym.com/tdee-calculator/
proED,39i48r,DietSodaAddict,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:28:35 2015 UTC,Thank you.  I feel like my rant yesterday was because I had unrealistic expectations too early.  I need to just stop looking at the number and stay focused.
proED,39i48r,ThinCutie,3,Fri Jun 12 14:36:44 2015 UTC,"Four days isn't a lot! Some folks don't lose for a whole week, and not to mention plateauing.   You probably won't notice a difference in just a 24hr fast. /r/fasting recommends more than 72 hrs just to try it out, not to make a difference. Typical fasts are over a week. Even then, you have to be very educated on how to do them, and when they're successful, you gain ~50% back. When they're unsuccessful, you gain it all back. (and waste your time).   Are you drinking 3+ litres of water? Are you exercising at all? Do you go back to your old eating habits when you lose weight? What's your BMR? What's your TDEE?   Just so you know, for (most) adult women, it's safe to go down to 1000 calories a day. You mentioned that you like to stay within a safe intake, and be in the healthy 1teens as far as weight goes.

Worst of all is that the boy that I love for years always put me a lot of pressure to lose weight (as if I lost weight he would love me or give me a chance), so much of that I complained to him of my weight, he began calling me fat and things like that, even if he does not speak for badly I feel like crap because he didn't know how much I am struggling to lose weight, the days I spend taking only water, and then suddenly, I lose control of my body and start to eat all I get ahead, ruining everything.

Have you seen the sidebar pic? Do it for yourself, not for them.  Secondly, it sounds like you may need to reassess your weight loss plan if it is causing you to binge eat when you don't want or plan to.   the days I spend taking only water, and then suddenly, I lose control of my body and start to eat all I get ahead, ruining everything   ^ ...why would you think doing nf from now until Monday if you already know it's likely that you'll end up binging again because of it?  My suggestion is to consider thinking about why you binge and how to avoid it. For example:   Eat nothing for a long time = eat a LOT in a short time = binge Eat a little over a long time = no ""losing control"" of your body = no binge   Consider the big picture here! Does that make sense? Don't focus on one fast or one binge or one day. Consider what will help you achieve your goals and sustain them."

It's part of the process and nothing to feel badly about.   A little more exercise over the next couple of days will burn it all off.  Nothing to worry about in the least.

The long-term negative effects they're referring to is the metabolism. It's one of the worst thing it can do to it, it lowers it so much, that it's extremely difficult to eat under a BMR. You're almost guaranteed to put the weight back on- and because your metabolism took such a blow, you keep gaining.  Their previous comment was removed because it was a bit against the rules, but I think they were just trying to say that the ABC diet doesn't work."
proED,39ib1u,Knyburg,0,Fri Jun 12 02:11:34 2015 UTC,"Hi /u/grewapair, unfortunately this comment has to be removed. Mainly because it's not necessary to re-iterate in a proED sub that certain diets are unhealthy. However, you're an awesome contributor to the sub, so if you edit it, I can approve it.   I understand your point of view, mainly because the ABC diet doesn't work. It's something a lot of users have misconceptions about. It not a temporary fix, it makes one gain back all the weight and more.   So, you've every right to complain about that, it just needs to be explained, so it's not misinterpreted at 'concern trolling'."

Work out a tonne tomorrow, and drink lots of water, that'll make up for it.  Warning about the ABC diet: It's known to make people gain weight. It's great for temporarily losing lots of weight, no doubt- but it doesn't keep it off. It's obviously your choice to follow it, but I figure you'd like to know."

I'm not too familiar with Liposuction (and any of the health risks of it) but I think losing weight is a satisfying experience and that if you skip over it with Liposuction you are not going to experience and learn how to maintain calories and weight properly.  There is a learning-curve to weight loss, it usually takes a bit if it is your first time, like a month or so before you actually learn all the self control that comes with maintaining weight before you can actually lose weight.  If you get Liposuction your BMR will actually decrease meaning that you will have to eat less than what you already eat to maintain that new body. And if you got to a point where you managed to get ""more fat than normal"" that means you have eaten more calories than your current TDEE.  If you don't make a decent change in life style you will get the fat back, and quicker than ever. Also scarring(?) may come with the liposuction.  I don't mean to be rude but I fear this might be not work for you and you should think about this whole thing a little more. But of course, do whatever you want, I won't judge."

However--and I may be completely wrong here--but it sounds like this has been a long-term issue that OP has tried to resolve in other ways, and considering lipo as an option indicates OP hasn't been satisfied with the other means that they've tried so far.  OP says:   I have worked for it, a lot, and it hasn't gone away.   So this make me thinks that this isn't something OP can resolve without detrimental consequences to their physique.

proED,39f4vj,Knyburg,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:51:34 2015 UTC,"That's what I hear, so yeah. I just maintain for a few days then restrict again. So for a few days, I'll eat TDEE calories. My weight loss chart thus looks like a stair case."

proED,39f4vj,grewapair,2,Thu Jun 11 23:15:54 2015 UTC,"Make a food and exercise budget, and keep a food and exercise diary. If I'm losing under 2 lbs a week, I never plateau.   From myfitnesspal, I get my sedentary calories.   Then, on a 1/2 sheet of paper, I make 3 columns. The first column is titles, the second column is my allotted budget, my third column is what I did.   Column 1 has my sedentary calories in the first row, ""breakfast"" in the second row, then what I'm going to have as a mid morning snack, ""lunch"" , another snack, ""dinner"" , and ""exercise"" . At the bottom I write ""deficit"", which will be measured in calories.   In the next column, next to those words I write numbers for a budget for that day. Starting at the top using the number from myfitnesspal. The the calories in minus the calories out are the deficit. The numbers between the first and last one have to work out so that calories in minus calories out hit my desired deficit.   Then, I have to be realistic for a deficit. I can usually hit 500 on weekdays, and 2000 on weekend days because I can exercise more, sleep more, and stress eat less. That's a 6500 calorie per week deficit, 1.8 lbs per week. Keep it less than 2 lbs or you just go nuts.   In the third column, I write what I did for each of those meals, snacks and exercise, using the myfitnesspal number at the top again. I won't eat anything without pulling out that little slip of paper and writing down what I'm about to eat.  Everything I eat goes on a dish or bowl, and I write down how much it is before I eat any of it.  If I'm about to write down a number over the budget, I reduce the portion size or get something else.   If I go over in calories in for the day, I make it up with more exercise than budgeted at night so that my targeted deficit is always met.   For me, it's the only way that works. You have to write it down on real paper every day.   I've sustained it for 12 weeks, till people i trusted started telling me I was scaring them."

In /r/proED, as we are a relatively newer sub and have a smaller group of people who are consistently active here, I've experienced the same feeling of community but also feel comfortable posting about topics that may not be appreciated/tolerated in TrollX (or many other subs, for that matter).  I understand the stigma associated with EDs and with talking about them. Despite this, /r/proED doesn't pass judgement on its members. We acknowledge the prevalence and negative health implications of EDs while at the same time ensuring that this is a safe place for our members to discuss their personal experiences with EDs.  We're supportive of our posters because--regardless of your weight, BMI, body fat %, or personal goals when it comes to your diet/nutrition/health/appearance--/r/proED recognizes that we are our own worse critics. In this sub we don't aim to hate, harass, or troll others because we are already focusing these behaviors on ourselves.  That's why I really appreciate that /r/proED exists to support people in whatever way they need. Whether that is in the form of inspiration, advice or discussion, we are respectful to all of our active members.

If you're really focusing only on losing the weight by then, fasting would be your best option. Check out /r/fasting.   That said, majority of people (even those with EDs), gain back most of the weight from fasts and ABC diets. However, it can temporarily get you down closer to your goal weight.   Exercise everyday. Especially running (at least half an hour).    but I'm also a binge eater. That's my main problem.    Drink at least 3 litres of water a day. That should drop your water weight, and help fill you.  Caffeine is a great appetite suppressant.  Villainize the binge. Every unnecessary bite you take is another stretchmark. It's another fat roll.    Check out the sub's other tips here."

It's quite exhausting and I always end up really hungry.  Have you ever heard of Dexamine?

proED,395tvc,FeedMeDreams,6,Tue Jun 9 13:46:22 2015 UTC,"Hey,   I have Bulimia Nervosa- Non-Purging subtype. Prozac has really helped me a lot, but the biggest thing is to realize why you are eating. Most bulimics do it for comfort, so if you can realize that may be why you are eating, then you can let it go. It also helps to have something to do whenever you feel a binge come on (you must stop the binge in its tracks as soon as it happens. Whenever the first piece of food goes into your mouth, you won't be able to stop), like writing in a journal, exercising, or having tea (herbal teas- like peppermint- help with this. They also have a comforting effect from the warmth, so you can get the benefit of food with 0 cals).  Bulimia is rough, but it is beatable.   Also, I'm doing alright. I had a binge last night (around 1500 calories, so nothing too bad), so I can't wait to get back on track today. I foresee a lot of cardio in my future...  Message me if you need anything ^"

proED,395tvc,machyna,6,Tue Jun 9 14:46:35 2015 UTC,Hi. I am on sertraline and quetiapine for cyclothymia and both making me really hungry all the time. However they also make me drowsey so sometimes I can just sleep through the hunger... I haven't actually taken them today though as I am trying to eek out this prescription until payday when I can get more.
proED,395tvc,skinnypod,3,Tue Jun 9 19:46:18 2015 UTC,"I'm on Bupropion 150mg (extended release) as well as Sertraline 150mg (generic of Zoloft) and have been for over 2 years. I've been on my birth control (Orsythia) for 8+ years.  I actually came to terms with the fact that my depression was more severe than I thought when I was binging over and over in secret.  I wasn't initially on Bupropion but realized I needed to supplement my Sertraline with something. Wellbutrin/Bupropion does cause a decrease in appetite as a side effect, as well as (for some people) abdominal or stomach pain which can also keep you from wanting to eat. I definitely experience a decrease in appetite after I take my meds, not only from the side effects but because I typically drink a lot of water with them.  I've also experienced different dosages of Adderal (both regular and XR) and can vouch for their effectiveness at killing appetite while boosting focus and energy.  Similarly, opiates such as Xanax cause a decrease in appetite, although I personally chose to cancel my prescription because opiates tend to exacerbate my depression and anxiety.   If you DO choose to stop your medication, remember that it's important to taper off slowly, extending the taper over several weeks under your physician's direction. Talk to your doctor about switching meds if you'd like. It's really common for some antidepressants to work well for some people and not at all for others, so you have a lot of freedom to try different antidepressants/combinations of Rx's to find something that works for you. Just don't fool yourself into thinking that you'd be better off returning to a state severe depression and anxiety just because the meds you're on now are making you hungry.  Edit to add my personal favorite is over-the-counter fiber pills like Metamucil. You can't really OD on fiber unless you're not drinking enough water, and it's super effective at making you feel full when you combine it with caffeine, like tea or coffee."
proED,395tvc,Noroeste,3,Tue Jun 9 17:52:32 2015 UTC,"Nice post. Just a technicality, I thought Xanax was a benzo not an opiate. That's why I mix with opiates like OxyContin, percocets."
proED,395tvc,Knyburg,3,Tue Jun 9 20:10:21 2015 UTC,"You're right! Oxy and hydro give me the same ""weepy"" feeling that Xanax did, so I mistakenly grouped it in with opiates. Xanax is a benzo like you said."
proED,395tvc,Noroeste,3,Tue Jun 9 20:14:16 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about switching to Wellbutrin, I heard that it can decrease appetite. I only put it off for so long because the paroxetine that I take now works really well, aside from the appetite increase.   And yes, Adderall is very effective, and I hate it for that reason - I can't get anything done without it, and it's a major struggle not to take way too many at once, because it makes me acutely happy, for a while. Right now, I'm just waiting until my next script for it."

I was always told I was small for my age, and around middle school was when I first got paranoid about becoming overweight. As a result I would skip meals and cut calories like crazy, and that was the first time I became underweight.   Fast forward to high school; the school nurses, personal doctor, and my parents were watching me to make sure I didn't lose any more weight. I think I just gave up and assumed I didn't have anything to worry about so I just ate whatever I wanted. It was disgusting. And I would still hear that I was ""small"" although for my height I was technically average... and then overweight.   In college my weight decreased, but only to a ""normal"" level. Whenever I went back home for breaks or summer, I would lose my gym routine and gain weight back. The summer before junior year was my highest weight. I was working at Friendly's and Burger King, so even though I worked a lot I just ate disgusting fatty shit every day. I got back to my college friends and I was so depressed. All of my old clothes were too small, and I had slipped so far from where I was athletically.   Junior year I was off campus in my own apartment, and no school meal plan. I bought a high tech scale and started weighing myself almost religiously. I cut back to about 900 calories per day. I dropped from overweight, to average, to underweight in about a semester. When I came back for break this time, I was super careful about what I ate, and even family telling me how small I was just caused me mistrust. I continued to lose weight (more slowly this time) until graduation.   It has been almost a full year since then. I can say I've had a lot of life changes, which have taken a toll on my diet. I'm back living at home, and I have gained enough to classify me as ""average"" again. I'm still watching calories and exercising, but being around watchful eyes makes things hard.  I'm sorry this is rambling, your post just really touched me. I know the struggle of looking at old pictures of yourself and wishing you could look like that again. And being frustrated at how slow the process is, and even just wanting to cut all the fat off and start over. It sounds like we are both making some progress though, and we just gotta stay strong."

Setting up a fast-friendly eating schedule all the time will help you fast easily: I personally do intermittent fasting, so the first 16-20hours of a fast are just a normal say, to make it a 'fast' I just have to skip dinner. Skipping one meal a day takes a whole lot less mental effort than 3 meals a day plus snacks.

It's just gotten a bad rap from people who tried it and either couldn't follow through or gained the weight right back by reverting back to how they ate before.  Human physiology and metabolic processes are not that hard to understand. Eat less calories, lose more weight. Crash diets follow this simple logic by advocating low calorie diets. There is no voodoo magic or extremely complex science behind it.  The only reason that crash diets have been berated by so many nutritionists (which is the most bullshit career field that exists) is that they don't understand it most come with a significant lifestyle change.  You can't crash diet then go back to eating 2,500 calories of pizza and donuts like you were before.  If you're gonna crash diet, once you complete the diet just eat a normal amount of food. You may gain a pound back as your metabolism readjusts, but if you don't lose control and start eating everything in your pantry, you will keep that weight off.  Also exercise of course. But all of you already know that."

If you're exercising a lot then people will judge you a lot less for losing weight, especially since once you get really thin if you have some muscle definition it won't look as scary to most people.   It was better for me having muscle too. When I was just thin with no exercising, I was a size 00 but my hip bones would rub against my clothing and everything hurt. When I was the same weight after exercise, I was maybe a 3 so not as thin but I didn't have any issues and people just congratulated my fitness instead of being worried.   Now I'm just fat though... so maybe you shouldn't listen too much to me."
proED,38wvob,aaawqe,6,Sun Jun 7 23:36:36 2015 UTC,"It makes a huge difference long term. Does not make any difference short term. A calorie deficit is a calorie deficit.   But now look at the long term. Long term fasting causes biological changes that allow your body to burn fewer calories. Exercise causes the opposite.   So, long term, fasting will slow your metabolism down.  You normally burn a lot of calories just doing normal activities, heart beating, digestion, moving around. If that number falls, you'll gain weight. If it rises, you'll lose weight. The changes tend to be long term, so even though the difference may be small, over many days, they will add up.   The sweet spot is 800 calories every day. If you stay above it, your body doesn't make the sort of changes that will promote long term metabolism reduction. If you exercise all 800 calories away, you get the metabolism increase from exercise without the metabolism decrease from fasting.   TL;DR: Keep your intake above 800 calories every single day or you're gonna get fat."

If every fast day drops your metabolism by 1.1 calories a day for the rest of your life, the calories you save from just one fast day (as opposed to an 800 calorie day) is going to get counterbalanced in 2 years and then for the rest of your life, you'll gain 2.5 lbs per decade that you could have avoided just by not fasting that one day. 20 years later, you'll weigh 5 lbs more than you would have just by eating 800 calories and biking for 1.3 hours instead of that single fast day.   Now multiply that by ten fast days a year and you're up 25 lbs per decade, 50 lbs in 20 years. That is just so not worth it. Yes, you'll be lighter at first. Over the long run, it's a losing strategy.   It's like running a marathon by sprinting at the starting gate. Yes, in the short term, you'll be ahead, but you'll lose the race in the end.   Eat the 800 calories and then burn them off. That's a winning solution for short AND long term weight loss."

Edit: the link sometimes doesn't work from this site. It's a weight watchers article, I reproduced the pertinent paragraph below and bolded the 800 calorie part.  You can get there if you Google the paragraph:  ""The Starvation Myth The idea that ""not eating enough"" causes the body to stop losing weight because it goes into ""starvation mode"" is a popular myth among dieters. Article By: The Weight Watchers Research Department The Starvation Myth  It is unclear as to whether the relationship between reduced caloric intake and a lower metabolism follows a straight path or becomes more pronounced the greater the caloric reduction. Some studies have found no significant reduction in metabolism until the caloric restriction is quite large (e.g. 800 calories or less per day).2 Others suggest a linear relationship with small reductions in metabolism accompanying small reductions in caloric restriction, with the gap increasing as the caloric deficit is enlarged.""  Note.  The rest of the above article is talking about moderate calorie restriction, not the below 800 calorie kind. So if you read the article,  remember that the other points they are making have to do with restriction from 3500 to 2000, not below 800.  And yes, it's going to be a little different for everyone, and there's not an on off switch right at 800.  Your cells have  mitochondria that burn energy. If you calorie restrict below 800, the cells reduce the mitochondria as unnecessary, and if you exercise at a high intensity, your cells increase the mitochondria to supply you with the ability to sustain the intensity.  Cells with fewer mitochondria burn fewer calories.    You are better off keeping calories above 800 and exercising to maximize your ability to lose weight for years. If you just fast, losing weight becomes difficult and it is hard and time consuming to reverse that. No one has ever studied an attempted reversal, though. What we do know is fasting causes long term weight gain.   Stay above 800 every day. Even one day can have long term effects."

This is because (like he said) ethanol is metabolized just like carbohydrates are metabolized, so the higher the alcohol level - the more carbs.  However, which you drink should depend on how much you plan on drinking.  One shot of vodka (1.5 fl oz) is 97 calories .  One can of beer (~12 fl oz) is 154 calories.  One glass of wine (~5 fl oz) is 123 calories.  Per volume, you're generally better off drinking beer because:  1 fl oz of vodka - 64 calories  1 fl oz of beer - 13 calories  1 fl oz of wine - 24 calories  However, this is primarily because the alcohol content directly correlates to the calories. So if you're just trying to get drunk, it doesn't matter what you drink because you're still looking at about 500 calories.  Best advice? Quit drinking.

If you really get your diet in line with what I'm describing below, you may lose 3-4lbs in the first week just from reducing your intake of shitty foods.   You need to clean up your diet (no sugar, dairy, gluten, alcohol), focus on lean animal/seafood proteins, green vegetables, some fruit.   Then you need to establish amounts: weight loss is also about eating enough so you don't destroy your metabolism. You can find various calculators that estimate your basal metabolic rate and your daily expenditure adjusted for activity. Then you take NO MORE THAN 20% off of that to stay in a healthy range.   Finally, focus on balancing amounts of protein, carbs, and fats within the overall calorie count you've established. Set protein at 0.8 grams per pound of body weight, fat at 0.3 grams per pound, and use the remaining calories for carbs. Again, there are calculators that will help you with this. Look up IIFYM (if it fits your macros). You will need a food scale to weigh/measure. Use MyFitnessPal to track your food intake.   Get your hydration in order. Drink a gallon of water a day, spaced throughout the day.   Get the rest of your health in order: 8hrs minimum of sleep a night, adequate sunshine, low stress movement when you're not working out (walk a few miles a day, play some sports casually/lightly, swim a bit, go for an easy bike ride). All of these will stoke your metabolism.   I guarantee that if you follow these recommendations to the letter and do not deviate, you will drop weight in a healthy manner, establish long term eating habits that will improve your health, and fuel your body for workouts. You just have to be both healthy and disciplined in caring for your body.   This is more important than exercise. There's an old saying that ""abs are made in the kitchen,"" and it's 100% true.   In terms of exercise, do NOT do a lot of cardio. You've likely damaged your body through not eating enough and doing lots of cardio. Have someone teach you how to do the basic barbell lifts (squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead press) and get on a strength program. I like StrongLifts for someone in your situation. Stick to that program religiously and DO NOT add bonus high intensity cardio. The lifting is important because muscle burns calories. So the stronger you are, the more your body burns just to stay alive. You may gain scale weight but you will look leaner, your clothes will fit better, etc. Do not worry about getting ""too bulky"" from lifting. It's a myth. It's HARD to get big. You will love your body after 6-12 months of heavy lifting and clean eating, I PROMISE.   There are no shortcuts that won't bite you in the ass down the road. What I've described above works, plain and simple. It's backed up by science but also real world experience. You'll notice that nothing I've outlined is complex, new, or fancy.

It's basically a 50 day extremely rigorous diet that is pretty much useless since you'll likely gain the weight back after you get off the diet.  EDIT: I'll elaborate since my comment sounded kind of harsh once I reread it. The problem with the ABC diet is that it wrecks your metabolism over an extended period of time. By the end of the 50 days, your thyroid has slowed your metabolism as much as it possibly can. This means that once you finish the diet and you go back to a normal 1300-1500 calorie diet, you might as well be eating 3500 calories. Your body has gotten used to a lack of calories and then you flood it. Naturally, since it thinks it was starving to death, it's going to store everything it possibly can as fat. Consequently, you're going to gain back every hard-fought pound. ABC diet is just not worth it. Take my word for it."

proED,38w4dw,Zordriak,4,Sun Jun 7 09:22:49 2015 UTC,"Anybody with physical attributes outside of ""healthy"" have trouble reproducing (in this case, obese or underweight individuals). However, your argument could be used about homosexuals, and it doesn't seem like they're leaving anytime soon either. Although EDs CAN be genetic,it's also a lot about environment and personal experiences. I don't really think eating disorders will go away."
proED,38w4dw,electille,2,Sun Jun 7 09:39:01 2015 UTC,"All traits can be considered a form of natural selection. If blue eyes makes you more attractive, and you have blue eyes, you increase reproduction chances. Ambition makes you put off reproduction for other things, thus decreasing chances of reproduction. Ambition, too, is natural selection."
proED,38w4dw,Knyburg,2,Sun Jun 7 13:34:24 2015 UTC,"Well, evolution wants parents, especially mothers, to be healthy.   That's why certain reproductive functions shut down when you're over or underweight. You'd have great difficulty carrying to term, so, it's easier just to not let it happen.   It's the same reason that we as human beings seek out 'attractive' partners. Symmetry is found in healthy people, and also the scientifically proven sign of attractiveness. When people are asymmetrical, it's typically a sign of illness, so people would avoid mating with them. Granted, with today's modern technology, symmetry isn't a deciding factor of health anymore, but there's still lots of stigma associated with it- probably from how ingrained it is in society.   Attraction is also something that can be environmentally developed. In times of famine, overweight people are seen as more attractive, because they display signs of food. In most first world countries, being thin or fit is seen as attractive, it shows signs of good discipline. That's why most actresses and models are easily below a BMI of 18.   Attraction in general carries a lot natural selection with it. In most societies, what's the most pertinent to life is what's the most attractive at that point in time."
proED,38w4dw,ThinCutie,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:36:14 2015 UTC,"All these other answers are great and I'm a bit late to the party, but I'll answer it anyway.  Eating disorders are not ""forms of natural selection."" They are traits not really favored by natural selection. But since eating disorders are in general not lifelong afflictions, those who suffer from them are still able to reproduce later in their lives.  Furthermore, natural selection as a biological process works on the scale of thousands of years, not tens or hundreds. And as another commenter pointed out, it's not always a hereditary trait, rendering it completely irrelevant to natural selection.  Simple answer, no it's not. People with eating disorders aren't going to be eradicated by natural selection any time soon."

I typically update my weight on MFP once a week.   I use this scale. It has profiles, and tells you how much weight you've lost/gained since your last weigh in.

Like I've said in another post, you need to think about where you are from another perspective. From the perspective of when you were 244 pounds, do you think your quality of life is better now?  What if someone realized you have an eating disorder and tried to make you recover and you subsequently gained a lot of weight. How would you feel about how you are now?  How happy are you now with your body? If your situation is as similar to how mine was as I think it is, you are the happiest you have ever been. Embrace that shit but DO NOT LET GO OF IT. Keep losing weight because that's where the purpose and happiness lives. Not the end goal but the process.  And you don't have to like overweight people, even if they're in your family. But hating them makes it seem like you're far too emotionally invested in their weight and what they think of you. Who the fuck cares what they think? They clearly don't have the self-control that you do, so fuck 'em! Let them reprimand you and stare at you enviously because you have what they don't."

You've gone really far with weight loss, and you should be proud of that.

Everyone would still want to be thin-the models may have a bmi of 18, but how does that matter if they're still the lowest bmi that they can be?

Originally published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, the story was republished in the author's Welcome to the Monkey House collection in 1968.  The story was written as a satire to offer a critique on people's claims that we should all be equal.  It has been embraced by those critical of egalitarianism as an allegory of caution against socially enforced equality, more specifically the dangers of enforcing equality by virtue of leveling.

proED,38qlk9,NuclearLemon76,6,Fri Jun 5 23:58:57 2015 UTC,"7th grade, 4 concrete things. ONE: A group of girls started a ""hate club"" against me. Minor stuff, whatever. They'd hype each other up to come up to me in the school yard and call me ""a fat bitch"". I was 5'3 and probably 120 pounds. I knew logically that they said it out of hate, and not reality. I was a completely normal weight, but getting curves. TWO: A group of boys would walk behind me in the hallway and say, ""nice ass"" ""fat ass"" ""i'd hit that ass"". As a 12 year old girl, I was embarrassed and ashamed by my ""fat ass"". I quickly became hyperaware of my body when I walked. I felt my ass, thighs, and stomach ""shake"" with every step and ""hang over my pants"". In hindsight, completely normal. THIRD: I got my hands on a memoir about anorexia. The book glamorized it, glamorized the control and positive attention and I loved it. I took pointers from the book to start to lose weight. of course at the same time, I wanted to ""lose my fat"" (normal curves) and ""look like other girls in my grade"" (ones that simply didn't hit puberty yet). I ate nothing but gum and crackers for 2 weeks. Then, I binged. I knew what anorexia was. But never knew ""bulimia"" or ""binging/purging"". I hate an entire box of frozen toaster strudels, dancing around and shoving them happily into my mouth like a fucking animal, experiencing a binging ""high"" for the first time, in hindsight. Well, having not eaten for two weeks, my stomach swelled and I felt awful and huge and worst of all....mentally like an out of control failure. Purged horrifically, sloppily, and painfully with a tooth brush. But felt mentally at ease, ""clean"" if you will. A concerned friend told their parent, who called my parents, and the embarrassment of being discovered was enough that I stopped such behaviors. FOUR: My sister has an eating disorder, full blown and obvious. My mom goes through cycles of ""eat clean"" and ""fuck it, binge"" for my entire life. I grew up watching food be cyclical.   The starving/binging/purging was isolated to that moment in time. That is how I can pinpoint when the feeling of ""control"" and hyper-awareness of every piece of fat on my body started. From 8-12th grade, I hated my body but didn't extreme diet/extreme binge. Only ""watched what i ate"" and felt that ""i was just built 'husky' and had t suffer through life"" (120 pounds still, completely normal for fuck sake).  Enter college: gained beer weight freshman year (hit 150lbs). best friend called me ""fat, hit a gym"" during a trivial fight. I already knew i gained weight, but having it objectively pointed out was horrifying. And I lost it, lost my mind. Counting, working out, losing weight (college graduate, now at 117lbs) made me the happiest I've ever been. Up to this point, from 7th grade-junior in college, I never even put myself in the ED category. That book in 7th grade ""wasn't me"", it was just ""a guide to healthy dieting"".   Now, i know I have a disorder. The starvation/binging/purging in cycles controls my entire reality.  And now I feel like, even though ED drives me insane, it is my best friend and the surest road to happiness. I'm thin (not thin enough, 117 feels out of control, i NEED 110 and I'm striving for it). I get attention like never before, from girls and guys. I'm smart enough now to know that society values image A LOT. More than this ""fat acceptance"" movement gives it credit for. And fuck, I live in this society, so I'm going to live it right. And not miserable, stared at, or unsuccessful.  Now, to me, weight/food is control. One wrong thing becomes a ""bad day"" and I strive for ""good,clean days"" (minimal calories, clean foods). I value dizziness and lose clothes because they mean I'm in control. ""Bad"" foods make me so physically ill, and mentally unstable. It has become a cycle I cannot ease out of, and don't want to. It's a mess, unhealthy. But I won't give it up.   Damn, never wrote that out. Feel as though I could go on forever and ever, but I know you all understand and will fill in the gaps."

proED,38qlk9,Knyburg,3,Sat Jun 6 05:07:45 2015 UTC,"All my life I felt 'tainted' - like I was inferior to people around me. I'm not really sure why, but I just did. I think my mom didn't like me much, and she'd make it known. It made me really shy as a kid because I'd feel unworthy whenever I was interacting with people.   When I was 12, I guess I tried to find reasons for why I felt impure, and I concluded that it was because I'm fat and/or ugly. I decided that if I can't be the prettiest, I'll be the skinniest. I wanted to be skinnier than my cousin, who my mom always praised for being pretty/thin/good.   So summer between 6th and 7th grade, I'd run maybe 3 miles every day and restrict. I didn't count calories, but I knew I ate too much when I stop feeling hunger. I'd make sure that after I ate, I'd always feel that I wanted more. I was 5'1 at the time, so I went from 112 lb to 91 lb during the summer. I loved it. My aunt (cousin's mother) would constantly tell me how thin I was. She'd take me shopping because of it. I don't really understand why though.   School started for 7th grade and I joined cross country in order to get to run more. Restricting made me depressed or I got depression, and I started cutting and doing drugs. I got taller to 5'2 and got to my lowest weight 88 lb. my friends started getting really annoyed that I constantly talked about weight/food/calories. (I also started counting calories and became obsessive). I'd have 400-500 calories a day, run 3 miles after school, and run 2 miles after dinner.   I started binging then, and that began a pattern of binge then exercise.   In 8th grade, I continued this, but my weight fluctuates around 88-95 because of binging/exercising. Somewhere near the end of the year, an 'intervention' was stage. This made me suicidal, so I tried to overdose, which didn't work. My mom made me see a shrink, whom I didn't like.   Summer before high school, I faked 'getting better'. I got up to 100 lb then 110lb. High school was actually better for me in that I was less depressed and didn't cut as much and stopped doing drugs for a while.   Family drama began summer between sophomore and junior year and continues today. I started binge/purging via throwing up. My weight was higher because of this, and I reached my highest weight. Then I started restricting again, and my weight started dropping again, and here we are today."
proED,38qlk9,waltzingstar,3,Sat Jun 6 06:03:21 2015 UTC,"Looking back, I should have seen signs way earlier than I did. It's not normal for 10 year olds to skip meals to lose weight. I did a presentation on a ""Stick Figure"" (a book about anorexia) in 9th grade, and my teacher asked me outright if it had triggered me. I didn't make the connection, but I lost quite a bit of weight after reading it. Freshman year of college, I gained my freshman 15, and then lost it in about a week and a half of intense restricting and exercising. But I still would never have called it an eating disorder. That's just what I did, skipped a few meals or a day or two when I felt like I was getting too big.   It wasn't until I was 23 that my ED got serious, but I still wasn't getting it. I fasted for two days to be allowed to have a spoonful of peanut butter during a movie. I cried at Starbucks because I didn't have enough calories left for a nonfat peppermint mocha latte. I purged at my grandma's house on thanksgiving. I would wake up after being black out drunk the night before and cry, not because of a hangover or worried I'd done something stupid, but because I didn't know if I had eaten the night before. But it still didn't click. I got down to my lowest weight during all of this. 88 pounds. But I still didn't have an eating disorder. I was still fat. I have honestly never felt bigger in my life than when I was at my lowest.   I think my turning point was finding out that someone close to me had tried to start taking bets on when my ED would kill me. It was fucked up as hell. I woke up the next morning still drunk, refused to drink anything in case it threw off my weigh in, and stupidly drove to the gym for my morning workout. I weighed in at 91 pounds that morning, and forced myself to spend an hour on the elliptical in that horrible still-drunk-turning-into-a-hangover stage.   His ""bet"" hurt me more than I can put into words, but it did spark me to start therapy. Now I can recognize that I do have an eating disorder, not as severe as it once was, but it's still here. I doubt I'll ever fully be recovered. Most of the time I don't want to."

I won't go out of my way to hate on fat people, but I won't go out of my way to make friends with them and give them attention either.  The ""Healthy At Every Size"" bullshit that's going on makes me absolutely fume though. No! You're not healthy at 300/400 pounds. Diabetes, hypertension, and atherosclerosis are not healthy. Your body is not made to handle that much fat, that's why your pancreas is breaking down, your liver is turning to shit, your kidneys are dying, and you feel like crap all the time. You. Are. Dying.   Obesity does not need to be accepted by society. Fat acceptance is not okay. ""But that's what white people said when black people wanted social equality!"" African Americans, or any other race for that matter, have no say in what race they are. It's not acceptable to punish someone for something they had no choice in. Fat people on the other hand, have a choice. Thus, in my opinion, they're free game for discrimination. Tired of being discriminated against? Lose the fucking weight.  One can argue that anorexia, or being severely underweight is the equivalent of obesity, just on the other end of the spectrum. This is not true for a number of reasons. The most obvious being the fact that we have a mental illness. Of course that's not really fair to say; it's like fat people saying, ""Muh condishuns!"" I think the most important difference between anorexia and obesity is the fact that one is the epitome of self-control while the other is the complete lack thereof. Those with eating disorders control their weight. Sometimes we slip up, but for the most part we can fine-tune our body weight to whatever ""goal weight"" we want. What better characterization of self-control than the literal control of one's own body composition? Meanwhile, fat people are just along for the ride that their emotional binge eating takes them. They have no control whatsoever, and that's just sad."

If you're tall and fat, then it's disgusting.  I guess a thing to mention is that in Asia, people aren't shy about pointing and staring as much as they are in the US if you don't conform to the norm. It can be good or bad attention, but it's just attention. Example: fat/overweight people will be pointed at/noticed, and laughed at behind mouths.

proED,38o6l6,Zordriak,3,Sat Jun 6 10:44:12 2015 UTC,"It's usually a combination of three factors that make Asians skinny. First of all, eastern Asians are genetically more likely to have higher metabolisms. Some may claim that this is not true, but statistically if you have ethnicities that are more likely to have lower metabolisms, such as Pacific Islanders (i.e. Hawaiians), you must have outliers that are more likely to have higher metabolisms, and what better ethnicity than the one with the lowest rate of obesity in the world?  Secondly, and probably a much more significant factor, is culture. In Asian culture, it simply isn't acceptable to eat a lot. It's not acceptable to sit down at a meal, eat everything presented to you, then ask for more. You will be ridiculed. Three medium-sized meals a day are all you need in the Asian culture, if that. Snacking between meals is no where near as common as it is in America and Europe.  The last reason, which probably influences the first and second reasons, is the fact that obese Asians are predisposed to so many health problems, it just isn't worth it to them. If an Asian becomes obese, he or she becomes at risk for so many life-threatening illnesses, the ephemeral taste of food no longer seems like a viable tradeoff. I'll cite this study done by Harvard: http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity-prevention-source/ethnic-differences-in-bmi-and-disease-risk/ According to this, Asians actually on average have 3-5% more body fat than Caucasians. Now, this does not mean that they are heavier or more obese, it means that their body is composed more of fat than lean muscle. 3-5% more body fat =/= 3-5% heavier. It's just a measure of body composition.   What this 3-5% difference implies, however, is massive. If an Asian and a Caucasian were to both have the same BMI, the Asian is twice as likely to develop type 2 diabetes (I'm citing that Harvard study). For every 11 pounds that an Asian gains in adulthood, their chance of contracting type 2 diabetes increases by 84%. That is absolutely ridiculous. That's all the reason any Asian needs to stay skinny.   Being obese as an Asian is incredibly dangerous, hence why they have evolved higher metabolisms and developed a culture in which eating too much is unacceptable."

Rice isn't really healthy either.  You were right when you said they eat healthy though. If you were to take a look at any authentic/traditional Asian meal, you will find no shortage of vegetables. Asians love their vegetables. More importantly though, that meal you'll notice is not really that big. Asians know to eat food in reasonable portions, and that's part of what keeps them skinny."

You can add some garlic, pepper, salt (ONLY A LITTLE), onion powder to give it more flavor. Bake it at 450 for 20-25 minutes, pull it out, squeeze some lemon juice on it and you have a very healthy snack that is filling. Not as healthy as straight steamed broccoli but it's really good when you're craving something savory. It leaves you full for a while as well."

What I mean by this is that you shouldn't set unreasonable goals for yourself because you slipped up.  Slipping up is an inextricable part of having an eating disorder. It's going to happen, but you need to make sure you don't let yourself get sucked into a failure spiral.  The typical failure cycle goes something like this: you're restricting fine and one day you slip up. You eat 1,000 calories too many and you feel disgusting and bloated. What do you do? Well, of course, you'll eat nothing the next day! Next day comes around and there's just no way you can't eat anything. You slip up again. You set another unreasonable goal for yourself to make up for two slip ups, and you inevitably fail that one as well.  You have to take fuckups in stride. Otherwise you're going to start rationalizing failure with trying to make up for it the next day. Once you start realizing that when you fuck up, there is no real way to correct for it, you will stop fucking up.  Also, laxatives are trivial really.

proED,38m5mr,aaawqe,2,Fri Jun 5 03:19:53 2015 UTC,"Laxatives will literally do nothing. Your poop is the remains of food you've already digested, and bacteria that assists you with that digestion. Your body stores a certain amount of poop to extract water from it. It doesn't extract any calories from it.   Laxatives make you get rid of poop your body was already going to get rid of, but quickly. So rather than storing it, you get rid of it. It makes you weigh less in the short term, but it doesn't reduce fat. Your body will refill the stored poop over the next few days and you'll weigh just as much as if you didn't take laxatives.   Laxatives dehydrate you, because the water your body would have extracted from your poop isn't extracted, but you'll just drink more to compensate, so it makes no difference after a few days. And it does move the undigested food out slightly quicker, but you just get hungry faster and end up compensating by eating more.   So Laxatives don't really do much for you at all in the long run. But speaking of long run, a long run, bike ride, swim, dancing or other form of exercise will burn off the fat you store from over eating. And calorie restricting will reduce your body weight as well. Eat healthier and exercise and you'll burn the extra calories off quickly.   Finally, any drug is going to give you side effects. Laxatives will do that too if you use them enough. They don't do anything for weight loss and the give you bad side effects. I can't think of a worse thing to do."

proED,38l5yc,grewapair,0,Fri Jun 12 15:18:22 2015 UTC,"The research has been clear and consistent on this topic: fasting, or eating below 800 calories per day will reduce your metabolism and cause you to not only gain all the weight back you lost from fasting, but continue to gain weight for years.  A good summary is here   From the article: "" Restricting calories — which is necessary to lose weight — can slow down the body’s metabolism, stunting one’s ability to burn calories, making weight loss virtually impossible.""   If your goal is to lose weight in the short term,  but to gain weight in the long rum, fasting will help you do that over a period of many years. In ten years you could weigh 5 lbs more just from a single 4 day fast than you would if you didn't fast.   If your goal is to lose weight, eating a minimum of 800 calories, and then exercising all 800 calories away will have the exact same immediate weight benefits as fasting, but will also help you stay thin your entire life. Biking quickly for 90 minutes will burn 900 calories. You can actually weigh less by eating 800 calories and burning off 900, than you would if you just fasted for that day.   I hope you achieve whatever goals you set for yourself. If you want to gain weight, fasting is a great way to do that."

Lipolysis is the chemical process by which triglycerides in the blood are converted into fatty acids, which can then be metabolized.

The less of your calories that come from carbs and the more that come from fat (either eaten or liberated from fat stores), the more significant this effect will be.  Dilation is a little more ambiguous. It literally means your blood vessels temporarily get bigger by relaxing the tiny cylindrical muscles that wrap around them.

proED,38a575,FascistAsparagus,2,Wed Jun 3 21:34:17 2015 UTC,"Excellent explanation, but just two small corrections.  The first thing is that dietary fat is not prioritized during ketosis. When the body is in a metabolic state of ketosis, the body is using the three ketone bodies to produce adenosine triphosphate for cellular energy rather than the stored glycogen. This means that in ketogenesis, the synthesis of ketone bodies from acetyl-CoA and fatty acids, uses fatty acids broken down from triglycerides. These triglycerides can be obtained in one of two ways: the esterification of lipid proteins in adipose tissue or by ingested medium chain triglycerides. Any other triglyceride or dietary fat that is ingested will not be metabolized by the liver immediately. Instead, it will be stored in the appropriate tissue. If you want to read more on the oxidation of various nutrients, this is a great source: http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/nutrition/nutrient-intake-nutrient-storage-and-nutrient-oxidation.html/  Secondly, it is a proven physiological fact that vasodilation correlates to a ""better workout"". Vasodilation is achieved primarily through the release of catecholamines into the body via the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands release these chemicals (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine) in order to increase vasodilation, speed up the heart (positive chronotropic effect), and increase the force of the heartbeat (positive inotropic effect). By doing this, the body is able to maximize oxygen flow to the body and give you a ""better workout.""  tl;dr: Dietary fat is not prioritized during ketosis and vasodilation is good for your workout."

proED,38aodi,frustrateded,10,Tue Jun 2 23:59:41 2015 UTC,"Here's some tips:    Most bulimics are overweight. That's right. You have a very tiny window where you can purge, so you need to be very dedicated. Not trying to dis mia in a proED sub, but it's not great for the longterm, and comes with some gnarly side effects.  Portion size is important. It's better to eat small things throughout the day, then to binge a couple of times.  Figure your BMR, TDEE and create a calorie goal based on that information. The one I calculated for you says that your BMR is 1427 calories. Your TDEE (with exercising 3x a week) is 1963 (lucky!).  Use a calorie counter (MFP is great). It's been proven that just writing down your calories, and seeing them helps you decrease the amount. Write down everything. Every time you put something near your mouth, remember you have to write it down. This stops me so often, just because I don't want to see those calories on my screen later.  Water, all day every day. Drink about 3 litres or more (that's 12 cups). Get so full of water, that you can't eat. Plus, it helps you lose weight faster, and bloat less.  Foods high in vitamins and minerals (fruits, although they may have lots of sugar, and veggies) don't fill for too long, but are very low calorie. This should be most of your diet.  Foods high in protein and high in fat fill you for much, much longer (meats, cheeses, eggs, etc). They tend to be medium to high in calories. Limit these.  Foods high in trans and saturated fats barely fill you (junk foods). They are high to very high in calories. Avoid these.  Carbs are good to limit (50 grams a day), often found in pastas and breads. They're also common in fruits, so be picky.    There are some awesome subreddits out there that help with mealplans for weight loss!:    /r/1200isplenty /r/1200isplentyketo /r/keto  /r/Paleo  /r/caloriecount  /r/EatCheapAndHealthy  /r/fasting  /r/fitmeals  /r/lowcarb    Here's a super simple meal plan I just came up with. It's quite balanced.  The best part about optional snacks, is that if any event ever comes up, or you have to eat out, it can shave off enough calories to keep you within your goal!     Time Food    Breakfast Coffee/Tea and yogurt or a smoothie   Snack (optional) a vegetable or fruit   Lunch Salad with light dressing. Vegetables with a homemade low-cal dip.   Snack (optional) a vegetable or fruit   Dinner Protein (tofu, chicken, steak), with no heavy sauces (all sauces must be low-cal, nothing buttery or oily) with a side.   Dessert (optional) Fruit, or small amount of dark chocolate"

You've earned my trust so I hope I'm not bugging you :P First of all, I wanted to know if there's like, a time-zone of when your body starts to digest its own fat reserves.  Like, do you have to have an empty stomach for at least 5 hours at a time before your body starts to use its stores, or, if you eat something small every hour, will you never lose fat because you're just using the energy in that small food item throughout the next hour?      I also wanted to know how long you can fast before your metabolism starts to slow down.  I was thinking about doing 24 hour fasts, maybe twice a week, but I don't want to do this if it's going to slow my metabolism and make it more difficult to lose weight.  I know if I exercise then I'll most likely keep it up, but I just want to make sure.      Thank you again!!  I really appreciate it."
proED,38aodi,ThinCutie,3,Thu Jun 4 14:16:53 2015 UTC,"Hi there. I'm not /u/ThinCutie but I can answer your questions.  To address your first question, the amount of time it takes for your body to stop utilizing carbohydrate stores and begin metabolizing adipose depends heavily on how much you eat. The fundamental principle is this: once you have exhausted your supplies of carbohydrates in your digestive tract and glycogen stores in the liver, your body will begin to tap into your fat reserves.  How long would this take? Well, let's say your basal metabolic rate, the amount of calories you need to sustain yourself for a day, is around 1800 calories. That means, on a very rough average, you are consuming 1800/24 = 75 calories per hour. Thus, if you were to consume 150 calories of spinach/lettuce (which is a TON), it would take approximately 2 hours for you to start tapping into your glycogen stores in the liver. How long it takes you to consume your glycogen stores depends heavily on how much of what you eat is made up of carbohydrates. Once that is consumed, your body metabolizes adipose tissue. If you were to continue to remain at a calorie deficit, your body would eventually reach a minimum level of adipose and begin to consume proteins from your muscles. At first only skeletal muscles, your body will eventually consume your smooth muscle and you'll die. Of course, that's the extreme - the complete macrometabolic process of the body.   To address your second question, I'll use this page as a reference: http://www.healthpromoting.com/learning-center/articles/therapeutic-fasting  The short and simple answer: the second you start tapping into adipose stores, your body is already realizing that it needs to slow your metabolic rate.  The longer answer: the body is constantly adapting to the amount of energy it is provided. The thyroid regulates the body's metabolic rates through the secretion of hormones, but overall your metabolic rate is primarily determined by your genes. What the thyroid can regulate though, it regulates based on how often it is tapping into reserve supplies. For someone with an eating disorder such as anorexia who is constantly in a metabolic state of ketosis, will have the slowest metabolic rate the body can effectively achieve. This is what causes that ""plateau"" that you see everyone complaining about. After a certain point, I'd say about two months, an anorexic will begin to have a lot of trouble losing weight because their thyroid is forcing their body to metabolize everything as efficiently as possible. This is because the body is panicking and believes its on the verge of death.  The amount of time that it takes for your metabolism to begin to slow down? One minute after your burn through your glycogen stores. The amount of time that it takes for your metabolism to have significantly slowed from pre-ketosis? I'd give it a month if you're inactive and only restricting. I'd give it two months if you exercise moderately. Three to four months if you're constantly running, swimming, etc.  As you can see, there are a lot of factors that determine your metabolic rate and when your body will burn fat, but the fundamental base is easy.

proED,37s3oe,FascistAsparagus,4,Sat May 30 00:23:54 2015 UTC,"It's possible. I can think of two ways. By subtraction: Run an unsoaked slice of cucumber through a calorimeter, then run a soaked one, and subtract the latter from the former. The result is the caloric content that leeched into the water during the soaking process.  Alternatively, since we don't have calorimeters lying around, we can use chemistry. Protein, fat, and complex (fiber-bound) carbohydrates aren't going to dissolve in say a twenty-four hour soak. It would take far longer for them to break down chemicqlly. However, the simple sugars will leech out through osmosis.   Wolfram Alpha thinks a serving of cucumber has one gram of sugar. That's about four calories, and I think she has about three servings of cucumber in there, so if all of the sugar leeched into the water, that's twelve calories, tops."

I call it my bitch pill.   Raspberry ketones: nothing. Maybe a placebo effect, if even that. Plus it gives me a weird rotten fruit taste in the back of my throat.   Garcinia cambogia: mixed effects. Sometimes it's helped with appetite suppression, sometimes not. Too iffy for me to buy regularly.   Slimquick: pretty decent! Didn't do much for long lasting appetite suppression, but I definitely ate less immediately after taking it. Plus every bottle comes with a $5 off coupon for the next one!  Xenadrine: This is what I'm doing now, and I really like it so far. I haven't been doing it long enough to say much though. I think the key here (and probably with all of them) is actually following the instructions for once.

The ""new"" formula is still decent but doesn't work nearly as well in the relative long-term (cycle on for a month, cycle off for a month---original formula's results maintained during the off month and worked more effectively when cycling back on).  But I recommend literally just buying pure DMAA and pure caffeine powders. If you measure and cap your dosages properly you can save a LOT of money and have a lasting supply. You need to know what you're doing though, it's easy to OD on either and make yourself sick.  I second snorting Adderall.

proED,37hu57,FascistAsparagus,5,Wed May 27 21:37:29 2015 UTC,"Here are some things that can help reduce bloating between now and then!   Eat parsley. It is a natural diuretic and can help you digest more comfortably Similarly, if you feel you are retaining water, not gas you can take a potassium supplement. Potassium-rich foods, like asparagus/bananas/nuts/cantaloupe/mangoes/spinach/tomatoes act as diuretics. They can flush out excess water Take 200mg of magnesium, which can help you to expel excess gas and fluid more quickly Drink water consistently to help reduce bloating due to sodium levels Take an antacid. Basically the Calcium carbonate in Tums works by lowering the amount of acid in the stomach. Simethicone works by breaking up gas bubbles in the gut Go for a walk. Walking for at least 30 minutes is likely to help digestion considerably. Especially because lying down can cause gas, bloating, acid reflux and other digestive problems after eating Avoid: Caffeinated drinks, smoking and chewing gum which can cause to swallowing air = bloat   Also, check your posture. Standing up straight reduces the appearance of bloat."

Vitamin C and K are used by your body to fight toxins or infections.   It sounds like anemia which is very normal with low cal intakes. Eat broccoli and baby spinach to up your levels some. Also I recommend a little better melted over the broccoli because vitamin k or a requires fat to be broken down and absorbed.

proED,36n5us,Virgil1414,2,Thu May 21 01:02:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, the muscle will definitely shrink. My family has big calves and as I lost weight, mine shrunk. Just remember to run on flat surfaces rather than uphill."
proED,36o9x0,Knyburg,2,Wed May 20 20:57:27 2015 UTC,"There are studies that show that weighing daily causes people to lose weight more that once a week or less because you are constantly aware of food and weight daily.   Now personally I weigh probably once every other week if that. So really if it works for you and keeps people off your case, weigh once a week."
proED,36o9x0,LESBIAN_PRINCESS,2,Fri May 22 14:54:10 2015 UTC,I do daily just because I don't like not knowing.
proED,36o9x0,Virgil1414,1 point,Wed May 20 21:25:46 2015 UTC,i like to weigh every morning but then track it and look at graphs of the last month. daily fluctuations don't freak me out as much when i know there's an overall downward trend.
proED,36o9x0,nostillmeansyes,2,Thu May 21 06:13:16 2015 UTC,"I would, but I feel like my family judges me if every morning they see me walk into the bathroom and weigh myself, so I don't unless they're not here."
proED,36o9x0,nostillmeansyes,2,Thu May 21 18:29:11 2015 UTC,"makes sense, better to be sneaky than sorry. I basically live alone so i can have as many weird habits as i want.... which is good and bad...."
proED,36o9x0,TheAngelErika,1 point,Thu May 21 18:53:55 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be at university next year, so I can probably get away with slightly abnormal things. Honestly, I hope my roommate is weird about food too...I mean that would be bad but also good."

proED,36l4sw,Virgil1414,8,Wed May 20 04:44:10 2015 UTC,"Waking up with a completely empty stomach is the best feeling. It is so flat, almost concave, and you can choose any of your favourite tight clothes and start a perfect day."
proED,36l4sw,Hiiir,3,Wed May 20 19:49:50 2015 UTC,I know. I can see my hip bones so clearly. It's like the one time that I actually enjoy looking in the mirror.
proED,36l4sw,PullOutFirst,4,Wed May 20 20:34:55 2015 UTC,Same boat as you tonight. Thanks for the reminder!
proED,36l4sw,herecomeslucy,3,Wed May 20 04:52:21 2015 UTC,"This was so satisfying to find, I've never spoken about this with anyone. The excitement for that morning feeling can be motivation enough not to eat of an evening, and choosing your tightest clothes in the morning when you're feeling fiiiiiine stops you binging during the day. Yes yes yes."
proED,36l7zj,matroyshka_Dolly,2,Wed May 20 05:15:06 2015 UTC,I think running would be better. Any exercise will help though.
proED,36l7zj,Klairvoyant,1 point,Wed May 20 05:34:15 2015 UTC,I thought running might be better.
proED,36l7zj,LESBIAN_PRINCESS,2,Wed May 20 05:52:40 2015 UTC,"Running will burn more but you may get better toned abs with dancing.   If you're limiting to that amount, then I would recommend dancing. I needed to eat around 800-1200 when I ran because restricting too low would cause me to black out after runs."
proED,36kida,Knyburg,6,Wed May 20 01:30:57 2015 UTC,"Yep, I also think it works well if you become vegetarian/vegan for ethical reasons and convince yourself to think of meat or dairy products as really filthy and gross, coming from all these tortured animals in completely inhumane methods, really makes you rather want to starve than eat it."
proED,36kida,Hiiir,2,Wed May 20 19:31:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's actually sort of why I became vegetarian as well as not wanting to eat meat. I had a pet fish, and I'd watch it swim in its own shit, and I was like, ""I would never eat that knowing where it has been"", and then I figured that animals like pigs and cows and chickens probably have also been in equally disgusting places."
proED,36kida,glitterfade,3,Wed May 20 20:40:22 2015 UTC,I'm vegan for ethical reasons and to me now meat and dairy is dirty and gross and inhumane and I couldn't stomach putting it inside me. For the first year of being vegan I lost about a stone and toned up. But then I discovered vegan junk food and chocolate (it's not as sparse as you think!).
proED,36kspu,Knyburg,4,Wed May 20 02:52:13 2015 UTC,I don't have any rituals. I just eat really slowly and procrastinate a lot.
proED,36kspu,Virgil1414,2,Wed May 20 03:21:56 2015 UTC,"I just eat a couple bites when I'm hungry and continue my day. In all honesty, I'm baked almost all the time so my mind is distracted from food."
proED,36kspu,LESBIAN_PRINCESS,1 point,Fri May 22 15:03:01 2015 UTC,On weed? Weed always makes me more hungry.
proED,36kspu,LESBIAN_PRINCESS,3,Fri May 22 15:05:51 2015 UTC,"Ever notice how stoners are skinny? Like the people who are stoned 80-90% of the day. Sure most people eat more when they smoke occasionally and if they aren't careful they will gain. But when you are like the people who actively smoke throughout the day, then you really stop feeling hungry at all. I guess it is constantly there and your brain starts to not register the feeling. There are explanations out there on that concept of how it does that.  So yeah, I probably find myself eating like 3 snacks a day and one meal. I only eat because I begin to get stupid high. That happens when low blood sugar and really hungry mix with being high. So I just eat to make sure that doesn't happen.  Also, I smoke straight Sativa strains which is the one that doesn't give you (as much) munchies."
proED,36kspu,LESBIAN_PRINCESS,0,Fri May 22 17:35:17 2015 UTC,"I've seen skinny stoners and fat stoners. Weed isn't really my thing. I prefer opiates. It sounds cliche but I really dislike the smell of it, but I guess people get use to it."

proED,36gm6t,Virgil1414,2,Tue May 19 06:06:06 2015 UTC,"You do realize that food and drugs both act the same to our brain. It releases chemicals that make us feel good and happy. Which is why eating often ties to depression.   Look up sugar vs cocaine. You'll understand.   As for a tip, if you can't give up certain foods, eat a small amount of it as you leave the house so you can't be tempted by it after."
proED,36gm6t,LESBIAN_PRINCESS,1 point,Fri May 22 15:04:46 2015 UTC,I've heard that. I'm going to try to give up a sugar because I think that's probably addicting and starts binges.
proED,36gm6t,LESBIAN_PRINCESS,3,Fri May 22 16:52:18 2015 UTC,I don't even touch sugars. I follow a strict ketosis diet. So almost zero (more like 14 grams or so) carbs a day. The carbs come from veggies.
