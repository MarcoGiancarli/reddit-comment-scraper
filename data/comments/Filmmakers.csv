Filmmakers,3e2x8p,jax9999,3,Tue Jul 21 16:31:30 2015 UTC,"Bingo. It's not unusual for there to be a ""walk away"" lunch (meaning you pay for your own food) if where you're working has easily accessible restaurants, or if the studio has a commissary.  Generally you don't want people to disperse and be late getting back because of traffic, parking, lines, whatever. Also providing free food makes people happy, and that's important when working around hot lights and prima donnas 12-16 hours a day."
Filmmakers,3e2x8p,Apotropaic_Sphinx,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:14:51 2015 UTC,"I said this in another comment but I'll say this here. It can't possibly be just location. For example, my campus is like its own little closed off town. Everyone has there own meal plans, and we can all just go to any dining hall we want. But its still a custom to feed your crew on set with some sort of pizza/sandwitches/etc  at the very least. Why cant this custom be transfered to theatres? I'm not saying during every rehersal. I'm saying if you are performing a matinee show, and then you have a night show. There's a meal in between (at least the low key local productions I've been a part of) that ask everyone to pitch in a few bucks for pizza. Does this make more sense?"
Filmmakers,3e2x8p,EricT59,11,Tue Jul 21 19:29:08 2015 UTC,Apples and oranges Theater is setup then several weeks of queues then strike  Film is 30 days of all hands on deck and available.  Also it is modeled on the union contracts
Filmmakers,3e2x8p,Ootrab,8,Tue Jul 21 15:49:03 2015 UTC,"This is because rehearsals and performances are usually only about 4 hours of your time. When you are shooting a film, you are usually on set 12-16 hours a day. Anything over 6 hours and you have to feed them. Less than a 6 hour shoot is optional on whether you feed them. I think over 12 you have second meal as well. If I had a 4 hour shoot of a short film, I wouldn't provide lunch for everyone. But I might bring snacks and drinks as a courtesy."
Filmmakers,3e2x8p,imscammer15,5,Tue Jul 21 17:32:04 2015 UTC,"In California it is a state law to have a 30 minute break after 6 hours for a meal. If you can't leave then the employer provides a meal.  Usually the meal is $10-15 a head.  It also keeps everyone on time. If you had everyone leave durning the day and have to come back that is a good way have getting behind schedule.   I haven't worked in theater but do they get to the 6 hour make and are they allowed to leave and come back?  If your first meal is a one small pizza from dominos, you will have a mutiny very quickly."
Filmmakers,3e2x8p,instantpancake,0,Tue Jul 21 17:24:48 2015 UTC,"Usually the meal is $10-15 a head.   This. The point is that the employer is offering the cast/crew an opportunity to purchase meals at work (over here, it's usually deducted straight from your wage, and it's opt-out). But on paid shoots, the meals aren't free (edit: seriously, why would they be free?).  On unpaid or micro-budget shows however, it's a matter of common decency to not charge your already under-paid cast and crew for the food."
Filmmakers,3e2x8p,imscammer15,5,Tue Jul 21 18:33:00 2015 UTC,"To clarify I never spend money on food if I'm working on a film, TV, whatever project.  What I'm saying is I expect my employer to be spending $10-15 on my meal which is common practice.  My meals are always free."

Filmmakers,3e2x8p,tubesockfan,8,Tue Jul 21 21:10:26 2015 UTC,"Someone acting in your student film is not a participant in the process in the way that someone acting in a student play is. With the tedium and long hours of a film set (especially a student film, honestly), your actor is essentially doing free labor for you. Feeding them is the absolute bare minimum level of consideration to show.  Whereas somebody acting in a play only has to rehearse for a couple hours at a time, maybe be at the theater for a half-day during a performance... and they're much more ""part of the team"" than they would be on your set, sitting around until it's time for a take and then performing the same action over and over again. So it's not unreasonable to ask somebody to pitch in toward a shared fun activity.  I guess that's the difference. A student play is an activity.... acting in your student film is work."
Filmmakers,3e2x8p,tomismaximus,7,Tue Jul 21 15:49:44 2015 UTC,"I think op is implying more about feeding the crew, as in gaffers and people doing the ""grunt"" work, not just the actors."
Filmmakers,3e2x8p,ArtAdamsDP,3,Tue Jul 21 16:00:24 2015 UTC,"There's not as much money on the line in theater, the days are shorter, there's less to get done. On film shoots the hours are longer, there's more to do, and if you give people a meal break they need an hour off the clock for lunch to go feed themselves and come back as opposed to a half hour to feed them yourself.   If you keep everyone on location then you don't have to worry about stragglers stumbling in late after lunch.  The short version: there's too much money at stake on film shoots for some people to stumble back late from lunch and hold up the rest of the crew. It's more efficient to feed them yourself, give them a shorter lunch break and get back to work more quickly."
Filmmakers,3e2x8p,saltybilgewater,3,Tue Jul 21 17:57:07 2015 UTC,"In what student theater were you working in where they could afford to pay for food? No student production I've ever worked on had a budget that could cover crew costs and usually crew work was for student credit, or just cause you liked it so much and wanted the experience.   The big difference is that most films are shot on a set, often in some place that might not have any services and also set work is more unpredictable (especially student work), whereas with crewing at a theater it's easier to maintain a set schedule. Lunch break at 12:30. They can keep you on set if they buy your lunch for you.   Not to mention that getting the hell out of the theater for a few minutes is essential during the day since you're so intensely focused and having some time in the open air can be a life-saver."
Filmmakers,3e2x8p,buzzxsassy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:01:53 2015 UTC,"There is no requirement to feed, only a requirement to break for meal.  If the company provides meal then it can be 30 minutes (really 45-50 if given the last-man courtesy) otherwise it's a walk-away lunch for one-hour.  The trouble is not everyone comes back on time due to traffic or food line at restaurant, so it's seemingly better to serve and keep the crew close and on time.  Plus, an army marches on their stomachs...but there is no requirement."

Filmmakers,3e2x8p,lockmon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:02:11 2015 UTC,When you are on location in the desert outside of palmdale it can be a little tough to find a quick lunch and get back to your location within an hour.  In addition typically shoots are in different places every day and it is kind of a burden to ask everyone at work to look up new places to find food everyday.  A theater is always in the same place.    I would also mention that it is a union rule and has become standard for everyone.  I know people who work in production offices and still get free lunches.
Filmmakers,3e2x8p,FF709,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:12:29 2015 UTC,"Im not complaining about being fed for services. Im 100% for that. I always feed my crews to the best I can, and I always appreciate being fed well as well. But I'm saying, why can't this logic transfer to theatre? It cant possibly be only the location. It just has to be the mindset as well. Like for example, my campus is a closed campus. Everyone has a meal plan, and everyone can break to go to the dining hall to eat whenever they please. But it is still a custom to feed the crew with food yourself. Get me? While I'm doing lighting or sound for a theatre company where the actors are acting, giving my time away, I'm still required to pay that few dollars towards pizza or something."

There is one theatre company that I work with that has started providing a huge table of snack, fruit, cheese, cookies and of course coffee and tea. Kinda like the craft table on film. They also occasionally provide a meal if time is tight. Everyone really appreciates the gesture. They have started to build this cost into the budget of every production and it makes for a happier and healthier cast and crew."

Theatres tend to be surrounded by other buildings, some of which are shops or eateries. Film units might spend weeks in the desert or forest or up mountains.

I actually have no idea how it works except it fits on the top or bottom of the mattebox where the top-flag would normally fit.   A french flag is like a top-flag or side-flag of a mattebox. But instead of being hard mounted onto the mattebox, it is usually attached to an articulating arm, so it can be placed in a more flexible position to block lens flares.   Example of a french flag: http://www.filmtools.com/cameradept/camera-lenses/lens-accessories/frenchflagsaks.html  My educated guess is that it is an anchor/attachment point for french flags."

Unfortunately I don't think it's an effect that you'll be able to believably pull off with software alone.  You'll probably need to ADR everything with a younger actor, or have him adjust his performance.  Usually if you pitch a human voice more than a semitone up or down, people can tell that there's something 'off' about it.  If you have access to Antares software though, there are some really interesting plug-ins like Throat that let you play with parameters beyond pitch, and formant, but I can't say if that would be believable enough for your purposes either.  They're usually used more for sound design and musical effects."

You'll probably also make the evidence publicly available as well, won't you. That beside the fact that you don't know if it's safe. It might look okay, but it could also collapse at any moment. There could be exposed asbestos, toxic mold, dangerous or endangered wildlife. I really wouldn't.  And for the love of Godard, please don't run around with things that look like guns in a place you shouldn't be. That is how someone gets shot by police. It has happened. It doesn't make you a cool rebel filmmaker. It makes you the arsehole who thinks his ""art"" is more important than his cast and crew's safety,  Do it properly. Find the property owner, get a permit. Using guns on set is a big bit of logistics. And no, it isn't relevant that these are toy guns. You have to notify the local police and comply with their conditions. You have to leaflet any nearby homes well in advance. You have to place signs on any walkways or paths so that someone out walking their dog doesn't call the police because of a bunch of maniacs having a gunfight.  You've dismissed the gun issue out of hand, but that is your biggest issue. Under many jurisdictions, a toy that has been made to look real is real in the eyes of the law, so you may be charged with any number of firearms violations, far more serious than trespass.

But yeah, really interesting seeing your process to get to the look Tom was looking for, I know you had some great stuff to work with. Im happy to see that its come together so well. I wanted to ask, when grading with/to reference material, whats your process like? Is it a case of matching your grade to the material exactly, then going for feedback, or are you using it as a jumping off point, trying to get the look, not the specifics.  Also, did you use any secondary grading to unify or enhance the green in the production design elements?"
Filmmakers,3dzq8v,shadovvfox,2,Tue Jul 21 02:22:48 2015 UTC,"Oh nice! Those long exposure shots of the shoot are sick and I think I used one of your photos of that wall as a VFX plate. Tom showed me that shot you took of David swinging the hammer as another idea for how he wanted things to look.   One thing you can do is just bring the reference image straight into Resolve and look at the scopes and see what it's made up of, then adjust the shot you're working on so the scopes just match up. From doing it for long enough now for the most part I can just look at an image and know what I need to do to get there, but it's still handy for finding subtle colour imbalances here and there.   Using references as a be-all and end-all can be dangerous if what you've shot isn't conducive to that kind of look, but they're handy for giving you an idea of what direction the client wants you to go in, as describing in words how they want something to look can be tricky when thus far it's only been in their head.   Didn't use many secondaries because most of the green was being added in by my primaries, but the lower left adjustment of this group here is boosting the green channel just to help it stand out a little more."

That being said, I don't get a Tarkovsky vibe at all from the final color grade. I think the grain is perhaps too strong and it makes it look more like a 70's/80's B movie than a Tarkovsky film.   That being said, not looking like a Tarkovsky film is perfectly fine and I do think the finished frames look awesome."

I don't want to speak for the director but I took it as that scene being more of a visual reference rather than a tonal one.   And the grain looks pretty heavy handed in those stills because a) it's not moving and b) it's been down-rezed and compressed. In 4k and in motion it's a lot more subtle. I don't use it very often but given that we were going for the '70s feel I didn't like how clean the RED image was, lacking texture of any kind, so I added a little in. The Alexa does that all on its own which is why it's such a joy to work with."

This is for people who just want to see a quick sample of the type of projects I've worked on (usually just to get a sense of the variety of projects, genres, their budget, production value, etc). This video is only about 2 min long, which is about the extent of one's attention span for a reel. Usually I'll send this along with my first inquiry into a job.   Then if they want to see more of a specific type of project I have short projects or excerpts from long projects (with their original editing intact) that I can show them individually.  In my opinion trying to take chunks of 4 or 5 pre-edited videos and force them together into a reel just doesn't make sense. It's going to end up being like 8-15 min long and no one is going to watch that, they'll only see the first one and then turn it off if they hate it. Without the context of the rest of the pieces they are cut from they won't always make sense and it may be confusing to have them play one right after another unless you add titles in between to separate them, which is going to make it even longer. Plus you likely don't want to splice a music video and a commercial along with a narrative piece if you're applying to edit a narrative film.  My advice is to set up a vimeo account and upload your short reel as well a bunch of other short projects and clips from long projects. Password protect everything. Then ask your client what they'd like to see and provide links+passwords for those specific videos."

Filmmakers,3e2bk4,wolfcry0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:08:55 2015 UTC,I set it so the level is around -6db at the loud bits
Filmmakers,3e2bk4,CapMSFC,2,Tue Jul 21 16:10:52 2015 UTC,"Something that nobody has really gotten into here is that your peaks are not an accurate indication of loudness.  When mixing audio you track both peaks for clipping as well as the loudness for volume.    Adobe Audition has a built in plug in these days for loudness meters that's not too hard to figure out, but keep in mind that is just giving you data.  Adjusting levels is a process of setting gain, normalizing, EQing, and compressing (those items aren't in a particular order).  Overall audio levels should be very hot for Youtube.  Many people are viewing on portable devices that don't have the volume to handle quieter clips.  You want low dynamic range, high loudness, no clipping audio for this type of delivery."
Filmmakers,3e2bk4,Of-Doom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:20 2015 UTC,"I was researching this recently and it seems like it's a bit of wild west online, so people are mastering their tracks as loud as they can. This thread on Gearslutz was really helpful.   No rules, but most people seem to be allowing the peaks up to -1 or -2 dBFS or dBTP, while the average loudnes is between -15 and -18 LUFS or LKFS."
Filmmakers,3e2bk4,jpellizzi,-3,Tue Jul 21 20:08:24 2015 UTC,"Not sure how you're doing your final mixes, or with what software, but generally you want to be between -16 and -20 LUFS over the course of your video, measured with an actual loudness meter like Izotope Insight.  As others have said, peak levels don't really give you any indication of the average loudness.  Along those lines, normalization isn't an effective way of making everything louder because it's dependent on your highest peak.  You need to use EQ, compression and volume automation to get everything sounding even across the board so you can raise it as a whole without clipping.  I know most NLE's don't let you put a limiter on the master bus though...  Source:  I do a ton of web mixes for ads, corporate, films and a few big youtube channels, and I find -18 LUFS to be the sweet spot for dynamic content with music, sfx, dialog and VO.  Around that level, Youtube seems to leave my mix alone."
Filmmakers,3e2bk4,JointOperationsCente,2,Tue Jul 21 21:27:58 2015 UTC,YouTube automatically compresses your audio when re-encoding. You don't have to worry about that.
Filmmakers,3e2bk4,JointOperationsCente,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:36:37 2015 UTC,"But if that's the case, how come some videos are extremely loud? A lot of reddit posts on /r/videos have to have a flair if the video is too loud."
Filmmakers,3e2bk4,Joeboy,2,Tue Jul 21 12:44:20 2015 UTC,Because they are usually older videos from before using an older set of rules when compressed.   Read up on this: http://www.kevinmuldoon.com/audio-levels-youtube/
Filmmakers,3e2bk4,richardtate,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:49:35 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, it does not appear that non-music videos are being normalised. Hopefully, this situation will change in the future. Until then, YouTubers such as myself will need to pay attention to the volume of audio in their videos.   Edit: Also, normalization is a very conservative measure towards maximizing your loudness. If you are an enthusiastic participant in the loudness wars, you can presumably make it louder than Youtube's default by using more extreme compression / limiting than whatever it is they do. Not that you necessarily should, but you could.  Edit2: Actually maybe I withdraw Edit1 as I guess maybe Youtube reduce the volume of excessively loud uploads as well as increasing the volume of quiet ones. Whatever they do can probably be gamed somehow, to some extent.  Edit3: If Youtube are normalizing your audio, and they're using simple peak normalization (which seems likely based on what I've just read), then one thing that would make most of your audio quiet, would be having some audio that's much louder than everything else. They'll boost the loud bit to the ""right"" maximum volume, leaving everything else much quieter. The ""loud bit"" might not be like a gunshot or something you'd expect to be loud, it might be a plosive or a knocked mic or something."
Filmmakers,3e2bk4,JointOperationsCente,2,Tue Jul 21 14:16:06 2015 UTC,okay I'm just confused because a lot of the audio in my videos is more quiet than most videos. If YouTube automatically compressed it shouldn't all new videos have the same audio level all around?

The only thing that is holding me back now is time. If I spend more time on a shot it will of course look better.   Those shots of the city are amazing, but are done by a team of people. I´m only one 18 year old guy so I can´t live up to their quality, but I can create something that still looks photoreal and is very belivible."

Filmmakers,3e1tcx,zachintyre,4,Tue Jul 21 08:28:51 2015 UTC,"Mounting a mic on top of a DSLR without a preamp isn't the best audio solution, but if that's what you have to do, I don't recommend either of these mics:   Consumer mics such as the Rode Videomic ""Pro"" have flimsy, unbalanced 3.5mm outputs If you ever plan to put your mic on a boom in the studio at some point in the future, long runs of 3.5mm cable, running from an unbalanced consumer mic's output, are subject to RF interference and noise.   If mounting a shotgun on the camera is your only option, you might want to consider a pro mic instead, such as the battery powered Rode NTG-2 with a shock mount plus a line transforming XLR to 3.5mm adapter [Referral Links]:   $216.55 (on sale) Rode NTG-2 pro mic $11.59 shock mount $16 Hosa line transforming XLR to 3.5mm adapter   For a total of $244 (less than the price of a Stereo Videomic ""Pro""), you'll have a real professional microphone with an upgrade path that will allow you to put it on a boom when the time comes.  Hope this is helpful and good luck with your doc!"
Filmmakers,3e1tcx,HybridCamRev,2,Tue Jul 21 10:40:49 2015 UTC,This is the exact same advice I've given numerous times.  It'll give you better results now and allows you to step up your game and do audio properly with a boom operator very easily.  You can even still run the audio into the camera and just have a boom op standing beside you tethered while doing interviews.  It'll sound a hundred times better than an on camera mic.

Filmmakers,3e1tcx,CapMSFC,2,Tue Jul 21 19:35:34 2015 UTC,In addition to what's already been said I wanted to address the idea of using a stereo mic.  Stereo microphones almost never make it on to professional sets.  Typically each microphone you have is being deployed in the best position to record a single sound source.  The only time a stereo microphone makes sense is when you're trying to capture the overall sound of a location.  This makes it terrible for recording a person speaking on camera in front of you.  It'll be pulling in all of the unwanted noise of the city around you.
Filmmakers,3e0u70,balamh,4,Tue Jul 21 02:18:16 2015 UTC,Yes.... but I can't send examples due to confidentiality. But they are used. We used one on the last TV show I was on. It was put together by the director and people used it to get a feel for the show (funnily enough :-P ).

Also, I got mine body only for about $200 so you can spend the rest of your budget on a decent lens (i got a vintahe 50mm f/1.8 olympus lens because I wanted a smooth apperture but the canon equivalent is equally better), microphone, lights and other things that are much more important than your camera."
Filmmakers,3e1483,flyingp0tatoes,4,Tue Jul 21 11:47:15 2015 UTC,"with a $600 budget, I recommend you avoid DSLRs.  Here's why.  In your price range, Nikon DSLRs lack:   The ability to change aperture in Live View (video) mode a usable viewfinder when you switch to Live View compatibility with affordable power zoom lenses compatibility with silent, video optimized lenses (here is the problem with noisy Nikon autofocus motors) the ability to record for more than 30 minutes continuously an intervalometer   Canon DSLRs lack:   1080/60fps for smooth HD slow motion (they are limited to 30 frames per second) a usable viewfinder when you switch to ""Live View"" (video) mode compatibility with affordable power zoom lenses the ability to record for more than 30 minutes continuously an intervalometer   Plus, most DSLRs in your price range suffer from a phenomenon known as ""moire"" as the result of poor downscaling.  Panasonic G and GH cameras, for example, have a better downscaling algorithm. Here are a couple of side-by-sides between the Canon 60D and a moire-resistant Panasonic GH camera:   60D vs GH2 Moire Test Canon 60D vs Panasonic GH2 evil moiré test   Newer Canon cameras are not much better.  Here is a side-by-side between the Canon 60D and 70D:   Canon 70D and 60D moire comparison   Instead of a DSLR, you might want to consider the $515 Panasonic G6 with the 14-42mm kit lens [Referrral Link].  This camera has a viewfinder that actually works while you're recording video, has a built-in intervalometer for time lapse, records at up to 1080/60p for smooth slow motion, records for hours continuously (instead of minutes), has a lens with a silent autofocus motor and is compatible with affordable power zoom lenses.

Plenty of truisms get thrown around, like this one: ""if they knew how to get work, they'd be getting it for themselves."" Ultimately you need to make your own path.

Private uni (include art school), public uni, and just moving to film industry city.  Private and art school. Stay away from private schools unless you have big scholarship/s or come from money. If you don't come from money, you will have over $100k in debt after college. your life is going to suck and be a real struggle. once you graduate. you will be paying $900 to $1200/month for 10 years in student loans. Then you will most likely move to and expensive city for film such as LA or NYC where a most people are paying $700 to $1500 a month in rent.  your expenses sky rocket and when you move to said place you will begin at the bottom as PA. If your are thinking about going to USC. Just keep this is mind you won't be taking any film class in your first 2 years. Stay the away from Full Sail  Public university. Check In state school first and see if their is a film program that has strong alumni system in LA or NYC. Reason for in-state school is it would cost $10k or less a year for school. If you find an out of state school you like, find out the way to become a resident of the state and you will be able to get in-state tuition. Your goal should be to graduate with less than $30k in student loans.   Just take a gap year and move to LA, NYC, and ATL (NOLA is dead at the moment). Couple reason I say this.   1) the best education is being on professional set. If you start fresh out of high school you will be 4 years a head of your peers because once you graduate college you will start in the place. At the bottom as a PA.   2) You will not be paying for this education. You will learn it for free and eventually get paid or get lucky and get paid gigs right off the bat.  3) It gives you an idea if you actually want to work in this industry or not. It would suck to go to film school and getting to LA deciding film isn't for you.   4) at the end of the day no cares what school you went to. You know what people care about? They care about hard work, communication, and not being an asshole.   PM me if you have questions about life after school or you are consider moving to LA for a leap year."

Filmmakers,3e1e4w,SpeakThunder,2,Tue Jul 21 06:37:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks! What other festivals did you get into, if you don't mind my asking? Any especially good or bad experiences?  Also- Short or Feature?"
Filmmakers,3e1e4w,SpeakThunder,2,Tue Jul 21 06:38:31 2015 UTC,"It was a feature documentary. It got into 45+.  I don't mean to sound braggadocios or anything, but if you get a good premiere that whole 'circuit' thing just kind of happens. I'd say that most festivals are enjoyable and worthwhile. Sometimes, if you already have done a couple dozen it becomes a question of priorities because of the effort it takes to coordinate prints and marketing materials. If you are swamped with other parts of distribution you might not be able to accept some of the smaller fests, but I wouldn't turn my nose up at them just because they are small.  I'm not using a throwaway, so I prefer not to dish dirt on specific fests (But I might via PM)..."
Filmmakers,3e1e4w,SpeakThunder,2,Tue Jul 21 06:48:39 2015 UTC,"Totally understand. I had a friend last year go through that same experience you are talking about- the ball just starting to roll after the first submission. We haven't been as lucky, but are still out to a slew of the Fall/early Winter festivals, so I have hope. We shouldn't have 'turned our nose up' at some of the smaller/mid-sized fests in the first half of the year, but you live, you learn.   And appreciate whatever you want to dish in a PM. My film is a narrative feature."
Filmmakers,3e1e4w,SpeakThunder,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:51:26 2015 UTC,"What's the log line? Has it premiered elsewhere yet? Napa is a pretty good one, I'd definitely go with it if you have exhausted the  Sundance/SXSW/Toronto/Slamdance tier. Otherwise, you might as well wait until next year and try for San Francisco/Seattle/Sarasota/LA/New York. My two cents."
Filmmakers,3dyuvk,truesly1,2,Mon Jul 20 17:25:27 2015 UTC,I got to work with the Cion as an additional camera on an FS7 shoot recently but unfortunately  never got to see the results. From what I saw the dynamic range and ISO performance loomed like garbage so I'd be interested in seeing a side by side comparison in a controlled environment.
Filmmakers,3dyuvk,mexicojoe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:50:55 2015 UTC,"i have never used the cion so i'm probably wrong about this but to me it feels like that camera would have been a big deal in cinematography ten years ago when really the only ""cinema"" digital camera that looked good was the thomson viper filmstream camera."

Shots in front of test charts sitting in a room are useful, but they often don't break the camera the way shooting outside in daylight will."

Filmmakers,3e17fe,trentarant,2,Tue Jul 21 04:14:56 2015 UTC,"Congrats dude!   if people seem genuinely interested and want to hear the shpeal, i usually start by explaining who the DP is, and that they have three departments that work for them, Camera, Electric, and Grip. Camera does this, electricians do this. Then I sigh for dramatic effect...  Whenever a camera or lights have to go somewhere that isn't simply a stand or a tripod, grips will rig it. If lights or the camera have to go on a car; if lights have to be rigged up into the ceiling; etc. Grips support the camera department by pushing the dolly, a wheeled platform of variety of shapes, sizes, technologies, ranging from a piece of wood with a few wheels attached to it, to a pneumatic boom lift with machined parts for smooth, precision compound moves.   Grips also perform lighting adjustments, either by adjusting the quality of lights provided by electricians, diffusing the light with cloth or paper materials, various colors, thicknesses/opacities, etc. Shaping the light with rigid flags of black cloth of various thicknesses. Grips also utilize natural light, bouncing light with mirrors or other reflective surfaces, ranging from a square foot to several hundred square feet over entire streetsides.   anyway, thats usually what i tell people. most stick around to hear the whole thing. some people walk away, and i then i just cry a little."
Filmmakers,3e17fe,delsol10,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:18:30 2015 UTC,This is exactly what I was looking for. You rock dude. Thanks.
Filmmakers,3e17fe,swoofswoofles,2,Tue Jul 21 05:25:09 2015 UTC,"I just say I do the lighting. Simple enough.  When they do ask ""So what is a grip anyways"". I just tell them the electricians set up the lights and shine it on the set, then the grips make it look good, by setting up diffusion or taking the light off of walls or certain parts of the scene."

Filmmakers,3dzmet,itschrisreed,4,Mon Jul 20 21:10:30 2015 UTC,"Choosing reliable people is a good strategy. Who are your actors? Are they pros? Union members? Most people who are really ""in"" film understand that a film happens when it's scheduled to happen, and you don't just bail.   People are also excited about shooting (or at least committed to it) if you're paying them something or if the project is something worth getting excited about. If you seem like you're not putting in the effort, running it professionally, or know what you're doing, they'll be less invested. Without more details (how long is your schedule and how many people are in your cast/crew?) it's hard to give more advice. But if you're trying to arrange around everyone's schedules, you're gonna have a bad time. Pick a date and people can make themselves available or you can find someone else."
Filmmakers,3dzmet,D_Andreams,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:49:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, a little bit of money goes a very long way. If things start to go wrong then people are going to have no problem walking away because the hassel just isn't worth their time when they could be working on something else that is better for their career or bank account. Also if another job comes along then they will be more willing to stay with you if they are actually getting paid."
Filmmakers,3e16wh,TheJaguar77,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:09:53 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd just focus on honing your lighting techniques as opposed to learning another software. Pen and paper work just fine for overheads/diagrams when they're necessary. Unless you're doing a massive setup and have the time to devote to the mathematics of light/camera/logistics, as well as inputting it all into a program, software like you're describing doesn't do much for me. Plus, things inevitably need to be added, omitted, or tweaked pretty much always. As long as you've got a plan in place, no ones really going to mind wether it's a gorgeous laminated printout (as much as this would be appreciated) or something you doodled on a cocktail napkin."
Filmmakers,3e16wh,Chicityfilmmaker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:18:03 2015 UTC,"I down have lights right now, so I would rather practice lighting techniques with software than not practice lighting techniques.

Filmmakers,3dztvm,leopoldmedley,4,Mon Jul 20 21:32:02 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge Lovecraft fan too, but how many of his works could even be feasibly stretched into a feature? They're mostly very short stories, ne? Are you planning to take the kernel of the idea and develop it a lot to make a feature length script?"
Filmmakers,3dztvm,DarwinGoneWild,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:49:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the comment :)  Yes, I'm just looking for the one main overriding theme, the one cool concept, that one thing that just makes the story. Then I will apply that to a number of different, feature length plots. Ex: The Thing on The Doorstep: a friend changes souls and has to be killed. Call of Cthulhu: An investigator digs too deep and discovers something humans should never know (basically the theme of all his stories.) Dreams in the witch house: A character moves into a supposedly haunted house, commits crimes in his sleep via mind control.  Just that sort of thing, the one concept that makes the story."
Filmmakers,3dztvm,DarwinGoneWild,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:51:32 2015 UTC,"As much as I love The Outsider, the internal monologue and twist would make it virtually impossible to film.  Facts Concerning the Late Arthur Jermyn and His Family has an interesting anthropological and historical aspect and could work well as a film, but may have some racist overtones.  So my top 2 suggestions would have to be:   A Whisperer in Darkness or Shadow Over Innsmouth. I think they both have room to develop into a full feature and both have this great air of creepiness, with a lone person finding himself in a strange place with supernatural events. Whisperer would probably be easier for your budget since most of the horror is subtle, in shadows and voice."

Also this strikes a chord with me as I wear watch handed down to me from my dad that belonged to his dad. (Which also makes me want to point out, if you had managed to age the watch, it would have been perfect.)  Another suggestion would have been, if you would have played with the temperature/grading as you went back in time, it would have been a nice effect.  I do have one question, when the kid's holding it in his hand and you put the watch going backwards how long did you shoot the watch sequence, or did you process it somehow?"
Filmmakers,3dwpbq,jwdcollins,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:42:08 2015 UTC,Thanks for the kind and critical words!

Filmmakers,3dy4bs,HybridCamRev,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:23:47 2015 UTC,"From experience, with a $1000 budget, I recommend you avoid DSLRs.  I started out with a DSLR, but switched to mirrorless.  Here's why.  In your price range, Nikon DSLRs lack:   The ability to change aperture in Live View (video) mode a usable viewfinder when you switch to Live View compatibility with affordable power zoom lenses compatibility with silent, video optimized lenses (here is the problem with noisy Nikon autofocus motors) the ability to record for more than 30 minutes continuously an intervalometer   Canon DSLRs lack:   1080/60fps for smooth HD slow motion (they are limited to 30 frames per second) a usable viewfinder when you switch to ""Live View"" (video) mode compatibility with affordable power zoom lenses the ability to record for more than 30 minutes continuously an intervalometer   Plus, most DSLRs in your price range suffer from a phenomenon known as ""moire"" as the result of poor downscaling.  Panasonic G and GH cameras, for example, have a better downscaling algorithm. Here are a couple of side-by-sides between the Canon 60D and a moire-resistant Panasonic GH camera:   60D vs GH2 Moire Test Canon 60D vs Panasonic GH2 evil moiré test   Newer Canon cameras are not much better.  Here is a side-by-side between the Canon 60D and 70D:   Canon 70D and 60D moire comparison   Instead of a DSLR, you might want to consider the 4K Panasonic G7 mirrorless with the 14-140mm kit lens for $1098, or, if budget is an issue, with the 14-42 lens for $798 [Referral Links].  This camera has 4 times the video resolution of Nikon and Canon cameras in this price class, can record at 1080/60p for smooth slow motion, has an electronic viewfinder that keeps working when you shoot video, is compatible with affordable power zoom lenses, can record for hours continuously (very useful for recording plays, speeches, lectures and events) and features a built-in intervalometer for time lapse.  Here are a few examples of the video quality the G7 can produce:   Indianapolis 500 In 4k Away From The City ~ Panasonic G7 [4K] 42.5mm F1.7   And here are a couple of examples from YouTube (please watch at 2160p and your monitor's highest resolution):   LUMIX DMC-G7 Sample Video in 4K by Colin Witherill Panasonic Lumix G7 / G70 Launch - 4K - 4KPhoto Modes (shot in photo/video mode - each frame is an 8MP still photo)   It's a pretty good still camera too: https://www.flickr.com/groups/panasonic-lumix-g7/pool/  To be fair, the Nikon and Canon are probably better still cameras - but Panasonic G cameras are a much better all-around choice for both video and stills than a DSLR.  Hope this is helpful and good luck with whatever camera you decide to buy!"

Filmmakers,3dyjk0,jaanshen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:23:39 2015 UTC,"You're in luck that this particular effect element moves a lot, and in an organic manner. That means the viewer's eyes will be glued to the water and not the other stuff in shot, so you can get away with a lot actually.  This is the 'easiest"" way to get a useable shot, sans flooding an actual apartment floor, or calling a friend who's an ultra proficient professional specializing in RealFlow that will for some unknown reason do it for free.   Set up the shot you want, lit how you want it. Instead of shooting video, shoot high res stills with deepest depth of field. Also shoot around the edge of the desired frame as well. I imagine it will be something like a wall with a door and a floor in the shot. Take the high res photos of the shot and outside-of-frame edges into Photoshop and combine them into one big, high res image.  Cut out the door/wall part that is on the same plane and make it its own layer. It'll likely be a trapezoid-type shape. Use ""free transform"" to distort that photo until it looks geometrically straight-on (the edges/angles are all perpendicular), with the proper X and Y axis proportions. Do the same with the floor plane. Change the document's dimensions (ie. inches etc) so that the door/wall and floor layers are 75% of their actual real world size (or you can do 100% I guess). Get them printed on the thickest matte finish paper available at a Kinko's or wherever. Get two or three of each for backup. Buy two pieces of plywood (check the scrap pile at the hardware store's cutting station) and cut an inset gap (the ""under door gap"") that matches the same on the door/wall print.  Use Super 77 spray adhesive to glue the door/wall print to the plywood with the door gap inset. Glue the floor print to the other one.  Spray them with matte finish clear coat. Do like five coats. Attach the floor & door/wall plywood pieces using 90 degree corner braces. Recreate your desired camera angle with the 75% scale plywood fake door/wall & floor -- in a place/setup that is conducive to lots of water getting everywhere. It's probably best to use gravity to your advantage for the gushing effect and tilt the door/floor rig to some degree. Light it however will make the water look ""emotionally right"" without being too counter to the original lighting. You will probably want a semi-frontal soft light for the model (since it's lighting is ""glued"" to it already), and some kind of backlight for the water (you generally backlight refractive elements in order to make them visually read better). Also remember that high wattage lights + water = safety issues aka. electrocution. Use multiple hoses, sprayers, etc at once to gush water through the inset gap in the door/wall plywood. Shoot using the highest frame rate you have access to. Even when not meaning to have a slow-mo effect, things like water spectacle elements are nearly always shot overcrank to some degree in the Hollywood films that people are accustomed to seeing. Play it safe and shoot as slow-mo as you can… you can always speed it up in post. Shoot as many takes and angle/lens variations as you can get away with (to help in edit). Use really, really good realistic sound effects for the gushing water. Make sure that in the edit, the viewer hears those excellent sound effects before they see the model shot, even if for 12 frames. that way their brains have already ""decided what's happening"" and so the visual merely confirms what they already ""know"" rather than showing the visual first and thus their brain is momentarily trying to figure out what's happening and possibly scrutinizing the shot (and potentially noticing anything weird in the model).   Some thingees:  The reason this should be done with a stand-in model or miniature is because water refracts light. Meaning in every frame of the footage, there will be distorted versions of the imagery of whatever is behind the water, in the water, all over. Green screen footage of water won't give you this (at least without a lot of very clever & skillful tricks executed by a very talented professional compositor).  If you scrutinize the way the model door/wall/floor looks in the shot, you'll definitely see flaws. But the viewer won't. Because they're looking at all that gushing water because it's moving around a lot.  To help sell the shot, maybe put a rug or something on the ""floor"" that will move around via the water.  75% scale miniatures works okay with water (you can't scale water miniatur shots down to, say, 1/4 -- it looks fake) and makes for a more manageable model rig. If you want to play it safe you can do a 100% scale door/floor model.  Hope this somehow helps & best of luck."

Sometimes it is nice to make something for yourself man, and he understands that may not be the large audiences cup of tea, which is why he tells ya to go invest your time in another filmmaker.   Seriously, I know everyone on here is gung ho about the industry and making money in filmmaking, but shit, can't a guy decide that he wants to get some friends together and make something for themselves? He will flat out tell people that Yoga Hoser's is a film for his daughter so he can teach her filmmaking the same way he learned. Are the two movies going to suck? I don't know...probably.

Filmmakers,3dx3tg,TrickyTiger,3,Mon Jul 20 08:38:21 2015 UTC,"I do branded projects on budgets ranging from $5k to $50k depending on the level of production. However I am a YouTuber and charge based on viewership more so than hours worked. What I always do though is estimate out how long I think it will take me to shoot and what resources I think I will need, then propose a budget that will alot me what I think my time is worth above production costs. So for example if your work is worth $100/hr and production costs will be $1000 for a day of shooting (I always budget for my own equipment as well. So I am renting from myself and can flex prices easily if a brand needs to lessen budget a bit.), then assume that 10-12 hours of work is necessary then $2,200 plus some extra to account for potential extra hours just incase. I do this for my base production costs then charge additional ammounts for access to my audience and depending on estimated viewership for a project. If it is a project that can garner an easy 500k views then I charge more than for a project I expect 50k views on etc. Usually based on a $50 per 1000 views type scale. (Above production cost)  Anyway, that is just my own process for branded projects. This will vary a ton for everyone and that dynamic will be unique to some extent from company to company. It all just depends on the work required."

I'm not always right, but I am pretty damn good at getting close estimates and know how to take a lot of the question marks out of getting viewership with videos that have the quality of content and production to make that happen. I do mini campaigns for each video release.  Haha I usually estimate low as well when quoting an estimate for a client. It is always good to have leeway for more success than what they were expecting. Also, I try not to do actual guarantees in viewership unless they have the budget to back the promotional strategy to get a lot more viewership than what was quoted."
Filmmakers,3dx3tg,itschrisreed,2,Mon Jul 20 18:22:24 2015 UTC,"I directed branded content and ads. Each job is different as the length of the content effects the cost way less then basically anything else.  If this is proper filmmaking you NEVER charge less then scale for every position. Period.   Personally I don't often take on jobs with a budget much lower then $30,000 unless its something special.   If you are doing videography then you will make way less because you aren't doing the same thing."

The whole video is done by just me.  I was hoping someone had experience being the sole person behind a work as well."
Filmmakers,3dx3tg,Skapo007,2,Mon Jul 20 17:47:34 2015 UTC,"Videographers do vastly different things form directors, producers, DPs, ACs, Grips, Gaffers, UPMs, ADs, PA, PSRs, PSMs, and all other types of 'filmmakers' thusly they are paid vastly different wages.  If you are turning up to shoot a thing that is happening, you are a videographer.  If you work with actors to craft a performance central to a narrative you are a director.   Both videographers and directors do vital work, the difference is like that between a surgeon and a paramedic. When you need a paramedic, a surgeon is mostly useless; and when you need a surgeon, a paramedic is mostly useless. Also although you can find them both in a hospital the pay of paramedics and surgeons are determined by vastly different market forces.   Bonus points: on set we will often have a director (me!) who works with the actors etc, and a videographer, who captures the making of the ad/ film for BTS or EPK purposes."

Filmmakers,3dx0js,f_o_t_a,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:07:19 2015 UTC,"Lacking any agreement in writing, the writer probably has ownership to the script, which is a fixed and final work. But the director will probably retain ownership of the plot etc if they where given in writing in a format resembling an outline or treatment which are also 'fixed and finalized'. It really depends on what the director gave the writer and in what format it was given.  Obviously you cannot own the concept a love story but you can own your specific love story.  For details you will have to talk to a lawyer who specializes in film and copyright law, I can point you to a great one if you'd like, but you have to pay him.   If you have a draft from a writer that you are not happy with, generally it will be cheaper to buy it anyway and pay a new writer to re-write it. This is generally how the studios do it to avoid lawsuits."
Filmmakers,3dx0js,itschrisreed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:05:13 2015 UTC,"Depends completely on the conditions of the agreement signed between the two parties and how copyright holding is stipulated.   The director can hire and pay the screenwriter to draft a script based on XYZ and completely maintain the copyright to the screenplay if it's stated as such and signed before work commences.   The contract may also stipulate the credits, which may say Screenplay by Writer X, story by Director Z. All depends on the contract.   If there wasn't one, then the screenplay copyright will be owned by the screenwriter. If there is a paper trail of any kind clearly showing certain ideas were from the director then it could be contested.   Remember that you can't copyright an idea, you can only copyright the expression of an idea.  FYI I am not a lawyer, best to do your own research."

Then writing (and/or production and direction) is you niche. Develop those skills. Write every day.   But the 10-12 hour days I hear people talk of seen VERY daunting.   It goes by quick and is really fun and rewarding, unless you are a below the line bloke with manual labor to do that could be replaced by a robot IMO.   I space out when I hear/see people talk about different types of film used, lens details, all that shit.   That part is hard. Obviously, cinematography is not in your future. You would love this techie talk if it was.   Whenever I see these artsy fartsy student films, I just see them as boring.   What is an acclaimed film you find too fartsy? This is weird...   Do any of my complains/doubts not justify me going into film?   It is a little weird that you have zero interest in classics. Some are boring by modern standards, but some are golden. You will face scrutiny and skepticism for avoiding classics."
Filmmakers,3dxel5,Lonny_zone,3,Mon Jul 20 10:30:50 2015 UTC,"I'll add that it's weird you find the Marvel movies so much fun but don't like slow/arty films- many big-budget directors start, for obvious reasons, with slower, character-focused stuff. Colin Treverrow did Safety Not Guaranteed before Jurassic World, Christopher Nolan did Following and Memento before Inception and The Dark Knight, and James Gunn made Super, which is definitely on the darker slower side, before he made Guardians of the Galaxy.  There are good reasons why slower, arty films are important. Even if you don't want to make them, cultivating an appreciation of them can help in the long run. I recommend the road less travelled- Night of the Hunter, Enter The Void, and most Werner Herzog films are good examples of films that are very arty but not boring at all (imho)."

Low budget indie grinders, major network episodic series, corporate videos, commercials... pretty much the full range of whatever you can work on in a variety of different positions within art, props and special effects.    I personally love it.  Especially when you consider the alternative is probably being a cube farmer in some corporate suck job or something in customer service.  Now, I may not love it while it is happening sometimes, but at the end of the day, this field still keeps a smile on my face.  10 to 12 hour days are going to be the norm in pretty much any professional career field you go into these days.  In the film industry, 10 hour days are a luxury.  A full time gig, working 10 hour days on a soundstage is like hitting the damn lottery.    And yes, many ""classic"" films are boring when viewed at face value.  They get very interesting when you watch them through your own creative lens.  Marvel movies are a lot of fun, but keep in mind that those big action sequences are little more than cartoons with a live actor or two edited into them.  Take a big battle scene in a film like Patton or Lawrence of Arabia and then consider how many elements had to all come together to make that scene flow so effortlessly."

However, there are a few guidelines.)  In order for something to be considered fair use, it has to critique/review or parody the work being used. Example: in a book review, you may want to include quotations from the book. That is the type of thing fair use is for."
Filmmakers,3dx4hg,Sandtalon,2,Mon Jul 20 14:01:26 2015 UTC,"First question that must be answered to answer your question: what country are you in?   ""Fair use"" is a country-specific term: it varies by country.   For example, in the US, Fair Use it's a defense that can be brought up in a copyright case, and it includes various provisions including ""transformative use"". By contrast, the ""fair dealing"" (NOT ""Fair Use"" - if you want to sound like a noob to a UK copyright lawyer, start talking about ""fair use"" rather than ""fair dealing"") clauses in the UK's copyright law do not include any ""transformative use"" provision.    It's also worth noting that in film the legality of the situation is rarely your primary concern when it comes to copyright, unless your intention is purely to self-distribute. If' you're looking at getting distribution deals, the copyright status that distributors are happy with is more important, and may be radically different to what is technically legal. For example, it's entirely possible to use a brand's logo in your film entirely legally (in your country of origin) and find that no distributor is willing to touch the film as a result."

I may not be the most qualified person in the world for filmmaking, but I can tell you at least this statistic: 100% of films you've seen, more than just the writer saw the script. How can you expect anyone to want to make this without reading it first? It makes no sense. It's like you're selling an iPhone but not letting people see the device or its features before they buy it.   I am afraid it will get bit   This may sound harsh, but you really need to stop.

Of course, getting an agent will cost money in itself, and I don't know how serious about this you are; not to mention if an agent will take you on if you only have one script under your belt, but I could be entirely wrong about that. I assume you're interested in film as you are taking a screenwriting class; so maybe there's some of your peers who have some connections of their own or would like to work on the film with you. You can rent most equipment for shooting a movie, and you can buy some of the smaller bits outright (shotgun mic, lavalier, reflectors, etc.) And also, if you do find some willing fellow-students odds are, you might not have to pay them at all if they are enthusiastic about making a movie.

I felt the baseball anecdote, although well written and strongly acted, served no purpose.    This was all one scene. I think this hurt the short. It made your camera work (although initially attractive) repetitive, and made the piece drag, losing my attention.    I myself did not entirely understand the ending. I won't say that's your fault though, I've misinterpreted many film endings. I would like to know what exactly you meant though.    The fundamentals are there, clearly. You certainly have the potential to create something wonderful. You should focus less on flashy, ambiguous writing and put more emphasis on creating a formulaic narrative that give your characters motivation."
Filmmakers,3dwjy0,AwesomeDracula,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:47:48 2015 UTC,"Woah, thanks for the feedback! I was kind of uncomfortable with how the whole project turned out and I think you put it into words why. Keeping the viewer entertained is probably a good start...  As pretentious/bullshitty as it sounds we wanted the ending to be just a bleak open-ending. It didn't transfer so well but my initial idea was to get the viewer to enjoy the characters' banter and like the characters but in the end realize they still go through with something morally bad. They were selling a kid and I was trying to set up that maybe one of the characters would change his mind, but in the end he still goes through with it."
Filmmakers,3dwjy0,AwesomeDracula,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:35:24 2015 UTC,"Okay, that makes sense. I really enjoyed the banter. I thought that was really well done. However due to the nature of shorts and them being, well, short, it felt the focus was more on writing as opposed to narrative. Remember that you as the filmmaker are telling a story. Writing is incredibly difficult and I believe you (or your writer) have a strong way with words. Now you must learn to master the idea of a story and character arc.    For a high school short, this is fantastic. Both your cinematography and audio are sharp and on point, which is so incredibly important for young filmmakers. You did a lot of things right for such a young age, and I hope my critique did not seem overly negative. I wanted to make sure you knew what exactly I felt lacked from the short.    All too often, when asking for feedback, the audience will tell you, ""Wow, you made that? That was awesome, you're so talented."" I wanted to make sure you (hopefully) received some sound advice so you can work on your weaknesses for the next piece.    Which I damn well want to see, by the way. I'm excited to see how you will work on your craft. So go out there and do that shit friend."

Maybe go out and shoot more to get more shots. Also it was a bit short, with the end credits and opening intro it was only ~40 secs.   Here's my reel for comparison. I made sure it was right around the 90 sec mark, and included all the different types of shots I had in a exciting and quick way."
Filmmakers,3dvq92,Speed92211,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:05:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it is extremely short. The last time the biggest critique was that it was too long so I cut back on the time( probably too much)."

Where are you filming, though? I wanna go there. See if I can even do any better myself. Were you skydiving in one part?"
Filmmakers,3dvq92,Speed92211,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:52:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comment. It is my first reel, and after watching his more a few more times, the pacing is nice and the cuts are good, but it still feels a little lacking for some reason to me.  That video is comprised of clips from Central America, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. And I wasn't skydiving, I had a drone. Or maybe your referring to the scuba diving shot where I'm jumping off the boat."

To me, it dramatizes everything actors do. You make that Napoleon Dynamite dude look like Al Pacino.  Is it short overall? Sure. But the pacing is money. For people with style like us (Coen Bros., Terrence Malik), you rock. You've show all you need to show. I think the right eyes will find it."

Filmmakers,3duldh,NoobBeast,6,Sun Jul 19 17:02:58 2015 UTC,You're young this is a good time to pick up some books and learn to screen write. Write some drafts then bring it to a more experienced writer to develop
Filmmakers,3duldh,incocknedo,3,Sun Jul 19 17:40:08 2015 UTC,"You can try r/screenwriting . Also it's really cool you wanna find someone.  You are letting someone bring out your dreams. I know a lot of people who would just write it and it would be bad but because of ego they want the ""fame"" of saying they wrote, directed, and did everything"
Filmmakers,3duldh,Sablerage,2,Sun Jul 19 17:28:04 2015 UTC,"I was your age when I started (26 now). I still have all of my old movies. KEEP BACKUPS! And save everything! When I was your age I'd just record over the same minidv tape, so I don't have a lot of those awesome videos anymore.  Since you're editing and directing, I'd say throw together what you like in whatever format makes sense to you. Also, from experience, if you have something too long or with too many actors, you might get through half of it before people start dropping out. Make it short, something you can do in a few hours at most. Be prepared for putting a lot of work into something only to have friends disappoint you sometimes. But also be prepared to have fun and be proud of the incredible movie you made.  Writing a script for you would be a little more tough because we don't know what kind of resources you have or how many actors you can get and other things. That's why I think either you should write it or sit down with friends that are interested in doing that and collaborate with them. Collaboration is one of the greatest things about filmmaking.  But if you can't get enough actors, there are always creative solutions. When I was 11 or 12 I made a parody of the movie ""Die Hard"" with me as Bruce Willis, my dog Hershey as the bad guys, and random stuffed animals and other clips I was taping over as other people. It's called, ""Live Hard."" This is a trailer I cut for it when I was about 16 and 're-releasing' it online: https://vimeo.com/16802427  I can post a link to the full video if you'd like.  P.S. The main job of a director is to make sure everyone is comfortable and trusts in your vision. Always be very kind and patient. The people you're working with are helping you out, so always be nice to them as their leader. Make sure to tell them that they're doing a great job all the time. Even if it's the fiftieth take, say 'That was good,' or, 'That was great! But ...' Never tell them they're bad, just tell them what you'd like to see them do and think of polite ways to direct them to do it. Mean and tyrannical directors aren't fun to make movies with, and making movies should always be fun (and a lot of work too), so, as the director, try to always keep everyone's spirits up and help them do the best they can do."

Keep this Idea alive AND FINISH IT, even if you don't like the final result, at least finish it.  I cannot give you insights about the story plot, but I can give you a valuable tip: Read. More. If you already a reader, read more than you are reading now. This is probably the solution to all problems in life, but when we talk about creative ideas, like plots, reading is the key. You wouldnt need to ask us if you have infinite stories locked up in your brain. Do the same as you did with the face/off reference. find new references in sci-fi's about mind switching, comas, etc...  Good luck!"

Filmmakers,3dvlp6,instantpancake,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:19:20 2015 UTC,"I guess when I referred 60 minutes, I really meant the format more than anything else!   Let me rephrase my question this way. If I wanted to make my own youtube channel and put up silly videos for entertainment, what type of camera would I need to be able to record 1080p videos with good sound (willing to buy a separate microphone if that adds a lot of quality).  I don't think I'm at the level that you guys are assuming I might be at! :P"
Filmmakers,3dvlp6,instantpancake,0,Mon Jul 20 12:33:56 2015 UTC,"First off: I do by no means mean to discourage you.   Yes, if you want your audio to sound somewhat decent, you will need audio gear - at least a proper microphone. Assuming you can't afford an ENG-style camera (which is equipped to record proper on-board audio, this means you'll need an external solution. I'm not from the US, and therefore not really familiar with 60 minutes, but from what I've gathered, it's a higher-standard ENG-style format (correct me if I'm wrong). A ballpark estimate for the typical kit here would be $50,000, possibly more. This doesn't mean you can't get get decent results for significantly less, but gear is expensive, particularly when you're aiming higher than Youtube/Vimeo distribution (i. e. broadcast standard)."

I liked the set design when she was running her hands along it  Loved the close up on her hitting the lock and then the shot of her taking that deep breath against the door.  the shower shots were done well  The only thing i wasn’t a huge fan of was the light reflections when he drank from his wine glass for the first time. really like the shot of them at opposite sides of the table  I wish there was a bit more shots of the fight, i felt like there was a big build up and then it was over faster than i expected.  Im not sure if that was his gf or his sister  All in all i really liked it! Held my attention well and the song was really good. I personally love music videos where the band/singer isnt involved. How did you end up shooting this? Was it their idea or yours?"
Filmmakers,3du56l,bankdank,2,Sun Jul 19 19:02:30 2015 UTC,"Hi, thanks for the very detailed feedback! It was my idea, started from a simple visual of a man wearing a suit walking past a homeless girl and went from there. I took some pictures for the band during one of their gigs and then pitched them the idea luckily they were into it. Budget was $300 and we shot on a GH4 with a 50 and 85mm Nikkor AIS and the 12-35 Panasonic zoom lens."
Filmmakers,3du56l,kmmk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:59:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with bankdank. I thought some shots were not needed/too long and could have helped make more room for a longer fight.  00:42 - 00:55 that shot is a bit long and doesn't tell us much more new information. The shots of the guy walking around the apartment while the girl takes a shower. I understand why you want to cut back to him.. but him wandering around doesn't really bring anything to the piece. Maybe he could have been doing something? like getting dressed himself or preparing something.. or getting some object related to the plot. The whole segment at the table feels too long. I understand you need to build up the tension and having him getting mad right away would be weird but this part goes back and forth between the same two shots and her reactions aren't really worth showing. I would have liked a single longer shot on the man.. and ideally less boring framing. Maybe centering him with the camera above the table.. I liked the wide shot and I wish you would have stayed longer on it.  Also, considering she suddenly stand up and he catches her, I don't think you even needed to show him be really mad or anything. We would understand that he said something. Finally, when he grabs her arm, I liked that you realize he is the one who needs the most help/comfort, not her."
Filmmakers,3du56l,myromm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:42:33 2015 UTC,"Hi, thanks for the response. The shots of him while she is in the shower are meant to show him laying out a dress for her to wear. The fact that that didn't come through means we should've made that more clear, but I wasn't too sure how to best structure that section.   Your comments about shot lengths is probably the biggest issue we dealt with. If I could do it over I would meticulously plan out the length of each shot, but because I didn't we had to alter the length of many of the shots to time them with certain parts of the song. I agree with the dinner scene, definitely needed more angles/coverage and I could have pushed the female actor a bit more to get some larger reactions out of her. Again cheers for the criticism, its really helpful."
Filmmakers,3dv7ro,delriomotel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:12:01 2015 UTC,For the US they need to fill out IRS form W-9 and depending on how much you pay them you may need to send them a 1099-MISC in January.

I would not have them fill out a W-9 as you would then be misclassifying them as an independent contractor when they are actually an employee.   http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Independent-Contractor-Self-Employed-or-Employee  You tell them where to be at what time, when to take lunch, when to go home, and they are an integral of your business as a filmmaker. They cannot lose money from the deal as you are just paying them for their time. If you look at the questions to ask when you click that link you'll find that it's pretty clear they are an employee.  I don't want to scare you away from doing things properly too much, but I do want to warn you about the risks of doing them improperly. If you are hiring a lot of people over the course of the year, just imagine if one of them were to fill out form SS-8:  http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fss8.pdf  Then the IRS comes in and starts poking around and they realize every single person you have hired is actually an employee and not an independent contractor. Now you're on the hook for back taxes for every person you've hired that year, maybe more. I'm sure there are penalties involved as well.   Then what if someone hurts themselves? You are supposed to have workers comp. set up for all of your employees. If someone does hurt themselves, they are going to come after you when they find out how much they owe. Now you are in a lengthy legal battle and be on the hook for probably their full medical bills. In america we all know how costly those will be.  I have a small business of my own and I was a little nervous about how complicated it would be to do things the right way, but at the same time with grips hanging big rigs above people heads and electricity all around, the danger of someone getting hurt was too real, and the last thing I would want is for all of my assets to be wiped out because of one bad business decision.  I don't hire too many people over the course of the year, so workers comp. was only about $800 a year, but will vary depending on wages. The payroll costs for me are about $50 a month, not including quarterly taxes.   If you wanted to do this properly, get a payroll company, have them fill out form I-9 and  W-4.  http://www.irs.com/articles/what-new-hire-tax-forms-do-employees-have-to-fill-out  If you want to risk things, don't have them fill out anything. When you have them fill out form W-9 you are putting them on the hook for all of their social security and other taxes, actually costing them more. Instead...just give them cash!"

Filmmakers,3dv7ro,swoofswoofles,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:57:04 2015 UTC,"Actors are always independent contractors, not employees, like all ABL positions on any film ever. Also this is why they have a Guild (Screen Actors Guild) and not a Union (like IATSE Local 52).  I'm not a tax lawyer, I don't know why its this way, I just know that it is this way. I think it has to do with something about the level of investment actors put into themselves. For example they are almost certainly losing money on one $150 gig giving the cost of acting training, working out, dietitian, expensive hair cuts and other aesthetic things, that are required to get the gig as an actor. Thinks an employee would be paid for (paid training etc)."
Filmmakers,3dv7ro,itschrisreed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:00:17 2015 UTC,"Well, even though they have a lot of expenses, it doesn't really change the employer employee relationship that exists. However, what might have happened for you in the past is they have had a loan out corporation. Doing that makes a lot of sense for people making really good money with lots of expenses. They are able to get their money tax free, spend it on their expenses to get work, including payroll taxes, then pay themselves a monthly stipend through a payroll company from the huge amount of money they've got. This way they don't get a huge chunk taken by Uncle Sam before they are to spend their money for their business.   Ill be totally honest, not an accountant either, but I just keep finding things that stregthen this idea.  http://www.avvo.com/legal-answers/paid-actors-on-a-indie-film--independent-contracto-1211963.html  http://www.avvo.com/legal-answers/what-is-a-loan-out-corporation-and-how-to-get-one-25971.html  Here is a little blurb that explains loan out corps better than I can.  Loan out corps seem great for the employer, but the actor must have a corporation in order for you to do it like this. Incorporating is around 800 a year minimum, depending on gross income. I don't think many making 150 a day are going to do that so their employer can save a buck."

Filmmakers,3dtrl2,Nazoragoth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:02:22 2015 UTC,"Shorts are better uses of money in terms of getting experience and exposure (because it's a lot easier to get a solid short into a festival than it is to get an amateur feature into one). Features are easier to sell, and thus can make more money, but can also fall apart far more spectacularly and represent a much huger input cost.   Basically, making shorts on a shoestring budget is understood and accepted, while making a feature on a shoe-string better god damned look like you spent millions on it, or else it's worth bupkis."
Filmmakers,3dtrl2,RichardMHP,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:18:01 2015 UTC,"Shorts are great and necessary practice, but personally I wouldn't pour a lot of my own money into one UNLESS it was a short based on a feature or TV script I had and the plan was to use the short to get funding for the bigger project. That way there is at least a plan for a return on your investment. Just a normal short film, however, will almost never reap the benefits that would make it worth spending your own money on."
Filmmakers,3dtrl2,filmsaremyjam,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:37:11 2015 UTC,"Step 1. Produce no-budget shorts as a learning and training experience for you and your whole cast & crew.  Step 2. When you're confident enough in your skills, and have a worthy, bulletproof screenplay, invest on a high profile short film that will promote your abilities to agents and producers. High quality shit for festivals. Your calling card to the world.  Step 3. After many screenings, meetings and fests, you'll have enough cred to attract producers and investors to your first feature film.   TL;DR: Don't attempt to invest your money in a low profile/low budget feature with limited exposure that will take you nowhere. It's better to invest in a high profile/high budget short instead."

Filmmakers,3drmjy,MaxFischer9891,16,Sat Jul 18 20:04:49 2015 UTC,"Not really a fan of this... This is one part a guide for what the AV club likes, one part ""do this technique... Or the exact opposite!""   This is a Buzzfeed style list that doesn't actually tell how to make good action. Build a good world? OK, that's like step 1, 2, and 3 for any screenwriter. Practical effects? I'm sorry, but I'm tired of hearing this one, practical effects can be super dangerous, and with talented VFX artists you can do just as well. Nonstop action? No, that's almost never OK, unless you're one hell of a director, working on one hell of a script. Setpieces? That goes for every movie ever, from arthouse to blockbuster. Any half-baked movie will at least try to get most bang for buck on the set pieces.   This the action movie equivalent of reddit's ""how to get girls"" strategy (step one, be attractive...). Says nothing about actually making the movie.   EDIT: I don't think I'm being fair to the AV club.  I don't like the article, but it's clearly intended for a more accessible audience.  Ebert this is not."
Filmmakers,3drmjy,tigerbait92,2,Sun Jul 19 00:04:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of your points, but your point about VFX being just as good as practical effects is ridiculous and has been shown to be wrong over and over. Did you see Mad Max Fury Road? Imagine that film with 90% VFX...it would be a vastly inferior film. If you have the talent necessary to do practical effects, it will almost always be better."
Filmmakers,3drmjy,filmsaremyjam,2,Sun Jul 19 13:49:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I haven't seen Fury Road (exams, then summer school all got in the way), so I can't comment.  I just have a kneejerk reaction to the whole VFX < Practical thing.  CGI has done wonders in tech leaps, as well as has so much potential, that I get a little defensive of it, even when practical effects can be leaps better (for example, the rotating hallway in Inception is something that couldn't be done nearly as excellently in CGI; this coming from a guy who couldn't care less of Nolan)"

No article like this can be more than it is without encouraging you to do exactly the same thing as someone else. A list of step by step instructions would only produce a whole bunch of copy cats.

It had a lot more character and edge (no, 4chan, not that kind) than many others.  That said, it felt like a travesty in the story department outside of the beginning, and the ending was a generic fight against the ""big bad"", despite the fact that Wick should have been able to curbstomp his ass.  A LOT could have been done to make the interludes between action sequences actually feel meaningful.  It felt like good action with filler junk mixed in to justify the action."

Filmmakers,3dqg02,positivemusic,3,Sat Jul 18 23:12:51 2015 UTC,"I got into composing at a young age, around 13. I'm 16 right now, and I guess just a lot of dedication and perseverance is key. For a long time I saw no results, because I was in the process of getting good. However, I always found that the best thing was to imagine the music inside my head, and then be able to translate that into my music. Ridding myself of that barrier really brought me forward as a composer.  I'm not sure what you mean about the studio or digital, because they're not mutually exclusive. I have set up a sort-of studio in my room, and use a mixture of digital synthesis as well as recording instruments. In this song's case, I played everything on a MIDI keyboard, designed the sounds, and the guitar and 'whisper' parts were played by me."
Filmmakers,3dsft4,ParanoidHeathen,6,Sun Jul 19 00:36:41 2015 UTC,"If a short is more than 8 minutes I usually don't bother, and yet I watched the Baby in its entirety. Why is that? The opening shot is intriguing. The main characters are two young girls. That's unusual in a low budget film like this. So often it's white college kids. The girls, who aren't half bad, aren't heavily scripted either. They're allowed to adLib which goes a long way into making us care about them.  I didn't care that the sound was bad, that the auto focus was on, the auto white balance engaged, the purely ambient lighting. It didn't matter because the storytelling was assured. I felt like the director was in control.  I liked the framing of the two girls next the tree as they look toward the mouth of the woods. I love the shot where the one sister returns from there. I generally like that the shots are wide and unbroken. It's a more European sensibility that works here.   This felt like the practice run before you're given a modest budget and get to really bring the story to life. It's heartening to see that you didn't let your technical deficit stop you from making a film. You made it anyway and triumphed."
Filmmakers,3dsft4,agentphelps,5,Sun Jul 19 08:35:47 2015 UTC,Terribly inconsistent audio and lighting throughout. Poor audio is a deal-breaker for me. Most audiences will tolerate poor video but not bad audio.  Tell us about the equipment and software you used.
Filmmakers,3dsft4,faxinator,2,Sun Jul 19 02:32:13 2015 UTC,"So I first started editing with vigor in 2012 . I was 22 and working on whatever pirated editing-software my used, P.O.S. PC could handle. All this to say, I believe I understand the struggles that come with reliance upon inferior equipment.  I cannot tell you how many viewers I lost to comments like the one above. It sucks, but it's just too true: inferior sound/lighting is the indie-filmmaker's Achilles' Heel.   One solution I started working with before I bit the bullet and gassed my own budget: angles. The intro is one minute and six seconds of a single, long-shot. I love long takes. I'm the kind of guy who's mind makes up stuff, driving himself insane wondering why I'm looking at what I'm looking at. I love it, I really do. But you never justified my generosity. I gave my full attention and got nothing for it (speaking only of the initial shot. The story was actually more intriguing than I expected. A pleasant surprise).  Try this: put a Dutch tilt on it for no freakin' reason. Throw a down tilt in there. Make something we don't want to stop looking at. It's your world. Take us there however you want. But get that audio equipment upgraded. It's a war out here and that's your chest-plate: don't leave home without it.  Does anyone think a little added contrast might help the lighting?"

Had no intention of being professional production-wise, as we were just having fun, but did what I could with zero dollars and the one camera on hand. I've always been criticized for my audio in my work, but it's just never been the biggest factor for me. I prefer visuals and body language, honestly. I don't expect my stuff to screen at festivals or get thrown on the big screen. (Although, if I were to ever get a budget and crew, I surely would in a heartbeat.)"
Filmmakers,3dsft4,faxinator,3,Sun Jul 19 18:44:58 2015 UTC,"Better sound would improve your results dramatically. I encourage you to seek out ways to improve the sound quality of your productions. Shooting on a phone is fine. Consider the option of mic-ing each actor with their own mic and using a smartphone to record the audio. There are apps out there for that purpose, AND you can easily convert a pair of ear buds into a cheap-o lavalier mic (see YouTube for how to do that).  Basically no money, but it will improve your production quite a bit."

Filmmakers,3dsbzu,cultur_e,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:08:33 2015 UTC,I couldn't agree more. Investing in a professional crew is ALWAYS worth the extra cash.
Filmmakers,3dsbzu,itschrisreed,4,Sun Jul 19 04:46:16 2015 UTC,"The money side of film works like this:  You either have the type of film where you can raise what you need to make it; or you make the type of film you can with what you have.  Writing 100' Technocrane moves with bullet hits into your no budget feature with no attachments just isn't going to work (unless you have a100' Technocrane and are an explosives guy, but then you'd probably be able to get someone attached).  So save that stuff and make the kind of film that you can make correctly with whatever it is you actually have access to."
Filmmakers,3dsbzu,cultur_e,3,Sun Jul 19 03:18:54 2015 UTC,"The answer is always ""more than you think.""  Reach out to cast/crew, cut cost as much as possible, and then work with it further. Each project is a different animal and cast/crew cost will differ on many things.  Like 90% of things in filmmaking, there isn't a formula. Your job is to make the financials of your project work, and you can do it.   Also, keep in mind that SAG will always be a pain in the ass, so prepare for that unless you want to go non-Union."
Filmmakers,3dsbzu,jh32488,2,Sun Jul 19 00:57:01 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, the unions. Is there a significant consequence if you go non-union?"
Filmmakers,3dsbzu,cultur_e,2,Sun Jul 19 02:13:46 2015 UTC,There are tons of pros and cons depending on your point of view.  If you're doing a feature you'll likely need over a million to afford Union rates on the SUPER low end.   I just finished script supervising a union film. With low budgets they have tiered rates. Look up IATSE low budget agreement to see the rates.
Filmmakers,3dsbzu,jh32488,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:18:37 2015 UTC,"No consequence. In fact, some of the most renegade talent I've found chooses non-Union. Yeah, you can find solid talent in SAG (of course), but if you find a non-Union actor you don't have to file a ton of paperwork and they've usually gone rogue for a reason.   I recommend it."
Filmmakers,3dsbzu,darknessvisible,2,Sun Jul 19 04:43:37 2015 UTC,"No set percentage in the super low/no budget world.  The main thing that matters is how many shooting days you're going to need. So breakdown and schedule the script. Thats step one.  That tells you how many days you have to: pay crew, rent gear, pay for catering, pay actors, etc.  Then you take the budget you have and spread it across those days."
Filmmakers,3dsbzu,listyraesder,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:23:52 2015 UTC,Pre-Productions is key. Make sure to have everything set on paper to have an idea of the total cost. Got it. Thanks!

Filmmakers,3dsqsa,quinnthefilmmaker,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:29:50 2015 UTC,"This is a movie I finished working on that used a lot of footage shot on 16mm. Yes, you can do realistic VFX composites on 16mm. Just make sure you match the film grain.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fChx_YZUAR0"
Filmmakers,3dsqsa,PhotoshopKid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:56:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the reply, i'm guessing the 16mm shots were the old reels of film the kid found or were there some actual shots in the movie filmed on 16mm?"
Filmmakers,3dsqsa,VulGerrity,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:44:18 2015 UTC,"I don't know who is saying that you can't do realistic composites on 16mm.  Black Swan was shot on 16mm (the 5D stuff was only on the subway, and other low light situations where they couldn't set up equipment).  I don't have the source files handy, but I shot this film in college on 16mm and had 2K scans made.  I know it's not the same, but feel free to download the video and play with it.  I wouldn't recommend shooting on 250D unless absolutely everything you're going to shoot is going to be outside in broad daylight.  Even then, it might be better to shoot on 500T.  If you get 250D and you need to shoot inside (with a CC Filter, you're shooting like 120), you're extremely limited cause you'll need to blast a lot of light to be able to get a good exposure.  You can always put ND filters on if you need to lower your exposure or open up, but you can only open up your lens so much if you need to raise your exposure.  There also really isn't a noticeable increase in grain between the 250D and the 500T.  I learned this mistake on the film I linked.  Everything inside/night was shot on 500T, and the daylight stuff was 250D.  My budgeting for film was extremely tight, and I thought I'd be able to get away with shooting the one daylight interior scene on the 250D, but I didn't have NEARLY enough light.  Sadly, the 250D I had bought needed to be used for this scene since the remainder of my 500T needed to be used for other scenes.  So I had to send my actors and non-essential crew away and spend 30min blasting the apartment with light.  It works, especially since it's a weird little film, but the light does look artificial.  Also, just so you know, all of the exterior night exterior scenes were shot with only existing lighting.  About a year after I made this film I had a cinematography teacher finally tell me that there really isn't any reason why you should shoot on anything but 500T, for all the reasons listed above.  It's just much more versatile.  Just some extra food for thought...do they still make Vision 2?  I shot my film on Vision 3 cause I thought it had better contrast and didn't blow out as much if I pointed it at a light, but I know a lot of people still prefer to shoot on Vision 2 because it's much flatter which allows for more control in color grading.  I can't remember, but it's possible Vision 3 had smaller grain too.  Lastly, where are you going to get your film processed?  All the places I used to get it done have gone out of business, or stopped doing film :("
Filmmakers,3dsqsa,devotchko,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:06:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the reply, 500t does sound better for me and the little bit of extra grain should not be a problem because i'm a sucker for film grain. As far as developing places I live outside of nyc so I would go in to the city to get it developed, looking at the following places http://www.colorlab.com/ http://magnoscreening.com/post-production-services http://www.doicamera.com/movietransfer.htm the last place looks a little sketchy but I might have to go with them if i'm on a tight budget"
Filmmakers,3dsqsa,devotchko,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:49:17 2015 UTC,"The problem with composites in 16mm is that there is only 1 registration pin in the camera, adding some pitching and weaving (more than what you would get with 35mm, which has 2 pins). I guess if would be technically possible if you could stabilize all the layers individually, but wouldn't it be a pain in the ass? The results may not be acceptable either. Apparently it can be done now if you have the resources of Black Swan, but that was the main reason to avoid 16mm for composites in the past."

I'm still choosing to answer your question though as I did change my name and am still making the same music: My old project was named with the intent of it being a band a friend and I formed but she kept telling me she couldn't do her part and it frustrated me so I more or less kicked her out (we did have a talk I didn't just kick her out and we are still friends), turned it into a solo project and simply didn't change the name. The previous name was kind of jokey and I want to put a lot more seriousness into this project, plus I kind of want to remove this projects connection to my old 'band' (for lack of a better term) and we don't really talk anymore so I don't want to keep ties that are not there you know? But the overarching answer is I just want to inject more seriousness into this project as I shift toward a more minimal classical sound."

The biggest thing would be that I'm not sure what story you were trying to tell, it could just be someone walking into church and then leaving but it feels like you might be trying to say more. Something minor is when the phone starts ringing, I feel like if it was on vibrate it would flow better with your audio but it is just a personal choice I would've made. The composition of your shots is good and the editing is simple and works; keep at it you've made a good start."

Filmmakers,3dqe1x,walter_eagle,3,Sat Jul 18 13:56:24 2015 UTC,"The two question's  you need to answer are; how do you approach using a computer and what exactly are you looking to edit? Understanding the differences in NLE software are really about understanding how people approach editing. I'll talk about the big 3 professional NLE's on the market FCP7, Avid, and Premiere Pro CC because even the casual filmmaker will end up needing more tools in their tool belt so to speak, than programs like iMovie or WMM offer you (so don't waste your time). Avid was born out of necessity and not necessarily want, which is important to understand because the only people that are still into using this program are old crusty editors that imo are on their way out. Avid takes what editors that used to cut film understand and turned that into a computer program. This means that everything they understand about working at the bench of a MoviOla with bins of film strips everywhere and literally cutting and pasting pieces of film together all had to be translated into software. So this means that avid is a very cause and effect based style of editing, its very hard to move things around and try out edits every which way you want, or even in its approach in where things are put on your timeline or how you apply transitions is all very permanent feeling. But this is because this is how all of these editors understood the workflow of editing film. NOW flash forward to people like Walter Murch who are all about final cut pro. FCP7 is the program a lot of modern filmmakers grew up on and understand and as the new wave of NLE software that really gives the editor a workflow that is more inlign with our curent understanding of computer software. Basically an NLE that was made for people that grew up using computers. You can just about do anything you want on your timeline and edit and re-edit different things without really skipping a beat. The problem is this program hasn't been updated since 2011 when Apple killed their Pro Apps. SO NOW WE MOVE INTO RIGHT NOW so in response to the death of FCP7 we have arrived at the Adobe family of pro editing software. Adobe's Premiere Pro (PPCC) is what you want to try out, It's 20 dollars a month and it has everything great about FCP7's timeline approach without any of the bullshit workflow. In FCP7 you have to transcode all of your footage to an Apple specific codec called Apple Pro Res if you don't want your timeline to get bogged down to absolute chaos and having to render out every single edit you try to make or just be sad because the program just quits on you, but in PPCC the greatest thing in the entire world is they figured out how to allow you to never transcode again by dumping any footage you want into your timeline with almost no render time. They are really killing it at Adobe right now with PPCC and even if you want to approach this casually that is the software you need to try out. Good luck dude, editing is the most fun and infuriating and under appreciated art form you will ever experience."
Filmmakers,3dqe1x,wescotte,2,Sat Jul 18 17:08:17 2015 UTC,"You can try Adobe products for 30 days for free so I recommend you start there.  Also, you don't have to buy them anymore,  you pay a monthly fee to use them. If you can afford it Adobe is probably your best bet because they have powerful tools for every aspect of filmmaking and the largest community of free tutorials/support to learn to use the software. It's going to be the fastest/easiest way to just start marking films.  If you can't afford Adobe and need a free alternative then it really depends on the type of films you want to make and how much time you have to invest in learning the tools. Lightworks is the tool I would learn because it's the arguably the most powerful professional tool but also lacks a lot of features other tools in terms of basic effects which you may or may not need. Lightworks is good at editing but it's bad at doing simple effects. This isn't just making explosions but doing things like adding text, color correction, cross fades, etc... So you'll have to use another tool to make those clips but once they are created Lightworks can merge them with your project.  Blender is probably the most powerful and feature rich tool you can find for free but it's really not designed for video editing. It just happens that what it's designed to do well also gives it the ability to edit and composite video clips but even if you master this tool it's just going to be faster/easy to use a different program when you only want to edit video."

Filmmakers,3dqe1x,Lahoski64,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:37:08 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you want to achieve. Personaly I would recommend you Vegas Pro for starters or some free software but I started with Vegas and then moved on to Adobe products. It's easier to work with project when using Premiere and After Effects for your movies cause you can move your project simply.  Differrence between Vegas and Premiere is not as big as people say. There are Adobe and Sony fans out there, but it's just what fits you better.  Honestly I liked Vegas more but I started using After Effects much more so I started using Premiere instead and whole Adobe family with CC (that's adobe creative cloud, you get adobe products like AE, photoshop, premiere... for about 50$ per month).  So sum up: If you intend using after effects I recommend you to start with Premiere. But don't get scared with graphical interface of kind a like programs. There's plenty tutorials on youtube for premiere and vegas etc. And I recommend you to start with a project, it doesn't matter if it's just stupid shots of your dog or anything. Than you'll have a goal you wan't to achieve through editing. That way you'll have some motivation to not stop editing.  Edit: And you should take in consideration your pc specs and look for the best performance program. You don't need newest versions of programs to achieve the same output."

Both tools are insanely powerful at their primary function (which isn't editing) and as a result have the ability to be used to edit films but I really wouldn't recommend them for that task. They are just not designed for it and make doing most editing work slow and frustrating compared to other applications.  However, it does look like Davinci is putting a lot of effort into getting it's software to be useful for general editing so eventually it might be the right tool for the job."

I don't know if I would go through the whole process of writing a script for each and everyone, that's a lot of work and you'll never get to the polishing stage of writing. Maybe instead try to write for one prompt a day (more if you've got the time and drive) and at the end of the month find your favorite 2 or 3 stories and turn them into short film scripts over the next month. Rinse and repeat with a write daily one month, then focus on a few pieces the next month.

The G7 shoots 4K @ 100mbps, 1080p @ 28 mbps and has a big compression when compared to the GHx series and a MFT sensor that has a crop factor of 2.0. That means that you might have a worse image (color/image quality) AFTER some post work. If you can cope with this, its an awesome camera. If you want to change a lot in post, take a look at the hacked GH2 or the GH3.

If you want a detailed specs sheet, here's the GH3's and the G7's.  Here you can read more about what various frame letters (like I-Frame/B-Frame)  mean.

But, specifically something that beginners don't know reveals their inexperience, I'd have to say the absolute top of the list is that films are not made by a group of friends doing what they love. They're made by teams of people who's only job is to be very very good at the one thing they're doing.  A real film director isn't painting the set, or checking mic levels, or anything else. They're directing. This same principle extends to everything from the boom operator to the best boy.  If I had to pick a second thing, I'd say it's the cognitive dissonance that occurs when an audience views their work. They don't realize how horrendous their film is, even in the face of a disapproving crowd. This then extends into an inability to create a film that resonates with an audience, since the filmmaker is deaf to them."
Filmmakers,3dm0xk,TrickyTiger,11,Fri Jul 17 11:07:12 2015 UTC,"It's pretty common for pros to be friends with other pros and make shorts especially, for fun. Shorts are typically money losers, so for the professional, they're often an exercise in creativity. They're also often done pro-bono by most of the crew unless funding (really donations in the case of a short) can be found. So for it to even happen, those people are making the film for fun.  But I do see the point that the more specialized each member of the crew is, the more ""professional,"" like a Hollywood feature, a short film will look. It's great to be versatile, but in filmmaking, the best results often come from specialists.  It's just that specialists cost money, and it's hard to justify spending money on an entire crew of experts for a film that will never break even.   Just because you don't want to spend $50,000 to get your 20 minute short made doesn't mean you're not necessarily a professional (in your day job at least)."

A good Director cuts the story down to just the barest elements necessary to tell the story the best.  That jib shot that took you a whole day and cost 45% of your budget?  If it needs to be cut, cut it.  The heart-wrenching monologue? Maybe the last sentence of it alone will carry the point across.  You have to be willing to kill your favorite things in order to make it better for the audience. Oh, and obsession on cameras.  Jeez, the camera you choose is ten percent as valuable as the D.P you choose, and 20% as valuable as the lighting you have.  If you have skills and lights, a T2i is more valuable than an Alexa without skills and lights.  Cameras are fun to play with, but watch other films, learn their lighting techniques by seeing the finished product and reverse-engineering them to see how they got there.  Cinematography is light, and cameras are the box to record it."

Anymore, its very easy to make something pretty, but to make something that engages people is where the craft comes in to play.   I think most first time filmmakers are so scared of being judged (rightly so) that they don't listen to feedback on their work, good or bad, and don't grow from it. They also often times won't share the work with others throughout the process to see if their techniques and storytelling are resonating.   If a first time filmmaker could open themselves up to that process of review and attention, I think they'd skip ahead of many contemporaries, out of the gate.  Also, never EVER forget audio. From a technical perspective, that's the main thing beginners forget and it can literally make or break your piece.  Thanks!"

If you are serious about being a filmmaker then you move to a film city, if you live in a film city actor are a dime a dozen.  For example I live in Vancouver if a new filmmaker approached me and asked for casting options for a no budget film I could hand him a list of actor who would be amazing and do it for free. Why, because this industry is full of actor who haven't gotten their break yet, doesn't mean they aren't talented just means they haven't gotten lucky yet, so they do low budget or free work to keep up their skills.  I say this because I'm an actor who hasn't gotten my break yet but I work on tons of free projects for practice. If you as a filmmaker choose to cast bad or non-actors then that's you being lazy and has nothing to do with the industry.  Also Sharknado was campy the actors on it were acting terrible they aren't actually terrible actors.

So you can put in your time trying to get hired at an entry level position on a big feature film crew and work your way up, or if you really believe in your vision and technical skill you can try to make your own short film because resources are limited. Makes for some fine producers and directors who know how to work on a budget or how to tell an elegantly simple story effectively.   Not disagreeing with you at all. This is something that new filmmakers will do and if you've ever gone to a short film festival you can often tell they're new at it.

OP specifically said ""short filmmakers"", which is not something you can do professionally.  As for videographers, he just happens to also be correct that a great number of people who claim to be directors are actually videographers.  I'm not saying you're wrong here, only that the only times I've ever seen u/itschrisreed speak on these subjects it's been correct, not a personal opinion."

Filmmakers,3dpfje,AR96,3,Sat Jul 18 04:29:13 2015 UTC,"My first response: What?   First things first, story. A story has a beginning, middle and end. After you truly understand how to make a story, you can mess around and find unique ways to tell those parts, but every story has them. This story has just a middle. Which means it doesn't make any sense. There's no context for what's happening and there's no closure to give any meaning.  Second. I know you shot this on a phone, but you've got to get rid of that camera shake. The camera shake of being a handheld phone looks really bad. Purposful shaky cam is different because it doesn't have the tiny vibrations that holding a small device has.   Third. Your framing and camera angles were weird. They didn't seem to make any sense and weren't appealing. The Rule of Thirds is a good place to start, just google it if you don't know what it is. Also 180 degree rule is essential, I don't know if you followed it here or not, but just make sure you do in the future. For the scene in the door, over the shoulder would have been a good place to go instead of the random high shots. Watch movies and videos without sound and pay attention to how they frame shots and position the camera. Eye level unless you're specifically showing something.  Fourth. Camera choice. Filmic Pro isn't a bad choice, but you really should look into something that will give you more. I've never used Filmic Pro, but I looked it up and they claimed that you couldn't tell the difference between c100 footage and iphone footage with this app. No. If you shoot to the best of the capabilities of a c100, you can tell the difference. But, you can't really compete with the price, so there's that. If you want to pursue this, look into getting some equipment. iPhone isn't bad, but you'll need a tripod for sure, just get a super cheap one for now. Microphone is a good next step maybe. A better camera when you can. Other stuff in the future.   Fith. Acting. It's pretty bad. But I can't really fault you for that when you've just got friends to work with. Don't feel bad about that, we all went through that.  The most important thing to remember is that it's all about the story. This is the hardest part for me because I love technical stuff. You can shoot something really crappy, but if the story is great, people will love it. Shoot the same thing really, really well, and people will love it just slightly more. Second thing to remember is that audio is as important as video if not more important. Audo was good here, just keep that in mind always.   Overall, it's decent for an early effort. Be proud, but in a while you'll hate it and that's ok."
Filmmakers,3dpfje,JaMojo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:57:42 2015 UTC,It doesn't look like you had your focus locked in. Either that or it was just that shaky.   I think that there is a huge difference between natural movement from a DSLR or production camera and the shaky you get with handheld iPhone shots. It is just comes across really jerky. Some kind of stabilizer would be so much help. Like the Steadicam Smoothee (sp?).   Not going to comment on the story aspect.  The angles were a little weird and didn't keep the flow and momentum going. I would just watch movies and take note of angles you like and take them straight up. No one will be mad everyone starts like that.   Keep it up.

Filmmakers,3doaua,Cameron--,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:15:28 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you're looking to enhance. Do you want the color to look as true to life as possible, or do you want to embellish certain hues?"
Filmmakers,3doaua,Cameron--,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:42:18 2015 UTC,I think in this case a true to life look is best. However this is part of my problem I'm not sure what looks to choose from or start from.
Filmmakers,3doaua,Cameron--,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:26:48 2015 UTC,"When it comes to picking the desired look that your color gives off, it's best to start with the tone of the project. Drama usually equals high contrast, cerebral/avant garde equals low contrast, comedy equals accented skin colors to highlight facial emotions, the list goes on. For non-narritive/documentary, it is best to go with a color correction with high fidelity, meaning what is shown on screen is very close to what a person would see in that exact spot. For FCPx, I would recommend to mainly stick to saturation and exposure tabs to find a neutral and balanced color. Important: it is possible to tweak your color so much, that you don't really have an objective perspective on your own creation over time, as in much of editing. When you think you've got it perfect, step away and return to in a day's time (kind of like proof reading)."

Filmmakers,3doaua,ChubakTheMagnificant,0,Mon Jul 20 03:35:12 2015 UTC,"If you want to color-correct in the NLE, just play with the wheels until you get a solid look, then calibrate.

I would recommend not letting the joke run too long (beer/playground), (locker room, bare ass). Quick shots that last 5-10 seconds would be solid, but the ""shock"" value will die quickly if the camera lingers.   It was well shot and stabilized (especially the interior car shots)."

I recommend putting in a few faster paced scenes- its hard to sit through lots of artsy shots and long pauses between anything actually happening.  Your transitions were also kind of strange for me, some of them just cut right to black and the music would stop, and the screen would just be black for a few seconds. I'd suggest working on better transitions for a nicer flow. try to fade between the scenes,  maybe have music constantly in the background instead of cutting in and out?   I liked the smoking shots though, most of it was visually appealing. Just a little too long and a little too slow.   Keep working hard! :)"

Fewer jobs on set means less time is used because most of that side of production is ignored. There's no makeup, no magazine-changing, no extras to manage, if anything on set needs to be ""reset' for another take, it's likely going to be a few seconds of rearranging papers back on the table, not the exploding car rig that takes an hour to set."
Filmmakers,3dmpd8,Raichu93,3,Fri Jul 17 16:42:49 2015 UTC,"It really depends, I'd say that if you're assuming a somewhat consistent level of diligence, so to speak, the roughly 5 minutes per day scale pretty well, regardless of project size. Of course, if you have no lighting or make-up at all, for example, you might be able to move faster.  But with the standard procedures in place, you'll always end up somewhere at this pace - if it's a particularly large set-up, there will be more crew to handle it (say, additional grips, or additional wardrobe and make-up crew for scenes with many extras, etc), so you can do the +/- 5 minutes in a day.  Edit: This is not a coincidence, by the way. If you just look at the majority of the market (i. e. discount the super-expensive blockbusters and the super-cheap no-budget stuff), labor cost eats a huge portion of most films' budgets. So in oder to calculate properly, you need to make sure you can plan the number of work days properly, and scale your crew size according to your budget. Most films are somewhere around 90 minutes, and usually shoot about X days on average, depending on your market (about 22-35 over here, for example). When you take these two as constants, you can do the math and see what amount of gimmicks you can afford, or whether you need to cut something from the script."

Filmmakers,3dmpd8,TrickyTiger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:15:58 2015 UTC,"I think that's a factor that relies on the script first. Some scenes require a more people to be shot faster, it depends on several things, actually: the complexity of a scene with actors, extras, and other technical aspects as movement, lighting, duration of the shot, etc.  Usually, that's also a matter of structure. A production with a bigger crew means also more people involved in the organization of every aspect of the production, to secure exactly what you're saying: a faster, fluid work. While in smaller, like guerrilla productions, people can do several roles at the same time, to cover that lack of organization."
Filmmakers,3dmpd8,copperblood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:15:03 2015 UTC,I've heard that one too. I think it's generally true for a conventional film production.
Filmmakers,3dmpd8,copperblood,5,Tue Jul 21 13:04:37 2015 UTC,"It's really going to come down to how solid your pre-production game is, how many shooting locations there are, and how good your actors are.  If it's all on point, then it's absolutely possible to do it in a week!"
Filmmakers,3dmpd8,copperblood,2,Fri Jul 17 15:03:06 2015 UTC,"It is possible to shoot in a week or less, but it all depends on the content of your short.  Is it story driven, or is it stunt heavy etc?  If it's just a good ole fashion story, with minimal locations, you can easily get away with shooting 5 pages a day (given that you've planned everything out).  Just keep in mind that anytime you move a location, it's going to cost you about an hour (at a minimum) out of your production day.  Also a big factor is how much crew do you have?  Assuming you have enough support, and have planned everything out, get the performance you want out of your actors, then yeah, you can make that in a week"
Filmmakers,3dmpd8,Ootrab,2,Fri Jul 17 15:28:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips.  Pre-production and preparation is crucial indeed. Rehearsals with the cast (and the crew in some cases) days before shooting can also help a faster shoot. The short will be story-driven, with less dialogues than the usual (if compared to American short films), with a crew of eight people. The last short film I directed was about 13 minutes, and it was shot in two days and a half, with an even smaller crew. It hadn't almost any dialogues, though."

Filmmakers,3dkyzi,ManBat1,7,Fri Jul 17 02:55:42 2015 UTC,"I know you're looking for specifics here, but for me if it's I'm hooked. If five minutes in I know there's nothing that could make me not watch the movie I know it's gonna be awesome. Thinking the opening of The Dark Knight Rises, or There will Be Blood.  Sorry I know that's a shit answer but that's really the only way I know to describe it. You just feel it."
Filmmakers,3dkyzi,Captain-Cuddles,6,Fri Jul 17 03:01:00 2015 UTC,"So tone is really what gets it? If everything just seems to work together from that first moment. Sound, music, color, and an interesting beginning?"
Filmmakers,3dkyzi,whatahorriblethingto,4,Fri Jul 17 03:17:04 2015 UTC,The Intro to the dark knight rises is absolutely amazing. I think it's my favorite ever. The intro to the dark knight was also amazing.
Filmmakers,3dkyzi,richardtate,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:50:22 2015 UTC,"Repeat again for Inception, The Prestige. Although I think Nolan can be quite overhyped, I really do think he is a very good filmmaker, and one example of why is that almost all of his films have an opening that grabs the audience while simultaneously setting the tone, introducing key ideas/events, and providing a great visual."
Filmmakers,3dkyzi,Willwebbful,3,Fri Jul 17 18:34:56 2015 UTC,"It's all about trust. A film by an unknown, starring unknowns had to convince me they know how to tell a story. Any cliche or ham dialogue, unmotivated camera techniques or what have you, and I'm out.  If they do something clever, I'm invested because I can tell I'm in good hands.  If it's a film by somebody I already trust, or starring people I trust, I tend to give more leeway.  An example of this might be Dallas Buyers opening scene, which immediately gave me the impression somebody is unfolding a story competently.  In contrast a student film opening with an alarm clock morning would be a red flag and they would have to immediately show me on screen that they're aware of the cliche or I'll switch off."

Filmmakers,3dkyzi,Slim_slug,2,Fri Jul 17 07:20:56 2015 UTC,"If I get drawn in very quickly or get chills despite not knowing the plot or any of the characters yet.  For example, the opening scene of The Dark Knight pulled me right in from the first shots.  Also, I knew Boogie Nights would be a good film when I heard the somber music play over the black screen only for it to cut to energetic music over the first scene."
Filmmakers,3dkyzi,OneEyedGecko,2,Fri Jul 17 04:22:44 2015 UTC,"When the opening shot is an alarm clock buzzing that gets hit by a tired, lazy bum. You then see them drag themselves out of bed, and you know it's gon' by gud."
