AerialPorn,34xixd,deathtopumpkins,2,Tue May 5 13:15:38 2015 UTC,Yeah. I don't know anything about Boston but when I saw this image I was skeptical that it was. Boston is a large city isn't it? I would expect it to look very different.

AerialPorn,34xixd,ProfessorPoopslinger,1 point,Tue May 5 13:31:26 2015 UTC,"Boston's metro area is much larger, but the city population is surprisingly close. Boston is 646,000. Virginia Beach is 448,000.  Boston is very urban though, whereas Va Beach is 95% sprawl.  The topography is also vastly different."

Without a doubt it was the most beautiful site I have seen from the air. The mountain ranges sticking up through the glaciers were spectacular.

AerialPorn,3423wu,xarc13,6,Mon Apr 27 18:30:13 2015 UTC,"Just FYI, this is an Ultralight aircraft. Paragliding look like this"
AerialPorn,3423wu,Casualbat007,3,Mon Apr 27 21:20:39 2015 UTC,"More specifically, it's a trike, which is a hang glider with a prop where you sit supine and steer by shifting your weight.  Technically, in the US, an ""ultralight"" is specifically defined in a number of ways, including weighing less than 254 pounds.  http://www.usua.org/Rules/faa103.htm  Technically, a paraglider is an ultralight.  What you linked is a Powered Paraglider (PPG), also an ultralight.  As far as Oz, I don't know the specifics."
