Comcast,3e4bah,WallyEXPRESS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:39:15 2015 UTC,My understanding is that once you have been suspended you can no longer enter into a payment arrangement. You must have done it BEFORE suspension.

Plus he only has to pay the past due balance, he can keep doing that indefinitely and just paying the minimum and getting it cut off again after x amount of days. Usually there's reactivation fees though."

This whole month and part of last month the packet loss has been unbearable. It has dropped connection everyday without fail.   No idea how they call themselves an ISP.
Comcast,3e3wlj,Shoohey,2,Tue Jul 21 19:32:56 2015 UTC,I would call in and ask . Rather than filing a complaint before asking it may be an error I have never seen that charge before.

Comcast,3e3wlj,ImComcastic,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:58:33 2015 UTC,Comcast always bills one month in advance. Charges will always show up for times that haven't happened yet.   You didn't have a new piece of equipment installed or a new kit mailed to you? No techs doing trouble calls or anything?
Comcast,3e3gyi,wmarsh,2,Tue Jul 21 17:46:47 2015 UTC,In general I prefer live chats over phone calls because I can do stuff while they type their blah blah. But I really hate how much time is wasted by sending you all those default messages.

Comcast,3e3gyi,Valalvax,2,Tue Jul 21 18:26:35 2015 UTC,"A little. They are fluent in English and tend to be a little more on the ball, but not always helpful (as per my other comment in this thread)  and the unholy moving screw-up."
Comcast,3e3gyi,Valalvax,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:30:34 2015 UTC,"Phone support is only a little better (at least we can understand each other). They claim that there has been a ""$16 credit on my account, so there is a balance of 0 and nothing is due"". I pointed out that the charge is $100 and that I have a bill from them stating that I owe them money, and they just said ""it is a zero balance"". Sigh. I asked them to make a note on my account saying that they promise I owe nothing, so that when they cut me off at the end of the month for not paying I can reference that. I asked for a new bill with a zero balance but they said ""there isn't one"".  It's been such an unbelievably confusing mess since we used Mover's Edge. They got the address wrong several times, currently I have a ghost primary account for building 5 as well as the correct building 15, and I think Comcast screwed up the move so badly that the accounts are now a huge mess that nobody at Comcast can understand.  I'm probably going to have to pay the balance of the bill and either be surprised to find I have a positive balance with them next month, or I have to dispute the charges but at least not have my service discontinued (preventing me from working from home).  Presumably I can file a Better Businesses Bureau complaint if they still expect me to pay the charge, right?"

Comcast,3e4pco,fuzzydunloblaw,2,Wed Jul 22 00:26:28 2015 UTC,"Just to remind everyone, the FCC mandates data caps. No, just kidding. They're not mandatory and beyond that they serve zero purpose beyond generating more revenue for a company that already charges too much and delivers too little when it comes to their internet products. I'm hoping the rumors are true that the FCC will take action if comcast stupidly tries to go nationwide with the caps."
Comcast,3e4pco,BarneyandBlue,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:50:20 2015 UTC,FCC would already have stepped if they could do anything since they are already enforced in some areas.  Also if you remember wireless carriers were also being held to title 2 just as wired connections and they still have caps.  I may just be being pessimistic but I doubt they can do anything.

Comcast,3dzhg4,virtuallifestyle,2,Mon Jul 20 23:47:26 2015 UTC,This is hard to say if previous one was working fine then there is not or at least should not be a signal problem. Some modems are more sensitive to signal issues than others. The agent may have asked for the mac multiple times because it wasn't showing on his tools and he wanted to make sure he was getting it right. It is possible it was on another account if this happens agent will get an error if the other account is in your state its not hard to move it over if its in another system it has to be deleted from that systems inventory before it can be added in a different system which can take days. if thats the case I would swap it rather than wait. Sometimes this happens if modem is doing an update or if there is a problem with the modem  which I have seen happen with those models when they are new. If all the lights are good and globe is solid and they still cant see it your might want to swap the modem to eliminate it as a possibility. I would do that first before sending tech. If a tech comes out all he will do is check signal and verify the hfc mac id.

The horror stories of people with bad internet, in this age, is unacceptable.   Just another thing to mention, Comcast is going to be implementing DOCSIS 3.1 rolling around starting in 2016, and the most important thing there is Comcast is promising equal DL/UL speeds.

Comcast,3dtep0,thecw,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:16:07 2015 UTC,"TCP Timeouts, TCP Resets, UDP dropped packets, packet loss multiple hops into the Comcast network. All these symptoms happen at the nodes I listed above. TCPTraceroute shows transit loss but of course your routers are not responding to it so it is not clear where the loss happens with this particular tool. I am aware of ICMP being a low priority protocol but in this instance it was a simple illustration of the issue. Being 15ms to be-101-ar01.santaclara.ca.sfba.comcast.net and then 150+ms to anything beyond that is the main problem. Whether it be SSH sessions to multiple networks being reset multiple times a day, DNS queries failing due to UDP packet loss, or latency so high that streaming from Apple, Netflix, Hulu, or even xfinity.comcast.net is at times unwatchable. Service like Slack or Skype disconnect multiple times a day, and VOIP calls are frequently full of jitter or just dropped completely. These issues are most notable at peak times (4p - 11p PST). All signs point to an issue upstream. Wired/wireless, rebooting modem, etc. never change the fact that at either the fifth or sixth hop into Comcast that traffic takes a dump."

Comcast,3dsepf,nerdburg,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:11:22 2015 UTC,LOL cant use that channel in the U.S. I would swap the modem out for an XB3 it will make the interference problem go away for you devices that are dual band compatible.

If its the wrong one they may need to have you speak to loyalty to fix it. The agent can report the one who gave you a triple play without your knowledge because that goes against sales integrity guidelines which can get the agent fired it is possible you may have agreed to the package without realizing it but in any case there is the 30 day guarantee so your not locked into the new package.

The other possibility is that the second one is pro-rated from now until your bill cycle date and then adds the first full month of service.   My experience with Comcast (and Dish Network, and T-Mobile) billing is that the bills can be confusing, especially when there are discounts involved, but are seldom wrong once you dig into the details.

If it has been upgraded have another tech out it could e a nework issue that needs to be upgraded to a network tech the agent on the phone cannot upgrade it to a network tech has to be done by regular tech in the field the minimum you should be getting if area is 75Mbps is 60Mbps

Comcast,3didaa,Moral_,3,Fri Jul 17 01:51:37 2015 UTC,"This system acts on individual customers (i.e. on the the shared bandwidth Coax plant), not where we connect with other ISPs. This has been approved by the FCC, as it only temporarily moves packets into a lower priority queue during high-utilization periods IFF that user is the one causing the high-utilization. This is considered ""reasonable network management"".  The system as it stands today has been in place for four or five years now. We have a website where the entire system is documented, along with the RFC that was also submitted to the FCC. http://networkmanagement.comcast.net."
Comcast,3didaa,virtuallynathan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:06:29 2015 UTC,"Interesting. So this is an internal comcast network thing. How can one user cause high utilization? Are the internal hops only 1gps or something? I cannot fathom that some guy on a 100mbps could cause that much damage. Even if the line is already saturated.   So lets say one of the internal switches is routinely at high-utilization, for what ever reason are you guys going to keep prioritizing packets or upgrade the switch to a higher throughput one?"
Comcast,3didaa,Moral_,2,Sat Jul 18 04:29:13 2015 UTC,"The only part of the network that tends to see high-utilization is the shared coax plant - the DOCSIS side of things.

You can read about some of the cool stuff he has helped create out there while also being a member of the internet society.    Everyone knows Comcast has done probably more than their fair share of shitty stuff in the past (some probably ongoing), has fairly horrible customer service, and plenty of problems to solve.  They have however been a leader in technology weather its ipv6, getting rid of analog to free up spectrum for D3, offering the fiber services for 305mbit and now 2gbps, and I am sure the OP and his team have been the lead on several of these projects.  You also don’t see many other large ISP's high level official’s posting details, answering questions, etc, on reddit do you?

Comcast,3didaa,riacon,4,Sun Jul 19 19:02:46 2015 UTC,"I am confused. Every time someone claims they are being throttled a Comcast Employee will jump in the thread and say ""Comcast does not throttle anyone's connection"" before proceeding to try and assist them fixing their issue. Is this Comcast way of saying that they do in fact throttle peoples connections from time to time to make the internet 'fair' for everyone and these Comcast employees have just been talking out of their ass this whole time?  Now that last part comes off a bit rude and I appreciate that these people have tried to assist us customers that have had issues in the past. Yet in most if not all the topics that come up about certain people being throttled they always jump the gun and say that Comcast doesn't throttle. That it must be something else causing the issue. Yet here is evidence straight from Comcast that suggest otherwise. That they do in fact throttle some of their customers at certain times, probably all heavy internet user customers at one time or another and the times when we have had no issue with our internet at all and then the next day we do have an issue, especially being hard wired into our modems, that it was in fact throttling being the cause of the issue and not something else."
Comcast,3didaa,thecw,9,Thu Jul 16 16:08:37 2015 UTC,"A lot of the confusion comes from what posters mean when they say ""throttled"" and what we do for network management.  We never reduce the amount of bandwidth available to you or configured on your modem. What happens is that during periods of high use on your CMTS, when you are also using a large amount of bandwidth, is that your packets get placed in a lower priority queue. And then if the buffer gets full, those are the ones that wait.   So even if you are in a network management event, there still a very high possibility that you won't even notice it. And when you're in a network management event, the duration is usually about 15 minutes.  This is based entirely on usage, it has nothing to do with the sites you're looking at, the content you're downloading, or the protocols you're using.  So when someone comes in here and says ""am I being throttled because I'm watching a lot of YouTube?"" what they mean is ""is Comcast reducing my bandwidth because I am using a service they don't like?"" And the answer to that is no.  The system as it stands today has been in place for four or five years now. We have a website where the entire system is documented, along with the RFC that was also submitted to the FCC. http://networkmanagement.comcast.net."
Comcast,3didaa,Jrlhath,4,Thu Jul 16 16:44:53 2015 UTC,"People usually complain about Comcast throttling specific websites or applications, like Youtube, Netflix, or Bittorrent.  Comcast does not do this.  All ISP's however have congestion management policies, and Comcast is no different.  However, The overwhelmingly most likely cause of intermittent speed issues is problems with the connection and very, very unlikely to be congestion management.  The Comcast congestion policy can be found here:  http://customer.xfinity.com/help-and-support/internet/network-management-information/  The most relevant parts of that: ""Our technique does not manage congestion based on specific online activities, protocols or applications that a customer uses. Rather, it only focuses on the heaviest users in real time, so that congestion periods tend to be fleeting and sporadic.""  and  ""Based on our experience, the large majority of our customers will notice no change in their Internet experience. In fact, we find that on average less than one percent of our high-speed Internet customers are affected by the congestion management approach. Our experience also shows that when the congestion management technique is applied to an individual user’s account, it is usually only for a very brief period of time.""  Luckily, now with speed experience tool customers (and users on here) can know for sure."
Comcast,3didaa,IamNotWrong-,3,Thu Jul 16 16:51:31 2015 UTC,"What you see here is not the ""throttle"" people are referring to usually.  As far as I understand, throttle (in this context) would mean they would cap your internet speeds if you use too much data. However, what you see here is QoS (Quality of Service). Your router has the same feature built in. What it does is that it avoids 100% congestion by creating a ""fair share"" of bandwidth usage between all internet devices (if you reach the bandwidth limit). The result is that if one person tries to use up all the bandwidth, other people can still use the Internet."

If you have any splitters, either remove them or make sure they are connected correctly and all cable connected to them is secure."

Comcast,3dksnx,thecw,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:56:33 2015 UTC,"You just need a technician to come out.  Most in-house (if not all) have to poll all devices before they leave and if any are out of spec they have to explain to their supervisor why it is that way.  That's a newer metric they have to meet.  So having a tech come out might be a good idea, just make sure the modem isn't unplugged when he tries to leave."
Comcast,3djko1,weslehh,2,Thu Jul 16 20:05:31 2015 UTC,There are many things that can affect the speed. Since you are getting full speed direct its not a signal issue. There could be interference from other wifi networks causing issue I would recommend rebooting modem as this will force it to scan for clearest wifi channel and make sure gateway channel is set to auto. the reason auto is good is because if your neighbors have routers there channels can change and then jam your connection if you use a manual channel. another option if there are a ton of wifi networks around you is to have Comcast send you an xb3 since its dual band  and that will help any devices you have that are dual band compatible. Comcast does not guarantee the speeds on wifi because so many things can slow it down beyond Comcast's control.
Comcast,3djko1,virtuallifestyle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:39:46 2015 UTC,"yup, like that xfinitywifi network on the same modem.. and some user using it for a hotspot, and getting traffic all over your wifi spectrum.  how nice."
Comcast,3djko1,synpse,0,Mon Jul 20 06:20:16 2015 UTC,xfinitywifi on your modem does not interfere with your connection because its using the same radio and your traffic has priority your neighbors hotspot can interfere

If the internet is having problem get a tech out there. If the problem still isn't fixed then complain in the Business Forums and someone in corporate will make sure it's fixed ASAP. http://forums.businesshelp.comcast.com/"
Comcast,3di5w0,nerdburg,0,Thu Jul 16 16:01:02 2015 UTC,"His issue may not be a node problem, but a capacity issue on the node can definitely happen, I dealt with it not too long ago in my area(was specifically told it was the node being overloaded by a supervisor). Took about a month to resolve.   Though, yes, if you see issues you need to complain. Unlike residential techs, business techs get dinged for repeat calls, and they hate those. The business class forums is also a great way to get help. If the regulars can't help, an admin will have escalations reach out to you.

Comcast,3di5w0,HiEv,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:48:02 2015 UTC,"I work in Comcast Business tech support (Central Division, which includes Georgia).  If you want them to test to see if your node is reaching capacity, call tech support and have them do a 150 Mbps speed test to see if your area supports that speed.  That test will show if your node is reaching capacity on up and/or downstream.  If indeed it is, the tech can try reporting this problem, but please understand that it can take quite a while to do a node split, this isn't something that can be done overnight.  Still, a node reaching capacity is rarely the cause of these kinds of problems.  Have the tech check your signal levels and the modem logs for problems, and if they spot something there then a tech should be able to come out and fix that for you.  Also, if you're using a router, switch, and/or firewall, next time you have problems do a test with a computer connected directly connected to the modem and see if it also has problems.  If the device connected directly is fine but the other stuff is having problems, then it's an internal networking problem.  If both have problems, then it's likely on Comcast's side.  I'd say around 15-20% of the problems like this that I see end up being internal networking problems.  Next, make sure you have enough bandwidth.  If everything else is working fine, then that's the most likely culprit.  I hate it when I see 20 devices on the Internet using the Starter Internet package (16 Mbps down/3 Mbps up), because then I have to explain to the person that they're just choking their own pipe by trying to drink the ocean through a straw.  You can always downgrade your speed later if upgrading doesn't fix the problem.  Finally, I work in the Central Division, and I'm not sure this is the same in the West and Eastern Divisions, but if you're in our division and you have 3 outages or 2 technician visits within 30 days and your problems still aren't solved, call up and ask for a ""protention"" ticket.  That will get our Tier 2 techs to look into the problem, monitor your line, and to see why the problems aren't getting/staying fixed.  Basically, if a problem doesn't get fixed, keep calling back tech support.  It's entirely possible that there's more than one problem sometimes, and the tech fixes one but misses the other, so another tech needs to go out.  Hope that helps!"
Comcast,3dk1kw,easyxtarget,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:10:43 2015 UTC,the modem being unplugged fo a few hours will make no difference. 2. it really depends on what wire if it's the initial wire coming from street to home that's Comcast responsibility if its not that is yours.

He told you to leave it unplugged to avoid getting hit with an  out of spec metric alert and therefore fail the job.    Now the cable running into the attic if it's run through the ceiling,  wall, etc., we aren't supposed to replace it.  If it's easy I'll usually do it,  if not you'd have to get your personal contractor to replace it,  or put in a change of service with comcast to re-run it but that still may not happen if it is run in a fashion where wall fishing is needed.

Also the point where it goes into the wall is a bathroom on the other side so splitting it there isn't really possible. If I am willing to put forth the effort, would pulling through a new cable fix the problem then? The cable is 20 years old and all the other cabling being used is brand new.

We'd had Comcast for ONE WEEK before they ""activated"" it on our modem/router (turned it on, enabled it, whatever the terminology).   I was ignorant before this, had no idea about the Xfinity public hotspot thing they were doing. My first inclination that something was up was when my internet speed dropped from ~20 to maybe 3mbps, but often less than 1mbps. Less than one!! Only a week into having Comcast!!!  I researched a bit, got frustrated and called Comcast. The two was very rude and confrontational, certainly not at all helpful... blamed my laptop as the culprit for the egregious drop in speed, and warned that I'd be charged if they had to send a tech out (I'm actually thankful for that).  So I was on my own. Spent days googling and trying to figure it out. FINALLY found an article about this Xfinity Wifi program Comcast had that turned your router into a public network by creating a new/second network. Figured out how to disable it and BAM. Within ~2mins of restarting router speeds were back up.  Just thinking how rude the tech support person was on the phone when I called makes my blood boil. Either he purposely lied to me or he was ignorant and terrible at his job. Either one highlights how shitty this company is, just one more example (as if we don't have enough already).   Have you disabled your public Xfinity hotspot? You have to go to your account page on Comcast website to do it. I had the same problem as you, when trying to figure out how to disable it I connected to it accidentally and after that it wouldn't let me connect to my actual private wifi network anymore. Disabling yours prevents you from connecting to anyone else's public Xfinity wifi network (I believe)"

People, in general, don't understand networking very well and blame their ISP when the issue is with their local network. I see this even from people who are otherwise very computer literate. It's like blaming the power company whenever a light bulb burns out.  Comcast is horribly overpriced and has awful customer service, but the network is nowhere near as unreliable as people seem to think.

(Self calculated numbers, but realistically very very high)"
Comcast,3d5s4i,ArtisticProgrammer,5,Mon Jul 13 19:15:44 2015 UTC,The easiest thing to do is just take Comcast's equipment to your local service center and tell them to close the account.
Comcast,3d5s4i,nerdburg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:55:33 2015 UTC,This. When my mom died I just paid the bill off online and returned the equipment and explained the situation. The girl gave me a receipt and that was that.
Comcast,3d5s4i,stalkythefish,3,Thu Jul 16 00:03:03 2015 UTC,Do what Gunny123 said. You'll end up at the office regardless. Bring the death certificate and the equipment and deal with everything in one trip.  Sorry for your loss.

Comcast,3d6mhc,comcastgirl13,2,Wed Jul 22 03:12:11 2015 UTC,"I chatted with Comcast a week ago and they said my roll-off price was $214.99. I called them today to cancel and go with AT&T U-Verse, thinking that my rate next month is going to be $214.99+tax, but she confirmed that for the next 12 months, my rate would be $124.99, which I am more than willing to pay. Just for the record, $124.99 includes X1, HD Preferred Plus XF, and 105 Mbps Blast, and national calling. It is still a kick ass deal"

Comcast,3d6b2v,virtuallifestyle,2,Tue Jul 14 00:42:23 2015 UTC,But my name has never been involved with a late fee what would be the point of changing service for  cheaper bill if I had the intentions of never paying it? My name owes no money to Comcast but I still have to pay them and even with the paperwork of this guy leaving that still won't be enough?
Comcast,3d6b2v,virtuallifestyle,3,Tue Jul 14 02:12:56 2015 UTC,i understand but did you have service at the address for months without paying granted it wasnt in your name. It would look different if you were a brand new subscriber with a new lease to prove it. You had service there before.
Comcast,3d6b2v,FeralSparky,2,Tue Jul 14 02:37:05 2015 UTC,That's why I don't know how they plan on making money. They won't go after this guy they will just reject my service till I pay for him. If they wanted me to responsible for the bill why wasn't both of our names on it? Thank you for the help tho I didn't know anything about this at risk list. What if I got a new lease? All of our names were on it so I guess a new one would have to be made for me
Comcast,3d6b2v,DragonPup,2,Tue Jul 14 02:41:55 2015 UTC,"They are going by the address not the lease.   You move in, signed up for service and continue to pay said service.  Your room-mate moves in and you turn your service off. Your room-mate now turns service on in their name.   Room-mate does not pay bill, comcast shuts off service.   Previous subscriber calls to have service turned back on from the same address as before, as well as the ex-room-mate who did not pay.   They mark your address as high risk of non-payment as to avoid being scammed again.   As for them not going after him they already have. They have sent his bill to collections and a small business that collects over due debts has purchased his bill for some insanely small amount.   They will then simply notify the court system of their desire to garnish any wages he earns until his debt is repaid.   In the mean time they have marked your address and will not install service in your name until the previous bill is paid in full. Or you move to a new location [new non shitty room-mate signs up in his name with a lease that is only in his name]"
Comcast,3d6b2v,flossdaily,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:17:37 2015 UTC,Wow so they aren't going to get their money at all. Why don't they take a credit card to prevent this from happening? I feel like I can't be the only one that has seen this.

Your old roommate breached the contract, and so Comcast needs to collect from him, or take him to court (or more likely, sell the debt to a debt collector).  If Comcast is refusing to connect you, a customer with a history of good payment, due to a 3rd party's unrelated debt... i just have no idea how to proceed.  I'm not sure if there are any laws that say utility providers must provide services to customers willing to pay.  I'm not sure if those laws would extend to an ISP.

My roommate had a bad payment record with them and I didn't want to rely on her for my phone service so I requested a separate phone line for myself.  Problem is, because of my roommate's record, they didn't want to give me a separate line.  I asked them to look up my previous address payment history which was perfect, of course.  When they said they still wouldn't give me a line I asked why.  They said, ""what if your roommate uses your phone?""  Isn't that just an idiotic response?  I said, ""What if she does?  Isn't it my responsibility to pay it?""  They said, ""Well, yes.""  I said, ""Do you have a problem with my payment record?""  They said, ""uh...no ma'am.""  They came out two days later and installed my phone line.  I wonder if a similar tactic might work for you, but then, I'd be presuming that logic could be used with Comcast so...maybe not.   In any case, good luck!"

Comcast,3d6b2v,firedfromcomcast,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:25:41 2015 UTC,"I get wanting a deal and bargain but like you said yourself in your op, you cancelled in your name when your promotion expired and had your roommate sign up as a new customer in order to get another introductory rate.   It isn't just about your roommate not paying the bill, it's a culmination of that + Comcast recently cracking down on people being dishonest and doing this type of stuff.  The world doesn't stop turning for you just because you're a broke college kid. That pretentious excuse drives me up the wall. College students have to pay bills and learn to stand in line and follow the rules just like everyone else. Its called being an adult.

If Comcast really wanted to start cracking down on criminals taking their money they would make people give a credit card or at least a security deposit like what I had to a few months ago. But instead they decide to chase after who ever cares the most about the bill. Any other type of bill from water to gas would not work like this, if it is in one persons name it is their responsibility to pay it and it is up to them to make sure everyone is chipping in. The company does not care if the roommates are being fair they just want their money. The lesson to be taught from this is watch out for companies that have a huge hate groups against them because they pull shady shit like this on anyone. No one can expect the world to stop for them but you are damned if you think I will let it take my money."
Comcast,3d6b2v,firedfromcomcast,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:26:22 2015 UTC,"There are couple of different reasons why one person would have to pay a deposit and another wouldn't.

If so, you'll be required to pay a deposit (true for lots of places not just comcast)  Or maybe you refused to give them your social where as your roommate did. I know that you can choose to not give a social but in that case you automatically have to pay a deposit.  Etc etc etc  And I understand your entire op and every comment completely, thanks."

Comcast,3d5ei8,YouKnowWhom,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:57:21 2015 UTC,"Also, I did the following steps which I found in a different thread:    I noticed my bittorrent clients were reporting blocked ports all of a sudden, and after checking to make sure my router had all its ports open, I surmised it must have been Comcast's shenanigans.  visit 10.0.0.1 in your browser (default Comcast modem IP address). Credentials by default are admin/password.  Click firewall -> ipv4.  Click ""custom security"". Since I have another router connected to the Comcast modem that acts as the gateway for all my devices, here I checked ""disable entire firewall."" I don't need a firewall on this box because my additional router makes it redundant. You will notice that the default is either ""medium"" or ""low"" security, and that both block Bittorrent's ports.  Do the same for IPV6.  You will now probably have to enable port forwarding. You can pretty much look up how to do this yourself. However, keep in mind that if your devices connect to the modem through another router, you will need to forward the desired ports to the router's IP address on the 10...* subnet, and NOT your devices directly.  For example, if your network is like mine (it probably is), it goes Comcast modem -> router -> clients, you don't need your modem to do any additional crap if your router does it itself."

Comcast,3d5z6q,dfjjau,3,Mon Jul 13 20:04:25 2015 UTC,That's about right if you're on a single band 2.4ghz network.  Invest in a dual band router and (if your devices support that second band(5ghz) you'll see close if not exactly the speeds you're supposed to be getting. The tech is pointless to be honest.

Comcast,3d5z6q,Lega-c,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:28:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. Just trying to understand the difference- why is a dual band router necessary if the router I got has speeds ""up to 300Mpbs"". Why would a 5 ghz network double my speed?"
Comcast,3d5z6q,Pan_Fried_Dwarves,2,Mon Jul 13 20:38:59 2015 UTC,"Basically the 2.4 network has 11 channels, or frequencies, of which 3 don't overlap(bump into) each other. so for every 3 other wireless networks you see on a 2.4 only device, say most laptops, your speed is guaranteed to drop because you are guaranteed to have interference. 5ghz solves this problem by not only having more channels, but more channels that don't over lap so unless you have dozens upon dozens of 5ghz networks right next to each other, you won't have the same issue. Plus on 2.4 you have more environmental issues, have anything bluetooth or 'wireless' that doesn't actually connect to your network? It causes interference. have a lot of metal, water(aquarium) or any major appliance near your router? More interference. Need to go through walls, doors or anything but open space? That's just normal absorbtion and not interference, but it will still slow you down sometimes quite significantly. It's why Comcast does not guarantee wifi speeds but will usually fight to get you hardwired speeds at or better than your package speed.  Also another thing to note is the wireless adapter your computer/device has, as wifi speed is not just all about the router, it's about how fast your computer is going to accept the speeds."
Comcast,3d5z6q,Lega-c,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:02:40 2015 UTC,"To put it as simple as possible ( and I'm sure others here can explain it bwetter),  The 2.4ghz band is congested. The 5ghz band isn't nearly as congested so it allows for a clearer signal and faster speeds."
Comcast,3d5z6q,virtuallifestyle,2,Mon Jul 13 21:02:10 2015 UTC,No if you can get full speed direct to the modem its not Comcasts problem also you should invest in a dual band router or higher if you want faster speed for wireless

There are several major factors that determine wireless speed:   Protocol standard. 802.11n is the latest for 2.4GHz, 802.11ac is the latest for 5GHz Channel width - 20MHz is the norm in 2.4GHz, 5GHz is typically 40MHz for 802.11n or 80MHz for 802.11ac (wider channel = faster) Number of spacial streams. More=faster. Lower-end routers and wireless cards only support one. Most phones only support one. Signal strength. Weaker signal = slower. Congestion - more wireless networks in the same area will slow you down, even if you have a strong signal because Wi-Fi devices try to avoid ""talking over"" other devices on the same channel. (Even devices on other wireless networks.)"

I should also note that the original rollout was supposed to be mid- to late-November, but it got pushed back because the network didn't have enough power for all of the phones.  :-P  Even today I probably have around a 10-20% drop rate when trying to transfer calls from my business department to residential, which is why I always make sure I do a warm transfer and get the rep on the phone, rather than doing a cold transfer and hoping it works.  So, yeah, phone system is crap.  They're working on it.  That said, I know at least one person who was in my department who got fired for hanging up on customers.  So yes, it happens, but it's not tolerated, therefore it's much more rare.  If you reach someone, make sure you give the agent a callback number in case the call drops.  They should be able to call you back."
Comcast,3d5fdp,cplater,2,Mon Jul 13 17:46:43 2015 UTC,May be your line has a poor signal to noise ratio aka snr or your modem doesn't support such high speed  Or  You are testing your speed on Wi-Fi. Try connecting your modem directly to your PC with an ethernet cable and try to see if you are getting higher speed. I have my xfinity connected directly to my PC and I get as advertised.

Comcast,3d4g3a,Infymus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:11:47 2015 UTC,"Most likely it is not a splitter issue. Your signal levels are probably too low. When you put the splitter in, it reduces the signal strength causing your modem's connection to fail. TV is not a sensitive to signal levels as modems are.   The Commscope SV4G is a 4 way splitter. What you are describing is a SV3 which is most likely an ""unbalanced"" splitter. One of the output ports should be marked ""-5.5"" and the other two will be marked as ""-7"". The modem should be connected to the 5.5 port.  You can check signal levels yourself (see:http://forums.xfinity.com/t5/Basic-Internet-Connectivity-And/Connection-Troubleshooting-Tips/td-p/1253575)  Most likely you'll need a tech to fix the problem."

Also why don't they ever increase the upload speeds? 10 just isn't cutting it anymore when Verizon and Google are offering symmetrical up/down speeds. I know the cable isn't limiting it because your newest modem is theoretically capable of ""The bonded channels can deliver  downstream data rates that exceed 900 Mbps and upstream data rates that exceed  120 Mbp"""
Comcast,3d2t7l,ImComcastic,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:27:57 2015 UTC,It's a balance of what investment is worth it. The bandwidth needed for increasing upload speeds is better served elsewhere on the network when symmetrical speeds is more just a marketing buzzword and not entirely necessary except for the niche users.   That's my answer at least. Sure it's not the official one.
Comcast,3d2t7l,mttechdude,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:36:45 2015 UTC,"It's mostly because DOCSIS is built as a lopsided system. Current modems are 16/8 or 16/4, and I've even heard of 24/4 modems.  Comcast hasn't even deployed above 3 channels in most places, but that's still 90mbps of theoretical upload space.  Advertising 75/5 or 150/10 is just embarrassing."
Comcast,3d2t7l,ImComcastic,2,Mon Jul 13 18:45:48 2015 UTC,Embarrassing? Not sure I'd agree with that. Most companies don't even advertise upload AND download. They're promoted as a download centric service because that's what's important to most everyone.
Comcast,3d2t7l,iammodbox,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:20:34 2015 UTC,"Actually browsing on lots of gaming forums I see people posting while using tiny (in comparison to Comcast) internet companies and they do advertise upload and download and they're faster than Comcast offers a good 75% of the time. I actually saw someone seeding a torrent with their cable isp at 100mbps. Looked up the company by the host name my torrent client showed, and they offered 100/100 for a ridiculous price like 29.99 per month in middle of nowhere Iowa.  You said ""easier said than done"" and with the money Comcast makes off it's customers there should be no reason at all that with it's top speed tiers they don't double or triple the upload speeds.  You also said that most people don't care about their upload speed. Well for the average user, most people don't care or even know what their download speeds are either. Hell, most people don't even look at their bills and are paying for services they don't have or use. Wouldn't you agree that the power user who is on these types of websites is the only group that the 150/10 extreme plan is marketed towards? I don't see my grandparents who don't even know how to use their cell phones signing up for 150/10 plans because they need it. They're going for the basics along with the rest of the average consumers... That is until Comcast pushes the speed upgrades down their throats by up-selling them with phone calls and letters."

That example uses one person, what else ya got? How about my android phone which is linked to dropbox. Every time I snap a picture it auto uploads to dropbox at 10mbps with about a 12mb picture there's some lag spikes from maxing out my upload connection with a single user.   Upload is just as important because if your modem has packets backing up due to low upload speed then you start dropping packets and lagging in a game. The www.NetDuma.com router I have stops this because you can set a cap to your connection so nobody can utilize your full speeds and cause you to lag. For example, while gaming you'd set your upload and download speeds to 90% of their potential speed and you allow 10% overhead for your modem to ""breath"""

So there you go.    Myself, I would be inclined to do one of two things.  First, I might tell them I have it and ask them to pick it up lest I throw it in the trash, as in: ""No, I am not going to drive to your damned customer 'service' center to take a number and wait an hour to drop it off.""  Second option would be to just sit on it, keeping it new in the box, to see how long it takes them to figure out you have it and ask for it back.  Option 2 carries the risk that they will attempt to bill you for it even though you didn't ask for it and have never used it, then condition your future service on payment of the immoral bill.

Comcast,3crht2,frranasd,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:41:47 2015 UTC,"am moving into a new apartment with a roommate in August   Comcast allows you to transfer your service free of charge to a new address. It's called the Mover's Edge program. It allows you to transfer your current services from one address to another. Often you will have a new account created for your new address, either by the technician who hooks up your service when they activate it, or by the representative who handles the transfer.   In either case, you can specifically request that your package be transfered over AS-IS and reconnect your service at your new address. When the tech arrives to verify your service and hook up your equipment, ask if they can call in and verify that the package on your account is the same one you had before, and verify the monthly charges (before taxes of course). If you're not receiving the correct package, cancel your appointment and call 1-800-XFINITY to make the changes to your service before you agree to have it installed.  EDIT: Forgot to mention, the TV+Internet bundles save you money initially, but read the fine print associated with the package you're looking at. The rates for these two rise sharply after the first 6 or 12 months, and continue climbing for another year. If you're only concerned with it in the short term, then go for it.

There is no free installation unless your in  specific area or get a specific package (which is probably only 5% of orders).   Just call sales and ask for a new promotion on the transfer. There is no difference in canceling it then restarting, its just easier to transfer since you keep your logins and equipment."

You are using your own equipment that is already authorized to decrypt and view programming. Your equipment was simply operating as it should. You were using your own service at another location.  Comcast would have disabled your equipment if you canceled (or stopped paying) service at your previous address without creating a transfer service order."

Given that I am using my own equipment / account (from what you said), how come the phone isn't working?  Is it because the prior tenant didn't have his phone activated - so it's just not available for use where I am?  Oh also - do you think I'll have service until the tech comes for the transfer next week?  The rep on the phone said it's the prior tenant's service and ""hopefully it will last"" - but if I am paying through all of this - it should definitely last.  I don't even see a need for a tech to come, other than to maybe install the phone...but perhaps I can do that. Honestly  I have had the worst experiences with comcast reps (especially with a cablecard in tivo) that I wish I didn't have to have one come here.  I don't even think I want a landline anymore."

Your cable line is dumb, it doesn't know who you are or what house it is serving or who lived there before you.  What the previous tenant had is irrelevant, because it's your equipment that authorizes you on the network.

Comcast,3crca2,firedfromcomcast,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:53:34 2015 UTC,"Often times when a person puts in a request to transfer service to a new address, the person who handles the request will create a new account under the new address, and will not explicitly transfer over the equipment from the old address. The old address can continue receiving service with the old equipment, provided it is not transferred to the new account at the new address.   The catch-22 is that the equipment can technically receive service anywhere. Like /u/thecw said, the line has no idea what equipment is hooked up to it. It's like a hose that's always on full blast that accepts any Comcast nozzle provided the account the equipment is attached to is in good standing and receiving service.   With that being said, you definitely risk a technician disconnecting your equipment if you're servicing the wrong address. There are very explicit instructions on what is allowed to be hooked up on each account and the kind of equipment the customer is allowed to have based on their account. If your equipment is registered under your sister's friend's name at another address, they're probably going to assume you're stealing cable, or trying to use someone else's."

I had switched to using my Netgear R7000 as an AP and not a router putting the Comcast gateway back into normal mode. This worked for a few weeks with no issues.   This day though I had been having intermittent issues for a few days but this day was impossible. After talking with tech support and no solution I changed out hardware. I am now using the SB6141 with the R7000 in regular routing mode. I have tried wireless and wired. I am also on their Extreme 105 service. With using my owned cable modem though I have lost phone service which I am paying for and used regularly.   Yesterday and today seem to be better. I have not had as many disconnect issues but speed is still a great deal slower with anything encrypted. I do understand that you lose some due to the encryption but not to where I am only receiving 1/10th of un-encrypted speed."

Also, it could be the comcast dns servers, I'd recommend opendns or google's dns servers, change it manually in your router. comcasts dns servers cause all kinds of issues for encrypted connections it seems. I'd give that a try  I also notice a trend of these issues MOSTLY affecting 105 customers. no answer as to why"

Is there anything that the technician can do that might warrant extra fees?   Assuming the lines are in good working order not a whole lot. As for extra fees, the pro install includes the outlet for the modem so there shouldn't be.   I bought my own modem and router in preparation for the switch. I've read that I should activate the modem through the comcast website. Should I do this before the technician arrives or will the technician do it?   The tech will do it for you.

So far over chat-support I've only gotten an offer of $40 credit, but I'm cancelling Comcast ASAP so that's worthless to me, and also not the full $70 they're trying to fleece me for.  I was experiencing trouble with my internet service and scheduled an in-home tech visit. NOT ONCE over the phone or in person by this tech was I told it would cost me anything, because why the fuck would I be charged to troubleshoot a service I'm already paying for? That's ridiculous.

Comcast,3cl89w,YouKnowWhom,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:02:34 2015 UTC,"Reading through the comments I can tell you what happened. the reps you spoke with (including comments) neglected to mention there may be a charge because no one but billing can talk prices, and no one but the technician knows what if any charge there will be after he finishes the work. a lot of times these techs are 3rd party as well.   As far as any CC system not working in your home (especially x1 with broadband), it is usually an issue of signal strength, and CC is going to charge you to fix and replace the wires in your house so it can work with your service. I'll agree its...strange they dont tell you up front it may not work in your home due to limitations in your signal strength (old splitters, lines, too many splitters, cheap splitters, etc.) You can't seriously expect someone to come ""fix up"" your property for no charge. Would it be nice if there was a warning about this beforehand? yes. Would you warn your entire customer base that your service may not work without additional work on their house cabling up front?  It comes down to statistics, for most people it works fine, no issue. some people dont have the bandwidth in their local areas infrastructure to support their services properly. thats the real issue. Going back to the big telco scam from the gov to upgrade infrastructure, taking the money, and running.  TLDR; I don't understand why people think fixing issues with their home wiring would be free. we pay for service, if more work needs done, it will cost more. It's like, you buying a brand new awesome truck but it doesnt fit in your garage, and you are mad at the dealership for not giving you a bigger garage for free with the truck. That being said, im not suprised that you all werent told about a charge due to comcast policies and somewhat.....lacking tier one support."

Now that person transferred me again to another department after failing to schedule appointment, even after the extensive review of my account. They did not provide me any info, but gave me 48 hrs of waiting time.     Update on July 10th: Yesterday, my brother said he got a call from comcast, while i was at summer school, about our situation. My brother said the person who called us was a manager, which i assumed was regional manager whom the redditor above me transferred us to. Mew, for my brother's name, told the commy (comcast) that we were offered for 28th for a technician 2 or 3 days ago when we first contacted them. But he/she told me that is impossible of their service since maximum limit of waiting is a week. (Therefore, this proves how malicious, uncommunicative, and deceptive customer services are when you call them). So yesterday, the commy promised us to send another technician over today around noon. Since they didn't knock or anything, I pasted a 'post it' to my door with instruction on how to ring a bell (took pic as proof). As they left a phamplet with such rudeness as above about the 'signal ingress' noted in the phamplet. With this being the case, the commy should be aware of our problem and able to efficiently and quickly take care of the problem.   (This is the phamlet that left days ago.  They didnt knock the door or anything. With us having 2 dogs, they would have barked if they came with intentions, with and no discreetion. http://imgur.com/VB3CCOX )"

Comcast,3c7lzo,Shoohey,2,Sun Jul 5 22:23:52 2015 UTC,It's a prosumer service.  If you can afford a ~$300/month plan you can afford a proper router.  The 505/105 plan uses a Ciena 3931 switch as the demarc point and it has a 10gbe sfp+ port. It also has normal gigabit ports for those that don't want to buy 10gb nics and router.
Comcast,3c7lzo,wTheOnew,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:07:33 2015 UTC,"I was thinking more along the lines that they would provide a modem/router combo with multiple gigabit ports, so you could have two gigabit devices maxing out your connection at once.

Comcast,3c66za,PraisingJah,4,Sun Jul 5 05:53:05 2015 UTC,The channel change is onlt a temporary fix eventually channel six will get crowded and you will have to change it agian. To keep it from happening upgrade to either a dual band wireless gateway(XB3 Modems from Comcast) or you can purchase your own Dual band wireless router and call comcast to enable bridge mode.
Comcast,3c66za,thecw,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:28:11 2015 UTC,"With wireless interference issues, other routers around you are likely set to automatic channel selection, so they will keep switching around to find the best channel. This is why keeping channel on automatic is your best option, power cycle the wireless gateway and it will search for the best channel. Also, when you have a bunch of wifi networks around you, you're going to be getting slower wifi speeds regardless because that's the way wifi works - it's not a perfect technology, do some google research and you'll figure that out.  Get the XB3 wireless gateway for dual band capability. Once you have this, connect to the 5ghz (HOME-xxxx-5) network to reduce interference on this alternate frequency. If your devices do not see the HOME-XXXX-5 network, that means they are not dual band capable (you can buy a dual band wifi usb stick to work around this issue for computers/laptops). 2.4 ghz is the common frequency for all wifi devices/routers and household appliances, that's why your speeds are slow. Once again, doing some google research on this will help better educate you on how wifi works."
Comcast,3c66za,skyroket,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:02:59 2015 UTC,"Using 2.4 GHz, the only independent channels are 1, 6 and 11. All the others overlap.  If you're using a Comcast gateway, go to your local office and swap it for a new XB3, which has dual-band 802.11ac."

This ''trial'' has been going on since 2008. There's no way to opt out of this program. I was playing ring-around-rosey with customer service asking to opt out but kept getting no answer and hang-up. I ended up filing a complaint with the FCC and sent in the recorded call as well. Comcast pretty much has a monopoly is most markets of the US. They say they don't compete which is a huge problems since competition is what makes companies innovate and bring prices down for the consumers. Their customer service centers are the worst. I might add that Comcast being voted the worst company in America. There are reports of Comcast customer rep changing names of customer's bill. Comcast magically raising prices of customer's bills for ''higher quality customer service/cable-streaming'' even though there's no changes.  Everything is a bundle, even when you don't freaking need it. Somehow Internet alone is more expensive than getting cable + internet + phone promotional. Though after 1 year or so, Comcast slowly increases your bill and you cannot get the bill lowered unless you complain to a media outlet, file a complaint with the FCC, or record the call and release it to the internet about the wonderful service of big monopolies like Comcast."

Comcast is lying to you if they say they need the whole lease.  What you're paying in rent, for example, is none of their business.  As an alternative, you could invite Comcast to contact your apartment manager to confirm that you are a new tenant.   Honestly though, I do not understand why Comcast thinks it should be able to see your lease.  According to the BS from their corporate shill, they want to see that you are not connected to anyone who was a previous occupant.  How does that make a difference?  Unless Comcast has someone signed on the dotted line as a customer, it makes no difference that they might have lived in a house or apartment with the person who did sign up for service.  Comcast cannot pursue a non-customer for a departed/defaulting customer's bill.  Therefore it makes no difference whether you were there previously or not.  Corporate shills should not give legal advice.  Source:  Lawyer for more than 25 years."
Comcast,3bouhh,Gasonfires,5,Wed Jul 1 02:47:18 2015 UTC,It has nothing to do with laws. Comcast has a policy requiring new residents to show leases to avoid roommates and relatives from skipping out on bills. If you don't have that situation show them your lease and be done with it.

Most likely the previous owner of services just left with no notice to Comcast and did not officially disconnect.  Obviously they are not just going to restart services for what would be basically the same tenant with 3 months bills outstanding.

More importantly, since Comcast cannot collect an unpaid bill from anyone whom they do not have bound to a contract, no statement made in the context of whether a new customer lived with the jerk who skipped out on the bill can possibly be material.

Comcast lines are shared among the people you have on your node (basically your neighborhood). They tend to over provision there lines. I am subscribed to 50 mbs and usually get 59 mbs.
Comcast,3bmzuy,firedfromcomcast,2,Tue Jun 30 16:22:44 2015 UTC,Like what /u/firedfromcomcast said comcast uses different technology. it also depends on the type of modem you have. when i had att i had a docsis 2.0 modem and it would max out at ~20mbps. when i switched to (well not comcast but similar in terms of technology) suddenlink i got a docsis 3.0 and then when i started working for comcast i learned the difference between the two. docsis 2.0 can't get much higher than ~20mbps and the docsis 3.0 can get upwards of 150+mbps.

I won't argue that Comcast is unreliable, it's extremely reliable for me. It's also extremely overpriced.

It doesn't affect the owner of the modems bandwidth and you can connect to it anywhere there is a comcast wireless gateway. Business or neighbor, doesn't matter.   If the fedex truck ripped out the wires near your home, that's why your modem is not connecting, clearly.  I can't really tell from your post if comcast fixed them or not, but if they did and you still can't connect, they probably didn't fix it properly."
Comcast,3beour,itallblends,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:19:02 2015 UTC,"Sorry. Comcast did fix the cables and service was restored. then a month later, we stopped paying the bill (bill split between roommates and not everyone could afford it anymore). It hasn't affected me personally because I use a family members login credentials to access the Xfinity hotspot. I used it before too when there would be lapses in coverage due to unpaid bills. However, the week that we were without service due to the semi hitting the cable, I was unable to connect to Xfinity through my family member's credentials. It led me to believe that even when I am using their credentials at my own house, I'm connecting to Xfinity through my own modem and router, even when our own service was disconnected and service suspended. Since I wasn't able to connect during that week, I'm assuming my neighbors have turned off the Xfinity hotspot on their routers.  The roommate whose name cable is in is moving out and Comcast is supposedly coming today to collect their equipment. Assuming they don't disconnect any wires at the house or pole, would I be able to use my own modem and router to still connect to Xfinity WiFi through my family member's credentials? Or do I need to have a router from Comcast for that to work?   tl;dr - do I have to use Comcast's routers in order to connect to Xfinity WiFi or can I buy a router at best buy and still connect, assuming I have Comcast internet service at my house?"
Comcast,3beour,itallblends,2,Mon Jun 29 18:41:09 2015 UTC,"Well it's possible the neighbors turned off their hotspot but that seems unlikely as you have to go into your account settings on the comcast site and into user settings to disable it.    You said you're still using your family members account info that's still an active account, so that should still work.    I'm not sure if xfinitywifi hotspot still works on a suspended account modem (yours) but if comcast takes the modem, you won't see that hotspot.   Comcast doesn't do physical disconnects at the tap anymore, so your lines will still be active, but your own modem/router won't work because modems need to be activated with a legit paid account number."
Comcast,3beour,yourwatchisnice,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:12:52 2015 UTC,"Well it's possible the neighbors turned off their hotspot   That's probably what they did.

There may be state laws that determine how much interruption is viewed on screen, or, it could be related to the equipment that each provider uses for EAS alerts.  Either way, there's nothing you can really do about it- by law the carriers have to test the system when the government tells them they have to.

Comcast,3b5nyu,Xx2CleanxX,2,Fri Jun 26 04:20:49 2015 UTC,"Some bad news...  I'm pretty sure Comcast Business class will not be available as a triple play. The Business TV service requires that you are in a residential zoned neighborhood.  You can request business class internet only, then subscribe to a TV/phone plan with the residential service. This would have no disruption, just order Business class and once its installed remove the residential internet. This probably wont be a cheap option.  If I were you I would ask a residential sales agent to create a completely separate account with a separate modem. Then you have 600 GB data cap. This will be much cheaper than business class if this sounds like it would be enough for you."
Comcast,3b5nyu,HappyComcastEmployee,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:45:58 2015 UTC,So right now I am paying around 180$ per month for 105 Mbps internet with the blast triple play. If I were to go with your first option would a lower internet speed like 25 Mbps with the double play TV and phone even come close to be equal with what I am paying now? Or are there hidden costs associated with swapping out the services?
Comcast,3b5nyu,HappyComcastEmployee,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:58:24 2015 UTC,"If you do end up signing up for business class internet here is what the best option would be...  Around $70 starter / $80 preferred + TV Boxes rental cost $20 saver phone service + $10 phone modem $80 Business Class (as a rough estimate)  I would estimate a total bill of around $200-$220. There will also be a contract required with business class, and startup fees, but no other crazy costs.  It will be an expensive way of setting it up! But you are asking for a lot of services. You can also see if Business class can bundle internet and phone and just do residential TV but it probably wont save much in the long term and cause a bigger headache."

They will run you through the rigor moral of restarting your modem and pinging your modem from their computer.  If they cannot solve your issue, first ask for CR number or CR ticket (Customer Request).  Then ask what your options are to solve the issue.  They will probably try to schedule a tech visit.  Make sure that they are not going to try to charge you for this.    The issue is most likely one of two issues. 1. Your modem or your coax is bad.      -If either of these are your issue, then they should be able to fix       this pretty easily without much headache.  2.  They have overloaded the node or the node is going bad in your area.     -If this is your issue, it is another story.  Nodes cost around $90,000 a pop and as you can imagine, Comcast isn't johnny on the spot about shelling out the jack to fix these.  I would find an xfinity store, tell them you are interested in speaking with a local Comcast Business representative about getting business internet, or if you know a local Comcast Business rep talk to them.    Obviously you are not trying to get business internet, but Comcast Business has local reps that are in your town.  They have access to make it right cards.

Comcast,3ayvnp,M_Dub,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:11:21 2015 UTC,"This sounds like my dealings with Comcast. A rep promises services at an agreed upon rate. Client verifies services and rate multiple times. Comcast bills client at a higher price for a lesser service. Client spends multiple hours on the phone with various reps (starting anew and repeating his issue, account information, etc with every person he speaks to) only to be transferred around and hung up on repeatedly. Client eventually grows tired of the game and accepts what Comcast is giving. It's the same old story over and over. Very frustrating."

After having my issue escalated a few times I had one gentleman on their CSA line tell me that I could move to another market if I wanted to opt out of their data cap trial. However he also warned me that Comcast is rolling out the 300gb data cap, with $10 per every 50gb allotment over that cap, nationwide ""soon"". He said that they will be sending out flyers to let everyone know when this is going to happen.

Some franchises still do not allow it and require you to rent one from CC.  The only Comcast approved telephony modems you'll find at retail are the Arris TG862G and the TM722G. Check Amazon.com

Comcast,3axao7,melstein,3,Wed Jun 24 06:26:25 2015 UTC,"You could, but it depends on how much you stream and the quality. A standard HD stream from Netflix can use up to 3GBs per hour. Assuming you stream at least 96 hours in a month(3 hours a day) you'd be right at the cap with 288GBs. Which really isn't too unreasonable.   Unfortunately, since you are in one of the trial markets your options are limited. You can either curb your usage or switch to business class."
Comcast,3axao7,kraze1994,2,Wed Jun 24 07:18:43 2015 UTC,"I live in one of the trial areas. My situation is almost the same as OP's in terms of usage. I looked into switching to business class but Comcast is the only option and in my area they will not let me sign up for their business class internet as they will not set up service for home based businesses as I have been told multiple times.  All we want is broadband internet. We don't want phone service. We don't want cable TV service. As such the best possible option for internet that we have in my area is using Comcast's Blast (50mbps) service with a 300gb per month cap. To get faster speeds we have to sign up for a more expensive tv/phone/web bundle. There is nothing we can use in my area to go above a 300gb data cap though.  While I do not disagree with you data usage estimates, it would seem that everyone on the Comcast help line does. I have been told three different times since this past Friday that in order to use 300gb I would have to watch 400 individual 2 hour HD movies, not even addressing my 650gb+ per month bill. Basic math tells me that I can't reach my data usage with their given forumula, there are not that many hours in a month.

If I had to guess they are just doing DVD quality, instead of actual HD and are just calling it HD because the average consumer won't really know the difference.  I'd estimate their numbers to be based off of 0.7-1.2GB per hour, which means you could get more then double the amount of streaming I mentioned above.

I'd recommend you'd file a complaint and tell all of your friends to as well. https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=38824"
Comcast,3axao7,kraze1994,2,Thu Jun 25 00:21:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the response. I knew when I heard it that the data estimates I was being given were wrong. What really burns me about that ""lie"" is that it was given to me multiple times, and once by someone who was supposed to be an ""expert"" within the Comcast service department. I don't even blame the people I talk to on the phone for not helping, being unable to help or lying to me. I blame Comcast. They know their help services are in fact not helpful, not truthful and not easy to use.   Every time I try to call their CSA help line I always get to hear the, ""We are currently experiencing a heavier than usual call volume"" message that tells me if I don't want to wait on hold for a while I should call back some other time. Every. Single. Time. Yet I choose to wait because the previous five people I spoke to, or chatted with online, said they can't help me and eventually someone tells me to call that line for a ""specialist"". So usually after an hour or so on hold I get to speak to someone in an overseas call center reading me a script that I have begun to memorize myself. I then convince that person that I need my issue escalated to someone with the authority to pretend to help me. Thus begins another 30 minutes on hold so that I can speak to a ""supervisor"". The ""supervisor"" is in fact not someone managing the person I first spoke to but just someone with an American accent.  .... I am rambling and I am just going to stop. Just trying to type out my experience with Comcast makes me angry. God I hate this company. In almost twenty years of dealing with them I have never had a positive experience. I don't know why I ever delude myself that the next phone call I make to them is going to be different.  Dear Google. If you want a great method for picking your next cities to expand Fiber service to just pull up Comcast's page detailing their 2 year running ""trial"" of charging for data overages. Announce Fiber is moving to those areas and then enjoy watching Comcast freak out. Help me Google .... you're my only hope."

Sometimes they make mistakes and forget to mention every detail.  That's why you can check the paperwork you're given and also log on to your account to verify exactly what you have and how the promo is structured.  Sorry if the salesperson forget to mention a $5 discount changing after a couple months.  That doesn't mean Comcast is trying to screw you or even that the sales man was hiding it to get a sale.  Don't get me wrong, the salesperson should be covering every detail but the customer is also responsible to make sure they get what they want.  Not saying you did anything wrong, but if this sounds like an honest mistake.   It's $5.  It's such a small amount, even if the sales rep was dishonest just to pad his numbers, $5 would not be the difference maker.  If $5 breaks the bank, maybe you should switch to a more affordable internet tier.  No discount in any business lasts forever, that's what makes discounts special.  Forgive me for being blunt.

Comcast,3aunoa,crasssophisticate,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:25:12 2015 UTC,"Comcast: ""Are you moving? Comcast makes it easy to transfer services."" BULLSHIT!  We moved from one town-home to another town-home. Weeks before moving we go on our comcast account and go to the ""move service"" and enter the new date and address for our move. We receive a confirmation email and didn't have to talk to anyone.  On moving day I plugged in all of the equipment exactly as it was at the old townhouse. After playing with the TV I was surprised to see that all of the equipment worked. We have internet and cable. All of our channels were there and we were able to get online. Amazing! I thought - Comcast really DOES make moving easy.  So for about two weeks we have no issues until we notice on our account online that the billing address is still listed as our old address. So we go online and update our billing info address.  That doesn't work and we're told to call customer service. Ug. So we call and talk to billing and we're told that we're going to need a new account number.   Shortly following getting a new account number, we lose our internet connection. Cable still works.  We call back and they transfer us around for a bit. No one can understand why our Internet is out.   So we lose Internet for maybe a day or two before someone finally gets it turned on. Internet is up and working and for a couple of days we're watching Netflix and things seem fine. A ""moving specialist"" even calls to follow up, we say everything is fine.  Well, a couple of days after that we go to watch HBO and notice our on-demand and cable is out. Black screen. We realize that we didn't check our TV at all when they were fixing the internet because our cable was working fine previously.  The TV says that the On-demand server cannot be reached and asks us to call customer service and gives us an error code.  We call. Now they don't understand why the cable is not working. Keep in mind, both services worked perfectly for almost two weeks when we first moved in. This all happened after we tried to update our billing address.  So the first guy we talk to says that he'll have everything ready to go and gives us a confirmation code to call the moving department with. (we were on hold so long we had to go out and couldn't complete the call)  We come home and realize that now both the internet and cable are out. Using public wifi we are shocked to see that our service has been disconnected.   We call customer service. We actually speak to a couple of reps how honestly said they have no idea what happened.   In one day our calls are dropped 7 times. We reach a person, the person is VERY nice and says we'll be set up in no time, they say ""let me transfer you"" and then the call is disconnected after waiting on hold for 10-20 minutes. Which is odd b/c a couple of times the rep even clicked back in to see if we were still holding.  Finally, at night a woman is able to restore our internet service. Cable comes back on, but we no longer have HBO and the on-demand says that it's updating or something.  we also check our account and learn that we are now paying $20 more per month and have to pay installation fees and activation fees.   so we call back and again go through on-hold hell. I think we went through retention and had our bill back to where it was with different discounts and credits. The rep told us the bill would be exactly what we were paying before we moved.   Then we get a confirmation email listing the changes in our bill that we requested. Again, the bill is still $20 more per month. Only one discount that was discussed on the phone was applied.  At this point we are honestly debating whether calling back is even worth it. I guess we should switch to AT&T or WoW"

In my case, I'm visiting my parents' house, so I'm not the primary account holder.  Here's what I've found - if I run a traceroute, there are certain hops that will frequently time out. If I use a VPN, everything works fine. But that's not a good solution to the problem for various reasons.  I called Comcast's tech support line today. The first support rep didn't understand the problem when I explained the message I was seeing and the intermittent connection problems. He kept asking if I was on a wireless connection, which I was, but that wasn't the problem. After a remote reset of the modem, he wanted to transfer me to the wireless support. Eventually I relented and told him to just transfer me to them so I could speak to someone else.  I explained the problem to the next rep who also did a remote reset of the modem. She then asked if it was working, and I told her that it was but that the problem was intermittent. She took that as thinking it was fixed. I explained that the issue still wasn't resolved, but I don't think she understood or cared. She gave me a reference number so that the next technician could ""perform the same steps"" she did and then we ended the call. Considering her steps were useless, I doubt that reference number will be useful.  Half an hour later, I convinced my parents to switch to AT&T. I realize the bandwidth isn't as good, but it's going to cost them half as much. And maybe if enough people switch from Comcast, Comcast will wise up and fix their service. In a couple of days, they will say goodbye to Comcast - hopefully forever, since Google Fiber is on the horizon in their area.  Comcast needs to:   Fix their AUPM page so it gives a relevant error message and a useful contact number and information about the problem. Based on what I've read here, it's due to reaching the data cap. In my case, my parents don't mind paying the extra $10/50gb after the cap, but they do mind not being able to use Netflix due to this issue. Based on my searching, this AUPM message is well over a year old. I wonder how many customers they've lost due to this issue. Improve their tech support. I offered to send my traceroute results to both reps, but I don't believe that either of them actually knew what a traceroute was. Neither of them knew what the AUPM message was."

Said to call back and ask for a higher-tier tech if it came back. He also said they had a lot of calls about it today so maybe there as a system-wide problem.  The Internet was basically useless at the time due to the warnings and throttling they put you through.

I'm pretty fed up with fighting this company when all I really want is high-speed reliable internet. I don't even mind the occasional billing error, but this has gotten ridiculous. I just want to pay what we agreed on in the contract.  I'm moving to my first house very soon and I'm afraid that the move is just going to mess up my bill even more and I'll be stuck with another 6+ months of calling to sort out minor issues. Comcast should be worried about keeping a customer, but they just seem to care about getting that extra $10/mo. for a four year old modem that probably costs $20 now. Every bill I have is auto-billed because I trust most companies enough to give them the benefit of the doubt (I validate 4x per year)...except for Comcast. They have not sent a single correct bill since signing up.  Their excuse for the audit is that people unknowingly buy stolen equipment (I know for sure that mine is not stolen). I don't see how this matters as they can just bill the person that stole it for non-returned equipment. Why punish paying customers that just want to save a buck? When I was with a different company they didn't even track their devices. The cost of modems vs the added support requirements and loss of customer goodwill is negligible and it undercuts the (Comcast perceived) market for stolen devices.  Sorry for the rant, I'm just amazed that this company hasn't been sued out of existence. I've seen the horror stories, but I thought they were the exception. I can't imagine how much money they're making off of people that just don't notice the extra $10 sneaking onto their bill."

I've seen quite of few of these on the internet over the years and very often the ones doing it unironically are snow shovelers, and I've seen unattended snow shovelers do this in person as well. I've even helped a snow shoveler get out of this situation before. He was trying to get up an escalator but wasn't fast enough to get past the attacking ghosts. I watched him do this for about 15 seconds as I walked up to the escalator myself. I asked if he needed a hand and that seemed to snap him out of whatever ghost mob he was in. He got a little fluttered and told me he was having trouble getting past the attacking ghosts. I guided him around to the up escalator and just said, ""You got to be careful around those things, they are violent."" He was so nice, but seemed very confused about where he actually was. Honestly, it scared the hell outta me to think this man was somehow attacked by ghosts at the mall and that he might be driving home at some point. I asked if he was looking for someone, and he said his grand daughter was going to meet him at the entrance. I didn't want to embarrass him so just let him go on his way and sorta tailed him for a while, he weaved around ghosts for quite a while, not going into stores, seemed like he was looking for a way around the attacking ghosts. I had resolved to just get involved if there was another ghost attack but when he made it to front doors a 20's something woman collected and shooed the ghosts away.

They are bottle-necking the traffic on purpose. It's been going on for some time.  Here is the 5-Year study that is fueling the entire fight. http://www.measurementlab.net/static/observatory/M-Lab_Interconnection_Study_US.pdf"
Comcast,3akw9e,MartyBass,2,Sun Jun 21 05:04:17 2015 UTC,Submit an equipment research ticket.
Comcast,3akw9e,firedfromcomcast,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:43:57 2015 UTC,Thank you.
Comcast,3akw9e,antihexe,0,Sun Jun 21 22:30:13 2015 UTC,It's very common that they do this. Every 6 months or so I get the rental fee appearing on my bill and I have to call and get them to take it off. Shitty Comcast.  I'd be willing to bet there are hundreds of thousands of Comcast customers paying rental fees for equipment they don't rent.  Someone's gonna sue them for this eventually to stop being so willing to slap fees on accounts by default.
Comcast,3akw9e,muhburner,2,Sun Jun 21 20:12:22 2015 UTC,"http://www.reddit.com/r/Comcast/comments/3akg7u/comcast_charging_me_for_my_own_equipment_update_1/  I'm getting very close to looking into a class-action for this just this reason. I like think it's just incompetence rather than malice, but I've been offering to help track down the issue and I think it's just being ignored. I'm getting tired of wasting time on hold.  If there are any lawyers out there that can get this started I'm willing to entertain the idea. My issue has been going on for 6 months, but it seems like there is always something wrong with my bill (I left Comcast for about a year because I was tired of calling customer support to fix surprise charges on my bill, I don't think there's another high-speed option at my new house). I've never met a person that hasn't had billing issues with Comcast and it feels like they're using incompetence and fees low enough to avoid individual suits to pad the bottom line (aka steal from unsuspecting customers)."
Comcast,3akw9e,WeShouldGoThere,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:48:46 2015 UTC,"I have already settled out of court but have excellent documentation and no gag order of this exact situation. First I fought for my own modem, then had to file small claims to remove charges for equipment never given to me."
Comcast,3akpim,nickk808,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:44:30 2015 UTC,$99.99 plus taxes and fees. And equipment rental. (Their cable boxes)
Comcast,3akpim,JaysRooted,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:30:15 2015 UTC,What TV services do you have currently and how much are you paying.
Comcast,3akpim,firedfromcomcast,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:36:14 2015 UTC,$55 per month for supposed 25mbps.
Comcast,3akpim,nkris,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:45:11 2015 UTC,59 for 12 months on 105Mbps and Basic TV but the data caps are fucking ridiculous
Comcast,3akpim,maximumvaldez,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:43:52 2015 UTC,"$44.99 for Blast internet only (supposed 50mbps) plus $10 modem rental fee. However I am in one of the lovely area running a ""trial"" for charging for going over your data cap. This past month Comcast states we have used 668gb of data so with extra fees our bill for internet only was $134.99. I still cannot get an explanation on how we are using this much data.  I would switch but there is no other viable option for internet in my area."
Comcast,3akpim,800_Pound_Gorilla,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:17:53 2015 UTC,"Woh im sorry. We are not, but weve used close to 1100 GB this month, i cant even imagine how much that would be"
Comcast,3akpim,800_Pound_Gorilla,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:25:49 2015 UTC,I was told on the phone yesterday when speaking to a Comcast technical specialist that this data cap and the associated charges is being rolled out nationwide soon. When that happens the cap will be 300gb per month with a $10 charge for every 50gb you go over that cap. If you were in my area now and you used 1068gb you would have an extra $160 added to your monthly bill.
Comcast,3akpim,antihexe,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:10:55 2015 UTC,Oh god
Comcast,3akpim,SandovalCurse,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:45:03 2015 UTC,i'll immediately switch to the much more expensive direct service if they roll out the data cap here. I'll even switch my business line (which has no data cap).   I have both services currently.
Comcast,3akpim,800_Pound_Gorilla,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:12:26 2015 UTC,"What kills me is that from a technical perspective, charging for greater throughput makes literally no sense. That's what my degree is in, so I know what I'm talking about, and I can tell you that makes literally zero sense."
Comcast,3akpim,samaiii,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:03:43 2015 UTC,You know what's weird? We just pay for Blast Internet ($55 a month) but we have a cable box we got from a friend and it works so we can watch free cable. And today I found we have a free HBO subscription as well? I find it really odd. Do you think if we bought another box that it would work for free?
Comcast,3akpim,Casmer,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:11:07 2015 UTC,Truthfully I have no idea. It is my understanding that HBO  was running a free weekend promotion so it would be interesting to see if you still have that after the promotion ends.
Comcast,3akpim,JC-Pose,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:15:29 2015 UTC,"That cable box is probably still tied to their account, so that's why it works."
Comcast,3ajzl5,i-framed-rogerrabbit,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:08:32 2015 UTC,Go ahead and tweet @ComcastCares or email we_can_help@cable.comcast.com that you need your internet account transferred and you are out of service until it's fixed. There is almost no reason I can think of that will take nearly that long to transfer internet from one account to another.
Comcast,3aizcd,mugged99,5,Sat Jun 20 17:31:14 2015 UTC,That seems off.
Comcast,3aizcd,JaysRooted,3,Sat Jun 20 17:36:58 2015 UTC,Or be could be scanning the information in on the bottom to put it in the system.
Comcast,3aizcd,firedfromcomcast,2,Sat Jun 20 20:03:35 2015 UTC,"thats what was done with the serial number on the box the modem came in, the scanning, and then he phoned it in with a comcast lady to set it up, then wired it up and waited like 10 minutes for bootup. Then tested it. Then took the pictures - what for?"
Comcast,3aizcd,Lega-c,5,Sat Jun 20 20:22:43 2015 UTC,"I'm a tech and I do this fairly often.  Rarely on customer modems but all the time on the Comcast gateways.  It's so when I'm setting up the wifi on the customer computers, tablets,  phones,  etc.  I don't have to keep picking up the modem to read the password off.  I bet that's what that tech was doing."
Comcast,3aizcd,randomdude21,2,Sun Jun 21 02:41:52 2015 UTC,"he did not setup any devices. my desktop was on ethernet and doesnt need a password, worked immediately. I setup my laptop myself. Basically took the pictures and left the house."
Comcast,3aizcd,jeff429v,2,Sun Jun 21 03:28:23 2015 UTC,If you're worried change the wifi password there is nothing else of interest

Comcast,3ajfei,smiling_stranger,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:56:30 2015 UTC,We don't have the ability to change any settings on your router
Comcast,3ajfei,thecw,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:31:59 2015 UTC,any idea as to why its happening? i reset my router and ll my ips are 192.168 as assigned by the belkin router. then at some time all the ips on my network get changed to 10.x.x which is the comcast gateway but i dont have any comcast equipment. its strange
Comcast,3ajfei,thecw,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:49:00 2015 UTC,which is the comcast gateway but i dont have any comcast equipment   192.168.1.0/24 and 10.0.0.0/24 are the two standard private (not routable to the internet) IP address spaces. The Comcast gateway just happens to use the 10 space.  I can't tell you why your router would be randomly changing its subnet. Have you tried re-flashing the firmware? Do you have any other devices on your network handing out DHCP leases?  I'm not familiar with the Zoom 1294 modem. Are you sure it isn't a modem-router combo?
Comcast,3ajfei,thecw,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:54:24 2015 UTC,"yes 100% its just a modem.when it changes over to the 10.x.x i can connect to a comcast gateway which shows my devices but it also shows atleast 1 device that is not mine, very confusing. i did just reset to factory and have it back onto the original ips. i guess ill wait to see if it changes again. Thanks for reply."
Comcast,3ajfei,profmonocle,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:05:58 2015 UTC,"What do you mean you can connect to a Comcast gateway? Are you perhaps connecting to someone else's open wifi network near you? Perhaps with a default SSID like ""linksys"" or ""netgear""?"
Comcast,3ajfei,antihexe,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:35:32 2015 UTC,"no, it was my ssid but under this new ip configuration. ah, wish i could explain it better. it would let me see thisthe pictures in this link  which is something i have never had to use. but i did discover i had another device on my network that had dhcp server active on it and might be the thing causing my main routers to be bypassed, and reassigning everything"
Comcast,3ajfei,thecw,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:16:35 2015 UTC,"It's possible the router somehow went into bridge mode, which would cause what you're saying. The router being in bridge mode would mean it's acting like a switch, which would make your connected devices behave like they're plugged into the gateway directly.  I'm not sure how that would happen, but to be honest, Belkin routers are horrible, so I wouldn't put it past one to fail this way.  Can you try resetting the router? Usually there's a reset button on the back that you might have to push with a paperclip. If you hold that down for 10-20 seconds it should do a full reset and possibly fix this."
Comcast,3ajfei,antihexe,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:49:51 2015 UTC,"That's not quite true, is it? You guys put the gateways (arris tg862, etc.) into bridge mode all of the time. Hahaha."

Comcast,3ag864,BBGG-LOL,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:13:38 2015 UTC,If they promised you that offer with a certain price. Hold them to it. Keep saying that you were lied to and they will have to accept it. Tell them the only reason you accepted the offer was because of what it had and the low price since you are a new customer. Sometimes you may have to call a few times because some reps don't want to do the work.
Comcast,3ag864,ZukaZamam3e,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:26:41 2015 UTC,"All companies are like this. At least the ones who have call center operations are.  The CSR is not there to serve you. She is there to get you off the phone as quickly as possible, while using a few of the company's resources as possible (including time on the phone, which is counted to the second). They generally follow a scripts that resembles the tips on the web site. They often have little training other than a few general rules and instructions on how to read off a screen. Some reps are very helpful, but many are the bottom of the affirmative action/outsourcing/McJob barrel.  So NEVER EVER call the company, Comcast or whoever, unless you have no other options. If you need a refund or a service call, you need to talk to them. But if you just want to check your bill or have a technical question, just look that up on the web site."
Comcast,3ag864,mttechdude,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:03:26 2015 UTC,"See, that is the issue. Customer Service should in fact be customer service. They need to be better trained and not lie so that they can get a sale and get you off the phone."
Comcast,3ag864,sab2055,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:54:49 2015 UTC,They don't necessarily get anything for a sale. They just want you  to get off the phone and go away.  It isn't just Comcast. Every company that contracts to call centers does this. That's why you should resolve your issues on the web site and use the phones as a last resort.
Comcast,3ag864,sanfordthemanford,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:46:10 2015 UTC,"I just wish it wasn't like that, especially when you have to call in because your internet fails every few minutes and is unreliable.
