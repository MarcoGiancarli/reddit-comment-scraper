I have seen this done in many cases in the past, but have never bought one as they are undesirable aesthetically in my eye. As far as blowing air towards or pulling air away from the GPUs goes, you might want to run some tests to figure out which works best. My guess is that blowing room temperature air onto hot GPUs works better, but that also spreads that heat out to the rest of your system.   Another thing to think about is whether or not you want a high or low static pressure inside of your case. In the name of silence, I'd say you likely want a higher static pressure. So if you have three fans in the front blowing in, one in the top blowing out, and one in the back blowing out, I would aim the side fan inwards. Hopefully this helps."

You can always reuse most of the stuff (res, pump, fittings,etc) so there's no reason to not buy the quality parts from the start.

So if you sent a 255 or a 0, the lights would be turned on full brightness or off respectively.  In the C# program I wrote, I used the BASS.NET library (http://bass.radio42.com/) to monitor levels of devices directly from windows using the BASS_WASAPI addon. Once you get that you have to just monitor the low end and send a byte with the level of the bass (or just a 255 whenever it hits a certain level) to the arduino which will replicate it with the lights. And obviously I added in a few extra ""modes"" for it.  I'll probably be putting the code up on Github eventually if you're interested."

You'd just have to measure the length and width you want, then also make 2 ""flaps""  that you will bend.  To make the flaps it's pretty easy, just measure the OAL and OAW, then cut the chunk out that isn't needed with a hand saw.

Tomorrow I will start to fill the loops and do some leak testing.  If all goes well with that, I'll start up the pc and check my temps.  In the mean time, I'll take the 4 black side door latches and move them from the unwindowed doors to the newly powder coated windowed ones.

I could have just paid less if I had learned first about professional stripping - and in my case, the stripping company also does powder coating, and I have become addicted to it :)  If you REALLY want the stripping and painting to look nice, consider drilling out the rivets on the case so you can work on each case part individually.

It's not permanent so if you mess up you can peel it off but it's durable enough to last for years. You can use real paint but it's more expensive (almost triple the cost in sandpaper, primer and paint) plus if you mess up its hard to undo.   If you do go with plasti dip, all you have to do is clean the shroud and apply 1 partial coat, wait 15 mins apply a second full coat wait 30 mins and apply a 3rd full coat. Make sure to paint inside in like a bathroom or garage, painting outside causes imperfections."

If you're up for it, grab the black wire and the yellow wire from both your molex plug and your fan, cut them and strip the plastic off and twist them together in pair (black with black and yellow with yellow) and finish off with some tape to insulate. Even better if you have any kind of screw terminal you could fasten them in.   In regards to the placement of the fan, and this maybe a terrible idea so please correct me if it's stupid, maybe place it above the card, with half and inch to spare, over the GPU and blow on the card to disperse the warm air. Or if you have any fans that sucks out air in the top/back of your case, place it closer and suck the warm air up so it can be removed from the case."

pcmods,3cdlic,Makirole,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:06:17 2015 UTC,Could have used rigid tubing?  Would have given those straight lines you're after and likely would have been much cheaper as you wouldn't need the millions of adapters.

pcmods,3cdlic,Waxew,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:48:57 2015 UTC,"I've been using it since 2012, don't even consider soft tubing an option anymore.  The main issue is that it's simply harder to do.  Soft thbing is easy, you connect A to B and occassionally route things to avoid kinks or silly lines.  Rigid tubing isn't like that.  You have to plan your routes carefully and be precise, you also have to take into account things like bend locations and filling/draining the system.  IMO the results are easily worth it.  The other issue is hat you can't use normal compression fittings.  All the angled adapters work fine as they're just standard threads, but you have to use rigid compressions or push fittings.  Rather than compressing the tubing, they compress an O-ring around the outside, which is crucial.  You should pop over to /r/watercooling and check out the Gallery/Choice Gallery over there to get a good idea of what can be done with it.  My first ""proper"" rig back in late 2012 used it, as did my most recent one, although that may not be the best example given it was about 30cm of the stuff."

pcmods,3bvplu,saadat4533,3,Sat Jul 4 04:52:24 2015 UTC,Not a problem.  When I did mine I actually ditched the power supply completely since the strip and controller are natively 12 volts and soldered a Molex connector to the controller.  The wall adapter is a separate piece made to plug into the controller so no chopping was required there.  :)  Tip if you do get one of these or one like it: Don't get the waterproof version.

The plasti-dip you linked def looks cool, but i would be concerned about ESD and heat dissipation.  Heat is probably fine if you mask off/remove the heat sinks before plasti-dipping it. I would definitely keep the board grounded while spraying it though. You can ground it via the power plug."
pcmods,3buqhc,Probate_Judge,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:52:18 2015 UTC,Thanks for feedback. Are you that much worried about ESD? I'm not sur I understood how you want me to ground the mobo though
pcmods,3buqhc,ceverhar,3,Thu Jul 2 14:59:05 2015 UTC,"ESD is Electrostatic Discharge. It's what kills electronics. A small zap may not kill your mobo, but it can degrade the lifespan of the component and cause latent failures. When you feel a shock, its a few thousand volts. You can discharge (shock) things and not even feel it in the hundreds of volt range. It's a HUGE deal in the electronics world.  If you live in the US, the wall receptacle is NEMA 5-15R. You can see in the diagram the middle round plug is ground. This goes to earth ground, as in the electricity dissipates ultimately into the earth/ground/dirt.  You can plug in your power supply and attach the power cable to the motherboard. If you zap the mobo, the ESD has a path to ground via the power connector to the PSU to the wall to ground. The PSU doesn't need to be on for this to happen. Earth ground is the safety backup, so it's always wired.  If you have the PSU mounted in your PC AND plugged into the wall, the entire chassis is grounded. This means all the components are safe. The mobo probably uses the standoffs as a ground connection as well. Best practice is to install the PSU first, plug it in to ground it, then stand in one spot and touch the computer case. This then grounds you and helps protect your components. Wrist straps can ground you as well. Moving around a bunch creates static charge, so best not to work on your PC in wool socks on a carpeted floor.  So for your application, I would mask off everything using blue 3M painters tape. This tape is ESD safe, others are too, but I've verified that this one is for sure. Plug in the PSU to the mobo and into the wall to ground everything. Then spray, etc. Obviously this is the most anal way of going about it."
pcmods,3buqhc,paathurnaxe,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:21:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah thanks for this but i know what ESD is and what it can do to electrical components. I was just surprised you though that painting the mobo could lead to ESD problems, since nothing touch the components except the paint (which is made of plastic). Thanks for your advice anyway !"
pcmods,3buqhc,ceverhar,2,Thu Jul 2 17:00:55 2015 UTC,"It seems like you don't know what ESD is since you are surprised plastics are involved.  Static is built up on non-conductive things such as plastics and rubber because it has no where to go.  Rubbing a balloon on your hair and making your hair stand up on end?  That is static, when that discharges through metal, such as motherboard components, is when it can cause damage.  This is why it is a bad idea to use a vacuum to suck dust out of your computer, all that air rushing out over the plastic tube can create a charge, and when that charge gets big enough it can leap to metal components, just like when you get shocked on a metal doorknob before you actually touch it.  Anything that gathers a charge in that way(fabrics, hair, plastics, rubber, etc) is collecting a positive charge, which will always want to jump to something more conductive with less potential(eg a more negative charge or ground) at the first opportunity.  That is what ESD is.  This is why people use grounding straps, humidity causes less ESD(humidity is conductive so static dissipates instead of gathering), special vacuums and blowers are electrically grounded with metal, and ESD bags like for computer components seem like plastics but are actually special materials all to give any stray charges somewhere to go or otherwise discourage collection of a charge."

pcmods,3bvjjn,Juckie,2,Thu Jul 2 14:29:21 2015 UTC,I'm sure you could. You may be able to splice the cable going to the fan and drag that off to the LED strip. Just make sure you satisfy the voltage and amperage requirements of the fan AND strip.

pcmods,3bu0km,Rauma,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:47:31 2015 UTC,"Best solution I found for cooling GPUs when mining altcoins but whilst still wanting to keep the side on the case due to my toddler being in the room some times was to cut a hole in the perspex side panel window directly above where the GPU was and simply mount a 140mm fan blowing air into the card.  This dropped temps on the card by about 15 degrees and cost less than Â£12 for the fan and a grill to keep little fingers out. Not much use if you already have a side panel fan though unless it's miles from your GPU.  Whilst I like your idea I can't help thinking you're blowing warm air against the PCB, having room temperature air dragged in is going to be far more beneficial"

pcmods,3bqrin,VengefulCaptain,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:52:08 2015 UTC,You want max airflow past your components.  So if you have a couple of front intake fans and a rear and top exaust fan then I doubt you will notice  a difference.  You could always make one out of cardboard and experiment with slots in different places.  But most cases would see a bigger difference from changes in ambient temp than extra side vents.

I've been considering going the G10 route for a while now (I have a 280, may upgrade to 290 before doing this), and my only 140mm area is taken by the X41 cooling my CPU. so I could go with either a 120mm radiator or a 240mm radiator. I'm leaning towards the latter, simply because I'll have even lower temps.  EDIT: Also, if you haven't replaced the stock X41 fan already, the Rosewill Hyperborea is an absurdly quiet fan. I'd go for it, it's cheap."

Admittedly I am using two noctua fans, so they'll give a little more performance than the stock fan.  And I set my fan curve more for acoustics than performance,  I'm sure I could lower the peak temp at the expense of some noise if I wanted to.

pcmods,3abkvx,wes2les,2,Thu Jun 18 19:44:41 2015 UTC,"The first question isn't airflow, set that aside. Your first question is: What do I want this desk to look like? ""Desk"" could describe anything from a tiny wooden schooldesk to a marble obelisk. Materials is key.   Then you have to think about orientation and access. Your box kind of looks like the ""surface"" of your desk/table and you would access components by taking the top surface of the desk/table off (a 6' X 3' sheet of wood, for example). Is that really practical?  Having built desks like this before I can tell you your best bet is not a desk with the computer itself built-in, but a desk with a ""slot"" for a more conventional case. Especially a wooden desk.   If I really wanted to build a computer INTO a desk (I wanted to keep things small or neat) I would be using aluminum and glass."
pcmods,3abkvx,rtechie1,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:31:50 2015 UTC,"i was thinking of either wood or aluminum (aluminum I need to figure out where I would get some, the type, and pricing) Basically wanted a new and bigger desk that could also house a computer in and have more desk room, as well as look cool. Space is indeed an issue where I am.  That is pretty much how I envisioned it: the surface would have a cover on top that is taken off to access the components. I am not a hardcore overclocker, so the only time I ever open up my case is when something goes wrong or I'm adding/replacing components (less than once a month) I also am considering making it so the computer is in a drawer that can be pulled out as well, but more concerned about airflow first."
pcmods,3abkvx,rtechie1,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:46:19 2015 UTC,"I forgot to ask: What's your budget? Presumably it's pretty big.   If you're not planning on spending $1000 USD+ I would stop. You can purchase something better off-the-shelf.    (aluminum I need to figure out where I would get some, the type, and pricing)   If you don't have access to a metal shop having everything custom cut will be very expensive.   I also am considering making it so the computer is in a drawer    Which is what I did. What I built was a ""vertical"" desk that had drawers for the computer and keyboard and shelves for peripherals. Not really great for cooling. I made it out of oak and it was unbelievably heavy.   If I was building for space, I'd go aluminum. A thin, small, wooden desk would be pretty flimsy (think IKEA)."

No doubt I will probably recycle parts as well (I may in fact may tear up some old cases for some of the parts) I'm thinking i may stick to wood with metal parts here and there, with the top mainly consisting of wood (with removeable glass and wood panels for the computer parts)  Again, it is a rough draft and I am trying to figure out a good idea for cooling (yes it may not be optimal, but I don't want to gimp on it either) The main issue right now is air cooling.

pcmods,3achqu,rm4m,2,Fri Jun 19 02:33:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, first guess is oil (fish eye type stuff) or incompatibility.  But it could also be you're spraying it on too thick.  When you get done with a pass, does it look like you barely painted?  I'm not sure if the same is true for plastidip, but for spray paint if you go on too thick it looks like bubbles / spider webs / cracked glass.  You want light coast, dustings.  Build it up slowly.  First coat you should still see much underneath.  Also, could be high humidity."

pcmods,3a6r6z,MrWonder1,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:28:34 2015 UTC,"120mm fan holes or windows are a solid start, u-molding can cover up small mistakes. A blowhole fan or creatimg 120mm mounts where old 80's were are practical. Draw out your cuts, don't just try to freehand right away. With practice, you can get some nice freehand cutouts, but early you're likely to have the dremel skip and scratch things up.  A 1/8th"" drillbit chews threw rivets, perfect for removing extra cages or tearing a while case down to paint. You can buy a cheap rivet gun to put things back together. A flat black interior paintjob does wonders for hiding flaws, and black cabling blends in.  Plastic parts should use a plastic primer, or a vinyl dye, or the paint will wear terribly.  My personal favorite is the stealth mod, the oldest case you can get, only internal mods to fit modern parts, and have the ghetto beast. I snagged this model at a swap meet with the stickers is surprisingly good condition. As I dig up spare parts, I plan to drop a gtx680 and i7-860 into it. If I can squeeze them in, I'll use an AIO water cooler and duct the airflow."
pcmods,3a6r6z,rodrosenberg,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:37:44 2015 UTC,Old cases are super fun to mod! I had a blast modding this case during Nvidia's MOD24 contest  http://imgur.com/a/zyOEN#pw5OXVp  This had more work then just a normal ATX case but the biggest things to work with is cutting a window and then upgrading the cooling with 120mm or bigger fans. After that add some killer paint and led lighting!   Feel free to ask us questions at http://facebook.com/bsmods

I don't know about the Kraken G10, but I did read an interesting thought here:    If I was to do it I wouldn't use two AIOs unless I already had them lying around. i'd get a g10 for one card, a standard watercooler block for the other card, and get a thermaltake extreme? (the one that is a swifttech rippoff, but with a round pump head) It has clamps on th hose instead of being fused, so you can add the water block to the loop. No only is it cheaper, but one of your cards can potentially be single slot."

pcmods,39zgfw,Thiswontblowyourmind,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:06:50 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I might have made that too confusing. The only card that works with the HG10 N970 is the ITX board, since the N970 also fits on the GTX 760 (another ITX board). It's weird, because the cooler looks identical to the N980, which is a full length PCB, but that's just how it is. The Kraken G10 would fit your card, but you could probably only have 1, since it takes up 2+ slots.  Hope that helped :)"

pcmods,39vth4,WhiteLightMods,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:53:32 2015 UTC,Definitely print design and place behind the panel you are etching. A scribing tool is anything that will scratch the acrylic. Having a light source that can be moved around to help you see is useful.

If this is just a bare LCD panel and you have no clue who the manufacturer or part number is, give up now or you will go absolutely crazy. If you have the driver board(s) and it has a common interface type (composite video, yellow RCA) then you merely have to supply power and a compatible video signal. You'll have to look around for a way to get a current computer system to output the signal, likely using some form of adapter. As far as software, if you have it set as an extension of your desktop, then there are a great many types of software that you can simply move over there to display. Heck, you could even play movies on it.    Really though, if it's not immediately compatible I'd consider ditching it and finding another panel that you can interface properly.
