streetwear,3dzhe5,TristanIsSpiffy,8,Tue Jul 21 06:08:49 2015 UTC,Bape College tees   This just made me realize... it would be pretty awesome to see a college University do a one-off collab with some brand like Bape for college shirts.

streetwear,3dzhe5,RobSurrealRTR,3,Mon Jul 20 20:40:59 2015 UTC,Bape US shop. Tbh this will probably be my first and last pickup from the US store... shit was $110 after shipping and buying it from Japan via proxy is much cheaper.
streetwear,3dzhe5,RobSurrealRTR,9,Mon Jul 20 20:54:18 2015 UTC,the prices is ridiculous but i guess your fresh at the end of the day.
streetwear,3dzhe5,sushimi123,4,Mon Jul 20 21:32:08 2015 UTC,"I know if you can buy directly from Japan it's about $60, do you know how much a proxy would add onto that?"

streetwear,3e0ews,secretly_not_obama,13,Tue Jul 21 00:14:05 2015 UTC,what part of this is soccer related? I like the gats tho
streetwear,3e0ews,scoot_footzgerald,5,Tue Jul 21 00:27:18 2015 UTC,SAMBA
streetwear,3e0ews,lluisrojass,6,Tue Jul 21 01:47:20 2015 UTC,"Adidas has indoor soccer shoes, sambas, that are also modeled off the GATS."
streetwear,3e0ews,scoot_footzgerald,10,Tue Jul 21 00:31:05 2015 UTC,oh I thought you meant you were playing soccer in these or something
streetwear,3e0ews,RocksTheSocks,2,Tue Jul 21 00:37:25 2015 UTC,"Haha no, just joking"
streetwear,3e0ews,glo_boys,4,Tue Jul 21 00:40:49 2015 UTC,"On the real tho, Sambas are some of the best shoes ever. Super comfy, timeless, and indestructible.  I've played soccer on 3 beaches in 3 continents with them, on a frozen lake with them, even more on real soccer fields, and just generally beat them to crap and they still hold strong. Plus they actually can look good worn out."
streetwear,3e0ews,RocksTheSocks,3,Tue Jul 21 05:13:24 2015 UTC,"fucking love my sambas. I'm glad they're getting love here, people never talk about them on this sub for some reason"
streetwear,3e0ews,glo_boys,2,Tue Jul 21 05:57:22 2015 UTC,Oh for sure man. My black pair are my beaters that I have an emotional bond with and my white pair are the ones I keep icy.   Just such a great shoe especially for the price. I got my white ones for $30 on black Friday at an adidas outlet store
streetwear,3e0ews,RocksTheSocks,3,Tue Jul 21 06:04:39 2015 UTC,my white ones are my beaters... and they look great
streetwear,3e0ews,teen_dad,2,Tue Jul 21 06:16:56 2015 UTC,A kid at my school uses his white pair as beaters too and I've seen that he has some paint drip stains on them somehow and it makes them look really cool
streetwear,3e0ews,RocksTheSocks,4,Tue Jul 21 14:58:53 2015 UTC,...reminds me of a similar shoe with paint splatters on it
streetwear,3e0ews,RocksTheSocks,2,Tue Jul 21 15:28:31 2015 UTC,"Haha no it isn't those, they were definitely sambas with powder blue paint dripped on/spilled in"
streetwear,3e0ews,downvote_me_moreYOLO,3,Tue Jul 21 17:02:45 2015 UTC,"As a soccer player, I couldn't buy these because at some point the urge to play would overcome the urge to keep these minty..."
streetwear,3e0ews,downvote_me_moreYOLO,4,Tue Jul 21 05:14:24 2015 UTC,The toe box is like 99% similar to my Adidas Samba's right now after 1 year of design and wear.
streetwear,3e0ews,downvote_me_moreYOLO,2,Tue Jul 21 00:32:44 2015 UTC,What do you mean by design?
streetwear,3e0ews,Casberg,4,Tue Jul 21 00:33:54 2015 UTC,"The toe box itself, its aesthetic, the way it's shaped with the suede and leather, looks extremely similar if not identical to the Samba's toe box."

Heading back to a cold Pittsburgh Fall in a few weeks, so I picked up this bomber from from the Black Scale brick and mortar store on La Brea for $235. Dug the Crown of Thorns Christ print on the sleeves.  (I don't know what its official name is as it's not in their webshop and all the sales people were intimidatingly cool looking so I fronted.)"

streetwear,3e0va7,raibaa,2,Tue Jul 21 05:27:16 2015 UTC,"this is a really dope jacket, i wish it had a zipper instead of buttons though. try wearing it with a shorter inner layer, so it's more obvious that you're wearing drop crotch pants (also makes u look taller), and it'll make the bomber stand out more, which would look even better then!"
streetwear,3e0va7,vix-,3,Tue Jul 21 08:13:04 2015 UTC,dude really edgy.
streetwear,3e0va7,Techniik,2,Tue Jul 21 18:29:10 2015 UTC,The drop crotch pants make your legs look really short. The bomber ain't bad though.

streetwear,3e1p4w,hafis101,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:03:27 2015 UTC,Here's an example of what I mean:http://m.us.topman.com/h5/product?productId=19500477&geoip=noredirect&cmpid=ppc_pla_US_ip&istCompanyId=36bf3010-3004-4e0d-9440-d1e9655d3735&istItemId=rltxxpipm&istBid=tztx
streetwear,3e1p4w,Kerry_coc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:13:42 2015 UTC,"Well in clothing you often refer to symmetry as in ""does the pieces fit together, and it creates a symmetry?"" or ""Does the colours of the pieces fit together in a symmetrical manner""?. Thus a asymmetrical pieces can fit together in a symmetry.  Designers like Rick Owens often make asymmetrical pieces example  which can get put together into a ""fit"" where the pieces go along well and then creates a symmetry.   I think that we are on the same page but i just felt the need to explain further what i mean."
streetwear,3e1p4w,hafis101,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:05:16 2015 UTC,"Yea and I stated   Symmetry has nothing todo with it being bad   It's a bad fit, I agree with you on that part but an outfit can still be good if it's not symmetrical, I see people pulling off asymmetrical distressed shirts and pants all the time that are good."

The white pairs are essentials but if you live in a place where it gets mucky during the winter you should always have a black pair handy.   Here are some kicks to start off with  1) Air maxes (white, black, ) There are various colorways to work with.   2) Converse (you can go for a classic pair of chucks or a pair of lows again both colorways. The bonus about chucks is durability ive been wearing the same pair of black leather chucks for over 4 years.   3) New Balance - These guys make premium quality shoes in various colorways most times they are relatively affordable in comparison to many other kicks on the market.

streetwear,3e061x,thomasfromSA,2,Tue Jul 21 06:54:17 2015 UTC,You can apply that logic to anything. 'A t-shirt for $40 probably costed $1.00' so I think it's relatively insignificant to mention production values (unless we're discussing the industry itself rather than how the clothes look). Quit trying to downplay his purchase.

Actually, why are you on a fashion sub if that's your mentality? Couldn't you just buy cheap clothes at Goodwill and put your money to better use? No need to pay extra for a $2 screen print, or pay more for them to cut your clothes before you get them. Right?"

streetwear,3e03qk,yungfluff,2,Tue Jul 21 04:10:58 2015 UTC,I chose to spell Antigone the way I did on purpose for multiple reasons
streetwear,3e03qk,muertinez,2,Tue Jul 21 04:11:58 2015 UTC,Care to share that with us?
streetwear,3e03qk,CommanderVinegar,2,Tue Jul 21 04:33:24 2015 UTC,"yup, I want the brand pronounced [anne-tee-gone], not [anne-tie-gone] so that helps with that. I also like the way Antegone looks with two e's more"
streetwear,3e03qk,HelperBot_,2,Tue Jul 21 04:36:48 2015 UTC,"Not tryna be a dick. Antegone looks like it should be pronounced [an-teh-gOHn].  Also, Antigone is pronounced [an-tig-ah-nee], which already sounds like [an-tee-gohn-ee].  Not sure its as intuitve as you believe."
streetwear,3e03qk,_p_daddy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:11:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why you guys saw it / pronounced it that way. But ""ante"" is an actual word and its pronunciation is [anne-tee] just like I want. Thank you for the feedback though"
streetwear,3e03qk,SUPR3M3B3ING,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:33:34 2015 UTC,Yes ante is a word and yes it is pronounced like that but because it's not on its own but rather followed by a g it looks like it would be pronounced differently.

streetwear,3e0rrh,yungfluff,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:24:26 2015 UTC,Hmm interesting. I've never really heard of an artist under contract recording anything without label approval in the first place.

Like someone wearing a sweater, jeans, and Chelsea boots can get upvoted to the top of a wdywt thread and I honestly do not see how that is streetwear. Things that I've always associated with streetwear; like Jordans, Bape, and graphic tees, are shamed on this sub."
streetwear,3dyizw,Nudie,4,Mon Jul 20 20:33:14 2015 UTC,"Graphic tees and BAPE are shamed on this sub? I thought it was the opposite. Jordan's probably are though, besides 1s of course.   To be honest the line between streetwear and high end fashion has been blurring more and more over the years due to brands like HBA and off-white breaking into the high fashion realm and high fashion houses borrowing styles that were originally a streetwear brand thing to do (heavy graphic tees by Givenchy and Raf come to mind)."

This sub gets boners over stuff like plain white tees or biker jeans which both are things that never really struck me as streetwear, and more as just plain fashion. I know I'm the minority with my opinion tho. To me, this guys fit is the type of stuff I like, and stuff like this is what I mean when I talk about things that don't really seem very streetwear."

streetwear,3dyizw,sheffers,2,Mon Jul 20 21:06:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's true. Obviously you're affected by your surroundings, that much is a given, and like I said before it's different strokes for different folks. I personally don't think of them as streetwear, maybe it's cause I used to wear them when I was 16 and going to shitty indie nights haha  I guess you gotta find the line between what's streetwear fashion, and what's straight fashion.

Also this sub loves to tell people to buy and wear what they want or if you think its dope then its dope. I don't really agree with that idea but regardless, why is it ok for people in this sub to buy and wear what they want, but its not ok for other people in different subs to do that?

I think this has its own aesthetic with a medieval woodprint vibe.

streetwear,3dzddr,Hamster_Huey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:37:56 2015 UTC,"Definitely recommend Geos, KVAs, and SLPs.  They are higher-end but definitely my favorites.  I've worn the high-top CPs but definitely prefer their lows as they are much cleaner.  My Geos are my favorite; they're very bulky so you can't just throw them on any outfit since silhouette is important with such a large shoe. They work well with the RO look: drapey clothing with monochromatic tones with an emphasis on shape of the entire outfit. They require more thought and cohesion than the other two.  I wouldn't say I like my SLPs more than my KVAs but they definitely do different things. The multilace is messier and works for a much more casual look where as the SLPs are very clean and sleek. They work a lot better with modern fits where everything is slim-cut and fitted."

But if you're on a budget, it doesn't get much better than sk8 his to start you off. Also, there's often a decent selection of high top shoes at dept stores/the rack. Usually some dunks or creative recs, but every once in a while, you'll get totally surprised by some dope designer kicks for a huge discount."

If you wanted to dig a little deeper in order to try and find some more boots that look like the CDB, I would personally try /r/malefashionadvice as they seem to really like the CDB.

streetwear,3dv9wt,GimmeYourTags,17,Sun Jul 19 20:34:34 2015 UTC,"Also, I think a lot of it has to do with hiphop artists and urban youth appropriating RL and TH to an extent.  These brands are not made for hiphop artists or streetwear, they stood for middle class, white, suburban lifestyle. So when people ""make it"" or they come into some level of income, they would of course buy things that aren't for them, as a way of subverting that classism.   That in turn became its own aesthetic, appropriating higher end, middle class brands into streetwear, as a subtle way of telling people that don't want us, that we're here"

Was worn by football hooligans in Britain from the early 80's - mid 90's, as were brands such as Stone Island and many other brands you wouldn't consider part of streetwear. The brands attracted these kinds of people and over the years integrated into the British streetwear fashion.      Here's a quote I found: ""In exchange for giving artists free wardrobes, Hilfiger found its name mentioned in both rhyming verses of rap songs and their ‘shout-out’ lyrics, in which rap artists chant out thanks to friends and sponsors for their support. Hilfiger's success convinced other large mainstream American fashion design companies, like Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein, to tailor lines to the lucrative market of hip-hop artists and fans.""      Pretty much explained how it happened within America. Since the UK and the US are where streetwear pretty much developed, I guess people looked to those places for inspiration and that's brands got integrated in other countries streetwear fashion."

My first time buying these t-shirts was in December and I'm gonna cop some more because of the nice quality and reasonable price point ~$30.  I bought a couple white t-shirts, too, but they yellowed fast. First time buying white shirts, and I just got some white detergent from the store yesterday so I'm gonna try to make them white again. Not sure if their cotton yellows or I just suck at washing. Ice only washed the whites twice, and I've only worn them about three times due to the yellowish hue.   TL:DR try Stüssy."

And before any dumb-ass tries to say resellers should get a job, most of them do have jobs! It's called a damn side-hustle...I know a doctor who makes $350,000 per year who resells on the side. Quick example: He has 10 pairs of Fragment 1's that are currently worth at least $10,000 in pure profit. He's holding onto them in DS condition and is going to sell when they're worth even more!

When you grow up, get a job, have bills, financially support others, and understand the value of money, you'll realize that you're being an idiot right now for being against people making easy money. I know people who are very well off and still resell because guess what! Money makes the world go round...only a child and broke people who aren't go-getters think like you, sorry.

I mean, yeah, there is a market for it and  the system works for those that participate, but at the same time, there are people who would like to be able to buy the same product at the same price those resellers are buying without the intention to resell."

There's no point to complain about it when there's literally nothing you can do about resellers and honestly, I don't hate resellers. They set the market for a lot of items and somewhat determine hype. The best part about resellers is when they buy shit from a supreme drop just to realize that it won't sell for over retail, then I get a steal bc of some kid trying to make a few bucks."

streetwear,3dtuja,TheyCaughtTheVapors,2,Sun Jul 19 20:27:49 2015 UTC,"I think reselling is fine, like other people have said, if an item doesn't fit as they expected or they just didn't end up liking it or wearing it anymore and they aren't reselling at a super high value. Reselling for a profit is pretty wack in my opinion though. One of the ways to combat reselling is to never buy at these rape prices, and therefore no reseller could ever sell at such a high price. Prices are based off demand, so if no one demands the item at a certain price, it must go down in order for the reseller to sell it, but of course there's always going to be at least one person who is willing to pay at such a price and this kind of sets the standard resell price for items unfortunately."
streetwear,3dtuja,bullsfan281,2,Mon Jul 20 03:55:30 2015 UTC,Blame the suppliers for not producing enough quantity to meet demand. Arbitrage will always be with us as long as it is profitable.

streetwear,3dsvc2,Jentlemann,2,Sun Jul 19 03:37:36 2015 UTC,"I was there just a couple of weeks ago. There were <15 people in all of the Bape stores I went to, I wouldn't expect any queues at all unless you go just before a release."
streetwear,3dsvc2,Jentlemann,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:42:50 2015 UTC,Sounds good. Just wondering which store did you go to? And how was the stock compared to the online webstore?
streetwear,3dsvc2,TimInSydney,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:49:06 2015 UTC,"I went to the one in harajuku and the one in shinjuku. I was there on a Sunday about mid-afternoon. I didn't see any queues in any of the stores I went to at all (Supreme, A.P.C, Stussy, Undftd & Visvim) and it was mostly quite quiet. If you are only sending one day there I would recommend going to harajuku and shopping there, as all the good stores are there. As for catalogue, there wasn't a huge selection, I ended up picking up a red pullover and a black hoodie. A lot of the stuff was baby Milo and gimmic stuff (camo shirts ugh.) So there won't be as much selection as the website. I went in June so they will probably have updated their catalouge when you get there though. There are a few shops in Tokyo that stock old Bape stuff so if you feel really compelled to get a shark hoodie or something, try there."
streetwear,3dsvc2,fuccboi42,2,Sun Jul 19 05:55:22 2015 UTC,"I was there in May, but there was not a new release going on the day I visited the store.  I arrived ~20 minutes before the store opened, and there were a handful of people (no more than 10) already waiting outside.  Two store employees (decked out in Bape, of course) had us line up outside the entrance in two rows, like how it appears in your first picture.  It seemed as though they only let a limited number of people into the store at one time, and they progressed through both rows simultaneously, alternating one person from each.  It went quickly enough, and don't worry about being split up if you're with a group.  As long as you queued up at the same time, you'll all get in eventually.  Have fun in Tokyo!  P.S. - Assuming you're not from Japan, bring and present your passport for tax-free purchases in the store"
streetwear,3dsvc2,totesofficialCP,2,Sun Jul 19 03:48:25 2015 UTC,"Sounds good, thanks for the reply! The online store honestly sells out too quickly so I just wanted to make sure I don't walk into an empty store. How was the stock at the BAPE you visited?  And thanks! Got lots of fun and food planned ahaha"
streetwear,3dsvc2,fuccboi42,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:51:12 2015 UTC,"I visited 4 different Bape stores across Japan, and honestly the selection is fairly picked over.  There were no shark hoodies in any of them (aside from the ALIFE one at the Bapexclusive in Kyoto, but yuck).  But don't let that discourage you! There was still some really cool stuff available in all of the stores.  I bought a few cool sweaters and shirts that I personally hadn't even seen online before.  A side note, I would recommend trying on the pieces you are interested in to get a more accurate sense of the sizing.  I was under the impression that Bape sizing was a strict size smaller than the US sizing I was used to.  I expected to need a Large in everything.  Turns out I (a US Medium) can also fit a Bape Medium in a lot of their pieces.  More stuff was available in Medium than Large, so it worked out pretty well."
streetwear,3dsvc2,totesofficialCP,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:05:15 2015 UTC,"Call up Dover at market Ginza and ask if they are getting a Bape drop; for Bape x peanuts last season I went and there was a line of about 5 people...

streetwear,3ds9ml,EffThisLake,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:36:43 2015 UTC,"I have been wanting a pair of Greats Royales for a while and finally let myself spend a bit more than usual for them. They are easily the nicest feeling shoe that I have ever held and are extremely comfortable.   The only downside is that they run absolutely huge. Their site says to order half a size down, but I would go a full size or even 2 down if you're thinking of ordering them. I have Air Force 1s and New Balance 501s in size 7 and all my Vans are size 6.5s. I ordered a size 6 in these and am returning them as soon as I can for a 5 (even debating a 4. These things are gigantic). There is a good inch of space between my toes and the end of the shoe, even with going down a full size.  I also got a pair of their Bab Lows, which are nice. The sole and the mesh upper feel good, but the outside lining (maybe? Sorry, I'm not very good with what parts of shoes are called) feels like felt from art class that was glued on.  Overall, the shoes feel good and look (in my opinion) very good, though there are some issues with them."

The leather is pretty soft and the stitching is solid.  For the sizing, yeah. They're really big. 7 in NB/Nike and 6.5 in Vans and I have to exchange these because a 6 is still at least a full size too big for me."

streetwear,3dswsm,dabludclaating,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:48:00 2015 UTC,"Wont work, washing and drying them actually tightens the weave. Honestly your best option is buying some new jeans if you dont like the way they fit."
streetwear,3dswsm,scud7171,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:51:33 2015 UTC,That could definitely work marginally. Of course if they're put in the dryer they'll shrink but wet denim is quite capable of changing shape
streetwear,3dswsm,dabludclaating,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:11:32 2015 UTC,When they are wet the denim threads expand and then tighten back up when they dry. Even if you could stretch them out while they are wet they arent going to stretch out any more than they have done now with the guys wear. Its a bit of a lost cause.
streetwear,3dswsm,scud7171,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:17:34 2015 UTC,Idk this method has certainly been effective in my case. Often once a pair has gotten in the dryer there is permanent shrinkage though
streetwear,3dswsm,Koobies,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:19:35 2015 UTC,Im not talking about the dryer I mean dry naturally.
streetwear,3dswsm,scoot_footzgerald,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:21:58 2015 UTC,That's what I thought. Just thought maybe OP put his in the dryer. My point was just that hand stretching wet denim has worked for me

streetwear,3dsd6v,benetonr,5,Sun Jul 19 00:11:25 2015 UTC,"It's good to bring them back every once in a while, but recurring threads would probably start yielding the same opinions after not too long. Also the geobasket is my second favorite sneaker of all time (after the rick owens OG dunk) so if you want me to explain why I like them I'd be more than happy."

streetwear,3dsd6v,_Pallbearer_,5,Sun Jul 19 00:22:31 2015 UTC,"I personally think they exemplify many things that make a shoe great. They are obviously very loud, but that isn't because of the color scheme (If we are talking about the regular black/milk colorway) It's because of their silhouette. It doesn't quietly creep by like anything dull or boring, but it doesn't shout ""look at me!"" like some gaudy Zanotti might. These shoes stop the show because of their uniqueness, not any flashy bells or whistles. They also hold a lot of resemblance to iconic past shoes (moreso even with the dunks) but they take whatever elements they use and twist it to the point that they are distinguishable as their own piece; making what they take seem less like a copy (Hender Scheme 4sStillagreatshoe ) and more like a silent nod. Geos also sort of represent a lifestyle different than a lot of luxury brands do. It doesn't look like a big fat status symbol, like Gucci hi tops, or even some fancy jordans. Geos exist not to prove to the world how rich you are--but rather a way of leaving behind the pettiness of trying to show how cool you are with big name style. (Although with Rick becoming more of a household name that could change which is pretty sad). Geos are meant to be loved and pummeled into the ground, they aren't built for just walking around inside like many luxury shoes are. Geos are a shoe to go out into the world and live your life in; not to ""flex"" on your friends like a super limited pair of J's, and not to scowl at poor people from your penthouse suite in."

streetwear,3dp68y,gt14199,8,Sat Jul 18 02:57:07 2015 UTC,Don't get an UNDFTD hoodie when you have a budget of $200. Get a blank hoodie or one with a nice graphic.
streetwear,3dp68y,Quisnam,3,Sat Jul 18 03:04:13 2015 UTC,"Good point. Like I said, the 200 is flexible and I was only planning on getting one of those if I can find one for a good price somewhere. I personally really like the 5 strike logo and I've heard they make good quality hoodies, hence my interest. Again though, that would be only if I can find a good price on one. Thanks for the suggestion!"
streetwear,3dp68y,Quisnam,5,Sat Jul 18 03:08:14 2015 UTC,Undefeated isn't really high quality. They're comparable to mall brands like Obey and Diamond Supply in . Personally I think their designs are pretty lazy but you do you man.
streetwear,3dp68y,fuccboi42,2,Sat Jul 18 03:10:50 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I read on a thread somewhere that they feel pretty good. Are there any brands for hoodies or sweatshirts that aren't outrageously expensive but feel better than a random blank gray hoodie? Nothing against no name brands or anything like that, I just really like hoodies and I'd like to have at least 1 nicer one."
streetwear,3dp68y,Mexican_Kanye,2,Sat Jul 18 03:16:22 2015 UTC,They really aren't all that. I've owned one undefeated hoodie and it didn't hold up too well. I probably wore it like 10 times and it's not as it was before
streetwear,3dp68y,Mexican_Kanye,4,Sat Jul 18 03:45:06 2015 UTC,"Basic tees- white, black, grey, striped(b/w) you can get these from most major stores I'd suggest asos, topman, h&m and Elwood   As for coats/jackets you can't go wrong with a simple black bomber, biker jacket, or a trench coat."
streetwear,3dp68y,Mexican_Kanye,2,Sat Jul 18 03:13:52 2015 UTC,Any suggestions for brands or places to get flannels?
streetwear,3dp68y,Antyo7,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:17:07 2015 UTC,"To fit your budget I'd say uniqlo, American apparel, maybe Levi's, most flannels have pretty similar designs"
