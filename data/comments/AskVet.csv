AskVet,3e5tl1,AwsumbPossum,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:48:38 2015 UTC,I figured he was dehydrated he keeps peeing and vomiting i'm sure he's losing a lot of fluids. I got him a regular non flavored pedialyte hoping that it would help him and he drank a little but not all of it.  I'm pretty sure i'm taking to the vet tomorrow morning unless he surprises me and starts biting me in the morning and appears fine. Hes on his last series of vaccinations and has already received 3 sets and the the most recent set he received was last Thursday.

Is there anything else that was in the garbage that we should know about? Also, if she is vomiting and not able to keep anything down, she is likely dehydrated. Has she been vomiting for the whole 6 hours? Depending on the amount of H2O2 she ingested and how long she's been vomiting, I'm actually leaning towards recommending an emergency vet visit (if you can answer those questions, perhaps someone else in this sub can weigh in). If that's not something others here would push for, then you will at least need to call the vet first thing tomorrow to let them know. They will make a decision about how to proceed. Lastly, for non-emergency surgical procedures like spays and neuters, it is customary for the surgeon to instruct the owners to withhold food after 12am the night before.

That having been said, microchips can travel and it is not unusual for them to end up in areas other than their original implantation site.  Granted, this soon after implantation I find it hard to believe that it has traveled that far. I would call the facility that implanted the chip and ask where it was implanted. If they say by the shoulder blades, I would consider a vet visit to scan your cat for the microchip to ensure that the lump isn't something else. Cats don't tend to get lumps like dogs do."

AskVet,3e4l9g,CurlyCurler,2,Tue Jul 21 22:26:26 2015 UTC,"Moving doesn't need to be a big deal for your dog- but with her anxiety it may become one!  Maybe when you and your hubby are at the new home doing work, when it is safe, bring her with you. Leave some of her toys and a bed at the house so when she arrives some of her things are already there. Stress diarrhea is common. Boiled white rice and chicken can help settle their stomach.   But- her anxiety is the big issue here and needs to be addressed.  I think you need to start teaching your dog to be by herself. Separation anxiety is not fun to deal with and only gets worse as your dog gets older. All dogs develop a deep attachment to the person(s) in their lives, but they don't need to cry and wine when those people leave the room. You don't know what the future holds- you may not be able to guarantee that she will have a person with her all the time. Any dog should be able to spend time by themselves without causing damage to themselves or property and be calm and relaxed while being alone. Crates are useful in that sense, especially for smaller dogs.   I strongly suggest you contact a trainer in your area to come to your house and help you deal with your dog's anxiety.   Anti-anxiety medication also works well for dogs. Medication on its own will not solve the problem though, only mask it.  Your dog will be with you for the next 12-15 years, maybe longer! She doesn't need to battle with anxiety any more than a person does."
AskVet,3e42fl,serotonin_flood,9,Tue Jul 21 20:12:17 2015 UTC,"I can see what your vet was talking about and why she thought there might be a physeal fracture on the left distal femur. Like her, I'm not sure whether it's truly fractured or not. I think you're doing exactly the right thing by making an appointment with the orthopedic surgeon to have higher quality radiographs taken under sedation and interpreted by an expert in person. The good news is that fractures in young cats tend to heal very well. If the surgeon recommends surgery but the price is a problem for you, be sure to ask about all the treatment options and the likely outcomes of each."

But that's just my own interpretation and with no lateral to go along with it at that.  They can always do a barium study though they may be holding off on that since the cat is not eating of its own accord.    Is your kiddo still not eating at all?

AskVet,3e4a58,Schoffleine,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:08:11 2015 UTC,"That really depends on the vet and what they do with her.  You'd have to call around and see how much it'd cost just to see the vet as every practice differs in that.  Some charge office fees in addition to the examination, some do not, some have higher exam fees than others.  Any tests they do will of course be extra, but at least they could give you an idea of whether it's warranted or not.  They'd probably want to do at least a fecal float on her, which can range anywhere between $0 - 50 just dependent on pricing structure of that particular practice (some people use it as a loss leader, others use it to recuperate costs lost in other areas).   The pricing of veterinary medicine is a whole topic of its own accord."

If that is a concern, your vet should be contacting Zoetis to see if there have been any issues with that lot number of Apoquel."

What exactly has your vet told you?"
AskVet,3e29k8,belatedlove,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:58:56 2015 UTC,"She was critical from kidney disease last night. It's been coming, but she just developed the mouth sores. So she hadn't really eaten in 1.5 days.  I don't want her to expire in a cold busy back 'procedure'  room, locked away from me, just because she's got an IV drip. She'll hate that, and she'll die just from hating that. I would like her to pass peacefully, without suffering, but not by a death needle just because it's more convenient. She's not in marked pain, she's just slowing down. Like people are allowed to do, surrounded by their family, in hospital or home with hospice help. .  Why can't she?"
AskVet,3e29k8,goatsickle,3,Tue Jul 21 15:32:49 2015 UTC,"Since she's currently at a hospital, your best bet is to ask the vet there for advice on in-home hospice care.  The odds that you'll get an LA vet who happens to look at this post in time to help are pretty low."
AskVet,3e29k8,always_onward,3,Tue Jul 21 15:40:00 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry that your dog is sick. If your veterinarian has told you that her case is terminal, please know that veterinarians never recommend euthanasia for convenience - we discuss it with you because it is the kindest decision for the pets we love when they are suffering. Death is painful and frightening, and euthanizing an animal who will not recover from their illness gives them a peaceful passing and ensures that you can be there with them to comfort and hold them during their final moments. People who opt for hospice care at home have the option for a continuous morphine drip to relieve their suffering, but due to laws in place about controlled substances, that isn't possible for animals. There sadly isn't a way for your girl to pass naturally and peacefully without suffering. There are many veterinarians across the country who offer in-home euthanasia, so that your girl can stay at home in her favorite spot and not need to suffer the stress of being at the veterinary hospital. I would suggest googling ""at home euthanasia L.A."" and considering whether that would be the best option for you and her."
AskVet,3e29k8,Neryian,3,Tue Jul 21 20:17:33 2015 UTC,"Dying from kidney disease is horrible painful and frankly borderline torture.  The kidney's job is to filter toxins from the body.  Toxins produced just by being alive and breathing in addition to toxins caused by food metabolism.  When that isn't happening anymore because of kidney failure, those toxins build up.  When mouth sores, called uremic ulcers, develop, the toxin level in the body is to the point the patient is septic.  Your dog is literally rotting from the inside out, alive.  Eventually she will start having heart rhythm issues and possible seizures from these toxin levels.  She won't know that you want her to die peacefully only that she is dying painfully.    While we cannot ask our dogs and cats how they feel during this process, we can get some clues from human patients in various stages of kidney disease.  Most report extreme nausea, agonizing acid reflux, abdominal pain, pain urinating, generalized weakness, headaches, extreme mouth pain, muscle cramping and spasms and at the end chest pain from heart rhythm abnormalities.  Why do we let people die like this in extreme pain? Cause we can.  The morality of the situation has to be discussed within families.  As suggested below, there are many veterinarians who offer humane euthanasia, that peaceful death you want for your dog, at home in her space.  Having watched many animals die from this disease, forcing them to die in pain from organ shut down is horrible and is not the end we want for our pets."

But it seems as though this person has already gone to a vet, and is simply looking for a company or practice that does in-home IV treatments around LA. You don't need credentials to inform someone of a place that does that."
AskVet,3e29k8,goatsickle,3,Tue Jul 21 15:59:55 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but it really doesn't matter.  To run a subreddit like this, you have to ask people for uniform primary posts.  If you let everyone decide whether or not the medical history is necessary, you waste all kinds of time explaining why we need the history to make appropriate recommendations on a case by case basis.  But, looking at this case specifically - the primary post really isn't specific enough.  Are they looking for a mobile setup that can give IV fluids for an hour or two and then leave?  Because if that's the case, it would not be a good idea for many medical cases, including kidney failure.  Are they looking for someone to set up an IV fluid rig in their house?  Because that's not a good idea either, someone qualified needs to be there to monitor the equipment.  Are they looking for someone to live in their house with them to monitor the equipment?  I could go on, but you probably get the point.  What this person wants is unclear, and without the full information we're not willing to make ANY recommendation because it might turn out what we recommended was inappropriate based on this patient's needs.  We're not google."

Some just ask for general information, and general information doesn't need to be terribly specific. I'm all for people filling in all that info if it is absolutely essential in order to help someone. The medical history part and all those other factors and scenarios are something for the people providing the actual care to worry about. If a person without a degree can recommend a vet in the area to a friend without knowing any illness their friend's pet has ever had, the same could be applied here. You tell them about a place for them to try calling, they do, then the place will tell them if they think they can help. If they can't, then the person tries somewhere else. Simple as that. You aren't recommending a course of medical action, just a place that may or may not be able to help someone. No one is expecting you to be Google here."

This isn't someone asking for a vet where they can get a rabies vaccine.  It's someone with a vague question about complicated in-home care.  And yes, even when we're not the primary vets, we're ethically obligated to make sure our recommendations are appropriate.  Again, this was not someone looking for simple basic care.  There was not enough information given to make an appropriate recommendation for what kind of company/service they could contact.  Home IV fluids is not a common thing.

AskVet,3e2h6x,TheKijana,2,Tue Jul 21 13:20:26 2015 UTC,"It should be you/your family making the decision, since you're the ones seeing her day to day. Is she still urinary/fecal continent? Might it be possible to look into a sort of wheelchair/cart for her?  The best way to help make the decision is to make a list of what activities or behaviors you consider important to her quality of life, and then monitor every day whether she's able to do those activities/behaviors, etc. Maybe it's sunbathing, maybe it's following a family member around, maybe it's a favorite toy, etc. It just needs to be something you can monitor. At the end of the day, decide whether that day was a good day or a bad day. Once you start to see more and more bad days, and fewer good days, it's a good indicator that her quality of life has deteriorated. And I know it's a sad decision to make, but you'd be giving her the kindest gift at that point- you're ending her suffering. I'm sorry for you and your family, but hopefully she still has plenty of good days ahead of her."

AskVet,3dzh8m,oruz,4,Mon Jul 20 20:03:36 2015 UTC,Take him to the vet. It's likely he has pain that is triggered by touching in a certain area. He may also have been wrongly raised to play with hands because many owners do that unknowingly. Use toys to attract his attention when he starts to bite and reward with treat when he plays with the toy.
AskVet,3dzh8m,snowbirdie,5,Mon Jul 20 22:41:38 2015 UTC,"First of all, he needs to go to the vet to check for a medical issue that could be causing this behavior. If he turns out to be healthy, I would suggest asking your vet for a referral to a veterinary behaviorist."
AskVet,3dzh8m,Urgullibl,4,Mon Jul 20 23:00:09 2015 UTC,"You mentioned you rescued him. Was he really young when you rescued him?  To me it sounds like a bottle baby, just by what little you've said.  If they are taken away from mom to early or if they lost their mom at a young age they can tend to be biters. It is the socialization with mom as he is being weaned that teaches most of these basic cat manners."
AskVet,3dzh8m,RedQueenHypothesis,4,Mon Jul 20 23:07:30 2015 UTC,"things to do: see a vet to rule out pain or illness causing the biting. Watch him closely when he's being pet. Stop the sessions shorter, and try not petting behind the head & neck, because petting lower can be overstimulating. Consult a behaviorist. Look up resources on cat body language.  Things not to do: Punish him, bop him on the nose, yell at him, spray him, hold his mouth with your hand. None of these are actually beneficial and they can worsen your situation.  Short of animals who have a neurologic issue, 99.99999% of biters give warning. They may not give much warning, but it's there. A tail swish or the ears flattening out to the side are the most typical. When those happen, just stop touching all together and leave the situation. No final little pet to say goodbye, no pushing the limits, just take your hands away and give him some time alone.  If his vet exam comes back normal and there isn't a pain trigger, work on interactive play and foraging games. Use a treat ball for his kibble instead of giving him dishes full of food.  Consult a veterinary behaviorist. This is different than a trainer because they're a veterinarian that has specialized training in addressing behavior issues and has been tested to show that they have a thorough understanding. In Austin, you'll want to consult Dr Ken Martin. His website is www.veterinarybehavior.com ."
AskVet,3e0o0s,apileofpenguins,20,Tue Jul 21 01:28:51 2015 UTC,"If we were to believe breeders, every single breed would need special anesthesia. This is mostly hogwash fed by special snowflake syndrome.  Don't worry about it."
AskVet,3e0o0s,Urgullibl,3,Tue Jul 21 01:57:49 2015 UTC,"There is a concept of ""breed-specific anesthesia,"" but not likely in the way that you're questioning, OP. These thoughts are concerned with irregularities consistent amidst different breeds: brachycephalic syndrome for your flat-faced pugs and bostons,  possible genetic predisposition for drug sensitivities within the collie breeds, the slower metabolism of sighthounds and aversion of barbiturates, etc.   Every anesthetic episode is tailored to the patient based on a number factors, breed included but often farther down the list of concerns. There's nothing ""special"" in the thought that there may be only one type of drug that may be considered for danes alone or that we should use any more precaution than we would with many of our other patients. (Which should always be a priority, not to downplay it.) Each veterinarian should be aware of their patient's current state of health and anesthetic risk, calculating their anesthetic protocol appropriately.  The others are right: anesthetic needs of a Dane are nothing for you to fret about. (His/her overall health, nutritional needs, prophylactic procedures, etc, however, an entirely different topic.)  Edit: I should clarify... I say ""each veterinarian SHOULD be aware"" not as a dig to the vast majority of veterinarians, but to acknowledge the 1% that still exist with the old-school training of ""line 'em up, knock 'em down"" with zero preanesthetic workup. coughPolcough"
AskVet,3e0o0s,JessaFace,0,Tue Jul 21 08:10:20 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that aside from needing more of the anesthetic (due to size) that they also reacted poorly more often than other breeds and therefore needed more monitoring (a family member said they put an extra tech in when her Dane has surgery - although it could be a grab for that clinic). Good to know that that's not necessarily a standard.   Common health problems are one reason we'd prefer a mix in general (and something a little smaller could be a good thing at this point in our lives for financial, logistical, and other reasons, too). I've done a fair bit of research but this issue was rather unclear. I do plan on talking to some vets, but I was waiting until we had a specific dog or two we were looking at :)"
AskVet,3e0o0s,JessaFace,2,Tue Jul 21 13:52:24 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. :) While a larger volume of drug is a given, often times the dosage (milligrams per kilogram of body weight) is actually lower for danes than their smaller counterparts. They can sometimes react pretty profoundly to sedation, but we anticipate this and which is why we should always give medications ""to effect"" when possible. I can't say that I've had any difficulties monitoring anesthesia for a Great Dane over any other breed, beyond the concerns of whatever health condition they've presented for. (Which, working emergency, is often pretty serious to begin with, so my perceptions may be a bit skewed.)  As much as I adore a Great Dane, it's probably in your best interest to find a mix - in general, they're healthier. Longevity and good health is not common for their majestic breed, even if a great disposition is. :("
AskVet,3e0o0s,gigglingmonk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:54:33 2015 UTC,"Cool things to learn, thank you! And we're definitely thinking mix - lifespan, health problems, etc. would be too much for us with almost any 'purebred' breed, let alone a Dane."

I've monitored for Great Danes and as far as I know, they don't need special anesthesia. At least, we don't do anything special. Just requires more meds.   If you're feeling nervous about it, you could always discuss it with a couple different vets, call around and ask to speak to a tech or a doctor and see what they say about how comfortable they are doing surgery on a Great Dane."

AskVet,3dzdr1,gassyboi,7,Mon Jul 20 19:38:06 2015 UTC,I would suggest looking for a wildlife rehab/rescue center near you and calling them. They'll be able to tell you exactly what to do with them. I used to work at one and we would take in just about everything. Until you can get them to a rescue make sure to keep them nice and warm.
AskVet,3dzdr1,veterinary_girl2017,6,Mon Jul 20 20:21:04 2015 UTC,"Not a vet, but someone who has been involved with rodent rescue for about a decade.  I think those are rats (smaller ears and shorter tail in proportion to body than mice).  They don't quite look like R. norvegicus (brown/Norway/lab/pet rats), so my best guess is R. rattus (black/roof rats), but at that age, it isn't possible to be 100% sure visually.  Anyone who breeds or rescues domesticated rats will not want these guys around, because they are a risk for disease transmission to other rats.  Most wildlife rehabbers won't take ""pest"" species, but it won't hurt you to call around and ask.  Depending on your location, it is likely illegal to release them and may also be illegal to keep them.  The vast majority of attempts at hand-rearing rodents fail, even with healthy domesticated pups.  Not trying to be a Negative Nancy, just giving you some facts.  What you can do: -Call wildlife rehabbers: it's a long shot, but maybe you'll luck out.  The rest of these steps are in case that fails. -Keep them warm: when I've had baby rats who need a helping hand, they go between my undershirt and hoodie.  If you're not comfortable with that, look up how to make a rice sock, or use a heating pad very carefully. -Get them hydrated: if you don't have proper food yet, at least get them drinking water. An oral syringe should work on rats that age, but use a Q-tip or clean paintbrush if they won't take the syringe. -Feed them: at that age, they'll eat every 4-6 hours (younger rats need more).  Kitten milk replacer (from a pet store) or non-dairy baby formula are good options.  Soy milk works in a pinch, but isn't really rich enough; rats generally have trouble digesting cow milk, so skip that. -Make sure they pee and poo: they should be old enough to have this under control, but if you notice they're not leaving droppings/dribbles, you can stimulate their genital/anal area with a cotton ball soaked in warm water.  In the wild, the mom rat would lick them to let them know it's potty time.    The good news is that they're already fully furred.  They look like they're just a couple days from having open eyes, and about a week from being able to survive on their own.  Once their eyes open, they'll start exploring (make sure they're well contained - they will climb and chew!), and will start sampling solid food.  Make sure they have a variety of options (grains, veggies, fruits, egg, lean meat - people food is OK as long as salt and sugar are low), and you can slowly cut back the milk rations.  Once they're feeding themselves completely, you can release them.  Even hand-raised from birth, wild rats don't make good pets (rats have actually been domesticated about as many generations as dogs, so think of these as wolf pups which will never grow into Labradors)."
AskVet,3dzdr1,doctorasinsemilla,2,Mon Jul 20 21:20:06 2015 UTC,"If someone could indeed verify that they are rats -- you could call a local rattery (hobby rat breeder) and get information on how to feed them, but then you'd be stuck with them and they could not be released into the wild or introduced to other rats due to risk of diseases. I'm not even sure if it's legal to keep wild rats. Does anyone know?  Rehabilitation center would be the best bet."

AskVet,3dz0kl,Schoffleine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:10:40 2015 UTC,"Well the way we'd diagnose it here would be:    Ringworm (Dermatophytosis) Scan with a fluorescent light to look for an easy diagnosis and guide hair plucking/brushing.   Not all Dermatophyte species fluoresce under blacklight so the lack of fluorescence does not rule out ringworm. DTM (dermatophyte testing medium) culture based on hair plucks around the edge of lesions or based on toothbrush samples from the same hairs.    Bacterial lesions Lance pustules or do impression smears of the skin to see what kind of bacteria (or yeast) are present (round or rod shaped) and generally use that to guide treatment options. Can gram stain it if you want to know for sure, but generally cocci are gram positive and rods gram negative    Then there's always the chance of mites and allergies  That's how I'd work it up in the USA.

The Thundershirt sometimes works, but it sounds like he's associated the shirt with the actual event itself, unfortunately. While behavioral training is important (don't ""encourage"" the anxiety by being overly dramatic/comforting, if that makes sense), you can discuss anti-anxiety meds for your boy. While some require constant dosing, there are others that can be used as needed (check the forcast/use around holidays), and may work for him.  Sunbathing: I'm assuming he has normal Beagle coloring and everything, so the white areas of his belly can be particularly prone to sunburn. Try to limit sunbathing on high UV days, during midday, etc. If you ever observe skin irritation or changes, he definitely needs to have exposure limited. While I am aware of there being sunscreen for dogs out there, I have no experience/knowledge of them, so it'd be a question to ask your vet."

He is a mixed breed (predominantly beagle but does have Boston terrier mixed in) so he is brindle colored. He definitely has white all over his belly and arms though, a la your standard beagle. I will definitely watch for sunburn, didn't even think of that. If he gets a little burned, think aloe is ok topically?

Which is good, because it came back twice. Depending on how severe the case and the shape of her eye, it may take more extensive surgery to take care of it for good. After those initial surgeries, my girl has been good for more than a year, so we should be in the clear now.   From my research, it looks like there's mixed vet opinions on whether leaving it is actually detrimental to their health, other than just cosmetically. It may affect tear production and lead to dry eyes, irritation, and infections. In any case, I'd take her to your vet and see what they recommend."
AskVet,3dwm65,holganaut,9,Mon Jul 20 03:33:49 2015 UTC,He needs to be seen by a vet very soon.  Borrow money from a friend or look into Care Credit.  It's not fair to him to suffer silently with no medical attention.
AskVet,3dwm65,skipsteejsprat,8,Mon Jul 20 04:30:18 2015 UTC,"Weight loss and lethargy in a young cat can be a lot of different things. Definitely needs a vet visit, this is not something you can wait out or fix at home. I would recommend blood work and a feline leukemia and FIV test, to start. Feline infectious peritonitis is another possibility, as well as a foreign body obstruction in the gut. Like I said, it could be a lot of different things, and at the very least, he needs a physical exam, now."

While the chicken may be OK as a source of nutrition for the short run, he definitely needs to get onto a well balanced/properly formulated (and hopefully not raw) diet long term. This may require just trying multiple foods until he likes one, or his current food aversion may be related to him feeling crummy."

Next time she coughs I will dive for my phone. I will also definitely get her some cat lax this afternoon and start her on that. It certainly can't hurt!   The other thing is.. My SO reminded me that on her first visit to the vet (at 5 months, straight out of the shelter), she told me that she could hear a faint heart murmur. She said it wasn't a big deal, but gave me some symptoms to keep an eye out for, and one of those was coughing. Between that visit and her follow up two weeks later, my kitten did cough a bit, so when we went back to the vet, I let her know. She said this time she didn't hear any murmur, and not to worry about it. I can't believe I forgot this information. I'm now thinking I should go ahead and make her annual appointment a couple months early just in case. Better safe than sorry. Again, though, I'm sure it will be very helpful if I can bring in a video of the coughing. Thanks again!"

The vet wasn't able to tell me much of anything about the x-rays and said she'd have to talk to their clinic's mobile surgeon and get back to me.  I later got a call from the same vet who said she she talked to their clinic's mobile surgeon about what she saw (I pressed her on this and she didn't actually show the surgeon the x-rays but just described them verbally) Anyway, she said it is called a physeal fracture and it's on his femur. She claimed it is a complete fracture and not just a hairline fracture. She said there wasn't any displacement but that ""more than likely"" there's motion within the fracture.   She also said that their mobile surgeon said with these types of fractures ""most of the time"" they won't heal on their own and if not they could become a non-healing fracture which means possibly having pain when he uses it. She said they recommend surgery (even though the surgeon didn't see the x-rays) and that the total cost which she said would be just about $2,000."

AskVet,3dx3ty,dinosaur_vet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:53:21 2015 UTC,"She performed a digital exam and digitally checked the feces. Then she sent me to get an ultrasound to see if there was a narrowing in the intestines. I guess it wasn't visible on the x-ray. After the ultrasound she said there was no obstruction and left it at that. This was never fully addressed and hence, that's why I posted my question. It is clear that that there is gas in the intestines but does anyone know what that ball in a he middle behind that vertebra is? Is that normal? I would be eternally grateful if someone could help me."
AskVet,3dx3ty,Schoffleine,2,Mon Jul 20 09:18:45 2015 UTC,You'll have to circle the 'ball behind the vertebrae'.  No idea what you're referring to.   Also how does one digitally examine a patient?

AskVet,3dw5vm,Neryian,4,Mon Jul 20 01:17:49 2015 UTC,"Try blocking access to the area. I've seen cases of specific urine marking in areas near windows/doors and it turned out that neighbourhood animals would walk by the house, causing the cats to mark.

AskVet,3dw5vm,angelcake,3,Mon Jul 20 01:36:48 2015 UTC,"UTI's and cystitis cannot be ruled out without running tests.  When you go to the recheck its time for full labs (7 is a great time to get a baseline on blood values and its usually most cost effective to send in urine with a large panel than to piecemeal it out).  Based on her recheck and those labs is when you can make a new plan.   IF and only if everything comes back normal, I would add a second litterbox with a similar litter to the original and ask your vet about stress medications.  These can range from the neutraceutical lines (Composure, Anxitane, etc) to full blown anti-depressants (Prozac, Clopraminine, etc).  Lets first 100% rule out infections, inflammation and stones first."

The in-house FeLV test tests for the viral antigens, so the mother's milk will have no effect on the test whatsoever.

AskVet,3dttd4,PepsiPerfect,4,Sun Jul 19 11:55:08 2015 UTC,"I agree. Got to see a veterinarian  first. There are a TON of medical issues in which vomiting can be a symptom in cats. Pancreatitis, IBD, cancer, etc. And don't  change your cats diet until you see a vet. There are some scientifically composed prescription foods by Hills and Royal Canin that can help with cats with stomach issues. I have seen them do wonders for patients at my clinic.  That being said, if it is a 'scarf and barf"" issue  where the cat is just eating so fast that it's stomach cannot handle the contents, try meal feeding, and try feeding small meals. The veterinarians at my practice also commonly recommend  OTC pepcid (famotidine). See your veterinarian  for a dose."
AskVet,3dttd4,crcarpen,4,Sun Jul 19 13:11:08 2015 UTC,"If there aren't underlying health issues and the cat's just a fast eater, slow feeders are awesome at helping this problem. My cat used to throw up every other day from eating way too quickly. We got a ball with adjustable slots for kibble to drop out of and now he's slowed down his habits to the point we don't have to put it in the feeder ball anymore."
AskVet,3dttd4,DarkDefenderDaxter,2,Sun Jul 19 17:17:54 2015 UTC,"I had this problem with Minerva. Did all the tests, hundreds of dollars, she was perfectly healthy. The vets couldn't figure it out.

I replaced her bowl with a muffin tin, and served the food so that there was only one layer of kibble covering the bottom of each cup. Problem solved! She was just eating too fast!"
AskVet,3dttd4,PinkSlip_YoureFired,2,Mon Jul 20 00:29:09 2015 UTC,"I temporarily solved my cats vomiting 6 months ago. Took her to the vet over the issue and he did blood work and recommended a teeth cleaning. Turns out she had tooth resorption and had a tooth removed which turned out to be causing her a lot of pain. Stopped throwing up until recently where I suspect she might be having more teeth problems.  All in all, dental cleanings are important for our pets."
AskVet,3dttd4,redcheckers,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:04:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed that a visit to the vet is in order- I'm surprised it hasn't come up at her yearly visits if she's been as chronic about it as it sounds. It could be she's eating too quickly, it could be she has IBD, food allergies, etc. In the mean time, make sure you are actually measuring out the food (and try to feed according to her weight on the bag guidelines). Make sure to ask the vet if she's overweight- here is a good chart for assessing her body condition score. You can try using a bigger bowl and spreading out the individual kibbles, or they have feeding bowls specifically for animals that eat too fast.   The vet may recommend a food change, but please, don't go raw. There's a wealth of information on the sidebar, but the TL;DR of it is that raw has no (none, zilch, nada) documented or proven benefits (and anecdotes are not evidence, they're CSB's), and plenty of proven risks (increased prevalence of pathogen contamination and infections, nutritional deficiencies, etc). While there are, unfortunately, a few veterinarians that like to practice non-evidence based medicine, the consensus statements by various veterinary organizations (including nutritionists) do not recommend raw feeding."
AskVet,3dttd4,DrDead88,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:22:17 2015 UTC,Great feeding advice in this thread. Definitely address that first. But in the interim (it may be a few months of trial and error with your vet/feeding methods before something sticks) I would recommend getting a bed frame with wooden sides down to the floor. That'll at least prevent kitty from crawling underneath and making a mess. Same thing with under dressers and furniture...you can just screw in some plywood to cover the gaps if necessary.
AskVet,3dttd4,cucumbers,2,Mon Jul 20 03:20:10 2015 UTC,That's exactly what we did yesterday. We have the bed frames at our new place but haven't moved in yet. I think this will really help.

If your cat has no medical problems, examine the ingredients in the food you are feeding her.  If the food has soy, rice, oats, potatoes, corn gluten, I would suggest getting a food without those used.  Also some cats have allergies to fish, so if you are using an all fish food, you may want to try one that uses red or white meat proteins."

Our cat does this and the only way until recently to prevent it was to spread it out flat   so there is only a single layer of (personally not touching) cat food. Recently took her to the vet for it and there was a variety of solutions from nausia meds(hates and refuses to eat them) to wet food( which she has not puked up yet but getting her to eat it is annoying) and an xray to see if there is something in her stomach. Talk to your vet and try to keep on top of and see just how much she is vomiting, it may help see just how bad the problem is."

My concern is, with a cat that young, he doesn't have developed energy stores than an older cat would have, and can deteriorate rapidly. If you observe any lethargy, inappetence, or other signs, he definitely needs to go back to the vet, ASAP (as in ER), but honestly should be seen regardless.    As far as food goes, there are prescription diets available that can help with sensitive/upset stomachs. Trying a whole bunch of other diets runs the risk of exacerbating an upset stomach, and if he really can't keep any food down, he needs to go back."

AskVet,3dvbra,spidercounteraww,2,Sun Jul 19 20:49:44 2015 UTC,Yes the vet was an exotic animals vet.   We keep the tank from 105-107 under the bulb and about 83 on the cool site with a  75(?) watt bulb and a uvb bulb as well. We use a normal carpet style substrate and he's been in no contact with other animals. He has eaten crickets in the past and hasn't been receptive to vegetables. He's been eating and drinking medicated food and water/pedialyte out of syringes
AskVet,3dvbra,Neryian,5,Sun Jul 19 21:03:02 2015 UTC,"Ditch the carpet, that stuff is terrible.  Replace with paper towel for now.  Did your vet do a fecal and what did it show?  Did the vet start antibiotics or give fluids? Is he in a tank by himself or with other dragons?  Are you turning off heat at night or is there a red heat lamp on 24 hours a day?  What is the distance from the bottom of the UV bulb to the top of the dragon if he is on the basking platform (exact distance measured not a guess)  Enough with the dog food and pedialyte.  Reptiles are neither dogs nor people.  Get some Carnivore Care (either Oxbow or Lafebvre brands) from your vet and syringe with that.  Yes competition can get a hatchling behind the 8-ball so to speak but 3 weeks out, aggressive care is needed.  Call the vet monday and go back.  At this point that guy needs fluids, possibly xrays to rule out impaction from whatever crap substrate the pet store had him on (very few don't have crap substrate), antibiotics to treat any opportunistic bacterial infection and tube feeding (difficult for owners to do without lots of hands on guidance and supervision).  Get him away from the other dragons if he is housed with them into a smaller tank that is kept at 80 degrees 24 hours a day.  Don't use undertank heating as the last thing this baby needs is burns.  Red lamps work great just monitor the temp both when your house is at its hottest and when its at its coolest.    In general, Beardies are far more carnivorous before adulthood then become more omnivores.  Bugs to pinkies should be the staple until adult size is reached with greens offered daily.  Just don't be worried if young dragons ignore greens.  They are growing fast and want protein."
AskVet,3dvbra,Neryian,2,Mon Jul 20 00:19:58 2015 UTC,"The vet gave some sort of medication for parasites. My girlfriend took him so I'm not exactly sure what else they did.

AskVet,3dtoa3,chulaire,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:35:17 2015 UTC,"Information was relayed by my sister-in-law.  He bet's on chronic pancreatitis (we're still waiting for lab results on that). Treatment so far recommended includes switchting to Royal Canin Hepatic, Rascave hepar mite and some chewing tablets that are supposed to support digestion during and after diarrhea (unfortunately the packaging doesn't have any name or active ingredient listed on it).  What I don't totally get: Doesn't the liver diet have reduced protein and is this a reasonable choice if he already has a protein deficiency?  Wouldn't pancreatitis also show elevated amylase?  Wouldn't any involvement of the liver show up in AST/ALT? How about cholestasis?"
AskVet,3dtoa3,chulaire,3,Sun Jul 19 11:10:44 2015 UTC,"Doesn't the liver diet have reduced protein and is this a reasonable choice if he already has a protein deficiency?   The liver diet still contains the daily requirement for protein.    Wouldn't pancreatitis also show elevated amylase?   Not always. Amylase and lipase readings aren't always consistent with pancreatitis.   There's an in-house snap test (cPLi) for pancreatitis that is pretty accurate and cheap to run.    Wouldn't any involvement of the liver show up in AST/ALT? How about cholestasis?   Usually, yes. Liver damage normally will shows up with increased AST/ALT, but in the chronic stage, it might not be so. Cholestasis usually results in increased bilirubin levels.     One thing that stands out to me is the elevated CK and LDH, which is indicative of muscle damage. Though it could be because he's been throwing up and the lowered protein levels could also be secondary to diarrhoea.   Best to wait for the lab result on pancreatitis, or even go back and request the snap test which takes about 10 minutes to get results.   When was the last time he was dewormed?"
AskVet,3dtoa3,orzo_crystals,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:14:24 2015 UTC,"One thing that stands out to me is the elevated CK and LDH, which is indicative of muscle damage.   Forget to mention this as you stop noticing it and also because all vets so far were along the line of 'these things happen': for years now he's had a permanent tremor of the lower extremeties. It usually stops when he lays down but most of the time when standing or sitting his legs shiver at 4-8 Hz. The vet said the elevated CK might be connected.   When was the last time he was dewormed?   4 weeks ago. Don't know with what exactly. And a few months before that with IIRC ivermectin (might have been some other avermectin) because of repeated licking of the sacral/anal region.  Anyway: already big thanks for your effort."
AskVet,3dtoa3,procyon_DVM,3,Sun Jul 19 14:04:13 2015 UTC,"First, the dietary protein doesn't relate directly to serum protein levels, so try not to think of it that way. It looks to me like there is a panhypoproteinemia (both albumin and globulins are low). This pattern would fit with GI loss of proteins and is consistent with your dogs clinical signs.  Chronic pancreatitis doesn't look exactly like acute pancreatitis. It is often more of a fibrotic process (replacement of the normal tissue with scar tissue). If there isn't enough normal tissue left to make lots of amylase and lipase, you may not see an elevation.  AST and ALT are leakage enzymes so usually with any liver damage they will be elevated, but damage is not the same as dysfunction. Think of damage as something that recently popped the liver cells (trauma, toxins, anemia), whereas dysfunction means that either there aren't enough normal hepatocytes or something is blocking them from doing their jobs.  There is a slight elevation in ALP which is likely due to cholestasis. Usually I like to see cholesterol elevated during cholestasis, but in this case it is low. That's probably because of the GI disease."
AskVet,3dtl5g,SaucyKitty,2,Sun Jul 19 09:23:50 2015 UTC,"Thundershirts sometimes help, but not always, and can be worth a shot. Talk with your vet about the anxiety, and they can decide whether there are any medications that would be appropriate in his case.   Otherwise, be sure to be supportive, but don't over do it/encourage it- you don't want to confirm his thoughts that the thunderstorm is the end of the world."
AskVet,3dtl5g,DrDead88,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:50:15 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Thundershirts come with a 30-day money-back guarantee.  So if you see a thunderstorm in the forecast, buy one and try it out.  Also try to reduce the stimulus by closing all the blinds and turning the TV on pretty loud to cover the thundering.   Sometimes giving them a distraction like a Kong with something really tasty inside can do wonders."
AskVet,3dsywf,Nyabi,3,Sun Jul 19 03:58:36 2015 UTC,"Is it possible for a female to have stud tail?  If so is this something that stays with the animal always?    Yes, it can happen in neutered females. If it is stud tail, then yes, it may stay that way permanently.   However, you do need a vet to rule out any other causes and secondary infections; including mites, ringworm, and superficial dermatitis. Ideally you get a biopsy of the area to confirm increased amounts of glands in the area.     Stud tail or not what is the best way to deal with the cleaning? (I've been using regular Dawn dish soap)     Don't use dawn dish soap - it's way too harsh and may exacerbate the problem.   Shampoos containing salicylic acid or benzyl peroxide based products are best for this.     Should the tail be shaved?    No need really."

AskVet,3dtfdi,ThinkOutsideTheTV,4,Sun Jul 19 07:39:00 2015 UTC,"stopped giving him antibiotics because it seemed like he was getting back to normal   No no no no no no. Never stop a course of antibiotics early. Antibiotics take time to reduce bacterial populations, and stopping a course early is the best way to promote antibiotic resistance. The slight improvement may have been because of the antibiotics but because you cut them out early, you gave the possible infection a chance to fight back and overwhelm his system.   everything checked out at the vet and there were no health issues found   Do you have a copy of the blood test results you could show us?"

AskVet,3dtfdi,chulaire,2,Sun Jul 19 17:22:15 2015 UTC,"Don't start them again - you don't have a full course any more so unless you get prescribed more, it'll be just as ineffective and may further promote antibiotic resistance.   I highly recommend you go back and get a blood test. Right now we're shooting in the dark and a blood test and/or xrays would really help with figuring out the next step."
AskVet,3dswfc,scarletsalander,3,Sun Jul 19 03:31:02 2015 UTC,"A lot of things can cause urinary incontinence and leakage.  First step should be a vet visit to rule out a urinary tract infection. Other causes include neurological problems and cancer.   Wearing a diaper can predispose her to getting UTIs since get vulva will be rubbing on a dirty surface and the increased humidity and heat in the area will promote bacterial/fungal growth.   If all other causes are ruled out and it's simply an issue of reduced control from age, there are drugs your vet can prescribe that help sphincter control."
AskVet,3dswfc,chulaire,2,Sun Jul 19 04:43:01 2015 UTC,"She's been to the vet already and doesn't have a UTI, any neurological issues or any signs of cancer.  They actually do a urinalysis once a year and she had hers very recently.  Blood work was done several times this year too when she had some unrelated GI issues, so she's clean on all that.  I did worry about the diaper potentially promoting UTI conditions.  She wears it about six hours a day (with a fresh, new pad daily).  Unfortunately, she absolutely has to wear the diaper or she will 100% pee on the floor up to 6-12 times a year when her phobias kick in.  She can't be crated or she freaks out and hurts herself.  So yeah, it seems like it's an age thing. I guess we're back to my original question though: why aren't I seeing ANY signs of urinary incontinence when she's not diapered?  She's been lying on the couch next to me for three hours now and the blanket under her vulva is dry, as well as her vulva itself.  Her bedding is always immaculate, etc.  She also does not excessively lick herself or whatever.   I'm just trying to figure out why that is or if the leaking is so incredibly mild that it's not enough to warrant meds yet, if that makes sense?  Or if somehow she could ONLY be leaking when wearing the diapers.  I doubt that's likely though."
AskVet,3dswfc,chulaire,3,Sun Jul 19 05:00:03 2015 UTC,"Could also be vaginal discharge.

AskVet,3dr7nn,richmana,3,Sat Jul 18 17:58:21 2015 UTC,"There is some debate amongst nutritionists if reduced protein levels are protective in senior cats.  There is no clear answer even though we know that most senior cats have reduced kidney function even if renal values are normal on blood work.  Low protein levels also have draw backs in that at a certain point the body starts using protein stored in muscle tissues since there isn't enough coming in from the diet. This may be part of the reason we see an increase in chronic muscle wasting in our renal patients. The major food companies with their huge teams of boarded nutritionists are aware of this and only slightly reduce the protein levels between adult and senior brands.  The largest difference is between prescription renal diets and adult OTC foods. And honestly when we are treating renal disease while its ideal for cats to be on a prescription renal diet, its better they eat something than nothing.  About half my clinic's current renal patients are on the ""Whatever s/he will eat"" diet.  So since its not clear if reducing protein has any protective benefit and one school of thought is that no matter how far the protein levels are reduced cats aren't designed to live beyond a certain point, a lot of the major companies have stopped reducing the protein levels in their senior formulas, but instead are doing things they know help with aging animals.  Most of the senior or geriatric diets from Hills, Royal Canin and Purina are now not reduced protein but instead are reduced calorie (to account for the reduction in activity) and higher levels of omega fatty acids (to support joints and coats).    If your vet has said that your old kitty is a healthy senior with no underlying diseases (normal labs in the last 6 months), then it should be fine to feed all the cats an adult food.  Since there is a balance dry out all the time, you could rotate your cats between the adult and senior formulas for the wet if you want to get those extra omega acids in there."

AskVet,3dspol,DrDead88,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:47:13 2015 UTC,"Most vets will recommend either Hill's Science Diet, Royal Canin or Purina Pro Plan. Not because we get paid extra by the companies (as many skeptics will say...and to be honest we could make profit margins from selling any food) but because they actually do proper research on their foods.  Hills and RC have huge facilities where they house animals in top notch conditions for the sole purpose of researching the effects on their diets on the animals. Purina may have this too but I'm not a familiar with the food.  From experience, Hills diets will produce much more solid poops and their oral care diet is absolutely fantastic. Royal Canin diets tend to be much more palatable, so many owners will feed this over Hills because their pets simply love it more.   Again, someone else can shed light on Purina Pro Plan but when I went through university, they didn't have such facilities yet."

AskVet,3drwf5,thr33things,3,Sat Jul 18 21:33:07 2015 UTC,"Good rule of thumb, if applicable - always have one more litter box than number of cats. If you can add another litter box in your home, do so. UTIs can be asymptomatic for a long time, so regardless if she has no other signs of a uti it's still worth while to check it out.

AskVet,3drwf5,hellosh1tty,0,Sun Jul 19 00:18:25 2015 UTC,"Haven't noticed her drinking more. We only have the one cat, and pretty much no where else to put another box, but it's an idea I'll consider if this persists. Thanks."

This is impossible to determine unless you bring her to the vet for a physical exam and urinalysis.   I think it's a behavioral issue but I can't find any help on the internet.   This is likely the case; however, medical issues must always be ruled out first.  The first step in the process is a vet visit. Consider adding a feliway diffuser to the room."
AskVet,3drwf5,angelcake,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:40:49 2015 UTC,"My feeling that even though the cat doesn't have any issues with the dog during the day she may not be happy with him sleeping near her litter box at night.  Cats can be very funny about their litter boxes.  Can you keep the dog out of the bathroom while still allowing the cat in?  I know it's not really practical in a small apartment to have a second litter box but what about having one that you only put out at night? Another location, somewhere where she can have some doggy free privacy?  As someone else suggested there's no harm in trying a pheromone spray like Feliway.  If it doesn't work then you will definitely need to take her to the vet, if it's behavioural there is medication available, if it's not behavioural then they can figure out the problem and get her the right treatment.  There are certainly no guarantees here, I'm not a vet but I have dealt with inappropriate urination successfully and picked up a bit of useful knowledge along the way.  If it is behavioral and the pheromone spray doesn't help then the vet is going to have other options for you."

Is there somewhere you could set up a classic uncovered litter box? If she's a bit heavy she may have a hard time maneuvering in the self-cleaning box. She could be stressed because of the cat she doesn't get along with.  The rule of thumb is one box per cat plus an extra box.  I have two cats and one box but I'm retired, it's a big box and I clean it three or four times a day so there's never anything in there to put them off. My cats also hate each other and one thing I did find is that they need both an entrance and exit. Having a box wedged in the corner with only one way in and out can create stress."
AskVet,3dsfn0,angelcake,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:07:06 2015 UTC,"Right now it's not possible to have more than one box in the apartment which is why we've resorted to the litter-robot. We are moving to a much bigger place in a few months and we'll be able to have at least another box.  Until then we keep it very clean and it's a big help that it filters out the clumps after each visit.  (The whole box rotates and the clumps fall in a tray underneath)  That being said,the current box is fairly spacious and Bubs is still the smallest of  all the three cats despite the weight gain and she has no issue maneuvering when it's time for #2.   I hadn't considered the exit issue.  And I will look into that.  But again, I'm confused as to why she'd only have an issue with peeing. She backs up against the wall to pee. But stays in the middle to poop."
AskVet,3dsfn0,angelcake,2,Sun Jul 19 01:29:41 2015 UTC,"One of my cats always buries her poop and never buries her pee. She pees against the side of the box, fortunately it's quite high so it's pretty weird that there's any spillage.  It sounds like you're doing your best in a bad situation. Is the box covered?

Luckily I'm at home a lot these days but that can become quite a problem if we're not there.   This is the litterbox we use, and she didn't have any problem using it properly before. Honestly, this has probably been the best purchase of the year.  Emptying the regular box 3-4 times a day and trying to contain the smell was a constant problem."

AskVet,3dpbcu,someflychick,2,Sat Jul 18 03:47:11 2015 UTC,"Vet asap. Possible constipation issues are best treated early. They should also be able to feel if he's constipated just on the physical. Early on, they can be treated with just faecal softeners/laxatives. The longer you wait, the higher the chance he'll need another round of anaesthetia and an enema.   My cat is very prone to constipation due to pelvic problems, but does absolutely amazingly on the Royal Canin Fibre Responsive diet. It's seriously a miracle food...the poo comes out rubbery (which is quite hilarious) and he hasn't gotten constipated since. He's previously had 4 enemas until he got into this diet."

He seemed to be back to his normal self this morning and hasn't displayed any of those symptoms yet today, I'm hoping his system was able to work out whatever was messing with him.

My dog actually has a small lump, looks like she's bumped herself, but could be anything. It's not hard, but looks like she's bumped a vein.  Now that I'm thinking about it, she's probably also going to be pissed I didn't take her in ASAP.  But the spot/slight lump has just stayed the same."

AskVet,3doduc,LouDiMaggio,5,Fri Jul 17 22:39:09 2015 UTC,"It is generally recommended that insulin be administered soon after eating, assuming a twice daily insulin dose, unless otherwise directed. Giving it before can risk the dog snubbing their food, and becoming hypoglycemic as a result.   As far as food goes, there are prescription diets formulated for diabetic animals. Unfortunately, you were fed a bunch of misinformation regarding Blue Buffalo (and other boutique diets). You will need a prescription (or you can buy it at your vet clinic), but the companies like Purina, Hills, and Royal Canin have diets formulated according to science, not focus groups."
AskVet,3doduc,DrDead88,2,Fri Jul 17 23:37:59 2015 UTC,I feel like such a rube for getting Blue Buffalo now. I guess it really is all about marketing :/ Luckily I didn't get a large bag so once it's gone I'll look into the prescription food. Thanks for your help.

Otherwise, diarrhea, vomiting, and lethargy are unfortunately non-specific signs- it could have been a foreign object, an ulcer, cancer, an infectious cause, pancreatitis, a metabolic issue, etc. In the future, seeking prompt veterinary care may get you an answer, and hopefully, a treatment. I am sorry for your loss though."

There are a number of diseases wild birds can pass and any wild bird that is uninjured must be assumed contagious until proven otherwise.

AskVet,3dob1v,skipsteejsprat,5,Sat Jul 18 15:40:48 2015 UTC,"It looks like a fledgling, so it was probably under the supervision of it's mother.  If there are no cats or dogs in the vicinity, I would place it where you found it."
AskVet,3dmwqs,nonoguy,5,Fri Jul 17 15:53:40 2015 UTC,"This is going to sound like it's coming out of left field, since it sounds like you're concerned about a possible digestive issue or something related to his previous bout of pancreatitis, but based on your description of your dog having hindlimb weakness and seeming off balance in his back end, I would be concerned about a spinal problem. The spinal cord is how the brain talks to the limbs, and if something is interfering with that communication, we can see changes in how the animal walks, as well as pain, lethargy, etc.   Obviously, I can't see or examine your dog. So I may be totally off the mark, and working with your vet to try and figure out what's going on with your guy is the only way to get meaningful answers. It's just something I see commonly in practice and thought would be worth mentioning."
AskVet,3dmwqs,MirandaBinewski,3,Fri Jul 17 16:14:49 2015 UTC,"Also, in case it is a spinal issue, please rest him. No unrestricted activity; he should be confined in the house and only go out for short leash walks to use the bathroom."

AskVet,3dmwqs,MirandaBinewski,3,Fri Jul 17 16:21:09 2015 UTC,"It depends on the underlying cause. Unfortunately, lots of different conditions can affect the spinal cord, and can look identical. These may be as different as bulging intervertebral disks, autoimmune disease, infections, trauma, vascular events, or even cancer. Without additional diagnostics, there's no way to know for sure."
AskVet,3dmwqs,MirandaBinewski,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:27:30 2015 UTC,"Hi.  Today we went for xrays, I left the results at the vet treating him, but can't talk to her until tomorrow. Since the xray lab is in another place, I could talk to the guy in charge of the test and told me that he has 2 vertebrae merged, can't remember which ones, and reading the results says they are mineralizing. He said it could be really bad, and recommended a ct scan or something like that. I mean, it's a heavy blow for me. I've been thinking about something he said (could be degenerative) and it breaks my heart. Today, Tim, was very happy spite all, we went for a car ride and everything. I can see me taking care of him even if he loses all mobility in his legs. I just want to ask to you, since i can't speak to anyone else right now, is there any treatment, or what I'm thinking its what's gonna happen.  It seems that bad?  Thank you. Really."
AskVet,3dmc27,txce,3,Fri Jul 17 12:58:47 2015 UTC,"If you're finding flea dirt, there are fleas, even if you aren't seeing them. To verify that what you're finding is flea dirt, take some and rub it on a moistened paper towel. If they leave brownish red marks, it's flea dirt. If it doesn't leave any marks, it's probably just regular dirt from rolling around in the yard.  If your cat is still itchy, I'd consider a vet visit to evaluate advantage's efficacy for your situation. I don't remember exactly how advantage works, but in your flea allergy cat a topical with repellant properties would be ideal (I seem to remember advantage repels, though).  I wouldn't apply the topical early though without determining the cause of the itching and if what you're seeing is actually flea dirt first though."
AskVet,3dmc27,rvtjess,2,Fri Jul 17 13:18:26 2015 UTC,Advantage definitely repels and it has done its job well up until now. Will try the paper trick when they're home! Thank you for your advice!
AskVet,3dmc27,rvtjess,2,Fri Jul 17 13:41:24 2015 UTC,I thought it did. We don't carry that at my clinic so I'm not as familiar with it as I am with other products but I seemed to remember it repelled.  I hope it isn't flea dirt!

AskVet,3dnin9,jija505,3,Fri Jul 17 18:37:35 2015 UTC,We'd really need to see the x-rays.  Spondylosis rarely causes clinical symptoms.
AskVet,3dnin9,goatsickle,3,Fri Jul 17 19:02:57 2015 UTC,"Here is a pretty thorough resource.   As you've read, spondylosis can be present in all ages of animals, though it is typically associated with older patients. Usually the spondylosis isn't an issue in itself (unless the new bone growth impinges on a nerve/nerve root), it is typically a symptom of underlying instability, and the resulting degenerative joint disease/arthritis.   The most important thing to do is monitor his pain levels, assess his activity, etc. For most arthritic patients, constant, low impact activity is recommended, to maintain musculature and mobility. Should there be concerns about spinal/nerve injury, rest is recommended instead (so communicate with your vet). As far as analgesia goes, there are still options out there (though some not as clinically evaluated/proven as others), so reach out to your vet if his current regimen ever becomes inadequate."

Because they have multiple limbs affected, they're less able to deal with injury to one leg than another dog. Obviously can't say what's going on with your dog without an ortho/neuro exam, but if he had bad forelimbs already, and acutely injured his back leg in some way, the added strain to the forelimbs could make lameness there more apparent."
AskVet,3dknuj,isacrificedyourgoat,5,Fri Jul 17 01:16:09 2015 UTC,"Did the shelter spay her, or did she come to them and they assumed she was previously spayed?

Just to play it safe, I would treat her as if she was an intact bitch in heat. Keep her on a leash while outdoors at all times and do not allow her around intact males until you can get to the vet."

Aside from all that, I'm sure they already informed you - but just please keep an eye on her eating, drinking, and bathroom habits and that's she's acting her normal self beside maybe feeling a little drowsy from taking the Tramadol.   Hope this helps some!"

And even with a strict trial with the right food, it takes minimum 8 weeks to see results. So that's still a possibility. You didn't mention any actual diagnostic tests having been run, such as skin scrapes, cultures, cytology, etc. If there's been any testing done, those results would be helpful. Skin problems can be very frustrating, and it can require a lot of testing and therapeutic trials to pinpoint the root cause. There's no quick, easy fix with skin.  Edit to add: It is not at all uncommon to find zero fleas on a flea-allergic animal.

AskVet,3diuap,Jerf1,7,Thu Jul 16 16:55:19 2015 UTC,"Cheaper yes, as effective, not so much.  The biggest reasons Lantus is so popular to treat feline diabetics with is because its the only one that has shown to actually put some diabetics into remission (as in not needing insulin for years in some cases).  It also doesn't do the ""peaks and valley"" blood glucose that the more traditional insulins do, but creates a ""steady state"".  This is nice because it allows for fewer blood draws, thereby saving you money in lab fees and the stress of taking kitty to the vet once he is stabilized.  Some cats stabilize to the point of only needing it once a day instead of twice.  I know the initial cost is huge and I am sure the pharmacist told you that its only good for 30 days after opening.  This is true if you are a human diabetic with insurance covering the cost and like most human diabetics do things like leave it on the counter or the front seat of the car or in your purse.  Unrefrigerated all insulins must be discarded 30 days after first puncture.  No biggie if you are paying 20 bucks or less.  HUGE biggie if you are paying full cash price.  So thankfully a bunch of Internal Medicine specialists have been monitoring the effectiveness of Lantus in their patients beyond that 30 day mark with the insulin kept in the fridge at all times and are finding that the majority of the time, if you follow all the instructions for handling and storage your Vet gives you, Lantus is good for at least 4 months if not longer.  My local ACVIM vets say 4-6 months on average so we always monitor sugars via fructosamine at the 4 month mark.    If Lantus is completely out of the ball park for you, you could ask your vet about Vetsulin.  It is cheaper, but not as effective and is more like traditional insulin in monitoring protocols, effectiveness and the peak-n-valley curve production.  And don't forget to discuss food!  We have a number of feline diabetics that we have been able to regulate faster using Purina DM and Royal Canin Diabetic and a couple we have been able to take off insulin and manage via diet alone.    I know having a new diabetic is not cheap.  Getting a new diabetic stable and regulated can easily break the $1000 mark.  Keep in mind though that the faster you can hit regulation, and the more optimal the treatment is, the cheaper it is in the long run.  Good luck!  edit: I totally forgot PZI was back.  Ask about that one too!"
AskVet,3diuap,Neryian,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:36:56 2015 UTC,"Thx for the reply. I've got no problem getting him the Lantus at some point, whatever is best for him, it's just this expense with him came at a bad time when other bills and things are due, so I was thinking maybe getting a cheaper kind the first time around, and then when it's time to refill get the Lantus.  I'll talk to my vet about it"
AskVet,3diuap,Neryian,4,Thu Jul 16 18:26:24 2015 UTC,"While that may sound financially better, that plan will cost you more money.  Anytime you switch insulins you have to start completely over with the regulation process.  This means new baseline blood work and urine (just like you just did to get the initial diagnosis), new curves after the first week then the third and after any dosing change.  Basically you will end up paying twice to three times as much to start with one insulin then switch than you would to just keep with the same insulin long term even if he is difficult to regulate.  If Lantus is out of the ballpark, look into PZI instead."

That said, the Nobivac Tricat Trio has this warning: Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay Do not use during pregnancy or lactation, as the product has not been tested in pregnant or lactating queens. Live FPL virus can cause reproductive problems in pregnant queens and birth defects in the progeny. Also the FeLV one hasn't been tested in pregnancy. Contra-indications Since no data have been generated, it is recommended not to vaccinate females during pregnancy and lactation.

AskVet,3dgvix,DrDead88,2,Thu Jul 16 22:45:49 2015 UTC,"Does she live primarily outdoors or indoors? The main risks of shaving a breed like a Golden Retriever includes the hair coat (potentially) not growing back the same, increased skin exposure to UV rays, potential issues with temperature regulation, etc. The real risks (UV exposure, temperature control) are typically non-issues for dogs that live indoors. The other risks, which groomers caution against, are cosmetic.   For me, if you're sacrificing cosmetics in order to resolve/prevent medical issues (urine scald, hot spots, etc), then it's worth it. It's possible that this hot spot was a one off event, if you want to hold off. But I wouldn't worry too much about shaving (or just maintaining a good groom, if you don't want to shave), if it helps.

Sometimes moisture is a part of the issue to begin with, so it's best to keep that area dry. If the kitties resist, or the gunk doesn't come off with a light, gentle wipe, I'd say hold off until you're at the vet. That way, the vet/tech can do it and deal with any issues that might come up(bleeding, irritation, furious kitty syndrome), and you can avoid getting scratches from an angry kitty :) Also, this would be a great thing to talk about with the doctor!

AskVet,3dfk5d,Urgullibl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:48:54 2015 UTC,"In rehabilitation, metaphylaxis is used so rarely that the terms may as well be interchangeable.   So, in short, it is prevention vs mitigation?"
AskVet,3dfk5d,Urgullibl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:17:13 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's prevention in both aspects, just using different paradigms.   To expand on my example, if you're giving your dog Frontline or something similar, you're engaging in flea and tick prophylaxis in that this prevents them from ever attaching to your dog. In contrast, intestinal parasite metaphylaxis doesn't prevent the dog from ingesting eggs and those eggs from hatching."
AskVet,3dgmv7,sassafrass14,3,Thu Jul 16 02:58:36 2015 UTC,"I hate to be a bearer of bad news, but I witnessed that exact situation and it wasn't good.  My aunt slowly (maybe 5mph) hit her cat (accidentally of course) and he ran full speed down the driveway and out through the field behind the house.   We found him about half an hour later cowering in a drainage pipe, with an open hole in his abdomen. We got him to the emergency vet immediately. They got him right into surgery and he ended up living another 10 years to the ripe old age of 19.  He can still run really fast (I'm guessing as long as no bones are broken), because of the adrenaline coursing through him.  I hope you find him soon and are able to get him to the vet. Good luck!!"

AskVet,3dex2i,angelcake,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:09:38 2015 UTC,"Studio.  No way to close the bed off.  We have put a shower curtain over the bed while she is away and monitered that. There is no issue with the bed with shower curtain over the bed.  The only time there is ever an issue is when she is home. The cat seems to be trying to send her a message - but I have no idea what that might be or how to address it.   We are not currently disciplining the cat as we have not caught her in the act and we know that trying to scold an animal after the fact doesn't serve a purpose.  At wits end, a little."
AskVet,3dex2i,TheOneTruePavil,3,Wed Jul 15 19:13:06 2015 UTC,"Cats can pee outside the box because of changes they don't like, stress, or to try and alert their owners to something bothering them, health-wise.

AskVet,3dex2i,angelcake,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:25:09 2015 UTC,"Well I've definitely gone through this type of behaviour so I understand how frustrating it can be. Tricky when you have no doors.   I'm not going to claim for a moment to be a cat behaviorist, I'm not but I've been a cat owner for a long time. What about if when your fiancé gets home she makes her first ""thing to do"" spending a few minutes cuddling with the cat? Even buying a bag of treats that only come out when she gets home.  If you already are doing this I do apologize, I'm on mobile so I can't really go back and look at your original post without losing my draft.  There is a show called my cat from hell hosted by a guy named Jackson Galaxy. You can find his website online. He may have some solutions.   Obviously the shower curtain helps and that might be the thing to do for the time being.  You certainly don't want to do anything to increase the cats stress but you have to find a solution that works. There are pheromone diffusers available that may calm her down, it's also available in a spray, you could conceivably spray a piece of fabric and put it on top of the bed so that when she jumps up she gets a dose of calming pheromones.  Possibly putting something on the bed just before your fiancé is due to get home, something that makes noise so when the cat jumps up there to pee it startles her and she jumps off.   The other solution, a little bit more extreme but possibly viable would be to ask your vet to prescribe something like  clomicalm, basically Prozac for cats. A low-dose for short period might be useful.   I'm really just throwing things out there, there are a lot of very smart people in the sub Reddit so hopefully somebody can come up with something that works."

AskVet,3dehqx,DrDead88,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:23:55 2015 UTC,He seems to be feeling fine. He's still super hyper and playful. Him being hungry is why he originally changed it from half a can in the morning and night to a full can morning and night. It's wet fancy feast kitten food.

AskVet,3dehqx,DrDead88,2,Wed Jul 15 18:41:37 2015 UTC,"Sudden changes in diet can cause GI upset- they're used to the same food every day.

AskVet,3ddnaq,DougSR,4,Wed Jul 15 13:24:03 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what exactly you're asking...  The xray provided shows the fracture on the right hind leg and a dislocated left hip joint. You said they did an FHO but the xray isn't really straight enough for anyone to properly evaluate the hip joints. Did they repair the fracture in the right hind leg?   Which limb is he limping on now?
AskVet,3ddnaq,chulaire,2,Wed Jul 15 14:01:25 2015 UTC,The one that was surgically repaired. I'm asking his prognosis later in life? What will his life be like when he is 10 or 12? Is there medical historical data on this procedure basically.
AskVet,3ddnaq,chulaire,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:04:31 2015 UTC,"The one that was surgically repaired   That's what I meant in my post - according to the xray, both legs needed fixing. The right femur was fractured, and so surgical repair is definitely indicated for this leg, but the fix for that isn't an FHO. FHO (femoral head ostectomy) means to remove the femoral head so that that hip joint goes from being a ball and socket joint made of bone, to just the hip being a muscular sling.  The left leg being dislocated at the hip would need fixing, but that can be done without surgical intervention and you just pop the joint back in, like they do in humans.  Prognosis for FHOs performed to help alleviate pain from hip dysplasia (where the socket is usually too shallow and dislocation happens often) is usually pretty good, but there may be increased stress on his other hip joint that can be exacerbated by arthritis later in his life.

AskVet,3ddnaq,love_everybody_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:34:55 2015 UTC,"Current veterinary student here - I'm with /u/chulaire in that we'd need a better radiograph to evaluate the hips. Also, it's hard to say much from a dated x-ray. Usually radiographs are taken after the FHO as well - were those taken/can you provide them?  All things aside, dogs can do pretty well following an FHO, as the muscles will develop to help compensate. Obviously, he won't be 100% sound on it. I think the biggest piece of advice that I can give for you and Leon is to make sure he has a good diet and does not become overweight, as that would put him at a greater risk of complications."

Moving houses will stress out a cat a bit because they're territorial animals. Adding a new member to the family can also change your cat's behaviour.   At 12, he's probably due for a once-over (physical exam, blood test) at the vet if he hasn't had one in the past 2 years, since some age related medical issues can be more pronounced at this age."

AskVet,3ddzv9,chrkat1,2,Wed Jul 15 16:17:19 2015 UTC,No problem. Get her tested in about six months. The test only detects adult heartworms so they need to reach the adult stage for the test to be accurate. After your pet is on a preventative your vet should usually recommend that you still get them tested yearly for heartworm just in case the medication failed.

Hrm, the cat isn't treated for fleas yet this year - that's part of this weekend's appointment, and hasn't shown signs of itching. We did the fine tooth thing on a white sheet looking for flea dirt. All I could find was scabbing on the site itself. I'll take another look, though. We have a carpet-free house so at least there's that.

AskVet,3dfpz0,chulaire,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:09:30 2015 UTC,"If she's getting around a cone, then it's likely not big enough. If benadryl isn't really helping, I'd stop giving it to her.  The swimming may exacerbate any underlying skin problems she may have. A vet visit is your best bet, especially if you haven't found evidence of flea dirt on her.   There's no cream that will help much without finding the cause first. Creams for allergies may contain steroids, which will make infection worse. Creams that contain antibiotics won't necessarily work unless you have the appropriate type for the bacteria and randomly trying may promote antibiotic resistance."

At the very least, he's late on his Rabies vaccine, so now would be a good time to bring him in anyway.   While the gagging/dry heaving may be related to his food schedule, you should bring it up at his visit, to see what the vet thinks after a hands on exam. If he's not been seeing a vet or received any heartworm preventatives since he was 8 weeks old, it's very possible he has intestinal parasites that could contribute or cause the GI signs."

The orthopedic surgeon will know if it can be reduced (popped back in) based on a sedated exam. It might be possible but it might require surgery.  On the other hand, these generally shouldn't just pop out. Surgeons take a lot of measurements to make sure it is the exact fit. It is likely your friend is not following the post-operative instructions of strict exercise restriction.

Someone please correct me if I am wrong, but I have not heard or seen anything regarding their ""mental"" development being hindered by early spaying.

AskVet,3dbx6q,ChristopherOdd,7,Wed Jul 15 01:58:08 2015 UTC,"Only way to know what is causing it is removal and biopsy. Also, putting bulldogs under anesthesia obviously has an overall increased risk because of their conformation, but the internet blows that risk way way out of proportion. Rmemeber, angry upset people are the most vocal."
AskVet,3dbx6q,ironmouse,2,Wed Jul 15 02:04:03 2015 UTC,"Another vet here. I'll add that if it is a papilloma virus it can take months to completely resolve in any dog. Even at the low dose of cyclosporin used for allergy it can cause a small amount of immunosuppression (which is why it works for allergies), so viral infections may be a bit more likely to take root and take longer to heal. I agree with the biopsy route, though. Even if that's only papillomatosis I'd sure want to know. You might be able to get by with a sedative and local anesthetic depending on his tolerance level."
AskVet,3dbx6q,marmot_riot,3,Wed Jul 15 04:20:01 2015 UTC,"I'm confused, but admittedly work in people medicine and not veterinary medicine. Clearly, to confirm any diagnosis, a biopsy would have to happen.   But my confusion is here: cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant. It is given to humans who have had transplants. I understand that it is used in vet medicine for severe allergy. However, the vet thinks it is possibly a papilloma virus, but hasn't shared that immunosuppression can cause viruses that might be controlled by the immune system to be out of control. Then, to add to my confusion, s/he has prescribed an antibiotic to treat a presumed viral infection? Antibiotics do not treat or control viral infections.  I wonder if you are (unintentionally and understandably as a layperson) misunderstanding or misinterpreting what the vet has said? Or if you should get a different opinion?  Edit: I was sure that I was in /r/pets and not /r/AskVet when I posted--I'll leave this here and take my down votes. My apologies. I stand by my concerns, and they are what I would want to know from my vet in this situation."

I understand that it is used in vet medicine for severe allergy. However, the vet thinks it is possibly a papilloma virus, but hasn't shared that immunosuppression can cause viruses that might be controlled by the immune system to be out of control.    Key to all drugs is dosage. Most immunosuppressants act as anti-inflammatories at low doses. That's why you see prenisolone, dexamethosone, etc also used to treat allergies. There's a difference between an anti-inflammatory dose and an immunosuppressive dose.   Could they do a trial and see if the papillomatosis decreases with not taking cyclosporin any more? Sure, they could try but that's risking severe allergies showing up again and really should be the decision of the attending vet since they know the full history of the patient.    Then, to add to my confusion, s/he has prescribed an antibiotic to treat a presumed viral infection? Antibiotics do not treat or control viral infections.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18494759  You'd be surprised at how drugs work sometimes.

I've seen multiple patients fail to respond to multiple chemotherapy protocols that finally go home with pred to keep them comfortable...then go on to live for months and months afterwards.   So, while what you're seeing isn't a typical response, it's absolutely not unheard of. Cherish the awesome extra time you're getting!"

AskVet,3da8f0,ted_bolub,3,Wed Jul 15 01:18:07 2015 UTC,"My dog was diagnosed with bladder cancer in February of this year. We found out because she seemed like she had a UTI but didn't respond to antibiotics, and it turned out to be a tumor that was protruding into her bladder. I did just what you did, took her home thinking I'd try the pred but that I'd be losing her soon.  After a couple of weeks on the prednisone, her peeing went back to normal. I took her for a follow up and the tumor appeared to be gone. We just did an ultrasound, no biopsy as the risk was too great, but it looked like it was gone and she was back to normal.  I kept her on the prednisone and she was great for about 4 months, then she started straining to pee again. Over the course of this last month, she declined. She became semi incontinent, she fell all of the time due to her hips being in bad shape, and right before the 4th of July she couldn't hold herself up to pee or poop. She was in pain and she wasn't going to get better, so last Wednesday I let her go.  I'm completely heartbroken over it, but I know it was the best thing to do.  So, in short, prednisone gave me 5 extra months with my best friend. I'm very happy for you and your dog, keep an eye on it by bringing him in regularly for rechecks. Good luck!"

Or if there could be a mass in one's chest that would be easily treated with Prednisone like that. From what I can tell even if it were lymphoma or thymoma, that's a pretty weird reaction to reduce from a 20 once porterhouse steak to barely noticeable on xray."
AskVet,3da8f0,drerick,8,Tue Jul 14 20:25:38 2015 UTC,I've seen this happen in human patients before. Some tumors melt away with steroids (especially lymphomas). Not a permanent cure in most cases (especially given predictable side effects of steroids). Enjoy your extra time with your pooch!
AskVet,3da8f0,marmot_riot,2,Tue Jul 14 20:47:00 2015 UTC,"There also might be fluid around the mass in the original x-ray (fluid and soft tissue can look identical).

We are having some of the same trouble with our cat (loosing weight, had pancreatitis, and some other issues) since about January too and have been working a lot with our vet recently. I asked her Friday about a steroid because last time our cat had the prednisone shot she felt great! She did mention that we had to wait on the prednisone until after our ultra sound because it can make cancer go into remission. If our kitty has cancer I am going to bring up the prednisone again and tell her about your experience! Chemo and surgery just sound very hard on a little animal."
AskVet,3da8f0,skipsteejsprat,5,Tue Jul 14 19:11:45 2015 UTC,Cancer is also very hard on little animals.  Prednisone is typically a more temporary fix than surgery and chemo.

Chemo in animals works very differently than in humans and isn't given in the same quantity. In vet med, the goal of chemo is to decrease symptoms and improve quality of life, but often isn't given at doses that would be curative."

Secondly, I'd call your vet regarding swapping to a smaller dose if you're seeing weight loss that bumps her down into the lower weight range. Generally, it will be safe to give a higher dose as their safety trials usually treats the safety of the drug by giving a much much much higher dose than is recommended and see how they do."

I gladly will if it'll fix this but it hasn't. I actually cut it out immediately and switched him to solely kibble and just switched him back to both last week because there was no change and raw usually helps his stool firm up a bit so I thought it might help.

I could tell she was not happy.  Her vet thought she might have a food allergy, and wanted her to try special food. I didn't think an allergy was likely, but I figured changing foods would be an easy thing to try. She is on Hill's prescription diet (sensitive skin food) and it has worked wonders!!

As far as contraindications go, any underlying kidney disease, GI tract disorder (frequent vomiting or diarrhea), or liver disease may have your vet considering options other than NSAIDs (same class as aspirin/ibuprofen, but veterinary specific ones that are safer).

If that seems too high, go somewhere else and do the same thing.  Most clinics will not give an estimate over the phone, and rightfully so, since we can't trust your description of what needs to be done, we need to see it for ourselves."
AskVet,3dau5j,petites_pattes,2,Tue Jul 14 21:58:15 2015 UTC,"As some have said, it varies tremendously. Your best bet is to take her in for an oral/dental exam to get an estimate. Once you've had a vet give an estimate based on your pet's needs, the prices shouldn't vary tremendously within your specific location."
AskVet,3d9s8i,sirenita12,3,Tue Jul 14 16:45:27 2015 UTC,Do you know if the vet performed any other tests (e.g. bloodwork)?
AskVet,3d9s8i,petites_pattes,2,Tue Jul 14 17:42:46 2015 UTC,"Should have mentioned that.  No signs of infection, but a slightly elevated potassium level. I was told it's not high enough to worry about kidney failure since he is eating/drinking & producing urine, & is still so young."
AskVet,3d9s8i,goatsickle,4,Tue Jul 14 17:56:30 2015 UTC,"Can you post a copy of the blood work?  I'd be curious to see sodium/potassium ratio.    In general, chronic diarrhea isn't something that can be messed with from the sidelines because there are so many variables."

AskVet,3d9s8i,goatsickle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:23:21 2015 UTC,Flagyl can do a number on the kidneys of humans. Could the elevated potassium be linked to the metronidazole?
AskVet,3d9s8i,goatsickle,3,Tue Jul 14 20:07:11 2015 UTC,Just double checked - increased potassium is not a known adverse effect of metronidazole.
AskVet,3d9s8i,goatsickle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:39:26 2015 UTC,The elevated potassium was at the same vet visit that he tested positive for giardia. He hadn't been on the metranidazol yet.

AskVet,3daffb,snocodiles,6,Tue Jul 14 19:22:06 2015 UTC,"Sometimes it's tough to get experience working with a veterinarian without working your way through some dirty jobs (like cleaning kennels) first. Don't be discouraged if you're ever told that you don't have enough experience. Keep looking and go after every opportunity that catches your attention. Sometimes building a solid reputation as a reliable and responsible volunteer while shoveling poop can give you the foundation and letters of rec you need to get the sweet gigs.  That said, don't sell yourself short with this specific opportunity. If you look and act the part, chances are that they'll like you and whisk you right along even if you are totally new to this experience. Do you have / can you buy durable khaki pants? You don't have to spend a lot of money to get something that can stand up to some mild abuse but still look nice. And as far as tops, maybe a button up short sleeve shirt (like this - obviously that's kinda pricey, but I'm sure you can find something similar at an outlet or department store). Make sure you wear sturdy, close toed shoes that will be comfortable to walk/stand all day in, but that aren't flashy or casual looking (black is always safe).   Be yourself. Be attentive, eager (but not obnoxiously so) and honest. Don't feel embarrassed or reluctant to reveal your level experience when asked directly - if they want to know, then tell them that you haven't yet had the chance to work with a veterinarian but then immediately follow up with a positive truth about yourself (for example, ""but I'm a very fast learner and I'm super enthusiastic about being here and doing what I can."" Just be positive and receptive. Confidence, confidence, confidence - it goes a long way! :)  Good luck and have fun!!"

AskVet,3d9e88,mars6,4,Tue Jul 14 15:05:37 2015 UTC,"No. Cats do not typically demonstrate they are in pain like dogs. They will typically become more reclusive and may stop eating. Many times they will be hunched over if they are in pain instead of resting comfortably (in a ball for example). If your cat is demonstrating any signs of pain( ie limping), there is a very good chance that she is injured or Ill. She really needs to see a veterinarian for a good physical exam and work up."
AskVet,3d9e88,account86698,3,Tue Jul 14 15:19:20 2015 UTC,Agreed. Cats are very good at hiding pain so the fact that yours is showing discomfort is not a good sign. She very likely needs a trip to the vet.
AskVet,3d9e88,miosgoldenchance,2,Tue Jul 14 16:37:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you! She looks to be resting comfortably and is eating, but has been sleeping under a table, which is unusual. We've contained her to the main floor so she doesn't have to use the stairs and will definitely take her for an exam."

AskVet,3d9e88,DrDead88,4,Tue Jul 14 19:13:41 2015 UTC,"While she may or may not have a serious injury, she's definitely showing signs of pain. Even if she isn't a good traveler, I think it's definitely worth getting an appointment today to get her assessed, and started on pain medications (and any others, if injuries beyond musculoskeletal are found) if the vet feels it's warranted."
AskVet,3d96bi,Solilloquy,2,Tue Jul 14 14:02:55 2015 UTC,"I know that feel when it comes to pets ear infections. I found that a couple of ways cleaning ears worked for me. I would either wait until my cat was fast asleep I would start petting her to let her know that I was there. Finally I would slowly clean her ears with a kleenex wrapped on my finger. Once that part was done then I would put the ointment in really fast(ninja style) and rub the ear.  Sometimes that didn't work, so I would wrap her up in a towel and have her face me. Clean the ears with my kleenex, rub some ointment in there and let her run off (albeit with a slew of cat swearing as well)  Sometimes you have to restrain the kitty, they don't understand why make a big deal about it (drama queens). But after 5 minutes of everything being said and done I'm sure their ears feel better.  Best of luck :)"
AskVet,3d96bi,inkedkoi,2,Tue Jul 14 17:22:45 2015 UTC,"I'm a certified veterinary technician, and can try to help guide you with new ideas if you'd like!   So, I know you didn't mention exactly how you're capturing her to clean her ears, BUT it is never too late to make positive associations with getting our ears cleaned. :)  Firstly, does she have any favorite treats or canned food? I've recommended to clients that have similar issues to yours to break out one their cats' favorite yummy treats, get it ready and have out so the kitty knows it's coming soon. Once they come to you, have a towel ready to wrap her up in (like a little kitty burrito) - this can help you restrain her; I would also suggest that after wrapping her in this towel, to put her in between your thighs on the ground - http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-s1oF_F5NUM8/T1-cTh5fDII/AAAAAAAAAg0/OgRlh4KDL_A/s1600/w+position.jpg -similar to this photo. I would also try getting some cotton balls really soaked so you can then put one in the ear, squeeze the cotton ball out (this will get the medicated cleaner in there, and not feel as weird as just pouring it in, if you get my drift). You can still effectively clean her ears like this; still rub gently at the base of the ear while the liquid is in there, let her shake after and then wipe out gently with clean cotton balls. Once you're finished with all of this, give her a yummy treat! Please know that giving the treat after can help make a positive association. I've had luck with giving my cat (who's a serious rascal) a small amount of tuna or canned chicken with the juice after cleaning his ears.   I hope this helps some!"
AskVet,3d96bi,gelloz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:08:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions guys! Minx actually doesn't like cat treats but I am not sure about tuna.

AskVet,3d8z6f,bmrsooner1121,7,Tue Jul 14 12:59:02 2015 UTC,Please read the sidebar and FAQ.  Then make sure to look into Carecredit.  If don't qualify ask friends and family.  If your current financial situation is permanent then you need to surrender the dog to a local shelter or humane society.
AskVet,3d8z6f,ironmouse,6,Tue Jul 14 13:29:29 2015 UTC,"The dog needs to see a vet. As mentioned, look into care credit, and I would strongly recommend spaying the dog and stop breeding her if you cannot afford vet bills. Pyometra is a very real and life threatening concern with intact females."

AskVet,3d7enb,erinarian,3,Tue Jul 14 03:07:35 2015 UTC,"You're right, I know I won't get a clear answer here. I suppose I was really just looking for general comments on whether a broken jaw and a popped eye would normally result in a cat being put down if it wasn't a stray? I get that it would obviously depend on a ton of things, and perhaps the kidney disease was worse than was implied over the phone, which I assume would have made it cruel to keep him alive and suffering.  Honestly, I considered calling them earlier and asking them to explaining exactly why they made the decision to put him down after reading that reversible kidney disease can happen after a traumatic incident, and also considering I explained I was happy to pay for the surgery if need be. But, I figured I didn't want to be the guy who Googled something now assumes he can question a professional's decision for what I'm sure they saw as just a stray cat (hence no call before putting him to sleep)."

I'm not exactly sure of the intention of the treatment. Just trying to clear up exactly what I've heard.   I know veterinarians are knowledgeable and generally have an animal's best interest at heart, but the one's I've been to around here tend to avoid clear answers when it comes to big money, hence my concerns about this being necessary or not.

It could be issues with the lungs, heart, larynx, or something systemic.  He should be seen today or tomorrow if you can get an appointment.  Until then, keep him calm and cool.  If his respiratory rate is above 40 breaths per minute when he's completely at rest (even sleeping), it could be an emergency and he should be taken somewhere immediately."

AskVet,3d46ht,karayna,5,Mon Jul 13 11:26:26 2015 UTC,"Commenting only to say this is the first time I've heard of chip neutering.  We have chemical neutering with Zeuterin in the US (I've seen it done, but personally don't know a clinic that actually does it). Any UK vets out there know more about the chip neutering?"
AskVet,3d46ht,ironmouse,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:40:00 2015 UTC,"Wow, I didn't know that it was that uncommon! All forms of neutering are uncommon here, where only 10% of all dogs are fixed. My vet is the only one at the clinic who has a lot of experience with these chips. The only reported side effect (according to our national pharmaceutical database) is swelling and redness around the insertion area."

AskVet,3d46ht,Urgullibl,3,Tue Jul 14 01:39:51 2015 UTC,"Are we talking about the 6 month or the 12 month chip?   Suprelorin has a flare-up effect before the testosterone levels drop to zero, so that's what you may be seeing at the moment. That flare-up lasts longer with the 12 month chip than it does with the 6 month chip.  If he is still exhibiting the same behaviors four weeks from now, talk to your vet about removing the chip."
AskVet,3d49kj,gpia7r,2,Mon Jul 13 12:04:31 2015 UTC,"Typically, when we see vomit and stool irregularities that are going on for a few days, that's a reason worthy of a vet visit. Signs like this can be indicative of anything from a minor, self-regulating illness, all the way up to a life-threatening medical emergency.   If possible, try to gather some fresh stool from the dogs (separately) for analysis at the clinic. Also, be sure to note the characteristics of the vomit; take note of color, consistency, are there bits of food in it, is there yellow or green liquid, is it dark red, etc. These can sometimes help us to determine where exactly in the GI tract the illness is originating."

AskVet,3d49kj,ArtistWhoStarves,3,Tue Jul 14 00:22:52 2015 UTC,"You better back that up with some recent research that proves my virology professor wrong.  Yes, there is a new strain of canine influenza in the Midwest US. However, canine influenza is rarely fatal. The real problem here though, is that there is no reason at all for influenza to be on your differentials. Influenza causes respiratory disease in dogs, not gastrointestinal."
AskVet,3d4wju,L00seTheGoose,2,Mon Jul 13 15:31:02 2015 UTC,"The only other viable option would really be cyberknife radiation vs conventional(which is what was recommended by your oncologist). Cyberknife is more expensive than traditional and was likely not mentioned because its only offered in the northeast. Cyberknife typically involves one to three treatments (given over the course of a week, I believe) and gives a similar prognosis to conventional radiation. The benefits are the shorter treatment protocol, more targeted radiation(so his eye is spared) and similar prognosis.  As far as I know the only two cyberknife centers for pets are in malvern, pa and Yonkers, NY. If you are up for the cost and a short vacation...you could always call one of those two centers and see if they could do a phone consult with you to discuss your options. I don't work with cyberknife, so I don't know a ton about it, but I know it's an option for nasal tumors. I do work with conventional radiation and can try to answer any questions you might have about it."

AskVet,3d33lg,whatamoppet,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:37:57 2015 UTC,"I was thinking it might be a cat bite based on the picture I got today since it looks like little puncture marks.  I think he would be defined as a stray cat over a feral based on my understanding of the differences, but I've seen him since he was a tiny kitten so I'm pretty sure he was born outside and not abandoned. I think since he has been getting fed by humans (my neighbors also sometimes feed him) his whole life he's not completely feral. He seems to generally live alone. I've seen him with other cats on occasion but not like some of the little colonies of 5-6 cats I see by dumpsters in my complex that are always with each other.  Yes I can touch him. I haven't tried to ever pick him up but he lets me pet him and will rub up against my leg repeatedly, stopping while I scratch behind his ears. He can be a bit skittish if I do quick moves. He often will walk along side me when I call for him when I get home and then follow me to the door to my apartment and sit waiting for me to return with food. He also will sometimes meow around me and will look at me in the eyes which I've read are things that most ferals don't do."

Sometimes something basic like a change in diet to a sensitive food can help, staying away from grappy meadows or topical steroid sprays for the skin for bad days to take down the itch.

AskVet,3d2z4b,pnicw78,3,Mon Jul 13 02:48:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd say that cost is about right, even a little inexpensive, for an annual visit. Annual heartworm tests are standard protocol (and I assume lyme is as well? Not from a state where it's prevalent, so we don't do it, but maybe someone from up north could chime in on that one?).  There's a few reasons why we check for heartworms on a yearly basis. First, you might miss a dose of preventative. We get busy, it happens. Maybe your dog goes behind the couch and spits it out. There are always circumstances where he could not get the dose he needs. Second, your dog can still get infected while on heartworm preventative. It's unlikely if you're on it regularly, but there have been cases of heartworms from dogs with preventatives due to resistance.  So why does it matter? Two reasons: one, giving heartworm prevention to a dog that is heartworm positive can cause a dangerous reaction. Two, heartworms need to be treated as soon as possible because they can be very life threatening for your dog.  At your dog's size, it could easily cost over $1000 for him to get treated for heartworms if he were to get them. It's a lot easier to spend $50 a year on testing for it than to not know and it get out of hand.   Hope that answers your questions."
AskVet,3d2z4b,biologynerd3,3,Mon Jul 13 03:20:20 2015 UTC,"Heartworm and Lyme are both in the same test, along with Ehrlichia and Anaplasma. So the one test you paid $50 for screened your pet for all 4 diseases."

AskVet,3d17d6,chubbzzz90,12,Sun Jul 12 17:54:27 2015 UTC,"One set is the deciduous (baby/primary/milk) teeth and one set is the adult teeth coming in. In an ideal situation, the baby tooth will fall out on its own or get pushed out by the erupting adult tooth. Unfortunately, sometimes they decide to stay in there forever and have to be removed.   I would talk to your kitten's vet and figure out a plan. Namely, how long you want to wait for the tooth to come out on its own and, if it does not come out on its own, a set date for extraction.  Removal is your best option if it does not come out on its own. If teeth are retained, it can cause overcrowding in the mouth. New teeth coming in may potentially grow in at awkward angles. The overcrowding also leads to an extra buildup of debris between the teeth, leading to inflammation of the gums, gum disease, and potentially early tooth loss."
AskVet,3d17d6,shitidneversay,3,Sun Jul 12 18:13:27 2015 UTC,Usually we remove any remaining baby teeth at neutering because they are under a general anaesthetic and if they havent fallen out by 6 months then they are unlikely to.
AskVet,3d17d6,whatamoppet,2,Mon Jul 13 00:44:14 2015 UTC,"Nope, you are seeing both his deciduous (""baby"") and permanent canines on that side. While the baby tooth may come out on it's own, it may require extraction. If he's otherwise doing well (eating/drinking normally, no signs of pain or discomfort) then you may be able to monitor it, but if there's no progress (or it becomes painful, red/bleeding, affecting mouth closure or eating, etc) in the next few weeks, you will have to schedule an extraction. You should give your vet a call though, to see if they'd noticed it and to get their recommendation, since they've actually seen him."

For that, only a vet and/or a pathologist would be able to do.  I've been told the same thing, that lipomas need only be removed if aesthetically bothersome to the owner, or if causing motile hinderabilty to the pup. In this case, I'm simply trying to seek out anyone who has had this process undergone for their pet, and if so, the general cost, fees, and expenses they encountered."

Edit: Sometimes for a large mass with a lot of dead space to close up, we'll place a drain to prevent fluid buildup that needs to be removed in a few days.

AskVet,3d1j7i,Tobimaru,3,Sun Jul 12 19:54:06 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm so sorry, lymphoma is such a horrible disease.   When you choose euthanisia is a very personal decision but I always try to tell my clients this: A dog has no concept of length of life. They dont have the mental capacity to understand that at all. They know 'being happy' and 'being sad'. This means that you are always looking at quality of life over quantity of life.  There is no respite from this disease; even an oncologist can only buy time and that is with expensive chemotherapeutic drugs, a lot of vet visits (so travel, day stays in the vets) and quite a lot of stress. I personally only advocate chemo if the disease is caught super early, and even then it is a postponement not a cure.   Basically, you know him better than anyone. If he's miserable, then let him go. If he's happy, keep going until he isn't.   And please give him a huge hug from me."
AskVet,3d1j7i,whatamoppet,2,Mon Jul 13 00:52:00 2015 UTC,"While we can't cure lymphoma (yet, monoclonals are on the way), we can buy them quite a lot of quality time. I'd encourage you to re-think your tendency to advocate chemo only if the disease is caught super early. While yes, it's expensive, if an owner wants/needs that extra time, why deny them the opportunity? I feel like you're overstating the stress involved for the majority of patients. Almost all of my patients (dogs, at least) love coming to see us each week. We are always stocked with chicken, peanut butter and cookies to make the visits awesome for them. They get blankets and beds and belly rubs while we administer the drugs. And only one of the drugs we use (after two other multi-drug protocols fail) ever requires a day long hospital stay.   Cancer isn't an easy thing to have a loved one go through, but we're here to give pets and their owners more quality time. We don't want to prolong their suffering. It's always about quality of life with us."
AskVet,3d1j7i,Tobimaru,3,Mon Jul 13 01:26:43 2015 UTC,"Haha your practice sounds like ours; a treat cupboard as big as the drug cupboard!  Its very true that our knowledge of chemo is compling on leps and bounds, and I do keep trying chemo, but I'm not yet convinced. I did say I ""dont advocate it"" but that was probably a little strong; it's always on the viable options list, but I dont push it heavily. It's always a discussion between owner and client though, and speaking to someone in person makes that conversation much easier; some clients you know will want every drop of chemo until the last day, some you instinctively know want to be told that euthanasia is humane and that they shouldnt feel guilty for not wanting to try chemo (and a heck of a lot of grey cases in between, of course). :)"
AskVet,3d1j7i,whatamoppet,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:40:24 2015 UTC,It's an interesting topic...I think another side of the equation is the possibility that almost all of your patients are happy ones because GP vets aren't strongly recommending chemo/radiation for pets that we know would be miserable coming in on a regular basis.

AskVet,3d139i,mayikillhim,6,Sun Jul 12 18:06:23 2015 UTC,"I agree. And 10 weeks old is actually late for starting vaccinations. All the kittens need a trip to the vet, but him especially."
AskVet,3d139i,tehMunkee,5,Sun Jul 12 23:04:36 2015 UTC,"Do you live in a hard water area (I believe Florida has hard water)?  Hard water can leave soap residue on skin/fur and not rinse out completely, and that could explain the oily fur if the soap was not able to rinse out well.  If you can bath the kitten in soft, filtered water (to take out the minerals and chlorine), you will likely see an improvement in the greasy fur situation.  But you are right to be concerned with what might cause the urine and feces in the fur in the first place, and the kitten not grooming and not being as active as the other kittens.  It sounds like you should have a vet take a look at the kitten to see what might be causing those things."

AskVet,3d0v06,Mithrandork,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:19:14 2015 UTC,"You say he doesn't have any tear ducts...do you mean he has dry eye? If so, has he seen the vet for it? Does he have eye drops to correct it?   Has he seen the vet about his ears? Large amounts of build up usually means they're infected.   Both of these problems can be very painful and dangerous to his overall health if not properly treated, and I recommend he see the vet for them sooner rather than later."

A vet will feel for them though, to see if they are enlarged."
AskVet,3d1tma,Ebbing,3,Sun Jul 12 21:31:48 2015 UTC,"I appreciate it. I know of all the external nodes, but I really had no idea that they were all palpable at any given time to a certain size and also, I may be going about feeling for them totally wrong. You have been so reassuring to me. I feel a lot less anxious already. :)"
AskVet,3d1tma,Ebbing,4,Sun Jul 12 21:35:45 2015 UTC,"How big are the popliteal nodes? It's normal to feel the left node even if there's no ongoing infection. You are jumping to conclusions - lymphoma. All  lymph nodes should be oversized if that's the case. Which I highly doubt. BUT if you want to sleep better at night, ask for a hematology run the next time you go to the vet and you'll know for sure.   Edit: you described the left lymph node with the general description of a normal lymph node :)"
AskVet,3d1tma,Ebbing,2,Sun Jul 12 21:07:03 2015 UTC,"The right one I'd say is a little less than gumball sized, the left one I would say somewhere between pistachio and marble sized.

I am definitely a worry wart and don't deny my silly behavior. I just need some type of intellectual reassurance.

AskVet,3d1tma,whatamoppet,3,Sun Jul 12 21:13:37 2015 UTC,"Ok, relax. As I mentioned before, it's normal to be able to palpate the lymph nodes and pistachio size = normal size. It also takes some time for a lymph node to return to its normal size after an infection."

AskVet,3d0b3a,skipsteejsprat,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:56:05 2015 UTC,I would go back to the vet then.
AskVet,3d0b3a,Ebbing,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:57:15 2015 UTC,"I think she might be hiding food or toys and trying to cover it with her snout. Did you ever see her do this? It could be possible she does it when you are not looking - this is the point of hiding stuff anyway. You know dogs cover up stuff with their snout. It usually happens when they're trying to hide stuff on cement or hard grounds. Otherwise, put a cone on her until it heals. I wouldn't suggest administering prednisone for this."
AskVet,3d0b3a,whatamoppet,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:17:25 2015 UTC,"My recommendation would be to go back into the vets for some more tests. A skin scrape might be  good start, and if that doesnt yield anything new, an allergy blood panel.   Actual damage to the mouth from rough-housing/digging etc is massively uncommon and would likely just be a one off, and if it did occur it would just be an isolated incident rather than improve then come back.  Also just cuts would have their healing impeded by steroids rather then improving, which shows that pruritis (itching) is likely a factor here.  Skin scrapes will check for parasites such as demodex.   If you have a 'drooler' then lip fold dermatitis could also be a cause."

Also keep in mind that sometimes UTI can cause nausea and vomiting as millions of women can attest to.  Combine the nausea from the UTI with antibiotics on an empty stomach and you have nearly the perfect recipe for vomit on your favorite shoes.

AskVet,3czqu7,dipidipyoudip,5,Sun Jul 12 06:46:21 2015 UTC,"You're going to have to treat all the cats, the house and the yard, and it's going to take a multi-prong approach that is on-going.  You have to attack the fleas on your cats, their eggs, their larvae, interfere with their reproduction AND kill the fleas that are outside if you want any hope of ridding your pet of fleas.  first, get the flea-killer pills like Capstar that kill all the fleas on your cats within 30 minutes.  You'll want to give them that once a week or so till you don't find any flea evidence.  this needs to be given to all the cats.  It will provide them immediate relief.  it doesn't kill fleas on-going, but after they take it, they may have the first uninterrupted sleep they've had in a while because nothing will be biting them.  second, get a monthly flea treatment like Advantage (tablet) or monthly spot-on treatment.   Since the cats go outside frequently, you'll need to do this every month ALL the time.  Just make it part of your life, once a month, zap the cats for fleas.  third, you can add flea collars to this plan.  Get one that kills and repels fleas, larvae and eggs.  (Some will not kill larvae or eggs so read labels).  You can get collars that last up to 8 months.  This will provide a broad on-going protection.  fourth, vacuum the house, paying special attention to carpets and any place the cats sleep.  Fleas lay eggs on the cat, but they fall off and larvae develop in carpets and bedding.  Vacuuming has to be part of your treatment plan.  Wash cat bedding in very hot water once a week, or at least every two weeks.  You can put the trimmed part of the cat flea collars into the vacuum bag.  fifth, attack fleas at their source.  You'll never get rid of them if you don't treat the part of your lawn where the cats go outside.  Fleas prefer shade, so are more likely under trees rather than out in the sunny grass.  Clean up any piles of leaves or brush where fleas will hide.  Then treat the lawn with a pyrethrin/pyrethrum lawn insect treatment.  A granular type is easy to work with.  Follow the directions on the package.    This product is safe for pets after watering the product into the lawn thoroughly and allowing it to dry.  It lasts three months.  If you are in a seasonal climate, get it down in early spring as soon as you start to notice bugs outside, and then every three months till the first frost. Treat at least for 10 feet outside the fenced area too, since fleas jump.    http://www.homedepot.com/p/Scotts-Snap-Pac-8-lb-Multi-Insect-Killer-24570A  You can also use a more natural insect killer like this one that contains diatomaceous earth: http://www.lowes.com/pd_93648-316-HG-93186_1z0wgg2__?productId=3276739&pl=1  Eliminating fleas is a multi prong approach.  Unless you do it all, you'll constantly be battling fleas.  But once you attack fleas on all fronts like this--on the cat, in the carpet and in the yard, you can back off your full attack plan to a maintenance/prevention plan with just flea collars and an early spring treatment of your yard."

AskVet,3czqu7,whatamoppet,2,Sun Jul 12 15:52:03 2015 UTC,"Fleas are a royal pain Im afraid. It sounds as well like your cat may have 'flea allergic dermatitis' which is a fancy way of saying she is more sensitive to flea bites than other cats (the same as some people get huge reactions to mosquito bites etc). This means she wont be comfortable unless you get the fleas under control.   I recommend doing lots of the hoovering and bed washing (as frequently as you can) because the more you can get rid of the eggs the more you can break the cycle and at least thats free :). Unfortuntely fleas like to lay eggs in the dark, dusty bits (ie the most difficult to clean areas) so it is a bit of a ball ache but worth it!  It ususally takes at LEAST 6 months to completely clear a flea-filled house so if you are still seeing the odd flea in a couple of months dont panic. Just keep going!"
AskVet,3czqu7,rvtjess,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:09:53 2015 UTC,"All of this, focusing on the fact that ALL pets, indoor or not, cats AND any dogs, must be on a monthly flea prevention."

However, his ""eye reactions"" have been more frequent and this morning he came to me meowing (unusual), and his eye drastically changed over night. Here are some close up pictures.

In reality he's simply a breed of cat that is harder to find and thus costs more money.  Medically, anatomically, and for all purposes veterinary they are the same as the stray off the street. I have worked with them first hand.  That being said, yes that dramatic of a change in the eye requires immediate medical attention.  Unfortunately eyes are some of the most delicate parts of the body and vision can be lost if the issue is not addressed quickly (read: today).  Feel free to ask any more questions.  I'll answer the best I can."
AskVet,3cxul7,TwinkyK,2,Sat Jul 18 20:18:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that, will take him in now.  I wasn't trying to make him out to be something he is not. I know he's technically not exotic, hence the quotation marks. But I put that there because everyone thinks he is due to his size. And he is special, god damnit haha."
AskVet,3cww7f,zymurgist86,6,Sat Jul 11 14:10:00 2015 UTC,"Has he been tested for heartworm, fungal disease?  You say he came from Missouri, but where did he live before that?  Have there been xrays?  Did they get sent to a radiologist?  If so what did that report say?  Has full blood work been done since the allergy testing?  What about lung cultures?    If he was mine, I would go to internal medicine and/or dermatology for second opinions and additional diagnostics.  If every (labs, rads, cultures, etc) still comes back environmental allergies, discuss Apoquel.  Its slowly coming off back order and depending on how quickly your regular vet and the specialists hopped on the lists that may be an option for you."
AskVet,3cww7f,Neryian,2,Sat Jul 11 14:31:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks! He did have X-Rays, and they didn't show anything wrong.  I'm going off receipts I have here, so if some of this isn't germane, I apologize. I'm not sure I know what half of it means:   9/5/2014:    Cefpodoxime Proxetil 100mg Heartworm test Fecal exam Lepto4 annual Dhpp 3 year   7/23/2013:   Radiology Survey Fungal Serology Torbutrol 10mg   4/9/2013: SNAPshot Dx:   AP-spp - Negative EC-EE - Negative HW - Negative Lyme - Negative   Digging further into paperwork that came with him:    Breed: Border Collie - I think that must have been a best guess.  Looks like he's from Knob Noster, MO. The previous owners used vets in Warrensburg, MO, and a year later was getting his Rabies Vac. in Sedalia, MO, about 30 minutes to the east. The had him a little over a year."
AskVet,3cww7f,Neryian,2,Sat Jul 11 15:22:16 2015 UTC,"So looks like they ruled out heartworm, valley fever and took xrays.  I would go to cultures, both tracheal and lung and consult with a specialist.  If cultures are negative, discuss better long term management."
AskVet,3cx8jv,pingpongthoughts,5,Sat Jul 11 16:11:00 2015 UTC,These symptoms do not seem like they are caused by just a hairball. She really sounds like she should  be seen by a vet. Nausea and vomiting could both be caused by constipation/obstipation. If she hasn't used the litter box since Thursday I'd be really concerned. Try to get her in to the vet today.
AskVet,3cx8jv,Tobimaru,2,Sat Jul 11 16:29:57 2015 UTC,Hmm. I assume it was a hairball because of the similar hacking sounds she made. I'll try to get her in the vet today.  Edit: she just ate two treats I gave her so that's a new change!
AskVet,3cx8jv,Tobimaru,3,Sat Jul 11 16:42:36 2015 UTC,Realistically it could be any number of things. But any one of your cats three symptoms are enough to warrant a vet visit.
AskVet,3cybcw,thesingingnerd,3,Sat Jul 11 21:51:28 2015 UTC,"Likely behavioral, either related to their intact status, or asserting dominance, etc.   Don't go to the dog park, find some friends with dogs that you know/trust, and go elsewhere (better for so many reasons)."

AskVet,3cyrg0,whatamoppet,3,Sun Jul 12 01:35:28 2015 UTC,"Could be vaginitis. Your local vet will be able to take a good look and a swab for bacteria (if deemed necessary) and get her on some treatment. Whatever the cause, hopefully she should be fine with some tx and as long as she's bright and happy now she doesnt seem like anything has occured that will cause her lasting trauma.

Forgive us if we find a little humor in you reaching to the worst possible situation before even getting the kitten to a vet.
AskVet,3cyrg0,ironmouse,-10,Mon Jul 13 00:16:11 2015 UTC,"If you had to deal with the people I got her from, you'd understand. This fat fuck just picked her up and threw her in a box when I got her. Now he's calling me, begging for her back? Her vagina is red, swollen, with infection building up. I googled it. Pyometra was ruled out because she's too young. Vaginal trauma was next on the list. It isn't ridiculous, it's completely plausible. I didn't think people would fucking laugh about it like 12 year olds."
AskVet,3cxi07,That__Girl,5,Sat Jul 11 17:34:46 2015 UTC,"Two negative scrapings several weeks apart is standard.  They are not out for your money, they are following better protocols that a lot of vets that take them off meds too soon."
AskVet,3cxi07,skipsteejsprat,0,Sat Jul 11 19:47:46 2015 UTC,She is still on the medication. And they only scheduled her scrapes 2 weeks apart
AskVet,3cxi07,skipsteejsprat,4,Sat Jul 11 23:19:35 2015 UTC,"Again, that's standard protocol.  What's the issue?"
AskVet,3cxi07,biologynerd3,3,Sun Jul 12 00:54:33 2015 UTC,"I've seen dogs have one negative skin scrape and then be positive again on the second one. Demadex can be a real struggle to get rid of, but it's a heck of a lot easier to just get the second scrape than to think you're okay and have ti come back."
AskVet,3cxi07,dinosaur_vet,3,Sat Jul 11 20:15:32 2015 UTC,Yep standard procedure.   In my clinic we treat until 2 negative scrapes on treatment and do a recheck scrape 1 month off treatment.  We are not milking people for money....just have had too many dogs come to us for second opinions and it turns out the demodex wasn't fully treated the first time
AskVet,3cxi07,InspiredByKITTENS,6,Sun Jul 12 00:43:27 2015 UTC,"This is bad information. Standard of care is 2 negative, consecutive skin scrapes - given the small area of skin scraped, presumably if you had low but still more than normal numbers, you could miss it and stop treatment too soon. Same reasoning behind ""don't stop your antibiotics just because you feel better,"" really.  Please follow your veterinarian's advice. No one is trying to ""milk"" you for more money, this is in the best interest of your dog."
AskVet,3cwth2,shepards_hamster,5,Sat Jul 11 13:38:41 2015 UTC,"Not a vet, but long term work in vets.   Your pup will likely be fine, but I'd not do this again. As you already know. If you start to see any changes in behavior, etc, of course a vet visit is warranted.   You're likely going to keep seeing fleas unless you treat the dog and the household concurrently. Fleas are difficult to get rid of....partially because when you see live fleas on the dog, you're only seeing 5% of what is actually in the home. You've got 95% larvae and eggs, etc. you need to treat the house and then treat again two weeks later, to get any that were missed the first time.   And you may need to consider a prescription flea product like Nexgard, for the dog. Year round monthly prevention is your best weapon against fleas."
AskVet,3cwth2,cms9613,2,Sat Jul 11 14:58:36 2015 UTC,"I'm a certified veterinary technician and I agree with this comment.   To add on my two cents, of course it's wise to also treat the environment - vacuuming any and ALL carpeted areas weekly, clean any bedding/upholstery the pup goes on with hot water weekly, and treat. the. yard. Flea eggs can be anywhere and everywhere at any time! They're amazing at what they do, which is living. Flea infestations can take as long as 6 months to get rid of ""completely"" - and that's not even guaranteed.  Hope this helps."
AskVet,3cuwtd,titsmcgeek,12,Fri Jul 10 23:48:38 2015 UTC,Take her to a vet please.
AskVet,3cuwtd,ancilla1998,16,Sat Jul 11 00:19:07 2015 UTC,Foster huh? You got duped. No real foster would tell you to put aloe on mange. Take this dog to a vet ASAP.  It is likely very sick.
AskVet,3cuwtd,ironmouse,2,Sat Jul 11 00:28:46 2015 UTC,Well...I found her through a local shelter and they arranged this woman as the foster. I believe this was her first time as a foster. We also met up at the animal hospital so I didn't think anything of it. I figured if there was anything wrong with it then at least the staff would have said something as we were filling out paper work. Because it's the same animal hospital that's keeping her up to date with her shots. I have an appointment next Thursday for another set of shots.
AskVet,3cuwtd,ironmouse,7,Sat Jul 11 00:37:10 2015 UTC,Well that stinks.  Please call the hospital and schedule an appointment sooner.  What you are describing makes me concerned for the pup.  Also please ask them about flea and tick prevention. Did they not go over that with you today?
AskVet,3cuwtd,ironmouse,4,Sat Jul 11 00:41:02 2015 UTC,No they didn't.
AskVet,3cuwtd,Agnesanonymous,7,Sat Jul 11 01:13:18 2015 UTC,Well dang.  Make sure to ask a literal metric ton of basic care questions when you go in.  I would expect they would have done some of that today considering you are adopting through the hospital.
AskVet,3cuwtd,daydreams356,7,Sat Jul 11 01:15:04 2015 UTC,"Bad news all around and seems really shady on the foster/shelter's behalf.  Pup needs a vet pronto, but that's what everyone is saying.  Hugs!"

AskVet,3cuyop,GSpess,8,Sat Jul 11 00:04:58 2015 UTC,"You need to pick up the stools and your neighbors need to pick up the stools. It may be worthwhile to carry potty pads out there with you and place them under your dog's butts as they go to poop and dispose of it that way.   If this is affecting the majority of the dog population in the complex, realize that it may be something contagious and those who are leaving stools, even traces of it, are helping it spread to new dogs or even recontaminate those that might be going through treatment.  Also realize that this could potentially be something that could easily be transmissible to you.  As already suggested, you will want to have the vet to examine the stool. If they typically only do the ""float"" test, ask if they can do a ""direct"" fecal examination (where a sample of it is smeared directly on the slide and viewed under a microscope), as well.   If they are able to make a diagnosis that day, ask if there is any information that you need to give to the people with dogs and outside cats in your complex. Also, is there any special disposal of the stool that you need to do? Maybe they have a better suggestion than my potty pads idea. Also verify, is this something that puts you/other people in the complex are at risk of infection? If so, how do you reduce your risk of exposure while the dogs are recovering in your house?  If you think of other questions before you go into the vet (hopefully tomorrow), be sure to write it down so that you do not forget to ask."
AskVet,3cuyop,shitidneversay,6,Sat Jul 11 02:24:56 2015 UTC,"Bring a fecal sample with you, if you have a relationship established with your dog and vet already, dropping off a fecal sample prior to the appointment can help things move in the right direction more quickly!"

Do vets and pharmacists still prescribe and fill it? Yes, and I'm not sure why.  Also, has your veterinarian tried prednisolone tablets? If so, how about trying packing it into a canned food ""meatball"" or into a pill pocket - some cats do great with this; and if they don't we need to train them to do so!

We can't use pill-pockets because he's on a prescription diet - D/D dry food (the wet food we tried to meatball him with is prescription as well).

AskVet,3ctc0d,Rebekah88,9,Fri Jul 10 17:06:23 2015 UTC,"In the UK, Metacam has a licence for long term use in cats for arthritis. Side effects include GI ulceration (so should be given with food and stopped if any vomiting or diarrhoea), and potential worsening of renal function if it is already compromised (so monitoring of kidney and liver parameters with regular blood tests is sometimes performed). However, in old cats where pain is severely affecting quality of life, it is sometimes used in spite of liver or kidney disease because there aren't really any other options and the general consensus is that a potentially shorter, pain free life is better than a potentially longer one in pain. Philosophical discussions could go on for hours about that but ultimately it's up to us to make the decisions for our pets and personally I feel that leaving an animal in pain when there's something that can be done is cruel."

This was years ago when the full consequences of metacam were unknown.  It was caught extremely early (I watch my cats closely) and he lived another 2.5 years before his kidneys gave up.    That being said, your kitten is struggling overall.  Sometimes the need to improve quality of life supersedes risk.  I would ask if there's another option but otherwise, would use it if it reduces his pain.    Cats are careful not to show pain.  If they do, it's a problem."

One of those rules however (in my opinion), is that if you are seeing a Dachshund who is acting painful, then you need to consider intervertebral disc herniation as a strong possibility.  With older Dachshunds with neck pain, it's a disc until proven otherwise as far as I'm concerned.    Obviously I haven't seen or put hands on your little guy so take all of this with a grain of salt.  But when you see your vet next have them take a good look at his neck to look for signs of pain."

I would love for her to be an inside dog and be able to be inside when I'm not here but she is quite the destructive little girl.)
AskVet,3csrzl,rvtjess,2,Fri Jul 10 15:41:50 2015 UTC,"My girl has been on diethylstilbestrol for years, and I have not noticed any behavior changes with her, nor have I heard or seen that being a side effect in the clinic (not saying it CAN'T be, just that in my experience it is not a widely seen side effect). There are SEVERAL options out there, so I would at the very least give some of them a shot.  Diapers will work great for awhile, but after using them for a long time, pets tend to start getting urine scalding and having other issues due to laying in their own urine over time.  My recommendation is to talk to your vet about this and your concerns. Can you request your previous vet fax/email/mail your pet's entire medical record to your new vet to review so they can get an idea of meds that you've tried and your pet's reactions to each of them?"
AskVet,3csl13,jarrettmp,2,Fri Jul 10 12:59:06 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't use antibacterial soap on it (unless your vet told you to) and just use the medicated shampoo.  Otherwise, it looks scabbed over fine, but if you're truly curious I recommend going in for a recheck."

AskVet,3csl13,dmcindc,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:20:25 2015 UTC,"Have you used any flea product at the back of your dog's neck, like Profender?  This is what Profender did to my cat.  It was very red and inflamed and all his fur fell out.  I trimmed excess fur around the area, and used an antibiotic heeling ointment, and kept the area clean as needed with baby wipes (sensitive ones with aloe).   It doesn't look as bad in this photo, because I took the photo maybe a day or two after I began caring for it.  It took about two months for that patch of skin to start healing and for his fur to begin to grow back."
AskVet,3csl13,lil-demon,0,Sun Jul 12 23:48:16 2015 UTC,"Is it warm to the touch?  Every year around this time my Texas heeler gets a gigantic hot spot right on the cleft of her tail and it looks ferocious for weeks. At first it's wet and warm and bloody. After the terrible shot and antibiotics it starts to dry up and looks pretty similar to this for a while.  I'm assuming you monitor for infection, but when in doubt call your vet because they may just do a free follow up to make sure it's healing right, or you can have one of the techs/nurses look real quick on the way in."
AskVet,3csl13,rvtjess,3,Fri Jul 10 16:01:31 2015 UTC,Hot spots near the tail like that are almost always associated with fleas.

The first time it happened I went through her coat with a flea comb and found nothing, so I thought she'd been bit, but apparently not. She may have extraneous summer allergies, but we're not too worried. It happens every year and I treat it with Benadryl under her vet's supervision and voila. She's a mystery to me, but she qt."
AskVet,3csl13,rvtjess,2,Fri Jul 10 20:11:04 2015 UTC,"I wonder if it could be a flea allergy? Sometimes one bite will set these guys off, and even if they're on prevention most topicals require the flea/tick to bite the pet before it will kill them.

AskVet,3csl13,lil-demon,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:36:48 2015 UTC,"It might be. There's a dog hoarder catty-corner to my house (which the city hasn't addressed) so that's why I'm always on guard about fleas. She might be getting a couple of bites and going crazy about it.  I worked as a tech for a while but it was in an ER office and it just made me sad seeing all that, but sometimes we got a few quirky little dudes in. My favorite was a Neapolitan mastiff with a penchant for eating the tires off cars, and apparently always at 3am."
AskVet,3cru8r,lilbabyjesus,4,Fri Jul 10 07:01:37 2015 UTC,"From our FAQ:   Skin lesions are near-impossible to diagnose over the internet. Even in person, diagnostic tests like skin scrapings, tape preps, etc, often need to be performed in order to get closer to a diagnosis. The most accurate way to diagnose what the skin lesion may be is to have your vet perform a biopsy.    Please take your pet to a vet to have the problem looked at.   I'd advise against putting hydrocortisone on it because it looks like it's weeping quite a bit and if it is caused by an infection, the steroid by itself will make it worse.   You really need to go see a vet for this."

AskVet,3cp1lk,seven_wings,27,Thu Jul 9 16:59:22 2015 UTC,"Euthanasia is the kindest way to let her pass with minimal suffering. Starving or organ failure can lead to a very painful passing - keep in mind that cats are very stoic, by the time they show pain they are usually in a lot of it.  I'm so sorry you need to make this decision. My condolences."
AskVet,3cp1lk,brogaant,16,Thu Jul 9 17:03:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, a natural death is cruel, given that there are alternatives. While you may not be able to appreciate signs of pain, lethargy, inappetence, neglecting of grooming/personal hygeine/upkeep are all signs of feeling ill, and imply some level of suffering. In general, there are very few causes of death in animals that don't involve a level of suffering.   If finances truly prohibit any sort of workup or attempts at finding a cause/treatment (and there are options like borrowing, Care Credit, etc) I highly recommend looking into euthanasia (there are often at-home services available too, though they can be pricey). A euthanasia is one of the kindest things you can do for your pet when they are nearing the end and suffering, as it is a painless way to ease their passing."
AskVet,3cp1lk,DrDead88,10,Thu Jul 9 17:03:54 2015 UTC,"The needle prick is the worst part of the euthanasia process.  Once the injection starts, they just drift off to sleep.  There is no natural death that is more peaceful, in my opinion.  Sometimes they go naturally in their sleep, but more often they will slowly die over days or weeks."
AskVet,3cp1lk,skipsteejsprat,8,Thu Jul 9 20:33:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies so far. Tomorrow I'm gonna call a vet and schedule an appointment (ideally for the same day). If they suggest euthanasia, I'll take that option."
AskVet,3cp1lk,Urgullibl,17,Thu Jul 9 20:42:31 2015 UTC,"This is based on the feelings of whoever wrote this. The cat is blissfully unaware of any of this: it merely lost consciousness, and that was it.  Animals have no concept of their own mortality, but they definitely have a concept of feeling lousy without knowing why. Quality, not quantity of life is the kindest thing you can give them."
AskVet,3cp1lk,muffjazz,6,Thu Jul 9 17:44:16 2015 UTC,"Watching your cat leave this world is hard, but I bet what he's dealing with is a lot harder. Euthanasia is the most selfless thing you can do for a truly sick animal. It would be quite selfish to force him to undergo pain and discomfort when you have the option to prevent further suffering.  I recommend getting him looked at, finding his chances, and taking the appropriate actions based on the results.  Please don't make him suffer just because you can't handle watching it.  Best of luck."
AskVet,3cp1lk,boobiesiheart,5,Thu Jul 9 17:55:10 2015 UTC,"I've stayed with every animal, talking and touching them.      Seeing the void come over them also helped me."
AskVet,3cp1lk,RWeaverrr,7,Thu Jul 9 20:26:16 2015 UTC,Yes it's not a great thing to watch your animal pass away but it's also a terrible thing to watch your animal suffer in pain because you can't make the decision to help them on their way. Euthanasia via lethal injection is the most painless way for you to put down your animal.
AskVet,3cou8f,ostentia,5,Thu Jul 9 16:05:49 2015 UTC,"The necropsy would have been the only way to know for sure. I'm surprised - was there no other information you were given from the pathology report? The silver ribbon hanging out of her mouth gives cause for concern about an intestinal foreign body--but evidence to confirm that would have come up on necropsy.  If you didn't get any info beyond the confirmation that her death was not due to rabies or poisoning, I suggest you call the vet back and ask for more specific details.  I'm really sorry for your loss. The passing of a pet is hard enough--but not knowing the cause can add to the pain. I hope you get a definitive answer."
AskVet,3cou8f,petites_pattes,2,Thu Jul 9 16:44:16 2015 UTC,"We got the results of the necropsy via a very difficult to understand voicemail, unfortunately. The only details we could make out were that it wasn't rabies or poison. We tried calling back once and didn't get an answer...I'm going to try again. There may have been more info on the voicemail or report, but we just couldn't understand it.  Thank you. It's been very concerning, since we aren't sure if it was something we could've prevented, some kind of freak accident, something that could be affecting our other animals, or what. We're watching the others (1 cat, 2 dogs) like hawks now."
AskVet,3cou8f,brogaant,12,Thu Jul 9 16:52:40 2015 UTC,"If you paid for the necropsy service, the entire pathology report should be available to you as it is legally your property. I'd give them a call and ask them to email or fax you a copy of the report. The ending of the report should summarize the findings. Good luck."
AskVet,3cou8f,DrDead88,8,Thu Jul 9 17:07:34 2015 UTC,Good to know. Thank you! I'll give the vet a call. I did think it was strange that they just left a voicemail instead of providing us with a report or something.
AskVet,3cou8f,DrDead88,5,Thu Jul 9 17:12:47 2015 UTC,"Rabies was definitely one of my thoughts, until the end. But if the tissue was submitted to the state and came back negative, then it's unlikely.   Other causes could be some sort of brain tumor, metabolic disease (was any bloodwork run?), etc. Unfortunately, a necropsy is usually the best way to find answers, so it's unfortunate that a diagnosis was not found. It may be possible to submit for a necropsy at a referral hospital or vet school, for a pathologist to look at.   Unfortunately, you may not get an answer at this point though. For future pets, I would try and keep them indoors in possible- it greatly reduces the risk of any weird infectious, traumatic, or toxic causes of death."
AskVet,3cou8f,DrDead88,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:41:59 2015 UTC,"It really did seem like rabies, but the vet was certain that the results were negative. I'm not sure if bloodwork was run...we did wonder if it may have been a tumor. I didn't realize that we could still submit for a necropsy elsewhere. That's an interesting option. Does that tend to be expensive?  She was a 100% indoor kitty...we even checked the basement for holes that animals could've gotten into, or weird spills or anything of the like.    Thank you for your answer!"
AskVet,3cou8f,Xhexania,3,Thu Jul 9 16:47:52 2015 UTC,"Ah, I apologize, I saw that her mother was an outdoor cat, and assumed.   Cost depends on the place providing the service, but I would check with the UPenn Vet School (or ask your vet to check) to look into having one done there."

AskVet,3cqnlj,Tobimaru,2,Fri Jul 10 00:32:32 2015 UTC,"Just making sure. I've never used that particular drug before, but the vet that prescribed it would probably have the best idea of what side effects a cat might see."
AskVet,3cqnlj,DrDead88,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:35:12 2015 UTC,When I asked about side effects I was told 'we haven't really seen any' but they don't prescribe it a lot for cats at that clinic so I thought I'd ask for input from other vets who might have experience with it.
AskVet,3cqnlj,Tobimaru,3,Fri Jul 10 00:43:21 2015 UTC,"Just an FYI, it's spelled carprofen.   Carprofen is a NSAID (non-steroidal anti inflammatory drug), the same drug class that ibuprofen and aspirin belong to. In general, the most common side effects to monitor for include GI upset (vomiting, diarrhea (with or without blood for each), lethargy inappetence, etc), kidney associated issues (sudden increases in thirst and urination), and, rarely, liver toxicity (typically reversible if therapy is discontinued, would likely manifest similar to GI upset, but this is more ""common"" in dogs than cats). If you ever become concerned, just give your vet a call.   Hopefully you're able to get your cat's arthritis managed- it's unfortunately an under diagnosed condition in cats, and doesn't have as much research/interest as arthritis in dogs does. (I'm only aware of 1 or 2 studies at a certain vet school currently, vs a vast multitude of arthritis studies in dogs across the US).   Edit: As has been pointed out, Cartrophen is it's own, separate medication. Probably obvious to all the non-US users here. My mistake!"

AskVet,3cnvkq,nsfw9gag,11,Thu Jul 9 10:47:50 2015 UTC,"The crying is concerning and most likely a sign of discomfort and/or hunger and thirst. At this point, your best bet is to also take the kitten to the vet, because they can deteriorate fast.  Also, stop using diluted milk and get yourself some kitten milk replacement formula from your vet or pet store. At this age, you will need to feed him every 2-3 hours around the clock, and stimulate his anogenital region with a wet cloth after feeding to cause micturation and defecation, which are still reflexes at this point. Be sure to weigh the kitten twice a day and keep track of its weight in order to catch potential issues early."

AskVet,3cnvkq,CoopertheBKE,2,Thu Jul 9 12:50:02 2015 UTC,You should also put a heating pad under the box or under some blankets.  Kittens that age will not be able to stay warm enough.
AskVet,3cnvkq,Heidibearr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:03:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's probably because of hunger or thirst. I would take a warm wet cloth and gently rub its behind to stimulate it to use the bathroom. I would definitely put a heating pad or something with it as well. Kittens need be kept very very warm since they chill easily   Edit: also, definitely no cows milk!! That could cause huge problems! Go to your local Walmart and/or vet and buy a can or milk replacement and mix with warm water! It's very cheap"
AskVet,3cnvkq,Brit-nay-nay,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:47:45 2015 UTC,"I raised two kittens from the day they were born ( mother abandoned them since they were ill) I wiped their butt gently with a warm wet cloth until they went to the bathroom..... I used KMR to feed them. Don't let the kitten eat on it's back! It has to be laying basically on it's stomach (Picture how it would nurse on a mother cat.) Don't force feed the cat.... If it can't swallow it in time when you keep feeding it could breathe in the milk and cause pneumonia ( My Kittens were hospitalized for a month for pneumonia, one passed in the hospital). Try to get it to taste the milk first. They make special bottles for feeding and they work well if the kitten can grasp the concept of it, one out of the two I had didn't understand it as well and she had a difficult time. You may have to poke a hole in the top. They don't all come with holes in them. I also had a heating blanket that evenly distributed the heat so they were comfortable. make sure its not too hot. The vet is a must! My babies were at one every other day (before hospitalization)....... Do what you can for them. If you plan on keeping this kitten it will create a great bond between you two. Talk to the doctor about life expectancy if you'd like. My kitten's lifespan was supposed to be only two years. she passed last year a bit before her 2nd birthday. I hope everything works out well for you and your kitten! Best of luck!   Edit: I don't know how close you are to the shed but maybe if you keep a look out you can find mom cat."

AskVet,3cpeg1,lampshade9909,2,Thu Jul 9 18:32:17 2015 UTC,"Has your vet (past or current) been consulted about this since it has become worse? While some diagnostics are expensive, I would highly recommend at least a radiograph to get an idea of what is going on, especially because it is persistent and worsening.   In general, there are other pain medications available, but we can not (and should not) suggest specific medications without having done a complete physical exam. This would again be a question for whatever vet you are seeing now."

For example, it could be bone, muscle, nerve, something else?    Last time we talked to our vet about the problems getting worse he just gave us more pain medication because we didn't push to do tests(then we moved to another state so now we have a new vet).  What's a cost range for a radiography exam?  We live in a high cost of living area and are considering finding a vet that's cheaper even if we have to drive an extra 20-30 minutes."
AskVet,3cpeg1,DrDead88,2,Thu Jul 9 21:08:07 2015 UTC,"Price really varies from clinic to clinic, region to region. In my area, it's around $200-$300 for your standard 2 view study.  As far s meds gp, they're are some that are better for nerve pain, some that do inflammation really well, etc. Discuss that you don't feel the current meds are sufficient, and they may feel a different one is indicated."

AskVet,3cnh9t,Urgullibl,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:33:47 2015 UTC,"If she checks out fine after the vet visit, and you use a lidded litter box or that domed one, try a rectangular litter box with no lid and see if that works.  What kind of litter are you using, where is the box positioned, and what's around the litter box area?  Do you have other cats?  I have had two female cats that have urinated outside of the litter boxes.  One had a urinary infection and calcification of her kidney's.  She was able to use the boxes again after antibiotics and I also started using lower rectangular litter boxes and more of them around the apartment.  It was not pretty to look at them all around, but it did work and she did use them.  Slowly every week or two, I took an extra box away, and she adapted to using the remaining ones.  She ended up having kidney failure about three years later and I had to put her to sleep.  I discovered that my other female cat had no medical problems, but she was urinating outside of the box because I had lidded boxes at the time, and a new male cat I had taken in was bullying her when she went to use them.  I took the lids off all the boxes and repositioned one of them for her (so she would not be cornered in and had other ways out), and she started using them again.  So rule out the medical first, and then there's ways to treat the behavioral.  Jackson Galaxy has some good tips for dealing with the behavior litter box issues."

I've never seen any shaking related to steroid usage. Shaking/trembling is unfortunately a very nonspecific sign- it could mean she's cold (unlikely given the season), has discomfort, is anxious, etc. You can always call her vet to discuss the symptom, if you're worried (they may recommend an exam).   The one thing that does concern me is the recently finished bottle- was she meant to be on a long term dose (as in, she needs a refill) or was she slowly tapered off of the medication? If she has effectively quit cold turkey, I would definitely call her vet and discuss it, as this can lead to an Addisonian Crisis (essentially the adrenals stop producing their own steroids since it's being supplemented. Stop suddenly, and the adrenals take a little while to resume production). If you notice any lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, etc, this would be an emergency situation."

AskVet,3clgzy,stealyourfacebook,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:48:20 2015 UTC,"You mentioned possible prostate issues. An infection in/around the prostate (or a swollen prostate in general) can make it difficult to pass urine as well as bowel movements. Prostate swelling/inflammation and infection can push against the urethra at one site while adding pressure against the colon from another; until this abnormality is corrected, problems may persist.  Still, as your veterinarian suggested, this could simply be your dog's unique response to surgery, treatment & medication at the end of a particularly rough year. It might go away on its own, or even hours after the antibiotics run out. It is also possible that your dog will present this way for the rest of his life. However, I feel it might be in the best interest of your dog to seek a second professional opinion at another vet facility, or at least make sure you feel you've been offered you a full range of options in terms of exploratory efforts. Another doctor responded to your post asking about X-Rays and an ultrasound. Hopefully these have been offered to you?"

It was an eye-opener for me, as I always assumed it was like ""he has this kind of bacteria, so this is the antibiotic that will kill it."" Clearly it isn't as simple as that. The prostate idea only came up because it didn't seem like the bladder focused antibiotics were doing the job. So his vet thought the infection might be in the prostate, or in the prostate as well, and therefore he needed an antibiotic that could penetrate there. He has seen improvement on those pills as far as his overall health/happiness, but it's been very slow going with these spasming symptoms.   or even hours after the antibiotics run out.   I'm curious about this. Did you suggest this because it could be the antibiotics themselves that are causing the symptoms?"

If your turtle diet is commercially available pellets supplemented with fresh insects, fish and veggies, vitamin issues is way down the list.  Higher up the list would be injury and infection.  Upper respiratory infections in reptiles can become apparent when the eyes or ears become swollen.  Best to call the vet and make an appointment, double check the date of manufacture on your UV light as well as primary food (both should be within the last 6 months) and make sure you keep the tank clean.  Frequent, sometimes daily water changes are vital to helping sick water turtles recover.    Expect your vet to perform a complete exam, ask you detailed questions about duration and husbandry as well as check the eyes for injury.  If both eyes are swollen, that is more suspicious for a systemic issue which may need to be treated with injectable antibiotics, daily water changes and possibly blood work to ensure other organs are not being affected."

AskVet,3cfq81,veeone,3,Tue Jul 7 15:44:34 2015 UTC,"Current FDA approved dosage is 5.5-33 mg/kg PO q12h. With that said, you need to hear the words from your veterinarian's mouth. We cannot tell you whether or not this dose is appropriate.  Also, as /u/ironmouse pointed out, it is really a bad idea to medicate your animal without consulting a veterinarian. Remember the limitations of your training and experience; being a pharmacist gives you great deal of knowledge, but treating animals is not your expertise. Attempting to do so can have catastrophic results."
AskVet,3cfq81,Dr_Shitlord_DVM,4,Tue Jul 7 17:49:48 2015 UTC,"One client once told me she was a nurse so she knew ""just enough for it to be dangerous"". I loved that."

AskVet,3cfq81,ironmouse,6,Tue Jul 7 15:51:23 2015 UTC,"Going to echo the other people here. I don't know what scope of training human pharmacists receive, but you should really know better than to just give a random antibiotic for a couple of days before switching to another one. Congratulations, you've just selected for resistant bacteria!   I know you don't prescribe meds, but don't they teach you that in school? Would you recommend I take some clavamox I have lying around for an open wound until I could be bothered to get in to see a doctor and be prescribed the correct drug?  Please don't do that again. It seriously irritates me when people with human medical training try this shit. FYI - Did you know that human formulations of amoxi-clav have different ratios of the drug than the vet formulations do? Vet formulations are 4:1, and yours is 7:1. I'm not impressed by the ""this sounds good"" school of drug choice that is being displayed here.  Also, Merck is not a formulary. The approved dose range for clindamycin is 5-33 mg/kg PO, BID. So the acceptable range for your dog is anywhere from 140-924 mg per dose.   So, in summation, I'm not sure how ""I'm a pharmacist"" translates to ""I know how to prescribe drugs to a dog,"" but cut that shit out. Based on what you did, I wouldn't trust you to even prescribe me human meds unless I wanted some sort of super-bug. Trying to be informed about a pet's treatment is fine, but calling the vet and insinuating that they gave the wrong dose because Google said so/I give drugs to people/I'm a nurse/whatever is silly.  EDIT: This may come across a bit harsh, but veterinarians get stuff like this all the time and it gets extremely tiresome."
AskVet,3cfq81,misssy,-2,Wed Jul 8 04:34:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies!  I knew I would catch flak for medicating without a vet. In my defense it was holiday weekend, I was working all weekend, and I live in a fairly rural area. The dog is actually my parents' dog (left that out because it's not relevant to the question) and they have very little money, so I took her to the vet for them when I was off (Monday). I was also taking advice from a close family friend who has veterinary experience as well as experience with similar wounds on his dogs he uses for hog hunting. The antibiotic was left over from 2 months ago when my dad had a reaction to it, and had to start a different med. I figured 2 days of antibiotics might give her a better chance than leaving her with no coverage. Only explaining this to show that I did put a lot of thought into whether or not to give something to her. I agree with you both, normally I take my pets to the vet because I lack appropriate expertise in diagnosis/treatment, especially in animals.   I am aware of the gap in my knowledge for animals (1 vet class in school does not cover a whole lot), and I am taking this as an opportunity to learn about better resources than what I know.   The office refused to ask the dvm, and just told me to follow the label. I know errors occur, and I also know that the range is most likely larger than 5 to 10 mg/kg BID. I just asked the question to see what other resources are out there that vets reference to make me feel better giving her a seemingly high dose."

It took a long time to heal from the inside out - about 3 weeks total. Hopefully you can achieve that without your dog needing surgery.  It's such a difficult injury because you have to keep them off their feet as much as possible and stop them running or jumping. All the fun things that a young lab lives for of course!   Not sure it is realistic to tire them out while on such restricted activity but you can at least keep their spirits up. We bought a ton of different chew toys - split antlers, water buffalo horn, yakmilk cheese chews, nylabones - we called it the chewie buffet. I would also hide treats in socks, and play gentle tug of war when she was lying down. There was a lot of floor time together which she enjoyed.

If he's still obstructed, the prognosis is very poor. Even if he was unobstructed, the prognosis isn't that great, as a good portion of cats will re-obstruct.  It is possible that he will respond well to the medical therapy, and my fingers are definitely crossed. Try and make as many environmental changes as possible (check here), to potentially reduce any stress component to his blockage."

We were so shell shocked from the initial prognosis that we didn't ask enough questions, and now I'm sitting here wondering if we're going to come home to a dead cat before too long, and feeling absolutely terrible."
AskVet,3cci8x,DrDead88,13,Mon Jul 6 22:03:56 2015 UTC,"If he doesn't unobstruct with the aid of the medications, you will be in another emergency situation within the next day or so, once the bladder fills up again. There are options like Care Credit (essentially just a credit card) or looking for rescue organizations, but those may not be available/useful for everyone.   Unfortunately, if finances do not allow full treatment, euthanasia may be the most humane option- dying of a ruptured bladder is a horrible way to go. I know it hurts to say goodbye, but watching through the suffering is worse."

I used Care Credit, and was approved for a credit limit higher than $4,000 with having good but not an excellent FICO score. Payments are interest free for a year. OP, I would suggest looking into Care Credit if you can. But I also agree with the person above me - if finances don't allow, euthanasia is more humane than to let him suffer."
AskVet,3cci8x,SirSassyPants,8,Tue Jul 7 02:34:40 2015 UTC,"Urinary blockage is a major medical issue. There is a possibility of your cat surviving without removal of the blockage. If the blockage is still in the urethra then he may re-block and you'll be back at square one.  Have you tried calling clinics in your area (separate from ER) to see if anyone would take a look at him and try to unblock him for less money?  Sometimes sedating and using a urinary catheter to push the blockage back into the bladder can be done with success. This procedure could at least clear his urethra so he can urinate on his own. Of course- they will suggest that he is kept for at least one or more nights w/ IV fluids to re-hydrate him and to keep the urinary cath in place to help his bladder flush out. That is the best medicine. May not be affordable for you though. You'll need to be up front about how much you can pay for and I'm sure they can work with you.  I really think you should call some regular vets. And/or look into care credit. 4 years old is still very young and cats can live great, very normal lives after blocking."

Personally, while I may be able to buy into the proposed mechanism of action, the actual clinical, proven efficacy is severely lacking. All I could find just now is a bunch of dentistry related studies, and a single study on time to ambulation post-hemilaminectomy (surgical procedure for herniated discs). Another other ""evidence"" is simply anecdotes reported by owners and clinicians who really want the modality to work. Unfortunately, the placebo effect is very real in veterinary medicine.

AskVet,3ccp1a,shitidneversay,2,Tue Jul 7 00:21:52 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a sample bag that they would have sent home. I cannot speak for other prescription diets, but Hills has been giving a lot of the 2lb bags of prescription food to animal hospitals and clinics to send home with clients whose pets need to be on special diets. They typically last a few days, long enough to determine that the pet will actually eat it. It sucks to buy a larger bag and find out that the pet is completely disinterested in the new food.   I know that owners do not always know the questions that they need to ask until after they have left their vet's office. However, vets do not alwlays realize that you are walking away without fully understanding why you are going home with certain meds or foods or even what the plan is going forward. This falls to you to make sure that you are not leaving the appointment with any confusion, any questions about what was said, or any concerns about the recommendations that the vet gave you.  At this point, I would recommend scheduling a follow up with your vet as soon as you are able to snag an appointment. Discuss your experience with the prescription food and that you are interested in switching her over to that. Let the vet know that the meds helped while your pup was on it but the diarrhea returned after those and the food were discontinued.  Unfortunately, some things are not an easy fix (as I am sure you are well aware of) and require further diagnostics and seeing what works best for your pet.   Tried grain free food, tried iams, blue buffalo, pedigree   That is quite a bit of change through foods for an 8 month old, especially since you mentioned that there has not been a diet change in the last four months.

She also receives supplements (all but the supplement treats are mixed into the food), and I add water to every single meal.   8am: 1/3 can of food + Fortiflora probiotic and 1/8 tsp of fiber 2pm: 1/4 can of food + 1 Cosequin capsule and 2 In Clover Flow UT health treats 8pm: 1/3 can of food + 0.75ml of Nordic Naturals Omega-3 supplement and 1/8 tsp of fiber 2am: 1/4 can of food + 2 In Clover Spry Respiratory L-Lysine treats   As I mentioned in my post, I did increase her fiber so for the past day and a half she's been getting 1/8 tsp of fiber in every meal instead of just twice a day. She also normally gets 1 Vetri-Science hairball treat, but I temporarily stopped that while she's having the soft stools.  Also, she's been on several different brands of wet food in the past and the constipation was no different."
AskVet,3cd2gb,Yamochao,4,Mon Jul 6 23:37:37 2015 UTC,"No one can make that call for you or your family, and I'm sorry that you're all going through this. It is possible that she will respond to treatment, and there isn't anything wrong with trying, as long as she's kept comfortable during the treatment.   One thing you can do is to discuss end of life decisions with your family- what activities or daily routines do you and your family consider integral to her well being and quality of life, and how many of these does she need to still exhibit to be considered a good quality of life. I think as long as your can establish these guidelines, and apply them, you can hopefully ensure she isn't suffering, and maintains a good QoL."

AskVet,3ccyc2,JAWJAWBINX,3,Mon Jul 6 23:04:34 2015 UTC,You need to follow up with your vet to determine is this is related to the tumor or not.

AskVet,3ccyc2,littleredoptimist,3,Mon Jul 6 23:17:46 2015 UTC,"Go to a new vet. Just because the patient is old, doesn't mean you should be denied answers or care."

AskVet,3ccyc2,littleredoptimist,3,Mon Jul 6 23:46:12 2015 UTC,"Oh ok, that makes more sense. Either way, your dog has to eat. Maybe your vet can give you anti-nausea medication and steroids to hopefully get him to eat a little. This is of course a temporary plan, but during this time you can make the dog a little more comfortable while deciding what the best option is when it comes to quality of life for him."
AskVet,3ccyc2,littleredoptimist,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:55:52 2015 UTC,He's been on steroids for awhile and we're weaning him off of them so I don't think that's an option.
AskVet,3ccyc2,ironmouse,2,Tue Jul 7 00:01:25 2015 UTC,"Might be a reason he won't eat now. Sorry about your situation. The only other advice I can offer (which you may have already tried) is giving him food he would want to eat the most, like chicken or something similar. It's better than nothing. It seems that a treatment plan is not really an option in this situation for you, so it may be best to talk to your vet about euthanasia if he continues to vomit and refuse food. Unfortunately, this is the worst part about being a pet owner."
AskVet,3ccyc2,ironmouse,2,Tue Jul 7 00:12:12 2015 UTC,That's how we give him meds and he wouldn't eat. His vet just got in touch with us and is thinking of putting him back on 5mg for the steroids and adding something for nausea as you suggested. I'm kind of just hoping he'll make it through the summer.
AskVet,3ccyc2,ironmouse,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:39:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I understand. I lost a pet a few months ago due to old age and a tumor. We chose to euthanize in the end, because we felt a little selfish keeping her around when she really was ready to go. For us, steroids were just a way of prolonging the inevitable. I did not want the responsibility of choosing that option, but it was even harder watching her suffer. Don't feel guilty about it and give him lots of extra love for as long as you've got him."

AskVet,3cbycg,Chillmoons,3,Mon Jul 6 18:48:27 2015 UTC,That's not something we can diagnose or recommend treatments for online.  He should be rechecked by the vet.
AskVet,3cbycg,goatsickle,3,Mon Jul 6 21:24:30 2015 UTC,"I would get him rechecked. Pretty hard to say for sure what could be going on. Could be a torn off nail. Fungal infection. If he has re-occurring issues with the dewclaws it may be worth while to discuss having them removed surgically.  Is he licking at the dewclaw at all? If so, he needs a cone or you need to put a sock over the dewclaw. Letting dogs lick at their wounds is never good- only leads to infection."
AskVet,3cbycg,SirSassyPants,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:41:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response! This is the first issue he's had with the dew claw. I'm figuring the nail was torn from the bed maybe since it seems to not be growing, or growing back very slowly.   I have it loosely wrapped with a sterile bandage so he doesn't lick it and it doesn't get dirty when we go outside. The area is clean and does not hurt him when I clean it or apply the bandage.  I'm going to call and make a vet appointment today. Thanks again!"
AskVet,3cbqpi,Stiffstick,6,Mon Jul 6 17:54:55 2015 UTC,"More diagnostics/discussion with the vet needs to happen if you've only had him tested for a UTI. Also, 175lbs is huge for a dalmatian."

AskVet,3cbh1r,johnspartan15,3,Mon Jul 6 16:44:04 2015 UTC,"Nope, unrelated.   The tooth will have to be extracted."
AskVet,3cbh1r,skipsteejsprat,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:55:10 2015 UTC,Thanks. My thought was that the pain from the tooth made him start the itching of the area that eventually led to the hot spot forming.
AskVet,3cbh1r,skipsteejsprat,2,Mon Jul 6 17:09:05 2015 UTC,"Ah, I would doubt that's the case.  Rotten teeth can cause them to rub their faces, but not scratch.  Scratching would probably hurt.  Hot spots at usually due to some allergy that triggers intense itching."
AskVet,3cbh1r,whatamoppet,3,Mon Jul 6 17:12:26 2015 UTC,"Hot spots on the face can be caused by ear infections; the itch is super far down the ear canal so they rub over the itch,  hence breaking the skin on the face rather than itching the ear itself. As /u/skipsteejsprat said an allergy or stong etc is usually the main culprit though.   Irrespective the rotten tooth needs to come out. Dogs and cats are brave but that will be very painful."
AskVet,3c9p6s,1needtoknow,5,Mon Jul 6 04:51:21 2015 UTC,"There isn't a kitten too small for SQ fluids, but people with less newborn experience tend to be more gun shy about fluids and fluid administration, so you may want to advocate for yourself by getting some resources on neonatal medicine or asking if there is a vet more versed in neonate care. I've given fluids to 3 day olds and they're perfectly capable of absorbing them. You can easily learn to do them at home with a small syringe and butterfly needle. It's important to make sure the fluids are always at body temp before giving.  You started at a disadvantage, and it can be hard to keep them alive when you start with a kitten that's doing poorly.  I would advise having a vet deworm the next kitten as soon as you get it and then repeating 2 weeks later. Other than that, just keeping the nest/carrier consistently warm. Snugglesafe heat pads are awesome for this.  My best reassurance is that animals have litters because they have a high mortality rate. Your survival rate will always be better than that of a completely feral cat. Found single kittens are sometimes the ones that the mother cat ditched because she saw that they weren't thriving and was minimizing loss and diverting her limited milk & care to the other kittens.  Another important note is to never offer food to a kitten when the temp is low (under 98-99). Monitor temperature closely when warming and stop aggressively warming when they hit 98 because kittens aren't able to stop themselves from overheating and can easily overshoot their temp. If you notice a fever in a kitten, don't actively try to bring their fever down and just pack them up and go to the vet."
AskVet,3c9p6s,jadedgoldfish,2,Mon Jul 6 09:03:48 2015 UTC,Why shouldn't you offer food when the temp is low?
AskVet,3c9p6s,always_onward,3,Mon Jul 6 12:26:09 2015 UTC,"Hypothermia causes gut stasis and the GI tract completely shuts down, especially in neonates. Not moving the formula along will often cause regurgitation. Because they're tiny and already weak, they're at a huge risk of aspiration. It can worsen the severity of shock and adds undue burden, even in absense of regurg. Transmucosal sugar (destrose/honey/karo) has a decreased absorption at low temps, but is still a net positive if hypoglycemia is an issue (which it almost always is)."
AskVet,3c9p6s,jadedgoldfish,2,Mon Jul 6 14:27:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! Neonatal medicine is one of my weak points, so that's great to learn."
AskVet,3c9p6s,always_onward,3,Tue Jul 7 00:38:40 2015 UTC,"The other huge, important thing to know are that neonates have a massive fluid requirement and to always get a thorough history of basic care. If you calculate IVF at 40-60 ml/kg/day, you're already causing dehydration. Basic maintenance is 130-220 ml/kg/day, depending on age, before adjusting for dehydration deficits and ongoing losses. My best advice is to get a good, recent textbook on neonates and refer to it often.  I spent 5 years as an rvt in shelter medicine, so neonatal medicine is one of my strengths. Now that I'm over in emergency, I find it jarring how a basic foundation of neonatology is never taught. I am fortunate enough to have great doctors that trust my knowledge to help steer them in the right direction. We had one yesterday that presented for a single episode of vomiting and increased respiratory effort afterward. The doctor looks at the kitten and can't find anything overtly currently wrong. Thanks to having to teach foster parents how to bottle for years, I know to ask the client to demonstrate how they bottle when getting the history. They immediately flip the kitten on its back, like a human baby, to bottle. Husbandry questions help catch the aspiration pneumonia that isnt clinical today but would be a deceased kitten in 2 days."
AskVet,3c9p6s,jadedgoldfish,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:00:28 2015 UTC,Is there any preference in the type of sugar to use to keep their blood sugar stable? I was told previously that the nutrical was given for this purpose.
AskVet,3c9p6s,jadedgoldfish,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:04:54 2015 UTC,"I can probably count on one hand how many times I've given nutrical to a kitten in the last 10 years. I'll give it to older cats to help bolster caloric intake, but weaned kittens should generally be doing ok with freely fed kibble and wet food 2-3 times a day to encourage intake if they're not eating the kibble fantastically. If their blood sugar is crashing, I use dextrose or karo, depending on what's most readily available. I don't supplement sugar other than if they're dumpy. If you're doing a lot of kitten rescue, glucometers are relatively inexpensive and easy to use. You can talk to your vet about ordering an accucheck that is calibrated for cats if you're going to have a lot of newborns around.  All in all, I'd say it's rarely a bad idea to give a little bit of karo to a kitten that is flat."
AskVet,3c9p6s,Heidibearr,2,Tue Jul 7 02:22:48 2015 UTC,I helped raise kittens around the same age a couple Of months ago and the same thing happened to me. One of the kittens temperatures kept dropping and by the end of the day passed away despite all my efforts to save him. I'm not a doctor but I don't think there is anything you could have done. Sometimes these things just happen and they are not at all your fault. There are many reasons that this kitten could have passed and you did all you could do by taking him to the vet.
AskVet,3calfp,poptarts2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:10:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not a vet, and I would advise you to take him to see one. Puppies should not be losing weight. Consistent diarrhoea and weight loss could be linked to anything! Considering he was a stray, it could be a foreign object in his intestines, or it could be parasites, or it could be an allergy to the food you're giving him. It really could be anything! He needs to be examined by a vet. They should be able to advise you on allergy tests they can perform and test his stool for anything that might be causing the tummy upset. Considering the weight loss, don't delay getting him to a vet and bring a recent stool sample with you."
AskVet,3calfp,Durshka,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:48:00 2015 UTC,"He's had a stool sample, and nothing came up :(.  The vet advised allergy testing, but they also said that we could do an elimination diet to identify any dietary allergies."
AskVet,3calfp,super_cheeky,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:53:39 2015 UTC,"It does sound like his inability to digest and skin inflammation both could be linked to allergies, both to food and environmentally. My dog is allergic to grass and always gets a rash on her belly after laying in it all day. She also was allergic to chicken and had chronic diarrhea for about 2 months until I switched her food to a limited ingredient fish and potato base. Like Durshka said—definitely take him to the vet.

She recommended an X-Ray to be absolutely sure, other wise it was just shot in the dark. The cost of the emergency examination PLUS Xray and everything else afterwards was too much, so we were referred to a cheaper hospital. We left after giving her an IV for dehydration and anti neausa medicine. By the time we left it was 3am so the recommended vet was closed.   During the rest of the night her condition didn't change much except for her not throwing up anymore. At one point I fell asleep and when I woke up she was dead laying by my feet. Her body was stiff.   I'm angry at myself for not at least being awake to help her or know that she left us."
AskVet,3c9w6a,westizcoastin,5,Mon Jul 6 06:13:34 2015 UTC,"I think you may be getting ahead of yourself- has she seen a vet at all to diagnose this as hip dysplasia, or have you been letting her limp around in pain for 2 months under the assumption that all hind limb issues are hip dysplasia?  If you have a diagnosis, then yes, Care Credit is one option. Otherwise, borrowing from friends or family is another."
AskVet,3c9w6a,DrDead88,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:15:25 2015 UTC,"The vet suggested it was hip dysplasia before, now she's physically unable to even get up on her own."

AskVet,3c9w6a,JessaFace,0,Mon Jul 6 15:04:24 2015 UTC,She hasn't been diagnosed yet. But almost every insurance I've found has a 6 month waiting period on these types of conditions before coverage will help or they require a physical after enrolling (which they will find the problem and deny coverage).  I found a perfect coverage with BestFriends Animal Insurance which seems to be connected to the BestFriends Animal Shelter however the phone numbers and Emails don't work. I just need a insurance that will allow her to begin coverage immediately.
AskVet,3c9w6a,ironmouse,5,Mon Jul 6 15:42:11 2015 UTC,"Seconding the Care Credit.  You HAVE to read the fine print on these insurance policies: many of them won't cover preexisting conditions and want a thorough recent exam submitted before coverage begins - as this is an issue before applying for coverage, this would be be considered preexisting. Some are finicky about congenital and hereditary conditions.  Does your pup have a familial history of hip dysplasia? If that's the case, I have to be blunt: you should have begun worrying about this before it were an issue. If not or unsure, a ""bump on the hip"" doesn't scream dysplasia diagnosis.   Regardless, it needs to be assessed by a veterinarian ASAP. If she's not weight-bearing, it hurts. You wouldn't allow your child to continue in pain, nor would you be thrilled about a caretaker allowing you to be in pain. A veterinarian can provide you with an accurate diagnosis and your treatment options."

AskVet,3c9w6a,JessaFace,4,Mon Jul 6 14:21:18 2015 UTC,"Not singling you out, but this is a prime example of why people really need to put more thought into pet finances before acquiring animals. Way too many people assume things are perfect until some magical number of years by which time they will hopefully have more funds for pet care."
AskVet,3c9w6a,Tamponexorcism,-6,Mon Jul 6 17:04:45 2015 UTC,"Or perhaps Pet Care shouldn't be more expensive than caring for humans.  I got health insurance 6 months ago for $39 a month, last month i had septoplasty surgery and it costed me $400, this was a pre-exsisting condition i've had for years as well. Now they are expecting me to pay $4,000-7,000 to help my pet? That's ridiculous. Even if I got pet insurance the day i got her it would only just be usable a few months back.  Without a previous diagnoses I'm just looking for pet insurance that has a short-term wait time on surgeries such as these. I found one called BestFriends but their phone numbers dont work and the Email under 'Contact Us' is expired."
AskVet,3c9w6a,DrDead88,3,Mon Jul 6 21:33:50 2015 UTC,"You're comparing apple to oranges.  I'm making assumptions here, but correct me if I'm wrong.  You're likely making close to or below the poverty line.  Which means you are getting heavily discounted/subsidized health insurance.  I am ~$175,000 in debt from school.  I make a middle class income.  The govt doesn't care about my student loan debt.  A middle of the road health insurance plan for me costs $300 a month through the national health insurance marketplace.  I am young and healthy.  That plan included a $5000 out of pocket max/year.  So lets say I had it for one year and needed what you had and be nice about out of pocket costs.  300x12 + 2,500 out of pocket = $6100.  Someone is paying for your cheap surgery.  It just isn't you.  So when you wonder why vet medicine is expensive compared to human medicine, it is because you aren't comparing costs in the right context.  Animals are a luxury that I wish more could afford, but by no means is animal ownership something that should be taken lightly."
AskVet,3c9w6a,Tamponexorcism,3,Mon Jul 6 22:50:00 2015 UTC,"/u/ironmouse is correct, your comparison is inaccurate. While pet care definitely isn't as cheap as years ago, it really is leagues cheaper that human medical care.   Per BusinessInsider's breakdown of what qualifies as ""middle class"" in each state, I fall below the middle class line yet make more than allowed for any sort of financial assistance with healthcare. I /wish/ my monthly insurance rate was $39 - the best I could ask for from Healthcare.gov was $130/month for a single, mid/late-20's female with only minor health concerns (migraines) and no familiar history of health concerns.   If you're quoting $400 for septoplasty, you didn't look over your total bill and potential insurance coverage/assistance. A quick Google search for US medical bills hosts hundreds of insane costs for surgeries. Here on Reddit, some gentleman posted his $55,000 bill for an appendectomy. Only last year, I went to the ER for 24 hours of migraine-induced, unrelenting vomiting. Bill summary: CBC/chemistry blood planel, urinalysis, IV catheter placement, one liter of IV fluids, an injectable antiemetic, and an injectable painkiller. Bill total after insurance adjustment: $2,000. (Bill total before: >$5,000.)   As often as I go over estimates in the emergency veterinary setting, I can assure you that the same services for your pet do not financially compare.   Honestly, you need to stop focusing on pet insurance at this point - that's a decision that should have already been made and, for this instance specifically, the train has already left the station. (It's still reasonable for future use, just not the hips at this point.)  Here is a link  to the ASPCA'S financial assistance page. Look it over. It has both national and state-specific organizations to assist pet owners with medical, surgical, and medication costs."

Hopefully since you've been home you've watched a/o found evidence of both urination and defecation. If he isn't doing these things reasonably frequently you may be in some trouble for obvious reasons.  To ease your mind for tonight: pets, both dogs and cats, behaviors can change dramatically when their owners are away, especially for extended periods of time. It can actually be a major cause of stress. Physiologically speaking, when stressed, function of the digestive system and kidneys goes down significantly. This means less intake of food and water, and less defecation/urination."

If you've still got several hours of driving to do, I'd look for one where you are and book into the hotel for a second night. I wouldn't risk making him worse by cooping him up in a car when he's sick. It could be any number of things, but keeping him in one place for a day will be better for him than driving for several hours.  TL;DR: look for a vet where you are right now."
AskVet,3c98hz,wildjohnson,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:42:31 2015 UTC,"Well he drank late last night and held it down and almost a bowl full this morning and I waited several hours before deciding to head on the road with him.  His mood was good.  He didn't eat but my dogs rarely do in the morning.  This afternoon he was fine.  Playing, drinking, urinating normally.    I decided to do with him what I used to do with my shih tzu with the sensitive tummy and give him a handful of Cheerios to jump start his appetite.  He ate them.  And then he threw them up.  :/  I called the vet and filled them in.  They seem to think he can wait until the morning given his mood and being able to keep down water, if not food.    He is still not dehydrated.   I'm laying here now googling Parvo and Intestinal Obstruction.  The internet is not our friend in medical situations."

If they say no, I tell them they should get the dog a new home.  In my experience 50% of the IG's I see within my hospital break their R/U in their life.  And half of those break it in both legs.  It is a side effect of creating the breed."
AskVet,3c81gd,ironmouse,3,Sun Jul 5 20:13:20 2015 UTC,"When I do home visits for people consider adopting I always bring the stack of vet bills from my two (one lived 16.5 years and the other 17 years). Totals over $40,000 for the two of them over their lifetimes for vet care alone. Includes fixing one broken leg and one angular limb deformity, lymphoma, congestive heart failure, polycystic kidney disease, and a liver disorder. They were rescue dogs and had their share of issues.   I'm amazed at how few people even hear me. They shrug it off like I just got unlucky.   When we deny someone they always make up some reason (we don't usually say why) like ""they denied us because we're in the military"" or ""they denied us because we have young kids"" when in reality it's more likely that we denied them because they live with their parents because they're unable to afford  place of their own and they argued that the $300 adoption fee was unaffordable for them so we should lower it.   If you can't afford the fee you sure as hell can't afford the Italian Greyhound.   The good news is there are breeders working on the leg problem. An IG with nice stocky legs just won BOB at a local show. The good breeders are well aware of the problem and breed for stronger legs. Too bad most breeders aren't good breeders. They really can't keep up with the puppy mills."

This is a question you can and should also be asking your vet - your vet will have done an exam on your cat and can speak to any specific needs she may have. In the same vein, I also highly recommend that you get her spayed--there's no reason for a cat not to be spayed, and frankly the world doesn't need any more kittens...I know you didn't ask about this, but in a veterinary forum it's unlikely that this piece of advice won't be brought up :P  As far as brands, there is no single best brand. There are so many, and ""the best"" for one person and their pet(s) may be absolute rubbish in someone else's opinion. So, a good way to start is to figure out what your cat needs nutritionally using information written by informed professionals (I'd avoid anecdotal stuff) and chat with your vet, and then find a few brands that make diets with the necessary nutrition. Then it's up to you to choose amongst these brands based on affordability, palatability for your cat, type of ingredients (local, organic, ""natural), etc.  Good luck!"

AskVet,3c4g95,lindygrey,9,Sat Jul 4 18:07:49 2015 UTC,"A lot of it probably is due to the paperwork. Tramadol just recently (about a year ago now?) became a scheduled drug by the FDA, so before then, the paperwork was minimal. That, and tramadol has few side effects (unless you count not working as a side effect), so it is well tolerated, on top of being cheap, and pretty easy to dose any size dog (vs say gabapentin, which smaller dogs and cats would need compounding to get an accurate dose).   As far as the pain management goes, there's almost a civil war going on regarding tramadol in the vet field. The pharmacological data shows that the drug is not metabolized in dogs the same way it is in people, and dogs get minimal exposure to what are considered the active metabolites. Granted, we're starting to discover that small studies using only beagles or hounds aren't representative of the entire population , but the PK behind tramadol is shaky at best. Unfortunately, anecdotes carry a lot of weight, to both vets and owners alike, so the proponents of tramadol point at all of their cases where it works. Another important factor to note is that metabolism of tramadol actually increases by 450% after 7 days of continued dosing- so even dogs that may have actually seen efficacy are likely to stop seeing it after a week. (unfortunately, this data is currently unpublished). This is in addition to the fact that there's a strong placebo effect in owners (we've had to create new study designs just to test pain drugs and get reliable owner-reported results). Edit to add: Another factor against tramadol is the dosing schedule- the PK data suggests that dosing should be as often as 4 times a day, and at relatively high dosages, which isn't what typically happens.   Anyway, that's a lot of slamming of tramadol, and I never make friends when I go on about it. I will say in refractory, chronic pain, I'll try it (it can't hurt, and I'm desperate). It's just not a drug I go to first, since the evidence, IMO, doesn't support it being a first line drug. I'm personally a bigger fan of gabapentin (some evidence, though no robust clinical trial) and amantadine (which has been shown to be beneficial when combined with an NSAID for OA pain). There are other, new, exciting drugs out there, but they've been minimally evaluated for the most part.   As far as the opioids go, they're fairly short acting when given IV or IM- we're talking hours for the most part (some longer than others, but still just hours). Oral opioids are notorious for having poor oral bioavailability (they aren't absorbed well or the liver renders most of the drug inactive before it can circulate) in dogs, which hampers their efficacy further. Opioids are wonderful in the clinic, when they can be redosed parenterally (non-orally) at regular intervals, but they aren't very useful as go-home meds. Most of the oral opioids also lack any sort of clinical data as well.  NSAIDs are really the only other option, currently. They have proven efficacy, and can easily be administered at home. Unfortunately, they are limited, in that obviously an opioid, when properly absorbed and metabolized, will be able to control more significant pain. There are also dogs where an NSAID isn't appropriate (liver, kidney, GI disease).   Sorry if I rambled on too much, but let me know if anything needs further clarification. I can also hunt down plenty of sources as well (aside from the mentioned non-published data)."
AskVet,3c4g95,DrDead88,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:47:36 2015 UTC,"I can totally see how asking an owner to judge a pet's pain, particularly if it's something chronic, is a poor method of guaging an animal's pain levels. Aren't there more objective methods of measuring pain in animals?   Thanks for this. Very interesting!   Edit: My cousin is a vet and he said he quit prescribing drugs like morphine and fentanyl patches when an owner hit his own Dane so he could steal his dog's patches. Fuck people. I suppose it's better for a dog to actually get their own drugs even if they're slightly less effective than no pain management at all when their human steal their meds. I guess."
AskVet,3c4g95,DrDead88,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:16:00 2015 UTC,"Pain measurements can be tricky. Orthopedic exams, while often assigned numeric values for pain, are still somewhat subjective to each investigator. Other measurements, like activity levels (fit bits essentially) force plates, etc., are typically the primary outcome measures, and are more objective. But owner perception is still important as well, and you can't not ask for the owners input.  Just saw your edit- the fentanyl patches have their own issues, reliability of administered drug being one of them, diversion, and accidental exposure being another. Wonderful when they work though. I would imagine tramadol would have a pretty high risk of diversion, since its fairly popular in people. It's sad that we have to consider things like that.  Another edit: There are also numerous pain scoring scales, that examine behaviors like avoidance, guarding, etc, though these are used more in acute or post surgical settings for the most part."

Morphine I believe is a Schedule II, where as Tramadol is a schedule III.  The difference between licensing fees, storage and documentation requirements between the two is outrageous.  When hydrocodone went schedule II many veterinary clinics simply stopped carrying it.  My hospital was looking at doubling the fees we would have had to pay for all of our doctors and our practice for that one drug.  This would have forced us to charge far more than cash price at a major human pharmacy, so we decided to not carry it.   Tramadol can be effective, especially when combined with an NSAID in even acute pain.  If you don't feel that the prescribed pain medication is effective for the individual dog, you can ask for a written script to a human pharmacy."

While we waited for the surgeon to get in the next morning he was only on tramadol. He was in so much pain. I took him back in that night and they gave him methadone but even  with that he screamed in pain every time he tried to move his splinted legs. It just broke my heart.

AskVet,3c45ka,takingbackalison,3,Sat Jul 4 16:29:22 2015 UTC,Is he on a flea preventative?
AskVet,3c45ka,Tobimaru,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:30:37 2015 UTC,"This is what I thought too, since most (not all) dogs we see with food allergies are itchy on their feet and ears first.    OP also said he was a medium dog, about 35 pounds.  Does he run through tall grass a lot?  I know some low to the ground dogs, bassets and dachshunds mostly, will show signs of a grass allergy when they go outside because the grass constantly rubs their chest and belly.    Ultimately, OP your best bet would be to take your pup in for an exam.  They will get him checked for fleas, and talk with you about causes for itching.  They may even be able to prescribe something to offer relief from the itching and set you up with a quality flea preventative."
AskVet,3c45ka,RedQueenHypothesis,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:18:12 2015 UTC,He does spend I lot of time in the yard but our grass is cut short usually. I wanna say it's something seasonal though considering he seems much worse in the warmer months.

It's possibly nuclear sclerosis which is just a normal old-age change to the eye. If it's a cataract it will require some attention.   Sorry--just rechecked the age of your dog. Since he's so young, that's even more reason to have the vet look at the eye as it could be a corneal ulceration or some other eye injury. It's less likely to be nuclear sclerosis. I thought he was older."
AskVet,3c57zp,TeamRocketsWobbuffet,2,Sat Jul 4 22:24:33 2015 UTC,"There's not much I can offer in the way of help. The missing fur and wound could be an injury, it could be ringworm, it could be a parasite, or flea allergy. As for the cold, upper respiratory infections are really common in cats and could be viral or bacterial. If it's viral, there's nothing to do but wait it out. If it's bacterial, the kitty will need antibiotics.   Keep an eye on the wound. If it gets swollen and/or warm to the touch it's an abscess and requires prompt medical attention. Keep an eye on the respiratory infection. If kitty becomes lethargic, just sits in one place and purrs loudly and doesn't respond to you, or if s/he starts breathing rapidly or especially if it's breathing with an open mouth, that's an emergency and cannot wait until Monday.   Otherwise, if kitty seems mostly stable, then call the vet on Monday and tell them you need a same-day appointment."

They might also look at his lymph nodes - check size and morphology. Fine needle aspirates to determine how those cells are doing. An x-ray of your dog's chest might also be performed to see if his lungs are affected.   Lymphoma ranges from mild to severe, and the level of malignancy varies.  They'll stage it and then go from there.   You're in the best hands now at a specialist so just hold tight.   Wish you all the best."

It could also be a sign of OA, though it would be a little earlier than we expect most cats to be clinical for it. The vet will be able to tell you whether arthritis seems likely.

If it seems that the antibiotics and flea meds aren't making a difference, they may have a next step planned out already. Is is important to note that cats are very zealous groomers, and you don't always find the evidence of fleas, and ruling out fleas is one of the easiest/simplest steps for skin issues.

It didn't work out that way and I left after 6 months with poor surgical skills.   It has made it tough to get back in to general practice after a proper internship at a university and some more specialised anaesthesia work. I would need some supervision if I were to do surgery again just now, apart from very basic things.  At this point in your career staying up to date shouldn't be a problem. It should be the time you consolidate what you learned in vet school and apply it to the real world. It does mean some study, but no-one expects you to be the best vet in the world in your first 6 months. You will make mistakes, but they are easier to cope with and less severe if there is someone more experienced around to help you.  I guess it comes down to your personality as well. For me it was too much too soon. But that's just me. I tend to be more cautious about things and look for backup possibly too soon."

I started my first job able to do basic surgery (dog+cat spays/neuters, lump removals) completely by myself. I got shown once how to do a rabbit spay, and then was doing those completely alone as well.  I was promised mentorship, but I guess my boss thought I was capable enough so never offered any?? I am often the only vet in the clinic, and am frequently bullied into doing surgeries I've never even seen performed before (amputations, femoral head+neck excisions, cherry eye sx, full mouth extractions).  I am very lucky that nothing catastrophic has happened yet, but if I keep getting pressured to do surgeries beyond my skill set, it's only a matter of time before I accidentally kill something.  I am also expected to do diagnostic ultrasound, with ZERO training. I find it incredibly unethical to charge clients for a procedure that I do not have the training to do properly.

AskVet,3byl1l,sunset7766,4,Fri Jul 3 05:32:39 2015 UTC,"I would seek advice from your vet first and foremost.  Outside of just water, oiginal blue Dawn is mild enough that it can be used to help clean bird feathers without irritating the skin. However, I would avoid using it around her preen gland (located on her back, at the base of her tail).  Use a very small amount diluted in warm water, and it should help remove the grime. Make sure she stays warm and away from drafts afterwards.  Best of luck."
AskVet,3byl1l,painesgrey,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:12:30 2015 UTC,Thank you for the Dawn tip.  I looked it up and Google yielded a forum on using Dawn on birds and it said that the soap is lethal if she even ingests a drop.  Do you advise I put it in some kind of turkey baster?  Is there a safer method then a bowl of water?
AskVet,3byl1l,painesgrey,3,Sat Jul 4 00:49:48 2015 UTC,"I don't believe a drop of dawn diluted in a sink of warm water is going to be toxic/lethal to the bird. Remember, this is the same dawn (original blue, unscented) that is used to clean up birds and other wildlife caught up in oil spills.  Since your bird isn't covered in oil, you're really just using the small amount (far more diluted than what they use on wildlife) of dawn as an emulsifying agent to help remove dirt and debris from the feathers. It works better than just water alone, but doesn't irritate the skin. The only worry is that it can possibly dry out the preen gland, which is why you should avoid bathing that area.  I am curious about the forums you referenced, since I couldn't find anything about it on google. Would you mind linking it?"

I think he/she said ""bile"" acids, which is a test of liver function when you suspect a portosystemic shunt (or micro vascular dysplasia) - Yorkies are prone to those. When you change his diet, try to gradually mix over the course of 5-7 days. You can try other foods, but I doubt grain is the answer; it's popular advice on the internet but not really favored by vets. However, you could try a new novel protein diet like Hills d/d.

You might need several traps or traps/crates to accomplish this."
AskVet,3byi03,GiraffeInABox,4,Fri Jul 3 05:03:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not a veterinarian but I can try to help guide you to the best of my abilities.   Firstly, when is the last time they saw a veterinarian for a check-up? And have they ever had diagnostics done in the past or recently (ie bloodwork and/or a urinalysis)? These are very important tools for a veterinarian to rule out possible infection(s) or anything that may be going on internally that you cannot see; for example, just because a cat is acting happy/healthy, doesn't mean they are happy/healthy - sure, that's a really bad example, but do you get my drift? Key point:  It's always #1 to rule out physical diseases or issues first, then going to behavior. Now lets say you got bloodwork and urinalyses done for them and everything comes back fine. Your doc may say, hey, go see this behaviorist. You should probably go see one at this point; I PROMISE, that if you do the research in finding a good one, that it'll be worth your money. Also, if you decide to go to a behaviorist first, I bet you they'll ask if diagnostics have been done yet!   Anyways, I am also curious as to how many litterboxes you have? What kind of litter is it (ie clay clumping versus paper, etc), and is the litterbox covered or uncovered?   Another question - have you tried Feliway? It's literally made to help aid in situations like this.  Hope this helps some."
AskVet,3byi03,gelloz,3,Fri Jul 3 05:24:40 2015 UTC,"Vet exams ASAP.  If medical problems ruled out: More litter boxes, litter boxes in different areas, clean areas with urine smell (a black light may help find problem areas), feliway, different types of litter, cat attract litter, different types of boxes (eg: hooded, non hooded). If it's behavioral you need to investigate the reason why your cat doesn't want to use the box. If all else fails, your vet may be able to prescribe medications to help. But that is really the last step in the process so be ready to do some work before you get to that point.   Good luck."
AskVet,3byi03,shallowdays,5,Fri Jul 3 05:37:49 2015 UTC,"To add to the good advice so far, I'd recommend Narure's Miracle as a cleaner."
AskVet,3byi03,always_onward,2,Fri Jul 3 06:12:45 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, inappropriate urination can be quite difficult to correct. As others have said, start by ruling out a medical cause with a visit to the vet. Then make sure you have at minimum 1 extra litter box than there are cats. So if you have 2 cats, you need a minimum of 3 litter boxes. Put the litter boxes in different areas of the house - low traffic areas are best for making them feel less vulnerable. Make sure the litter boxes are far enough away from each other that one cat can't guard all the available boxes from the other and prevent the other cat from using them. Try different styles of litter box - open/covered/larger, etc. Try different types of litter and see if your cats have a preference, then use that. Try bedding the litter deep vs. shallow as well. Scoop the litter boxes daily.  As for the problem urination spots you might try an enzymatic cleaner, usually available at pet stores. Black light will highlight urine stains as well. Feliway is a calming pheromone for cats that can help reduce anxiety - they come in wall plug-ins and a spray that you can try out. This should help with stress if they are urinating inappropriately out of anxiousness. Finally, make their favorite spots to pee unavailable to them while simultaneously making the litter boxes clean and much more accessible. You can try putting foil over the problem spots (they don't like walking on it), or blocking off the area.  Last but not least, try to make sure your cats are getting a good amount of attention in the form of play and have an appropriate outlet for scratching behavior. Burning energy can help with general relaxation. Scratching posts help relieve their natural instinct to scratch, which may cause anxiety if there are no places for them to do so in your house. In general the goal is to make your cats feel relaxed and at ease.  Start there and be prepared for some trial and error. Good luck!"

AskVet,3bwunt,-spython-,2,Thu Jul 2 20:32:00 2015 UTC,Kinda here for opinions of people who have had to deal with this before mostly. I wanted to know if any one has been through this with a dog. I'm ok with my vets diagnosis  but it's just kinda worriesome not knowing much of what to expect
AskVet,3bwunt,skipsteejsprat,4,Thu Jul 2 20:53:24 2015 UTC,"Is my vet right   Sounds like you're not sure about the diagnosis.  Nobody here can tell you anything useful.  Try to get a video of an episode and bring it to a vet for a second opinion.  It's difficult enough to diagnose these things after the fact, even with the animal in front of us."
AskVet,3bwunt,AwsumbPossum,2,Thu Jul 2 22:40:20 2015 UTC,Got a video and took it to the Dr but he said he couldn't tell much from the video. It was a short minute long video just after and episode  of her trying to stand and being very wobbly  on her feet and not wanting to move.

AskVet,3bwfgh,ace518,4,Thu Jul 2 18:33:51 2015 UTC,"I'm a certified veterinary technician, and I thought this was worth mentioning. Please do not clean out the ears before your appointment! We use the ""original"" or ""untouched"" sample from the ears to determine what kind and how bad an infection or parasite might be happening up in there. To put it simply, it would actually make things more difficult to truly diagnose if you attempt to clean them out before we test the sample(s). Just had to add my two cents!"
AskVet,3bwfgh,gelloz,2,Fri Jul 3 05:41:13 2015 UTC,"When you go to the vet, they will do an ear cytology and otoscopic exam to check for mites or abnormal yeast or bacteria. If your cat has an infection, they will send you home with medication. They may instruct you to clean the ears prior to medicating. Soaking a cotton ball in ear cleaning solution and placing it in the ear and massaging it works well. Some cats dislike having cleaner poured directly into the ear."
AskVet,3bwfgh,peregr1ne,4,Fri Jul 3 00:25:30 2015 UTC,Ear infections without mites can look like this too.
AskVet,3bwfgh,goatsickle,2,Thu Jul 2 21:12:45 2015 UTC,"Agreed, which is why OP should get an opinion from their vet."

It isn't fair on the dog to be put in that situation - to be left outside where he feels the need to bite to protect himself.   If the seizures are increasing and the medications are making him worse then honestly euthanasia may be a kind option. Rehoming a dog with all of these problems is not going to happen unfortunately."

EDIT: Just quickly so you're aware, he wasn't outside alone.  He doesn't like to be.  My 11-year-old sister had him on a leash in the yard to pee.

You MIGHT be able to fix that with a pin and wires (which an average vet could probably do) but it may need plating, which is a little more advanced. I would need a full set of x-rys to know for sure. You are looking at probably $1500-2500 minimum to fix the leg properly. If that isn't a financial option, dogs do just fine on three legs. I would definitely amputate if the bill isn't feasible for surgical fix And Capstar can be used at the same time as tramadol, but you might consider revolution or advantage or something longer acting to prevent re-infestation"
AskVet,3buy19,docmeow,3,Thu Jul 2 11:42:09 2015 UTC,Pin and wire won't work. It's not oblique at all. That thing needs a plate.
AskVet,3buy19,Vasopressin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:50:13 2015 UTC,"I thought I replied to this earlier. Thank you so much for your reply! I have thought on it and really weighed out the options and I think I'm going with amputation. Even if we found a vet that felt like saving the leg could be done if the healing wasn't going well and he needed more surgery then I definitely couldn't afford it since this is emptying my measly bank account as it is and I already hit up the friends and family with gofundme. I had a dog have a back leg amputated so I've seen the healing process and I think he will be okay. I hope what I've read about owners being more psychologically hurt by the amputation than the pet is true though. I worry about him being sad about his leg after. He is a sweet happy little thing I'd hate to see him be sad. Last dog I had amputation was the only option (it was some kind of snake bite or something similar, caused the whole back leg to stop working) and my mom was the one who made the decision. With it being my decision it's weighing a little heavily on my shoulders, but I know it's better to keep him home than sending him to an already overcrowded shelter."
AskVet,3buy19,Rebekah88,5,Thu Jul 2 17:24:46 2015 UTC,"If there's no evidence of nerve damage (he can still feel the toes etc) then the leg should be salvageable. Based on just the one xray using plate and screws would probably be the best option, but an external skeletal fixator might work depending on the degree of swelling, his activity level etc. Best bet for saving the limb is a specialist surgeon, but there may be gp vets around who are confident with orthopaedics who could do it too (in the UK we have a mid level qualification called Advanced Veterinary Practitioner, and those vets with this qualification in surgery should be comfortable fixing this sort of fracture). Amputation is definitely a viable option if the finances don't work, but if surgical fixation is an option (financially and with regard to nerve damage) I'd aim for that if at all possible."
AskVet,3buy19,petites_pattes,2,Thu Jul 2 12:56:20 2015 UTC,"I want to add/emphasize a couple of things:  Surgery is a long and difficult process that involves the healing and re-hab. It's expensive, and you as an owner are responsible for much of the outcome based on how well you adhere to the surgeon's post-op guidelines and prescribed rehabilitation.  As /u/docmeow said, many dogs do just fine on 3 legs--and given your pup's breed he is likely to develop complications in his joints than larger, heavier breeds are prone to developing down the road."

AskVet,3bveyv,TheVampireSmacker,2,Thu Jul 2 13:49:54 2015 UTC,"If you think it's a matter of the amount of food your cat is eating, try adding a gold ball to the middle of her food dish (with said dish being full); this can help you determine whether or not she's eating too fast or too much.   Secondly, when is the last time your cat had a routine check-up with basic bloodwork and a urinalysis done? She's at the age where it's considered to be  a ""geriatric"" kitty, so these things are important! Bloodwork and a urinalysis could help your veterinarian also possibly determine whether or not her thyroid hormone is functioning properly (a physical effect of HYPERthyroidism is vomiting), if she may or may not have inflammatory bowel disease (vomiting can go hand-in-hand with this sometimes), and kidney issues (where vomiting can also occur). Not saying she has any of these things, which is why I wrote possibly - there is definitely a possibility that with old age, where some of these things can starts to show up.  Plus, cats are more complex than we think, remember that. :)  http://www.catvets.com/ This website is amazing if you ever need any cat advice or help from veterinary professionals; made just for cats.

I never take them out and they usually hide when we have guests so it seems like they've become so antisocial that their social bar would be blood red if they were on The Sims. I'm as traumatised as they were, (also my hands have been clawed madly) it was like an exorcism.

AskVet,3bv2fd,Choccokels,4,Thu Jul 2 11:39:46 2015 UTC,"The heat is probably not the cause of the diarrhea.  Is she on prevention for parasites?

AskVet,3bv2fd,dashclone,3,Thu Jul 2 12:22:36 2015 UTC,"Generally heat doesn't cause diarrhoea. Heat stroke can cause vomiting and diarrhoea and needs urgent attention, but she would be lethargic, weak and possibly collapsed.  Is she still drinking water? I'd be very concerned about her dehydrating and she should probably get checked out by a vet."
AskVet,3buuc1,Anduu1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:46:14 2015 UTC,"The problem with draining the fluid is that it's a very short term symptom reliever, ie the fluid builds up again pretty quickly if the underlying cause isn't treated. What can happen is that you drain the fluid and then (particularly with large volumes such as you get in large dogs) the body puts it all back from its own reserves which can potentially result in a dehydrated dog. The diuretics aim to use the kidneys to promote fluid removal from the body but at a slower rate than just draining it all off in one go, so the body has time to adjust. The fact that the steroids aren't working as well may mean that the underlying disease process is worsening, but unfortunately without knowing what that is, it's difficult to suggest a likely prognosis. It might be worth a chat with the original vet at the hospital (or a specialist if the hospital vet wasn't one) to see if they have any other suggestions or if they think it's worth repeating tests as something may have developed now she has worsened."
AskVet,3buuc1,Rebekah88,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:37:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply.  Of course the worst case scenario has been in the back of my mind since day one so I have been desperate to find anything that helps.My thought process with draining the fluid was that it would relieve some of the stress off of her and the Lasix would take care of the threat of fluid building up again.  This http://www.carecentre.ca/ is the hospital we took her to if you are interested.They are state of the art but their best and brightest   are at a loss as to what is going on.As far as they are concerned we are doing everything we can right now to try and stabilise the situation  A little update from today:  Health wise no change really.She hasn't gotten any worse nor has she shown any signs of improving yet.  We talked to the vet here at home who knows her case best today.(The vet I dealt with yesterday who started her on the Lasix didn't really know her case that well so he took the safe route with the Lasix dosage.He was the only vet on call that day being a holiday...)  Anyway the regular vet has significantly increased the Lasix dosage,effectively quadrupling it hoping to get things moving.  So basically now we wait again.Now with the dosage increased we are starting to see higher urine output which wasn't happening before.Right now we are just hoping to get her stable so we can continue the search for answers"
AskVet,3buaaz,riddlznthedark,6,Thu Jul 2 05:14:38 2015 UTC,Honestly I'd just ask for a biopsy. Discuss with your new vet that this has been an ongoing problem and you feel like you aren't progressing. Say you've had treatment and it hasn't worked. And then just ask them if they would do blood work and biopsy the site. Don't give him any food for 6 hours before the appointment in case they want to sedate him.  If you can afford a referral then a specialist vet practice/hospital with a CT machine might give better answers.
AskVet,3buaaz,dashclone,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:41:55 2015 UTC,I second the recommendation for a CT. Seeing a boarded internal medicine or surgical specialist could be helpful here.

AskVet,3bt2r0,tdrusk,4,Thu Jul 2 12:07:41 2015 UTC,Training is not going to address this issue properly. Behavioral problems are usually not solved with training.

I have heard multiple professional dog trainers say that the act of training helps with behavioral issues. You mentioned a veterinary behaviorist. What would they do differently than a mostly-positive trainer? Would there be any overlap in methods?"
AskVet,3bt2r0,tdrusk,4,Thu Jul 2 13:37:02 2015 UTC,It seems to me this dog has developed a generalized fearfulness to most social interactions. This is not a matter of obedience or disobedience that can be fixed with training. It is an irrational fear. A behaviorist will know best how to gradually reduce this fear.  There will be lots of positive techniques employed. My fear with a trainer is a lack of understanding of how to address this dog without moving too quick. The sad thing with behavioral issues is that improper techniques can backfire and make the issue worse.

I'm afraid you'll just have to trust the surgeons. If they are specialists they can usually adapt to what they find, and they would have told you if they thought amputation was a better option."
AskVet,3bus92,dashclone,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:17:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed with /u/dashclone - getting her to a specialist surgeon was the best thing you could do for her. It takes a lot of work and study to get to that point, so they know what they're doing. Orthopaedic surgeons don't like having to resort to amputation (fracture fixation is a challenge and they don't like to lose the challenge) so she will do her utmost to fix it as well as she can. Tibial plateau fractures with small fragments can be difficult but without xrays it's impossible to tell how much of a challenge this particular one would be."
AskVet,3bt4hi,Accuse,2,Wed Jul 1 22:49:56 2015 UTC,"There are a range of possibilities from good to bad.

AskVet,3bsq7y,tariq_loveschicken,10,Wed Jul 1 21:02:36 2015 UTC,"Have you tried any actual flea preventions (as in a topical or oral medication)? Usually over the counter flea baths/shampoos and sprays can be nearly worthless, and anti-itch medications don't take care of the cause.   Unfortunately, since the fleas on her only account for about 5-10% of the total flea population, you'll be facing an uphill battle- the rest are in your home. You need to vacuum and wash everything that can be vacuumed and washed every week for up to 3 months, in addition to using a veterinary recommended flea preventative, to hope to eradicate the issue. Monthly flea prevention thereafter should prevent any recurrence."
AskVet,3bsq7y,DrDead88,8,Wed Jul 1 21:55:09 2015 UTC,"First, you need to get a flea and tick preventive from the vet. Grocery store brands like Sentry, Bio Spot, and Hartz are not very effective and potentially harmful. Then you need to treat your home. The majority of the problem are the fleas in the environment. Vacuum everywhere well and repeatedly, bring the bag to the outside garbage or dump the container in the outside garbage, wash all bedding in hot water. Don't use the flea baths or sprays once you have administered the flea and tick preventive from your vet. You can also call an exterminator if the problem is that bad. It's extremely important to treat the environment or they're never going to go away. If your pet is that uncomfortable, at least call the vet, but it may be time for another appointment so that your vet can guide you and make sure that there isn't anything else going on. Fleas carry tapeworms, heavy infestations can cause anemia in small animals, and some animals are allergic to fleas and require additional medication to keep them comfortable.   Edit: I mentioned exterminator multiple times. Oops."

Lamb, chicken and duck versions so far. The vet just said follow the instructions on the can, but it doesn't really go into much detail.   It says 6-8 pound cats 2 cans a day and then double adult feeding for kitten. Does that mean she should be eating 4 cans (3 ounce cans) or does it mean based on weight. If it means based on weight, but then doesn't give me a 1-2 pound weight I'm still not sure how much I should be feeding.   Today she has eaten 1 and 1/2 cans so far."
AskVet,3bru6a,always_onward,3,Thu Jul 2 22:09:59 2015 UTC,"So...I looked into Nature's variety. Couple of red flags for me.   1) it is Formulated to AAFCO standards meaning they are not tested with feeding trials. That scares me. Just because it is Formulated to meet the standards doesn't mean it'll actually keep a live animal healthy.   2) stay away from food meant for All Life Stages. That means it is an average of the nutrients needed by adults and kittens alike. Buy kitten specific food so that it is appropriate for the high energy needs of a kitten.  3) No research posted on their website. That scares me more.  4) lots of advertising about grain free and a bunch of other stuff that doesn't really mean anything. A ton of trumpeting about raw diets, grain free, gluten free, etc.  PS please don't feed your pets raw diets.  As far as amount, kittens until they are about 12 months should be free fed. Kittens aren't as prone to obesity as dogs. Unless your kitten eats nonstop, there is no need to limit her intake. If it becomes an issue, message me and i can tell you how to calculate her needs. You start transitioning to an adult diet at about 8 months."
AskVet,3bru6a,littlehamsterz,3,Thu Jul 2 22:33:58 2015 UTC,"The All Life Stages is not an average; it meets the higher nutrient profile requirements of kitten food, which also covers adults."
AskVet,3bru6a,TwinkyK,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:52:34 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input. I look forward to hearing from you how to calculate her intake. I was having trouble finding any cans that said for kittens at petsmart (strange). I'll pick up some dry food for free feeding.
AskVet,3bru6a,always_onward,2,Thu Jul 2 23:14:56 2015 UTC,Purina is available at PetSmart makes good kitten food. You can do wet food as well as dry food for free feeding.

AskVet,3bru6a,daydreams356,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:42:20 2015 UTC,"I used to feed my kitten dry food that I left out in a bowl since he didn't eat a lot all at once. He was more of a grazer, most kittens are. With wet food, however, you can't leave it out for more than an hour really or else the bacteria will start to build up especially if you live in a warm environment. Dry food is also much better for the teeth then wet food."
AskVet,3btq6d,Narraxus,3,Thu Jul 2 01:57:35 2015 UTC,What food is she on at the moment? Did she stop all of the offal and is just getting the Hills?  Unfortunately with chronic cases like this you're looking at starting diagnostic tests. We generally start with blood work and go from there. You could be looking at x-rays or even endoscopy and biopsies of her stomach before you get a diagnosis.
AskVet,3btq6d,dashclone,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:31:42 2015 UTC,"Currently she is only eating the Hill's kibble, with ""treats"" of cooked chicken meat in a bit of water (kind of like a lil soup, she loves to lick the water and we thought it was good for her so she doesn't dehydrate). she was getting only the kibble up to this point but we have been warned about dehydration since it's summer. Okay, x-rays and bloodwork for starters. Thank you"

And I'll say that I haven't been a vet for very long, but I have spent a lot of time studying dentistry and working with dentists.  A broken tooth will become less painful as the nerve dies.  But it will not seal itself over in the sense that infection won't happen - it will, eventually.  That's why it gets swollen, because it's an abscess.  And when it gets infected, it's a direct line to the bloodstream and it will constantly shower bacteria into the blood.  You'll eventually have to root canal it or pull it.  So why wait?  Animals have to eat to live, obviously, so it would take a LOT of pain and damage for them to stop eating.  If you want a second opinion, you should consider talking to a veterinary dentist."

AskVet,3bs9ot,mecrjzak,6,Wed Jul 1 19:04:29 2015 UTC,"To maintain that quality of life- the cyclosporin and tacrolimus help with the KCS (""dry eye"") so she can make her own tears, and the neopolydex helps with any sort of infection or inflammation of the eyes. You would not be able to apply the refresh optive at a high enough frequency to maintain adequate hydration/lubrication of the eye or prevent discomfort.   Blind dogs can get around surprisingly well though, as long as you don't suddenly change the arrangement of their environment (moving furniture and such)."
AskVet,3bs9ot,DrDead88,5,Wed Jul 1 19:14:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I guess I needed to vent and felt pessimistic, but I guess it is fairly obvious the drug store eye drops would not help like the drops she was given. I just wish there was a magic fix, I would have rather paid 3k for a surgery that could fix her, then about 2k a year on meds and appointments (I do recall a surgery doing something with her saliva glands to make tears, but they said it wasn't a great solution). Thank you again."
AskVet,3bs9ot,DrDead88,6,Wed Jul 1 19:26:53 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately KCS can be frustrating to treat. If the ophthalmologist does think that your girl truly is 95% blind, and that the corneal scarring is too severe to resolve, then you may discuss whether enucleation (complete removal of the eye) would be indicated- it would be another expensive surgery, but it does get rid of the medication issue."

AskVet,3bpw67,Tobimaru,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:07:45 2015 UTC,Thank you for your replies.  This is what happened.  For what ever reason my phone didn't alert me to reddit mail until four something in the morning.  By that time we had gotten some water in him and he was back up and walking around.  He even took his pill.  I showed my mother the replies but since he was doing better and she was exhausted she decided on waking up at six to take him back to our vet as soon as it opens.  I stayed up with him and watched him until my mom got back up.  He slept and his respiration was normal.  This morning he refused his food again and my mom took him back to the vet.  They gave him an iv and vitamins.  They said his liver is effected too.  We are weening him off the phenobarb.  He is back to that really lethargic state and his respiration has increased.  The vet and my mom agreed that he would do better to try and recover at home so she brought him home but if he doesn't eat his dinner he is going to be admitted.  Our 16 year old short hair spayed female has now refused her wet good for two days in a row but did eat dry.  Our 10 year old short hair spayed female who usually woofs her regular cat food so she can rush into the other room to steal as much yd from the older cats as possible did not do this today.  She sniffed the wet yd and didnt want anything to do with it.  Thats the first time that has happened since the older cats went on yd.    Anyway...It may be nothing but since this is all happening at the same time my mom bought a new case of yd.  We are going to use the new case for dinner and watch what happens with all three of our cats.  Thank you all for taking the time to reply.  I really wish I had manually checked the thread.  I didn't expect the super fast reply and was really focused on him.  Sorry.  I've only lurked here a bit so I'm not sure but would you guys like more updates?  Or should I just do a final update once he is better? Or not at all?

Fleas are a pain to get rid of in the household so be sure to do that at the same time you are treating the cat. Have you tried a program injection? Capstar? Revolution? Your cat sounds like a flea allergy and I'd encourage you to see a vet in order to get some immediate relief from the itching and plan an attack on the fleas on the cat and in the home.

I have the refills coming on a subscribe and save.   http://www.amazon.com/Feliway-Plug-In-Diffuser-bottle-Milliliters/dp/B000WHUOE  Edit: but really I'd take him to the vet.

She started having issues using the litter box.  She was forming urinary crystals.  The only thing that changed was me leaving home.  Poor anxious little girl.  We switched her food and got the feliway...so I can't say for sure it is what helped.  But, my mom is a vet tech and she recommended it.

AskVet,3bo3j9,veraxxxx,4,Tue Jun 30 19:43:47 2015 UTC,"Aftercare will depend on what the vets do. At the very least you can expect a few weeks of rest and at least a week of pain medications and antibiotics. The vet may keep her for a few days to make sure everything is ok post op.  Once she is sorted and comfortable at home then there is no reason why she can't be left alone as long as she has restricted access to exercise. You don't want her trying to jump on something and injuring herself. An enclosed room with food, water, litter tray and toys should be ok.  There aren't any supplements that will help. You may want to investigate physio in your area that works with cats if you think she would tolerate it. Discuss it with your vet.  Nothing much apart from pain meds and a decent comfy bed that she will ignore in favour of a cardboard box. Some places have prolonged pain medications as an optional extra. Post-op inflammation is no fun and delays wound healing so I always suggest people opt for that.  Hope that helps. Shout if there are any more questions."
AskVet,3bo3j9,dashclone,3,Tue Jun 30 19:51:01 2015 UTC,The biggest mistake I see people make with recoveries are leaving animals in a room with a couch or bed. Your kitty should not be jumping on or off of ANYTHING while she recovers. If you do not have a room where she is limited to the floor I would suggest getting a large dog crate and set her up in there while you work and cannot supervise. Definitely be sure she has anti inflammatories from the vet and pain meds for at least the first week or two.  To keep her calm ask your vet about pheromone collars and/or diffusers. They have a natural relaxing effect and can help keep your kitty calm.

Please take them in for a recheck and deworm them both.  You will need to keep treating both cats and the environment for fleas. You should ask your vet about Seresto collars (fleas and ticks for 8 months) but this is only for 10+ weeks as a long term solution. Revolution for cats (monthly topical) can begin at 8 weeks as a long term preventative. Revolution takes care of fleas and heartworm and intestinal parasites. Ask your vet about these options.

Nik raised his mammoth paw and bright it down on Hal's ear.   Hal retreated for a few days.  Hal started pestering again, and Nik raised his paw.  Hal retreated.  That was last July/August.  Today, they (and their sister, Savannah) play like gang-busters.     Every now and then, its Savannah who picks the fights now.   If I'm home, I just redirect her attention with a tongue click or snap.  But, even if Sav goes to pick a fight with Nik (twice her size), Nik gives a few warnings and even retreats.    If she keeps going, I figure....she wanted it.  Lol  Maybe I've just been lucky with all my cats.  Very friendly and social with other animals and people.

AskVet,3bkpid,myowngod,3,Tue Jun 30 00:37:11 2015 UTC,"If you're concerned with his current treatment, aren't sure what exactly you're treating, etc, discuss it with the vet. You can also discuss the surgical options, and get clarifications on the recommendations from there as well.   If you're not satisfied with the answers or treatment plan, you can always seek a second opinion, whether it's from another general practitioner, or from a specialist (probably surgical or orthopedic)."
AskVet,3bkpid,DrDead88,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:42:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks - I think we are going to get a second opinion.  He's recommended surgery, or not, on different occasions; apparently he'd remove the area of the pad that's sensitive, even though there's not a clear lump to excise.    A week ago, he was saying that laser treatments and topical remedies should help, and that surgery on the foot would be expensive, painful, and difficult.  Yesterday he was acting like he'd been recommending surgery all along but was humoring ME for not wanting to do it.  Reminding him of what he'd said previously didn't seem to register.  I like him as a vet, and I don't blame him, but I do need some other input."
AskVet,3bklcp,LouieBot,5,Tue Jun 30 00:01:59 2015 UTC,"Don't wait to take him to a vet. The fact that he vomited pieces of bone means that there can be pieces of bone or some other object lodged in his gastrointestinal tract or it could have cut or perforated the tract or it could just be incidental. But if it is a foreign body, that can be life threatening and it's very important that he's seen ASAP."
AskVet,3bklcp,bexinc,2,Tue Jun 30 05:50:00 2015 UTC,My vet had given me Hill's i/d food and peptosyl to calm his stomach down and for the diarrhoea.

AskVet,3blgfa,Snarkcepted,6,Tue Jun 30 04:29:44 2015 UTC,"Not a vet, but the FAQ reads that skin bumps and lesions and the like are nigh impossible to diagnose over the Internet and when a vet does respond, it will probably be to tell you to take your pup to the vet, especially if it has you this concerned."

AskVet,3bkja8,midnight1214,3,Mon Jun 29 23:43:54 2015 UTC,"Unless directed by the veterinarian, I would stop the yogurt- adult cats are lactose intolerant, and it's very possible you're just making the diarrhea worse.   If a solid treatment plan wasn't discussed, then I would definitely call back and make sure you have one. If you aren't satisfied with the answers, then it is always your right to seek a second opinion. Unfortunately, if you aren't able to monitor her while at work, and the health of the kittens is at risk, you may need to drop her off at a vet clinic for the day, where they may either maintain the mother's cleanliness, may work to get the kittens on milk replacement. etc."

AskVet,3bl65v,foodie42,5,Tue Jun 30 02:57:11 2015 UTC,"I've owned cats my whole life and have never detected a 'cat smell' apart from urine, feces, dirty litter box and the occasional anal gland smell.   How often are the litter boxes cleaned?  How often is the litter replaced and the actual box scrubbed?  Have you checked in all the closets/small spaces for feces/urine?  A flashlight and black light are essential for this.    Edit: I wouldn't expect it from a young cat, but dental disease can get bad enough that the entire vicinity smells.  But most of the time, owners can tell that it's coming from the mouth."
AskVet,3bl65v,skipsteejsprat,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:43:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know how to describe the smell, just that anyone I've ever known with a cat smells of it, and so does their home, in the same way you can tell someone smokes. It doesn't smell like ammonia or excrement. It doesn't smell like wet cat litter. It's just a specific odor that tells me ""this is a cat's home"". And it's everywhere.   Her litter box is in the basement, and we all keep it super tidy. She only pees and poops in certain spots, and we clean the feces out daily and the urine pads weekly. We've scrubbed the box a few times in the last 6 months; we replace the pellets monthly. Both should probably be done more often, but her litter box doesn't really smell (only after she goes).  Pixel, herself, doesn't really smell either. I mean she smells like a cat in the same way I smell like a human, but there's nothing noticeable, no tooth or gland problems. She's not allowed in closets or behind things with wires (TV, fish tank, etc.) so her ""small spaces"" are extremely limited.    We got some natural odor-eater spray and that seems to help immensely. But the smell is still there, still in my clothes, and no one seems to know what I'm talking about, nevermind how to help."
AskVet,3bl65v,skipsteejsprat,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:43:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry if this sounds insensitive, but is there any way this could be in your head?  I mean, typically if there is a constant smell in someone's house, they can't smell it themselves since they get used to it."

AskVet,3bl65v,skipsteejsprat,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:59:49 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just in the house?   I've just never heard of a ""cat smell"" and I'm guessing nobody else has either, since nobody responded."
AskVet,3bkbm9,mysled,2,Mon Jun 29 22:38:56 2015 UTC,"If your dog does well on RC GI, stop mixing it up as it obviously makes it worse. If there is a canned food version of RC GI use that to spice up the food. Smaller bowel movements means more of the nutrients are being retained by your dog as RC makes highly digestible food.  Alternatively, have you tried a hypoallergenic diet? It may help if your dog just has some sort of weird allergy.  You may want to consult for an internal medicine vet."
AskVet,3bkbm9,littlehamsterz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:32:11 2015 UTC,"Okay cool, thanks! We have tried a limited ingredient food (I believe it was the acana duck and Bartlett pear), but that was one of the worst for her. I know everyone jumps to ""my dog has a food allergy"" and I've always been skeptical when I hear it (especially because my understanding is environmental is way more common), but it does sort of seem that way, doesn't it?   I can definitely grab the canned GI stuff and use that. We will have to be careful about treats and stuff too. Oddly we have sort of noticed that fish in any form seems to almost always result in her having issues the next day. The RC has fish oil though, and I've tried her on a food with no fish oil, and that didn't work at all.   We do have a local vet we stumbled on that's really helpful (the one that prescribed the RC, though he did that without seeing her when I brought in a fecal sample and mentioned her issues in the waiting room, so he's never actually seen her). I'll talk to him about our options. This is my first dog so some reassurance that I'm not just taking crazy pills is appreciated :)"
AskVet,3bkbm9,littlehamsterz,2,Tue Jun 30 13:15:30 2015 UTC,"Good luck. Hill's makes hypoallergenic treats if you want to give those a shot if no other treats are working.  I would talk to you vet about trying a hydrolyzed option since even on the GI your dog isn't 100%. A hydrolyzed diet is better than limited ingredient food. It has proteins too small to USUALLY cause an allergic reaction.  The only way to get a diagnosis is probably a GI biopsy for histology, which is invasive."
AskVet,3bjmtk,vladimirlovescake,9,Mon Jun 29 19:35:29 2015 UTC,"I would definitely get him checked out- he could have bladder irritation (could be stones, infection, FIC/FLUTD), which can cause an aversion to the litter. In general, you always rule out medical issues before assuming/treating behavioral anyway.   I'd try to get him in as soon as possible, just for discomfort issues, but if he's still eating/drinking, and isn't vomiting, lethargic, etc, then it can wait until tomorrow.   If you ever notice him straining without producing urine (as in, he can't urinate), then he needs to be seen on an emergency basis, as he could be blocked (life threatening)."
AskVet,3bjmtk,DrDead88,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:49:48 2015 UTC,"Check with your apartment manager to see what animals have been in that apartment before you.

AskVet,3blctf,djacob__,5,Tue Jun 30 03:56:31 2015 UTC,"I would ask for vet records from the breeder's vet, and absolutely schedule a vet visit for her with your current vet. If she acts shady about getting you the records or claims she can't produce them, I'd be concerned that she was covering something up or never brought the kitten to the vet at all.  Regardless, I would bring her to a vet asap for your vet's assessment on the situation.  Did she come with a contract or health guarantee from the breeder in regards to the eye?"
AskVet,3blctf,rvtjess,0,Tue Jun 30 04:06:30 2015 UTC,I signed a contract and have a 3 day period where I can take the cat to the vet with a full health guarantee.

AskVet,3blctf,rvtjess,4,Tue Jun 30 04:12:06 2015 UTC,"Ideally you'd go to the ophthalmologist, but your regular vet for a general health checkup and eye exam will suffice. They will at a minimum be able to perform a couple in-house tests to test eye function and any other issues."

Were you given a buster collar (cone of shame/E-collar) for him?   If he's licking at it then he needs to stop. If you don't have a cone then it's honestly worth it. If the area becomes more red or has more discharge then it's time to see the vets.  If you are concerned then call your vets. A lot of places do free post-op consultations.

We don't really have our own vet, we use the ASPCA and they are not the most convenient. At this point we're looking at tomorrow as the earliest possibility."
AskVet,3bk0uc,dashclone,3,Mon Jun 29 21:36:47 2015 UTC,"The clinical signs are rather severe because they come from kidney failure.

AskVet,3bhrt9,HP_Hair_And_Hops,3,Mon Jun 29 09:30:03 2015 UTC,"You'll really just need to take her back in, preferably to a dental specialist. Because of the chronic nature, you're likely looking at a major dental and could be up to full mouth extractions and gum biopsy. Cats tend to do very well with that, given that the pain level tends to be very high before the extractions. Your vet may be comfortable with doing the extractions, but you'll want to make sure that they have the ability to do dental xrays and would do them before and after extractions.  The two over the counter products that we routinely suggest to clients are this mouthwash: http://www.vetrxdirect.com/product/view/cet-oral-hygiene-rinse/variation-183?utm_medium=shoppingengine&utm_source=productads and this water additive: http://www.vetrxdirect.com/product/view/cet-aquadent/variation-604?utm_medium=shoppingengine&utm_source=productads  but I think that either of those would be putting a band aid on a bullet hole at this point and would moreso be things I would use after a dental cleaning if she had teeth remaining.  You can apply at carecredit.com (read the terms & conditions carefully so they don't bite you in the ass...) to finance the dental work, but I would make it as much of a priority as possible."

You can make an informed and educated decision with all possible information tailored for your dog.  Ask your vet to fax all records, xrays, ultrasounds and labwork to the oncologist and just schedule a consult.  Start writing down questions and take that with you too.  This way you will have real information instead of speculation.  As the ACVIM information sheet says, everything is really variable and depends on a variety of factors.   http://www.acvim.org/Portals/0/PDF/Animal%20Owner%20Fact%20Sheets/Oncology/Onco%20Hemangiosarcoma.pdf  Meet with an oncologist, then go from there."
AskVet,3bgsoo,Neryian,2,Mon Jun 29 04:44:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the quick reply.  We have talked to the oncologist several times to help understand the disease and options.  Both her and the surgeon mentioned that the location was not typical.  They didn't say, maybe because of the nature of the disease, whether the difference would affect prognosis."
AskVet,3bgd78,xjuggernaughtx,10,Mon Jun 29 00:02:10 2015 UTC,The Internet hasn't been helpful on this subject because she needs to see a vet to make sure she doesn't have an infection or something else going on.
AskVet,3bgd78,rvtjess,4,Mon Jun 29 00:26:28 2015 UTC,Could be a symptom of pyometra or another type of infection. I would seek vet attention today.
AskVet,3bgd78,HRH_Maddie,3,Mon Jun 29 10:31:25 2015 UTC,This sounds concerning enough to schedule a vet visit today.
AskVet,3bfadf,calicoan,9,Sun Jun 28 18:31:16 2015 UTC,"Here is a good summary of FLUTD/FIC for you to read through, in case you haven't seen it.   The prognosis really depends on his response to treatment though- the goals are to decrease as many risk factors as possible- the special diet was for urinary crystals/stones, the antibiotics are for UTIs (and kind of stones), the anti-depressants are for stress (a risk factor), and the prazosin and alprazolam help to relax the urethral sphincters (to avoid a total urethral blockage, which is life threatening/an emergency).   While alprazolam's use is mostly empirical (not much if any veterinary data/studies), it is nonetheless used with ""reported"" efficacy, and without reported issues/contraindications for long-term use. Fluoxetine (Prozac) does have published papers, and is fairly widely used for behavioral/urinary issues in cats.   There are medications that are available for inflammation and pain, and if you feel that your boy would benefit from anti-inflammatories or analgesics, you should definitely discuss it with your vet.   Unfortunately, there is still much to learn about the disease process, treatment/prevention, etc. While some neutraceuticals/non-prescription medications may be useful, the natural course of the disease (resolution within a week or so, typically) means that almost all published studies show no difference in the time to resolution between treatments, placebos, and even wheat flour. That's not to say that medication isn't necessary however, as the medications listed above will hopefully prevent future recurrence, or will help prevent progression to life threatening conditions (urethral obstruction), or, in the case of any pain or antiinflammatory medications, treat the discomfort associated with the disorder.   Edit: The Indoor Pet Initiative at The OSU is also a useful resource, primarily when it comes to Multi-Modal Environmental Modification (MEMO), though it looks like some of those steps have already been taken."

Refilled fluids prescription - to be given at 1 unit per day. Begin the Prozac prescription.   Both by his main vet and the vet he saw today say it's unusual for an episode of FIC to continue on this long (approx 20 days, so far).    They say these episodes usually resolve in 5-10 days...

AskVet,3bevyy,jld718,17,Sun Jun 28 16:23:13 2015 UTC,"One option is to find a dog park that has a separate area for smaller dogs (typically around that 15 lb or less range). I'm not sure how prevalent that is, but the park closest to me has this separate area.   Another option is to not go to the dog park, which is obviously not the advice you asked for. Dog parks are just horrible for a number of reasons: You are bringing together a bunch of dogs with unknown vaccination/deworming status, unknown temperament/behavioral training, unknown veterinary care/disease status, etc. While most of the time there's no issue, there is quite a lot of risk when you think about it. Instead, my dog and I meet up with a friend and his dogs, and we go to a human park with trails that allows on leash dogs. The dogs get interaction and exercise, I get interaction and exercise, and a lot of those risks are mitigated."
AskVet,3bevyy,DrDead88,3,Sun Jun 28 16:41:59 2015 UTC,"I take my dog to the park all the time. He is 65 lbs. so rules I go by probably will differ a bit for you, but there's a few things I always watch out for when I go.  If it's not crazy crowded I always try to pin point who owns what dog and what that owner is doing. If they are sitting on a bench on the opposite side of the park, on their phone, totally oblivious, I usually try to encourage my dog away from their dog or I stay very close by when the 2 are playing. If the owner is paying attention, but it's obvious the owner has no control of their dog (the dog completely ignores them, does what they want) I'll usually leave the park. I've ran into a couple people with high strung German shepherds who harassed other dogs to the point of starting fights. Whenever the owner would come close the dogs would run away not even looking at the owner or acknowledge they had heard them, usually chasing another dog. Not a safe situation, best to just leave. I've also worked a lot with my dog on his recall. If I yell his name he will come running no matter what he's doing. He likes to investigate any scuffles that happen, and my goal is to keep him far away from those by calling him to me right away. I also keep an eye out for dogs who display more dominant behaviors. I don't worry too much about my dog with these guys because of his size and he has a super submissive personality, but with smaller dogs I would keep an eye on the dominant dogs as things can go bad quicker for them. If a dog is displaying aggressive behaviors towards your dog and the owner does nothing/doesn't leave themself, I would just leave. It sucks, but better safe than sorry.  I have found most people are usually respectful and good with their dogs at the park, but there's always bad eggs that show up every once in a while. All you can do is watch your dog carefully and know when they are scared/have had too much. If you get a bad vibe from someone, just leave and come back at a different time."

AskVet,3bevyy,cjs132,3,Mon Jun 29 02:30:05 2015 UTC,"No problem. It happens, but it's really rare. We've been going regularly to parks for 2 years and I've only seen an injury occur on very rare occasions and it's always the result of someone not paying attention."
AskVet,3bevyy,lindygrey,2,Mon Jun 29 02:51:15 2015 UTC,Many breeds have a meetup and there are small breed meetups too. You should check them out. We don't play at dog parks anymore as Italian Greyhounds are just too delicate.
AskVet,3bevyy,PinkSlip_YoureFired,-3,Sun Jun 28 22:56:45 2015 UTC,"What was the breed/size of the dog that killed the Chihuahua? What you saw was likely an instance of predatory drift. Were the two playing at the time, was the Chihuahua running, and/or was it making high pitched noises of any sort?    Your safest bet is not to allow play with larger dogs or dogs with high prey drive (no matter how gentle). Stick to other similarly sized dogs as playmates. Does your park have a small dog area?"

If she's still able to oxygenate fine, but is coughing, then you can still return and ask about cough suppressants, or you can give the medications more time to work (sounds like we're only 24 hours out). It's quite possible that the trauma exacerbated the underlying/resolving respiratory infection as well.   A second opinion is also an option, if you're worried about the treatment plan/diagnosis from the first vet."

Get a harness - a front clip if pulling is an issue. My recommendation would be the Freedom, but there are lots of good ones. The Easy Walk is the one people report most issues with, so I'd steer clear of that one even though it's the most common. A back clip harness is fine too - it's a myth that they cause dogs to pull. Lack of training does. Loose leash walking can be trained on a harness just as it can a collar."
AskVet,3bevw9,PinkSlip_YoureFired,5,Sun Jun 28 16:44:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice and agreed. Her collar is only for her pet tag. This happened when we were just at home, so she wasn't wearing a harness like she would be on a walk etc."

AskVet,3bf11d,ironmouse,2,Sun Jun 28 17:38:50 2015 UTC,"The brown stuff is tartar, which can't be removed by brushing alone. The only way to get rid of it is to book her in for a dental at the vet's. This will involve a general anaesthetic and a scale + polish or extraction depending on whether there is an infection in the tooth.   Obviously there are risks associated with general anaesthesia in all animals, but the risk of an adverse event will be increased due to your dog's age. If there is no sign of gingivitis (reddening of the gum around the tooth) and the dog is still eating normally and shows no sign of pain when eating, it may not be worth putting her under the stress of a general anaesthetic. Your vet will be able to advise you further on whether a dental is necessary."

AskVet,3bedcq,littlehamsterz,2,Sun Jun 28 14:33:33 2015 UTC,"Tapeworms are carried by fleas, and pets get them by ingesting fleas. If this is a tapeworm, chances are very likely that the pets have been exposed at some point.  Just because you don't see any doesn't mean they aren't there. Fleas only spend a small portion of their lives on your pets feeding; a majority of their lives are spent in the environment.  Distended belly may mean she has intestinal parasites, be it tapeworms or others."
AskVet,3bg40u,dddonnanoble,2,Sun Jun 28 22:39:01 2015 UTC,"I'm taking this excerpt from the AAFP guidelines, which can be found here   Discordant antigen test results may occur when results of soluble antigen tests and/or IFA tests do not agree and may make determination of the true FeLV status of a cat difficult. The most common scenario is with a positive soluble antigen test and a negative IFA test. In most cases, such cats are truly infected. Discordant results may be due to the stage of infection, the variability of host responses, or technical problems with testing. The status of the cat with discordant results may eventually become clear by repeating both tests in 60 days and annually thereafter until the test results agree. Cats with discordant test results are best considered potential sources of infection for other cats until their status is clarified.   The soluble antigen test is the SNAP test, for clarification.   And now, from the Idexx product insert found here   Any color development in the sample spots indicates the presence of FIV antibody or FeLV antigen in the sample.   If you have concerns about whether the vet is running the test correctly, that's something you'll have to discuss with them. If you want a second opinion, that is always your right as well.   Otherwise, I'd still play it safe until any future testing is done to clear/confirm the FeLV status of the kittens."

I read the following on the product insert that you linked:   Reaction with Negative Control The negative control spot serves as a safeguard against diagnosing false positives, and helps indicate that the assay has been run properly.  Invalid Result If color in the negative control spot is equal to or darker than the FIV antibody or FeLV antigen sample spot, the test is invalid for that spot.    The vet showed us the test and I don't recall seeing a negative control, only a positive control. Are there some versions of the test that do not include a negative control spot? Obviously I could be remembering wrong and there was a negative control."
AskVet,3bg40u,DrDead88,2,Sun Jun 28 23:36:14 2015 UTC,"If the test that you saw was the same shape/form as the one in my link for Idexx, it would have a negative control.

I have seen some tests that only have one control spot, and the product label doesn't indicate whether it's a negative or positive control. But they have a different shape/form from the Idexx test."
AskVet,3bg40u,DrDead88,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:47:06 2015 UTC,"Yes it was definitely the same shape as the Idexx one, so considering the negative control didn't show up, the conclusion is that there wasn't an issue with the test or sample?"

AskVet,3bb8ds,lemang001,2,Sat Jun 27 15:41:55 2015 UTC,Puppies aren't fully protected until they've had four sets of vaccinations so until they're about 4 months old if you've been on time with all the shots.   My vet told me to keep him away from high trafficked area and if necessary to walk him only on like concrete. I opted to just play with him indoors and walk him around my block.   Edit: I'm not a vet! I'm sorry if I'm incorrect or breaking the rules.
AskVet,3bb8ds,parakeetprincess,2,Sat Jun 27 21:48:39 2015 UTC,"Your puppy is not fully protected until he has had his full round of vaccines.  Most vets do not count vaccines given at 6 weeks because the puppy's immune system is not developed enough to respond appropriately at that age.  A total of 4 parvovirus vaccines (it is typically included in the combo vaccine referred to by many as the distemper vaccine) is the typical protocol, and since your pup had his first one at 6 weeks, he's really only had 3 that count and needs his fourth.  Your puppy should be OK to go outside in areas that are not frequented by other dogs; parvovirus can live in the environment, so I would not at all take him to a park or any other area where dogs go.  If you don't have a yard, that limits your options.  Basically if you have an outdoor area without other dogs and that other dogs do not often go to that you could exercise him in, that would be the safest.  If you don't have that sort of area, it's best to just wait until you've finished the vaccines."

AskVet,3ba0la,tablesix,17,Sat Jun 27 05:21:37 2015 UTC,"It's definitely recommended to spay your dog. Intact female dogs are significantly more likely to develop mammary cancer and they are also at risk for a condition called pyometra, which is an infection in the uterus. The uterus could fill with pus and potentially rupture. It's a life threatening condition that will then require her to be spayed. (It's possible to treat with aggressive antibiotics, but it's not as successful and often not recommended.) Once the condition gets to this point, surgery is a lot more risky and a lot more expensive. It's also worth noting to try to schedule the spay when she is not on heat because it makes the surgery a little more difficult."
AskVet,3ba0la,bexinc,3,Sat Jun 27 06:02:16 2015 UTC,"Okay, thank you for the information. Is pyometra common? And are there any issues that consistently develop specifically because a female dog has not bred, while retaining the ability to breed?   Like I said, we'll likely have her spayed either way, but it would be nice to know whether I was correctly informed. She seemed to think that too many heat cycles without pregnancy could cause harm in itself. Of course, I heard this second hand, so I can't be sure what advice was explicitly given."
AskVet,3ba0la,gm_jack,9,Sat Jun 27 06:37:12 2015 UTC,"The more heat cycles, the higher the risk of mammary cancers and of pyometra. The incidence of pyometra especially can be very high in entire females, with about a quarter getting pyo at some point before 10 years old.  While it isn't a trivial procedure, it is done for the health of the animal, and if you aren't planning on breeding, it is recommended."
AskVet,3ba0la,bexinc,2,Sat Jun 27 10:04:53 2015 UTC,"There aren't any medical advantages to breeding her instead of keeping her intact and not breeding her. In fact, breeding, whelping, and nursing come with their own set of risks. Not to mention overpopulation, pets in shelters, etc."
AskVet,3ba0la,theonlycrazyonehere,2,Sun Jun 28 02:08:26 2015 UTC,Breeding her will not have any protective effect.  The risk of pyometra and mammary cancers increases with age and heat cycles; pregnancy has no effect on this risk.  The only real options are spay or not spay; pregnancy doesn't really matter when you're considering the health benefits and risks of your choice.

And after they've had 2 or 3 cycles, there isn't much of a reduction in the risk of mammary cancer unfortunately.  But pyometra is a serious concern, and can progress very quickly.  I would definitely say that that's reason enough to do it."
AskVet,3ba0la,Urgullibl,3,Sat Jun 27 06:58:09 2015 UTC,"It depends how many heat cycles she has already had. If we're talking three or more, the effect of spaying her on her mammary cancer risk will be negligible.

AskVet,3b91t7,Wild_Red_Fox,4,Sat Jun 27 07:39:18 2015 UTC,"I did not see this brought up in the other comments (unless I overlooked it). You mentioned that the cat came home with cuts and wounds once. If he continues to escape, he may come home with worse wounds that may require treatment by a vet. A common thing that we see with cats that get loose are abscesses, which can require sedation to treat fully and a round of antibiotics (oral and/or injection(s) given by the vet) that the cat will hate taking. These wounds, more notably bites, are also how some serious health problems are transmitted.  Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV): http://www.vet.cornell.edu/fhc/Health_Information/brochure_fiv.cfm   Because biting is the most efficient means of viral transmission, free-roaming, aggressive male cats are the most frequently infected   While your boyfriend's cat may not be an aggressor, he has obviously been in a situation where he was fighting with other cats. If the other cat is infected, that is all it takes.  Similarly, Feline Leukemia (FeLV): http://www.vet.cornell.edu/fhc/Health_Information/brochure_felv.cfm  Even if the cat is vaccinated against these, he is still at risk. For similar reasons, it is why we still go in for treatment and rounds of rabies shots if we potentially come in contact with a rabid animal. It is also why we sometimes still catch the flu after getting a flu shot that year."

Aside from the insurance snafu if you injure yourself with sharp things, it's hardcore weird. I might be OK with giving you the heart or brain in preservative, but those things are not easy to remove pretty enough for a display with the tools available to the average practitioner.

AskVet,3b9vk3,InspiredByKITTENS,5,Sat Jun 27 05:02:55 2015 UTC,"On your own dog? Bad idea. Don't do it. As opposed to human autopsies, animal necropsies are not performed with the goal of maintaining the body in a presentable state at the end of the procedure.  If you want one, ask your vet for one, and ask them to preserve whatever organ you want in formaline if you are so inclined. Having your dog cremated and taking the ashes back would be a bit less graphic though.  Edit: I'll be graphic here for a moment just to demonstrate:  With the dog lying on the left side, use a sharp boning knife to make an incision on the inside of the right front leg. Cut the skin from the inside all the way to the inguinal fold and all the way to the underside of the lower jaw. Cut the humerus and scapula loose from the torso (dogs don't have a collar bone, so no bone cutting involved), and flip the front leg over the dog's back. Dislocate the hip joint, cut the ligament, and do the same for the back leg. Use secateurs to cut away the ribs to open the chest cavity. Cut around the back of the throat to remove the tongue and larynx; pull them back and out by the trachea (be careful to keep the thyroid attached to the whole thing). Remove this together with the lungs and heart and put aside.  I won't go on, but seeing this happen to the body of your beloved pet won't be interesting. It will be highly traumatic."

If you're using a mobile vet, you need a way to immediately put your dog in a cooler until the necropsy can be performed. I would suggest having him euthanized at the same place you are doing the necropsy.  Honestly, if you think it is anything like a human autopsy, you have another thing coming. There is a reason the bodies you used in anatomy in med school are anonymous to you. This is your dear loved dog. You are going to get upset as soon as the first incision is made.  Better for you to just pay for a necropsy and ask for the heart and brain preserved in jars of formalin. By the way, a standard necropsy usually involves slicing open the heart to examine for abnormalities. In order to get the brain out, you would most likely need to get a veterinary pathologist to perform the necropsy as they have the necessary tools that most general practitioners do not."
AskVet,3b9vk3,littlehamsterz,0,Sat Jun 27 12:44:38 2015 UTC,Getting the brain out is pretty easy. All you need is a pair of strong pliers to break away the cranium starting at the foramen magnum  Which is part of why having OP watch this is probably a really bad idea.

AskVet,3b9bfv,ironmouse,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:23:53 2015 UTC,"No. I know we should have, but she's been very sensitive since we picked her up from the pound. She a lot better now than than, but she still refuses to be picked up or put in the car. If we do, she starts biting.   I guess we could put a muzzle on her, but it would terrify her."

AskVet,3b8fjr,AppleRatty,3,Fri Jun 26 20:26:33 2015 UTC,"It varies from vaccine to vaccine depending on what the manufacturers have tested. Some of them last longer than tested, but at some point it isn't worth the extra costs.  Personally I say 3 months for overdue vaccines that aren't required by law. Some vaccines by law are required to be started again if late by even 1 week here. It's worth checking."
AskVet,3b8ej5,Goat_187,3,Fri Jun 26 20:18:56 2015 UTC,"In my experience as a vet tech, I saw more complications and repeated surgeries with what is called ""extra-cap"", or extra-capsular suture stabilization surgery, especially in overweight dogs.  From this perspective, if repeated repairs are necessary, the TPLO being performed once is likely more cost efficient.  The TPLO or TTA are the preferred methods, and it's my opinion that the TPLO has the better recovery rate based on a coworkers dog who had a TPLO on one knee and a TTA on the other (but this could vary on a case-by-case basis, I'm sure).  The important part of any procedure is the pain management and being strict with the recovery process.  I hope he feels better soon!"

AskVet,3b6gnz,ironmouse,2,Fri Jun 26 11:47:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, it warrants a vet visit. If it is a skin infection, it needs treatment via your vet.  It doesn't need to be an emergency visit, but if you can get him in today or tomorrow it would be ideal."
AskVet,3b7bfe,madmonarch,2,Fri Jun 26 15:33:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not a vet. However, I know (from reading on here) that cat bites can get infected and fester very easily. If you can give him a thorough inspection and don't find any open wounds or signs of discomfort then I wouldn't be alarmed. However, if you find (or suspect) that he has any puncture wounds, then you should bring him to the vet as soon as possible.  On the other hand, you need to either get him a new carrier, that doesn't have the same negative connotations, or get him accustomed to the existing one. Being able to get him to the vet in an emergency is vital to his health. It's going to take longer than a week to get him used to a carrier and we're usually the ones who create the negative association with it :( Mainly by trying to force them into a small space they don't recognise and locking them in there!  For starters, leave the carrier in an unobtrusive place, but open, where he can access it. Leave it there for a few weeks. Next, move it to a location that he has to pass regularly. Again, leave it for a few weeks (or longer), until he treats it like any other part of the furniture. Next, move his food bowl closer to it. Repeat after a fortnight. Keep repeating until the food bowl is beside the carrier. Now throw some of the tastier treats into the carrier. He's already learned to ignore it, now he needs to learn to interact with it in a positive manner. Don't lock him in, let him come and go as he pleases. When he's comfortable, set him up with a blanket (that already has his scent and have it as a chill out area. All of this should be spaced out over several months. Eventually you will have a cat that thinks of the carrier as a safe place, this is what you want when he's being brought to the scary vet's office!  I had rodents whose carrier was part of their play area. They could go laze in it whenever they wanted when they were out exploring. It meant that rounding them up for a vet visit was hassle free. They had no qualms about getting into the carrier. At the vets, when they were taken out for examination, they hopped straight back into the carrier as soon as the vet put them down. Much better than having them leap off the table and make a run for the door!"
AskVet,3b7bfe,Durshka,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:58:50 2015 UTC,"You just described in detail the exact system I used to get him in the first time lol. I mean it's exact.   The carrier is in the closet and open which is his safe spot (the closet, not the carrier). He still won't go inside willingly. There's always a soft blanket in there but he's never been partial to any blanket particularly. Treats are his weakness and how I would need to coax him in. He always keeps his back legs out but last time I cornered him when he went in for treats and was able to close the cage when he tried to turn around inside.   Will most likely have to do the same thing again."
AskVet,3b7bfe,Durshka,2,Fri Jun 26 16:19:37 2015 UTC,"You're repeating a bad process, you need to have the food in the carrier without you waiting to trick him and slam it closed behind him. You also mentioned waiting a week for him to get climatised to it before. A week is nothing to a cat. A week is ""okay, I don't think this thing is gonna bite me in the ass"" and then it bit him in the ass and took his testicles.  Desensitising him to something he dislikes is going to take much longer. If he doesn't particularly like a blanket, make it smell like him. Rub him down with it and then stick it in the carrier. Cats like things that smell like them, hence why they're constantly rubbing their smell on us.  The carrier's not going to help in this instance and you'll probably end up scratched to bits with a pissed off cat, but look up some cat behaviour guides for the next trip so that it'll be less stressful for both of you!"
AskVet,3b7bfe,Durshka,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:42:40 2015 UTC,"I see your point. In this situation, I might have to force him and deal with the consequences if need be. But I'll work on acclimating him to the carrier for future trips. Thanks for your advise :)"

There is a microchip based (assuming your cat is microchipped) or possibly even collar based automatic feeder that only opens for the designated cat.

AskVet,3b4pov,salty-lemons,5,Thu Jun 25 23:14:07 2015 UTC,"Urine specific gravity might be helpful potentially. Better yet a full urinalysis.  Ultrasound and/or radiographs of urinary and repro tracts may help to check for masses.  Checking for hyperadenocorticism might help as well. It is like an OD on steroids. Makes you pee more and the steroids are catabolic and causes breakdown of stuff hence weight loss. There's a few ways to test for it such as a low dose dex suppression test. Basically your vet gives your dog steroids. Theoretically, this would shut the adrenals up if the system is flooded with steroids. If the adrenals don't feel like listening, they will keep making cortisol and the levels will go up in spite of the dex."
AskVet,3b4pov,littlehamsterz,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:34:09 2015 UTC,"So the vet did a full urinalysis.  The specific gravity was low but all of her kidney functions came back fine.

You can check on them if you want, but they'll be best served by letting them live their little Greek cat lives. Maybe make a donation to a local animal shelter in their honor while you're there, one that promotes spay/neuter practices."
AskVet,3b4707,loiderer,6,Thu Jun 25 20:47:56 2015 UTC,"Prices can range widely between clinics even those in close proximity.  Prices have about 68949503 considering, 99% of which your average pet owner doesn't care about and doesn't want to understand.  If you are concerned about pricing, call around and get other estimates.  But be upfront and mention that tooth needing an extraction and the growth.  Regarding that particular estimate it looks about right to me.  ""Grade 3"" generally means your dog's mouth is 2 steps from trench rot and they are guessing at least a carnassial extraction probably others.  The lab fee is pretty close to ours and is the only way to answer the questions, what is that growth? will it come back? is it cancer?   My clinic gets calls like this all the time.  So we then make up an estimate based on what we would do and then put a range on it that is double if not more since we are working blind.  More often than not, the final bill approaches the original estimate."
AskVet,3b4707,Neryian,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:09:46 2015 UTC,"thanks,    that's exactly what i'm going to do. I've noticed this particular vet usually underestimates what the final cost really is so it well end up probably around $2500 realistically.  Anyway thanks for the advice"
AskVet,3b2nwx,carlfmichel,3,Thu Jun 25 14:01:57 2015 UTC,I'd go for a consult with a board certified surgeon. It could be laryngeal paralysis causing the gagging noises. For some reason I've seen a several vets who can't/don't diagnose LarPar. As for the joints--did they run a tick-borne disease panel?
AskVet,3b2nwx,Ruth_Gordon,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:31:59 2015 UTC,Thank you for you advice! I will definitely check into LarPar and mention it to our vet. Thanks again.
AskVet,3b2nwx,Wild_Red_Fox,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:54:26 2015 UTC,Is your dog up to date on worming treatments? It could be a case of lungworm although they are pretty rare they can present with cough and are very hard to diagnoses.  A faecal egg count can come up negative and we find that it's much easier to just treat anyway as no harm can come from appropriately worming a dog.  I would recommend Milbemax tablets or Advocate spot on if you are in the UK.
AskVet,3b2nwx,Wild_Red_Fox,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:45:09 2015 UTC,"I will have to check with my family to see about the worming treatment. Thank you for your expertise, we really appreciate it! Have a good one."

AskVet,3b3n1u,throwaway72486,5,Thu Jun 25 18:22:07 2015 UTC,"I'd say hiding and inappetence with vomiting for 24 hours are pretty significant signs. You should get him into your/a vet ASAP, ER if needed."
AskVet,3b3n1u,DrDead88,0,Thu Jun 25 18:34:08 2015 UTC,"The vet I was using let my other cat die, so I will not be taking him back there. I'm in the process of trying to find another vet. I also am pretty much broke right now, and if it costs anything up front I simply don't have the money for it."
AskVet,3b3n1u,always_onward,4,Thu Jun 25 18:45:02 2015 UTC,Unfortunately it will cost money to get veterinary care for your cat. There is a company called CareCredit that offers a limited-time interest-free credit card that can be used to pay for expenses like veterinary and dental care.   It sounds like your cat is very sick. Do you know for sure if he has urinated in the past 24 hours?
AskVet,3b3n1u,always_onward,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:48:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, I realize that. I have a little bit of credit left on a credit card but I just didn't want to bring it up all the way. I guess I will have to.  I clean his litter box daily and yes, it had been used when I woke up this morning. I gave him some water through a syringe, so I will keep an eye out to see if he uses it."
AskVet,3b2qzo,GamingChick-Roshea,4,Thu Jun 25 14:26:46 2015 UTC,"It still may be dental disease, despite the brushing. The vet will definitely be able to assess this. Do you happen to know what toothpaste you are using? We recommend dental products that have the VOHC Seal as they are more likely to work.   As far as the coughing, it may be unrelated. Does he wear a harness or collar, does he pull at it when he walks? Any vomitus ever come up? It may be something like a collapsing trachea, but it could be a sign of heart or lung disease, which again, the vet should be able to differentiate and go from there."
AskVet,3b2qzo,DrDead88,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:15:57 2015 UTC,"I have been using Nylabone toothpaste with Kodi. I also have Biotene veterinary toothpaste available. As far as tethers go, he only wears his easy walker harness when he is out for a walk or shopping with me. He is quite the puller with a regular collar. Kodi rarely vomits with his coughing fits."
AskVet,3b2qzo,Wild_Red_Fox,2,Thu Jun 25 17:29:26 2015 UTC,"Your vet might be able to provide you with the equivalent of dog mouthwash from your vet (contains chlorhexidine solution) which goes in the water as a mild antibacterial.   A veterinary toothpaste is also a valid option, as they tend to be of higher quality than the ones from the pet shop.  You could potentially try a dietary change to see if that makes any difference, or if you really do think that there is a foreign body you vet can do a concious oral exam, or for a more thorough look you could have a sedation/ general anaesthetic. These options are best discussed with your current veterinarian.  Foreign bodies in the mouth are possible, though I would think it more likely if the dog had a habit of chewing sticks (splinters) or eating things that it shouldn't (chicken bone splinters.)  Coughing can also be a symmptom of a number of other conditions but the one that would concern me most at this time would be lungworm if you were in the UK. I'm not sure if lungworm is prevalent in Canada but to be honest if the dog hasn't been wormed with a veterinary product in the last 3 months, it isn't going to hurt to do that."
AskVet,3b2qzo,bexinc,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:00:55 2015 UTC,I live in Canada; heartworm is more prevalent here. All my pets get heartworm medication each year.
AskVet,3b1uua,gemkid,3,Thu Jun 25 08:03:20 2015 UTC,What do you feed him and does he have anything else to chew on in his cage?
AskVet,3b1uua,chulaire,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:27:29 2015 UTC,"He eats guinea pig pellets (I'm rather tired so I can't check the brand right now) and gets veggies every day, and hay, of course. He usually has a chew toy, though I need to buy more, and there's almost always a carrot or something similar to chew on."
AskVet,3b1uua,Stantron,2,Thu Jun 25 09:03:32 2015 UTC,Wood. Put some wood in there
AskVet,3b1uua,Wild_Red_Fox,2,Thu Jun 25 22:56:22 2015 UTC,"Ok so you have a few option here. Firstly, due to the way that their guts are designed, guinea pigs and rabbits should get the majority of their calories from good quality hay and not from pellet feeds. I would suggest providing hay for them to eat to begin with, and then as they start to eat it, cut back a little on the pellets. Hay will take longer to munch through and they can dig around in it.  You can make boredom breaker toys for them with hay and toilet roll tubes/ cardboard boxes. So instead of putting their pellets in a bow, put them in a cardboard tube then bung the ends up with hay so that they have to think and root about to find it.  Bitter apply spray on the bars is fine as far as I am aware (I have used it before with a hamster and had no problem) though please wait for it to dry before letting the pigs near it.  Finally behaviour. These days it is possible to castrate guinea pigs and it can (although there is no guarantee) decrease aggressive behaviour. I only mention this because guinea pigs are social creatures who like to live in a group, so if you can keep them together they would likely be happier. Obviously you have to weigh up the risk of this with that of them hurting each other and that will be a judgement call for you.  A final note: guinea pigs cannot synthesis vitamin C and are very susceptible to getting low levels so please provide them with fresh grass (no pesticides), dark leafy greens and a food specifically for guinea pigs (contains much higher vitamin C than rabbit food.)  If you have any questions feel free to message me and good luck =)"
AskVet,3b0yzo,Chris_Tehtopher,4,Thu Jun 25 02:22:42 2015 UTC,Sounds like he's trying to vomit. How is his eating? Do you have him on a new flea medication? Best bet is to have him checked out by a vet in case there's a blockage.
AskVet,3b0yzo,geneticlemon,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:34:44 2015 UTC,He is eating like he always has. Yeah I put K9 Advantix II on him as soon as I saw the fleas. He picked them up from my parents house and they died off within a day for the most part.
AskVet,3b0yzo,geneticlemon,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:39:52 2015 UTC,I would at least call the vet and describe the symptoms. Some large breed dogs are prone to bloat.
AskVet,3b1wl2,dannyguk,3,Thu Jun 25 08:28:36 2015 UTC,Do you know which kind of operation he had? There is potential for him to have damaged the implant. I'd be calling the vet who did the operation to see what they suggest. They may want to see him today.
AskVet,3b1wl2,dashclone,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:31:41 2015 UTC,"Not sure if the name of the operation, but it involved some kind of thread (nylon maybe) going across the outside of the joint. I'll give the vet ring now and see if they can book him in.  Thanks"
AskVet,3b1wl2,Wild_Red_Fox,2,Thu Jun 25 12:40:18 2015 UTC,"It sounds like he might have had an extra-capsular suture which is a common way to fix cruciate tears in smaller dogs.  I recommend going to the vet tomorrow so that they can check the range of movement in his abnormal knee. Then if he hasn't done any serious damage your vet might consider a course of dog anti-inflammatories. (NEVER USE HUMAN MEDICATIONS IN DOGS AS RISK OF DEATH) and at least a week of strict rest, no more chasing sheep;) Good luck."
AskVet,3b1m3u,druidofnecro,2,Thu Jun 25 06:07:12 2015 UTC,"Do not try to give your cat any pain medication unless prescribed by a vet. Most of the pain meds humans use at home can and will very easily kill a cat.  Hard to know what's actually going on with his canine without a proper examination. Possibly the only thing you can do is wait until that Friday appointment and in the meantime, you can soak his dry food in water to soften it up or just feed it canned food."
AskVet,3b1m3u,chulaire,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:47:03 2015 UTC,"Exactly what u//chulaire said. Please do not give any human medications to the cat. Even a seemingly small dose of human ibuprofen can kill a cat.  There is no need to examine it again, especially if it is painful. Feed soft food or maybe some torm up strips of chicken. Just something that is easy for the cat to eat until friday.  On friday I would withold food from 8pm the night before the vets in case they need to sedate/full GA him on the day. (If he has eaten that day he might vomit when under anaesthetic and there is a risk of aspiration into the lungs which can be very serious.)  Good luck! And I'm sure you wouldn't but please don't be tempted to take it out yourself. Canine teeth are supplied by a lot of nerves and it would be incredibly painful."
AskVet,3b2b2n,Dovakhbear,2,Thu Jun 25 11:57:29 2015 UTC,This is not something we could ever answer.  To even potentially find out you would need loads of blood work and biopsies of affected tissues/organs (which would have been taken at the time of surgery).

AskVet,3b2b2n,Wild_Red_Fox,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:11:54 2015 UTC,"The best way to find out what kind of poison it was (if it was rat poison from you neighbour) is to ask them! It will be much quicker and effective than a blood test.   There are a number of different types of rat poison. Firstly you have anticoagulants (Warfarin + Congeners). These prevent vitamin K from working and this stop the blood from clotting. This can cause uncontrolled bleeding at any site of the body or internal organs. There can be nonspecific signs but pale mucous membranes are almost always present.  Option 2 is Bromethalin and it is a neurotoxin. You tend to get neuro signs like ataxia, temours and siezures.  Option 3 is Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) which in small doses is used as a supplement, but at larger ones can be a rodenticide.  And finally there are Zinc phosphate and strychnine however the first is pretty hrd to get poisoned with, and if it were strychnine the dog would have died shortly after ingestion.   SO. Please ask you neighbour what they have put in their garden. Not just rat bait but maybe slug pellets, pesticides, fertilisers etc. Sadly there are a lot of potential poisons for dogs and without more information this is the best that I can do. I hope you get to the bottom of it!"
AskVet,3b168d,TyphoidLarry,3,Thu Jun 25 03:24:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not a veterinarian, but I am a certified veterinary technician and can guide you to the best of my abilities.   Firstly, please take your cat back to the vet ASAP - consider getting diagnostics done, which are truly necessary with a cat that is acting the way you described. Radiographs, a full panel of bloodwork, and a urinalysis should provide your veterinarian with enough information to help you with the next steps. If there have not been any diagnostics done yet, I can't tell you much with what's going on exactly.  Cats vomit for multiple reasons (ie IBD, kidney disease, foreign body ingestion, etc). So how do we find out what is going on with your baby? - Diagnostics.   Also, I'm quite concerned he's acting restless and vomiting up liquid still. How often does your kitty vomit? And how many times has he vomited today? If he has vomited more than 3-5 times today, this is considered severe vomiting, which is a serious matter.  Hope this helps."
AskVet,3b168d,gelloz,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:17:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply. Would you happen to know what the price of diagnostics tends to be? Whatever it is, I'll pay it, but my girlfriend and I are below the poverty line right now.  If he's ever vomited before, I've never seen it. He's probably vomited upwards of five times this evening. He seems like he's stopped though.  The restlessness seems to have been short lived as he's just sitting on the window sill for now and is acting like himself.  Is it possible this is a hairball? I've read about cats having a hard time regurgitating them and occasionally vomiting, but not this badly.  Thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it. I'll be making a vet appointment tomorrow morning."

Diagnostics are costly, but WELL worth every penny to help figure out what's going on; I would say everything can be up to $800 - but that's worst case scenario. Usually hacking up a hairball doesn't coincide with severe vomiting, which is what you were describing. I hope the kitty is doing okay!"

If still nothing, skip a day and then try again until you figure out which cat it is. Keep food, water and a litter box in the room of the separated cat. It's not going to hurt them to spend one day in a room - they can spend many days in cages at a clinic without any detrimental effect.

It often isn't a case of them healing, rather we supplement or take over the function of that ligament with surgical implants or through physiotherapy.  To answer the rest of your questions:  Wrapping the joint won't help, it may do more harm than good. Bandages aren't sturdy enough to mimic the action of a ligament holding a joint together and they may rub causing more injury.  Ice would potentially help, but anti-inflammatory drugs from the vet would help more to relieve the pain and inflammation at the source.   Protein in the diet also won't help as it doesn't automatically know where to go and build muscle. If your dog is sore and not exercising as much it will just get converted to fats or get broken down and excreted in the urine. Extra weight on an already-sore body isn't helpful.  Physiotherapy and/or hydrotherapy might help build muscle in the sore limb and help her cope better with it by adjusting her position.   Sorry about the essay!"
AskVet,3azms1,dashclone,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:27:37 2015 UTC,The vet definitely recommend against surgery. I'll see if I can convince them to at least apply some ice.   Thanks!
AskVet,3azms1,Wild_Red_Fox,2,Wed Jun 24 20:31:40 2015 UTC,"Please don't attempt any bandaging! For one it won't help and secondly it's surprisingly easy to get it wrong and do more harm than good.  Yes to the supplements to protect her joints. If it is a cruciate rupture then there is no harm in getting a second opinion.  Your vet can provide anti-inflammatories, and you should think about exercise restriction whilst she is healing. Dogs can be a little bit dim, and when they feel better they don't have the sense to take it easy. In my opinion a dog with a damaged cruciate/joint injury should not be allowed off the lead whilst symptoms persist. I would say to confine her as much as you can, short lead walks to go to the toilet and definitely nothing that will make her twist her knees, like playing fetch for example. Good luck!"
AskVet,3azms1,Wild_Red_Fox,2,Thu Jun 25 18:04:35 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely glad I checked before trying to bandage it, so don't worry about that. She's definitely being allowed plenty of rest and is taking the joint supplement every day."
AskVet,3b0f4d,stanley_hudson15,5,Wed Jun 24 23:34:43 2015 UTC,Any change in urination habits warrant a vet visit.
AskVet,3b0f4d,ironmouse,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:52:16 2015 UTC,"How long ago was his surgery? It sounds like he had a procedure called a femoral head and neck excision. This means that instead of his femur being stabilised by the pelvis, his leg is held in place by muscle and connective tissue only.  I would definitely take him in to get checked out by your vet given his history of a major procedure. It could be that he is struggling to squat due to hip pain. Not knowing what his surgery was for, it's possible that he now has a problem with the other hip and it is making it difficult for him to use the litter box.  Please get him checked out as there are lots of things that can cause change to urination including metabolic disorders, infections etc. Please let us know how he gets on and good luck."
AskVet,3azknf,BUCKEYEIXI,3,Wed Jun 24 19:42:59 2015 UTC,"While chronic kidney disease (CKD) is ultimately fatal, it can be slowly progressive, depending on the stage and the cat. Stage 2 is one of the longer/most stable stages.   Your vet likely has a plan, and I would follow it. While parts of it can be expensive (diet, for one) it can really help slow the progression, should he take to it (cats are very finicky). Anything you can do to encourage drinking water (water fountains, wet food, etc) is also helpful, as are any adjunct therapies depending on your boy (whether he has hypertension, elevated phosphorous, etc).   I'd also urge you/your family to make him indoor only, if you can. In general, indoor only cats live longer, as they have fewer threats and diseases to defend against.   If you have the bloodwork to upload online, that would help us as far as prognosis goes. Typically CKD isn't uncomfortable until later stages, where the buildup of waste byproducts can cause nausea/vomiting, GI ulceration, and other issues. If you're not graduating next spring though, the chances aren't as good unfortunately. Every patient is different though.   Sorry for the bad news for you and your family, but there is a lot that can be done to make him comfortable longer."
AskVet,3azknf,DrDead88,2,Wed Jun 24 21:23:56 2015 UTC,"wow thank you!   My mom took him to the vet today, so when i get home from work ill see what details i can find out. You said to make him totally indoor, and while this may seem like a stupid question, is it ok if he hangs out on the porch? or should we completely keep him contained inside?"
AskVet,3azknf,DrDead88,3,Wed Jun 24 21:30:26 2015 UTC,"Hanging out on the porch is fine, it's the unsupervised prowling of the neighborhood that is an issue. If you have a fenced in yard, letting him walk around there supervised would be fine too (as long as he can't jump/bolt the fence). You just don't want him to go missing and get injured, contract a disease/parasites, etc."
AskVet,3azknf,Wild_Red_Fox,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:34:24 2015 UTC,"I'd like to second getting as much water as you can into the cat, and this is the one time that I would recommend a wet diet over biscuits (more moisture).  There are a number of veterinary kidney diets out there, and they are worth persevering with because they have been proven to extend life. If he won't eat kidney diet under any circumstances you could try a senior food combined with a liquid phosphate binder.   We are aiming for a moderate quantity of high quality protein, low phosphorus and low sodium.  I've seen a number of renal failure cases and in the early days they can be completely comfortable. Things that you should watch out for are if he stops eating or if he gets dehydrated (you can gently pinch and lift the skin of his scruff, if it snaps back down quickly it means that he is hydrated, if it is sluggish or stays tented up then you should get to the vet immediately for fluid therapy. Feel free to practice now whilst he is hydrated then you'll be able to tell the difference.)  Like all chronic diseases, the end stage is where we focus entirely on quality of life. As his kidneys fail, metabolites and toxins will build up in his body and he'll feel unwell. Once he stops eating and starts losing weight, this is the time that you might want to consider letting him go. Ultimately it's up to you to make a judgement about his quality of life, and you'll know when the right time is.  But for now, make sure he eats his kidney food, drinks a lot and be on the lookout for dehydration and signs of a urinary infection (painful urination, urinating more often, straining to urinate, urinating in unusual places, licking his bits more often etc.) Good luck and I hope that he isn't a fussy eater =)"

I don't recommend giving it to them.   Buprenorphine is remarkably free of adverse effects. Sedation, vomiting, and respiratory depression are rarely seen with buprenorphine.

AskVet,3awspx,socalfusions,6,Wed Jun 24 03:18:43 2015 UTC,"If you are going to put her under for the tongue repair, you might as well do at lease some of the dental stuff (I.e. If she has any broken or really diseased teeth that need extracting) if she is doing well under anesthesia.  Anesthesia is not completely benign, but age in and of itself is not a disease.  I personally haven't seen anything similar to this, but I would imagine that it's very painful and probably would be difficult to heal without some kind of intervention.  It's never wrong to get a second opinion if you're not satisfied with the original plan, but you can also ask the first vet if there are any other options.  Post an update if you can, I'll be really interested to hear what you end up doing!"
AskVet,3awspx,CoopertheBKE,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:04:44 2015 UTC,According to the vet her teeth looked good as I had initially thought she had stomatitis so the vet inspected her gums and teeth and said there were no signs of inflammation. It does seem very painful for her as she continues to bite that area of her tongue whenever she eats and painfully yowls all the time when not on the buprenophrine. I will ask my vet about other possible options but I do have a feeling that surgery may be the best course to repair the laceration as it has gotten pretty bad.   I will certainly update Kula's progress and hopefully she can overcome this ailment.
AskVet,3awspx,Kaydalia,5,Wed Jun 24 14:49:13 2015 UTC,"Although one picture is by far an incomplete assessment - that looks like a nasty laceration.  I completely agree that a surgical correction is in order. This is not something that can be healed via holistic means... your cat needs a debridement and suturing ASAP as cats do not usually cope well if a large portion of their tongue is lost (whether it be to trauma or infection). I can easily believe you're getting a deal because they are pricing it under a dental anesthesia, so while this may not actually be a dental procedure (because that would likely expose the wound to bacteria), it may be the best option financially.  As a side note, such a procedure would be MUCH more expensive at my referral/specialist facility (>1500 easy), so from my perspective this is a steal. A lot of money yes, but what your cat needs.   This is trauma - and thus may have a good prognosis for recovery (I can't comment too much based on one picture). If you don't have the money, euthanasia is a reasonable option if Kula is in pain/suffering. But, again based on one photo, repair may be possible as well and, thus, substantially prolong life. However a quick repair is very important - the longer the portion of tongue affected has a compromised blood supply, the more likely it will be lose due to necrosis.

While we aren't entirely sure about the transmission/pathogensis of FIP (here's a good link for info) the most popular theory is that the virus must mutate from the fairly harmless coronavirus into the FIP-causing virus, within each individual cat. The best thing you can do is make sure that Ozil is otherwise healthy, so that his immune system can deal with any viruses and their mutations.

Try to put all your data into excel and make a curve. It'll be easier to interpret.  The reason your cat's diabetes only stays controlled for about 6 hours is that NPH does not last long enough in cats. It is human recombinant. This drug only lasts generally about 4-6 hrs in cats. It tends to work better in dogs. It is also the cheapest option. Most vets suggest trying out NPH first because expense is a concern for most clients and sometimes it does work for cats.  Now that you know it does not work, you will need to ask a new vet to try a different insulin product such as PZI or Vetsulin or Glargine. Alternatively they may suggest increasing dosage of the NPH as a trial. Just keep in mind most of the alternative products are more expensive than NPH."

Also, is the rebound to 23.4 and then lowering again to 21.7 prior to getting her insulin okay, or could that be suggesting that her dose might be too high?

Could also mix a small amount of the canned version in with the dry to increase palatability  I do not suggest home cooked unless you can work with a veterinary nutritionist to create a diet and stick to it to a tee. It would take some serious dedication on your part to ensure a balanced diet.  I cannot speak to reasonableness of the curve. Not a vet yet!"
AskVet,3ass4e,goatsickle,3,Tue Jun 23 21:12:53 2015 UTC,"You're going to find that a lot of vets disagree with this.  There are only a few dry foods that have ever been shown to make any difference in terms of dental disease - most disintegrate before they can do any work to scrape off tartar.  Even if they do help a bit, most feline specialists would still prefer that they be on wet food because of the appropriate macronutrient ratios, additional fluid intake, etc.  Just an FYI - not that you're wrong, necessarily, just that there's a lot of controversy in the field."
AskVet,3ass4e,littlehamsterz,2,Tue Jun 23 21:47:47 2015 UTC,Good to know thanks!  Would the dry be a decent choice due to cost limitations of OP? I would just mix in water or some canned for moisture content.
AskVet,3ass4e,goatsickle,2,Tue Jun 23 22:40:54 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, I think the prescription dry is fine and has worked well for some of my patients.  I've just had better luck getting cats into full remission with the super low carb wet foods...take that with a grain of salt (as you would from any vet saying ""well this works for me"")."
AskVet,3ass4e,goatsickle,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:55:53 2015 UTC,"The super low carb wet foods, are those the prescription high fibre foods, or are they the low carb high protein ones?  Do you have a preference for foods to suggest, wet and dry?  I've looked at the catinfo.org site a lot and there seems to be a lot of reference to a high protein low carb diet being better overall and having a higher chance of remission when compared to the high fibre ones.  Do you have any opinions regarding that suggestion?"
AskVet,3ass4e,goatsickle,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:53:03 2015 UTC,"Sorry, just logged back on.  In dogs, fiber tends to be very important in controlling diabetes.  In cats, it's the low carb diet that does it.  From my experience, anyway.  My preference is EVO.  Cats and their owners seem to really approve of it.  But I'm fine with any AAFCO approved food with the right macro nutrient balance."
AskVet,3ass4e,rvtjess,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:41:11 2015 UTC,Thank you for your help and suggestions.
AskVet,3ass4e,goatsickle,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:03:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed - and based on the curve, increasing the NPH dose would not be appropriate.  Would likely result in hypoglycemia and/or somogyi rebound."
AskVet,3ass4e,goatsickle,4,Tue Jun 23 21:57:27 2015 UTC,"First off, thank you for the formatting, or makes reading it so much better!   Secondly, I'm so sorry you're having a rough time with this. The lack of communication on your vet's part is unprofessional at best. I would strongly recommend you find another very who doesn't give you the run around."
AskVet,3ass4e,goatsickle,2,Tue Jun 23 05:58:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  I figured if I was asking for help, I better make it as easy on anyone willing to help as possible.  I think I will be looking for a new vet, which is disappointing because I have been with this vet for better than 10 years.  Thank you for your recommendation."
AskVet,3ass4e,CoopertheBKE,2,Tue Jun 23 20:01:45 2015 UTC,"Another basic recommendation - you can be more proactive about calling the vet.  If they say they'll get to you by a certain day and don't, just call the next day.  Some vets are crazy busy (or must may be forgetful about that kind of thing).  I know if I made a promise and forgot I'd want a client to call me instead of just letting it go for days or weeks while getting angry about it and dealing with a pet that isn't getting better."
AskVet,3ass4e,CoopertheBKE,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:12:50 2015 UTC,"I completely understand where you are coming from here.  I get that vets are busy out of their minds.  I have emailed her 5 times and have called her previously, she told me she would call the next day and didn't.  But I took your advice and called her again.  Eventually she got back to me.  According to her, the curve looks great and she doesn't really think I will see any better on another insulin.  She thinks the peeing and pooping issues are either food allergy, or behavioural, or parasitic in nature and that I should try a couple weeks on an anti-inflammatory (meta something zone) and see if that fixes it (I have 4 cats, all indoor cats and none of the others are having issues like this, and I really don't like coincidental assumptions in this case).  When I suggested that I was worried that we were looking at diabetic neuropathy, I was told that she had never seen a case of it because they get the cats controlled so quickly and that the symptoms only occur in uncontrolled cats.  Since she thinks my curve is just fine, she doesn't think that could be the problem.  My cat is still ending up with urine under and around the litter boxes and pooping in random places, including right behind me while I'm changing their water.  I'm hitting my head against a brick wall because I love this cat, but I am just ending up resenting her and it sucks.  I am scared to try another vet because I am worried they will agree that her curve is fine and I will have flushed money down the drain and still have the same problems occurring.  This just isn't sustainable and I'm terrified that, if her glucose doesn't get under control, I'm just slowly killing her and that is just cruel and I won't tolerate being cruel to my kitty.  Sorry for the wall of text and sob story, I am just at my wits end."
AskVet,3ariof,Ninja-iris,16,Mon Jun 22 22:42:49 2015 UTC,"Intact females are at risk for a life-threatening infection called pyometra, which is an emergency.  Granted, they only bleed for about a week when they're in heat, at which point they go into the 2nd phase of their heat cycle where they may have a straw-colored discharge. Females are technically fertile in the phase AFTER they finish bleeding.  It's a good thing you have a vet visit, but the lethargy and inappetance is very very concerning. If you're able to get her in sooner I would try. Pyometras can be bad."
AskVet,3ariof,rvtjess,6,Mon Jun 22 23:05:25 2015 UTC,"UPDATE! so I went to the vet and she was amazing and really nice.   It turned out she had an open infection in her uterus, and the vet recommended removal of uterus due to her history and age.   She is okay now, she is sleeping besides me, operaton went well, alltho the vet said the dog had some scarring (?) on her fallopian tubes that most likely came from previous infections. I'm happy with my decision even tho surgery is never an easy choice, since she has been troubled by uterus infection before and it often comes back.   Now we hope for a quick and easy recovery.   Thanks :)"
AskVet,3ariof,rvtjess,3,Tue Jun 23 17:26:56 2015 UTC,"That's AWESOME, glad to hear it went well. Open pyometras are better than closed pyos, but both can be life threatening. I'm very glad you were able to catch it and she is now on the mend."
AskVet,3ariof,ironmouse,3,Tue Jun 23 19:16:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I called the vet and they couldn't get me in sooner, so I called another vet and they have time for me soon. After I hung up on the vet I discovered a tick in her neck skin (don't know how long it's been there, I try to check her everyday but there is a lot of skin folds on this bulldog) so now I'm worried it might be a tick disease.   She is a bit better today, she is drinking and she follows me around. I'm still eager to see the vet and get help for my girl!   I'll update after the vet if you like to know what happened."
AskVet,3as4gw,cheesecake21,3,Tue Jun 23 01:50:38 2015 UTC,"Sounds like it could very well be a neurological problem or even a slipped disc secondary to trauma.  Don't shy away from a follow up xray or MRI even - I know they don't come cheap, but they're really just photos taken at one moment, and over time injuries can become more obvious so what was captured a day ago can be drastically different the next day.  Pinching of the spinal cord will affect his hind legs and often their ability to poo and pee.   Don't have harnesses on them at home. It's not safe...they often get caught on things around the house and even more so if they're outside. Harness wearing should be supervised (like only during walks or play)."
AskVet,3as4gw,chulaire,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:14:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply!  Neurological is what I was leaning more towards as well, however the emergency vet seemed to think his issue was not connected with the accident.    His spine seems non-sensitive to palpation, would he have pain there or would his sensation of pain be skewed due to it being neurologic issue?    How long is it an issue for him to not be using the bathroom?  I've worked in a vet clinics and know the horrors of a blocked cat, and I really don't want him to become blocked on top of all these other issues.  Since he has peed in the last 24 hours is he at as much risk for a block?  Is there anything I can do to help stimulate him to go to the bathroom until I get him in tomorrow?  Thanks again for replying."
AskVet,3as4gw,chulaire,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:57:22 2015 UTC,"If he's peeing, then it's not nearly as urgent. Is he still eating a lot?   Not pooing for 3 days is ok...not immediately life threatening but definitely needs to be treated.   You can try using a towel under his back legs (supporting his abdomen area) as a sling and see if he'll poo and pee in the litter box.   Be prepared they may need to knock him out and give him an enema and/or catheterise him.  Also consider seeking referral to a specialist if they don't get to the bottom of it."
AskVet,3arbet,we3ble,6,Mon Jun 22 21:46:41 2015 UTC,"Not just a shelter situation...as vets we see sick animals all day and can easily transfer these diseases to our pets at home.   The best way to prevent is to have a scrub top or uniform that you only wear at work and leave at work. Most, if not all, shelters and clinics will have their own washing machines. Getting changed first thing when you get home is great too.  I've never had issues with my cat contracting upper respiratory infections, but the most commonly transferred infection I see is ringworm (however this really is dependant on your cat's immune system).  Make sure you disinfect your hands and arms properly before you leave the shelter.   FeLV and FIV shouldn't be problems unless you start to bring shelter cats home or your cat to the shelter."
AskVet,3arbet,chulaire,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:26:30 2015 UTC,"They don't have enough space for us to leave things there. I plan on having a dedicated volunteer outfit, and changing/showering as soon as I get home. I'll keep those clothes separate from the other laundry.   That's good to know about ringworm. Is there an easy way to tell if a cat has it? I understand that we can get it too, right?"
AskVet,3arbet,deathmonkey,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:42:10 2015 UTC,"Does that mean that your cat has contracted ringworm from your office at some point?  I'm in the same boat as OP. Very concerned about putting my own cat's health at risk through volunteering. I would rather volunteer with cats, since that's what the shelter needs most right now, but I can work with dogs instead if that's safer.  Thanks for your advice!"
AskVet,3arbet,chulaire,3,Tue Jun 23 18:30:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, as have I. Any time your own immune system is down due to stress or illness, you are at risk of picking up ringworm from an infected animal. You can then pass this onto family members at home.   You can pick up ringworm from dogs too. It doesn't discriminate."
AskVet,3arbet,deathmonkey,2,Tue Jun 23 23:14:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your input! My inclination at this point is that with reasonable precautions, the risk of bringing anything serious home to him is extremely low.   Mostly I'm just worried about FeLV or FIV at this point, but again, those seem unlikely to hitch a ride home with me."
AskVet,3arjb4,CaptainWigglezz,4,Mon Jun 22 22:47:41 2015 UTC,"The best dry cat food is one that you can afford and that your cat tolerates and thrives on.  The internet tends to complicate things with hearsay and opinions... though, I will add that the cheaper foods, like Meow Mix, tend to coat their kibble with fat to make them more palatable to pets. Of the two brands you mentioned in your post, Pure Balance is higher quality than Meow Mix in my opinion; however, they list ""chicken"" as the first ingredient, which will fall down the list significantly after the cooking process... AND they brag about their rating on dogfoodadvisor on the bag and ""the convenience of being available at walmart"", which are turn offs for me."
AskVet,3arjb4,rvtjess,2,Mon Jun 22 22:54:59 2015 UTC,i was worried i accidentally got kitten food when i opened the bag of pure balance. the kibble is so small. so far she has only had one hairball since shes been on it. she hasnt been going through this food as fast as the meow mix but she is eating. im wondering if she likes it less or it makes her full faster?  so pure balance isnt bad? i love this girl lots and i want her to be getting what she needs.
AskVet,3arjb4,rvtjess,2,Mon Jun 22 23:04:05 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't consider it a fantastic food, given it's affiliations, but I do think it's better than Meow Mix.  The higher quality foods tend to be more caloric dense, so the pets don't need to eat as much of it. She may be feeling ""fuller"" on less with the Pure Balance because her caloric needs are being met."

Have you tried using a human paddle brush instead of a cat brush on her?  I brush my medium/long hair cat with a paddle brush I use to use before I switched.  It sits on the bathroom counter with my stuff, and when she hops up to get morning pets, she gets brushed.  The bristles are softer than most grooming tools and if her skin is sensitive to touch, the more typical slicker brushes may be irritating.   Try a brush like this http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81v1VXeJBtL._SY679_.jpg  They are cheap and in lots of sizes.

AskVet,3asv2k,goatsickle,2,Tue Jun 23 20:44:50 2015 UTC,"An internist would likely perform an abdominal ultrasound to assess your dog's liver, intestinal tract, and other internal organs.  He or she would also likely want to repeat blood work and possibly add on additional tests.  There are plenty of disease that an internist might find that the general practice vets may have missed, so without knowing the additional test results it's hard to give you a list of possibilities.  It's even possible that this was as simple as generic hepatitis from unknown origin that cleared up but was followed by GI upset from the Clavamox that got worse because the dog just didn't process the HA very well.  But given the progression of symptoms I'd want to take the safe route and have an internist take a look."

While some vision loss can be attributed to normal aging, when its to the point of bumping into walls during the day, then that makes me suspicious there is some system disease process going on.  So first step, before talking to a trainer, would be to get him into his doctor for a full work up.  Rule out chronic pain and disease processes and then talk about behavior modification.  I would want to know if Larry is being a cranky old man cause he doesn't feel well/hurts before just even considering any permanent solutions."
AskVet,3are5w,Neryian,2,Mon Jun 22 22:33:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you! We did a full work up of labs, which came out to be 100% normal. The next step would be to get a neurological exam, which we are saving up for. Also, we are supposed to get his bottom teeth (from canine to canine) removed as they are decaying (previous owners didn't care for them). Again, we are saving up for that as well."
AskVet,3are5w,Neryian,4,Mon Jun 22 22:51:51 2015 UTC,Chronic dental pain can make anyone crabby.  I would put the dental first and see if that makes a difference.

AskVet,3apyrw,ans744,6,Mon Jun 22 15:43:36 2015 UTC,"As mentioned, year round flea control is the best way to avoid these issues. The trouble with finding fleas on your pet is that those only account for about 5-10% of the total population- the rest is in your environment. And while vacuuming, washing, treating, etc can reduce that load, the pupae developmental stage is almost (completely?) impossible to kill. They will eventually hatch, jump onto your pet, take a blood meal, and die. It can take about 3 months to eradicate an infestation (enough time for all eggs to hatch, develop, and jump back on a treated pet to die).   While there are other products, I wouldn't necessarily consider this a treatment failure or lack of efficacy."

Just make sure it is AAFCO certified (ideally food trial tested, formulated to meet minimums is ok).

I gave the bag a quick once over but didn't find any sort of stamp. Scanned the AAFCO website and didn't find a database of certified foods. I chose Hill's because it is generally praised everywhere. Should we change? Only difference between Trigger's (the 2 yr old) and Dude (new guy), is Dude's meals are Hill's mixed with the food the shelter gave us for the slow transition. Other wise, I cut the dry food with canned food. Nothing specific, usually whatever is on sale (last month Pedigree, yesterday we picked up Blue Buffalo.) I feed Dude twice a day. We're not trying to force fat onto his bones or anything but we do want to make sure he gains weight.     Right now the tactic is while Dude eats in the kitchen, Trigger eats in the living room, I'll sit on the floor and act as mediator. Then when it appears both are done, food bowls come up."

As far as the old food being bad, it's unlikely to be the cause, assuming they'd been eating that batch for a while without issues. The dog probably got diarrhea from dietary indiscretion (sneaking cat food), but it could be any other number of things. You also may have induced diarrhea in cat 1 by abruptly switching food as well.   As for your last part, if you're ever unsatisfied with a plan, just ask about it.

AskVet,3aobcl,Syreus,5,Mon Jun 22 04:01:03 2015 UTC,"Yup, that needs surgery. The chances of splinting working in this case are minimal given the complete lack of alignment of the two ends of the bone. As DrDead88 said, realistically you'll end up spending the same amount for a worse outcome. Small breed dogs are notorious for non healing fractures in this location anyway, so without surgical fixation I doubt that'll heal in a usable manner.   Amputation, while a potentially cheaper option, is not just a fix all solution.  You have to consider that by taking that option now, with a condition that is potentially fixable, you are eliminating it for any other conditions forever. If your dog were to get another fracture, that has to be fixed, even if it's a lot worse and more difficult or expensive than this one. If your dog were to get a bone tumour (less likely than in large breeds, but always possible), you can't use amputation as a treatment option. If she gets arthritis in another limb, she'll struggle a lot more than a dog who can compensate with 3 other legs. I'm not saying it shouldn't be done, but I think a lot of people take amputation too easily and don't think about the consequences for their pet later in life."
AskVet,3aobcl,Rebekah88,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:41:36 2015 UTC,We decided on the surgery. My Dad wanted to amputate and only agreed to let me pay the difference so she could have the surgery.

I felt that the dog was to young to have that mobility taken away and also that my mother would be constantly reminded of her mistake and blame herself if the leg were amputated.

Baby food (turkey is usually a good choice) seems to do the trick. However, it might not have the same effect when you can't control their diet.   Also keep in mind that they may become accustomed to your presence but this would not necessarily translate into them being socialized towards other people. If they are not already fully socialized you can't really change that at this age, and if they are ear-tipped that's probably a fairly good sign that they weren't socialized at the time they were tipped or they likely would have already been candidates for adoption. On the other hand, those tiny ear tips may have been a sign that someone was working with them and asked for small tips instead of the normally much larger ones in case they could be adopted."

Skin conditions are impossible to diagnose online, and can even be frustrating in person.   As long as he's otherwise doing ok, just schedule a vet visit at the next convenient time (sooner rather than later, especially if he appears uncomfortable)."

I'm frustrated and even more so because there's no way I can get an MRI and it doesn't seem like my vet's too interested in looking at other possibilities.

She picks up on who we are and responds to stimuli, like if I'm holding an item she'll move towards it to check it out. Her reaction is indicative of her recognizing us rather than trying to zero in on us. She also reacts when I wave my hand in from of her face, but only in these low level light conditions."

Our dog has always had a weak tummy since we got her, normal wet pet food makes her sick and a diet of only biscuits she is prone to diarrhoea or constipation (it went either way) which was causing her to have a sore anus. She eats 1 small bowl of dry biscuits of a morning and then raw beef with biscuit mixers of an evening which has made a considerable difference in the consistency of her faeces and her anus is no longer sore  My parents are trying this diet with her after speaking to friends who had a similar problem with their dog.  I was wondering if this meat may cause lipomas due to it being slightly more fatty (however she has not gained weight that I have noticed)"
AskVet,3amxjg,DrDead88,3,Sun Jun 21 20:37:22 2015 UTC,"While raw meat has a whole host of issues (see the resources on the sidebar), causing lipomas isn't one of them. Did the vet ever have any dietary suggestions?"

We took her back and he told us to try feeding her something less rich, such as James' well beloved food brand which we tried, however this caused her to vomit. We had recent success with Hills ProScience food however she has grown bored of it and won't eat it, we changed her biscuit to another one, which she was happy to eat, however both biscuits caused constipation/diarrhoea issues along with a sore anus which is why we made the switch."

In cases where they've had a history of known bad reactions, we will even keep the pet at the clinic for observation for a few hours (in cases of a history of minor reactions we will send it home but make sure the owner will be able to stay home with the pet to monitor it for the next several hours).

That training tells you how to introduce the fostered pets to your home environment.  I'm interested in what humane society or shelter isn't doing this, as it's a required practice.  Like /u/rtvjess states, you never, NEVER just put pets together like that. You start with a small confined space like the bathroom, then as they get more comfortable, you move them to a closed bedroom.  No direct line of sight with the other pets. They will get used to the smell.  It may take a week before you can even introduce them. If you don't follow the proper steps, you can permanently destroy the relationship to other animals."

She could have been bleeding from an injury, but the last time I saw her she looked and acted perfectly fine. Someone else told me if she does have kittens somewhere and she doesn't trust people, then she obviously doesn't want them found.

If you do the math figure out if the timeline works out that she is near the end of her pregnancy.  I have seen many kitten births (I took in and adopted out many pregnant cats and kittens) and sometimes they bleed more then others.  I have seen moms bleed a few days before, during, after. All different lengths of time. I have taken cats to the vet out of fear and it turned out they were all fine without any complications. All pregnant cats are different. I have set up perfect spots for the moms to give birth and most of the time, they give birth somewhere else! If it's been around 2 months then she may have very well given birth. Mom cats will protect their babies and have them in places that don't make sense to humans. Keep leaving the food out and maybe look around alittle but for where she may be. Leave the kittens with the mom until they are old enough to walk around. If you can get them all in a safe place that is ideal but if not just let them stay together."

Putting a line of Amdro outside the window will provide something for them to eat that is tastier than your cats food, reached first, and then carried back to the nest.  I have used Amdro in my tortoise enclosures and it has only taken about a day or so to get rid of colonies.  Amdro is pretty inexpensive and window/gap sealer is also quite cheap.

It definitely could have been heartworm, but the only way to actually know the cause of death is to have a necropsy (autopsy) done. If the missed doses were this most recent year, I wouldn't necessarily expect that to be the cause of death - it takes 5-7 months after exposure/bite for worms to mature fully, and while they can do damage in that time, I wouldn't expect it to fatal. Though it's always possible. Unfortunately, like I said, it's all speculation without a necropsy. Only then would you be able to tell whether it was an issue that would have been picked up on exam or routine testing.  For your other questions: your friends' dogs should be on prevention and be getting tested yearly, but all your dog potentially being positive did was increase the prevalence of HW in the mosquitos- she can't transmit it directly to them, and as far as I know, they are not pathogenic in humans either."

See prevalence of heartworm map from 2013: https://www.heartwormsociety.org/images/incidence-maps/IncidenceMap2013.pdf Unfortunately, the first sign of cardiac disease can be death, generally suspected due to ventricular arrhythmias.  If you weren't seeing signs of coughing, difficulty breathing, or collapse, there is likely nothing you could have changed.  This can also be true with cardiac hemangiosarcoma.

But there is no way to tell based on history alone especially since the dog has not been to ever see a vet.  Hopefully your friend is better off financially and sees a vet for routine care.  If not, something they should start doing.  I'm surprised through your research that you didn't come upon the fact that people don't get heartworm disease.

To start: you cannot get heartworm from your pup so don't worry there. Also, exercise intolerance can be an early sign of infection however for her to die so suddenly I would have expected other symptoms as well like coughing.   It's hard to say for sure, but to me it doesn't seem like heartworm was the culprit here. It takes the worms about 6 months to reach the adult stage in a dog, so she would have only had adult worms for a max of 6 months.   Someone else more familiar with the breed could chime in here, but are German Shepard dogs known for any specific heart defects I am forgetting?"

Regardless canned tuna or salmon are a good choice if she's more interested in people food, also cooked chicken would be an option. Just don't give her too much all at the same time. Why are you diluting her wet food so much? I'm wondering if perhaps she doesn't like the texture now that her teeth are feeling better?"
AskVet,3ajtrh,angelcake,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:17:33 2015 UTC,"I was told by a vet to do that because she wasn't drinking enough water, and was having bladder issues.  She would pass these little nasty polyps that caused her a good deal of pain.  Once I started making her food into a slurry, that completely stopped.  This was maybe a year ago?  I've tried just giving her regular canned food and she won't touch it at all.  What's weird is that I've watched her eat and she doesn't seem to use her tongue at all.  Before AND after the teeth cleaning.  You know how most cats will lick their food into their mouth?  She just sticks her face in and bites.  Gets all over her face, and then all over the floor.  I have to wash her face every single day, sometimes twice a day because her face gets caked with food.  The only time I've ever seen her use her tongue to eat is when she's licking a bowl clean."

If you do decide to give her canned salmon or tuna check the ingredients, you want to make sure she's not getting too much sodium or any other odd additives. I tend to like salmon because it's always packed in water. Tuna is packed in a variety of different things.  She sounds like she's pretty entertaining to watch, messy but entertaining.

Intestinal worms are also important to prevent for the health of your dog and your child's and cleanliness of your yard.

There's a chance he chewed it into small enough pieces that it'll pass on it's own. There's also a chance that it will obstruct, or, if sharp enough, perforate.

AskVet,3agkam,Luigidagawd,5,Fri Jun 19 23:50:03 2015 UTC,"Are you sure they aren't playing? This might sound like a ridiculous question but you said that nobody even makes any noise which would surprise me if your cat was really bothered by it (I'd expect hissing or growling at some point). Cats that are friendly with each other can and will chase each other around, wrestle, etc. but ideally it isn't one-sided as you describe. What do you normally do when the other cat pounces? Are you keeping them separated most of the time, then?"
AskVet,3agkam,jlrc2,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:55:56 2015 UTC,"They are separated most of the time. When he pounces usually I'll make a noise to stop him almost as a reaction. My cat usually hisses and general doesn't seem to think the other cat is playing. The male cat honestly doesn't seem to actually be trying to do any harm like he wouldn't know what to do if he actually got to her most of the time he just stops right before and does threatening, fighting posture. It mimics what he does with the other cat we have in the house that he grows up with. Trying to attack her then just batting her and not actually fighting her.  My problem is my cat feels as if she is being attacked and seems traumatized running away and hiding. Hissing at him. I wonder if she is making him want to attack or her acting scared is triggering him."
AskVet,3agkam,jlrc2,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:15:55 2015 UTC,"Okay I understand now. I think you've diagnosed it fairly well. Aggressor cat likely sees this as a wonderful opportunity for play and other cat thinks the entire thing is completely mortifying. Your best bet, I think, is to do some of the things it sounds like you've heard about and tried. There's bound to be some trial and error. At this point, the more aggressive cat is probably getting more and more excited by the sight of your cat because they are restricted from each other. The end goal in the near term is to try to get them into some level of mutual presence without hell breaking loose.  Letting the two trade territories for a few hours is one thing that may help. That is, put the aggressor cat in the place where yours is confined while you let your cat explore the other cat's space. At the least, this should give your cat some confidence that these spaces themselves aren't inherently threatening. Playing with both cats will be helpful as well, as simple as it sounds. You want to get the aggressor a little tired and stimulated while you want yours to feel confident.  As for direct contact, you'll want to try to ease them into it. Ideally they could be in a situation where they can see or at least be aware of each other without true physical access. If that isn't feasible, it might be worth trying to get them both occupied with a toy or toys at the same time. Scared kitty might not be willing to play, though. There's no obvious and automatic fix for this stuff, but be persistent and patient. It's hard for humans to understand what cats are thinking so don't think that something you tried once won't work the second or third time. When I've dealt with issues just like this it tends to be that when it clicks, it clicks and the two cats get on the same page."
AskVet,3agkam,Neryian,4,Mon Jun 22 06:20:30 2015 UTC,"If there is no noise then the behavior is play that you are interfering with.  Cat fights, even play that gets to rough, will be noisy.  Hissing, growling, screams are all the keys to play that has gone too far.  If your cat isn't running and hiding, screaming, hissing or growling, then the behavior you are describing is normal play.  Interfering with normal play behavior will cause problems not just between the cats but between you and the cats as you are causing confusion in what should be natural behavior.  My two youngest cannot eat together mostly cause they are both food aggressive and one is food obsessed.  They will tear through the house in fits of pouncing, head slamming, fur flying play fights.  Usually the younger of the two is the ""aggressor"" and starts every play session either by pouncing on her sisters head or simply jumping on her butt first (I really should be video of these guys one day).  The only time there is any noise (other than the sound of someone hitting a wall, bathtub or cabinet) is if Pixel (younger, more aggressive) bites to hard then Emma (slightly older) will scream and hiss and thwap Pixel in the face hard (like hard enough to be heard across the room).  This is immediately followed by an ""I'm Sorry"" grooming or a ""Fine Be that Way"" stalking off to play fight with the dogs.  Step back for a bit and observe the interactions objectively.  If they are silent or 99% silent, stop confusing the issue and leave them be.  Provide separate eating spaces, multiple litter boxes and lots of elevations.  Interactions without sound are the goal of all multiple cat households."

The dog that got her is a pitbull, so she managed to do a lot of damage.  I can try to get my sister to take her to a vet, but if surgery is needed we're going to have to just have her put down.

Essentially, since your boy is currently vaccinated, it is required that he receive a booster, and be placed in confinement for 45 days.

Ruling out fleas is the easiest thing to rule out, allergy wise- it just requires monthly preventatives. It's possible that one cat is allergic to fleas while one isn't. They can be hard to see on cats since they're such fastidious groomers. Other conditions, like food allergies, can be frustrating- if it's a true food allergy, only strict diet trials (with foods that can guarantee their ingredients) can rule them in/out. Environmental allergens can be just as frustrating, and require chronic medications for relief.   Other causes could be skin infections, whether bacterial or fungal. There are also behavioral causes, but these aren't typically approached until all medical causes are ruled out.

AskVet,3aczj5,GongGong13,8,Fri Jun 19 02:42:48 2015 UTC,Every 6 months for an anaesthesia seems a little excessive to me. I personally don't think anaesthetising an animal should be taken so lightly...especially if her recovery period afterwards is so miserable.   I'd recommend getting her into a dental diet to help maintain her teeth (or even brushing her teeth!) and really putting effort into helping her lose weight.   That would be the best thing for your cat's health.
AskVet,3aczj5,chulaire,3,Fri Jun 19 03:13:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I do feed her dental food (Royal Canin). I also put an additive in her water to reduce tartar. She won't let me brush her teeth, though."

I had a dog put down a few years ago after years of battling kidney failure and Addison's disease. She'd gotten really antisocial in her last days (hiding under the bed) and we reached a point where we'd really exhausted what we could manage financially. The day I decided to put her down I picked up her leash and asked her if she wanted to go for a car ride. She came running to me so happy, her old self. I have wondered daily since if it was to soon. I just took that quiz with her last week in mind and she scored a 3. I found it really comforting and if helped take away a tiny bit of the guilt I still struggle with 5 years later.

I would definitely suggest to you asking your vet about the Seresto collar. It is very very effective against fleas and ticks. Ask your vet about it since different preventatives have different efficacies in different places.  Lasts 8 months. Generally it works like a charm and virtually guarantees no ticks.

Since it's affecting both eyes, chances are likely it's just allergies or scleritis, but if you use the wrong med and there's an ulcer you can cause some serious damage (just had a patient come in earlier this week where the owner had been using steroid eyedrops with a humongous ulcer on the eye and was, essentially, melting the cornea. Very ugly sight).  TL;DR: is wait until you vet visit. If you have an e-collar (cone) it may be useful to put it on to prevent her from scratching them."

AskVet,3aatz5,NotAResponsibleHuman,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:43:22 2015 UTC,I thought that the heartworm medication would actually kill the larva before they matured to the 'worm' stage...  Is this not the case?
AskVet,3aatz5,DrDead88,5,Thu Jun 18 18:18:41 2015 UTC,"Heartworm preventatives only kill certain stages of developing larvae- once the worms molt into later life stages (""developing adult"") the preventative is no longer effective. So if the dose is missed, the worm ""escapes"" treatment.   Heartworm tests only test for a certain heartworm uterine protein- the sub adults/developing adults (or single sex infections) do not produce this protein, so the dog will test as negative. This is why a negative test, in cases of missed doses, doesn't mean you're out of the woods- you can't truly know for 5-7 months."
AskVet,3aatz5,vespolina12,2,Thu Jun 18 19:54:24 2015 UTC,"FYI - some manufacturers of heartworm medicine have guarantees and will pay the cost for treatment.  There are a lot of rules - you have to have documentation of a negative test to start with, documentation that you purchased their brand from your vet, etc.  Your vet should know if the brand you use has a guarantee and if you qualify.  Also, 7 months of crate rest sounds unusually long.  The American Heartworm Society has a website with a nice summary of how the treatment works and what the timelines are: https://www.heartwormsociety.org/images/pdf/HeartwormTreatmentGuide_PetOwner.Color.pdf"

The only other thing I would potentially add in is an anti-inflammatory drug such as meloxicam (I think carprofen is more commonly used over meloxicam in the States?). Talk to your vet!  These cases can be frustrating for both the owner and the clinician! If you're unsure as to why your vet wants to carry out anything, don't be afraid to ask for more information.

AskVet,3aaz2u,1bdkty,3,Thu Jun 18 17:06:40 2015 UTC,"If you are working with 2 specialists already, it would be irresponsible for other vets who haven't examined your cat to make other medical suggestions.  That being said, I would recommend essentially trying to baby proof your house.  It sounds like you've already started doing this somewhat, but go around every room that she's allowed in and really figure out if there's some way she could hurt herself.  Or if there are nonessential rooms, just close the doors.  You can get little stairs so she doesn't have to jump onto couches or beds, place soft mats or pillows next to places she might fall, or use tall baby gates (although those might not work super well as cats are good jumpers and she may hurt herself trying to get over them).  Have you talked to either of the specialists about your concerns?  They may have other suggestions from dealing with other animals with similar problems.  It sounds like she has a bit of a rough road ahead but that you're doing everything you can.  Good luck!"
AskVet,3aaxwg,datcat,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:58:30 2015 UTC,Sounds like he might need something like a ct scan and/or rhinoscopy. If it's been chronic for his whole life it could be something a nasal polyp or chronic rhinitis.
AskVet,3aaxwg,Tobimaru,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:35:15 2015 UTC,"When I first got him, he stayed with my veterinarian for two weeks while he tried to get it figured out. He thought polyps, too, but it wasn't that."

Otherwise consider pemphigus (autoimmune disease) and ask about a corticosteroid trial."

AskVet,3aaq0c,chulaire,3,Thu Jun 18 23:00:29 2015 UTC,"If he continues to vomit, consider requesting an xray contrast study. Palpation alone is not enough to diagnose an obstruction, especially in such a big dog."

Still eating? Normal energy?  Have any fecal tests been examined for parasites? Are his vaccines up to date?"
AskVet,3aalw6,DrDead88,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:18:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. He seems to be doing pretty good otherwise. He is eating, drinking water, sleeping as usual, there is no vomiting, his energy level might be lower. No tests have been done since i noticed it this morning. His vaccines are up to date, but not all of them have been administered. I know the vet told me i would have to bring him once per week for the following four to five weeks till he gets all the shots. Is this something that is serious? I don't have a lot of experience with puppies before and i am really scared that i am doing something wrong...  Oh yes, and one more thing.. He did injure his leg a bit yesterday morning trying to climb on the couch, so now his leg is bandaged, but the vet said its nothing serious, just some soft tissue swelling."
AskVet,3aalw6,DrDead88,2,Thu Jun 18 17:01:37 2015 UTC,"I would give your vet a call, just to let them know- they may recommend testing for intestinal parasites (common in puppies) in his fecal sample, and then treating if need be.   I asked all of the other questions about appetite, vomiting, etc because parvo can present with diarrhea/bloody stool, but also with those other signs as well. Some more info about parvo if you're not familiar with the disease.   If it is something simple like intestinal parasites, or just an upset stomach, it's nothing serious, it just may require an additional medication."

AskVet,3a92d0,lindygrey,4,Thu Jun 18 07:29:49 2015 UTC,We would need to see her and examine her sores to make a diagnosis. We just don't have enough information to help you. If you are in the USA look into care credit.
AskVet,3a8119,WipeYourJib,13,Wed Jun 17 23:17:46 2015 UTC,"Really, both are correct.  Ringworm is not a serious problem in the sense that it doesn't really make animals, or people, systemically ill.  It is a big problem in the sense that it's very contagious and can be difficult to completely eradicate from the environment.  It's so contagious that some shelters have to euthanize ringworm positive animals or else it would spread through the entire facility.  A fungal culture is the gold standard for diagnosis, and I can't remember what the time frame is for being able to truly call it a negative (probably 2-3 weeks, as your vet said).  You should quarantine your cat if you don't want to spread it all over your house, as it can be difficult to get rid of.  But treatment itself isn't really that bad if it's just in a few small spots.  Some vets recommend a topical ointment, some full body lime sulfur dips, not sure what else.  You can definitely still interact with your kitten, but it would be best to wear long pants and sleeves and wash your hands immediately afterward.  If you notice red spots on yourself, you should go to your doctor for treatment."
AskVet,3a8119,CoopertheBKE,5,Wed Jun 17 23:52:28 2015 UTC,"I've had vets prescribe oral antifungals, topical creams(some over the counter), topical drops, shampoos, and sulfur lime dips as treatments. All do the job but all in different time spans."
AskVet,3a8119,DarkDefenderDaxter,6,Thu Jun 18 02:50:12 2015 UTC,"I'm curious what she thinks vets' motivation is to scare people about ringworm? Based on that alone, I'd hesitate to use any shampoo she sends you. At the very least, when it arrives I would call your vet and tell them the ingredients and ask if it's safe and recommended to use on them before you use it. Some shampoos can be harmful or irritating to kittens, and some may contradict any treatment your vet has recommended. I find the fact that she's so adamant that it isn't ringworm and her overall distrust of vets a bit concerning.   /u/CoopertheBKE is right. Ringworm is a pain in the ass, but it isn't dangerous if everyone has a healthy immune system, unless it goes completely uncontrolled for a very long time. I second cleaning everything with a dilute bleach solution, quarantine to one room, avoid directly touching the bald spots, long sleeves, and hand washing after handling. If you have a blacklight, ringworm sometimes glows under it. It doesn't always though, so if it glows it's likely ringworm, if it doesn't, it may or may not be.  I would just follow your vet's recommendations. Even if it's ringworm, as long as you treat the cats and the environment properly, it should be gone relatively quickly."
AskVet,3a8119,mcnuggetskitty,5,Thu Jun 18 01:28:03 2015 UTC,"Her motivation, like many other places that sell animals, is that they don't want to be blamed for a diseased product (when they are to be blamed) and they don't want animals returned.  It sounds like the cat may have a mild upper respiratory problem with ocular discharge along with ringworm, which would explain the lowered immune system.  OP, please go with your vet's recommendation and treat it properly. Having a lingering ringworm infection sucks. The shelter is just trying to avoid blame so they're downplaying the situation. Careful with shampooing the cat - this could stress it out even more and exacerbate the infection."
AskVet,3a8119,chulaire,2,Thu Jun 18 01:44:32 2015 UTC,She was saying they scare you so I would keep going back to make money.  She's sending This off amazon and is being sent to me. Its not from her.
AskVet,3a8119,mcnuggetskitty,5,Thu Jun 18 01:42:21 2015 UTC,"Malaseb is cool. I was afraid she was sending you some homemade potion or something! I would still call and ask your vet before using it though, just to ensure it won't interact with any other treatment they have done or may do."
AskVet,3a8119,lindygrey,4,Thu Jun 18 01:53:04 2015 UTC,"We had a rescue foster dog with recurrent ringworm infections. We bought a steamer for the hardwood floors and everyday I'd swiffer (which attracts those tiny fungi spores that are so contagious) then steam the floors. We washed the bedding (he's an Italian Greyhound and they sleep in the human bed) every day. We covered the sofa with plastic then sheets and washed the sheets every day. Anything I could I washed or wiped down with dilute solution of bleach. We confined him to only a couple areas of the house and luckily they all had hardwood floors instead of carpet.   He took an oral anti-fungal drug for a couple months. We had another flare of it about 6 months later so I doubled down on the cleaning and he got a another round of anti-fungal drugs.   We finally kicked it and he's just the sweetest most darling little pup. I'm glad we toughed it out. He has an adoption pending and we're just so happy for him! But, ringworm can be a huge big deal even if it's not deadly."
AskVet,3a8119,llamacatnarwhal,2,Thu Jun 18 04:00:27 2015 UTC,"(not a vet)  Ringworm is very contagious. I work at a dairy barn where ringworm has spread to probaly 30-40% of the cows (maybe more) and i have now contracted it. The ringworm will not physically hurt her, and it wont 'hurt' you, but it's itchy and you can get it pretty easily from getting into contact with her ringworm.   So be careful, and I would definitely keep the kitten contained so it doesnt spread to the house, and possibly you as well."
AskVet,3a8119,WhatsTheDiagnosis,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:21:27 2015 UTC,"The age old question! Dermatophytosis (ringworm) is caused by a fungi. In reality, many cats carry ringworm but don't show any signs until they're immuno-compromised (young animals, very old animals, new environment, transport, illness etc etc).  Your vet is advising you to do the ""gold standard"" treatment, and as I am also a clinician I would advise the same. Ringworm is highly contagious and zoonotic (can transmit from animals to people).  A weeks worth of shampoo is going to do very little unfortunately, and might not even contain the right active ingredients. You'll need treatment until the cultures come back negative (which more often than not is going to be WAY past the cessation of clinical signs). As kitty is recently adopted, the shelter should have taken your information WAY more seriously. Ringworm in a cattery is an absolute nightmare to deal with due to how contagious it is.  Follow the vets advice, and wash everything kitty uses (bed, toys, any blankets etc) on a HOT wash frequently. Keep him away from children and other animals, and wash your hands after you play with him! The sooner you stamp this out, the sooner you can show everyone your new kitten!"
AskVet,3a8fl8,DrDead88,3,Thu Jun 18 01:24:29 2015 UTC,"The general recommendation is to limit activity and excitement, as best as you can. Obviously for some dogs this is easier than with others. If you're worried that you aren't able to keep him restricted enough, talk with your vet, and see whether there are any options or strategies to use. Your vet is familiar with your boy's case, and would be able to help you better than we can. And per the sidebar, we cannot comment on another vet's treatment plan or diagnosis."

I wouldn't suspect that the diarrhea/loose stool would be related to his previous urinary/kidney issues. Give your vet a call with an update, and see if they have any concerns from before or recommendations."

You might consider asking your vet about probiotics, there is some debate about how effective they are [stomach acid may destroy a lot of the beneficial bacteria] but they are a relatively benign treatment, you're not going to cause him any harm, worst case they won't do anything. The odds are very good that he will recover on his own if there are no other underlying conditions."

With herpes lowering his immune system, secondary infections can occur.   The drool may be a result of ulcers in his mouth - most commonly caused by calicivirus.  Your vet will help with the supportive therapy and may prescribe antibiotics. Other than that, he'll have to fight it off himself with his immune system.   All the best."

This fills them up when their kibble is reduced while still being pretty low calorie. The extra fiber boost is also a good thing for some dogs.
AskVet,3a7oyc,PurpleCow88,3,Thu Jun 18 02:18:18 2015 UTC,"Decrease her food. 5 lbs in 3 weeks is alot of weight gain and it is going to make her arthritis worse due to inflammation and pressure on joints.  Feed her based on ideal weight. Increase exercise. Minimize treats. Be strict and you should see weight loss.  You are feeding about 740 kcal total a day, which is strange that she is gaining so much weight since based on her ideal weight that is less than maintenance energy.  You should try knocking off 75 to 100 kcal. If she still continues to gain weight, I would contact your vet for a discussion and physical exam. Also to make sure her thyroid is okay."

Could be anything - viral infection, bacterial infection, parasites, internal bleeding, autoimmune disease, cancer and so on.   In order to force feed birds and rehydrate them, you need the right tools and the knowledge of how to use them. You also need to know how to hold it still. Without training you're more than likely to break its neck or other bones, perforate its stomach, drown it by pouring food or water into its lungs, etc.  There's nothing you can do for it if it's not eating or drinking other than to keep it warm.

I have one cat with crystals and another with urinary issues brought on by stress, so I just feed it to all 6 of them. It does get expensive (for 6 of them on it, it's usually between $70-$120 a month depending on what size bags I buy).   The other issue is that the urinary foods in all brands tend to be pretty high calorie, so it may not be a great choice for an overweight cat that doesn't have urinary issues, especially if free fed. Everyone was starting to get a bit chunky on it, so I've had to stop free feeding and do portion control. (Royal Canin makes a moderate calorie formula, but it only comes in small bags and costs more, plus it makes one of my cats barf.) If you don't mind the cost of having 2 cats on the prescription food and the other cat doesn't have weight issues, it's fine to feed to both of them."
AskVet,3a4puh,aerydotcalm,2,Wed Jun 17 05:21:23 2015 UTC,"You can definitely take her to the vet to get her a proper checkup. Depending on where the quill is, yes it could interfere with her barking. She could also have been debarked.   Not much else we can do without conducting a physical so if in doubt, visit your local vet. They might have a better way of dealing with the quill too, like determine its exact location via radiography and possibly surgical removal of it."
AskVet,3a4puh,chulaire,2,Wed Jun 17 18:10:00 2015 UTC,"Took her to the vet today, they are going to book her for a CT for her entire head/neck. They suspect there are more quills that have broken off/splintered. It is likely that she'll have to get some surgery. Thanks for the help! Poor girl. :("

AskVet,3a4puh,Starstar2,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:07:01 2015 UTC,"She does have trouble yawning which I noticed this morning. She can't get a full yawn out and toward the end of the yawn she definitely winces and cries (different from just an end of the yawn cry I hear from most dogs, more like an ouch that hurt).   I'll take a look at the basenji bark. I do have her booked in to go through our vet this morning, instead of the rescue's vet, and we'll just see what's going on and if the quill is really interfering."
AskVet,3a5luz,babyblanka,3,Wed Jun 17 12:19:21 2015 UTC,"It does sound like an improvement. The course of medical treatment is to reduce inflammation in the area so that the spinal cord isn't pinched as much by the bulging/ruptured disc.   We don't know the extent of the damage or location of the disc, and depending on whether it's just bulging, partially herniated or fully herniated is what is usually used to gauge the need for surgery.  Keep in mind that partial ruptures can result in a full herniation of the disc later, so there will always be a risk unless surgically treated.   See what the vet says on Friday. The MRI is your best bet with figuring out whether your dog needs surgery or not. It's good news that he has improved, but wait until after the MRI before you decide on surgery or not."
AskVet,3a5luz,chulaire,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:17:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!   He did mention that the MRI cannot really indicate if medical treatment can help, only if surgery can help? It's a little confusing, I guess.   We're doing the MRI first but I'm really nervous about having to make that decision right there, so quickly while he is knocked out. I know the doctor can't exactly make the decision but I really wish they could have a third party who helps. It's so confusing."
AskVet,3a5luz,chulaire,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:20:18 2015 UTC,"Trust your vet and if you have any questions, try to ask questions until you understand. I've had so many clients just say yes or no to things without fully understanding the situations, despite me trying to make sure they know but the fear of looking/sounding stupid usually overrides.  If you're not comfortable with something, then tell them. Communication is key. Your vet sounds like they know exactly what they're doing and so far so good right?"
AskVet,3a5luz,chulaire,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:32:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that. Yea I don't really question the vet's ability to, you know, doctor. I mostly question my own decision making skills. The internet can make you crazy.   Some people say that waiting is key, and waiting a week since the injury isn't enough time for medical treatment to help. Other people say that if you wait longer, you injury yourself more and the quicker, the better for recovery.   So, obviously with anything medical, it's such a case by case basis. I just don't want Ringo to go through surgery and all of that trauma if he doesn't have to. But of course I don't want him to get worse if he doesn't have to either."

If it doesn't improve however, a visit to the vet would be a good idea, as skin issues can present very similarly (may look like a bug bite, but could be an infection)."

AskVet,3a4465,VirgoDesires,5,Wed Jun 17 02:03:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, it could be just demodex. Some dogs get it very badly.  The diarrhea may or may not be related to a condition that can cause skin problems as well (such as food allergy).  Bad demodex can be difficult and frustrating to treat. The dogs that are badly affected may have underlying disease or problem with their immune system.  Consider consulting with a veterinary dermatologist.   http://www.petplace.com/article/dogs/diseases-conditions-of-dogs/skin/demodicosis-red-mange-in-dogs  http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?A=630"

AskVet,3a2p0s,addywoot,7,Tue Jun 16 19:30:30 2015 UTC,"Is your cat home? It sounds like he needs to be in the vets under some kind of sedation until this wears off.  I haven't used telazol, but it is related to ketamine. The offset for ketamine in cats is due to redistribution and excretion from the kidneys, rather than metabolism as we see in dogs. I'm wondering if there is some disinhibition from benzodiazepine component.   Anyway I'd be sedating the poor guy, keeping him on fluids and monitoring him."
AskVet,3a2p0s,dashclone,2,Tue Jun 16 19:59:01 2015 UTC,It's one of the board members of our cat rescue.  They didn't want to try sedating him right now because he's so out of control.  He slams himself so hard that his joints pop.  They did a light test but one of his eyes isn't responding.  We're watching and waiting right now.
AskVet,3a2p0s,dashclone,6,Tue Jun 16 22:48:42 2015 UTC,"That's the whole reason to sedate him, to stop him damaging himself. IM sedation then get IV access then maybe a propofol CRI with fluids."
AskVet,3a2p0s,jadedgoldfish,3,Wed Jun 17 05:49:12 2015 UTC,"Just want to second this comment. We often used a bit of sedation to smooth rough, dysphoric recovery from anesthesia. You would want to use a different sedative than the one used initially due to the poor reaction, but it could help. Alternatively, you could ask your vet about IV intralipids. They're not very commonly used in general practice, but an emergency or specialty hospital may have more information."
AskVet,3a2p0s,skipsteejsprat,2,Wed Jun 17 10:54:39 2015 UTC,Absolutely agree. We've got her taking him in again today.
AskVet,3a2p0s,ironmouse,2,Wed Jun 17 17:26:00 2015 UTC,"Not the same, but we sedated a cat with traumatic hypopituitarism with Telazol.  The condition is very rare, so there's not any data on them.  He took a long time to fully come out of it, but he did eventually, so I would expect yours to do the same.  But I'm not a neurologist, so take my opinion with a grain of salt."

AskVet,3a4f8n,rvtjess,3,Thu Jun 18 00:28:18 2015 UTC,Just vomiting or just diarrhea isn't always too concerning; the fact that she's doing both and it's been going on for 2 days and is progressively getting worse is concerning. Please consider a vet visit.

AskVet,3a3lwp,vampire_kitty,3,Tue Jun 16 23:31:14 2015 UTC,"Pain during needle insertion is pretty normal- even I have to look away when I donate blood. While there are pain meds available in general for cats, I'm not sure anything sort of full sedation would numb the acute needle prick pain. Some may even be contraindicated, assuming you are dealing with chronic kidney disease.    Have you taken any other steps to attempt to increase her oral water intake, whether dietary, bubbler/fountain, etc? This may allow you to decrease the frequency or amount of administrations (though obviously consulting with your vet first).   Unfortunately, with chronic conditions/medications, you often run into quality of life issues with cats- treating the condition can deteriorate the bond you have with her, which obviously isn't something you want.   It sounds like you've been in constant contact with your vet, which is great. I would just reiterate your concerns, and see if there are any other thoughts or options that may help decrease the need. Good luck!"
AskVet,3a3lwp,DrDead88,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:41:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your reply.  Unfortunately as she is on a steroid, the vet said a pain medication is contraindicated unless we stop the steroid, which I don't want to do because it has SERIOUSLY improved her quality of life since starting it a few months ago. We're in comfort care mode so I'm okay with the fact that this steroid might cause some kidney issues over time because her kidneys were in excellent shape when we started. So pain meds are not an option at this point.  I have taken steps to increase her water intake for the last couple of years. I've spent a lot of money on different water bowls and various fountains, none of which make any difference (and she actively avoided all of the fountains - the last one I left out for 3-4 months hoping she'd just eventually get used to it. Nope. Never did). She still prefers to alternate between drinking out of water glasses or this one type of bowl I have. I monitor her closely and switch the choices around depending on how she's responding to the water. Often she has a bowl in the kitchen and a glass in the hallway and she just picks which she prefers.  I've also switched her from dry food a couple years ago and when her water consumption became more tricky, I started mixing the wet food with a couple tablespoons of water with each refill (she has wet food available nearly 24/7, I work from home so I can refill it throughout the day so she's getting numerous tablespoons of water this way, plus what she drinks). Unfortunately she was still showing some signs of dehydration and with the steroid, the vet suggested the SubQ fluids which seemed easy enough to start with.  Luckily it's not deteriorating the bond I have with my cat yet - other than the actual administration itself (and sometimes 5-10 minutes after, but not always) she will still seek to sit on my lap or sit next to me and such.  But she's DEFINITELY not having a good time with the fluid administration itself and has become more difficult to handle to the point that I used to be able to just administer when she was sitting on my lap and I didn't have restrain her at all to now I have to often enlist the help of my roommate to help me make sure she's not going to get up and bolt mid-session. And now she's starting to try and bite and last night was hissing, something I can't even recall her doing in the last few years except maybe once when a friend pet her too hard on her arthritic hip, maybe?  But it is definitely a conundrum with the quality of life issue because I want nothing more than for her to be comfortable and the fluids DO make her more comfortable day to day save the 10 minutes of pain and/or discomfort every other day. I just fear that her response to this treatment may grow worse over time which would tip the balance into the treatment being worse than the solution it provides so I'm trying to find ways to avoid tipping that balance."
AskVet,3a3lwp,DrDead88,3,Wed Jun 17 01:09:41 2015 UTC,"I'm glad it's not straining your relationship with her! Have you asked anyone at the vet office about restraint techniques? Something as simple as a ""cat burrito"" may be helpful, and sometimes can even reduce stress. Though you may have already asked, since you're trying a box/sink next.   You can also try introducing distractions or rewards. I would just be careful to use a new/separate treat from what you typically use, if so- cats can be tricky and develop aversions."
AskVet,3a3lwp,littlehamsterz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:24:23 2015 UTC,"Back when I was giving her the steroid in pill form, I was using the cat burrito technique (which she would fight after the first few times once she figured out what it was and what would always come next) so I'm not sure that would work with this, plus it wouldn't really give me access to her shoulders/back where I insert the needle.  While she doesn't seem to be bothered with cat treats, I have been able to get her to eat liquid forms of medicines she would otherwise foam/gag/puke if given straight to her mouth by mixing it with new/unusual canned food so that's an idea to try - maybe distract her with some awesome ""treat"" type food... while in a box or sink! Thanks for the idea. :)"
AskVet,3a3lwp,vespolina12,2,Wed Jun 17 02:00:03 2015 UTC,could you ask the vet to try butterfly catheters?? they have small gauges for some of those and at least there will be a longer line so that if the cat moves you can move with her and your hand won't be so close for bites.  Not much you can do about the pain of inserting a needle unfortunately. You could also put a cone on her head while you're doing the fluids to prevent biting behavior and turning around to bite the needle. It won't make her like it anymore but at least you'll be safer.
AskVet,3a3lwp,vespolina12,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:21:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how the butterfly needle would help considering that it's the needle itself that seems to bother her rather than the design of the needle. Since the butterfly design allows for more shallow insertion I think I'd be concerned that I'd hit something internally like a vertebrae or perhaps a scapula if I didn't pull the scruff up high like I already am.  However, the cone idea. I hadn't thought of that. If the box/sink and food distraction ideas don't work and she keeps trying to bite, I'll absolutely look into getting one. I've seen some fabric ones that seem to be less jarring for the cats so that's a great idea. Thanks!"

Make sure not to feed alfalfa to an adult rabbit, and always check reputable sources before introducing new vegetables to make sure they're safe.  Monitor your rabbit's bathroom habits closely (a good idea in general to monitor feces--if your rabbit ever stops pooping it is an emergency situation!).

If you are not already aware of it, /r/rabbits is another possible resource on reddit for you in the future, when this medical stuff is taken care of.  I agree with the previous poster than waiting until Saturday is not a good idea. Bunnies do die extraordinarily quickly when there is a problem. Keep in mind that not all vets do exotics, so you want to make sure you can take him to someone with a lot of rabbit experience. If you call around, a vet might be able to squeeze you in today, given that circumstances (where I live, someone 100% could but I don't necessarily know what it is like in other places).  I've had to cut mats like that off of rescue bunnies before and it is definitely challenging, especially given that rabbits have very sensitive, delicate skin. A vet tech (or two) should be able to help you, though-- just warn them what they are getting into in advance and tell them you need help.   Thank you for taking this guy in. Judging by his condition, he was obviously very much maltreated up until this point. I'm glad he found someone more kind in his elderly years."

They probably had poor diets and likely do have some parasites.  If they start to slow down, stop eating, and generally look like they feel bad, you really shouldn't wait to get them to a vet.

AskVet,39zuhi,zeepanda,3,Tue Jun 16 03:07:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I couldn't remember the rest of your questions as I was writing my other response.  The pros of zeuterin are that it doesn't require anesthesia and is thought to be fairly painless.  If your dog still having balls is important to you, then they still have them, though they will shrink.  It might take longer for the dog to actually become sterile with zeuterin since the sperm already in existence won't be destroyed.  Pros of neutering are that it doesn't require special training for the vet, in the future nobody will probably mistake your dog for intact (if they somehow end up in a shelter), and they'll be unable to develop testicular cancer.  Honestly, I'd go with whichever your vet is most comfortable with, but if they're offering both, either would probably be fine:)"
AskVet,39zuhi,CoopertheBKE,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:05:09 2015 UTC,What would you actually recommend for me in your experience for my breed and age ? Also What are the chances of testicular cancer developing in my specific breed ? As I want to prevent any possible future problems. As I am worried about the surgical procedure although it doesn't matter to me as whether he has his testes or not. It just seems like the non surgical might be less painful for him and not as intense. Although of course I just want what's best for him in the future. But for the case is more to prevent future problems. Also worried about going into surgery & the post care...
AskVet,39zuhi,CoopertheBKE,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:30:45 2015 UTC,"Hi CoopertheBKE I wanted to let you know that I spoke with my vet and he was telling me that the non surgical it reduces the testosterone so the testosterone at 40% is not enough to develop testicular cancer...and said it has been FDA approved and tested that there are no risks, so it's like they were neutered. I wanted to confirm if you know anything about that since you've done the procedure before. Like how exactly does testicular cancer happen?"
AskVet,39zuhi,CoopertheBKE,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:03:09 2015 UTC,"So I haven't done the procedure before, I've only done the first part of the training.  From what I remember and what I looked up on the website, I agree with your vet.  It reduces the testosterone, making testicular cancer less likely.  Testicular cancer happens the same way any other cancer does - mutations in the DNA of dividing cells.  Most of the time, your body or your dogs body is able to correct them, but not always.  As you probably know, cancer risk increases with age, for a lot of reasons.  I don't know the prevalence of testicular cancer In dogs, but I know they can't get it without their testicles.  However, there is some research that shows a link between neutering dogs and prostate cancer.  A link doesn't mean it causes it.  There hasn't been any research that I'm aware of documenting a link between zeutering and prostate cancer, or a lack there of.  So lots of information, but it really boils down to your preference.  There probably isn't much of a difference in the outcome of the procedure, and the procedure itself is supposed to be much less traumatic with zeutering.  So I'm sorry if I haven't helped you at all with your decision...it's just a relatively new procedure that many people don't have much experience with.  It ultimately boils down to what you and your vet decide:)  And if you haven't yet, check out their website.  And if you remember, let me know what you decide, now I'm all invested in it!"
AskVet,39zuhi,haggieneko,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:57:51 2015 UTC,"As always hesitant about what the vet office decides since they tend to not do surgeries on the weekends since it's the busy days & made an exception for me on the surgery (can't go weekdays). They suggest the zeutering because it's quick and will take only 2 hours as opposed to the whole day. So maybe their opinion is a bit biased & only for their benefit...but perhaps that is me overthinking it.  I am honestly leaning towards surgery since the zeutering is so new there's no data testing on it...but I worry about his post care, since he is a very hyper active always tail wagging happy dog (except for bath time he hates baths) & I'm not sure I can keep and eye on him 24/7 (suture removal in two weeks post procedure). I also don't own a kennel & have never put him in one since he sits on my lap in the car to the vet. Although on the other hand I don't want him to be in so much trauma and pain because I feel like he will never trust me after the surgical surgery since I'm the one who brings him to the vet. Since he probably won't remember much is its zeutering besides being sore he will probably forget about it afterwards. And it's basically the same as surgical although people might think he isn't neutered because he's still in tact.Will he still mark trees given that he is still in tact? Just wondering since he marks trees...  I'm curious though what exactly is the first part of training to be able to perform the procedure and is it difficult to pass/long training time?  Also is it safe to do the set of uearly vaccinations while they so the zeutering and or the surgical procedure?  Edit - excuse my typos. Typing on the phone makes it difficult to read back what was typed and any autocorrected words."
AskVet,39zuhi,haggieneko,2,Tue Jun 23 09:02:10 2015 UTC,"I've gone through the first part of the training for ""zeuterin,"" but have never actually done the procedure.  From what I remember, their testicles eventually atrophy and become non-functional for sperm production.  I just looked up the website (zeuterin.com) and they say it reduces testosterone by about 50%, so it will probably help with the prostatic enlargement.  There is an FAQ section for both vets and owners on the website, so you can check it out yourself if you feel so inclined:)"
AskVet,39zuhi,haggieneko,2,Tue Jun 16 04:59:12 2015 UTC,"I have done quite a few of these Zeuterin neuters, as well as countless surgical ones. If any problems arise with the testicles, either as a result of the Zeuterin injection or testicular cancer later in life, you can still go in and surgically remove them if need be. To my knowledge, Zeuterin is still only FDA approved for dogs up to 10 months of age, however. I know they're working on approval for older dogs, but I don't think it's been granted yet."

This typically includes activities like eating and drinking, wanting to be around others (if that's her temperament) seeking affection (again, depending on the cat), etc. It can also include items like sunbathing in her favorite spot, playing with toys/family members, etc. Once you have that list, you just start monitoring (and writing down) when she has good days, and when she has bad days,  and lets you see overall trends too.

I had noticed over the last week that she has been much more affectionate than normal. This and the weight loss (which started slow and plummeted over the last few weeks) are what cued me to her illness. I guess I'll just have to keep an eye on her and see how she progresses.

It's a LOT to take in for a complex disease, and there are loads of options and things to consider, but I found the site a lifesaver sometimes when I had questions-- and sometimes it gave me ideas to run by my vet which they never even thought about trying, and some of those ideas were put into action. The website has both anecdotal and veterinary sources, so if there's something you are considering from it, absolutely run it by your vet first, of course.

Maybe there is some out there but in my eyes something scientifically proven shouldn't require a ton of digging through reviews and stories to find a bona fide study backing it up.  Fortiflora on the other hand has plenty of research papers that have used it and demonstrated digestive benefits.  Keep your dog on I/D for now.

AskVet,39xkxq,littlehamsterz,2,Mon Jun 15 19:11:54 2015 UTC,"The girlfriend here:  I thought a little additional information on the kitty-dynamics might be helpful. When we first moved in together, Olive hissed at both of the other cats quite regularly. She had always been in a single-cat home previously, so she was not socialized to other cats. As time went on, one of the cats is happy to keep its distance, but the other has become increasingly aggressive toward Olive. While there don't seem to be physical attacks, he does tend to chase and corner Olive at least once or twice a day (that we witness). Through day 1, Olive (and the other two) have consistently used the litter box through all of this.  About two weeks ago, we noticed a flea infestation. We began treating all three cats and, in an attempt to keep fleas out of the bedroom, we no longer let any of the cats in the room. There is one litter box in the living room (which all three cats continued to have access to) but the bedroom litter box was temporarily off-limits. In hindsight, this was a bad decision and we should have moved the other litter box to another location, but we didn't consider this at the time. After 48 hours of the bedroom door closed, Olive first soiled the kitchen mat. We immediately re-opened the bedroom door to allow entry to the room (and litter box), as we would much prefer a flea problem to a behavioral issue. However, Olive is still using the kitchen mat instead of the litter box. I think that she is using a litter box for most urinations, but I have not actually witnessed this. It does appear that every bowel movement is now in the kitchen.  We are currently unsure whether it was the temporary expulsion from the bedroom that instigated this or if it is a stress issue related to the cats' tiffs that coincidentally occurred at the same time.

AskVet,39x199,somesillynerd,5,Mon Jun 15 16:50:01 2015 UTC,"One of the major contributing factors towards hip disease is the weight of your dog and their body condition score, as well as genetics. What body condition is she at the moment?  It's good that you're trying to get her to lose weight, but it may be necessary to visit your vet and discuss with them how to do it correctly. They can schedule regular weight checks, discuss diets etc.  She may need pain relief for a short time whilst her body gets used to more exercise, just like we may need drugs after starting running again after a few months off. Human pain meds are mostly toxic to dogs, ones from the vet are the way forward."
AskVet,39x199,somesillynerd,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:53:41 2015 UTC,thanks.  she is a 7 - 8.  do not know how as she only gets a cup of food in the morning and a cup at night. Thanks for the advice.
AskVet,39x199,littlehamsterz,2,Mon Jun 15 15:11:56 2015 UTC,"is it literally a cup? like a measuring cup?   the back of the bag should have an estimate of what to feed your dog daily, based on body weight - go with what she should be, not what she currently is."
AskVet,39ylyt,jowofoto,3,Mon Jun 15 21:12:36 2015 UTC,"Not a vet, but from what I've seen (both at shelters and my own cat) this is often caused by eating too fast. Some cats like to gorge down their kibbled food which causes them to often vomit it up. I would think it would be harder to do this with chicken so it is less likely to happen with chicken. I had this issue with my current cat and we switched to her eating on a plate (so she had to eat slowly) and then to a slow feeding bowl so she couldn't gorge it down. It went from daily vomits to maybe a vomit once a month or two.   While there might be a medical issue, I'd try something like that first and see if it stops. Usually the simplest answer is the correct one. I've seen this a lot of strays and shelter kitties that have to compete for food."

If this problem persists after you adjust the feeding style and try wet food or other dry food brands (one of my cats vomits science diet no matter how small an amount he eats, but nothing else), you should probably go to the vet for a checkup."

He doesn't eat cat food, he sniffs it and then turns away. The food comes up whole, after retching. He is fine after. If we feed him plain boiled chicken breast he is a happy camper and eats quickly without vomiting. He also vomits with deli meat (experiment). The deli meat is his favorite, he attacks it almost... but vomits."

AskVet,39y9x8,Buchiu,10,Mon Jun 15 19:49:44 2015 UTC,"Granted I am not a vet and still a vet student, I have never heard of a dog being allergic to gluten. That is very bizarre. Usually dogs are allergic to proteins.  Without a 12 week food trial and allergy skin tests, I don't think anybody can say what exactly your dog is allergic to.  I would ask your vet about a hypoallergenic diet (hydrolyzed). Hill's, Purina, Royal Canin all make these types of diets. It basically means the proteins have been broken down so far down that they are too small to USUALLY cause a reaction.  Definitely address the thyroid problem as that contributes to the dog's skin problems."
AskVet,39y9bb,Al-Capony,3,Mon Jun 15 19:45:17 2015 UTC,"Depends entirely on if the previous owners could prove ownership. If there are previous medical records, descriptions of the dog, pictures in the first owner's possession, a microchip, etc, then legally yes the second owner would have to give the dog back. They are the legal owner. If you just found a car with the keys in it...you can't just take it and claim that it's yours. Pets are property in the eyes of the law."
AskVet,39y9bb,Tobimaru,2,Mon Jun 15 20:01:55 2015 UTC,"To piggy back on this question, cause now I'm thinking about it. Would a vet actually do anything or just call the police?"
AskVet,39y9bb,idomoodou2,2,Tue Jun 16 01:45:52 2015 UTC,"We have clients who bring in pets that they've found as strays all the time. We don't actively go searching through ""missing pet"" fliers to see if it belongs to somebody. We scan for a microchip and go from there.  If the pet has a microchip, we will make every attempt to contact the registered owner, despite what the client wants or says. Oftentimes people will find strays and want to keep it, not realizing that the pet is chipped and the owners have been looking for their pet for months; sometimes we get ahold of them and they have no interest in having their pet returned to them.  But if there is a microchip, or if the (previous) owners can prove ownership, then yes, it's our ethical and legal responsibility to attempt to contact the owner and leave it at that.  If there is no microchip, then it's their word against a flier's, at which point we remove ourselves from the situation."
AskVet,39wyfw,babyblanka,4,Mon Jun 15 14:01:29 2015 UTC,"Spines can be tricky to treat. One major factor for the outcome is how much, if any, sensation he retained. Can he use his legs at all? Did he improve at all over the weekend?  I would ask the surgeon what they think his chances of making a full recovery are. I'd also ask about post-op care and how long he will stay with them so you have time to prepare what you need to at home or find a physio.   I've seen a lot of these dogs get better (after surgery) but they don't usually become right overnight. It takes weeks/months of effort and work from both of you. One dog that had a happy outcome was on the front page a few days ago."
AskVet,39wyfw,dashclone,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:49:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you for responding!   He can use his legs some, I'd say it's about 50/50 - he falls in the grass but on the sidewalk he's a little bit better, can go maybe 5-10 steps before falling.   I don't think he improved over the weekend. I wanted to see improvement so I think maybe I tricked myself into thinking he was progressing, but my husband says no... it's the same.    We're willing to work as hard as we can to help him - this dog is our life. We love his personality and we're devastated at the thought of him not being the same. It's so painful to watch :(   Would the surgeon tell us if he cannot make a recovery? I mean, are there scenarios where they deny a dog surgery because of the condition?"
AskVet,39wyfw,dashclone,3,Mon Jun 15 14:53:16 2015 UTC,"The surgeon will be honest with you if you ask. They want the best for your dog as well. They would never deny a dog surgery, but they may suggest it isn't in his best interests.  It's good that he still has some movement. The cases with the worst prognosis are where the dog just drags the back legs and has no sensation at all back there."
AskVet,39xp2i,VanDelay_Industry,2,Mon Jun 15 17:24:36 2015 UTC,The med was probably cerenia.  I'd go back to the vet and explain that it isn't improving. There are other diagnostics and options available to you still.

Medical Partners need to usually go through an approval process before they can submit cases and are audited to ensure the system is not being abused."

AskVet,39xwsj,Feef12503,3,Mon Jun 15 18:17:24 2015 UTC,"Hmm. It's a fun one that, as far as I know, has no evidence to prove that it works as described. Studies have shown no benefit from hitting the points over just stabbing the poor creature with needles around the sore bit. I can't find the article, but I will if you want.  Some anaesthesia people I know are trying to write a paper on it at the moment suggesting that it does cause relief to patients, but more electro-acupuncture than the regular kind. The theory behind this is the gate theory for pain receptor transmission and modulation of the signal.  If you don't want to go ahead with acupuncture then don't. It's your choice, just as it is the vets job to offer all options. I'd trust a certificate in veterinary acupuncture over homoeopathy any day."
AskVet,39xwsj,dashclone,3,Mon Jun 15 18:48:17 2015 UTC,"I was able to quickly find one review which may be the most recent/up to date (this 2014 paper cites it, and I would guess they'd include the most recent reviews)  My thoughts are while some pets may appear to benefit from it (even ignoring the placebo effect that definitely exists in pets), there isn't evidence that it will work on a significant portion of a population. Meaning I would never recommend it as a first line/over more tested therapies. No harm (except for wallet) in trying, but it's obviously your choice."

AskVet,39xwsj,jadeeyes1113,4,Tue Jun 16 05:22:36 2015 UTC,"Part of the problem with proving acupuncture makes a difference is how exactly do you set up a good study? You can't really have a control to compare to. You would need to compare the same dog with and without treatment, which of course isn't possible. Which is possibly why there are no good papers saying that it helps. The other possibility is of course that it doesn't work.  Personally my dog seems to get a lot of benefit from and enjoy his acupuncture sessions. There is a noticeable difference in how sore his back is before vs after treatments. I know other dogs who are the same. I've seen horses enjoy it too. Every animal is different though, some don't respond well or don't tolerate it. Overall, my soon to be professional opinion is that just because a vet recommends acupuncture certainly doesn't mean they are a bad vet. I plan on earning a certificate after I qualify in less than a year's time so I hope not at least."
AskVet,39xwsj,dashclone,2,Mon Jun 15 19:26:53 2015 UTC,"If I were doing it (and I plan to if I can persuade some to let me) it would be as a complementary therapy. I would find dogs with chronic pain problems, probably OA, who were stable on some NSAID.   I would then get someone to score them using one of the chronic pain score scales for dogs. Next take them in to a room for 30 mins for treatment. Either they get acupuncture or not. And then get the same person to repeat pain scores. Neither the owner nor the person scoring knows if they had treatment or not.   That's just my plan though. It would have to be ortho cases as there aren't validated pain scores for dogs that aren't very ortho heavy.  They may ask for research suggestions for an internship project :P"

It could also tell you it's likely neither.   Probably the best things to ask, with any potential findings, are the prognosis, the treatment, and the cost. These seem to make the biggest differences to owners when it comes to decision making- some cats cannot be medicated orally if required, some owners dislike chemo (even after hearing how it's different from in people), and finances are always an important factor to consider."

If you want to see if there's cancer somewhere, you should go see a neurologist for advanced imaging (CT or MRI).  But if it wouldn't change your treatment plan, then there's no reason you have to - many people either can't afford to or choose not to do those tests, and you just understand that without knowing if there's a specific cause, you don't really know what you're treating.

A blood clot is absolutely a possible cause, but the vet should have reasonable idea based on pulses in the foot, how warm it is, if there is anything else abnormal going on...."
AskVet,39ujn0,mw291,3,Sun Jun 14 22:15:29 2015 UTC,You dog is in pain.  It needs immediate attention.  Eye issues are nothing to wait on in you want any chance at saving his vision.  It is a shame your parents didn't follow up with the vet after the initial treatment did not resolve the issue.
AskVet,39ujn0,ironmouse,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:29:54 2015 UTC,Yeah I know.  I am taking him to the vet tomorrow.  Is there anything I can do in the meantime to alleviate the pain for him?

AskVet,39ujn0,Kaydalia,2,Sun Jun 14 23:54:14 2015 UTC,"I strongly recommend seeking out an emergency/after hours facility. It is too difficult to say based on only a description but like ironmouse mentioned, eyes are not to be messed with. There is a small possibility that the medication previously described has caused a complication so try and get it looked at ASAP. Although the ""emergency exam"" is often more expensive, most diagnostic tests are not. So for a difference of 30-40 bucks you could make your boy feel a lot better much sooner, and could also avoid further harm."
AskVet,39u7wa,mistahspecs,3,Sun Jun 14 20:36:27 2015 UTC,Vet. He at least needs to be seen for a physical exam and inflammation management.

I would take some benadryl and maybe ice it, but wouldn't even consider the doc.  However, since it's my dog and I didn't witness any cause, and since he can't tell me what happened, I will be taking him to the vet! Luckily we already had a physical scheduled tomorrow, so it will wait until then."
AskVet,39u7wa,rvtjess,2,Mon Jun 15 05:26:11 2015 UTC,"Key phrase here:   I would take some benadryl   You know what causes your ailment, you don't know what causes your dog's. You also know how to safely treat yourself with OTC products, but you should not do the same with your dog without your vet's recommendation.  I am glad you're taking him in tomorrow, though, but if it gets worse please consider calling them to see if you can't bump up the appointment to be seen a little sooner."
AskVet,39u7wa,rvtjess,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:28:31 2015 UTC,"True that.   Just out of curiosity, is this a sign of something more major that I should be watching for in the meantime? He's been acting like his same ol' ball loving self, so it didn't occur to me that it could be terribly serious."

If you're in the US, you can look into applying for something like Care Credit (not sure if you have something like that where you live), but this pet is obviously suffering and needs to see a vet, regardless of your decision.

AskVet,39tsn7,itsgac,3,Sun Jun 14 18:28:45 2015 UTC,"We cannot offer second opinions, as we cannot diagnose patients we haven't seen. We also cannot comment on another veterinarians treatment, diagnosis, plan, etc. If you would like a second opinion, you'll have to be seen by another vet. Another option is to talk your concerns over with the vet, discuss her new inappetence, etc.  I'm sorry if it does end up that she's having an adverse reaction to the meds- there are plenty of others out there (both topical and oral) that you can get her on after this episode, to make sure that she (and your home) remain flea free. Inappetence and lethargy are some of the more commonly reported adverse events with preventatives (along with vomiting with some of the oral options), but there should be ones she does better with.  I would definitely give her a look over, and see whether there are fleas actually crawling on her, as this could cause her constant alerting/ear twitching, as well as her discomfort and full body shakes. While the preventatives do kill quickly, most won't prevent the flea from jumping on and biting (no matter how fast they kill, fleas bite almost immediately), and 90-95% of the fleas are actually in your home (in various developmental phases)- they'll continue to develop, jump onto your girl, bite, then die."
AskVet,39tsn7,DrDead88,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:16:04 2015 UTC,"That's fair enough, I appreciate your response, though.   Here's the funny part: I picked up my pup to give her the Dawn bath and as soon as I picked her up, I saw a flea on her bottom. I tried to get it, but it scattered. I am not sure how long it's been there, but I know I saw it. Now, I am hesitant to wash off the medicine, at least until tomorrow when my vet's office opens.   Could a dog's ear potentially be twitching even if the flea is not near the ear? I ask because then it would make sense. Aside from continuous vacuuming and cleaning, is there anything I should be doing in my home? I asked my vet and she stated there should be no need for a fogger or anything like that, but now I am wondering if there is anything else I can be doing."
AskVet,39tsn7,DrDead88,3,Sun Jun 14 19:29:43 2015 UTC,"My guess is that the ear twitch is more to her sensing the flea(s) crawling/biting.  Typically, vacuuming of everything that can be vacuumed, and laundering of everything that can be laundered as often as every week for up to 3 months, in addition to monthly flea prevention, is all that's needed to clear an infestation."

I would ask your vet about something like that and to do a skin cytology (fairly simple, quick, and easy to do in the clinic), since obviously you've been following the vet's instructions thus far with no improvement. You may also need a round of oral antibiotics."
AskVet,39tor2,rvtjess,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:00:08 2015 UTC,Is it actually as symmetrical as it looks in the picture?  Has your vet done a thorough oral exam?  Those are similar in appearance to what lips look like when canine teeth are rubbing against them.
AskVet,39sez0,Corgiboat,5,Sun Jun 14 08:32:35 2015 UTC,"You have a definitive  diagnosis of carcinoma, which is a malignant kind of cancer. Cancers are best treated when they are small and haven't spread to other areas. Malignant cancers tend to spread.  Your vet may have recommended wait and see because there was only one spot with the tumor and he likely did an excisional biopsy which is removal of the whole tumor plus surrounding edges. This is sometimes curative provided the cancer hasn't spread to places you cannot see amd there arent microscopic tumors left. Discuss with your vet and ensure that the complete tumor plus the surrounding 3 cm of non-cancerous tissue was excised when he did the surgery. That is the best chance for a cure because you're cutting it all out.  The fact that he did the excision is good, because if there are any of the cancerous cells remaining they should be microscopic and easily treatable  I can't recommend how to proceed but your options are second opinion from another vet, further discussion with your current vet, seeing a specialist oncologist for early treatment.  Keep an eye out for new lumps and bumps in the future. If any show up, definitely vet ASAP. Watch for serious weight loss or loss of appetite.  PS as a side note, her late spaying does predispose her to mammary neoplasias so please routinely examine her yourself for new lumps and bumps."

I just have one small clarification:   The fact that he did the excision is good, because if there are any of the cancerous cells remaining they should be microscopic and easily treatable Is there a definitive way to check for these remaining cancerous cells and get rid of them, or would it be fine to just keep monitoring for new lumps? I'm mostly worried because the lump had been there for years, though it never grew or changed in size."
AskVet,39sez0,littlehamsterz,2,Sun Jun 14 16:55:23 2015 UTC,The way I know of to get rid microscopic tumors is with radiation therapy.  I would consult with an oncologist to determine the best course of action. They may tell you the same thing as your vet or they would definitely know how to tell if there are microscopic tumors remaining since they specialize in tumors.

AskVet,39s7rp,RhoBautRawk,7,Sun Jun 14 06:29:26 2015 UTC,"From a legal standpoint, if she bites anyone and doesn't have an updated rabies vaccine, it's possible that she would have to be euthanized to be tested.  Also, it's not unheard of for bats to come into houses and bite animals and people, and bats are one of the big rabies carriers.  And finally, you can definitely carry things home to your cat from other cats that vaccines protect against - namely panleukopenia, which is the feline parvovirus and can be deadly.  Even if you don't let your cat outside, there's always a possibility that she could escape, no matter how careful you are.  I really can't think of a reason to not vaccinate a cat unless it was super old and had a history of terrible vaccine reactions.  Why take the risk when it's so easily preventable?"

AskVet,39s7rp,tjhoo,5,Sun Jun 14 09:05:55 2015 UTC,"Aside from the other reasons mentioned, if you ever needed to board your cat, the boarding facility would require your cat to be up to date on all vaccines.

AskVet,39s7rp,CoopertheBKE,4,Sun Jun 14 14:33:20 2015 UTC,"Someone else posted something today saying that a bat had gotten inside and was exposed to both her cats, one of whom was only several weeks outdated on rabies.  I don't know the rabies laws for that persons state, but it's possible the only options are euthanize or 6 month strict quarantine.  It is easy to avoid a choice like that if you vaccinate."
AskVet,39s7rp,dashclone,7,Sun Jun 14 06:55:08 2015 UTC,There is a very real possibility that you can transmit things to your cat on your clothes and/or shoes. Even indoor cats should be vaccinated. I don't know about the local rabies vaccination laws but that may be worth looking in to as well.

If there is no infection with the eyes, after the vet visit triple check your humidity in your moist hide and discuss substrates in the hide and the general enclosure.

AskVet,39q1be,RunRunRunTuTu,12,Sat Jun 13 17:15:15 2015 UTC,"I'm really sorry that you had to go through with that, and that your boy had such a rapid decline.   One option, if you really want an answer, is to get a necropsy (autopsy) performed. Other than that, like you said, it is mostly guessing.   Unfortunately, cardiomyopathies can progress rapidly, especially depending on the extent of disease. If there was another underlying factor further compromising his oxygenation (heartworm, asthma, etc), the chances are greater."

While I like hearing a lot of details, especially when going back and forth among providers it can be hard to see the forest for the trees when trying to understand the big picture."
AskVet,39q1be,Kaydalia,4,Sat Jun 13 18:36:53 2015 UTC,"First of all -I'm so sorry. Sudden losses are so difficult to deal with but you brought him to a vet, you sought help, and thus, you did all you could. His loss, though tragic, was not in any way shape or form your fault (or anyone's for that matter).   Dyspnea, or difficulty breathing in cats is very tricky business. Nationwide it is usually caused by heard disease or inflammatory lung disease (""asthma""). But differentiating between the two can be very difficult and unfortunately the treatment for one can harm if the other is the cause. For example, a cat with asthma needs steroids (anti-inflammatories), but steroids can exacerbate a cat with underlying heart disease. This isn't to say anyone did anything wrong, only that these cases are often not straightforward.   With such a rapid decline after steroid administration, it is possible that there was heart disease that worsened to a critical level. The weird thing about heart disease in cats is that 1) it is commonly not associated with a murmur (only 40% of cats with cardiomyopathy have murmurs), and 2) it does not follow rules. That second point means that in addition to fluid in the lungs cats an develop fluid in the pericardial sac - a balloon of tissue enclosing the heart. When full it can restrict heart function and cause sudden death.   In short - I do not know what happened to your boy. There are multiple possibilities but what is important is for you to know that you did what you could, he likely had a serious underlying condition that (like many cats) he tolerated without signs until he was in a critical state, and finally - sometimes we never know and as frustrating as that is please remember that you gave him almost 10 years of a wonderful and loved life."
AskVet,39q1be,skipsteejsprat,3,Sat Jun 13 20:50:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your very kind and informative response. The information about the steroid contraindication is very helpful to me, as it wasn't explained to me by the vets but in hindsight I was wondering if starting dexamethasone earlier would have been appropriate. It's good to know it sounds like they made the right calls. When you're a client and don't understand all the medical decision-making it is hard to evaluate the quality of care so you have to rely on proxies like outcomes and customer service (which were both unsatisfactory on this particular day). The responses here have been very helpful for putting my mind at ease. Thank you."
AskVet,39q1be,littlehamsterz,2,Sun Jun 14 13:18:12 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to second all of this, especially the part about feline heart disease not following rules.  Dogs will usually follow a pattern of coughing for a while, then progressing to increased resp effort, etc.  Cats can progress slowly, all at once, or not at all.  Sorry for your loss, OP.

AskVet,39rnkd,allgoaton,4,Sun Jun 14 02:20:14 2015 UTC,"I am sorry you are caught up in this, but the only people who can weigh in on the situation is the local animal control.  They will have to enforce the rabies laws of your state and county and if they say quarantine or euthanize, then those are your only options.  You can talk to animal control about the option for in-home quarantine, but if they say no, then I would start calling clinics and getting prices for quarantine.   Fingers crossed the rabies comes back negative for the bat.  Rabies is one disease where because of its fatal nature the laws err on the side of extreme to prevent deaths in human populations. It can super suck for our pets, but it is something that still kills thousands world wide, so laws are strict on exposure in domestic animals."

I just can't believe it.   Thank you for you time. I just hope and hope and hope that this bat was not rabid."

But we aren't just guardians of your pet's health but the public health at large when it comes to zoonotic diseases.  Being not intimately involved in the situation, I can understand the reasons used by animal control agencies when it comes to potential rabies exposure, but being a pet owner I also understand the kick to the gut this can be.  All you really can do is wait for the rabies test to come back and hope its negative."

I have always recommended crayon shavings (like you get after sharpening)  and they are easier to digest.  Crayon lacing should also work for occasional vomit as well.  I've used the trick before & had no problems.     If the vomit is mostly undigested food,  the problem is likely caused by eating too much and/or too fast.   There are many great ideas online to deal with this issue.  But,  if the food is digested & the vomit is liquid,  discolored or foamy - he needs to be seen by a Vet to find out what's causing the problem.     Quick question, do you know if the cat has been deliberately eating grass to induce vomiting?   Also, has Owner changed their food recently?"

AskVet,39rg6d,Nyemenya,5,Sun Jun 14 01:01:06 2015 UTC,"I'd try not to worry too much- it definitely could be something as simple as a sprain/strain, she could have stepped on something sharp/thin that didn't produce much blood, etc. While cancer is a possibility, osteosarcoma (likely the type you found on google) would be unusual in her age/breed.   As long as she's otherwise doing well (normal energy, appetite, bathroom habits, breathing, etc) she should be fine overnight- just try and keep her calm and quiet, and try to discourage too much movement. Definitely don't give her any human pain meds, as they can be quite toxic."

AskVet,39q03x,socalfusions,4,Sat Jun 13 17:04:58 2015 UTC,"Trauma, horrible infections, cancer, etc are all that come to mind.   Another potential cause of trauma could be a seizure, if she's had any history of it, if you've found her disoriented, if she's randomly had bowel movements or urinated outside the box, etc."
AskVet,39q03x,DrDead88,2,Sat Jun 13 17:39:23 2015 UTC,"What would cause the bowel movements outside of the box to cause the trauma to her tongue? Will the blood test show if she has cancer? She has become more clumsy when jumping to the sink when she wants to drink water sometimes falling back down, etc. Perhaps she could have bitten her tongue during one of her spills. As far as I'm aware she doesn't have seizures but I can see how that would be a likely cause."
AskVet,39q03x,leonmon,3,Sat Jun 13 17:56:02 2015 UTC,"Sorry, those last symptoms I was listing were describing signs you may see with a seizure- they become disoriented after, typically evacuate their bowels/bladder during, etc.   Difficulty jumping wouldn't necessarily indicate a balance issue, as arthritis is almost guaranteed at that age (in fact, about 90% of cats will have radiographic/xray evidence of arthritis, in one study).   The cancer and horrible infection would be local, as in, right there on the tongue, which your vet did not seem to suspect. Most cancers aren't appreciable on bloodwork, though some are."

AskVet,39qjls,JCoda413,7,Sat Jun 13 19:54:53 2015 UTC,"Diagnosing a UTI doesn't typically involve a huge vet bill. Your dog needs a exam and at minimum a urinalysis run. If that is enough to confirm the presence of an infection your dog will be prescribed antibiotics. You can talk to the vet about trying an appropriate antibiotic that could be otten from a human pharmacy (which typically have cheap generics). Ideally a urine culture and sensitivity would be sent out to determine the most effective antibiotic, but many veterinarians don't require this unless the UTI isnt responding to broad spectrum antibiotics.   This is all to say that unfortunately there is nothing you can do at home. A UTI needs antibiotics to resolve. They can be quite a painful condition to have so it should really be checked out and dealt with soon."

AskVet,39pdk3,DrDead88,5,Sat Jun 13 14:10:57 2015 UTC,"One of the most common side effects of Comfortis (spinosad, as the effect can also be seen with Trifexis) is GI upset and vomiting. Since OPs dog recently had a bout of pancreatitis, the vet had advised them to wait on dosing.   Otherwise, as with all FDA approved drugs, it is generally well tolerated and efficacious, when used according to the product label/dosing guidelines."
AskVet,39pdk3,rvtjess,3,Sat Jun 13 14:16:18 2015 UTC,"It is also contraindicated in dogs with a history of seizures, as the product itself doesn't cause seizures but lowers the seizure threshold, making it easier for them to have seizures."
AskVet,39pdk3,DrDead88,5,Sat Jun 13 15:32:55 2015 UTC,"Technically not a contraindication, per product label/FDA. It's not even a warning (unlike high dose ivermectin). It's a precaution. Nitpicky I know, but there are very real differences between the classifications.  I'd have to bust out the full product information, but from what I can easily access now (Here) the only reported seizures were in epileptic dogs that received an inappropriate/off label dose. Other epileptic dogs receiving an appropriate dose did not experience seizures.  Personally, while I would obviously have to discuss the precaution with an owner of an (well controlled) epileptic dog, I'd have no problem dispensing it to them if the product fit their needs."
AskVet,39pdk3,rvtjess,3,Sat Jun 13 15:51:49 2015 UTC,"Good to know, thanks. This is what we've been telling clients at our clinic, but now I have solid information about it. Thanks!  It's sucky that Trifexis has such a bad rap (gotta love the media, eh?), as it really is a great product in dogs that tolerate it (and let's be honest, most of the vomiting I've seen occurs because owners are not giving it with a full meal)."
AskVet,39pdk3,shitidneversay,3,Sat Jun 13 15:57:42 2015 UTC,"Ask your vet about using a topical (such as Advantage, Revolution, etc.) for this month's dose of a flea prevention. You should be able to use the Comfortis again once she is in the clear, but that should definitely be with your vet's advisement.  If you are seeing fleas on your pup, there are definitely some in the environment (in the house, the yard) so look into treating that, as well."

Feliway can definitely help fearful cats be more comfortable, and it's awesome that he has bonded with your other cat.  Just go slow, speak softly, and give it time:). When I first got one of my cats, he hid for weeks, but I would just sit in the room and go about my business and eventually he became a lot more social.  Even so, he still is much more skittish than my other cat, he hates getting picked up, and always runs from loud noises.  But things like that don't mean they're not generally happy:)  You can also try giving the shy cat treats or kibbles immediately when he lets you pet him, or just randomly.

AskVet,39nxfo,Chansharp,5,Sat Jun 13 02:50:37 2015 UTC,"Seizures are a symptom, not a disease.  They can be caused by toxin exposure, structural brain issues, cancer, and a slew of various diseases and parasites.  The only way to know what is the cause of the seizures is to allow your cat's doctor to start running tests.  Basic full panel blood work to include parasite and virals is a start.  Depending on your location, adding in tick and fungal are also a good idea.  If blood work doesn't give an answer, the next step is to consult with a neurologist who will most likely recommend brain imaging.  Once you have done all the testing your checkbook can handle (blood is a must), then you can discuss management with your cat's vet.    If you cannot afford any testing or long term treatment, discuss other options with your vet."
AskVet,39nxfo,Neryian,3,Sat Jun 13 03:52:21 2015 UTC,There are a multitude of reasons and causes for seizures. It really is impossible for us to tell you what it could be. This is something that you should be continuing to work with your vet with.

If a dog is incontinent or has a uti, they won't choose where and when to dribble or have accidents (i.e. just at daycare) - it's out of their control.  Definitely still worth getting checked out though, especially given the history."

AskVet,39ndcc,rvtjess,2,Fri Jun 12 23:53:13 2015 UTC,"A vet-grade flea prevention. They come as topicals, orals, or collars. OTC products are typically a waste of money. Yes, the vet products are more expensive, but that's because they WORK.  Regardless of the method you choose, you will need to use it on every pet in the household for a minimum of 3 months. If the pet has had them for awhile, chances are likely that you have a problem in your house that needs to be treated, too.  Treating the pet is only one step... if you don't treat the environment, the pet will just continue getting reinfested.  My personal favorites: * Topical: Vectra3D * Oral: Bravecto * Collar: Seresto or Scalibor  Shampoos and dips are a waste of money as they generally have zero residual effect. They will kill fleas currently on the pet but will do nothing to prevent reinfestation, and water alone is enough to kill fleas."

AskVet,39mjjt,-spython-,4,Fri Jun 12 21:40:27 2015 UTC,"Personally I am salaried.  The majority of the vets in the US are on pro-salary.  All based off of a percent of production.  The average is about 20% for services and a lower amount for products.  They get a base salary, if the base is less than the 20% (often looked at monthly or quarterly) they get a bonus for the difference.  So, work more hours get more money in general.  But slow days can really suck for the vet."

AskVet,39mhrd,ssegal72,2,Fri Jun 12 19:56:34 2015 UTC,"VIN is probably the main platform when it comes to information, as far as online goes. There are a multitude of journals spanning every specialty as well, though most people probably only subscribe to a few of interest.   A lot of information is disseminated at conferences- most states require a certain number of CE (continuing education) hours every year to maintain a license, and the easiest way to get them done at once is to attend a conference (again, ones across various specialties, most states have them, ones for regions, etc) and knock them all out. These are mostly lectures about new information from specialists or pros in their fields, and then drug companies and other business aspects have booths for perusing in between lectures/on breaks.   AVMA is the national organization (unfortunately), though I don't think there's too much actual interaction via that platform (EDIT: aside from the annual conference). Every state has a board/vet med association as well."

You should consider getting a drinking fountain that circulates and filters the water to makes sure she drinks enough when it's hot.   Anecdote: my puppy was not that keen on drinking water and had to be constantly ""reminded"", then we went to a friend's house whose dog had a water fountain and she loved it, drank much more water than she ever did at home without cajoling. We got her a fountain that same day and now she'll drink from it regularly during the day and will always go to it to drink rather than to her water bowl, even though we keep both freshly filled."

I think there are a few different styles, some are circular like ours, where the water flows out of the middle others have a spout like the one suggested above. I hadn't really seen a design like the one you had before but it looks potentially kind of awkward/shallow for the cat to get its face in/under? (totally non-expert guess!) Maybe try one of the ones with a spout and water flowing down, since that is most close to the design of a sink tap with water flowing down, which you already know she likes? We just went with the circular one because that is the kind our dog tested out and approved at our friend's place! Or you could ask the pervious owner what kind they had. I think the spout kind seems to be the most common, it's the kind they have assembled and filled up on the floors of all the pet shops we've been to, so the doggy customers can have a drink."

He will need to be anesthetized to have all that gunk flushed out and only then can the vet start to see what's happening under all of that. There may need to be xrays to determine the extent, but it definitely does need to be treated. I would say it's unlikely that antibiotics contributed to the current issue at all.

AskVet,39isxh,motherofpoops,3,Fri Jun 12 00:35:57 2015 UTC,"I recommend working with your vet to find a dog food that better suits your dog. After ruling out parasites, a trial diet change may be the next step depending on what your vet says. Not all animals react the same to each food so you will need to try it out and see how your dog does.  Nutrients must be available and absorbable by your dog to actually mean anything. That is the meaning of a higher quality food. There are many good options that have done feeding trials in live animals to show that the nutrients are available. I would talk to your vet about finding a different food if he can't find a medical cause for your concern."
AskVet,39isxh,littlehamsterz,4,Fri Jun 12 03:45:23 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to delete your comment, but the site you mentioned is one of the worst possible places to find information about nutrition.  Is is written by a human dentist with a chip on his shoulder.  That is some /r/pets level stuff right there.  Edit: Reposting the good info you provided.   Has he been to the vet to be properly treated for worms and to check for other medical causes? That would be the first step. There are medical problems that can cause chronic GI upset.  Poor quality diets with lots of fillers will also cause pets to have more frequent/larger BMs than a more caloric-dense, readily absorbable food will.  Also, dietary changes can cause GI upset, so try not feeding a bunch of different stuff (but it sounds like he's been on the same diet for a few months now).  TL;DR: Visit a vet."

But there are always more, it seems!  Did your vet by chance take an X-ray?  What might feel like this flat chest thing could be something else called pectus excavatum, which is where the sternum (bones to which ribs attach in the front) is indented instead of being flat.  It's not uncommon in kittens, and if it's not severe they're usually fine.  Whatever the issue, if this kitten is having respiratory difficulty, the prognosis is probably not very good.  But if she continues to eat, gain weight (even if it's not as quickly as her littermates), and remains bright and alert, she could very well be fine.  I would really hesitate to try and make a splint or anything similar at home...kittens grow really quickly anyway and she would likely outgrow whatever you made every few days.

She's not panting and doesn't seem to be out of breath- her breaths aren't as deep as the other two, but that makes sense, given her ribcage right now. Should I be looking for anything specific, or should it be pretty obvious if she's having difficulty breathing?   I'll wait on the splint for now to see if anything changes for her- mostly I just want her to be comfortable and not stressed. If these are her last few days on earth, I want them to be good ones.

AskVet,39f687,Urgullibl,3,Thu Jun 11 14:16:42 2015 UTC,"The dogs that are head pressing against a wall or other surface are pretty ""out of it"" while doing so. If your dog is obviously conscious while doing this, it's not the sort of head pressing that can be a symptom of a medical issue."
AskVet,39d8gx,boringoldcookie,21,Wed Jun 10 23:58:24 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you lost your furry friend Penny. Since we don't know the cause of her illness, it's impossible to know whether she might've had hypertension at all, or whether earlier intervention would have changed anything. Whether she had congestive heart failure or cancer or something else entirely, we will never know without a necropsy. I think it's important for you not to agonize over what ifs when those answers are unknowable. You sought medical care and treatment for her, and you chose a peaceful, painless death for her when it was clear she no longer had good quality of life. It sounds like you did your best for her and obviously loved her very much, so don't beat yourself up over hypotheticals. Focus on the many happy, healthy years you had together."
AskVet,39d8gx,haggieneko,3,Thu Jun 11 00:44:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I guess this is the only answer I can get without you being some sort of psychic or me having a definitive diagnosis. All I can really do is try to get past the guilt and next time if my gut tells me something is wrong (like with her glassy eyes) act on it. I wish it didn't go down like this, I wish she could have lived forever because honestly she was the best cat I've ever known. Every good trait and none of the bad ones. Not a single behavioural problem, she only dealt in love and sweetness. She was so patient with everybody.  If you wouldn't mind humoring me though, is glassy eyes a symptom of any sort of disease? So that if I see it in another cat I'll know if I need to act."
AskVet,39d8gx,haggieneko,2,Thu Jun 11 03:30:49 2015 UTC,"Glassy eyes isn't really a symptom, unless you mean watery or runny eyes. Your description sounds more like she was staring off into space, or like mentally, she was elsewhere, but do correct me if I'm wrong. Cats are masters at hiding illness from us until it's really bad, so I suppose spacing out could have been an early indicator that she wasn't feeling quite right, but hindsight is 20/20. So I guess my best advice is to trust your instincts and have your pet examined if you feel like something's a little off."
AskVet,39emyu,In_Devils_Boots,3,Thu Jun 11 05:36:50 2015 UTC,"Have you looked into using laxatone? And frequent brushing.  If he is sick or in pain now, he needs to go to the vet to ensure he doesn't have another blockage. No product or diet will fix a blockage. How long ago was the surgery?"
AskVet,39emyu,rvtjess,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:46:55 2015 UTC,"The surgery was approximately 6 weeks ago.  I called the vet yesterday because 2 days ago, he started exhibiting the same behavior as he did when he first got sick ( isolating, not eating, not interacting with his 'brother' or with his pet parents' )  He is behaving more normally this morning, (eating, drinking, using the litter box, etc even playing / chasing his brother) thankfully.  As for the laxatone, the vet mentioned it, and is sending us a container of it, hopefully it'll be here tomorrow.  Going to the pet store today, for brushes, and seriously considering getting him shaved ( just for the summer )  i am hoping that i can keep my little guy from going thru any more pain and/or discomfort."
AskVet,39emyu,rvtjess,6,Thu Jun 11 13:31:25 2015 UTC,Shaving for a medical reason is absolutely justified!
AskVet,39crr9,t_bex,22,Wed Jun 10 22:03:46 2015 UTC,"So sorry for your loss.  It's impossible to know exactly what happened without a necropsy.  It does, however, sound consistent with some sort of vascular event, like a clot or stroke.  The fact that his eyes were vacant and his body was stiff and rigid most likely means he was brain dead at that point.   I don't think he suffered at all.   CPR at that point would not have brought Bosco back.  You gave him a very long life and did all you could for him."
AskVet,39crr9,skipsteejsprat,10,Wed Jun 10 22:16:24 2015 UTC,"These were my suspicions as well. And I feel increasingly at ease because your response corresponds with /u/goatsickle. It seems a morbid thing to say, but I certainly hope he was brain dead. He had hind leg spasms once in his middle-age, and he was so frightened and in so much pain...I would hate to imagine his state of  body/mind, had he been conscious during the episode. Thank you so much for your compassion, I appreciate it so much."
AskVet,39crr9,goatsickle,12,Wed Jun 10 22:38:41 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear about your buddy.  It sounds like there was nothing you could have done...CPR at home in that situation would not have brought him back.  Likely cause of death in that scenario would be some kind of neurologic event - a stroke or a particularly devastating seizure.  Something related to his heart is always possible too.  Honestly, it sounds like he was unaware of his surroundings from the time it started, so I think it's very unlikely that he suffered.  It's a tough way for you to watch him go, but you should try to focus on his great long life of scavenging fruit in the backyard.  He was lucky to have you, you were lucky to have him, and in the end that's what matters most."
AskVet,39crr9,Urgullibl,6,Wed Jun 10 22:16:31 2015 UTC,"You sound credible and forthcoming, but even if you are offering a comforting, best-case scenario, I'll take it. In a family of 5, I am the oldest (26) and still living at home (grad student), so Bosco helped me adjust to living alone with my parents and also offered his aging self as the perfect subject for me to play older-sibling to. I guess it is this dynamic that causes me to feel some responsibility and guilt, especially because I was the only one present at the start and end of the episode--I felt like I shouldn't have let him get so excited while barking, like I allowed the trace amounts of cyanide in the plum stones to poison him, like my first call should have been to my mom and siblings so they could have said 'goodbye'...anyway, all that over-burdens the grief I already feel. The student in me always feels like ""research solves all,"" but the internet was turning up so many mixed opinions that nothing satisfactorily answered my questions. I know I am asking the impossible, but I am so grateful and will hold fast to your answer. Thank you for allowing me the peace of mind to move past the episode and take some comfort in your kind, reassuring words."
AskVet,39crr9,sarahabea,6,Wed Jun 10 22:34:06 2015 UTC,"Sounds like he lost consciousness pretty early in the process. What you saw were likely all involuntary reflexes, so I'd say it's unlikely he suffered. Impossible to be sure about the cause of death without a necropsy, but I would second /u/goatsickle that this sounds like a neurological event. Speculating further, the coughing could indicate some degree of heart failure, which in turn can increase the risk of blood clots forming that can cause strokes. I'm not saying that's what it was, but it definitely sounds like brain damage (likely irreparable) occurred very early during the event.  But yeah, dogs don't live forever, and 12.5 is pretty good for a Lab. CPR doesn't have good chances of bringing back a dog even under optimal circumstances, and it would almost certainly not have helped your dog."
AskVet,39crr9,sarahabea,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:24:50 2015 UTC,Thank you. I am glad to hear that he was likely unconscious and I feel even better knowing that all of the fits and spasms were involuntary reflexes. Please know your words have also helped to put my mom's very troubled mind (and heart) a little more at ease.
AskVet,39crr9,DildoTsunami,3,Thu Jun 11 00:51:19 2015 UTC,"I am so sorry for your loss and what you went through. Thank you for sticking by him in his last moments. You did everything you could. You are very brave, OP. Again, so so sorry."
AskVet,39crr9,DildoTsunami,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:25:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I sure don't feel very brave, but Bosco was there for me for so much and for so long...in a way, I am really quite glad I was able to be there with him in his last moments, if only so wouldn't die alone. This thread and all of the generous responders have been an unexpected, but welcomed source of comfort. I feel better now than I did this morning. Thanks again."
AskVet,39crr9,serendipitybot,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:50:56 2015 UTC,"No problem. It was very brave of you to stick by him, truly. In his last moments, he was loved..and that's when it matters most."
AskVet,39crr9,kirsti27s,2,Thu Jun 11 13:42:59 2015 UTC,"I'm so very sorry for your loss. Reading this was simply heartbreaking. :( My dog Sam died in a very similar fashion 7 years ago. He had been diagnosed with heart failure after we brought him to the vet due to coughing, much like you're describing. Apparently, when the heart is failing, fluid can get in the lungs and a cough is often a sign of late-stage heart failure at which pount life expectancy is relatively short. Anyhow one night, he coughed and basically fell over, andurinated and defacated. My husband was taking him to the emergency vet when he died in the car on the way there. Apparently he had a massive cardiac event that ended his life. I know that doesn't answer your question about suffering, but maybe gives you an idea about what may have happened. Again, my condolences. I'm so grateful he wasn't alone and that your voice and touch were the last things he experienced."
AskVet,39crr9,kirsti27s,1 point,Sat Jun 13 08:49:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your response, truly. I never imagined I was the first dog-owner to experience such an event, but it is a bit comforting being acquainted with someone who went through something similar. I am sorry for your loss, also. Reading that your Sam passed when he was 7 makes me feel so selfish for not wanting to let my Bosco go after 12--but I guess no matter how long you have them, you can never be ready to lose them. And you have actually managed to help a smaller, but lingering question I had about the correlation between coughing and heart failure. Thanks again."
AskVet,39crr9,Shortandsweet33,2,Tue Jun 16 20:17:35 2015 UTC,"You're very welcome. Again, I'm so sorry."
AskVet,39dyln,Plewto,2,Thu Jun 11 02:45:28 2015 UTC,"You need to go to a vet to ensure that it hasn't herniated into the abdominal cavity and intestines or other organs aren't squeezing through. This can be life threatening, so I would strongly consider getting him in sooner rather than later.  Sure, it could be a topical irritation, but if it was food related or a contact allergen you'd likely be seeing issues in other parts of the body, not just in this one area."
AskVet,39dyln,rvtjess,2,Thu Jun 11 04:19:50 2015 UTC,This is an emergency. Your dog needs to go to the vet ASAP.
AskVet,39dyln,Urgullibl,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:38:40 2015 UTC,"Figured I'd update this in case anyone searches and finds it:  My dog's hernia is an umbilical hernia, so it was pretty small and there wasn't a huge chance of protrusion according to the vet. We took him in that weekend, by which point his hernia had gone from bright red to purple and the swelling had come down some. She felt around and determined that there was no additional tearing in the hernia and that nothing had pushed through into the space.  The final diagnosis was pretty mundane: she figured he'd managed to bash it/scrape it on something and just flat-out bruised it. The swelling and color went away over the course of the week, and he's no worse for wear."
AskVet,39cf88,pookie74,2,Wed Jun 10 20:45:05 2015 UTC,Is there a question?

AskVet,39cf88,littlehamsterz,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:12:55 2015 UTC,I did. Apparently my question is missing.
AskVet,39cf88,goatsickle,2,Wed Jun 10 21:49:19 2015 UTC,"My apologies. I tried to edit with my question and it's still missing. Asking if this treatment is common before moving on to XRays, biopsies, and so on. This seems to have happened very suddenly. I play with her constantly so when I saw discoloration and felt lumps, my heart dropped. Thank you in advance and my apologies for any errors. First time posting here."
AskVet,39cf88,goatsickle,5,Wed Jun 10 21:54:23 2015 UTC,"We can't second guess your vet's decision given that we haven't seen the issue in person.  If you're concerned that it's not being diagnosed and/or treated properly, best bet is to call and request an appointment for further testing, or to seek a second opinion."
AskVet,39eoko,Sockmonkee,3,Thu Jun 11 05:50:14 2015 UTC,There isn't really anything we can say. It looks like you've gone through each of the options available and they aren't particularly suitable. My only other suggestion would be to look for a larger cage that you can transport her in. It might not be as confining as a crate and she may be happier.
AskVet,39eoko,dashclone,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:27:58 2015 UTC,sounds like a good solution.  Thank you for your time.
AskVet,39eoko,JaslanTheXIII,3,Thu Jun 11 22:26:03 2015 UTC,My friend had a cat that hated o the crate. So my friend decided to train the cat. She started out by placing the crate in the same room as the cat and just leaving it there. A little later she placed a towel in it and some food to make it seem like a nice place to be. The food managed to lure the cat in and over time the cat became more and more comfortable with the crate. If the cat needs to go to the vet she throws some food in the crate and waits for the cat to walk in. Over time the cat became so comfortable with the crate that it hangs out in there. Training the cat like this might not help with your problem right now but could come in handy in the future.
AskVet,39eoko,JaslanTheXIII,1 point,Thu Jun 11 09:17:51 2015 UTC,I had her about 1/2 in the crate after luring her with treats - but the movement of me going toward the door tipped her off and made her run.  I have left the crate out and continue to throw treats in - but it's not going to be the quick solution we need :( Thank you for your advice and time.
AskVet,39eoko,belatedlove,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:27:47 2015 UTC,It is probably not the most efficient measure for right now but I think it will pay off in the long run. Maybe try the towel trick again while wearing some heavy gardening gloves. Might protect you from a few scratches.
AskVet,39eoko,Tobimaru,1 point,Fri Jun 12 07:20:02 2015 UTC,I had on oven mitts. And jeans. And a jacket.  I felt safe without a helmet :P
AskVet,39eoko,Tobimaru,3,Fri Jun 12 16:58:46 2015 UTC,"It really does sound like she needs to go in to have that mass examined, even if that may involve some kicking and screaming on her end. Your best bet is probably to keep it as quick as possible - place a thick towel over her, and scoop her and the towel up into the carrier in one quick motion (a larger one like Dashclone has suggested), then keep it covered and dark for the rest of the journey to the vet."
AskVet,39d1y3,anontea,6,Wed Jun 10 23:12:07 2015 UTC,You should be calling your vet.  If they are not open you should be calling the nearest ER.  If that mouse was killed by rodenticides you do NOT want to be waiting to see if a problem develops.
AskVet,39d1y3,ironmouse,3,Wed Jun 10 23:39:42 2015 UTC,Ok thanks. I have been making phone calls!
AskVet,39d1y3,rvtjess,3,Thu Jun 11 00:15:52 2015 UTC,"If there is a concern about poison ingestion, absolutely call your vet. It's impossible for us to say whether you should be worried or not, because we don't know if the mouse was exposed to anything. In my opinion, I'd rather be safe than sorry."
AskVet,39d1y3,tehMunkee,-3,Thu Jun 11 04:00:29 2015 UTC,"There's no way of knowing whether the mouse will prove harmful or not. How much does your dog weigh?  Vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy are some of the big signs that you need to go to the vet."
AskVet,39d1y3,ironmouse,9,Wed Jun 10 23:38:28 2015 UTC,The bigger worry is bleeding out from a rodenticide induced coagulopathy.
AskVet,39bet5,SamsquamtchHunter,4,Wed Jun 10 16:52:40 2015 UTC,"There unfortunately isn't much you can do at home apart from rest him. Possibly ice wrapped in a towel might help. It sounds like he has hurt the paw - licking is a sign of discomfort - rather than anywhere else. Did he fall or twist on the paw?  If he isn't using the leg at all I would take him to a vet today if possible. Otherwise strict rest, walks on the lead, out to pee/poop and then back inside. No human pain meds as they are bad for dogs."
AskVet,39bet5,dashclone,2,Wed Jun 10 17:16:31 2015 UTC,"He's definitely less active today, he will use it on some steps and take hops on others, never full weight though."
AskVet,39bet5,dashclone,3,Wed Jun 10 17:24:42 2015 UTC,Honestly it may be worth an x-ray today if he's that sore. Even if the vet decides against the x-ray they will still give you some doggy pain meds that will make him feel happier and heal faster.
AskVet,39bet5,littlehamsterz,4,Wed Jun 10 17:27:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, ruptured his crucial ligament and will need surgery.... At least I had a nice tax return this year.  Guess I should look into insurance for him as well. This is a bit of a wake up call."
AskVet,39bet5,littlehamsterz,2,Thu Jun 11 01:01:00 2015 UTC,"If considering insurance, keep in mind any preexisting injuries will not be covered by any policy. There are many good ones it there. Some have annual deductibles while others have per incident deductibles so read it carefully. Look at the exclusions carefully. Keep in mind you will still have to pay upfront for reimbursement later."
AskVet,39bet5,rvtjess,2,Thu Jun 11 02:40:20 2015 UTC,"I figured we wouldn't be able to get anything related to this covered, but who knows what could come up in the future.  I wasn't really aware of the whole back yard breeder situation when I got him, and who knows whats lurking in his genes yet to surface...  Lesson learned I guess."
AskVet,39cvv7,ScreamNYaK,2,Wed Jun 10 22:30:01 2015 UTC,"GI problems + lethargy (yes, even ""a little bit"") = vet visit. Give them a call.  Also, very likely unrelated to the heat."

AskVet,39c4mm,jwalsh0146,3,Wed Jun 10 19:39:59 2015 UTC,"Xrays are good for bone, ultrasound is good for soft tissue and more precise applications. You might get both if looking at GI disease. X-rays to rule out foreign body (with contrast if necessary) and ultrasound to look at specific areas. There are probably better examples but it's late here."
AskVet,39c4mm,dashclone,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:20:25 2015 UTC,"No that's great. Thank you. I have a cat losing weight with fine blood, stool and urine so next step is x ray/ ultrasound."
AskVet,39c4mm,Urgullibl,2,Wed Jun 10 21:47:45 2015 UTC,"Ultrasound sucks at visualizing bones. X-rays are not very good at visualizing details of internal organs. Plus the concept of what you see on them is very different for the two: X-rays show you everything added on top of everything else, while an ultrasound shows you a 2-dimensional plane that cuts through the body. It's thus much easier to get a general idea of what's going on with an X-ray, which then helps you decide where you should point your ultrasound."
AskVet,39cqz8,Jessicaward25,5,Wed Jun 10 21:58:58 2015 UTC,"Should we take him to the vet?   Yes, it could be a wound of some sort.  The red stuff is blood.  Please take him to a vet for treatment."

AskVet,39cqz8,twiggysrabies,6,Thu Jun 11 02:38:50 2015 UTC,"My rule of thumb is that if you are questioning if he needs to go to the vet, then he needs to go to the vet.  Those look like abscesses and need to be thoroughly examined, and possibly aspirated.  If he continues to lick at the area it will become infected without treatment.  Take him to the vet as soon as possible."
AskVet,39cqz8,rvtjess,2,Wed Jun 10 22:21:25 2015 UTC,"It is very hard to tell anything from the photos. This could be a number of things, from a cuterebra to an abscess to a fight wound. Regardless, this needs medical attention."

AskVet,39dviq,littlehamsterz,5,Thu Jun 11 02:42:58 2015 UTC,"Is your dog squinting/winking at you? My concern would be a corneal defect (ulcer). They are painful and if not treated promptly can lead to loss of vision. Definitely get into the vet tomorrow. Ulcers are very painful.

AskVet,39dviq,rvtjess,3,Thu Jun 11 02:52:31 2015 UTC,"This absolutely requires a vet visit. You should not play the ""wait and see"" game with eye problems, as you can have major issues."

AskVet,39cltw,littlehamsterz,2,Wed Jun 10 22:49:56 2015 UTC,Prophylactically due to breed
AskVet,39cltw,littlehamsterz,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:43:28 2015 UTC,I think it just boils down to letting the eye heal up before pursuing further elective surgery. Not fun for the body to have to work on healing several areas.  Discuss with your vet to find the best option.
AskVet,39cltw,Vasopressin,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:36:11 2015 UTC,If the same vet is doing both surgeries I would say do them together. It saves her the stress of being put under general twice and saves you the money of having to pay for anesthesia and pain medication twice.

AskVet,39djju,Urgullibl,5,Thu Jun 11 01:18:51 2015 UTC,"Then you should take her back to the vet and ask for more diagnostics. 10 is by no means ancient for a Chihuahua, so this isn't likely to be normal aging."
AskVet,39big8,kisakouyama,5,Wed Jun 10 17:16:51 2015 UTC,"Just so you know, you should avoid rapidly changing a dog's diet. Generally changing food should occur over 5 days in gradually increasing amounts of new food. Ex: first day 3/4 old food and 1/4 new. Rapid changes causes diarrhea and upset stomach."
AskVet,39big8,littlehamsterz,2,Wed Jun 10 17:53:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, thank you! u/dashclone mentioned this above."
AskVet,39big8,dashclone,3,Wed Jun 10 18:10:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, dog food can change the colour of the poop. If my own dog eats too many red treats he produces a wonderful range from orange/red to brown as they get out of his system.   Food can definitely change the consistency, with the most likely cause being the sudden change in food. If you do intend to switch food in the future it is best done over a few days to prevent this kind of thing."
AskVet,39big8,Urgullibl,2,Wed Jun 10 17:31:28 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! And I will be sure to take it slowly with new food. This is exactly what I needed. :)
AskVet,39big8,rvtjess,2,Wed Jun 10 17:36:23 2015 UTC,"It's quite possible. As long as he shows no general symptoms (lack of appetite, lethargy, pale gums, fever etc.), and as long as his poop is back to normal, he should be fine. Talk to your vet about what deworming schedule they recommend when you get the chance.  Blood in his stool can appear in two forms: Fresh, which is blood red (duh), and partially digested, which looks either almost black or like coffee grounds. Both are a reason to call your vet."
AskVet,39bi0a,BabytheTardisImpala,6,Wed Jun 10 17:13:52 2015 UTC,"You may have some luck with other vets in the area who would prescribe drugs. Feliway is an amazing product, but there is a limit to what it can achieve. When is the trip? Do you have time to acclimatise the cats to the car?   When driving keep the cats in the carrier. It's a lot safer that way for you and them.  You may find drugs and doses online that non-vet people suggest. I honestly wouldn't trust them because a) the sedation isn't reliable b) it isn't great to sedate an animal for 13 hours without monitoring c) no drug is 100% safe and you may be ages from the nearest vet."

The 13 hours would be over two days, around 6 or 7 hours a day.  Is there anything that I could get without a prescription that I could use?"
AskVet,39bi0a,Urgullibl,2,Wed Jun 10 17:34:24 2015 UTC,"If your cats are food-motivated, you may want to start feeding them in their crates, then gradually start closing the crates, then moving the crates to the car and feeding them there."
AskVet,39bi0a,dashclone,2,Wed Jun 10 17:38:29 2015 UTC,"Acclimatisation can take a while, and it's important to go slowly. First get them used to being in the carriers in the house. Feed them in there, let them explore them and know they are safe. Some Feliway spray in there would be good. Then feed them with the door closed on the carrier. Then no food in the carrier and take them outside and then straight back inside. Then in the car for 2 seconds and back inside. And gradually increase if they are happy. They are are upset take it back a step.  There isn't anything you can get without a prescription that I would use for the reasons above."
AskVet,39bi0a,rvtjess,2,Wed Jun 10 17:44:05 2015 UTC,"If you think you'll need a sedative, I don't recommend using acepromazine. If your vet offers this, request something else. In my experiences, it doesn't tend to work very well in cats, and even if it does, it makes them physically sedate but does nothing to ease their mental anxiety.  Absolutely use a carrier for the entire car ride. You do not want a freaked out cat running loose in your car because they got spooked, or darting out an open door. It's much safer for them and much safer for you to have them confined at all times.

He finallllyyyyy pooped so there's that. Yes he is still on the i/d food and taking the probiotic powder. Every morn n night he gets a dose of lactulose to lube his insides up. I was just worried that after all this he didn't poop for 3 days and started throwing up again! I srsly think he's just a slob and inhales his food and water so fast that he throws it up.

AskVet,396dh6,DrDead88,13,Tue Jun 9 16:52:29 2015 UTC,"One approach may be to tell shelters that you are willing to foster the kitten. A lot of shelters won't take in any animals if they don't have room, but may help you take care of the kitten's vet costs and find her a new home when she's better if you can keep her at your house until she's adopted. Either way she absolutely needs to see a vet. Seizures can be caused by lots of different things, not just toxins."
AskVet,396dh6,erinarian,3,Tue Jun 9 18:04:06 2015 UTC,"On the subject of other causes of seizures, I would be very cautious about handling this kitten, and would strongly recommend having her tested for rabies if she should happen to pass away."
AskVet,396dh6,defective_cat_squad,3,Wed Jun 10 07:52:34 2015 UTC,"To elaborate on the above... there are many, many things that can potentially cause seizures in a young kitten. But if you live in an area where rabies is prevalent, it should always be considered when an animal with an unknown history (such as a stray kitten) develops neurologic signs. You don't want to take any chances with rabies."
AskVet,396dh6,defective_cat_squad,2,Wed Jun 10 08:08:16 2015 UTC,"This is true. The Animal Humane Society gave me litter, dry and wet food, litter boxes, and toys when a stray cat followed me home and had babies in my closet.

You have pretty much done as much as you can do at home and if she has been poisoned she really does need the correct treatment. I know it is tough and veterinary care can be prohibitively expensive, this may be a case where it's better to give her up because she may not survive otherwise."

AskVet,398x8l,Urgullibl,2,Wed Jun 10 07:07:15 2015 UTC,"Based on the results, it is good news that your dog has a regenerative anemia, meaning he is trying his best to keep up with the body's demand for red blood cells by making a ton of them.  Bad news, there are two basic categories of causes for a regenerative anemia. A) increased consumption (hemorrhage) B) Destruction of red cells (hemolysis).  A transfusion will buy your vet extra time to find the cause of the anemia. It does not really fix anything but time is important when it comes to something something as vital as the cell carrying oxygen to the tissues. I think your dog warrants a transfusion because he is showing signs of shock at this point but I am still a vet student, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.  I think the ultrasound is a good idea to rule out acute hemorrhage. If they find free fluid, they will likely need to do a cytology as well. I also think a blood smear would be a good idea to look for signs of hemolysis.  If you do not trust this vet, you could seek a different vet. This issue is serious so you need a vet that will be sure in their decisions.  Cost varies by area so I cannot tell you what is reasonable. Perhaps a vet from your area will answer your questions."

AskVet,394p4v,electromagnetic_rat,5,Tue Jun 9 06:13:58 2015 UTC,"Try either elevating his food bowl, using a slow feeder, or both. It sounds like he's eating too fast and choking"
AskVet,394p4v,rvtjess,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:21:42 2015 UTC,"It would be an incredible relief to me if that was the only reason; I'm so worried it's something serious.

AskVet,394ccz,toooldforusernames,3,Tue Jun 9 04:11:46 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for the surgery itself, but I will touch on age -- age is never a reason not to put a pet under anesthesia, their health status might be. I've monitored plenty of anesthetic procedures on pets 16+ years old that were otherwise in ok health (and some that weren't and had heart issues, kidney issues, etc) and they did ok. You have to weigh the pros and cons -- if bloodwork comes back ok and there are no other underlying medical issues, the pet should be an ok anesthetic candidate. If you're worried, you could also consider having a pre-op ECG done just to rule out any underlying cardiac issues too.  So, age is never a reason to shy away from putting your pet under anesthesia. However, I will recommend consulting with the specialist for a meet and greet, ask questions about the procedure, what s/he thinks the outcome will be of the procedure, etc."
AskVet,394ccz,rvtjess,2,Tue Jun 9 04:39:37 2015 UTC,"If you'll have to euthanize her very soon without the surgery due to the inability to urinate, I don't know why anesthesia itself would be a deterrent to performing the procedure.  The worst that can happen is she doesn't make it through surgery, when she wouldn't have lived more than a few days or a week anyway...and that way you're giving her a shot to have an extended life.  For me, the most important issue would be the surgical recovery.  Does the specialist think it will be fairly quick and easy, with just a few days of discomfort?  Or could this be weeks of discomfort for only a month or so of extended life?  We can't answer those questions for you, only this surgeon can."

AskVet,394ga4,art_nouveau16,3,Tue Jun 9 04:47:32 2015 UTC,"Absolutely go to the specialist for a consult. You could continue treating the dry eye for the rest of the pet's life, but I would at least go to the specialist first."
AskVet,394ga4,rvtjess,2,Tue Jun 9 05:18:36 2015 UTC,"There are multiple ophthalmologists in the NY area - your regular vet should have a list for you.  Of the top of my head - Blue Pearl, VERG, Animal Medical Center, Long Island Vet Specialists (don't know for sure if they have ophtho)."
AskVet,394ayb,Dandanaa,3,Tue Jun 9 03:59:56 2015 UTC,"None of us here can give you a second opinion without physically examining your pet. If you still have questions I recommend calling your vet back and getting clarification about your questions.  Age is never a reason not to sedate, health status is. If the cat is current on bloodwork and has no other underlying health issues, sedation is probably not as big of a risk as you think."
AskVet,394ayb,rvtjess,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:42:34 2015 UTC,"You should take the cat to a different vet for a second opinion if you're concerned about the current diagnosis/treatment, this isn't something that can be diagnosed without a full physical (including neurological) exam.  In general, although middle/inner ears need systemic antibiotics, the external ear infection would need topical treatment, but your vet might be thinking that it has to be cleaned for that to have a chance to work (and I guess the cat needs sedation for the cleaning).  If an eye can't blink you should be putting in drops or ointment regularly to make sure it stays lubricated.  If this was my 20 year old, I would risk the sedation to clean the ear and get a good look inside - in cases like this I'd always be concerned about possible cancer in that area."

AskVet,393jor,belatedlove,4,Tue Jun 9 00:48:53 2015 UTC,"Has you friend tried calling around to different vets, and explaining the urgency of the situation? I'm sure there would be at least one clinic around that could squeeze the cat in if they understand the nature of the emergency.

AskVet,393u69,votenanocratic,6,Tue Jun 9 01:46:22 2015 UTC,"If your cat eats a complete and balanced cat food, there's absolutely no need to supplement it with organs or anything else. That said, if you really want to feed your cat chicken hearts or livers as a special treat, make sure to cook them first to kill any harmful bacteria, and remove all membranes and fibrous tissue. All things in moderation; treats like this shouldn't make up more than 10% of your cat's daily calories."
AskVet,393u69,haggieneko,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:58:58 2015 UTC,"From the cat's standpoint, there is no need for raw meat added to their diet if they are fed a good commercial diet.

AskVet,393mqv,tayloreep,10,Tue Jun 9 01:05:57 2015 UTC,THIS. Most emergency clinics or vets will allow you to relinquish the animal. She'll get the medical help she needs then be adopted out.
AskVet,393mqv,mcnuggetskitty,3,Tue Jun 9 02:13:50 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I had this happen at the emergency center I work at last week. Mom and 2 little kids came in late at night, their little dog had been in labor for nearly 10 hours. She gave birth to one puppy at home that was dead, no progress on the other one (she hadn't had any x-rays or vet care during pregnancy but we snuck in a quick no charge ultrasound). Second pup was still alive, but barely.   They had no money, denied for Care Credit, and the owner promised to bring her back to relinquish if she couldn't find someone to help by morning. I gave them the numbers of every low cost clinic and charity I could think of. I think the Sam Simon Foundation was going to be able to help her. She didn't come back, so I hope so.  It was horribly irresponsible of them, but I still felt for them, especially the kids (and the dog of course). Mom lost her job and they were hoping to make a few bucks selling puppies, plus, yay, puppies! Instead, no live puppies and they may have lost their dog too. So damn sad and so preventable."

AskVet,3915if,goatsickle,4,Mon Jun 8 15:51:18 2015 UTC,"This isn't a vet issue; it's a behavioral issue. Actually, it's more of an owner issue. You succumb to your cat and you're letting your cat run your life.  Proper training will fix this issue.  Do not let your cat outside.  He will eventually stop whining, but it will take awhile.  You need to play with him probably 30 minutes a day until he is EXHAUSTED.  He needs to run around a lot. Play with him until he pants and won't get up any more.  Do this at night, before you feed him.   Let him ""catch"" his prey at the end of playtime, feed him, then he will go into a state where he cleans himself.  That's the natural cycle of a cat.  This should also help with him playing too aggressively with the female (whom also needs played with daily, by the way).  Before bedtime, you may also want to use pheromone calming spray around where he sleeps. Additionally, you can take him out for a walk on the leash each day (if he allows it) so he can still enjoy the smells of the outside world.  Never re-home a cat because you, as the owner, have not properly trained him. That's like abandoning your baby because he cries too much."
AskVet,3915if,snowbirdie,3,Tue Jun 9 00:13:32 2015 UTC,"step one, commit to not letting him out, start on a friday night before a long weekend so poor sleep wont be the end of the world step two, follow the advice /u/snowbirdie gave you. step three, seperate the cats overnight if you have to and lock HIM out of your room to make you less likely to give in to his whining   Do you both ever travel? When I have in the past made a big change to a pets routine I have done it by, continuing the old routine until a big change in routine is coming up (like a vacation or a move) once returning home or settling in the new place just start the new routine (in this case, cat stays INSIDE all night.) Because the old habit is 'weaker' it is a little easier to break.   This has worked for me with several things like house breaking, litterbox training, switching to portioned meals from free feeding, setting up an auto feeder. Even teaching dogs to walk on a loose leash is easier in an environment where they have never pulled on the leash before."

There are supportive things you can do which help to slow progression (such as the prescription diet).  But there is no cure other than a kidney transplant.

AskVet,390kmi,goatsickle,3,Mon Jun 8 12:29:53 2015 UTC,"Usually it's nausea keeping kidney cats from eating.  Antacids and anti-emetics can sometimes help with this.  You should bring him in for blood work to see if there's anything else specific that should be considered.  He may be very anemic, have very high phosphorus, etc, or something completely new may be going on.  His hydration status may be very poor and he could need fluid supplementation.  Your best bet would be going to your vet and following the recommendations, and if you don't trust your vet get a second opinion.  I'd do this before considering euthanasia...but if you do that and nothing helps, or if you can't afford any additional tests and/or treatments, you need to consider his quality of life."
AskVet,390kmi,goatsickle,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:47:16 2015 UTC,"We've done plenty of blood tests, but will likely do another with a different vet for a second opinion.  Should I bring them Vet A's records?  With respect to the euthanasia question, you mention considering his quality of life.  What I was asking is... What are those considerations?  I've had to euthanize a dog before, but it was a much more clear cut case.  With this cat, he still wants to cuddle, still moves around the house, but he is always needy, but never satisfied.  I was just wondering if you or anyone else had a bullet list of behaviors that strongly suggest consideration... I know every case is specific, but its a terrible decision to make when emotionally invested, and scientifically untrained, if that makes any sense."
AskVet,390kmi,skipsteejsprat,2,Mon Jun 8 17:45:41 2015 UTC,"Definitely bring the records.  These cases can be tough in terms of when it's time to let go.  If he's not eating and is wasting away, that's not a good quality if life.  If you take him for a second opinion and they agree there's nothing that can be added on to his medications, I wouldn't let him go on like this much longer.  If you wait until he's completely skin and bones and unable to even get up and move around, it probably went on too long.  It's a hard balance to strike...you don't want to let him go prematurely either, but keep in mind the fact that there's rarely a perfect time when you'll feel completely secure in your decision.  You just do the best you can based on your overall judgement of his quality of life.  Appetite, energy level, interest in favorite activities, etc...there's no one gauge, you have to take it all into account."

AskVet,38yjw5,Krstnzz,6,Sun Jun 7 22:57:05 2015 UTC,"They have vaccines for both FIV and FeLV.  With the FIV vaccine it can cause your cat to test positive because the test searches for antibodies against the virus not the virus itself, so I've always recommended microchipping any cat that has been vaccinated against it, since many shelters will euthanize cats they suspect are sick with the virus.  The vaccine is also not 100% effective just like any vaccine.  So there are ways of helping to protect your kitties.  Though the vaccines will take a couple months from the time of initial administration to when antibodies are present in great enough quantity to have your pet protected.    However both of these viruses are transmitted through bodily fluids, such as cat bites in FIV and in FeLV saliva and urination.  If you have a room where this kitty can live with her own dedicated food and water bowls and own dedicated litter box without being in contact with the other cats the chances of them contracting something from her becomes unlikely.  Make sure you wash your hands after handling her though.  Many pet owners have a hard time keeping up with that level of dedication however, it is not an easy task to let the cat stay that isolated.    I am a vet tech student working as a technician assistant and I always hear from owners who tell me after their cat has been diagnosed that their cat loves the other cats in the household and it is hard to keep them apart.  Just realize that if they do fight or groom or share food and water or the litterbox you could potentially be putting your other cats at risk."
AskVet,38yjw5,RedQueenHypothesis,5,Mon Jun 8 02:26:08 2015 UTC,"The FIV vaccine isn't generally looked at in high regard. There are 5 virus subtypes. The vaccine covers 2, and not phenomenally well for those. If you use the vaccine, your cat will show up as being FIV positive, so it's impossible to know if they're actually infected. Most hospitals don't even bother carrying it."
AskVet,38yjw5,jadedgoldfish,4,Mon Jun 8 10:39:28 2015 UTC,Is she FIV+ or FeLV+ (or both)? FIV is feline immunodeficiency virus and FeLV is feline leukemia virus.

FeLV is transmitted through casual contact. If you have a house where all the cats are getting along, FIV is quite low risk and I have brought FIV+ foster cats into my own home and not isolated them after proper introductions because I know the danger is very low and FIV is manageable, worst case scenario. I wouldn't bring FeLV into my home."

If you're that worried about rabies, you could talk to a doctor about getting vaccinated yourself for peace of mind."

AskVet,38yub0,bayesianqueer,6,Mon Jun 8 01:51:57 2015 UTC,"Human ER doctor1 here: Get the rabies vaccine series and HRIG (pre-formed antibodies to rabies). The standard of care is that any person sleeping around a bat as well as any person who can't communicate (young child, disabled, etc) who is found around a bat needs to have post-exposure prophylaxis (vaccine and HRIG). This is because rabies in humans is (almost) universally fatal, so we don't screw around with this.  The only exception is if the bat is captured and can be sacrificed to test for rabies.  I live in a rabies endemic part of the country, so this is my bread and butter. Depending on where you are and what your insurance is, it (or your local department of health) should cover the costs. However don't delay. I would advise you to go to the closest ER immediately for care.  1) I subscribe because I am that pet owner. I couldn't even sign a DNR for my dog when he was hospitalized for 2 nights."

AskVet,38yub0,bayesianqueer,3,Mon Jun 8 15:09:09 2015 UTC,"Sort of... that is, you have to administer the vaccine and the HRIG in different areas of the body. If there is a known bite that you are worried about the recommendation is to inject as much as possible directly around the bite (and heading proximally if on an extremity) so that the antibody is at its highest level around the nerves that will transmit rabies to the CNS.  Ideally the vaccine should be administered in either delt so if you have a bite on the right hand, you give it in the left delt. If both hands are bitten there is a bit of a debate whether it's best to give it in the glut.  Fun fact: where is most HRIG from? Vet students! This is largely because they are a) poor and b) generally rabies immune. There are a few places around a few vet schools where you can sell your plasma and they pay extra for rabies immune donors."
AskVet,38yub0,Urgullibl,2,Mon Jun 8 23:20:58 2015 UTC,"So, considering OP has no idea whether he was exposed and, if so, in what body part, what would you suggest to do in their case?  And don't ask where the hormones in oral contraceptives come from."
AskVet,38yub0,bayesianqueer,3,Tue Jun 9 00:57:08 2015 UTC,"It's just given as an IM injection distant from the site of the vaccine. Even if you know the site, sometimes you can't inject the full volume of HRIG around it anyway. It's a weight based dose and if you're a hefty person or if the bite is on a fingertip it's hard to inject 8-10ml in a finger... plus it lowers your patient satisfaction scores."
AskVet,38yub0,Urgullibl,3,Tue Jun 9 03:36:35 2015 UTC,It's not that expensive. You could ask your vet where they got theirs.

She also vomits when she eats too much too quickly, which usually only happens when there was too little food in the bowl for her liking, leading her to binge once I refill it.   Vet basically says she will develop an allergy to whatever I give her, and to rotate through the sensitive stomach/urinary tract health formulas. He also encourages as little dry food as possible, he said ""she'd be better off if she never saw another kibble again in her life"" but with multiple cats free feeding in my house, dry food ensures the ""runt"" of the bunch doesn't end up underfed from the bigger cats eating her share of wet food."

This is the last type of dog you want to get behind on fluids.  It is potentially overkill, but you're on borrowed time given your dog's medical history and I personally wouldn't take any chances."
AskVet,38v2v2,ironmouse,6,Sun Jun 7 02:19:59 2015 UTC,"I tried to wait a bit, but she became really lethargic. Took her to the ER, they gave her fluids and anti-nausea, and I was able to take her back home. She's resting now but is already acting more alert and aware."
AskVet,38v2v2,ironmouse,4,Sun Jun 7 06:11:23 2015 UTC,I am glad you went. And thanks for the update.
AskVet,38uwn3,tykholol,3,Sun Jun 7 01:06:37 2015 UTC,"No replies yet I know, but my vet actually just called back, she's very nice and told us that he's urinating through the catheter, and the xrays showed no signs of kidney stones so she doesn't know quite what the cause is yet. She said that they need to wait for the blood test to come back before she knows whether or not it could be kidney disease, and has opted not to put him on anti-inflammatories for the time-being. She also mentioned that the amount of blood in his urine was troubling, and is probably the most she has seen in cat urine, but I'm not sure how often she treats cats for this, as it is a smaller and newer office."

AskVet,38tp61,ironmouse,3,Sat Jun 6 19:36:11 2015 UTC,Flat out you need an internal medicine specialist.
AskVet,38tp61,kat_fud,4,Sat Jun 6 20:48:15 2015 UTC,"I am not a vet, but I found this page which lists the highest risks for tick-borne diseases in Portugal as:   Ehrlichiosis Anaplasmosis Babesiosis   Ask your vet if he has run tests for these diseases. It may be that he has but that the tests take some time to be processed.   Of course it possible that your dogs symptoms are not related to the tick bite, so you might search online to see if there are any blood disorders that are common to English Pointers.  Good luck."
AskVet,38tp61,Urgullibl,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:29:59 2015 UTC,"thank you all for your answers I appreciate it a lot. You don't know how important it is for me.  I was with the dog just now and it's not looking good, I think he quit his life.  Vet told me he was infected by some kind of ""parasite?! or virus?!"" I don't remeber which one. But anyway the virus was transmited by the tick. Hw told me if the treatment was done sooner he could have recovered. Now he is telling me that he is not producing erythrocytes. That he recovers a bit with the transfusions but then comes anemia again.  They quit on the dog saying that there is nothing more to do. That they usually only do one transfusion and that they did 2 on him and that he is not recovering. I can get the blood work that they did on him tomorrow probably. I know that on the second transfusion they didn't even made a compatibility check because he was very close to his death and there was no time.  My question is, I have someone who is available to do another transfusion from another dog I have but without compatibility check which I was told is very very very risky for the 3rd transfusion. Should I just leave the dog to die in the Vet (I don't know if he will make it this night) or take him home tomorrow and have another friend who is a Vet to do the ""blind"" transfusion?   My thoughts are that if the dog is going to die anyway might aswell try everything available, I will have no remorse whatsover. At least he will die near me, where he belongs and not in the Vet. Maybe a miracle can happen. My friend is not happy with doing a third transfusion with all the risks involved but for me and my dog if I really want it he will do it.   Tell me if i'm going mad I need your opinions. There is no more time for bloodwork or anything at least till he gets a transfusion that goes well so he can have 1 or 2 more days.   I either do it and he survives a little longer and have time for more bloodwork or I do it and he dies after it.   Or I don't do anything and he will in the vet. Today they tried to make me believe he is not gonna make it and I believe them of course. But I want to do anything available."
AskVet,38tp61,goldfish_king,3,Sun Jun 7 00:22:25 2015 UTC,That's why you would do a clotting test before doing the transfusion.

AskVet,38sz6i,chulaire,6,Sat Jun 6 16:43:26 2015 UTC,"I went to the vet and they gave her anti-biotics and a shot. They think its something with her brain, either an infection (wich hopefully the anti-biotics will fix) or if its a bleeding. if she doesn't feel any better on teusday we have to come back and then we can see how we are going to proceed. I would never give her asprin or any other medicine, i thought maybe there was something i could give her i could buy at an animal store somewhere that could make her feel a little better."
AskVet,38sz6i,chulaire,3,Sat Jun 6 18:16:39 2015 UTC,Very happy to hear you got her looked at.
AskVet,38v9tv,UnicornToots,2,Sun Jun 7 03:10:14 2015 UTC,"The dermatologist I did rotations with suggested that if empirical antibiotics (chosen without a culture) are unsuccessful twice, you should definitely get a skin culture to make sure it's not a resistant infection.  So you can always request that if you want to be proactive.  However, recurrent skin infections can also be a sign of allergies, so they might discuss that with you as well.  There's really no way to guarantee that it stops, unfortunately."
AskVet,38sx1d,DayPass,3,Sat Jun 6 15:19:40 2015 UTC,"Licking/lapping and constant swallowing can be a sign of nausea- did she vomit at all last night? Any other GI signs (inappetence, diarrhea?).   If none of those signs, and it doesn't repeat, there may be no way to know what was going on. If it starts again, I would try and get her seen, at least for nausea medications. If she starts vomiting, I would definitely get her in, on ER depending on the severity/frequency."
AskVet,38sx1d,DrDead88,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:28:08 2015 UTC,"Yes! She did vomit. I forgot, I was up until 3am with her. No other GI signs. Normal on our walk this morning. Thank you!"

AskVet,38sx1d,rvtjess,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:11:05 2015 UTC,"I was worried it was neurological. While she was doing it, she was responsive to commands, not sure if that matters, and as I said, she vomited. If she does it again, I'm bringing her to the vet to see if it is some kind of seizure. Can neurological disorders show up later in a dogs life?"
AskVet,38t3p0,maple-sugar,5,Sat Jun 6 16:12:46 2015 UTC,"This may be an anal gland issue- they may just be too full, or there may be an impaction or infection. If your vet is still open, I would see if you could get him in today. It doesn't sound like an emergency if he's not having any vomiting, diarrhea, is eating, normal energy levels, etc, but he's probably very uncomfortable."
AskVet,38t3p0,DrDead88,2,Sat Jun 6 16:25:00 2015 UTC,"Okay thank you. We have him booked for his annual shots and checkup tomorrow because our vet is booked up today.

AskVet,38ubnl,ineedtopeepee,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:03:32 2015 UTC,No mass can be diagnosed based on description or picture alone. The only way to know what it is would be to take your dog to the vet and have it examined and possibly have a sample of the mass obtained for analysis.

AskVet,38t2gt,DrDead88,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:22:45 2015 UTC,"Yes. It's agreement that it is stress. Environmentally done what I can short of getting rid of a cat, or buying a house.

Parasites: completely negative PCR test within the past six months."
AskVet,38t2gt,DrDead88,2,Sat Jun 6 16:36:47 2015 UTC,"It sounds like your vet has a plan in mind then, and I would follow that- we cannot make treatment recommendations to patients we haven't seen.   Environmental modification can involve increasing the number of perching areas, creating a safe place just for him, etc, if the issue is the housemate."
AskVet,38t2gt,DrDead88,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:40:49 2015 UTC,"The o my issue I have is that my vet follows first line of treatment, and beyond that she doesn't have much experience. I was the one who pushed for budesonide, she'd never prescribed it before to a cat. We did ever-increasing doses of pred for months with no result because it's the standard course. I'm a little worried I'm going to be presented with only one option, and it isn't the best available one."
AskVet,38s8av,Catquerythrowaway,3,Sat Jun 6 10:41:53 2015 UTC,"Please see the FAQ about skin conditions- they're near impossible to diagnose with a picture, and can be challenging in person, requiring diagnostics like cytology, since many conditions present similarly.   Your best option is to talk with the owners about it, and see whether they have taken him in about it. If not, and you're worried, contacting the RSPCA may be your best option, but I'll admit I'm not familiar with procedures in the UK."

I wouldn't wait any longer especially that age. If you're feeding her dry food diet make sure she has plenty of FRESH water.
AskVet,38t9y8,ZippityZoppity,7,Sat Jun 6 17:00:19 2015 UTC,"I assume you are asking due to the cost of the food. No, not without lessening the effectiveness or potentially completely negating the benefits of the prescription diet."

AskVet,38qvxn,viridianlion,6,Sat Jun 6 01:24:32 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's time for a culture (including on Sabouraud) and antibiogram at this point; a chest X-ray would also be indicated IMP. Something fungal is pretty high on the list of differentials, but it could be other things. I'd also include bloodwork/chemistry and testing for FIV and FeLV. Your general location might help narrow it down further.  If that turns out to be inconclusive, my next step would be a biopsy, maybe also BAL and culture depending on what the X-ray looks like."
AskVet,38qvxn,Urgullibl,3,Sat Jun 6 02:03:56 2015 UTC,"What has been ordered is:   Fungal panel 6 w/cryptococcus antigen IDEXX Upper Respiratory Disease (URD) PCR w/Culture if indicated IDEXX   Chest x-ray was done, normal.   Are these two labs sufficient? Are they just serologies or would the reflex culture also involve a sab-dex agar culture as well?   Biopsy was discussed, but they will not do biopsy without CT, they like to do a CT first, then after mapping, do the rhinoscopy with flush, biopsy whats needed."
AskVet,38qvxn,Urgullibl,4,Sat Jun 6 02:08:15 2015 UTC,"If there's something fungal going on, it's going to show up on those. Considering fungal infections are commonly secondary to immunosuppression, FeLV and FIV testing would be a good idea if that turns out to be the problem.  I'd ask whether the culture will also include an antibiogram while they're at it."
AskVet,38qvxn,Urgullibl,3,Sat Jun 6 02:10:01 2015 UTC,felv/fiv negative.   I feel like I might have caused the nasal immunosuppression giving him the puffs of the inhaled corticosteroid aerosol as well as the couple days of 4mg methylpred. Is that sufficient to do the job?

Is borrowing money from friends or family an option? Can you create a fundraiser of sorts, create crafts, have any talents you could use to bring in some extra cash to put towards the surgery?  I'm not sure what your credit situation looks like, but have you considered applying for care credit (just make sure to pay the full balance off BEFORE the end of the promo period or you'll get hit with high interest on the original full amount. Paying just the minimum payment will not pay it off on time so you will have to do some math and I recommend rounding up)?  EDITED TO ADD: Also, look into programs like ""angel funds"".

Create a go-fund-me or other type of online fundraiser and offer to do something silly for every donation like dump a bucket of ice water over your head for $25, deliver a custom singing telegram for $50, silly stuff like that. You could even consider contacting local pet stores or businesses asking if they would be interested in helping you fundraise where 10% of proceeds between certain hours are donated to you, etc.   The more creative you are, the more people will want to donate.

AskVet,38suq2,ardnax31a,6,Sat Jun 6 14:59:25 2015 UTC,"No dermatologists aren't cheap.  Medicine isn't cheap and when you start talking to specialists, just like with human medicine, the costs rise.  Allergies are frustrating and time consuming and can be a combination of environmental, seasonal, food, or parasitic.  So the options are as follows:  Meet with the dermatologist and discuss testing. More expensive up front but you get answers faster. So cheaper in the long run.  Play ""What do we rule out this month!"" and talk to your regular vet about diet trials and medications.  A strict diet trial may determine if there is a food component or if there is a primarily an environmental component.  Please note the use of the word MAY.  Diet trials are difficult in that they have a low compliance rate because, lets face it, pet owners are suckers for the sad doggie eyes and our pets know how to play us like violins. Diet trials take a minimum of 8 weeks to be able to say ""Yep its food, so on to phase 2"" and how many pet owners are willing to watch their dog itch for another 8 weeks?  If after 8 weeks there is no difference in the level of itch, well you have pushed food farther down the list, but haven't done anything for environmental.  So then its time to talk medications and environment control.  Its here that the costs start to catch up to the dermatologists.  The medication for atopy are not cheap and just throwing steroids at dogs to mask the symptoms is frowned upon due to long term side effects.   In short, allergies are frustrating for both owners and veterinarians.  Because there are so many components to the itchy dog and every dog is different, there is no one answer for them all.  Its not cheap, its not fast, but if you can put in the time and money to finding out what is the primary offenders, it can be managed.  Personally, I would at least consult with the dermatologist.  They can give you all your options and written estimates so you can make an informed and educated decision.  Do not base your decisions off internet research.  99.9999% of it is crap and has no basis in science or logic."

AskVet,38rc3s,ted_bolub,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:13:16 2015 UTC,"Depends on the surgeon, what they're the most experienced with, what you can afford, and how much post-op care you're willing to deal with. In my experiences, TPLOs are more stable but should only be done by a board-certified specialist, therefore they are more expensive, and they also have a much longer recovery period... vs a tie-back/lateral suture procedure has a shorter recovery period, may not be as stable, less hardware, ""less experienced"" surgeons can perform this, and are generally less expensive.  Of course, mileage may vary.  I would talk it over with your vet, ask what s/he is comfortable with, and if s/he is not comfortable with performing either procedure, ask for a referral (most are happy to give one)."
AskVet,38rc3s,rvtjess,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:28:21 2015 UTC,"My vet (Northshore Vetrinary Hospital in Bellingham Wa) refered me to Dr. Mark Davis who is a board certified orthopedic surgeon that comes highly recommended by Northshore and Fountain Vet (where we got a second opinion) The surgeons at Northshore & Fountain can do the suture procedure, but they are not board certified and cannot do the TPLO. Hunter is extremely active and he is young, I want the absolute best for him and cost is not an issue. I was doing some research on the different procedures and I read about a bunch of severe complications from the TPLO such as infections, damage to the meniscus, loosening of the metal plates caused by backing out of the screws, tibial tuberosity fracure, spinal alignment problems, increased cancer rates, peroneal nerve damage and popliteal artery damage. I know that there is risk involved in any surgery, I just want my dog to be better and not deal with a lot of lifetime problems. When I took Hunter to his first appointment on Monday, the vet we saw didn't try to sway me either way, she just explained the differences between the two surgeries that can be done. My boyfriend and I (Hunter is just as much his dog as mine) were thinking we should do the TPLO surgery but after reading some of the potenial complications I don't know what I should do, hence the post to reddit. Thank you all very much for your responses, I have become especially stressed out about this whole ordeal and getting some unbiased advice is helping. :)"
AskVet,38rc3s,rvtjess,2,Sat Jun 6 05:29:40 2015 UTC,"I worked a short while with a board certified orthopedic surgeon who primarily did TPLOs, and honestly, I think we've seen about the same amount of ""complications"" from both procedures. My current and previous clinics had doctors who would do the tie back and truth be told, we really didn't see any complications from either method. Yes, the TPLO leaves more hardware in the leg so you have an increased chance of infection or migration, but it really is a more stable procedure for a young, larger, active dog.  For larger dogs, I definitely recommend a TPLO. For smaller dogs, either procedure is fine.  So... if I were in the same position with one of my girls, I would absolutely do the TPLO (assuming health status was great in all other respects)."
AskVet,38rc3s,rvtjess,3,Sat Jun 6 05:43:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your advise. We will most likely proceed with the TPLO (My bf is sleeping and I of course want to talk it over with him, but I am sold). Thank you again for clearing things up for me I greatly appreciate it. Hunter also thanks you I am sure :)"
AskVet,38rbl6,rebelreligion,3,Sat Jun 6 03:44:24 2015 UTC,"My first recommendation is always to try a Thundershirt. For some dogs, that's all they need, others do well with it in conjunction with other methods, and for some dogs it makes zero difference. The problem with thundershirts is that many owners make the mistake of only using it during times of stress, so the pet starts to associate it with the stressful event. Ideally, you would put the shirt on the pet hours in advance, but I understand that sometimes that isn't ideal. It can be worn 24/7 if your pet tolerates it, however.  There are a few OTC nutraceuticals you can try that are fairly readily available for stress and anxiety: Anxitane, Zylkene and Rescue Remedy are my top recommendations. I do not recommend Adaptil/DAP. I have rarely ever seen it make a difference. The nutraceuticals will need some time to kick in and work, though, though some owners report seeing a difference in a matter of days. I would give each of them at LEAST a month, if not two months, before writing it off as not working.  Then there are prescription medications and sedatives. I, personally, am not the biggest fan of using acepromazine for stress related incidents like thunderstorms or fireworks unless the pet is in danger of harming themselves or others, as it renders them physically unable to react but does nothing for them mentally. There are far better options, like alprazolam, fluoxetine, and clomipramine. Some may be used in conjunction, short term, or long term. Just like the nutraceuticals, some may need a few weeks before you'll start to see a difference so don't count them out if you don't see changes in the first few days, but others are designed to take effect within minutes/hours.  Please discuss all options with your vet before making a game plan, as your vet knows your pets' health the best.  EDITED TO ADD:  I completely forgot the best method at all -- desensitization! There are a huge variety of ""fireworks"" CDs online, amazon, the thought process is that you start playing the CDs at a low enough volume that it doesn't elicit a reaction from your dog, and over days or weeks you raise the volume until it doesn't seem to bother them anymore.  Another tip I was given was to put the dog in an area of the house where they can't hear the fireworks very well (basement is great) and play LOUD music, preferably music with a lot of bass, like rap or techno or dubstep. This sounds silly, but the bass will mask the sounds of the fireworks... though your neighbors may think you're having an awesome party."

AskVet,38rdl8,ironmouse,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:04:14 2015 UTC,"Call your vet and discuss long term management.  Its not uncommon to see elevations in ALT with fluconazole and considering your dog has the disseminated form of valley fever, stopping or dropping the dose (which is less than the max so well within the recommended range) is out of the question.  Be prepared for your vet to be not in a panic about one elevation this early into treatment.  If the ALT remains high, goes higher or her other liver values also rise, then there is more cause for concern.  Closely monitor attitude and appetite.  If at any point she goes off food, vomits or starts having dark or loose stool, call your vet right away.    If at any point you want to get a specialist's opinion on your dogs treatment, contact the Valley Fever Center for Excellence in Tucson or Dr Lisa Shubtz at Veterinary Specialty Center of Tucson.  I believe Dr Shubitz consults with multiple centers in Phoenix as well, so you can also call the big specialty centers and see if she is going to be in town."

AskVet,38qxdd,CastleSeven,2,Sat Jun 6 01:36:34 2015 UTC,I would get some sterile eye lube for the eye that cannot blink.  I would also get a consult from a specialist vet in neurology regarding the nerve issues.  This subreddit does not allow comments on how a vet treated your animal. I would ask the neurologist as well as a surgeon and another veterinarian of similar training to whoever did the surgery whether the complications you are seeing are common side effects of such a surgery or whether it would constitute malpractice. It is worth bringing the medical records for somebody else to look at so that they can examine how your animal was treated. Most surgeons would explain possible complications of Levi's surgery.
AskVet,38qxdd,littlehamsterz,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:30:15 2015 UTC,"Absolutely ask for a referral to a specialist, preferably a neurologist and/or ophthalmologist (likely both). In the mean time, you can use sterile eye lube (as previously recommended) as often as you need to keep the eye lubricated, but I would call your regular vet ASAP to get this ball rolling, as if the eye gets too dry it can be damaged and there is a very real risk of losing the eye."

They use sedation a lot, even with sick patients and they are always fine as long as they are well monitored. There is always a risk to using any medication, but it sounds like it would be safer for you, everyone else, and less traumatic for your dog if he was sedated IMHO.

AskVet,38pb8s,rvtjess,2,Sat Jun 6 05:11:20 2015 UTC,"As an Aussie owner myself, I've heard countless ""breed enthusiasts/breeders"" talking about the MDR1 gene and ivermectin sensitivity. However, Washington State University (one of the places that tests for MDR1) does list ivermectin as being used in monthly hearworm preventions, such as Heartgard, as being a low enough dose and is considered safe, even with MDR1 positive dogs.  So, really, the answer depends on your lifestyle, your location, and what your concerns are. I would call your vet to ask if there is any concern about resistance issues with any preventatives in your area and go from there.  If you have a concern for ticks, consider a separate oral heartworm preventative and topical flea/tick preventative. ie: Interceptor or Heartgard for HW, Frontline, Advantix, Vectra3D for fleas/ticks  If you prefer oral meds and don't have a particular need for tick prevention, consider a combo product such as Trifexis or Sentinel.  If you prefer oral meds but have a need for tick prevention, consider an oral heartworm prevention and a separate oral flea/tick prevention, such as Bravecto or Nexguard.  There really are so many different options, though if your pets do have flea allergy dermatitis you really should keep them on a flea prevention year-round. Just one bite will set these guys off and it's not comfortable for them at all (as it seems you're already kind of experiencing). If you're concerned about a reaction with using topics, I would consider using oral medications.  My personal favorites: Combo: Trifexis (no tick prevention, essentially Interceptor + Comfortis) Just Heartworm: Interceptor Topical flea/tick: Vectra 3D Oral flea/tick: Bravecto    I am not the biggest fan of Revolution for dogs, as it does not cover intestinal parasites and only covers one type of tick."

I have swabs, I just never bothered to collect and submit... I'm terrible.  I never considered resistance. I've asked my coworkers what they use, but the answers have all been so varied. Our DVMs haven't mentioned resistance, but I suppose it doesn't really cross our minds being that the emergency field is a little bit more removed from that thought.   I personally haven't had any experience with Trifexis, but even a few of the LVTs I've talked with show some hesitation. While I understand that there has been a LOT of overreaction regarding it's use, would you give any merit to the cautiousness people are giving? It seems to be a mixed bag 'round these parts...   I appreciate your detailed input! As often as the kids come with me to the clinic and all the germs and bugs I could carry home, I try to keep them covered for everything I can. The Heartgard/Advantix combo appears to be working, it's just that topical that seems to make her so itchy! I've also been eyeballing Sentinel Spectrum for its action against tapeworms, since we have a few rabbits in the yard and their feces are like a doggie delicacy - if you've heard any reviews, I'd be delighted to know."
AskVet,38pb8s,account86698,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:06:31 2015 UTC,"On the topic of Trifexis: Trifexis is sold separately as Interceptor and Comfortis and those products have been on the market for years without any backlash or issues. Comfortis is contraindicated in dogs with a history of seizures; it does not cause seizures, but it does seem to lower the seizure threshold, so if you have a seizure-prone dog or an undiagnosed seizure prone dog then you may see seizures with Trifexis.  And yes, it isn't well tolerated in the sense that it is not very palatable, and owner compliance with giving it with a full meal is very poor so you do hear a lot of complaints about pets vomiting on the medication (FULL meal, not just a treat or some peanut butter, etc).  Admittedly, giving it to my girl is a challenge every month. I have to break it into kibble-sized pieces and cover it with fish oil or peanut butter in order to get her to take it, and even then she still can pick it out some times... but I have had zero issues with vomiting with it.  Honestly, the #1 complaint about Trifexis in my personal clinic experiences is that the pets vomit on it. We have seen ZERO deaths, ZERO ill pets from this medication in all the years I've been a tech since the product has been on the market.  On MDR1: I haven't tested my aussies, either. I don't think it's quite as big a deal as the breeders/breed fanciers make it out to be unless you're breeding. If you have bloodlines on yours and the parents were tested and are negative/negative, you don't need to test and have nothing to worry about. It may behoove you to familiarize yourself with the ""watch"" list of meds, though, I know some common ones like acepromazine and imodium are contraindicated in collies that are MDR1 positive or have an unknown status.  Think of the thousands of owners who have no clue what MDR1 even is. I'm not saying it isn't important, but I don't think it's QUITE as important as some fanciers claim it is, though I think it is necessary to test every dog in a breeding program!  Sentinel Spectrum: I'm not a fan of Sentinel for it's flea preventative properties, personally. It has an IGR but that's it. But I know many people who swear by it. Everyone I've seemed to work with and talk to always talk smack about Sentinel, but I don't really have any personal experience with it, and since my clinic doesn't carry Sentinel I don't have a lot of experience or knowledge about Sentinel Spectrum."

AskVet,38ncyl,JordanKit,14,Fri Jun 5 09:39:43 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely take her to a vet asap.   The big problem with dog bites is that their teeth will enter at one point, and then when they shake/throw their prey, it'll shear and shred the internal organs...so what may look like a tiny puncture wound can be quite a lot of internal damage.  Also consider the possibility of a hernia if the muscle wall has been compromised."
AskVet,38ncyl,chulaire,3,Fri Jun 5 09:47:14 2015 UTC,Thanks for the help! I followed your advice- vet checked and she is good to go! My greyhound had all her teeth removed due to CUPS so I'm assuming that played a very big factor in her injuries not bring far worse.
AskVet,38ncyl,chulaire,2,Fri Jun 5 21:32:40 2015 UTC,Oh great to hear! Glad that she's ok.  No wonder she slipped out if your greyhound has no teeth haha.
AskVet,38ncyl,rvtjess,7,Sat Jun 6 03:55:19 2015 UTC,Emergency vet.
AskVet,38ncyl,CritFailingLife,12,Fri Jun 5 11:05:30 2015 UTC,"adopted last week from local humane society they have been properly introduced and know one another well- my dog is usually careful with her so I have been more lenient with both of them during play time.     I'm sorry, but no, they don't ""know one another well"". They couldn't possibly yet. They're still just getting used to one another and both still learning how to interact. You've had the kitten such a short amount of time that honestly, you won't know what your dog is ""usually"" with the kitten, you'll only know how they are so far. Yes, they will seem much progressed from when they first met, but you are still in the period of time where you should treat them as potentially dangerous to one another and not leave them unattended (lock them in separate parts of your home or crate your pup while you're not there). When your kitty is back from the vet and healed up, make sure you teach your dog that only gentle play is allowed with kitties. I personally would not permit wrestling at all given this incident and the potential for it to accidentally escalate too far."
AskVet,38ncyl,Urgullibl,9,Fri Jun 5 15:50:31 2015 UTC,"I would agree. Greyhounds are bred to hunt and kill animals roughly the size of a cat, so this is not something OP should trust their dog with."
AskVet,38ncyl,rkkid9,3,Fri Jun 5 15:59:02 2015 UTC,"This exactly. A greyhound is big enough to very easily harm a 3lb kitten, even in play. It only takes a second for things to escalate too far."
AskVet,38ncyl,belatedlove,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:20:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of the above. They have been properly introduced. I didn't say they were friends or completely perfect around one another. I supervise them when the kitten and the dog are given free range of my home. The kitten was playing in the same room as the dog not with my dog. I do everything in my power to keep my pets healthy and happy. The kitten is fine. The greyhound doesn't have any teeth due to CUPS, which she had before we adopted her, which is why her injuries are minimal. Thanks for the concern."
AskVet,38ncyl,littlehamsterz,5,Fri Jun 5 21:29:11 2015 UTC,"Could be swelling, could be bleeding, could be a hernia, could be any other sort of internal damage. I'd get her to a vet ASAP, personally. Better to be safe than sorry."
AskVet,38nh7z,E-art,4,Fri Jun 5 10:29:18 2015 UTC,Yes this is something you should worry about.  Time for a recheck.
AskVet,38nh7z,ironmouse,3,Fri Jun 5 10:43:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your help everyone. Took her back in and did a urinalysis (results normal) another physical check over (no obvious pain response, but she was stressed....) and ran bloods again. This time it showed something...I can't remember exactly what but the vet suspects some type of infection and gave different ab's and more meloxicam. She seems to have perked up already.  I trust my vet 100% and she isn't too worried, so I'm hopeful! :)"
AskVet,38nh7z,rvtjess,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:25:56 2015 UTC,Thank you for the update!
AskVet,38nh7z,rvtjess,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:34:02 2015 UTC,"When cats don't eat for an extended period of time, they are susceptible to something called fatty liver, which is a life threatening condition. This can happen in as little as 24 hours of not eating anything.  Another thought is perhaps the clavamox is causing a little tummy upset.  I'm not saying this is your primary problem, but it could be a secondary problem as a result of the first. I agree, a recheck is in order.  Also, has she been tested for feline leukemia and FIV?"
AskVet,38nh7z,Urgullibl,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:03:34 2015 UTC,Time to take her back to the vet for more diagnostics. Get her in before the weekend.
AskVet,38nh7z,always_onward,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:31:43 2015 UTC,"Bring her back and please be prepared to pay for further diagnostics. The vet gave his best guess to try to avoid putting you through the financial wringer, but now it may be time for a more advanced (read: expensive) work-up since the initial treatment hasn't worked. This is exactly what a recheck appointment is for. Good luck!"
AskVet,38m375,mynameisaseason,16,Fri Jun 5 02:36:53 2015 UTC,"Your dog is in serious need of a dental cleaning, dental rads and probably some tooth extractions. The breath is likely caused by the dental disease."
AskVet,38m375,Tobimaru,2,Fri Jun 5 02:40:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what we thought going into the vet, but he just ignored it when our dog wouldn't let him open his mouth. We are calling another vet soon and will show them the pictures. Thanks!"
AskVet,38m375,chulaire,9,Fri Jun 5 02:58:01 2015 UTC,"That is some serious calculus build up on your dog's tooth. I'm going to assume his molars and other teeth are equally as bad.   The stuff forms from dead bacteria crystallising on your dog's teeth, hence the putrid breath.   A thorough dental examination with cleaning and extractions will do wonders for your dog. Don't be afraid of just scheduling a blood test and full dental (including anaesthetising your dog) simply in order to examine his teeth if he's aggressive - the photo is enough to warrant the procedure."
AskVet,38m375,rvtjess,-1,Fri Jun 5 09:43:34 2015 UTC,"Bad breath can also be indicative of other health issues, like kidney disease. Best to follow up with your vet and run some labwork (you'll want to do this prior to anesthesia for a dental cleaning, anyway)."
AskVet,38mk2r,MissLockjaw,8,Fri Jun 5 04:34:40 2015 UTC,18 lbs sounds quite fat.   Most fat cats have terrible skin.  Ask your vet what her ideal weight is and put her on a diet.
AskVet,38mk2r,skipsteejsprat,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:44:18 2015 UTC,"Interesting about the weight/skin issue correlation. She started on a diet last week; hopefully that'll be the fix!   That actually brings up another question for you, though. From then reading I've done, I'm under the impression that she should lose approx 0.25lbs/week at most. Is that a healthy goal for her? If not, what is the consensus on kitty weight loss?"
AskVet,38mk2r,skipsteejsprat,2,Sat Jun 6 01:27:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what the recommended lbs/week is.  I just lower the food by 10-15% and re-weigh in a few weeks.  Others may have different ideas.  Also make sure she's eating good quality food.  My family cat had dandruff while on grocery store brand food, but once I got her and put her on Purina, it was like night and day.  Diet food will sometimes cause dry skin since it's lower in fat and oils.  But it will help her feel more full.  So it you can tolerate a cat bothering you more for food, I would feed a regular non-diet food, and just feed less of it.  That way she still gets the oils to help her skin.  Either way, her calorie intake needs to go down."
AskVet,38mqi5,beauxbeaux,5,Fri Jun 5 05:30:05 2015 UTC,"Symptoms are vague, which is why we would do some diagnostics, like bloodwork, xrays and/or ultrasound.  She sounds very sick, I would take her in ASAP."
AskVet,38mqi5,skipsteejsprat,2,Fri Jun 5 05:38:57 2015 UTC,"thank you for your reply. Since your response, a lot happened: I put the updates in another comment. would you mind reading it? I'd like your input.  update"
AskVet,38mqi5,skipsteejsprat,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:03:53 2015 UTC,"Could be a hairball with food mixed in, but I would still take her in for a check-up since you said she had pale gums.  A hairball alone would not cause that."
AskVet,38mqi5,belatedlove,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:10:47 2015 UTC,okay. thanks! Will take her tomorrow
AskVet,38ldta,meagl,4,Thu Jun 4 23:37:11 2015 UTC,Schedule a vet visit. Any newly adopted pet should be seen by an independent (!) vet within a few days anyway.
AskVet,38ldta,Urgullibl,2,Thu Jun 4 23:45:21 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestion. I've had him for almost 4 months and with a case of giardia we've been to vet a lot! They've looked in his ears during his routine exam and didn't see any issues.
AskVet,38ldta,Urgullibl,4,Thu Jun 4 23:48:51 2015 UTC,Chances are they will now.
AskVet,38ldta,rvtjess,4,Thu Jun 4 23:50:55 2015 UTC,"If you're seeing that much debris and gunk in his ears, chances are likely he has an infection. They should do an ear cytology to determine the cause.  Unfortunately, labs are notorious for having ear issues :("
AskVet,38lho7,pixelatedyeti,3,Fri Jun 5 00:01:45 2015 UTC,Its hard to exactly tell what is wrong in the picture. He should been seen by a vet if at all possible. It is most likely a larval infection but without seeing it in person it could also be another cat bite that has become infected.  There aren't really any at home remedies. It needs to be cut out under sedation. If you try to take it out at home it can rupture and making things really bad.
AskVet,38lho7,Vasopressin,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:34:49 2015 UTC,Damn. So....roughly how much money is this gonna cost?
AskVet,38lho7,Urgullibl,3,Fri Jun 5 00:39:36 2015 UTC,"Depends on what it is, and we can't tell that from the picture. I'd say probably low to mid three figures, but it could be more depending on how deep this goes.  It is important that your parents are upfront about their financial constraints with the vet in order for them to figure out how to best manage resources."
AskVet,38lho7,Vasopressin,2,Fri Jun 5 00:50:04 2015 UTC,Its really hard to say since prices vary by region but a rough estimate would probably be $200-$400.
AskVet,38lho7,Urgullibl,2,Fri Jun 5 01:04:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that will need to be seen by a vet today, tomorrow latest. The longer you wait, the more this is going to cost to fix. Care Credit is definitely an option if money is the problem."
AskVet,38lho7,shitidneversay,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:48:36 2015 UTC,Are you able to transfer money to your parents?
AskVet,38k0no,sgt_deathstalker,11,Thu Jun 4 18:56:34 2015 UTC,Yep.
AskVet,38k0no,Tobimaru,8,Thu Jun 4 19:18:19 2015 UTC,Uh huh.
AskVet,38k0no,Urgullibl,7,Thu Jun 4 19:44:56 2015 UTC,Yuppers.

AskVet,38k0no,dashclone,8,Thu Jun 4 21:37:24 2015 UTC,Oh ya.
AskVet,38k0no,Nemo7123,7,Fri Jun 5 00:30:04 2015 UTC,"I would not wrap your own bandage around it. They are easy to get too tight, and very often do more damage than the original issue if not done by a professional."
AskVet,38k0no,am_i_really_ftm,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:28:42 2015 UTC,"Yes. If you can't get to the vet in the next day or two, you may be able to buy an Elizabethan collar (aka E-collar, aka Cone of Shame) from a pet store. HOWEVER, this is not a solution - it provides a physical barrier to prevent further damage, but your dog will still be bothered by the source of the irritation, so that still needs to be treated."
