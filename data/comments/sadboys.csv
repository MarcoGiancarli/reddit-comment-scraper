sadboys,3dsz7v,ClemCR7,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:15:11 2015 UTC,After effects probably.
sadboys,3dusr1,slimicide,3,Sun Jul 19 18:05:28 2015 UTC,"my drums get kinda complex i use a couple methods. Most basic way is with a drum rack. really easy. you can do a lot of cool things with the drum rack to because its midi so abletom midi effects work. The other way is with audio clips on different tracks in a drum group, imho this is the best for control but it takes more time."
sadboys,3dusr1,thenumber1punk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:33:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. I've mostly been using audio clips in different tracks, it's not very visually stimulating for creative process and hard to develop drum patterns, not really sure what you mean by drum group. I'm gonna play around with drum rack and watch some videos, still kinda confused how it's all recorded on one track. Also how would you give your 808s a melody. I've been trying to convert samples into melodies  but once I get melody can't seem to manipulate sound much"
sadboys,3dusr1,thenumber1punk,2,Sun Jul 19 19:18:34 2015 UTC,"ok, lets say you have 4 audio tracks. Kick, snare, hihat, bongo. if you highlight those tracks, right click,  and ""group tracks"" you can apply effects to all of the drum parts. Usually a glue compresser(full parallel  is a good preset) and then you can add effects and change each individual part"
sadboys,3dusr1,olom2k4,2,Sun Jul 19 21:08:23 2015 UTC,"using simpler, or sampler for wav files are really good for drums. my chain is usually eq, then compression last, and sometimes a saturator in between on the kick to make it phatter. ableton is an awesome daw, and even better for live performances. i would also test other daws to see which one your most comfortable with. you can hit me up if you got any questions olom2times@gmail.com ive been using ableton since like 08-09."
sadboys,3dusr1,Impaled_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:13:38 2015 UTC,"Sample different sources, like songs and natural sounds (hit stuff and record the sound), then layer those sounds in a drum rack (experiment with the timing of the midi notes) to create unique drum hits. Learn to use equalizer to make the different samples fit together, and finish them off with compression etc"
sadboys,3dusr1,dprt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:02:31 2015 UTC,"Like most people here have mentioned, I also use the drum rack. It's definitely the easiest way to make complex patterns in my opinion and you can fit many different sounds in the slots in the drum rack, allowing you to be very diverse in the way you organize the sounds in the MIDI clip."

sadboys,3cpsza,Captin66,9,Thu Jul 9 20:19:24 2015 UTC,"First of all that's not an analog nor a synthesizer board. A synthboard doesn't even exist, unless you meant a modular synthesizer.    Second of all this is a Monome 16x16 which is a 256 padded MIDI controlled sampler that works kind of like the Ableton Push which is only 64 pad sampler. Nonetheless these kinds of samplers can be used for beat sampling with full range pitch compatibility. In addition, he programmed an arpeggio into one of the tracks on Ableton.    Third of all, Yung Gud uses some of the most professional/industry standard hardware(and software) I've seen and as a producer myself I cannot fathom his selections and compositions with such hardware such as the Octatrack (Fairly expensive at $1.4K)."
sadboys,3cpsza,ReligiousGroup,6,Fri Jul 10 05:43:16 2015 UTC,"Fourth of all, neither of those are samplers their just midi controllers with no signal processing power. It's the program you use that samples."

sadboys,3cpsza,duckcall,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:04:29 2015 UTC,not actually a midi controller. its just a board that people made applications for. some r midi applications but its not strictly a midi controller.

I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

Lately I like ""Monster"" for the coherence and cinematic aspect that lies into it.  ""Oceans 2001"" cause it hits so heavily.  ""Lightsaber // Saviour"" because this melody is bigger than life.

sadboys,3bt24p,Captin66,7,Thu Jul 2 01:28:56 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree. And he's my favorite member. I like his low key persona. But I don't think he's like building up a hype I just feel like he's lackin. And he enjoys what he gets from his low key personality. With everyone asking for him to drop songs. Etc.
sadboys,3bt24p,iceaura,8,Thu Jul 2 03:27:56 2015 UTC,anytime bladee wears a vest it reminds me of mclovins vest

sadboys,3bt24p,hympaz,6,Thu Jul 2 04:24:18 2015 UTC,"I actually agree with the op on SOME of bladee's lyrics. I cringe in ""I'm Lost"" when Bladee sings ""When I'm too drunk I can't talk with my feelings / I don't talk to girls they only talk about their feelings"". It's super melodramatic for me, even though melodramatic is the vibe bladee's going for with that song.  Personally I don't care that much for sandman. I find it irritating and overall a far weaker album closer than Solarflare was."

sadboys,3bt24p,Yibb,2,Thu Jul 2 04:14:37 2015 UTC,Leanworld is probably my favorite track off um
sadboys,3bt24p,Captin66,9,Thu Jul 2 04:57:25 2015 UTC,"yung sherman is mediocre and inconsistent (until he wows me with his ep), his best songs even from technical standpoint have been made with whitearmor doing most of the work"

sadboys,3bt24p,responsetrail,0,Wed Jul 1 23:16:42 2015 UTC,"bladee's lyrics are definitely over melodramatic.  op is right he's not some lyrical genius like people make him out to be (or even close to that).  BUT the atmosphere of his music lets him get away w/ those lyrics and makes them sound deeper than they are and truly does create an ""emotional"" experience.  excited af for rainworld"
sadboys,3bt24p,visionsovu,5,Thu Jul 2 06:23:15 2015 UTC,"I like Bladee's style he pulls off baggy, large clothing. And has a nice wardrobe full of multiple brands, I've noticed he has a lot of supreme tees. Yung Lean's style seems influenced by trap artists. Such as Robins Jeans and True Religion. He still dresses nice for the most part. ECCO's style really stands out among all of them. He is very unique and creative. Thaiboy dresses like shit, although I've seen some pieces he's had on that look real nice. I like him though.  True Religion is complete shit except for their hats. I love the hats."
sadboys,3bt24p,iceaura,4,Thu Jul 2 02:11:15 2015 UTC,Imo sad boys best phase so far was in late 2014-early 2015. Mainly because of the release of UM and things were so interesting back then. It was all new and I like the videos they did for UM tracks the most (volt is my favourite) the UM tour video is my favourite thing ever too
sadboys,3bt24p,apedap,4,Thu Jul 2 17:17:19 2015 UTC,"Thaiboys language barrier really hurts his music, like the lyrics to 2seats"

sadboys,3bt24p,mdietccahs,3,Sun Jul 12 00:52:25 2015 UTC,gluee was rly overcompressed or something. i get that its the style but if there was cleaner tracks it woulda been nicer to listen to
sadboys,3bt24p,jhowa15,4,Thu Jul 2 13:54:18 2015 UTC,"plastic boy is ok, not as good as people in this sub hype it up to be. i will admit, bladee was snappin but i didn't realize that until i actually read the lyrics. for the longest time, i couldn't understand what he was saying and never bothered to look it up."
sadboys,3bt24p,mdietccahs,3,Thu Jul 2 05:04:07 2015 UTC,What's amazing about plastic boy imo is the fucking key change at bladee's verse. Only sbe song with a key change. One of the only rap songs I can think of with a key change for that matter.
sadboys,3bt24p,inb4coolname,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:33:02 2015 UTC,"but i didn't like the key change. i liked how the song started out, with that bassline and lean's flow. it was almost gritty, even. idk unpopular opinion yfm ¯_(ツ)_/¯"

I think Don't Go is one of the best and also most unappreciated tracks on the album and I think people should give Sherm more credit for that instrumental cause it's amazing.. I don like listening to thaiboy most of the time at all, his verse in Diamonds makes me cringe. The video makes me cringe bc of him"
sadboys,3bt24p,protespojken,4,Thu Jul 2 08:57:24 2015 UTC,"The majority of thaiboy's stuff I dont vibe with, and the stuff I do like I like because of whitearmors insane production, ie the song tiger. However, I think that thaiboy himself was great on most of the ""tiger"" mixtape (Whitearmor absolutely killed that mixtape too). ""Return of the goon"" or whatever it's called was total garbage tho, I can't listen to it.  Also I agree with you on the diamonds vid. the whole thing doesn't appeal to me honestly I don't see what ppl love about it."

sadboys,3bt24p,Yibb,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:31:37 2015 UTC,"Just some random tracks on some of the early mixtapes, nothing specific or major, poor mixing etc. Most of it was good no doubt, but I think all of the members + producers have matured nicely and adapted different influences into their styles."
sadboys,3bt24p,jhowa15,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:44:56 2015 UTC,Whitearmor's stuff on unknown death is pretty messy. Oceans is not a very good beat (not whitearmor I know) and deathstar is all over the place (although the VFILES version sounded much cleaner.) Beats like Magic is Strong too sound just jumbled.
sadboys,3bt24p,trapgoon7,6,Thu Jul 2 01:10:51 2015 UTC,"lol whitearmor is the best produced by far, lean sounds better on guds production, but whitearmor is the superior producer from the bunch"

Shit was sad because it made me realize how much of a kid lean really is and if he died young that would be really lame. The day after I had the dream that video with him in the hospital dropping UM CDs off the balcony got put out up. It made me scared and sad but now I just feel stupid."

Best memory?  lean: umm my best memory. uuuh it was probably when i saw yung sherman in a wheelchair.   guy: yung sherman who is one of your members in your collective sadboys?   lean: yeah when we rolled him around at the airport in Barcelona. In a wheelchair, that was really fun.   guy: What had happened to him?  lean: uuhm he had injured his foot and then he didnt care about it. and then he had bought a new pair of raf simons shoes and he walked around and was like ""Oh fuck it hurts!"".   guy: it sounds like you have made your own version of tyler the creator's famous foot-boat(?) or similar.. he posted pictures of his huge foot. I have also had an injured foot so I know how it feels like. Was that what you tried to achieve?   lean: No, it kinda just happened. And he had to sit in a wheelchair. He had been very grumpy during the whole trip but when he got a wheelchair he became very happy. And I figured that I really liked Yung Sherman in a wheelchair... It was a new side of Sherman.    Guy: blabla something about blues whatever  Guy: But you are healthy anyways? All of you?  Lean: Yeah, I am.. We came home.... Survived... Like, us.   Guy: A travelling journey/diary... Lean will post that here. And we will look at that so that we can see how it was!   Video plays   Guy: Tell us, what was it that we saw here?   Lean: UUhm... I think we got to see Krakow, Madrid.. and the snow was Switzerland.  Guy: A trailer for the EU-election. everyone laughs   Lean: Yeah,, I can't vote in the EU-election.

Gloves are very symbolic, symbol of purity, being pure or something. Kings used to wear them. Bladee also rapped in his song Freeze ""sad to see disease I got on my gloves"" white gloves tho particularly are also used by waiters, private chauffeurs, butlers, because they are very maticulous. They do things with extreme care and very strong attention to detail. Sadboys and gtb both have a shit ton of details and references in their work so it fits them and their style"

sadboys,39y2lv,trapgoon7,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:49:54 2015 UTC,"Meh, that's just your opinion. I think that the latest sadboys stuff has been mediocre at best and only Bladee (and Ecco if he would actually release smth) is steady putting out quality music. I really dislike all the GLO GANG collabs and similair songs with generic trap lyrics. Meanwhile Bones has been putting out a lot of great work by himself and with projects like surrenderdorothy and $uicideboy$ dropped their best album up till now yesterday, and they've released 8 other albums just in 2015."

sadboys,39snv6,Jarrz,2,Sun Jun 14 20:45:09 2015 UTC,"Fucking great closer.  Downloaded UD just to see what the fuss was about and at first glance thought it was stupid, think it completely won me over in about 20 minutes and became one of my most listened to albums of the year."
sadboys,39snv6,digitalpizza,15,Mon Jun 15 01:04:13 2015 UTC,"I honestly feel like Lean peaked at the Unknown Death era, I mean I liked Unknown Memory but ultimately it was a disappointment compared to UD2002. I'm still excited everytime he releases new material, but so far his new tracks haven't really exceeded the UD tracks. His sound has evolved into more professional, but I feel that he has also at the same time lost some of his charm and quirkyness. But yes, Unknown Death is definitely a great, cohesive mixtape."
sadboys,39snv6,Dynamithix,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:09:21 2015 UTC,I disagree that he has already peaked. besides his major projects I'd imagine he has unreleased work similar to older stuff. but I enjoy UM and aside from that he has just done singles and features. I'm excited for his next full project
sadboys,39snv6,slimicide,1 point,Mon Jun 15 07:05:33 2015 UTC,"I discovered the song Lucifer Love like two days ago, and I loved that so much more than anything on Unknown Memory, especially with the video, it sounded like a even cooler Version of Princess Daisy  I think the polished sound is fine but UD is the bomb"
sadboys,39snv6,Jarrz,6,Sun Jun 14 20:44:52 2015 UTC,"Unknown Memory is better in every way. I can play the whole thing thru. He grew up a lot and I feel the lyrics,beats and whole sound is a lot better. Its way more futuristic and refined sounding"
sadboys,39snv6,_Billups_,2,Sun Jun 14 15:00:36 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, although I still think UD is awesome in its own way."
sadboys,39snv6,xlbvn,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:46:19 2015 UTC,"I definitely think he has a lot of great stuff to come, UD was great (Kinda because of the confident naivety, sort of how punk bands best work is usually in their teens) but the more coherent and grown up sound of UM was excellent too.  Really can't wait for his next release."

I did have a good time. Had an excellent time.  The thing that pretty much confirmed me to go was Seeing Yung Lean and Travis Scott (hoping they would even do ghosttown together) instead neither showed up.    Yeah it sucks that he was lined up for FPSF but couldn't end up going, but that just happens   Really? Does it just happen, because I'm not talking about that. I'm talkin about Counterpoint which was last month. apparently he just doesn't do festivals even though he signs his name on them.  It's a fucking major buzzkill when rappers do this ""lol im just gonna show up 3 hours late"" bullshit. since festivals have a schedule they just get cancelled. fuck that noise show up for the people who want to see you or don't sign up at all.  Thank god iLoveMakonnen showed up, and he showed up HARD. dude has skyrocketed to one of my favorites right now because he showed up and went insane on the set when the other rappers couldn't be bothered to put out the blunt and walk on stage.  edit: yes i am bitter and salty about it before you ask"

I found the song link in the description, and had a quick listen of the song again before I went to play fooball with my friends. The song got stuck in my head while I was playing. I came home and spent whole honeymoon night with Yung Lean I remember... That was like out of the world experience when I found him, I cant describe the feeling. His songs were like magic to me lol. Tho at first, I didnt like few of his songs, later I found them really chill and cool."

I think it was around the time I started hearing about Witch House on a forum I go on.  Listened to a lot of Crim3s, etc., and Vapourwave was kind of linked to that when talking about things.  Must have searched for it on Youtube and found a few Yung Lean vids.  Kyoto was the first one I listened to, which I thought was OK.  Then I heard Diamonds with Thaiboy Digital, and that was it, I was hooked."
