RandomActsofCards,3dqxnd,vapingcarrie,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:51:39 2015 UTC,"That's so cool! What was the transition like (as in, is California very different from Michigan)? I've thought about moving west in the future, Arizona in particular (because, you know, cactuses. but also I have some family out there) but I'm afraid I'd miss Michigan too much! I'd love a card from San Francisco. I'll PM you =]"
RandomActsofCards,3dqxnd,chibi_haiku,2,Sat Jul 18 23:55:18 2015 UTC,"tl;dr - really satisfying to move, do it!  but it's taking a while for me to get settled in.  My transition has been slow going, mainly on account of being busy and into my new job out here.  I've also spent weekends just trying to pare down all the stuff that got moved.  I was born in Michigan.  Before I got here, I'd been living in Northville, a small suburb town in the Detroit area.  I was there for 10 years, so I really had the habits and expectations of someone living in place where you drove everywhere, and maybe had a little downtown with a good breakfast place and the occasional local weekend fair.  I'd never lived in a big city before.  Like friends of mine, occasionally I'd hit a bar or Tiger game downtown.  There's really just so much here, so I'm looking forward to get to know what of it I like.  So far I've just been content making it to the end of the work week.  When I get home I go through more boxes of stuff and donate what I don't want anymore.  This place is bonkers expensive to live in.  I'm paying more than three times my Michigan rent for a place half the size.  I had a bedroom and a den before, now I'm in a studio.  This was my choice though -- I wanted to live in a certain area (Hayes Valley) and I didn't want a roommate.  I miss Meijer!  Funny to even think that.  There isn't a store like it here.  The main grocery chain is Safeway, and I guess Target is Meijer-ish in that they carry everything.    This town, and really throughout the bay, has a really noticeable population of people living on the streets.  In tents, or sleeping bags, or otherwise huddled in a building entrance.  I've gotten used to seeing them, but it's a drastic contrast from before.  Mostly people stay out of each other's way.  There's beautiful scenery along the coast.  Yosemite and Lake Tahoe are about the distance from Detroit to Chicago, I hear.  Still, it's been really easy to slip into a mode where I just hole up in my apartment and watch Netflix.  I haven't made any new friends yet in town, but I trust there are lots of friendly people out there.  I can be pretty introverted, but occasionally I crave interaction enough that I'll try to get over it.  I am close to one person.  We both came from Michigan, but she's been in California for 8-ish years by now.  I also have two coworkers that were also former Michigan coworkers.  It's comforting to still have that connection.  I moved out here to start a new life chapter.  I'd been wanting to for a long, long while.  Went through some rough times myself not long ago, and I just wanted a new direction.  Now that I'm here, I feel re-energized about just finally making it to a different place.  Then I take a nap and don't check out that festival at Fisherman's Wharf.  Get to Arizona, I'd say.  When you're ready, but don't wait years like me.  Then you can reminisce about Coney Island and telling people where you live by pointing at your open palm like the rest of us.  Cheers!"
RandomActsofCards,3dqxnd,michellica,2,Sun Jul 19 23:15:42 2015 UTC,So I do not make cards. However my wife hand makes cards as a hobby. I was stumbling around reddit and found this sub. PM me your address and she will send you a card. (And no redditors I am not giving my wife a chore she loves crafting and I spoke with her before posting this)
RandomActsofCards,3dqxnd,CheapIsHowIFeel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:21:12 2015 UTC,That's so cool. I usually send out a bunch of cards at Christmas and I've always thought about making them but it looks like a LOT of work. It's so cool that she does that. Thank you in advance!
