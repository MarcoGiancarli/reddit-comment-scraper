sweetjustice,3bu6ht,gruffogre,6,Thu Jul 2 04:33:59 2015 UTC,"Call me a rube, but what gave it away? (Besides the fact that he looks like a leprechaun, not a marine.)"
sweetjustice,3bu6ht,dsquard,27,Thu Jul 2 11:09:39 2015 UTC,"http://s18.photobucket.com/user/TheWizardofBC/media/DressBlues.jpg.html  Former active duty marine here, this guy is more fucked up than a football bat.   No cover (hat) and he's outside (in the most situations military members are required to wear their cover outdoors in uniform, it's a weirdly big deal), no white belt, medals just pinned wherever like some 3rd world dictator, his trousers have an NCO stripe, but his rank is that of a Lance Corporal, so no blood stripe is authorized. No shooting badges either.   That's just the few things I noticed in the 15 seconds I gave this video before I'd had enough."
sweetjustice,3bu6ht,ChanceTheDog,6,Thu Jul 2 12:49:51 2015 UTC,He does have a sharpshooter badge... down by his stomach.   I think it's hilarious he chose to throw on three national defense medals/ribbon and one random Afghanistan campaign medal.  This guy is a serious national defender.

There's no way if go out and fake something like this without at least looking some stuff up to make sure I look like I know what I'm doing.

sweetjustice,3bu6ht,fxsoap,6,Thu Jul 2 21:27:42 2015 UTC,His ribbons and medals looked a little fucked. When you spend months getting told how to wear a uniform you can spot a messed up uniform from a mile away.
sweetjustice,3bu6ht,Mazurke,3,Thu Jul 2 12:21:29 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it was likely something about his uniform - of course marines have very strict standards about what is displayed where/how on the uniform, and this guy has it all fuckered up.

sweetjustice,3bu6ht,YOLOSwagPartyboy69,-7,Thu Jul 2 11:09:40 2015 UTC,"Wrong place to do it.   Some of these MJW's are chomping at the bit to become YouTube stars. Yeah Yeah died for the uniform. I wouldn't die for some clothes. I understand the anger,  but guys like the one filming are doing it for an ego stroke and to be big on YouTube.   Don Shipley,  on the other hand,  is the real deal."
sweetjustice,3bu6ht,Slabbo,5,Thu Jul 2 15:33:55 2015 UTC,"Don Shipley, on the other hand, is the real deal.    So are you only allowed to call out fakers if you're already an established youtube star like Don?  Otherwise you're ""doing it for an ego stroke""?"
sweetjustice,3bu6ht,lasergumball,4,Thu Jul 2 17:28:01 2015 UTC,"No.   Don goes after people who use their Navy SEAL claims to profit by ways of getting jobs on the premise that they're SEALs.  These YouTube warriors pump themselves up real big and tough and then hassle the shit out of whoever. It's an ego stroke. If you read between the lines.   Does Don go berserk like these guys do? No. He wants to get a job done. None of this ""I put my hand in the goo that was my unit commander's face!"" stuff.   I'm not saying the marine was wrong in getting upset,  but the fact that he was making the mother of the graduate all upset and didn't care pissed me off. This marine's carrying on loudly and with the aim of attracting a crowd at a graduation was tactless and selfish.   It was all about the marine and nothing else mattered.   But then again,  Marines are trained to be robotic killing machines so I guess I'd be wrong to expect him to tone it down and not create a scene at an event that's supposed to be a happy day for graduates and their families.   Besides - the way the faker was dressed,  it'd be easy for even a civilian to see that his uniform was a mess and that he wasn't legit."
sweetjustice,3bu6ht,Slabbo,3,Thu Jul 2 18:06:36 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge Don Shipley fan, and no, he doesn't just go after people trying to make a profit, he goes after anyone claiming to be a SEAL, even guys that just have SEAL pictures up on their facebook or used it to pick up women.  Hell, he even called up one guy because he was wearing a SEAL hat.    Don also works on referrals, so he has the name and contact information of the people he's calling out.  Are you trying to tell me if he saw a fake SEAL with a disastrous uniform in public, with all the effort he puts into calling out phonies, he wouldn't confront them?  Bullshit.    And Don says plenty of the ""too many of my friends have died for that uniform"", specifically reminding the phonies how may SEAL funerals he's been to.  He yells and insults these guys all the fucking time.  He gets off on humiliating them, regardless of whether they're profiting from it.  Don't pretend like he's some ultra-professional saint.     But then again, Marines are trained to be robotic killing machines so I guess I'd be wrong to expect him to tone it down and not create a scene   But shit like this makes me think you just have yet another anti-military grudge to begin with, so it's no surprise you hate any sort of call-out.    And no, most people can't identify a flawed uniform.  Half the comments in this thread are explaining to others why the uniform was fucked up to begin with."
sweetjustice,3bu6ht,lasergumball,3,Thu Jul 2 18:32:09 2015 UTC,"You're mostly right except about me being anti-military. Who I'm against,  since you brought up the subject,  are the assholes who send them off to die for no reason.   I love the ""troops"". Every last one of em,  even the ones who piss me off with YouTube videos."
sweetjustice,3bu6ht,Slabbo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:38:11 2015 UTC,"are the assholes who send them off to die for no reason.    Couldn't agree more.    Regarding phonies, many people build a tremendous amount of pride for the uniform throughout their enlistment for a variety of reasons - and to see some sshole wearing a fucked up one because he felt like getting some free attention makes it really hard to not become enraged, and I can imagine it's almost impossible to not want to confront them and then inadvertently ignore how you come across to people on their computer screen while doing so.    I think some of them do come off as total douches, but I can assure you it's likely very rarely mere ego stroking.  This shit is actually enraging and incredibly hard to just walk away from without saying anything, and as far as I know, there is no current training for ""how to confront someone and upset no one else in the process"", especially when it's something that's a big deal to you but not to anyone outside of your occupation."

sweetjustice,3bohse,ajs427,-1,Wed Jul 1 05:01:35 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with the flag either, but to me it represents a tumultuous time in my nations history, when half the country attempted to secede from the union. The reasoning behind it was states rights, but the catalyst for the argument for states rights was slavery. Now (most) people who are proud of the flag don't see that stuff, they attach a misplaced sense of pride that's tied to where they are from, regionally. It's people who don't have any accomplishments or achievements to be proud of, but want to be proud of something anyway.   It's no different from someone who is proud to be from Detroit, except by wearing the D on their hat, they aren't conjuring images of racism and slavery in other peoples heads.   Flag needs to go, it's nothing to be proud of, but I don't think it's a direct representation of oppression like say, a swastika is."

sweetjustice,35weuo,q_-_p,0,Mon May 18 01:50:41 2015 UTC,"Sure the guy wished the black player ill will because of the game, but using the word 'nigga/nigger' goes hand in hand with wanting to use it in anger and wanting to use it because of someone's race.  I believe whatever you're willing to say in an insult is what you're okay with being prejudice about. I'm straight but hate when people say ""that's gay"" or other terms like that because it's calling homosexuality a negative thing. If I'm gonna use 'nigga' in a non-prejudice way, it better be in a way I'm willing to use with any human being - black, white, man, woman, etc. Examples include ""my nigga"" or ""this nigga right here..."" But if you're saying ""fucking nigga"" to one player and ""fucking chink"" to another, it means you have no problem degrading any one person's race to a negative trait, which means you're a racist.  The majority of insults I dish out are related to a lack of intelligence in some manner. I can admit that I am highly, highly prejudice towards stupid people. I don't use racist, homophobic, ""he/she got fuckin' raped""-lingo, or any other type of insult that has to do with a group that I believe is equal to the type of human I am."

When I was 10-12 (idk maybe 20 years ago or so) I was riding back from a family gathering with my black sheep aunt and her pathetic boyfriend. We are going up this big hill and there is a cyclist working his hardest to get up the hill. The dumbshit boyfriend decides it would be fun to scream ""GET A FUCKING CAR FAGGOT"" at the cyclist like he's some big shot badass.  Fast forward 2 minutes and we are stopped at a traffic light. Dumbshit is cracking up at his little stunt while I'm sitting in the back watching the cyclist pull up to our car. The cyclist gets right up to the window and says ""Hey"" and then decks dumbshit right in the mouth. Cyclist says something else and then speeds off.   Thought that shit was funny as fuck.   Another time around the same age, whilst walking home from a friends house. A lifted truck full of some drunk 18-21 year olds thought it would be cool to throw a full beer can at my back while going 35+mph. The force of it knocked me to the ground and covered me in beer. No punishment (as far as I know ever befell them).   So I think this kid got exactly what he deserved despite whether or not his actions were bad enough to deserve this. Dumb fucks who fuck with people walking or riding their bikes deserve the worst they can get."

The ""Hall of Shame"" on the site shows a total of 3 black females, seems to me you could find a lot more people 'disrespecting' the US flag if that was your actual goal.   I can think of countless times i've seen images of southern white Americans burning/desecrating the flag for all sorts of reasons, yet for some reason I don't see any on this site.

Some things weren't justice enough for them so rather than rely on votes, they just removed it.   Some things had the potential to turn racist, and rather than remove the racist comments and ban the users (or even just let everyone else downvote them to oblivion), they just removed the whole submission.   Some things were reposts from like 3 years ago that a handful of people had already seen, so rather than let the upvotes or downvotes speak, they removed it  So we ended up getting about 5 submissions a week that actually stayed. It was boring, so people made their own subreddit that's so far much better."

It was a video about some mom raging at a school for someone filming her bad car parking job. I made a comment listing a few things from the video, like the school name on the building and the bar name on the mom's shirt. All were direct observations from the video. No personal knowledge; I just watched and paid attention. One of the mods called me out, and banned me on the spot. No chance to ask ""Did you even watch the video?"". P.S. Somewhat meta-justice, the same mod felt it necessary to quit the sub only a few days later. Every comment he made was down voted to hell by the masses.

sweetjustice,345csy,Geeky_McNerd,4,Tue Apr 28 22:54:40 2015 UTC,"It's nothing graphic. The video makes it even more difficult to imagine why someone would want to hurt an adorable little thing like that, though."

sweetjustice,345csy,EvilMuffin93,5,Thu Apr 30 04:28:56 2015 UTC,This is not justice IMO.  A bigger fine or a jail sentence or a beatdown or retaliatory face burning would be justice depending on severity.

I have experience with many people that have different types mental illness, disability, and addictions. She is just a childish person that feels cornered. You'll notice a lot of kids behave like this when they are logically cornered. She ain't ill, just immature."

sweetjustice,342aav,venterol,2,Wed Apr 29 11:20:11 2015 UTC,"There's a longer version out there than this.  The cop mentions that riding a bicycle on the sidewalk isn't an arrestable offence, but flips it around and tells her that battery is.  Since this lady just will not listen to reason, he then asks the guy if he would like to press charges but he declines."
