The most fun game I have of ARAM involved me playing Veigar and having an incredibly competitive 'burst-off' with the enemy Annie. It started when I facechecked her and got 100-0ed. Annie: ""Hi"" The next time however I dropped a W into the bush to check it and killed Annie in one shot who was trying to do it again and was on 1/3 health. Me: ""Hi""  And then a long and intense race to be the first to hit 1000AP started up which I won.  But then Annie's team won the game when I saw the enemy Teemo and Annie both within one shot health. I stunned Annie and flashed towards Teemo... who was just out of range of my ult and I kept chasing him for a second too long and Annie killed me.  But the thing is that it was still fun even though it was a loss, more fun than any of the wins I've had even. It's true that winning and getting strong is fun, but it shouldn't be taken too harshly if you lose."

bestofbronze,3dejjb,lifelongfreshman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:48:05 2015 UTC,"not wasted stats, just a wasted active and passive.  but if you want attack damage and attack speed its not a total waste."

bestofbronze,3dejjb,lifelongfreshman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:32:43 2015 UTC,"Its is, im more bothered by the double boots than the double botrk.  Its 600 more than wits end, you get more lifesteal which is doubled every second attack, you get more damage, and close to the same amount of attack speed.  If you goal is to max lifesteal and attack speed i woul probably double up on the botrk instead of getting wits end.  BT might be better, but you are giving up 40% attack speed."
bestofbronze,3dejjb,2legittoquit,4,Thu Jul 16 03:04:42 2015 UTC,"I honestly can't respond to this, I don't even know how to begin explaining why doubling up on any item is such a bad idea, let alone one so heavily weighted toward its unique active/passive as BotRK."

bestofbronze,3dejjb,2legittoquit,3,Thu Jul 16 03:38:19 2015 UTC,"I passed over the boots because you only talked about the BotRK in your initial post.

Voli with two completed items, but still level 1 boots. No sweeper trinkets on either team. Only one person upgraded a trinket. Maybe something about the bans?

bestofbronze,3d85xl,RobinLSL,3,Tue Jul 14 07:35:33 2015 UTC,"Bans are fine. About Katarina bot, while I think that non-marksman lanes are definitely underrated in low ELO, Katarina is probably not a good off-meta pick at all here... And then again she got a decent score, so what can I say? Sivir and Nami's builds are the biggest offenders here. Lack of boots2 on Volibear is OK, he was on his way to Merc Treads anyway.

bestofbronze,3coi15,Shamus03,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:57:38 2015 UTC,"You shouldnt lose motivation! You have to remember they added a whole new rank (Master) between diamond and challenger. Witht hat logic everyone could have eben demoted one rank.  Plus that was your end of season where you were used to meta, at the start of a season things are so crazy if you played a bit to get used to the meta and improved 0 aspects of your gameplay you would surely rise at least one rank just from that!  by my guesses, that means that with a few hours a day you coudl easily crawl up to S3,2, or S1!?  How unfun would it be also if it placed you perfect or too high, and you just lost and lost and fell. I personally believe it tries to always place you a bit low so you can feel that CLIMB!  I knew a guy once who places S2 and just slowly fell his way down to B5. it was the most soul crushing thing to watch as he played 2-3 hours a day for months."
bestofbronze,3coi15,TooMuchNesquik,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:32:19 2015 UTC,That actually makes perfect sense.

bestofbronze,3c5sgl,stedeo,8,Sun Jul 5 04:43:17 2015 UTC,He is nowhere near as strong now as he was in Season 4.
bestofbronze,3c5sgl,TheCowfishy,2,Sun Jul 5 05:17:59 2015 UTC,Is it because his leap distance was nerfed?
bestofbronze,3c5sgl,HOWDITGETBURNEDHOWDI,5,Sun Jul 5 12:18:54 2015 UTC,"Rengar's strength was a ""perfect storm"" if you will. He launched at a time where assassin comps were incredibly strong, making him fit perfectly into the meta. Rengar was infamous for his insane clear times (because you could abuse his mechanics to kill camps very fast). As a result of his fast clear times (in the old jungle, mind you), he was constantly invading and doing drive-by ganks. His damage was obscene and his leaps were broken as shit. This was also before his ult gave you notice that he was in the area."
bestofbronze,3c5sgl,TheCowfishy,2,Sun Jul 5 17:36:23 2015 UTC,Everything you're talking about was like a year after rengar was launched. He went through a several periods of assasin rengar is broken -> tank rengar is broken -> AP rengar is broken -> split push rengar is broken before people started playing him in the jungle.

bestofbronze,3bclu3,RDG_SwordStalker,3,Sun Jun 28 20:21:15 2015 UTC,"Uniques never stacked, they just weren't as common. Season 1 and up through season 2 maybe is when it was viable. It was stronger then also, so Akali would be getting up close to 100% Lifesteal and Spellvamp and she scaled with both so it was the strongest build.  So this person could be looking at old information like old guides or maybe played a long time ago and don't know how things changed after long breaks. Though the most likely is they simply don't realize it doesn't do anything for them."

bestofbronze,3a81ms,TheShadowKick,8,Thu Jun 18 03:13:36 2015 UTC,Excerpt from the matchmaking code:  method matchPlayer() {     range(elo) = player.range +- 50;     findEnemyTeam(5).in(range(elo));     findAllyTeam(3).in(range(elo));     findToxicFeeder(1).in(hell(elo)); }

bestofbronze,3a4dps,Quachyyy,2,Wed Jun 17 09:16:36 2015 UTC,It could be top lane Nidalee.
bestofbronze,3a4dps,Anthan,4,Wed Jun 17 11:34:47 2015 UTC,It was support nid.  Is upgrading trinket and being very aggressive keeping wards out not enough?  I am bronze after all.
bestofbronze,3a4dps,Philosoaxolotl,10,Wed Jun 17 13:04:24 2015 UTC,"No, it's not. You need Sightstone to have enough wards to really keep up proper warding. If trinket is enough either you're not warding enough or you're blowing waaaaaay too much gold on green wards when Sightstone would provide them.  Also, Nid isn't really a great support. She provides no peel and virtually no utility. Nid support is a very stereotypically Bronze thing."
bestofbronze,3a4dps,Philosoaxolotl,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:17:32 2015 UTC,"Oh, I didnt even know that it was a thing.  Ive just been trying to force it lately and its been kinda working lol."
bestofbronze,3a4dps,TheShadowKick,3,Wed Jun 17 13:24:31 2015 UTC,"Nid support? It'll probably work in Bronze when you can carry most effectively by just killing everyone, but as you rise in rank and the ADC becomes more important, you'll need to protect them in the late game in a way that Nid can't."
bestofbronze,3a4dps,henrebotha,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:41:19 2015 UTC,That is definitely somewhere she falls off from my experience.  Late game can be very difficult if they are dodging spears decently.
bestofbronze,3a4dps,TheShadowKick,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:38:51 2015 UTC,"The thing to remember about supports is that your primary job in the late game is to provide utility. That can be healing, CCing the enemy team, etc. Dealing damage is the job of your carries, and while there's nothing wrong with a support that does damage, there is something wrong with a support that lacks utility."
bestofbronze,3a4dps,doctorocelot,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:40:04 2015 UTC,"your primary job in the late game is to provide utility.   I disagree with this (I am Bronze 3, though, haha). I think the support's job is to contribute in any way - damage, utility, whatever - as long as they can do it without money.  I played Nida support for a while and it was fucking hilarious just dinking the enemy out of lane over and over again while my ADC happily farms in place."
bestofbronze,3a4dps,doctorocelot,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:09:27 2015 UTC,"Contributing damage isn't a bad thing for a support to do, but it's not their primary job. It is much easier to deal damage if you've grown fat on farm and have loads of gold to buy those expensive damage items.  Not only does a support not get very much gold, but having high utility helps them do their laning phase job of helping the ADC farm.  A high damage support can kind of do that job by harassing. Like you said, dinking the enemy out of lane over and over again will let your ADC essentially freefarm. But that only works against an opponent who doesn't know how to deal with it. If I'm supporting against a Nid support I'm going to play safe until I hit some power spike (usually level 2 or 3, when I get some utility going, maybe level 6 on some supports), and then I'm going to jump in, CC you, CC your ADC, and you aren't going to be able to stop me."
bestofbronze,3a4dps,RDG_SwordStalker,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:18:05 2015 UTC,It works against weaker players because they can't dodge skillshots so they get poked out of lane and your adc can farm really safely. At higher levels though it won't work. One missed spear and the opposing laner will just hard engage your adc and you wont have the cc to save them.
bestofbronze,3a4dps,Harakou,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:38:16 2015 UTC,"Yep, I have noticed that in the past.  I guess I was just playing extra shitty players those couple of games; cause they were catching spears like it was a freaking hobby.  Ill cut her out of my support inventory.  Thanks for the guidance."
bestofbronze,3a4dps,Harakou,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:43:11 2015 UTC,"She is a great steamroll champ at lower levels. Great for levelling up a smurf if you can't get midlane because her roam is very good as well and she has the mobility to escape jungle invades. You just make sure to land a few spears to make the opposing laner have to b which means your adc is safe.  Then you roam mid via their jungle to place a ward where you can see a camp. Gank mid, try and get a kill. Disappear into thier jungle,  no one wards thier own jungle at this level. Wait for their jungler to start a camp, at this level he will be still because he doesn't know how to juggle monster AAs so you land a max range spear from fog if war,  then get an easy jungle kill. Finish of the camp he started minus one little minion sonit doesn't respawn,  ward so you can do it next time, then head back bot and poke them out of lane again. Rinse and repeat. They'll probably surrender at 20 because the jungler has started freaking out and blaming his team for not saving him from you (at this level no one has the map awareness to go help quick enough, once he dies they will waste a bunch of time chasing a nidalee through a bush ridden jungle), their jungler also won't bother buying sightstone/warding his own jungle to stop you.   TLDR: in low bronze nidalee can be a great support if you play her right."
bestofbronze,3a4dps,Philosoaxolotl,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:55:27 2015 UTC,"On the flip side, I played against a Nid support that damn near carried her team after lane phase. Spears for days"
bestofbronze,3a4dps,not_again123,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:24:22 2015 UTC,"In addition to what /u/Philosoaxolotl said, you lose the advantage of being able to clear vision with red trinket by upgrading your green. You can sweep all of dragon/baron pit with upgraded sweeper and it only costs 250."
bestofbronze,3a4dps,doctorocelot,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:49:08 2015 UTC,"I think I have suffered from the downfalls of bronze.  They don't ward much, so not so many wards to destroy. I'm sure as I climb I will see more utility in sweeping for wards."
bestofbronze,3a4dps,Philosoaxolotl,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:08:19 2015 UTC,"If you're not finding a lot of wards with sweeper, you might first try checking other areas. See where you find wards and where you don't. If people really don't ward at all (I can't say; haven't played in that bracket for a while) try picking up sightstone + vision trinket. Having free pink wards can be really valuable, even if you don't use them strictly for vision denial. They can last much longer than the standard 3 minutes if placed in a good spot, plus you can use them against stealth champions like Akali and Shaco."

Is it more for the early game?"

bestofbronze,382n37,bradygilg,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:58:25 2015 UTC,That's the case for a ton of other junglers yet shaco isn't a top tier pick because of his awful late game and how risky invading is (you can't always predict their route). Also many teams will invade a shacos nest.

bestofbronze,37ijt4,Enstraynomic,2,Thu May 28 03:52:34 2015 UTC,"He's the AD Carry for Team ROCCAT. He plays aggressively to deal as much damage as he can in teamfights, but unfortunately gets very careless with positioning and dies often. One play of note was in one of the CW vs. ROCCAT games. Roccat was losing most of the game, but Jankos (ROCCAT's jungler) made a ballsy last stand with most of their base gone to keep them in the game. Shortly afterwards, Woolite (on Kog, I think) gets caught out trying to recall, sort of like in that video clip, and CW quickly end the game after that."

bestofbronze,37ea2e,StratOCE,2,Wed May 27 18:42:38 2015 UTC,"I lul'd, but taking smite tele actually isn't a bad strategy, although he shouldn't have to use it like that at level 2. He'd be best off doing a near-full clear, porting back, buying, teleporting back to bot (assuming he started bot jungle) and rejungling for a faster start. Then it'd actually be legit since he'll get to 6 faster than usual AND will have teleport for map presence throughout the game.  So main issue here isn't the teleport but that he sucks at clearing."

bestofbronze,372m47,blizzlewizzle,3,Sun May 24 07:47:54 2015 UTC,This was seriously the only bronze thing I noticed. And that was probably just a brain-to-fingers miscommunication. Edit: Unless Voli didn't have a smite. Impossible to infer from the picture.
bestofbronze,372m47,tlaine,2,Sun May 24 17:33:52 2015 UTC,"It's much funnier if you assume voli is red side, and thus crossed from top to bot to get gromp, then all the way back to push the wave."

bestofbronze,375oy9,Isshy-Zen,4,Mon May 25 02:34:22 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but this is really boring. Classical music + drawn out bronze gameplay with nothing extraordinarily stupid doesn't make a good video. Thanks for wasting 2 minutes of my life before I got sick of it.  Who knows, it might have gotten more interesting later on, but you failed to edit it to a pace that would interest people. If there's a good part, get to it as soon as you can. You may find the beginning of the laning phase interesting, but everyone else doesn't.  Edit: for instance, look at this video. It's not the best, but it's automatically 100 times better than your one because it's short, to the point, and shows something funny."
bestofbronze,375oy9,StratOCE,2,Mon May 25 03:49:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry if I was brutally honest, but I said nothing that's reportable here. I didn't insult you, I insulted the video.  You know, if you learn to take criticisms and learn from them as opposed to seeing them all as a personal insult you might get out of Bronze faster. Maybe you won't be Bronze at editing videos too.  FYI I'm in Plat :^)"

As for the video, StratOCE does make a point about the music and it's pacing (though he could have said it kinder), the classical music really brings down the mood of something we're to be laughing at as well as many of the bronze plays are drawn out or otherwise uninteresting (in my opinion at least)  Furthermore, if you are gold as you say (giving the benefit of the doubt that this isn't your main though) please do not use rank as an excuse to insult others."

bestofbronze,36o3vx,masonkbr,10,Wed May 20 23:20:35 2015 UTC,"The bigger issue is the fundamental issue of chasing an assassin into the unwarded enemy jungle alone as an immobile carry.
