germany,3e3oh7,monsieurvampy,2,Tue Jul 21 21:39:04 2015 UTC,"Source: Die Welt - 1, 2, 3, 4  Just found a few interesting statistics on career prospects and studies in Germany and felt like sharing them with you people.   From what we can see, a lot of people just come to Germany for their studies and return to their homecountries afterwards. We can also see a trend where students of certain subjects are far more likely to go for a doctorate than others.   A worrying trend (to me) is that while the amount of Germans studying abroad certainly increases, an increasing share refuses to study ""far from home"", i. e. in countries with a significantly different language. At the same time, less and less students see advantages in studying abroad, and foreign students become increasingly isolated. It's a somewhat insular mentality that is developing there.

I wouldn't be surprised if the Bachelor/Master system is one of the causes for this change.  Almost every university has a study time limit (direct or indirect) in place.

germany,3e2cov,curiosu,10,Tue Jul 21 12:35:58 2015 UTC,"Haha, op you can't just ask questions like that to Germans. When i was a kid and my American cousin visited us, we had a fight about this shit pretty much every second day. He was pretty cocky back then and asked the typical American questions. ""Why do you guys drive little cars like that? Ours are all V8."" ""Why do you guys don't water your lawn?"" ""Why do you guys have 3 different trash cans?"" ""Why don't we just drive, i hate walking."" etc. At the end of his vacation he still asked questions, but answered them himself with a lovely: Oh wait, let me guess, because of the fucking environment!!! Good times. But to be serious, i know it sounds pretentious, but i'm pretty sure we actually don't use stuff like that to protect the environment. We simply grew up like that, because there was a hugh movement in the 80(?) which shifted pretty much everything in Germany to the Nachhaltigkeits-Prinzip ~Sustainability-principle. Which means, if you use or destroy anything ""green"", you have to compensate the same amount elsewhere. For example, if you build houses on green valleys, you have to build green valleys, or forrests elsewhere etc. So we try to not waste anything in the first place. Of course our government helps us, buy making waste pretty expensive. Of course we could buy ACs, but we would have a bad feeling everytime we use them and at least every second friend would question our destroying of the planet. Like i said, we grew up like that. There are no Germans that were allowed to let the water run, while brushing their teeth when they were kids."
germany,3e2cov,MadeInWestGermany,3,Tue Jul 21 19:12:30 2015 UTC,"Children shows especially often had an environmental message. The episode of ""Sendung mit der Maus"" I remember most vividly was the one that dealt with crude oil and the one where they showed how PV works.  And of course Löwenzahn with Peter Lustig. I mean, almost every episode either dealt with the environment or alternative lifestyles. I still remember him going to the store and filling his milk can to avoid the garbage associated with the milk packets.  (He was briefly married to author Elfie Donelly who created the stories of Benjamin Blümchen and Bibi Blocksberg which are still popular with young children, I think. These stories also sometimes, though not as often as e.g. Löwenzahn, deal with environmentalist questions. And of course, the people trying to preserve nature always win in the end.)  Not to forget that even before the 1980s the post-WW2 generation shunned wastefulness and needlessly throwing things away which is of course also an environmentalist position.  So yeah, taking care of our environment is pretty much ingrained in German culture from childhood on.   There are no Germans that were allowed to let the water run, while brushing their teeth when they were kids.   Yup, some waterworks even stopped encouraging people to save so much water because there is not enough sewage. Some sewers have to be flushed with water regularily so they don't get blocked when only a trickle runs through all the time. Of course the water works would rather want the sewers to be flushed by sewage we already paid for and not costly water they have to pump in by themselves for free :)"

Edit: price per kWh and 'full power' condition Edit 2: thermodynamics, thanks /u/jpberdel   Modern units might have a coefficient of performance of approximately 3 (i.e., 1 kW of electricity will produce 3 kW of cooling).

germany,3e2cov,Koh-I-Noor,5,Tue Jul 21 13:24:33 2015 UTC,That would be the max output. With how well insulated most German flats are you won't need to run it at max for long to take the edge off the heat.
germany,3e2cov,shniken,10,Tue Jul 21 14:41:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly 0,90 EUR/hour doesn't sound too bad if you just run it for a few hours a day (and probably not on full power anyway).

germany,3e2cov,thunderdragon94,5,Tue Jul 21 14:42:43 2015 UTC,"Correct, it comes with a large extensible hose that connects  to the device (usually for esthetic reasons not pictured in the marketing materials ) and it has on the other end a length adjustable plate that you put on the window and drop the rolladen over it.   It is basically a heat pump and spits out the heat, also it collects the humidity and stores it in an internal tank, what's extra gets evaporated and spit out.  Also for me it has the advantage of collecting the fine textile dust that floats around in the rooms and the air is much much better, I have no clue what the Ionizer function does, probably just  a marketing gimmick but the end result is that I can stay on the coach without sweating and most important we can sleep without the bed sheets sticking to us.  It was not cheap and probably it will go in the Keller in few weeks, but now it's worth all the money.  I may use the air drier function when the humid weather comes, if it helps me get rid of the Schimmel as well then is really the best spend money this year."

germany,3e2cov,thunderdragon94,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:08:12 2015 UTC,3.5 kW is most likely the cooling output not the power input (as stated by Op about 1 kW). Don't confuse that. An A/C does not convert electrical power to heat like a Heizgerät (meaning input = output) but transports energy.

For example, components on an electric circuit board are often isolated from each other or from noise. For some reason, when it comes to heat and electric wires, English uses the island  metaphor (insulation) rather than the direct concept of separation (isolation). Even then , Islands are after all separated from the mainland. Sounds to me like an unnecessary use of an analogy."

Within the context of art (movies, literature) and documentation (books, documentaries) it's permitted, but those regulations are a bit outdated. Videogames and graphic novels for example are not art in the eyes of the law and are censored around here.  In other areas, personality rights are enjoying more protection compared with other nations, for example the right to the own image is much more protected. In general, don't insult people on the Internet and in RL, don't publish anything about them that could harm or even ruin their reputation. Obvious stuff, really.  A bit off-topic, but one annoying thing is that Google and the GEMA haven't yet reached an agreement about music rights.

Sparpreis: Limited availability, need to pay a bit to refund the ticket, bound to one specific train, often really cheap. 0% rebate with BC50, 25% rebate with BC25.   That's the reason many frequent travelers (including me) have both cards.  With the BC50 you can spontaneously (i.e. minutes before the train leaves or even in the train for a surcharge) buy a ticket with 50% rebate. Even than it might be more expensive than booking a fixed-train ticket in advance.  Edit: formatting"

For example, Museums, climbing halls, cinemas and stuff alike I could present My spanish University Card (for a study I finished like 2 years before, but was still valid) and that was it. To get the reduced Price for the Verkehrsverbund in Berlin-Brandenburg I had to present a valid Praktikum contract. For de DB I think there are possibilities that they ask you for a valid German University application acceptance or somethink like that. make sure you get to know how Long before contract Termination you must present the Resignation to it. In germnay there's this extremely annoying term in many contracts where, if you don't say otherwise, they get instantly renovated for another term, and you HAVE to pay. It's the law.

germany,3dx2zf,Panzerlurch,18,Mon Jul 20 08:34:32 2015 UTC,"Really? Erfurt is quite a nice city. Sure I don't want to live there, but when you get there for a few days that's certainly not the first advice that comes to mind. There are many, many worse places."
germany,3dx2zf,I-fuck-horses,3,Mon Jul 20 09:45:06 2015 UTC,Erfurt is quite a nice city. Sure I don't want to live there   best stealth insult of the week.
germany,3dx2zf,pwnies_gonna_pwn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:24:23 2015 UTC,"It has nothing to do with the city. It is purely personal. I used  to live in Thuringia, after having lived in major cities of the world, on other continents, I can't imagine going back even to that German state. At least not to live there. Tanzfest Rudolstadt is almost a must though, whenever I can manage."
germany,3dx2zf,I-fuck-horses,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:26:15 2015 UTC,"oh i can relate a bit.  my ex lived there for a while.   and while going over there for the weekend wasnt that bad, erfurt and the rest of thuringia didnt pass a lot of tests in my book."
germany,3dx2zf,pwnies_gonna_pwn,4,Mon Jul 20 21:16:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was stuck in Weimar for a month. Erfurt was like paradise compared to that"
germany,3dx2zf,tanandblack,6,Mon Jul 20 10:45:47 2015 UTC,People are so mean. I live there. It's certainly the best place to be in this state.
germany,3dx2zf,tiiv,6,Mon Jul 20 12:46:25 2015 UTC,Step 0) don't shoot anybody.

germany,3dx2zf,Panzerlurch,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:02:22 2015 UTC,You must be joking. ICE does not stop there. For reasons.
germany,3dx2zf,phycologist,7,Mon Jul 20 12:32:06 2015 UTC,"ICE do stop there. And Erfurt will become one of the biggest ""ICE Knoten"" soon."
germany,3dx2zf,Streichholzschachtel,0,Mon Jul 20 14:10:23 2015 UTC,"Anything to get away from there, it seems."
germany,3dx2zf,phycologist,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:34:06 2015 UTC,I was going to say  1) die of boredom  But your answer is better!

germany,3dx2zf,rahv7,2,Mon Jul 20 13:41:26 2015 UTC,I'm American sorry if I mispell German words....
germany,3dx2zf,Mafia-Hitman,3,Mon Jul 20 14:13:07 2015 UTC,Don't worry. I just fixed this so everyone interested can find a bit of information.
germany,3dx2zf,rahv7,2,Mon Jul 20 15:10:53 2015 UTC,"If you're into hiking, you could take a look at the Rennsteig and if you have bikes available there's the Ilmtal-Radweg."
germany,3dx2zf,mine0,3,Mon Jul 20 11:31:11 2015 UTC,I loved the zoo in Erfurt. It it pretty big and has walk through monkey pasture.
germany,3dx2zf,Thym15,2,Mon Jul 20 08:48:55 2015 UTC,Visit the citadel
germany,3dx2zf,WeirdStray,-1,Mon Jul 20 13:23:37 2015 UTC,Best advise: do not look like a refugee or a foreigner. The locals are a bit xenophobic.   Why are you going to Erfurt? There are so many better places.
germany,3dx2zf,yet_another_username,-4,Mon Jul 20 15:22:13 2015 UTC,lay down and die slowly as the city does
