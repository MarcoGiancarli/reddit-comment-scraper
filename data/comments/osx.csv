It looks like Events are gone (they're now imported as albums, even if labeled events). So yeah, everything is in your Moments. There doesn't seem to be a way to see what album a photo is in (like for Playlists in iTunes). Though there wasn't a way to do this in Aperture, either.  My impression is that shared albums are cached locally, but if you want to edit anything you have to make an unshared copy (like on the phone). So if the album becomes unshared, you lose the cached version unless you made an explicit copy. Obviously not the best situation since you now have duplicates in your Moments stream, and if photos are added to the shared album, you might not notice you don't have your own copy.

Install python on your mac:  https://www.python.org/downloads/  Open terminal and cd to the folder where you saved the script. For example if i have it set in the Downloads folder i will open up terminal and type:      cd /Users/Anon/Downloads  Now after installing python you should be able to run .py files. This is exactly what we are going to do. Type in your open terminal:      python NAME_OF_YOUR_FILE.py if you downloaded my file it would thus be:      python ""Image Downloader.py""  the quotation marks are there due to the space between the words ;)  The script itself is pretty self explanatory, you define a root database where all the subfolders of queries you make will be created. I tested this by creating a folder in my desktop called ""Testmap"". Now if i use the querie ""Apple"" it will create a folder Apple in the folder Testmap on my desktop. In the folder Apple will be a specified amount of images you'll see in the script :)   There is one glitch though and that is when the file cannot be downloaded. The script downloads JPG & JPEG but .gif files are ignored and sometimes websites protect their images. I have set the script to ignore that particular download and still download 3 usable images but there may be some 0 kb images in your querie folder. You can safely delete those images."

osx,3dxgv9,Emptyless,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:07:15 2015 UTC,I can certainly try to rewrite it ;) What are other limitations that china has compared to search websites.

osx,3dxgv9,throwaway_redstone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:41:15 2015 UTC,"No worries at all. Would Yahoo be the same situation? If so, I can try my friends computer with VPN. Then the only thing would be image size, ""large"" or ""extra large"" images would be best, is this possible just by adding a search keyword operator along with the search item (tried to search for one, couldn't find)? Or could the option be selected to search for extra large images, and then that url could be used for ""base url""? I don't know anything about programming, but its been interesting learning and playing with this, can't thank you enough for your help!!  *edit - i found the large image size keyword for bing by pulling it out of the url, its ""filterui:imagesize-wallpaper"" and for yahoo from the url its ""imgsz=large"" but it doesn't seem work in searches unless I did something wrong, however it seems yahoo automatically returns quite large images by default. I am not sure what it would be for google, if you can find it, or if you can switch the script to yahoo. Let me know, thanks :)"

Here's an example, there are lots more. 10.8 is about to get left behind completely as well.  In addition to that, if you use Xcode for programming on OS X, the current version tends to support the current OS X release and the previous release only, though older versions continue to work on older versions of OS X.

It's hard to give specific advise, as your problem is pretty generic. Does your WiFi connection drop? Are you experiencing weak signal strength or interferences? Have you tried turning it off and on again? ;)  If nothing helps you could try to reinstall the OS. You won't lose any data or settings if everything goes right, but I highly recommend creating a backup just in case!  Perform the following steps to reinstall: restart your Mac and hold down command+R as soon as you hear the startup chime. Your computer will start in recovery mode.

osx,3dtjq6,Klosetto,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:34:47 2015 UTC,"Reinstalling OS X is a bit of a radical approach and can result in a waste of time.  First troubleshooting steps are:   perform a PRAM reset (reboot your computer with the following keys pressed together: Option, Command, P, R; release after the second startup chime). Go to System Preferences>Network and create a new network location; remove all unused services, you'll always be able to add them back should necessity arise try to change your router's WiFi channel. Routers operate on different channels (depending on your geographic area and router make/model: 11, 13 or more). To do so you need access to your router's configuration pages. Do not attempt that if you don't have at least a vague idea of what you're doing. You'll need your router's manual, login and password (usually written on the manual, a good idea would be changing them and WRITING THEM DOWN on the manual). Changing WiFi channel usually gets rid of problems due to interference (the existence of other routers or wireless devices transmitting on the same frequency or close enough to make your connection unstable).   Those are all things that you can do BEFORE reinstalling Mac OS. You could also try erasing the network configuration preferences, but I would advise against it, at least until you try all possible options first."

I tried, I really tried, to make windows work - Cygwin, the Vista UNIX layer - but you're stuck between a hardware manufacturer and a software manufacturer who will bat off any problems as being chased by the other.   OSX is just effortless by comparison. Even using a file requester - it puts windows to Shame, makes me feel like it's a worse version of the Amiga's file requesters from 20 years ago.   Don't mind I'm paying double for the hardware when the computing experience is so much smoother, more stable, less likely to make me want to eat broken glass."
osx,3dt4sx,davemee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:01:05 2015 UTC,"In my experience, having gone through a 2008 Macbook, a 2011 15"" Macbook Pro, a 2013 13"" Air, a 2012 27"" iMac, and currently a 2013 13"" Retina Macbook Pro (I went through a year or so of indecisive fiddling with my setup)... I can't say I've had anywhere near the amount of ""huge problems"" with them that I ever did with Windows. Well, to be clear, I haven't had any huge problems. There will always be the odd hiccup here and there. These are still computers. But, OS X has really given me the impression over the years that I can count on my computer not to mess up. I will open the lid, it will work, I will do things, and I won't have to spend any real time trying to fix something.   Though, in all fairness, I have a Windows 8.1 gaming desktop, and once I got it up and running, it's been pretty damn reliable as well. Windows in its current state is without a doubt dramatically more reliable than 2000, XP, Vista, and even Windows 7 (IMO). My experience with Windows over the past ~23 years or whatever has been considerably more troubled, so I'm still at the point where I personally don't really entrust it to do much more than play games. But, if I'm being fair and objective, that's mostly in my head at this point. A clean install of Windows using common, non-obscure software, on a computer with good, reliable components should really be a reliable machine. The only reason that doesn't always happen as consistently as it should, is because people buy cheap garbage computers filled to the brim with crapware."

A few months with a Mac will make you forget a lot of the nonsense Window users have to put up with: antivirus, firewall, formatting every 2 months are things of the past. In my professional experience, even though Macs are by no means perfect, the majority of incidents I had to deal with were caused by users, and were usually solved in a matter of hours with minor inconvenience. Granted: I tried to resuscitate-sometimes successfully-a number of dead hard drives, and a few models made the news for their defects, but if you compare the number of Macs sold to the number of Macs needing hardware assistance, the figures are enough to shame the most die-hard Windows fans... Bottom line: Macs are for people who need a tool and don't want to waste time to keep that tool functional. I've seen Macs with system folders migrated 6 or 7 times over from previous computers working flawlessly. Try that on a PC.

Just recently got a Lenovo laptop running Win 7 Pro as a work computer at a new job.   It flat sucks. Cheap plastic casing that already shows too many bumps and knocks, kinda crappy keyboard that's hard to type on, very crappy trackpad that constantly confuses left and right clicks, and horrible screen resolution that has me constantly trying to bump everything up to 125% but just gets even fuzzier and remains just as hard to read.  But the worst part is that apparently there's no sleep, but rather a deep hibernation that takes almost six minutes to recover from. Seriously, I open the lid and have to wait to get to a login screen, then have to wait more for the desktop to load, then have to keep waiting for my cursor to stop spinning and become responsive, no, not yet, please keep waiting, then I have to wait even more while previously open programs try and load again.   And after all that, I find Win 7 non-intuitive and kinda weird. Plus the Office programs have mucked up all the menus. What the hell is a ""Ribbon""? Why can't I just Save, Print, or Save As without some sidebar taking over a third of my screen? And why is the Outlook Attachments menu hidden until I'm forced to click on an attachment to preload it in my tiny email message window? Why can't I just Save All Attachments, then open them in the program of my choice for viewing, editing, and renaming? What the hell, Microsoft?  My home MacBook Pro looks and feels good and just works. The keyboard is backlit and comfortable, the display is clear and sharp, the trackpad is responsive, and multi-touch works well. Just close the lid to sleep, then just open the lid and I'm fully back up to speed in seconds, not minutes.   It's so bad that I'm seriously considering buying a new Retina MacBook Pro with my own money just to use at work. Even if I have to load Win 7 Pro on it for a few proprietary programs, the massive frustration reduction is worth it to me.   TL;DR: Just say no to bad design and crappy software . . ."

I don't know if this will help you, but it might be worth trying.   Overall, something's terribly flimsy about updating in OSX.

osx,3dkwe3,Bitruder,15,Fri Jul 17 02:32:07 2015 UTC,"he makes very good points, but I think the point that he's avoiding is the PRICE for the yearly upgrades. there should totally be a kickback for the ongoing development of Fusion, but the price is WAY too much. a $15 or $20 upgrade fee for those that buy every year should be fair. $49.99 is pretty much overkill for the changes being given each year."
osx,3dkwe3,zhiryst,13,Fri Jul 17 02:53:55 2015 UTC,"Mike here, thanks very much for reading the post and providing the feedback =)"
osx,3dkwe3,mikeroySoft,10,Fri Jul 17 04:12:08 2015 UTC,"From a professional perspective, $50 a year (actually $70 something as I'm in Australia) is chump change for something that helps me generate income. For me the biggest plus with v7 is using Fusion to get to our vSphere clusters. No more using a VM to get to my other VM's. These are pretty pro features and I don't know if many people have or are interested in that kind on functionality.  From a personal perspective, perhaps go about the home/pro split and charge accordingly. I'm not sure the OS X market is large enough to offer a free version ala VMWare Player and have a separate Workstation product (you would know better than anyone).  More than happy to pay for pro level stuff in the work environment. But a nice lightweight cheaper version would be great for home where someone has the one VM would be great if you think the market is there for it.  Having said that, Fusion is cheap for what it does. The mentality that over $20 is too expensive is an odd one for me, although I'm in the business where $450 or more for an annual subscription for some licenses is normal. At least with Fusion the old one doesn't stop working after a certain date or the next release comes out. Again, this is where a 'lite' version might appeal to the home market."
osx,3dkwe3,my_clock_is_wrong,3,Fri Jul 17 04:45:36 2015 UTC,"At least with Fusion the old one doesn't stop working after a certain date or the next release comes out.   It sort of does. That's the problem. Yes, your old version will continue to work, but it won't keep up with external factors.  If I buy Adobe Lightroom and then a year later buy a new Nikon camera, I can be assured that Adobe will make the RAW converter for the camera available to me without charging me for this year's version of Lightroom. If I want the big ticket new features, then I have to pay for them, but they'll absolutely try to ensure that the software I already bought remains as useful as it was.   If Microsoft releases a new OS, VMWare requires me to buy Fusion again, at an upgrade price that's nearly as much as the original full version.  The basic issue is that most software companies have a policy that ""works with new stuff"" is a maintenance feature, not a product feature. After a certain point of course, all bets are off. I don't expect a developer to update a 10 or even 5 year old program to work with the latest hardware and software, but within what you'd think of as the normal supported lifespan of a program, this is the kind of thing that they mean by ""supported"". VMWare treats ""works with new stuff"" as product differentiation. That's fine if that's how they want to go, I suppose, but I find it distasteful enough that I'm not going to buy their products."
osx,3dkwe3,deong,2,Fri Jul 17 15:48:12 2015 UTC,"Updating software like Photoshop to support new RAW format is relatively trivial. Updating Fusion to support a new OS probably involves an overhaul of the entire product.  There's a huge difference in the effort involved in supporting those external factors, it's only fair that it's reflected in the price.   (Which tbh isn't even that much)"
osx,3dkwe3,dkeenaghan,3,Fri Jul 17 17:59:33 2015 UTC,"Updating Fusion to support a new OS probably involves an overhaul of the entire product.   That really shouldn't be true. It's more work than a RAW converter for sure, but the underlying hardware model is exactly the same. I would imagine the vast majority of their work isn't in updating it so that a new OS can run, but in adding support for new features like new versions of DirectX.  VirtualBox is open source -- we could presumably look at the size of the changeset needed to go from say Windows 7 to Windows 8 support. I haven't done so, but anecdotally, they're generally able to do so pretty quickly. VMWare (and Parallels) are likely worth the money for most people due to their better support for things like that, but I find it hard to believe that the free version gets quick and apparently minor updates to stay current for a decade straight, and the commercial vendors have to write everything from scratch every 12 months like clockwork."
osx,3dkwe3,deong,3,Fri Jul 17 19:37:40 2015 UTC,"This. If I unload $50 on software, I don't expect to have to pay $50 next year too. I should be able to pay 20% for assurance per year, or upgrade at 50% original cost. If you want $50 a year, give me a subscription model or something."

osx,3dkwe3,MarsSpaceship,8,Fri Jul 17 02:59:21 2015 UTC,"The problem is that people use different reasoning when paying for software. For example: they may pay $60 for GTA V without blinking and whine like hell if a developer launches a new version of their app for $5 or $10. They pay $100, $200, $1000 to watch a football game that lasts a few hours but will not pay $10 for a software they can use for an year or more. They pay $40 for Britney Spears new album but will pirate iOS Apps that cost $1.  Unfortunately software is something completely without value in the head of people. Only companies and professionals pay for software because they fear being caught. The other 99% hate paying for software. They pay if they don't have another choice and they pay with hate."

osx,3dkxc7,wakemeup707,2,Fri Jul 17 03:53:10 2015 UTC,My experience with the El Cap public Beta is that it's pretty solid. Honestly it's better than the current release of Yosemite in a lot of ways. For instance the OpenGL framework is sooo much better than Yosemite's. They did a lot of bug fixes and games are running a lot faster.   Also apps seem to be much more responsive. Chrome for instance now preforms as well in OSX as it does in windows. Which is a big improvement from Yosemite.   Another huge positive is the boot up time is now back to being fast. Yosemite would take forever to boot up on my 27 inch iMac. In El Cap it's instantaneous again.    The only issue I had was during the initial install. It got stuck for about two hours. I turned of the computer mid update and that fixed the issue.   If you have a back up of your system I would try the public beta out.

Eventually I found a little patch file released by Apple and it worked perfectly.   This was years ago so I can't really remember the details but it might lead you in the right direction.

But mostly, security. That's worth any slow down.   Tips: turn on reduce transparency in settings to help the performance not be as bad. Also if you can, a clean install is always much better than an upgrade. Also unless you have a solid state, do not enable FileVault."

osx,3ddvhd,BitWise,2,Wed Jul 15 22:51:41 2015 UTC,"I have the ~/Library folder, and hidden files and folders visible. I was looking in the ~/Library/Application Support folder and noticed Spigot. Did a web search and found this reference on The Safe Mac (the previous version of the page from a few days ago with the red apple logo, going to miss that). Deleted those files and folders, and had to change Safari's search engine, it had been changed to Yahoo!  Anytime you install software check both the ~/Library folder (generally the Application Support folder underneath it but not always, and the ~/Library/Preferences folder. Sort by Date Modified and it will show you the most recent files added/updated."

It also doesn't try to up-sell you to a paid version.  Avast is the worst; I found it annoying me with popups every five minutes or so to let me know that my mail client was syncing and that it was scanning my messages, or something. Avira was in between.  ClamXav is probably even less intrusive, but it has no on-access scanning so it won't protect you during normal computer use, only if you actually open it up and use it to scan something."

The biggest offenders to me are dock icons and the close/minimize icons.   Maybe I'm sitting too close to the monitor but even at ""retina"" you can absolutely see the pixels, so it's best to stick with 2x scaling for perfect results.

Maybe they should use wagons instead of cars, since cars are easier to use. /rant over.   I like the trackpad feature a ton and will play with that in the future. My Hammerspoon doesn't even begin to touch upon that, for it is just a OS X version of all the Linux tilling window managers. My favorite Hammerspoon features are:   When I move a window to one side, if there is something taking up that side, the windows swap places instead of covering one another. I have it so the selected window is on one side and all the other open apps / open windows are made into smaller tiles that take up the other side. I can cycle through them, and if I hotkey to align them to one side, all the others are condensed into the new set of tiles.

Writing directly to the drive itself would be just as bad (or worse) than writing to files with the restricted flag.  Note that this issue will only occur with Boot Camp VM's (or more specifically, VM's which use a raw disk for the drive on which your boot volume is located), but it will occur regardless of whether you use such VM in Parallels, VMware, or VirtualBox.

There were three elevated levels, each restricting more and more behaviors. For example, one level restricts modification of firewall rules, another prevents clearing noschg, etc. You can't lower security level on a running system. IIRC, you could set an elevated security level in rc.conf and then make that noschg. Of course then you had to boot single user to change system config, but that's the price I guess."

I had to do this when I deleted /usr/local, not knowing at the time that SIP was a thing and I'd be unable to recreate it the normal way.  Disabling SIP outright didn't work for some reason. ln kept getting permission errors, not sure why. So what I had to do was:   Reboot into the recovery partition cd /Volumes/$DISK/usr mkdir local (It'll inherit the restricted flag from /usr at this point) bin/chflags norestricted local Re-reboot   Sorry for so many I-don't-knows where  I haven't fully researched, but the step by step might help someone else who messed up the same way I did."

The Security Configuration app makes a call to a private API in /System/Library/Extensions/AppleEFIRuntime.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleEFINVRAM.kextcalled com.apple.private.iokit.nvram-csr.  This call creates/updates an NVRAM key/value that can only be written by Apple-signed apps that can access the private API. The key name is called csr-active-config. You can try for yourself by running: sudo nvram csr-active-config=""test"". If I recall correctly, you'll see that the command will appear to execute successfully, but running nvram -p will not show the value.  Edit: additionally, and this might be a bug, if you try to use Security Configuration.app while booted into El Cap (i.e., not booted in Recovery Mode) to disable SIP, you'll get the following error: ""Mach error -536870212 - (iokit/common) general error"".

osx,3d54ie,yertles,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:29:33 2015 UTC,You will need to differentiate the difference between the numerical and alphabetical characters. How? Convert the first character to ascii and check it's value. If it falls between the ascii values between 0-9 then you have an number you want to skip. If outside those bounds you have a word (first character is a letter) and you can apply your quotes. This is a low level way of doing it but anything out there that checks the difference between a letter and number is doing this anyway. You'll have to iterate through each block of characters (space delimited) but I don't know the exact specifics of your data set so it is up to you how to apply this logic.

I, for one, can not connect to 'eduroam' which is a WiFi network used on university campusses around the world.  Split View does not work as I expected. You can not use it for apps that are not full screen and a lot of my apps seem to crash when using split view (Word for example) First time I used Spotlight again the Spotlight search bar was at the bottom of my screen and the search results were off-screen (fixed this by manually replacing the Spotlight search bar, which I actually like a lot) Still no fix for the my computer sounding like an airplane and generating enough heat to cook a steak on the bottom while playing HD YouTube clips in Firefox or Chrome (or is there a fix for this that I have not found yet?) Feedback Assistant crashes on every start   Positive    As promised by Apple, apps do indeed open  a LOT faster, I mean like a lot. I have an 'old' early 2011 MBP and Firefox opens after just 'jumping' one time in the dock. As comparison: it jumped about 10-15 times in Yosemite.  Putting apps full screen goes a lot faster, which I like. Mission Control feels less clumsy and I already use it a lot more than in Yosemite My Macbook even starts faster. While in Yosemite restarting my Macbook took about a decent 2-3 minutes, in El Capitan this only takes like 1 minute, 2 minutes tops. Auto-hiding the menu bar is a major feature for me, as I don't like putting apps full screen and switching between desktops. (You can turn this on in System Preferences > General (under Appearance))   I do know that this is just a beta preview but so for I'm quite happy with the outcome. The only thing really bothering me is the persistent WiFi-issues with eduroam which started with Yosemite and have not been fixed or improved ever since (I had no problems with eduroam when using Mavericks)."

osx,3cy8dc,Plastonick,0,Sat Jul 11 21:29:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with that, but it feels so sluggish going into it and out (I heard it's a lot better in El Cap, though).  I have multiple monitors but if I fullscreen Safari for instance, my other monitor turns black.  Is there a way to prevent that or is that normal?  I guess with how big resolutions are nowadays, I don't feel it necessary to fullscreen 99% of my apps.  Only a few apps really benefit or make use of it -- mostly creative production apps.  I wish they return the old style of maximizing windows and add in a modifier for the new fullscreen style.  It just feels like one of those half-baked gimmicky things that Samsung would do, not Apple."

And if I'm doing many things at the same time, swiping four fingers left or right is way faster and more intuitive than command+tabbing or swiping up exposé and then selecting the window.  If I'm browsing, then I browse using my full screen.  If it's something that I rarely do, I keep it in fullscreen too and in the last position, like iTunes (because I don't want to clutter my workspaces with an iTunes window, but I still like to have it on reach)  If I'm concentrated writing, I fullscreen the text editor. Only in the middle of the research progress, when I need my bibliography manager, papers and text documents at the same time, I keep them as windows."

If they really wanted you to use widgets, why would they move them from a 100% screen real estate area into a little hidden scrolling box?

I use Mail, Calendar (in full screen), RDP (in full screen), Messages, Chrome, SecureCRT, Cisco ASDM and Finder daily. Once initial Indexing finished i rebooted. After reboot i instantly noticed all Mission Control were so much faster which was my biggest gripe from 10.10. Safari also had a some weird glitches with scrolling which seem to be gone in 10.11 beta.   I've only used it for about 30 minutes but initial impressions are very good. I'm sure it will only get better before launch. As someone already said this performance isn't even including Metal which works on or will work on 2012+ models. I'll be really interested to hear people posting their results with those models. My biggest frustration with Yosemite was Mission Control got butchered with these older models, i'm glad to see the animations are faster again. With an SSD these 2010 models should be good as new."

Under 10.10 I hit the button on my mouse for it, the whole screen stops for a split second, and then I see the animation showing the desktop exiting mission control.  I then have to hit it again and it will enter it.  If that would go away that'd be great.  I do a bunch of programming and Unity gamedev fiddling, and end up with tons of windows open.

osx,3cm0ag,E437BF7BD1361B58,-2,Thu Jul 9 14:21:04 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but there's a lot of things that I'd love to be produced, but there just isn't a market for them.    I think you're forgetting how much marketing, image, and force of limited choices play into this. Apple is beholden to market forces to a large amount, but they have a lot of leeway to set what that demand is. They don't just make the hardware, they're also tastemakers and marketers par excellence.  I really wish I could buy a T61 Thinkpad with a 2560x1440 IPS panel and a RISC processor. Now, THAT is never going to happen. A slightly thicker MacBook Pro with standard notebook components is certainly within Apple's margin of responsiveness to demands of the market. These are their professional level tools and for people who are really hot for thin and light they have a product line that's more suited to that.  The best example of how Apple disregards what their customers want is the Mac Pro. It's certainly an engineering achievement and an impressive piece of industrial design. It's just not a great form factor for a Unix graphics workstation with all its sacrifices of utility for that unique form factor. It was not what people wanted, which was just the same Mac Pro with upgraded hardware."
osx,3cm0ag,GoldenBough,6,Thu Jul 9 02:17:27 2015 UTC,"A slightly thicker MacBook Pro with standard notebook components is certainly within Apple's margin of responsiveness to demands of the market.   How do you know this?  Like, really really know it, willing to bet millions of dollars on it know this?  Have you done extensive market research, talked to dozens of the best engineers around, solicited feedback from thousands and thousands of users, poured over thousands and thousands of lines of data regarding purchases and other data?  Because Apple has."
osx,3cm0ag,Greenman851,4,Thu Jul 9 02:23:02 2015 UTC,"Exactly. This guy is basically saying I want it, so apple should responsibly make it for me, even though they have more resources and feedback in their pinky fingernail to determine what kind of computer to make than we all collectively have in our own minds."

osx,3cm0ag,Shaffle,3,Thu Jul 9 02:29:52 2015 UTC,"Nope, those days are done. The new Dell and HP machines that compete in the same arena are built the same way (their entry level business laptops are still the upgradeable workhorses they've always been, but they're twice the weight. HP and Dell's portable+powerful options are built just like the Macs).  The build quality on the new unibody Macs really is quite good-I have a fair number of them deployed and they haven't had any hardware issues yet. They'll serve us well for 5 years easily (thats how long our depreciation cycle is) and then we'll send them in for recycling and upgrade."
osx,3cm0ag,cloudmech,7,Thu Jul 9 12:34:02 2015 UTC,"The pathological obsession with thinness and lightness has been irritating to me for a long time. It's clear that those attributes are highest on their list of priorities. It sort of makes sense for a device you always hold in your hands, like a phone or a tablet, [but laptops are always rested on a surface when used]. They don't move around a whole lot. And saving a few hundred grams in your backpack/bag really isn't something [anyone is] going to notice. And look what it costs us.  The 2010 and earlier MacBook Pros had already reached a comfortable size for human beings--and the size and geometry of the human body isn't changing any time soon. Continuing to make them thinner and lighter is pure vanity.  If I could trade 10-20mm of extra thickness for getting standard notebook components instead of everything being soldered to the logicboard I would in a heartbeat. As it is now, if something breaks, you have to send it to Apple and the entire board has to be replaced at great cost--money, time, and environmental impact.  It's sad because I started buying Macs when this wasn't the case and I watched them slowly integrate everything into a single board stuffed inside the chassis (the new MacBook). I don't think they'll ever backtrack on this. There's too much momentum in the company driving them to make thinner and lighter devices."
osx,3cm0ag,Shaffle,6,Thu Jul 9 00:15:08 2015 UTC,"They don't move around a whole lot.   Whoa there, be careful projecting your particular use case across the whole population.   And saving a few hundred grams in your backpack/bag really isn't something I'm going to notice.   To you, maybe.  How about if they had said ""good enough!"" at 5 lbs and never bothered to shrink it?   And look what it costs us.   Costs who?  Again, you're projecting your personal needs across millions of prospective users.  How many people who owned laptops that could be user serviced ever did it themselves?  Think it was even 1%?  You have to recognize that you are a niche market, and one that isn't ever really satisfied with anything.  Why should Apple cater to you?"

First, install ffmpeg. Easiest place to get it from is here. Choose which version is right for you and download it. I'll assume you downloaded it to your Downloads folder under your user folder. Extract the zip file and you'll find three tools called ffmpeg, ffplay and ffprobe.  Second, you need to put them somewhere where they can be found. Press Cmd+Space and type Terminal to bring up a command prompt. In this command prompt, type:  mkdir ~/tools  mv ~/Downloads/ffmpeg ~/tools  echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/tools' >> ~/.bash_profile  source ~/.bash_profile`   ffmpeg should now be installed. Type ffmpeg and you should get some version info etc.  For this example, I'll assume your videos are in a folder on your desktop called 'videos' and that there is nothing else in this folder other than the videos you want to trim.  Go back to the Terminal and type:  cd ~/Desktop/videos  mkdir done  for files in *; do ffmpeg -i ""$files"" -t 00:00:10 -c:v copy -c:a copy ""done/$files""; done;   These commands create a folder called done and then for each video it copies the first ten seconds of the video and audio tracks to a new video file with the same name under that folder."

Even then it won't be precise because ffmpeg will skip to the end and, because of the way video is in encoded, it will find the next key frame. So it won't be exactly ten seconds."

Also, it might be a teensy bit slow because of this.  To make this work, copy ffprobe to the same folder as ffmpeg:  cp ~/Downloads/ffprobe ~/tools/   Then go to the same folder you were in before.  cd ~/Desktop/videos   Now this next command is all one line and is going to be pretty long. I assume the 'done' folder is still there.  for files in *; do length=`ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=duration -of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1 ""$files""` ; intlen=`echo ""${length%.*}"" - 10 | bc` ; ffmpeg -y -i ""$files"" -ss $intlen -c:v copy -c:a copy ""done/end_$files""; done;   This will you a set of files with 'end_' as a prefix. They won't be precisely 10 seconds, and I can't think of a way or any other software to do this that would be able to be precise about it with compressed video just because of the way compressed video works."

osx,3cijkb,5HT-2a,2,Wed Jul 8 04:55:29 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's the one.  So, you have to install Windows first. After that I would do OS X, since you need it to get the other two working... Leave room for Linux of course. Once that's up, go ahead and reboot into your Linux install media.  Basically there are two key files in the /boot directory of your Linux system... There's Linux itself (the ""vmlinuz"" file) and the pre-boot system (""initrd.img"").  The idea is to copy these to the very first partition on your drive (the hidden one). If you're booted into the Linux installer, you can open it by running the following:  mount -t vfat /dev/sda1   Copy those two /boot files your Linux installer to the /EFI/Linux folder in that partition. Name them ""vmlinuz.efi"" and ""initrd.img"" so that they're in the following locations:  /EFI/Linux/vmlinuz.efi /EFI/Linux/initrd.img   You can then install Linux normally. Let us know once you get that far and we'll walk you through the rest."

osx,3c5tf8,Squirrel_In_A_Tuque,2,Thu Jul 9 22:11:48 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking about it, but honestly if it doesn't show up in Disk Utility, that's a fairly big problem. The file system is unreadable, not even from a different computer. I'm sorry, but I can't think of any solutions here besides the one you don't want to take.  All software updates carry a marginal degree of risk. The risk is low, but it's not zero, especially with an unsupported (by Apple) storage configuration. So consider the very real possibility that the stuff is just gone. How do you move on from there? Well, after you fix it, consider how much of your important stuff you have on iCloud or some other cloud service like Dropbox or Google Drive. If your email service is IMAP, then all your recent emails will just download from the server, so you don't lose anything there. There may also be things you can sync back from your smartphone, if you have that sort of thing going on.  If you're really desperate, you can try data recovery software like Data Rescue Pro or Drive Genius. Those usually cost about $100. They're not guaranteed to work, but in this situation, they are very likely to work as long as you don't do anything with the drive before running them. They'll also probably give you more stuff than you want. You have a backup, and I assume there are just a small handful of files that are different from 2 weeks ago. Well, data recovery will give you everything, without their proper names or the folders they were in. But at least you get your files back.  Some tips on fixing it (but in a way that you lose your data): Since your getting that screen, it's likely that you don't have a recovery partition on your drive. If your backup was a Time Machine backup onto an external drive (not a network drive), you will have a recovery partition on the time machine backup drive. Connect it, and reboot it while holding option to see the name of your backup drive appear, and boot to that.  From there, you will have to open Disk Utility and re-partition the drive completely, not just erase. Make sure the partition map scheme is set to GUID Partition Table and the volume format is Mac OS Extended (Journaled) — don't use case-sensitivity.  You can then do a restore from time machine, but I recommend doing a reinstall first and the migrating your data from the backup. The reason for this is it would save you the trouble of having to do the update again. A reinstall will install OS X with the latest update. I believe it would also copy over the recovery partition onto your SSD (not 100% certain though), while a full restore wouldn't do that.  If your backup wasn't Time Machine, or it was on a network drive, you can boot to internet recovery by holding Command-Option-R on startup. This recovery partition will install the OS that came with your computer (which, since it's a 2011 model, is going to be Lion). It will install recovery partition for you and then you can upgrade to Yosemite from the Mac App Store which will give you a Yosemite recovery partition and the 10.10.4 update at the same time, but at this point it may just be easier to restore from backup to save you the trouble of downloading the OS twice."

It has issues, but I don't think they're as serious as you describe and I think most are easily fixable. Do you have specific examples of terrible design, or are you conflating poor design with your apprehension for an unfamiliar new user interface?  ""adding songs to a playlist is insanely complicated""  No, it's actually pretty simple. Since at least iOS 7, Apple has been using the ellipsis as a symbol for contextual menus. Click on the ellipsis button next to a song, and a menu appears which includes ""Add to Playlist"". You're then presented with a list of your playlists to choose from.  The main problem I see here is that there is no option to create a new playlist within this flow. You can only add the song to an existing playlist. This is what I meant by ""easily fixable.""  Alternately, if you're already viewing a playlist, you can add a song by clicking ""edit"" and then clicking the green ""add songs"" button at the top of the list.   Also, in iTunes you can select multiple songs and then right click your selection for a contextual menu that includes an ""add to playlist"" option.  Pretty straightforward, I think.  ""and it's different between OS X and iOS.""  Many things are different between OS X and iOS. This is not automatically a bad thing, as different screen sizes and input methods often favor different interaction models.   In iTunes on OS X, again there are contextual ellipsis menus providing the option to add a song to a playlist. These can be accessed from the ""now playing"" window at the top of the application and also next to the song title in any list view.  http://i.imgur.com/VokrcxH.png  Spotify is not my idea of brilliant user interface design. It has certain features that Apple would be wise to mimic, but copying its UI design wholesale would not be an improvement.  Here's my wishlist for changes to Apple music:   Provide simpler access to every artist's complete music catalog   (Single click to an artist's main page, from anywhere an artist's name is displayed)  (Every artist's page should include a photo and bio)  (Single click access to all albums and songs from artist's home page)   Expose precise music sub-genres throughout UI   (""house"" & ""techno"" vs. ""dance"")   Allow users to globally customize genre list to hide unwanted genres Add ""dislike/broken heart"" buttons Add automatic beat-matching & smooth transitions when skipping Include BPM in ID3 tags for all songs Split Beats 1 Radio into genre-specific shows  Allow public playlists and following of other users' playlists Improve UI for scrubbing to different parts of a song Replace FF/RW buttons with 15 or 30 second skip buttons Include NEW music in ""For You"", not just stuff that was released years ago Provide easy way to differentiate between ""owned"" and ""rented"" music"

First create the file on your Desktop (or whatever location you'd like):  touch ~/Desktop/PlexConnect.sh   Next, set the permissions of the file such that it is executable:  chmod +x ~/Desktop/PlexConnect.sh   You can then edit the contents of the script with your text editor of choice, just make sure it begins with the following line so that the system knows to run it using the shell (Bash):  #!/bin/bash   The file can then be double-clicked, launching Terminal and executing it.  A more elegant solution for this, however, may be to create an AppleScript application which runs the command for you. Open the ""Script Editor"" application and paste in the following:  do shell script ""/Applications/PlexConnect-master/PlexConnect.py"" with administrator privileges   Save this as an ""Application,"" naming it whatever you'd like.

Unlike a read-write `.dmg file, they only occupy as much space as the files they contain (approximately). They allow for storage of a Mac OS Extended (HFS+) filesystem within other filesystems.   The last detail is primarily why sparse bundles are used; this allows for functions which require HFS+ (say, Time Machine or the Photos app) to store their data on a network share or non-HFS+ external drive.  I can't think of any reason to create a sparse bundle with a larger capacity than its containing filesystem, though. :P"

osx,3bw5lz,5HT-2a,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:35:41 2015 UTC,Here is the detailed setup.  The enclosure is a TR5UT+(B) using 5 1tb drives.  The first four comprise a raid 5 volume.  The last disk is just exposed as a single volume.  This is configured using the raid tool for the enclosure.  OS X then sees one 3tb and one 1tb volume that can be partitioned / formatted.  No raid controller as the mac is a mac mini so it is connected via USB 3.  After the upgrade / reboot the enclosure's utility showed the raid volume but the single disk volume was missing and the disk was not assigned.

Humidity varies from 0 to 100%; and under many conditions throughout the year, stepping outside your door invokes a 30–50ºF (16–30ºC) rise or drop in temperature.   Wash the dishes?

Now in El Capitan, Disk Utility can at least resize stacks just like Boot Camp Assistant, and diskutil's fine-tuned resizing is now fully documented.

osx,3bndpa,Polymira,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:47:39 2015 UTC,"From. Wikipedia   Trim was introduced soon after SSDs were introduced. Because low-level operation of SSDs differs significantly from hard drives, the typical way in which operating systems handle operations like deletes and formats resulted in unanticipated progressive performance degradation of write operations on SSDs.[2] Trimming enables the SSD to handlegarbage collection overhead, which would otherwise significantly slow down future write operations to the involved blocks, in advance.[3]"

On previous OS X, the logic was:  Are both of these true: • drive reports it supports TRIM • drive is made by Apple  With trimforce enable the logic becomes: • does the drive report it supports TRIM?  In other words, this switch tells your computer to stop caring if it's an Apple drive or not. Since some SSDs have had poor TRIM implementations that can cause data loss, Apple only enables it by default and officially supports it for their SSDs. Other brands are at-your-own-risk."

I also look at this as a test grounds OS and mainly for windows, so I can have all my utilities that are lacking in the OSX world.  What makes networking more powerful in fusion?  I didn't see anything different from the regular assortment of options in parallels...   What do you consider a headless tool?  Are you referring to console commands or the lack of support install tools for a fully functioning PC?    My new rMBP has a very speedy SSD in it, so I'm not sure disk IO would be noticably different unless there was something else going on (hypervisor related).

osx,3bdm69,5HT-2a,3,Sun Jun 28 06:55:50 2015 UTC,"So, here's my setup.  ""Headless"" refers to the fact that I don't actually use VMware's ""screen,"" or even have the VMware app open; instead, I boot the VM's in the background using Terminal (or rather, have launchd boot them in the background).  The ""raw disk"" thing is what is involved in making a Boot Camp VM in Parallels or VMware; this is important because I have VM's of systems that I can also boot from. VMware has a command-line utility for creating these disks for arbitrary partitions, and they can then be added and removed from VM's by editing their config files (one thing that's nice about Virtual Box is you can do this from the GUI).  This may have changed since I last tried Parallels over a year ago, but in my experience I got better performance out of VMware with the same OS's. If I were to guess, I'd say the wide performance disparity you saw came from Parallels's better performance with virtual disks, which I don't use.  As far as networking, VMware provides for networks with customized bridged adapters, DHCP servers, and virtual adapters both the on the host and guest end, and allows for those networks to be added and removed from multiple VM's. I couldn't find anything in Parallels beyond the standard interface, whereas this is all accessible via VMware's config files and command-line tools.  Anyway, yeah, you can tell I love this stuff too. :P"

On the Linux side, for interactive sessions (i.e. you're using the KDE / Gnome desktop) I also find Parallels to be far better. But, I don't believe Parallels has a headless option - which has already been pointed out.

osx,3bcgbv,Emptyless,3,Sat Jun 27 22:15:59 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up - this opens your TM filesystem directly to the internet, and the time machine doesn't have a proper firewall in place to prevent someone checking for IPs with open ports brute forcing your password.  I wouldn't recommend doing this without a VPN or tunneled over SSH because doing it this way will eventually end in someone getting your password AND your files in one fell swoop.  EDIT: Also this will break from time to time when your ISP changes your IP address (assuming you don't have a static IP (very few residential customers would)).  You would need to go do step #2 from your home network to find out what the new IP address they gave you is."
osx,3bcgbv,magoodhue,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:38:08 2015 UTC,"ELI5: If someone were to try to hack my Airport Time Capsule, what would be the benefits of a VPN? Does a VPN connection ensures that they cannot bruteforce their way into my network?   The way i understand a vpn works is that you are virtually connected to a network without physically being there. You would be able to use the SMB shares of the Airport Time Capsule.   But i do not see the difference (due to lack of experience) between logging in in a VPN or logging in to my Time Capsule using my password.   for example, if i buy a raspberry pi and install a VPN on it, will it be more secure to connect to the raspberry pi and than acces my shares?"
osx,3bcgbv,magoodhue,2,Sun Jun 28 13:56:15 2015 UTC,"The main difference is that almost all VPN software has at least a fail2ban type system to mitigate brute force attacks, you can probably restrict access to only from your home/work/mobile carrier networks, etc.  So you'd still have ports exposed to the internet, but if someone happens to find your network and open ports, they'd get temporarily banned from submitting further login requests, dropping their ""guess"" rate from 10k/day to like like 5/day  The other problem is that AFP wasn't intended for WAN access - it doesn't encrypt data in transit, may not encrypt passwords, probably has optimization issues, etc.  You might also consider running a bit torrent sync client on a raspberry pi instead.  That would probably get you a lot closer to how you actually want this to work - just point the pi to the time machine shares, and then you get like a pseudo-dropbox top functionality."
osx,3bcgbv,TerminalFoo,3,Sun Jun 28 15:01:03 2015 UTC,@OP  This is not at all recommended. You have essentially opened up your Time Machine to the outside world via those ports.  You should instead setup a VPN and use the VPN connection to access your shares.

osx,3bcgbv,john_eric,2,Sun Jun 28 13:53:23 2015 UTC,"Just because a company puts in a feature doesn't mean that it is secure. Apple has not implemented anything. You are simply using what all routers can do. However, in your case you have exposed yourself.  In your setup, you are vulnerable to brute force attacks, injection attacks, and interception attacks. In brute force, the malicious entity simply keeps guessing at your login information until it works. In injection attacks, the malicious entity simply jumps between you and your capsule from the outside. Then, the entity can deliver any bad payload and your computer wouldn't second guess it. In interception attacks, the malicious entity acts as a middleman of sorts and can capture transactions between you and your capsule and use them later to get at all the information in your capsule.  In general, your current access method is not secure. A VPN would create an encrypted tunnel which then makes injection and interception attacks much harder to do. Also, brute forcing becomes even harder when some VPNs use keys that are many more bits than a simple password. Furthermore, VPNs are rate limited on the number of authentication attempts from a single user."

Also, you can usually make any HID, USB, or MIDI device programmable by using it with Controllermate.  This is my favorite OS X software because it lets you make hotkeys to do anything, and even lets you make button combinations on your controllers that launch certain games and programs etc.  It even lets you reconfigure acceleration curves in first person shooter games, etc. It lets you count button presses, and use timers and logic gates in programming your button combinations, and is just all around fantastic.  As far as the headset, it is less likely to work. If it uses a microphone in and out cable, or separate audio cables, you'll be able to get an adapter to make it work with the mac's audio input.

Depending on how you have them named right now, this may be time-consuming.  Since Yosemite came out, there has been a bulk rename feature added to Finder. You can sort your files by kind, highlight multiple Pages documents, control-click, and hit ""Rename."" Format or Add Text may be your best options to make this easier. Then you would rename each Keynote accordingly so they match their mates.  If all of your Pages documents are in separate folders, you can have them presented in a single window by entering any text in the Search field, then click away from the search field, click the +, have it filter by kind ""Document"" or file extension "".pages"", then remove the text you entered into the search field.

I think most music players use that structure too.  I don't exactly know what you want, so i know these aren't what you're looking for, but in the case of not finding the player you're looking for, these are directions to go possibly.  also if you're music is sorted with each file named like ""artist-album-song"" and you don't want to sort that (i'm guessing because of the non library orientated requirement) than beets is a really great way to resort your music they way you need it"

The simplest thing that could possibly work is just a daemon that keeps monitoring and killing Civ V when it's launched, but in that case I'd just kill the daemon and continue doing whatever I wanted. Same story for any other similar debilitation, actually, so not very effective (anything where the app is actively preventing me from what I want).   A cooler, more complicated, effective kind of plan is to shut down the target app and encrypt the binary for some time, only making the key available once the set time has elapsed. That also seems more risky, though, cause if the app fails or key is lost then your install of Civ V (or whatever) is gone forever. And if you remedy that risk by keeping local copies of the key then I could use that to decrypt and play my game (though the effort and/or technical know-how at that point might still be a sufficient barrier).

osx,3b3fjq,TheEndTrend,5,Thu Jun 25 17:30:07 2015 UTC,"You have a permissions issue on your home folder. Running Repair Disk Permissions in Disk Utility will not help, as it does nothing to your home folder. Also, the fact that you're running Yosemite is irrelevant in this case. I've seen this problem with all versions of OS X going back to Leopard. Something odd happened when your home folder was migrated to Yosemite, probably.  Follow the directions given in this article, and they work in all OS' leading up to Yosemite. The ""apply to enclosed items"" thing will probably work as long as your home folder has these permissions:   ""You have custom access"" Your user has Read & Write privileges ""staff"" has Read only privilege ""everyone"" has Read only privilege   Then next time you open Safari or reboot the system, you will still have the same problem, but only once. After you close the Safari tabs and all the apps and such, rebooting a second time should not produce the problem.  If the permissions of the home folder are not as I listed above, or if it doesn't correct the problem, then you probably need to do the more advanced steps (some of which are in this article). In that case, it'd be better if you called AppleCare. They can walk you through it over the phone, and the liability won't be on some stranger on the internet.

The lock flag can prevent the repair for working.  However, Apple hid the Reset Password Utility with that resetpassword command, and did not publicly document how to get to it. It may seem silly, but I thought of this as internal knowledge and I didn't want to reveal what someone may consider internal knowledge, even though it's a badly kept secret. Their official solution was the apply-to-enclosed-items trick, and only after the 10.7.2 update (I think), because apparently something about that update makes it do something a bit differently.

[songs/artists/albums]   choose songs, then enter a reasonable number (try 1000 - seems to be issues if you input too high a number), and then your playlist should fill up  however, if you prefer to manually select your music to add to the queue, while you are in ncmpcpp press the 2 key on your keyboard which should take you to the browser screen.  from here you can navigate to the music folder you want to add, and once you find the song, just press the space bar and it will add to the queue.  you can then press 1 to go back to the playlist, and press Enter/Return to start  of course, there are many more things you can do with mpd/ncmpcpp, so if you have any questions, just ask!"

The numbers must be seperated by a  ',' without the quotation marks.   RootofDatabasePath must be set to the root directory of the database  NewFolderPath must link to the folder you want to copy  For example.

You can see in which folder you are using:  ls   to change folders use:  cd   to go from /Users to /Users/Harry/Documents you type:  cd Harry/Documents   once you are in the folder in which it is stored.

osx,3ay904,Emptyless,2,Wed Jun 24 19:23:51 2015 UTC,"Python was my first thought too. A few comments:   Are you sure that you are formatting your shutil.copy2 statement correctly?

It would be easier to put all 400 into a text file with one SKU per line, and build the dictionary by reading the file.  Is it necessary to loop through the dictionary by index number? you can just loop through the list directly.   My take on your script:  import os import shutil  #Set your starting and destination directories root_path = ""Root of Your database eg. /Users/Harry/Downloads"" dest_path = ""New folder you want to copy your files to !MUST EXIST! eg. /Users/Harry/Desktop/Image Folder""  #generate list of SKU from a file named ""file_list.txt"" in the same directory as the script file. #Assumes that the file is plain text, with one SKU per line names_of_pictures = [] with open('file_list.txt', 'r') as f:     for line in f:         #file will read SKU as strings, so just add file extension now         names_of_pictures.append(line.rstrip(""\n"")+"".jpg"")  #check each file under the base path to see if it is found in names_of_pictures for root, dirs, files in os.walk(root_path):     for file_name in files:         if file_name in names_of_pictures:             shutil.copy2(root+""/""+file_name, dest_path)"

osx,3aqg2q,MintyPhoenix,11,Tue Jun 23 17:02:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think there's any particular reason. Either it just never occurred to them, or Microsoft patented it, making it an exclusive feature. Microsoft took Windows into a direction that attempted to mimic web browsing to make some kind of statement that they are all about the web. Apple took OS X in a direction for ease of use for everyone, even those who don't have any idea what a filesystem is, while at the same time allow advance users to still get everything they need. (When I was doing tech support, I encountered people who said they never used Finder. They considered it an advanced feature that wasn't for them. So there is some logic to it.) As such, there has been an active effort to hide the filesystem a bit, so only advanced users know where to find it.  Meanwhile, Microsoft copied many many features of OS X while adding a few of their own, and Apple largely ignored what was going into Windows and doing their innovation thing... to some extent. The new split-screen view in El Capitain is likely a way to get functionality similar to one of Windows' best features.  Anyway, sorry to go on like that. Perhaps if you told us what you are trying to use the file path for, that might help. If you're doing command-line stuff in Terminal, for example, you can just drag & drop a folder into the Terminal window, and it will populate the entire path.

That sounds a tiny bit ridiculous, but think of it this way.   Windows file systems are generally not case senitive. You can you TAB to autocomplete any case in a path quite happily.   OSX paths are case sensitive and if you use CMD+SHIFT+G enough (or terminal) you know that already.   If you're not a power user and don't know that, you're likely to have a bad time using an address bar in Finder. For everyone else, the keyboard shortcut above is just as fast."

I was able to improve my wifi reception by the following:   if you have both 2.4 and 5ghz wifi, switch to 5ghz, because it seems less people use 5ghz when setting up their home wifi, and also there are more channels available. if you're using 2.4 ghz, you only get 3 channels to use. Make sure that your access point is set to either choose the channel automatically, or manually set it to not conflict with neighboring access points. to list all the details of neighboring access points and see if they could be competing with yours, do this:   option-click on the wifi icon at the top-right of the screen select 'open wireless diagnostics'. It will pop-up a window and ask you to continue, but I don't think the diagnostics procedure is much help... instead, select from the Wireless Diagnostics 'Window' menu the option 'Scan', and it will show you all the details for your neighbors. you want to make sure that whatever channel you're using is different from everybody elses."

Gmail disabled those for the native mail client of iOS.   Forwarding mail in Gmail can be done with these steps:   open gmail press the gear box logo in the top right  select settings select 'Forwarding & POP/IMAP' in the menu bar under 'Forwarding' put in your iCloud email adres as the forwarding adres and select 'keep gmail copy' this will ensure that you can still use gmail in a browser if you do not like iCloud.com   your all done :)  edit: formatting"

So running Yosemite with TrimEnabler is exactly like running Mavericks with TrimEnabler: mildly more unsafe. EXCEPT that Mavericks doesn't have the patch for the launchagent[?] zero-day exploit, so it's actually way more unsafe.   Upgrade to Yosemite. Disable kext signing, run TrimEnabler.

Personally I use OS X daily and have for quite a while and hate every second of it, but I have to use it to develop for iOS. Also; there's nothing wrong with amazing marketing, it's the one thing Apple always did well and no one can argue that. In fact in the last 20 years I think the only time Apple products weren't seen as purely a status symbol was the release of the early iPod and iPhones. They've (sadly) regained that reputation.  I'm not sure of the point you're trying to make. Developers make roughly equal amounts of money over time(initially iOS makes more, but that diminishes slowly, where as Android starts slow and stays slow.)

Most people seems not to care overly much, but for me, my photos (around 20k of them from 1995 or so) are my most valued possession.   For this reason, I have decided to keep my photos in a simple directory structure. This folders I back up to time machine of course, but also CCC makes frequent backups to a Fat32 and an exfat drive.  No proprietary databases and things for my photos.   For browsing and smart folders, I use HoudahSpot, for editing etc I use various stand alone editors. Hazel takes care of lossless editing, it moves the RAW and the edited jpg to different trees, automatically renamed to a specific filename format.   So, use whatever you want, but have a good (tested!!) platform agnostic backup. You never know how the computer landscape will look in 10 years.   Good luck!"

Because the optical drive is SATA II vs the primary slot's SATA III connection. You'll get better speed out of your SSD where previously SATA II was bottlenecking it.

osx,3a0gtv,le_Dandy_Boatswain,3,Tue Jun 16 11:19:17 2015 UTC,"The file system is somewhat like Linux, I'm using OSX for development more recently and I'm sort of getting used to it, Linux still makes more sense to me though, but just like installing dev tools is useful I find.   If you've not found it yet, look into Homebrew, it's a package manager. Not quite as vital as apt-get is to a Debian OS or as big, but very good nonetheless."
osx,3a0gtv,Tsiklon,2,Tue Jun 16 21:38:41 2015 UTC,"But otherwise, I see that many things differ completely from a usual debian distro, like kexts   .kexts are loadable kernel modules, and are functionally equivalent to .ko files in Linux/BSD. The names of the utilites to manage them are specific to OSX, but act similarly to their *nix counterparts. e.g. kextutil works similar to modprobe, kextstat works similar to lsmod etc.   the filesystem tree   Some of it will be familiar, and some is specific to OSX. /usr, /bin, /sbin /etc  etc. are present, and are used for the Unix command line stuff as expected. Folders like /Applications, /System, /Library are OS X specific.   It's also worth noting that OS X has no sysv init system. launchctl is used similarly to the ""service"" command, but there isn't really an equivilant to invoking init scripts directly to control services. OS X uses .plist files (xml format) to configure which services are ran on the system. I forget their exact location, but they are found throughout the /system and /library directories.   apt-get   There is no built in equivalent, but homebrew is an awesome third party solution to provide a package manager that will be familiar for a linux user. I highly recommend it!   grub, etc.   Once again, no direct comparison, OS X has some sort of proprietary booting scheme that is not accessible by the user AFAIK."
osx,3a0gtv,1337Gandalf,2,Tue Jun 16 21:54:39 2015 UTC,Launchctl was used as an inspiration for the systemd project as Launchctl wasn't available under a favourable license at the time (it is now)  OS X boots using a regular EFI program like Linux or windows. It's just in an unusual part of the file system(boot.efi is somewhere deep in the /system folder on both the recovery partition [for filevault 2+ encrypted systems]and the main root partition) the EFI of the machine has a built in HFS+ driver to enable it to read from those filesystems without loading an OS. The process is interesting because the damn thing won't boot unless the EFI reports a known model number to it (hence the boot loader is a main holdup on hackintosh systems)

In example, as a recent addition PeaZip rolled out a plug-in to handle new rar5 files, as WinRar authors decided to update the rar standard, breaking the compatibility with most 3rd party unrar utilities including 7-Zip. Anyway, both 7-Zip and PeaZip should have no problem in running with Wine for OSX, or programs as WinBottler and Wineskin that makes the process to re-pack Windows apps for Mac even simpler."

Another option is to use cloud storage whether it's iCloud Drive, Dropbox or Google Drive. It's the same procedure- locate the file, bring up the Share Sheet and in the bottom portion of the sheet you should find the option to ""Open in.."".  From there choose the iPhone/iPad  app you want to open the file in.

osx,39w0fs,ASK_ME_IF_IM_WALKEN,12,Mon Jun 15 06:41:12 2015 UTC,"That's a kernel panic. The fact that you can boot into safe mode suggests it's caused by an incompatibility with a 3rd party kernel extension that you have on your computer. Safe mode disables 3rd party kernel extensions.  When 10.11 officially comes out, most likely you will have this problem again unless whoever made that kernel extension pushes an update to you to fix this problem before you install 10.11.  As for which 3rd party kernel... well it's right there in the backtrace of your kernel panic: com.ManyCamLLC.videodevlce.driver  That means the software is made by a company called ""ManyCamLLC"" and the kernel extension is videodevice.driver.  You can get around this by removing it. It would either be in /System/Library/Extensions (but it's hard to say what it would be named) or it would be loaded by a launch daemon or launch agent. Those are in /Library/LaunchDaemons and /Library/LaunchAgents respectively.  /System/Library/Extensions is full of stuff that's supposed to be there, so you have to be careful with what you pull from that. If you end up accidentally pulling something from there that you're supposed to leave in there, and your computer stops booting properly after you do that, you can reinstall the OS and the correct extensions will be reinstalled.  The LaunchDaemons and LaunchAgents folders are empty by default. They will only contain things installed by 3rd party developers from when you installed their software. Pulling everything in those folders will not do any harm to your computer, though they could affect some of the 3rd party software you use.  After you've pulled whatever you need to pull, restart the computer back into normal mode and see if it works.  EDIT  Okay, so I found this on the web. I suspected this is what you had, so I went ahead and installed it on my own system.  First of all, mine ran a kernel extension called ""com.visicom.ManyCam.VideoDevice.driver"" which is different from the kernel extension you're running. Perhaps these are not the same product, but I suspect they are and you have an older version of it from before they were bought by Visicom Media. If you want to keep ManyCam, then it's possible this problem may go away if you update the software to the latest version. Perhaps they've long since fixed the problem already.  Secondly, mine did not install anything in /System/Library/Extensions or /Library/LaunchAgents. It loads it's kernel extension by using a launch daemon, which is in /Library/LaunchDaemons. On my system, I found com.visicom.ManyCam.VideoDevice.daemon.plist in that folder. If you find something similar in there, move that to the trash and try rebooting.  But a better alternative may just be to run the uninstaller. I found a ManyCam uninstaller in /Applications/ManyCam on my system. I think this is your best option."
