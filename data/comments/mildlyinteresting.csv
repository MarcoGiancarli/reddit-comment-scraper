We always got weird requests from customers such as picking up a movie from the video store.  Or running through Taco Bell for them.  Or bringing them a sixer of Bud or a pack of smokes.  I usually did whatever they asked because they almost always tipped really well if I did."
mildlyinteresting,3e1fpy,FairlyAwkward,3,Tue Jul 21 13:49:46 2015 UTC,"I used to live about a mile and a half inland from a beach with a pretty vibrant night scene. There was a pizza place there where, instead of charging a flat delivery fee or having an order minimum, they just added a small amount onto each item if you wanted it to be delivered versus picking it up. One night a friend and I were tipsy and about to either walk or cab it back to my place (it was up a hill), when we had a semi-stroke of genius. A pizza would cost us $5. A delivery pizza would cost us $5.65. We asked if we could be ""delivered"" to my house alongside the pizza, and after some consideration, they said yes!    The ride itself was anticlimactic, but the pizza was good (and we tipped him well)."
mildlyinteresting,3e1fpy,smelly_me,18,Tue Jul 21 17:31:06 2015 UTC,"Actually, Blockbuster tried this in a few pilot stores in Dallas back in the late 90's early 2000's. It seems like a no brainer, but people weren't really interested in getting pizza from their rental stores. I believe if you ordered a pizza you could get a movie with it as well, but one of the main advantages of the Blockbuster store was the ability to browse the shelves, and people weren't particularly interested in giving that up. Compounding the issue was that Blockbuster didn't partner with an established chain for the pilot, but instead created their own pizza places which were honestly pretty crappy from what I heard."
mildlyinteresting,3e1fpy,VorpalMonkey,8,Tue Jul 21 14:28:10 2015 UTC,"I think Marco's Pizza is owned by Family Video or their parent company, or whatever - I know a couple years ago I interviewed for a GM position at a Marco's and the interview was conducted with the Family Video regional manager, so they sure seem related.

mildlyinteresting,3e1fpy,MrSlyMe,96,Tue Jul 21 13:15:24 2015 UTC,Most pizza places have a 'no riders allowed' rule to avoid people doing this.  Sounds pretty dangerous for the driver.

This helps them to tear the flesh into smaller, more conveniently-sized fragments, and serves as a cache so that the shrike can return to the uneaten portions at a later time. This same behavior of impaling insects serves as an adaptation to eating the toxic lubber grasshopper, Romalea guttata.

And I'll watch it fly away, unable to properly orient itself in flight, and I watch with an intense sense of satisfaction (fully torqued I might add) knowing that it will be completely incapable of grabbing onto anything, and after possibly hours of landing on things only to fall off onto the ground, it'll eventually accept its death and the stupid fuck will just lay there, helpless, and it'll fucking die.

She had seen the movie,  Psycho years before and had a real phobia of taking showers. She had this done so she could see the whole room while in the shower.  A couple side notes: when people came over and used that bathroom they always laughed at the idea of watching yourself poop. But growing up with it, I never really noticed my self.  A couple years ago she had a plumber doing some work in there and he broke one of the big mirrors (she originally had to have the door frame and a wall removed to get the mirrors in there) and decided it wasn't worth the time, effort or money to have it replaced, so it looks like a normal bathroom now,  except she had the shower removed and had a claw foot bath tub put into its place."

Everytime light passes through glass, more and more green light gets reflected/passed through over every other color. Eventually this shows to us as a green tint in the light.  Because mirrors are a glass pane on top of a silver backing, the light travels through the glass first before being reflected by the silver (and back through the glass again), causing it to turn slightly green. Repeat this many times and you get a noticeable effect on color."
mildlyinteresting,3dyr5a,drunkeskimo,4,Tue Jul 21 00:37:28 2015 UTC,"instead of having the silvering beneath a layer of glass, it is on the surface (or has a much thinner layer of glass)"

mildlyinteresting,3e2fvt,AlternativelyYouCan,4,Tue Jul 21 13:10:13 2015 UTC,What's a tank?
mildlyinteresting,3e2fvt,threkar,5,Tue Jul 21 13:51:32 2015 UTC,This is. The thing on top that spins around and has the gun attached to it is called a turret. Notice on the tank how the turret doesn't extend past the back of the main body. In OP's picture notice how there is a support holding the barrel up. Artillery guns are very big and heavy and need those supports when stored/transported (puts less stress on the rest of the gun).
mildlyinteresting,3e2fvt,AlternativelyYouCan,3,Tue Jul 21 13:59:10 2015 UTC,"A tank has heavier armor and is designed to fire in a flatter trajectory, they are typically used with infantry support or to kill other tanks. They are front-line units designed to absorb more incoming fire and shoot at things they can see.   A self-propelled artillery unit has lighter armor that is good against small-arms fire but not designed to go into battle with tanks or anti-armor weapons.  They fire a high, lobbing trajectory to bombard enemy positions miles away.  The reason for the self-propelled units is so the tanks and infantry don't out-run their artillery support - now the artillery can keep up with a fast-moving front line without wasting time hooking up trucks and such."

mildlyinteresting,3dxb4o,EnigmaNL,17,Mon Jul 20 13:52:44 2015 UTC,Yeah this is what I was wondering. Floating in the ocean for 70+ years must have some sort of negative effect on explosives.
mildlyinteresting,3dxb4o,ner0417,38,Mon Jul 20 13:57:32 2015 UTC,"The idea is that subjecting them to the shock wave of the other explosion will detonate anything that's left to detonate.  Sometimes they go off and sometimes they don't.  But if they don't, what's left is safe to handle and can be considered non explosive.  There's still plenty of WWII stuff that can explode though.  Some of the explosives used can become more sensitive instead of less, which is risky."
mildlyinteresting,3dxb4o,Ghigs,6,Mon Jul 20 15:11:39 2015 UTC,"Most older types of ordnance used TNT as their main source of explosions.  TNT just gets more powerful and less stable with age.  EOD will simply use C4 to detonate the older explosives because the charge of C4 can be shaped to explode in certain directions.  C4 is now the primary explosive agent used today because it's far more stable.  You can set it on fire and it just burns slowly and it's better for cutting.  TNT just goes off in every direction and can be set off by any number of accidental means; temperature, atmosphere, mishandling etc."

mildlyinteresting,3dxb4o,PM_Me_Stuff_Please_,15,Mon Jul 20 15:35:31 2015 UTC,"There are mines in Belgium that were dug in WW1 that had tens of TONS of explosives each buried under German lines in anticipation of an assault.  1,000,000lbs of explosives were used in 25 mine sites, placed by engineers from the Royal Engineers, the 1st Australian Tunneling Company and others after successful tests as early as 1915. On June 7 1917, nineteen of the twenty-five mines went off. The explosions were heard from Downing Street.  That still leaves six. One rests under a barn near the farmhouse of Roger Mahieu's La Basse Cour, which was lost when German forces detected the mine being dug and mounted a counter-operation. 50,000lbs of explosives remain there, a mere 80ft below ground.  Four other mines were not used and remained documented after the British forces took the trench-line they were mining. One of them was supposedly set off by a lightning strike in 1955.  Don't buy farmland in Belgium.  EDIT: Peckham supposedly went off already. Might look this up properly after some more sleep.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIr9ELKSuxQ"

The fact that it was an anti-tank mine was what kept us from setting it off.  We weren't heavy enough.    Also, during the war, as the battle moved back and forth, the Japanese would have their munitions in trenches.  When they knew the US forces would over-run their position, they'd fill in the trench.  One, because the shells were too heavy to move quickly, and two, because the hope was to regain the position and have shells already there.  Problem was the position was either never retaken, or those that knew the location died.  Fast forward to current times when construction equipment hits one of those trenches.  There's a reason bulldozers are so massively overbuilt on Okinawa....at least they used to be."

mildlyinteresting,3dxb4o,Im-Indian,2,Mon Jul 20 15:32:00 2015 UTC,"Because some of our faculty had family from Okinawa during the war, and the fact that one of my schools is a little weird, we have regular assemblies talking about why war is bad, usually involving stories from the invasion of Okinawa. Now, I have an issue with some of the factualness of a few of their points, but learning more and more about the battles taught there, it's crazy how much the people there took a beating from the Americans. Like, brutal attacks and straight up slaughter in a few cases.   Also, those assemblies are super awkward as an American. Luckily they are usually more centered on ""this is why WAR is bad,"" but it's still weird to be there when talking about American bombers and the like razing entire towns."

Each life lost is precious and the loss a waste.  What I'm about to say is a matter of logistics vs. today's news media.  That being said, this is why I get a bit irritated with the news media going bonkers over the middle east numbers.  We've managed to limit (US) losses to less than 5000 over, 10+ years, over multiple theaters of operation.  Okinawa was just one objective, in one theater of operation.  Imagine if Iraq alone had been 100,000 plus losses.  Then the news media's hype would better match the reality.    EDIT:  wording"
mildlyinteresting,3dxb4o,eldergeekprime,12,Mon Jul 20 16:21:00 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason numbers get thrown around despite being ""low"" (relative to the most deadly war in human history, apparently) is that unlike WWII, Iraq was a completely unnecessary war of choice, sold to the public based on lies, and so badly mismanaged post-invasion that you scarcely could have done a worse job if you had been deliberately trying to fubar it.   The ""acceptable"" number of losses in Iraq is 0."

mildlyinteresting,3dxb4o,FGHIK,6,Mon Jul 20 16:39:28 2015 UTC,"Just remember that there were a lot of Marines stationed there immediately after WW2 and still are.  My guess is that button is from a Dress Blue uniform. The Service uniform buttons (the one I showed), as far as I know, have always been issued with dark buttons that would not tarnish like that. The Dress Blue uniforms have the bright buttons (anodized now, used to be copper/bronze/brass). It's probably a copper or high copper-content metal button from before anodized buttons/medals were popular which would put it sometime in the 1970s or earlier.   Could have been a USMC Birthday party on the beach (those can get ruckus)."

When I was a kid (this was in the 80s) my dad and a couple of uncles dug up dozens of live, heavily corroded (see below) .50 cal bullets from a plane crash site behind my grandfather's house. In 1945 a Navy F4U Corsair had crashed due to mechanical issues. It was swampy at the time and the aircraft pretty much buried itself on impact. The pilot was rescued (I believe he bailed out), and sensitive items were recovered but most of the plane was left as it fell. I remember my great grandfather re-burying those rounds.  (Edit: Actually after thinking a bit further about this I remembered them not being very heavily corroded at all... which is why they continued to dig them up - which prompted my great grandfather to take them all and re-bury them)"

Edit: It could be a 7.7"
mildlyinteresting,3dxb4o,pukucho,12,Mon Jul 20 18:45:54 2015 UTC,"I was stationed on Okinawa in 1980-81.  I was in 2/1 (Second Battalion, First Marines) attached to the Third Marine Division, which is permanently stationed at Camp Schwab on Okinawa.  (This is known as being ""forward deployed.""  If war breaks out in the western Pacific, the Third Mar Div will be the first to go.)  I really didn't like being on Okinawa much.  They had open sewers, untreated sewage going straight into the Pacific, super aggressive cops (the Jay-Pees--Japanese Police) who delighted in beating the hell out of drunk Marines, a very active Mafia-type organization that operated among the bars and clubs, and the civilian population had a very high percentage of Communists and Communist sympathizers who demonstrated outside the base every time some little thing happened politically.  Drinks were expensive and the booze was questionable.  I once observed a bartender at the Club Okinawa in Kin Ville lining up various types of whisky bottles and re-filling them from a three liter bottle of ""Untory"" scotch.  That's an awful long way from Scotland--bootleg, ""Japanese"" scotch made in Malaysia! It is a rough hewn society.  It reminds me a lot of a Third World country.  There is a very large contingent of outcasts on Okinawa who are mixed-race descendants of Japanese prostitutes and American G.I.'s.  They are totally hated and despised by the local Okinawans and are treated far worse than any racism in the present U.S.  I saw Japanese cops beating Eurasian hookers on the street with billy clubs, and I saw a Okinawan spit on a blonde Eurasian girl on a bus stop.  The Eurasian girl was clearly dressed in her ""streetwalking"" clothes, and wasn't unattractive, but her teeth were rotting out of her head. It is absolutely forbidden for American G.I.'s (who are mostly 18 or 19 years old) to even speak to an Okinawan girl.  The locals go crazy if they see some young Marine trying to strike up a conversation with a Japanese girl, and the girls shy away from the American boys like they have leprosy or something.  Things may have changed on Okinawa since 1980, I don't know, but it was unpleasant being there back then.  The Battle of Okinawa lasted 82 days, and was one of the bloodiest in the Pacific. Japan lost about 80,000 soldiers, who were either killed or committed hari-kari, and the Allies lost about 14,000 soldiers, sailors and Marines, and took about 65,000 casualties of various kinds.  Also, 150,000 Okinawan civilians  were killed or committed suicide.  The ""Okinawa Maidens"" are still mourned there--several thousand Okinawan teenaged girls and young women who threw themselves off a cliff into the sea rather than be captured by the Americans alive.   The Okinawans have a similar feeling about the Okinawa Maidens as Americans do about the people who jumped to their deaths from the World Trade Center in New York City.  It just engenders a very deep seated animosity towards the people who caused it. (The Japanese authorities had told the civilians that the Americans would conduct a mass rape if the invasion was successful, and the girls killed themselves rather than risk being captured.)  When we dropped the Bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and when the Russians invaded Manchuria, Japan surrendered a couple of months months after the end of the fighting on Okinawa.  It was estimated that it would have cost at least a million American casualties to take Mainland Japan, based on the losses at Okinawa.  The ferocious resistance on Okinawa greatly influenced the decision to drop the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki."
mildlyinteresting,3dxb4o,Chipchipcherryo,5,Mon Jul 20 17:07:33 2015 UTC,"A lot has changed.  The Okinawa people are some of the friendliest, most peaceful folks I've ever met.  They even have a yearly Peace, Love, Rock festival.  Many local girls hook up with GIs, most of my Oki friends thought nothing of it, though some of the older folks would throw out the stink eye when they saw it.  Booze is still hella expensive but I've never gotten bad booze.  We had a booze ban and lock down for mylast year there' because a couple of ass hat sailors raped a Japanese girl.  My American friends were just as pissed as my Oki friends and fully supported those protests.  But we did hate the booze ban, it was still in effect when I left.   They still love to protest, but are the nicest protestors ever.  As I would pull up to the gate it was pretty normal to get a smile and bow along with the vigorous waving of whatever sign they were holding (mostly 'No Osprey' when I was there, which I actually agreed with,  they didn't have a great track record ATT).  I'm mixed race Korean and was generally treated well, as opposed to Korea where I've been chased off the train by drunk old Adashiis a couple of times.  I had a great group of friends there and we spent a lot of time exploring that beautiful little island.  The locals, even the ones in the more remote North, were always nice as long as we were polite and showed a genuine interest in their culture.    The infrastructure has changed significantly.   They are very much a population engaged in recycling and keeping their island clean.  You may never get back there but if you have the chance, give it a try.  I treasure the time I spent there."

Yes, surprisingly, things can change in the space of 35 years!  Also,  I think the negative experience you received can be drawn from the fact that there were 20,000 foreign soldiers across several bases on a small island. If you want to talk about 'engendering a very deep seated animosity' then I think stationing tens of thousands of soldiers decades after WW2 may fan those flames.  Onto your history lesson: Very few, if any, acccounts of hara-kiri (not hari-kari). The way out was usually by grenades, shot or falling. The mass suicides in Okinawa are actually blamed by Okinawans on the mainland Japanese government, as it was their intentions to leave nothing and no one for the Americans on Okinawa.   A hearty attempt at a history lesson though, I'll give you that."

mildlyinteresting,3dxb4o,invisiblette,7,Mon Jul 20 18:11:22 2015 UTC,I'm betting that's some old 5.56 brass from the 90's and someone lost a piece of their dress Blues brass button from the front of their uniform.  I'm thinking salt water would have corroded anything that small into nothing from WWII.  The button is definitely not from WWII.  Nobody wore their dress uniforms onto the beach during the attack.  Most likely somebody swapped out the brass buttons for anodized buttons and just tossed them.  I was stationed in Camp Schwab and the only artifacts people really ever find are the old Japanese machine gun nests.  Edit.  That round is possibly not 5.56 but the top of the brass seems to taper and it's been too corroded to tell without more photos.
mildlyinteresting,3dxb4o,LeDispute,5,Mon Jul 20 17:13:06 2015 UTC,That doesn't look like 5.56 at all. The rim isn't steep enough and there is a complete lacking in a bottleneck. It's most probably .30 Carbine.

mildlyinteresting,3dxb4o,drof69,46,Mon Jul 20 16:08:11 2015 UTC,Generally they use other explosives to set off the old bombs. Old bombs will still have explosives inside but the fuses are often unreliable or they don't work anymore.
mildlyinteresting,3dxb4o,EnigmaNL,17,Mon Jul 20 13:52:44 2015 UTC,Yeah this is what I was wondering. Floating in the ocean for 70+ years must have some sort of negative effect on explosives.
mildlyinteresting,3dxb4o,ner0417,38,Mon Jul 20 13:57:32 2015 UTC,"The idea is that subjecting them to the shock wave of the other explosion will detonate anything that's left to detonate.  Sometimes they go off and sometimes they don't.  But if they don't, what's left is safe to handle and can be considered non explosive.  There's still plenty of WWII stuff that can explode though.  Some of the explosives used can become more sensitive instead of less, which is risky."
mildlyinteresting,3dxb4o,Ghigs,6,Mon Jul 20 15:11:39 2015 UTC,"Most older types of ordnance used TNT as their main source of explosions.  TNT just gets more powerful and less stable with age.  EOD will simply use C4 to detonate the older explosives because the charge of C4 can be shaped to explode in certain directions.  C4 is now the primary explosive agent used today because it's far more stable.  You can set it on fire and it just burns slowly and it's better for cutting.  TNT just goes off in every direction and can be set off by any number of accidental means; temperature, atmosphere, mishandling etc."

mildlyinteresting,3dxb4o,PM_Me_Stuff_Please_,15,Mon Jul 20 15:35:31 2015 UTC,"There are mines in Belgium that were dug in WW1 that had tens of TONS of explosives each buried under German lines in anticipation of an assault.  1,000,000lbs of explosives were used in 25 mine sites, placed by engineers from the Royal Engineers, the 1st Australian Tunneling Company and others after successful tests as early as 1915. On June 7 1917, nineteen of the twenty-five mines went off. The explosions were heard from Downing Street.  That still leaves six. One rests under a barn near the farmhouse of Roger Mahieu's La Basse Cour, which was lost when German forces detected the mine being dug and mounted a counter-operation. 50,000lbs of explosives remain there, a mere 80ft below ground.  Four other mines were not used and remained documented after the British forces took the trench-line they were mining. One of them was supposedly set off by a lightning strike in 1955.  Don't buy farmland in Belgium.  EDIT: Peckham supposedly went off already. Might look this up properly after some more sleep.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIr9ELKSuxQ"

The fact that it was an anti-tank mine was what kept us from setting it off.  We weren't heavy enough.    Also, during the war, as the battle moved back and forth, the Japanese would have their munitions in trenches.  When they knew the US forces would over-run their position, they'd fill in the trench.  One, because the shells were too heavy to move quickly, and two, because the hope was to regain the position and have shells already there.  Problem was the position was either never retaken, or those that knew the location died.  Fast forward to current times when construction equipment hits one of those trenches.  There's a reason bulldozers are so massively overbuilt on Okinawa....at least they used to be."

mildlyinteresting,3dxb4o,FGHIK,49,Mon Jul 20 19:12:16 2015 UTC,I was stationed at Camp Schwab for a while in 2004. A buddy of mine found a half buried helmet with a bullet hole in it while walking through the woods. It was a U.S. Helmet unfortunately. It's sad either way though. We are on much better terms with Japan now. We hung out with Japanese army guys and partied with them at the E Club in Camp Fuji a few times. Cool dudes. It was weird thinking that 60 years earlier we would have been fighting each other very brutally...

The whole ""Marine raped a girl"" scandal was still fresh on everyone's minds back then.  I was with 1/7 Alpha co.  On top of that scandal our unit was training in the NWTC (not sure if it's still called that).  So we pull up in 5 tons into a field and start getting lined out in formation.  The borders between the NWTC and common civilian property weren't marked in any way whatsoever.  Well it turned out we had pulled up with the 5 tons and Hummers into an active sugar cane field.  Can we say ""international incident""?  The next thing we know there are hundreds of protesters, news crews, and suddenly we're packing up to head back to Schwab.  The battalion had to go through a class with this PR agent of the Marines to not talk about it.  The battalion was remanded to ""Cinderalla Liberty.""

Like, brutal attacks and straight up slaughter in a few cases.   Also, those assemblies are super awkward as an American.

We've managed to limit (US) losses to less than 5000 over, 10+ years, over multiple theaters of operation.  Okinawa was just one objective, in one theater of operation.  Imagine if Iraq alone had been 100,000 plus losses.  Then the news media's hype would better match the reality.    EDIT:  wording"
mildlyinteresting,3dxb4o,eldergeekprime,12,Mon Jul 20 16:21:00 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason numbers get thrown around despite being ""low"" (relative to the most deadly war in human history, apparently) is that unlike WWII, Iraq was a completely unnecessary war of choice, sold to the public based on lies, and so badly mismanaged post-invasion that you scarcely could have done a worse job if you had been deliberately trying to fubar it.   The ""acceptable"" number of losses in Iraq is 0."

mildlyinteresting,3dxb4o,FGHIK,6,Mon Jul 20 16:39:28 2015 UTC,"Just remember that there were a lot of Marines stationed there immediately after WW2 and still are.  My guess is that button is from a Dress Blue uniform. The Service uniform buttons (the one I showed), as far as I know, have always been issued with dark buttons that would not tarnish like that. The Dress Blue uniforms have the bright buttons (anodized now, used to be copper/bronze/brass). It's probably a copper or high copper-content metal button from before anodized buttons/medals were popular which would put it sometime in the 1970s or earlier.   Could have been a USMC Birthday party on the beach (those can get ruckus)."

The pilot was rescued (I believe he bailed out), and sensitive items were recovered but most of the plane was left as it fell. I remember my great grandfather re-burying those rounds.

mildlyinteresting,3dxb4o,pukucho,12,Mon Jul 20 18:45:54 2015 UTC,"I was stationed on Okinawa in 1980-81.  I was in 2/1 (Second Battalion, First Marines) attached to the Third Marine Division, which is permanently stationed at Camp Schwab on Okinawa.  (This is known as being ""forward deployed.""  If war breaks out in the western Pacific, the Third Mar Div will be the first to go.)  I really didn't like being on Okinawa much.  They had open sewers, untreated sewage going straight into the Pacific, super aggressive cops (the Jay-Pees--Japanese Police) who delighted in beating the hell out of drunk Marines, a very active Mafia-type organization that operated among the bars and clubs, and the civilian population had a very high percentage of Communists and Communist sympathizers who demonstrated outside the base every time some little thing happened politically.  Drinks were expensive and the booze was questionable.  I once observed a bartender at the Club Okinawa in Kin Ville lining up various types of whisky bottles and re-filling them from a three liter bottle of ""Untory"" scotch.  That's an awful long way from Scotland--bootleg, ""Japanese"" scotch made in Malaysia! It is a rough hewn society.  It reminds me a lot of a Third World country.  There is a very large contingent of outcasts on Okinawa who are mixed-race descendants of Japanese prostitutes and American G.I.'s.  They are totally hated and despised by the local Okinawans and are treated far worse than any racism in the present U.S.  I saw Japanese cops beating Eurasian hookers on the street with billy clubs, and I saw a Okinawan spit on a blonde Eurasian girl on a bus stop.  The Eurasian girl was clearly dressed in her ""streetwalking"" clothes, and wasn't unattractive, but her teeth were rotting out of her head. It is absolutely forbidden for American G.I.'s (who are mostly 18 or 19 years old) to even speak to an Okinawan girl.  The locals go crazy if they see some young Marine trying to strike up a conversation with a Japanese girl, and the girls shy away from the American boys like they have leprosy or something.  Things may have changed on Okinawa since 1980, I don't know, but it was unpleasant being there back then.  The Battle of Okinawa lasted 82 days, and was one of the bloodiest in the Pacific. Japan lost about 80,000 soldiers, who were either killed or committed hari-kari, and the Allies lost about 14,000 soldiers, sailors and Marines, and took about 65,000 casualties of various kinds.  Also, 150,000 Okinawan civilians  were killed or committed suicide.  The ""Okinawa Maidens"" are still mourned there--several thousand Okinawan teenaged girls and young women who threw themselves off a cliff into the sea rather than be captured by the Americans alive.   The Okinawans have a similar feeling about the Okinawa Maidens as Americans do about the people who jumped to their deaths from the World Trade Center in New York City.  It just engenders a very deep seated animosity towards the people who caused it. (The Japanese authorities had told the civilians that the Americans would conduct a mass rape if the invasion was successful, and the girls killed themselves rather than risk being captured.)  When we dropped the Bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and when the Russians invaded Manchuria, Japan surrendered a couple of months months after the end of the fighting on Okinawa.  It was estimated that it would have cost at least a million American casualties to take Mainland Japan, based on the losses at Okinawa.  The ferocious resistance on Okinawa greatly influenced the decision to drop the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki."
mildlyinteresting,3dxb4o,Chipchipcherryo,5,Mon Jul 20 17:07:33 2015 UTC,"A lot has changed.  The Okinawa people are some of the friendliest, most peaceful folks I've ever met.  They even have a yearly Peace, Love, Rock festival.  Many local girls hook up with GIs, most of my Oki friends thought nothing of it, though some of the older folks would throw out the stink eye when they saw it.  Booze is still hella expensive but I've never gotten bad booze.  We had a booze ban and lock down for mylast year there' because a couple of ass hat sailors raped a Japanese girl.  My American friends were just as pissed as my Oki friends and fully supported those protests.  But we did hate the booze ban, it was still in effect when I left.   They still love to protest, but are the nicest protestors ever.  As I would pull up to the gate it was pretty normal to get a smile and bow along with the vigorous waving of whatever sign they were holding (mostly 'No Osprey' when I was there, which I actually agreed with,  they didn't have a great track record ATT).  I'm mixed race Korean and was generally treated well, as opposed to Korea where I've been chased off the train by drunk old Adashiis a couple of times.  I had a great group of friends there and we spent a lot of time exploring that beautiful little island.  The locals, even the ones in the more remote North, were always nice as long as we were polite and showed a genuine interest in their culture.    The infrastructure has changed significantly.   They are very much a population engaged in recycling and keeping their island clean.  You may never get back there but if you have the chance, give it a try.  I treasure the time I spent there."

Yes, surprisingly, things can change in the space of 35 years!  Also,  I think the negative experience you received can be drawn from the fact that there were 20,000 foreign soldiers across several bases on a small island. If you want to talk about 'engendering a very deep seated animosity' then I think stationing tens of thousands of soldiers decades after WW2 may fan those flames.  Onto your history lesson: Very few, if any, acccounts of hara-kiri (not hari-kari). The way out was usually by grenades, shot or falling. The mass suicides in Okinawa are actually blamed by Okinawans on the mainland Japanese government, as it was their intentions to leave nothing and no one for the Americans on Okinawa.   A hearty attempt at a history lesson though, I'll give you that."

mildlyinteresting,3dxb4o,invisiblette,7,Mon Jul 20 18:11:22 2015 UTC,I'm betting that's some old 5.56 brass from the 90's and someone lost a piece of their dress Blues brass button from the front of their uniform.  I'm thinking salt water would have corroded anything that small into nothing from WWII.  The button is definitely not from WWII.  Nobody wore their dress uniforms onto the beach during the attack.  Most likely somebody swapped out the brass buttons for anodized buttons and just tossed them.  I was stationed in Camp Schwab and the only artifacts people really ever find are the old Japanese machine gun nests.  Edit.  That round is possibly not 5.56 but the top of the brass seems to taper and it's been too corroded to tell without more photos.
mildlyinteresting,3dxb4o,LeDispute,5,Mon Jul 20 17:13:06 2015 UTC,That doesn't look like 5.56 at all. The rim isn't steep enough and there is a complete lacking in a bottleneck. It's most probably .30 Carbine.

mildlyinteresting,3e001d,drthaller,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:16:05 2015 UTC,They sell self-adhesive lamenating sheets that grease pencils and wet erase markers work well on. The only issue being a small amount of gunk building up on the outer edge where it sticks to.
mildlyinteresting,3e001d,DeathTheGrim,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:41:53 2015 UTC,Personally I'm not a fan of the stick on whiteboards as I find them difficult to write on. A whiteboard is a much better investment too as it will last for years and can be re-written on 100s of times.
mildlyinteresting,3e001d,jeffispro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:53:35 2015 UTC,"You actually have a couple more options. You can get two part whiteboard paint that makes a real white board surface out of anything.  You can also get appliance enamel which works 'close enough' and it more durable, and more easily reapplied.    The strength or weakness of anything on your wall is that it is on your wall.

These are facing the opposite direction of the one you are probably used to (thanks to the Nazis), but both orientations are swastikas.  Edit: Some people apparently think I'm wrong.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika   The swastika (also known as the gammadion cross, cross cramponnée, or manji) (as a Chinese character: 卐 or 卍) is a symbol that generally takes the form of an equilateral cross, with its four legs bent at 90 degrees.  ...  Geometrically, the swastika can be regarded as an irregular icosagon or 20-sided polygon. The proportions of the Nazi swastika were fixed based on a 5 × 5 diagonal grid.  Characteristic is the 90° rotational symmetry and chirality, hence the absence of reflectional symmetry, and the existence of two versions of swastikas that are each other's mirror image.  A right-facing swastika might be described as ""clockwise"" or ""counter-clockwise"". The mirror-image forms are often described as:  clockwise (卍) and counterclockwise (卐); left-facing (卍) and right-facing (卐); left-hand (卍) and right-hand (卐)."

mildlyinteresting,3e1mlo,Starter-for-Ten,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:02:14 2015 UTC,"If that is the camera that fired an off camera flash, the shutter speed was too high. Image plane shutters are essentially 2 sheets of metal (or cloth on old cameras) that form a slit between them. Adjusting the gap between them determines the exposure time. At speeds faster than 1/250th of a second or so (depends on the camera), the distance between the two sheets is smaller than the height of the image sensor (or film), so the entire thing is not exposed at the same time - a slit (yours is about half the size of the image) travels over the sensor, exposing just that much as it moves.   Since strobes and speedlights (camera flashes) are much quicker in duration than the time it takes for the shutter to move - fast enough to be considered nearly instantaneous - the light is only ""on"" when the slit is open above that part of the image. For most cameras, it's at the beginning of the exposure, but on some you can set it to go off at the end (for other reasons that don't matter here).   If it wasn't the camera that made this image that triggered the flash, the same exact thing happened - but just happened to take the picture at the same time the other photographer's flash went off. Given the short duration of the flash, that's a pretty big coincidence."

mildlyinteresting,3dxyji,M-Thing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:27:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I do it because I read it in a book :/  Bees communicate largely by smells (chemicals, pheromones, what-have-you). Supposedly, the Queen's attendants give off the smell of a rival hive and can induce a defense response in the target colony.  The bees will kill the invaders without giving the Queen a chance to 'win them over'.    What you do is to put the Queen cage in the hive for a couple of days still sealed up. THis gives the new colony a chance to realize they need a Queen, and that lo and behold, here one is!    TLDR: Killing the attendants (supposedly) gives the Queen a much higher chance of acceptance within the new hive."
