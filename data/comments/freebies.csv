Cut down on packaged/canned foods, cut down on fast foods, cut down on how much salt you throw into your food when you do cook.  Don't cut it out of your life completely, but cut it down.

freebies,3e18lu,imdinni,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:25:35 2015 UTC,Was on front page a few months ago. If you want double meat wait for them to put* initial scoop on there and then ask for double meat. If you ask for double off the bat you'll get only like 1.5-1.75 times the meat.   Really?

freebies,3du3gn,Shimunogora,3,Mon Jul 20 03:27:58 2015 UTC,"In epidemiological circles the evidence is overwhelming that sugar-sweetened beverages raise risk for obesity, type 2 diabetes, and (very likely) a host of other chronic diseases, cardiovascular disease among them. Practically I've seen people going from a 12-can soda habit per day to half of that or (better yet), zero, drop ridiculous amounts of weight. Biomarkers of chronic disease (blood glucose, A1C, lipids) usually drift downward in tandem, too.  As soda taxes go, the analogy is cigarettes. You raise the price of cigarettes, and use proportionally falls. This is pretty well documented nationally and across multiple countries. Now the counterargument is that soda isn't cigarettes, and that is certainly true - to a point. Where the analogy breaks down is that sugar-sweetened beverages are not the sole contributor to increased risk of chronic disease. It is certainly harder to implicate them alone. Rather, processed food across the board, compounded by social and economic factors are to blame. And this is where it gets messy.  You certainly can't tax these classes of foods across the board without it being regressive, but sugar-sweetened beverages are a class of food for which the value is purely hedonistic and for which there are plenty of alternatives (like water). So it's a good target, from a public health perspective. Research is still emerging on the impacts of such taxes, and Mexico is a huge ongoing experiment, as is the Navajo nation. The Rudd Center (for Food Policy and Obesity) has done extensive research on soda taxation, and it is one of the initiatives they advocate for.  This post has gone OT, but I think it is perfectly consistent to disapprove of what is a cheap positive publicity grab by Coke and Kroger; while at the same time expressing appreciation for the challenges military folks endure.    /u/madcowdisease has a somewhat mildly popular opinion.  It'd be a good PR move at the end of this campaign to say ""look we're matching your donation and sending double"" or something like that. I agree that they should just donate, since wom from soldiers would be pretty good anyway, but I'm sure there are people who really love seeing things like this and having a personal connection to it. Plus, if it becomes more commonplace, I'm sure a lot of soldiers would appreciate care packages with treats and things that remind them of home.  tl;dr, just click the damn link, it's not like people don't already know about the brand anyway"

Assuming one click takes one second if someone runs the script for an entire week that's 604800 clicks or seconds according to Google. A drink is probably 12 Oz so multiply that by the seconds and you'll end up with over a 7 million ounces.   And that's only one instance running for a week at the rate of 1 second. The script can be made to click evey millisecond or 1/1000th of a second. Multiply that with say x number of scripts clicking at the same time and I'm sure it'll and it with more coke then the earth water supply.  this ^

TBH I personally hate Coca-Cola's marketing, that Coke so American we can't not love it. It's actually pretty terrible for you, and people are realizing that. I read in marketing class that soft drink sales in the USA were down 3% in 2014 over 2015 (source: Mintel Reports for the soft drink industry). People are also trending away from McDonald's (sales are also down several % IIRC). Sales of healthier beverages (e.g. seltzer) are up 200-300% for some producers (La Croix brand is booming). Coke's new green label variety (like half stevia rather than HFCS) is an attempt to catch fleeing customers who are wisening up to the fact Coca Cola (and generally most soda) is pretty damn terrible for us. Little to no nutritional value, huge cause of obesity, etc.   So no, I don't drink coke. But who am I to make that decision for some man or woman fighting on behalf of this nation? Fuck it, have a coke."

You have NO idea what it takes to be in the military. What you sacrifice. The 10% off at the occasional store doesn't make up for that. Yeah they get paid a living wage and GOD FORBID, they get some shitty housing, but that's at the cost of your freedom to go where you want and do what you want. That's at the cost of your sanity, your health, and sometimes your life. So until you've seen beyond the 10% military discount that SOME places (not even most) offer, you do NOT know what you're talking about. If you think it's so easy, I invite you to join. Do two or three years of easy living and then you get all those sweet, sweet discounts.

On top of that, the vast majority of the those in the first 4 years I've ever met are complete douches. I have no sympathy for any hardship they incur for a job they applied to. They provide no progress for this country and in the past 30 years have only caused this country more trouble, either from the $600 billion a year they use, or from the destabilization of the world.   The formation of ISIS is that simple. With Sadam in power Isis would never have formed. And I blame the soldiers as much as the politicians. Just because they are just 'following orders' does not make them blameless for the middle east situation. A popular saying on here goes, ""no snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible""."

I was a fighter jet mechanic. I repaired and worked on F-16s. I meant the mission as a whole. We're spending over a trillion dollars to drop bombs on dudes who live in caves. Half the militants that attack us over there either were not born before 9/11 or too young to know what it was. We're just this powerful foreign country who keeps killing them.  9/11 was a bad thing. 10+ dudes came up with a plan and took advantage of lax security protocols at airports to great effect. What we've done in response and the mindset of people we've helped create is on a scale that blows 9/11 out of the water. We are the aggressors. I played a part in that. Nothing we've done over there has kept anyone here safe, as evidenced by the recent death of 5 marines in TN and continued plots.  Terrorism as a whole is about doing the most with the least. This isn't a country vs country war where we all fight on even ground anymore. But we treat terrorism like it is a declaration of war from another country and assault them as such.  To think otherwise is really naive."

freebies,3dee3t,mshawke,3,Thu Jul 16 13:48:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you.   I think /u/god_damn_bitch summarized it pretty well up there. Besides it being cheap food with sub par ingredients, Purina does not have a good reputation for quality controls either. There is a current lawsuit against their Beneful dog food because it's killing dogs.   What happened is that we mixed this in with her food because you should never do a full food change. The next day (Sunday) she was really sick. We took her to emergency and they treated her and gave her a fluid pack to keep hydrated. They thought she'd be fine and sent her home and advised against cheap Purina foods as they'd seen cases of salmonella recently related to the food. Monday she looked better and Tuesday she was worse than she was on Sunday. Our local vet said that they could send her back to the emergency hospital to shove a tube down her throat and force fluids and medication down her, but they didn't think it would do any good. They said that they suggest everyone avoid any of Purina's cheaper foods but they made a decent quality high grade food. Personally I won't support Purina in any capacity after losing my cat.   She was a wonderful cat, truly a part of the family and I miss her terribly. It's been months and I'm still tearing up writing this. We recently got a new kitten and she's spoiled rotten and cute as anything. She'll never eat anything Purina."

freebies,3dasgg,MrCata,4,Tue Jul 14 23:48:43 2015 UTC,"I always wonder if a random link like this, from nowhere in particular, has really jump started anybody's dreams or perhaps even a career.  Like, maybe there's somebody who genuinely wants the thrill and excitement of a live performance, on stage, in front of a crowd of thousands, but just doesn't know where to start. Maybe their job can barely pay the bills, and they just feel like something like that is simply impossible to reach at this point in their life.  Then, while wasting time on Reddit (or maybe somewhere else), they see this ad for a free magazine that offers guidance, tips, and maybe even has a catalog somewhere within where the reader can purchase instruments and accessories.  After this comes in the mail, this person is inspired to realize their dream they've held since high school. The dream they've held since starting a garage band with 3 other friends; that dream that they thought was dead once high school ended and everybody moved away, whether for college or work.  They save up, little by little, and buy a guitar. Maybe something affordable, or perhaps they save a while longer and buy something of true quality. Either way, they get themselves a guitar, and it all takes off from there.  I really, really want to know how many people ended up having their lives being taken over by one singular obsession after a cursory glance at a link to a website or maybe even a newspaper article, or... anything. It's so inspiring to hear how just one seemingly insignificant event can change your entire life.  When I was probably 11 or 12, there was a particular night while I was staying at my grandfather's house during which I could not sleep. I decided turning the TV on would help me sleep, and switched to Cartoon Network, which was Adult Swim at that time of night. I happened to catch an episode of Bleach airing that night. To be specific, it was either the 3rd or 4th episode, and it was the original premiere date of this episode in America. It was my first exposure to any real form of Japanese culture, and it amazed me how different the lives of these cartoon characters were, excluding the supernatural aspects. Their buildings and architecture, their food, the side of the street they drove on, the way they wrote, the characters they wrote with, their clothing. Even the way they ate their food was different.  8 years later, I've been accepted into a study abroad program at my university and will be studying in Kumamoto Prefecture starting April 2016.  How different my life might be right now if I hadn't happened to see that one. Single. Anime episode. It scares me, sometimes, to think of what might have happened if I had fallen asleep before that episode started. Where would I be? What kind of person might I be? Would I hate people who do watch anime and consider them nerds? How about Japan in general? Would I just consider them ""weird"" instead of considering how diverse and complex a nation of nearly 130 million people can be? I live in Montana, so misunderstanding foreign cultures is almost expected here. My family's overall knowledge of Japan includes that they live in ""rice-paper houses"" and they eat with ""sticks.""   I'm so grateful for such a seemingly insignificant event; it has changed me to my very core and shaped who I am as a person. My life would be completely different if not for that one fateful, sleepless night."

My mobility is back, load bearing and strength are coming back greatly, I feel like I'm starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel.

PT twice a week until the start of month 5. bicycling at month 2 LOTS of homework from my PTs until about month 3 at which point we dialed back to ensure i didn't end up with tendinitis in the remaining patellar ligament.  short distance running at month 3.5/4, i believe at month 4.5 or so we started aggressive agility and return-to-sport training (i do a bunch of activities that stress the knee joint like muay thai, rock climbing, and paragliding) was cleared to return to muay thai today, kicking at half speed. i'm about a week shy of the 6 month mark.   finding a GOOD physical therapist and listening to every damn thing they told me has been key in my recovery. my knee is still stiff and reaches its endurance limit much earlier than i'd like, but i'm back up to running 4/5 miles at a time and doing somewhat normal activity. muscle strength is back to about 65/70% so i haven't been discharged from PT just yet. probably another week or two until discharge. i'm told it should ""click"" into feeling normal at some point shortly after 6.5/7 months  edit: i'm 38, so recovery times are probably shorter if you're considerably younger"

freebies,3cldjf,Synaxxis,10,Wed Jul 8 21:04:08 2015 UTC,We take them out of the freezer...fry them...toss them in sauce and there ya go!

freebies,3cldjf,Synaxxis,3,Wed Jul 8 22:16:15 2015 UTC,Yeah they are frozen. The sauces come in bags that are not frozen but as to where they are from or what makes them unique I have no idea. The closest I have ever gotten to imitating it is by adding corn starch thickening to a hannafords brand buffalo sauce. The seasoning is called Topical seasoning...I have no idea what's in it.

freebies,3cldjf,katsqaz,2,Wed Jul 8 23:15:01 2015 UTC,They are pretty gross before they go out to you. Since Kobe beef is from japan they ship from there and sit in our freezer for so many days before being steamed. Honestly they are not appetizing at all when we cook them.
freebies,3cldjf,ImaginaryFri3nd,10,Wed Jul 8 23:31:06 2015 UTC,"They're actually not from Japan. If you look at the menu, it actually says kobe ""style"" meatballs. So you have a similar kind of beef, just from the U.S.. I'm pretty sure it's actually illegal to import kobe beef into the U.S., plus they would be much more expensive if that was the case."
freebies,3cldjf,newskit,4,Thu Jul 9 00:12:51 2015 UTC,You are correct...I just looked at the label and it says Wisconsin or something...I think one of my managers mentioned them importing them and I might have taken the wrong information from the conversation...so thanks for clearing that up!

freebies,3cldjf,ImaginaryFri3nd,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:48:39 2015 UTC,"Howdy.  12 year service industry veteran here, foh exclusively. Is it true that everything you guys make comes in a bag before it is prepared?  If that is the case do you feel weird calling yourself a ""cook"" since it doesn't seem like there would be much ""cooking"" just mostly like, heating?  Also do you aspire to a better kitchen and/or do you cook well/better at home than you do at work?  What about your co-workers?  Sorry I started at a Macaroni Grill back in the day then went to Cheesecake Factory so I never got to see the boh goings on at an applebees. I didn't mean to come off as rude either, I have a genuine respect for your crazy fuckers that play with knives and fire all day. :) even if there might not be a lot of knife work happening in your kitchen lol. :p"
freebies,3cldjf,sunnydaize,8,Wed Jul 8 22:51:14 2015 UTC,"Hey there, interesting and good questions. I personally don't call myself a cook exclusively...line cook maybe. I never wanted to be a cook and this started out as a summer job but, not to toot my own horn, I was so good at it they kept throwing money and promotions at me, so I decided to stay to get myself out of student debt.   Some of my co-workers call themselves cooks but, not to be overly judgemental, they really aren't going anywhere else with their lives (meth heads, pieces of shit people). I aspire to be better at my job...regardless of what it is. I don't particularly enjoy cooking but it pays the bills and I'm moving up the ranks so it's okay for now.   We do cook quite a bit though. the mid station is responsible for cooking shrimp dishes as well as many other vegetable sides like sauteed onions and mushrooms, spinach and tomatoes, and burgers. The Broil station cooks the steaks and chicken so I there is a little knowledge with that...even though the steaks aren't considered actual meat. We also prep a lot during the day, which requires a lot of cutting for salads, tomatoes, cabbage and the like. We're not making duck a la king but it is definitely more than the average at home chef; I have a knife callis if that's easier to read. haha   Working at Applebee's, for me, has been about 40% cooking with the rest being ability to handle stress, adapt to situations, and deal with other people and the problems they present you."
freebies,3cldjf,ImaginaryFri3nd,2,Wed Jul 8 22:56:49 2015 UTC,Handling the stress and other bullshit is like 90% of restaurant jobs.

freebies,3cldjf,sunnydaize,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:15:45 2015 UTC,...The other reason I said no was I am a little intimidated by the whole tax situation you guys have as people who work for tips. Seems really complicated.
freebies,3cldjf,ImaginaryFri3nd,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:48:21 2015 UTC,"It's not, especially in a corporate restaurant setting.

freebies,3cldjf,heartohio,3,Thu Jul 9 02:14:12 2015 UTC,"Well, it has more to do with people not liking the steaks and them fearing that most steaks at restaurants that don't specialize is steak grilling like long horn or whatever use fake meat or meat that was ""glued"" together. I honestly don't think our meat is ""glued"" but I KNOW it's not of the best quality.   The bourbon street steak is actually consisted of mostly cooked to order stuff. We pre cut the red potatoes but other than that all the other stuff is fresh."

The tobacco companies usually just email me once a month to remind me to request coupons (which you can opt out of), and then once when they start a new promotion (free item or contest). They almost never send me anything in the mail unless I request it (unless I haven't ordered coupons in several months, then they'll sometimes randomly send me a coupon - but, again, that like once every 6 months).   Plus, you can sell tobacco coupons on eBay.   And, as the others mentioned, just because you get their free products or even their coupons doesn't mean you have to use them. I don't like Black & Milds, but I love the freebies they give out every few months.   But to each their own.

Due to the high volume of requests, we're not able to send condoms to everyone who signs up. So the more you tell us about your ideas for cool events and opportunities to engage people in conversation about human population and endangered species, the easier it is for us to make sure the condoms are sent where they can have the greatest impact. Submissions are reviewed on the 1st of every month   TL;DR, you're volunteering to distribute them and have to convince them you'll be good at it.  Might be good for a college student club or something, I dunno, but otherwise you might not get your white tiger condoms."

freebies,3bxowd,factisfiction,6,Fri Jul 3 12:13:28 2015 UTC,The entire concept of alkalinity being good for you. The 'scientific studies' they cite on that page just talk about proving that alkaline water makes you more alkaline. There is no science supporting the idea that you'll be healthier if you're more alkaline. It's just a fad diet designed to trick people into spending huge amounts of money on things they don't need (e.g. the Kangen water machine pyramid schemes).
freebies,3bxowd,MikeTheInfidel,4,Fri Jul 3 12:35:09 2015 UTC,"I gotta say though, I have a bladder condition, if I drink anything with a pH of lower than a 7 or so, it's like I just drank acid.

freebies,3bxowd,gracefulwing,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:40:08 2015 UTC,"Alkaline can help balance out the pH level in the body. If your body becomes too acidic you have metabolic acidosis. Cancer thrives in an acidic environment as well acidic blood can lead to mineral depletion of the bones. With that being said, not everyone needs alkaline to help with homeostasis. Typically our liver and kidneys work just fine at keeping us in balance."
freebies,3bxowd,factisfiction,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:13:15 2015 UTC,"Cancer thrives in an acidic environment   This is completely false. Cancer causes the acidic environment in which it thrives; it doesn't just develop in an otherwise healthy body that happens to have a slightly acidic spot. Saying that an acidic environment increases the risk of cancer is like saying that since the sun warms you up, and the sun causes sunburn, then blankets that warm you up will cause sunburn.  And metabolic acidosis is usually the result of severe poisoning. There is no evidence that dietary changes can cause a permanent pH shift."

freebies,3bt2uh,vince2398,5,Thu Jul 2 03:04:12 2015 UTC,"Yes. My iPhone 4S battery had already 1000 cycles, so I decided to replace it. After going through a series of three bad batteries on Amazon (first one the connector broke clean off, second one had bad drain), I decided to take the plunge and spend more for one from iFixit. Well, I installed the first one from iFixit and decided to drain it all the way, but then it wouldn't charge/turn on. I emailed them and received a replacement one that I'm currently using that works great. Nevertheless, don't take my experiences as negative, since the 4S is nearly 4 years old, so the batteries were probably all reused with new chips, or the ones in stock probably sat on the shelf for a long time because not a majority of people still use a 4S.  TL;DR First iFixit battery wouldn't charge probably because of long shelf storage/obsolete battery; I'd say go for iFixit."

I guess you could park just outside the park and walk in, but they would probably ask some questions if you did it repeatedly I imagine.  Some parks are close to towns like Jasper or Banff (those towns are actually within their respective parks), but most of the others are out of the way. I believe they are stricter at checking for passes at parks close to towns. I know some other areas like the Icefield Parkway has an additional cost to get on that road, and has a booth set up at either end.  The trans Canada trail actually goes from Coast to Coast across Canada and connects to a number of national parks along the way, so you could technically hike to a park, but it would be a long walk for sure! :)"

freebies,3bn3va,ANGRY_FRENCH_CANADAN,8,Wed Jul 1 14:07:33 2015 UTC,"No they are not fenced off, but they are mainly large, isolated wooded areas. There are only one or two roads out of them, and there are booths near the entrances. You could gladly hike in, but it would take you some time to get to the park...to hike, so it's pretty redundant.  You mainly pay for the parking (but an all parks year long pass is something like 60$, so not too bad) and you have to pay per night for camping. Some places require reservations because they get busy.  When you park for a trail, you leave your car behind in the park, and a ranger will come along looking for your permit. To be honest, I've never gotten a ticket, even though I've parked and hiked a number of times during the years without a pass. Since I've become and adult, and appreciate what our national parks give us, however, I gladly pay my yearly due. More than worth it in my opinion.  Some parks are more recreational camping styles, with multiple campsites one next to another, but you can also find wild camping along hiking trails, etc. My favorite camp ever, was in Jasper national park. I found a side road and decided to see where it went - a lone campsite along a river with chopped wood ready for a fire. It was between two mountains looking out into a valley, and there was no one around for miles - the stars were breathtaking that night.  Edit: also all museums in Ottawa are free as well! That's a decent savings for anyone who wants take a few in!"

Perhaps not rape, but robbery or murder.  Women's fear of being alone at night is because they FEEL less safe, not because they actually are.  And biologically speaking all males are most attracted to females when they are young and fertile.  Teaching some degree of modesty does no harm, and if this is the worst thing to gripe about, is illustrative of how pervasive female privilege actually is.   Seriously, what harm does telling young women not to dress in an extremely revealing matter do?  Also it's not like young males have never been sent home for ""offensive"" t-shirts. Also from my perspective, people worrying about me being ""distracting"" would be preferable to my being a male who is not in the top fifth of attractiveness (i.e., being COMPELETELY INVISIBLE.) Check your privilege.  If you haven't lived life as a male, you assume it's all roses.  That's because it is, if you're a top tier man.

The issue isn't that it's natural or not to be attracted to children. Our society is advanced beyond that point and if you thing it's a child's job to pick up the slack on your pedophilia you are setting a precedent that paedophilia is the victims fault. To which my response is please stay away from my children you disgusting fuck, otherwise I'll contribute some of that violent crime you're bitching about to you.  A person being sent home because they are wearing something offensive is a totally different issue than little girls being sent home because pervs are getting boners from looking at them.

freebies,3bnf3k,Mn2,-17,Wed Jul 1 16:46:14 2015 UTC,"33% of females get raped?  Source please.  Also I believe being murdered has some pretty long lasting effects.  Most murder victims are men.  But you're right rape is probably worse.  /s  It is completely natural to be attracted to children who have gone through puberty.  Girls wouldn't routinely be mothers at 15 throughout much of human history otherwise.  Social stigma doesn't override biological fact, girls are most attractive to men at age 16-26 or so.    A 15-16 year old may be a child, but she knows full well what she's doing when she provokes sexual response.  Also, this age range is old enough to preclude paedophilia.  Paedophilia is attraction to actual children, 15 year old and older girls are biologically adults for all intents and purposes. Who said anything about people getting boners anyway?  I was taught at a very young age it's not appropriate to be naked in public.  How is this any different?  How is teaching appropriate modesty a bad thing?  Nope, not a paedo or sympathizer.  Being attracted to an 11 year old is in fact repugnant.  Are we talking about them or teenagers, we never established, that's a HUUUUUUGE distinction. Nice try to discredit my argument with name calling though, that's known as a ""logical fallicy"" more specifically ""ad hominem.""  the last bit, I am mainly referring to the fact that many studies, including a prominent one done by OKCupid, shows women as a whole generally rate about 80% of men as below average.  This transcends all ages and cultures.    In other words, women have the privilege of being much more likely to be found attractive by the opposite sex according to science."

But that's another discussion and I'd like to stay on topic.  The point here is, though, that a lot of teenage girls do not make the connection ""looks good"" with sex. Or even ""attention"" --> sex. It is hard to explain, but it is kind of the same as doing what you think is normal (say have shoes on inside) without knowing that others (people from other cultures) see it as something completely different (rude, sloppy). Or, perhaps more illustrative, spice girls. All girls who were young when Spice girls was a thing did not see the sex/eroticism in their songs, videos and clothes. As adults, most would say it was in your face obvious... but it wasn't.  I am discussing your claim on how girls are ""fully aware"" of what they imply with their clothes/behavior.

Anyone under the legal age is a minor and our society has pretty harsh consequences on those who like to sexualize minors.   Okay even though I was referring to the dress codes which are commonly found in elementary schools even. I guess you didn't specifically mention children. Wearing a tank top is not meant to provoke sexual response, it is meant to cool the fuck off because it is summer.

Some degree of modesty is indeed appropriate and I would say necessary.    You started the rudeness by calling me a paedophile based off my simple acknowledgement that men are biologically programmed to seek out young, fertile women.  A 16 year old is very well equipped for the physical burden of childproof vs. a 36 year old, or even a 26 year old!  it's an evolutionary thing.  Unlike your US and A having relations with a 16 year old is legal in many places as well.  You try to discredit me for simply acknowledging the truth.

freebies,3b5961,transientDCer,3,Fri Jun 26 15:05:52 2015 UTC,"Ask yourself, does your partners snoring really come from the nose? Probably not. If the problem is farther down in the airway, why would a sticky, springy piece of plastic applied to the nose help?  As an experiment, have the snorer use a decongestant nasal spray at bedtime. If that completely eliminates the snoring, then  m a y b e this product will work.  Don't use decongestant nasal sprays for more than three days because they have a nasty effect of increasing nasal congestion if used for that long."

I get more sound sleep with them than without so it's not just about snoring. They do not 100% stop all snoring for all people, but can help. Not to mention if you have nasal congestion or have allergies/inflammation these can definitely improve sleep. They are good to have around just for that alone. There is also the issue of applying the product properly which can greatly impact performance. The fact that it's a mechanical solution vs using chemicals also has a certain appeal."

freebies,3b3eqf,texastoasty,14,Thu Jun 25 18:40:12 2015 UTC,"For everyone who is wondering what jet is, I am currently in the beta and can explain it. Its founded by the person who created diapers.con before he sold it to amazon. It is essentially an online costco where you will pay a flat fee per year and that is how they will make money. The value to you comes from reduced prices on many different products, and additional shipping discounts when you order multiple items. For example, I many order a book and it is 10, but if I order a book and a movie, the price of the book may drop to 8.50 because now you are saving the company money on shipping. Additionally, you can also shop on other websites and earn jet cash by providing them a proof of purchase through an affiliate link. This jet cash can be used on anything on the website, and the amount of jet cash you get will vary on the site (i.e. something like best buy gives you 1%, but iTunes will give you 10% of your total purchase price in jet cash).   I have had it for about two month, and while it is missing some features (some common products are not available, no wish list or saving items), it has a solid premise. It is still in beta, which is why the T-shirts are coming out to celebrate and provide marketing for their official launch in the near future. I ordered my free shirt yesterday."

freebies,3b8vdm,andrewszombie,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:03:06 2015 UTC,"Either way she's a faker.   People can change! With all due respect, and in the whole scheme of the world, Homophobia, Anti-LGBTQ+, Anti Gay Marriage rhetoric was pretty - and criminally - successful in the past. The ONLY voice politicians heard were churches and lobbyists and catholics and evangelicals and republicans and the God damn Helen Lovejoys of the world. (There are some catholics and evangelics SUPPORTIVE of LGBTQ+ rights and people but the ones that make the most noise are homophobic)  It's easy to say ""Well she's changed her stance today but was only anti X years ago"" when they're fed negativity.  Homophobia and Anti-Gay sentiment climaxed in the 80s with the AIDS/HIV Crisis. LGBTQ*+ rights isnt as simple as the stance of politicians - keep in mind that the victim blaming on victims of Murder motivated by Homophobia (like Matthew Shepard) also fed into the subconscious/psyche (of homophobia).  All of the Candidates announced so far are what? between like 40 and 70? Baby Boomers, which are notorious for homophobia.  Also - keep in mind - PBO was against Gay Marriage in 2008 when asked about it during a debate - Guess who's voices he was hearing at the time?"

Did society at large pressure you into acceptance?  Do you really enjoy those funny guy dudes in that one sitcom?    Don't get me wrong, I understand people can change, but this one topic is something you either get or don't.    I really personally don't understand.  I was raised by two gay men that had to spend their entire lives together living in some secret fucked up shame.  I saw their love firsthand.  (Not that kind, jerks). I was raised with traditional Christian values. However I obviously took a more humanist approach, and it always blew my Mind white people couldn't marry black people at one point in some places.    And the thing is, you're not the one running for office and that is the target of my vitriol.  It's a corrupt politician that will continue running he country I love into the ground to benefit her handlers and owners.  She is owned by the corporations.  She's going to make sure we are as well."
freebies,3b8vdm,isubird33,3,Tue Jun 30 02:34:53 2015 UTC,"Your experience is probably different than most.  I mean 10, heck even 6-7 years ago I was probably similar to lots of people in the country.  From a town of about 50-60k people.  There was no real outward gay presence in the town.  No pride parades, rainbow flags, the one gay bar in town was in a shady part of town.  Social media wasn't as wide spread, and you didn't see other views and lifestyles as much. Hell, I didn't even know someone who was out as gay until like, sophomore year of high school.  If you look at polling data from that time, being anti-gay marriage was a pretty widespread mindset. It wasn't that lots of people were exactly anti-gay...its just that when you pictured marriage you pictured a man and a woman.   But as I got older, my life experiences, and along with them my views, changed.  I met and became friends with more and more gay people.  I went to college and saw people of all different orientations from all over the country. I took different courses that had great debates into various beliefs. I learned more about how marriage was about rights, not just two people living together. I went from spending time with a small social circle, to spending more and more time in more urban, young, hipper, and socially forward areas.  I spend most of my time in a city of 1 million people now.  Your views are going to change over time, and thats a good thing, its how people grow.   My views on gay marriage before, probably similar to lots of people out there who are still against it, don't come from a place of hate.  They come from ignorance of the situation.  They don't understand gay people, they don't understand what marriage means to other people."

freebies,3aw1yv,lejefferson,4,Wed Jun 24 19:13:58 2015 UTC,"I'm a very big fan of Cardboard, but the Oculus Rift and Samsung Gear VR play in another league thanks to some very clever changes to the hardware and software made by Oculus. Google calls Cardboard ""bite-sized VR"" for a number of very good reasons, and actively discourages people from using it with head straps. Cardboard itself is an almost 1:1 copy of the FOV2GO viewer from 2012, a project in which Palmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus VR, was involved. Cardboard is great, but you get what you pay for, which can be as little as USD 1.46 with free (and slow) shipping for a usable Cardboard 1.0 clone from AliExpress."

freebies,3aw1yv,faduci,10,Wed Jun 24 12:04:35 2015 UTC,"It actually made a full circle: Mattel will release a new VR View-Master in October 2015 for about USD 30. It was developed in cooperation with Google, (initially) uses an Android or (later) iOS or Windows phone and can run regular Cardboard software. It comes with special ""experience reels"", but these are basically download links to the Play/App store in plastic form that allow grandparents to cover them with gift wrap paper before giving them to their grandchildren. Actually a pretty good business plan."
freebies,3aw1yv,rudejester,5,Wed Jun 24 13:46:58 2015 UTC,So this works like a plastic Google cardboard basically?
freebies,3aw1yv,kingkhani,4,Wed Jun 24 15:45:13 2015 UTC,"Yes. They announced it a couple of months ago, and the only real difference to a plastic Cardboard was that it used a lever to touch the screen as input instead of the magnets, something that only the Vrizzmo viewer offered before that. Shortly after that Google introduced a way to create specific settings for other viewers that included both the magnets and touch lever as options, and the Cardboard v2 Google showed at I/O 2015 dropped the (unreliable) magnets and also switched to a screen touching button.   The only other differences seem to be that it a) will come from a large brand toy company, b) will be available in retail stores, c) will evoke nostalgia in parents and grandparents (the original View Master was introduced in 1939), d) will be a lot more robust than a cardboard Cardboard version to handle abuse by kids and e) will probably make more money than all other Cardboard software combined due to the very clever (and expensive) software pseudo-distribution as plastic cartridges.  Cardboard is already by far the the largest VR platform, the Cardboard demo app passed the 1M installation mark in early February. With some luck Mattel will be the distributor with the largest amount of sold VR viewers after the coming holiday season."

Copying from /u/theblueangel from here:  You want to be there at exactly 2 PM Central / 3 PM Eastern.   Make your account before the promotion starts tomorrow. Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers seemed to load the quickest. Yahoo mail users experienced a really long wait time before their codes arrived. G-mail is the best option, the code will show up in your promotions folder. Just because you have an account before the promotion doesn't mean you're guaranteed one. Do not wait until after work, as soon as the promotion starts, start refreshing your page. At that point all you have to do is sign in with your username and password for the MLB website, and sometimes they have a quick one question survey such as what's your favorite pizza topping? If you would like to give your code away, please visit random acts of pizza to give to the less fortunate if you do not need your pizza."

freebies,3ajvnv,Cumdodger,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:18:43 2015 UTC,It's essentially a Sicilian pizza but you don't let the dough rise before you bake it so it stays dense but tender. And they cook it in a pan so it gets really crispy on the bottom and sides. And then the sauce they use is a little more rustic with pieces of roasted garlic in there and fresh basil. It looks like this. They usually have this stripe layout which gets bonus points for beauty.   http://tinaspizzapasta.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_5395.jpg

Our toddler is in on it now, so I don't even know what hair ties were left on a ledge on purpose (emergency needs of hair ties within 12 feet of anywhere in the house) and which ones my toddler has been playing around with. It's like there is a local gyre moving hair ties around the house, like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, but instead of plastic bits, it's hair ties, and instead of the Pacific, it's our house, including cars.  That tie on the table by the change, is it needed? or should I put it somewhere else? The three under the bed? What about the one on the lego table? Needed where it is or moved by toddler? If there are already 4 around the hand brake on the car, what do I do with the 5th I just found?  Would I be a better husband if I just buy the $3.99 pack of 36 and toss a handful in every room?

freebies,3a7hbt,financialbabe,6,Wed Jun 17 20:50:54 2015 UTC,This seems pretty cool but I'm a little confused. Will they tack on an additional 10% to my purchase because it's a one day pass? Or is that if you don't have the pass?
freebies,3a7hbt,LMAO_HAHA_WOW,4,Wed Jun 17 21:02:05 2015 UTC,They charge an additional 10% (except for excluded states) than member prices when using the one-day pass. It's a way to get you into the store to check it out without having to buy a membership.

freebies,3a7hbt,Jforjustice,3,Thu Jun 18 17:51:38 2015 UTC,None of the warehouses are better than shopping sales. What you do get is a consistently decent price if you usually pay retail at other stores. I think the main benefit of the free pass is to go and see if the membership makes sense for your situation. I don't think you're going to come away with huge savings.

While National Parks are highly vested in preservation, barely altering the existing state, National Forests are managed for many purposes—timber, recreation, grazing, wildlife, fish and more.   So Nat'l Parks are just that. Parks. Nat'l forest land is multi-use land. So for instance if I run a ski resort, run a logging operation, grazing (Cliven Bundy) I have to get a permit to use the land for that from the NFS. Rocky Mountain National Park, Yellowstone, etc are just a parks, you can't use the land for anything other than a park.   NPS - DoI NFS - DoA"

What's crazy about the punk alarm is it could be dangerous. Let me dumbbell press 75 lb bells and drop these weights on my chest, neck, or head because a loud ass alarm went off and startled me.  Obviously this is extreme, but their policies make it seem like they don't want people working out unless you just walk on a treadmill.  I used to be a member at one, they had treadmills, ellipticals, and stationary bikes wall to wall. They didn't have a squat rack or bench press. No barbells. Dumbbells that only went up to 75. Most weight you could get was on a smith machine which is terrible for squats since it destroys your form. My knees took a pounding doing squats there.  It's a business model most gyms have, though. They don't care if you work out, and probably would rather you not show up and decrease the longevity of their equipment. They'd rather you pay, then not show up.  That's why a lot of gyms have new years and summer specials, because they know a ton of people will sign a contract and spend money and show up a couple times then say ""fuck it, I'm not going."""

But I know at least 3 or 4 of my friends who were obese and lost tons of weight going to planet fitness. And, imo, that's the point of going to a gym; to be fit."
freebies,39eprk,MEatRHIT,7,Thu Jun 11 16:29:28 2015 UTC,"TIL 50 pounds in a machine is different than 50 pounds free weight   It is actually. With the way machines are set up the loading profiles are different, range of motion is going to be different, machines also restrict you to one plane of movement so there is very little stabilizers used. If all you do is use the leg press/leg extension/leg curl and you go and try to free squat with a barbell, you're going to have a bad time."

The machines are not ""worthless""; if you move slowly and mindfully with good form you can achieve a lot. Years ago I lifted at a women's gym in L.A., and it was the only ""serious"" gym I ever went to where there were no big sweaty yelling guys dropping huge barbells on the floor, who didn't wipe down the equipment after they were done, and spat in corners. I was impressed at PF today -- it was air conditioned, lots of fans, enough room that you could work out alone, not have to share equipment. The equipment is clean, relatively new, and in good shape. It may not match gyms that cost $60 a month, but hey, for the price it's amazing. At least the one I went to."

Anytime Fitness comes to mind, along with a slew of others.  There is nothing wrong with going to the gym and not being super serious, millions do it.  The super angry attitude comes from the fact that anyone who is halfway serious is kicked out, banned, and ostracised for doing the essential lifts such as squats and deadlifts and maybe making the slightest bit of noise.  And I'm not talking about screaming and making a scene; I'm talking about the noise you make when helping a buddy lift a heavy dresser down a flight of stairs, you know, normal human reactions.  It defies logic to open a health club that does not want people to be healthy. They act like its one extreme or the other.  As if you can't have power lifters, bodybuilders, marathon runners, triathletes, etc train in one facility without a bunch of ed hardy shirts and self tanner.  They make it us vs them when it doesn't need to be.   You know how you don't want to go to a gym with the super macho attitude?  Imagine the roles are reversed, Meathead Barbell Club is the cheapest in town, largest chain in the country, and constantly kicks out people who are fat and/or skinny, and makes a point to highlight them, publicly shame them, then have the audacity to say the reason the gym is so popular is because their members don't want to be brought down by fat weaklings.

Contrary to your baseless assumption that I would ""probably criticize a fat person if they showed up at my gym"", I absolutely LOVE to see obese/frail/old/whatever people exercising. But only if they actually do some research, educate themselves about proper diet and exercise, and make a serious effort get fit.  Unfortunately, the vast majority simply show up and expect it to be as easy as reading the McDonald's dollar menu. If you make any effort to learn about exercising effectively, you'll quickly realize that Planet Fitness is just about everything you want to avoid in a gym. I'm aware that not all PF locations are this bad, but there are much better options out there. Also, it's not just the facilities that are the problem. It's their culture of promoting mediocrity and discouraging hard work and dedication. It's more important to them that no one ever gets offended by anything ever or feels inadequate because someone is better than them at something. Like I said, it's a great business model: affordable gym, easy and ineffective workouts, overly sensitive customers that don't really care about progress, free snacks, no-pressure atmosphere, no one that knows what they're doing.  All you really need in a gym is a squat rack, some decent barbells and weights, an adjustable bench, a pull up bar, and maybe a few other things like a lifting platform with bumper plates or dumbbells if you want to get fancy. With that alone anyone can get build an extremely strong and balanced physique in a healthy and effective manner. Learn how to squat, deadlift, and press. Start doing some assisted pullups until you can do a real one. Develop a simple program and stick to it. Make goals and accomplish them, slowly. Ask people who know what they're doing for help. Stop giving a shit about what other people think. Don't be a fucking pussy.  If you are proper obese, you really don't even need to join a gym. Ride a bike to work. Park at the other end of the parking lot. Get off the bus a few stops early. Challenge children to spontaneous races. Never use an elevator, escalator, or moving walkway again. Take swim lessons. Skip the football game and walk for two hours. Stop drinking things that aren't water. Learn how to eat right. Meet with a registered dietitian (like my mom, they're nice people) and actually do what they say.  I want everyone to be fit and healthy because it's fucking awesome. Skiing 50,000+ vertical feet in one day is awesome. Saving money on junk food and learning how to cook is awesome. Being able to dunk a basketball is awesome. Going on a three day backpacking trip is awesome. Finding tons of clothes that fit is awesome. Looking great in a swimsuit is awesome. Having sex with attractive people is awesome. Doing something that would have been impossible for you before is awesome.  I'm harsh because I care. I'm harsh because I hate hearing excuses. I'm harsh because fat people are fucking expensive eyesores that take up too much space and use too many resources. I'm harsh because I'm tired of people trying to devalue my hard work and dedication because they lack discipline.  tl;dr Fat people who exercise are fucking awesome, but only if they actually educate themselves and work hard, and Planet Fitness makes it very difficult to work hard."

Our government was founded on the concept of liberty which is freedom from restriction and freedom of choice. I value liberty above a socialized ""nannying"" state that seeks to keep everyone on the same or even a similar playing field.

freebies,39boae,googlyeyespy,2,Thu Jun 11 19:37:06 2015 UTC,"Right. Could you describe that in terms of basic principles, or clearly define your idea of deservedness, force, and how someone earns things? All I can solidly tell from that is you don't believe in determinism.  Not trying to be pedantic/picky here, it's just that you've clearly learned how to argue in a debate/politics framework and seem to be making claims that are sufficiently ambiguous that any objection to them can be countered by refining your definitions, which obscures your principles and any ability to really counter or agree with you (intentional or not!).  I'm interested in what kind of principles you hold to be true and how they logically lead to your conclusions, so I'm trying to sidestep all of that. Personally I see concepts of deservedness/responsibility as either incoherent or morally redundant, likewise with the idea of ""earning"" something etc., so I'd like to see how you would come to use those terms consistently and non-arbitrarily."

Libertarian states usually entail an authoritarian political structure (political power is partly or largely legitimated by the arbitrary distribution of power, rather than an internally legitimate power structure). So it's within reason to ask you this."

I participated in 3 giveaways last year so I want to give you guys tips on making sure you get your pizza because this promotion is over in like 30 seconds once it's open. These tips are based on the user experience in the past threads, not mine personally.   Make your account before the promotion starts tomorrow. Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers seemed to load the quickest. Yahoo mail users experienced a really long wait time before their codes arrived. G-mail is the best option, the code will show up in your promotions folder. Just because you have an account before the promotion doesn't mean you're guaranteed one. Do not wait until after work, as soon as the promotion starts, start refreshing your page. At that point all you have to do is sign in with your username and password for the MLB website, and sometimes they have a quick one question survey such as what's your favorite pizza topping? If you would like to give your code away, please visit random acts of pizza to give to the less fortunate if you do not need your pizza."

freebies,39b3ii,tchai,6,Wed Jun 10 15:35:41 2015 UTC,"Looks like they were swamped with requests.  I wonder why.  Email just received this evening from the company:   A newsletter exclusively for the FNO Team:  FNO Supporter,  Thanks for your interest in Father Nature Outdoors. I would like to introduce myself: I am Christopher DeVore and I am the founder of Father Nature Outdoors. FNO was a passion project from back in college at the University of Maryland, and last fall we were able to launch FNO via Kickstarter to begin to scale up. We are still in the early stages as a company; I do most all of the work of running the small business myself. It’s an awesome experience, and you meet some great people doing so.  Many of the great people I have met have been part of our “Founding Family” which supported us through Kickstarter to get us off the ground. Earlier this spring they wrote that they wanted to show visible support for FNO so we created free FNO Decals for them. Each decal costs under a dollar in large quantities but with postage and supplies each request adds up to about a dollar, not considering the time spent with each mailing. We were more than happy to do this for our “Founding Family” and anyone willing to share the FNO name. We still are. We have received a few requests each day and happily fulfilled the requests for our supporters who share FNO (and the decals) through social media.  We had a handful of requests yesterday, but my email account received a few thousand requests today. A few thousand decals is a few thousand dollars in the budget of a small business that is getting off the ground. There was one requirement with the decals which you may or may not have read: Once you receive your decal, we ask that you share where you put your sticker and tag our small business through social media. Since we have a limited number of stickers on hand (a few hundred with more being ordered), we only have one solution to meet the demand.  We ask that you tag us in social media prior to our decal shipment. If you tag us in Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram I will personally look up your name and address and send a decal your direction. This may sound strange without a decal but here are some ideas:     Just share the FNO Facebook page with friends (we will be notified with your name)   Tag us @fathernatureoutdoors on Instagram with a cool picture stating “I will be taking FNO here”   Take a picture of where you plan to put your decal with “prime spot for FNO decal”   Any creative idea of this sort with us tagged    Facebook: Fathernatureoutdoors   Instagram:@Fathernatureoutdoors   Twitter:@fnoutdoors   We did not anticipate a few thousand requests coming in, but this is our best way to control the free decal outflow. Sharing FNO was the only caveat included with a free decal, so we just ask that you do it in advance in order for us to prioritize for our supporters. We will be pumped if you share after you receive you decal as well, but we think your initial support is more than enough. Thanks again for your interest in FNO and hope you enjoy your decal!  Thanks,  Christopher DeVore Father Nature Outdoors, LLC"

Nobody is more pro First Amendment than I am, but they abused their use of advertising, pitching to young people using cartoons in music magazines, paying for product placement in movies and TV shows so they could look cool, contouring their advertising to pitch their brands to carefully marketed demographic segments, etc., all while formulating their product to be more addictive so that once the customer was hooked, they were hooked for life. Big Tobacco is nearly the most reprehensible business in history, second only to slavery, and I am all for restricting their marketing and ability to profit, just short of the point of prohibition, because prohibition never works, and it would be cruel to completely deprive those are irreversibly addicted. In fact, I think they should force the companies to surrender ALL their profits but keep producing. They've made enough money from their parasitic business model and mercilessly carcinogenic product. It's time that they paid back."

Under the new healthcare rules for your policy (or if your state has expanded Medicaid) you're allowed to go for a routine visit to a doctor.   Do so. Let the doctor run a routine physical on you. Tell them you don't smoke, and let them verify it. Then let them write it down with the other paperwork in your medical file. Boom.   On the one hand, you have a tobacco company claiming you smoke because you entered in your information on a webpage. On the other hand, you have a licensed medical practitioner verifying that you do not consume tobacco and that your body does not display any symptoms of tobacco use.   Who is your insurance company more likely to believe?"

But then something interesting I noticed, all the locations in my way, all had only COKE showing up in the list (amongst the cigarettes etc which I am not interested), the free coffee mug wasn't displayed. This leads me to believe that coffee mug is only available in express locations while the coke may be available at almost all locations. Just a guess work.

I know I sounded like a crazy crackpot conservative, but I was just in that sort of mood.  Tbh, nothing tinfoil hat like about what I said.  I'm just speaking based on the experience I and other people I've run into have had with the new bulbs.  Yes, it's $10, and yes I was willing to pay that at the beginning, but when your expectations are not met, then you'd be idiot to continue to believe things that you've been told by others.  This happens more and more as you get older, making you more and more cynical as you get older as well.  The gov't just happens to be entity where, when you're young you expect good things to come from, but the more you interact with it as you get older, the more disappointed you become.  If you are young, and you sound like you are, it wouldn't hurt to listen to or learn about some libertarian or conservative view points.  Well, tbh I don't mean most of the crap you see on tv, I just mean that exposing yourself to those who talk about having a small gov't and why that's important would be good.

It was one of those girls going around handing out freebies.  A couple months later, he received a letter, either from his health insurance or life insurance company (I forget which) stating that his rates were going up because he was a smoker.  The cigarette company had sold his name.  Not saying that's what this is, but when I got to the part where it asked you to confirm that you are a smoker 21 years of age or older, I backed out."
freebies,383m3t,KunSeii,22,Mon Jun 1 22:31:07 2015 UTC,I never even considered that happening. I quit smoking 2 years ago but I've been on Camel and Marlboro's mailing lists for a long time. Now listed as a non smoker on my insurance and I haven't had any problems.  Definitely something to think about. Of course this type of thing doesn't surprise me coming from a tobacco company.

The tobacco companies are not selling your info, at least not the Philip Morris or RJ Reynolds. They have you check the box for legal reasons, mainly stating you are over 21, and it also says they do not sell your info. Your insurance company knows you smoke because you tell them or your doctor. Think about it....why would a tobacco company want to give you an incentive to quit?!   Next you're going to tell me that Obama is getting your info from someone scanning your I.D. Yes, I've sadly heard this multiple times."

I worked at a Petsmart for a summer in high school and the extensive training I received was a tour of the store, some orientation videos, and a crash course on their POS.   I'm going to go ahead and give this to my cat. The broth sounds good, the meat is actual chicken, and every once in a while as a treat isn't going to harm her."
freebies,37ui8w,bwaredapenguin,1 point,Sun May 31 05:08:03 2015 UTC,My rule is if it has chicken by product or any meat by product im not giving it to my cats.

I know people that will substitute one can of Friskies for one can of Fancy Feast but these are NOT equivalent! One serving size is half of can of Friskies but 5 CANS in Fancy Feast. It is really nice in other ways, like protein per amount of money, but you need to make sure your cat is getting all the nutrients it needs. Don't be fooled, ask your vet.  EDIT: As another side note, cats REQUIRE a protein-based diet. Any foods that boast veggies or cheese are not giving it any extra nutrition, and dairy is even detrimental in many cats. Don't let anyone feed cats a vegan or vegetarian diet because it will kill them, they need the protein, they are carnivores. Don't mean to sound morbid but I'm a pre-vet student and it's appalling how much sickness is caused by cat owners that don't know any better!"

freebies,37n8xy,bonoboho,2,Fri May 29 04:24:46 2015 UTC,"Section 14. Decline in bee population of article  Neonicotinoid:       A dramatic rise in the number of annual beehive losses noticed around 2006 spurred interest in factors potentially affecting bee health.   When first introduced, neonicotinoids were thought to have low-toxicity to many insects, but recent research has suggested a potential toxicity to honey bees and other beneficial insects even with low levels of contact. Neonicotinoids may impact bees’ ability to forage, learn and remember navigation routes to and from food sources.  Separate from lethal and sublethal effects solely due to neonicotinoid exposure, neonicotinoids are also being explored with a combination with other factors, such as mites and pathogens, as potential causes of colony collapse disorder.  Neonicotinoids may be responsible for detrimental effects on bumble bee colony growth and queen production.

Aug 2022 according to the address label on a recent copy I just found.  Signed up for a bunch of free subscriptions while in college 2000-2004ish. But not just Maxim, all their knock-off clones (FHM, Stuff, Blender, etc) as well. And I did it every chance I got. Had most of them locked in with free subs for years. But, as those magazines folded, they automatically gave another magazine to fulfill the remaining time in the subscription. In the end, only Maxim remained so all the additional subscription years ended up accumulated on to that account.  I haven't sat down to read it in years, other than maybe once or twice when nothing else was around and I needed to shit.  Quick flip through at the mail box, toss into a pile with all the other magazines, eventually dump into recycling bin.  I can't help but wonder which will last longer: The paper magazine or my subscription."

Someone could hit the ball, but it might be a foul, tagged out before reaching first, or maybe a caught fly-ball. It takes a lot off skill and luck for the pitcher to pitch well without getting hit off of, but also a great infield/outfield to increase the chances of the game being a no-hitter.   But I agree.

freebies,377h19,Shuamann1,3,Tue May 26 09:10:55 2015 UTC,"I honestly think Pizza Hut is the best. They often have promos so it's hard to beat their prices. With the free sauce drizzle and crust spreads, they have the most combinations available. Pizza Hut is great for an all around All-American type pizza, or you can custom a gourmet tasting one too.  The trick if you eat a lot of pizza though is to switch it up. It's easy to get sick of a pizza chain, even if you're ordering a good variety from them. All of them have their distinct tastes."
freebies,377h19,PotatoPotential,2,Mon May 25 23:06:53 2015 UTC,Very true. I worked at Domino's for a while and it's safe to say that they have improved a ton. Also having the ingredients to yourself is awesome. Made calzones and all sorts of stuff.

Just so you all know, the company hates giving things away so if you find something for $9.99 we are technically not allowed to mark it up to 10 bucks so you can get it for free. Depending who you go to, they will tell you to find something that will put your subtotal over $10 because tax is not included in the coupon. Don't count on it, but some employees may go above and beyond to give it to you for free. All in all still a really good coupon though."

freebies,36xr7r,TheButteryNipple,2,Sat May 23 07:51:22 2015 UTC,I am going to go out on a limb and say that it is in-store only. I signed up ages ago and I think it was for use in the store only. A lot of the text alerts are in-store only and you will know if it is when you get a text with a long ass barcode that starts with MC and has a ton of zeroes.

This time, they asked if I actually wanted the chocolate, I said no, and she added a penny on and gave me the shirt for free. I didn't even pay tax."

freebies,36xr7r,candiedyams,3,Sat May 23 11:46:15 2015 UTC,"I mean I've personally done it and I agree with you, depending where you are they either will or will not let you get something for free. Overall though, many managers and the company itself will say not to mark it up and to tell the customer to find something else to add to the transaction. Still, finding a 12.99 Polo and getting it for like 3 and some change is still a hell of a deal."

freebies,36wygh,Mr_Abe_Froman,7,Sat May 23 03:49:30 2015 UTC,"You say that, because Manos is widely panned, it had an MS3TK skit devoted to it.  But it is somehow objectively worse than anything that got over 0%?  Because Birdemic sits at 20%, Troll 2 at 6%, Master of Disguise at 1%, Movie 43 at 4%, while dozens of other films share the 0% rating.  Which exact number is ""right"" for each particular film, and more importantly, what meaningful value do we get from the number?  An insightful review with a ""wrong"" number is far more valuable than the half-conscious ravings of some idiot that happened to stumble on the ""right"" number.  The numbers have no value or accuracy by themselves, they're just a general gauge that helps contextualize the text.  Also:  Every review of that movie was made literal decades after the fact.  Being able to agree with the general consensus on a movie decades after release(and, frankly, decades after the consensus has already been made) is no great feat.  Saying ""Manos Is Bad"" is, at this point, way less valuable than the people who liked it enough(in their own way) to make a video game adaptation."
freebies,36wygh,SegataSanshiro,1 point,Sat May 23 04:10:43 2015 UTC,"Frankly, the movie gave me a headache and physical pain similar to a hangover. The acting was bad, the long filler shots were boring, and the characters made no sense. It had a good enough plot: couple get stranded, run into cult while looking for help. Based on the fact that the film caused me physical pain, I agree with the 0%. It took to yelling ""Manos"" every time the Master's hands-cape was on screen to be remotely enjoyable. I couldn't even laugh at the terrible quality because of the random scene - jumping that made it hard to follow.   Edit : I watched the original, non-MST3K version"

Basically in Australia you can get meat pies (I think in America they are called pot pies) and sausage rolls from any bakery. Any shop that advertised ""artisan"" ""gourmet"" meat pies would be laughed at for being overpriced hipster wank.  They have got a few things right though - dog's eye is a slang term for a meat pie, and dead horse is tomato sauce (our equivalent to ketchup), but charging $6.50 USD is fucking ridiculous. A meat pie from my local bakery costs $3.50 AUD which is probably like $2 USD. The meat filling also looks different, ours looks more like dog food.  Those extra flavours aside from the normal steak are also nonsense. We have a few extra flavours of meat pie here - steak and mushroom, steak and cheese, curry, etc - but none of that weird hipster shit.

freebies,367dcj,Eal12333,6,Sun May 17 05:24:42 2015 UTC,"Considering the lenses cost $600 in the first place, I would assume their RX is high or has lots of cyl or is bifocal/PAL.  I wouldn't recommend buying those online. With a background in eyecare, online ordering is great for smaller prescriptions that aren't difficult -- but once you get into higher/complex prescriptions, it's extremely important to get them fit and measured correctly (PD, seg ht, etc).  If those are measured incorrectly (usually with people measuring themselves) or the person just guesses online, then the glasses will be made with the wrong optical center, which means when they're looking out they're eyes aren't lined up to the center of the lens, which will cause prismatic effect, which can cause headaches, strain, and more... among other problems. Just a heads up that online ordering isn't for everyone."

The offer really isn't that great to be completely honest though.  I personally think they should give away 250 or so but eh.  Also, tip for buying from these stores.  Do not buy the little fire starter sticks (the ones you light and they keep burning so you don't have to keep lighting your fireworks).  They give you these after every purchase.  They usually will just grab a hand full of them.  Don't be scared to ask for a few more!  Lastly, please do not buy any of the mini morters.  A buddy of mine that works there popped some for me and they're a complete joke.  You can literally light the whole mini mortar in a car.

I really don't trust many people at all anymore.  And yes, a doctor is always preferred, because every drug out there can have and do have adverse affects.  And a personal doctor who you have been with for a while, with 6+ years of Medical school, and years of experience dealing with patients, and hopefully a few years with you specifically, would probably be recommended (probably because it's required by law, funny thing) for any drug prescription or otherwise.  You do realize that more Americans now, are dying from prescription drugs, far more than all the illegal drug use deaths in the country combined, which literally didn't just start happening until the 90's or so, when prescriptions sky rocketed and pharmaceutical companies started advertising prescription drugs for the first time every, which I'm pretty sure was illegal for a very long time up until recently."

Why don't you meet someone before you condemn an entire profession? Yes, doctors are sometimes paid to pedal drugs that a patient may not need. The patient can usually just get the generic version. I don't think doctors are giving out methadone for a cold, though. That's a seriously messed up doctor.   Just like in life, some people are scumbags.

The promotion officially takes place between 4-8 PM at all Haagen Dazs stores nationwide. Officially, it is a free one scoop sugar cone or cup. However, cake (wafer) cones are the same price as a sugar cone and many stores, mine included, are offering the free scoop in a cake cone as well. For $1 (the price of a waffle cone), you can have your scoop in a waffle cone instead of a cake or sugar cone or a cup. Stores are being strictly instructed to begin the promotion at 4 and promptly end it at 8. As soon as the clock strikes 8, the manager is to select an employee to stand at the end of the line with a sign. Anyone who joins the line after the employee is ineligible to receive the free scoop. I'm not sure as to how many stores will actually be following the 4-8 rule, but despite my boss being lax on many corporate rules, he instructed us that we will be ending the promotion at 8."

(Mods, let me know if this is uncool)  I did this in Chrome, but I think Firefox should work as well.  Once you're logged in and to the Nights Blended Blue 25 main page, it'll have the box on the right that you need XX more entries to get the zippo.  Open up the javascript console (Chrome:  Ctrl + Shift + J, Firefox:  Ctrl + Shift + K) and paste this in:  ep.loadContent(""_bounceback_unlocked"", ""#bounceback"");   Then hit Enter.  You should see the image change to ""Get Your Lighter"" or something like that, click on it, verify your address, and away it goes.

That's my best guess for low cost ""beating the system"".  I mean, if they get a $20 zippo lighter, and have to spend $4.95 or whatever to send you yours, they might not mind, especially if they wait until there is enough stuff to fill the flat rate box!

freebies,34ui8w,TreyviusAurelius,3,Mon May 4 20:25:45 2015 UTC,Done
freebies,34ui8w,raayzo,7,Mon May 4 20:57:28 2015 UTC,"Seems legit, can anyone confirm before I put in my address?"
freebies,34ui8w,diggtrucks1025,11,Mon May 4 18:14:42 2015 UTC,"All the freebizmag offers are legit. You just need to make sure you follow all the way through to the confirmation screen. There is a page that offers you a bunch of other mags for money, at the bottom of that page is says ""no thanks"", make sure you click on that to continue or else your order won't get placed."
freebies,34ui8w,raayzo,5,Mon May 4 19:35:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah I almost bailed on it once I saw that page but then noticed the tiny ""no thanks"" option and eventually made it to the confirmation page. Thanks"
freebies,34ui8w,raayzo,7,Mon May 4 20:01:08 2015 UTC,I've been getting it from them for the last month or so.

freebies,34ui8w,lolo210,2,Tue May 5 06:06:13 2015 UTC,"This is sick. I got this, People en Espanol (They say the best way to learn is...) and Field and Stream (Not the best way to learn but maybe useful at some point). The last two were offered in the section with all the yes and no offers, and seem to be legit as well.   This is pretty awesome! I hope I get them. I did one of these from a different place like 3 months ago (for Wired) and I haven't gotten it yet, which is a bummer, but it seems like this will actually happen! SICK!  Edit: Called Wired. They said I'm good to go and should get the June issue next month. AWESOMEEEEE"

freebies,34trio,tchai,5,Mon May 4 14:24:16 2015 UTC,FYI Some of the options will disqualify you from the sample.  Prevacid 24HR and 4-6 times per week worked for me.
