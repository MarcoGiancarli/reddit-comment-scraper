bigfoot,3e40h2,clancydog4,2,Wed Jul 22 03:22:21 2015 UTC,"I've seen it before but I'm struggling to find the source. I remember it was a pretty long video, maybe 3 minutes long. And it's some guy with his friends in some sort of camp filming this thing walking from tree to tree but staying quite well hidden, at the end one of them says to the other ""it's bigfoot dude"". But I also remember reading somewhere later that it was a hoax and had something to do with promotion for a movie. Anyway I'll keep searching and hopefully find it."

I don't know if anyone has conclusively determined whether the Erickson footage is legitimate or not - but even if the footage is real, it doesn't help with much.  The sleeping shot doesn't show anything useful or beneficial.  And, if that facial shot is real, then it is either extremely coincidental that this Bigfoot happens to look strikingly similar to Chewie, or George Lucas already knew of their existence, and blatantly ripped off the creature design knowing that they would be kept under wraps and his idea would seem original - which, is kinda sorta plausible, lol."

bigfoot,3drs7g,Lindarama,3,Sun Jul 19 21:19:58 2015 UTC,The first picture of prints looks like cow or sheep foot prints. There are some strange depressions but could be where an animal has sat or simply the area sinking from under their weight.

Depending upon how openminded you are, several things come to mind...some people claim that ETs drop Sasquatch off in various locations, so they could just be visiting, or doing some work for them, or, there are portals and vortexes all around the world...we don't know how to access them, but some beings do...and it is possible that they just live there, poaching sheep, and living underground til night...just as the Sasquatch people have lived alongside us here in North America all along, with the vast majority of people totally oblivious to their presence. Our species of human is very belief driven and focussed, missing everything around us most of the time, especially if it doesn't fit into the prevailing consensus reality. I enjoyed the beauty of your countryside very much. Thanks again for your contribution."

bigfoot,3drs7g,fenrisx,2,Mon Jul 20 07:18:47 2015 UTC,In the pic of yourself I can spot a figure (obviously a person) in the field to the right that's at the bottom of the hill you are standing on. The color of his clothing is the same as the figures in the riverbed pics. There is also a sheep very close to the figure in the riverbed. Maybe a shepherd? Maybe another person sight seeing taking pics? Just some observations.
bigfoot,3drs7g,fenrisx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:58:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah that guy was a guy walking up the path we were walking down, we had a brief chat with him.  The other person/creature, yeah the sheep is looking at him. Doubt it's a shepard though, we don't really have those in the UK. If it was a farmer after his sheep he would have had sheep dog with him and wouldn't have been stood in the river.  I forgot to mention, after we got to the bottom of the hill and went past a farm it had 5 sheepdogs all in cages. They barked a bit as we went past but once we got about 500m away they went absolutely mental, sounded like one of them was being killed the noises they were making. Both my friends were creeped out by it too.  The farm with the dogs was pretty much at the bottom of the river where I took the photo of the person in black/creature."
bigfoot,3drs7g,aazav,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:11:33 2015 UTC,"No, just stop. Most, if not all, of the UK has been walked through, there are places in the US which haven't been touched plus there is a long history and plausibility of BF."

bigfoot,3dobpx,Hawkeye3284,14,Fri Jul 17 22:21:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not suggesting there isn't something to this, but, is there any chance this was a Beaver-Tail, slapping the water?   I've been in the area, night-fishing having had Beaver in close proximity, not happy with our leisure activities in their vicinity. Had we not happened to catch a solid glimpse of them, we would have been pretty freaked out. But, the sound is incredibly loud and creates a massive splash. Usually followed by them diving right under the water and swimming away."
bigfoot,3dobpx,coachzero,2,Sat Jul 18 02:43:50 2015 UTC,I came here to say beaver also.
bigfoot,3dobpx,dvboy,2,Sat Jul 18 13:40:09 2015 UTC,I just like to say beaver.
bigfoot,3dobpx,SkanksForTheMemories,2,Sun Jul 19 03:23:11 2015 UTC,"Honest question since I've never been anywhere remotely close to a wild beaver - any idea how likely it is they'd slap the water three (seemingly very deliberate) times before swimming off? From what I've seen that beaver behavior struck me as a ""BOO! I'm outta here sucker!"" type of thing..."
bigfoot,3dobpx,Treedom_Lighter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:21:26 2015 UTC,"Sounds exactly like territorial beaver behavior. I've seen it in both small, fast moving water, and larger lakes. Usually at dusk or after dark. They will smack their tails once, leave the area for a bit, then come back and do it again about 15 minutes later.   Sounds like a 25 pound boulder being catapulted into the water. Amazing how much force they can put into smacking the water.   I'd say unless you saw the rocks hitting the water, this might be a viable explanation. Others who have experienced similar actions have seen the rocks flying in from the trees, which adds another layer of complexity."
bigfoot,3dobpx,sippysippy13,7,Tue Jul 21 14:41:02 2015 UTC,Wow. I've never really looked at a satellite map of Iowa. The whole state is covered in grids and it all looks farmed. Amazing. I didn't  see any huge nature reserves or national parks though. Is there enough wilderness for a community of bigfoot to live and hide in?
bigfoot,3dobpx,Cenbe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:13:30 2015 UTC,Corn would provide plenty of cover and an endless supply of feed. I think bigfoot could very easily live in Iowa.
bigfoot,3dobpx,masseyfarmer8690,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:34:18 2015 UTC,Corn isnt a year round crop though. And every year it gets plowed under and replanted.
bigfoot,3dobpx,Cenbe,0,Mon Jul 20 16:36:22 2015 UTC,"There's drainage ditches, slivers of woods, etc. Not to mention open barns/sheds for them to shelter in. Plenty of cover, and they can eat spilled corn around loading areas as well. So yes, it is possible."
bigfoot,3dobpx,masseyfarmer8690,5,Mon Jul 20 17:01:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to say it was a Sasquatch, but having near identical occurrences, I would say you may have encountered a Sasquatch that night."
bigfoot,3dobpx,TinyEars7,4,Fri Jul 17 22:25:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was just incredibly strange.  I should also add, this was around 12 or 12:30AM on a Wednesday night.  If it was somebody messing with us, they would have had to walk through at least 2 miles of just timber and downed trees.....and ticks.  My dad agreed it sounded like rocks being thrown in the water.  My dad said it best, either there is something strange over there moving, and throwing heavy objects, or there's a human over there throwing heavy objects.  Given the time and place, either situation is creepy."
bigfoot,3dobpx,fabricator01,3,Fri Jul 17 23:51:28 2015 UTC,"Easy way to tell if it's human, just yell, ""if you don't quit throwing shit in the water I'm gonna pull out my pistol and open up in your direction"".

Dave Paulides has written four Missing 411 books, and if you've heard any of the coast to coast interviews or seen any of the youTube videos, it's not hard to see that Bigfoot could be involved in some of these cases. Here are some links."
bigfoot,3dn6cp,sniggity,3,Fri Jul 17 17:26:22 2015 UTC,"I got the same email.  It's funny because in just a couple of hours it went from $850.00 to $13,551.  Lol"
bigfoot,3dn6cp,sniggity,4,Fri Jul 17 18:32:08 2015 UTC,"Yea, I noticed that too. I've got his two bigfoot books and one 411 book that I've enjoyed, so I just donated and look forward to the movie."

bigfoot,3dn6cp,ghostdate,2,Wed Jul 22 04:01:11 2015 UTC,"Les is featured. I'll definately watch the movie. As to fact bending - no doubt that many years of trying to make everyone believe what you yourself believe with a passion, will make you do stupid stuff. But 411 is entertaining in the very least. And even if half of the cases are conciously or inconciously mended to fit the profile - it's the others that should give incentive for the oponents to do some investigation themselves."
bigfoot,3dn6cp,Lindarama,-1,Sat Jul 18 12:14:26 2015 UTC,"While David Paulides, nor myself believe it's Bigfoot, at least not in the majority of these cases. The Missing 411 series is very interesting and I'd love to see a documentary and some progress in the case.  This might have been the wrong choice of sub for you to post in, but I hope it doesn't get downvoted into oblivion, because the Missing 411 project is very interesting and the amount of work David Paulides has put into researching it is immense, and I think deserving of support.  Some people might not see how intriguing the cases are just from the trailer. I recommend listening to David's appearances on Coast2CoastAM, Dreamland, Darkness Radio, etc. You'll start to see just how eerie the and unnatural some of these disappearances are."

bigfoot,3dn6cp,sniggity,2,Fri Jul 17 18:26:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think it will be downvoted. I think most of the active members here have expressed interest in Paulides' work at one time or another, whether it be critical or not."
bigfoot,3dn6cp,ghostdate,3,Fri Jul 17 21:24:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was in the negatives when I had made that comment, I think that was just a couple of people that didn't like the advertising aspect of the post."
bigfoot,3dn6cp,sniggity,2,Fri Jul 17 21:42:14 2015 UTC,"Has he said that he doesn't think it's bigfoot?  Because I've never heard him say either way.  In fact, in his books it's actually implied a few times that it is indeed Bigfoot.  I'm not trying to sound condescending, I'm seriously asking if you've heard his opinion on the matter and if so, where?  Because he's been tight lipped about it in everything I've heard him on.  Thanks"
bigfoot,3dn6cp,ghostdate,5,Fri Jul 17 18:30:46 2015 UTC,"It was an interview with George Knapp I believe where they were discussing possibilities, and he said he doesn't think it's just one thing, which would imply at the very least they're not all Bigfoot. I'll agree that some do sound that way, like the Martin case, but others, like the boy that was taken into a cave by a robotic clone of his grandma and told to poop on some sticky paper, they sound like something outside of anything I've heard of before. Plus there's all the ones where it looks like the victim was picked up 100s of feet in the air and just dropped. So I think it's fairly well established that whatever is going on, it's more than just Bigfoot, or just UFOs."
bigfoot,3dn6cp,pm_your_squatch,2,Fri Jul 17 19:33:58 2015 UTC,"Oh absolutely, I've always thought it was a few different things taking these people, too .

Remember the woman who said she saw weird looking people hiding behind bushes and trees watching her and when she got close to them, they would move away from her? Weird...  Anyways, I just didn't know if he's ever gone on record with his opinion on it.  Thanks for the heads up, I'll check out the Knapp interviews again."
bigfoot,3dn6cp,sniggity,2,Fri Jul 17 22:21:11 2015 UTC,"Oh, yes. There's several cases with some really spooky interdimensional qualities. I believe it was Mt. Shasta where a man went missing for a few hours and when he came back he had like a weeks worth of beard growth and was talking about people in the mountain or something like that. Those sort of cases seem extremely interesting to me, especially when they're tied into locations with a history of weird events, like Mount Shasta and the Lemurians that supposedly live inside of it"
bigfoot,3dn6cp,pm_your_squatch,0,Fri Jul 17 23:35:35 2015 UTC,Has he said that he doesn't think it's bigfoot?   multiple times in interviews
bigfoot,3dn6cp,bowskieightcats,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:42:18 2015 UTC,"Really? I've never heard him say it at all.  Because I've listened to lots of his interviews and never heard him say that.  Not being a dick, but can you cite an interview that you may remember? Because I've just been really anxious to hear his opinion on the matter.  Especially because he has alluded to it being Bigfoot in a few cases.  Not to mention, as soon as you go to his site, there is a picture of Bigfoot staring at you on the front page.    I also read an interview recently and he stated that while he thinks Bigfoot is a real, living being, it hinders his investigations because of the fact so few believe in Bigfoot and it's never been a scientifically verified entity. I just wish I knew who or what was taking these poor people. I know that if Bigfoot is involved, I think it's responsible for a very low percentage of disappearances.  I feel it could be numerous things causing these people's demise.  So terrible..."
bigfoot,3dn6cp,sniggity,2,Sun Jul 19 17:50:12 2015 UTC,"Weird, I've listened to a lot of his interviews too and in the recent ones he's dismissed bigfoot for various reasons and sometimes suggests it's more inter-dimensional portals or something like that, I'll try dig up some youtube examples when I have time. I know he's written books on bigfoot and thinks it's real though. Personally I think BF might be to blame for some of the cases, there was a case recently of a former football player who went missing and died and did call his wife beforehand and told her he was being followed by something, local residents said that he must have spooked a BF and it went for him."
bigfoot,3dn6cp,Lindarama,-2,Sun Jul 19 22:38:19 2015 UTC,"Considering the liberties Paulides has taken with the stories he includes in the books, I hope this movie is classified as nothing but fiction.

Good example, his dismissal of paradoxical undressing when someone is experiencing hypothermia.  Was it on Coast to Coast that he completely blew off a caller who suggested it?   Still, I find it all really interesting. I just take it with a grain of salt. At the very least, it's making people consider what unknown things might be happening in national parks."
bigfoot,3dn6cp,pm_your_squatch,5,Fri Jul 17 20:52:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, I believe he said ""well, they call it paradoxical, because it doesn't make sense"" and just left it at that.

TL;dr, the range of these vocalizations are what make them so impressive. The high-pitched whistles as well as the grunts and whoops and samurai chatter were all made by vocal tracts that don't match known animals but actually suggest something between monkey and really big human.   There's a video below of a member in the subreddit copying some of the noises (and it's wicked impressive by the way) but when you really compare the two, the range of the sounds (not to mention the vocal-whistles) is simply too much for a single person to duplicate."

It sounds like a Samurai so why not just call it that and not throw in ""politically incorrect"" term.

Blue refers to the leather side of a skin indicating an un-prime condition.This term can be used to refer to any species.I belive(correct me if I am wrong)That as a animal developes a new coat of underfur in the fall extra blood in routed to the fur folicals that produce the underfur.If the animal dies before the underfur is completely developed this extra blood is trapped in the leather at the time of death.This will turn the pelt a dark color as it dries ie.blue.Once the underfur is fully developed this exta blood is no longer present and the pelt will have an off-white color ie.prime.So the ""blue"" pelt is an indicator that the underfur is not fully developed,which results in a lower value for blue pelts in general.Skins can also be over prime,the pelt is prime but the fur is showing wear&tear from a winters use.Also note that pelt primeness and fur quality do not match up exactly ex.a nov. caught mink with a slighty off color pelt will generally have more value than a Feb.caught mink with a fully prime pelt because of fur quality.      The skin appears dark because of what could be simply described as ""active"" hair follicles. As is fairly obvious, most furbearer's hair doesn't grow continuously (like humans-'angora'), but reaches a certain length and stops ('definitive'). Hair follicles become dark as hair is growing (and the base of the hair is usually dark). Once the growth is complete, the folicles become 'inactive' and the skin (and bases of the hair) become white--the skin is prime. Dark (usually blue appearing) pelts simply indicate the critter is still growing hair-at least in places (most critters start to molt in one area (usually the belly) and continue to the other side).  I'm not certain what chemical actually causes the dark coloration, but I doubt that its blood. Growing hair (or anything else) certainly requires lots of things that are delivered by blood, and circulation is increased (which also increases temperature for epidermal cell regeneration). I doubt that in itself would be enough to make unprime skins look like they do. My guess is melanin is most of what you see, but I'm just too lazy to go look it up right now.  smile If anyone is energetic enough to find out please post it here.   http://sullivansline.com/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=20970"
bigfoot,3djni3,Lindarama,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:19:56 2015 UTC,Very interesting! Thanks for elaborating.
bigfoot,3djni3,steubenville_rapist,2,Fri Jul 17 21:06:45 2015 UTC,"I am fairly new to this sub. Longtime BF enthusiast.  This was a long listen but well worth it, in my opinion.  I think Bugs comes across as highly credible.  The way in which he recounts certain details of his story without hesitation really adds credence to the whole account.  There were several points where you could almost see him replaying the events in his mind in order to find the right phrase or adjective to use.  He was also very firm on the chronology/details and obviously knows his stuff, as far as the outdoors are concerned. Beyond that, I found it interesting that Bugs talked about both the male and female having six toes.  Although it doesn't necessarily fit in with other purported castings/evidence (save for the one anecdote that Robert provided about the Arkansas family who had the ""six toe genetic code""), Bugs recalled that detail very matter-of-fact sort of way.  He even expected Robert to know that the creatures had six toes, and seemed surprised to learn that this isn't the norm among other recorded BFs. Overall, I thought it was a good listen.  With BF, for me, my belief doesn't stem from any personal encounter.  Nor has any family member or friend had one.  I haven't spent what I would call significant time in the woods.  But stories like Bugs' are like small logs that stoke the fire of my belief; despite the lack of tangible evidence or recognition by the scientific community, I find the idea of a Sasquatch population fascinating and increasingly plausible with each new story."
bigfoot,3djni3,ghostdate,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:00:46 2015 UTC,"The thing about the six toes is a prevalent idea in Bigfoot lore. I think part of it is a carry-over from the idea of the biblical nephilim having six toes and six fingers. Abnormal digit variations go back to at least the Fouke monster/Boggy Creek, so it's not that compelling that he said it.  Im on the fence about his story, but it is definitely very intriguing. I sure wish Art could just go dig them up already."

bigfoot,3djni3,wibblebeast,2,Fri Jul 17 04:30:34 2015 UTC,Doing a bit more research a lot of people seem to suspect Bugs is Ed Hale. I have to admit Hale's voice sounds remarkably similar. Hale is a Hilary Clinton supporter who very much dislikes Obama. He seems to have been involved with the birther movement.   Hale claims the government stole the body lol. He might be saying that just to get people off his back about it but he could be crazy. It's still a pretty good story even if this guy does seem pretty off the rails.   You can hear Hale's voice here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=14&v=1BjulCYLvrw  http://retrieverman.net/2011/06/13/the-man-who-killed-bigfoot/  http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread430615/pg1  http://www.bigfootlunchclub.com/2013/07/art-bell-returns-to-radio-september-16th.html
bigfoot,3djni3,Lindarama,2,Fri Jul 17 05:14:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. He sure does sound the same, and what a shame, because as ""Bugs"" he seems like a more sincere person than this Ed Hale character. All this might explain why nothing concrete was ever found."
bigfoot,3djni3,harley57078,2,Fri Jul 17 13:05:44 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... Definitely a very similar voice and the accent sounds spot on (to my non-native ears).  But on the TV interview linked above, he sounds much more growly. His voice contains a very low vocal register and as he speaks that growl resounds right throughout his responses.  That said, it's possible it's not picked up by a phone microphone.   Edit: read through rest of links. Turns out he's allegedly confessed to being Bugs. He's a real piece of work too :-/"

bigfoot,3d8bh6,Treedom_Lighter,2,Wed Jul 15 14:08:21 2015 UTC,"I heard what sounds like a bugle horn. The sustain can also be achieved by a human, we've seen it on FB plenty of times. I also cast doubt on the fact that a person wanting to capture deer on video would just set a camera constantly rolling in some dense bush in the forest. I'm no Crocodile Dundy but I would expect there to be an obvious game trail in the shot as well. My Bullshit-O-Meter is pegged on this one.  Edit: With that said though, I call BS on the video I posted the other day as well but it still sounded great so... Yeah. I don't know what I like."

bigfoot,3dahjt,PadLilly,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:24:00 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm going to assume you're referring to the ""Washington Environmental Atlas"" published in 1975. Have you actually read it? It was a small publication put out by a small Government entity in Washington, whose target audience for the atlas were tourists. It wasn't an official document. It stopped very short from acknowledging Sasquatch as a real species."
bigfoot,3dahjt,bowskieightcats,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:35:03 2015 UTC,What stops it from being an official document? It was a big budgeted official atlas funded by the government stating that the FBI had hair samples not matching any known animal.
bigfoot,3dahjt,PadLilly,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:10:23 2015 UTC,"hair samples not matching any known animal   This does not equal bigfoot. Why couldn't the hair be from a unicorn or a troll? Perhaps ""official document"" doesn't mean the same thing to both of us, but I believe Steven Streufert summed up the Atlas best. From bigfootbooksblog.blogspot.com:  The book brings up the Environmental Atlas for Washington, or “Provisional U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Environmental Reconnaissance Inventory of the State of Washington,” published by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1975. A lot is made of this publication, as if it proves official government recognition of the Sasquatch as a real animal. Rather, it can be taken as a slightly tongue-in-cheek presentation, but also seriously as a declaration that the creature has been REPORTED to be in Washington. The Atlas does not present this topic mockingly, and does indeed take it as a possibility that there could be something to all of the reports. It is clear, however, that the “very existence of Sasquatch… is hotly disputed,” as the Atlas states. From this point it refers repeatedly only to ALLEGED Bigfoot hair, “alleged sightings, tracks and other experiences.” It says these reports CONJURE UP the image of Bigfoot, implying a phantasm. It does not come out and SAY that the creature is actually KNOWN to be 8-12 feet tall, and so on. It is a PROVISIONAL statement. Other qualifying words used throughout this report include, “reported,” “apparently,” “if” and “generally considered.” It is also clearly reporting on what is, to the author, generally considered to be folk mythology or cultural belief particular to the region, which MIGHT have some basis in fact—might, only, is what they are saying: “If Sasquatch is purely legendary, the legend is likely to be a long time dying…. Legendary or actual, Sasquatch excites a great popular interest in Washington.” See, this Atlas includes cultural dimensions, and not just environmental facts. Also, this Atlas is not an official production of the entire USA government, nor a statement of official governmental or institutional policy. It is a regional side-project, done by a certain and limited agency of the government only. It is no more official policy than a particular wildlife study or environmental impact report done by someone working for the government."

bigfoot,3dahjt,goodbytes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:54:29 2015 UTC,"According to Peter Bryne of the Bigfoot Research Project in Mount Hood, he wrote to the FBI asking about it, and they replied:   ""Since the publication of the ""Washington Environmental Atlas"" in 1975, which referred to such examinations, we have received several inquiries similar to yours. However, we have been unable to locate any references to such examinations in our files.""  Apparently some other information was obtained by a Jody Cook through the freedom of information act. He recieved some documentation with this note attatched:   ""Enclosed are previously processed documents which relate to ""Big Foot."" The enclosed are the best copies available.

HOWEVER, I find it highly plausible that the government knows about the existence of Bigfoot.  ...  Oh god, I sound like a fruitcake don't I?  I just think that the Government knows about them, has taken one or two bodies via a professional operation to confirm it, and are keeping it under wraps to preserve the outdoor recreation industry. Because seriously, Bigfoot is a terrifying wild animal. Imagine your everyday Joe's reaction when he hears that there is a confirmed species of giant, neck-snapping ape beasts in the wild that sit right in the creepy valley between man and animal in appearance and behaviors.   Chances are, Joe would cancel his camping trip."

bigfoot,3cspgj,mzziz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:27:53 2015 UTC,I keep trying to listen to it. But every recent episode I've tried had pretty wonky stories. Like he's gotten lax on the screening process or something. I love the stories for the most part anyway. But it takes me out of it any time he starts commenting. Because he's a liar and all.
bigfoot,3cspgj,KeredYojepop,-1,Fri Jul 10 19:24:09 2015 UTC,"SC is just a place for people to go and get their weekly scary story fix, they could substitute in just about any crytid, An entertainment lawyer named Crenshaw from Texas owns the show. The on air asshole is a proven beyond all reasonable doubt hoaxer, he is now quite obviously scripting episodes on orders from the owner. If you like scary stories and are comfortable with a host who has been on ONE bigfoot hunt (Texas) and has been promising to get all the scary stories from that on the air for months now, (but he can't because nothing really happened) and who also constantly passes himself off as an expert instead of a hoaxer and compulsive liar. Have fun with all that, you will probably also enjoy Rick Dyers new show, ""My Life With Hank""."

Now look at this  Point is, one, there's so many places in this world where few humans have stepped foot, there's still tribes in Brazil who are not civilized, now think of Siberia, the largest area (half the world) with the smallest population per square acre. I believe in 'Bigfoot' because I don't believe he's just some giant ape walking around as shown in the media, this sub-reddit, and every location of every believer. I believe it's either human/ape/damn Neanderthal/Mountain people/ some sort of bi-pedal creature that has evolved in the wilderness. Humans can't be the only ones walking on two feet in this massive world. This bi-pedal creature or, bigfoot, is where humans don't want to go because of the challenge in getting there (bigfoot territory or not, who in their right mind would go to the middle of Siberia, or the mountains in Alaska? Sounds deadly itself!), there's not many people at all who've actually spent time in the woods/mountains (even the boundary waters in Northern Minnesota itself) where few people have gone before. That's why the potential is so large, I can't throw it out the window that it doesn't exist just yet."

bigfoot,3crpu0,fabricator01,2,Sat Jul 11 22:20:05 2015 UTC,"Sorry it took me so long to respond. My father and I had an experience that couldn't be explained by either one of us. A little background: My family has been logging professionally since prior to WWII. My father was taken to the woods from infancy, and worked as a logger during much of his adult life. This amounted to countless hours in the woods. I have always been the outdoorsy type, and have spent many hours in tree stands, on stream banks, and in wilderness camps. This particular evening, we were out riding around and decided to pull off on a gated Forestry road. We got out of the car and were just hanging around talking and listening to the forest. It was right around nightfall and was very quiet. One of us or the other made a loud howling/growling noise, just sort of a shout into the darkness. About 4 seconds later something very close to us (less than 50 yards) answered back. The sound started as a high pitched scream, which then lowered in pitch to something that one would imagine could only come from an animal with a huge barrel of a chest. The noise died down after what seemed like an impossibly long time, (maybe 25 or 30 seconds) definitely longer than a human could maintain that level of sound/howl. My dad and I didn't even say anything, we almost killed ourselves trying to get back into the car and sped out of there. The biggest thing was, we both experienced an instinctual reaction, like we knew that our only course of action was to get away from whatever that thing was. We have since listened to many recordings of many different animals that it could have been, and none have even come close to that sound. I can give you exact coordinates of where the encounter happened. ( 41°41'22.50""N,  77° 9'19.95""W)  tl/dr: Two very experienced woodsmen experienced a noise that couldn't be explained."
bigfoot,3crpu0,fabricator01,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:42:51 2015 UTC,Yeah but BC is a documented place with plenty of proof of its existence.  I'm more curious how you can be so sure? I'd like to hear your experience if you dont mind indulging me
bigfoot,3crpu0,ifvcu44,2,Sun Jul 12 02:12:35 2015 UTC,"One thing you have to come to terms with in Bigfoot, is that this thing is elusive to an almost magical degree.  That's why it's been able to exist for as long as it has, to the modern day, even, in a populated country like the US.  It takes almost no chances, and the moment something is out of place, it will spot you first and leave without thinking twice.  That's my theory, at least."

You may not have noticed my presence here  as frequently as Treedom's, but I check this sub at least once a day and enjoy reading through every comment and submission.   I felt more than a little lost the last couple days with it being down.   I also live in a different time zone from Canada/US (I'm in Australia), so in terms of coverage, I think between the two of us we can work together and have a consistent presence as moderators of this sub."

bigfoot,3cb9y9,Lindarama,4,Mon Jul 6 22:09:15 2015 UTC,"Hah, thanks! Can't say I've seen any evidence of Yowies myself, but I live on the island state of Tasmania where there are swathes untouched and dense forest on the west and south-west coasts that experience little to no interference by humans.  We already have a number of species that have evolved here on their own (e.g. Tasmanian Devil and Tasmanian Tiger) so I think Tassie is a pretty prime location for creatures like the Yowie to exist.   That said, I've yet to come across online any compelling evidence for Yowies - well, at least nothing that is on par with what we see come from Canada/US."

bigfoot,3bybwh,warriorfortruth,2,Mon Jul 6 18:09:27 2015 UTC,"Awesome!  I live and grew up on property that borders the Wayne, and I've had a number of odd experiences in the woods, only one bigfoot related though.  Last fall I went out to my car to grab something really late at night, at least 2am, and just as I was fumbling with the door to my house to come back inside, I heard a siren/like moan, pretty similar to The Ohio Howl(which I wasn't familiar with at the time).  I'm an Eagle Scout and I grew up camping and playing in the woods, so I'm pretty familiar with the normal sounds of wildlife in the area, but I'd never head anything like this.  It freaked me out quite a bit, enough to spend my free time the next couple days looking at bigfoot stuff on the internet, where, to my horror/excitement, I discovered The Ohio Howl to which it was incredibly similar.  The only ""normal"" thing I can imagine it being is a cow, but I've also grown up around cows, and I don't think that's what it was.  It also came from the direction of the Wayne, where nobody lives or keeps cows, although cow escapes aren't exactly unheard of in the area. Wayne National is a huge area, what's the closest town that you're going to be working near? My only suggestion would be to arm yourself somehow.  Most of the locals are good people, but I've been hearing stories of people being robbed on public lands a bit lately, and supposedly a man was raped by a stranger at Burr Oak State park within the past year.  I usually hike alone, and it's been enough to make me think twice about doing that."

We couldn't even find this scene in the episodes. So it's either in an old episode of regular Survivorman and was mislabeled or was somehow never released.  Just informing anyone who wanted to look at actual video footage, if you really want you could go through all the old episodes to try and find it. I've found the quickest way is just skip through and look at what outfit he's wearing. Plus you can narrow it down by environment.  Personally, I can't tell if it's a log or Sasquatch (or something else). The quality isn't great and it's out of focus. A log is most likely but I can't confirm it.

I read a while back a description given by a person who viewed the whole film. That's probably BS though. It was kind of interesting reading the account. He said there was a hunting party with Paterson and Gimlin that tracked this group for a while and ambushed them at a watering hole.
bigfoot,3ba6qk,ViralOner,2,Sun Jun 28 02:27:25 2015 UTC,Isn't that MK Davis' theory?
bigfoot,3ba6qk,ViralOner,2,Sun Jun 28 15:56:42 2015 UTC,I think so. And it's probably BS. I read the same thing he did a few years ago. It was buried on some message board on some website. A guy who was a musician or worked for a recording studio happened to sit in on a viewing of the film. Prior he had no interest in BF. Something along those lines. I did see MKD had a video not too long ago with the same story but I generally cant listen to him for more than a few minutes. I'm going to go back and listen to his video and see if it jives with the story I read a few years ago.
bigfoot,3ba6qk,ViralOner,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:52:50 2015 UTC,That sounds interesting... The story of that guy sitting in on the viewing of the Patterson film. Did he say something similar to MK Davis' theory?
bigfoot,3ba6qk,bowskieightcats,2,Sun Jun 28 21:00:26 2015 UTC,I've got to find that particular MKD video and sit through 20 or so minutes of his dry commentary and see. Wish I could find that old message board thread and post it. I think Davis shared more info about the hunting party(who/why) and showed a pic of the hunting dogs and possible blood. The musician guy described the ambush and the carnage of killing a few individuals. Every time I see the Patty film I think about her actions in that context. It kind of fits. But then again by all accounts BF can haul ass so why wouldn't she have tore out of there at a full sprint?

These bottles are produced from polyethylene terephthalate, also known as PET plastic, using the blow molding process. Bottle labels consist of a printed, tight-fitted plastic sleeve. A resealable screw-top allows the contents to be used at various times while retaining carbonation.  In the United States, the two liter bottle is one of the few cases where a product is sold by a round number of metric units. Since very few other beverages are sold in this exact quantity, the term ""two-liter"" in American English almost invariably refers to a soft drink bottle. Other common metric sizes for plastic soft drink bottles include 500 milliliters, 1 liter and 3 liters.  In some other countries like Russia plastic bottles are used for selling beer as well.

It is usually defined as a head circumference (HC) more than two standard deviations below the mean for age and gender.   Some academics advocate defining it as head circumference more than three standard deviations below the mean for the age and sex.  Microcephaly may be congenital or it may develop in the first few years of life. The disorder may stem from a wide variety of conditions that cause abnormal growth of the brain, or from syndromes associated with chromosomal abnormalities. A homozygous mutation in one of the microcephalin genes causes primary microcephaly.

If at some point in history, such a man couldn't take the ribbing and broke off on his own, he might have formed some small group of misfits who banded together and eventually bred. This could happen anywhere, at any time. Their culture might have become very insular and completely based on avoiding the dominant humans, who probably would kill them if at all possible, human nature being what it is. Such a tribe could have formed any time after civilization formed, and would have had many generations to not only shape a culture, but maybe lock in large size and hirsuteness."

In the clips of him walking alone he looks really tall but I think that's his bone structure/body movement. One of the only 2 articles I found that may be about him (Lu Yuguang) say he's 80 cm (2'7"") and had two other siblings that looked similar.

You can see in the video he is sitting on the ground next to his mother who is on a chair and he isn't much below her in height. Also at the 34 second mark he is reaching down to someones hand to take something from them, they are much lower than he is.   I'm not saying this is a hybrid of a person and a Yeren (hell we'd have to prove a Yeren even existed) but the physical characteristics, beyond brain size, don't seem to match Microcephaly where people have very tiny brains, and normal size faces but aren't larger people.

I agree that he looks tall but only in the clips of him by himself, which made me think it may be the way he moves. In the last video clip of OPs link it shows him standing with a hunched back and hands out about two feet in front of an old lady and theyre the same height."
bigfoot,3ayi4y,Pangs,2,Wed Jun 24 20:21:49 2015 UTC,"The microcephaly was most likely due to inbreeding, similar to Pakistani rat people.  There is no reason to stretch for an explanation.

bigfoot,3ageas,Treedom_Lighter,2,Tue Jun 23 17:34:04 2015 UTC,"That's awesome man! Thanks for sharing. You should do a google image search for ""bigfoot face"" and show him some, and see if he finds any that remind him of what he saw.   Maybe something like this one.   There aren't a ton of sightings from Rhode Island, but there definitely are some. That's super cool though make sure you tell him how lucky he is if he really did see one!"
bigfoot,3ageas,bibLLiosoph,5,Fri Jun 19 23:58:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I must say I am a little jealous he may have spotted one. Next time we see them, hopefully within a week while his memory is fresh, I am going to ask him to draw what he saw. After that I may show him some pictures, but I don't want to taint his memory before he draws anything. I will try to share the results if I get something good."
bigfoot,3ageas,Treedom_Lighter,5,Sat Jun 20 00:10:46 2015 UTC,Be careful not to 'lead the witness'.  I'd refrain from showing him any 'bigfoot face' images until maybe you've asked him to draw what he saw?  Otherwise how can you say your images didn't just enforce the idea? Rather then eliciting a pure memory.  Just my two cents...
bigfoot,3ageas,Uncomfortably_Lucid,3,Sat Jun 20 05:57:06 2015 UTC,That's what I intend to do. Let him draw something before seeing anything.
bigfoot,3afoa9,The_UFO_Conundrum,7,Fri Jun 19 19:24:15 2015 UTC,What's new to me is that Bigfoot uses underground cave systems to get from place to place.
bigfoot,3afoa9,doctorphyco,6,Fri Jun 19 22:51:39 2015 UTC,Caving must be difficult as a 7-foot hairy beast.
bigfoot,3afoa9,Pangs,2,Sat Jun 20 00:41:03 2015 UTC,"How good a climber is Bigfoot? Can't they move quickly up steep slopes? Chimps and Orangutans are powerful for their size and excellent climbers, but Bigfoot is often thought to weigh more than a Gorilla. There seem to be two methods to estimate their mass: eyewitness assessments and calculations from footprint depth. I have done a lot of estimating of animal size, doublechecking when possible, and my experience plus looking at testimony leads me to question how accurate our database of Sasquatch size actually is.   The footprint calculations are questionable because the few tests that I have read (say, in Meldrum's book) were not done at the same time as when Sasquatch walked through. Soil conditions at the surface change fairly rapidly at times. Also, the way in which a foot strikes the soil can vary. Sasquatch is large, but HOW large? Could we be looking at Shaq-sized creatures, max? Are the 9-foot-tall, half-a-ton estimates gross exaggerations?"
bigfoot,3afoa9,doctorphyco,4,Sat Jun 20 20:47:19 2015 UTC,"From what I have read, Sasquatch is an excellent climber, easily climbing redwoods, cliffs, etc. Also, they are known to live in caves, as well as making impromptu beds from moss and ferns.  I am convinced they are a type of human. First, the native americans all thought so. Second, DNA tests either came back as human on the mother's side, or were considered 'contaminated' by human DNA. They communicate with language, make tools, rear their young in family units. There are many types of what we call Sasquatch, some hairier than others, some with more contemporary looking features, as they have interbred with humans through the years. I am dismayed by the hunters who look upon them as possible trophies. They should be regarded in the same way as other 'primitive' tribes recently located in distant jungles.  If you read the accounts written by Arla Williams, KT Blount, Salli Wolford, Keith Bearden, Lori Bossert, Kewaunee Lapseritis, Thom Cantrell, Robb Riggs- it seems that all the Sasquatch really want from us is a little respect.  Because they are people, some of them can be dangerous, some of them can be cannibals. For the most part, it seems they just want their space, and some respect, and to be left alone.   ""Science"" doesn't demand a body...just some greedy egomaniacs."
bigfoot,3afoa9,mzziz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:30:54 2015 UTC,"Why do you think they are so large, or do you think maybe a lot of the size estimates are exaggerations? (it might be hard to accurately assess size when the hair is standing up on your neck)"
bigfoot,3afoa9,doctorphyco,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:43:20 2015 UTC,"What's up with those tunnel entrances? They look like stone and mortar or brick and mortar.

'Cause if bigfoot can do masonry - wait a minute - bigfoot, freemasons - it all makes sense!"
bigfoot,3a23jj,JoeCormier,14,Tue Jun 16 17:04:11 2015 UTC,"Most widely accepted theory: They're an extant descendant of Gigantopithecus blacki. The size and shape would be accurate, and their documented behaviors (such as rock-throwing, branch-breaking, howls, whoops, screams, growls, etc.) all coincide with known great ape behavior.   What I think: They're Windows98 versions of humans, or a line of humans that evolved into the rugged terrain of mountains, swamps and forests. There are many reports of what sounds an awful lot like spoken language (as opposed to territorial and social whoops and grunts of the known great apes). For more info on this, I recommend googling the Sierra Sounds and R. Scott Nelson. The extreme intelligence I think it would take to remain so well-hidden and avoid things like howling bigfoot researchers and trail cameras is explained pretty easily if they are a species of homo (giggle).  I used to believe they could be empathic in some capacity, given that SO many witnesses report feelings of being watched, or not being wanted, etc. when they encounter these creatures. However, the person I probably debate the most in this subreddit out of anyone brought up an interesting and highly plausible alternative to this: That they're able to produce smells with biological recipes to produce certain feelings in the animals around them. This is actually documented in other species, and could tie into the strange and sometimes awful smells that witnesses report during close encounters with bigfoots.   Those are the two big theories, and inter-dimensional/alien theories are far less common and far less evidence-based. I would never say ""never,"" because I've learned not to have that kind of mindset anymore after learning that bigfoots were real, but I'd need to see quite a bit more evidence that there's anything to these ideas than pure conjecture off a limited number of witness reports."
bigfoot,3a23jj,Treedom_Lighter,4,Tue Jun 16 17:37:48 2015 UTC,"Well said.  I think a lot of the weirdness is people encountering something way outside their comfort zone and the brain has a way of filling in gaps of what is essentially a traumatic experience.  Seriously, I'd probably blank out if I saw something I knew shouldn't exist."
bigfoot,3a23jj,Fsoprokon,3,Thu Jun 18 07:56:25 2015 UTC,"Infra-smells eh? That's an interesting hypothesis. All of the theories I'd heard before were sound based, as some people recall hearing a low growl that sort of hypnotized them, but that could just be a misinterpretation, or a combination of factors, like a smell that effects emotions or mental states, in conjunction with infra-sounds."

bigfoot,3a23jj,Treedom_Lighter,9,Tue Jun 16 17:55:18 2015 UTC,Giganto was around at the right time and the right place to have migrated across the bering strait when it was still a temperate forest climate. There's no reasonable way to rule out the possibility that sasquatches could be a descendant of giganto.
bigfoot,3a23jj,fenrisx,-3,Tue Jun 16 18:15:00 2015 UTC,Bullshit. There's no fossil evidence and the ape that is Giganto has no evidence that it ever left China. It's a desperate attempt top fill a gap that fall flat. There's every reasonable means to laugh at the Giganto theory.
bigfoot,3a23jj,Treedom_Lighter,9,Wed Jun 17 10:54:24 2015 UTC,"We have like two pieces of jaw and a few teeth to tell us the species existed at all. By your logic, there's no evidence there was ever more than two or three members of that species ever.  Of course, it's not intelligent to try and draw habitat and behavior conclusions off of a few bone pieces, so I don't know why you presume to call bullshit on something that no one really knows about.   At the time the giganto species was around, the Bering Strait was an arboreal land mass, and IF some of this species followed some of the humans migrating across, then yes, giganto could have made it to North America."

I literally JUST said I can't prove it is and I don't even think it is myself. But it was in the place at the right time so that it could be a plausible scenario, and the sightings match up size-wise to G. blacki."

bigfoot,3a23jj,fenrisx,2,Wed Jun 17 14:16:34 2015 UTC,"We can't expect to find fossil evidence for everything, especially of fairly uncommon species that lived for shorter periods of time. We KNOW that Gigantopithecus existed, yet fossil evidence is scanty. If they migrated, and especially if they lived in temperate rainforest, few fossils would be preserved. Also, if Gigantopithecus's relatives were coastal-dwelling, everything got covered up by sea level rise."

Yes, that's the simplistic ""no Bigfoot"" dogma popular in mainstream halls of milquetoast conformity and in limpwristed pontifications at the Café Bourgeois. Some of us prefer a little more adventure in our lives.  Although I guess if you REALLY want adventure, you are ready to deal with aliens, shapeshifters, interdimensional portals, and psychic warfare.  The evidence points to some kind of ape. The question is where did it branch off the currently-accepted family tree? Down near Orangutans and Gigantopithecus? Or somewhere near Neanderthals? Or in between? This is where you need some serious understanding of ecology, primatology, evolution, and ethology. If you want to light that candle, you're going to need a match."

bigfoot,3a23jj,fenrisx,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:59:01 2015 UTC,"Red panda teeth have been found in the US, a species which today is isolated to Asia. That shows that animals from the same time period, region and, indeed, habitat as G. Blacki were able to migrate to North America while a land bridge existed.   As already mentioned, forests provide very poor environments for fossilisation, primarily because of the acidity of the soil, as well as scavengers etc. There are few examples of fossil black bears, a widespread species, for instance.  Vertebrate palaeontology has a lot of missing pieces; it's reasonable to be skeptical of bigfoot, but it's not that reasonable to be skeptical because of the fossil record."
bigfoot,3a23jj,Aquapig,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:49:53 2015 UTC,"Your ""point"" doesnt make the possibility any less remote. It's wishful thinking trying to fill a gap with a solution that fails."

Going for the least likely and least plausible idea is sloppy in every sense and much of why the mainstream doesn't take the subject seriously.   A tropical, herbivorous ape had no reason, or prompting to just uproot and travel to North America, it's really not that hard unless you want to cling to the absurd."

Pinecones, branches, and fruits fall from trees. Rocks come loose from cliffs and bound down steep terrain. Squirrels drop things they are gnawing on. And, people DO throw all sorts of items.

bigfoot,3a23jj,darkehawk14,2,Thu Jun 18 01:19:59 2015 UTC,"The giganto theory is pure pie in the sky non educated guessing at best, at worst it's just plain bullshit.  The only fossil record of giganto a couple of teeth and part a a jawbone from caves in south east Asia, to extrapolate what is thought to have been a plant eater to a carnivorous creature that would have to have crossed the Bearing lang bridge is just plain preposterous.  They are without doubt an animal that is somewhere between us and the great apes on the tree."

bigfoot,3a1rul,PussyMasterDeluxe,3,Tue Jun 16 23:11:10 2015 UTC,Yeah most people keep their tent door closed to make sure bugs and other vermin don't get in. Setting up a game cam in your own tent is weird.  I'm trying to find confirmation online of a Moultrie game camera with 10 second delay. Can't find anything on it.

bigfoot,3a1rul,Pangs,2,Tue Jun 16 16:21:16 2015 UTC,"A simple explanation would be they were excited about what they captured and uploaded it ASAP, and then did a recreation when people started suggesting it was CGI or a guy in a suit."
bigfoot,3a1rul,bowskieightcats,3,Tue Jun 16 16:45:52 2015 UTC,"The link stated that the video of the people walking was taken ""less than an hour before"" the video of the alleged bigfoot was captured.  My question was mostly rhetorical as I don't really expect they have a good answer.    I want people who expect to be taken seriously to present evidence more logically.  Notations about distances, equipment, etc.  This should have included a daytime photo of the location.  The full video or at least more than the snippet we are allowed to see.  I am suspect of everything and the more info people like me are given, the more likely we are to accept that what is presented is done so in good faith.  As is, the majority leave the impression we are dealing with people who are not necessarily competent, not serious enough to be identifying anything in the woods, or are straight up full of shit."

bigfoot,39zctt,doctorphyco,3,Tue Jun 16 03:33:26 2015 UTC,"None of the samples that were tested were from this species.  A whole bunch of samples were thrown out that didn't supply sufficient material to produce DNA. Unfortunately, according to Jeff Meldrum, the BFRO and a couple of DNA-guys whose names I can't remember at the moment (but work with the aforementioned researchers) all agree sasquatch hairs lack a cellular medulla, which is where most of the viable DNA comes from in other animal hairs. This makes it extremely difficult to test them for DNA.  However, the real question about this study is why Bryan Sykes tested hairs from multiple known species when it was totally unnecessary. A simple microscope should have been enough to rule out the ones that came back as porcupine, horse, bear and coyote. But, they were still tested. I'd like to know why."
bigfoot,39zctt,Treedom_Lighter,2,Tue Jun 16 14:18:20 2015 UTC,"From what I saw, Sykes remains open to the possibility of undocumented hominoids. Which suggests they weren't trying to to characterize Bigfoot enthusiasts as wild-eyed nutcases who think every whoop, broken stick, fallen pinecone, shaggy-bearded homeless man crossing the road at night, and hair tuft must be evidence."
bigfoot,39zctt,doctorphyco,2,Tue Jun 16 16:19:43 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah he definitely does, and he even proposed a theory which I think may be right on point: That bigfoots are a species of human which migrated out of Africa 100,000 years before modern humans (give or take). He based it mostly on the geography of hominid sightings around the world as well as the abnormal features of the skull of Zana's son Khwit."
bigfoot,39zctt,Treedom_Lighter,3,Tue Jun 16 16:44:48 2015 UTC,"In many species, northern races tend be larger. If Sasquatch is more human (as compared to, say, being a Gigantopithecus relative), they may have adapted to northern and mountainous regions by becoming larger and hairier than modern humans. As modern humans swept across the world with teamwork, language, fire, and weapons, Sasquatch may have retreated into wilder, colder regions, where they still survive today in small numbers."

I had never been so scared! I said to my buddy Festus, 'Let's get out of here!'  Then again, it might just be neck-hair thing."
bigfoot,39sl06,CharlieBravo92,12,Sun Jun 14 10:22:25 2015 UTC,"Just an idea - We should have a FAQ section where people can go to have these questions answered because they're posted pretty often.   Patterson and Gimlin were out in the woods for weeks on horseback and psychologically prepared to see a bigfoot and attempt to get it on film. That very rarely happens in this day and age, if ever.   Most witnesses, in fact almost every last one of them, are not prepared to come face-to-face with a nine foot tall monster in the woods, much less whip out their phone, enter their four digit pin, open the camera app, aim and snap a video or pic before the thing bolts into the woods. It's naive to think it would be so easy to capture a clear image of one of these things simply because you had the once in a lifetime chance of running into one.   And that's assuming you don't shit your pants and cry and pray this gorilla-looking nightmare that outweighs you by 800 pounds doesn't tear you limb-from-limb for wandering too close to its territory or god forbid its children.   Besides that, they're likely mostly nocturnal and live in areas with natural obstructions literally everywhere. Go outside and try and get a good clear video of a chipmunk, and see how great the video is. Filming wildlife is hard, especially dangerous wildlife that may be one of the top-3 most intelligent life forms on the planet.   Edit: sorry if this sounded harsh, that was not my intention. But it's nowhere near as easy as it sounds."
bigfoot,39sl06,Treedom_Lighter,6,Mon Jun 15 00:16:22 2015 UTC,"Well, they are more animal than us, and I'm sure mother nature adjusted them to the woods.

bigfoot,39sl06,trentlacoye,2,Sun Jun 14 23:18:20 2015 UTC,"Let's say we have an IQ rank of: Human Sasquatch Gorilla  The question is whether Sasquatch is closer to human, yet without technology, or closer to Gorilla (and the other surving great apes). The difference may arisen from the length of time that Sasquatch has coexisted with humans. Gorillas and Chimpanzees have lived with humans throughout our history. Sasquatch-- if it is truly a large ape related to Giganthopithecus-- may have come to America long before modern humans, and then had to adapt to us within the past 18 or 12 thousand years, reaching a sort of ""agreement"" with Native Americans to stay away for the most part.   Of course, until we get more accurate anatomical records (and DNA evidence), we can't be sure of Sasquatch's placement on the Hominoid phylogenetic tree. It may be some sort of offshoot like a Neanderthal but much bigger. They may have found themselves under heavy genocidal pressure as they migrated from the Old World, with only the most elusive surviving. Starting with bows and arrows, spears, and traps, Bigfoots came to realize that despite their own superior strength, humans and their technology were to be avoided. Naturally they avoid camera traps and videocameras, as well as leghold traps and firearms.  Sure Patty got captured on film, but that is unusual. Most of them slip away before the human can really get a good shot. As any seasoned woodsman knows, it is hard to get a good look at many types of wildlife, and even harder to capture them on camera, which is why so many of our favorite wildlife documentaries have a lot of staging involved."
bigfoot,39sl06,doctorphyco,-2,Sun Jun 14 17:36:58 2015 UTC,"Intelligence isn't sufficient to account for zero Bigfoot specimens having been collected. Incredible luck is also required, with incredible being the key word. That's assuming Bigfoots venture beyond the most remote forests. If they do, it's nearly certain some would be have been captured alive, killed and collected, or found dead.  And with the great increase during the last decade in the number of video cameras in the US and Canada, we should expect the quality of the best Bigfoot videos to increase. That hasn't happened.  So there are two possibilities: either Bigfoots don't exist, or they exist only in the most remote areas."
bigfoot,39sl06,barryspencer,2,Sun Jun 14 18:40:32 2015 UTC,"You are absolutely correct that they are not slinking around back alleys in Manhattan.

bigfoot,39sl06,Gomtu,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:45:33 2015 UTC,"Patty walked across the creek the same reason birds fly away from the nest when they see a predator.  She was distracting them away from her children that she was probably with. She saw the horses and knew they were fast so hiding wasn't an option. The only option was to ""sacrifice"" herself (not that a horse would kill a bigfoot or even come close).  She looked back around frame 412 or whatever to see if they would follow her. Once she determined that they weren't, she started running when she was out of sight and turned around. The stride length became much greater once she was out of sight and the footprints showed her turning around.  That's why she was so obvious because she purposely was being obvious to draw attention to her and not her young."
bigfoot,39pkbi,SasquatchVideo,2,Sat Jun 13 14:39:37 2015 UTC,"A big reason why we haven't captured them is because they are nocturnal, so we need to film with high quality thermal cameras, with activation on vision. We also need to disguise trail cams and put out bait for them."

I'm still amazed that there are so many people out there that are positive they dont exist yet you can tell exactly what they do / dont do. However, with all of that you dont have the slightest clue about normal animal behavior.   Here you go, to help you out a bit: Animals and Territory -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_%28animal%29  You can also look up the following which discusses apes of various species throwing rocks in threat displays, and territory defense it's called The Throwing Madonna: Essays on the Brain from William H Calvin.  Apes also have been shown to throw rocks in defense of their young. Other species have also been shown to do things out of the norm in defense of their young."
bigfoot,39pkbi,willgk,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:35:05 2015 UTC,"Territory (animal):       In ethology, territory is the sociographical area that an animal of a particular species consistently defends against conspecifics (or, occasionally, animals of other species). Animals that defend territories in this way are referred to as territorial.  Territoriality is only shown by a minority of species. More commonly, an individual or a group of animals will have an area that it habitually uses but does not necessarily defend; this is called the home range. The home ranges of different groups of animals often overlap, or in the overlap areas, the groups will tend to avoid each other rather than seeking to expel each other. Within the home range there may be a core area that no other individual group uses, but, again, this is as a result of avoidance.

This is definitely not a mountain lion dump site.  Their kill sites would be scattered throughout their territory.  On some occasions, when food is scarce, they may kill more than one animal in a group or herd of animals and store the kills in a relatively small area.  But it would absolutely be no where near the level of what is in the photos.  They may slaughter 20+ sheep on a very rare occasion.  There is no way this was done by any known animal.  More than likely, it is a human dump site used by poachers or perhaps a road kill dumpsite used by Dept of Transportation workers."

bigfoot,39l1gg,darkehawk14,0,Mon Jun 15 00:51:23 2015 UTC,"So, this artcile is saying that bigfoot hunts for sport.  Meat and hide left on the bones rules out a meat hunter/predator.  Antlers broken and left on broken skulls rules out trophy hunters.  That leave bigfoot a sport hunter."
bigfoot,39l1gg,greldek,3,Fri Jun 12 14:16:19 2015 UTC,"Not sure how you gathered that. Towards the beginning of the article it states that they suspect it to be near 50 years worth. That's a stretch of the imagination I admit but to me it just seems like what it is, a dump for bones from past meals. You don't shit where you eat and neither should Patty. If they're the missing link then it isn't hard to imagine that they wouldn't want a mess around they're den just like you wouldn't, I assume."
bigfoot,39l1gg,masseyfarmer8690,0,Fri Jun 12 14:37:27 2015 UTC,"The way I gathered it is from quoted from the article:   Antlers and horns were broken and left on partial skulls — so that ruled out poachers and trophy hunters.  On some of the kills made in recent years, the hides and flesh still clung to the bones, so that ruled out meat hunters.    what other kind of hunter is there, besides hunting for sport?"
bigfoot,39l1gg,Fubarfrank,3,Fri Jun 12 16:02:51 2015 UTC,That actually does not rule out poachers at all. Poaching is a serious crime and many poachers will take only the choicest cuts; like back strap and leave the rest to be scavenged so it will look more natural should someone come upon their kill.   As for the hide it depends entirely on what finds the animal and scavenger it. Hide is extremely tough and many animals have a hard time getting through it; so often once a small opening is made animals will just use that and basically burrow a tunnel through the carcass through that single opening; leaving the hide mostly intact.  Also keep in mind some poachers kill only for the fun of killing; and some poachers kill just to keep critters off their land. I could easily see this being a place where some old rancher has just been dumping corpses of shit he's been killing for years.
bigfoot,39l1gg,Pangs,0,Sat Jun 13 05:22:31 2015 UTC,*old rancher  BINGO! Im guessing from the existence of cattle and horses it's a dump site for a ranch and they just throw all the shit they shoot legally or illegally in with it.
bigfoot,39l1gg,darkehawk14,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:35:51 2015 UTC,"You seem to be thinking linearly and I still don't understand why you see it this way. A hunter would not normally leave carcasses in a single area in the middle of the woods if they were doing it for sport. Sasquatch on the other hand would presumably have a spot to dump his leftovers, kind of like the garbage disposal in a sink.   Edit: And another type of hunter is a hunter for survival."

bigfoot,39kpp0,esskay1711,6,Fri Jun 12 12:09:04 2015 UTC,"We are talking about something we still can 100% prove exists, so even the researchers who look into it aren't positive of the exact population of Bigfoot.   Experts have made there best attempts my looking at sighting density maps around the United States and Canada. IT is extremely hard getting an exact number since there has never been a clear image of Bigfoot caught on camera or on video. Since there is no real evidence of Bigfoot existing they have to go off the eye witness reports of people. Since 1960 there has been about 3,500 reported sightings from citizens that experts say are credible reports. Theses reports are what are used to make the estimations for the Bigfoot population. After taking in all these reports the estimated population of Bigfoot is anywhere for two-thousand to six-thousand Bigfoots. So this means that there is indeed a breeding population of Bigfoot.   This exceeds the limit of a species to live on and be off the endangerd species list. Having a breeding population is needed for this creature in order to survive. It isn't out of the question to have more than just one of these creatures, one being male and one being female. It's very difficult for the scientific community to come to a conclusion about the existence of Bigfoot but then again there have been numerous animals that have been thought to be extinct and found in recent years by the scientific community. For example the Red-Bearded Titi. Found in Columbia in 2008 there remains less than two hundred and fifty of these primates left. They are on the endangerd species list but they are still surving. If Bigfoot had less than two hundred and fifty they could still have a sustainable population. They could reproduce without having any genetic problems."
bigfoot,39kpp0,JimmyNice,3,Fri Jun 12 12:20:24 2015 UTC,"That's extremely difficult to guess. There are less than a thousand mountain gorillas and the educated guess is that their numbers are holding steady or even increasing. But, they're mostly located in the same habitat, whereas bigfoots would be spread out from the Pacific northwest in Canada/Alaska down to the Everglades, separated by large swaths of desert and open grasslands where they'd have troubles crossing completely unseen. So we're talking not only about the breeding population of one species, but likely multiple groups of one species able to keep up their populations. This may be why the characteristics of bigfoots seen in different parts of the country seem to vary in a few specific ways.   But I'm already making assumptions about how many, where they are, etc. What if they migrate throughout the country with the seasons, or at least north and south? Until we get ourselves a few Jane Goodall bigfoot types (and Les Stroud would be a good candidate for the first one) we really will have no idea whether the higher-end guesses (100,000 or more) or the lower end (400-800 nationwide) are right. Or for that matter, even remotely close."
bigfoot,39kpp0,Treedom_Lighter,3,Fri Jun 12 13:46:10 2015 UTC,"If we haven't captured a bigfoot yet, then that implies they are a very intelligent ape species, and it also implies they are small in numbers. Like, less that 10 thousand, not even. Probably somewhere between 1 and 5 thousand. Even in these small numbers, there is still room for genetic diversity, like white fur, brown fur, black fur, etc."
bigfoot,39kpp0,king2ndthe3rd,2,Fri Jun 12 17:36:54 2015 UTC,"Also, something else to add is about the intelligence. Intelligence is characterized by, in this case, abilities to evade humans and escape capture. Intelligence can mean alot of other things, and a possibility is that the sasquatch species is very smart, and they could have possible developed their own communication skills and signs, for example tree structures. It really is a fascinating thought, to think about all the possibilities of their social order, their prowess, their adaptations, etc. The whole notion is intriguing. If they have been able to evolve alongside us, for hundreds of thousands of years, and to come from the great ape family, they truly are the most furtive being of all. I cant wait until 50 years passes by, and we get some more evidence, or a body maybe. Who knows."
bigfoot,39kpp0,king2ndthe3rd,2,Fri Jun 12 17:42:38 2015 UTC,Population size to maintain genetic diversity isn't the only thing at play.  Location and movement of genetics is probably more important than actual number.  The accounts of bigfoots in a family unit would also play into genetic diversity and inbeeding coefficients.
bigfoot,39kpp0,well_here_I_am,2,Fri Jun 12 13:42:30 2015 UTC,"This seems to be as close to a magic number as you can get.  50/500.  50 short term to keep from having catastrophic inbreeding.  500 long term.  But, it seems to me that the last number is 500 that are accessible to each other.  Not 500 spread across the whole continent."

bigfoot,39kpp0,bibLLiosoph,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:16:16 2015 UTC,"This raises some interesting questions, mainly what is the true range of Bigfoot. Are they REALLY spread out across the 48 states and much of Canada? Are they all the same species? (We have seen the idea that there are ""four types,"" but is that true?). How far can individuals travel? Do young males go on extended journeys from one population center to another? If so, they would be taking a risk of being seen. This would explain the wide geographical range of sightings, as once in a while one is spotted either raiding for food or crossing a road in an area where they don't normally dwell (that is, no local family groups). I think we could assume they have known safe routes (like the Underground Railroad). Family groups or small population centers might be spread out. There is a scientific paper that maps sightings and habitat (Lozier et al, 2009), but such an analysis using BFRO data will obviously include some hoaxery and mistaken identity. Objective computerized analysis cannot solve this mystery and determine where the family groups reside and where the travel routes (nocturnal highways which probably often follow watercourses) are-- we need someone who wears several caps: a trained scientist with strong powers of reason, a seasoned woodsman with great experience with wildlands and the animals who live there, and someone with an almost psychic level of intuition."

Firsthand eyewitness accounts often capture more detail that can be used to characterize the biology, habits, ecology, behavior, and intelligence of Bigfoot. Footprints are also valuable evidence, as long as hoaxing can be ruled out. Recorded vocals and the quest to decipher their language is a promising avenue of inquiry, but also very difficult, especially without clear visuals of associated behavior and social interaction. Anyone who can sort through all the evidence, sort the wheat from the chaff, and produce a clear picture of Bigfoot's ecology and behavior obviously merits a Nobel Prize."

So if Carl Sagan meant absence of evidence is not necessarily the same thing as evidence of absence, he was correct.   But once you've searched for and not found x, then the absence of evidence that x is where you searched is evidence of the absence of x where you searched.  So a search can make absence of evidence evidence of absence.  (You're right that searching a particular place and not finding x doesn't mean x cannot exist elsewhere. But I'm talking about searching for x in a particular place, e.g., searching for your key in a particular pocket. I use that example because it's relatively easy to thoroughly search a pocket for a key. If a search of a pocket finds no key, it's highly likely a key is absent from the pocket.)"

It doesn't look as smooth as it should compared to other footage like PG and Freeman.  The arms don't swing and the shoulders clearly move each time a foot hits the ground.  That's counter-intuitive, especially for this situation where a creature would want to be as stealthy as possible."
bigfoot,390tmj,well_here_I_am,3,Mon Jun 8 14:05:17 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I thought as well. I'd like to see more footage from this camera so we can see if maybe it's a trick of the camera making the movements seem so weird or if it's actually moving that way... I suppose you can't really know either way but that is one of the few red flags about this video.
bigfoot,390tmj,doctorphyco,3,Mon Jun 8 14:43:11 2015 UTC,"Sasquatch has more swagger. Fubarfrank is correct-- the gait's not right. And when they immediately cut to a plea for a subscription for  ""more evidence like this,"" you have to wonder."
bigfoot,390tmj,aazav,3,Mon Jun 8 21:04:27 2015 UTC,"I admit that it looks a little robotic, but if this is not fake, more people will have game cams like this and that means we're sure to see something better within the next few years."
bigfoot,390tmj,well_here_I_am,8,Mon Jun 8 23:09:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure.  I am a hunter and I've owned several game cams over the years and quite honestly, this 10 sec reaction time, or even a 5 second reaction time is old technology now (or bullshit). In fact, I'm not sure if there are any currently on the market that have greater than 1s trigger time, and there are some very affordable, very high quality trail cams out there that should do the trick, assuming that trail cams are a viable option to gather evidence in the first place.  I don't think they are, and after a couple hours away and coming back and looking again, I'm strongly leaning towards hoax on this one.    And then I have to step back and and think about trail cams in general.  They're extremely popular.  Almost every hunter has one or knows someone who does.  Lots of guys own dozens and have them all year.  There have been all sorts of amazing and incredible pictures taken.  Eagles taking down game, mountain lions and coyotes killing deer, trespassers and poachers in action, and the list goes on.  The point is that these things have the capacity to stay in the wild for months at a time (which would render them scentless) with no human interaction (no known animals are frightened by them or avoid them).  This tells me that sasquatch are not susceptible to being caught on trail cams very often, if at all.  They are either so perceptive that they can see them before being caught and have some notion that they're human and do something, or they're even more rare than we think they are.  I think that it's the first possibility and that they know that something is off when they see a trail cam and actively avoid them.  How?  I have no idea.  I do know that MK Davis has access to videos of supposed sasquatch that have been filmed by pointing a camera into a mirror.  I also know that sasquatch are not perfect and immune to mistakes, hence sightings and run-ins.  That being said, there is only one reputable trail-cam sighting (to my knowledge) that comes from a professional hunter, someone who has a lot at stake on his reputation (keep in mind this is several years old, hence the slow trigger).  There may be a lot more out there that we'll never see due to fear of persecution, but I don't think trail cams are a safe bet for gathering information."
bigfoot,390tmj,bowskieightcats,3,Mon Jun 8 23:27:45 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the hunter's video has been dismissed as a hoax. MK Davis uses the old Mike Sells videos from Texas, a known hoax. There's also another option as to why they aren't caught on trailcam: maybe they don't exist."

Of course, if you're using the olden QuickTimePlayer 7, you can easily export a frame to open in Photoshop and then set the image depth to 16 bits per pixel and tweak the levels pretty well.  You want more than 8 bits per pixel, because the greater bits gives the math more room to play and you'll only get better results when tweaking levels, doing edge detection and enhancement and other mathy matrix bits."

bigfoot,390tmj,ValiumMm,4,Mon Jun 8 14:22:34 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what i am saying. Almost every piece of evidence is of low quality and is largely inconclusive. It leads me to believe that this is quite possibly a hoax, but i do not know. Why is it in this day and age, with the technology we have, do we still get bad quality video footage?"
bigfoot,390tmj,Fubarfrank,6,Mon Jun 8 13:37:51 2015 UTC,"For one, nearly all encounters are unexpected, fleeting, and paralyzingly terrifying. Secondly, the vast majority of encounters happen either around dawn or dusk, in low-light, bad-visibility conditions. Even though we have cameras much more accessible now than ever before, it doesn't mean they shoot that great at night unless they're specifically designed for the purpose.  These are by all accounts intelligent creatures, and (I can't back this up so don't ask me to) personally I think they know what cameras are. But even if they don't, they know to keep their distance from humans, and they usually immediately grease it if they're discovered, or run into by accident."
bigfoot,390tmj,crwrd,4,Mon Jun 8 13:47:49 2015 UTC,"They are large primates. They are at least as intelligent as Gorillas, and possibly closer to us. Obviously long-term behavioral studies that would give us a better picture of their social behavior and forms of tool use would help, but until the Bigfoot research community finds their Jane Goodall, we are going to have to let their intelligence level be an open question."
bigfoot,390tmj,doctorphyco,3,Mon Jun 8 20:56:54 2015 UTC,"To me it's all about language. If Scott Nelson and others are right, and the bigfoot recordings do in fact reveal a spoken language, then we can throw any non-human primate comparison out the window.   Language is passed down through generations, and with it come histories, meanings, lessons, etc. It would explain how they're able to hide, intimidate, know what cameras and guns are and remain a mystery for as long as they have. I know it's quite a leap, but for me it all hinges on whether they can speak to one another in modality-independent ways. If they can, then there's a simple explanation as to why they avoid cameras."
bigfoot,390tmj,leif777,2,Mon Jun 8 21:10:23 2015 UTC,"Here is some of Nelson's info about analyzing Sasquatch language. It reminds me of some work I did on Steller Jay calls while in college. Or about how Helen Keller learned English. To learn what sounds mean, you have to put them in context of who is making them, who are they communicating to, what has transpired before, and what happens later. And then you need a lot of data.  It is safe assume that Sasquatch has some sort of language (or organized communication), but it probably doesn't align with ours. Look how different the languages used by various groups of humans are, and we are all the same species! Another species' language is very difficult to decode. Our progress in understanding the language of Bottlenose Dolphins, Orcas, and Humpback Whales has been slow. Nevertheless, developing a Sasquatch language database is a very worthwhile project!"
bigfoot,390tmj,doctorphyco,3,Mon Jun 8 21:32:21 2015 UTC,"Mitch Waite was kinda doing that, but unfortunately he passed away before releasing all the info he gathered.  I don't know if he was hoaxing or not, he seemed legit to me."

bigfoot,390tmj,Fsoprokon,2,Mon Jun 8 21:04:15 2015 UTC,"And how often do they have encounters? Once? Maybe twice in a lifetime? There are thousands of reports from unsuspecting hunters, campers, hikers and other people who were in no way ready to see a bigfoot.   And to be fair, we don't yet know if this was an encounter or a hoax."

Both my dad and her are 100% believers, so much so that the lady being interviewed will happily tell anyone about her encounters, regardless if they think she is crazy or not, because she believes so much.  This was the second of several stories she has about her encounters. If you did not see the first one, it is posted a few weeks ago on the same site here.   If anyone is not familiar with Munising Michigan, it is in a very remorte part of the upper peninsula - map - which I know proves nothing, but lends some credibility to the possibility."

But, the behavior, setting and reaction from the person filming all seem to fit well enough that it doesn't set off any obvious red flags for me.   In addition, the new stabilization shows a very commonly reported bigfoot behavior which is moving immediately to close cover when they spot a human. The physical features seem to line up, and really I just don't have any serious reason to doubt it.   I realize it's not the most skeptical and scientific approach, but I already know the species exists so it's easy for me to think that any new bigfoot video could in fact be real."

bigfoot,38ren8,well_here_I_am,2,Thu Jun 11 03:22:56 2015 UTC,"I am certain they exist because I've researched the subject for years, and I'm convinced by the evidence. Besides reading hundreds of witness reports and dozens of research papers and scientific articles about it, I've found a 15"" footprint myself in the swamps of Fouke, Arkansas. So while I haven't had an encounter myself, so to speak (unless you count the footprint find) I am as sure of their existence as anyone who's seen one face-to-face.  I was super-skeptical when I first started looking into this subject, but I found answers to every question I had."

bigfoot,38oz24,YOLOCUNT,7,Fri Jun 5 17:21:28 2015 UTC,"That's kind of the cutting edge of bigfooting right now. The BFRO I believe has at least a couple of drones outfitted with FLIRs, and they used one on the ""Bigfoot Basecamp"" episode in Minnesota last season.  This is kind of the idea behind the Falcon Project, too. Jeff Meldrum and others are working on getting a blimp-drone equipped with infrared and thermal cameras to try and film bigfoots from above the canopy in the heavily wooded areas in the Pacific Northwest. This, at the moment, is the Hail Mary, best chance, ""if this doesn't work we'll never live it down"" thing going on in bigfoot research. I haven't heard any news recently, but I seem to remember hearing they hoped to be off the ground by the end of this year."

Personally, I'm 100% convinced they're real because of several years of a WHOLE lot of research, as well as some field work. I also found a 15"" long footprint with five toes (the big toe being abducted out almost sideways) in the swamps of Fouke, Arkansas. That made it VERY real for me."
bigfoot,38hc8f,UNICY,2,Thu Jun 4 17:39:57 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty certain there is a decent chance they exist, I mean they are essentially just non extinct gigantapithocus right? That's not much of a stretch. I just figured this place were for satire because of the tone."
bigfoot,38hc8f,Treedom_Lighter,2,Thu Jun 4 18:24:24 2015 UTC,"One of the most popular theories about them (probably THE most popular theory actually) is that they're extant gigantopithecus blacki, exactly right.  I'm on the fence about that particular subject... The territorial behaviors and vocalizations and other behaviors reported by witnesses point pretty heavily in the ""great ape"" direction... But there's also a decent amount of circumstantial evidence that points to a branch on the human family tree. Possibly Denisovan or Australiopithecus. I tend to swing back and forth on the subject but something tells me they're a lot more human than, say, a gorilla, orangutan or chimpanzee."
bigfoot,38hc8f,UNICY,2,Thu Jun 4 20:35:10 2015 UTC,"Interesting, g.b. Is pretty much a big add orangutan right?

Really we only know it existed through jaws, teeth and some other bone fragments, but it was found in Eastern Asia and that's why it's sometimes assumed to be more ponginae than, say, gorilla or chimp. But honestly no one knows much about it at all except that it was an enormous primate.   That's so cool, orang pendek are awesome! I'm totally convinced the newly discovered ""hobbit people"" (homo florensiensis) are absolutely the ancestors of the orang pendek. If it weren't for the tigers and other awful shit that can kill you in that part of the world I'd love to go squatching there!  As for the one in China (commonly called the Yeren), I feel like that may be the same creature as the Yeti of Nepal. The size and colors are very consistent between those two, and yet very distinct from the little people of Indonesia. The whole subject is just so fascinating really I haven't been able to put it aside for years."

I'm pretty certain Yeren has existed just based on kind of how my wife's grandma was talking, she was a military surgeon/professor in what was essentially China's area 51, deep inside of the country where they did medical experiments, and just generally kept injured soldiers that were recovering, kind of away from anything that could be invaded and held by Japan or Russia. When she was showing me the molar she said something like ""this is from one of the older kinds."" I was like ""are there newer kinds?"" and she kind of gave me a funny look and said ""somethings are better not to talk about."" So there's that.   Indonesia is dangerous as hell, probably worse than Australia, literally everything is poisonous."

Bryan Sykes (the world famous geneticist that just did that huge DNA study on bigfoot and yeti hair) proposed a theory at the end of the study that they could be a species of human that migrated out of Africa maybe only a few hundred thousand years before us or something. It explains their behavior, the ""human"" DNA samples that come back, the evidence of language. A few Native American tribes had names for them like ""older brother"" and ""old man"" too. Damn. That's spooky and awesome."
bigfoot,38hc8f,ghostdate,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:17:32 2015 UTC,"There's a few theories surrounding what it might be. Some say Gigantopithicus, some say Denisovans, some say Neanderthals. I personally lean towards the more human possibilities like Neanderthals or Denisovans. They're supposed to be an offshoot of the hominid evolutionary path that lead to humans and left of from the same ancestors a long time ago, so we don't know how hairy they may have been. We do know that Neanderthals mated with humans occasionally, so that can kind of play off the reports of sasquatches wanting to mate with human women.   There's also that Lloyd Pye. I know his ""science"" isn't very good, but he does make an interesting point that we don't know for sure about a lot of things about the past, we're just making educated guesses. He theorized that Neanderthals looked like this:  http://s141.photobucket.com/user/icebear46/media/n10.gif.html?t=1332643079  Rather than this:  http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/07/18/article-2175417-0BC017E6000005DC-725_468x557.jpg  I haven't read about it in a while, but I think his reasoning was that we were applying human muscles and features in human ways, when Neanderthal would've been more ape like, so for the scarier rendering, they used chimpanzee type of muscles and anchored them like chimp muscles. I think actual anthropologists and biologists know how muscles anchor on bones and what types of muscles they would have a bit better than Lloyd did. Realistically I believe it probably was somewhere in between, but closer to the human side. That said, I wouldn't be at all surprised if they had a lot of body hair.   The part that I find compelling is that Denisovans and Neanderthals had moved up into Russian territory, rather close to the Bering land bridge, so it wouldn't be too surprising if they crossed.  That said, gigantopithicus fossils/remains were found relatively nearby as well, so either is possible in that regard. Personally, I just don't think the gigantopithicus would be smart enough to evade capture/getting shot."

Edit: A look at some of the behavior and equipment used by Sarkas in the planet of the apes films can give you some insight. However, keep in mind. To be compelling and realistic as possible, one would need to have some Artistic vision in the creation of a hoax video. It only takes 12 seconds of film to start a riot in the bigfoot community.

bigfoot,383fjg,ghostdate,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:58:24 2015 UTC,"Well, most hoax Bigfoot video makers use inexpensive techniques to create ambiguity: distance, subject partially obscured by brush or timber, shaky camera, subject goes in and out of focus, camera operator ""got scared and ran,"" subject's back is turned, etc.  The aim is to prevent the viewer from getting a clear view of the low-budget costume.  What we're waiting for now is the next stage: a hoax video that presents viewers with a clear and close-up view of the costume. The challenge is to make a costume so good it can withstand close scrutiny.  I think trail cam is the most practical scenario for such a ""next-generation"" hoax video. A trail cam video has a built-in narrative.  I expect what we'll see is an actor in a sophisticated Bigfoot costume pausing in front of, and looking right at, a trail cam. Maybe do a slow 360.

bigfoot,383fjg,JohnnyBueno,2,Mon Jun 1 23:30:14 2015 UTC,"Limb ratios are a way of determining whether something is a certain creature or not. For example there's a ratio between the thigh and calf that is pretty similar for all human beings, so if we take a video clip of an unknown figure, we can try to determine what the ratios are, based on the bends of the knees and elbows and hips. If they fit a human, then the clip is likely of a human. If they're inhuman ratios, then people think that means it's Sasquatch. This doesn't really make sense for him to bring it up here, because we don't know the limb ratios of a Sasquatch. What we do know is the limb ratios of human beings, and can guess that something isn't human if the ratio between say the forearm and upper arm are way off. However this sort of contraption kind of negates that, because it would look like an inhuman ratio, but we have no idea what the Sasquatch ratios would be. From there all we'd be able to say is that it doesn't look human, but if they were wearing this device, it could still be human, while not having proper human body ratios."
bigfoot,383fjg,JimmyNice,2,Mon Jun 1 23:55:18 2015 UTC,It's relevant because we do know the limb ratio of humans which we can use as a guideline to compare alleged Bigfoot photos and videos. Someone can fake a prosthetic arm but they can't change the ratio of their legs.
bigfoot,383fjg,JimmyNice,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:50:33 2015 UTC,"True, but if we're going by whatshisface with the YouTube channel who analyzes all the videos for body ratios, well, he doesn't do a very good job. He's let hoaxes slip by before based on his body ratios, and that's because they just don't work when the footage is grainy, tiny blobsquatches. At that point, you can put the joint pretty much anywhere on the limbs, nobody can tell if it's right or wrong. If a hoaxer really wanted to they could just stay at a decent distance, or they stay in tall grass so that the knees are never seen.

bigfoot,380gj1,barryspencer,3,Tue Jun 2 03:52:54 2015 UTC,"I'll start by saying I have quite a bit of experience in photo manipulation, as I'm a graphic designer. I've been working with Photoshop for years. I'll also say that I'm a believer in the possibility of Bigfoot.   To me, nothing in the photo looks like it's been manipulated. The grain, edges, and color/shadows are all consistent. I think this is a legitimate image and here's why:  First, I checked izitru and it just told me the photo had been resaved multiple times, which I assumed, and could be tampered with. FotoForensics showed everything being pretty normal. No evidence of tampering.  Grain: If someone were to have manipulated this photo, there would be unnaturally smooth areas where they changed things. That doesn't seem to happen anywhere in this photo.   Edges: Someone mentioned the hardness of the edges not matching. I don't know where they got that because if you compare the edge of the main tree and the ""head"" the hardness totally matches. The bleed from the blue sky is the same on both. It probably came from someone comparing the edges of the small twigs and the ""head.""  Color/shadows: The color on the ""Bigfoot"" is consistent all the way. No parts of it look like they've been modified or put together from other source photos. The shadows on the tree and the ""Bigfoot"" match intensity. I pulled samples and they all matched.  Now on to the arm, the part a lot of you are saying looks like bark. Yeah, it could possibly match the bark on the tiny branches but a branch that size would match the main tree more than the tiny branches. And it doesn't. There are uniform lines, which implies fur. This isn't definitive because nature does weird things sometimes but it's unlikely that it wouldn't match.  The head fur matches the quality of the rest of the photo, which is really hard to do. Not impossible but to match it that well is damn close to impossible. This ties in with the graining, or pixelation, I mentioned earlier. It's consistent.  I can't discount it being a gorilla, the features do match reasonably well and I don't know a whole hell of a lot about gorillas. To me it doesn't look like a gorilla. Similar but some of the features seem off to me.  I can say with almost 100% certainty that this is an unmodified image, or someone spent the entire year it was unreleased manipulating it and doing it very very well. If it's a fake it's the best fake I've seen.  tl;dr: Either a weird gorilla, Bigfoot, or the most impressive Photoshop job I've ever seen."

But selecting areas doesn't always work well, especially when there's not much contrast between foreground object and background.   Some areas you want selected won't get selected, and vice-versa. But if you don't modify the color of the areas that are selected, the areas that don't get selected or modified won't stand out in contrast to the areas that got selected and modified.  I think what the retoucher did here was modify some of the background bark between the foreground twigs, making it look more like hair and less like bark. The retoucher may have used the blur tool to accomplish this, or could have used a texture tool.  The mouth, nose, eye, and ear seem drawn on in black."

Plus, the edges, especially on the mouth and back of the head just seem too hard in comparison to the foreground.  On the other hand, looks like a strong and vital animal/hominid/whatever."
bigfoot,380gj1,AllTheKnowledge,3,Mon Jun 1 15:33:14 2015 UTC,The sun appears to be straight overhead from where the shadows are located... and a couple shadows from branches overhead appear on the creature's shoulder/neck area... and there's a clear shadow in the eye area under the brow ridge. Just my opinion but it seems they line up pretty well as far as the other shadows in the picture are concerned.

First thing I thought of, after seeing the enhanced(read:  Edited) version is Standing's blinky   Except more blurry.    As for the edit:  It looks like they edited in eyes and pretty much everything that you can actually see.  Edit:  and after looking at it again, it looks like a pretty crappy photoshop.  the eye to the left is much bigger than the one on the right.  And, aren't reports ALWAYS of fully black eyes?  Does that mean this is a totally new species?  Because its eyes are not as all the other reports are."

bigfoot,37v36a,darkehawk14,2,Sat May 30 18:43:00 2015 UTC,"You do realize the eyes were photoshopped in, right? You can't enhance video like that if there's nothing there to begin with. The source material is just two dark areas, which are obviously just being perceived as eye sockets by Dr. Squatch and whoever edited the photo. They're consistently coloured, meaning there's no underlying shapes to pull out, so we know that the eyes are not the result of enhancing, but rather editing.   I'm pretty skeptical of this Dr. Squatch fellow. All of his videos just seem to be pareidolia. Something about his behaviour in his videos makes me think he's possibly not he most mentally healthy individual either."

bigfoot,37rb0h,PlNKERTON,3,Wed Jun 3 16:06:53 2015 UTC,"I have a book recommendation for you--two actually. And before I give you their titles let me caution you not to allow any preconceived notions you might harbor or you might presume other people might harbor causing them to look askance at you for your reading choices cause you to scoff or sneer at the very idea of you bothering to give books such as these a chance... Although I'm sure without these qualifiers there's a good chance you would allow the titles of these two books to steer you away from actually giving them a chance. I had both on my kindle for a year before I finally decided to see what they were like and I didn't expect to read past the first chapter of either of them.  But I regret now that I let my stupid biases get in the way of giving this author a chance to convince me of the validity of his claims. I read both of them straight through virtually without pause and I wish he had another for me to read and I feel certain you will feel the same if you read these and you'll have all your questions answered.   Ok here goes nothing... The author's name is Jack 'Keewaunee' Lapseritis, M.S. and his first book is titled ""The Psychic Sasquatch and their UFO Connection"" and his most recent book is titled ""The Sasquatch People and Their Interdimensional Connection"" ... I can feel you pulling away already. Don't. Give him a chance to convince you that these titles are simply apt and any giggling or sneering smug superiority anyone might feel upon encountering these titles reflects only their own unfounded biases and ignorance. Read them and if you think about it, write me back and let me know whether or not I was right on target about these books being the perfect things to read for you considering your encounter. If you only read one of the two then read the most recent of them. Ok, I've done all I can. Good luck."
bigfoot,37rb0h,indignico,1 point,Sat May 30 12:26:12 2015 UTC,Lapseritis may have gotten his revelation about UFO Bigfoots from an episode of the TV show The Six Million Dollar Man that featured UFO Bigfoots.

bigfoot,37rb0h,Treedom_Lighter,2,Fri Jun 5 01:55:15 2015 UTC,"I'd never heard of olfaction before, but this seems like a very plausible alternative to the ""telepathic bigfoot"" theories. I've always thought of them as more empathic than telepathic, as they seem to project emotions more than actual specific thoughts and words, but this may be an actual scientifically relevant reason as to why SO many people report an incredibly wide range of emotions that seem to just ""come over them.""  This was an awesome story man, and I'm really glad you calmly spoke to the suspected sasquatch when you heard it instead of freaking out like many people would do. Maybe if more humans had these reactions when we bump into them, they'd be more likely to hang around or make some sort of contact. Good stuff!"
bigfoot,37rb0h,doctorphyco,3,Sat May 30 14:49:24 2015 UTC,"In many of these reports, Sasquatch is able to telepathically control the nearby human's emotional state. Often it will instill a great dread (""The hair stood up on my neck. I had never been that scared before.""), but in this case, it conveyed a message of calm that took about 30 minutes to wear off. Almost like a drug. Interesting."
bigfoot,37rb0h,barryspencer,5,Sat May 30 00:27:32 2015 UTC,"Olfaction, which is linked to emotion via the amygdala, and which, unlike telepathy, has been demonstrated to exist, seems more likely than telepathy to be the mode of communication."
bigfoot,37rb0h,doctorphyco,4,Sat May 30 02:44:16 2015 UTC,"So you are saying that Sasquatch pumps out multiple scents that act like drugs, either causing fear and panic or a profound sense of ease?"
bigfoot,37rb0h,barryspencer,4,Sat May 30 05:15:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think that's a plausible mechanism. Remember Lisa Simpson's discovery of ""poindextrose,"" a pheromone nerds emit that provokes bullying."
bigfoot,37rb0h,doctorphyco,2,Sat May 30 08:10:34 2015 UTC,"Some interesting studies include ""Acoustic and magnetic communication in plants"" and ""Out of Sight but Not out of Mind: Alternative Means of Communication in Plants"" and ""Love thy neighbour: facilitation through an alternative signalling modality in plants"" and ""Magnetoreception in plants"" and ""Field effects in the CNS play functional roles."" There are other interesting studies on microtubules in the brain cells, electric fields, and quantum effects (see ""Dielectric Polarization, Electrical Conduction, Information Processing and Quantum Computation in Microtubules. Are They Plausible?""). It would be foolish to categorically rule out non-chemical means of communication."
bigfoot,37rb0h,barryspencer,1 point,Sat May 30 19:14:06 2015 UTC,I agree electromagnetism isn't ruled out and is interesting. But olfaction seems a good bet because it's linked to emotion.

bigfoot,37rb0h,barryspencer,4,Sun May 31 03:10:20 2015 UTC,"All we know about Bigfoot is that it's a hominoid and is likely very rare, remote, and shy.   Non-telepathic Bigfoot is more likely than telepathic Bigfoot. Bigfoot that's quiet around humans is more likely than Bigfoot that isn't. Bigfoot that avoids people is more likely than Bigfoot that doesn't. Bigfoot that doesn't throw rocks around people is more likely than Bigfoot that does.  We should favor the most likely Bigfoot."
bigfoot,37rb0h,CoolHandKopp,5,Sat May 30 01:04:27 2015 UTC,"I also think that olfaction is the case instead of telepathy. Since OP is an experienced outdoorsman with a down-to-earth approach to predators it just shows that his senses work fine. Predators don't growl when hunting, they just attack out of nowhere. A growling animal feels threatened, OP deescalated the situation like sir."
bigfoot,37rb0h,Fsoprokon,7,Sat May 30 07:37:18 2015 UTC,It actually might have triggered his highest fear reaction.  Getting calm isn't unheard of in a situation where you feel helpless.  Denial ain't just a river in Egypt.

I froze, I was completely paralyzed with fear.   I think your response is a combination of things: 1. Your own primal instincts/survival mechanism 2. Some sort of projection from the creature  During my encounter, all my feelings felt primal and extremely strong. It felt like my instincts kicked in stronger and louder than ever. At the same time, I was sensing or picking up things from the creature also. I knew it was upset, I knew it was capable of tearing me apart. I could sense its intelligence and predatory nature.   I don't know how I knew those things, but there was no misunderstanding at all. It was definitely communicating things to me somehow. It could be telepathy, infra sound, pheromones, or something else. It felt like it was coming from deep inside me, like my instincts talking to me.  People respond to high stress situations differently and nobody really knows what they will do until it happens. I have had a few other near death experiences and when they happened, I was surprisingly calm. I just relaxed and accepted that I was going to die. My BF encounter was completely different. I felt like a piece of meat. I didn't want to die that way, I just wanted to get away from it."

I have always had a weird feeling that the thing was just ""passing through"". Also I welcome any comments/theories/discussion.  ""Pasted from a comment I wrote on another post in September 2011. Only change is that the boyfriend is now my husband..... 2 nights ago my boyfriend went to take the dogs out back. My one dog started barking like crazy right away. My BF had a flashlight and quickly scanned the grass line where the woods start, where we normally see deer (our house is bordered by woods). Something made him shine a bit higher, and he sees 2 eyes staring back at him, about 9 feet off the ground. As my bf tries to hurry the dogs back inside, he sees the thing turn and casually walk back into the woods. Like a man. With arms and shoulders. I have never seen my bf so freaked out. He came inside and closed every single window and all the blinds, and refuses to let the dogs out in the backyard at night any more. In hindsight there have been a few instances in the past few weeks that we cant explain (like dogs toys being down by the woods with bites taken out... but it was the placement of the toys and whatnot that makes us wonder). Also a grunt/snort noise we heard recently. My bf cannot get over the size of this thing, and the fact that the eyes were so high off the ground. I asked him if he thought he saw bigfoot, and he said after a minute or so of silence... ""If I wasn't a believer before, I sure as hell am one now.""

bigfoot,37gx63,ifvcu44,1 point,Wed May 27 21:35:52 2015 UTC,I'm confident it wasn't a bigfoot.  But I'd look info on if anyone has any idea of what it could have been.  So far a few people have pointed me towards the Wendigo.

bigfoot,37gx63,toscott_2000,7,Wed May 27 16:23:44 2015 UTC,"It's color was this off shoot of grayish brown. Here's my best visualization of it: It ran in a bizarre sideways motion but was very quick. It's body also didn't bob at all. It maintained the same line as it ran and it's appendages were long and it was well muscled. It had hair and a normal sized head but it's eyes were just massive. They didn't glow at all as it wasn't that dark yet but I did see that before dark glimmer animal eyes get. The eyes seemed human but just so damn big. The noise it made reminded me of a pissed off girl going ""GRRRRRR"" but it was just vile and powerfully loud/ higher pitched with a guttural tone. It held eye contact with us right until it went off into the woods."

bigfoot,37gx63,Ghomi,6,Wed May 27 23:54:32 2015 UTC,"I honestly have no idea.  All I know is that it was very unnerving and plain vile.  That area is really remote.  If you look at the coordinates via google earth you will get a better idea of the area.  My papa had been a tracker for over 40 years and helped with the DNR.  Before this sighting we had asked him over the years if he had seen anything like bigfoot in the wild.  He would always reply with a smile, ""No, but I've seen a few things that make you think, but other than that I've only seen animals and loud grandchildren.""  It really hit me during the next day when he saw the tracks.  He looked scared and immediately asked us all to leave.  He sold the cabin that same year.  To this day he will not talk about it."

bigfoot,37deq6,apehuman,1 point,Tue May 26 21:47:18 2015 UTC,"Your description fits many camp Sasquatch encounters, including my own.  I was nearly flattened by a deer that used me and the fire as a screen.  You might be surprised how many people have had this experience.  I see the comments about cougar, and you would know the difference between that and a full volume, big chest yell - pretty sure.  I was foolish enough to try and figure out what the heck happened (about six years ago) and really got into recording, video, thermal, etc.  Yep, they are out there...you can collect tracks, discover their signs in the environment,  record sound, poor day video, night  thermal, even the eye shine in color...it is not so hard as you imagine..  But, get some hair, or DNA, and a lab analysis..that's a whole 'nother thing.  I recommend you don't try....but do go to this website..it's one of the deeper ones...and there are literally hundreds of Facebook groups with witness members (and other online chat forums)...  It is not so crazy for you to wonder..!  I live not too far from Burney and assure you Sasquatches are still here........  all around you..  even in the Valley certain seasons...    Welcome to the real world! Also, left alone, (or even gifted with treats) they pose little threat.  There are plenty of scary stories, but all told, everyone seems to get away uninjured, fairly amazing..  Not a hobby I would recommend though, primarily b/c it will put you at odds with many who have no experience, but lots of strong opinions. Claim it as one...and there ya go.  Done! www.bigfootencounters.com"
bigfoot,37deq6,apehuman,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:04:53 2015 UTC,"Great info. Yeah, I have heard big cats before and this was definitely not that. The phrase you used ""big chest yell"" is a perfect description. If you live near Burney then you know the area I was in. I could tell that there was something up with that canyon as soon as we turned down that dirt road!"
bigfoot,37deq6,fyeah11,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:16:24 2015 UTC,"Well, glad to help.  I have heard that yell, many times.  Once you have...hard to forget.  But, they also mimic many animals, especially birds.  They have every facility we seem to have, except maybe our enuciation in speech.  All purported Sasquatch communicating in a language sound like one would imagine a ""caveman"" to sound...  they might be a relict human line.  Or not.  You 'knowing' something was up is also a telltale sign, and for some goes into full blown telepathic type imagery.  Yeah, you read that right.  You won't find but the most conservative witness of that paranormal aspect in the website I linked.  But, it is a fairly common, and historic, witness too. For that stuff..you might need to dig a little deeper.  Top theories for who they are:  relict human, unknown ape, unknown primate line, spiritual/interdimensional being, aliens... I think that covers it.  I think they are closest to a relict human model (Denisovans, or erectus), but there are some deeply strange things associated with them too, that I know by personal experience also.  So, they push any imagined behavior for that model..and also...well..haha, I'll refrain, except to say - don't discount the paranormal type stories that are associated with them, it isn't all bunk.  In myth they are often of 'demigod' status... (check out the Basque legends...cohabitants with Neandertal)   Really interesting stuff..but, stay at home!   ""Bigfoot Forums"" have searchable archives, and the site above has a page of links to others...the ""community"" is fairly deep, surprisingly."

bigfoot,37deq6,Treedom_Lighter,2,Wed May 27 17:41:10 2015 UTC,"Million:       One million (1,000,000) or one thousand thousand is the natural number following 999,999 and preceding 1,000,001. The word is derived from the early Italian millione (milione in modern Italian), from mille, ""thousand"", plus the augmentative suffix -one.   In scientific notation, it is written as 1×106 or 106.  Physical quantities can also be expressed using the SI prefix mega, when dealing with SI units. For example, 1 megawatt equals 1,000,000 watts.  It can be abbreviated MM, mm or mn in some financial contexts.

Look up lake Britton/ pit river... if there is a map, follow it down to where is says ""pit #5"" or ""stretch 5"", that's where we were. It's deep on a dirt road and a deep canyon. I was there in the middle of tourist season and didn't see another person or car out there for three days. We all slept with a gun in our tents that night after we heard that sound. So, moral of the story is that if you want a chance to hear what I heard, go camp down there with some buddies. One thing that I left out is that there was a dead deer near our camp when we showed up the first evening (but that could have been from anything). As soon as you turn down the dirt road after lake Britton, you will have a weird feeling in your gut like we did"

bigfoot,37c043,Treedom_Lighter,2,Tue May 26 14:46:13 2015 UTC,What's the back story on this?
bigfoot,37c043,j_roos,2,Tue May 26 19:28:26 2015 UTC,"People having fun and a camera, then someone spotted the figure running, and filmed it. Right time, right place maybe"
bigfoot,37c043,glassmind,1 point,Wed May 27 01:32:46 2015 UTC,"The Memorial Day video is a Hi-8mm video that is purported to show a rapidly moving Bigfoot, going from left to right. It was videotaped on May 26, 1996, by Lori Pate while they were on a fishing trip with family and friends at Chopaka Lake, in Okanogan County, north central Washington. (Some credit the footage to both Lori and Owen Pate.) It was preceded by two sightings of an anthropoid, hair-covered seemingly bipedal hominoid, at lesser distances, by others on the trip.  The Memorial Day video shows a figure, matching the description of a Bigfoot, running across a hill. It disappears behind a less-inclined, sloped area, then reappears briefly, walking this time, before going into the trees at the extreme right of the frame.  This is the third clip analyzed in the program Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science (the so-called Exhibit 8). The History documentary produced and directed by Doug Haijcek (today most recalled for “MonsterQuest”), was released January 9, 2003. In the hour-long program, the location where the Memorial Day footage was taken is used to make forensic measurements to determine the film subject’s height, path, speed, and stride by measuring the subject against fixed objects in the background.  Derek Prior, a three-time All-American sprinter from the University of Washington, runs the same route as the filmed figure to determine if the alleged Bigfoot’s running speed was too fast for a human to duplicate, to compare his speed and stride to the subject’s, and to give a visual comparison to the figure in the footage.  In the concluding segment of Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science, the results of the forensic measurements are revealed. The film subject – supposedly a Bigfoot – has the following alleged measurements:  A height of 5.3 ft (1.61 m) A leg length of 2½ ft (0.76 m) A running speed of 8.56 mph (13.77 km/h) A stride of 4.25 ft (1.29 m)  Derek Prior, a Homo sapiens, on the other hand, was able to run the same path at 17.1 mph (27.51 km/h) and had a stride of 6.8 ft (2.07 m).  One aspect of the film continues to remain a mystery. At the end of the Memorial Day footage, before the subject disappears into the tree line, it seems to grow taller by 8 inches (20.32 cm). One possible explanation was suggested that if it was indeed a real animal, it could be carrying a younger animal that had climbed higher on its back.   It was certainly filmed in the right part of the country to be a bigfoot, but the size and speed of the figure does not rule out a human in a suit hoaxing the people who filmed it. As for the figure growing by about 8"" or so at the end, the show ""Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files"" suggested it could be a tired hoaxer taking off the mask and resting it on top of his head as he enters the cover of the treeline.   I don't have a very strong feeling either way on this footage, but the people who filmed it seem to absolutely believe that what they saw that day wasn't human. We'll probably never know for sure."
bigfoot,37c043,aleahey,1 point,Wed May 27 19:32:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think it needs to be a hoaxer in a suit, or even a hoax. I think its a dude running across a field and he is somewhere having no idea that people think he was a bigfoot."
bigfoot,37c043,pm_your_squatch,1 point,Fri May 29 01:15:38 2015 UTC,"The couple who filmed it insisted that what they saw wasn't human, and compared to the guy who ran the same path you can tell it's all one color...

bigfoot,37c043,fabricator01,3,Tue May 26 21:48:40 2015 UTC,This footage was broken down in the Bigfoot Legend Meets Science documentary.  A human did run faster than the subject in the video on the exact same terrain.
bigfoot,37c043,huckinfillbilly,3,Wed May 27 10:57:46 2015 UTC,"Well, that is a little simplified, the human was a world class sprinter, and it took him like three tries in his running gear IIRC he ended up with a twisted ankle. For the comparison to be fair it would have to be done with him wearing a monkey suit."
bigfoot,37c043,fabricator01,1 point,Wed May 27 11:56:43 2015 UTC,"The ""bigfoot"" was also only 5'3"" in the video.  Very easily could have been a person in suit."
bigfoot,37c043,TeamSatan,2,Wed May 27 23:23:30 2015 UTC,"Actually, that makes it harder, a shorter person takes shorter strides, so they have to run even faster, not impossible but extremely difficult in a monkey suit. Especially as the sprinter found out, the terrain is uneven and there are lots of rocks, unless it's well made and fitted a suit is very hard to see out of."

bigfoot,3763vz,PadLilly,4,Mon May 25 13:01:29 2015 UTC,If you don't like the post....
bigfoot,3763vz,darkehawk14,2,Mon May 25 16:21:13 2015 UTC,Downvote? I did but I feel a downvote without giving a reason doesn't help anything.
bigfoot,3763vz,PadLilly,2,Mon May 25 18:24:56 2015 UTC,"Freedom of speech is a helpful guideline. The right to complain is the last to go. But there is also the right to complain about complaining... that's, like, meta-complaining. Then CheifShadeTree complains about the complaining about the complaining..."
bigfoot,3763vz,barryspencer,2,Mon May 25 19:08:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not complaining at all. I don't have a problem with any post, people are definitely free to say what they want. Padilly said that they hated the SasChron hate posts. If you hate something, why entertain it or indulge it. I don't listen to SasChron bcz I don't like it. However, I do want people to know that what they're listening to something that may not be genuine from someone that is not honest with his own story, that's been proven. Again, it's just puzzling why someone would even enter a thread that they don't like. Pretty basic and simple. Although I should apologize for the ""what the hell"" comment, that was too strong. It's just baffling that many of the SasChron supporters (germs) are blind to logic, common sense and character."

bigfoot,3763vz,PadLilly,7,Mon May 25 18:24:20 2015 UTC,"Well, you just made me want to listen to it by giving this bias synopsis. You didn't say anything about the guest actually said, which is what I would listen to it for. Instead you just shit talked Wes for having an agenda, which everyone does to some extent. He believes Sasquatch are dangerous animals? Fine, that's his belief, and there are some First Nations legends to back that up. There's also some that say they're peaceful and elusive, there's also some that say it's a spiritual being and doesn't physically exist in this realm. First Nations legends and folk lore change from tribe to tribe.  Sorry, I'm not quick to jump on the hate trains lately. I will agree that the show seems like it's on its last legs these days."

bigfoot,3763vz,Pangs,1 point,Mon May 25 20:36:55 2015 UTC,I wish I knew.  Waiting for /r/ghostdate /u/ghostdate to tell us what he said.
bigfoot,3763vz,aazav,3,Tue May 26 01:20:20 2015 UTC,"I finally listened to it today. It wasn't anyone special, just some early 20-something First Nations kid. He basically seemed to agree with Wes on the aspect of them possibly being dangerous, but said there were some occasions where tribe members encountered them and nothing bad happened. He told some stories, one of a Sasquatch entering a teepee with someone, but I got the impression this was like years and years ago. Some of people being taken by them if they went away from the group at night. It didn't seem like Wes was forcing his opinions or anything. He also didn't make any disparaging comments like chief-what's-his-name further down in the comments said.   I personally just think there's a huge hate train against SC and Wes and because of that, people are twisting their thoughts and words against him. He's not the wisest or most charismatic host, but he isn't a total asshole like some people here want to believe. I don't really get it, because it's not like it's been proven that he hoaxed anything, the whole thing sways on the fact that he thought it was a full moon. Personally I can't remember what stage the moon was in last night, and if I could see any sort of moon light or starlight highlighting something like that in the middle of the night, I would probably think the moon was full, or close to full on recollection like he did. I guess the people that hate him because of this can tell me, without looking it up, what stage the moon was in last night?"
bigfoot,3763vz,ghostdate,2,Tue May 26 01:41:59 2015 UTC,I just started listening to this podcast a few weeks ago. Most of the people that come on there are obviously lying. But I still find the stories entertaining.
bigfoot,3763vz,DunDerD,2,Mon May 25 18:05:05 2015 UTC,"I haven't listened to the show in a while, but not for any of the ""they lied about their encounter"" reasons, I've just been busy.  But I do like the show, I just haven't heard any new ones though.  I gotta start listening again."

I am surprised that I was so disappointed by the brothers, and the direction that the shows had taken. I really liked it when I first discovered it. Not long after I wrote it, I realized it would make others want to listen to it, the opposite of my intention. I, too, am bored with hate posts, yet here I am, commenting on how I already regret writing it. In fact, regret posting anything online. Who cares? I feel that we humans waste what time we have online, when we should be outdoors, or interacting with people in our proximity. Thank you all for your remarks."
bigfoot,3763vz,UNICY,1 point,Mon May 25 14:40:01 2015 UTC,"Man, it's funny, I just started listening to TSC last Thursday night when I couldn't sleep, starting at podcasts from a few months ago. A few were good a few were corny, we drove out of town for the weekend, the one on the way down was decent, but the more I listened, the worse they got.   The last straw was the one with cheesy western music. I treat these like what they are now, entertaining fan fic."
bigfoot,3763vz,TeamSatan,1 point,Tue May 26 13:35:10 2015 UTC,I listen but think it is completly made up. The guests and their stories are sounding like the same script writer is writing them all. But its getting really annoying with the bigfoot is a  serial killer stuff they push more and more. All these awesome hunters with big guns saying how  they get so scared with a whiff of squatch or pee themselves when a twig breaks..Now this cannibal stuff is stupud.  Just let the actors do the scripted tales and let us all be entertained..Forget the killer squatch stupidity.
bigfoot,3763vz,Nothingiswrongwithme,-3,Sun May 31 11:14:46 2015 UTC,I like to listen to hear how stupid Wes sounds when he speaks. His guest sounded pretty baked last night. Gotta love SC.

bigfoot,36xwpp,HairlessSasquatch,4,Sat May 23 01:41:50 2015 UTC,Les says 6 in the few interviews I've heard. I'm guessing the editors might have split one into 2 or something.
bigfoot,36xwpp,NDMagoo,4,Sat May 23 12:13:53 2015 UTC,I just watched season 6 episode 7 last night. It originally aired 2 weeks ago. I have had trouble with our DVR getting it recorded since midcontinent airs them on Wednesday but says they sit on Friday. The episode is titled Hidden world of Bigfoot. I enjoyed it a lot.
bigfoot,36xwpp,porkfatrules,4,Sat May 23 13:18:51 2015 UTC,"He may as well just keep looking for sasquatches wherever he goes, since he is going be outdoors demonstrating survival tricks anyway."
bigfoot,36xwpp,mzziz,3,Sun May 24 17:09:17 2015 UTC,I thought I had heard six but hasn't there already been more than that?
bigfoot,36xwpp,Treedom_Lighter,6,Sat May 23 01:25:49 2015 UTC,I thought the same. After a disappointing episode six I thought the season was over but then an episode seven came out so it makes me think there will be more
bigfoot,36xwpp,Brother_Clovis,6,Sat May 23 02:11:19 2015 UTC,He said on the Joe Rogan podcast there would be 7.  The rest of the season is normal survivorman eps.

bigfoot,36xwpp,Dik_Tasty,3,Sun May 24 05:18:14 2015 UTC,Wikipedia says there are only six episodes but seven episodes have aired.
bigfoot,36xwpp,ZioFritz,3,Sat May 23 02:12:50 2015 UTC,He had 2 bigfoot episodes in season 5 as well. Episodes 7 & 8. Maybe that is what sparked the theme for season 6. I think his opinion and approach to the topic is some of the best research I've seen on a primetime TV show.
bigfoot,36xwpp,fabricator01,2,Sat May 23 19:59:34 2015 UTC,"Nine in total, two at the end of last season and seven this year.  I must say I agree with those saying it got worse as it went on, I didnt really like the last episodes and in general feel he should be out alone instead of teaming up with these dubious characters."
bigfoot,36vhs2,dfromrc,12,Fri May 22 13:20:37 2015 UTC,"If anyone is going to get the real answer, I think Les will. But, you know full well he isn't going to get any concrete evidence because it would have been on the news. Will I watch it anyway? Of course!"
bigfoot,36vhs2,Kwyjibo29,3,Fri May 22 14:50:09 2015 UTC,"True.  Same thing with all of these shows, there's not going to be any earth-shattering evidence."
bigfoot,36vhs2,Astrocragg,12,Fri May 22 16:16:52 2015 UTC,"I think it's falling short of expectations.    When he started talking about doing the show, he pitched it as just him and his cameras going out into the wilderness in ""hotspot"" areas for a week or so, with less emphasis on survival than traditional survivorman, but still a very stripped down, solitary thing.  Instead, he's trending toward the other ""yell in the dark"" bigfoot shows, using a camera crew, and seemingly not venturing that far into the bush.  Maybe that will change in later episodes, but it certainly seems that he's meeting up with ""researchers,"" then going and looking in their back yards.  All of the foregoing notwithstanding, I do like how he approaches the subject matter:  with an open mind, but very skeptical."
bigfoot,36vhs2,Astrocragg,9,Fri May 22 14:22:45 2015 UTC,"I agree that I think he should do more solitary work on the show.  I don't think it's a bad idea to go to some ""hotspots"" and have some experienced people give him some tips on what they think are good places though.  I thought the vocalizations they recorded on the last show I watched were pretty awesome but I could have done with less of the print re-creation parts.  I'm just glad it's not Bear Grylls."
bigfoot,36vhs2,DunDerD,4,Fri May 22 16:20:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a bad idea to go to some ""hotspots"" and have some experienced people give him some tips on what they think are good places though.   Absolutely agree, it just has a feeling that it's very cursory.  Almost like if the camera pans the wrong way, you'll see houses."
bigfoot,36vhs2,ifvcu44,2,Fri May 22 16:24:35 2015 UTC,Haha!
bigfoot,36vhs2,fabricator01,2,Fri May 22 16:39:49 2015 UTC,Les' show is the most open minded while being rational. The only thing that slows down his investigations is when he goes out there with huge frauds like Todd Standing.
bigfoot,36vhs2,aleahey,1 point,Fri May 22 21:29:30 2015 UTC,"So long as he stays on the fact-based and tangible evidence side of things, I think its a solid show. Hopefully he doesnt go all sensationalist like Moneymaker and his crew"
bigfoot,36vhs2,Pangs,-1,Sat May 23 17:23:09 2015 UTC,"This show sucks ass, he had a real chance to do it right but fell right into the (Not) Finding Bogfoot template.  I used to have a lot of respect for Les, why the fuck didn't they model the show after his other shows, get dropped off in a hot spot with enough provisions to stay there and investigate for a month.

I don't know if SO is a hoax or not, I am still openminded on the subject. I found his approach interesting, and the audio vocalizations intriguing. Of course, it could all be theatre. As for Patterson not taking criticism well (re: comments on Youtube), I don't think that can be taken as evidence either way. Many people are too thin-skinned to accept even the most well-intentioned, constructive criticism. These people soak up your compliments, but god forbid you offer a critique."

bigfoot,36o68i,barryspencer,1 point,Thu May 21 12:38:11 2015 UTC,Experienced hunters/outdoorsmen wouldn't make this mistake.
bigfoot,36o68i,barryspencer,3,Fri May 22 00:23:01 2015 UTC,Even experienced hunters don't normally run across huge bipedal ape footprints dude. The way they move their feet and the action of the foot against the mud can create impressions that are likely very hard to interpret... Especially during frequent rainstorms.
bigfoot,36o68i,barryspencer,-1,Fri May 22 03:08:01 2015 UTC,"Let's review how the Bigfoots in this story behaved:  Approached within 20 feet of a man in the open. Left tracks in mud leading away from a camp of hunters. Made noise by moving. Moved stealthily yet could be heard moving. Pushed down on a tarp roof sheltering armed men. Could be heard shuffling. Smacked a tarp shelter containing armed men. Pulled on the corners of a tarp sheltering armed men. Shook a trailer and pulled a tarp sheltering armed men. Urinated within a few feet of an armed man. Could be heard breathing heavily. Swatted a tarp sheltering armed men. Threw rocks and debris at a shelter containing armed men. Hit a tarp sheltering armed men. Threw firewood around, stomped, and broke tree limbs in a camp of armed men. Repeatedly urinated within a few feet of armed men. Growled near armed men. Made weird noise near armed men. Threw things at a tarp sheltering armed men. Threw rocks at armed men in the open. Shook brush and a mature tree near armed men. Exposed itself at 35 yard distance in daylight to armed men. Stared at an armed man in the open. Made noises a little way off from armed men. Could be seen watching armed men. Came into a camp of armed men and walked around, hit an ice chest, and spun it around. When screamed at by armed men, broke a ten-inch-diameter aspen. Produced the sound of heavy footfalls within earshot of armed men.  It's highly unlikely Bigfoots ever behave this way, because if they did, they would almost certainly have been bagged and would be on display in natural history museums."
bigfoot,36o68i,ghostdate,5,Thu May 21 05:46:23 2015 UTC,"There are literally hundreds of reports describing bigfoots behaving in exactly these ways. This one is a little more intense than your average one, but nothing completely unexpected. This is a classic description of their territorial behaviors."
bigfoot,36o68i,barryspencer,0,Thu May 21 12:40:02 2015 UTC,"I know it may seem paradoxical or counterintuitive to you, but hundreds of reports of Bigfoots behaving like that means it's highly unlikely Bigfoots behave like that. It's highly unlikely Bigfoots could have behaved that way hundreds of times without being collected.  So long as no Bigfoot specimen has been collected, each additional report of aggressive Bigfoots makes it more likely all reports of aggressive Bigfoots are fabrication or misidentification. This story, in other words, is evidence against Bigfoots behaving the way they behave in the story."
bigfoot,36o68i,barryspencer,5,Thu May 21 18:17:29 2015 UTC,"It doesn't sound paradoxical or counterintuitive. It sounds like you don't give a flying fuck what anyone says if they didn't also happen to kill the nine foot tall monster that was scaring the shit out of them. That's fine, I understand we have to be skeptical. But it has LITERALLY nothing to do with how likely the members of this species are to display this sort of behavior."
bigfoot,36o68i,barryspencer,0,Fri May 22 03:14:16 2015 UTC,"These guys didn't happen to kill the Bigfoots terrorizing them, but Bigfoots that terrorize hunters wouldn't be that lucky every time.  If Bigfoots occasionally terrorized hunters, some of those terrorized hunters would have shot Bigfoots and hauled the carcasses to town, and there would be Bigfoots on display at museums."
bigfoot,36o68i,YOLOCUNT,3,Fri May 22 05:40:48 2015 UTC,What the holy fuck are you basing that wild claim on?
bigfoot,36o68i,barryspencer,3,Fri May 22 05:52:07 2015 UTC,"He bases his theories on what he believes is most likely, so it's basically junk science. There's a number of reasons why a Sasquatch might not be killed by a hunter it encounters, or why we might not hear about it. Several reports I've read and heard people have said that the creature was shot, but never went down, so perhaps the ammunition carried by the average hunter isn't powerful enough to kill a Bigfoot in 1 or 2 shots.  Fact of the matter is, we don't know at this point, and stating one way or the other for certain is kind of ridiculous, not to mention potentially dangerous."

I bet the BF even brushed his pearly whites. Standing's reputation is at the point that I don't care what pictures he puts on the internet. I am someone who wants to believe as much as you.
bigfoot,36ff2g,Guano-,5,Tue May 19 00:30:06 2015 UTC,While I agree that Standing is not a reputable person to be believed and also think these shots of his are fake I do not question a well groomed Bigfoot.  If you look in the wild and gorilla's you will see they groom each other and pictures of them in the wild show about the same cleanliness with their fur as Standing's footage.  I can easily see it possible for a bipedal animal with some level of intelligence to keep itself groomed to a certain level.
bigfoot,36ff2g,toscott_2000,3,Tue May 19 23:44:29 2015 UTC,That makes complete sense. Did not think of that.

bigfoot,36c44s,the_hotologist,6,Mon May 18 04:45:21 2015 UTC,"I found it one of the better episodes, but it ran dangerously close to emulating NeverFindingBigfoot, in it's night vision shots and vocal calls in the woods,... I'm not sure why he didn't pull out all the stops like he did in texas for this area, but it was probably at the behest of the host flute players,...   I'm not sure what that says about what we've come to expect from squatching searches, but I'm sure it isn't good,...  The vocalization was interesting but did sound close to an emulated or real coyote, and I'm curious why he didn't think it merited a mention as some positive results when he was discussing the episodes on JoeRogan.   I guess, an unknown vocalization in the woods at night is just an unknown vocalization in the woods at night,... and with the popularity of people doing them while squatching now, humans can't easily be ruled out as a source any more,...  What I do like is the 'canon of squatchyness' he has documented as bizarre or unique artefacts in the isolated forests; tree teepees, upside down planted trunks, twisted tree breaks, stumps with sticks planted in the top, are all real and tangible artefacts that, with further study, should be able to forensically be tested for human or unknown interference. The isolation alone, in most of these cases, eliminates human interference(to 'create' these artefacts in the places they are found, so far off the beaten track, is literal insanity if one wants them to be found and/or appreciated), but also makes studying them rather difficult,..."
bigfoot,36c44s,simianman,2,Mon May 18 12:19:59 2015 UTC,"As chilling and suggestive as that vocalization was, I agree with you, it isn't proof positive of anything except for something else was in the woods making noise with them. To my ears it sounded close to a Coyote call."

bigfoot,36c44s,Treedom_Lighter,9,Sun May 31 18:46:33 2015 UTC,"As someone who has spent a great deal of time in the woods of the mountain west; I can assure anyone here that there is no end to the stupidity humans will do for no reason other than they want entertain themselves or destroy something or who knows what other reasons.   I've back packed into places that take days to get into on foot and the only other plausible way would be horseback. Places where the trails fade away and you actually have to navigate to continue on. And in all these places there is clear sign of other humans having been there; and sadly often times it's signs of destruction not just something as simple as a firepit.  Usually it's name carving or burning whole trees etc. But the reality is people go out there and mess with stuff.   So on all this remote evidence where researchers are trying to use an occams razor ideology to explain why something has to be bigfoot over human; I go with bored human 100% of the time. It is far more likely to me that a human would invert a tree and have it standing root side up than it is anything else.   Humans do stupid shit; it's documented millions of times per day; so to me ""why would a person do that?"", is not an argument in favor of bigfoot at all."
bigfoot,36c44s,greldek,2,Mon May 18 20:14:31 2015 UTC,"Yes I agree humans do a lot of stupid but I think a lot of these structures are interesting because of how they were made. The strength and effort needed with out tools in remote places where energy is key.  But I don't agree with the notion than man has been everywhere in the wilderness. Nature is dangerous as you know so we tend to stick to the easiest way through terrain. Look at the vastness of the PNW and Canada and how small condensed our population areas are, it'd be wrong to say we've been there and done that. Where do you do all your bushwaking in the Mountain West?"

I'm saying a lot of these other ""researchers"" walked or atv'd in on a trail that humans made then talk about how remote it is."

What i think is solid proof that bigfoot exists, albeit small numbers, are the structures/gifts and other misc stuff they leave behind, in addition to the sightings. Sure, humans can hoax these things but i find it hard to believe that all these footprints, structures were simply hoaxed. They are in such a remote area, and Les demonstrated hoaxing is not an easy job. It costs money, time, effort. Would somebody dedicate their whole career to hoaxing? They could, but its unlikely.

""I ordered a burger.   I told them no pickles but they gave me pickles.   So I picked off the pickles cuz i don't like eating them. That's why I asked for no pickles.   So I......so I picked off the pickles and added a little more mustard.  Cuz golly.  I love me some mustard and I bit into my lunch.  Man. That was a good burger.  Except for those pickles.   I had to knock a couple bucks off the tip.  Because I asked for no pickles.  But I got pickles.    I would have left the waitress $6.00, but instead I left her $4.00.   When a man doesn't want pickles, he doesn't want pickles.   So I left her a $4.00 tip.  So I finish my burger and I get into my truck.   The padding On my seat is tearing away on the right side, so I put a towel there.  Don't need to get chair sores from sitting on a busted chair.   I once had a sore that took 4 months to heal.   I'd rub cream on it 3 times a day.  Not that cream you get at the truck stop, but the Walmart brand.  That works the best.   I try not to shop at Walmart, but when it comes to sores, you don't mess around with flying J brand ointment.   Always get it from Walmart.    And a towel to sit on.  So you don't get the sores in the first place.       Anyway.  I situated my towel and get on my seat and I start trucking.  This guy that goes by the handle of 'pocket rocket' was on the CB.   channel 7 I think.   Yeah.  7.   Because it was the same channel as the mile marker I passed when I hit Nashville.  So pocket rocket  was talking about a wreck up the road and I looked down and realized that the lot lizard left her meth in my cab.   Not that blue meth like in that show.   White meth.  What show was that?  Breaking Benjamin?   No.    That's a movie or something.   No.  It's a band.  Breaking bad.   Yeah.  Blue meth in breaking bad.   But this was ordinary white meth.  Anyways.   I contemplated doing the meth.  And I was questioning my 8 years of sobriety, when I look up just in time to see this truck hit a Bigfoot"""

bigfoot,360qqv,doctorphyco,10,Sat May 16 21:26:03 2015 UTC,"There are zero confirmed incidents of a Bigfoot attacking a person, but road traffic is dangerous, and bears are dangerous, so I won't excoriate the guy for not stopping, getting out of the cab of his truck, and walking towards the possible Bigfoot. But he could have maybe pulled over and peered back towards it from the safety of his cab. Instead he just kept driving while deciding what he saw was a Bigfoot. He didn't take the opportunity to try to determine whether it was, so I don't think he earned the right to claim he saw a Bigfoot."

bigfoot,360qqv,barryspencer,6,Fri May 15 18:05:22 2015 UTC,"Dude, there's no ""confirmed"" history of bigfoots NOT harming humans either. If you see a bipedal hair-covered manimal with a cro-magnon-looking face that's 8' tall and has huge broad shoulders it's probably not a fucking bear. It still doesn't make it any safer to approach."

If it seems to have a hominoid face and broad shoulders, it probably doesn't, and is probably a bear."

bigfoot,360qqv,Treedom_Lighter,2,Fri May 15 19:17:17 2015 UTC,"You would advise against approaching a Bigfoot because you consider Bigfoots dangerous. I would advise against approaching a Bigfoot because what appears to be a Bigfoot could be a bear.  An animal that's bipedal, furry, and eight feet tall... looks like a bear, and in North America is probably a bear. If that critter doesn't appear to move like a bear, it's still probably a bear."

Hiking/camping/hunting etc. I ask because you seem to think people who are out in the wilderness often are complete assholes and can't tell a bear from a hole in the ground. It's insulting and idiotic to insist what people are seeing is whatever YOU think it most likely is.
bigfoot,360qqv,Treedom_Lighter,1 point,Fri May 15 21:26:21 2015 UTC,"People can mistake something for a similar looking thing. Bears and Bigfoots look much alike: both are big, furry, and bipedal. And bears are sighted far more often than Bigfoots. All those facts together mean any big, furry, and bipedal critter you spot in North America is more likely bear than Bigfoot."

I think we should take a more cautious approach in Grizzly habitat. I am taking about being alone in the woods, and seeing or hearing just enough to know that there is an extremely-large mammal out there, but not enough to know what it is."

But I can't in good conscience advise others to approach possible Bigfoots.  You make a good point that Black Bears aren't very dangerous, so unless you're in Grizzly country there's not much risk in approaching a critter that looks like a Bigfoot.  There's also the question of whether approaching a possible Bigfoot, or Black Bear, for that matter, is likely to yield a better look at the critter. Maybe approaching the critter will just make it run away sooner."

We should all promise ourselves that will investigate, not run in fear, if we see one. Let's not come back to r/bigfoot with some story like ""I saw a Bigfoot, well maybe. It was something. But I got scared and left.""  Let's come back with either: ""I saw something. I went out and investigated, and it was a drunken college student in a hoodie"" or ""I saw something and went out and investigated. It was Sasquatch in all his massive hairy glory!

He sounds like a college kid taking his first philosophy class who loves making ""logical arguments"" that don't account for a wide variety of variables and unknowns.  His ""unconfirmed accounts"" bullshit is so moronic, because there's no confirmed accounts of Bigfoot to begin with, the whole field is pretty much guesswork at the moment. We only have reported sightings. We also have reported sightings that include aggressive behaviour. Not necessarily violent attacks (though there are some of those) but people have reported being charged, having objects thrown at them and general aggressive behaviour like growls. Not to mention many aboriginal histories that include stories of Sasquatch (sometimes another name, because not all tribes use the same language or have the same name for things) eating people and kidnapping children.   He's explained his logic before (""if they were attacking people, they'd have been caught by now"") but it doesn't really follow, because there's so many unknowns here. Practical sense doesn't always make logical sense, so relying on a logical argument, especially when you don't even have full knowledge of the topic is kind of a poor idea."

What you're doing by making a ""logical"" argument without full knowledge of the subject in question is ""a is unknown, b is c, therefor a is c""  You're missing variables and information on the topic so you're making assumptions. While they may follow a formula, they aren't inherently true, because we don't know enough about the object. You also just discount information because it doesn't fit your view."

I also think it's possible to be shy and aggressive. That is, shy until it feels it's space is being invaded, or feels there is a threat against it. I don't think they actively hunt humans or try to kill humans, but there's plenty of reports of encounters where an aggressive action was taken."

bigfoot,35phq5,doctorphyco,12,Tue May 12 14:26:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, that area has lots of Black Bears, and that appears to be two cubs. Obviously, too far away and too blurry to be absolutely sure just from the photo. So we're left with the eyewitness testimony of a guy who carries a giant flashlight into the woods but no binoculars. The giant flashlight says ""scared at night"" and the lack of binoculars says ""not much of a naturalist."" Definitely not the type of guy who can tell us whether he saw bear cubs, two guys in black climbing trees, or Sasquatches.  Every time we see some shadow in the woods, we shouldn't run away and later let our runaway imaginations turn it into a Bigfoot report. We need real sightings, not the fantasies of Nervous Nellies."
bigfoot,35phq5,barryspencer,2,Tue May 12 15:11:25 2015 UTC,They look like bear cubs to me. Why do you suppose they climbed those trees? To get bee hives?
bigfoot,35phq5,doctorphyco,2,Tue May 12 18:22:34 2015 UTC,"No, they are too high up, and there wouldn't be hollows that far up those trees where honeybees could maintain hives (the trunk is getting thin, and the wood is not old). The natural hives I have found are usually in the fat part with some rotted out areas.   Bears are intelligent animals, and the young ones learn by playing. They may just be climbing for fun. I have seen a mother bear send her cub up a tree when I approached. But at that distance (500 feet), they are probably not climbing for safety from the humans."

As anyone knows, your imagination can concoct all sorts of sounds out of the white noise of fast-flowing water. I am surprised he didn't see rocks at the bottom of the river and conclude that Bigfoot must have thrown them in there.  The guys says he ""knows"" they weren't bears or humans, yet he doesn't approach them for a better look because his girlfriend got scared again they might come down. I applaud the guy for getting up and doing the routine, put-your-girlfriend-at-ease nighttime check because she heard water, but if he REALLY thought those young bears were Bigfoot, he should have stayed!

bigfoot,35phq5,aquias27,3,Tue May 12 15:51:43 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of something.  I live in the Sierras, and from time to time I hear stories.  One guy who lives in the wilderness was saying that BFs will climb tall trees and stay perfectly still to hide.  He claims to have come face to face with them a few times.  He believes they are highly intelligent and prefer to avoid confrontation.  He even said where they could be found, which is actually near another documented BF siting.  I want to believe, but a part of me is skeptical still."

bigfoot,35phq5,aquias27,3,Tue May 12 21:30:55 2015 UTC,"Same here.  I believe it's possible for a sasquatch to exist.  But I am skeptical of some reports.  As a hobby I study ethnobotany and ecology.  I know of many edible plants, fungi, and critters locally.  Seems to me a Bigfoot would have no problem surviving here.  And who know what kind of bacteria are in it's gut to help it digest things we humans simply cannot.  Just a thought..."
bigfoot,35phq5,barryspencer,1 point,Tue May 12 21:40:14 2015 UTC,"If Bigfoots climbed trees, and people noticed them hiding in trees, then people could use cameras with telephoto lenses to get clear photos of them, or wait near the base of the tree for the Bigfoot to come down, and get decent, close-up photos of it. There's no such photo, which suggests that either Bigfoots rarely or never climb trees, or, if they do climb and hide in trees, people rarely or never notice them doing so.  Likewise, if people came face to face with Bigfoots, it's likely some people would manage to get decent, close-up photos of Bigfoots. The absence of such photos strongly suggests people rarely or never come face to face with Bigfoots."

Also explains why gems such as spina bifida exist in the gene pool. When an animal is born with a defect the most likely cause is a sperm/ egg mismatch/disalignment. It also explains why we are so much different than any species that is from this planet

bigfoot,35gbe9,Erikthonius,10,Sun May 10 02:01:17 2015 UTC,"I had an encounter, a very real encounter, being late middle aged, my world view was well established it included little to no contemplation of a big hairy smelly monster living in the forest, other than the occasional  TV show. That was all smashed in a split second, long story short  over the course of the next few months it resulted in a 14 day stay in a local psych hospital. I'm ""all better now"" LOL, thanks to modern pharmacology. My problem is I am certain I was not mistaken as it was broad daylight in a park like old growth forest and I was not the only witness, the other witness has still not dealt with it, will not talk about it to anyone and is currently deep into the self medication part of his therapy, it's is as you would expect, not going well."

Obviously you probably didn't mention any of that to your well-meaning captors, and neither would I....

I mean, look at how this guy describes Bigfoot:  ""He's a monster, he'll eat anything, alive, dead, fresh, rotten.... He's a survivor... mobile, quick, fast, and strong.... Anybody who sees a slow Sasquatch is not in the ball park.... He's got no limits, climbs any mountain, swims any river. He's got no barriers.... Not an endangered species, thats us.... He can pull down big game on the run or by stealth, like a cougar.... He can lay down a light track or spring like a deer.... Has a lot of humor, yet restraint.... Rocks cars and cabins, but lets folks go.... We agonize, he couldn't care less.... An opportunist at the top of the food chain, in great shape--he's got it made! Adapted to cutover lands, lives a good rugged existence.... He's got no need for wages, lives off the fat of the land, and pays no taxes!""  -Jim Hewkin, retired fish and game professional from Oregon, quoted in:  Pyle, Robert Michael. Where Bigfoot Walks: Crossing the Dark Divide. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1995, page 204.  And there's nothing wrong with that.

Old shows worth listening to the Bigfoot show with Brian Brown (on most podcast apps) and the Bigfoot tonite show on blogtalk radio.  You can also give midnight Walker on blogtalk a try as well. That should be plenty of BF talk to replace saschron, if you are a believer or interested in the subject you've got to see that the lies damage things in the biggest way."

People who know that this is an actual living creature feel it that when people lie and make up stories it causes a lack of credibility to the mainstream...and it does. It's already a severally ""fringe"" topic as it is...with all the hoaxes and other BS it just sets back any cause the believers/knowers even further.  If they/ SasChron advertise the show as fictional it wouldn't be a problem at all, but with them making up all these stories and hoax the listeners it just sets everything back to an already difficult subject for people to believe in the first place."

You said you don't live in the US, so I assume you don't associate with other researchers in the community very often, right? There are a lot of researchers(some good, some bad) that spend a lot of time on this subject. When someone lies about their encounter it sets us all back."
bigfoot,35feyg,ghostdate,1 point,Mon May 11 20:19:22 2015 UTC,"Other researchers get a “pass” because they research and have integrity.  Moneymaker might be a weirdo, but I don’t doubt his honesty.  And Bobo has spent more time in the field than practically anyone.  SC Inc. is a business owned by some lawyer in Texas and doesn’t have any researchers (anymore).  It’s becoming obvious (as some people have strongly suspected) they hire actors to read these stories.  Sure it might be entertaining, but it’s all a complete lie and made up crap.  It’s right out of the Dyer playbook.  It might be a profitable business, but it’s deeply insulting to anyone that takes the subject serious."

I guess he might unknowingly have talked for hours with paid actors, but that's even more ridiculous a theory.   Your accusations are crazy, and you're over dramatic as fuck. As you said, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, so where's your evidence that Wes hired actors to read made up stories for the show and that either Will knowingly or unknowingly participated.  As for the GPS tracking. He believes he's tracking them, based on reports of sightings and tracks in given areas at given times. It's not like he's saying he has them tagged with GPS tags or something, he just thinks he has a migratory pattern based on the same shit evidence every other Bigfoot researcher uses: eyewitness sightings, tracks, and broken trees."

He's not spending nearly enough time in areas because he has to keep jumping place to place to make the show more interesting.

So, does that mean they could be more closely related to us?  I really want to believe. Hell, I have been a believer all my life. The thousands of reported sightings cannot be all misidentification or liars. But what bothers me is that with all the mobile technology, why can't we get a good pic? But as I say that, every time a good pic shows up, people always are shouting FAKE FAKE FAKE.  Deep down in my heart I want to believe. It would be great to have this huge ape like creature around! But with each passing year, my hope is diminishing. I hope one day browsing the internet that proof will finally come within my lifetime."
bigfoot,35celx,barryspencer,2,Sat May 9 03:21:39 2015 UTC,"Skeptic here.   The thousands of reported sightings cannot be all misidentification or liars.   If we knew there was one genuine Bigfoot sighting for every 100 reported sightings, then we'd know a given reported sighting has a 1 percent chance of being genuine. But that's not our situation. Because no reported Bigfoot sighting has ever been confirmed, we don't know what percent of reported sightings are genuine. It could be 0 percent; that possibility has not been ruled out. So it's possible all the thousands of reported sightings are misidentification or hoax. And we don't know that possibility is unlikely."
bigfoot,35celx,Danny_Plainview,1 point,Sat May 9 04:02:08 2015 UTC,"So it's possible all the thousands of reported sightings are misidentification or hoax.    So you believe that all those thousands of people who reported seeing Bigfoot, usually sensible people who have no doubt about what they saw, are most likely either misidentifications or hoaxes? That's kind of a black and white way of looking at this topic.   All possibilities should be considered and observed instead of jumping to conclusions and crossing off plausible explanations. We don't know all the facts but just because there hasn't been a 100% confirmed sighting of bigfoot doesn't mean that some of those reports couldn't possibly be genuine.   I think a good amount of people who have had sightings of Bigfoot are intelligent enough to know the difference between other wildlife, like bears and moose, and an 8 foot bipedal, hairy humanoid creature.   It's also expected that certain people will attempt to create a hoax just to make a profit, but it doesn't mean that a report should be quickly dismissed as a hoax until it is known for sure. I think only a very small percentage are hoaxes when compared to the bigger number of genuine sightings that are reported."
bigfoot,35celx,barryspencer,1 point,Thu May 14 17:11:07 2015 UTC,"So you believe that all those thousands of people who reported seeing Bigfoot, usually sensible people who have no doubt about what they saw, are most likely either misidentifications or hoaxes?   I do believe it very likely all reported Bigfoot sightings are misidentification or hoax, yes.    crossing off plausible explanations.   I haven't ruled out any plausible explanations. Rather I'm pointing out that 1. it's possible all reported sightings are misidentification or hoax, and 2. we don't know that possibility is unlikely.  I don't claim all reported sightings must be hoax or misidentification; it's possible some reported sightings are genuine. (Though I think that unlikely.)   I think only a very small percentage are hoaxes when compared to the bigger number of genuine sightings that are reported.   We don't know what percentage of sightings not confirmed hoax or misidentification are genuine. Could be 0 percent.  One more point I'd like to make: testimony is weak evidence. Let's say 49 witnesses swore they saw me stab a guy in a public square. But there is a photograph of me withdrawing money from an ATM 20 miles away at the same time as the stabbing, along with an electronic record and printed paper receipt of the transaction.  Would you vote to convict me? I presume not. You'd figure the 49 witnesses must all be mistaken.  One piece of physical evidence can trump the testimony of dozens, hundreds, thousands of witnesses.  We're probably never going to see physical evidence that forces us to conclude that all reported Bigfoot sightings must be hoaxes or mistakes. Nevertheless, all the testimonial evidence for Bigfoot taken together is weak evidence that could be trumped by one piece of physical evidence."
bigfoot,35celx,barryspencer,3,Thu May 14 18:13:13 2015 UTC,"I don't claim all reported Bigfoot sightings must be misidentification or hoax. Rather, I said I believe it very likely all reported Bigfoot sightings are misidentification or hoax. I have good reasons to believe so.  I also said, ""I don't claim all reported sightings must be hoax or misidentification; it's possible some reported sightings are genuine.""   Many people coming forth and reporting the same sightings year after year can't be simply dismissed as a mass misidentification or a huge hoax.   Your argument is basically that it's unlikely all those people could be wrong, therefore Bigfoot is likely. My point is that we don't know it's unlikely all those people could be wrong.   If you expect someone to present you with a mountain of physical evidence or an actual specimen before you can find this creature existence plausible then that's not a logical way of thinking.   One piece of confirming physical evidence would be worth more than a mountain of testimony!   Given that Bigfoot evidence is hopelessly contaminated by hoax and misidentification, and that the best Bigfoot evidence is ambiguous, and that there is good reason to believe Bigfoot is unlikely, it's perfectly reasonable to not believe in Bigfoot until a specimen is produced.   A very rare, remote, and shy Bigfoot is plausible."

bigfoot,35celx,barryspencer,1 point,Thu May 14 21:04:33 2015 UTC,"Like you say, it would be marvelous and wonderful if Bigfoot is discovered. That's not likely, but the consolation is that we know many marvelous and wonderful animals and plants do exist, many of them yet to be discovered.   The flip side, the sad thing, of course, is that many currently existing plant and animal species will soon be extinct in the wild or extinct altogether, including some undiscovered species."

bigfoot,35celx,23eulogy23,4,Sat May 9 04:25:35 2015 UTC,"I have been researching about bigfoot for over a decade. There are two different reasons, depending on how you view sasquatch,  to why we haven't discovered recent remains. If you believe sasquatch is more animal than man you could put together the argument that bears out populate sasquatch 20 to 1. (I have heard 100 to 1 as well, But due to the multiple experiences I have had in different locations I believe the population is much higher) Finding a Bear body is EXTREMELY rare and almost unheard of to find one who has died naturally in the wild. Also animals have a strong instinct to hide when they are wounded or dying  And after they die, if it is in the setting of the forest and depending on the weather and time of year..a large animal can be picked apart by scavengers and decomposed to almost nothing  in a matter of weeks . Also the assumed habitat of BF , Pacific Northwest and Canada  is so vast it is almost hard to wrap your head around  Finally, BF as an animal has had a very long time to adapt to living in the wild and I believe is smart enough to keep away from humans..as probably most encounters with humans lead to negative consequences.  If you believe BF is more human than animal, then you could put together the argument that ancient native American tribes buried their dead..also as living in a structured tribe you wouldn't leave your family members bodies lying about to be found by enemies and scavengers. So their bodies are probably moved to some other location or flat out buried by other family members."
bigfoot,35celx,23eulogy23,5,Sat May 9 12:54:49 2015 UTC,"This. I agree with all of your points. It is entirely possible for a species to remain hidden, and it is entirely possible for it to have been branched off of one of the human trees, such as the genus homo. The lack of proof means nothing- i strongly believe they are out there. And i cant wait for them to be found. What do you think will happen when we do come upon one of these creatures?"
bigfoot,35celx,23eulogy23,2,Sat May 9 00:35:58 2015 UTC,Sadly..I believe they will be demonized and wiped out. It happens to every culture that is come upon by a more technological advanced race.
bigfoot,35celx,23eulogy23,6,Sat May 9 00:43:19 2015 UTC,"Also I would like to point out that scientifically speaking BF has already been proven to be a tangible real creature..From DNA evidence on scat, blood ,hair etc. To dermal ridges being impossible to fake in castings of footprints ..to the hundreds of thousands of eye witness reports , many from VERY credible people , including police officers and park rangers. Or the fact that PG footage has NEVER once been debunked and in fact when looked at by REAL scientists (Bigfoot : Legend Meets Science) , the consensus was its for real .I could go on and on about evidence. They want a body..and they will continue denying until a body is PUBLICLY brought to them. I'm sure they have had a body and kept it quiet. Because understanding BFs history and genetics completely goes against their version of human evolution that they have been cramming down our throats. History would have to be rewritten and they will all be proven wrong.For them ..that is a hard pill to swallow"
bigfoot,35celx,23eulogy23,2,Sat May 9 00:55:09 2015 UTC,"These are good points. I hope they arent wiped out. They are ancient history walking the earth, its beautiful. We should leave them alone, but study and acknowledge them. Maybe even teach them language. Do they even have that capability?"
bigfoot,35celx,23eulogy23,2,Sat May 9 00:52:14 2015 UTC,"There is alot of evidence that they have their own form of language. Which is what sets them apart from an animal..No animal, except mimic animals such as parrots , posses a true language.speach.That is something that is unique to humans.That is why great apes cannot speak and must learn sign language to properly communicate with humans. They do not possess the right vocal chords. BF has been found to have a true language"
bigfoot,35celx,toscott_2000,1 point,Sat May 9 00:57:46 2015 UTC,"Yea. They are very closely related to humans in the evolutionary tree, especially if they have advanced brains enough to leave tree structures and develop their own language. Do you think that they are more advanced than humans? Just because they arent speaking english doesnt mean they dont have a complicated, intricate way of communcation like ours. It may be quite interesting and deep, but we would never know because we dont speak it. And, if they are that stealthy then that might be further evidence to as why they could potentially more intelligent than us. Is it too far fetched to think they are an intelligent species?"

bigfoot,35celx,skorponok,3,Sat May 9 01:08:58 2015 UTC,"Very interesting discussion, no, an excellent discussion! These are exactly the kinds of conversations we need to be having in this community RIGHT NOW! Instead of fighting like animals we need to have exactly this affable, easily approachable conversation between people who, while having different ideas, can remain civil and have an honest and enjoyable conversation.  With that said, I'll throw in my two cents here. I am somewhat skeptical of their existence but I do believe there is a high probability they exist, simply because I have not seen proof myself. I think they most likely are some type of primate that simply hasn't been discovered yet. I really believe, if they do exist, that they probably have some sort of communication - as do chimps, gorillas, and so many other animals- made up of body language and vocalizations. I do believe they are quite intelligent, but not super intelligent. I don't give much credence to the paranormal aspect of sasquatch, either, but I will admit that may be from a personal bias; I don't really think the paranormal exists (that's not to knock anyone else's beliefs, I respect others. And the paranormal may be real for all I know)."

bigfoot,35celx,skorponok,2,Sat May 9 03:56:02 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the animal argument. Even if bigfoot was outnumbered by bears 500 to 1, I would still expect people to have encountered them and definitively recorded them as a species. I mean, they find endemic species that are only native to one tiny corner of the world all the time. Take the Cheat Mountain salamander for example. A 5 inch long salamander only found around one river and the surrounding mountains of West Virginia, yet it has been discovered and recorded by science. There are also fish in the deserts of the American southwest that can only be found in one specific water hole in the entire world, yet these too have been discovered and recorded by science. So I found it doubtful that a large species supposedly ranging across the enire continent would still go undiscovered. If we were talking about something in a tropical jungle, I'd agree with you (like Orang Pendek; I think that one is a definite possibility) but in a continent like North America, I'm a bit skeptical."
bigfoot,35celx,pm_your_squatch,3,Sat May 9 13:37:01 2015 UTC,"New species are discovered all of the time. Them being discovered does not mean they didn't exist before discovery.  You can take the NEWLY discovered Bili ape for example. A species of   ""Giant"" Chimps. They were reported by locals for decades as being ""lion killers"". Science could not find   a body or live specimen. Much like our BF friend, only nests, tracks,camera trap photos, and occasional hair samples turned up. Until finally, in 2012 the truth of their existence  came to light."
bigfoot,35celx,mannus_mortris,2,Sat May 9 13:13:25 2015 UTC,"Very true, and I'm not saying that new species aren't discovered. But the Bili ape is a different situation. From what I understand, it was discovered in a remote jungle area where scientists couldn't get into often for a variety of reasons -- terrain, civil wars, etc. Bigfoot, though, is supposedly found throughout North America, where we don't have many of those issues. We have tons of roads, plenty of access to the wilds, and no civil wars to stop people from going into the wilds and discovering such an animal."
bigfoot,35celx,toscott_2000,2,Sat May 9 14:02:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, However, How often do you see real scientists or phd's going out in the woods searching for sasquatch? Very rarely and it's always with some elaborate camera crew for the discovery channel or what not  No university or group is going to seriously fund that type of project. Any PHD who even mentions BF is ridiculed and loses their funding. The phd who claimed  patties tracks were real is still trying to get tenure 40 plus years later. They made a real example out of him. The point is no scientist is going to stake their career to do the dirty work"

I used to believe in it when I was younger, but I find it harder to do so the older I get. I just have too many questions about it. Why haven't they been definitively discovered yet? Why is there no fossil record of them being here? Why hasn't someone shot one or hit one with a car and brought the body forward? But I'll admit it's not outside the realm of possibility, and there are sightings that are hard to explain away. So basically, I don't know. I'd like to believe that such a creature is out there, but without encountering it myself, I remain doubtful. If someone does definitively prove its existence, though, I'll be cheering right along with the believers."
bigfoot,35celx,ghostdate,2,Tue May 12 22:28:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly, then digging through the internet, you can find stories about them being found after forest fires.

It seems like he's fashioning his show after that worthless Finding Bigfoot show, which is complete shit. It should be renamed to Looking for Bigfoot, because that's all those idiots are doing....looking, but never finding. I think he should set up shop in one place and just stay there. cameras running, checked, various surveillance equipment all round and so on."
bigfoot,358t8a,infotheist,21,Fri May 8 01:42:36 2015 UTC,Yup no experienced woodsman would ever be able to tell that apart from a bear.   Although I have to say it does kind of resemble a drunk dude trying to hold it together while walking to his car...
bigfoot,358t8a,Treedom_Lighter,2,Fri May 8 03:41:14 2015 UTC,"Not to be offensive, but how many so called bigfoot sightings are reported by ""experienced woodsmen""? Most of them seem to be reported (and recorded) by random people. I think if the average person --  especially someone from the city who's out in the country for a ride or a trip -- saw this walking through the brush, they'd very likely think it was a bigfoot. I suspect a lot of bigfoot sightings can be attributed to bears in some form or another."
bigfoot,358t8a,mannus_mortris,5,Fri May 8 15:01:55 2015 UTC,"Just a rough guess off the top of my head... I'd say 50%? At least?   I've read hundreds of reports and I'd have to say at least half of them are from fishermen, hunters, hikers, campers, etc. People who spend a lot of time in the woods and are experienced in identifying wildlife. These are the people who spend the most time in the remote areas where bigfoots live, and therefore are way more likely to see them.  Your city-folk who experience a road crossing on vacation is an almost-negligible minority. Rural road-crossing sightings are frequently reported, but normally by people who live in the area and are used to the local wildlife. It's just so rare an event in the first place to have happen that you normally have to drive a certain road or live in a certain area for years and years before you can even catch a fleeting glimpse.  I'm sure a few of the thousands of bigfoot sightings can be attributed to bears walking bipedally... But if you read even a dozen sighting reports you'll see that there's just absolutely no way the vast majority of these people are confusing what they're seeing with bears.   And that's not offensive at all, it's a common misconception and I'm happy to answer any other questions you may have too!"
bigfoot,358t8a,Treedom_Lighter,6,Fri May 8 17:21:06 2015 UTC,"fishermen, hunters, hikers, campers, etc. People who spend a lot of time in the woods and are experienced in identifying wildlife   I don't want to suggest the vast majority of sightings can be attributed to bears; however, being an ""experienced woodsman"" does not make anyone infallible, myself included.  Additionally, a rifle an an ATV doesn't make someone a good witness.  There are a lot of these fellers that would tell you they are experienced woodsmen.  I know a few of them and I wouldn't expect them to know a sandal print from a deer track.  While I'm not trying to dismiss all reports out of hand, my point is that everyone is capable of misidentification and regardless of the witness, the report should be examined critically.  Either way, that bear would look natty in a pair of suspenders with a pipe."
bigfoot,358t8a,Pangs,3,Fri May 8 18:11:38 2015 UTC,"Of course, point well taken. I always attempt to be skeptical of everything, despite being 100% certain that this species exists already. Many, many reports though (and I'm talking hundreds) don't simply mention an upright dark blur moving through the trees, but huge, broad-shouldered, fast-as-hell hairy men with faces that resemble a human and an ape. You should read through some if you ever get a chance, it's really fascinating when you see how many there are and how consistent in odd details they can be.   And dude... You forgot the monocle!

bigfoot,358t8a,mannus_mortris,1 point,Fri May 8 14:58:21 2015 UTC,Still impossible for a seasoned woodsman to mistake a standing bear for a Sasquatch. The bear theory is out.

(And that Montana Ghillie-suit roadkill doesn't count-- Ghillie suits don't look like Sasquatch. They look like bushes.)
bigfoot,358t8a,Teemo4evr,2,Fri May 8 16:24:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure about the bears. Experienced woodsmen might not have trouble with it, but it seems to me that reports from experienced woodsmen are few and far between. I think it's very likely that many of the sightings are bears, and many of the sounds are barred owls or other owl species (they can make some pretty wild and monkey-like noises), and that people who are ignorant about animals that 100% certainly do exist chalk unusual encounters with these species up to bigfoots. But I'm a skeptic (albeit one that's interested in the bigfoot phenomenon), and that's just my opinion."
bigfoot,358t8a,mannus_mortris,3,Fri May 8 17:01:37 2015 UTC,"Part of the problem with chalking sightings up to a standing bear are the things that many people report a bigfoot doing during a sighting. Walking up very steep slopes upright, stepping over fences, clearing wide creeks in one jump, etc. A bear walking upright might waddle along ok on totally flat ground with no obstacles, but how well do you think he'd be doing in thick underbrush (or even regular underbrush) in the woods?"
bigfoot,358t8a,barryspencer,2,Fri May 8 20:28:22 2015 UTC,"They're surprisingly agile. They could probably walk through the brush. The other things you mention...eh. I dunno. I really can't comment on those type of sightings unless I have one myself, which I unfortunately haven't."
bigfoot,358t8a,doctorphyco,1 point,Sat May 9 02:13:11 2015 UTC,"Observers, eyewitnesses, reports, testimony can be mistaken. Maybe whatever they saw didn't walk up a steep slope upright, step over fences, or clear a wide creek in one jump. Maybe they saw a human, or a bush, boulder, stump, or shadow. Maybe they embellished, embroidered, or outright invented."
bigfoot,358t8a,barryspencer,2,Fri May 8 21:24:35 2015 UTC,"Sadly, you are correct. Americans have become soft and domesticated, and few of us are at home in nature. People freak out about anything wild these days, spraying RoundUp on every ""weed"" and calling for pest control every time they see a small animal in their house or yard. I even know grown men who are terrified of tiny little spiders that weigh less than a gram. Many people can't even identify the most common of wild creatures these days."

At the time there was a huge connection between him and he film."

bigfoot,354kyz,bloglib,3,Fri May 8 00:17:51 2015 UTC,"I think he was being 100% serious and I think this whole documentary was really just a social commentary on a few legitimately delusional people.

I would put money on him physically abusing her."

I like that reddit's way more sober about the big guy than Facebook was.   I'm here for the stories.  Grew up in the Pacific coastal rainforest.  Know lots of Natives here who have seen them while out in the bush, and it's like a religious experience for them. Also love a good campfire horror story.   And the Drama. There is no drama more buttery than scammers getting called out. Seriously, the implosion of FBFB was the most amazing, most epic drama ever. Rick Dyer's last chance at credibility!  A movie where a British filmmaker gets assaulted!    You can't make this stuff up. The Bigfoot community is entertaining."

I swear to god it sounded like if a person standing a block away down the road from you at one street corner and tried to talk to you in a normal voice, I could tell it was some sort of vocalizing but I couldn't make a lick of it...

bigfoot,34ru9y,lighting92000,5,Mon May 4 17:48:06 2015 UTC,I think this show is great even if Les never finds any worthwhile evidence.

bigfoot,34ru9y,Fubarfrank,3,Mon May 4 18:54:39 2015 UTC,"Yep!  Its pretty interesting because i think it is clear that the power of suggestion can account for quite a bit of peoples' claims of Bigfoot related activity. The power of this suggestion comes from other people's previous claims, those peoples' suggestion from previous people's claims and so on. BUT where did it start? Either humans have some instinctual fear of a mythological primitive ancestor type creature or, ya know...Bigfoot. Either possibility is pretty damn cool to me"

bigfoot,34ru9y,insane_mystic,1 point,Mon May 4 17:24:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not trolling. I believe in Sasquatch. I'm just saying there would be better evidence by now if it was an ape. IMO, it's a spiritual creature, with the ability to cross into another dimension. It could be nephilim, which would explain them having extra human abilities. Also IMO, these creatures abduct and eat humans all the time but the bones of their victims aren't found because the creatures live in cave systems."
bigfoot,34ru9y,bigwilderness,2,Mon May 4 17:46:31 2015 UTC,"In my opinion it's no ape. I'm of the hominid camp, I think it could be an unknown branch or continuation of Homo Heidelbergensis.

It annoys me to no end when the Pacific Crest Trail (2650 mile trail along the mountain crests) Is refered to as the Pacific Coast Trail (an 1800 mile road biking trail near the coast).  Good story though.
bigfoot,34d7rq,Jhp34,13,Thu Apr 30 05:13:22 2015 UTC,"I'd say the footprints/casts. That is physical evidence of the presence of an animal. It is the simplest logic. If you find a deer print, then a deer was there at some point. If you find a BF print, then a BF was there. The only question is whether the print is authentic.  When you consider the sheer number of prints found, the long stride lengths, remote locations and types of terrain traversed, dermal ridges, the picture becomes more clear.  You also have to consider the context in which the prints were found. Some of the witnesses saw the thing that made the prints or had some other kind of activity going on. It seems unlikely to me that EVERY SINGLE BF PRINT in all of history was a hoax or fake."
bigfoot,34d7rq,40thStreetBlack,10,Thu Apr 30 14:40:29 2015 UTC,"Don't leave off the required weight necessary to leave deep impressions.   When you combine the long stride length, articulated toes, malleable foot pads with detritus deformations, and the required weight necessary to leave such large, deep prints, often with undisturbed surrounding area... explain a rationale means to fakery.  I going to try to keep the wall of text to a minimum, but while supervising a Boy Scout hike where the youth leadership had made an incorrect compass turn and was leading us further away from our intended destination, I made the decision to stop and return to the camp. We were then well inside of the National Forest that bordered this camp and entire forest was supposed to be off limits to Scouts. I too made the decision on the path taken back to camp.   In other words, I was not lead to the site of the footprints. Ten to fifteen yards in either direction would have had us missing the prints entirely.  Along a small creek bed were five foot prints in otherwise undisturbed red clay typical for the area. The prints showed every indication of having been made by a malleable, flesh and blood foot, including clear articulation of the toes, and deformation caused by small pebbles and debris. The first of the two left prints visible showed slippage of the heal off to the left.  I'm 6'2"", 210lbs and I barely made a 1/8 inch impression in the clay. These prints were approximately 1 inch deep at their deepest points of the heel and ball. The surrounding area was undisturbed.  We were several hundred yards away from where we should have been and our direction of travel back to camp was made by me without prompting.  I am left with two option: the prints were faked and left there for us to find by parties unknown, in an area we were not suppose to be in and without our being aware of the hoaxers presence. In order to be fakes, the hoaxers had to somehow produce prosthetics very much mimicking a living foot of sizable proportions including ten independent, articulating toes, and then stride along the edge of a creek with a stride length I can only approach at a bounding run, have one foot partially slip off of a smooth creek rock without breaking stride, and do so while conveying a weight far in excess of 450 lbs.  Or the prints were left by an unknown, bipedal entity of significant proportions and weight."
bigfoot,34d7rq,bartman279,7,Thu Apr 30 17:33:27 2015 UTC,"My question: what are the odds that anyone would have seen those prints before they were obliterated by the next rainstorm, passing deer hooves, and other natural phenomena?  I think a lot of the footprints would have a 1/100 to 1/10000 chance of ever being seen."
bigfoot,34d7rq,doctorphyco,2,Thu Apr 30 18:00:54 2015 UTC,"If you consider the number of tracks that have been found in extremely remote locations where very few people go, and that tracks don't last forever, any track hoaxers must have laid hundreds of them down for every one that was found. So, to explain the footprint evidence as just a bunch of hoaxers, we would have to invoke an army of well-financed teams, each with satchels full of multiple carved feet, all carefully made (with midtarsal breaks and dermal ridges) in well-equipped workshops. Next, we have to explain how they lay these tracks down with long stride lengths in rough terrain, without disturbing the soil around them. The most obvious method is with a small hovercraft of some sort, with the hoaxer leaning down to stamp the prints (as they are generally driven deep, he may need some sort of hydraulic device to pound the carved feet into the soil). Possibly extraterrestrials are involved in this hypothetical hoax project, as they have the best flying craft that could handle the requirements to create these prints."
bigfoot,34d7rq,doctorphyco,0,Thu Apr 30 17:21:42 2015 UTC,"That seems to be the argument from ignorance: We don't know how these footprints were hoaxed, therefore Bigfoot."

bigfoot,34d7rq,doctorphyco,-1,Sun May 3 04:42:49 2015 UTC,"The logical analysis of Bigfoot evidence is: all Bigfoot evidence to date could be faked, and no Bigfoot specimen has been collected, the strong implication being that there are probably no Bigfoots.  We've been over the meaning of likely and unlikely before. You don't need to do statistical analysis to know it's unlikely I have a one-ton diamond in my backyard.  Rather, you do a quick inductive logical operation in your head. You know one-ounce diamonds are rare, and you know the rule that the bigger the diamond the rarer, so you can quickly determine that it's highly unlikely I have a one-ton diamond in my backyard."
bigfoot,34d7rq,barryspencer,2,Sun May 3 08:32:11 2015 UTC,"People use the words ""likely"" and ""unlikely"" a lot, that's for sure. But they seem to not really understand them, at least how they are used in the scientific sense, rather than just as ammo in internet debate.  You are absolutely correct that the no-Bigfoot opinion is based on quick thoughts that floated into people's heads, not on statistics, science, or an openminded examination of the evidence.  As you correctly pointed out, ""you don't need to do statistical analysis"" if you have already made up your mind. I have done enough internet argument to know that you're never going to convince anyone of anything. But that's OK.   Lack of logical thought is a good thing. Life would be tough if we had to do extensive mathematical and scientific analysis of every decision that we have to make in life."
bigfoot,34d7rq,doctorphyco,0,Sun May 3 20:11:10 2015 UTC,"Okay, let's say I claim I have a one-ton diamond buried in my backyard. Calculate the odds my claim is correct.  You could chart a representative sample of existing diamonds and determine the weight:rarity ratio curve. Then you could extrapolate that curve out to a one-ton diamond and thereby calculate the odds an average person owns a one-ton diamond.

Yes, there are questionable accounts here and there--  reports of what COULD be a distant hiker or hunter, or where there is no visual confirmation, or where the person seems to be clamoring for attention or admission to ""the club."" But so many accounts have been examined by thousands, and even the skeptics can't make a strong case that those individuals are mistaken."

bigfoot,34d7rq,Simonthefish,-1,Thu Apr 30 19:34:35 2015 UTC,No reported Bigfoot sighting has ever been confirmed. It's not as if 1 percent of reported sightings of Bigfoot are confirmed. Zero are confirmed. Zero.  That's the strong argument that it's very likely all reported sightings of Bigfoot are hoax or misidentification. The problem is not with the strength of that argument; it's plenty strong enough. The problem is slothful induction on the part of Bigfoot believers.
bigfoot,34d7rq,barryspencer,3,Sat May 2 18:58:52 2015 UTC,"Confirmation is done by humans. The sightings on the BFRO website have all been reviewed, the witnesses assessed, and the encounter then either confirmed or not confirmed by serious-minded researchers.  Of course, a lazy urban armchair skeptic can wave his magic wand and declare all sightings ""unconfirmed"" without examining the evidence or attempting to gain any experience or knowledge on the topic. That's his right.   Likewise, we have the right to examine the evidence put forth by the Sasquatch Chronicles hosts, compare their account to weather records and geographical data, and decide whether we can confirm their encounter."
bigfoot,34d7rq,doctorphyco,0,Sat May 2 21:48:54 2015 UTC,Confirmed doesn't mean you listened to the eyewitness testimony and decided to believe it. Confirmed means government wildlife experts went to the area where Bigfoots were reported and determined that Bigfoots were indeed present.

There is an apparent lack of Bigfoot specimens. There are two theories that account for observations. One theory is that Bigfoots don't exist. Another theory is that Bigfoot exists and a mysterious government agency that hides all Bigfoot specimens exists.   Both theories account for the apparent lack of Bigfoot specimens, but one theory is simpler than the other. We should favor the simpler theory unless reason and evidence compels us otherwise.  All the available Bigfoot evidence could be hoax or misidentification. There is zero evidence of a government agency that hides all Bigfoot specimens, and nobody has proposed a plausible motivation for this agency. So we are not compelled by reason or evidence to favor the existence-and-coverup theory over the simpler nonexistence theory.  We should therefore favor the simpler theory."

For some reason the descriptions of them looking and sounding human-like are the most fascinating to me.

bigfoot,34d7rq,dingboodle,7,Thu Apr 30 06:22:09 2015 UTC,"Everything BF starts and ends with this.  If it is fake no one seems to be able to debunk it.  If it is real...it is BF!!    If we can't definitively say, then every piece of film is suspect and no evidence we find (unless it is ""better"" than the PG film) makes any difference."
bigfoot,34d7rq,DramFan,6,Thu Apr 30 17:27:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed. This piece of film has been the best thing we've gotten. Ever.  The only other footage that comes close is Todd Standings stuff, but almost none of that is credible."
bigfoot,34d7rq,LoveExperimentation,0,Thu Apr 30 19:12:39 2015 UTC,"The PG film hasn't been surpassed in 48 years. There are now 204 million smartphones with video cameras in the US and Canada, and more people than ever venture into the wilderness, yet nobody has managed to get better pictures of Bigfoots.   The strong implication is that Bigfoots never existed, or existed but after 1967 became either extinct or very rare and remote.  There's still a plausible possibility of very rare, remote, and shy Bigfoots. But there is no plausible possibility of Bigfoots anywhere but in the most remote areas. So we know, for example, that the Lettuce Lake video is almost certainly a hoax."
bigfoot,34d7rq,barryspencer,3,Sun May 3 19:06:01 2015 UTC,"No, we don't know that. At all. Patterson and Gimlin were in the remote woods of Northern California on horseback for weeks with the express purpose of capturing a bigfoot on camera. Those conditions are very rarely replicated these days, besides the simple luck of running into a reclusive primate in the wild, so there's no definitive correlation whatsoever between the lack of similar evidence and the amount OR location of other potential bigfoots."
bigfoot,34d7rq,Treedom_Lighter,2,Sun May 3 22:10:31 2015 UTC,"Lettuce Lake Park is visited by well over 1 million people a year, abuts a university campus, and is 13 minutes from the center of a major metropolitan area with a population over 2.8 million and a region with a population exceeding 4.2 million. If there were Bigfoots in such places, there would almost certainly be video surpassing PG."
bigfoot,34d7rq,barryspencer,2,Sun May 3 23:10:28 2015 UTC,"What if that one was simply passing through? You have no idea of the circumstances and neither does anyone else. If it's a hoax, it's a phenomenal one. You need two things for a bigfoot encounter: a person and a bigfoot. If there are no people, there would be no video. Just look how fast this one escapes from view. Or in the Patterson film. They're always fleeting encounters and not everyone has the ability to get a camera out fast enough, but these potential videos ARE increasing with the amount of cell phone cameras now. Sure, they can't be called definitive, but they also can't be ruled out."
bigfoot,34d7rq,Treedom_Lighter,0,Mon May 4 00:01:23 2015 UTC,"The Lettuce Lake incident by itself doesn't tell us how rare, remote, and shy Bigfoots are. It's just one data point.  But many incidents together form a picture. Likewise, many missing incidents together form a picture in negative. Missing are videos that surpass PG, videos we would expect to see if Bigfoots are sometimes present in densely populated regions.  Those missing videos strongly imply that Bigfoots are never or nearly never present in heavily populated regions. It's so unlikely a Bigfoot wandered through Lettuce Lake Park that hoax is by far the more likely explanation for observations.  The most likely explanations for the best Bigfoot videos not improving are nonexistence, rarity, remoteness, and shyness.   Bigfoot cleverness (they understand what camera traps are) and human incompetence (they can't whip their smartphones out fast enough) and lack of intrepidness (I got scared and ran!) can't account for the missing videos, because unless Bigfoots are very rare, remote, and shy, Bigfoots will inevitably blunder into camera traps, and enough humans will encounter Bigfoots that inevitably some of those humans will whip their smartphones out in time, stand their ground, and bring home video that surpasses PG."
bigfoot,34d7rq,barryspencer,0,Mon May 4 04:26:18 2015 UTC,No. None of what you just claimed is true. And repeating yourself a thousand times doesn't make it true either. I don't know why I fucking bother.

bigfoot,34d7rq,barryspencer,4,Mon May 4 18:27:53 2015 UTC,"I'd have to agree with /u/40thStreetBlack... It's the collective data gathered from the footprint evidence. Thousands of tracks from all over the continent, anatomically and physiologically consistent, and occasionally even consistent in their pathologies. The sizes of the tracks form a bell curve when graphed, indicating a living species with every size and age represented, and casting serious doubt that these could be fabricated and planted by even the most organized shadow group of hoaxsters.   For me, the big four pieces are the PGF, the Sierra Sounds, the Cripplefoot tracks and the Skookum body cast. They all corroborate each other as well as a thousand other footprint casts and a hundred thousand witness testimonies."
bigfoot,34d7rq,Treedom_Lighter,1 point,Fri May 1 00:20:49 2015 UTC,Wouldn't the sizes of hoax footprints follow a bell curve when graphed?
bigfoot,34d7rq,barryspencer,2,Sun May 3 18:25:58 2015 UTC,"Highly doubtful. That would require a near-impossible amount of organization between hundreds of hoaxers spread across the country to represent all ages and sizes, placing tracks in remote locations hoping they're eventually found before they're wiped out by the elements. The effort required to simulate this makes it very improbable. Unless there's a vast, cohesive hoaxer group out there that is (for some reason) intent on keeping the sasquatch mystery going instead of immediately discounting it altogether."

Excerpt:  ""The normal distribution overall argues compellingly against any alternative hy­pothesis to the existence of the Sasquatch as a cryptic species, in that pro­duction of fictitious data over 40 years by hundreds of people independently of each other would have generated a distribution with many peaks (Sapunov 1988).""  [me] I'm going to subject the above claim to reasoned scrutiny. First I'll have to find and read Sapunov 1988.  EDIT: Well, I can't find Sapunov, Valentin B. A Mathematical Analysis of “Snowman” (Wildman) Eyewitness Reports. Crypto­zoology. 1988. 7: 61—65.  But I expect hoaxers making independent decisions about foot length would produce a normal distribution. You (Treedom_Lighter) concur, but you would expect the curve to not reflect sexual dimorphism and juveniles.  Fahrenbach writes:  ""The distribution... [is] more peaked than a normal distribution. This aspect is not supportive of a significant sexual dimorphism...""  [me] The distribution is not bimodal."
bigfoot,34d7rq,barryspencer,1 point,Sun May 3 23:42:19 2015 UTC,"The multimodal theory is that most hoax prints are made by a few dedicated hoaxers who keep using the same trusty carved feet. The Russian scientist doesn't realized that there is a massive hoaxing conspiracy with all sorts of feet being distributed, with individual teams of hoaxers carrying a variety of differently-shaped foorprints. Many of the tracks show lots of variations in toe splay, strike patterns, and foot flexion.  In order to get the required stride length without leaving human disturbance in the area, the hoaxers are using ziplines, cherry-pickers, and/or hovercraft.  To get the deep imprints beyond what a man's strength can do, they are using either sledgehammers or jackhammers. I am not sure how they are installing the tracks around campers and cabins without waking people up.  The challenge for hoax theorists is to demonstrate how all the footprints patterns were manufactured. A few individuals have come forward to claim they were responsible, but none of them have been able to duplicate the track patterns that have been found. Usually after making a few shallow footprints for the TV cameras, they stumble and fall like they were wearing clownshoes."
bigfoot,34d7rq,doctorphyco,1 point,Tue May 5 18:54:58 2015 UTC,"No organized conspiracy of print hoaxers is needed to account for observations.  I couldn't find the Sapunov paper, so I don't know how he arrived at his conclusion that hoax prints would have ""generated a distribution with many peaks."" I don't even know for sure that Sapunov made that claim.   Okay I found this excerpt from a 1988 Sapunov paper titled A Mathematical Analysis of “Snowman” Eyewitness Reports:  “The mathematical theory of testimonies was developed mainly on data from traffic incidents (Rossinsky 1984). According to the theory, the distribution of quantitative characters of observed items within a group of witnesses must be normal or Guassian. Subjective biases on the part of witnesses tend to displace the mode of distribution. The qualifications or educational backgrounds of witnesses influence the variance of distribution: the higher the qualifications or education, the less is the variance of distribution.  “According to the theory of testimonies, the extremes of the quantitative traits reported by a group of independent witnesses should be distributed in the tail or tails of a normal or Guassian distribution if the data are authentic (Rossinsky 1984). False reports would be distributed with many peaks, and without tails. The existence of one or two modes suggests a single direction of hoaxing – which is unlikely – or the objective reality of the reports.""  [me] Seems to me Sapunov might reason that because the theory of testimonies predicts hoax footprint lengths would form a many-peaked distribution, but Bigfoot print lengths follow a normal distribution, Bigfoot prints are likely not hoaxed.  If that's his reasoning, there are several problems with it."
bigfoot,34d7rq,barryspencer,1 point,Tue May 5 19:16:41 2015 UTC,"The ""no bigfoot"" theorists explain the data as resulting from a large number of hoaxers. Their next step is to  explain who these people are, why they are doing it, and how they are doing it. Unfortunately, they haven't been able to accomplish that from their coffeeshops and grandparents' basements. Yes, it is possible that the large numbers of dedicated hoaxers required to explain the data could all be operating independently. However, given the scope and difficulty of the task, it appears that there would have to be some organized effort to accomplish this (a ""conspiracy,"" if you will).   The independent-hoaxer theory cannot explain the data. However, we know that there are some hoaxers, and thus probably some hoax footprints. The field of Bigfoot research is made more difficult because of the possibility of hoax ""evidence"" being swept up into the database of legitimate evidence. Ruling out hoax prints is a time-consuming process.   Given that most Bigfoot prints are in the 15 to 18 inch range, and that their measurement is inherently inaccurate because of rounding, track erosion, and shifting edges, we would not expect to extract from the data proof of a smooth continuum made by hundreds of different-sized Bigfoots (or hundreds of different-sized hoaxers with their model feet and other apparatus), or of some sharp mode because many of the footprints came from a single  Bigfoot or single carved footstamp.  In order to get to the bottom of the mystery, we need to study both hoaxers and Bigfoot. If there are so many hoaxers, why haven't we caught any of them on trailcams? Or in the act, with carved feet, sledgehammers, and harnesses?  Hoaxing footprints in the wilderness is tedious work; you need to lay down thousands in hope that one or two will be found. And in general, you won't get to see the fruits of your labor. Therefore, most footprint hoaxery is obviously done in well-traveled areas where the probability of a human finding them is high, not in remote areas.   Making blurry videos and photos is much more fun and provides immediate gratification. It stands to reason that most of the hoaxery is done in that arena, and that most of the remote footprints are genuine."
bigfoot,34d7rq,doctorphyco,1 point,Tue May 5 20:27:51 2015 UTC,"If there are so many hoaxers, why haven't we caught any of them on trailcams?   That's a good, and, so far as I know, original question.  It may be hoaxers have been caught on trailcams.  Hoaxers go into the woods, do their dirty deeds, and depart. So they don't spend a lot of time in the woods where they can be caught on trailcams.  I agree that the more remote the footprint, the more likely it's genuine."

The armchair skeptics, for whatever reason, feel entitled to dismiss ALL the evidence without examination. Just because.  True, I make fun of the smug commentators who wear post-Halloween-sale labcoats, play scientist on the internet,  and pretend to be the Voice of Reason but are actually clueless about any of the branches of science --  primatology, ecology, ethology, human cognition, statistics, anthropology -- that would allow them to actually analyze the evidence and make sense of it.

So you have to resort to arguing that it would be difficult to fake a particular footprint, and it's unlikely anyone would make the required effort, therefore Bigfoot is the more likely explanation.  Yet we know hoaxers sometimes expend tremendous effort to ply their craft.

They are just funny little men in hipster glasses and fedoras who are afraid of the wilderness.  In the eyes of the deniers and coffeeshop skeptics, anyone who calls prints fake is automatically an ""expert"" and anyone who examines the evidence with a critical eye is a conspiracy theorist. As I pointed out elsewhere, leading primatologists like George Schaller and Jane Goodall have not dismissed all the evidence.  In reality, much of the footprint evidence has NOT been demonstrated to have been faked and cannot be explained in terms of hoaxery. Read ""Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science"" by Jeff Meldrum for some expert analysis."
bigfoot,34d7rq,doctorphyco,1 point,Sun May 3 04:53:02 2015 UTC,"Those who claim a Bigfoot print is fake have the burden of proof. Those who claim a Bigfoot print is genuine have the burden of proof.   But if I claim a Bigfoot print may be fake, I only have to prove it may be fake. That's a low bar indeed, as any footprint in a soft material can be faked. That is, people are capable of making any impressed shape. So any Bigfoot print may have been faked. The claim that any and all Bigfoot prints may be fake is true.  So we're back to inductive arguments about what's likely and unlikely: is it likely a particular footprint was faked? Is it likely all Bigfoot prints are fake? You can argue that it would be difficult to fake a particular footprint, the implication being that it's more likely Bigfoot made the print than a hoaxer made it. But that argument has several weaknesses. One is that a clever hoaxer may have figured out how to easily fake a print that would otherwise be difficult to fake; what appears to be a difficult-to-fake print may have been relatively easy to fake. Another is that it fails to take into account the fact that no Bigfoot specimens have been collected, a fact that strongly implies all Bigfoot prints are fake."

He grew up in Fouke Arkansas a small rural town. The locals would spend a lot of time socializing at a small cafe, and in each others homes, etc. He lost his father during the depression Era and would hang out with his brothers and the local men at that cafe. He worked picking cotton and was forced to stop school after 4th grade.  All day every day he spent in the fields working and then helping his mother care for 6 siblings.  So, that being said....gossip was rampant during those days. He said they talked all day about everyone and who knew what. Nothing was a secret around that town. Now there was a friend who was a bit wealthier than them, and his father and grandfather was becoming more and more upset about a black family moving in. They would complain and complain about it, and we're determined to do whatever it took to make them leave.  So, one day someone joked about scaring them away. Another suggested wearing a monkey suit. The plan had been set. Soon it was put into action. They began terrorizing the black families that had moved in.   The kid who's father started it all is the same guy who made the headlines back in the 70s, when the movie came out. He has a book and everything.  They still live in that area to this day.

If they want to scientifically debunk the Patterson film, explain how corroborating footprints were found and how someone in a costume could flex and splay their toes in 15 1/2"" monkey suit feet.   I get that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, but the Patterson film and footprint casts ARE extraordinary evidence. They deserve the respect of skeptics, not to be ignored because you heard a rumor that Patterson was shady. To me, that's the opposite of skepticism."
bigfoot,33u4ta,Treedom_Lighter,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:47:24 2015 UTC,"Well, Skeptoid is a blog and a podcast -- I'm not sure what would or would not make it ""science.""   Reputation evidence is a reliable source for impeaching someone's credibility. Patterson was shady guy, and was known to be a shady guy. Unfortunately for true believers, 40 years of time passing hasn't yet whitewashed his rep.   How were corroborating footprints found? I don't know ... couldn't you hoax both? True believers love to severely limit the abilities of a hoaxer. So you film the walk once, and double back and doctor the prints. Or, you make sure the figure in the suit is wearing the fake feet you want to ultimately use, and you do it all at once.   There is no good evidence of toe splay between the footprints. And the mid-tarsal break is an awesome example of true believer logic. Use the finding of that break in other faked footprints as evidence that ... more faked footprints are in fact real footprints. There is no reason to believe bigfoot, if they existed, had a mid tarsal break -- other than their appearance in these footprints.   The alternative theory is actually quite simple: that is how a god damn fake foot would bend as you walked if your foot was significantly smaller than the sole."
bigfoot,33u4ta,aleahey,0,Sun Apr 26 18:53:37 2015 UTC,"Here is a photo of the left footprint of the Patterson subject.  Those are not human feet making folds in plastic feet making those ridges, they're dynamic pressure ridges made by a living creature with feet that big. Ignoring anatomical consistency between thousands of tracks found all over the country is not being skeptical, it's ignoring anatomical consistency. If these footprints were fossilized, they'd be sufficient to classify this species from the existing evidence. That's a fact.   A foot inside a big fake foot wouldn't leave folds in the middle of the foot, they'd result in certain areas of the track not being pushed down as far because the wearer wouldn't be able to apply even pressure over the whole track. But if you think a costumed foot could result in a track that pristine and lifelike, then it's not worth debating because we just won't get anywhere.  And what's your source for Patterson being a shady guy? There's a guy writing a book right now who has interviewed about 40 people that knew him personally and each one has said he was as genuine and honest a guy as you'd ever want to meet. It's no more scientific than what Skeptoid is claiming about him, but it shows that it's not worth blowing off the best evidence for the species because a few people said bad things about him."
bigfoot,33u4ta,Treedom_Lighter,2,Tue Apr 28 15:24:08 2015 UTC,"Those are not human feet making folds in plastic feet making those ridges...   Declaring it summarily doesn't make said declaration any more correct.   Look further in to dermal ridges. They've been found on known hoaxes. Its an artifact of the process of making the cast, nothing more.   Your claim of footprints being fossilized being enough to declare a species is laughable. We have 10 partial remains of Homo floresiensis and there is still a real debate as to whether or not it constitutes a distinct species. Where are you even pulling these claims from? Footprints != species  I contend a flexing foot could absolutely make the impression you are  pointing to. Moreover, a boot with a pair of raised soles, one for the front half of the foot and one for the back, could also make the same impression, with the lesser indentation in the middle.  The point is, there is no reason to believe a bigfoot would have a mid tarsal break. We've just decided that since many of the footprints have that trait, that is something bigfoots have. Its absurd. As I said, it is infinitely more plausible that it is a side effect of the hoaxing process. Also, I do enjoy the fact that true believers don't summarily throw out any footprints that don't exhibit the mid tarsal break, as they would if they really believed the nonsense they are pushing.   If that crappy footage and the interpretations true believers have tried to come up with (I think I see a pregnant family of three in the background, how about you?) is the ""best evidence for the species"" then we may as well pack up and go home -- there is nothing out there."

bigfoot,33s6iz,ghostdate,1 point,Sat Apr 25 09:22:18 2015 UTC,"In my humble opinion, that doesn't sound like language.  When I hear someone speaking spanish, It does sound like gibberish.  But even if it's fast, it has obvious and annunciated syllables.  I might not know what they all mean, but ""yo soy"" sounds different than ""gusta.""  Even thick Russian accents, where the words run together, still has obvious and discernible syllables.  The name Romanov is three syllables.  ""Rom"" sounds different than ""an"" sounds different than ""ov.""  The recordings in this video were several different sounds.  But they weren't several different sounds together.  A grunt was a grunt, then it stopped making noise.  a burp was a burp, then it stopped making noise.  There isn't enough difference within the same ""sentence"" for it to be an intelligible language.  As much as it's cool when Chewbacca has an entire languages based in roars, or R2-D2 in beeps, it takes a VERY long time to convey a message that way, in reality.

There was absolutely no reason to blow off the Lettuce Lake Skunk Ape footage because the kid who filmed it is in a band with a kid who makes cryptozoological art. I'm convinced that was a real bigfoot in that footage."

bigfoot,33o93h,doctorphyco,8,Fri Apr 24 17:51:02 2015 UTC,"That's the point.    The research either points towards existence, or points against it.  We have loads of incidental reports that may justify looking for this thing, but if decades of repeated research find nothing, then we have to lean to your side of ""it doesn't exist"".    This would raise the questions of ""well, what is happening to the people who swear they see things"" and ""what are those things that look like big footprints""?  But with something like this, it's all about decades of research.  It's less than 10 years ago when the Bili chimp/Bondo ape was photographed after about a hundred years of claims."

The strung up coyote or dog hasn't had time to freeze yet, as you can tell by the way it sways. This just strikes me as odd. But it's possible it was a recent kill, i guess.   It just seems so fake.

I'm not an expert on Sasquatch, and have not spent the time in Nordegg as he has, so I wont call for a witch hunt.   All I'm saying is that the idea of an elusive species being kept from public discovery due to possible protection of lands and getting in the way of corporate greed would not be that all surprising, and may be an interesting approach to explore this topic."

bigfoot,33ln21,Skvtr,5,Sat Apr 25 18:25:24 2015 UTC,"I always thought about this. Assuming that BFs are real and with the increase interest in the subject I can't help but think that there might be a race against the clock to destroy the species. Assuming that they are real the government must know they are there. Plus if the species is still being debated this would be the time to remove as many of them as possible. Idk, what do yall think about this/the helicopter story?"
bigfoot,33ln21,bzsteele,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:18:04 2015 UTC,"This is a scenario which I have thought about for quite some time. If I ever came into A LOT of money, and I mean like 8-figure Poweball money, this is an en devour I would pursue. Being a former special operations capable Marine, I seriously think a well funded search using capable operators would be the only sure way to secure hard evidence.   My plan would entail 1-3 months of using former/current Tier 1 operators/contractors being inserted in 1 or more BF hot-spots, backed up by QRF, air support and steady stream of re-supply to keep them in the bush for the duration. Outfit them with the gear/comms they are accustomed and the motivation of high financial reward if a specimen in retrieved (dead or alive).  In my opinion these are the only folks whom would be capable of remaining in type of terrain and environment for an extended period, all the while being able to actively track and triangulate ANYTHING that moved out there. The financial gain from any specimen recovered would be ASTRONOMICAL. Think about all the people who would pay for samples/information/research recovered from a BF specimen. The biotech money alone would MORE than recoup any costs invested in obtaining the aforementioned specimen(s).   Now, that being said, I think it's more than reasonable to speculate that the government/PTB and/or any subcontracted MIC/PMC folks might have already decided this is more than worth the cost of setting out to do just what I have in mind. So, in my mind it's not that far out of an idea; save the fact that it's coming from a known horse-shitter like Standing.  P.S. Any hedgefunders/trustfunders/PMC management folks who might read this and think it's a good idea, PM me and we'll set it up... ;0)"

bigfoot,33ln21,AnalogPen,5,Sun Apr 26 02:35:13 2015 UTC,Todd's just obsessed. Bending every fact to fit his theories. Making claims and jumping to conclusions. That goes a long way to discredit him even more. He's doing nobody a service by being so crazy about this. Why not just lay out the facts and then see how sceptics deal with them.

You either are him, desperately trying to get a good word out for yourself and failing, or you've seen his penis and have spent more than an hour marvelling at it.  Regardless, your hostility is unwarranted so knock it the fuck off."
bigfoot,33ln21,HairlessSasquatch,2,Thu Apr 23 21:34:58 2015 UTC,"Or, you know, calling someone a fraud and a hoaxer without being able to back it up is just kind of a shitty thing to do? I defend Standing, because everything I've seen ""debunking"" his footage is extremely flimsy.   His face could fit in the Bigfoot faces? So could just about any persons face, because we all have similar proportions.   His sister was a make up artist, maybe? Yeah, so is my sister, it's like a 6 week course. She does wedding makeovers and couldn't make a Bigfoot face if her life depended on it, just like the vast majority of makeup artists, making the assumption that she's a special effects makeup artist with no evidence to support it is silly.   He wouldn't take the Finding Bigfoot crew into the territory he researches? I wouldn't either, they bring a huge crew with them and just cause a ruckus everywhere they go. If I was habituation myself into an environment to try to make a species comfortable with me, I wouldn't want to bring in 10+ people who are going to make a buttload of noise and make the local species distrust you.  I think Todd wants to believe too hard, like when Les was pointing out the antler rubbings on the tree, and Todd was adamant it was Bigfoot. I don't think he's a hoaxer, I just think he might be interpreting some things incorrectly, and really believes what he's saying. I think it's kind of stupid to claim to be skeptical and just flat out call Standing a hoaxer when the only evidence supporting it are flimsy at best and from basically an unknown armchair skeptic.   If I was being persecuted the way Standing is by the Bigfoot community, I would be just as hesitant to show any other evidence I might have. There's basically two routes as I see it. He could show everything he's got, and probably get called a hoaxer again, or he can bide his time, and try to get better, stronger evidence before coming out with anything else. I'd probably go the second route personally."

bigfoot,33m5al,Dvdrckr,2,Thu Apr 23 18:57:44 2015 UTC,"""Fakes""  Nobody has proven he's faked anything yet, everyone has just decided he did.   The proper statement when encountering Standing footage is to be skeptical. I don't agree with saying its a fake when the people trying to discredit him have pointed out some pretty flimsy and ludicrous points, like his face matching up with the faces in his videos, when that would be true for anyone, because human facial proportions are generally pretty similar, save for some outliers. People say his sister is a special effects make up artist, because her website apparently claimed she was a make up artist at one point. That doesn't necessarily indicate a special effects artist. The people that do make up for weddings or proms are considered make up artists as well.   I'm fine with skepticism of Standing's work, I'm skeptical of it myself, particularly the face shots. I've never seen one myself, so I can't say for certain what the facial hair is like, but reports seem to vary a fair bit. I just don't think it's fair to go around saying it's fake like it's been verified, I'd prefer to just advise others to be skeptical."

bigfoot,33jjwp,Mephisto92,2,Thu Apr 23 14:15:37 2015 UTC,"Me and my girlfriend were out for a hike today We went to some caves located by little huson lake on vancouver island This lake is very isolated and well into the woods, a turn off the only highway in the area that goes for 2 hours through only woods and forest area And to our knowledge we were the only ones there, there were no other vehicles there and it would be a hell of a walk to get to where we were... Once we finished up at the caves we drove a short way down to the lake itself We were down at the lake and the path to get there was right on the edge of the lake and kind of flooded We went for a dip then went and were laying on this rock with my dog I heard a weird whooping noise come from across the lake... Then we heard like the sound of someone walking on gravel or big rocks being moved around That grinding noise And it sounded like someone talking but too far away to make out words (people say when they have a sighting sometimes it sounds like talking but they can't understand words, like someone talking but too far away) I was ready for someone to pop out around the corner But No one did... My dog ran up the trail after he clearly heard what we heard My girlfriend heard bushes russel And when I caught up to my dog up the path he was looking up this bank into the woods There was no one in the parking lot when we got to my truck and didn't come across anyone on the drive back towards the highway except one vehicle headed out to the caves we just left... It was just so weird We were swimming for a bit and the water was quite cold so we were making quite a lot of sound before laying back and relaxing on the rock I mentioned Before we sat down we heard a splash in the lake just beside us, but we attributed that to a fish, but it happened about 3 times and the ripples were in the same 3 foot by 3 foot area each time... We didn't see a fish, could that have been something throwing rocks into the lake beside us? Maybe 10-15 minutes after that was when we heard the walking and weird voice sound We fucked off after this I wish we stuck around and looked up in the woods to where my dog was looking... Maybe tracks could have been found..."
bigfoot,33jjwp,Mephisto92,1 point,Mon May 4 05:46:47 2015 UTC,Sorry for the delayed reply. But did you think about going back later to look or anything? Or have you been back to check the place out?
bigfoot,33hx3y,goodbytes,11,Wed Apr 22 17:38:10 2015 UTC,"Come on, I really want to believe. But this is extremely weak ""evidence""."
bigfoot,33hx3y,kwiltse123,2,Wed Apr 22 21:26:11 2015 UTC,"I think I disagree. That's a big healthy tree there, not a weak or dead one and would be incredibly difficult and dangerous to fell like that. I saw the original video about a year ago and checked out this guy's channel ""Unseen Seven."" He seems to be some sort of ""rap artist"" but judging from his few music videos looks to be more of a guy who makes music and videos as a hobby. Really trippy Star Wars and illuminati themed stuff with cheesy over the top CG like you would see on Adult Swim at 3am. Here's my point: If this guy was going to make Bigfoot hoax videos to generate buzz or views for his channel he would use liberal amounts of the same CG he clearly loves... Not these elaborate ""practical effects"" like the falling tree and the nests and structures he filmed. I know some guys who screw with the same kinds of video editing/CG software and they go all-in with it. Every time. Just looking at the dude I can't see him and his girlfriend and his pit bull in the woods for hours on end constructing these structures and nests with great detail just for a few seconds of film. You can hear it in his voice he's genuinely scared and mind-blown. Not to mention he nearly got killed by that tree. Anyone who has ever cut down a tree knows that it could fall in any direction at any time and get the hell out of the way. I doubt he would stand directly in the kill zone while his buddy used a silent chainsaw just to capture an inconclusive video. Was it a sasquatch? Who knows it could just as easily been an alien or a T-Rex. Something pushed that thing over and this guy froze. Another observation I had was of Unseen Seven's subsequent videos where he is hiking around the woods searching for Bigfoot and clearly has no idea what he is doing. But this same dude put together some of the most believable structures and nests and just added the chewed on limbs and other intriguing details? I just can't see that. If this guy got a wild hair up his ass and decided to hoax all this he couldn't pull off anything near what he filmed."
bigfoot,33hx3y,ViralOner,8,Thu Apr 23 03:27:08 2015 UTC,"His dog didn't care about the giant ape man who just knocked down a massive dead tree? Unlikely.  Edit: Also, notice his dog is right there next to whoever knocked the tree down. Just wagging his tail. This is the dudes buddy knocking down a tree. I do it all the time myself. See a big tall dead tree.... Gotta tackle that motherfucker and feel all powerful."
bigfoot,33hx3y,Local_Crew,6,Wed Apr 22 18:00:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly, that for me is a huge red flag. In almost all BF encounters I've read or heard of that involve dogs they all are scared shitless, even massive hunting dogs that are used to the forest. Seriously, every story I've heard that involves dogs mention that they are petrified scared, usually hiding under the owner or hinting as far away as possible. That dog didn't give a single shit.   Not to drag the guys name through the mud but if he is in the music business he could be doing this just to get his name out there (not saying he is doing it but it is a possibility.) no matter what happened here in the video there is not enough shown to either make or break a case so it really doesn't matter, it's all conjecture at this point."
bigfoot,33hx3y,bzsteele,3,Wed Apr 22 23:32:45 2015 UTC,"This video is a whole lot of nothing. Trees do fall. If you walk in the forest you see fallen trees all around. Obviously you will not see a lot of them fall, but I have heard several fall near me and turned around or poked my head out of the sleeping bag just a little too late to have a chance of getting them on camera. The fact that one guy was able to sort-of videotape a tree falling is not ""proof"" of Sasquatch.  Also, that exposed stretch of brightly-colored healthy-looking wood does not prove that that there was no rot in the tree. Often the rotted area weakens the tree until the healthy part is not enough to hold it up, and it gives way and splinters.  Those two shadows that ""photobombed"" the woman are clearly not Sasquatch. If I went out and took twenty photos in the woods, I could easily find several semi-oblong shadows. It's different when you get a blurry outline and the eyewitness says, ""I saw Sasquatch! This is is what it did and this is how it acted. I tried to get my camera out in time, but all I got was this blurry photo. But that IS Sasquatch! I know, because I saw it!"""
bigfoot,33hx3y,doctorphyco,2,Thu Apr 23 16:25:35 2015 UTC,"Here is the original poster's video. The dog is NOT scared, so that was NOT Sasquatch. Notice the slowed-down segments with the altered scary-sounding growls. Not Sasquatch."
bigfoot,33hx3y,doctorphyco,3,Thu Apr 23 16:39:46 2015 UTC,"who, exactly, is thinkerthunker?  Because his rationalizations are pretty silly.    Its a 50' tree.  he is showing the bottom 20' and it doesn't show a rope.  Obviously, there is no rope.  Cutting that tree in the front right of it, below where you see the break, would create a split exactly like that exactly there.  Is there a picture of the stump?  Is he, or our rapper friend, suggesting that a bigfoot carved the Indian with the viking helmet?  Rapper X should be fined for doing something like this while his dog was loose.  the dog could've been hurt because it was nearly in the path or the tree his buddy pushed over."
bigfoot,33hx3y,darkehawk14,2,Fri Apr 24 02:06:46 2015 UTC,"I'm just  wondering... where the hell is the wood ape that did this??? There are no sounds of it running away, no brush cracking or snapping. Surely a creature as massive as its supposed to be makes some sort of noise upon a swift retreat?  There are dozens and dozens of anecdotes relaying sasquatch running through the woods/up hills/down valleys and it sounding like an elephant in the brush, ya know?  Though with that aspect of the creature in mind, they are reportedly super stealthy.. idk, honestly.  Maybe the creature moved quietly and swiftly during the moment the tree fell. The NAWAC has a report of a wood ape moving only when the wind blew soo.... yeah."

bigfoot,33hx3y,barryspencer,2,Sat Apr 25 19:28:51 2015 UTC,"The more such evidence accumulates without a Bigfoot specimen being collected, the more likely none of it is evidence of Bigfoot."
bigfoot,33hx3y,Treedom_Lighter,4,Wed Apr 22 19:00:38 2015 UTC,"The more you write this exact comment on every single post in this subreddit, the less likely it is that anyone will care."
