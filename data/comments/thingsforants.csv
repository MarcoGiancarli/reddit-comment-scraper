thingsforants,3cki56,moksinatsi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:55:01 2015 UTC,Most (?) metal pans you get in the store these days are made out of aluminum.  Not saying it's safe though.
thingsforants,3cki56,Farty_McFartFart,9,Thu Jul 9 01:43:39 2015 UTC,Aluminum cans have a thin coating of (plastic? epoxy? not sure but something) on the inside to keep the aluminum from reacting with the beverage. So burning charcoal inside the can would release harmful fumes making this unsafe.   Neat idea if you were to use a stainless steel tube or some stainless sheet metal instead of an aluminum can. But then I guess you wouldn't get to enjoy a delicious Mike's Hard LemonadeTM .

thingsforants,3b84p1,amodernbird,2,Sat Jun 27 01:41:15 2015 UTC,I remember I had this stuffed bear when I was a kid. He was holding a tiny tub of Vaseline and I always wished it was real. I saw this lip balm in the store and immediately bought it because it fulfilled a childhood dream of mine! Also this is the best lip balm ever and makes your lips so goddamn soft. I could go on forever about how much I love this lip balm.

thingsforants,35unlk,secret_tsukasa,2,Wed May 13 20:40:38 2015 UTC,"The cause of this is the design of most pizza boxes/delivery methods.  Chains now often use ""racked"" delivery bags which are insulted with metal/plastic racks inside of them to keep the pizzas from crushing one another.  Another cause of this is the design of boxes themselves.  Their design is oftentimes more compact and rigid, making it much harder for another pizza (or two) atop each other to be enough weight to crush the bottom-most pizza.  Pizza Hut's boxes (at least in my area) are this way; their corners are much more rigid and the box itself much less flexible.    Some extra cost in cardboard/design with uniformity across the chain(s) reduces the necessity for tens of thousands of those little plastic ""tables"" to be even necessary."

Batman, for instance, has been around since the 40s, but has appeared in many different comic series. Each new series begins with #1.  edit: To answer your other question: I'm not very up to date with Marvel comics, but it would not be a stretch of the imagination to assume that the comic has been launched in an effort to get more people reading about Ant-man. The comics themselves are more than likely set in their own universe and will not directly follow the storyline of the upcoming movie."

I can read what's on the left, though!  On the left it says ""driving safety"" (交通安全), so I think it's some kind of good luck charm to put in your car. I've seen lots of these before but never a comb, though it's definitely possible as they come in all kinds of shapes. Where did you find this one?  お守り (omamori) are small good luck charms, usually on a cell phone strap kind of string. They're really popular as souvenirs--if you visit a temple or a famous landmark, you can find lots of them in many varieties. It's a tradition to give them to family and friends, which is why I got quite a few as an exchange student. The purchase of omamori is also a way to donate to the upkeep of temples.  Edit: Also, OP, you have it facing sideways! :P The writing on the package goes top to bottom, right to left, so the comb should be at the bottom of the picture if you're holding it right side up."

thingsforants,2zdcen,phineas1134,2,Tue Mar 17 19:28:49 2015 UTC,Well they said all the guns were half scale so I assume that they used ammo that would be half scale as well. They probably had to make there own custom brass shells for some of those. And then all the load data for the ammo would just be half as well. So instead of using a 60 grain bullet they would use a 30 grain bullet. Not that any of those bullets would be that heavy.

They devour the settlement like a plague and haul it off to their lair where it nourishes the mysterious, ravenous overlords known as partners.

You get similar bullshit on 4chan (which I do frequent) but to be honest I'd rather wade through a bunch of stupid shit than miss out on valid points of discussion just because they're unpopular opinions (which is what occurs on Reddit all the time).

thingsforants,2wzltl,Animal-Kingdom,6,Tue Feb 24 14:28:46 2015 UTC,"Diadophis punctatus:       Diadophis punctatus, commonly known as the ring-necked snake or ringneck snake, is a harmless species of colubrid snake found throughout much of the United States, central Mexico, and southeastern Canada. Ring-necked snakes are secretive, nocturnal snakes, so are rarely seen during the day time. They are slightly venomous, but their nonaggressive nature and small, rear-facing fangs pose little threat to humans who wish to handle them. They are best known for their unique defense posture of curling up their tails, exposing their bright red-orange posterior, ventral surface when threatened. Ring-necked snakes are believed to be fairly abundant throughout most of their range, though no scientific evaluation supports this theory. Scientific research is lacking for the ring-necked snake, and more in-depth investigations are greatly needed.  It is the only species within the genus Diadophis, and currently 14 subspecies are identified, but many herpetologists question the morphologically based classifications.

It's meant to be displayed in a miniature room setting as if someone was working on it and was almost finished. The tiny box is included and the lid can be opened. A completely unassembled puzzle can also be ordered if you are crazy enough to want to try and put it together. I have to warn you it would be very hard to do! If you want the unassembled version mention it in the notes section in your shopping cart page at checkout. Check out the other designs too! A perfect gift for a puzzle or dollhouse miniature enthusiast."

thingsforants,2rnavc,thegrayhairedrace,1 point,Mon Jan 12 14:59:39 2015 UTC,Milli cane is a form of glass art that is super cool.   You stack different colored glass rods of varying thicknesses and you mosaic together an image and then melt it all together. Some incredible stuff is created this way.   Here is a perfect example of what I'm talking about. This set of millie slices was made by the amazing artist Jason Lee.   Hope this was interesting :)

Secondly (to andytuba), ""le livre des fourmis"" in this case is wrong: this translates by ""the book that belongs to the ants"".

thingsforants,2or18z,IAMA_Plumber-AMA,1 point,Wed Dec 10 17:38:43 2014 UTC,"Always pack it tightly. Black powder gives erratic and dangerous pressure spikes if it is loosely packed. However, I suggest putting a paperclip wire in the touch-hole while you're filling and packing it. It helps with ignition later on.  You may also need to clean your barrel, as powder residue can make it harder to properly seat your projectile. Use hot soapy water, and thoroughly dry the barrel."
thingsforants,2or18z,mrbojenglz,1 point,Wed Dec 10 17:46:15 2014 UTC,I always put the fuse in first and then pack the powder. Otherwise I can barely get the fuse in and it just rest on top of the powder. Is that wrong?
thingsforants,2or18z,IAMA_Plumber-AMA,1 point,Wed Dec 10 17:54:48 2014 UTC,"Either or, but it sounds like your powder might be bad quality. I'd try a different can first before chasing down other ignition issues."
