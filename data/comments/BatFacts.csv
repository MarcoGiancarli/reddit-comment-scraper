BatFacts,3d4p28,remotectrl,12,Mon Jul 13 14:32:13 2015 UTC,"Lifted the fact from this source.  Photo comes from the Bat Conservation International Facebook page  More about ebola.  Bats have been examined closely in the recent past, particularly with last years Ebola outbreak. There are a few big factors that make them particularly well-suited for hosting zoonotic diseases:   There are a lot of bat species, only rodents have more total species. Though bats may have a bit more zoonoses per species, rodents have more total.. Many bats are social, allowing for more rapid transmission and mutations to occur in pathogens. Habitat encroachment increases contact between bats and humans as humans continue to convert previously wild locations to other uses. There could also be a fair bit of sampling bias occurring as well. There are a lot of pathogens out there and if you closely anywhere you're likely to find one. There was an article that came out during the Ebola panic about some tree that may have had bats in it that was the possible ""patient zero"" location, though the bats were unlike the fruit bats previously shown to have antibodies to Ebola. There was a great comment on it that was calling them out for looking at insectivorous bats with no real evidence compared to dogs which have tested positive in places with high Ebola rates.    It should be noted that as far as I'm aware, direct transmission of the Ebola virus from any bat to human has not been confirmed. In some cases, a bat virus (eg Hendra) needs to be amplified in a nonhuman host like a horse before it can be passed to humans.   Did I miss anything, /u/AGreatWind or /u/you_freak_bitch?"
BatFacts,3d4p28,AGreatWind,3,Mon Jul 13 14:33:56 2015 UTC,"Transmission of virus from bats: Marburg virus, a close relative to ebola has been transmitted from bats through urine/feces -they poop on something that a human touches (or on a human) and boom, infection. Nipah virus, another virus that uses fruit bats as a reservoir, transmits in a similar way -the bats pee on fruits/trees which are in turn eaten by humans. Nipah is an emerging virus in SE Asia, Bangladesh, that area. It causes a nasty and fatal brain swelling (encephalitis).   So hunting/eating is not the only way that these viruses can be transmitted to humans. SARS on the other hand has been directly attributed to the taste for exotic meat. SARS coronavirus has been isolated from horseshoe bats (genus rhinolophus). The bats spread the virus to other animals like civets in live food markets in China and Hong Kong. SARS infected over 8000 people and spread 17 countries worldwide. Bad bug.    Genomic surveillance in the current ebola outbreak showed that nearly all the transmission was between humans, so there was likely only one (or very few) initial spillovers from the (bat?) reservoir population. This data really put the 'bushmeat' hypothesis out of the picture since if hunting were the prime mover in bat-to-human transmission there would have been multiple introductions into the population -which was not the case. This was one of the great papers to come out of this outbreak and has set a high standard for how future outbreaks will be studied. Holler if you need a walkthrough.  I am not too crazy about the ebola/dog paper you cited. It is a big leap to go from ""we found antibodies"" to ""dogs are asymptomatic carriers"". In the same way that we're jumping to the conclusions about bats.  There has been surprisingly little research into the dog/pets area. It wouldn't take much to clarify ebola's effects on dogs (just some heartbreaking research). Now that the outbreak is (hopefully) under control more researchers are going to begin screening wildlife to find the ebola reservoir. That work had understandably been put on hold with the massive outbreak; all hands were needed elsewhere."
BatFacts,3d4p28,sgorto,2,Mon Jul 13 17:24:57 2015 UTC,Would washing/cleaning the fruit prior to consumption have any affect on the viruses that are spread through bat poop/pee?
BatFacts,3d4p28,AGreatWind,2,Tue Jul 14 03:59:44 2015 UTC,"In the case of Nipah, the virus can be on the fruits (such as dates) but is also present in the sap. Date palms in India and Bangaldesh are often harvested for sap, kind of like maple syrup. The bats like the sap too, and often pee in the catch basins while snatching sips.    Nipah is a nasty emerging virus. It doesn't get much media attention, but I think it may very well be a potential big threat. There are annual outbreaks in Bangladesh. And it spreads from human to human via aerosol. It has a case-fatality rate of nearly 90%, which means that for people who get sick and go to the doctor/hospital for treatment 90% die. As I said, nasty bug."
BatFacts,3d4p28,AGreatWind,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:21:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you for weighing in. That's a lot of great info. There's some other disease on some pacific islands that is transmitted by some bat soup, as I recall. I'll have to try and dig that up to share with you. I read about it in a Cracked listicle on unique local foods (you won't believe number three!) and those are often pretty well sourced. Compared to birds, bats don't seem very meaty to me.   Yeah, I'm not crazy about the dog thing either. It was just the example Merlin Tuttle used to illustrate that bats are getting a lot of attention that may not be warranted at the cost of overlooking other avenues. The last thing he wanted was more prejudice against bats, especially beneficial insectivorous ones."
BatFacts,3d4p28,you_freak_bitch,2,Mon Jul 13 17:35:11 2015 UTC,"I know. Bats are getting a bad rep these days, particularly the megabats. There are a ton of viruses out there. Most of them do nothing untoward in humans, but there are many that are nasty. It's just that some of the new ones are being found in bats. And as such bats are looked at overtime a new virus pops up. It skews the perception. There are still all sorts of nasty simian viruses (dengue, HIV) and rodent viruses (hanta, lassa fever) around. Bats are certainly not the only virus reservoirs out there."
BatFacts,3d4p28,LadyNomNom,2,Mon Jul 13 18:00:54 2015 UTC,"This is so true. Every time I present my work on bats I get mixed reactions. Some people think bats are freaky and gross and I have heard many suggest culling bats are the way to go in terms of reducing viral spillovers. Not only is it ecologically unsound but practically unfeasible. There can be thousands of bats in one roost, not to mention they are nocturnal and capable of flight. And one must remember too it is us humans that are encroaching on their habitats. Definitely getting a bad rep."

BatFacts,3d4p28,AGreatWind,2,Mon Jul 13 17:00:43 2015 UTC,"Sorry again for the late reply. /u/AGreatWind has pretty much covered it but I'd just like to add that Nipah (NiV) (a close relative of Hendra) was initially found in Malaysia where it was observed to transmit from bats to an intermediate pig host and then to humans. Human to human transmission was also recorded but no bat to human transmission (as far as I can remember!). But when in Bangladeshi communities it has been observed to transmit from bats to human directly and when the genome of NiV-M (Malaysia) and NiV-B (Bangladesh) were compared, they were found to be slightly different which is really interesting.  Like /u/AGreatWind said, it is believed that NiV is transmitted to humans via date sap. In Malaysia often the collection buckets for the sap are uncovered and bats can come and lick them (NiV believed to be present in their saliva). Date sap is usually cooked which kills the virus but some SE Asians prefer the taste of the raw date sap and so now health authority are tightening the regulations surrounding collection and cooking of date sap.  The other thing I wanted to add is that there have been some speculation as to whether Ebola virus can also be transmitted by semen and passed on through intercourse. I read something on ProMed which I can't find now that seemed to suggest an African woman contracted Ebola virus from sexual intercourse with a recovered Ebola patient. But don't believe me until I find the source!"
BatFacts,3d4p28,nimbus57,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:06:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ebola is present in sperm up to 7 weeks after recovery. All it needs is to come in contact with a mucosal surface to transmit. This correspondence in the Lancet goes into it a bit, and also touches on the need to inform survivors not to have sex for at least 3 months. I also read about those new cases likely stemming from sexual transmission too, but I've only seen reports rather than any research studies.   Thanks for clarifying on the Malaysian nipah transmission! I forgot about the pig farms playing an amplifying role there. Do you have the link to the genomic study on NiV-M and NiV-B? I would love to read that!"

Before those advancements, studying bats was limited to trying to catch them with mist nets (which is actually a lot of fun) or trying to find their roosts.

BatFacts,3bb9kd,RobotPigOverlord,2,Sun Jun 28 00:05:48 2015 UTC,"Blood is responsible for the transport of nutrients and oxygen throughout the body. The bats are able to get all the nutrients they need because they are all present in the blood, though in low amounts. In a way it's not that different from the diet of a large carnivore, but much less efficient because you have to consume a lot of blood to match the protein content of muscle. Protein can be converted to carbohydrates for energy as well."

BatFacts,39637s,MasterRaider,5,Mon Jun 22 03:57:56 2015 UTC,"The bat in this gif is a Pallid Bat  Video Source   Researchers at the University of Northern Colorado have discovered that bats flap their tail membrane like a wing to produce potentially important thrust during takeoffs.   Using a high-speed video camera, Professor Rick Adams, Ph.D., and his graduate students captured for the first time bats moving their tails above and below their bodies in a similar fashion to their hand-wings. This unique movement, previously undetected and indiscernible to the naked eye, is unlike that observed in any other flying vertebrate.   ""This changes fundamental thinking not just for bats, but for vertebrate flight in general,"" said Adams, principle Investigator of the Bat Research Lab located in UNC's School of Biological Sciences.   Adams and his team spent two summers filming more than 100 bats across five species in Boulder County to study development of flight as part of the UNC grant-funded project. Adams said it took ""almost three years to analyze all the films and digitize all the motions"" before being published Feb. 29 by the prestigious scientific journal PLoS ONE: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0032074. The article is co-authored by UNC graduate student Emily Snode and Jason Shaw, Ph.D., a graduate student at the time of the data collection and analysis.   ""We decided on a whim to film our Colorado bats launching from a horizontal platform because this had never been done,"" said Adams, author of award-winning book Bats of the Rocky Mountain West.   ""Once we filmed them head on flying into the camera, we could see that they were folding up the tail membrane on the upstroke to avoid down drafts and then opening it for the downstroke to push out air that would cause a rearward thrust — like fanning yourself with a piece of cardboard.""  The tail flapping motion, termed ""Tail-Assisted-Flight-Thrust (TAFT)"" by the researchers, is similar to the way that dolphins and manatees use their flukes to thrust through water, Adams said. The degree to which the tail flapping occurred related to body mass, agility and habitat-use patterns of each species.   More research is planned to determine the amount of thrust produced by the tail, which makes up about 20 percent of the total wing area in bats, and how many of the approximately 1,200 species of bats use this flight mode.   ""Further investigation into how and when bats use the tail-wing will allow us to better understand how and why bats are the most agile aerial vertebrates on the Earth today,"" Adams said. ""Also, for about a decade the military has been attempting to build a micro-aerial machine that flaps and moves like a bat. Our data may contribute to how these artificial machines are developed.""

Others have a short tail but no uropatagium. It's not the best way to distinguish them, since there's a whole family of free-tailed bats but its a decent enough feature to name them after.

The attached image is a key for bats of the Western United States as visualized in Sonobat in time expansion, though there are several other programs that are also used. Sonobat has been my favorite of the few I've used because it can play back the sounds at a frequency we can hear and certain bats have a different timbre to their calls that I found could help sometimes when keying them out.  I also use a Baton Bat Detector sometimes for interpretive stuff as it shifts the frequencies down to where we can hear them and with a laptop can view the calls in real time. The latest version can plug into your phone to visualize the calls."

BatFacts,37llgl,Waterrat,7,Thu May 28 21:54:37 2015 UTC,"One of the most carnivorous of bats, the ghost bat emerges from the roost after sunset and flies up to two kilometres to a preferred foraging site, where it hangs from a perch to await passing prey. The diet includes a variety of small animals, including large insects, small mammals, lizards, frogs, birds, and even other bats, and an individual may take prey up to 60 or even 80 percent of its own weight. Some fruit may also be eaten. The species’ alternative name of ‘false vampire bat’ reflects the old but erroneous belief that this species, like the true vampire bats, feeds on blood. However, the ghost bat is still a fearsome predator, able to locate prey by both sight and sound, and ambushing it in the air or by dropping on it from above, usually killing it with a bite to the head or neck. The prey is then taken to a feeding perch or back to the roost to be consumed.  The ghost bat typically roosts alone or in small groups, with larger ‘maternity’ colonies forming during the breeding season. Each population appears to have a regionally centralised maternity site, with only around ten such sites known to exist. Mating occurs in April and May, and the female ghost bat gives birth to a single young from around July to November. The young bat is carried by the female for the first four weeks, after which it is left at the roost and fed on prey brought back by the female. Weaning occurs by about three months, and both sexes reach maturity in the second year. Lifespan in this species has been recorded at over 16 years in captivity.

BatFacts,370kmu,CitizenPremier,9,Thu May 28 00:37:39 2015 UTC,Here's a great Scientific American article about the subject.
BatFacts,370kmu,CitizenPremier,3,Sat May 23 19:12:31 2015 UTC,That is pretty interesting.  I wonder if that feature of human language actually shares a common ancestor with this.
BatFacts,370kmu,CitizenPremier,5,Sat May 23 23:58:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. It's likely a separate evolution of the same trait. We call that convergent evolution! Also, are you checking out my post history or you're a batfacts subscriber? :) secret handshake"

And even if they do they might have evolved it too, those damn red queens."

BatFacts,370kmu,dsprox,-9,Sun May 24 01:31:02 2015 UTC,"It's likely a separate evolution of the same trait.   You are claiming that bats ""evolved"" their manner of speech, at the same time that a different species of animal ""evolved"" their speech in the same manner at the same time, which you call ""convergent evolution"".  Explain to me, how did bats communicate before they ""evolved"" this manner of speech that they have?"
BatFacts,370kmu,ArcTimes,7,Wed May 27 04:29:00 2015 UTC,"""Explain to me, how did bats communicate before they ""evolved"" this manner of speech that they have?""  Poorly. Probably the same way humans communicated before they could vocalize languages with set rules."
BatFacts,370kmu,dsprox,-6,Wed May 27 09:02:01 2015 UTC,"Poorly. Probably the same way humans communicated before they could vocalize languages with set rules.   Poorly? What EVIDENCE do you have to support that claim?   Probably   Oh, you have no claim or evidence, and are speaking purely on speculation.  Right. Your ""evolution"" theory sure is convincing, can't even tell me how bats supposedly communicated before as you claim they supposedly ""evolved"" their speech.  Tell me mister blind faith in Evolution because you can't explain how it works so it must be blind faith, what did bats supposedly ""evolve"" from, how did it occur, how long did it take, and what actual EVIDENCE can you provide to support any of the answers you may have ( doubt it ) to those questions?"
BatFacts,370kmu,ArcTimes,7,Wed May 27 13:42:12 2015 UTC,"""Poorly? What EVIDENCE do you have to support that claim?""  Why would any animal be able to communicate at 100% efficiency early in its evolution phase? Unless you're suggesting bats were  brought into existence as bats with all the skills they have today, the ancestor bats logically would still be growing many of the features they have now. Communication, flight, and echolocation would all be missing from an ancestor early enough following the chain down.  ""Right. Your ""evolution"" theory sure is convincing, can't even tell me how bats supposedly communicated before as you claim they supposedly ""evolved"" their speech.""  Gestures, or just sticking near other bats (via smell or visual), would make it possible for bats to survive if they didn't have sensible audio communication yet. Even if they just made random noises at each other all day, eventually their brains would either grow large enough or sophisticated enough to use audio to communicate, in addition to the communication they already have.  ""Tell me mister blind faith in Evolution because you can't explain how it works so it must be blind faith, what did bats supposedly ""evolve"" from, how did it occur, how long did it take, and what actual EVIDENCE can you provide to support any of the answers you may have ( doubt it ) to those questions?""  It depends what state of the chain you are asking for. Any living animal today would be traceable back to single celled organisms. It occurred by genetic mutations. The time it took depends on how single celled organisms first made an appearance to Earth. If they formed naturally with this planet's conditions, that means it took potentially the age of the Earth. If the cells or proteins came from a meteor that impacted Earth, then it took however long for that planet to form the life, plus the time it took to travel here. The stage of bat you are looking for will be available when genetic sequencing is fast enough. By taking simple early stage DNA, changes can be made to the genes again and again (deliberately or randomly) and eventually a modern bat will form. On the way up, all the potential missing links will be in between. We won't be able to be sure exactly which missing link was a reality and which are simply man made unless we can simulate an entire universe start to finish.  The above evidence makes for a convincing argument. We can analyze the differences between any two animals genes already. Splitting the difference between similar species takes time, but can be done to show the exact differences. We would just take that technology and make it fast enough to split the difference between a simple bacteria and a bat. Whether you accept that as evidence is up to you, but if a replicated experiment isn't enough to convince you at that point, I don't see what would be able to convince you in either direction of belief."

By my count, that's like eleven points of articulation (in each hand), in addition to adjusting the tension of the wing membrane itself (it has tiny muscles).  Image credit goes here.  Here's the fact source for the title. And here's a paper which came to different conclusions by a couple leaf-nosed bat species with some passerine birds, which I don't feel is a great comparison due to differences in life history which have certain morphological characteristics, but they have their reasons for their choices. If it were up to me, I would have made comparisons between bats and birds which occupy similar ecological niches such as flycatchers and vesper bats which both catch insects in the air.

BatFacts,35fmvl,Swysbad,2,Sat May 30 00:32:54 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I read about it in detail, but I'll give it a shot.   Many bats can go into torpor to conserve energy. This involves reducing their body temperature and metabolism, typically during the day when they're less active. During this period of reduced metabolism each unit of food is worth more time and this is what the food donated would go to fuel the bats for. The donor bats are sacrificing hours which would be spent foraging rather than torpor time and they could presumably find food before that foraging budget is completely spent. So the time difference arises from different energy consumption rates between being active and not with the donated energy coming from the surplus active pile.  I hope that makes sense."

There is no actual defence for committing this crime. You might not be prosecuted if it was absolutely impossible to know that this would happen but seeing as they then removed tile 2 and carried on - stonewall conviction.  Bats are protected under the 1994 Habitat Regulations and are classified as European protected species.  UK bats are currently thought to be entirely rabies free and there's no danger from them.  Edit to add - There are legal and easily obtainable means to licence the removal of bats from a property. There is never a need to break the law to remove bats and any one who does so is misinformed of the ease of getting a licence."
BatFacts,34o35n,Kijamon,2,Sun May 3 10:22:36 2015 UTC,"It's illegal to 'capture, kill, disturb or injure bats (on purpose or by not taking enough care)' in the UK. So would this count as one of those offences?"
BatFacts,34o35n,Iamsnufkin,2,Sun May 3 16:49:13 2015 UTC,"Nearly spot on but I need to elaborate more to answer. It's illegal to 'deliberately or recklessly capture, kill, disturb or injure' a European protected species. Note deliberate or reckless. So if you genuinely had no idea that bats were present, were not asked to do any surveys or the like (as in you didn't need planning consent to do what you are doing) you would not be likely to be prosecuted - I don't work for the police though so don't take that as gospel as it is up to a Wildlife Crime Officer to decide if a case should be brought.   This is also assuming that the second you realise bats are present that you stop works and seek advice/help from someone qualified. You can't then carry on doing the works and say ""Oh I didn't know they were there"" as bats are streaming out of the building around your head.   In this gif I would say that the guy with the hammer is recklessly and deliberately injuring and possibly killing bats. If this was in the UK I would expect a criminal case to be brought.  However, my original post is for another offence. It's also illegal to destroy a shelter of a European protected species. There is no 'deliberate or reckless' in this offence. If you do it, accidentally, deliberately, however - it is an offence.   Again using that gif as an example, if that was in the UK the hammer wielding chap could not use ignorance as an excuse, even if he wanted to."

However, I would still not recommend it as their bite is kinda venomous and bats make bad pets. I knew a professor who got bit trying to remove one from a mist net and even applying pressure, his thumb bled for two hours. Interestingly, some bats can contract Toxo.  The image comes from the Social Bat blog which is a fantastic resource for current research on bats, social behavior, and other biological musings. I recommend it. The latest post is about using DNA in feces to determine what animal vampire bats drank from. This is also possible to do with microbats; they leave a lot of bits in their feces.  Here's a link to the live vampire bat cam where you can help record behavioral data if so inclined. The cam is actually of the colony at the Organization for Bat Conservation.

Bats can eat half their body weight a day!  Bats need a lot of room. Many fly tens of kilometers each night searching for food. Any captive environment needs a lot of room to allow bats to fly.  Bats are social, so you would have to house multiple bats.  Bats can carry disease and unlike pet dogs there are not approved vaccines for them. This is actually an issue for pet skunks as well!  Beyond the ethical issues, there legal restrictions as well. Many exotic creatures are protected under the CITES treaty.  Bats made this websites list of worst pets.

Both were rescued off separate barbed wire fences and I reckon they are one of the most stunning bat species in Australia. They live a mainly solitary life in the wild and they feed on fleshy native fruits with native figs being a particular favourite. Unfortunately, they sometimes predate on cultivated crops and this can bring them into conflict with humans. Like their larger cousins the Black, Grey-headed and Spectacled flying-foxes, Tube-nosed bats give birth to a single young between October and December. Rarely seen and even more rarely bought into care, Tubies rely on their beautiful spots and splashes of colour to remain inconspicuous whilst roosting amongst vegetation."

The vitamin D in sunlight helps prevent Rickets in rapidly growing bones and sunlight also ensures that fungal issues don't develop on vulnerable wings.  It is lovely to sit at a colony and watch tiny babies hanging on to their mother's fur, flapping their little heads off. However, as our young orphans in care spend much of their time wrapped and in bed, we have to be conscious of waste products being in contact with delicate wings and causing fungal infections. Although we give our orphans a daily bath and spot clean where required, it just isn't enough.  So, every morning we trot our orphans outside for a flap and a measured dose of sunlight to ensure they grow up healthy and strong.   The thing in its mouth is a pacifier.

From the abstract:   Female bats often lick their mate's penis during dorsoventral copulation. The female lowers her head to lick the shaft or the base of the male's penis but does not lick the glans penis which has already penetrated the vagina. Males never withdrew their penis when it was licked by the mating partner. A positive relationship exists between the length of time that the female licked the male's penis during copulation and the duration of copulation. Furthermore, mating pairs spent significantly more time in copulation if the female licked her mate's penis than if fellatio was absent. Males also show postcopulatory genital grooming after intromission.

BatFacts,30fzik,remotectrl,5,Fri Mar 27 01:28:32 2015 UTC,"The source paper for this fact has a great title and is about sperm competition.  From the Results:   Male body mass varied from 3.8g for Rhynchonycteris naso to 1,021g for Pteropus giganteus. Expressed as a percentage of body mass, combined testes mass ranged from 0.12% for Lavia frons to 8.4% for Corynorhinus rafinesquii (see also fig. 3.1).   From the Discussion:   Thus, bats show variation in relative testes size that exceeds any other mammalian order. Allocation of body mass to testicular tissue in Corynorhinus rafinesquii not only equals or exceeds any other mammal but also exceeds any bird. The largest yet reported for birds occur in the alpine accentor with a combined testes mass 7.7% of body mass (Nakamura 1990).   Here's a paper on brain size and testes size. Spoiler: they are correlated! Here's a table from that paper that shows the mating systems they use along with the measured sizes of their brains and/or testicles.  Photo Source  More information on this cool bat! They also curl up their ears when not in use! You can see them doing it a bit here.  One more picture.  If a 150lb man had this same testes to weight ratio, then his testicles would weigh twelve and a half pounds. The testes on this guy (Rousettus aegyptiacus) account for about 2% of his total body mass, so that should give you a rough idea of how much these guys are packing."

These bats have been known to live over twenty years so we are really only a few generations out, but currently things seem to be doing well so far!  The biggest issue is that they've lost a lot of their native habitat. Invasive species are always an issue on islands. Considering this is the same island chain that the Dodo was from (which went extinct within two decades of its discovery), lasting so long without intervention while so many other endemic species went extinct makes the story of this bat even more amazing. Rather than introduced predators, the big cause of mortality for them are the seasonal cyclones that can blow the bats out to sea if they don't have shelter! That shelter used to be forests, but a lot of that has been lost. A particularly bad storm season was what dropped the population in 1979 to such a low level. Stochastic effects can be tricky for isolated species. In the case of these bats, they are really isolated. They are in the Indian Ocean and the nearest landmass of considerable size is Madagascar. These bats used to be on Mauritius (you know, with the dodo?), but they have been extirpated. There's a pretty good population in a number of zoos now, so if another catastrophe occurs, there's a possible source of reintroduction.   Here's their IUCN page. Here's their Arkive page (pictures!)

Some researchers in Oregon have used this to monitor bat populations indirectly.  Although similar in size to mouse droppings, the feces of bats does sparkle when you hit it with light. Bat droppings also crumble when pressure is applied and mouse droppings do not. Many bats also leave piles of discarded wings if they stop to eat at night roosts. That project wasn't looking at dissecting stools to see what the bats were eating, but some research has gone into it.  The feces of frugivorous bats is a bit different in composition, but farmers in Cambodia harvest it for use as fertilizer.  For more guano facts, check out the comments section of these posts:   Not all guano is created equally: the feces of insectivorous bats is nitrogen-rich whereas frugivorous bat feces is more phosphorus-rich. Many fruit bats also distribute seeds, some for hundreds of kilometers, and may play an important role in recolonizing disturbed (eg logged) areas. In the world of poop, bat feces are known for being exceptional excrement and the potent poop was even used to manufacture gunpowder!

Behavior of article  Mexican free-tailed bat:       Mexican free-tailed bats are nocturnal foragers and begin feeding after dusk. They travel 50 km in a quick, direct flight pattern to feed. This species flies the highest among bats, at altitudes around 3300 m.  Bats appears to be most active in late morning and afternoon between June and September.  Free-tailed bats are more active in warm weather.   Mexican free-tailed bats use echolocation for navigation and detecting prey. Traveling calls are of a brief but constant frequency. However, they switch modulated frequency calls between 40 and 75 kHz if they detect something.  Typically, the frequency range of their echolocation is between 49 and 70 kHz, but can be between 25 and 40 kHz if something crosses their path while in flight.   On 6 November 2014, Aaron Corcoran, a biologist at Wake Forest University, North Carolina, reported online in Science that he and his team had detected Mexican free-tailed bats emitting ultrasonic vocalizations which had the effect of jamming the echolocation calls of a rival bat species hunting moths. The ‘jamming’ call led to an increased chance of the rival missing its prey, which the Mexican free-tailed bat was then able to eat itself. Earlier researchers had discovered some 15 types of social calls made by Mexican free-tailed bats and reported that they could adjust their calls to avoid interfering with others in range of their calls.

When foraging, spotted bats fly alone from 2 to 50 m above ground, often within 10 m. They echolocate at a pitch (12 to 6 kHz) audible to humans but often not audible to prey until bats are too close (1 m) for prey to evade them. Spotted bats forage primarily on moths, but do not appear to select particular moth species. They likely feed on any moth they encounter that is appropriate handling size (8-12 mm in length), particularly Noctuids. In Arizona, they also fed on Lasiocampid and Geometrid moths. They avoided some moths such as those in the family Arctiidae (wooly bears), probably because the dense hairs of these moths make them distasteful..   Here's a paper on them. Here's the wikipedia page. Here's the Forest Service's write-up.  More pictures (with an undergrad for scale)!  Some moths have evolved ears which let them detect the echolocation calls of bats. Some moths take evasive manuevers, others try to jam the sonar, and the male of one moth species even mimics the sounds to coerce female moths into remaining still so it can mate with her! The echolocation of the spotted bat is at a different frequency to get past these defenses; however there may be a trade off in the ""resolution"" of the reflected sound waves, making the spotted bat a specialist in hunting moths.

We know that many bats sing to attract a mate. Others probably use scent cues as well. There's a lot about bat courtship that we don't know!
BatFacts,2vwahh,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Feb 14 19:08:15 2015 UTC,"Pair bond:       In biology, a pair bond is the strong affinity that develops in some species between a pair consisting of a male and female, or in some cases as a same-sex pairing, potentially leading to producing offspring and/or a lifelong bond. Pair-bonding is a term coined in the 1940s  that is frequently used in sociobiology and evolutionary psychology circles. The term often implies either a lifelong socially monogamous relationship or a stage of mating interaction in socially monogamous species. It is sometimes used in reference to human relationships.

Such lore also explains the disappearance of bats during the day, since when humans awake, their souls return home to their bodies. In his 1939 book Bats, G.M. Allen reports testimony on the validity of this belief from an aged Finn who related an example where, upon awakening, a man could remember the places he had visited as a bat the night before.  When seen as human souls, bats are often imagined as souls of the dead, particularly souls of the damned, or those that are not yet at peace. Both African-Americans and those of European descent from around the United States frequently maintain that bats are ""ghosts"" or ""haunts."" Sicilian peasants relate that the souls of persons who meet a violent death must spend a period of time, determined by God, as either a bat, lizard, or other reptile.   Source"

The species name fistulata is derived from the Latin word fistula, meaning ""tube"". It refers to the bat's lower lip, which extends 3.3–4.8 mm beyond the upper lip and is rolled into a funnel shape. The exact function of the tube-lip is unknown. The bat has the longest tongue (8.5 cm) relative to its body size of any mammal. Its tongue is 150% the size of its overall body length.  By convergent evolution, pangolins, the giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), and the tube-lipped nectar bat all have a tongue that is detached from their hyoid bones and extend past the pharynx deep into the thorax.  This extension lies between the sternum and the trachea.  Despite its exceptionally long tongue, the tube-lipped nectar bat has a varied diet that includes nectar, pollen, and insects. This arrangement is possible due to its short jaw. The base of the tongue is in the bat's rib cage.  One plant, Centropogon nigricans, with its 8– to 9-cm-long corollae, is pollinated exclusively by this bat.

BatFacts,2rvttx,Rincs,4,Sat Jan 10 09:11:56 2015 UTC,"Oh, no problem at all! It's a taxonomic thing rather than a size thing. At one point there was only one bat species which could probably already fly and this species was the ancestor of all other bats. It split into two separate types (maybe one got big and one stayed small) which would becomes the ancestors of all megabats and microbats respectively. All microbats are thought to be more closely related to each other than to megabats and megabats likewise share a more recent common ancestor with each other than they do with microbats. So the terms megabat and microbat refer back to which branch of the family tree they fall into. The wikipedia page for bats mentions some of the differences as well.    The two traditionally recognized suborders of bats are:   Megachiroptera (megabats) Microchiroptera (microbats/echolocating bats)   Not all megabats are larger than microbats. The major distinctions between the two suborders are:   Microbats use echolocation; with the exception of the Rousettus genus, megabats do not. Microbats lack the claw at the second finger of the forelimb. The ears of microbats do not close to form a ring; the edges are separated from each other at the base of the ear. Microbats lack underfur; they are either naked or have guard hairs.   Megabats eat fruit, nectar, or pollen. Most microbats eat insects; others may feed on fruit, nectar, pollen, fish, frogs, small mammals, or the blood of animals. Megabats have well-developed visual cortices and show good visual acuity, while microbats rely on echolocation for navigation and finding prey.   There's some newer genetic evidence that suggests it may be more complicated than that, but the terms are still useful to denote a few trends in life history."

Here's the source for their singing! You can listen to it!  Here's a paper on their evolutionary origins   Contrary to existing hypotheses, our data suggest that bats are not overwhelmingly absent from the ground because of competition from, or predation by, other mammals. Rather, selective advantage appears to be the primary evolutionary driving force behind habitual terrestriality in the rare bats that walk. Unlike for birds, there is currently no evidence that any bat has evolved a reduced capacity for flight as a result of isolation on islands.   Unlike almost all bats, Mystacina tuberculata forages for food on the ground! Video of them foraging here.   They've been featured on Life of Mammals, which everyone ought to watch. It's on Netflix and Hulu.  Here's a picture of their short tail! Interestingly, unlike the common vampire bat which also forages on the ground (when approaching prey like seals), the short-tailed bat cannot run!  Sadly, there used to be a second species of short-tailed bat, the Greater Short-tailed bat, but it is believed to have gone extinct since it hasn't been sighted since 1967.  These guys also pollinate a strange parasitic plant!  Their page in Mammalian Species."

BatFacts,2rbbyx,remotectrl,3,Sun Jan 4 17:42:43 2015 UTC,I found this pretty cool picture that shows their cool thumbs that they use to stick to leaves.
BatFacts,2r829g,remotectrl,7,Sat Jan 3 18:51:31 2015 UTC,"Bats generally buck the trend found in most mammals where body size correlates with life span. Most generally only have one pup at a time.   The Red Bat, and others in its genus, are exceptions in this. They generally have twins, but as many as four or five have been reported (pictures of babies crawling all over their mother).    During winter, hibernating red bats have been documented in a variety of locations, ranging from tree hollows and exposed tree trunks to areas on the ground covered in leaf litter. During summer, they roost in foliage. Hanging by one foot, wrapped in their furry tail membranes, they are well concealed and resemble dead leaves. They roost in the same location for several weeks at a time.   source  Another picture from Project Noah  Red bats are crazy cute."

BatFacts,2r3qqd,remotectrl,3,Fri Jan 2 14:52:45 2015 UTC,"Source comes from the Vampire Bat fact page and video stream from OBC. You can also learn more and contribute to a behavioral study if you check out this researcher's blog  Here's a bit more about brain-to-body mass ratios. Here's a paper brain size between different types of bats and here's one that looks at brain size and basal metabolism. Crunching the numbers from that one the vampire bat has a brain which accounts for about 3% of its body mass, but this little guy has one that's over 4%. I honestly haven't read the whole paper yet (I'm still on holiday) and was looking for some figures on what the brain-body ratio was at for these guys. In the process I found a few other items that I thought looked interesting and wanted to share/save for later:   Here's a patent that was filed for using their saliva as a stroke medication. A thesis on vision in echolocating bats Lecure notes on thermoreception.  Another paper about their sensory abilities. And here's an exam key!"
BatFacts,2r3qqd,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Jan 2 15:07:22 2015 UTC,"Brain-to-body mass ratio:       Brain-to-body mass ratio, also known as the brain to body weight ratio, is the ratio of brain mass to body mass, which is hypothesised to be a rough estimate of the intelligence of an animal, although fairly inaccurate in many cases. A more complex measurement, encephalization quotient, takes into account allometric effects of widely divergent body sizes across several taxa.  The raw brain-to-body mass ratio is however simpler to come by, and is still a useful tool for comparing encephalization within species or between fairly closely related species.
