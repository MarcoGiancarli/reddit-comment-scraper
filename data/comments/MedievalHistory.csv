MedievalHistory,3dccza,miraoister,5,Wed Jul 15 04:08:35 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert, but I believe the following were factors:   Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe at the time (although that was soon not to be true anymore); The Komnenian ""Restoration"" was in the works, whereby the Romans, who had just been dealt a huge blow by the loss of most of Anatolia to the Seljuk Turks, were seeking to reconquer what had been theirs; Roman military strategy at the time relied on substantial numbers of experienced soldiers and mercenaries, and if the English could provide those services, they would have been welcomed the same as the Norse and other ""foreign"" culture groups; The English hated the Normans, and it just so happened that the cousins of those who had conquered England had settled in Sicily, and were in the throes of a rebellion against the Romans.  It was win-win for both the Anglo-Saxons and the Romans. The [Eastern] Roman Empire was also beset by invasions from the direction of Hungary and the northern Black Sea, and always feared further incursions by the Turks; read: they were desperate for warm, armored bodies; The English probably received the same benefit that landless second and third sons would soon receive from the Crusades - if you have no options at home, find a foreign employer, and win yourself a birthright to pass on to your heir. Since it appears William the Conqueror may have agreed to let them go to Constantinople, the benefit for the Normans was that Constantinople was literally on the other side of the (well-)known world.

MedievalHistory,3dccza,cdanl2,2,Wed Jul 15 18:07:56 2015 UTC,"If you read the Wikipedia article, it notes that there was some wandering, but the Játvarðar Saga makes it sound like they explicitly agreed to leave England for Constantinople; given the Roman Empire's reputation at the time, it would have likely been known to the Normans and Anglo-Saxons alike that their services may have been well received by the Basileus.  Also, I wouldn't put too much ""stock"" in whether they were from ""Viking stock"" like the Normans.  The Varangian Guard at the time would have been a little ""muddier"" than just pure Kievan Rus warriors.  It had expanded to include Danes, Vikings, some Slavs, Saxons (like from modern-day Germany), and the Anglo-Saxons/Danelaw English fit in with that mix.  From the Wikipedia Article:   ""Composed primarily of Scandinavians for the first 100 years, the guard began to see increased inclusion of Anglo-Saxons after the successful invasion of England by the Normans. In 1088 a large number of Anglo-Saxons and Danes emigrated to the Byzantine Empire by way of the Mediterranean.  One source has more than 5,000 of them arriving in 235 ships. Those who did not enter imperial service settled on the Black Sea coast, building and garrisoning the town of Civetot for Alexios I. Those who did became so vital to the Varangians that the Guard was commonly called the Englinbarrangoi (Anglo-Varangians) from that point.""   See more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varangian_Guard#History [The article is fairly well-cited to acceptable sources, so I believe it is trustworthy]"

Wondering about the sources for these notes led me to:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo  Which has much of the information; though I was also led to:  Zoo and Aquarium History: Ancient Animal Collections To Zoological Gardens, by Vernon N. Kisling.  Addressing English zoos, he notes:   The first permanent English zoological collection, for which there is irrefutable proof, is the collection of King Henry I (1068–1135) at Woodstock, Oxfordshire, some 60 miles west of London. In this collection, as recorded by William of Malmesbury, there were lions, lynx, leopards, camels, porcupines and a “remarkable owl,” which William of Montpellier presented to the king. Most unfortunately, from the historian’s point of view, not a word was written about the way the animals were kept."
MedievalHistory,39tiiz,socks,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:14:39 2015 UTC,It depends on one's definition. A zoo is defined as a permanent animal park where the PUBLIC has unrestricted access to. This does not seem to be case with this 'zoo' nor with most others before the 19th century.

MedievalHistory,39mlon,Chesh375,3,Fri Jun 12 20:23:52 2015 UTC,"Okay, a few things...   Some serfs were unfree   All serfs were unfree. That is what serfdom meant. Villeins were explicitly barred from civil actions vis-a-vis their lord (see Bracton, De Legibus, v. 2, f. 4b; for secondary literature on the topic, Hyams, King, Lords, and Peasants, 51 and 132 specifically).    These manors were controlled through a manorial court which was governed by local lords or the church.     This way of viewing the manorial court is not in keeping with current scholarship's understanding of its functions and make-up. Although the manorial court was an extension of lordship, it was run and staffed by the local village elite. Some scholarship on this topic include: Masschaele, Jury, State, and Society; Larson, Conflict and Compromise in the Late Medieval Countryside; Britton, Community of the Vill, etc. The list really does go on and on.   [Serfs] could not leave their manor without their lord’s permission    This is a distinction of legal theory that did not completely manifest itself in common practice. See especially Raftis, Tenure and Mobility for discussions on peasant mobility. The Chevage (yearly price paid to leave the manor) can be argued as a sign of choice by villeins - it reserved their spot within the land tenure hierarchy (which was advantageous to villeins, see Hatcher, English Serfdom and Villeinage: Towards a Reassessment).  Regarding the Statutes and Ordinances of Labour. I recommend reading Putman's work Enforcement of the Statutes of Labourers... It is a great book, but it also disrupts the facile argument that the execution of the Statutes were 100% favorable to the land owners. They were also used by prosperous peasants (many being villeins) against their poorer, wage-earning, peasant neighbors.   These groups made unsuccessful please   Pleas.  If you are interested in the relationship between taxation and discontent, I recommend checking out Maddicott, The English Peasantry and the Demands of the Crown. It is possible that taxation rates earlier in the 14th century hit peasants harder than the poll taxes of the late-1300s.  Another book that I would suggest checking out is White, Self-Government at the King's Command. It doesn't directly deal with peasants, but they do feature into its concepts."

""Actual"" medicine in the medieval was based on the galenic idea of the Four Humors, and in galenic medicine, ""amulets"" were seen as medically sound remedies. As far as prayer is concerned, it was absolutely viewed by the vast vast majority (""rich"" or ""poor"", a problematic assertion itself in a time before the rise of market economies) as efficacious medical aid. Furthermore, medieval medicine rose out of the monastic tradition, and charity was a huge component to the rise of the early modern hospital, so obviously a bunch of monks weren't thinking that they were giving patients the ""cheap stuff"" by administering prayer.   See:  http://inquiry.uark.edu/issues/v02/2001a08.pdf  And excerpts from early medical books.

MedievalHistory,37lwoy,sunmaster1,4,Thu May 28 16:06:52 2015 UTC,"He's not being presentist at all, many sources (and linguistic evidence) indicate that the Anglo-Saxons saw themselves as distinct from the native Briton population, and vice-versa. That's what this article is about, not ""British"" identity in the modern sense. (I can also attest that it's common for A-S scholarship to use ""British"" to describe the Celtic Britons, but I understand how that might be confusing.)"
MedievalHistory,37lwoy,rwoc,4,Fri May 29 05:24:54 2015 UTC,"Is there a specific usage of ""Englishness"" in that article that is bothering you? I ask because I didn't find any problematic instances of the word. It's clear that Ward-Perkins uses it to describe the sense of cultural identity the various Anglo-Saxon groups developed. It's a fair word to use, too, given that many Anglo-Saxon sources speak of themselves as ""English"" (or ""Anglisc,"" or ""Englisc,"" or ""Angelcynn,"" or ""gens Anglorum,"" etc.). Is it its appearance on the first page? Because it makes perfect sense in context:  ""For early England, interesting work has been done on the emergence of a single kingdom in the tenth century, and on the slow growth of a unified sense of 'Englishness' among the various peoples and kingdoms whom modern scholarship, for convenience, lumps together under the label 'Anglo-Saxons'.""2  And the relevant footnote:  ""2 See, for the emergence of a sense of Englishness, the work of Patrick Wormald: 'Bede, the Bretwaldas and the Origins of the Gens Anglorum, in P. Wormald (ed.), Ideal and Reality in Frankish and Anglo-Saxon Society (Oxford, 1983), pp. 99—129; and id., 'Engla Lond: The Making of an Allegiance', Journal of Historical Sociology, vii (1994), 1—24, reprinted in his Legal Culture in the Early Medieval West (London/Rio Grande, 1999), pp. 359—81. For the political and administrative realities behind that sentiment: P. Stafford, Unification and Conquest. A Political and Social History of England in the Tenth and Eleventh Centuries (London, 1989); and the highly influential work of James Campbell, as in his 'Observations on English Government from the Tenth to the Twelfth Centuries', Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, 5th series, xxv (1975), 39—54, reprinted in his Essays in Anglo-Saxon History (London/Ronceverte, 1986), pp. 155-70.""  Again, as both that excerpt and the footnote demonstrate, the article is using the word ""Englishness"" to describe the Anglo-Saxon sense of cultural and linguistic identity."
MedievalHistory,37lwoy,rwoc,2,Fri May 29 14:43:29 2015 UTC,"Are you ever going to directly respond to any of my points?  It's not good scholarship to deny the people you're studying a voice. Please, explain to me why we shouldn't refer to the collective Anglo-Saxon cultural and linguistic identity as ""English"" when that's a word they themselves used. Check the Dictionary of Old English Corpus. Check the Oxford English Dictionary. And those just cover the Old English uses, never mind the Latin! The author also provided a pre-2000 reading list on the subject in his footnote--go read those.  You are familiar with the Byzantines, yes? You know that's not what they called themselves? Would you accuse someone who called them ""Romans"" or ""Greeks"" in an academic article written for scholars of that period of presentism?"

On the subject of primary sources, Seamus Heaney's verse translation of Beowulf is lovely, and available as a bilingual edition (Old English / English).

A few personal recommendations:    A Distant Mirror by Barbara Tuchman, for an immersive account of France during the late middle ages (Black Death, Hundred Years War, &c.) Viking Age Iceland by Jesse Byock, a good overview of what it says in the title. If you want to read primary sources about the Vikings, try the Poetic Edda, Egil's Saga, Njal's Saga and the Vinland Sagas.  Montaillou by Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie is a classic of medieval historiography.

It is sort of like German, there are a lot of cognates, the alphabet is essentially the same (plus a couple letters), and there are a bunch of extant manuscripts. Many of them you can get with annotated translation, like Beowulf. Plus, once you learn Old English, you basically get a working knowledge of Middle English thrown in for free.

MedievalHistory,33end3,historybuffCO,2,Tue Apr 21 22:18:16 2015 UTC,"Interesting. However, this paragraph bothers me a great deal 'The first castle ideas arrived “from France, always a place of cutting-edge fashion”. They were mere motte and bailey fortifications, earthen mounds with wooden structures, humble in comparison to what exists today, but according to author Edd Morris, nothing like them had been seen in medieval England, and their appearance would have been like the landing of an alien spaceship in the countryside today.' There's actually quite a bit of debate about whether this is true, and the general consensus is that the Anglo-Saxons had something very similar if not exactly like a castle. There's one (I forget where, sigh) pre-conquest motte-and-bailey in the Welsh Marches. I would highly recommend John Goodall's 'The English Castle'. It's widely considered the best and most up to date publication on the subject."

(so actually not quite medieval, but it's close)  Actually Rosemary Sutcliffe wrote a number of fiction novels about ancient Britain through the 17th century (but mainly to 1000 CE). Most of them are aimed at children/young adults, but they are pretty good.  The Seeing Stone trilogy by Kevin Crossley-Holland are YA novels about a boy growing up on the Welsh marches in the 13th century who is (kinda) the reincarnation of King Arthur... there's more to it than that and it's really good.  Umberto Eco's Name of the Rose takes place in medieval Italy. There are some very long, tedious parts, but overall it's good.  Crispin and the Cross of Lead by Avi, another YA novel.  I know I've read more, but these are the only ones I can remember right now. I'm interested to see what others contribute, too!"

Another one that's very accessible is The Black Death: A Personal History by John Hatcher.  Grim subject matter, but Hatcher departs from his usual serious, historical style to try to present a narrative including more of a human element of what it must have been like to live in an English village afflicted by the plague.

MedievalHistory,30z7mr,kittenishgirl,12,Wed Apr 1 00:00:07 2015 UTC,"Because the people who run it take the presence of non-White people in Medieval Art as concrete evidence that Medieval Europe was some sort of cosmopolitan, multicultural society. It's like they think that Europeans in the Middle Ages couldn't know about non-White people unless they were actually there, living among them. What's more likely is that these paintings were rare, time-consuming, and expensive, and as a result sought to portray stuff that was new, and interesting, and different.  In addition, where did all the 'POCs' (Stupid term btw) go? MedievalPOC would have you believe that non-White people were relatively common in Medieval Europe, and yet when you look at the earliest European censuses which recorded race, the population of Europe is overwhelmingly White (>95%).  Finally, the blog just grabs onto any shred of evidence they can to justify their position. I can't find it now, but for Christ's sake they used Edward, the Black Prince as evidence. They even started claiming that Mozart was Black.  I'm not saying that there were no non-White people in Medieval Europe, but their presence was incredibly limited. It's just the worst kind of Historical Revionism."
MedievalHistory,30z7mr,ColonelRuffhouse,5,Wed Apr 1 00:17:33 2015 UTC,"You might be interested in this thread over at /r/AskHistorians where we discussed MedievalPOC and problems with identifying race in medieval records. Below is my post from the thread.  The chief problem with MedievalPOC is not its intent to show that diversity existed in medieval Europe, but that the records from the time (both words and pictures) cannot be simply interpreted by our modern ideas of race.     So, for the record there was this conversation last week which examines some underlying assumptions in using 'race' as any sort of measuring stick of human descriptions before our epoch.  'Non-white', the same as 'black', or 'asian', or any other modern race definition are just that, modern which is what /u/telkanuru is referring to as a 'sociological construct' in the linked answer. So, we are faced with two problems when we look backwards into Medieval Europe.  \1. The first is the problem of whether the verbal or visual language we receive from the past actually conforms to our indicators of race. The first hurdle is translation, and the second is idiomatic expression. Did a reference to someone being 'black' in Latin actually mean a 'black' person, or did it mean someone with black hair in a culture where black hair was unusual? Or even further, did reference to 'black' actually mean some local idiom which referred to an aspect of character or of origin lost to us now?  This first point is important because, from examples within my field - the medieval period - we are not going to find chroniclers referring to 'some black guy from nigeria' or some such thing. We have references to Moors, or Moslems, but they might look 'Latino' or 'Middle Eastern' to modern 'scales of race'. Is that a separate race? We might have a reference to someone from Egypt. Or Africa. How are we to establish the race of the referent under these terms?  When it comes to visual depictions like we frequently see in MedievalPOC blog, we don't know if the manuscript, painting or fresco coloration is always actually a reflection of a racial difference or if it holds some other meaning. This is not to discredit the blog's intent or assertions entirely, but merely to problematize the assumptions to the point where we return to the same question. What we can say is that pre-modern western sources did not care to establish race according to what we think is now important. Consider this inversion for a moment: in place of whites and blacks, were are more likely to have heard prior to 1000 a discussion of the natures of the 'race' of Angles, Saxons, Franks, Germans. How are we to reconcile our modern notions of race with these terms?  \2. The second problem is depth of evidence. If we take some written or visual depictions as actual reflections of skin colour, and therefore of modern race (and I hope you already see the massive problems just getting us to these assumptions) are these 'frequent enough' to make broader assumptions about 'people of colour' in the medieval world? Again, we just don't know because again pre-modern sources didn't use race the way we use race. In medieval society it was apparently far more important to establish whether someone was Christian, or not Christian: that was worth noting.  All of the above can pretty much stop us from answering a well-intentioned question about modern notions of representation of race so important in many modern discourses. So, that said, I'd like to answer your question on its own terms, whether those we classify as 'non-white' (according to, say, an American census form) were visible in daily life in Western Europe. Realzing of course the depending who you ask today non white may or may not include 'latinos' (Spain) or 'arabs' (again Spain, and many other parts of Mediterranean Europe).  Here's a lot of ifs and mights for you:   Vikings were exceptionally well travelled 800 -1000 and they may have encountered 'black' people in lower Spain, or southern Italy, or Constantinople, or in the Holy Lands. It is possible that they might have slave-traded 'blacks' or 'middle easterns' and some may have returned to northern ports. The Moors of Spain were established through the Moslem invasions of the Iberian peninsula.Those Moslems had come across from north western Africa and so may have included 'blacks' and certainly 'middle easterns'. Those same moors travelled up into southern France and established themselves in colonies and cities from Toulouse to Narbonne to Provence. They established forts and castles in Provence. Beyond the incursions and wars, Moslems travelled up and down the Rhone river trading slaves to 1100. Moslems also frequented ports of Southern France like Montpellier and Nice. Of course the various crusades brought Western Europeans in contact with peoples of the middle east which definitely included 'arabs' but might also have included 'blacks' and 'asians'. There is some evidence of Irish contact with Mediterranean peoples in the early middle ages - some of those people might have been 'non-white'. And of course throughout the medieval period, from late antiquity through to renaissance, we have the travelling merchant; he might have been from northern Europe, or he might have been from southern Europe; he might have encountered 'non-whites' or he might have been 'non-white' himself.   So we can gather from above that some inhabitants of some towns and some cities in medieval Europe all the way up to parts of Scandanavia encountered 'non-white' peoples, whether they be described by modern terms as Arabic, Middle Eastern, Black.  How many and how far afield into the very rural landscape of medieval Europe? Who knows. And anyone who makes generalist claims for or against is not arguing about the past but arguing politics of today. It holds something of a lesson if we care to look at it: race is constructed, not eternal.  Whatever we aren't sure of, we can be certain of one thing: there was no such thing as 'white society' in the European medieval period."

MedievalHistory,30p7yc,fawn_rescuer,4,Sun Mar 29 14:13:49 2015 UTC,Just watched an episode of the series Medieval Deaths. They were searching for Edwards chapel that he had built on the site of the battle. Very interesting if you get the chance to see it.

MedievalHistory,30ki8s,oawjr,6,Sat Mar 28 04:04:38 2015 UTC,"Before printing press a small monastery library was usually 200-300 books, even university libraries rarely housed more than 1000  books. Personal libraries were much smaller. The cost of a unornamented 14th century book was comparable to the  cost of a car today - so many in principle could afford it but it still was quite expensive. Most private books were devotional, scholars were of course interested in philosophical and theological literature but these books were much more rare. There are often complaints that there are too few good books on the market and the monks tend to snatch them up. Book production was a slow process and took many months."

MedievalHistory,30ki8s,Durendal_et_Joyeuse,2,Sat Mar 28 11:35:12 2015 UTC,"I'm a book historian, but if you need sources then e.g. Wilbur Lang Schramm, “The Cost of Books in Chaucer’s Time”, Modern Language Notes 48, 3 (1933), p. 141, gives several book prices and it also calculates these to ""modern"" (i.e. 1933 values).  Also, most medieval books (at least before 14th c) were not written on paper, but parchment. This means animal skins and even today leather is quite expensive. One bible needed a medium sized herd of sheep - you could get around 2 full sheets of parchment from one sheep. Preparing the skins etc took also a lot of time."
MedievalHistory,30ki8s,satissuperque,1 point,Sat Mar 28 14:52:26 2015 UTC,"My understanding was that by around 1400, rag paper was at least invented. I'm not sure how widespread it was. Did that serve to bring down the costs of books at all?"
MedievalHistory,30ki8s,satissuperque,1 point,Sat Mar 28 15:05:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, it did somewhat. The paper production in Europe begun around 12th c. In Italy they developed a method of using wire paper molds (laid paper) and there appear also first watermarks. Paper was cheaper than parchment but it was also considered to be inferior (and in some way this is true). My experience with 13th c books is that nearly all of them are on parchment, only in 14th c paper books start to appear more often. Parchment was in common use even in the middle of 15th c., e.g. Gutenberg printed some of his bibles on parchment. Anyway, scribal work and binding were still expensive."

MedievalHistory,30ki8s,MisterRoku,1 point,Mon Mar 30 13:27:57 2015 UTC,What made them expensive? How much did paper and the bookbinding cost and how many hours of labor did the book consume?
MedievalHistory,30ki8s,satissuperque,1 point,Sat Mar 28 08:36:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert, but I believe books were relatively rare things during this time period.  Also, an extensive library during that time might seem quite small by today's standards.  Only the well to do, universities, and monasteries would have significant libraries.  The vast majority of people didn't own a book, not even a Bible or religious text.  I'm basing this half-baked answer off of what I recall from Ian Mortimers's book http://www.amazon.com/Time-Travelers-Guide-Medieval-England/dp/1439112908"
MedievalHistory,30ki8s,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Mar 28 14:34:54 2015 UTC,"Bible was very rare in personal use, as in Catholicism bibles are not very common devotional books. Normally lay people, if they had any books, had Books of Hours."
