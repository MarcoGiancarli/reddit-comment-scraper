MarkMyWords,3dz83r,blahkbox,8,Mon Jul 20 21:10:36 2015 UTC,"In modern presidential history (starting with Truman, it's a little arbitrary, but meh, that's where the pattern begins) it alternates in eight years of a Democratic President then eight years of a Republican president every time except for the Reagan effect when Carter only had four years and Daddy Bush got in on being Reagan's Veep and maybe got his re-up stolen by Perot (although some younger redditors may only be familiar with libs Reagan bashing these days at the time he was wildly popular and won the support of many moderate dems). Don't forget that even though JFK & LBJ went back to back as Dems LBJ took finished JFK's first term, and then only ran for re-election once making it eight years, and Nixon-Ford as back to back Reps when Ford finished Nixon's second term and didn't seek re-election.   Of course that all could be coincidence, but I though I couldn't prove it I think there something at work there. Probably something subtle along the lines of by default any true moderate blaming anything they're unhappy with on whoever is in the hot seat at the time after eight years and figuring better give the other guys a shot. Even if they do so somewhat subconsciously.   For this election specifically thus far the Reps are looking good because of the deep field. Whoever emerges will be well vetted and battle tested by the time the general comes around. By comparison in the Dem field there are only about four candidates declared so far that have that anyone is taking seriously and realistically could win the nomination, and only a couple other ""rumored possible"" candidates (Warren and Biden, though I personally don't think either will run). The dem candidates won't have the same ability to adjust their campaigns learning what's wanted because they won't have to. And of the two front runners they basically can't change. Hillary is Hillary and you either like her or you don't at this point. Sanders probably could adapt himself more-so, but his declared affinity to Scandinavian Socialism is out there and if he strays too far from that he'll get swift-boated to a degree. I also don't think he would modify himself for mass appeal. I'm not in on the reddit circlejerk of love for the guy, but he does seem at least to his credit to have always been upfront about who he is.  /$.02"

MarkMyWords,3dz83r,GaroldWilsonSnailJr,6,Mon Jul 20 20:35:33 2015 UTC,I honestly think that's what's happening. He's a way for legitimate candidates to appear closer to the center and also get some of the minority vote by dismissing his statements (as you said). It's a smart strategy and it's no surprise Trump was to take the fall. It's not like he doesn't have a shit reputation anyway. I just don't know what the GOP plan for the 30+ candidates is. I don't know if they've lost control or what.  This is also the stupidest MMW I've ever seen.

You're close but that's not it.  Trump is not a Democrat anymore than Bush was behind 9/11.  Democrats and Republicans are really the same party in virtually all meaningful ways.  They trade power back and forth like rival drug gangs and fool most of us into thinking they are enemies by using the old ""good cop, bad cop"" technique.  The corporations that our elected leaders rulers report to give money to both parties, with a slight variance here and there (Oil companies give slightly more to Republicans while Unions and entertainment industries give slightly more to Democrats).  Our parents, grandparents, and most of us have and continue to be almost entirely fooled.  Don't give in to conspiracies like Trump being a Democrat, or Bush being behind 9/11.  That type of BS only helps the bastards in power stay there and keeps us from addressing the real issues."

MarkMyWords,3dhg5u,Sokonit,4,Fri Jul 17 01:23:53 2015 UTC,"Not really. The beginning of Gamergate was that developer who happens to be female develops a game that most people consider to be bad. However, it gets good press from several people. Later, it is revealed that she had had sexual relations with the news personnel who gave her game good press, while in a relationship with someone else. Most of the gaming news media refuses to report on this, later to be revealed because they were in communication through the ""Game Journo Pros list"". After this fails to quell the anger, the sites, with the help of the usual suspects of Brianna Wu and Anita Sarkeesian chaulk up the whole movement to sexism. 6 months later, here we are. Gamergate is about stupid identity politics. It's been skewed in retrospect to be ""misogynists shame a sexually free womyn for having sex and being a gamer"".  Sad part is, I wouldn't put that past modern gamergate."

RationalWiki has a section on Reddit and the moderator there is pro-SRS; in the section on /u/violentacrez, there is personal information (name and location) about where he lives.

He has a history in both UFC and WWE so he's going to call out CM Punk for doing what he did. 5 is likely that CM Punk talks to his best friend about wrestling(Colt Cabana), and ends up seeing stuff here and there, not to mention he probably still follows ROH and NJPW a bit too. 6 doesn't really mean much to me I guess. And 7 was resolved in legal proceeding after his departure where they paid him off or something IIRC.  Now, my far out guess is that Seth Rollins joins or employs the wyatt family to defeat Brock Lesnar. Mostly because Wyatt might win over Roman Reigns so they cna keep this feud going for a bit.   My medium out there is that Kevin Owens gets added to the match and wins and becomes HHH new poster boy, with Stephanie backing a face Seth.  My least far out, is the Shield reuniting and Seth just saying how he planed it all out from forever ago.  Or, have the Undertaker come back. If it's not Sheamus, I'm ok with it."

It's an interesting theory.   and this last expac was all about time travel and changing history   It's not actually. The draenor we go to in the expansion is an alternate universe. They've been saying since the reveal that it will not effect our universe in any way (beyond whatever we bring back with us or characters form our universe who die over there). They've made it fairly clear that aren't interested in diving in to the time travel/history alteration rabbit hole any further than they already have with the caverns of time.  I doubt they'd ever do a universal retconn though. The lore and story is very important to a lot of fans, I can't imagine them throwing it out the window, especially not when they have so many novels and short stories and whatnot feeding in to the expanded universe. Frankly I (and most of my friends who play) are only still playing the game because we love the lore, if they reset it all I doubt any of us would come back for the new game.  If anything I think they could use finally taking on the burning legion as an excuse for releasing WoW2 (a new game and new systems for taking on a whole new level of threat, etc etc) as it would let them make a new engine that can support the kind of large battles and epic scale questlines that are, frankly, the only thing that will make defeating the legion properly satisfying."

It seems too convenient that the level cap is an even 100 right now and that the movie will be coming out about the time a new expac would come out.  Maybe it'll just be a way to reset your characters to level 1 or whatever, but something biggish will happen I'm pretty sure."

MarkMyWords,3cwsdq,TheDannyDevito,6,Sat Jul 11 15:36:34 2015 UTC,"You seem so hopeful about finally getting aliens that I'm not going to explain to you every reason why the probability of that happening is literally lower than the probability of you getting hit three times by lightning in a row right now with a blue sky and a closed room.  EDIT: Alright, since several people have already asked, I'll tell you my main reasons.   If there was life on Pluto, it would have to be very primitive or barely sentient. I'm not arguing with that. However, OP seems to think that they would have developed spaceflight, allowing them to steal New Horizons. What's more, it implies that they would be advanced enough to be capable of sending spacecrafts without batting an eye to go pickup an object several million kilometers away. That is implausible to the point of impossible for several reasons.  First, we have gotten nothing from Pluto, ever. Scientists on Earth have been sending out messages into space, in all directions, to let an possible advanced alien species know about our presence. Now, I don't know exactly how they are sent, but if there was a spaceworthy species on Pluto, they would most definitely have received one of the many communications that went their way. Why, then, would they refuse to answer? Sure, maybe they wouldn't have replied, but I find it very unlikely. And if they did abstain from responding, that would mean they'd be hiding from us. If they were hiding from us, do you really think they'd risk our spotting them by sending a craft to forcibly retrieve the probe of an alien species they are aware of but are hiding from?  Also, we humans have not made a secret of our presence on Earth. We have massive cities shimmering at night with tens of thousands of lights, and have a multitude of artificial satellites orbiting the planet. Our airspace is filled with planes coming and going at all times. I highly doubt that the theoretical inhabitants of Pluto would have missed our presence when it's so obvious, especially since out planet is the most interesting one in close or even far vicinity.   Indeed, Earth is the one planet that we know of (and there have been a lot of missions to find others) that is so fit to harbor life. You think that spaceworthy residents of the same solar system would have missed that? Of course not. They would certainly have sent probes, and those probes would have fund us, or we would have found them. Even if they hadn't developed spaceflight yet, they would be very interested in the planet and would be even more interested if they received a transmission from it. They wouldn't abstain from responding.  Finally, if there indeed was a species on Pluto capable of spaceflight, they would have to have cities or large artificially-made structures. Can't have spaceflight if you're still living in caves after all. But then why haven't we seen anything remotely indicative of this? From Orbit around the Earth, astronauts on, say, the ISS can easily see some features on the ground such as straight highways with their naked eye.   In this situation, we instead have an extremely powerful telescope pointed straight at the planet's surface from a very close point with teams of highly trained scientists poring over the pictures it sends back day and night. If there was a species that had developed spaceflight on the planet, they would most definitely have some form of large structures, which I find very unlikely that New Horizons would have missed at such short-range, especially since it's taken pictures of both sides of Pluto.  Now there are possibilities that could reconcile the hope of aliens with these facts: Maybe there are aliens on Pluto but they have consistently and flawlessly been hiding from us. Sure, that's possible. But you'll get hit by lightning thrice in a row in a closed room before it becomes plausible.  EDIT:My third point is now supported by this comment in /r/askscience."

I would compare cheap branded Beats to something like a cheap Gucci purse. Gucci wouldn't want to be associated with cheap things, so they wouldn't do it. Beats are a status symbol (you can get better headphones cheaper and use your own equalizers if you actually know what you're doing with music). Giving a cheap option would cheapen their brand."

Add on the fact that Robert Downey Jr. has stated that he no longer wants to be in iron man movies because he is no longer challenged by the character. yet he has agreed to take part in this movie... why? I think because it means he has to try to play a hero who kills a friend and fellow hero to defend his beliefs. It is a role I think very few actors could pull off and the challenge of it is enough to put RDJ back in the suit"
MarkMyWords,3c6ece,FuckMeRunning5648,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:20:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you have read civil war, and I haven't either, but I don't think that's how it happens.  From the wiki:  ""In the aftermath of Civil War, Captain America is taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody where he is assassinated per the order of the Red Skull. Crossbones snipes at him while Sharon Carter, who has been brainwashed by Doctor Faustus posing as a S.H.I.E.L.D. psychiatrist, delivers the killing blow.""  This certainly doesn't discredit your theory, though. The MCU takes the comic storylines, and tweaks and twists them to fit a movie, and believable, format. I also have a hunch that Tony will have a part in Cap's death, but not directly, as your theory states. This definitely adds a different dynamic to Tony Stark, and can motivate RDJ to reprise the role."

MarkMyWords,3c6w07,TotesMessenger,0,Sat Jul 11 11:53:43 2015 UTC,"Are you saying that Reddit now isn't beyond recognition from the Reddit of 2010? Any website with an even marginally active community and staff should have undergone considerable change over the course of 5 years. In that time, a newborn will have grown into a preschooler, a 10 year old will have become old enough to take driver's ed, and a kid who just got his licence will be old enough to drink. In 2010, the Kinect was brand new, Obama didn't have grey hair, and the idea that Russia would be portrayed as a villain in popular media was seen as trite and outdated. Nobody could point to Ukraine on a map, nobody knew what the Boston Marathon was, and the idea that Greece was chronically indebted was a new joke. Feminism wasn't a dirty word, Gamer wasn't a dirty word, nobody knew what ""misogyny"" meant without looking it up first, and BDSM was seen as slightly more weird than it is now. JonTron didn't exist, nobody knew who MovieBob was, and IGN was taken seriously. VR was a pie-in-the-sky gimmick. Xbox 360s were still white. 5 years is a pretty long time.  But you get the point. Next up, the majority of submitters and content creators do not care. Not even a little bit. There's a vocal minority calling Ellen Pao a maoist, and a vocal minority calling the first minority problematic shitlords, and a very very large majority who just comes onto Reddit to catch up on the news, or talk about their favorite game, or post memes or cat photos. To paraphrase Yahtzee for a moment, two groups of affluent middle class people annoy each other, and the rest of the world at large gives less of a toss than a quadriplegic shot putter. It's hard to avoid once you've gotten caught up in it and you're seeing microaggressions or political correctness everywhere, but if you just don't care about an intern getting fired and some subreddits you never visited getting banned, it is very easy to ignore. Profoundly easy.  So MMW. Most of the anti-SJW crowd will leave. They'll probably be found on Voat or 8chan. for maybe one more year, Reddit will be slightly more SJW. Then the feminism wars will stop being trendy, and all the people bitching about their identity politics will sink into obscurity where they belong."

And several other subs' mods have had and voiced their problems with reddit's generally inattentive and opaque administration.   I couldn't care less about /r/fatpeoplehate or /r/coontown or the other groups of sociopaths that migrated to Voat. Good riddance.

In other words you can log in, make comments, and upvote, but nobody sees your comments and your upvotes don't count. Apparently people go to /r/ShadowBan and post to see if they've been shadow banned.

I'm also not sure what about that infographic makes you think they're psychic, or how it proves that ""Reddit's time is up"".

What does it do for you that Reddit does not? I got curious and poked through your posting history, and I see from it that you've either posted about or started threads relating to Voat here and on /r/voat, /r/Futurology, and /r/theydidthemath, to say nothing about your threads about today's activity on /r/newreddits and - and this one is my personal favorite absolutely absurd thing - on /r/Detroit, where you tried to say that Reddit will be the internet equivalent of Detroit soon. Oddly, that post was deleted, perhaps because it stinks of ignorance.  All of this is very, very strange, to say the least.

MarkMyWords,3bk592,AnnieAnthonyAudrey,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:36:04 2015 UTC,No I had never heard that.
MarkMyWords,3bk592,PapaBradford,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:38:34 2015 UTC,I thought he was raising the bar

MarkMyWords,3biu8n,Soorena,2,Mon Jun 29 16:10:37 2015 UTC,Oooh. I could see it.

MarkMyWords,3bi85g,bran_dong,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:47:28 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be surprised if you actually played as the baby. Why else would they go through the trouble of rendering a child's face just to fry it in the first few minutes?
MarkMyWords,3bi85g,scottalott,2,Mon Jun 29 23:08:56 2015 UTC,I didn't see the rendering of any child's face. I did see a robot recognize the player after 200 years though.
MarkMyWords,3bi85g,bran_dong,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:39:46 2015 UTC,Ah. I thought they showed that in the trailer. I might be remembering wrong.
