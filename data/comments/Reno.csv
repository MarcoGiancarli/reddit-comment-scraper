It has been used to host one or two one-off events though, on a bring-your-own-utilities basis.   I believe they are planning to renovate it, but need to raise the considerable capital.  Can you imagine stage productions there every night during Art Town?  That would be awesome."

At one point they owed the city something like $75,000 because they had to borrow to pay salaries, and the estimates for the necessary renovations range between 10 million, and 15 million."

Reno,3dplvx,renoryan775,2,Sat Jul 18 09:09:21 2015 UTC,Can you provide more details?  I was thinking about doing this but didn't know anyone interested.
Reno,3dplvx,riffraff100214,2,Sat Jul 18 18:01:00 2015 UTC,"The company at Tahoe is Sailing ventures. They offer ASA classes, which I will probably do with my buddies, either there or in the bay. Those are 3 day ordeals that get you certified.  However, whats more important, is just getting time out on the water. They offer 2 hour ""lessons"" where it's 1-4 people and it's totally up to you how much/what you want to learn. You can just lounge out on the deck and do absolutely nothing but drink beers and nap for 2 hours, they don't seem to care. So if you just want to hang out and drink a few beers out on a boat in Tahoe, that's totally fine too.   The base rate is $190 for the 2 hours. But, as you bring more people, the total cost goes down, and the cost is split between the people going, so at 4 people it's only $45 a person.   I think we can go at pretty much anytime we would want.  Not sure what other details you are looking for. Me and my roomate are 25 and just looking to pick up a new hobby, we might charter a boat for a few months in the Carribean/Thailand/NZ area this winter and just sail around for a month or two, which is why I am trying to get experience. If you guys just want to join in, chill on the deck and drink my beers while totally ignoring what I'm trying to learn/do, that's perfectly fine with me, as long as I'm not paying $190 for 2 hours :)  e: to add in, I might buy a sunfish, laser, or similar small boat. There is a fairly active meetup that races lasers up at Tahoe on Monday nights (or Tuesday, I forget) and that would be a fun way to get into it as well. If I get a sunfish I can definitely start taking people out to show them the basics in the future"

They also make the neighborhood look terrible. Right across from the Eldorado is a blatant drug den motel. The only characters that live there are usually walking outside and selling drugs, or taking them.  The begging is annoying as shit too.

Reno, at surface level, is a really trashy city. It wasn't until I spent a few weeks (far longer than most people who visit and then go home and tell their friends about how trashy it was), that I found the charm. I'm no longer in Nevada but I do miss Reno. It'll always have a special place in my heart as probably the most unique city in the states."

I've lived in a number of places myself, as well as traveled extensively, but there's something genuine, something gritty and something very unique about this place, beyond it's spectacular location and amenities.  The arts scene, for example, blows me away. You always read about how some social or artistic movements spring out of some specific locale -- think Haight-Ashbury, Woodstock, or the Seattle grunge scene -- and that seems to be happening here in spades. I'm most familiar with the local comedy scene, and we have gads of comics who are on par with some of the best up-and-comers in the Bay Area or SoCal. We know this because they tell us when they come here to perform."

My dad, mom, and aunt came here for school in the 1980's and I heard story after story about random Reno hijinks and what not.   Growing up in Las Vegas you hear tons of stories about Reno too, how it's ""Gross"", everyone is an alcoholic, and homeless people run the streets.  Then Reno 911 came out and that perpetuated the Reno stereotype.   When I came here six years ago most of this was true, doesn't mean it wasn't nice but Reno downtown and east side/sparks is fucking nasty. Tons of sketchy people downtown, lots of issues with homlessness, old abandoned buildings.  I've been to 15 countries since, including most of Asia and Central America and I have never felt more unsafe than in downtown reno.  Reno is great because it has it's charm and booze are dirty cheap and things have gotten MUCH better the past few years, but lets not kid ourselves and say Reno isn't a shit hole, but it's out shit hole."

If you want to go out in Reno most of the good bars are downtown/midtown.

These earthquakes are part of the Sheldon Sequence, and it's been going on for a little over a year now. Just so you all know: it doesn't appear to be related to volcanism. The geodetic data doesn't support that possibility; the earthquakes have been consistently occurring at shallower depths throughout the year; these earthquakes are locating near known faults; and active swarms are fairly common in Nevada (likely related to Basin and Range extension coupled with a number of other factors)."

Prices are reasonable and cheaper than a lot of the big ones I checked (peppermill and Atlantis). I opted for the upgraded room, breakfast in the morning (which I stumbled into drunk and on 2hrs of sleep to make a plate for when I woke up) and a happy hour with free craft beers, Napa wines, and apps. Nice room, comfy bed, fresh baked cookies when I checked in, and nice staff."

Reno,3dax7m,LazyDriver,4,Wed Jul 15 00:31:12 2015 UTC,"Stayed at the GSR, very nice property and probably my favorite property in the world for its value.  Eldorado's damn nice, but only if you plan on sightseeing downtown (Atlantis and Peppermill have nicer rooms and amenities). The restaurants are very good and the connection between the Silver Legacy and Circus Circus gives a lot of breathing room."

Peppermill has nice rooms with a ton of stuff including nice lounging and atmosphere. Atlantis is more in the central part of town so you can get to north and south Reno easily.   Honestly most of the big hotels here are nice, just make sure you have what you want to do planned ahead of time because Reno's attractions are spread out throughout the city."

If you call reservations at a big hotel ask for the special deal you saw, like you got something in the mail.  Also if you book over 8 rooms you can get a discount.  If you call someone and just bitch and complain long enough is give you whatever just to shut you up.  Best rooms for price: Whitney peak.  Best rooms: Pepper mill . Cheapest : circus circus.

We're all locals, but we host events all over the western US and hadn't done an event in Reno before.  Our people checked out many hotels and casinos and decided the Whitney Peak was the nicest for the price.  I only work on their computers so I can't comment myself, but I've stayed at a few of the casinos around here for various reasons and I'd say the Peppermill is the nicest if you get more than a basic room otherwise probably the Silver Legacy.  If you're not looking for a casino I'd recommend the Whitney Peak and it's right between several casino's anyway."

As for the coverage issues Sprint hands down sucks in town. Sprint has two issues 1st there are dead areas in town like north East Sparks (Los Altos Parkway) My phone at best has 1 bar of 3Gish.. And you have to play the can you hear me game for Voice. As of data forget about it. Its a dead zone. 2nd  they seem to have a reliablity issue with their network. At both my house (Sparks near Victorian Ave) and My Office (Wells and Ryland area) I normally have 4g coverage and my data zooms, But from time to time (A few times a week) something happens and I can be in the same spot and I will only get 3g data for about an hour to a couple of days. I at first thought this was my phone.. But after a couple of replacements and a couple of co-workers having the same issue at the same time.. Its their network. The pros of sprint is for the most part it works in the rural areas that surround reno.   As for T-mobile I never had any issues with there service (voice, data, and speed) in town.. To my recollection it worked great in town and some of the surrounding areas like the North Valleys and Carson City. But and this is a big but... I didn't work well or at all in places like Pyramid, Fallon, or In between larger areas..   Hope that helps.."
Reno,3cec9m,mrmatti3,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:17:22 2015 UTC,With family members spread across multiple carriers it seems that Verizon has best coverage - you get what you pay for. ATT in second and Tmo 3rd with good urban coverage and Sprint is just.... Out there.

The only phone supported is the Nexus 6 which Google requires you to buy, but they will allow financing with zero interest.  My bill comes to about $70 a month.  Google FI utilizes T-MOBILE, SPRINT, and WIFI for service.  So far the service has been meh.  I have a support ticket open to find out why my WIFI calling isn't working and download speeds on LTE are about 5mb down and .2 mb up.

Reno,3bsv18,TerminallyILL,16,Wed Jul 1 21:37:41 2015 UTC,"Well, as an avid angler of Northern NV and CA, I can try to answer.  It is a devastatingly sad situation to be honest, whether you fish or not.  Easy answer:  Drought is fucking them up.  Long Answer:  The drought has caused the flows in the river to cut down considerably, literally almost nothing really in some areas (I've heard 6 CFS in some spots East of town).  This is horrible for the Trout in the river.  Trout typically have trouble sustaining life in water temps over 68-70degrees F.  You can read much more about this here.  With the lack of water and temps over 100degrees F, the Trout have nowhere to go.  The water temps are rising rapidly to the point that there is not enough oxygen in the river to sustain them.  They become hungry and exhausted and are easier prey to predators such as birds, etc.  This drought in the West is absolutely destroying our fish and wildlife.  The pessimist in me does not see an end in site.  I truly feel that this is life on earth now for the foreseeable future.  Rising temps and lack of water.  Sucks, and I hope I am wrong...fly fishing is my life's passion.  There are talks of possibly trying to band together and save some of these fish, this happened last year as fish were relocated from the Truckee to other water sources.  The problem this year, is that there are no water sources to take them too because even the reservoirs are at record lows, not to mention the fish will most likely not survive the stress of a move.  It's bad, it's real real bad.  You'll see more and more fish on the banks this summer.  The flash flood yesterday also made the river very muddy and some of these fish may have suffocated on silt.  I can only hope that most fish survive the summer and I'm wrong about the lack of rain and snow I think we will get moving forward...  Hope this answers your question, sorry so long."
Reno,3bsv18,BallsJesus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:37:05 2015 UTC,"Awesome answer, shitty truth. I've heard (like every year) that this will be a wet winter due to el nino but we'll see. I sure wouldn't mind a little extra liquid in our nature."
Reno,3bsv18,Roscoe_Merriweather,2,Wed Jul 1 23:38:28 2015 UTC,"This is definitely an El Niño year, however that doesn't promise anything. A lot of our wet winters (I think around 80%) have coincided with El Niño patterns, however under El Niño conditions we've also had dry winters.   The earth is a complex system and no one can predict the end of our drought with any certainty."
Reno,3bsv18,jrwreno,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:43:15 2015 UTC,"As a very very observant Gardener, landscaper, horticuluralist....these last 3 years have confused the hell out of me.  This year in particular. Very very mild winter, early spring......lots and lots of rain early summer.....but the kicker is this: All the fruit trees are having very early leaf color change, and leaf drop. Not due to fertilizer washing out, not due to fungus or disease, or weird moisture.....this is indicative of fruit trees beginning to follow Fall pattern leaf color change and leaf drop.  This only happens when we are going to have a major f-ckaroo of a snowfall, and a very early and deep snow winter."

I  went swimming at the Mogul hole today and we saw a stack of dead fish on the bank. It looked like someone caught them and then left them. It was too weird so we went to the other hole further up stream and jumped in. It wasnt until we saw another dead fish in the river before things started looking ... fishy. Then we saw at least a dozen more dead fish. The water was warm but not boiling. Is anyone else seeing this around their sections of the river?

My plan was to go back and forth for school; summers/Christmases in Vegas, school year in Reno. However, less than halfway through the first semester, I totally fell in love with the city.   The people. Man. Don't get me wrong, there are still some assholes and some crazies, but your odds of a Vegas asshole being the person next to you in a grocery store is 1 in 5 people, Reno is more like 1 in 200. I was so surprised how much nicer people are here. I dropped some stuff once by the University, and some people rushed over. I assumed they were trying to steal my stuff, so I panicked. Nope, they were trying to help pick it up for me.   Vegas is such a fast town that everything is a snap decision. And usually the aggressive one. In Vegas, if you're not sexy, you're ignored or treated badly. In Vegas, if you don't have your debit card in your hand ready to go at a store, people behind you roll their eyes and tap their feet while loudly sighing. In Reno, everyone just kinda seems a little less aggressive. They're more polite and it stems from the fact that many people here have lived here for years and years, and know tons of people. There's a sense of community you'll feel immediately after you arrive.   People drive slower here. Again, there's still assholes, but in general, a light turns green, and there's a pause before they drive through the light, in Vegas, if you're not moving the INSTANT the light turns green, someone honks; not in Reno.   If you're staying in the dorms, you have a great opportunity to explore close to downtown without actually living in the conditions of downtown. Wander into some shops, eat at a local restaurant. It's a completely different atmosphere than Vegas.   In an hour's drive, you can leave the downtown hubbub and be in Tahoe, or Susanville, or Gardnerville, or Fallon. Each city offers wildly different things. Tahoe has swimming, skiing, expensive restaurants, and a zillion other things, go hiking in the forests near Susanville, or skydiving in Gardnerville, or check out the airforce base and farmlands in Fallon. In Vegas, for such a big city, you run out of things to enjoy if you're under 21, and even after 21, drinking and gambling only holds its excitement while it's a social event.   Overall, be excited. Reno is wonderful. I went to UNLV my freshman year, and hated it. I felt like it was high-school 2.0. Cheerleaders all sat together and mocked the kids with glasses and calculators. At UNR, people encourage each other.   I love living here. I've met some wonderful people, and after a few years, you'll start to meet people and find out you have a mutual contact, and your network will keep growing. You'll be amazed at how many people know each other.   Be ready for Vegas hate. People who live here generally only have poor things to say about Vegas. But how many people have you heard in Vegas complain about Reno? Probably none. Reno is passionate and proud. Vegas is indifferent and cold.   Welcome to Reno. It's an amazing city with culture in spades. From ArtTown to the Santa Crawl, be ready to enjoy something different every day with people who love their city.   PM me if you have any specific questions!"
Reno,3be1p5,crashandsmile,6,Sun Jun 28 15:46:24 2015 UTC,Everything you said has made me pumped! I'm just hoping that overall people like to go outside of their houses. It seems in Vegas that the heat usually makes everyone hate anything outside their house.
Reno,3be1p5,VoidRayBeach,5,Sun Jun 28 16:46:39 2015 UTC,"I moved up back in August. The city is smaller, its much faster to get around. There are also a lot of great food enterprise's up here. Make sure to stop into the local shops, there are tons of them."
Reno,3be1p5,groove117,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:26:44 2015 UTC,With the few shops and food places I've been to the service is probably the best. The people are very open and kind and makes the experience so much better.

Reno,3be1p5,Id_rather_be_lurking,4,Sun Jun 28 16:29:07 2015 UTC,"A few things that stand out for me after the same move would be the water quality in Reno is outstanding. Filtered water from a fridge in vegas isn't as good as tap water here. There are also better places to eat I think. Vegas always seemed so overrun with corporate chain restaurants, which are fine, but it gets old so fast. Up here there are local joints as well as the chains which is a nice balance IMO"
Reno,3be1p5,guywithfro1,2,Sun Jun 28 17:11:14 2015 UTC,"When you get up here, make another post- we hosted the meet-up and have been thinking about doing another BBQ or two over the summer- ""Back to School""/End of Summer seems like a pretty good time, and then you can meet some new folks!"
Reno,3be1p5,Sardond,2,Sun Jun 28 17:39:19 2015 UTC,"There's a sense of community here that I've never felt in Vegas.  The huge community events are so well attended here, that it really feels like a fun, communal experience.  And, they happen often.  In Vegas, the same events would have niche followings and you probably wouldn't hear of many of them.  But the people here are down for whatever, and you can definitely feel that sense of community.    I hate to bring up the rivalry, but it definitely feels like there's a greater percentage of Reno residents that support the Wolf Pack than Las Vegas residents that support the Rebels.  Growing up in Vegas, I've always felt like UNLV was just there.  Even when the Rebels did great things, like in basketball, I never really felt like there was much of a buzz in the city for it.  At least, not like you'd feel at a Nevada season-opening game.  I don't mean this to say we're better than them, but I do mean that it makes your college experience really fun when you feel like non-students and even non-alumni are cheering just as loud as you are at a game.    I think it's a better place to live than it is to visit.  Just come here with an open mind (something that a handful of Vegas students have a hard time with) and be willing to get involved in stuff.  In Reno, it's really easy to find something to love if you do."

The house next to me got a new renter the day after the old renter moved out.  I'm used to it being vacant for a few months between renters.  I'm in Old South West Reno.    Midtown and OSW are nice.  University hill to the West of UNR is a decent neighborhood and close to where you need to be.  East of Midtown along Wells is pretty nice, and there are a lot of (older) smallish houses there.    All of the new construction has been shitty, remote, unwalkable, tract housing in the burbs for the last 15 years, so houses near the center (Midtown, Downtown) will tend to be older.  Settle on either new or livable, or get lucky finding a recent remodel in an unlucky market.    Good Luck!"

Reno,3b486b,sarrone28,2,Fri Jun 26 00:40:47 2015 UTC,"Finding something walking distance from downtown and UNR is going to put you near UNR, where unfortunately the houses are not fantastic in the way of upkeep. There are some places in downtown that aren't bad but they are all towered apartments.  If you are able to drive, a few places to look at that might have what you're looking for would be Donner Springs (McCarren and Mira Loma Area), Hidden Valley is also in this area. This is about 15-20 minutes south of downtown and UNR. McCarren and Mae Anne is another area that is pretty nice, about 10-15 minutes from downtown and UNR. Although a little further away than you would like I've heard good things about Caughlin Ranch.   I'm sorry I couldn't give you better advice on places walking distance from downtown/UNR but from my experience the houses are ran down, and apartments are a hit and miss for quality. But if you have your heart set on being in that area, do look at the tower apartments, I hear they are very nice.  Good luck to you!"

Dropping a bike in the cold on a bunch of ice sucks more.  :)  Cons are the seemingly endless road construction, the city's love for slurry seal to fix roads (tar mixed with loose gravel - it sucks to ride on because of all the gravel), and the drastic temperature drops after the sun goes down.  If you pack some insulated gloves under your seat it's not too bad usually.  I love it here though.  If you watch any of the motovloggers on YouTube, they usually complain about needing to drive hundreds of miles to get to the fun roads.  We have 341 (""Geiger Grade / Mt. Rose Highway""), Highway 50, 79 from Truckee to Tahoe, 49 from Auburn to Tahoe, etc.  There are so many fun, twisty roads so close to home that it makes owning a motorcycle awesome.  I ride a spot bike so I go looking for the twisties.  :)  If you're into sport bikes, there's a group here that organizes rides and track days almost all summer long:  http://www.sierrasportbike.com  There's also ""Bike Night"" every Wednesday night at PJ's throughout the summer:  http://www.pjandco.net/bike_night.html  Riding up to Virginia City on the weekends is practically a rite of passage here.  Lots of Harleys and fellow riders to hang out with there every weekend.  If you're into dual-sport / adventure riding there's another group here that formed recently that's trying to organize rides:  http://www.meetup.com/Northern-Nevada-Adventure-Dual-sport-riders/  I love this place.  :)"

Reno,3agdu1,Ritualistic,2,Fri Jun 19 23:16:42 2015 UTC,"I like the one at California Street on Saturdays. It's not huge, but usually has a really good selection of produce. Obviously the huge one is the Sparks one on Thursday. I used to go to that one but it got too big with too many drunks. I heard it's better since they moved it away from the casinos, but I doubt it. The one at the Methodist church is small but ok too. The Grove one is small, as is The Summit."
Reno,3agdu1,random_user_name_13,2,Tue Jun 23 05:39:03 2015 UTC,"Some of the info in that is old. There have been some major shifts this year.  The Thursdays Sparks farmers market has moved to the tent at the Sands.    A new one ran by 39 North has started and is much smaller, more craft oriented.  I was there on its first week and was a bit underwhelmed unfortunately.  There were only 2 venders selling, and both were selling limited fruit.  Hard to have a ""farmers"" market when very little food is being sold.  If every farm vendor that was in Sparks moved over to the sands, that is probably your best option for variety."

Reno,3abhrp,Mavsma,2,Thu Jun 18 21:47:00 2015 UTC,I heard it's where Swensens used to be. Tucked away in the corner of that shopping center. Not 100% on that though.
Reno,3abhrp,zydrateriot,2,Fri Jun 19 00:40:29 2015 UTC,It is where Swensens used to be in the shopping center in the corner. From what I heard they won't have beers on tap yet but that is something they plan on working towards after they open.
Reno,3abhrp,Wahhchaa,2,Tue Jun 23 02:41:58 2015 UTC,"It is an interesting location. We needed a place that was already a restaurant for plumbing, sinks, grease interceptor, etc. Finding places like that in Reno is super difficult. Swenson's was one we had our eye on since they closed (which was honestly really sad for me, despite getting such a sweet location for our business). While we waited out their lease we tried to find other places and couldn't drum up anything. The pros are that the space is perfect size, fully equipped, great rent (I told the landlords ""your place is empty, I'll bring it attention, give me a good deal"" and it worked), and everybody knows where Swenson's was so its really easy to tell people where we are. Hope this wall of text was interesting!  To answer other questions, its in the shopping center, just beer and wine to start but we'll get to a full bar eventually! No taps to start but that'll be coming soon too."

It was a value choice to get more games in there instead of big arcades, though I intend to get an Atari emulator and any kind of ""arcade classic bundle"" game I can find on any system.

Do customers choose what they want to play, or are they stuck with whatever is hooked up at the table they are at?  -I heard there was a back room that could be reserved. If so, does it have any special amenities? Is it for tabletop gaming or video gaming, or both? Is there a charge for reserving it?   Either way, I'm planning on being there tomorrow! Really excited to see something like this opening in Reno!"
Reno,3abhrp,msxenobia,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:34:41 2015 UTC,"Good questions. Anything with the games is variable within reason. We put specific games in the machines just as a best guess but we have a library you can choose from. As far as systems go, if it is busy we don't want to move them around but on slower days or if you're planning a group around a game, we can figure something out. And as far as the back room, that is delayed significantly. The room we planned needed to be used for food prep according to the health department if we wanted to have a restaurant license. The room we might be able to use instead is going to take some time to repurpose. So, for now, it is just the main room. Look forward to seeing you there! Let me know if you have more questions."
Reno,3acleg,King_Reptar_,3,Fri Jun 19 00:35:30 2015 UTC,"There's 3 different areas that fit what you are looking for. Definitely don't expect a palace.    Northwest - Lots of newer, nicer apartments. Typical suburban neighborhood so it is safe. Don't expect to be walking distance from anything interesting. River/Downtown - The apartments typically are older and more expensive but there is much more to do. I lived in this area for 3 years and loved it. Downtown is a ton of fun. There's always events and it's always fun to hang out around by the river. Lots of bars and restaurants. Be warned there is much more crime in this area.  Midtown - This is more the upcoming/hipster part of town. Also nowhere near as safe as northwest, but there is a lot to do. Lots of trendy bars and restaurants. However, there is some sketchiness and crime in midtown and the surrounding area.   I mean crime isn't really that bad downtown or midtown but they both can be sketchy. I lived downtown for 3 years without anything bad happening to me. Basically apartments in Reno are a trade off between being near cool stuff and being safe.   As for finding a specific place... just look on zillow. It's pretty easy."

Reno,3acleg,ng731,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:43:39 2015 UTC,Midtown is directly south of downtown. The area surrounding California street.   Definitely not between Reno and Sparks. That's probably the most dangerous area.

Either negatively or positively?"

Currently living in comstock hills and given the price range it seems to be one of the few cheap apartment complexes in Reno that doesn't seem to attract the bad kind of low income sketchy people, rather working-class people. It's close to the nice area of south Reno and also close to the highway and McCarran. OP I recommend checking it out. They also have 'end units' which is a one bedroom bottom floor apt with no one above you which is kind of nice. Also management is the best I've come across in Reno"

When I first signed up, I only wanted internet. No phone, no cable. They decided that I was wrong, and started calling my cell phone every day (sometimes multiple times a day) , while I was at work, to try to get me to upgrade.  I asked them to stop calling me. Didn't work. I asked for a manager and told the manager to get them to stop calling me. Didn't work. I asked for the manager of the manager. I got employee IDs. Nothing worked.  The only way that I was able to get them to leave me alone was to complain to my local Charter representative. He apologized, made a call, and it went away. Haven't had a problem with them since."

It shows willingness to pay and at least it doesn't go onto collections. Ask them to reduce the cost if you pay the balance in cash.  This only works if you actually have the money (don't ask to pay less AND be on a payment plan)   I personally have done both of the above options.  Your other option is to: 1. Not pay them. It will eventually go to collections, it will be a derogatory hit to your credit. HOWEVER Most lenders no longer view medical collections as a big deal anymore.  You can still buy a new car, house, etc.  Unlike consumer debt and installment loan defaults, medical collections don't carry much weight.  Also, in the long haul and after the collection is no longer 'fresh' on your credit report you can try and dispute the charges.    I did this twice and the collection company (remember it is no longer in Renowns hands) couldn't prove the debt was mine and it was removed."

Ive lived in a couple cities and have tried many barbers, its always the same. 2 or 3 people ahead of you if youre there on a weekend. Youll be greeted right away and will have no wait time with an appointment at least 3 days in advance. If you walk in thats fine, theres always a tv on or at the very least magazines to read. Sit down, wait patiently, youll probably be greeted as soon as the current customer being attented to is out of the chair. Most barbers put their focus on the details of their craft and whatever is left of their mental capacity it is rerouted to the conversation theyre having with their client. Im not sure about you but I wouldnt want to have it any other way.   You want bells and whistles acknowledging your almighty prescence immediately, head to the fucking clown college. Youll fit in."

Reno,39h9k1,CondorLane,44,Thu Jun 11 18:28:39 2015 UTC,"Reno is by no means a perfect place--it can be very dirty, unintelligent, and ""small town"" feeling. If you stick around casinos it will feel much more this way. But Reno is recovering and transforming, some of the great things it has are as follows:  1) A beautiful tier-1 University that is on the rise. Founded in 1874, it's nestled just north of downtown, presenting a very east-coast feel. Every once in a while you'll see the basketball/football team catch fire and have a good season (which can be entertaining to see in person if you're into that kind of thing). Also there is a modernist planetarium that is not only gorgeous, but educational.   2) Reno is quickly growing a local, organic, foodie and bar scene. The New York Times agrees.  http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/20/travel/a-reno-neighborhood-drinks-in-style.html  3) A small (but growing) art community. The entire month of July is Artown in Reno, which features thousands of events (not an exageration). There's a fledgling Art District located near the river, anchored by Reno Art Works. We have several small theaters in town that put on productions, as well as the Pioneer Theater downtown.  4) Downtown isn't just casinos--there's a fairly nice riverwalk area lined with local restaurants, bars, and shops. Once you reach the outdoor ampitheater at the urban park, you'll find the downtown rapids park, where you'll often find kayakers doing flips. Don't expect metropolitan, its often more small town feeling down there. During summer you'll find plenty of large events (BBQ, Blues, and Brews, Hot August Nights, Wing Festival, Downtown Farmer's Market, Marathon Mural Paintings, etc.). A lot of these are sponsored by casinos, but they can still be fun.   5) Being outside. No really, Reno has 4 seasons, summer is rarely over 100 degrees, winters are mild (light snow, never really all that cold though). We're top 5 sunniest cities in the nation every year. Drive 30 minutes, you're at Lake Tahoe on the beach either sunbathing or enjoying world class skiing. If you're bored, it's your own damn fault.  6) Local sports! We have a AAA Baseball team, the Reno Aces, that pack a beautiful new stadium (and actually win with surprising frequency). We're home of a NBA D-League team, the Reno Bighorns, who've installed a revolutionary (and highly experimental) system that is WILDLY entertaining to watch.  I could keep going for hours, but ultimately Reno is what you make of it. Downtown can be dirty and filled with homeless people, but at the same time I've seen groups of homeless people in San Francisco in the Tenderloin openly smoking crack in abandoned lots. Cities have their rough edges. Education is a huge problem (and with it culture) as the city has previously not needed an educated workforce--although that is rapidly changing. You're not going to find opulent art galleries or theaters, you'll find small local ones filled with deeply passionate people. Let me know if you have specific questions on anything else."
Reno,39h9k1,Lyrical_Word_Smith,24,Thu Jun 11 19:10:50 2015 UTC,"If you stick around casinos it will feel much more this way   That hits the nail on the head. Most folks that visit here, and publicly bash it, never got out of a 6 square block area of downtown. To them, that's all that Reno is... casinos, dirty streets, and homeless people.  They never range out far enough, or stay long enough, to see all of the beauty that is here. A laid back attitude, a high amount of volunteerism, a spirit of radical inclusion, world class ski areas and mountain bike trails, events happening nearly every single day of the year, and Lake Tahoe is just 45 minutes away."
Reno,39h9k1,hi_from_brian,-7,Thu Jun 11 20:49:45 2015 UTC,"you act like the casino scene is just for tourists. i think the casinos are the cause of the problems that are purely about locals. lack of jobs, poor education, poverty, crime, etc.   if you enjoy the city for the things it does well (the outdoorsy stuff), then you'll be fine, but you really need to stay away from anything casino related, including the people, otherwise reno can be pretty horrible."
Reno,39h9k1,WitBeer,11,Thu Jun 11 21:03:53 2015 UTC,"As someone who works in economics, I can say a lot of things you're asserting are off. Casinos definitely have nothing to do with a lack of jobs (they are HUGE employers in this are, we can question the quality of those jobs, but not that they provide them).   Blaming poor education on casinos is narrow and inaccurate. Nevada has a long (and sadly proud) history of supporting industries that require little to no education; I don't hear people blaming mining however (which is ironic because mining is TERRIBLE for economies). Also short-sighted on that is the quality of Washoe County School District when taken separately from the state of Nevada. Washoe is actually a very middling school district (it compares favorably to the 24th best state in terms of education). Also tax breakdowns are not the most favorable to casinos (in terms of industries they suffer fairly). Don't get me wrong we have far too many regressive taxes that unnecessarily burden those in poverty, but that has more to do with Nevada's libertarian lean than casinos as a whole.   The poverty claim is also tenuous at best. Casinos often have more of an effect on near surrounding areas--Dr. Nichols at the University of Nevada has published research regarding the ""exporting of bankruptcy"" associated with gaming. Crime is also similar--the University of Maryland found (somewhat inconclusively) that casinos do increase the cost of managing crime, although this effect is less than the taxes brought in by gaming and tourism.  Ultimately the sin Reno (and the rest of Nevada) committed was not allowing gaming, but relying on it solely. Reno has not opened a new major casino since 1996, and has focused squarely on diversifying its economy. We're not safe yet, but much progress has been made, and casinos do have their place in that recovery--they'll just never be the king again here.  Don't get me wrong, the person that responded to you is blaming low academic performance on kids not caring when really we should examine systematic failures for those in poverty. Casinos are what you make of them, without them we wouldn't have many events that have HUGE economic impact on our community, and provide many other jobs through indirect and induced impacts."
Reno,39h9k1,Lyrical_Word_Smith,-3,Fri Jun 12 03:51:26 2015 UTC,"Read up on the casino owners' efforts to keep Lear Jets out of Reno due to a fear that they would bring higher paying jobs and increase casino costs. That's just one example. Of course new casinos have opened since 96. They just opened on the sites of former bankrupt casinos. But yes, the reliance on casinos is the #1 problem. The casinos have convinced everyone of how good they are for the economy and the public eats it up. And casinos do keep the jobs away because good companies are hesitant to move to places like Reno."
Reno,39h9k1,WitBeer,5,Fri Jun 12 04:00:06 2015 UTC,Read up on the casino owners' efforts to keep Lear Jets out of Reno due to a fear that they would bring higher paying jobs and increase casino costs.    just spent about 3 minutes searching and couldn't find a single article about it. care to share one or two?
Reno,39h9k1,standardalias,3,Fri Jun 12 15:04:04 2015 UTC,"This guy is way off base.  Lear didn't even ever intend to manufacture ANYTHING in Reno.   Lear's engineering team was never run out of this town by casinos.  There were at most 15 employees who developed the Lear Fan, up in Stead.  It never got acceptance by the FAA before Lear kicked the bucket.  It was the FAA, not casinos, who shut Lear out of manufacturing in Reno.  Moreover, it was an incredible idea, but would have been hard to bring to market with cheaper, more effective craft bring developed quicker than the Lear team."
Reno,39h9k1,themosthatedone,3,Sat Jun 13 02:52:51 2015 UTC,There are a funny things about your stupid rants.  1) They have no factual basis.  The casinos actually have a huge impact on our school budgets; the problem is that money doesn't fix the fact that our school system is flooded with kids who don't GAF. There are actually some really good schools here. The poverty rate is actually very low compared to some of your beloved metropolitan areas that you must be contrasting reno to.  Crime rate is also fairly low.  So what is the excuse for Chicago if it isn't casinos?  2) You still live here.  What do YOU do to make it better?
Reno,39h9k1,themosthatedone,-6,Fri Jun 12 02:33:21 2015 UTC,Are you dense? The casinos actively try to keep out high paying employers. And blaming the kids? Wow.
Reno,39h9k1,WitBeer,6,Fri Jun 12 03:07:10 2015 UTC,"The casinos aren't actively doing anything except hemorrhaging money.  Blaming the kids?  Not entirely; I'm blaming the fact that they have dick for values.  This however, is the case with the majority of cities.  All cities have good schools and shit schools."
Reno,39h9k1,themosthatedone,-1,Fri Jun 12 03:17:22 2015 UTC,"they have dick for values because our current society takes their side when they call the cops on their parents for disciplining them. this leads many lazy parents to just say screw it, and let them do whatever they want, instead of actually caring and continuing to use what little society gives them to use against their kids attitudes."
Reno,39h9k1,Megamantrinity,4,Fri Jun 12 08:23:35 2015 UTC,"Great write-up.   For a long time Reno had a fairly well deserved reputation as a poor place to live. The heyday of gambling and divorce were over and the city pretty much stagnated. It's come a long ways in last 15 or so years. The whole riverfront has been redeveloped, the arts scene has really started to blossom. Midtown seems to have something new and vibrant every week. While it doesn't have the best bike infrastructure, it's a natural bike city in a pretty flat valley. Access to public desert land is about as good as it gets so there is plenty of exploration to do. Old mining sites, dirt bike, atv, jeep...  Coming from California, no personal income tax is certainly nice. It seems like our small tech and gaming sector is growing and with Tesla, Apple and Switch I think everyone hopes that continues. No inventory tax and a somewhat central western location means that there is a lot of trucking and logistics.  As others have mentioned, there's Lake Tahoe which is quite nice. San Francisco is only about 4hrs away. The airport is reasonable compared to most others."

I know a lot of people that hate Reno, but when I ask them why, its all really outdated knowledge of the place. People complaining about what they experienced 10-15 years ago. Pretty ridiculous. Its changed sooo much since then! Heck its changed so much the last 2 years. The craft beer in Reno is growing at a large rate, the old casinos that have been closed for awhile are being replaced with new remodeled places, areas are being cleaned up and looking damn nice now like the river area, lots of great restaurants.

Reno,39h9k1,Mustangbex,12,Wed Jun 17 16:49:17 2015 UTC,"The best things about living in Reno. Decent Golf courses, Close to Tahoe (one of the most beautiful places in the world). Cheap entertainment and food. Gambling is legal. Hot August nights is one of the best car shows in the world. Great skiing, cheap housing, Great places to go 4 wheeling. I have found many Petroglyphs that are unknown to anyone but myself, hiking up around galena, Mt. Rose. It can be a great place. Don't get caught up in gambling, use it to your advantage. There is a way to gamble and never lose. My system is simple: Sit at the bar, play video poker somewhere where drinks are comped. Put in a 20$ and order a drink. Only lose the value of your drink.  ie: Beer = 4$, I allow myself to get down to 16$ and then I have to pound my beer and order another before I play anymore hands.  Repeat and be sure to tip your bartender. You will only ever be paying for your beer + tips, which is a fair exchange. If you win some money....Get up and get the hell out of there."

I currently live in Raleigh, NC, and I've lived all over the world, and I can never understand why people dog Reno - It's small (convenient life), VERY close to major cities (SF, OAK, SAC), has one of the most beautiful lakes and mountain ranges in the world (Lake Tahoe, Sierra Nevada, Pyramid Lake), a GREAT outdoor scene (dozens of lakes in the northern reno/cali area -- Graeagle, Frenchman's, etc. -- you can ski in the winter and mountain bike/hike/fish/camp in the summer, needless to say Yosemite is only ~2.5 hours away), wildlife is great - we have bears, pheasants, bob cats, mountain lions, coyotes, big horn sheep, etc.,  the weather is fan-fucking-tastic and its economy is currently BOOMING with major companies in the area (TESLA, Sierra Nevada Corp, DELL, AMAZON, Barnes and Noble, etc. etc.). as well as a hopping Indy restaurant and craft beer brewery scene downtown.    If you lack the sense of adventure, expect to pay for your thrills or someone to entertain you from the tourist trap that is downtown, and are on the lower side of creativity you're going to have a bad time.

It was my first taste of the West, and I fell in love with the place, especially the mountains.  In the time I've been here, Reno has undergone a lot of change. And right now, we're in the midst of a creative resurgence transforming it into a hip, happening small city worthy of its beautiful location. One thing that hasn't changed is, it does have a very small town feel, even though there's something like 300,000 people in the metro area. Everybody just seems to know everybody else.  I will concur that Reno currently has an incredible arts scene, with many local artists performing out of their league. I do standup, and Reno's comedy scene features a number of comics on par with the Bay Area.  Oh, and nobody's pointed out the area has a pretty rich history, including the silver boom in Virginia City (that attracted the likes of Mark Twain), the birthplace of riveted blue jeans (Levi's), the last great train robbery, celebrity divorces and marriages, and the development of the rocket engines that took us to the moon (Rocketdyne). We've also got a couple of cool museums: the Nevada Museum of Art and The National Automobile Museum.  I will point out, if you do move our way, you'll find the climate very dry and a whole lot sunnier than what you're accustomed to.

To a thriving Arts and Technology Community that no longer really relies on the casinos as much as we once did.   Depending on what kind of stuff you are into we have a ton of stuff to do. From Hiking, Boating, Fishing, Gambling (if you enjoy that), to dedicated art spaces and a thriving Maker community. I agree ""If your bored, it's your own damn fault.""

I mean I guess it can be dirty after a wind storm??  There are a lot of construction workers here and I know they go out to eat all the time when working/renovating downtown (at least I did when I was doing that line of work) Maybe they would be considered the ""dirty"" and ""dress badly"" people?  Downtown has a fun nightlife scene. I like more casual laid back bars and with the emergence of some of these microbreweries it has only gotten better.   The weather can be windy year round, summer can also be hot but its a dry hot. If you stand in some shade you are good. Winter is for the most part pretty mild. I don't think I ever wore more than jeans and a waterproof jacket this past winter.   It is a beautiful place with beautiful people."
Reno,39h9k1,MarkJolle,2,Thu Jun 11 22:20:34 2015 UTC,"I've lived in Reno for about 5 years and attended college here.   There are aspects of Reno that are great. 1. The University 2. If you're a drinker there are tons of bars and cheap alcohol.  3. It's cheap and is close to big cities and the west coast. 4. Lake Tahoe.  5. The Weather is generally really good.  6. Tons of upcoming and good restaurants/bars. 7. Burning Man is close and I'd say other than San Fran, Reno has the second biggest Burner culture. 8. No income taxes.   I will say however there is a lot of bad aspects to Reno as well. 1. It is dirty and down right disgusting in parts of downtown and east Reno. 2. Reno at times feels like a younger brother to Portland( take that how you will). 3. There are some overly conservative people, and a bit of red neck culture. 4. I just don't feel like Reno is a city where you say ""Man I feel alive, this place is amazing"". 5. Job market is bad. Twice the unemployment as many other cities. 6. I don't feel like I meet a ton of cultured, smart, and unique individual people in Reno outside of the University. I feel like I'm constantly meeting the same 5 people over and over.   Overall I'd say Reno is 6.5/10  city. Whereas I'd say San Diego is like 8.5/10 And San Fran in my opinion is 7/10."

I've found it to be a very nice place, and most of the people I interact with seem perfectly fine.   I guess if you were to mostly hang around the casino area of town, you might arrive at that sort of conclusion?  Even then it seems a bit harsh.  Every city is going to have shitty people.  Reno has plenty of good ones too.    It's got a really nice developing area with lots of cool restaurants, bars, and shops.  It's close to Tahoe with a ton of hiking and skiing.  Hell, you're even close to San Francisco (only a 4 hour drive or bus), so if you want to check that out you can.  Lots of groups to meet up with to do whatever you want.  If you're into a little bit of gambling, you can even do that.  It's not a place that I would plan to stay in forever, but Reno is a great place and I like it a lot."

In the meantime, I agree with /u/charkbait77 and get your sub license so you can at least get into the schools to make sure that is the grade level you want to teach.

You do need to take the Praxis exams and you'll also have to take a Nevada Constitution class or test.  The process of getting hired in WCSD is long and there will be group interviews before any individual.  I was hired quite a long time ago and didn't go through it, but have heard it isn't the best experience. My advice would be to get hired as a sub while you go through the process of taking tests/applying/interviews, etc. so you can meet people and get a feel for the schools as they are vastly different.  I would also suggest looking into some alternative schools like charter schools to get some experience if you can't get licensed right away or the hiring process becomes longer than expected.  It's a good time to get into teaching though, because Nevada is apparently in the process of approving a signing bonus for new teachers."

Does Merwins do Warhammer? I live like right by all of those places so I'm stoked, I thought I had to drive to sparks for some Warhammer."
Reno,399yw7,wartornhero,3,Wed Jun 10 20:31:23 2015 UTC,"\5. Would be any of the places /u/_busch said. Although I am pretty sure Merwins or Games Galore doesn't have comics just board games and magic and warhammer players. They may be able to point you to a lovecraft group as well.  7.) Welcome to living on the north side where all the video games, TV shows, and movies go to Vegas and we are quite happy about it!  Hope to see you at the meetup! I am sure you can find someone there to talk to about all of the things on your list. I am going to make a new post with times and information after my Fiance and I flush out some more details."
Reno,399yw7,wartornhero,2,Wed Jun 10 15:50:45 2015 UTC,"If games galore is the one in meadowood mall they don't do Warhammer, but they do rps and stuff sometimes which is nice. But I'm going to try Merwins today.  Yeah I'm originally for SoCal, I lived here for a year a while back, and just moved back because I love it here. I just don't know where anything is and have no current social life lol.   I'm a huge fallout fan, hence my pissyness at there being no returns to new reno which was awesome in FO2."

Comic Kingdom is at Kietzke and Moana - by the Peruvian restaurant.  Go join Great Basin Geeks on the facebook.  We are also having a big gaming con at the end of the month: http://www.ragecon.com/  Welcome!"
Reno,399yw7,ema1237,2,Wed Jun 10 18:05:39 2015 UTC,"Write thank you so much. I love right by the Meadowood Mall, so comic kingdom is super close which is great.  You're the first person to give be a tattoo shop name, so I'll go in and see what they can do with my designs.   Haha I deleted by FB about a year ago. But that might actually make a new one if it means some nerdy socialization.  Thanks for the heads up!"
Reno,399yw7,random_user_name_13,2,Wed Jun 10 22:46:47 2015 UTC,"Black Hole has been in reno for 20 years, they consistently win the ""best of"" contest, and they're the only place I use for my numerous piercings.   Lasting Dose (Formerly Nightmare Studios) is one of the best Tattoo Shops (and now art gallery) in town- right near Black Hole, also a preferred shop of mine, but Tattoo shops are like mechanics, everyone has their favorite and loyalty is huge."
Reno,399yw7,random_user_name_13,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:28:10 2015 UTC,"Wow people really like Black Hole. I'll definitely be going there.  I'll check out that tattoo shop, I have designs and just want to see what some of the local artists can do with them."

Reno,399yw7,jasminessw,2,Thu Jun 11 03:40:41 2015 UTC,"I can't answer most of your questions but I personally think The Black Hole is the best place for piercings in Reno. I've gone there for my last two piercings, a cartilage and conch, and they're great. Can be a little pricey but I have not had any problems with them healing or poor quality jewelry. The staff is super friendly and they're very clean and quick. I recommend them to all my friends. There's a student discount on Fridays as well if that applies to you.  Can't speak too much for Fallout 4 but it sounds like a lot of people are pretty excited for it!"

Reno,399yw7,Clayh5,2,Wed Jun 10 23:39:54 2015 UTC,I think you might! I haven't gone in on a Friday before but it's like $10 off a piercing or something. Sometimes it can get pretty busy!

Reno,393z7n,Formaldehyd3,8,Tue Jun 9 16:26:31 2015 UTC,"I originally suggested the BBQ at San Rafael, but if we have such accommodating hosts at a private location, well, that's hard to argue with. What side of town are you guys on?"
Reno,393z7n,THESALTEDPEANUT,7,Tue Jun 9 07:21:20 2015 UTC,I would be more inclined to show up to a public park.
Reno,393z7n,o6ijuan,4,Tue Jun 9 09:48:26 2015 UTC,I went to the rooftop meet a few years ago. It was pleasant and accommodating. It's basically a public venue at the top of a private building. I would go again no problem.
Reno,393z7n,Mars_Velo1701,7,Tue Jun 9 17:53:25 2015 UTC,Being that I'm actually in town for this even this year.  Seeing what the last events unfolded I would love to be socially awkward with a bunch of complete internet strangers. I am down for whatever.
Reno,393z7n,wartornhero,5,Tue Jun 9 07:32:21 2015 UTC,"For those asking for information/scared about private location. 1.) We are in park tower on Arlington, Our condo overlooks Wingfield park.  2.) /u/mustangbex and I have done GRMD before at our place. Interesting tidbit, I organized 2011 (picture: http://i.imgur.com/WHuS1.jpg) at Blues, Brews and BBQs. I was out of town in 2012 /u/mustangbex hosted it. Met her in 2012 at my curiosity landing party, early 2013 after hanging out a bunch at weekly craft get togethers we started dating, now engaged. We are not serial killers, although 2 serial killers who host meetups online and live together sounds like a good idea for a Sitcom. Keep an eye out for that on AMC in fall, 2016.  3.) Pictures: 2012: http://imgur.com/a/OjNs5#0 2014: http://imgur.com/GdXNvpO  I would be okay with San Rafael or Mayberry, or idlewild meetup. Might not be bad with it being over 90 and there isn't much shade unless someone can bring up a popup shade on our rooftop. If it does happen at our place. Thinking about starting ~3:00 go until whenever. Bring sunscreen, something to share. We can provide burgers and hot dogs and fixin's for both. I will have a keg of homebrewed White IPA.  Bring board/card games if you want. We have 12 person Telestrations and Cards Against Humanity."

Reno,393z7n,The49ersBlow,3,Wed Jun 10 01:54:23 2015 UTC,"I'm all for the rooftop, if only to finally meet our gracious hosts.  Should we put together a list of what people can bring?  Obviously, beverages and finger-friendly snacks are at the top of the list. I'll be happy to chip in picnic dining ware -- disposable plates, cutlery, napkins and cups. And maybe a deck of cards, in the unlikely event that there are three other euchre players in attendance."

Reno,393z7n,bangsecks,2,Tue Jun 9 16:51:43 2015 UTC,Is there a link to a voting poll? I need more info on the rooftop. How big is it? Can a kid fall off it? Got pics?
Reno,393z7n,Crokesmack,5,Tue Jun 9 17:10:34 2015 UTC,"Wait, kids?  Are kids going to this?  I don't want to go if kids are going crazy all over the place."

Reno,393z7n,doppelbock42,2,Wed Jun 10 15:14:23 2015 UTC,"I think voting is just comments. Roof top is decently sized probably about 1600 - 2,000 sq ft.

Reno,3934o2,PINKDICK,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:24:07 2015 UTC,"It's a great show....The trio (Clarkson, May and Hammond) just left the show because of something that happened between Clarkson and a producer. He punched the producer, admitted to it, and still got suspended and his contract was cancelled, so the other two went too. But watch all of the old episodes, they're goddamn hilarious. There's a bunch on Netflix..The holiday specials are really funny..My faves: Africa trip, Northpole excursion and the Falkland Islands."

When I was in the Navy, I was stationed in Fallon, and a bunch of us were visiting Reno for the weekend. We pulled up next to a convertible Mustang, and the guy in back had a movie camera. We asked him what they were doing, and he said filming for a new show on Comedy Central. He told us to flip off the camera and scream when the light turned green. Anyway, later that year Reno 911 came out."
Reno,38ywo9,cambria05,3,Mon Jun 8 04:12:47 2015 UTC,"Of course. For me, all those characters are people that can be found in downtown Reno on a Saturday night.Not just the main characters, but the random people they arrested tried to arrest too.

Artown; especially Monday evenings in Wingfield Park are Family Nights (partnered with KNPB), Wednesdays are World Music Nights, and Friday are Movie Nights (Princess Bride on 7/10). Also there are a handful of workshops and art classes each day (painting, plays, stories, pottery, etc), the Terry Lee Wells Nevada Discovery Museum, the River School Farm, and stuff at the Rancho San Rafael Ranch House."

Help clean up Marryberry Park, meet some cool people, have fun, and potentially get into a awesome new hobby.   Or, just get them into geocaching in general.  There's thousands around Reno!  We're essentially in Caching Mecca, lol.  PM me if you'd like more details or just check out geocaching.com  It's basically a scavenger hunt with GPS.  Go outside, have a goal, explore, have fun :)"

The events are really fun and family friendly, you help out the community for a little bit while hanging out/meeting new friends (the actual clean-up part usually lasts less than an hour) then afterwords have a BBQ or something.  It installs good values while being entertaining to kids, and might inspire a fun new hobby for them."
Reno,38uu6k,FroggiJoy87,0,Sun Jun 7 20:14:58 2015 UTC,So do you get money or something for finding stuff?
Reno,38uu6k,bumperstickershock,2,Sun Jun 7 20:29:25 2015 UTC,"Sometimes.  I've gotten a $10 gift card to Starbucks before, and a nice pair of headphones as well.  I've found lots of foreign currency too, but in terms of US money it's usually spare change.  The majority of caches contain simple nick-nacks (small toys, puzzles, costume jewelry, etc.) that kids love.  The standard rule is if you take something you leave something, I usually leave guitar picks for example.    I know this sounds corny, but honestly, the real reward is going out and exploring a new place you otherwise would most likely would have never gone, while also being part of a fun community to celebrate (and compete) with."

Reno,38hu35,Mavsma,2,Thu Jun 4 14:29:13 2015 UTC,"It happened at about 1:30AM on 6/4. I was still up, and my power went out near Pueblo St and Virginia, then I heard a loud boom. I went outside just in time to see the lightning-like flash of a transformer blowing. It seemed like it covered a pretty big area, so I drove around to see what I could see.  The outage seemed to be roughly a rectangle with Plumb and Plumas in one corner and Taylor and Kirman in the opposite. The VA still had power though, it didn't look like they were on battery backups.  I don't know how many people are usually out at 1:30AM in this area, but I saw more than I expected. I saw a pair of young women walking around each holding a candle. A few people with flashlights, and few peoplel looking a bit lost. It seemed dangerous to drive or even walk around, because everyone was blowing through dead stoplights without even slowing down. I saw a fire truck in a supermarket parking lot using their lights on the building, probably to deter theivery.   It was pretty interesting seeing my familiar environment in an unfamiliar state.  When the police showed up and started putting down flares and guiding traffic, I went home. I didn't want to add the confusion.   I got an email saying the outage affected about 4,500 NVE customers, but the RGJ reported it was only 400. More top notch reporting -- or NVE didn't want them reporting such a big number. I think the power turned back on around 3:30AM, much sooner than the 6:15 estimate from the email.   Neat stuff."

Pigeon Head, probably the best lagers I have ever had. The Depot which is also a distillery. and according to their facebook hours, IMBIB is opening today at 6:00, their brewmaster is the best sour beer brewer in the state.  You did miss Reno's first Craft Beer Week that was really fantasic and I hope they do it every year.  March 4th Marching Band is opening for Art Town on July 1st. Since last year Art Town now runs 32 days instead of just to July 31st.  Several new restarunts have opened up a couple have moved. My short list includes The Bridge, used to be Scampi, before that Amendment 21. Not particularly anything special but the chef is the chef from 775 Gastropub, and she brought along a couple of favorites from 775. Now if only they had a better beer selection.  Provisions, A project of Mark Estee, my favorite project but I may be biased because I live and work downtown. Cafeteria style eats but with more Wow factor, decent happy hour and a great selection of fresh meats and cheeses.

Fantastic Taiwanese - think 101, but a little upscale Mustard Seed - second floor of the CalNeva - solid Southern, dirt cheap Two Chicks - Gourmelt ladies closed up the truck and now have this brick and mortar spot Lanna Thai - new location in Coughlin Ranch; my favorite Thai Royce - new wine bar by the Imperial/Granite/Lincoln guys, sharing the Granite kitchen Heritage - part of the re-branded Whitney Peak, and another Mark Estee venture (though his role here is a consulting role a la chez louie, as opposed to owner/operator like Provisions and Campo) Crawfish Asian Cuisine - solid boils, and good Chinese Butcher Boy is going to re-open soon Minato moved to a new location Laughing Planet - Portland based burritos/bowls/vegetarian-ish Villa Donato replaced the Little House on Center - Italian instead of breakfast Centro - tapas on California Old World Coffee - boutique coffee on California Hummus - Mediterranean on California   I'm sure there's some other food related stuff, but that's what I can think of since last summer"

Then they opened the 3 lane bridge freeway down south and Reno-Carson commuters are the worst! They will drive three-wide ON GODDAMN PURPOSE, refusing to let you pass!  Three wide! Can you fucking imagine how stupid and proud you have to be?!  I'm not talking your typical driving in the fast lanes. I'm talking nobody else for a 1/4 before or after them... and they drive right next to each other."

But one thing I have noticed on the running red lights thing here, traffic lights seem to take a really long time in this town.  Also, they are not well timed, you can end up getting stuck at so many.  Getting from Plumas and McCarren to 580 seems to take FOREVER.

Reno,36s702,randyhutton,3,Fri May 22 01:55:50 2015 UTC,"Bay Area native here that comes up to Reno 2-3 times a year.    Here's my route (reversed of course):   I-80  I-5  I-205/I-580 I-680 S into San Jose   Taking I-80 the whole way into the Bay is OK, but you'll have to pay a toll at the Benicia Bridge (I think it's only going North though).  I dislike the I-80 traffic once you hit the Vacaville/Concord areas so I'll head down 5 more and cut over through Tracy/Livermore.  I-205 can get plugged up in the mornings when everyone and their mother is coming into the Bay Area so avoid it at that time during the weekday.

But, they're also one lane so if you run into a truck or RV you'll have to wait to pass.  Also, Google Maps is your friend. I'd suggest running navigation on your phone because once you hit Sacramento there are multiple ways to get there, and traffic will change between the time you leave Reno and get there (Sacramento). It'll reroute you the quickest way. That 10 minute difference between 680 and I-5 can and will change."

Reno,36jmib,DesertEagleFiveOh,14,Sat May 23 23:47:10 2015 UTC,I always suspected that place was a front for laundering money.    Nobody was ever in there. Nobody was ever in the parking lot. It was open for decades. The food was shit. Dirty as hell on the inside.     Recipe for criminal activity.

Reno,36jmib,mymymichael,3,Tue May 19 21:56:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's unfortunate that Reno has one less dining option, and one small business owner has closed shop. However, it's long overdue in my opinion. I went there a handful of times when I lived nearby, and I was never satisfied with my meal, the atmosphere, or anything really. That place has a lot of potential. And I can't imagine that is a bad location.   Make it a second location for Gold N Silver. That seems like the type of place that would take advantage of that building."

If you're a fast drinker though, just walk around to find another bar."
Reno,36b7c1,farmerjane,1 point,Mon May 18 00:40:57 2015 UTC,Most bars will want you to put in $20 but ask the bartender if they give free drinks while you gamble and she will tell you the house rules. Just keep your $20 in the machine and bet .25 when the bartender comes around. Tip your bartender a dollar for each drink and 10% if you hit a jackpot. Have fun.

""You stated that Isis was created because we don't have enough presence and we've been pulling out of the Middle East,"" Ziedrich said, shifting blame instead on to the consequences of George W Bush's invasion of Iraq.  Should Bush declare his candidacy as expected, Ziedrich's question is probably a foreshadowing of one of the former governor's greatest challenges: the deep disillusionment and simmering anger of many Democrats and Republicans surrounding the invasion and occupation of Iraq, which seems inextricably tied to the Bush name.

TMCC supports constitutionally protected freedom of speech and peaceful assembly rights and has established a public forum area at the Dandini Campus for use by TMCC students, employees and outside entities for this purpose.   People who wish to assemble need to register with our scheduling office. The scheduling office then alerts the proper entities on campus (eg. Police, SGA, Public Information, etc.) so that we're all aware of what's going on and can field the inevitable complaint calls that come in.

Simply by being witness to the consequences of military actions or agendas. If the US never stepped in to the region to wipe out one group of enemies, the new group (ISIS) would have never stepped in to fill the vacuum. This happens with the Drug Cartels....every time one Dominant Cartel is wiped out, a new and much more violent Cartel steps in to fill the vacuum. As long as there is consumer demand, there will be cartels.   As long as there will be religious fanatics.....there will be religious terrorists, terrorists using the guise of religion to further conquest and violence, and 'neutral' countries or money interestes manipulating and exploiting the War Money Machine.

It's true.  That happened.    And it is relevant because Jed has stated that he would also have invaded Iraq, if it was his to do over.    Because someone is younger, doesn't mean they have no historical context or perspective.

The whole point of education is that children are tooled with the knowledge and skills to enter the world prepared, and hopefully motivated and knowledgable enough to work at making the world a better place.   Because places like the Middle East exist......by proxy, people are therein motivated to discuss, work at, and fight for a 'Utopian Dream of Peace and Love'.   You are not a person that supports 'freedom', or the good fight. Why would you despise a person for wanting a better world? Their goals may not be realistic, however if people like them did not exist.....the whole World would be a 'Middle East'."

Reno,35vrpk,pokermatt,8,Thu May 14 07:05:10 2015 UTC,"You do not support freedom by discouraging the very act of her practicing it. Being a former Marine does not excuse you from the consequences of making irrational assumptions and dismissive criticism where it is not warranted.  If she was using her hard-won freedom for shit like KKK rallies, or hate-speech, or hating on Homosexuals or Immigrants, then I would tend to side with you about her abusing her Freedom of Speech.  However she is discussing real-world issues. She is using her Freedom of Speech by actively pursuing and fighting for ""utopian dreams of peace and love"".  Do not assume, simply because you were stationed in bad places, and were supposedly 'fighting the good fight'.....that you were actually 'fighting the good fight'.   I have seen first-hand, the consequences of the United States inserting military influence into countries like Guatemala, or El Salvador....with the intention of removing democratically elected governments with CIA or US Special Forces-trained Military regimes.  The US has funded and organized completely false propaganda to destabilize countries....inserting Special Forces to train their Puppet Military to perfect a coup. These Military Regimes were infamous for Death Squads, and massacring tens, to hundreds of thousands of innocent people.   And for what? In Guatemala... Because the Big Money wanted the profits of the banana market Guatemala refused to sell out to US interests. So a Fruit Company.....conspired with the CIA, which directed the Special Forces, and all you good boys that follow orders perfectly.....into overthrowing a stable and completely democratic government.....killing hundreds of thousands of innocent people....for the sake of fucking greed. But I am sure those US military Ops thought they were fighting against communism, right? Just like their puppet masters told them?    Using your veteran record to dismiss or invalidate her benign opinions and peaceful goals...simply because you are older than her....is pathetic. I have a 56 year old Stepfather that is truly the scum of the Earth...he exploited my Grandmother financially for decades, to support a meth addication. He discarded my mother, who was crippled with MS....once he was cut off from my Grandmother.  Does his age automatically make his character better? Does his 'seniority' grant him a 'get out of dickhead jail/Free Pass!' card? Does his title as my stepfather obligate me to submit to his criminal behavior?  No one gives a shit when you served, stop assuming because she is young, that her opinion or goals are less than yours. You are simply proving that you are far lower than her.  As for your attempting to stipulate that serving for the US, and being involved in the Middle East.....somehow makes you the authority on what people should think and do about every where else in the World.....you are mistaken. You continue to attempt to assert your will, and your perspective onto others, how is that working for you? This world does not consist of only you and your ego. You and your opinion, just like mine, are only a very tiny part in a huge network of consciousness and interconnecting threads of life. Try empathizing for once, this is the only way you will come close to understanding and even influencing others."
Reno,35vrpk,jrwreno,0,Thu May 14 08:01:41 2015 UTC,"Whether or not it's her own unique argument is irrelevant, there is the view that the Iraq war severely destabilized the region and that's pretty clear to every one, it's not really a controversial point of view even in conservative circles.  Going a step further and saying that ISIS is a product of that isn't much of a stretch and of course is something that's been said by many.  It's plain that the conditions for the emergence of ISIS were wrought in the chaos of the war, plain even to someone who was a child when the war was taking place, someone who's now an adult studying political science.  She definitely has a valid point of view just as you or I can have a valid point of view on whatever analyses on the French American War or Boer War or WWI etc.  Let her go in the Middle East, right into the ""city"", on her own and see how she likes her freedom of speech there?  What is the logical imperative that is supposed to follow from this statement?  That free speech is the purview of the spoiled and she doesn't know how good she has it?  Are you saying that she shouldn't be allowed to say these things?  Sounds like maybe you ought to go over there, maybe that way of thinking is more aligned to your own: angry, probably single, sexless male hell bent on punishing young women who dare speak out to power with which they disagree.  You'd fit right in, grow a little shabby beard and get yourself a robe you never wash and throw rocks at little girls."
Reno,35vrpk,bangsecks,-7,Thu May 14 04:54:25 2015 UTC,"Nice try.  I served in the Marine Corps in the Middle East and I'll tell you something about the region and the culture...they have it better now than they ever did.  Until the idiots decided that following a made up diety created by an illiterate merchant who saw an angel in a cave, they had science, astronomy, medicine, mathematics, art and a growing culture.  Today, you have westernized Persians, Kurds, Shia, Sunni, Palestinians and other nationalities, christians, jews, sects of islam and non-believers trying to pursue the dreams of modern society.  They are in a struggle against the illiterate slaves of islam and its perversions brought on by mullahs, ayatollahs and the rest of the power hungry despots and gangs (ISIS, etc).  I'm all for people being allowed to say things, yet being this girl being 19 and having not even set foot in that part of the world vs. someone like myself who WAS 19 in the Middle East when I traveled there...might have some validity."
Reno,35vrpk,pokermatt,2,Thu May 14 07:15:20 2015 UTC,"I've been to the Middle East too, I didn't have the United States military holding my hand the whole time either, so that doesn't make you special or more qualified to speak about those things than anyone else.  I've actually been all over the world, all over Asia, Latin America, North America, Africa/Middle East, Europe, Oceania, living for years at a time in many places; if that's how you decide who has place to speak then maybe I'm more qualified to talk about this planet than you (probably, I don't know you).  Is that the case?  Of course not, anyone can learn about different places the world over without having been there personally, that's in fact the main benefit of writing and history, we don't have to have been there to know something about it.  Case in point, I have an Iranian friend here Reno who came to the US as an adult in 2001, and he knows way more about US history than most Americans.  He didn't grow up here, he only came to the US when he was like 20 years old or something, but reading about the US while in Iran and educating himself meant he was able to learn much about this place before having ever come here.  It's just ridiculous to say because you're not somewhere physically you can't be informed about it.  You say that before Islam there was science, mathematics, medicine, etc. in that part of the world (they had those things after as well, their golden age was the height of those things which took place after that illiterate merchant had his hallucination in his cave) and today there are modern, Westernized members of those societies struggling against those radical fundamentalist elements; did you personally see that region go from a bastion of learning and arts to an intellectual dark ages to then centuries later sprout middle classes who strive to live in the modern era?  How can you know these things if you weren't there to see the whole thing transpire?  Because you were there as a 19 year old kid with a bunch of other 19 year old kids?  Were you able to do research and reflect on the society and its culture and history during that time or were you probably more concerned with your military objectives and staying alive?  You were there when the war started or shortly thereafter I'm assuming?  You probably haven't been there since the advent of the ISIS phenomenon so employing your logic there's no way you can know what's going on there with regard to the post war conditions either.  So what's your point?  She doesn't know, but neither do you.  Or maybe any interested party can read and learn about these things from afar and develop a sense of what's happening.  There are sizable middle classes in these countries who are modernized and educated and who do struggle against the illiterate slaves of this barbaric theology, and in some places they do have it better than their ancestors (who doesn't in this world) and really that's the whole point of what this student was saying, for as terrible as dictatorships in the region are, some are quite secular and when they're removed those basest religious elements get out of hand, take over and send the region back to the stone age, ISIS now in Iraq and Syria, Taliban decades before in Afghanistan.  Who can dispute this is happening now?  Did you ever go to Iraq before the war, during the Saddam period?  That was in many ways a modern, Westernized society, much like Egypt or Jordan, contrast that with parts of Iraq today where mobs of young men decapitate people for trivialities.  It's worse.  Your real argument should be whether or not not going into Iraq would have meant a worse outcome than ISIS, that ISIS is part of the aftermath is apparent, blaming Bush personally is rhetorical flare (clearly the Iraq War wasn't his personal design, it's part of a larger policy the West generally has undertaken to secure resources and maintain its prominent place in the world order, that too can be debated, but that's a view many hold, myself included) and there is a mature argument to be had about what not going into Iraq would have meant, that that religion is so bad that it must be contained, the Huntington, Hitchens et al. worldview, and maybe there's something to that, but just saying this person can't say this because she's a kid who hasn't been there is no kind of argument."

Plus they are the cheapest place to get a smog ($10) with the coupon on their website http://www.renocarrepair.com  Meineke on West 4th botched up a simple job and destroyed a lot of things in the process.

I Asked my friend to ride around in it a bit, did a ""bounce test"", and sure enough 3/4 of the corners failed the bounce test.  Seeing as how they weren't pulling my leg, may as well go do it at les schwab. How much is such a thing (replacing shocks/struts) supposed to cost around here?

The place was empty, food took outrageously long, and service was terrible. We got the poutine which was good, but the wings were bland. We ordered 2 other apps, a sausage dish and something else. At this point it was 40 minutes or so past ordering them, the first 2 apps were done and we were just ready to go. As we were telling the waitress to cancel the other two apps and give us the bill so we can get out of there, I saw them arrive at the pass. The food sat there for nearly 5 minutes getting cold before the waitress mentioned to them we wished to cancel them and just get the bill. They decided to comp the 2 items and give it to us togo while apologizing for the service. We didn't even want to bother with it and ended up giving it to a homeless man on our walk back downtown. I can forgive long wait times if the place is slammed and the staff seems like they care, but when the place is empty it's hard for there to be a excuse."

Reno,350p0u,aSfSchwing,1 point,Wed May 6 20:17:44 2015 UTC,"Yup.  I do this every time my rate goes up again.  Just call in and say you're switching to AT&T because it's cheaper, they'll put you on hold and then come back with an offer on a lower rate.  Just make sure you CALL to do this, the people at the actual store give no fucks and will cancel your service without trying to lower your rate first."
Reno,350p0u,cybaritic,1 point,Wed May 6 20:18:46 2015 UTC,I'm planning on playing charter and at&t against each other once my introductory rate is done. Pretty sure those are our only choices without setting up a phone line.
Reno,350p0u,NoeJose,1 point,Wed May 6 13:00:44 2015 UTC,"Work up the ladder, and if you have time, research an EECB for Charter. The following link is pretty old but it gives you the idea, email the right people and someone usually takes up your cause.  http://consumerist.com/2008/09/11/send-charter-an-eecb/  When I was working for Bright House in Florida, outside of the -front- line CSRs (I worked behind the scenes with network/system outages), most people could override ANYTHING and put you on an existing promo price. Charter just seems to be one company that puts up a decent fight and doesn't roll over right away.   I'm still on the $49.99 one for now, up from the $29.99 that ended after a year with them. They are still the fastest game in town :/"

As for money, Uber being valued in the billions easily trumps any cab companies here locally, but add them all up across the country and they definitely have a big fight.  Here in NV, Las Vegas is the big target for them, but I think Reno could benefit from either company getting the green light here."

I don't remember how much it was (this was 4 years ago) but I think The package I bought got me 4 hours of on the road driving with the instructor and then 2 hours with a driving simulator thing at their office in Sparks...   I passed my driving test with a perfect score so I think it was worth it.   Just checked their website and a 6 hour driving instruction package for an adult is $342...
Reno,34s0se,analhurtsmmmkay,2,Mon May 4 02:01:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll take a look! Although I was hoping to find somewhere a bit more affordable than $60/hr."
Reno,34s0se,analhurtsmmmkay,3,Mon May 4 02:16:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think they've raised their prices since I was there.   Um I'll teach you for like 15 bucks an hour.   I guess part of what you're paying for is using the instructors car and they have a steering wheel and brakes (or maybe just brakes, I cant remember) on their side so that if you fuck up bad they can take control of the car. Also they probably have crazy insurance costs.   Good luck!"
Reno,34s0se,analhurtsmmmkay,1 point,Mon May 4 02:32:37 2015 UTC,"15 bucks an hour? That sounds more reasonable, I'm quite tempted! Although I don't actually have access to a ride at the moment (that's something else I'm looking into buying), would that be a problem?"

Reno,34jx8z,depress69,3,Sat May 2 05:13:00 2015 UTC,"Uhhh... I have no idea what WitBeer / VoidRayBeach are on about. They seem to be describing people who are trying to become professional boxers, and it sounds like you'd just like to learn the sport and enjoy it for what it is.  If I'm right, check out Elite Boxing off Mill Street. It's across the street from the GSR and is a very welcome open environment. There are great classes there that run 4x a day (3x on Friday and 1x on Saturday) and are extremely friendly to beginners. I've myself been a member for years now and have had friends lose over 100 pounds just attending classes each night.   If you decide you'd like to take it a step further and not just hit a bag, there are spar nights where they will either find someone who won't murder you, or get a trainer in to get you experience in the ring.   As far as it being a 'bro' setting, the people that go there are from many backgrounds so yeah there are serious fighters there, but also very casual people who are just trying to get fit and enjoy the sport. The main trainer Ashley is very smart when she teaches people and definitely puts the whole 'bro' atmosphere that may be synonymous with a boxing gym aside.   I believe they'll do the first class for free, they should lend you a pair of wraps & gloves to give it a shot and even if not I can't imagine them charging more than $20. I recommend that you show up 15 minutes beforehand so that you can warm up with jump rope, a bike, or a treadmill. It's also good cause then they can get you to sign waivers / gear up before the actual class begins.  Let me know if you have any more questions about it if you'd like to know!"
Reno,34jx8z,depress69,1 point,Fri May 1 21:23:57 2015 UTC,Thank you! That is definitely what I was looking for and I imagined there are people who train others for the purpose of the spirit of the sport and enjoyment rather than solely specific training. I will definitely check them out!

Reno,34jx8z,VoidRayBeach,-2,Sat May 2 05:12:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly what WitBeer said. Now if you want to take the more intense route with actual fighting skills being taught to you. Join KICK BOXING.  Normal gloved boxing is hardly real fighting and it teaches you to be a boxer, not a fighter. I mean sure anyone can learn tactics but boxing is about making money, not fighting."

I tried cinnamon powder and oil and it kinda worked but the ants kept coming back. I didn't want to use chemicals because I have a 9month old and didn't want him around that.   So after some googling wecame up with diatomaceous earth. It is completely safe for humans and animals to ingest, it is a little messy because it is basically super fine dust that cuts up the ants. (I guess)   But after ONE sprinkling  along the walls of the apartment and the outside, wherever we've noticed ants, they haven't been back.   You can get it at gardening and hardware stores.

I have also stopped out by USA Parkway to try and see one of the comets recently.  Of course the further east you go the better the viewing will be if you want to see fainter and fainter objects. Pyramid lake at night is pretty dark all around and then if you go further north east near Nixon/Empire/Gerlach and on the Black Rock Desert it has really good star gazing. Just stay off the black rock right after or while it is raining. I have seen the playa stop big 4x4s in their tracks.

Reno,34dxe9,hairylunch,2,Thu Apr 30 19:30:31 2015 UTC,"Zhajiangmian:       Zhajiangmian (Traditional Chinese:炸醬麵, Simplified Chinese:炸酱面. Literally ""fried sauce noodles"") is a Chinese dish consisting of thick wheat noodles topped with a mixture of ground pork stir-fried with zhajiang (炸醬), which is salty fermented soybean paste.  In Beijing cuisine, yellow soybean paste (黃醬) is used, while in Tianjin and other parts of China tianmianjiang (甜麵醬), hoisin sauce (海鮮醬), or broad (fava) bean sauce (荳瓣醬) may be used in place of the yellow soybean paste. Soy sauce can also be used instead of the soybean paste. Simplified Chinese:(炸酱) also means fried sauce, as the sauce itself is fried, although this homonym does not carry over into the Traditional Chinese term which describes the actual bean paste.  A version suitable for vegans may be made with finely diced (熏豆腐干)(extra firm smoked tofu),(黄豆)edamame, or (素鸡)(extra firm tofu) instead of ground beef or pork. Lacto-ovo vegetarian versions may use chopped omelette alongside or in lieu of extra firm tofu or edamame.

Reno,3498fh,prelimar,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:45:28 2015 UTC,Sprouts is a competitor to Whole Foods as far as size and selection.    Trader Joes is too small & runs out of items continuously.   Natural grocers is more expensive and focused on supplements.  Food Co-op I've never been to.

Reno,347sj6,xbyzk,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:07:52 2015 UTC,"The management is pretty bad, as is the maintenance. Any time I need work to my apartment done I have to ask four or five times, and usually end up just doing the shit myself. My door frame is falling apart, the stairs are cracked and should have been replaced years ago. The light next to my door was out for four months before being fixed. The only time they have ever come to my apartment for repairs they did at 8am, unannounced, and it was because the person below me thought my toilet was leaking water into their bathroom. (It wasn't.) What else...last month they turned the water off for a few hours without saying anything to the tenants.   If anything happens it's always at 8am. That's when they come by with the lawn mowers, weed wackers, and leaf blowers because the dirt in the parking lot is more important than cleaning things like all the dog shit in the grass in front of my building. The interior of these apartments seem almost thirty years old, and to top everything off, they just raised the rent $20 on two bedrooms and $40 on one bedrooms.  It's also dangerous. The UPS hub I work at instructs us not to leave boxes at your door or the office because the crime rate inside the complex is so high. The first thing my neighbor told me when I moved in was to move all my shit off my deck because the unit below mine was robbed a week before I moved in.  The only reason to ever consider living here is the location. Beside that, fuck this piece of shit complex."

Reno,347o13,SirSexy,3,Tue Apr 28 23:16:59 2015 UTC,"What kind of atmosphere are you looking for?   Here's my very limited impression of some of the types of clubs we have here:  Lex, Edge, Aura (in casino clubs)- your traditional club-type atmoshpere.  Lots of people who want to be seen.  Music is usually pretty mainstream top 40 stuff, guys in button up shirts, ladies in tight dresses and heels.   There's usually a cover to these clubs.  Downtown bars that have dancing:  1up, Tonic, Monolith, 5 Star.  This is where I like to go dancing.  1up is mostly bass EDM, Tonic is EDM but leans more towards house music, Monolith is all over the place so it's good to see what's happening, could be a live band, could be DJs, could just be a bar.   5-star is a gay bar that has a great fun atmosphere and dancing-more mainstream music. Usually not a cover, but will have a cover for certain shows, but I've never paid more than $15 for a show at these places (and that was for an EDM group who is pretty well known).  Other fun places downtown-  Singers, St. James Infirmary, The Loving Cup-- different things different nights, so you can look at their calendars and see if anything appeals to you.  Overall, I'd suggest going bar hopping with some friends downtown and see which places vibe with you."

Reno,33lyui,beersn0b,9,Thu Apr 23 16:32:29 2015 UTC,"1.) I am a fan of the quality of food and beer at the park. As far as I can tell the prices are pretty reasonable as well, Albeit I haven't really been to many pro-sporting events.  Seeing your screen name: They have a craft beer corner which has craft beers for ~8 bucks a pint (that was  BABA black lager and a sculpin IPA last time we were there)  Also if you want to get some food and drink before the game there is a place that just opened right next to the park called Mellow Fellow (https://www.facebook.com/MellowFellowofReno) they have 40 taps of probably all craft beer and food although I cannot speak to the prices and quality because I haven't made it there yet.  2.) Heckling is a part of baseball, keep it family friendly and be respectful of others. If another patron or a park employee asks you to stop, respect their wishes.  3.) Bring sunscreen if it is a day game, bring a sweater/jacket/blanket if it is an evening game. Fridays are a lot of fun because they shoot off fireworks after the game, it is also a little more crowded but IMO the bigger the crowd the more fun a ball game is."
Reno,33lyui,wartornhero,2,Thu Apr 23 17:16:16 2015 UTC,"Excellent! Thanks for the detail.  On the heckling, of course we'll keep it family friendly, and stop if asked. I'm looking to have a good time, and ruining other's enjoyment is not a good way to do that. Some ballparks/fan bases enjoy a good heckler, while others don't which is why I asked."
Reno,33lyui,wartornhero,2,Thu Apr 23 17:42:32 2015 UTC,"My fiancée and I were there on Monday and there was a pretty good heckler that was making us laugh. There was a joke going around that he wasn't the heckler we deserve, but he was the heckler we needed."
Reno,33lyui,Brocktoberfest,1 point,Thu Apr 23 18:04:24 2015 UTC,"Mellow Fellow has the best tap selection in town.  60% of the beers or so are $5 for varying sized glasses.  The remaining beers are ""premium"" and cost a bit more.  All in all, very reasonably priced for PHENOMENAL beers."
Reno,33lyui,DDT197,6,Thu Apr 23 21:08:45 2015 UTC,Getting General admission tickets and sitting on the grass is a nice way to enjoy the game and the weather while spending a lot less on the tickets. Lots of great places right around the entrance for good food and good beer. Inside has a few pretty good things too but it's pretty standard fare for a pro event.
Reno,33lyui,StopPre182,3,Thu Apr 23 17:39:35 2015 UTC,"In addition to what others have said:  1) Food and beer is pretty typical of small stadiums.  Attached to the stadium is The Freight House District, which has real restaurants with real food overlooking the field. The Freight House District is accessible with or without a ticket, and if you have a ticket you can get in and out of that area without leaving the stadium.  Very cool setup.   2)  I wouldn't say that clean heckling is encouraged or discouraged.  Just keep in mind that this is a minor-league game - at least half the people there aren't really paying attention to the game.  The closer you sit to home plate, the better received any excessive cheering or heckling it's likely to be.     The opposing team's dugout is on the 1st base side.  Also, if you haven't been to many minor league games, keep in mind that the players' friends and family are much more prevalent in a small crowd.  There is no ""wives section"" like you'll see in major league stadiums.  Be mindful of who you're heckling and whether their wives or kids are sitting next to you.   3)  How old are your boys?  The outfield GA berm is great for kids more interested in running around than watching the game. There's a play ground, bounce house, and other games for kids back past CF as well.  Also, get there early and talk to the cheerleaders at the front gate if you want to get your boys on the field for one of those games between innings (depending on their age, of course).   Have fun!"

Reno,33kckv,Formaldehyd3,3,Thu Apr 23 06:40:22 2015 UTC,I think replacing the sign is doing exactly this. When you spend money to update things like this businesses and investors take notice and put money into the area knowing the city it's paying attention and willing to make changes.

Of course the current version makes 3.  At one point, there were neon torches atop the original arch. That may be where the idea comes from that there have been 4."

Does the current arch symbolize everything that Reno is today? Of course not. But why should we ask it to, when we have so many other tools at our disposal to accomplish that? Rather, we need to recognize that as Reno reinvents itself, our city’s rich heritage is one of its most valuable assets. There is no place like it. And its incomparable story, embedded in the landscape in ways we have only begun to tap into, is a key component of the city’s multi-dimensional, excitingly complex, absolutely unique identity."""

Great Basin is also another good one for solid beer and food.  Are you guys big beer drinkers? Check out Ole Bridge Pub by the water. Lots of good craft beers from all over like firestone, ballast point, lagunitas, dogfish head. I did the Leperchaun pub crawl in March and if I remember right, they weren't on the list of bars so you can avoid the vampire crawl crowd."

Reno,32xqsw,Second_to_None,1 point,Fri Apr 17 19:41:17 2015 UTC,No.  TMWA prints money as it is.  Its time for desalination plants and large pipelines.  Create jobs and save the planet. What it will do to the whales will be a 2100's problem.
Reno,32xqsw,themosthatedone,3,Sat Apr 18 14:41:02 2015 UTC,"Desalination is one of the most important challenges we face today. There are a number of solutions available but they aren't scalable or financially viable just yet. Take, for instance, the city of New York, who goes through 1 Billion gallons each day. Desalination on that scale isn't possible yet. We in our lab believe there is promise for using nafion filters on a massive scale, problem is, those filters are $1,000/meter and have a low efficiency. There is other interest in using ultra-fine mesh screens and high pressure pumps to force the salt out of water, but I don't know how well that'll work out on a large scale.  I suppose the moral of the story is that the technology isn't there just yet. Our best bet is to get more interest in these pursuits, drive more money to these projects, and inspire the future generations to work towards the goal of large scale desalination."
Reno,32xqsw,Luminescence9,1 point,Sun Apr 19 10:15:29 2015 UTC,"The moral of the story is that we need to focus our money and efforts on desalination rather than agencies to enforce water restrictions.  Billion dollar industry, and r&d isn't getting dick.  'Merica"

Reno,32w6p3,koberstein,2,Fri Apr 17 07:06:24 2015 UTC,I think the trend will continue.  I was in the same boat as you last summer.  I kept putting in offers on homes in the 150k range only to be beaten by offers 10-20k above asking price.  I ended up widening my search and moving to Sparks by Rock and Oddie.  I am quite happy with my decision.  There are some cool affordable older houses around here.
Reno,32w6p3,Mavsma,1 point,Fri Apr 17 06:08:09 2015 UTC,So I didn't start looking into Sparks much until recently and homes are starting to move just as fast there too. I really should have looked sooner but I was being a snob and wanted to stay in midtown. Of course there is NOTHING within my price range here.
Reno,32w6p3,koberstein,2,Fri Apr 17 06:19:21 2015 UTC,Hasn't been anything in Midtown or Old Southwest in that price range for the last several years.  Which is crazy because most of them are old and in dire need of repairs/upgrades.

Reno,32w6p3,koberstein,1 point,Fri Apr 17 06:53:11 2015 UTC,3 years ago I almost purchased a house on Humboldt.  Beautiful but crumbling 2100 square foot brick with full basement.  It was listed at 175k and sold for 182k.  I didn't put an offer in because while it was in a great location it needed tons of work.  Out of curiosity I looked it up and it's valued at nearly 300k now.
Reno,32w6p3,rodgers929,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:44:17 2015 UTC,"Also, if we are able to buy it will most likely be with an fha loan. We have some money saved but if we're buying an older fixer upper (which is the likely scenario) we want to have some extra cash on hand. So I feel like we're at even more of a disadvantage going that route."
Reno,32w6p3,popnwave,1 point,Fri Apr 17 06:27:04 2015 UTC,"Well, one perk is that FHA requires less down payment.  You can hopefully refinance at a later time to a standard mortgage and rid yourself of the PMI.  That is what I am planning on doing.  As long as the place is liveable you can make the most of it and take your time with fixin it up.  But, damn, I gotta say... as soon as you move in you are going to instinctively want to make so many changes.  I thought my place was fine as is during the walk throughs but sure enough, I am obsessed with improving it.  The home improvement itch is tough to not scratch haha."
Reno,32w6p3,TheAsgards,2,Fri Apr 17 06:58:24 2015 UTC,We looked for almost two months.  After numerous offers being turned down we finally got an offer accepted and we are going to close next week.  Don't give up hope and keep looking.  You will eventually find something.

Reno,32qb6u,k2nsf,2,Wed Apr 15 21:20:35 2015 UTC,"I see lots of negativity and half-assed assumptions from noticeably angry people. They aren't ""taking advantage"" of local government, Reno beat out all other bidders for the contract. That's just how business works. Elon Musk is actually a very progressive business owner, and I'm not surprised at the news that he will be paying more-than-competitive wages. Now, as long as all the scumbag temp agencies keep THEIR nasty little hands out of it, we may get some good jobs out here in the Reno area."
Reno,32qb6u,elzombino,3,Thu Apr 16 19:08:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with your sentiment that there's an inordinate level of negativity here. I'm glad that Tesla is locating their factory here, and I'm sure it will be a net win for the area, even after the billion dollar tax break.    However, the idea that a state/local government should ""bid"" on a new factory, or that they should even have the power to treat one business differently than another is ridiculous to me.  How is that equal treatment before the law?  Why help a big, established, out-of-state corporation at a higher level than a new local business?  It seems to me that if an agreeable tax climate will attract growth, development, employment, etc from Tesla, we should just make that the law of the land for everyone, and attract economic diverse growth without prejudice."

Reno,32qb6u,haroldp,0,Thu Apr 16 20:42:30 2015 UTC,"that happened already. people moving to reno was the boom last decade. then everyone left when there were no decent paying jobs, hence the bust. why does it matter if they're from out of state? if they were from reno, then you'd be ok with the tax breaks? that's silly. that's exactly the kind of small-town mentality that keeps reno in a rut. it's like everyone thinks it's the end of the world if a few californians move in."
Reno,32qb6u,WitBeer,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:53:30 2015 UTC,"You seem to have misconstrued each point I have made.  I will try again:     Uneven taxation and regulation sucks.  We should all be equals before the law, regardless of company size, origin, or the amount of mindshare they have this year.  This seems like a fundamental value of a free society. If we believe that making it easier for Tesla to do business here will have positive consequences for our state, why don't we extend that to anyone who wants to do business here, including and especially new local businesses?"
Reno,32qb6u,haroldp,0,Thu Apr 16 21:38:00 2015 UTC,"that's an ideal scenario that just doesn't exist and never will. no society, country, or city does anything remotely close to that. we can argue about whether or not that should happen, but it's irrelevant.  that is the scenario for just about any company (that shows promise or current success). there is nothing special about tesla. other states have similar deals for toyota, petco, and hundreds of other companies. if you bring a company willing to employees hundreds or thousands of people, then there is a lineup of states that will cut you a break. nevada should be involved in that as heavily as they can, until such time as they can provide enough incentive to attract companies without those tax breaks (like silicon valley)."

No big companies using their money and influence to skew things in their favor?

The mines have paved the way eliminating environmental regulations, where any other state would have a significant lobbying process to get it done.  Lithium mining and manufacturing is a dirty process, and most states wouldn't let it go down.  Tesla may not ever end up there.  The gigafactory isn't even primarily owned by Tesla.  Never have I heard it mentioned in the media that Panasonic is...  As far as wages:  producing lithium batteries is very expensive in China.  How on earth will they be able to be competitive paying 25$/hour?  Oh, and if it does ever open, they will use hiring services.  Take apple for example.  I  am very skeptical, as the the real purpose of this building.  None of it makes sense.  They could be using the construction as a giant tax loophole where they are avoiding more in taxes than they are paying to build.  I don't know exactly, but it stinks."

Reno,32qb6u,ElkoJoe,2,Thu Apr 16 15:07:47 2015 UTC,"It's true that it's a tech company, but you have to temper this with the fact that this is a manufacturing facility - the highly rewarded employees in tech are generally the engineers, not the folks assembling the hardware (in this case the batteries).  You also don't require the best and the brightest, even for skilled manufacturing.    As for the wage question, this manufacturing plant is likely comparable to the large Chinese manufacturing plants where most consumer electronics are made - lots of high tech, including high end smart phones and tablets, but the folks on the line aren't the ones making the big bucks.  Admittedly, it's hard to compare US workers/wages to Chinese equivalents.  A better comparison might be to the auto industry, where workers make around $30 an hour before benefits (and likely comparable amounts at non-union shops like Toyota).  $25 an hour for skilled manufacturing isn't high, and Tesla will likely offer a ""competitive"" benefits package."
Reno,32qb6u,hairylunch,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:57:25 2015 UTC,They started like that at the state-subsidized Nissan plant in Mississippi.

Don't go there. I can't recommend a mechanic but I can recommend you not go there

Reno,31rv2p,xJoeskeez,5,Tue Apr 7 20:32:34 2015 UTC,A couple of years ago a bartender snuck onto the roof and jumped.. He had some depression issues.. I guess it was just a bad joke about him diving.. He landed on the sidewalk between the pool fence and port of subs old location. really kind of sad.. After that they tightened up access to the roof for non essential reasons.

This place is as friendly and unpretentious as it gets. Prior to brewchatter opening I would get all my equipment and supplies from the Internet, however these guys have more than earned my business in the past year.  Look on Facebook for High Desert Brewgade (highdesertbrewgade.com). It's a new-ish local group that gets together once a month to share beer and talk about homebrewing.

I got lazy and figured I would treat it like an experiment, on last taste soured a little bit.   Looks to be there are quite a few of us.  I was a member of WZZ first, then I kind of stopped with them and hung out with the IMBIB crowd, not as many meetings, WZZ was much better about meetings. Hopefully IMBIB gets going a little more after the brewery comes up sometime soon.  We should see about getting a meetup together. I am slammed this weekend. Next weekend I will be out and about for the start of craft beer week. Will be at the Discovery Museum event and the Drinkable Reno Bus Tour."

Reno,30vyio,AbsolutelyPink,5,Tue Mar 31 21:15:52 2015 UTC,"Get yourself (if you dont already have) a long lens. I shoot all my street with the 70-200, 2.8. That gets you out of their faces, and in my opinion, the longer the lens, the better the photo. I typically will bring the camera up to my face while pointing it slightly away from my actual subject. With my non-viewfinder eye, I will watch to see if they noticed my movement. If not, I turn and shoot. If they did, then I pretend I wasnt even going to take their picture, and I dont. I feel that the shot is compromised if they notice. Lastly, Youre going to get caught. Most people will give you a look and not say anything. Some people will approach you. Just be respectful, mention why you are shooting, and carry on. Few people will make a scene and harass you/call the cops. Know your rights. http://www.krages.com/ThePhotographersRight.pdf"

I think a couple of the shots would have been much better if shot in color such as the larger lady crossing the street. She was covered in tons of stuff, probably many colors but in B&W she is just kinda a blob of gray and black.   What kinda camera do you shoot with?"
Reno,30vyio,_busch,1 point,Tue Mar 31 04:55:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the input. I really like your point ""I was wondering is there more to the picture than just being a black and white picture."" That's something I'm going to ask myself before every picture from now on. There usually is something more at the time i take it, i think about patterns, repetition, emotion, etc. but you're right in that a lot of them could benefit from more color (again I'm too much of a sucker for black and white.)   I shoot with a Canon SL1, 50mm f/1.8 (usually set between 2.8-5) prime lens. I have a battery grip for faster portrait shots. Right now I need to work on zone focusing and composing color I think.

However I do agree with you that Reno people tend to like guns. I think concealed carry is a bigger deal than open carry. People do enjoy going to the mountains and shooting at stuff, though they are pretty mindful of where they are and are not allowed to shoot. It's been my experience that on this issue, people who can get through the day without getting freaking out about either ""I'm surrounded by these idiots and they're armed!"" or ""The #($@$ libruls are tryin' to take my guns!"", which is to say, if you are a well-adjusted member of society, then you should do fine. YMMV, I suppose. As for the downvotes, I didn't downvote you but your statement reads to me like I can almost hear you pumping your shotgun at the end of it. And glowering menacingly.

I just went two weekends ago with the family. I recommend MV Winery, Salutti Cellars, Latcham, Windwalker, and Cantiga from there.

Also because if it's your first time up there you can get lost pretty easily if your not careful. The view is very scenic especially at night because you can see all of Reno from up there. Make sure you're always on the lookout for sidewall shredders up there because there are lots of exposed rocks that will pop your tires sidewall.

I have purchased several firearms from gun shows and all have been through an FFL (dealer). I don't recall ever talking to a non FFL at a gun show, but I would assume there are some. At a large show like at the GSR, its gonna be all FFL.   Why? Imagine I am a private seller, I bought all my guns near retail. I go to a show and are now competing with guys who are getting them at near half price and can get what ever I want. It's gonna be a lonely day.

Reno,2zu6h7,SickSalamander,1 point,Sat Mar 21 21:28:55 2015 UTC,Maybe a little off topic but arent some long guns and handguns chambered the same? So you could say its for a long gun but its really for a handgun?
Reno,2zu6h7,wartornhero,1 point,Sat Mar 21 22:47:39 2015 UTC,"Not really. I mean unless you're getting like a .22 or something (which is not ideal for self defense), most handgun ammunition is pretty much exclusive to handguns. There's some exceptions like the beretta storm (rifle that is chambered in 9mm), but you still need to be 21 to purchase 9mm, since it's primarily handgun ammo.   If you're getting a firearm for self defense, I'd highly recommend a shotgun. Get a short barrel Remington 870 or mossberg 500 or something."

But I think the pro legalization crown needs to tale a look at its arguments, because some of them are pretty weak. Now this is free strategy advice, this shit is supposed to cost a pretty penny, but here it goes.    The ""too many people are being incarcerated for this crime,"" argument that shares a lot in common with the ""everybody is doing it anyway"" argument is weak. Just because tons of people break a law doesn't mean it shouldn't be a law. The other argument that needs to go is the alcohol comparison. Its really just an argument for another alcohol prohibition, ""this legal thing is worse than my illegal thing so my thing should be legal,"" is a logical fallacy.     But none of this really matters because its going to the ballot. I would still take a look at the pro legalization platform because you still need to convince voters."
Reno,2zg1at,SupremeNeckProtector,4,Thu Mar 19 05:12:01 2015 UTC,"Turning something that isn't inherently wrong into a crime that a sizable % of the population will commit, will turn a sizable % of the population into criminals. That's bad for society.  We saw with alcohol prohibition, that it didn't work, and that its only consequences were unintended negative ones. We are seeing every day with marijuana prohibition that it doesn't work, and its only consequences are unintended negative ones.  It is not illogical to deduce from past experience that current policy is causing the same negative externalities that a past experiment caused, and the best course of action would be to end the experiment, as was done previously. Marijuana prohibition needlessly exposes non-criminals to the criminal lifestyle. In many cases, it brands for life many people who didn't hurt anyone or damage anything as criminals for life. Prohibition has proven on more than one occasion to be unnecessary, ineffective, and damaging to society and it needs to end. This isn't rocket science."

But until they have been changed, there are many times that laws should be broken.  There are situations where breaking those laws can be an important instrument in getting them changed.    In addition, I have a notion that generally, if the government can not effectively enforce a widely broken law, the courts should be obligated and encouraged to nullify that law.  When there is a law that everyone breaks, it is an invitation to corruption of government and especially the police.  It is a venue for police to express their prejudices via selective enforcement.  It tends to create black markets and mafias.  Unenforceable laws have a horrible effect on society.    Now that wouldn't be the first reason I'd legalize marijuana, but it's definitely on my list, and worth thinking about."

Reno,2zfjiv,FroggiJoy87,3,Wed Mar 18 22:14:44 2015 UTC,"It's better than Greyhound by leaps and bounds.  The bus is two-story with skylights on the upper deck and tables on the lower, free wifi, airplane-style seats (with like twice the legroom), personal overhead lights and air, outlets at nearly every seat, and never seen an un-clean restroom.  Also, because it's not as well known it doesn't get very crowded (or get shady people)   Another nice thing is how fast it is because there arn't as many stops.  I typically take it from Reno to SF and there's only one stop along the way so it really doesn't take much longer than driving."
Reno,2zfjiv,popnwave,2,Thu Mar 19 18:48:02 2015 UTC,Megabus all the way.. used it to go a show back in November.. get into SF around 730-8 and went right to the venue. Then you can head back in the AM and be back in Reno in the early afternoon.  ~$38 RT when I did it in November.. might be cheaper depending on the season/time looking at the cost other people have mentioned.

Reno,2z6q83,lighthouse19635,8,Mon Mar 16 01:40:58 2015 UTC,"Very safe, on time usally and fast. Cheep to boot also. Go to the RTC website for routes and times. Or you can go to google maps and click on a little blue buss symbol on the roads. Might have to zoom in a bit to see them.  A few weeks back my car was out of order. I took one buss 6 mils up mcaren from the mall and I was at work. Always on time too."
Reno,2z6q83,VoidRayBeach,6,Mon Mar 16 02:00:25 2015 UTC,"They're safe, and I guess okay for a city this size, but as someone relegated entirely to the bus system for a few years I have to say it really sucks.  Most buses are so infrequent, one per hour, that if you can't afford to be late then you'd better give yourself two hours to get anywhere.  Very inconvenient.  Reno is pretty small, you could get anywhere by car in at most 15 minutes, but by bus you should budget two hours each way; you'll be waiting around a lot."
Reno,2z6q83,bangsecks,4,Mon Mar 16 17:43:37 2015 UTC,"Buses in Reno are actually pretty damn good. Be careful in the winter because the stops aren't always plowed or iced and the buses can run exceptionally late if the snow is extra heavy, but other than that, I'd say our bus system is pretty darn rad and exceptionally affordable. It's insanely cheap if you happen to be a student.  As for safety, you got a LOT more to worry about from ice in the winter than from people. Most of the individual stops are unlit, but that's generally not a big issue because most of the stops are along well traveled routes, so there's somewhere to wait other than the stop if you're uncomfortable waiting alone. And all the major stops are REALLY well lit and usually staffed. But, to be honest, this is Reno. It's a pretty safe city in general. My wife rode the bus for about 5 years  by her self, often VERY late at night and never even had so much as an unwanted advance. So yeah. I wouldn't be worried."

Reno,2z6q83,DragonDai,4,Mon Mar 16 05:21:55 2015 UTC,Google maps has the RTC bus schedule built in.  Just search for directions and then choose to use public transportation (bus icon).  You can choose to look at specific departure or arrival times to plan your trip.
Reno,2z6q83,dnadude,3,Mon Mar 16 15:21:25 2015 UTC,"super right about the 2 hour time. if your on a bus route that has a bus that only comes around once an hour, its super inconvenient. If your on a more frequent one, and don't have to use the hour ones, its pretty good. I had to plan daily trips from stead to meadowwood mall, and it was a three hour journey. that made my 8 hour shift into a 14 hour day."

Safety wise, they have security at the stations, but on the buses you are on your own. Your biggest worry will be a bus driver getting in an accident whilst being on the bus."
Reno,2z6q83,Valcour,1 point,Mon Mar 16 08:07:21 2015 UTC,Safety hasn't been an issue. I haven't seen a single fight yet. Just a few verbal arguments here and there. If people get too uppity they get thrown off the bus. Usually a single warning from the driver will suffice. There are security guards at all of the RTC facilities. Meadow wood mall has their own security guards that patrol often.  As for routes and timing: http://www.rtcwashoe.com/public-transportation-88 However I'd recommend just biting the bullet and buying a 50 cent booklet from 4th st station's customer service. Its worth it.   Also do take advantage of Next bus. It can give you an estimate of where the bus is and how long until it reaches your stop. https://www.nextbus.com/#!/reno/ There is also an app for it if you have a smart phone.   If you are in town and want to check it out then might i recommend taking advantage of st. patricks day? Free rides from 4pm to midnight. Just keep in mind that there will be more drunk individuals riding that night than usual. Since October to now I've had at most 3 drunk people ride my bus. They happen but they are far and few between because of the security downtown. its usually quiet on the buses.

Look into swamp coolers, they're a slight initial investment but they save boatloads in the long run. Our summer utility bills for a 2 bed apt. are typically in the $70-$85 range and we leave our cooler on all day.   They also have those little ac fans that you can put in your window.

Back when winters used to mean something, I could pay up to $2,000 a winter just for the fuel oil, not to mention the increased electric.  However, if the winters keep staying this mild, you could supplement the oil heat more cost-efficiently with electric space heaters, and just rely on the furnace when you really need to (it's one saving grace is it packs a lot of BTUs)."

We have a newer oil heater and would say it is about the same as gas heat, but you just have to budget for an occasional large bill."
Reno,2yzgsh,Therealdoctor,2,Sat Mar 14 04:26:18 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you are in old SW? Oil heating can be pretty expensive and is not nearly as efficient as gas. If you are comfortable just heating the room you are in space heaters would probably be better. I no longer live in the house that is oil heated, and I have only lived in large houses with oil heat so it might be alittle different but it will be higher than equal heat with gas by quite a bit."

Reno,2yn2xl,climber514d,3,Wed Mar 11 03:35:34 2015 UTC,A lot of gold mines waste a lot of money on poor planning and risky ideas.   Hycroft has been the clear winner in that category for years. They also have been doing lay offs off and on for the past 3 years. So this is no surprise and no indicator of the mining sector.
Reno,2yn2xl,Veadro,1 point,Wed Mar 11 07:06:55 2015 UTC,There will be more. A lot of the smaller mines in North Nevada are completely mismanaged and have only made it this long by duping more and more investors.

Reno,2y9h7n,winterbed,6,Sat Mar 7 18:53:43 2015 UTC,Would it be a totally creepy thing to go with the intention of meeting trans people for something more than support?  I don't know where else to meet trans people here.
Reno,2y9h7n,bangsecks,3,Sun Mar 8 01:18:06 2015 UTC,"Not at all! We welcome people whether they're trans, trans allies, or just looking to meet trans people to get to know them. We do offer trans support, but we also have social gatherings.  You may want to go to the next Trans in Northern Nevada (TINN) meeting at Round Table. That's our monthly social get together."

Reno,2y9h7n,crackhappy,-18,Sun Mar 8 07:00:56 2015 UTC,"I do not embrace the destruction of our society.  While I have love for them as people, I do not support the idea of publicly advertising a place to go meet transvestites.  This isn't a support group for people struggling.  Look above; this is a place for people to meet transvestites.  Would this thread get as much attention if it where a dude posting a meet up for a place to find heterosexual orgies?  Probably not, this is reddit where the idea of embracing homosexuality and socialism = upvotes.  If it is about helping people who struggle, you wouldn't throw it out there in front of the whole world to see."
Reno,2y9h7n,themosthatedone,5,Sun Mar 8 14:18:40 2015 UTC,"Your level of ignorance is not surprising I suppose. I'm sure you have no interest in actually learning anything about what you are vilifying.  You are the sort of person that I have been striving mightily to make sure my children do not turn into.

Reno,2y9h7n,crackhappy,-9,Sun Mar 8 16:59:39 2015 UTC,"Way to insult me to bring about my change in opinion.  Take your kids to the tranny meet up, it will be good for them to experience, and will help them be better productive members of society.  My mind is closed to the idea of demoralizing society just because I seem like an asshole if I don't.  It is definitely my prerogative to not see the destruction of Northern Nevada by the sewage seeping from over the Sierras.  You ""progressives"" already destroyed California.  I'm not going to be fake, or change my opinion because I can't be your friend."

Reno,2y9h7n,InfiniteSandwich,5,Sun Mar 8 17:37:10 2015 UTC,"No, don't have any interest in transvestites. However since my daughter might be transgender I will probably take her to one of those meetups so she can meet people who have realized their genetics and their mind don't match reality.  It will hopefully help her with her depression stemming from persecution from assholes like you."
Reno,2y9h7n,crackhappy,4,Sun Mar 8 17:55:16 2015 UTC,"Hey, I just wanted to say that you're doing a really awesome thing for your daughter.  Educating her about the fluidity of gender will be helpful no matter what she identifies as.  I'm glad you're standing up for her and aren't taking people's shit.  The world needs more parents like you."
Reno,2y9h7n,themosthatedone,3,Tue Mar 10 18:47:22 2015 UTC,Thanks. I just wish I could help her more with the aholes at her school.
Reno,2y9h7n,nokomn,-7,Tue Mar 10 19:44:07 2015 UTC,"Persecution?  You mean like, me not wanting people to advertise a meet up that invites people to come meet transvestites?  Look at the top post.  More exposure doesn't mean a better world for your tranny child.  Deal with that shit like people deal with anything else, and quit imposing it on the rest of society to embrace.  Its not a cry for help, its an attempt to put this on a pedestal.  Why does your child need help accepting who they are?  As a parent, I agree that you should be developing a support system I'd your child is having issues being comfortable with who they are.  A local subreddit probably isn't the best place, because its going to get a lot of posers and people looking to exploit it.  How about just showing mad love to your kids?"
Reno,2y9h7n,you-ole-polecat,5,Sun Mar 8 18:06:03 2015 UTC,"I mean, the thing is, it is a support group.

Reno,2y8smv,PuppyBreath,7,Sat Mar 7 15:06:22 2015 UTC,So your spending $7000 of the $40000 you want for a opening celebration? That sounds very wasteful for a new business to just spend all that money at one time.
Reno,2y8smv,stoopidtrooper,3,Sat Mar 7 18:54:35 2015 UTC,Good point. I'll have to consider changing that.   Ninja edit: $5k will not be allotted to secure partnerships with other small businesses around town. Thank you for pointing that out!
Reno,2y8smv,RenoQuestions,7,Sat Mar 7 19:46:41 2015 UTC,"I think it's great that you have an idea that you want to set in motion, but it doesn't seem fully formed as of yet.   It looks as though this will essentially be a museum with interesting things.  Do you have any curating experience, or will you be consulting with someone that does?   How will this benefit the area in a better way than what the Discovery museum (which is right next door) already does?  They also inspire curiosity, and have a sustainable model where they have an adult night once a month.  It seems to me that the need for curiosity-building in adults is already being met for the community, and I'm not sure how your storefront will add, or, how successful it can realistically be.    What qualifications do you have to open a business that will not inevitably fail? There are no educational or personal insights on your page that show that you might know what your doing, or be worth supporting.    If you are looking for a sustainable business, and not a short-term venture, are you looking for partners, either corporate or private (in a more meaningful way than an anonymous online funding site)?  If you are looking for other sponsors, it would add a level of credibility to your project that is currently lacking.    If you have a business plan, instead of just an idea, I think you should seriously consider posting it on your funding page.  It's difficult to glean much substantial information from what you have already presented."
Reno,2y8smv,Name_change_here,2,Sat Mar 7 22:21:08 2015 UTC,"The idea of a cabinet of curiosities is much less formal than a museum, however you are correct in that it isn't fully formed. I came up with this idea at 4 AM while suffering insomnia.   The Discovery Museum is geared more towards actual scientific discoveries and children. Historically, a cabinet of curiosities or a ""Wunderkammer"" were collections of objects simply meant to inspire wonder  and not necessarily factual. The main difference is that my target age are adults, and to bring back a sense of wonderment into their lives. In other words, this space is not meant for profit, but for fun and inspiration.   Since it's in the first day of the campaign, I'm currently working the business plan together. I got ahead of myself in the wee hours, and lack of sleep. Thanks for your input!"

So Noble Pie does have surveillance but it's been hard to tell on the video who took it- they can get very busy and my painting is very small (6""x""6""). Trevor reached out to me today and gave me more details on what went wrong and what they plan to do better for future security. He apologized more than once and I know he is sincere. They are paying me the full value for the painting. Let me add that art gets stolen and destroyed at even the nicest galleries and museums. Noble Pie has been extremely supportive to local artists and the art scene in Reno. They are a small business doing really great things for our community and are my favorite pizza place in town. We are all hoping the painting will turn up. I so appreciate how much a large part of Reno has come together to help me- I'm grateful to live in such a wonderful place. Thank you everyone!!!"

And here I'd also like to give a special shout out to 3rd Street for all they do.  But getting back on topic. As someone who only learned about your artwork from the posts related to the theft, I'm curious if you do commissions? Not that I can afford one, but I'm also curious as to how much they might cost and how I might procure one? Hypothetically speaking."

Reno,2xucit,TechnoBoozer,-5,Wed Mar 4 05:13:04 2015 UTC,"Whether or not this is an advertisement, Reno is a shit hole.  We have a burgeoning food scene?  Oh great!    In the meantime, the majority of our brightest and most entrepreneurial students will move away from the terrible job market and limited opportunities.  And Reno will put on its blinders and open some trendy thrift stores!  Maybe we don't have to fix our broke-ass state if we can make it look good enough.  I love Reno, but it wasn't until I moved away that I was able to get a great job and actually use my graduate degree.  Where I live now feels like a miracle!  Jobs that require education are constantly available, and tech start-ups abound.  People don't have to write articles about how the town doesn't suck, because the town just doesn't suck."
Reno,2xucit,hardcocklife,5,Wed Mar 4 08:40:54 2015 UTC,"How long ago did you move away. The start-up scene is picking up (along with the foodie scene) The Reno Collective and start up row now house several businesses that are starting up and most sound like they are planning to stay in the area. Breweries and distilleries are starting up as well to supplement the foodie scene. The legislature may actually go through and release restrictions on wineries and craft beer. If that goes through we could see a bigger boom in the craft alcohol industry not only in northern nevada but also other parts as well.  Tesla has already dragged a few tech companies who were thinking to move to finally make the final push and pull the trigger on moving into Northern Nevada. Other stuff like FAA permission to run and test commercial drones, the direct to customer car sales are good things for nevada and if the legislature can keep the pace Nevada will no longer be the place where california dreams go to die.  I may find Mark Estee's restaurants overrated and overpriced (with the exception of provisions, really like that place and the price is agreeable) but he is really doing doing some awesome work to foster the ""Local, Local, Local"" mentality that is spurring a bunch of growth."

Reno,2x7pfy,lighthouse19635,2,Thu Feb 26 08:03:36 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I don't really know the person anymore and can't refer you to him, but I did meet someone who got both the BS and then a masters in info systems at UNR and was in quite a good position in terms of employment.  If you look at the curriculum though you'll notice it's not all that IT or networking heavy and most of the classes are business, which I find kind of weird.  Unfortunately, TMCC got rid of their networking AA, so it's either the Information Systems at UNR or a CSE degree and then go into IT yourself, which is doable."
Reno,2x7pfy,bangsecks,2,Thu Feb 26 11:23:16 2015 UTC,"I have a couple friends who got the IS degree and found jobs in town. They do not get as good of pay as a CS or EE grad, but respectable."
Reno,2x7pfy,badboybeyer,2,Thu Feb 26 17:06:36 2015 UTC,I am currently an undergrad and would also be interested in hearing from someone who went through this and graduated with the degree. If you find some information would you kindly pass it along? :)
Reno,2x7pfy,munchers65,2,Thu Feb 26 18:02:22 2015 UTC,"Two of my friends got degrees in IS and thought it was a waste at the end of the day so they went for masters in computer science.  From what they told me the IS degree didn't have much practical use since real IT professionals do far more than the courses provide for, and computer science teaches the problem solving tools you need when you get into the industry. Information systems being part of the business school seemed to be the weakness from their prospective.   If you want to learn computers take computer classes, if you want to learn business take business classes. Mixing the two in a full curriculum they found wasn't worth their time after they walked away.  They thought of the IS program as a joke and were kind of ashamed to admit that is where they got their bachelors when talking to other computer literate people."
Reno,2x7pfy,Fuckin_McNulty,1 point,Thu Feb 26 20:32:55 2015 UTC,Yes. I have a former roommate who manages an IT department in town and I asked her for her opinion on CompSci degree vs. IS degree for an IT career. I also asked a manager at an office staffing agency in town the same question. Waiting on reply's from both.  I'm also going to be calling around and trying to speak with HR managers at local casino's and banks to get their opinions on this. Hopefully I get some candid responses.
Reno,2x7pfy,hairylunch,2,Thu Feb 26 18:55:07 2015 UTC,"I feel you, but I really think (especially when times get tough and the economy starts contracting) that most HR departments start getting really brutal with their selections, and start tossing resume's that don't have at least a bachelors degree. It's a really easy way to thin out a massive stack of resumes, and I've heard multiple accounts of places doing this."
Reno,2x7pfy,timtimchuroo,1 point,Thu Feb 26 19:41:09 2015 UTC,"I hire for an IT group and while degrees are great (I'm seriously not knocking them), I put a TON of weight on actual real-world experience. We want people who can hit the ground running."
Reno,2x7pfy,FalseBottom,2,Thu Feb 26 19:47:48 2015 UTC,"What's your end goal?  If all you want is an IT job, getting some certs, starting work now, and getting 4 years experience will be more beneficial than the time/cost of getting a degree.    The hurdle will be getting that first job, but for anything past the first job, experience trumps formal education.  CS is completely unrelated from an IT job . . . if you end up taking an IT job after getting a CS degree, it means you got your education at a degree mill , that you called it in while getting your education, or that you really didn't want to do CS and wasted your time getting the degree."

I've lived most of my life in Seattle, but have spent a lot of time in eastern Washington, LA/Orange County, Vegas, Phoenix, Chicago and NY and for me Reno is perfectly fine. I even liked the smell of the annual fire you get to smell for 2 or 3 weeks in September. I have gotten nose bleeds for the first week or so often when I come down here, but I breathe so much better in Reno than just about anywhere. I have drunkenly broken my nose twice and being in Reno does wonders for me."

Some of my friends say that their allergies were worse in other places even when the sagebrush was blooming. But still after being three years out of Reno, I really do miss the dry breeze."

It's hard to put any thing (especially an in-land valley) to par with clear coastal air, but I can't complain.  The seasonal fires do suck, especially as a person with asthma, but you just gotta take the right precautions and it's no big deal.    Honestly, when I lived in the SF Bay Area, the ""bad days"" there had way more smog than I've ever seen here (lol, the silver lining of all that crazy wind!)  You'll see a haze from now and then but not much.  Gotta put major props to whomever's campaign took out all the wood-burning fireplaces in Reno."
Reno,2x6qd9,riffraff100214,1 point,Thu Feb 26 07:46:53 2015 UTC,The air is generally pretty good especially if you live in one of the hillier areas. It's often windy here and in the afternoons it's crystal clear air. Inversion in winter can suck but since we don't have winter anymore that's not often an issue. When it does happen there are burning restrictions and warnings and such. If there's a fire it can be terrible.  Say average 5 days a year. The altitude can affect O2 saturation.  My daughter had lung problems and always had higher sats in Palo Alto. the air in Georgia was okay but then you had to live in Georgia.

In general, high altitude air (assuming you aren't in a deep valley) will ensure pollutants don't get trapped. Humidity is also a factor in all this.  I tend to travel a lot to various places, and the air in Reno is by far the best (granted, I've never been to Denver). Coastal air tends to be salty and humid, and never smelled nice to me (I hate the bay area's air).  The only time the air is bad here is a few weeks during the summer (when there are fires and it gets very very hot.. the air gets a bit hazy), and a few weeks here and there in the winter (when it gets a bit humid and the pollution gets a bit trapped)."

Reno,2x6qd9,dangerousminority,1 point,Thu Feb 26 21:30:09 2015 UTC,"Doesn't it mean less oxygen in the blood?   Maybe for the first few days.  Most likely, you have a higher packed cell volume (essentially, what percent of the volume of your blood is red blood cells).  For example, in dogs the normal range for packed cell volumes is 35-57%, and about 90% of the pcv's I do are above 40%, with a substantial portion of those well over 50%."

Owners are a very friendly couple and super friendly towards beginners, I've been going for years and they always give the newbies attention. They have classes on weekdays, 6:15AM, 10:30AM, 5:15PM, 6:15PM, and i believe one class on Saturday at 10:30AM (they don't do the 6:15PM on Fridays because no one shows up lol)  The owners (Ashley / Jesse) usually let you take your first class free and if you want to sign up you can approach one of them after the class to talk about sign-ups. You won't need to bring your own equipment for your first time, they almost always have clean wraps for you to borrow for your first day and definitely will have spare gloves for you to use. You're never asked to get in the ring for a class, you may be asked to hold your hands up for others to punch them, but no one will ever say ""For today's class we will get in the ring and fight."" Spar nights are usually Wednesday nights and you can sign up and they will make sure you don't go up against someone you can't handle (but most people don't start sparring for a month or two.)  If you do sign up for I believe a year they give you a new pair of gloves and wraps for signing up. It comes out to be $70/m at its cheapest if you sign up for one year. If you do go, try to show up early and sign a waiver / get setup with your wraps. Most of the time if you show up early there are a bunch of jump ropes around that you should spend time warming up with (or take a short walk / run on the treadmills by one of the rings)  Edit : forgot to link their website"

First 20 is usually warm-up / shadow boxing, next 20 is some sort of workout with weights or just something to try and wear you down, last 20 is bag work (normally with a partner.) Ashley can cook up some workouts that will leave you catatonic for a few days, but usually when a newbie shows up she makes sure not to commit any sort of homicide.

Reno,2x46rg,mansebot,1 point,Wed Feb 25 14:56:01 2015 UTC,"Hi there! Always good to hear of people interested in Catholicism! I don't know how much you've looked into converting, but I'll go ahead and give you the basics. Forgive me if you already know this stuff.  People join the the Church through a process called RCIA (Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults). This can take anywhere from several months to a year or more depending on how the person converting feels and if they believe they're ready. It's a series of classes, usually held once a week, that focus on the history and structure of the Church, and focus on what we as Catholics believe. It's also free! Granted, I have seen a few parishes charge $20 or so for books and learning materials. It depends on the church, but the majority don't charge anything.  If you've been previously baptized in the name of the Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), you enter RCIA as a ""candidate"", someone who is preparing to receive First Communion, Confirmation, or both. If you've never been baptized you enter as a ""catechumen"", someone who's new to the Church and is looking to receive baptism, first communion, and confirmation. This process usually begins in the fall or late summer and concludes at Vigil Mass on Easter. This year's group of catechumens and candidates has already been installed by Bishop Calvo and is preparing for Easter, so you'd probably have to wait a few months if you want to do things the traditional way. However, priests are always willing to meet with people outside of RCIA to talk with them and sometimes meet and give them classes independently.  RCIA is offered at every Catholic parish. And as a side note, I've never seen a parish that isn't welcoming to converts. We're always excited to see new people!  I don't know where you're at in your faith journey, but I converted to Catholicism myself a while back and I'm really involved in ministry at a parish here in town. If you have any questions or want to talk about anything, feel free to PM me. Granted, I'm not a priest or ordained but I love theology and I'm always excited to help people learn about the Church.   Hope this helped you out. God bless!"

Reno,2x0oe0,TheMapesHotel,1 point,Tue Feb 24 20:31:42 2015 UTC,"So of course the big ones are the Nevada Humane Society and the SPCA are always taking volunteers. NHS is great because you can volunteer doing just about whatever, if you like dogs you can walk them, play with them, train them, teach handling classes, go to off site events and try to get them adopted. You can also just do office or clinic work or play with bunnies.   The Nevada Historical Society on campus takes volunteers and has a pretty substantial information section on casino and gambling history as well as Reno events. They are really friendly and the environment is quite and laid back.   There are a few places to volunteer on campus like the various labs depending on what you are into. On campus I volunteer with the intensive english language center being a conversation partner for exchange students.   I couldn't give you a name off the top of my head but if you Google it there are a few organizations in town that refurbish old computer hardware for kids and low income people.   Almost all the events companies take volunteers such as art town, burning man, and the various festivals around town. If you have seen any that interest you or that you enjoyed going to pull up their website and see what volunteer positions they have.   UNR radio is always looking for people.   The school district takes volunteers to tutor kids.  The library takes volunteers, I did that in high school, its a pretty laid back environment.  Really the possibilities are endless."
Reno,2x0oe0,FroggiJoy87,1 point,Tue Feb 24 20:34:40 2015 UTC,"I recently started volunteering at a library and really enjoy it.  It took quite a while to get all the paperwork sorted out but was worth the wait.  They only ask for 8hr/month but you can go in and help out at anytime, which they always need.  Right now I mainly just re-shelve books but for 2hrs a week I'm fine with that.  It's a nice quiet environment and if you like reading it's the perfect place!   A word of advice on the Humane Society, my SO works there and it is absolute hell.  The higher-ups really don't give a crap about the people and tend to not even know what they're doing.  Of course they always need help, but don't expect to have a great time there.  You more than likely will have nothing to do with the clinic (even though they are in desperate need of help), more likely just walk dogs and/or clean out kennels/floors.  Also, be sure to always keep covered up as much as possible, ringworm is constantly prevalent and everyone gets it at some point, and treatment is not covered by them.  Also be sure to shower after work everyday and if you have pets keep them away from your clothes.    I know the Discovery Museum takes volunteers, but after that incident last fall I think it's a bit harder to get into.  (I was really close to volunteering there until that happened, lame!)  But they might be more relaxed now, give it a shot."
Reno,2x0oe0,TheMapesHotel,0,Tue Feb 24 23:24:40 2015 UTC,"Not to say you are wrong about the Humane Society but I have been a constant volunteer there since '06. Sure the higher ups don't interact with volunteers a lot but they are busy. I have worked in the clinic a lot doing spay packs, filing, and returning calls and scheduling appointments. All you have to do is ask. Never gotten ringworm, neither has my equally as active SO. I also know several people who have worked there longer than two years. I have also never been forced to clean a kennel or cage unless I was doing so by my own initiative. The great thing about NHS is there are niche spots for every volunteer to be satisfied. I serve on a specific volunteer program committee, foster, and write for the newsletter."

Reno,2wlxaj,wayofapilgrim,12,Sat Feb 21 00:48:56 2015 UTC,"Reno has a lot of local bands, but as far as a music scene is concerned, it's a little disjointed.   There's a lot of punk, funk, rockabilly, and metal in Reno. There's also a little bit of shoegaze, prog rock, folk, etc. Here are a few bands that I enjoy: Buster Blue, Seas & Centuries, Wolpertinger, Synthesize Her  It would be cool to hear from others what local bands they are into.  I have found that if you're looking for an active ""scene,"" where there are bands that represent a ""Reno sound,"" and are active continuously enough to follow... that is very hit-or-miss. What Reno does have is lots of groups of talented musicians who put out great EP's and albums that are worthy of being on your music player. You'll find that some bands are touring hard and trying to make a name for themselves, while others are too busy with life or being in 5 other bands to really focus on their one project that you do like.  Discovering bands: Bandcamp http://www.bandcamp.com/tag/reno You'll have to listen to a lot of music to find some you like, but it's the surefire way of getting started on your journey of discovery.  Check RN&R every week - most of the time they have band bios in their music column.

Don't forget to check out the North Valleys (Lemmon, Golden, Sun, Panther) true there can be some trailer parky trashy areas (red necks and hillbillies don't necessarily mean dangerous and bad) but they are affordable and safe. We pay $700 a month for a three bedroom two bath with an acre of land all to ourselves. All of our neighbors are ancient so the neighborhood is quite and extremely safe.

They're trying to sidestep protections put into place to protect the consumer from greedy cabbies, which use to be a really big deal here (Nevada, not reno specifically).   Further more the way they came in Nevada was just shitty. One week the board that controls taxis announcing they were working with uber to bring them, the next week uber just starts operations. They choose to blindside the state government and now they are paying for it. Unless Uber is spending a bit of money lobbying this session, I don't see anything changing. Especially from an Internet petition, that's just not the way politics works in Nevada. Especially since if this did raise to the level of state wide initiative, all this signatures would be moot.

Reno,2wgong,jojofroyo,0,Thu Feb 19 19:53:23 2015 UTC,"Sometimes the establishment needs to be challenged. The blindside was a body check to wake up the old guard taxi lobby and the legislation that needs to get with the times. If anything, maybe the existing cab companies will embrace technology and allow similar abilities, just being able to see if there is an open cab close would be a great option.  I mean, if they can operate in California with their stupid laws, it should be easy to do so in NV."

Reno,2wgong,anamnesisplease,1 point,Thu Feb 19 22:43:30 2015 UTC,Can you cite a source for that story?  Why do you think that would be more likely to happen in an uber cab than a traditional cab?
Reno,2wgong,haroldp,1 point,Thu Feb 19 23:21:09 2015 UTC,"It's not that hard to Google the facts. The more you look at Uber, the more you realize how predatory it is. Let's start with the fact if a driver is in an accident, it is their fault entirely, since Uber claims they're all independent contractors. So you're only as good as the cheapest insurance out there. They're being sued by several states for not providing adequate background checks against their drivers, as well as illegal poaching of other drivers from other Uber-like services."
Reno,2wgong,anamnesisplease,1 point,Fri Feb 20 00:07:35 2015 UTC,"It's not that hard to Google the facts.    Yeah, I googled.  I didn't quite see what you are claiming.  Make the case for me that Uber is less safe than traditional cabs from driver-assault or accident.  Show me where states are suing Uber for inadequate background checks.  What is ""illegal poaching of other drivers""?  How do you illegally hire someone away from the competition?    I have seen them doing some sleazy things to sabotage competitors like lyft.    I don't necessarily even support Uber, so much as I oppose unnecessary rules supporting monopolies that keeps Uber out of the market.  I don't care if it's Uber or Lyft or someone else that replaces the current system (mess), so long as someone does."
Reno,2wgong,haroldp,1 point,Fri Feb 20 00:20:10 2015 UTC,"This article from the Las Vegas Sun has all the reasons: tax evasion, unlicensed drivers, avoiding regulations."
Reno,2wgong,k2nsf,1 point,Fri Feb 20 00:21:16 2015 UTC,That does not address it at all.
Reno,2wgong,haroldp,1 point,Fri Feb 20 00:28:57 2015 UTC,"You need a Police Card to be a cab driver. I don't think they go through the same fingerprinting and background check to be an Uber driver.   Also, though not really related to your question: Cab drivers have physicals to determine that their vision and hearing is at a minimal level for safety. I don't think Uber drivers have the same requirement."
Reno,2wgong,witeowl,0,Fri Feb 20 07:06:37 2015 UTC,"You need a police card to do absolutely everything these days.  You need a license to wash dishes in Nevada now.  Does it make anyone safer?  Or is just barriers to entry into the market, erected to protect the incumbents from competition?  I think the latter."
Reno,2wgong,haroldp,1 point,Fri Feb 20 08:35:08 2015 UTC,"You need a police card to do absolutely everything these days. You need a license to wash dishes in Nevada now.    Eh? Please clarify. I tried to google but found nothing. All I see is that it's required for jobs which require a high degree of supervision (which is ironic because my understanding is that it's required whenever one won't be supervised at all times).   It's true that a fingerprint background check only finds prior offenders, but you can't claim that such a check is absolutely worthless compared to letting anyone be a driver."
Reno,2wgong,witeowl,3,Fri Feb 20 14:04:25 2015 UTC,"Some DO make you go hmmmm but let's clarify what's going on.  The panic button is in India (only US market I've seen is Chicago?), where there is a much greater cultural and societal issue with rape, and Uber was sued by Cali and forced to change wording in their advertisements and how much they tout screenings and pay (which was needed).  That type of stuff is needed, of course they can't just do -anything- they want. It's a new technology meets industry scenario and because government is slow to change, it always had to react when new things come along.   Look at how side effects of pot legalization are still being hashed out in many states. How do you deal/ID with people driving under the influence, can employers still fire your ass if you test positive, even if you're not currently high (just like they don't usually if you drink).   I've ridden in so many shitty cabs around Reno in the past year as well as the ones I took working in the bar industry in Tampa, FL and I am soooo happy there is something to scare them. Being stood up, or horrendously late by cabs is one of the most frustrating things in the world, especially when you are trying to party responsibly."
Reno,2wgong,popnwave,1 point,Fri Feb 20 01:58:59 2015 UTC,The panic button is in response to the cultural problem in INDIA.
Reno,2wgong,anamnesisplease,1 point,Fri Feb 20 04:15:26 2015 UTC,"Read more articles about Uber. The panic button is coming to Chicago first, and then being rolled out to the rest of the country."
Reno,2wgong,haroldp,-1,Fri Feb 20 17:47:53 2015 UTC,"Further more the way they came in Nevada was just shitty.    It is standard practice for Uber to just break the rules and get busted because it generates a lot of press and public outrage, and as a result, actual change.  Working ""through channels"" just gives the incumbent monopolies more power to slow or block it."
Reno,2wgong,mocheesiest1234,2,Thu Feb 19 23:26:40 2015 UTC,"This is bullshit. You can't just break the rules if you think you are above them, that's not a how a proper business works."
Reno,2wgong,haroldp,1 point,Fri Feb 20 19:07:59 2015 UTC,"Well, their contention is that they are an internet technology company, not a cap company, so cab company rules do not apply to them.  But I think that is mainly a legal strategy.    The core problem is that the rules have been corrupted.  They were invented with the idea of protecting passengers safety, but now incumbent cab companies just leverage them to shut out innovation and competition.  When they have tried to change the rules ""the right way"", well the state livery board is run by the cab company owners and local politicians don't want to help take on entrenched mobsters on behalf of some internet-dicks from another state.  That simply won't work.    What does work is civil disobedience.  They break the rules to publicize the fact that they are corrupt.  People see how they are being ripped off.  Now I'll grant this is just in the service of some dudes who want to make money driving people around (it's not a war or jim crowe protest), but civil disobedience is an important and useful tool in the cause of fighting bad laws and corruption."
Reno,2wgong,mocheesiest1234,2,Fri Feb 20 20:12:28 2015 UTC,"I work in state senate and am moving bills right now to fix this problem. But Uber trying to act like they are not a transportation company is ridiculous. They have to abide by the same rules as everyone else. We need reform, and it's coming, but what uber did is not civil disobedience. They operated outside the law and made money, that's a business move."
Reno,2wgong,haroldp,1 point,Fri Feb 20 20:27:29 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree with you.  Yes, their defense is just a legal tactic.  Yes, they are just a company trying to make money.  I think I've already said as much.    But their tactic is most definitely civil disobedience. And if people are actually working on it (thank you!), I suspect it's been effective."

Reno,2wi8sp,gsneezy,5,Fri Feb 20 04:07:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah dude you read WAAAY too far into that. Why would you give a shit about what he thought? Why would you even give that moment a second thought? I mean I grew up here too and if everyone here were so sensitive about what anyone's preconceived notions of this town were we'd all leave. You're making us look bad, not him."
Reno,2wi8sp,gsneezy,-1,Fri Feb 20 04:20:24 2015 UTC,"I may have, true.  The pat on the shoulder sold it though.  And I may be making US look bad, but did not do one thing offensive, did I?  I posted my perception of a snide comment.  Which, as I point out, may be because I am all too aware of internet trolling.  And given my age, may not be readily apparent.  I may have explained it inelegantly (totally my issue) but I did not respond negatively, confront him, or do anything of that nature at all.  I did experience the negative vibes the whole time, though.  So, instead of taking what I wrote--which is really just be cognizant of others's feelings whether YOU are personally interested or not--common courtesy, really, you choose to interpret it as me making anyone look bad, myself included.  The individual I was actually talking to was genuinely thankful and we had a very pleasant interaction.  So there's that.  And it isn't the perception of the town (which again, the individual I talked to expressed a great admiration for) it was my sharing the history of the neighborhood.  I don't care if others like Reno or not.  As you say, if they don't like it they can leave.  But to mock someone who does not share that opinion is rude."
Reno,2wi8sp,prelimar,2,Fri Feb 20 04:40:17 2015 UTC,"Ok, I should have clarified how I believe you've made us look bad; by posting it up here. And if the guy was 'trolling' you or being intentionally rude, the last thing you do is get upset, that's the only thing those people want anyway. If he really was being obviously mean for no reason, be rude back! If someone's mocking you, you  don't owe them any courtesy. But most of all don't make people visiting this sub or this city feel like they have to watch their tone for fear of pissing off a local, nobody likes that town."
Reno,2wi8sp,bigfootaka316,4,Fri Feb 20 05:39:55 2015 UTC,"Your point is well taken.  I am reluctant to be rude back, as I have been in some gnarly bar fights and don't need that hassle.  I have no trouble with confrontation when warranted or standing up, for sure.  It was me ore the passive-aggressive nature of it, really.  I noticed the vibes he was putting out, but couldn't be sure what they were about and since he didn't say anything (till the end) no harm, no foul.  I could have said, ""What the fuck, guy?"" and called him out, but I am in a pizza joint with babies in tables behind me.  All was informed by the environment.  If I wasn't clear, but I don't care if someone hates Reno and I love it.  I took the comment as his thinking I made it all up, that nobody would care in the first place, etc.    Again, it was the passive-aggressive thing.  There are infinitely many reasons why he was throwing off the vibes he was (Autism, broke up with a girlfriend, angry at his friend, hates it here....), so I let it slide.  He wasn't in my face at all.  Then the comment at the end informed his previous behavior.  I do appreciate your feedback, honestly.  I would say that conversely, nobody may like towns where one has to watch their tone, but nobody likes visitors that rip on where they are visiting and are dicks about it."
Reno,2wi8sp,haroldp,1 point,Fri Feb 20 06:08:46 2015 UTC,"I get it.  I wouldn't be rude back, as that is uncool IMO.    And had he been up front it isn't an issue.  It is m"

Reno,2wba4a,RPLLL,2,Wed Feb 18 17:19:16 2015 UTC,I carry the opinion that even half open our larger ski resorts trump Mt. Rose. Mt. Rose is really convenient for residents living in south Reno but Northstar isn't much further away from downtown (time wise - you travel quickly on I-80) and you get to pass through the beautiful sierra mountains and the town of Truckee.  If you're going to go skiing twice anyway you should try to different ski resorts regardless.

Reno,2wba4a,RPLLL,1 point,Wed Feb 18 16:47:42 2015 UTC,fair enough.  We are in our mid-30's. Not really into the weeds. Like unique experiences. Staying at a casino (silver legacy) and are interested in gambling. Would like some restaurant suggestions (a little more contemporary or upscale) and bar recommendations.
Reno,2wba4a,GLaDimnotyou,3,Wed Feb 18 17:18:28 2015 UTC,"You definitely have to eat our sushi while you're out here. The value of Reno's all-you-can-eat sushi market is arguably unbeatable.  Check yelp for our local micro breweries and indy restaurants around midtown as well as in the downtown area.  Virginia city is one of the most unique ""old west"" towns in the country.  Definitely make your way up there.   If you're super bored you could always run to the blackrock desert. I personally love it: Beautiful and unique scenery out there.  (But Bruno's raviolis have gone to shit.) There are also hot springs and whatnot. Google it. I'm sure you can turn it into a real memorable experience."
Reno,2wba4a,murica_ftw,3,Wed Feb 18 17:44:33 2015 UTC,"+1 to the sushi recommendation. All you can eat sushi is pretty big here and we have some great spots. Some personal favorites are Hiroba and Tha Joint. Reef, located downtown (so may be more convenient for you), has decent fish but has the best appetizers.  For upscale contemporary check out Campo, The Gas Lamp, Granite St. Eatery, St. James Brasserie.  For cocktails check out Chapel or Death and Taxes. For beer check out Great Basin, Silver Peak or Brasserie St James (all three have good food too)  Favorite steakhouse is inside the Western Village - a really small truck stop/casino in Sparks. Looks from the outside are VERY deceiving. This place is killer.  Since you'll be gambling, another good casino outside of the main downtown strip I'd recommend is Peppermill if you feel like a change in scenery.  I would also agree with skiing one day at Rose and one day somewhere else. Northstar and Squaw are both close and great options. Be aware that the snowpack is way below normal this season (again), so unfortunately even the big resorts will have run closures due to lack of snow.  Hope you enjoy your stay and have fun skiing and exploring!"

Hit the museum when you first get into town, the graveyard right down the road has some very interesting headstones.  Then wander down the strip and check out the old school. Find a mine tour if you get a chance, its crazy to think about working in there.    Now for dining, Campo for some Italian, mixed reviews on that place but over all its nice, make reservations or you will be waiting. Reef is right next door for sushi but i wasnt really that impressed, dont get me wrong quality of the fish was good but the combination of the roll just didnt tickle my fancy. Ole Bridge next door to that has a good selection of craft beer. Back to Italian though, Portifino is right down the road and is pretty good, never have had a bad meal there.   SoDo , Old Granite Street  and The Chocolate Bar are all good options too.  Tuna two ways at the choco bar is fucking awesome.  Also like RPLL said, get some sushi while your here, i mean if you like fish.  Jasmine in south reno, hit that place on the way down from Rose. Hiroba is pretty popular and has some pretty good rolls, a little overrated in my opinion but that's like, just my opinion man. My go to is Sushi Pier.     Craft beer fan?  Perfect, check out Brewers Cabinet. Its in the general downtown area, great place for a beer and some food after riding all day.  Its pretty low key so wear your snow gear in if you would like.  Brasserie Saint James just won best mid sized brew pub at the great american beer fest, took a medal for their saison and has some amazing food.  They tend to brew more Belgian style beers but have a solid list for sure. Silver Peak  is right down the street from legacy and is well rounded. Same goes for Great Basin .     Other things worth checking out is Junkee Clothing Exchange  Their consignment side has siome cool treasures hiding about. The Melting Pot is another cool shop to walk around, even if grass isnt your thing they still have some cool clothes and what not. Neon Dragon Fly is the melting pots grown up sister store, more for the ladies. 1864 is a cool little bar with some damn fine cocktails, best whiskey sour in reno and the spring creek, so fucking good.  Chill little spot too, not your average frat bar which is nice.     Head up to Sand Harbor in tahoe just for the lake, then head over to T's Mesquite Rotisserie for a tri tip burrito, bring cash they don't take cards.    I think that should cover most of the basics. Cheers!"

Reno,2w6sro,FredTesla,3,Tue Feb 17 13:05:30 2015 UTC,"Closely working is an understatement. Elon Musk is on the board of directors and was a major investor in them when they started up.  I think it is good that another company moved into the area. This adds to the idea that if we pull the best companies, other companies will choose to move in.  I wonder if this means that Reno/Northern nevada will be a testing ground for the solar battery packs that they announced once the gigafactory starts pumping out batteries."
Reno,2w6sro,wartornhero,2,Tue Feb 17 19:28:26 2015 UTC,"He is still is a major investor in both Tesla and SolarCity. About 26% of Tesla and 23% of SolarCity if I remember correctly.    I wonder if this means that Reno/Northern nevada will be a testing ground for the solar battery packs that they announced once the gigafactory starts pumping out batteries.   Musk said during Tesla's last quarter conference call that Tesla will unveil a stationary energy storage unit in a month and it should be in production in 6 months. So no need for the gigafactory which will not start producing cells for another year.   Also it's not only meant for solar, it's mainly to off-set peak demand charges.   Reno will not be the testing ground since the program is already being tested in beta for over a year now in California. Here's what an installation looks like https://i.imgur.com/eI5OdHs.jpg from /r/SolarCity"
Reno,2w6sro,dangerousminority,2,Tue Feb 17 19:38:03 2015 UTC,"So I went to SolarCity's website to read up on how it could only cost a homeowner $30 a month. In the fine print (which they claim to have none of), it says a 30% balloon payment of total system cost is due on June 1st, the year after installation, whether or not you receive a tax credit.   Edit: I see they're two different products. Serves me right for looking before I had my coffee."
Reno,2w6sro,wartornhero,3,Tue Feb 17 17:43:17 2015 UTC,"You are confusing different payment options. What you are refering to with the balloon payment is the MyPower program which is not the same thing as the $30 a month offer talked about in the PR release.   The $30 a month offer is either under a power purchase agreement (PPA) or a solar lease.   For MyPower, the homeowner owns the PV system, so the responsability of the tax credit falls on them and they must have tax income liability equal to 30% of the system for it to be worth it. Most people who don't simply will not choose the MYPower program.   You can see all the payment options here.   Also, I don't think SolarCity claim not to have ""fine prints"". Although I wouldn't consider what you mention a fine print since it is something that will come up way before anyone see a contract. Anyway they are saying they are open about their practices and that their contracts are simple.  They even publish their contracts online:  PPA  Lease"

No ability to appeal, no payment plans no nothing. If I chose to fight it they were going to charge both my husband and I with a misdemeanor and arrest us on the spot. The investigators are all major assholes that you do not want to deal with. They really don't joke with the out of county registration thing.

Reno,2visiv,hairylunch,4,Wed Feb 11 16:45:29 2015 UTC,Marketon for carne asada.   Burritos: Go to Los Gallos. Seriously. Just go.
Reno,2visiv,TheMostMeta,5,Wed Feb 11 16:45:41 2015 UTC,"While Marketon is a good option, I think the best carne asada is from Sharma Mart.  It used to be called Carniceria El Guicho.  When the old man that ran the shop retired, it was bought out by another family, but the old mans family (nephew and niece? maybe daughter?) still runs the meat part of it.  Sharma Mart, on Valley Road, GET SOME!"

Reno,2visiv,clintotronic,2,Thu Feb 12 02:10:32 2015 UTC,"Speaking of carnicerias, has anyone tried the one at Neil and Peckham?  I'll admit that a lot of these places are kinda intimidating . . . language and cultural barrier, and getting called chino can be a bit much . . .  Part of the reason I mentioned Marketon for meat is that it straddles the fence nicely, and you're not ostracized too much for being a gringo.  Though /u/PorkSoftballBeer's post makes me think I may have to make the haul over to Sharma . . ."
Reno,2visiv,hairylunch,3,Thu Feb 12 17:52:46 2015 UTC,"Haven't tried it, but funny story.  I'm half islander and half white, and Im often mistaken for every brownish ethnicity on the planet.  Everytime I go into a place like that, they start talking to me in really fast spanish.  It temporarily breaks down that language and cultural barrier.    TL;DR Its fun being brownish at carnicerias, but not at the airport."

Brasserie St. James just won best brew-pub at the GABF in Colorado. Definitely give that a shot. If I'm correct, their saison just placed gold too, and it's fantastic. Really good food too. Not your usual brewery food either, rustic and Frenchy drunken comfort food.  Craft cocktails at Death and Taxes or Chapel. The Depot is a new distillery/brewery that has good beers and cocktails (the food is fucking terrible though, unfortunately.)  Reno Provisions is probably your spot fo r wine and cheese. If you're drinking at the bar, they serve you complimentary charcuterie, bread, and cheese and shit tapas style.  I could keep going, come hungry and thirsty. Eating and drinking is pretty much the best thing to do here, our bar and restaurant scene is really pretty awesome."

Old Granite Street Eatery is one of my favorite casual upscale dining spots.  Atlantis Bistro Napa has an incredible happy hour with most drinks and apps half off (it has gotten popular though so you'd have to get there at 4pm to get a table).  If you are into the spa thing Atlantis has a top notch one.     What occasion are y'all coming here for?   Also what age bracket or demographic in terms of bar scene?   That might help guide the advice."

Reno,2v55oo,hobsonUSAF,3,Sun Feb 8 16:45:24 2015 UTC,"Alright, let's dive into more food!  Steak houses:  Cactus Creek is consistently voted the best steak house in northern Nevada. It is also a uniquely Reno experience, as it is located in the back of a tiny local casino in a dark, industrial area north of town.  Ruby River is another fantastic steak house south of Midtown with delicious avocado eggrolls.  Thai (we have so much good Thai):  Bangkok Cuisine is my personal favorite because they are the only ones who will upon request use fresh Thai chilis in their dishes. The red curry is phenomenal. They have locations south of town and in Midtown - I prefer the south location.  Asiana Thai is a new Thai fusion restaurant that I've tried a couple of times and enjoyed. Go here for lesser-known traditional recipes done really well.  Ethiopian:  Zagol is our only Ethiopian restaurant, but it's all we need. The honey wine is delicious, and coffee fans can schedule ahead for an Ethiopian coffee ceremony, where they will roast the beans at your table.  Burgers:  The Awful Awful is a Reno staple that is served at a number of places, each one swearing that they are the original. I somehow have never had it, but others can tell you where you should go. I think it's the Nugget.  Midtown Eats serves their burgers with beef, elk, and bison. All of them are to die for. Ask for the sweet potato fries if you are feeling gluttonous. They're worth it.  Pizza:  Noble Pie makes the Wrangler, which has become the favorite pizza of every person to whom I have introduced it. Service can be hit or miss, but it's been a lot better lately. I think they got rid of the rude ones.  Blind Onion is also a local favorite. They make their dough with brown sugar and have honey at every table so that your crusts become and instant dessert. However, *Wild Garlic is another place that was opened recently by (I believe) the same people. The style is the same, but the menu itself is different and I have really come to prefer their pizza. Better ambiance, as well.  (cont.)"
Reno,2v55oo,PavementBlues,2,Sun Feb 8 16:47:13 2015 UTC,"Cafes:  We have way too many great cafes. I will attempt to name a few.  Coffee Bar is right next to Wild Garlic and features coffee, tea, wine, and beer. Perfect place to read or to hang out with friends, and the staff is amazing.  Bibo has a few locations in town, all of them good. Their vanilla chai can quickly become a vice.  The Hub serves good coffee and is one of the driving forces behind Midtown, the part of town where you can go if you want a better environment than casinos and stale cigarette smoke.  Dreamer's, also in Midtown, serves Magpie coffee, a great local roaster. Unlike the Hub, however, they also have a nice breakfast and lunch menu.  Let me know if you have any questions about any other types of food in the area! Welcome to Reno!"

If the right spin was put on something like this, it may fit nicely with Artown in July. Artown could certainly assist with finding a nice place to make it happen.   Make it a family affair, since most musicians are looking to upgrade to nicer equipment, newer players and kids just starting out could get a killer deal on some new equipment. Possibly see about http://www.renorockcamp.com/ getting involved, to give their kids a chance to rock out, as well as show perspective buyers what they too could be doing after a little practice. Maybe invite some other local bands to perform also, as well as providing a place for other bands to meet up with other locals who may be able to fill in any existing holes in their lineup, aka: ""seeking a drummer"".  Maytan used to be a great resource for finding an instructor. I took lessons upstairs there for years. When I ventured into playing the banjo, Maytan had a list of 4-5 local players who would give lessons. I'm sure that Bizzare probably maintains a similar list, and might be willing to either post an open invite to musicians who provide instruction, or assemble a list of names of instructors, as well as the styles they prefer to teach, so beginners can be put in contact with the right person."
Reno,2uvkah,Tobelingrey,8,Thu Feb 5 15:09:26 2015 UTC,"I've commuted from Reno to Truckee for the past two years. Don't mind it one bit. In fact, I prefer it. I lived in Tahoe before, and I got very claustrophobic, there's very few decent restaurants, and almost no good bars, anything you can't get at Safeway you have to go to Reno for anyway. Plus... It's cheaper for me to live here, and spend the money on gas. Truckee/Tahoe is expensive... Not having to worry about shoveling your driveway in (a normal) winter is nice too, not to mention there's almost never a significant amount of snow on this side of I-80."
Reno,2uvkah,Formaldehyd3,2,Thu Feb 5 19:13:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would work out well to commute to the mountains without 4WD.  I've lived in Incline Village for over 9 years without 4WD, and there were some days that I couldn't get to work even though work was in the same town.  I still needed to borrow cars some days, and other days I just didn't leave the house.  Luckily, the last two winters have been very mild, so your civic would have done fine...but maybe the next winter will be heavy.  Sometimes it would be nice weather in the morning and a blizzard in the afternoon.  Either way, the more you drive, the higher your risk of sliding out of control and getting into a wreck.  I've lived in 3 places up here, and we've helped several friends find places...craigslist is hands down the best option for finding a rental.  Anyone who says anything different is a competitor.  I have never seen a craigslist scam directed towards renting an apartment.  I'm not sure about ""vacation rentals"", but that's a different story.  You will still need to walk through the building and talk with a rental agent in person.  How can you possibly scam that?  Would they ask for a check in advance and then they don't show up?  That's ridiculous.  Anyone can do a walk-through of the rental before paying anything...and most rental companies are well established.  You likely have two options.  Do the commute until you can afford a car payment.  My new car only costs me $143 a month, and I feel a lot safer driving it.  Or, do the commute until you find a good rental option up here.  Either you will pay more in rent or you will pay more on a new car.  Generally, employers up here in the mountains like to know if you are equipped to handle the snow, especially if you commute.  If they can't count on you, that may put your job at risk.  Everyone up here would rather hire someone local, unless the work is specialized."
Reno,2uvkah,VixenVlogs,4,Thu Feb 5 19:36:51 2015 UTC,I think a decent set of snow tires or chains will get you through the mountains in a 2WD vehicle.
Reno,2uvkah,chriskmee,1 point,Thu Feb 5 21:40:24 2015 UTC,Pretty much. I drive a FWD Focus and have never had an issue. I run mud and snow tires from November to May.
Reno,2uvkah,random_user_name_13,1 point,Mon Feb 9 06:26:59 2015 UTC,"Yea, while I do have a Subaru with AWD and snow/ice tires today, I used to drive a FWD car with all season tires over snowy mountains, and all I needed to get through the worst times was a set of tire chains on the front wheels (As a college student at the time, that was much cheaper than getting snow tires).  So if I was to make a suggestion to OP about the snow concern, I would say preferably get some decent snow/ice tires. The Washoe County Sheriffs department suggest keeping them on from October 1st to April 30th. I would suggest getting the mounted on separate rims if you can. Tirerack has a warehouse just outside Reno where you can call in and pick up an order instead of paying for shipping. Blizzaks and Xice tires are the best tires you can easily get around here. Just note, even 2WD vehicles should get 4 snow tires.  If you can't afford snow tires, or can't store them, or don't want them for whatever reason, then get some tire chains for when you need them. I used to use the les schwab quick fit chains and they were relatively easy to take on and off. I would suggest also keeping an old blanket or mat in your truck with your snow chains, that way you can rest your knees on that instead of snow when you are installing them."
Reno,2uvkah,chriskmee,2,Mon Feb 9 16:27:25 2015 UTC,I made the commute every day for a year. The summers are fine. And even the winters are mostly fine. I worked in martis camp and it got pretty icy during the winter but it usually melted to drivable by about 10AM. I'd say you'd be okay with a civic except for like right after it snows. The highways are usually clear as a whistle
Reno,2uvkah,randyhutton,2,Thu Feb 5 19:42:22 2015 UTC,"Given the last couple winters, it doesn't seem like snow is a concern anymore."
Reno,2uvkah,jdoldno7,2,Fri Feb 6 03:46:59 2015 UTC,"I'm currently doing just that. I moved to Reno from Truckee and still kept my job up there. I'm paying more or less the same rent in Reno for my own place that I was paying to share a place with 2 other people in Truckee.  The drive isn't bad at all and so far there's only been one day this year with chain controls between here and Truckee. Also, I'm down to carpool with anyone that's in the same situation if our schedules work together."
Reno,2uvkah,booyatrive,4,Sat Feb 7 20:30:42 2015 UTC,I actually worked in Truckee for a few months and was having that same thought. I had family that lived in Sacramento so I ended up commuting from there. I also lived in reno for a while and I can tell you it us probably the better way to go for a number of reasons.   Rent is going to be quite a bit cheaper versus California.   The drive is a mere 30 minutes instead of the hour and 20 it is from Sacramento.   Snow is always greater on the California side of the sierra versus the Nevada side so it makes your commute better.   Honestly if you don't mind the shit weather reno is a pretty cool place.

Reno,2uopgr,TheMapesHotel,1 point,Tue Feb 3 22:15:32 2015 UTC,I've been trying to get general info on having my dog neutered but haven't received a call back. Do you have any info on the cost of that? Even a rough estimate?
Reno,2uopgr,bagthree,1 point,Wed Feb 4 02:04:49 2015 UTC,It depends on the size of the dog. But I think it's $50-70 for males. Unless you get in on a special it's pretty comparable to most local vets. Keep calling because the clinic there gets around 400 calls a week and only a couple people work there. They really do want to get everyone in and I know it's frustrating to wait for the call. Making sure to answer your phone is important too. I've done call backs for them and that's a big problem.   You can always stop in and talk to them as well. Sometimes that's faster and easier.
Reno,2uopgr,bagthree,1 point,Wed Feb 4 03:54:27 2015 UTC,Thank you for responding. I think I'll just stop in this week. I'm hoping the prices are reasonable compared to what my current vet quoted me. 200+ bucks! They said they would have to do some tests and stuff. I just want my dog neutered!
Reno,2uopgr,FroggiJoy87,1 point,Wed Feb 4 05:07:25 2015 UTC,"Oh wow okay no they are much cheaper than that! They do offer pre surgery blood work and vaccines but everything (including the ecollars) is totally optional. If you just want a no frills neuter they can handle that no problem.   If you do stop in the clinic is the door on the far right if you are facing the shelter, it's kind of off to the side. They do close a littler earlier than the regular shelter (I think the clinic closes at 4:00 or 5:00) just so you don't go down there to find them closed (I hate making fruitless trips) not only can you find out about the price by going in you can also make an appointment right then and there so you don't have to call again. Good luck, if you have any trouble please let me know and I will see if I can help!"

Reno,2u463v,black_edelweiss,1 point,Fri Jan 30 09:11:25 2015 UTC,Skiing is terrible. 50 degree temps for the last several weeks has made the slopes a terrifying nightmare. I hit a patch of dirt on the black diamond at squaw and tumbled nearly 500 feet down the hill. Luckily there was a paramedic nearby to put me on a stretcher and rush me to the ER in truckee where I was treated for a fractured tailbone and several bruised ribs.
Reno,2u1r00,TheAsgards,4,Thu Jan 29 04:34:33 2015 UTC,"On the topic of critters:  For all practical purposes, roaches don't exist. That's because the black widows keep them in check, and it being high desert and all.  Despite what everyone else has said on the matter, we do have scorpions, although I think I you need to be out in the desert to encounter them. That being said, I've found two IN MY HOUSE over the years.  What you're more likely to find in a house (particularly one with a basement) are house centipedes, another reason why there are virtually no roaches.  Another local favorite you will encounter -- and they will freak you out the first time you see one -- are Jerusalem crickets. Despite appearances, they are harmless."
Reno,2u1r00,thehalfwit,9,Thu Jan 29 07:55:22 2015 UTC,"I have done a fair share of traveling and can tell you, every time I leave Reno, a glass of tap water is never good enough. Reno has by far my favorite, out of the faucet, water."

Reno,2u1r00,starside,6,Thu Jan 29 20:44:18 2015 UTC,"The COL in Reno is way less than Sacramento. Downtown/midtown sac is much more walkable than anywhere you would want to live in Reno, but you have to pay for it. Reno has an up and coming startup scene. Big players like Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, and IGT have/will have operations in the region. Some of the other big employers in the area with tech jobs are Renown Regional Medical Center, Sierra Nevada Corp, Employers Insurance, and the University of Nevada, Reno. Midtown Sac is a hipster, foodie restaurant paradise, but Reno has some pretty good food and it's usually cheaper compared to similar places in Sac. Reno has a college town feel to it and you will see UNR stuff everywhere while Sacramento tends to be a commuter town without much pride for anything. Traffic in Sac can suck ass while Reno's ""traffic"" is laughable if you've lived in a congested city. Sac is hotter during the summer and much milder during the winter. The views in Reno are spectacular, especially during sunset, while Sac is just a boring valley with occasional views of the mountains 70 miles away. I've lived in both and can answer other questions you might have."
Reno,2u1r00,jdoldno7,5,Thu Jan 29 06:29:36 2015 UTC,"I think half the reason more tech companies don't move here is the stigma.  But really the thing I noticed since I've been here is that this could be a Boulder, CO that is even closer to skiing- people just don't know it yet.  Might be about to change though, they are really pushing tech out here.  Another reason tech doesn't move from SF is that COL and such matters much less to a tech company.  Compared to something like manufacturing, he number of employees they have vs. the amount they can bring in means they can pay each employee a ton, to the point where they end up competing in other areas (free food, culture, etc.).  Since they compete so hard for employees, I think they are afraid that if they move to Reno they will be at a disadvantage for recruitment."
Reno,2u1r00,Pangloss09,9,Thu Jan 29 05:33:22 2015 UTC,The real reason more tech companies don't move here is that we have an uneducated workforce and they would have to relocate people from other areas and Reno isn't the easiest sell compared to Seattle/Bay Area.
Reno,2u1r00,ryanseacrust,1 point,Thu Jan 29 15:55:07 2015 UTC,"well yeah, i don't think this is incompatible with my comment."
Reno,2u1r00,Pangloss09,2,Fri Jan 30 03:15:09 2015 UTC,This is just wrong. Companies are setting up shop here. They can pay someone 65k here compared to 100k in the valley and the employee is still coming out ahead.
Reno,2u1r00,jdoldno7,2,Thu Jan 29 06:47:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but what's the 35k difference to a company like Uber?  Most tech companies have to compete for the best software engineers, etc., and Reno is a much tougher sell than SF or SEA when recruiting talent."
Reno,2u1r00,Pangloss09,1 point,Fri Jan 30 03:17:35 2015 UTC,"The people who can get a job with google, fb, twitter, apple, or some famous startup as a software engineer/developer are out of most companies leagues in Reno. A good analogy would be what UNR is to the top schools in the country. Its a good school, but its not Stanford. To compare it to them is unfair. There a plenty of tech jobs here though and there will only be more. Shortstack is an example of a startup that chose Reno because of its proximity to the valley and its cost of living. That trend won't end."
Reno,2u1r00,jdoldno7,4,Fri Jan 30 04:22:19 2015 UTC,You guys are all awesome- I feel like two years ago the threads like this were much less responded to and the responses were far more negative.
Reno,2u1r00,Mustangbex,2,Thu Jan 29 17:13:38 2015 UTC,"Critters are not bad at all unless you're out in the desert, but even then it's not bad. I've never seen a roach or a scorpion anywhere, and I've had exactly zero run-ins with snakes in the 17 years I've lived here.  I'm not super outdoorsy so your odds of snakes would go up if you hit the desert, but I'm pretty sure we don't even have roaches. Minus the black widows, bugs are not an issue, and that's coming from someone who HATES anything with more than 4 legs.  As for biking/pedestrian stuff, certain areas are more friendly than others (downtown/midtown) but there are bike lanes on the major roads all around town.  Edit: air is not typically dusty. Drinking water is pretty ok (drank it for years) but let's face it, a Brita isn't expensive."
Reno,2u1r00,MissMimosa,1 point,Thu Jan 29 04:57:19 2015 UTC,"certain areas of town DO indeed have roaches.   c=Source: Lived on Neil rd when i first moved here because I didn't know any better. Also, peppermill area has roaches, as well as directly downtown, because I see them on the sidewalks."
Reno,2u1r00,elzombino,2,Thu Jan 29 15:55:34 2015 UTC,"How bicycle and pedestrian friendly is Reno? Are there pedestrian paths in the works? I see a lot of bike lanes but very few pedestrian paths. There seems to be a large biking community.  Why don't more tech companies move from California to Reno (and Vegas)? The COL is less and there's no corporate income taxes so they could in theory increase profits. Only 4 hours away from SF bay.** I'm not sure on this one but Microsoft, Intuit and Apple all have offices here. I think you'll see more companies moving here now that Tesla announced they are building the GigaFactory here.** (related to 2) how is the job market in IT?** All my friends in IT have jobs.** What are the up-and-coming areas? Midtown, South Reno. I think the area in East Sparks will see a lot of growth with the GigaFactory How's the drinking water in Reno? It's good Tahoe water. How's the air? Is it dusty? It's not dusty but super dry.  Does Reno have a lot of critters? The one I hate the most are Roaches and I know they're everywhere but I am under the impression that they are less prevalent in drier climates. What about scorpions and snakes? Not a lot of critters here. I've never seen a roach or scorpion here. I've seen one snake in 20 years.  How would you compare Reno to Sacramento? Never lived in Sac. It seems bigger and greener though."
Reno,2u1r00,doppelbock42,2,Thu Jan 29 18:42:33 2015 UTC,"Adding to the anecdotal answers:  1) I live close to downtown, and try to bike/walk frequently.  For a city of Reno's size, I'd say it's very bike/pedestrian friendly.  Obviously not Portland/SF/etc, but there's a large amount of bike lanes, a good size cycling/advocacy community, etc  2) The tech companies haven't hit a critical mass yet.  Zappos moved from the bay to southern Nevada in 2004, but tech just hasn't taken off there.  Reno's a fraction of the size, and while there's a growing startup community (http://renostartuprow.com/) and some companies moving to town (http://www.rgj.com/story/money/business/2015/01/06/clear-capital-moves-to-reno/21344181/), it's not the Bay area, so you don't have that critical mass of talent.    From another point of view, I work as a software QA engineer.  If I lost my job, I think I'd have a hard time finding another similar position (especially if I didn't want to work for a gaming company), though I do think I could find a tech job.    4) Up and coming for what?  Midtown is the restaurant/bar area now a days, lots of gentrification.  East Fourth Street is going through a rebirth too, with 3 breweries/distilleries in the vicinity now, but still a mix of run down/abandoned buildings, strip clubs, and homeless shelters too.  Housing wise, looks like we're seeing an uptick across the board, mainly tied to people banking on Tesla and the gigafactory.  5) Tap water is good.  6) While everyone else is saying it's not that dusty, I'd point out that this is the first place I've lived where if I leave the windows open for a day or two, I'll have a layer of dust/almost sand on my desk that leaves a gritty feel that I have to wipe down with a wet rag or something before using my desk.  I don't notice it while breathing, and my allergies are better here than in the Midwest.  7) I haven't seen any roaches or scorpions in the ~8 years I've been here, and that includes out on the Playa and hiking.  A few snakes, but it's a rare sighting.  8)  I don't know enough about Sac to really make a good comparison."
Reno,2u1r00,hairylunch,4,Thu Jan 29 22:08:40 2015 UTC,"As an important note: I do work in entrepreneurial development so have a pretty high bias towards this city. However, I'll say that I accepted the position because I love this place, not the other way around.  1) Pretty darn bicycle friendly (though as a comparison, I lived in Anchorage before so an extremely not friendly city). I walk a lot of places, but don't use the public transport. I feel we could improve that a lot still. It took some major hits during the recession and hasn't quite caught up to what's needed yet.  2) Again, I'm pretty biased here but we've got quite a few companies that move here. Especially those close to exit because of the income tax difference. I think that there's quite a bit of circle-jerk-ness in Silicon Valley (like the old idea that only a Delaware S-Corp is a good idea - REALLY?) and Reno has been fighting the whole ""Reno-911"" vibe. Again, pretty biased, but as a studying CPA, our structure is so favorable and so close to the bay area, why aren't we attracting more?  3) It seems relatively good. Ruby on rails in particular does well. But I do hear rumblings from those in higher levels of the job market. But I think they may be jaded on the job market from the last ten years or so.  4) Midtown/Old Southwest are THE places to be for both living and hanging out. The Riverside Walk area is working on a revival as well. East Wells is pushed as the next place, but I think it's not quite nice yet - so maybe nice time to invest?  5) Drinking water is fine as long as your pipes are new/good. We routinely have good ratings. And from my understanding, we're still fluoride free. I have a Brita filter but only because my house is 80+ years old and I don't know about the quality of the pipes.  6) I have asthma so take this question to heart (to lungs??). It's dry and clear for the most part. Still can be ahem breath-taking. In the summer if we get fires from California mostly, the air quality can tank. I've never thought of the area as dusty though.  7) I've never seen a roach here. I believe it's too arid for them but am definitely not an entomologist. We have some awesome (in the original sense) spiders and snakes in the hills. But scorpions are pretty uncommon here as well because it gets so cold (again, might not be the actual reason). I'm in Old Southwest and we have raccoons. They're the biggest menace. And then coyotes on the outskirts (sometimes inner city) areas.  8) Better than Sac. For diversity of economy and also no humidity! Sac has a better diversified downtown but we've got a better town in general. It takes about 20min at MOST to get from one end of town to the other during normal traffic. That's unheard of in California.  Anyway, I hope that's at all helpful. Again, I'm pretty biased but I can elaborate on any of these points should you have questions. This area is about to kick even more ass than it does now, so I'm pretty confident you'll love the area!"

Reno,2u1r00,haroldp,4,Thu Jan 29 19:32:26 2015 UTC,"For biking, it's highly area and route dependent. Some areas of town are more than 500 feet higher than others. Bike lanes suffer from inconsistent application by the governing authorities. There are some off street lanes, but those are few.

Reno,2u1r00,Wilderness_doc,0,Thu Jan 29 20:54:05 2015 UTC,For the most part. I don't have data but it wouldn't surprise me that streets with bike lanes are safer for pedestrians as well. Just for the fact that a driver knowing there is a bike lane is going to be more aware of crosswalks.  Maybe I am just really optimistic. A problem I have been known to have.
Reno,2u1r00,wartornhero,1 point,Thu Jan 29 21:16:14 2015 UTC,"What the data I am aware of shows is that cities where biking is common has a relative safety increase. But cities with unseparated bicycle infrastructure and relatively common US rates of cycling show cyclists are less safe because of driver inattention. This is even true when the cyclist is wearing hi vis and well lit.   Essentially, with Reno's infrastructure, there is a chicken and egg problem with safety. People won't cycle because it's not 'safe', and drivers won't look for them to increase relative safety until there are more cyclists.   What I'd love is for Reno to take a stand and say we're going to make this area a biking Mecca by following European city best practices for cycling infrastructure development and the auto/bike interface."
Reno,2u1r00,Wilderness_doc,1 point,Fri Jan 30 15:44:30 2015 UTC,"What I'm most interested in are dedicated bike and pedestrian paths, especially if they connect neighborhoods. In Pinellas County, FL they have the Pinellas Trail which is really cool. Phoenix has a big trail that loops around the city and Sacramento has the trails along the American River. Of course, NYC has these, including dedicated paths over bridges which is really neat.   My favorite: pedestrian bridges over highways. This prevents highways and interstates from cutting neighborhoods completely off."
Reno,2u1r00,hairylunch,0,Mon Feb 2 00:44:44 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that we've got a large cycling advocacy community, but change is slow.    We've got a fair number of bicycle advocacy groups and cycling bloggers, and the city tries new things, though they move slowly, as does most government stuff . . .   NDOT half-heartedly tried a bike boulevard on Riverside (http://reno-rambler.blogspot.com/2014/08/bbino-bicycle-boulevard-in-name-only.html) and they're trying out green bike boxes on Kietzke."
Reno,2u1r00,wartornhero,2,Fri Jan 30 00:52:53 2015 UTC,"2.) I am wondering if it is a lack of educated work force. It seems tech companies in the bay area can get anyone to move if they try hard enough. The work force is one reason the tesla deal was so up in the air, we thought we had lost it because they couldn't get enough well educated workers. That said, Reno tech center is growing ... and fast. The recent midtown/river walk revival along with maker-type locations such as the Generator and Reno Collective is making Reno a great place for start-ups. In fact a couple of places pin it in the top 10 places (other than the really big tech hubs such as SF/Seattle) to start a high tech business. Add in stuff like Nevada was the first state to allow commercial FAA testing. getting Apple to open a data center and getting Tesla to build the gigafactory here will only move to drive more technology here. I want to say right before and right after Tesla announced there were 2-3 other tech companies that were in truckee or LA that announced they were moving to Reno. The one possibly ""bad"" tick about nevada is how they treated Uber when they tried to move into the area. That said, I don't know if I agree with Uber's argument and they seem to be run by a bunch of asshats.  3.) Like I said it is up and coming. Right now there isn't much. There may be IT jobs in the microsoft license building. the 2 main slot makers here in Reno, IGT and Bally that hire a pretty decently sized IT force. Also the casinos hire a decent amount of IT people to run the server based gaming systems. Someone said, IT is really vague, I agree. We also have intuit here I am not sure if it is a call center or licensing.  4.) I already mentioned the up and coming areas. Primarily midtown and river walk/idlewild area.  8.) I haven't spent much time in Sacramento. The couple times I did I spent 4-5 hours in traffic to go 10 miles (over exaggerating but you get the picture) Reno traffic is 1/100th of sacramento and most places are 15-20 minutes drive from wherever you are. And the cost of living is 1/1000th of sacramento and the bay area. And to be honest I can't justify the cost of either of those living in Reno. I love the city, now more than ever with the continuation of moving away from ""gambling, marriage and divorce capital"" of the 1960s to focusing on proximity to tahoe, food, and beer (3-4 new breweries opened last year I want to say another 2 opened in the last 2 months)"
Reno,2u1r00,bjisthefish,1 point,Thu Jan 29 17:17:27 2015 UTC,"I can only answer a few of your questions. I moved here from the Bay area and my skill set (writing/editing) is definitely not in demand but from what I hear IT is pretty good.  I lived my first 29 years in N. Texas and cannot believe how critter-free this place is. If you hate critters, it's right for you. I was able to buy a house here because I bought in 2010 when the market was nearing the bottom. Have seen a few spiders and that's all. Back in Texas critters of many kinds were a huge issue. Less so in the Bay but here they don't seem to like it.   The tap water is fantastically drinkable as others have said. Best I've had.   If you have a good job prospect I'd highly recommend moving here. It's very close to great hiking and skiing and not very far from San Fran if you need a culture fix. The people are friendly. My allergies go nuts when the sage is in bloom but otherwise the air quality is great. Even then I have to admit the sage smells good. I love it here."
Reno,2u1r00,Sn0zzberries,1 point,Fri Jan 30 05:25:59 2015 UTC,"Another question: Why is housing somewhat expensive, when the high paying jobs are not overly abundant and the climate is not up to California or PNW standards?   I was looking for a 3bed/2bath with a decent master suite (separate shower and toilet closet), in a pleasant neighborhood in the burbs for under $200k and it doesn't really seem that doable."
Reno,2u1r00,statikuz,1 point,Mon Feb 2 00:52:14 2015 UTC,"1) Not bad, but certainly not the best. Most roads have decent enough shoulders and there are groups. There are good walking paths in the parks, but no long ones really. Hiking is highly available though.  2) My opinion, climate, infrastructure, politics, and personnel. You have a normal climate in the bay/sac areas. Reno is sort of a climate question mark. Reno's infrastructure certainly doesn't get as much love as some cities in CA. Nevada is a more conservative area and usually lags behind CA in most political aspects. As well, Reno is not that big of an populous, wrong side of the Sierras.   3) Good, depending on your skill set. You can find reasonable paying jobs, but it is highly dependent on your skill set and your preferred industry.  4) Northwest, South, Downtown/Midtown and Sparks are the main areas where you will see huge changes in the next decade or two.  5) Not bad, but you will use a water filter.  6) Air quality is normally pretty good, occasionally there is noticeable smog or smoke. Dust isn't a huge factor, but allergies may be.  7) Critters is pretty clean, nothing of note in my experiences. It is a dry and cold climate.  8) Reno is smaller, and as such has less of all the aspects you are interested in. But being smaller there is also much less BS you have to deal with. Sacramento also has huge economic divides (not to say Reno doesn't), but in my opinion the greater sac area has more of a geographical economic disparity than a purely monetary. e.g. there are areas where it is only high incomes."
Reno,2u1r00,neo_syzygy,8,Thu Jan 29 05:38:38 2015 UTC,"5) Not bad, but you will use a water filter.   Really? Is it bad in some parts of town? I drink it all over the place and never mind."

They're building a new giant data center out there, Apple already has one and is expanding it I think. Of course everyone's raving about Tesla. It's not as hip of a place to have a software development company as the bay area, Seattle, Portland, Austin, etc. but the area is making other strides.  It depends on your skills - ""IT"" is a little vague. Help desk stuff? Data center? Sysadmin? Developer?   I think the water's fine. It's clear and doesn't have floatys in it.  The air can be dusty if the wind really gets going but it isn't in general. It is a very dry area so if you have issues in that area you might want to be aware.  Hardly any critters compared to, say, the South. Snakes out in the desert. Not sure about scorpions, never seen them. Certainly not like you'd expect in Vegas or Phoenix for example. There's the occasional little spiders and stuff but nothing super creepy in my experience. Reno is relatively high altitude and I think the cold helps keep away most crawlies."

Crap South/Southwest Reno industrial area Chlorin-ey and HARD. But I prefer it to alkaline water like there is in CA, Utah. Ew. Crisp and clear... Dusty? nahhhhh. Not that kind of desert. None worth mentioning. (other than the rabid black widow population on my front stoop.) Crickets... I've only ever seen like two roaches living my entire life here. Jerusalem crickets in the desert but you wont see them unless you look. You'll see non-venemous snakes frequently in the outskirts of town. Lots of bullsnakes. A rattlesnake or two if you're WAY out there. Not a lot of scorpions. I see one tiny guy like once every 5 years.  It's kind of dirtier, drunker, less industrialized, more intimate. Hipster-ish. Lots of gambling tourism.    Let me know if you have any more questions."
Reno,2u0ca0,markvii,8,Wed Jan 28 21:44:34 2015 UTC,"Heritage inside of Whitney Peak Hotel has the ""Got Game"" Nightly special where they change their game choice daily and open roast it.   This article has this to say about Bricks Restaurant and Wine Bar:   Exceptional cuisine by chef/owner Steve Budija and expert wine pairing make this restaurant a Reno highlight. One-of-a-kind in its incorporation of wild game dishes (featuring elk, buffalo, and venison) and fresh seafood, this restaurant is anything but ordinary.   Midtown Eats serves bison and elk burgers for lunch and dinner. I'd recommend that for lunch before your night out or for the day after.

Heritage is a good (from what I've heard), slightly more upscale place that puts you in the center of downtown Reno, close to clubs and other casinos. Brasserie is a rustic, yet refined brew pub  right in the middle of Midtown, putting you walking distance to some of the best bars in what's become the hippest part of town.

Reno,2u0ca0,doerr24,2,Thu Jan 29 03:59:22 2015 UTC,"For a bachelor party, I'd pick St. James Brasserie over Heritage . . . Heritage feels like a bit older crowd, more subdued, and the bar is tucked in the back.  Brasserie's got two bars, with everything around them, and much more of a social/bar feel than Heritage which is more of a restaurant.  In any case, these locations are only about a mile apart . . . longish walk or a short cab ride between the two, which is true for Midtown (the trendy/bar/restaurant part of down) to downtown (casinos) in general"

Reno,2tybt9,Oseirus,6,Wed Jan 28 11:25:12 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't walk around the Peppermill area of town at all. There's practically nothing around that immediate part of town to see or do and it's just not the best part of town. Stay in the casino, which probably won't really be your cup of tea if you don't like noise or crowds (it'll be a zoo on the weekends) or take a cab to the river area, that can be nice to walk around and find some different places to stop in and eat or drink."

Reno,2tybt9,statikuz,3,Wed Jan 28 14:42:34 2015 UTC,"If your wife is into that sort of thing, you could spring for any of the spa stuff at the Peppermill or Atlantis. Atlantis one is super nice and I think the Peppermill is equal but I have not been there. Good way to kill an afternoon or whatever and just chill out."
Reno,2tybt9,2774,3,Wed Jan 28 14:57:07 2015 UTC,"If you walk to the west of the peppermill, one block over is Virginia Lake, a nice and safe pedestrian walking place, but that's the only thing really within walking distance. If you cab it up into downtown, which is like $8 ish, you can hit the food places like Campo and Brassiere St. James etc. (there are a ton of new awesome eateries), the movies are there, the car museum in the day time, the river front stuff, a couple parks, the ice rink at night, the art museum, strip joints, and the second street bars ( which are notable for being an old haven for the bikers, but are now perfectly safe). Best of luck and welcome!"
Reno,2tybt9,you-ole-polecat,3,Wed Jan 28 15:46:45 2015 UTC,"For the most part I agree with what the above redditor said, but if you two do want to grab a nearby cocktail or some good wings, there's a bar called Clary's right across the street from the Peppermill (on Virginia) that's a good spot for that sort of thing.  It's a nice place, not a dive.  Also, I'd stay away from Virginia Lake after dark.  Daytime, it's fine.  As for the area right around the Peppermill, don't be misled, it's not a complete sketchy shithole or anything.  Just not a lot of stuff to do."
Reno,2tybt9,Talilove,2,Wed Jan 28 19:50:54 2015 UTC,"If you stay at the Peppermill they have a nightclub and they also have a spa. If you're looking for something to do at night you definitely need to cab it over to downtown. The northern end of downtown is where all the main casinos are such as Eldorado, Siver Legacy, and Circus Circus. What's nice about these three is that they're all connected from the inside so you can start in one and walk all your way through. Circus Circus would have a small carniva/game area if that's something you would be interested in but it's usually full of a bunch of punk kids. Silver Legacy has the big moneymaking machine which is interesting to look at and there's a couple of bars that are really nice. To me personally I think the Eldorado has the best restaurants they have a very good buffet and they have a really nice Italian fine dining restaurant. If you're looking for something a little bit more chill the Eldorado has a martini bar called Roxy's that will have someone on the piano playing. The Eldorado also has a magic show going on right now that looks like it might be really cool, though I haven't seen it.   If you go to little bit more south of downtown that's where you're going to find all the bars. Between the casinos and Midtown there's bar such as Ceol, Imperial,  St. James infirmiry, 1864 (plus more). The Midtown area is going to have some bars such as Chapel, Death and Taxes, and ZBar. I highly recommend all these bars and they're a lot of fun to go to. Also in this area if it's something that you and your wife are into is a strip club called the Wild Orchid. If you're in the area it's hard to miss.   If you're looking for somewhere to eat I highly recommend one of the restaurants in one of the casinos or one of the restaurants in the midtown area. The midtown areas kind of our hipster area and all the restaurants are local and they often focus on getting foods that are from the local area"

Reno,2tybt9,FilXeno,1 point,Wed Jan 28 20:35:24 2015 UTC,"All of Reno is reasonably safe at night, but there is nothing to do on foot near the Peppermill anyway.  10-15 minute cab ride will get you just about anyplace in Reno.  Downtown and midtown have a ton of good bars and restaurants.  Midtown is more grown up and will probably be less crowded.  St. james brasserie, 1864, and Chapel are some of my favorites in the area.  One of my favorite places to eat in town is Maurice's Naan and Kaban which is right across the street from the Peppermill.  He makes some of the best Mediterranean food Ive ever had.  Make sure to get desert too.  Edit:  The Peppermill may have a complementary shuttle service.  I pretty sure they have one too and from the airport, but they may also have one to downtown Reno.  They may also have one that goes up to one of the ski areas."

Reno,2tvqww,prelimar,0,Wed Jan 28 04:40:04 2015 UTC,Well that's what my friend told me so I may be wrong. It doesn't mean much that the building was condemned. They would have to rebuild the interior no matter what. They did it to my frat house back in the 80s. They just hallow it out and rebuild the inside. Even though I don't think the mason building is anything spectacular architecturally. (It needs way more windows. ) Me and my buddy were talking about how it would make a great art gallery that wouldn't have to significantly change the feel of the building
Reno,2tvqww,jojofroyo,2,Wed Jan 28 05:04:13 2015 UTC,"it's a beautiful example of turn of the century brickwork, i think. the bricks might even have been made here in town, but i don't know that for sure. if they can save the facade at least, that would be something. my guess is the original tin ceilings are inside there, too."
Reno,2tvqww,prelimar,2,Wed Jan 28 14:45:14 2015 UTC,I think what you are referring to are the tunnels that connect the casinos. Years ago (many years ago) the casinos use to transfer money back and forth between the different casinos. Instead of moving money above ground they would transfer it thru the tunnels.

Reno,2tbjso,raka_defocus,2,Thu Jan 22 20:01:20 2015 UTC,That's a good start! Does it snow often in the winter? I never seen the snow either _
Reno,2tbjso,raven12456,8,Thu Jan 22 20:05:36 2015 UTC,"It's hard to give an accurate answer since the last few winters have been off. We might get snow every few weeks. It might stick, it might not. It could snow a foot or two and stay around for most the winter.   Or, it would be like this winter where it's snowed a handful of times and it's never really stuck. We were in the 60s earlier this week.   TL;DR- It will snow, and you will have to walk/drive/travel in it. But we can't tell you how often."

Places like Spanish Springs, Cold Springs, South Reno or the Sparks area may end up being a bit of a commute for you.   Theres plenty of housing near the University. It's not the best neighborhood because it's a bit close to downtown, but theres lots of students who live around there and most have a pretty good experience living around there. Midtown is our trendy area. It looks a little rough because it use to be a rough area, but now it's filled with some great places to eat, some nice bars, and some local fun stores.   The northwest area is probably the closest suburban areas to the University."

It took me 3 weeks to find a decent apartment (I'm in Carson City now). Depending on when you come out here if you need a place to stay while you scope out apartments a casino during the weekdays can be incredibly cheap.

Next week I see a guy getting the above and asked what IT was. He said the best mac n cheez on the planet. I said ...no way, I already tried it and it wasnt THAT. So he winks and says...its not on the menu. Gotta know to ask for Mac n cheez with barley crusted chicken. So I tried it the other night. Mac N Cheez were cheesy and moist. Chicken breast is baked and kept moist then rolled in their leftover malted barley from brewing with a dash of garlic and black pepper and this is pan seared.

At first, the house prices were too good to pass up (we got in before everything crashed). Then the crash happened and houses were being foreclosed like it was going out of style. Then the renters came. Then the crime rate went up. Then we got the fuck out of there.  Cold Springs has NOTHING for a teenager to do. They will be bored and idle hands are no good. If you shop in Woodland Village, you'll notice great parks and close proximity to schools! YAY - except for the absentee-parented teens who run the parks. They vandalize things, they break into cars, tear down lampposts, have sex in the park in FULL view of younger kids. It's vile.  There were so many plans for Cold Springs that included shopping, recreation and the like. But with the crash, that all stopped and no plans to move forward exist.  We made the best friends/neighbors we could ever have out there, yet we still moved away. For me, that says a lot.  Reconsider and put down your roots elsewhere. IMHO, of course."

Reno,2szhvq,Talilove,3,Tue Jan 20 05:39:24 2015 UTC,"I grew up in Cold Springs, went to cold springs middle, and north valleys. Cold Springs itself is a community that is almost unbeatable in the Reno area. People are incredibly nice and laid back and will look out for you. Literally the only thing I didn't like about it out there was the drive. (You're gonna spend a lot of gas $) but it's dead quiet out there and incredibly peaceful. In fact my brother and fiance just night a house out there for all the pros and that it's a great place to raise kids. The schools are actually pretty nice and get a bad rep simply because they're on a lower income spectrum, but I always felt like it was different than what you'd think low income areas are. The valleys are much more rural than the city and the people are too. It's more like red necks as opposed to gang bangers."

When I purchased my house I looked into High School as my #3 concern (following neighborhood, and price) I have 3 young children, so it is possible that things will change by the time that they get there, but that is much much less likely for you lol.   I choose McQueen  I live just inside the McCarren loop, off of 7th. Its pretty quiet, except for the highway. Close to shopping, food, pharmacy.  The highway here is a blessing and a curse. It takes me about 3 minutes to get to the ramp, but I can hear the sirens on it on occasion. Not a huge deal to me at all. More of a Blessing than a Curse.   My plan was to buy in Cold Springs because price vs space ratio was awesome, but, we changed our minds for a few reasons. 1. There is NOTHING close by. No drug store you can run to if your daughter needs some Tylenol or tampons. 2. A lot of the houses out that way that I saw did have an HoA of some sort. I have a pitbull, so HoA and I are not friendly a lot of the time (not to say that ALL of them are HoA, or that ALL HoA are bigots) and 3. The school.

Reno,2synai,bivalve_attack,5,Mon Jan 19 19:00:18 2015 UTC,"I consider myself a serious amateur photographer (have had a few gallery shows and some stuff in print), and as someone who has shot a few weddings, I think that $3200 is a reasonable amount (especially if that includes .jpg's or printed images after the wedding).  You are paying for a number of things:  Their time. Prep time. The rehearsal dinner, the wedding, the reception. All the time spent editing. A very solid 20+ hours can be spent working a single wedding shoot.  Their equipment. Good photos requires expensive gear. A friend with a Canon Rebel and a 50mm lens is not going to get the same shots as a professional level SLR with a variety of pro-level lenses and lighting gear. In order to get that gear and keep up with it, they have to charge appropriately.  Their experience. You are only going to get married once (hopefully). Meaning, the photographer has one chance to get these shots. Sometimes the lighting is bad, or an unexpected event occurs (grandpa is on the dancefloor?!) and an experienced photographer will be able to get the shot. A less-experienced one will hand you a blurry/noisy mess (if they shoot it at all).  I am not saying you should or should not pay that much for a photographer. You can only afford what you can afford. I totally get that. I just wanted to offer up some explanation why it costs what it does and why it might be worth considering. Just my 2 cents though. Either way, good luck with your wedding and photos."

Reno,2sr2oi,abelarcher,3,Sat Jan 17 18:13:27 2015 UTC,"There are clothing optional beaches at Tahoe, but it is not a place for ""swinging"".  No one goes there to hook-up, flirt, look at each other, or to do anything perverted.  It's about getting a full tan and being natural in a natural environment.  The people there are a mixed group of older locals, college-aged kids, and hippie types.  It's a very safe place for lone females, because everyone looks out for each others well-being.  If someone is being super creepy, one of the beach veterans will step in to make sure everyone feels comfortable and safe.  Or if you don't mind rocks, you can find a private cove so you don't have to deal with anyone.  These areas are located south of Thunderbird lodge: Skunk harbor, Secret harbor, and Chimney Beach...which are visible on Google maps.  Chimney is more about parties and drinking...Skunk and Secret are more about being nude.  It requires a steep hike down, so I would recommend only bringing 1 backpack per person.  The water is very cold and only becomes tolerable in late August.    Also...please remember to pack-up your trash on your way out.  As the locals say: ""pack it in, pack it out""."

The hamburger often goes on sale and would be ideal for tallow. Cook at 350 degrees and feed the scraps to dogs if you have them. Or use the leftover meat for taco's/recipes.

Not quite professional go kart level but fast enough that they require the use of helmets. If you're asking price it is considerably more at Need2Speed although I don't recall the exact numbers.

No worries about choking down some ones else's exhaust from a gas powered kart 2. They have a larger torque to weight ratio than that of its gas powered counterpart. This means some strong on demand acceleration. The only thing is that they do have some heavy understeer. But you get used to it and after a few laps the tires will warm up and it will be less noticeable.  Also since they are indoors, track conditions remind more consistent and are not as effected by weather and such.  Either way have fun!"

Reno,2sf3o4,fife55,6,Wed Jan 14 22:51:56 2015 UTC,"Burning Man has pretty much said it prefers rich people. They pay more, and Burning Man can give more grants, and create more art.  It's interesting to watch Burning Man change from a ragtag group of artists relying on their own ingenuity, to a haven for the well-off who are able to purchase preferential treatment. Not coincidentally, it parallels the changes San Francisco is going through."
Reno,2sf3o4,WESTC0ASTbestcoast,4,Wed Jan 14 18:13:35 2015 UTC,"It costs $390 for the general sale. The $800 prices are for the pre-sale.  The only difference is the price of the ticket. The event is guaranteed to sell out.  Since most people will try their luck with the general sale, the pre-sale is for those willing to spend double to secure their ticket.  And it's not about bartering.  It's just a rule that no one can sell or advertise anything.  You don't barter or trade shit at burning man.  You just give if you want to."

I've only gone late at night and that was scary enough.  But a friend of mine went in the late afternoon/early evening.  He walked in the bar and everyone stopped mid-conversation turned around and just stared at him.  They obviously knew he wasn't from there.  The bartender came around from the bar and walked up to him, asked him what business he had up there.  He said he was just exploring around wanted a drink before heading back.  The bartender wouldn't serve him, and basically hinted that he should leave sooner rather than later, saying ""During the day everything is pretty ordinary around here, but at night it's a different story.""

Reno,2rkni4,rjp911,14,Wed Jan 7 00:25:20 2015 UTC,"Which one at Atlantis?   I would personally suggests the Steak House at Harrahs. It can get real pricey real quick, so if you're not trying to go too big it may not be the best option. It's my favorite true, straight-shooter SH though. They also do a early bird thing for like $30 from 5-6 (IIRC).  You can't really go wrong with Sterling. It's pretty awesome, good steaks as well, if you want surf and turf it's awesome.   As for a few other options (and some outside of casinos, if you don't want to deal with them, sorry if my links are mobile I'm on my phone! :():  Seafood  Rapscallions  website. A personal favorite. Very reminiscent of old school Upscale SF seafood places (Think Scoma's). Dark atmosphere, but not necessarily super quiet due to very friendly staff and (usually) a lovely bar. Great bar, in fact, great drinks. Seafood specials are kinda the way to go but they also have good pastas and classic dishes.   Ichiban Tepanyaki restaurant, so not a traditional steakhouse, but very good for both land and sea. Can definitely be a fun experience but if you're looking for something a little more private this won't be for you. If you guys want to have a more upbeat dinner, try some new stuff and meet some people, this would. Be a fine option. More here  Steak/Traditional  Bricks website here I've always looked at bricks as the Land-based counterpart to rapscallions. Smaller, more intimate atmosphere with a somewhat lively bar (Amazing wine list). Menu is a tad small but everything on it is amazing, like 10/10 amazing. If it's in season (maybe too early?) the Abalone appetizer is super recommended. It can be super pricey and it can also be super reasonable. Definitely has a few fish items but mostly land, great steaks, and sometimes things like Buffalo and Elk.   4th St Bistro This place is awesome and tucked away in a remote part of town. If you don't want to deal with loud casinos or traffic this is probably your best spot. French food, but has great filet if you really want that steak. Also recommend the Duck. Full menu and directions here"

I have only eaten there once but it was delicious. My buddy just had his engagement dinner here. You can probably save a few $ and get the same quality of service as the casino steakhouses, although the steaks are probably less aged (although when I went I had the peppercorn NY and it was one of the better I've ever had). It's right down the street from 4th St Bistro*, so again, it's out of your way if you are straying downtown (especially PMill or Atlantis) but it's worth the drive if you're looking for somewhere a little more quiet (although the bar here can get going on weekend nights). website here  Fun:  Fuego Tapas bar. website My dad loves steak as much as the next dude but he also gets bored with me taking him to the same place (usually Harrahs) multiple times a year for things, so I got creative and took him here once and he loved it. It's just a really, really great tapas place. Tons of wine and other cocktails, too. Small place but lively atmosphere. Conveniently Downtown. 100% get the lobster and the filet things.

Reno,2rkni4,xbyzk,2,Wed Jan 7 03:26:07 2015 UTC,"I can't say who has the best, but I am from the SF area as well and have been to both Atlantis Steakhouse and Sterlings.   Atlantis steakhouse was fine. I had comps so I treated my bro there and we both pigged out. The steak was good, but nothing mind blowing or even memorable at all.   Sterlings was a lot better. Yet again more comps, but this time it was $100 resort credit and I was staying at Silver Legacy by myself. I figured why not live it up, buy a big juicy ribeye, king crab mac n cheese, and a bottle of wine to myself haha. I ordered med-rare, but it came out med-well, so they comped my $50 steak (it was $50 because i added the cajun style) and gave me a new one cooked perfectly this time. Much more tender and flavorful than Atlantis. I savored every bite while sipping down that bottle of wine.  That said, even though I haven't tried it yet, I'd probably opt for Harrah's Steakhouse since I keep hearing that its one is the best one in town from family members and friends who live in Reno."

Or as much of my male friends say ""you have to settle for chubbier women or one that already has kids and a divorce"".  Still, I think it depends on what you have to offer and what you put out there.  I'm happily married now but am recruited to help a few single friends out on meeting people.    I would say that as long as you are employed, have good hygiene (seriously, my girlfriends joke that all they want is a guy with all his teeth), and have social hobbies and interests you'll do fine.  If you're more introverted you might have a harder time as I don't think Reno is that great for online dating/matching sites.

Different scenario entirely if he's talking about bars on the casino floor, but that wasn't made clear.

Lots of good ayce places, ranging from casino buffets, chinese buffets, indian buffets, sushi buffets.  Downtown has a lot of bars, but for things other than coors, they have definite specialties.  Martinis in the Eldo, usually with a live piano player. Rumbullions has bands, and some nice group drinks of rum base.  Waterfall has Hookah, big chill spot, decent pricing last i remember. Occasionally has comedy.  3rd street band, comedy, beer.  Hookava serves beer, and hookah. nice chill spot.  I tend to enjoy the little casinos more.  Gold N silver.  Bonanza has some great midnight-early morning specials.  Pretty cheap craps tables, too.   Reno doesn't have too many trees, but the arbortorium at San rafael park is nice.  UNR southern campus is pretty.  If you just go out into the sticks on any side, the Strip can look pretty cool from the mountains. Go far enough and you can start blappin stuff."

Reno,2qqo5q,Bathtubhero,1 point,Tue Dec 30 11:11:22 2014 UTC,"here is a copy pasta of his ad for the place. his room is one of the lower floors. im sure you've seen us around as we're always creepin in the lobby and going in and out of that place.    I'll be renting my condo in Park Tower in January. Here's some quick facts:  It's got hardwood floors for Tom Cruise impersonation nights.  It's got a BBQ that I'm taking with me, but at least you'd know it was there once.  An episode of Sex and the City was once filmed there (or watched there by someone who just broke up with their boyfriend ... I don't remember clearly) It's one bedroom, one bath, with running water, electric lightbulbs, closets for putting things in and a balcony on the 4th floor (not high enough to jump from if things get rough for you, sorry).  It's all the rage: The press says it's a killer spot for all the DT crawls, Artown events, biking, running, drinking pints on the river, drinking pints at the many bars you can skip to, drinking pints at Food Truck Fridays, etc. Don't drink? That's OK, we're not renting to Mormons at the moment.  Its papers say it's purebred.  You can party on the roof! Don't party? See above, Mormons.  It's 500 square feet (plus or minus 500 square feet). So, it's great for people who work, people who don't, cute couples who like living intimately. divorcees, people who took geometry, fit people, not-so-fit people (I can leave the couch in exchange for a 12-pack), people who like Queen Latifah (but ARE NOT Queen Latifah), people who talk with their mouths open and can't find girlfriends, players who can, people who have been to Boston, people who like to pay bills, and people who majored in English even!  Hear what the people are saying: ""Best place to ride an elevator and bond with buddies over Xbox"" -Roger Block ""I wouldn't be the person I am without having spent time in this condo"" Robbie Wimer ""Have you seen Rocky II? It's triumphant like that, except at the end your face isn't all smashed in"" Mason Vonnahme  I'll post pictures when I take some, but really writing this should be vivid and clear enough ... so you can probably go ahead and cut your first rent check ($800, maybe $775 if you say something nasty about Sidney Crosby (F that guy, Go Flyers).  Know someone who is interested but isn't you? Share this with them so you can hang out in this asbestos-free condo.  Have pets? Ugh, I'll make an exception if you're doing in-house animal testing ""for work."" Fish are OK, but not those stupid fighting ones that come in individual plastic cups everyone had in high school, those are retarded.  I think everything is answered here, but I'm sure you'll come up with something really ignorant to ask, like what year was it built (who cares, you aren't buying it ... you're just making bad decisions in it for a while). Oh, parking? Kind of, it's across the street, so you'll have to put one of your big clown feet in front of the other each morning (ohhh the humanity). Parking is an extra $50 unless you send a hand-written letter to Sidney Crosby telling him how big of a piece of sh*t he is (SERIOUSLY, F that guy, Go Flyers).  There's no free cable or free Playboy channel, but ditzy drunk girls spill out of Imperial Bar about 2 a.m. every Saturday, like clockwork.  OK, ready to do this? Ready to get your work/live/party on? Sorry again Mormons, we're just not into Voodoo at this time.  Disclaimer: Everything above was all in good fun; if it's not for you, it's not for you (and you're likely someone who is uptight and doesn't pay their bills and wants me to rush over every time you clog the toilet after a bender). Please share this around, it would help and I'll throw a Flyers viewing party at a local bar and invite everyone who shares (first beer is on me)."

I don't have a car which makes going anywhere East of McCarren difficult.

Reno,2q88af,thehalfwit,1 point,Wed Dec 24 03:01:39 2014 UTC,Just got into town. Where can I find out more about this event?
Reno,2q88af,IrieMars,1 point,Sat Dec 27 03:55:03 2014 UTC,"Your best bet is probably here.  This is an annual showcase featuring Reno's most renowned comics. The host, Pat Shillito, has been handling that responsibility at 3rd Street's weekly open mic for over a year, while leading showcases at the Knitting Factory and appearing at Catch a Rising Star, among other venues. Prior hosts -- Wayne Walsh and Kinsie Damon, who got the whole thing started some 6-7 years ago -- are also featured, as are Reno's ""brand name"" comics, such as Adam Stone.  As far as I know, the show should start around 9:30, but you want to be there at 9:00 at the latest, because so far I have squat info.  FYI, comedy at 3rd Street is a pretty big deal. There are dozens and dozens of comics in the immediate vicinity, and all of them are fighting for a piece of that stage. A lot (probably most) of the comics that pass through town will do guest sets, apart from the really big names at the casinos. But who wants to pay through the nose to see them when you've got real up-and-coming-talent a modest cover charge away?  I have no clue what the cover is or when it kicks in. My best guess is $5 at 8:00.  Directions: from I-80 head South on Sierra Street; immediately beyond the El Dorado parking garage, turn right on 3rd Street and find a place to park -- because it's right there.  If you're not on I-80, get to where you can follow the same directions."

Reno,2q4yf3,Rowdy10,5,Tue Dec 23 03:18:54 2014 UTC,"Internet pretty much is Charter from what I understand. Isn't great but I've heard the others are worse. Charter is the main cable. I have DirecTV now for cable and it's better of course more expensive.   There is a lot to do for families or single people here. With Tahoe and the Sierras right next door there are lots of outdoorsy things to do in all seasons. Every kind of skiiing, snowboarding, hiking, going to the beach, camping, is within an hour or 90 minute's drive. Lots of shooting places in the dessert if that's your scene also. And Quadding.  There are places like the Coconut Bowl with bowling, laser tag, video game arcade and lots of stuff like that. Tons of good restaurants for families and many great  places  for more sophisticated foodie types.  Not a huge art scene here but we're working on it. Lots of pushes to make the arts scene more lively. And an easy jump off to Sacramento or San Francisco to enjoy finer arts if you need an opera or something.   Cost of living is great. Low paying jobs are the other side of that coin. But if you or a family member has something good lined up, I really recommend living here.  People are friendlier here than anywhere I've ever lived. Summers are pretty mild and you get winters but so far I've not seen a harsh one in four years. Bit of snow here and there. Not too much.   There are variations to the types of neighborhoods like anywhere else. If you come around you'll see easily where the more pleasant neighborhoods are. What's going to be comfortable for you depends on what you are looking for and you don't say in your question what that is. I'm pretty happy I moved here."
Reno,2q4yf3,bjisthefish,2,Tue Dec 23 03:52:40 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the long response! Luckily my SO has a better job than I do, which is one big reason we might be making the move.   We would be moving from San Antonio, Texas so its good to hear that the people there are nice too. I think its a south / southwest thing, like the sun makes people nicer generally or something.  Not too worried about the art scene, but we do enjoy some unique restaurants from time to time when we have a babysitter. Really excited at the idea of being able to be outdoors more often. San Antonio is the worst kind of heat in that it never cools off in the summer (100 during the day, 99 at night). I usually don't mind the heat, but I do like a break sometimes."

Reno,2q4yf3,TehShopko,2,Tue Dec 23 17:43:25 2014 UTC,"Big enough that it has a growing art community, foodie / restaurant community, craft breweries and mixology bars, festivals for everything from classic cars, to ribs, to Earth Day, to a month long Art Town. The casinos even bring a bit more with some national shows, a little high end shopping, and fancy steak houses (though most Renoites might tend to avoid the casino culture).   Small enough that you will run into friends, acquaintances, (ex lovers), and anyone else you've gotten to know on a regular basis.    So that Biggest Little City title is actually true.   ...and then there's the all you can eat sushi..."

South Reno gets some mosquitos in the summer but it's nothing like the southern states.  The only thing I miss is summer thunderstorms.  We don't really get much for thunderstorms here, but we also don't get car - denting hail either.  :)   I love it here."

Second, is northwest Reno near McQueen. This is a little bit older but still very nice and McQueen is a good school. Third, is Spanish Springs.

Reno,2q1bhh,hairylunch,2,Mon Dec 22 05:50:47 2014 UTC,+1 for Albitas. Also family owned and operated. An example of how highly I think of them: was the first food I wanted when I came back from an overseas deployment a few years ago. And their chips are made there and are my favorite so far. Interested to hear other's opinion.

Off rushhour about 10 mins quicker. It also varies depending on where you're going actually.

Reno,2po2en,bangsecks,1 point,Thu Dec 18 23:06:38 2014 UTC,How bad are the winter storms out there? Where I live we frequently get lake effect snow and snowstorms so I'm fairly used to commuting in the snow.
Reno,2po2en,koreanforrabbit,1 point,Thu Dec 18 16:56:14 2014 UTC,"Our weather can be very unpredictable because of the altitude and the nearby mountains. The outlying areas generally get more snow, but likely less than you're used to-the Great Basin and Truckee Meadows gets something like 300 days of sun a year. We have major wind storms more and freeway between Reno and Carson can occasionally be closed/treacherous because of the wind. I know quite a lot of people who do the commute and it's no big deal."
Reno,2po2en,Hakuthedj,1 point,Thu Dec 18 20:32:37 2014 UTC,"Overall probably not as bad as you are used to down here in the valleys. It usually warms up inbetween storms and melts most of which we get, which tends to be just a few inches. The weather varies a lot, so you can go from 6 inches of snow to 50 degrees in just a couple days.   But the drive between Carson City and Reno goes through Washoe Valley which has very high winds along with lots of snow when storms come through. Also, its about a 20-30 minute drive from Reno to Carson (depending on which parts you're coming from/to) but we don't have too bad traffic so you're covering 30 miles. Throw in a storm and it can take you an hour plus. Though, we only get bad storms a few times a year. So I guess it depends how important the things in Reno are to you."

College Bar: Archie's, but mostly awesome for buy-one-get-one-free burgers with a student ID. Also has great breakfast and hours.   Sushi: My favorite lately has been Hiroba. Not a huge fan of the atmosphere but they definitely have great rolls. Second place is Sushi Rose, total hole-in-the wall, love their weekly promotions, and a few of their rolls are my favorite in town. Shout outs to Jazmine and Sushi Pier 2 also.  Brewery: Great Basin. Love all their beers mostly, and the fish n ships are so bomb!!  Pizza: Pub n Sub. Also counts as a college bar I guess. Awesome pizza and wings! Runner up goes to Blind Onion, which occasionally beats out Pub depending on who's making pizzas that day.  Mexican: Betos. Cheap and Authentic, very very good. Not exactly a place to bring the whole family to though.  Sandwiches: Beach Hut Deli is by far my favorite. So so good, but a little expensive. Runner up goes to Rubicon Deli, only tried it once but it was killer good.  Late night: Gold N Silver Inn. Perfect drunk as fuck foods and close to downtown. Great to hit after a pub crawl."

My SO and I moved here from Humboldt County, it's a little longer but a nicer drive.

Or take 395 up to 139, go through Klamath Falls and then take 97 up to 58 and which connects to I-5 just south of Eugene.  395 in California isn't that bad for traffic, they are a fair number of passing lanes.

Unfortunately, Charter offers the fastest internet in town and has everybody by the balls. If you are dissatisfied with them, AT&T is your only real, viable option."

Whenever my price went up for just internet I would visit the office and tell them I am trying to save money and was wondering if I could get a lower rate. The 2 times I have done it they gave me a discounted rate for 6-12 months and with no hassle. Usually it dropped it from ~70/month to about 50.  If they don't go along with it, if you have u-verse available (they know where it is available) threaten to cancel, if they still don't go with it well I don't know what to do."

Reno,2ovh0k,wartornhero,1 point,Wed Dec 10 23:05:32 2014 UTC,I think they have soft caps but I want to say it starts at 300gb and even then I think you have to be using over 300gb over several months to get a warning.  In college (Charter in Oregon) (2010) according to our in house tracking; my roommates and I  were pulling up and down over 600gb a month for 2-3 months and never experienced any throttling or warnings.

Reno,2orf2r,ViggoMiles,12,Tue Dec 9 21:35:09 2014 UTC,"The tipping point (for the better) was the addition of the movie theater to downtown.  Before 2003, downtown Reno was no place to bring a family, even during the daytime & the plan to build the movie theater there was controversial.  The movie theater indirectly lead to the River Walk, the Aces Ballpark, and less general shittyness."
Reno,2orf2r,you_rebel_scum,1 point,Tue Dec 9 21:50:46 2014 UTC,There was a movie theater down there in the 80s.  And a Woolworths.  There was only but a brief period that downtown lacked a theater.

Midtown has been huge as well as the shift away from a gaming heavy economy.  I certainly feel Reno is no longer the joke I thought it was when I first got here.  Although, I'm not sure if it was just me growing up, or if Reno grew up a little with me."

Reno,2orf2r,fondupot,3,Tue Dec 9 21:19:40 2014 UTC,"A growing thing, in the last few years is that Reno is trying to regrow it's community.    Midtown is rising, and there are a lot of Small business developments being pushed.  Casinos and Events centers are pushing to get more Conventions or Field-meets, Region matches.  Like GSR is building something like 16 indoor courts to start getting those sports to Reno.   In the last 10 years, we have 2 new big outdoor malls.  The Summit at very south of Reno and Legacy (Outlet mall spots) in sparks. (New Imax super chair theater).  Plumb Lane mall is a distant memory."
Reno,2orf2r,ViggoMiles,5,Tue Dec 9 21:52:05 2014 UTC,I've been saying it since I moved here: The city needs to buy the land around the movie theater and turn it into a park.
Reno,2orf2r,dangerousminority,2,Wed Dec 10 03:47:25 2014 UTC,"Parklane turned into a park XD   I think that'd require too much water and planting on that and potential danger with the traffic load. Plus, Virginia Lake is already .. like 8 blocks from there?    It'd be hard to say, since across the street is a plaza/outside mall already.   The movie theater has more than enough parking.   I dunno, guess it'd be a good hotel spot."
Reno,2orf2r,ViggoMiles,3,Wed Dec 10 03:57:41 2014 UTC,Food and Arts are booming.  Midtown is certainly one of the major areas but it's happening everywhere as they separate the 'districts'. The River District has a number of great restaurants and now the Arch District is looking to build around Whitney Peak and the empty buildings nearby.

Reno,2orf2r,Sl33pyh34d,1 point,Thu Dec 11 04:01:21 2014 UTC,"Beaujolais and 4th Street Bistro are phenomenal restaurants, but they are on the pricier side.  Washoe Steakhouse, Johnny's, and Rapscallion all have great food and ambiance and are just above the ""no shorts"" line.  Campo and Old Granite street are probably my favorite in town; shorts would be welcome, though.  Brasserie St. James brews great beer, serves great food, and has a great bar area with pool and darts.  They play major sporting events on TV, but  not always with audio.  ""Our Bar"" downtown has the feel of a neighborhood bar with bar food and sports on TV.  Most of the places I go to drink wouldn't impress anyone though, hahaha."

Reno,2orf2r,ryanseacrust,5,Tue Dec 9 17:32:00 2014 UTC,No amount of lanes is going to help when one person drives 65 in the fast lane with a line of 20 cars behind them and someone else merges from the on-ramp at 40mph.
Reno,2orf2r,fknbastard,1 point,Tue Dec 9 22:48:08 2014 UTC,"Agreed, but 80 east to 395 south would be much improved by not going down to one lane from two."
Reno,2orf2r,Ravanas,3,Tue Dec 9 23:18:44 2014 UTC,"Exactly, this should be two lanes all the way through.  Also, the Neil Rd/Mall ramps have made traffic horrible due to the 395N ramp being about 30 ft at 15% grade."
Reno,2orf2r,ryanseacrust,4,Tue Dec 9 23:22:37 2014 UTC,"The ramp merge?  Totally but most ramps go to one lane before merging so it'd be odd to see different.  The big problem with merging is as always...some people don't merge until the very last minute and stop traffic to do so (which should get you a ticket in my book), whereas others never attain the speed of traffic to merge and thereby slow everyone on the onramp behind them to that same 'below traffic speed' level until there's enough break in traffic for someone to speed up."
Reno,2orf2r,fknbastard,3,Tue Dec 9 23:55:14 2014 UTC,"The biggest problem seems to be people trying to merge immediately onto 395. That lane lasts a mile. Usually everyone moves to the left doing 40 and I nail it and pass them all on the right and then move over.  But really they just need to get rid of that second lane going up there. One lane north, one lane south."
Reno,2orf2r,Neodymie,1 point,Fri Dec 12 16:34:52 2014 UTC,It's not just at 80 E and 395 S; it's pretty much anywhere an oncoming lane merges with traffic.  People are freaking idiots. They will cut in front of you doing 35 and not think twice about it.
Reno,2orf2r,thehalfwit,1 point,Sat Dec 13 09:57:25 2014 UTC,"Yeah, people suck at merging for sure, but continuing the 2 lanes on that ramp would do a world of good.  Similarly, the 395 north to 80 east ramp.  Those two cause most of the problems I see (that, and the Oddie exit)."
Reno,2orf2r,Ravanas,2,Wed Dec 10 00:05:12 2014 UTC,"I've lived here a long, long time.  There was a larger sense of community and family when we first got here and downtown was not a scary place to be except for some side streets.  There was a more active casino presence back then, stores, a movie theater, and long standing restaurants.   Those restaurants are gone now, to be replaced with the newest food truck turned brick and mortar, casinos have been turned into residences.  Park Lane Mall and across the street, Shoppers Square down the road was Old Town Mall (now Reno Town Mall) was the place to go until Meadowood Mall came about and it floundered for years.    There were no such thing as dog parks.  You took your dog to a park and they chased the ball in the grass.    The spaghetti bowl...well, they can paint new lines all they want, the design was flawed from the start.  Merging two lanes into one lane (one being a blind merge - S to 580), makes it worse.  The lane that is marked as an exit for 580, merges into the last chance exit lane that splits going N and S.  This is where most of the accidents occur.  There was a lot more farming and open fields south of town.  Pretty much, all the businesses stopped at Hash Lane/McCarran Blvd.  I digress, that was all more than 10 years ago.    10 years saw a downfall of the downtown area and many other businesses in the area.  Things are just now, starting to pick up and buildings are getting filled.  Oddly, many are building new structures instead of filling the old.  I'd really like to see something where the Park Lane Mall stood.    Geographically, the layout of the city hasn't changed much.  The houses started to rise on the hills surrounding the city, foreclosed, and are now refilled and new buildings are once again rising.  The Truckee had some changes made to it downtown, but nothing really changing the layout.   Honestly, it's always been a great city to get around.  North/South and East/West freeways with McCarran going all the way around."

I do agree Chipotle shouldn't be the representation of Mexican food, but I would also let him know that it's a more Americanized version of Mexican food and he may still wan't to try it because it's well known. My Italian cousin wanted to try Starbucks when he visited and I knew it wouldn't compare to what he was use to, but it was more about the experience of trying something in the US he has heard so much about."

I'm pretty sure they all cost over a million bucks. I think it's because the signs were designed for Vegas, where rain isn't a problem as often."

It is not the best sushi you will ever eat, but it's definitely not the worst. From what I understand, it's good and it's cheap. Most sushi eating Reno-ites who I know do not eat sushi when they travel because they say it may or may not be higher quality than what you get here but the prices seem outrageous when you're used to the Reno AYCE rates."

Reno,2nje1n,ski_rick,11,Thu Nov 27 02:06:27 2014 UTC,"While I love the idea of Uber, they seem to blatantly want to avoid state regulations because:   The Delaware-based Uber maintains it is a technology company, not a transportation-services company subject to Nevada regulations that apply to taxis or commercial motor carriers.   Which seems laughable to me. Yes, they provide a novel way of getting a taxi via technology but they're also very obviously providing a service that's not really different from a taxi service. There's just no guarantee that the drivers are licensed and bonded for the work, afaik.   Breslow testified that representatives of Uber met with him last month to discuss ways they might comply with those regulations. But he said that two days later he was blindsided by Uber's formal launch of its business in Nevada on Oct. 24 with nothing more than an email notice that morning.   That move screams a complete disregard for the law, nonchalance, irresponsibility, or any of the above. Just because you don't like the law doesn't mean you don't have to obey it, especially as a business."
Reno,2nje1n,cosine83,-4,Thu Nov 27 04:39:06 2014 UTC,All I hear is we have to protect outdated business models with outdated laws. The way you fix a system is showing the old it's obsolete. People will vote for the service and show it's utility by not complying with the bribed useless way of the old.  Legacy systems times are coming to an end whether you and they like it at all.
Reno,2nje1n,cosine83,8,Thu Nov 27 07:55:38 2014 UTC,"That's well and good but you can't run a business based on what you'd like the business model to be. You have to run it with what it currently is and work to change it.   The way you fix a system is showing the old it's obsolete.   Obviously you don't work in the tech sector, government, or any sector that relies on obsolete tech. Just because something is obsolete doesn't preclude it from working and doing the job. The whole ""don't fix what ain't broke"" thing. There's a time and place for pushing out obsolescence but it isn't when the new product is still spanking new. You have to figure out how the new thing will work with the old until such a time that you can easily cut to the new and get rid of the old. It's not as easy as saying ""that thing is old and doesn't work how I want, let's replace it.""  Uber is clearly working from the POV that they'll run their business how they want regardless of the law and pitching a fit when they get punished for it."
Reno,2nje1n,haroldp,-1,Thu Nov 27 08:21:38 2014 UTC,My point really isn't about uber at all.... I look at uber like I look at what Napster was. When they shut it down there will be decentralized alternatives that don't rely on a single business or single point of failure.  I actually hope the government laws and regulation kills uber. It will produce the next best alternative that will be that much harder for them to kill.
Reno,2nje1n,wartornhero,-7,Thu Nov 27 15:24:07 2014 UTC,"don't fix what ain't broke   The taxi system is broken, corrupt, overpriced and wasteful.  It needs fixing.     Uber is clearly working from the POV that they'll run their business how they want regardless of the law and pitching a fit when they get punished for it.     This is not quite true.  Uber's flaunting of these laws is a calculated tactic to shed light and create local public outcry over antiquated, anti-competitive, anti-innovative laws.  And it works much better and more quickly than a a traditional, lawyers-and-lobbyists attack on the system.  It's not that they don't care to follow laws in general, but rather that they see this as the best way to get the laws changed."
Reno,2nje1n,cybaritic,3,Thu Nov 27 18:49:19 2014 UTC,"So if you want legacy regulations to be changed, then work with lawmakers to get them changed and then release in a market. Uber is just strong arming states into letting them operate instead of proving that they are safe and valuable. Their current model makes them seem like a bunch of raging asshats.  In the real world. If it looks like a rose, smells like a rose, and operates like a rose. Then it is a rose."

Reno,2n8deh,ZAchAtTacK760,0,Wed Dec 3 23:05:49 2014 UTC,For national acts there's a half a dozen venues and really only a few that can support an 800+ capacity.  But the Reno live music scene probably couldn't handle too many more. The Alley had a hell of a good run but I remember too many times a national act had like 10 people show up.

Reno,2n18w1,xbyzk,4,Sat Nov 22 01:04:35 2014 UTC,"Prior to moving out here with my employers some 20 years ago, that's the one thing they kept saying about Reno that impressed me. ""Everybody's so friendly!""  And they're right. Barely anybody knows how to drive, but for the most part everybody is friendly.   I'm especially impressed by the local arts scene. In my wildest imagination, I never expected I'd be part of that scene, but since taking up comedy some three years back, I have gotten to know dozens and dozens of great people."

Reno,2n18w1,DragonDai,1 point,Sat Nov 22 07:17:45 2014 UTC,Would be fine if they would do it the right the right lane and stay out of the way. Instead it's get on the freeway at 35. Instantly dive across three lanes with out looking. Spend the next two minutes crawling up to 60. Continue until your 500 ft from your off ramp. Slam on your brakes and cross three lanes without looking. Exit.
Reno,2n18w1,SplatterEffect,2,Sat Nov 22 11:00:04 2014 UTC,Haha it's so true! I love Reno. I love the people. But I lose my mind when driving. I go to Sacramento and feel at home when driving 80 and being passed.

It's not in a neighborhood I frequent and although I've occasionally driven past it for years it never really drew me in.  It's a great little breakfast joint, really cozy and cute inside, good service, and really solid breakfasts.    Yesenia restaurant on Moana is relatively new, but has replaced Bistro Habenero for my go-to place for pupusas.  Their mexican food kind of sucks, but the pupusas are huge, stuffed full, and delicious."
Reno,2n09y8,rowdymuskrat,1 point,Fri Nov 21 19:04:41 2014 UTC,I love this spot for breakfast. Great food and great staff. One (really dumb) thing that kills me is the way staff parks their cars. I know it's staff because they are always the same couple of cars. They always park right in front of the doors.

Reno,2n09y8,PearlyDewdropsDrops,3,Fri Nov 21 23:14:00 2014 UTC,It's probably due to the bullet holes in the window and the influx of people that walk into the kitchen area and out again without the appearance of being employees or customers.

Reno,2ml0s3,Ravanas,1 point,Mon Nov 17 23:46:45 2014 UTC,"Not the person you asked, but I'm a long time (16 or 17 years now) Greater Nevada CU member as well.    Checking account fees (which are like $8 a month, iirc) are reimbursed immediately so long as you have Direct Deposit or use your debit card a certain number of times per month.  I'm not sure of the number, but even at my last job where I didn't have Direct Deposit, it wasn't an issue since I regularly use my debit card.  Basically, if you make use of your account, it's free checking.  Only other requirement I can think of is a $25 minimum in my primary savings account.  (My secondary savings has no minimum.)    Another thing, even though I know ATM's aren't an issue for you: free ATM use at 7-11 was huge for me before they opened their NW Reno branch.  It's also really nice since that's nationwide.  So if I'm traveling, all I have to do is find a 7-11 and I have a free ATM.  Also, they have good online services as far as I can tell... though I don't use the Bill Pay service, just use it to make transfers and check balances and such.  In fact, they just did an upgrade on their site.  All in all, I've been a very happy customer of GNCU.  You can find out details I missed, was vague about, or don't know at their site, I'm sure.  http://www.gncu.org"

Reno,2md32x,Megamantrinity,8,Sat Nov 15 07:24:37 2014 UTC,I guess this explains the idiots that work for them. I have had too many run ins with ESI clowns that think they are above the law.
Reno,2md32x,cambria05,9,Sat Nov 15 07:39:37 2014 UTC,"Here is the post incase it gets brought down, on top of that I also have a copy of the original post.  ESI is run by a rather unscrupulous owner who receives $70. an hour per security officer at the site I was working at (Carson Tahoe Hospital) of which the security officer receives $12.38 an hour with zero benefits, no medical, dental, health insurance, nothing. Said security officer is exposing him/herself to great bodily harm, getting spit in the face etc., dealing with psychotic patients who are either coming down off of meth or are coping with severe schizophrenia and other mental maladies, meanwhile all hospital staff are getting at minimum $20-25. an hour with benefits. To say that paying someone a McDonald's wage to perform this task impacts morale is an extreme understatement, especially a Combat Veteran (U.S. Army, Honorable, 25th Infantry Division 1997-2005, OEF 2004-2005) with an Associates Degree and years in the security industry. Mike Hendi, the owner of ESI, then goes and blows $300,000. at Harrah's in one sitting and to afford his gambling habit does not offer Direct Deposit to the employees/slaves of ESI. It isn't that Direct Deposit costs only $1. per employee to implement, it is because every day that money allocated to employees wages sits in an account it is accruing interest. So you, the employee, get to spend half-an-hour every two weeks making a special trip to the office to pick up your paycheck, just like back in 1955, so the owner, a Jordan National, can continue to enjoy his favorite past-time!   If you wish to file a complaint with the Nevada Security Licensing Board, you'll soon discover that Mike Hendi is a sitting member! All of the security agencies, including Securitas and ESI, get together and set the rates to be charged to clients and the wages to be given to the security slaves. This is what you would call an Oligopoly or good-old-fashioned Mafia socio-economics. So much for the concept of competition outlined in Capitalism! A quick call to the Nevada Labor Board and you'll soon discover that Mike Hendi is their most popular person to deal with in the entire state of Nevada! You know why the security slaves at Carson Tahoe are paid $12.38 an hour? Because Mike Hendi was sued for previously trying to get a way with paying them $10 an hour! As an employer in the State of Nevada you either have to pay an employee overtime for time worked beyond eight hours a day OR pay them $12.35 an hour.   A co-worker at the Hospital, whom I will not name, was paid $9.50 for the first two weeks she worked there. Upon inquiring as to the discrepancy in pay, which is illegal I might add, she was told that she was under ""training"". This employee was not new to the company, she was previously working with ESI at other sites for over a year. ESI figured they could pull a fast one and that the employee wouldn't press for lost wages. To this day she has yet to get the amount owed to here from ESI, a measly $200-300. difference. Mike Hendi needs all he can get in the Casinos!   Mike Hendi is yet another sociopathic predator taking advantage of a burgeoning under-class of disadvantaged Americans. He is a champion of values espoused by Milton Friedman and Ayn Rand who believe in ushering in an era of Neo-Feudalism. Think the Middle Ages with high technology.   ""So what if youre eating cat-food under an overpass? Less than 1% of the society is living in a virtual utopia of unbridled material wealth!""  ""A rising tide raises all ships!""   ""The guiding Invisible Hand of the Free-Market will bestow its blessings!""   This company is bleeding employees / slaves and is desperate to hire anyone who is willing to tolerate a heightened risk of mental and bodily harm for a minimum wage, hence the daily ads here on CL.   You have been warned."
Reno,2md32x,haroldp,6,Sat Nov 15 07:25:20 2014 UTC,"Thanks for copying the text!  It's gone now.    If the rates ESI charges are high, the wages he pays are low, and the business overhead is marginal (uniforms, office, telephone, training, insurance), then why don't you start your own security company and put him out of business?     If you wish to file a complaint with the Nevada Security Licensing Board, you'll soon discover that Mike Hendi is a sitting member!   Oh, that is why.  Can I tell you what Milton Friedman would say about that?    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Biu7bJAfVNI&t=3m59s"

Not to mention, it would be nice to know ESI's actual profit percentage.  As inflationary as paying $12 wages on $70 per hour might appear on the surface, the truth is that the actual profit margin could be considerably less after factoring in costs like  vehicle maintenance, insurance, and taxes."

Having a job is a big deal in this economy, and especially one that you can almost never get fired from. A lot of us are just waiting for a bite to get out. That doesn't change the fact that many of us are abused, neglected, and forced to work many hours for horrible pay because of our loyalty.   Were not abusers of any system. Were not haters or whiners or backstabbers. Were blue collar citizens who love each other, want to be paid adequately for what we do, and perhaps maybe have a boss who cares about us."

Reno,2md32x,cambria05,-1,Sun Nov 16 13:11:22 2014 UTC,I agree ALL wages need to go up. But this security guard lost all sympathy for me when he started ragging on hospital employees who definitely deserve to be paid double what he makes or more.

You miss the fact that despite the fact that hes stupid, he managed to come up with some argument that was valid, and couldn't help but throw in some garbage because thats what hes good for.   We all spew a little garbage from time to time. Imagine what the world would be like if you just got ignored every time something you said was perceived as stupid? It's just not right.

Reno,2md32x,themosthatedone,2,Mon Nov 17 05:13:10 2014 UTC,"I have had quite a few friends who have worked for ESI. The point is Mike Hindi is an idiot. There are a lot of people who work for him who don't get paid because their check bounces because Hindi doesn't put enough money into his payroll account. While a lot of the employees are great that work there, they get pissed on all the time thanks to Mike Hindi.  The way Hindi works is that he gets a business partner to pay for most of his stuff until that partner either gets pissed or goes broke then he finds another one.  The complaint about the hospital staff getting paid more was not him bitching about him getting paid more, it was that they get paid more and have insurance which Mike Hindi does not offer his people in any form. So the officers are putting themselves at high risk because they act as orderlies and have to hold down patients with who knows what in their system which puts them at a higher risk to catch what ever it is then the hospital staff.  I have looked into making my own company as I have worked security in the area for the last 10 years but never for ESI. Security Licensing is not cheap and anyone can get it as long as you have the money for it. It typically costs $1000 for the Unarmed PILB licensing (Not the Nevada PILB guard card), not including business/liability insurance  and business licensing.  The point is that Mike Hindi is more worried about filling his pockets rather then taking care of his employees."

The level of detail they go through on the first visit (taking full pictures of your teeth, taking molds, showing you close ups of your teeth and what you are doing / not doing correctly, etc). They even found the starts of a cavity and were able to fix it a few days later with no need for pain medicine."

I only did it because I was buying from my out of state family that came down to visit. So let me tell you about that experience and why I really dislike it.  I call up the local gun stores in town asking how much its going to cost. I have bought guns before, and I knew the process was about 5-10 minutes of paperwork, and since I am exempt from background checks, I wouldn't need to pay the $15 fee for that or wait the extra 5-20 minutes for it to happen.  How much does it cost for 5-10 minutes of paperwork? Apparently $50 per gun, and all the gun stores in town said the same thing. I should mention that if you want to transfer 2-10 guns instead of 1, all you have to do is list them in the paperwork, which takes like 20 seconds per gun to do.   I was able to find one guy with a license doing it from his house, and he only charged me $25. Still more than I would like to pay for 10 minutes of paperwork, but much better than $50.  Even if I as OK with the idea (which I am not) I would still vote ""no"" simply because it forces us to go to a private business to transfer something that every American who is not a felon has (or should have) the right to own."

Reno,2ltbos,chriskmee,2,Fri Nov 14 06:08:14 2014 UTC,"When I was looking at what others were paying in other states, I saw a lot of $10 and $15, which for 5 minutes of paperwork seems more reasonable.

Reno,2ltbos,dookie1481,3,Fri Nov 14 03:41:11 2014 UTC,"Cost of the FFL and business license.  Cost of overhead.  For a store, that is all the obvious (rent, lights, payroll, etc.).  Even for a kitchen table FFL, that is insurance, time, etc.  And it isn't ""5 minutes of paperwork"".  It is realistically 10-25 min plus time required to check in the item, and most importantly, the risk inherent to having an FFL.  Not many industries can get you federal criminal charges for paperwork errors.  I run a retail store at a gun range, and frankly, I wish we could just do away with transfers period.  75% of the people that do them don't buy anything else in your store because they are all about saving a buck, and they tie up a salesperson who might otherwise be helping a customer that might actually make us some money.  EDIT:  A ""reasonable"" transfer fee, for our business model, is $20-25.  A local store here charges $80 per firearm, because they don't want to do transfers."
Reno,2ltbos,chriskmee,1 point,Fri Nov 14 04:25:52 2014 UTC,"If we are talking about 8 hour days, is one employee being held up for 10-25 minutes every now and then really an issue?  Last time I bought a gun it really did only take 5-10 minutes. I fill out a page or so of paperwork, the dealer checks over mine and fills out a page or 2, and then one swipe of the credit card and we are done.  I also wish we could do away with transfers, I would much rather get a gun shipped to my door or hand my out of state friend some money and take the gun, but unfortunately we don't have a choice. I think transfers are extra pointless for me since I don't even get a background check done, I just have to fill out the form and pay."
Reno,2ltbos,BTC_Brin,2,Fri Nov 14 04:33:26 2014 UTC,"It only took you 5-10 minutes.  I can't speak for other stores, but in my experience, a private party transfer of a handgun involves four forms (4473, Commonwealth transfer form, our internal transfer form, and the paper receipt). All information on the government forms MUST be 100% correct. That means everything from having checkboxes filled out correctly, to having names spelled correctly (you would not believe the number of people who misspell their own names), to having the gun's info correctly filled out. Since any mistake could result in the revocation of the store's FFL, it's taken extremely seriously, and all forms are required to be checked by another employee once completed.  Additionally, in order for us to transfer a firearm it must pass through our inventory. That means it needs to be logged into and out of our bound book. Again, correct entry is critical, which means extra time is spent to ensure correctness.  Furthermore, there is a Federal mandate that we report when an individual purchases more than one handgun within a specified period of time, which means that the transaction needs to be checked against other purchases, which also takes time. If an applicable multiple sale is discovered, there is yet another piece of paperwork that must be filled out and then faxed to both the BATFE and the local Sheriff's office. It doesn't help that the BATFE's fax line is often busy.  Thus, the process that you saw involve 10-15 minutes of employee time actually took far longer. That's also before you consider the fact that background checks are often quite far from being ""instant."" Having to wait 10-15 minutes for the result of a background check is fairly typical. Wait times in excess of 45 minutes happen on a fairly regular basis.  Thus, between overhead (employee time, building costs, cost of using the background check system, utility costs, etc.), risk, and profit margin, transfers are not something where dealers typically make money.  especially once you factor all of that in, it also shouldn't be surprising when dealers don't want to accept shipped transfers from certain companies."

No thanks, I'll buy everything online where they can run the same business, actually have ammo in stock, and ship it to my door for still less than the cost I'd pay in a store.   The best was one of the stores near me was selling bags of 7.62x25 Tokarev with the label 'New S&B Tokarev - 100 rd / $50'. And they were clearly crimped surplus in the bag."

Reno,2ltbos,Frostiken,15,Mon Nov 10 06:42:07 2014 UTC,"If they actually cared about stopping criminals, they'd work to implement a simple and inclusive plan that would enlist gun owners in helping to prevent criminals getting their hands on guns, rather than treating all gun owners like criminals.  For example, most states mark the driver's licenses for people who are under 21 so it's easy for anyone to ascertain at a glance whether they are of legal drinking age.  Implementing a similar plan where everyone's ID is marked so that someone who is  looking to sell a gun can learn whether the person they're dealing with is a prohibited person or not would be far more effective, cheaper, and easier to implement than the so-called ""universal background check"" schemes that have been pushed by the likes of Bloomberg.  Unfortunately, this isn't actually about preventing criminals from getting guns.

Normal people don't have to check your ability to own a car before selling you their car, they just take your money and sign over the title.

This is essentially removing private sale as an option and treating all sales as an FFL purchase but without an FFL. Why would I be at all inclined to submit myself to paperwork and wait times when I don't have to? As I've also said above, most gun owners have had enough of negotiating with gun control advocates just for them to come back in the near future asking for even more strict control. There is no immediate gun ban, but it's a constant series of steps towards it that are bothering people.

Does it address the problems that were seen in the Colorado and Washington laws?  You know, like how those laws would make you a criminal for loaning a rifle to a friend for a hunting trip or competition?  Does it fix the prices on background checks, thereby ensuring that no gun dealers will actually be interested in conducting background checks on any transfers except for the ones they conduct on the guns they sell in their shops?  Does it address issues like what happened in Colorado last year when it turned out flood victims who had lost their homes were inadvertently criminalized for transferring their gun collections to friends for safe keeping?  Does it make it a crime to let someone handle a firearm without a background check at a venue other than on a gun range operated by a for-profit enterprise, thereby criminalizing you if you loan your gun to a buddy at a range operated by a non-profit (as most shooting clubs are), on public land, or on private property?  Does the proposed legislation inadvertently discriminate against couples in non-traditional marriages by prohibiting transfer of a firearm without a background check between gay or lesbian couples, while allowing the same sorts of transfers to occur between heterosexual couples?  Does the legislation you support include common-sense exemptions on transfers, for example, those who've already successfully passed a background check in order to acquire a concealed carry permit?

Reno,2ltbos,whoamanwtf,2,Wed Nov 12 16:38:33 2014 UTC,"Bundy standoff:       The Bundy standoff is a 20-year legal dispute between the United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and cattle rancher Cliven Bundy in southeastern Nevada over unpaid grazing fees that developed into an armed confrontation between protesters and law enforcement.  The ongoing dispute began in 1993, when, in protest against changes to grazing rules, Bundy declined to renew his permit for cattle grazing on BLM-administered lands near Bunkerville, Nevada.  In 1998, Bundy was prohibited by the United States District Court for the District of Nevada from grazing his cattle on an area of land later called the Bunkerville Allotment.  In July 2013, the BLM complaint was supplemented when federal judge Lloyd D. George ordered that Bundy refrain from trespassing on federally administered land in the Gold Butte area of Clark County.   On March 27, 2014, 145,604 acres of federal land in Clark County were temporarily closed for the ""capture, impound, and removal of trespass cattle"".  BLM officials and law enforcement rangers began a roundup of such livestock on April 5, and an arrest was made the next day. On April 12, a group of protesters, some of them armed,  advanced on what the BLM described as a ""cattle gather.""  Sheriff Doug Gillespie negotiated with Bundy and newly confirmed BLM director Neil Kornze,  who elected to release the cattle and de-escalate the situation.    After making remarks about whether black people would be better off as slaves than under government subsidies, Bundy was widely condemned in the media and was repudiated by conservative politicians and talk-show hosts who had previously supported him, many of whom forcefully condemned his remarks as racist.

Someone who intends to murder isn't going to care about this law.  There are always going to be people who are willing to sell a gun to anyone period. You can get drugs and weapons in a prison, how is your law going to make a free society any safer.  I suggest that you look into the facts surrounding most of the high profile shootings that have taken place recently, no background check would have ever been performed, or it if was, nothing would be found to have prevented the sale.  It's much more likely that the shooter provided enough clues in conversation or social media that he/she should have been reported to law enforcement prior to the act, but those who knew did nothing.   You are a pawn for financiers who have an agenda to limit firearms ownership.  Background checks are just one of their techniques used to infringe on the rights of people who obey the law, because they know that such a law is unenforceable at all levels, just an inconvenience guised as ""common sense"" gun control.    And by the way, you seem to be very concerned with your constitutional rights, how would you feel if your constitutional right to free speech were subject to common sense limitations such as time place or manner of communication (shocker, it already is and you should be outraged at this).  What if Nevada and other states make laws preventing your ability to visit peoples homes and spread your flawed political views.

I'm not just going to random neighborhoods, I am assigned a new neighborhood every night and given the names/addresses of specific registered voters who I am expected to talk to. I code these peoples' responses in a company phone and it can all be tracked and monitored. I have to make a living just like everybody else here. If I don't stick to my turf I can be fired.   So I knock on your door and you ask me to leave? Fine. It's your property. I'm gone. However, it is ILLEGAL for someone to prevent me from talking to their neighbors.   Again, I am paid to petition in a very specific way to ensure the validity of the signatures that I collect. I do this to get by, to pay my rent. The idea that ANYONE should get their ass kicked just for doing their job is utter bullshit."

Reno,2ltbos,Monkt,1 point,Wed Nov 12 15:28:15 2014 UTC,"Section 19. Meaning of ""well regulated militia"" of article  Second Amendment to the United States Constitution:       The term ""regulated"" means ""disciplined"" or ""trained"".  In Heller, the U.S. Supreme Court stated that ""[t]he adjective 'well-regulated' implies nothing more than the imposition of proper discipline and training.""   In the year prior to the drafting of the Second Amendment, in Federalist No. 29 Alexander Hamilton wrote the following about ""organizing"", ""disciplining"", ""arming"", and ""training"" of the militia as specified in the enumerated powers:  If a well regulated militia be the most natural defence of a free country, it ought certainly to be under the regulation and at the disposal of that body which is constituted the guardian of the national security...confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority...[but] reserving to the states...the authority of training the militia....A tolerable expertness in military movements is a business that requires time and practice. It is not a day, or even a week, that will suffice for the attainment of it. To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the character of a well-regulated militia, would be a real grievance to the people, and a serious public inconvenience and loss.... Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with respect to the People at large, than to have them properly armed and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year.

Yesterday we stopped working on the Marijuana petition because we heard back from the main office that we had enough signatures! Now we're just working on a gun control petition that would close a loophole by requiring background checks for unlicensed gun sales. It's pretty unpopular here, to the point where my co-workers have had guns pulled on them, been followed, had police called on them, and even been mugged."

I am not surprised you got some serious resistance, since to be able to enforce it you would also need gun registration, and that is also very unpopular. Another big thing is that you would be forcing everyone to pay $50 per gun + $15 for the background check for 5 minutes of paperwork at the FFL dealers in town. Do I want to pay a $0 fee with no paperwork to sell a gun to my friend, or a $65 fee and some paperwork? I think the answer is pretty obvious."
Reno,2lmg88,chriskmee,0,Tue Nov 11 22:29:31 2014 UTC,"Yes he is.

Which I signed. I've never shot a gun before, but I believe these laws should be in place and am all for responsible gun owners.

Reno,2lmg88,jrwreno,2,Thu Nov 13 00:22:59 2014 UTC,"As far as mental health checks go, I don't think you should be forced to get a mental health check to go buy a gun. However, if a mental health professional has determined that you are not safe to own a gun, I do believe they should be allowed to put a temporary hold on your ability to own a gun.  As far as online buyers, guns can't be shipped to anyone that is not an licensed dealer or manufacturer. If they buy it online and it gets shipped to a local dealer, the dealer will do a background check. If he buys it online and meets the seller in person, then that's a private party sale and no background check has to be done.  Like it or not, the right to own a gun is an amendment just like freedom of speech. If you believe any tests should be required to practice your second amendment right, then why aren't those tests also in place to practice your first amendment right? The amendments don't say ""You only get these if ..."", they say that every American is born with these rights."

Commuting isn't bad in Reno, but if you aren't worried about being centrally located you could at least live closer to work and we might have a recommendation based on that.  I live in the same neighborhood as The Park at Idlewild. At that complex you would be right across the street from a skate park and the swimming pool - so not exactly quiet in the summer if you're bothered by kids. There is a huge food truck thing every Friday night at the park when it is warm, which may or may not be a positive (kidding, it's a positive). This neighborhood can be tedious to get in/out of during the school day as it is completely surrounded by school zones and the major streets always seem to have high schoolers slowly ambling across them in large packs, which can add to your commute if you happen to leave at the wrong time.  If the area interests you (and it is great with the river/park so close), there is another complex down the street called ""The Village"" that is gated and appears to be newer/nicer. Also worth noting, I rent a 3 bedroom house with a nice big yard for just a little bit more than what you put as your max for rent - so maybe check craigslist for houses too?"
Reno,2ldzp6,AgedashiTofu,2,Wed Nov 5 19:41:13 2014 UTC,"I live at the Village, but it's definitely outside the $900 for a two bedroom range the OP mentioned.  We pay close to $1200 for a two bed/two bath and two covered parking spots.  Units were originally built as condos, so the construction is solid, modern appliances, modern touches, decent insulation, etc.  Proximity to downtown is rad (walkable/stumble-able) and Midtown is a long walk/short bike ride as well.  The park is nice . . . though as you mention, Reno Street Food and various events can make it a bit of a cluster to get in and out (e.g. Odyssey).  There's a few other complexes along Idlewild that seem okay too.  Just realize at the $900 for a 2 bed price point, you'll get a little sketchiness at times - e.g. maybe a little questionable for single females late at night (though that's pretty much everywhere), and occasionally you'll see someone working on their car in the parking lots.

Reno,2ldzp6,munchers65,1 point,Thu Nov 6 00:16:56 2014 UTC,"Late to the party but I'll offer my two cents.  For what you're looking for - quiet area, wanting a cat, W/D in unit - I'd recommend either the Lakeridge Apartments or Aspen Ridge. Both complexes are right next to each other in SW Reno (right off of Plumas & McCarran), and while there's definitely a lot of comparable apartments in the NW, I personally would much rather live in the SW.  Nicer area and closer to midtown/downtown (i.e., you don't have to take the freeway to get wherever you're going, which would be the case if you lived at a place like Vista Ridge or Aviana).  As for the places you're currently looking at, I'll join the other in saying that you really don't want to live in the North Valleys unless circumstances require it, and re: the Park at Idlewild, that place is OK (I've been there) but I'd much rather live over by Lakeridge."

A medical mj card does offer protection for growing and carrying your medicine, but at this time as far as I know, there is no where to legally procure it.

Reno,2lbn5t,AbsolutelyPink,3,Wed Nov 12 05:13:31 2014 UTC,"I'm still waiting for my official letter from the state (to take to the DMV), but I completed all of the steps for a license. It cost about $350 total, and was waaaaaaaay easier than I thought it would be. I found a local clinic online that specializes in the cards, and had my doctor's office fax them my records (I have a diagnosed chronic pain issue, and have been on Vicodin for years). Once they had the records, I went in and spoke with the doctor, who was great. The interview only took about 10 minutes, and once it was done the receptionist/office manager double checked all of the paperwork and notarized it. Instead of mailing it in, I drove to the office in Carson and dropped it off in person. As soon as they made sure that everything in the application was in order (and that I had attached the check), they said that I was officially legal. That's it. They have to run it through a background check to make sure I'm not a convicted drug trafficker (which I'm not), and due to their backlog there is a 6-8 week delay on these - but even though I don't have the card in-hand, I'm on the registry, and will only get taken off of it if my background check comes back dirty (which it won't). Per the lady at the state office, they don't decide whether someone qualifies; the doctor does that. The state just makes sure the paperwork is correct. From the time I left my house to the time I was officially legal, it took about an hour and a half. No shit. My doctor said that they should have dispensaries up and running by Christmas. That will be the best present EVER."

The problem we ran into was their ""peak pricing"" where to incentivise more drivers to come online they up the price for rides to pretty high, much higher than a cab. So it was actually cheaper to get a cab than to use uber.  I am skeptical I see some of the concern people have with uber (cars not inspected, drivers not tested or regulated on number of hours) based on my experience in Denver and my experience with cabs in reno I don't see much need right now for uber. I also don't see much of a difference between a Cab Company and Uber."

Obviously, if there are regulations that they need to abide by and whatnot, that is a totally different story and should be enforced, but as it stands the only reason this is blocked is because it cuts in to cab company's profits."

As far as I understand it the reason Uber being blocked is because there are regulations that ""cab companies"" have to follow but Uber which claims to not be a cab company says it doesn't have to follow.  I agree with the supreme court on this matter. Stuff like in the case of Aero. If Uber looks like a cab company, smells like a cab company, and acts like a cab company it is a cab company. Because of that the judicial system (albeit after an appeal from cab companies sure) issued the injunction to look at the laws and see if Uber is following all of them.  Here are the regulations in place in the state of Nevada. http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-706.html   Specifically stuff like NRS 706.8849.

Reno,2kpbgx,wartornhero,1 point,Thu Oct 30 18:25:20 2014 UTC,"Wait, as a business owner it makes sense to me to institute regulations that cut into my bottom line and force me to do stuff like pay a lab to test all my employees for drugs, and pay to have background checks done, and pay to keep a certain amount of insurance on each operator, and pay to have a government inspector to come out and inspect each and every vehicle I own, and ensure that all my meters are within 2% of accurate.  If none of these are met I am going to punish myself with hefty fines, and seizing of assets/property.  It is too bad these companies to protect their monopoly doesn't allow my taxi company to come in and have my meters that tick off every mile (well actually is is more like every 3/4 of a mile) Think of all the money I would have by doing that. Oh don't forget I don't have to do any maintenance on my vehicles! Just drive them into the ground and then auction them off.

Reno,2kpbgx,haroldp,2,Thu Oct 30 19:48:44 2014 UTC,"This is called, Regulatory Capture and it is a common and well understood form of government corruption.  Most taxi laws start with real citizen complaints about the quality, fairness or honesty of taxis.  A system of regulation is established to improve the situation.  However, over time, the incumbent taxi companies litigate, lobby, bribe or coerce their regulating bodies into enacting rules favorable to their businesses.  Among these are barriers to enter the market such as licensing, inspections, taxi ""medallions"" etc.    It may seem counterintuitive for a business owner to support regulations that cost him money, but remember that they cost his competition just as much, and the costs are passed on to the consumer.  The onerous fees keep individuals or small businesses from breaking into the market, and ensure a greater share for the incumbents.    Telecoms (cable & phone) and Airlines use regulatory capture to keep out competition.  Media companies have totally perverted copyright law and kept broadcasting spectrum artificially scarce and expensive to shut out competition.  Energy companies have the EPA regulate their pollution in order to avoid liability for it.  And if you don't like that ""companies are people"" thank the railroads for that one.

Regulatory capture is a form of government failure; it creates an opening for firms to behave in ways injurious to the public (e.g., producing negative externalities).

But the Board of Regents changed it to UNR and changed the Vegas school to UNLV from University of Nevada, Southern. So the students at UNR made a big push a few years ago to be recognized nationally simply as the University of Nevada, or just Nevada, basically to show that we were here first."

Whatever. I'm still in Nevada. Just gimme my degree so I can get out. (#keepthecannonblue)"
Reno,2kb3x3,SickSalamander,9,Sat Oct 25 21:50:41 2014 UTC,"Hey dude, there's lots of weird information in here that has probably confused the issue, so I'll lay some things out for as best I can.  I was heavily involved in the university when I attended, and I researched the history.  I'll try to separate facts from opinions for you so you can understand what's what.  And full disclosure, I prefer to refer to the school as ""Nevada"" or ""The University of Nevada"", and when people say, ""UNLV?"" I simply say, ""No, the one in Reno"".    1874: The University of Nevada is founded thanks to the Morrill Land Grant Act and is established in Elko, Nevada.  Shortly thereafter, the campus is moved to Reno.  This will be the only university in the state for 80 years. (fact)  1959: The University of Nevada opens an extension campus in Las Vegas.  At this time, they are still one school governed in Reno. (fact)  1965: The Board of Regents breaks the Vegas chapter off as its own school, Nevada Southern University. (fact)  1969: The delegates from Nevada Southern call for a vote by the Board of Regents to change the names of BOTH school.  Change The University of Nevada to University of Nevada, Reno; and change Nevada Southern to University of Nevada Las Vegas.  (fact).  The legend is the president of The University of Nevada was out of the room when the vote was called and couldn't defend the stance; obviously this isn't substantiated, but it's reason to hate Vegas.  In all reality, it's likely that Nevada was just copying California instead of copying everyone else.  (Examples: Oregon, Washington, Arizona, Utah, Idaho, New Mexico, Wyoming, Colorado, Oklahoma, Kansas, Iowa, etc. etc. etc. all use the two univeristy naming system of ""School, and School State"".  California has the ""UC System"" of UC Davis, UC Berkeley, UCLA, UCSD.  Nevada apparently expected to grow a third city and put a school there someday...) (fact based opinion)  1970's: Everyone still calls the school in Reno, ""Nevada"" and the school in Vegas becomes UNLV. (fact)  1980's: People are drinking everywhere. (probably fact)  1990's: UNLV has a stud basketball team and wins a National Championship.  They become a national brand.  I don't know when Nevada became UNR through all these decades but at this point Nevada is the small fish. (fact based opinion)  2000's: The University of Nevada has continued its century of academic excellence and wants to differentiate itself from its sister school down south which has lesser academic output.  There's a push to keep the historic roots of the campus and reestablish its brand as THE University of Nevada.  (fact based opinion)  This part is important:  One of the major pushes recently is to retain the public image as the University of Nevada.  This is the reason you see ""Nevada"" on ESPN instead of something else.  The University of Nevada Athletic Department is a separate entity that then academic institution of The University of Nevada, Reno.  The Athletic Department's official brands are ""The University of Nevada"", and ""The Nevada Wolf Pack"" (with the space is Wolf Pack - as opposed to North Carolina State's ""Wolfpack"").  So, the reason you see Nevada instead of something else because Nevada is technically the official branding and name for the teams.  (I worked in Athletics when I was a student in the 2000's, so this is fact as far as I know it - not opinion).    Now, with all of that said, you can call it whatever you want, but know you'll know where the name came from.  Lastly, regarding the URL's: nevada.edu goes to the Board of Regents because they oversee all of Nevada higher education.  un.edu goes nowhere because it's not a name used anywhere by anyone ever.  unr.edu and unlv.edu are the official websites of the schools because of the appropriate abbreviations.  I'd like the URL's to change, but that's never going to happen.    tl;dr, call it whatever you want, but history says it should simply be ""Nevada"".  Edit: I think it's pretty weak that someone decided to downvote this when I'm simply trying to supply context.  There's really nothing to disagree with or discredit in this post, but your negativity is appreciated..."

Nevada is a better school than people give it credit for. It's a tier one university, which is a poll taken every year of the top 100 universities in the country. So why the change? It mostly comes down to the Nevada vs unlv debate. When most people think Nevada they think las Vegas. We are trying to change that. Because Reno>Vegas  Establishing ourselves as the original university of the state, and a tier one institution, it makes us more marketable to incoming high school students and promotes a national brand for sporting purposes as well.

Reno,2k13kc,x0diak,14,Wed Oct 22 20:54:52 2014 UTC,"As an owner of three parrots, I will advise you that they are NOT easy pets who will ""easily perch near me, while i play video games or watch movies"".  Here's what will happen:   You sit down to play video games. Parrot jumps off perch and starts trying to eat your controller. You get up to go to the bathroom. Parrot DESTROYS your controller.  You sit down to watch a movie. Parrot decides it's time to start yelling all the words it knows as loud as it can because it's fun. You yell at parrot to stop. Parrot laughs and yells louder because it thinks you are playing a game.  Also, African Greys are extremely intelligent and sensitive birds who can live 50-70 years. You will basically have a pet with the intelligence and emotions of a two-year-old child for FIFTY YEARS.  Here are questions everyone interested in owning a parrot should ask themselves:  Do you have many hours per day to dedicate to interacting with a parrot?  They are not like a cat or a fish that can be left to its own devices. They NEED interaction and stimulation.  Can you deal with a very loud pet? Can your neighbors?  Do you have room and money for a HUGE cage full of toys that will be destroyed and have to be replaced weekly?   Parrots need expensive food and fresh fruits/vegetables every day. Are you willing to get up at dawn with your parrot and chop up veggies for him/her?   Are you willing to sweep/vacuum every day and clean parrot poop off stuff?  Can you honestly commit to having this pet for fifty years and not just selling it when you get bored or tired of the amount of care it needs?  That is just some of what you need to know about being a parrot owner. It is a MASSIVE commitment!"

If you really want to get one, maybe see if there's a rescue group you can talk with and host a bird buddy for a while to see how you like it… and if you end up liking it, adopt one of the rescues.  There are a lot of birds in foster homes, basically going through rehab, as many were abused or neglected after their novelty wore off, and there are others who's owner died and no one wants to inherit them.  I have a family member who fosters parrots (though not in Reno) and apparently it's a very rewarding experience though also demanding and expensive.  They're incredibly intelligent creatures and deserve a high level of respect and commitment so please don't make this decision without extensive research.  Good luck."

If you are super dead set on a talking bird, the grey is your best bet, followed closely by most amazons, primarily the double yellow headed and the yellow naped. also known to be good talkers are macaws and cockatoos. Personally i wouldn't recommend you base the purchase of a bird solely off of the principle that they talk, but rather get to know the personality types of each, but, like i said, if you are dead set, those are the types you want. If you want to learn more about each type of bird, drop by the store sometime, I would be glad to introduce you to the different types of birds.

Reno,2jnilx,FilXeno,3,Sun Oct 19 15:31:35 2014 UTC,"Whoa...that's an interesting idea...I saw someone grilling so I thought it was just that. a grill.   Seems kind of weird to me. Just cause I'm a cook (stay at home mom right now) and when I do go out I'd rather not make my own food haha. But I'm sure that it's fun for other people! Is there like a fee to use the grill and prep areas? or is it just expected that you buy drinks while you're there?  I forgot the biggest little city club. Noticed there was plastic in the windows when I was out for a walk the other day. I really like what they've done with their patio, so if they follow that it'll be cool...probably."
Reno,2jnilx,prelimar,3,Sun Oct 19 01:07:11 2014 UTC,Well it will be interesting to see how Pignic works through the winter. Seems like a summer type of thing. Maybe it just goes into Pub mode. It looked like a really neat place so I'll definitely check it out.
Reno,2jnilx,TheMapesHotel,1 point,Sun Oct 19 01:43:10 2014 UTC,"Maybe I'm mistaken, but I think Pignic will be serving pre-cooked food eventually. I was under the impression they're letting people use the grill during their soft open before they get a full menu set up...?      And I probably saw the same interior picture of BLCC as /u/agiverofhighfives . I second its niceness!"
Reno,2jnilx,TheMapesHotel,2,Sun Oct 19 01:55:24 2014 UTC,"love all the new things happening, for sure. Pignic is brand new, and i don't entirely get the concept, but they surely did their research before embarking on such a thing, and i wish them well. BLCC was a surprise to me -- i thought they were doing well, so i'm glad to hear they are just rebranding. and don't forget there's a new place with wine/some cocktails/small bites next door to the Old Granite St. Eatery, a place called Royce. i hear it's ok."

Reno,2jnilx,msxenobia,0,Tue Oct 21 14:48:11 2014 UTC,"That was the worst of it but it was a hellish dinner all around. They lost our reservation so we waited 1.5 hours for a table, they were out of bread and all appetizers, the heat wasn't working so they had to plug in a space heater and put it right by our table, plus the ceiling piece that fell on me. And to top it off the food was terrible! Mine was burnt and way too acidic. I was too upset by that point to even send it back. I took about three bites of a $20 dish, paid and left."
Reno,2jmfwz,TheMapesHotel,7,Sat Oct 18 17:55:57 2014 UTC,"My move to Nevada came straight out of left field.  My parents had come through Reno sometime in the 80's.  So, around the time I was in 7th grade, he decided that he wanted to build a house to retire to in the Virginia City Highlands.  So, we made a few trips, looked agt land, eventually, he bought some, and life moved on like normal for me.  Work on the house moved at a snails pace.  Fast forwards to my freshman year of highschool.  My mother had worked in sub prime mortgage lending for most of my life.  Seemingly out of nowhere, she gets a wild hair up her ass, and decides that she wants to move to the VC highlands like now.  The real reason she wanted to move was the impending economic meltdown of the mid 2000's.  As the meltdown approached, various states started heavily restricting mortgage lending.  My mom's company also worked in Nevada, and was shutting down in Ohio, so there it was.  In a couple of weeks they had gone and bought the house, and the move was happening.  Christmas that year was spent on the new house.  My mom would be living there alone while I finished my school year, and my dad prepared to sell his practice.  Thus began the golden era.  It was a time of unprecedented freedom.  As long as I did well in school, and stayed out of trouble, I could do whatever.  Come and go as I pleased, didn't even have to leave a note.  It was a great time, but soon came to an end.  After finals I was flying out to Nevada.  The first summer was horrible.  I didn't know anyone, I didn't have anyway to get around, and there was literally nothing to do that I could walk to ( I wish I had  known about reddit back then).    School started up, and things eventually got better, I found friends, regained my sense of freedom, and really came to appreciate my new life.  Eventually, I went to UNLV, didn't care much for it, transferred to UNR, graduated last may, and have been working here waiting for my next step in life."

My (now) fiance and I met as freshman at a NorCal University and subsequently found ourselves with a puppy rescued off the streets during one of the coldest nights on record for the area during winter 2006.  I should now mention that while we were in a hippy paradise, the far North CA coast is extremely un-dog friendly to renters, and yeah, that sucked.  We managed to keep our ""Anne Frank"" a secret for quite a while, but we eventually got caught because he barked at the door (damn it!).  At the time my SO's bro was trying to sell his place in West Reno and agreed to let us crash there.  A few months later my SO's mom bought a ""vacation"" house for herself nearby and we have been living/stuck there for a while now, not with her, but she's the landlord, ugh.  While it's nice to have family (both of ours) near by, and not to mention a dog-friendly place, we are California/democratic/hippie people at heart and looking to GTFO."

Reno,2jc2jz,aguadefuego,7,Thu Oct 16 23:13:48 2014 UTC,"BJCP Recognized Beer Judge, homebrewer, and beer lover. Lets see.  Also note, I am excluding BJ's because they are a chain and not ""Reno""   Great Basin I think has the best beer. In flavor and selection. I would rank Great Basin number 1. I would then put Silver Peak next. They have generally pretty decent beers plus they are walking distance to my house. Generally the food is pretty good as well. Now we get into the lesser known breweries. Here I would rank Under The Rose. While still new, they are producing good beer. I am always excited when I find their tap handle and will get them over Silver Peak or Great Basin. Plus Scott is a good guy. Thursday nights they have food trucks at their brewery on 4th street. Next I would put Brasserie. The beer is generally pretty good. I am not a big fan of Belgians generally but I will drink them. Their food is the best out of this list but definitely at a price. After Brasserie I would put Brewer's Cabinet. This also makes the last of my list. They need some more work on their beer. But the food is definitely getting better and I have seen some improvement in the beer over the last few months. I know the owner here as well. Good guy just a few more kinks to iron out.   The ones I haven't tried or in significant quantity enough to judge.   Stoneyhead Brewing: http://www.stoneyheadbrewing.com/ Pigeon Head: https://www.facebook.com/pigeonheadbrewery Brew Brothers: http://www.eldoradoreno.com/reno-restaurants/the-brew-brothers/   Although Pigeon head did have a fantastic Oktoberfest beer at the Drinkable Reno Epic Local Beer Dinner. When I tried their Red it left some to be desired.  I don't remember anything from Stoneyhead. I know I have had them at beer festivals but that is when I am out of Judge mode and in ""lets get plastered"" mode."
Reno,2jc2jz,wartornhero,8,Wed Oct 15 18:44:22 2014 UTC,"I have to disagree on Silver Peak being so high up on a list such as this, I feel like their beers are mostly okay, they don't do anything exceptionally well, they maybe try to do too much, and a few I've had there were not really good at all."
Reno,2jc2jz,bangsecks,5,Wed Oct 15 21:10:32 2014 UTC,"Yeah, they don't do anything exceptionally well. But they are well made, on technical merit, and they are consistent. I can have Red Roadster tomorrow and have it 3-5 weeks from now and it will generally taste the same.  If I am at a beer festival and Silver Peak is there I generally won't seek them out. I will go to UTR or Brasserie. But part of that is because I get Silver Peak all the time.  Also their 15th anniversary beer is really good. Way better than GB 20th anniversary."
Reno,2jc2jz,wartornhero,5,Wed Oct 15 21:58:26 2014 UTC,"You really need to get down to Pigeon Head and try their Pils.  Its so clean and crisp, leaning more towards the Bohemian Pils style than German.  They really know how to treat their lager yeasts well!"

Reno,2jc2jz,aguadefuego,2,Thu Oct 16 23:12:06 2014 UTC,"Pigeon Head Brewing.  They are the only all lager brewery in Reno and damn they are good at it.  The Pils is amazing, Bolnde lager is fantastic, i honestly don't think i have had a beer from them that wasn't well balanced and amazingly drinkable.   Great Basin.  You really can't beat the variety at The Basin.  They have a good beer in about any style you could crave on an average night.    Brewers Cabinet.  I think they are ""growing up"" if you will.  While they weren't the best when i first went there they are defiantly heading in the right direction. They can brew a quite delicious IPA and they are on par with their sour game.     Brasserie. If Belgians are your thing, they are right up your ally. Interesting combinations that always leaving my palate guessing what will be next in the complex flavors of their beers.    Silver Peak.  Kind of the same as Basin in my book, cant go wrong with any of their beers really.    Brew Brothers.  Decent beer, can't really complain to much about quality but its nothing special by any means.  The whole club vibe isn't really my thing either so i stay away from there any time after 10pm. Under the Rose.  I really want to like these guys because like Wartornhero said, Scott is a rad dude.  However, i just cant get into their beers, i don't think its an off flavor issue but maybe the balance is off for my tastes.  All subjective i guess.   Stoney Head.  Now i am not going to get on a soapbox and shit all over this guys dream.  I did buy a total of 3 six packs aver the past year or so and 75% of them have had a high amount of esters (banana flavor) or taste like some aceto bacteria got in there (vinegary). Would not buy again unfortunately."
Reno,2jc2jz,GoinDH,1 point,Wed Oct 15 20:43:19 2014 UTC,"Yeah, Brewer's Cabinet, when I went not long after they opened, had a sour beer that was essentially carbonated vinegar.  Not that I don't like a good, strong sour beer, but there should be some subtlety, you have to know how to modulated it and keep the sour within a range, not just pour some acetobacter in there and let it rip until you've got glacial acetic acid or something.  It was poorly done."
Reno,2jc2jz,bangsecks,3,Wed Oct 15 21:17:17 2014 UTC,"Funny you say their first sours were overly sour as a buddy and i were just talking about that same thing.      I believe it was the first of the 1982 Cantaloupe sour that was the acid bomb, which honestly i enjoyed.  I attribute that to the same thought process that came with the double IPA craze.  Well if a little hop is good, a metric fuckton must be better!! Well, yes and no.     Yes due to the fact that you must establish what is too much.  As a homebrewer when i made my first sour i decided to see just how sour i could make a Berliner Weisse, really just to see what i could get away with and what i couldn't. Now that i have brewed a few i absolutely don't make them as sour as the first but at least i know where to stop.   No because, well i think you stated it just fine, that shit was way over bearing on the palate.  There was nothing else to enjoy in the beer besides the acidic quality the pedio heavy bacteria mix brought to the beer.  I think BC is headed in the right direction with like you said, bringing modesty into consideration with their sours. I really enjoyed the sour cherry they had recently and cant wait for the next!    I don't think this point really takes away from the fact you didn't enjoy their sour. I did find that conversion i had quite interesting and thought i would share.  Oh and i hope they don't throw acetobacter in any of their sours, that would be terrible haha."
Reno,2jc2jz,GoinDH,4,Wed Oct 15 22:47:00 2014 UTC,"You're spot on with the hop craze, I'm a little tired with this insistence in the American craft brew scene that we have to hop the fuck out of every style, especially styles that aren't normally too hoppy, such that so much out there commercially available is hop water.  Not that I dislike hops, but knowing when and where to emphasize what ingredient is what makes for all the variety that makes something like beer or whatever enjoyable, not just dialing everything up to 11, there's no art in that.  I'll have to stop by Brewer's Cabinet some time again and give one of their sours a try."
Reno,2jc2jz,bangsecks,2,Wed Oct 15 23:06:21 2014 UTC,"You should definitely give them another try, much improved since first opening. Even switched brewers."

Reno,2j27f4,bagthree,4,Mon Oct 13 07:34:12 2014 UTC,"I'm a housekeeper and I use craigslist to advertise my services. Ive had a lot (and I mean A LOT) of weirdos wanting my pics. And those same weirdos also send me dick pics. But I've also had some good clients come from it.   Some tips to get more prospective clients: Use ""big"" words. Example ""Proficient in speaking, reading and writing the English language"" Also, be sure to specify the services that you provide. Use a list format for easier reading. Be sure to include the areas that you would like to serve. For example, if you live in South Reno it wouldn't be worth your time to drive all the way out to Spanish Springs for 2-3 hours a week at 10/hr.   Be sure you have some references. Even just friends or acquaintances that can vouch for you.   And this is a sad truth, but you can easily charge 15-20/hr if you're a young white woman. A lot of the clients I've had will readily admit that they are willing to pay more because of that. I don't agree but it's just reality.   Sorry if this post is jumbled. Good luck."

If you guys can't find anything to do other than drink, gamble, and pay for naked ladies, you aren't trying very hard.  OP, take up an outdoor hobby.  Skiing, rock climbing, back packing, dirt biking, hunting - whatever interests you.  Take some classes or just go to the places they go (REI, Patagonia Outlet, climbing gym, Cabelas, etc) and sign up for whatever upcoming event they're promoting (they always have some sort of charity work or group outing).  Or just start talking to the guy that works in the department that interest you and find out where he hangs out - chances are, it's the same place similar people hang out.  You'll meet other people that share your interests and those people will take you out next time they go.  You'll quickly break into a few different circles of friends, meet some great people, including women who share the same interests as you, and get to enjoy everything Northern Nevada has to offer!

Keep in mind though, Carson City is about a 30 minute drive, so probably check if any groups are close to you before searching Reno.   I will say, when I lived in the area a few years ago, I had to be pretty proactive in order to meet new people.  You really need to go out and make an effort to actively engage others in conversation.  Also, there are things to do besides drinking and gambling, despite what others say.  Just check out one of the Meetup groups that suits your interest as a start.  Congrats on the new job, and good luck!"

Everyone thinks I was a target because I'm a white guy living in a very predominantly Mexican neighborhood. There are like four or five cars around that are the same as mine. I never did anything to piss anyone off. I also don't want to bring race into this. The police were pretty nice though and that's a good thing to known that they look out for them.

Fuck their stupid weekend parties. Fuck their late night arguments. Fuck their stupid shitty fake rim cars. Fuck their fucking culture. I've always loved everybody but now I hate Mexicans. I can just picture them now going through all my shit in my car. Luckily nothing super important was in there but there were a lot of sentimental things.   Edit: I shouldnt say these things.

Reno,2imbg5,Brocktoberfest,5,Wed Oct 8 01:48:18 2014 UTC,Nice to see the dominos falling after the SCOTUS kicked a review to the curb. No we can learn which states want to stay in the dark ages.

Reno,2imbg5,haroldp,3,Wed Oct 8 17:30:10 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it is a little more difficult in Nevada.  The easiest way:  You have to live in Nevada and be ordained by a church that holds non-profit status in the state.  (I went with Universal Life Church.  You can get all the necessary paperwork online for about $40.)  Then you have to file an application with the County Clerk in the county in which you live.  This costs $25 (if I remember correctly) plus a $45 background check.  So all told, it's a little over $100.  If you are not a felon, don't have back child support, etc...you should be approved within a month.  If you live in another state and have been ordained there, you can apply to perform a single ceremony in Nevada (the $45 background check is waived).  If you are a notary public and live in Nevada, you can apply to solemnize marriages without being ordained."

Reno,2iooym,statikuz,1 point,Wed Oct 8 19:35:54 2014 UTC,Replacing your headlight wiring harness is going to be a boatload cheaper than buying aftermarket HIDs and trying to wire them up; I don't see how that would save you any work either. I've done it before and there's not much to it.  What's wrong with yours right now? What kind of car is it?
Reno,2iooym,themosthatedone,1 point,Wed Oct 8 19:55:11 2014 UTC,"No I have to replace my WHOLE wiring harness... The problem is deeper than just the headlight area. It would be ~$1000 to replace it all and do the labor.   I dont have the proper tools to do it and honestly I fear braking something in my car. I rather pay someone with a little experience. Currently, My passenger side HID is out but works 1 out of 10 times I start my car which is a 2008 Mazda3 hatchback.

I laid out my concerns about the 85:15 payout ratio, as well as some possible ideas to help them gain some exposure without having to incur any out of pocket advertising costs. Basically, I suggested running several hunts a year, but following the NV Day Hunt model for their first round. Partner with a local media outlet, and some sponsors to contribute prize $$. Once you have some local interest, you can then try your hand at the paid hunt, hopefully offer 50% payout, and still walk away with more money in their pocket than they would have had using their previous model."
Reno,2ilq1z,jaydscustom,8,Tue Oct 7 22:20:17 2014 UTC,This is either very very entry-level or you're not paying this person enough.
Reno,2ilq1z,battleborn,1 point,Wed Oct 8 01:50:33 2014 UTC,"Sounds clearly ""very very entry-level"" to me.  This sounds more like a tech gopher position (i.e. the working on locks, power tools, etc).  Definitely more of a stepping-stone type position if you're looking to make real IT a career, or a good first job type of deal just to get some work experience."
Reno,2ilq1z,hairylunch,1 point,Wed Oct 8 18:47:04 2014 UTC,"Sound perfectly entry level, just like he said it's perfect for a student. Looks like all he needs is a reasonably tech savvy person who can follow instructions. $14 is more than enough. You're not likely to find anyone with any real AD or Exchange experience though, if you've got that you can probably find an on campus job."
Reno,2ilq1z,statikuz,0,Wed Oct 8 04:47:47 2014 UTC,I don't need them to have experience with it. I just want them to know that it exists and what the function is. All this person would be doing is creating and removing accounts and resetting passwords.   I'm not really questioning if it's a good wage because I have gotten a few messages from some people that are qualified and excited for the opportunity.
Reno,2ilq1z,popnwave,1 point,Wed Oct 8 05:39:02 2014 UTC,"Care to explain? When was the last time you searched for an entry level position?   By all means, if our company is paying too little, I'd surely go to HR and tell them we can't get anyone with this pay, but judging by my inbox, I think people who are in the market or looking to get a foot in the door think it's fair.    -link- -link 2-. Even in 2010, when the demand was much higher, this pay would have been the low end of average. Keep in mind, this is a starting wage.  Thanks for your input though, bud.    Edit: cleanliness."
Reno,2ilq1z,popnwave,3,Wed Oct 8 03:27:05 2014 UTC,"My main gripe about this pay, and so far since being here in Reno is the lack of shift differentials for IT stuff.   Eh $13.50 not so bad for a very entry-level  daytime shift, but swing (2nd) or later (3rd) people really should be getting some sort of compensation for that.  The other thing I've learned about casino work is it's rarely traditional IT by any means. All the odd stuff that goes on in gaming establishments gets lumped on to you and most certs people get in the traditional sense for IT go out the window :)"
Reno,2ilq1z,ajoros,1 point,Wed Oct 8 04:32:32 2014 UTC,"I'm picking up what you're putting down. And that makes sense.   Like I said, it's great for students who go to school during the day and need to get their foot in the door. And yeah, we do take care of some weird stuff sometimes, but it breaks the monotony of it. I like to get away from the desk and use tools every now and then. As with anything in IT, everyone has a different opinion. I think it's a good wage, and people looking for a job like this think it's a good wage. Mainly, it's the people who have jobs in IT that don't think it is."

Reno,2ilq1z,ATPMachine,3,Wed Oct 8 06:07:55 2014 UTC,"First, I'm not your bud, pal.  Sure, I'll explain.  My first job out of school 6 years ago required fewer skills than you're seeking, and I received a higher wage than you're offering.  Also, I worked at a casino in a previous life and their techs made more than that as well.  So, my explanation is my relevant experience.  I suppose since you're looking for a student and/or someone possibly lacking a formal education then this position and wage do make plenty of sense; I just remember the market supporting a bit higher wage since you are trusting someone with important information.  Messing up an email account for a senior executive or blowing up a RAID config by improperly replacing a drive can have some pretty serious implications for a casino who has to report to the Gaming Commission.  You might get someone who is still an entry-level person but is bringing in stronger skills if you either don't advertise the rate or you offer something a little higher.  Anyway, I'm sure I wasted my words because it looks like you already have plenty of applicants."
Reno,2ilq1z,Interestinmiltary,0,Wed Oct 8 22:12:54 2014 UTC,"I'm not your pal, friend. :)  And yes, you did waste your words, especially since you said ""...this position and wage do make plenty of sense"".   Tell me, what were you in your past life? I think I was a cheetah."

Reno,2hn1fo,chriskmee,7,Sat Sep 27 19:55:16 2014 UTC,"I lived in reno last year. I'd highly recommend getting the alpine meadows/squaw valley pass.  The road to mt rose can get shut down and boreal is right at donners, which can get shut down also. You will get bored of both after a couple days.  Squaw and alpine are both epic in their own right. Lots of hikes. I went every weekend last season and alpine has less crowds and a good progression park. Squaws just world class.  I really can't emphasize the superior ness of squaw/alpine. Insane back bowls with virgin powder. Plenty of spots to chill and smoke. Nice parks. Two mountains. Silver pass was 550"

Mt Rose is a good mountain, close to town, small enough to be a locals' joint, good scene at lodge. Plus, the Chutes.  Nice thing about Mt Rose is if you just want 2-4 runs, or only have a couple of hours, it's the place to go."
Reno,2hn1fo,somoza910,1 point,Sun Sep 28 15:14:37 2014 UTC,"Boreal is good for being first to open/close with lots of man made snow and park.  If you want to do anything besides park, then get Rose (or any of the other resorts).  Night skiing is sort of an unknown concept here, and it really surprised me when I moved here from Ohio where places would open till 3AM.  Where I'd learned/grew up was tiny so lighting the whole thing was easy, whereas out here there's no way to light any significant portion of trail."
Reno,2hn1fo,redditfordisaster,1 point,Tue Sep 30 19:14:05 2014 UTC,"If I were you, I'd go with the squaw/alpine meadows pass.  Both are big enough that you won't get bored.  Depending on your style of riding and skill level, you'll find yourself covering the mountain ( definitely boreal and probably rose) within 3 or so hours.  But what I haven't seen mentioned yet is homewood.  It's a bit of a drive, because it's one the west shore of the lake right about in the middle.  But hands down my favorite resort, views that rival heavenly, cheap, not usually crowded, and you park and you can be on the lift within 10 minutes.  I wouldn't buy a pass there tho, because it's probably a bit smaller than rose(?), but definitely check it out.  The only downside to homewood is the drive, and the lifts are a bit slow."
Reno,2hn1fo,MarkJolle,1 point,Wed Oct 1 17:10:01 2014 UTC,"Getting a pass to Rose again this season. Its the cheaper resort out of the big Tahoe ones, and it's very convenient. Worth your money if you're not looking for the ultimate experience but still love to get out and enjoy some good powder. To most people boreal is a joke, and Rose is the next step up among the great resorts around Tahoe."

Reno,2hn1fo,MarkJolle,1 point,Tue Oct 7 06:39:59 2014 UTC,"If you buy a North Star pass you get Heavenly and Kirkwood automatically... it isn't that much more. It takes me 35 - 45 minutes to drive from Reno to Mt. Rose. It takes me 45 - 55 minutes to get to North Star. I am just saying, it's a pretty good deal."
Reno,2hn1fo,MarkJolle,2,Sat Sep 27 20:51:38 2014 UTC,"Ugh.  I will preface this by saying I hate Northstar - it's my absolute least favorite of all the resorts by far - but if you're talking just time to drive to the resorts, it's really disingenuous to say it only takes 10 minutes more to get to Northstar.  When you park at Rose, you can walk across the lot and be on the lift in 5 minutes.  At Northstar you have to take a shuttle from the parking lot that often adds 20+ more minutes.  And Heavenly has spectacular terrain but is the ultimate South Lake clusterfuck.  Boreal is kinda trashy.  Don't leave anything unattended for even a second.  Mt. Rose all the way."
Reno,2hn1fo,MarkJolle,-1,Sat Sep 27 22:41:23 2014 UTC,"First, you mean ""if""  you can park at Rose, not to mention the UNBELIEVABLE traffic on those fresh powder days. Second, $40 more for 3 EXPANSIVE resorts vs.  1 middling ""resort"", yeah right. Third, you obviously don't ski Park and don't care for trees. I have heard the Northstar hate before, but it usually amounts to the same thing, pure bias. I have nothing against Rose, hell I learned there, but it can't hold a candle to the 3 pack deal, period."

Apparently there is only allowed 1 dispensary per county and Washoe has never approved anyone, thus meaning there is no dispensaries. So you can grow it, buy it from someone who grows, or drive to Las Vegas. Those are the only ""legal"" options. I go the other route.  Got hit with a DUID that I'm fighting because NHP illegally (have to have a warrant now to search someones car no matter what, and also need a warrant to take their bodily fluids, I.E. Blood/urine). And am spending thousands of dollars in order to hopefully get it dropped.   Think of all the tax dollars we would save even if we released inmates whom were there on marijuana based crimes (granted nothing violent was involved with their arrest). I just think there are too many Republicans in Nevada to get a majority vote. Unless the younger community actually votes (this is something they would turn out for), maybe we could sway the scales.   RPD is usually alright with weed. I've been stopped on more than one occasion and just been told to go home, and the worst case was they took the weed and broke the pipe (classic cop ""lesson""). Second I get pulled over by NHP straight to jail. Have had 1 speeding ticket in my life when I was 17 in California. I'm 29 now.

When the scary dude appears all of the ash moves around and does creepy stuff. It's mostly the coal fires and smoke and ash that reminded me of it. I suppose the nurses would be better suited.

Reno,2h9ktr,jeepinfreak,3,Wed Sep 24 01:05:31 2014 UTC,"If your friends aren't moving from Turnipseed Falls then they have probably seen fuck ups acting up in a downtown park before and can expand their view of the city beyond one unfortunate incident.  An unfortunate incident, that while unpleasant, is hardly some post-apocalyptic nightmare scene.  (Crabapple-throwing!)  That doesn't sound like enough to make someone reject moving to a place, especially since you obviously were upset by this kind of scene.  Had you reacted more desensitized to the incident, that would have been worse."

If there was a patrol, and they visited the area and nothing was going on, it'd be no surprise that they weren't there at that particular moment.   If you didn't call it in... there's no way for them to know that something untoward was happening and their attention was required."
Reno,2h9ktr,PearlyDewdropsDrops,0,Tue Sep 23 21:42:57 2014 UTC,"By the time it became an actual crime, it was over and too late to call.

It would make sense to me to expand their patrol route through there not just during events."

Reno,2h9ktr,prelimar,2,Wed Sep 24 06:39:56 2014 UTC,"You weren't there. I'm documenting something I couldn't even believe was even happening as it occurred. If I weren't afraid for my own safety and those I was with I may have acted more boldly.   We had already been harassed so we moved on rather than get ganged on by 15 punks. Am I wrong in that? They had already threatened us when we took our phones out, yelling at us to mind our own business.  Yeah I totally should have taken out my phone and googled the number for RPD, but it's fight or flight and I guess I'm a total pussy in that regard. I'm from a small rural town so I'm new to this shit. The only time you call 911 is when your neighbor's barn is on fire.   Next time those rats run in your direction with fists and boards, go ahead and take the time to call it in.   I had no evidence at the time they were going to seriously hurt him or I would have interfered, but I wasn't sure if I understood the situation or not.   We can go do a citizen's watch together if you want, but I'm not going to risk the parents of two children for what you perceive as morality.   I fully intend to contact RPD and tell them what I saw, just wanted to know what this community knew about this group of assholes and if there is a pattern."

You think crime doesn't occur in rural towns ? Or do you mean there its normal to just sit and watch it ?   They had already threatened us when we took our phones out, yelling at us to mind our own business.   Good sheep. Obeying and following directions. Way to set an example to your children!   no evidence at the time they were going to seriously hurt him   So harassment and bullying is not worth reporting, only serious injury ? Guess what?

It is sad that you don't care enough about your own safety to do anything about it.   There is a need to carry everywhere because you never know when you may need to protect yourself.

They did stress to me that they opted out and would stay opted out for as long as that is an option. They believed that it was a way for the power company to save money while not caring about their customers.

Reno,2gqgcf,chriskmee,0,Thu Sep 18 04:57:07 2014 UTC,"While school shootings have been rare, even one is too much IMO. Criminals can get guns, and no law is going to stop that from happening, so what do we do to help prevent the problem?  One option is to ban certain guns, or restrict access to weapons. Detroit and LA have a lot of gun crime, and also have some of the strictest weapon laws in the country. ""Gun free zones"" have been the most popular place for recent mass shootings (all school ones, Oregon Mall, movie theater, etc). I think its clear that getting rid of guns doesn't help, ""Gun free zones"" are only ""Free of law abiding citizens with guns zone"". So if getting rid of guns doesn't seem to work, then what do we do? One common thought is to get rid of gun free zones, because they don't work."
Reno,2gqgcf,BeardoTheBowler,6,Thu Sep 18 15:59:34 2014 UTC,"Get rid of gun free zones, encourage the responsibility of personal defense and safety. It's far quicker to defend yourself than to call the police and wait."
Reno,2gqgcf,chriskmee,7,Thu Sep 18 16:51:10 2014 UTC,I agree. This is why I choose to conceal carry everywhere I can and avoid areas where I can't conceal carry.
Reno,2gqgcf,BeardoTheBowler,2,Thu Sep 18 17:19:53 2014 UTC,"Likewise. However, I don't avoid places that ""ban"" conceal carry (ban in quotes because you can legally conceal carry anywhere in Nevada that isn't a government building.) I don't consciously avoid them because it's still my right to conceal carry in those businesses."
Reno,2gqgcf,chriskmee,1 point,Thu Sep 18 18:58:30 2014 UTC,"Yea, I was talking more about CA, government buildings, Indian reservations, etc. If a place just has a sign, I will normally conceal carry anyways, but I will make a mental note of it and try to find an alternative if I can."
Reno,2gqgcf,BeardoTheBowler,1 point,Thu Sep 18 20:34:21 2014 UTC,You can't really encourage students to carry weapons.  But we could certainly find a better program to curb school shootings.
Reno,2gqgcf,chriskmee,10,Thu Sep 18 17:38:04 2014 UTC,"I think the first step is totally revamping how we approach mental health. If you catch these people early on, a lot can be done to make sure they don't act on their urges. A little prevention would go a long way. I would still encourage students to carry. Not kids, but say college kids over 18."

My problem is the police who then have said weapons, think they are in fact those soldiers of war.  Case in point, Ferguson,MO; police were running around in camouflage pointing automatic weapons at unarmed civilians. School police are hardly a step up from rent a cop.  The day we need them to carry automatic weapons of war, will be the same day that, you too, will need to carry the same weapons to fight off an invading force."
Reno,2gqgcf,chriskmee,2,Thu Sep 18 17:04:31 2014 UTC,"These are automatic rifles used in combat... Not guns.   According to the source you posted for this thread, they are semi automatic."

The surplus program isn't modifying these weapons, so unless WCSD is, they are automatic M-16's which is a select fire variant of a civilian AR15. Here's a link to an article that's written by someone who did a more in depth investigation into ASU http://cronkitenewsonline.com/2014/09/asu-other-campuses-stock-up-on-surplus-military-rifles-under-federal-program/   Semantics.  We're not in a fucking war in the mean streets of Reno, so there is literally no reason for school police to have these weapons, other than to free up surplus for the feds to buy more weapons from defense contractors.  Or maybe to fight of the invading armies of ISIS?"
Reno,2gqgcf,hunteqthemighty,3,Thu Sep 18 17:36:44 2014 UTC,"There are many sources saying they are getting semi automatic ones   In Florida, Rick Stelljes, the chief of Pinellas county schools police, said the county possessed 28 semi-automatic M16 rifles   http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/18/us-school-districts-given-free-machine-guns-and-grenade-launchers   In Utah, the Granite School District's police force has three, Vietnam-era M16s that it received in the program eight years ago, district spokesman Ben Horsley said. The weapons, which are not fully automatic,   http://www.heraldextra.com/news/state-and-regional/utah/legislators-scrutinize-military-surplus-program/article_7bceec0c-8786-5b9a-8e29-d4ba00340361.html  And another source saying they got fully automatic ones and converted them   The campus police chief, Rhonda Harris, said the remaining rifles were converted to semiautomatic, meaning they can’t shoot like machine guns. Officers still have access to them.   http://wtkr.com/2014/08/25/military-surplus-weapons-sent-to-college-campuses/  All I can say is that if they specifically stated that they got semi automatic rifles, then they likely got semi automatic rifles or they were converted fully automatic ones. They could have just said ""m16 rifles"", but specifically say ""semi automatic m16 rifles"", so he must have come to the semi automatic conclusion somehow."

So not the M16A2s I have been seeing in pictures of the WCSD rifles.  Vietnam-era M16s had a fire selector for semi or full auto, and would have had to have been modified to be semiautomatic only.  M16A2s have a selector for semi or three-round burst.  Are we just calling three round burst, ""semiautomatic"" for purposes of public relations?    http://wtkr.com/2014/08/25/military-surplus-weapons-sent-to-college-campuses/   This link in fact says several schools received fully-automatic M16s and one school took it upon themselves to convert them to semiautomatic."

Reno,2gqgcf,chriskmee,1 point,Thu Sep 18 18:07:35 2014 UTC,"Jesus. All this is a circle jerk. They're not taking the M16's because they're military issue or because they need to wage war against school shooters, they're taking them because they're fucking free guns. Obviously a police department isn't going to pass up a chance for bigger guns that are free.   Also, school cops go through the same training as Sparks or Reno PD. Its not like WCSD hired ESI guys to come in to schools and hand them a gun and tell them to have fun. The cops will be trained with these weapons and know what they are capable of. A majority of the cops at my school were actually the gang unit, and those guys were fucking badass.   Lastly, the cops aren't going to be walking around the schools with these at the ready. I'm willing to bet that the 8 or whatever they issue are going to go to like one officer per school that has the most problems and the M16 is going to sit in the back of their squad car. Those things probably will never see the inside of a school."
Reno,2gqgcf,WitBeer,5,Thu Sep 18 17:39:22 2014 UTC,"You made the point for me...These weapons will only be used for intimidating civilians, and empowering cops who have a sworn oath to be ""badasses"".

School cops then show up to disperse the protest with M-16s.  Dafuq?"
Reno,2gqgcf,chriskmee,1 point,Thu Sep 18 17:50:15 2014 UTC,"I'm willing to bet that the only time that these weapons are going to be shot is at the range. And after like 2 weeks you're gonna forget that they have them. Youre worried about an M16 that's going to sit in the car but for as long as I remember the school cops have carried Beretta 9mm's on them and we haven't had a problem with that. I'm willing to bet that if a cop goes crazy he's reaching for the one on his hip instead of trying to go find the M16  The way he is trained he wouldn't do that, but humans fuck up too. I do believe that a cop could take it too far and do something out of the norm that puts people in danger. But also what if there is a guy with a hunting rifle up in a parking lot above the school taking shots down? The handguns they're issued won't make that distance and he's shooting directly at the school and students. You wouldn't be okay with them shooting the M16 for at least suppressing fire to keep him hiding and not shooting at the students until SWAT could come?"
Reno,2gqgcf,WitBeer,0,Thu Sep 18 18:07:51 2014 UTC,they're taking them because they're fucking free guns   there is no free lunch.  how much more do bullets cost for an m16? storage lockers? training? higher insurance?
Reno,2gqgcf,cambria05,1 point,Thu Sep 18 20:37:45 2014 UTC,"They actively sought out these weapons, or employed someone to do so.  They will now have more training, not much but it is our money paying for these wannabe Marines to have unnecessary toys."

Reno,2gqgcf,chriskmee,3,Thu Sep 18 17:22:13 2014 UTC,"the school shooters have always been 14 year olds. And they need parenting and they need school counselors to do their job. Cops arent superheros and guns arent magic, and more often than not, cops are a horrible shot. They can't teleport to where a shooting may occur with enough time to stop it. They're more likely to hit a kid than the shooter. and what happens when a cop with an M16 goes rogue? He kills 100 kids.  and the school shooters tend to be smart(er than cops). what'll happen is they'll kill the cop with the m16 first, and then continue, and now they'll probably have an extra m16 to use.  i'm honestly amazed that i'm even having this discussion. this is all so fucking backwards that you could actually want M16's inside of a school. seriously, what school did you go to, cause i want to see if I need to move my kids. you clearly didn't learn much."

Flooding does occur, but in places close to the river. Some areas don't ever see flood such as the Northwest--at least not in my 16 years here.   Earthquakes are your biggest issue, but even those are pretty minor. In fact I've only ever really taken notice of one."
Reno,2grgoq,PuppyBreath,6,Thu Sep 18 14:25:49 2014 UTC,"Earthquakes aren't as frequent as say southern California, but they are still a possibility.   Flooding can be an issue in certain areas. We have a river running right through downtown. If you're far enough away it's not an issue.   Wildfires are a risk on the outskirts of town if you are near or in the foothills.   Wind isn't as much an issue since we have it so frequently the infrastructure is built to handle it. Lots of power lines are buried because of this."
Reno,2grgoq,raven12456,5,Thu Sep 18 14:33:54 2014 UTC,"We, overall, have very low instances of natural disasters. I have lived here since 1983- in my time we have had 2 'large' floods downtown. One in 1997 and in 2007. There was a flood in Fernley, east of Sparks, due to a levy failure also. They are exceptions to the rule. Wind is far more common with outlying areas seeing damage to roofs and fences.   Additionally, fire season in the area can be disastrous; there have been a handful of fires in the foothills and outlying areas that destroyed homes. Wind is also contributory to this. We also get afternoon thunder/lightening storm which can spark fires during the summer.   Micro-quake storms happen from time to time, but there have been no major ones in Reno. Even in 'wet' years, snow is rare on the valley floors, much more common in the outlying areas. Drought is common; it's the desert. We do get cold, but not the bitter ice-storms of the Midwest.

We have had a few floods downtown near the river, which is a result of the army corps of engineers straightening it with dynamite 50 years ago and screwing up the natural flood plains. Again, extremely rare, and you can just avoid those specific areas or buy insurance.  Earthquakes are actually more common in Nevada than a lot of other places, but they are usually small and out in the middle of the state where nobody lives. In the Reno area they are extremely rare, but there is a fault in the area, so if you're superstitious buy insurance.  Wind, as you said, is our biggest problem. We don't get hurricanes or tornadoes, but we do occasionally get hurricane-force winds coming down off the mountains that throw around trampolines and destroy roofs, fences and billboards. Nothing too serious that can't be prepared for.  Power is lost very infrequently. Geothermal power can't be interrupted by anything short of Armageddon, and most of our residential power lines are underground and therefore unaffected by storms."

I would guess Reno comes out pretty safe.  I would also say natural disasters are much less of a problem here than most other places I've lived, earthquakes being the only one I've ever heard much about, they were minimal and most damage was in certain areas a bit outside of the heart of the city.  The biggest thing we seem to face recently is just smoke from California fires."

Reno,2g8mjm,sierra400,4,Fri Sep 12 21:51:26 2014 UTC,I've lived right next to that lake for 3 years and the only construction I've seen is the very recent stuff on the east side. That lake was gross well before that. It definitely could be getting runoff from the golf course but do they use much fertilizer on that? So while I am leaning the opposite direction as you on this issue I agree that there should be an actual study as to the cause of the bloom before making any hasty decisions. For all we know it could just be an excuse to take the island out because the new buildings going up don't want all the birds around crapping on everything.
Reno,2g8mjm,Norillim,10,Sat Sep 13 02:04:16 2014 UTC,The problem with virginia lake is that the inlet and the outlet are on the same side of the lake.  Virginia lake has been a stagnant receptacle of rotting ass for as long as I can remember.  We need to get rid of that lake entirely.

As with any lake with birds roosting you're going to deal with a lot of bird shit and the subsequent smell. The fountains are always running when I've driven and run past. Occasionally geese or ducks block the road way, crossing to the opposite side. I've seen more than one run over bird carcass due to unobservant drivers."

Reno,2fzpz1,Beerbrewing,5,Wed Sep 10 09:39:57 2014 UTC,"No specific restaurant recommendation, but some suggestions:   go with a friend or someone you trust that can help you out - menus tend to be overwhelming, with so many choices the pickled ginger, soy sauce, and wasabi should all be treated more like condiments than essential parts of the sushi.  Try to enjoy the flavors of the fish, rice, and roll components on their own, before you drown the thing in soy sauce. Nigiri refers to the slice of fish on rice, sashimi is just the fish without rice (which you won't get on AYCE), long rolls are what they sound like, and hand rolls are basically long rolls put into a cone of nigiri and eaten more like an ice cream cone than in sliced pieces.  Try a bit of each to see which presentation and balance you like.   Nigiri tips:   Eel and upside down shrimp are easy intros as they're cooked and sweet. The most accessible raw fish for most people is probably salmon, followed by yellowtail and tuna.  These are milder flavors and textures aren't too crazy.   Roll tips:   I'm a bit of a purist and prefer the simpler rolls, where the fish is the main component, and there's only 2-4 ingredients.  More modern rolls tend to have a half-dozen or more ingredients, half inside, and half on top, and you'll see things like cream cheese and deep fried. For simple rolls, things like like Arizona, tuna, and rainbow rolls are good starts. Try a spider roll (deep fried soft-shell crab) For the big, fancy (and sometimes dinner only) rolls, I'd say ask the chef what's popular.  Try something with cream cheese and something deep fried and see what you think.  I don't like either of these as I think they tend to overwhelm the fish, but other people love it.   As an aside, most fish consumed raw in the US has been frozen as the FDA requires it, i.e.:   http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/799881 http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/08/nyregion/sushi-fresh-from-the-deep-the-deep-freeze.html   As the NY Times mentions, tuna is free from this FDA regulation.  I'm not sure if anywhere in town actually gets fresh tuna.  My guess would be no . . ."

Reno,2fzpz1,statikuz,4,Wed Sep 10 19:20:28 2014 UTC,Go to the Atlantis oyster bar. If you want single rolls they can do those at a table or if you go during lunch it's a cheaper all you can eat. It's really high quality and it's really delicious.

You can smell fish standing 20' outside of the entrance, the fish has never been very fresh, the rolls are fairly unoriginal, and the service has always been poor.  I would stick with pretty much any other place... The Joint, Hiroba, Sushi Pier I/II, Sushi Rose, and Rickshaw (haven't been here in a while) are all good choices."

Minato is great, although I hate recommending them because they are getting so busy but we absolutely think they are one of the best.  Good staff, great diverse menu, and one of the few that doesn't restrict menu items to the higher priced dinner only time.  In reality your Reno sushi experience isn't going to be super authentic japanese anywhere, but I bet you it will be delicious.

Reno,2fzpz1,hairylunch,2,Wed Sep 10 18:16:06 2014 UTC,"It depends on the species. I'm sure the tako is never fresh, but salmon and stuff can be. There is indeed a fresh fish truck that comes from sf every day and supplies many of the sushi restaurants and steak houses."
Reno,2fzpz1,Nasty_Ned,4,Wed Sep 10 16:19:22 2014 UTC,"As I mentioned in my other response, the FDA requires all fish that's being consumed raw to be frozen (except for tuna).

Reno,2fzpz1,miagia,1 point,Wed Sep 10 17:18:20 2014 UTC,"I've repeated this again and again, but no one seems to want to listen.  If you are eating raw fish then it has been frozen per FDA rules (with some exceptions).  Have my upvote, but don't plan on getting anywhere."
Reno,2fzpz1,SunsetShameAllstar,2,Thu Sep 11 23:59:11 2014 UTC,"Maybe for the upscale places, but not AYCES. Plus I've talked with several Oceano cooks and everything is frozen - even the salmon. How else do you think they can offer AYCE at those prices? Fresh sushi in coastal places is 5x higher in price than Reno and they don't offer AYCE. I have no problem with frozen as the flash freezing process works well and if thawed and prepared correctly comes out great. But telling people their frozen fish is fresh is not right."
Reno,2fzpz1,deadairdave,2,Wed Sep 10 16:49:57 2014 UTC,"For things that have parasites (salmon) I doubt it matters if you are on the coast or the inland areas.  They are equally as fresh.  For fish that contain parasites, the FDA provides guidance under their Parasite Destruction Guarantee. This states in part that fish intended to be consumed raw must be “frozen and stored at a temperature of -20°C (-4°F) or below for a minimum of 168 hours (7 days)”."

Reno,2futsq,cantredditright,3,Tue Sep 9 00:04:11 2014 UTC,"/r/wartornhero pretty much hit's in on the head.  This is an exceptionally dangerous sport. It makes NASCAR look kind of look like a bunch of toddlers bumbling about.  For almost 20 years, I've lived within a stone's throw of the course, and every time there's a crash, I'm just grateful it's not through my roof."

I mean, at least he was doing what he loved."
Reno,2futsq,throwawwayaway,5,Tue Sep 9 13:27:31 2014 UTC,Seems to happen every year. It is a dangerous sport and the conditions in Reno (especially as I look outside at the pretty heavy breeze)  I am sure make it difficult. The year before(2012) was particularly bad/news worthy because the plane went down in the stands.
Reno,2futsq,wartornhero,13,Tue Sep 9 15:07:30 2014 UTC,Since the races began in 1964 only 20 aviators have died in crashes.  According to Wikipedia The 2011 crash was the first to kill any spectators. I think that number is pretty good considering the fact that it involves racing a complex machine traveling at high speed relatively close to the ground in our notoriously unpredictable Nevada weather.
Reno,2futsq,GoinDH,3,Mon Sep 8 23:50:53 2014 UTC,I went in 2010 and sat in the bleachers pretty close to where the crash would happen the following year. I would go again if I could.

Reno,2fi3dx,dickbroom,12,Thu Sep 4 23:30:57 2014 UTC,"All of this is great news, and I've been rooting for Nevada to get the factory during this whole saga. I hope this creates jobs and I hope that Reno gets a much-needed economic boost.   A word of warning though. It's all very early on of course, but this warning is for down the road. As a person who lives in an overly-tech developed place, I know that when people are generally making more money, the cost of living goes up. Rent and many other things rise in cost.   I'm not saying it will happen, because I'm not sure it will. The governments of Reno and Nevada just need to make sure that growth that stems from this factory is matched by the growth of the rest of Reno. There is nothing worse than having an excess of people and a shortage of housing.   Basically, I dont want Reno to become the desert version of SF. Again I'm not sure it will be that way, but it's just something to keep an eye on down the road."
Reno,2fi3dx,elreydelasur,6,Fri Sep 5 00:22:38 2014 UTC,"You may not be entirely wrong on that count. A few years ago a national study was published and IIRC Reno had the highest wage to rent ratios in the country (people here spend more on rent for less space and make less money than almost anywhere else in the country. For places like SF and NY the median income is substantially higher.) So its already expensive to obtain housing here if you have one of the type of jobs that are common to this area. My husband has a decent job (by Reno's standards) and we still spend roughly half of our income on rent.   And economic analysts are already projecting the next housing bubble in this area as we have to attempt to accommodate not only 6,500 new employees but their families and those in the other businesses that will come here to support Tesla. While they are discussing finally finishing long standing projects like Kylie Ranch, the fact is an influx of that many new people needing houses will change the situation from the renters market it has been for the last few years into something where rents and housing prices shoot up."
Reno,2fi3dx,TheMapesHotel,3,Fri Sep 5 11:11:40 2014 UTC,"I was always under the impression that cost of living was fairly low in NV, at least below the national average. I never spent all that much on rent, etc. Then again, I'm a single person so it's easier for me to find cheap places to live.   I'm also hoping that Tesla doesn't bring in all 6,500 of the new employees. Am I naive in hoping that they're going to hire at least some locals?"
Reno,2fi3dx,elreydelasur,1 point,Fri Sep 5 15:54:42 2014 UTC,"I went to college and lived in Reno for years, I still own property up by Virginia City. I now live in San Diego after passing through SF and LA for school and work, I can guarantee that Reno's rent is out of control compared to wages. Sure, there are cheap places in Reno, just like there are cheap places on the beach down here. And the cheap places aren't nice, if you want a nice place to live Reno it's the same as anywhere; $1-1,500/month (at least).  The difference is, I make nearly twice as much here in SD as I could there. It's sad because I want to move back, but every job offer is simply laughable when the cost of living is essentially the same. Tesla will likely pay fairly well, the question is whether Reno has enough educated job seekers? I doubt it, there will be an influx from the Bay."
Reno,2fi3dx,NicolasCageHairClub,1 point,Fri Sep 5 17:24:21 2014 UTC,Fuck. that's somewhat depressing not gonna lie. I was thinking about moving back too when I get a decent salary going but now I'm having second thoughts
Reno,2fi3dx,elreydelasur,1 point,Fri Sep 5 17:48:49 2014 UTC,"It depends on what it is in the cost of living. Rent is cheap by some national standards but when compared to what most people make (there are not a lot of high paying jobs around here) it's pricey. There are two ways to gauge cost of living, either off the national average which is skewed by incredible highs and lows, and off the median income of the area. By national we are cheaper by median income we are not. Gas prices are equal to those in California but our public transit system is terrible so driving is needed. I've been told by many people our food prices are higher than a lot of areas. Utilities tend to be affordable and the lack of state tax balances some inequities.   I hope they will hirer locals as well. My husband is a supervisor at a manufacturing plant near the new Tesla site. He works with the kind of people that bounce around between Amazon, Trex, Walmart distribution, etc. these are the types of locals that will be available for lower end assembly line jobs at the new plant and while there are some honest hard workers in the bunch most aren't worth the ink to print their HR paperwork."
Reno,2fi3dx,TheMapesHotel,0,Fri Sep 5 18:46:01 2014 UTC,"That's all incredibly interesting. My economics knowledge is limited at best so thanks for the breakdown.   So Nevada gets a few jobs and some economic stimulus, and Tesla gets to operate essentially tax-free for 20 years. I think Tesla is getting the better deal here."
Reno,2fi3dx,elreydelasur,2,Fri Sep 5 18:52:57 2014 UTC,"For all intents and purposes this will also be a good thing for the state, it will create more jobs in services and hospitality (where many people in the urban centers work) to support the new influx of people. It should also raise our profile a bit and hopefully create a new industry. We do have the potential for an amazing green energy industry but not the push from the gov or the educated work force to make it happen (only 35% of Nevadans hold any kind of a higher ed degree). There will be a lot of fringe benefits, hopefully we can now offer something to young graduating professionals that will make them want to stay here.   And I believe just because Tesla gets to operate tax free does not mean every other company that will now either move here or do more business here to support the gigafactory will. It would be similar to granting Walmart Distribution tax free status but then making that back from the other companies that flooded USA Parkway to be closer to the distribution center."

Northern Nevada post-Tesla is one more consideration for looking at this community going forward for future phases of GigaPower.

Reno,2fdtmu,Mtebault,2,Thu Sep 4 16:44:01 2014 UTC,"Don't get me wrong but I seen this before. The state give tax breaks to any company willing to open shop here. In fact, I used to work for just one of those companies. It was wonderful to have a job where I could actually say I was happy with my pay. If you notice I am using past tense. The thing no one is listening to is the fact that the tax breaks are only for 5, 10 or 20 years. When it comes to years company's don't care. Who knows what will come in say 10 or 20 years. By that time it might be time to move. Companies have no loyalty to states. If they see a better opportunity they have no qualms on closing factories and moving. The company I worked for did just that. Tax breaks ended and they were GONE! The one thing that our state needs to write into the contracts with these companies is they needs to stay at least a couple years after the tax breaks end or all the breaks they were afforded before were null and void. Give them the incentive to keep them here. It is not a lot to ask these companies to be on probation for an extra five years. If then the company still wants to leave at least they could or would inform the employees of the future plans of moving the company. When I was told I was loosing my job I had about one or two month before going on unemployment.   I am very excited for the factory. And yes I will be right there putting in my resume along side 6499 other hopeful underemployed people who are dying to get a great paying job again. I just want to keep it for the rest of my life. When you are lucky enough to find a great job you hold on to it for the rest of you life. ಠ_ಠ"

Getting Tesla means the direct economic impact of the factory--with its 6500 jobs paying an average of over $25/hour--as well its estimated $100 billion in revenue over the next 20 years.  In addition, there's an enormous amount of goodwill coming to the region because of the of the Gigafactory; many more jobs will be produced than just the 6500 for the factory, and places like UNR only stand to gain if they choose. It's a win for the state, and $1.2 billion in tax credits (not money given to them, credits) does not change that."

Reno,2fe7ly,THESALTEDPEANUT,2,Fri Sep 5 02:18:25 2014 UTC,"Nevada forgoes about $1.2b in tax revenue over 10 years - which it wouldn't have gotten anyways if Tesla didn't locate and invest there. That's key - that revenue didn't ever exist without Tesla investing in the state so that it owed property taxes, etc... And the tax credits are really a subsidy on specific investment.   In exchange, Nevada ultimately gets $10b in investment from Tesla, immediately gets $350m/year in new payroll to their economy (and another 16k incremental jobs from there), and ultimately get $2b back in the state coffers. And that is real money going to real people.   I'm not a ""Tesla fanboy"" I drive a big stupid gas guzzling F150. I'm glad we're not going to continue to stagnate and depend primarily on casino's and a couple large shipping warehouses. This will open up ""6,500"" jobs for that specific project and that is not including the other jobs that will open up to support that project and it's employees.   Lastly our new business outlook in northern Nevada is moving toward large tax breaks to companies who will help bring down our unemployment rate and pour money into the local economy. We're sacrificing taxes from companies to ensure more people here can WORK and pay taxes.  edit: fixed a couple words. Just food for thought."

Construction workers will carry their money right back home to cali on the weekends, and the 7.25% sales tax on beer and taco bell arent going to subsidize 1.2 billion dollars.  You are beyond slow.  They don't pay taxes because their not here, so its like no big deal to forego it in the future?  So, i should be able to be tax exempt on my next endeavor because I'm not currently paying taxes on it now.  What the fuck kind of sense does that make?

In fact, after many years competing, I finally managed to win the Nevada Appeal's Nevada Day Treasure Hunt in 2013. Proof: http://www.nevadaappeal.com/news/local/8539640-113/hunt-miller-nevada-treasure  That being said, I've never participated in this particular hunt. The sample clues listed are fairly easy to solve, and look like it would be a fun way to spend a saturday.  Now here's the catch. The organizer is asking for a $100 entry fee, for a team of up 5 people. He's also capped the number of teams at 100. 15% percent of the entry fee goes into the ""treasure chest"". While it does sound fun, I will admit I take slight offense at the fact that if 100 teams enter, the organizer walks away with $8500, and the winning team splits the remaining $1500. Again, that's only if every available team spot is entered and paid for. Seeing as how the facebook page is up to a whopping 5 ""likes"" so far, I'm guessing that they won't get anywhere near the 100 team cap, meaning the pot will be significantly smaller, unless the creator decides to step up his contribution percentage.  In short, I think this looks like it could be a lot of fun, but I have my doubts about the prize getting up to the advertised $1500. Teams can have up to 5 people, so does anyone else feel like chipping in $20 and spending a Saturday playing ""National Treasure"" with me? Kidnapping the President may or may not be involved, and I get to be Nic Cage!"

Reno,2f70rm,Norillim,1 point,Mon Sep 1 21:40:07 2014 UTC,"SPOILER ALERT. Do not read anymore if you want to solve this on your own. I think this all sounds pretty interesting and would be interested in trying.  So for the first 3 clues I've got San Rafael park. Then the rest of the clue with my keywords in it goes: Here are the ships of Columbus. The tallest mast of the first has squares of red and white.  I've never been to the park so I don't know if that last bit makes sense or whether I should be converting ""ships of Columbus"" into the actual names of the ships."
Reno,2f70rm,raven12456,2,Tue Sep 2 01:44:40 2014 UTC,"Interesting! I'm with you on most of it, but how did you get ships? I struggled with that question, but came out with a different answer. Although, I must admit that ships makes more sense, especially if we're talking about masts."
Reno,2f70rm,raven12456,2,Tue Sep 2 02:21:02 2014 UTC,"Yeah thats where it gets a bit sketchy for me as well. But I started with the plural of the New York company that watches rose and mocha. Googling rose and mocha new york lead me to the Bulova watch company. Which made sense for the ""watching"" part. But putting an S on that didn't make any sense. But, the rose and mocha line of watches by Bulova is called Caravelle. Caravelle can also be spelled Caravel, which is a 15th century ship. a plural of that would be Caravels or ships which makes sense with the next Keyword, Columbus."

Reno,2f4psa,dnadude,5,Mon Sep 1 04:05:13 2014 UTC,"They launch all three days of the event.  I'm not sure if they have one day in particular that will be bigger than the others, it doesn't state anything like that on the event website.  Be there early, the Dawn Patrol and Glow Show all take place before sunrise.  If you want to stay in one spot, be there by 4am to stake out a place.  If you want to walk around you can come a little later.  Plan for the weather, it can be cold in the early morning and then warm up quickly.  Generally the main portion is over by 8am."
Reno,2f4psa,thehalfwit,3,Mon Sep 1 05:58:55 2014 UTC,"For me, Saturday always seems the best, depending on the weather. There have been many times over the years when launches didn't happen because of high winds or storms. But I don't see anything on the horizon, so you should be good.  Try to get there around 5-5:30, so you can get your bearings and meet-up with people you know. It will be dark as hell and crowded, so mentally prepare accordingly. In fact, to me, that's one of the craziest neat things about the balloon races -- all these people going out at 5 a.m. to see the spectacle.  One year, about eight years back, I got to go up in a balloon on last minute's notice. They usually have a ""hare and hound"" competition where the designated ""hare"" drops a marker and the other balloonists try to hit it with a bean bag. On this particular flight, the balloonist forget to bring his bean bag, so he said, ""Screw it! Let's go up.""  And up we went. About 3500 feet above base -- we were over everybody and everything, with Reno and Tahoe and the Sierra all spread out in front of us, during the most majestic sunrise possible. You know, life doesn't give you a lot of experiences like that, and I'm happy to say I've had more than a few.  Just get there early and have fun!"

The desserts themselves suck, but the ice cream's acceptable.  Anything prepared, like the pizzas or pastas or tacos or coleslaws, etc.. are totally ""middle America"".

The majority of what they bought will be donated to Habitat for Humanity at the end of the week.  It still surprises me that people are willing to save up for the year (thousands of dollars) to throw it away on a week in the desert. I'm not big on burning man but the culture fascinates me."
Reno,2ead7l,Beerbrewing,3,Sun Aug 24 02:58:20 2014 UTC,"I agree.  I really liked burning man in the 90s, but now I just can't fucking stand the typical ""burner"". Too much business, too many kick starters and far too many cops to even begin to enjoy myself."
Reno,2ead7l,IronSloth,2,Sat Aug 23 08:12:56 2014 UTC,"Wow it never even occurred to me but yeah, I bet there are kickstarters. Some people drop serious money into their projects though...  What I learned from Burning Man is that all roads eventually lead to civilization. There are reasons we have zoning laws, plumbing, running water, emergency services, infrastructure, money, clean water, etc, etc. Each thing solves a problem, and the solution is better than the problem although not perfect.   It's nice to strip it all away once per year and be reminded of why things exist. I totally appreciate and adore pavement and the city sewage and water systems, for example."
Reno,2ead7l,masterious,7,Sun Aug 24 00:04:46 2014 UTC,"Obnoxious, self-absorbed, snotty, entitled, fucking, assholes.  I tried to get a burger on my way home from work tonight. But couldn't, because they were having a party in the parking lot next to their ladybug van. Had them crawling on their own cars in the drive-through line like animals.  Last year, I tried to go grocery shopping, and the line was held up by a group of them making a fuss about the ""man"" and ""the corporations"" and shit like that.... Because the cashier at Wal-Mart wouldn't take the girl's beads for a piece of fabric. Just use your dads credit card like usual, you stupid little cunt. And act like a civilized human being until you're far away in the desert with the rest of your fellow shitstains on humanity.  /Rant  I feel better now."

I did it when I was a freshman, and they messed up my arm because the person who inserted the needle put it through my vein, rather than inside of it, so when they pumped the blood back through it all went directly into my bicep, causing it to swell up about 2 inches around, and i couldn't move it for about a week and it bruised pretty badly, turning into a variety of blacks, purples, and greens. They had to call an ambulance and took me to the hospital. In the end, I just had to sit around and wait for the blood to reabsorb back into my body.   They never even paid me. I never went back.  EDIT: Oh and they were playing fucking Gigli the whole time."

Reno,2e759z,sevenover1,4,Fri Aug 22 00:32:54 2014 UTC,10- 15 years ago when i was a broke college kid.  At that time it was $55 a week with two donations.  The First time they make you go through a physical.
Reno,2e759z,miagia,2,Thu Aug 21 18:19:41 2014 UTC,Like full on physical or just check blood pressure and minimal things?
Reno,2e759z,DragonDai,3,Thu Aug 21 18:30:40 2014 UTC,"Just a simple physical - height, weight, 20 questions, etc. Whatever you do, do not drink any alcohol within 72 hours - they are super sensitive about alcohol in the plasma. This includes cold remedies. Same with drugs. Any positive result will get you banned from donating."
Reno,2e759z,mako_e,2,Thu Aug 21 18:45:48 2014 UTC,Cool thanks for the info.
Reno,2e759z,lymbycsystym,3,Thu Aug 21 18:56:14 2014 UTC,"My wife donated twice weekly (the max). You get 25 for the first weekly donation and 35 for the second one (aka, you get more the second time in a week you donate). Their ""weeks"" start on Monday.  The first time you go in, ever, expect an extremely long wait. Several hours +. There are a BUNCH of tests and forms to fill out, etc. It's gana take a while. Every time after that, she gets in and out in 1-3 hours. The procedure takes about an hour-ish to actually do, so a little more than an hour is the quickest it could ever be. But yeah, after the first time, it's not too bad of a wait.  Eat a balanced, hearty meal shortly before, but stay away from fatty foods. And drink a TON of water (it helps them find your veins, making the whole process quicker and less painless). And the first time you go, because of the wait, bring a large nutritious snack with you (small sandwich or something).   My wife has gone quite a few times now and only had one negative experience, which wasn't that bad. And she keeps going back every week for a little extra spending cash. She says it's almost always a nice, friendly experience.   Hopefully that helps!"
Reno,2e759z,entfromhoth,2,Fri Aug 22 06:26:48 2014 UTC,"i did it for a while. theres an initial physical, real basic. proof of address an id and an ss card i think. only blood work is to test your protein. They also make you pee in a cup but but theres no drug test, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to. after that you can donate twice every seven days. i never had a bad experience minus a barely noticeable scar where they pricked me. its faded alot since, which is nice. otherwise id reccomend making an appointment even though it barely makes a difference and drink alot of water. also, no fatty food before you donate, youd be amazed by how much of the fat ends up in the blood and the fat can actually clog the machines. they have policy regarding that in which theyd be happy to explain"
Reno,2e759z,shakaroller,2,Fri Aug 22 03:17:49 2014 UTC,"I donate occasionally. From the statement on my card thing, I get $35 a donation. First time takes about fucking forever, but I got $110 for being a first time donor, and after that it's an hour or two each time. Not exactly quick, but it's alright. Usually have a shitty movie playing in the background. Doesn't hurt that bad. Somewhat competent staff. Annoying process of getting your weight, iron, protein, bp, etc every time. Not that bad, and usually pays for entertainment during the week."
Reno,2e759z,Stormbud,2,Fri Aug 22 07:43:36 2014 UTC,"There is a lot of confusing info in this post. I donate pretty frequently, here's the scoop. First time you donate go on a Tuesday-Thursday 11-3 cuz it's gonna be slow and it will take 2-4 hours with all the paper work and physical you need. First donation is 40, second is 60, then from there on out you can donate twice every 7 days, first donation is 25$ and 2nd is 35$ for a total of 60$ a week. Still takes 2-3 hours most of the time, so go when you're not really all that busy or on a time crunch. I've never had a bad experience other than sitting around with a bunch of questionably shady people for a little bit, but the place is clean and they play decent movies nowadays.   Don't drink the night before (they randomly test for elevated liver enzymes, I was caught and told this lol drink lots of water and yea, easy"
Reno,2e759z,sabineastroph,2,Fri Aug 22 09:25:09 2014 UTC,"payment wise the first payment comes on a prepaid credit card and comes with $40. then on you're second donation they give you $60 because they need 2 donations from an individual to make a full batch of plasma. then it goes back down to $40, then to $30, then $20 every time you visit. hope this helps"

However, the Reno Municipal Code might. Sec. 8.12.020 (specifically section d):  Disturbing the peace.  It is unlawful for any person to commit a breach of the peace. Such breach shall consist of: a. Fighting or challenging to fight; or b. Conduct or words calculated to provoke violence or a violation of the law by the person to whom the conduct or words are addressed; or c. Making annoying, lewd, malicious or threatening telephone calls; or d. Willfully and unreasonably subjecting a person or neighborhood to any noise which is likely to disturb the peace of persons of reasonable and ordinary sensibilities.  The issue here is the wall rattling bass needs to be considered unreasonable by any reasonable person. If you think that it is, section d applies. If not, they aren't committing any crime.   Also, you pretty much need to try talking to them. If the police show up and say, ""Hey, you need to turn that down or we're taking you in."" and they turn it down without hesitation.... there was no reason for having the police involved. If you ask them and they tell you to fuck off, you are back here OR they might just be considerate."

Keep calling the police and harass management to fix it assuming it does not get resolved.   More police reports will devalue the apartment complex as well as promote bad reviews online from people you ask to help you.

(Dealt with this myself when I was a nanny in the north valleys and a neighbor decided to do band practice with amps and an open garage at 9pm, even that late at night wasn't considered disturbing the peace).    I think your best avenue is to start filing regular complaints with the apt complex, but truthfully since this is daylight hours, it won't matter that you are trying to sleep.  You may need to get some earplugs and cope until you or the neighbors relocate.  (sorry, I know it sucks. I worked graves for 3 yrs so I am familiar with the struggle)"

Reno,2dywo0,cambria05,3,Tue Aug 19 14:54:23 2014 UTC,"Truth.  First address the matter with the landlord.  If the landlord doesn't care (and that's not usual), suggest you're thinking of complaining to the police (which a landlord usually DOES care about).    It's a shame they have you afraid.  It's possible that no one has ever asked them to reduce the volume and they might be willing.  Plus, it actually helps your property situation if they know you and you know them.  Even tweakers aren't likely to steal from people who know where to look when the police are called."

Reno,2dywo0,cambria05,2,Tue Aug 19 21:22:19 2014 UTC,CPS won't do anything even if the drug use is confirmed.  There has to be some actual threat to the child.  Parents can use meth and keep their kids as long as there's not an active threat to the welfare of the children.

The real question is whether or not it's worth it to move from Santa Cruz, which is nice, to Reno just for reduced rent and/or more space.    You must understand that the Reno/Tahoe/Carson City area is very much in the desert, figuratively, and by that I mean there isn't a lot here and there isn't much else around for quite a ways.  If what you want isn't here, you're not going to get it; San Francisco is four hours away instead of just one.  This place is great for families or couples, people who like outdoor activities, sunshine and dry weather, but if you're single, want an active social life, booming job market, night life, art scene or any other specialized scene, it's not so hot.    It's also just a seedy town in many ways, it's getting better and some areas are getting hip and gentrifying, but still closely tied to it's dirtbag roots.  But, still, it's not bad."
Reno,2dh20j,bangsecks,8,Thu Aug 14 05:44:31 2014 UTC,"but if you're single, want an active social life, booming job market, night life, art scene or any other specialized scene, it's not so hot   Do you get out at all?   For a town of its size, Reno has an incredibly diverse and energized arts scene, from music to theatre to comedy to, well, art, as in the ""Nevada Museum of"". It's certainly not San Francisco, but it's not Elko either.  There are live performances every single night of the year, and I'm not talking about the casinos. Pick up a News & Review and check out the weekly calendar. I've said it before, and I'll say it again, if you can't find activities in Reno that don't revolve around gambling and drinking, you aren't looking hard enough."
Reno,2dh20j,thehalfwit,4,Thu Aug 14 06:36:31 2014 UTC,"Most cities the size of Reno have comparable art and culture scenes, a lot of little things going on.  Of course it's no Elko, Elko is a tenth the size of Reno.  I tend to go for quality over quantity and Reno doesn't have much quality, in my opinion.  The art museum is laughable.  But, it's not terrible, it is okay.  Art Town is interesting often, I saw Richie Havens there once, which was remarkable, Tahoe is near and large acts come through SLT all the time, plus we have Burning Man stuff, but my point was exactly that it's not San Francisco.  Precisely because this person is talking about moving from Santa Cruz, SF being a quick trip away and Santa Cruz itself a lively place for arts and culture, that I say Reno isn't as good as the Bay Area."
Reno,2dh20j,bangsecks,7,Thu Aug 14 07:14:21 2014 UTC,"To each his/her own. I certainly don't feel marooned in a cultural wasteland, and I've lived in cities twice the size that didn't have as much as we've got going on.  Personally, I don't appreciate the fact that you dissed the museum. I don't know that much about art, but my kid sister does -- being a Guggenheim Fellow and all, having exhibits and being included in the permanent collections at the New York Met and MOMA. She thinks they've got a pretty good thing going on at the Nevada Museum. Of course, I think she's a little biased because she's friends with Dennis Oppenheim -- her and her husband actually met in his kitchen."
Reno,2dh20j,thehalfwit,2,Thu Aug 14 07:32:01 2014 UTC,"As long as we're swapping credentials, I've lived in cities that are approximately 26 times the size of Reno (6.5 million) and have traveled the world (I've been to about 20% of the worlds countries, lived long term in some of them), been to and lived in large cities and small cities and many in between and so I feel like my assessment of Reno as a mediocre to lower-end venue in terms of art and culture isn't too far off the mark.  Just because there are shows doesn't mean anything, they have to be shows of some repute, something good, and of course what's good is subjective, but at least you can gauge value in terms of name recognition; I almost never have heard of most bands and other exhibits that come to Reno.  It's not that often that there's someone I've heard of coming to Reno, any famous acts mostly go to SLT.  And as for the museum, it's so small, full of empty rooms.  I've only been a handful of times, stopped trying because it was so pitiful, but maybe those just happened to be off times, I don't know.  Their big events are that they get one unknown, untitled painting from a semi-famous to famous artist and it's billed as a huge event.  I wish it were better, those walls should be packed with local work if nothing else, but they're bare often.  I don't mean to dismiss your sister's work or involvement with the museum of whatever, but from what I've seen it actually falls below the mark for a city of this size.  The one area where Reno is pretty good on art is independent, rouge individuals doing art themselves in public spaces, part of that being of course often connected to Burning Man, but I will say that there are some local artists that are good and at times one comes across their stuff and the city of Reno is pretty good at getting some of them to put their work up around town, but, again, all of this is my opinion and per the original matter at hand a comparison to the Bay Area, and so you shouldn't take any of it too much to heart.    In fact, if you really want to counter what I'm saying why not post a laundry list of things you think are worth while here in Reno for OP?"
Reno,2dh20j,bangsecks,5,Thu Aug 14 07:59:54 2014 UTC,"I'm almost getting the impression that you don't like it here. Maybe you should be somewhere else?  But since you asked, here's a few off the top of my head:  Have you checked into the local comedy scene here at all? On any random Wednesday night at 9:30ish or so, you should drop in at 3rd Street downtown and check out the up-and-coming talent, or possibly a mid-level national name that's passing through, and who knows this is a room they have to do. Or you could check out Waterfall or Red Rock on Sundays, or maybe Wildflower Village on Tuesday, or Great Basin on Thursday, or the showcases at the The Knitting Factory or Jub Jub's, or the Pioneer Underground, or if that's not classy enough for you, Catch a Rising Star or the big features that come through the Legacy, Events Center or Pioneer Center.  Speaking of the Pioneer Center, I hear they have lots of Broadway and off-Broadway shows that come through regularly. The Nevada Opera seems to be able to pull it's weight, as does the Reno Philharmonic. Have you ever been to the ballet? It's not for everyone, but I hear the Nevada Ballet keeps people on their toes. Ha! I made a funny!  Somebody's going to have to help me out on the music scene to satisfy Mr. Sourpuss ""good guy"" /u/bangsecks. Also, on theatre, I know there's Bruka and the Utility Players, but I know there's more.  Edit: Reno Philharmonic"

Reno,2dh20j,bangsecks,3,Thu Aug 14 08:53:38 2014 UTC,"At 3rd Street, it's usually every Wednesday and showcases on the 3rd Friday of the month, although I think that's going to be upped to two monthly showcases very soon, like maybe this week.  The other rooms -- on Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday (come this fall) -- feature a lot of the same comics. Shows at The Knit are a bit more sporadic, and I forgot to mention Cargo is putting together something (and Ceol is also rumored to be doing the same). Pioneer Underground is good most Fridays and Saturday.  There are dozens and dozens of comics that go up regularly in this town, and live comedy seems to be catching fire right at this particular time nationwide. The comics couldn't be happier. We live for stage time, and it seems to be opening up all the time. And some of these people are very, very good. In fact, I've lost track of how many have moved to more ""production friendly"" cities such as LA, SF, Portland, Boston and NYC."

That said, if you drink, there's themed beer crawls, which isn't really fun if you don't know anyone, but hey, there's a rib cook off. I'm leaving Reno in November. I just can't.

I don't drink, I don't game, I do like the Arts and the Outdoors.  The key to enjoying this area for me was to seek like minded people and to actively seek activities (so many free or cheap events) and explore.  It helped when I lived in Midtown while it was just starting it's growth.  I go to Tahoe at least once a week in both winter and summer for boarding, hiking, swimming, etc.  Driving (and parking) here is so much less stressful than California.

(Clearly it shows in Reno because you think drinking alcohol in costumes and running 5ks is fucking the best ""culture"" in the world) Florida has American culture (much like the noted bike weeks you spoke of which just about every state has one same as they have car shows) but it also has more appeal to art and history. Hell, even if conventions and science and nature is your thing, it's everywhere.  Defend your ""biggest shitty little city"" ask you like.

The only place in Florida I've visited is Orlando and I can't speak much of the place but my friend who lived there said it's actually culturally pretty similar to Reno. lol.  But from what I've heard Florida is very diverse and different from North to South.  One of my ""nerdier"" friends struggles to find friends, but has resourced to use the internet to find like minded people and creates interesting groups on Meetup.com all the time.  She's met quite a wide variety of people through that site and is constantly busy with events from that site now.

Reno,2deo3b,themosthatedone,1 point,Wed Aug 13 05:41:12 2014 UTC,"The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is determining whether or not to list the Greater Sage Grouse as an endangered or threatened species.  This has been a long time coming, but the the FWS is determining this at the end of Sept. 2015.  If the bird is listed as either endangered (more restrictive) or threatened (less restrictive) the FWS has regulatory power to limit any development on Federal, State, and private lands.  If you're from Nevada and are familiar with the regulations that protect the Desert Tortoise, it's the same thing.  Development includes anything that would jeopardize Sage Grouse habitat.  Nevada's U.S. Senators, Reid and Heller, have introduced what they've called a 'Discussion Draft'.  Basically what it says is federal agencies are required to work with industry to both protect habitat in areas that need to be protected, while still allowing for development.  Here's why this draft is controversial.  The bill provides 'regulatory certainty', which means that certain lands will be designated as Wilderness.  Those lands, however, are classified as Wilderness Study Areas (WSA) and already have the regulatory measures in place.  WSA's are designated by Congress to be studied on whether or not the land is suitable for Wilderness.  Wilderness has strict regulation, but still allows for hunting on foot or horseback and any ranching that already has grazing permits will still be allowed.    Long story short:  If the bird is listed, there will be strict regulation that will impact mining, which is the largest industry in Nevada outside of tourism, and ultimately will hurt Nevada's economy, especially northern Nevada."
