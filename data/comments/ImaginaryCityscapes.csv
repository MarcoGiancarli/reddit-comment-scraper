ImaginaryCityscapes,3dy5pv,ethan_kahn,6,Mon Jul 20 14:23:07 2015 UTC,When did he paint/draw this?
ImaginaryCityscapes,3dy5pv,LoveWaffle,10,Mon Jul 20 14:45:26 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it was for the original movie. I think Utapau was the original concept for Tatooine

I don't have a link though, but its cool to see how his artistic vision is still influencing the series well after his death."

ImaginaryCityscapes,3dy5pv,redditsuckmyballs,3,Mon Jul 20 19:05:06 2015 UTC,That explains all the moisture farms.

ImaginaryCityscapes,3dy5pv,herbadah,-7,Mon Jul 20 22:04:04 2015 UTC,"In know this is ImaginaryLandscapes, but you're turning it into MakeExcusesforCrazyCities now. I'll concede, for the sake of artistic license, but this city design would only work in a world without flash floods. Let's pretend a water reclamation facility would be able to process and filter a flash flood without being overtaken by the mud and debris."
ImaginaryCityscapes,3dy5pv,redditsuckmyballs,2,Mon Jul 20 22:12:15 2015 UTC,"That might be a good thing. Preserve the water, and you have a shadowed, cool, humid environment instead of a constantly sunbeaten, hot, and dry one. Also, the water could absorb heat for the night, making the environment even more hospitable in the canyons."
ImaginaryCityscapes,3dy5pv,GRadde,2,Mon Jul 20 20:17:45 2015 UTC,"Usually those canyons are carved by water/silt/debris all the way to the top. So unless the canyon that city is built upon was not naturally carved by water (which would still make it subject to monsoon floodings), then the water would flood the construction on its walls all the way to the top in some occasions. Kind of an inconvenience to wake up under water."

If the need was big enough, it could work for us here on Earth with the technology we have today, it would most likely work well for an alien species on another planet, with interstellar travel-level technology."
ImaginaryCityscapes,3dy5pv,GRadde,2,Tue Jul 21 09:34:57 2015 UTC,You should look up the cliff dwellings at Mesa Verde in Colorado. The people lived in villages on the underside of caves and did quite well for themselves for several hundred years.

ImaginaryCityscapes,3bib54,berhamporian,4,Mon Jun 29 20:04:00 2015 UTC,"I usually go for the photorealistic stuff, but even though this is just basic shapes, it achieves an uncanny realism that isn't real at all.  I can only assume it's due to humanity's excellent pattern-recognition skills:  We expect to see a city in all those circles and squares, so our brain shows us a city.  The more I look at it the more pronounced the separation is between the reality of an actual city and the abstract flow of the shapes, so it just keeps getting more awesome.  So damn trippy.  Now I wanna see it move."

Some people have mixed feelings about the CGI but I really like it...and the battle scenes are well choreographed. It kind of has a Battlestar Galactica feel with the grittiness of space war and life on the colony ship. It's not perfect--there are some inexplicable plot twists and sequences--but if you can manage to get through those, the rest of the show is exciting and emotionally gripping."

ImaginaryCityscapes,3atsvp,ethan_kahn,14,Tue Jun 23 13:25:34 2015 UTC,That bridge makes zero sense.
ImaginaryCityscapes,3atsvp,skepticscorner,12,Tue Jun 23 14:51:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah that structure (aqueduct? bridge?) is not quite right. In fact, while the arrangement of everything (except the big stone thing) is very pleasant there are quite a few elements of this cityscape that throw me out of it.  The trees are enormous, many many times the height of the strangely flat structures. The outermost city is not connected at all to the inner city or castle. The bricks on the stone structure are massive- many times larger than the smaller houses. The windows of the castle are also a good deal taller than many of the non-castle structures.   Also...is that a modern day city off to the right on the middle layer?  While at a glance this is a neat little concept, the execution is a bit stylistically frustrating and it takes me out of the scene. Obviously this doesn't apply to everyone, but I love looking at these imaginary cityscapes and imagining how they would function and what it would look like to walk around among them and this particular city just has so many weird things going on.   At the same time I want to add that this is all imaginary fantasy and the artist can make up whatever possible qualifiers they want to explain away all of the points that I brought up and that is totally okay because they're the ones that sat down and put this together."
ImaginaryCityscapes,3atsvp,harumphhh,7,Tue Jun 23 15:55:44 2015 UTC,ya and there's not even a reflection of the bridge or the caste in the water right below it…that's like art 101.

Visit a mega farm in California, a body of water near an industrial plant, or simply walk around Manhattan and let the rapidly evolving island for the rich, jet-setting class seep into your consciousness.  If that doesn't do the trick, San Francisco-based artist Michael Kerbow is here to take you on a tour of today's dystopian milieu, and then extrapolate it all into a techno-induced future.  Take Kerbow's Portents series. It's a dark and mesmerizing window into humanity's near and distant futures. On a thematic level, it deals variously with climate change, pollution, over-population, and humanity's Icarus and Tower of Babel-like drive to create new technologies; all toward perhaps some undefined and maybe even non-existent dream.   It's the sort of work that science fiction fans dig, that would keep Al Gore up at night (for good reason), and forces skeptics into paroxysms of climate change denial.  more and source here: http://michaelkerbow.com/blog"

About this image, the artist says, ""What if the British Empire didn't collapse after WW2 but spread to the whole world and beyond..?""  I like it because it conjures up feelings of ominous danger. At least to me. But then you see that couple in the far-left of the image, just sitting there, casually taking in the whole scene with no hint of alarm or care, suddenly the whole pic takes a different turn. It's analogous to how technology can, with familiarity, lead to a kind of shrugging acceptance rather than trepidation.  I'm working on new header art for this subreddit.

ImaginaryCityscapes,3013z6,thomar,4,Mon Mar 23 17:11:44 2015 UTC,"""And there she is. Outpost Thera."" Yorke flipped the cover open in the landing and docking section of his console. About 30 switched sat underneath. Most backups and redundant systems for other buttons. He began the sequence to dock the Marathon class shuttle into the large supply bay on the spire.  Andy looked out of the window. His eye as wide as moons and his mouth slowly getting bigger. At one point he tried to speak but pure awe held a firm grip on his ability.  ""This, this isn't an outpost its a whole city! We only brought supplies for the crew in the tower. What about all these people. I mean look at this place."" He unclipped his harness and darted from one side of the ship to the other. The 4 man vessel could handle the jostling but he could not. He was only used to trips aboard larger ships. Ones so large that it felt no different than solid ground expect for emergency situations. He quickly caught and steadied himself before going head over heels.   Yorke chuckled. ""I never get tired of you new kids from the Inner freaking out when you see this place. Its OK. We have a job to do and if we do it right most of those people down there will be fine.  ""Wait, most, what do you mean?""  ""Strap in and ill explain, but I need you strapped and cool so I don't lose you. Its a bumpy connection no matter how sweet I kiss the docking clamps. So hold on.""  A hiss of super cooled gas quickly fills the cabin with its noise. Yorke presses, clicks and turns away at the console. Adjusting and adapting to the situation. They begin to be pulled in and hie relaxes just a bit.  ""This rock is one of the first planetoids we made. Out here at the edge of our galaxy where we needed it. You're right Kid, there are tons of people down there. Thing is, there's nothing we can do about it now. Almost nothing. What we can do is make sure they came here for a good reason. This is Outpost Thera, one of the four that lead to the Great Void. Once over that Void life is wonderful. You're from the Inner Ring Worlds, so you know more than most. This Galaxy is dying. Hell, its dead in many parts already. So we need to make that leap to the next closest if we want to keep going.  We built these four outposts as a series of way stations to get us there. Thera, Chi, Eres, and Tauron. Each one lets us send supplies and cargo and anything we need to the next and eventually at Tauron, off to the next world on the other side of the Void."" The ship rocks as the docking is complete and the bay doors open with lights and alarms. Cleaning and repair mechs stroll forth and descend on the ship doing their programmed jobs.  ""But they cant make it all at once. Look at them. This city goes on for miles and miles. Only about 100 or so go on each trip with the Supplies each trip. They will never make it.""  Andy still looks out the window and sees the city stretch as to the horizon.  ""Kid, people know that only a small amount are being sent through. But mankind doesn't care. We don't listen to reason about most things and this is just one more. As soon as the word got out they started showing up. Many spent the last credit they had to get here. Most feel its the beginning of the end so why not go all in. Truth is, that we will save as many as we can once things are done at Tauron. ""  The young first timer begins to let it sink it. ""So they just kept piling up I see. I guess that explains the power plants and other buildings. They made what they needed to survive. ""  ""Exactly."" Yorke says ""They did what humans do, they made it work. So  some people look at this place and see us huddling in the cold and dark as the end comes. But I see it as a sign that no matter how crazy things get, man figures it out.  So buck up kid. You are looking at the last city Mankind will ever make in this galaxy.  And maker willing, people like you and me and lots of folks down there will be some of the first to step foot in the first one mankind makes on the other side."""

The tram is a 1920's tram (though steam powered in this image), and the Rue running up to the tower is actually either a bridge on the north side or a grassy boulevard running north from the south side.

No offense, but is getting upset at the most unremarkable shit your secret super power?   So what's the game developers' explanation for the project going up two years ahead of schedule.  Since the story seems to be mostly set in London, I have a feeling that this depiction of the Eiffel tower was more of an error than a conscious decision to make an intentional difference between out universe and theirs.   You might have been too busy getting traumatized by this ridiculous mismatch to come to this conclusion, but the name of the game is probably more important to the developers than the ""historic"" accuracy of a landscape of a town that the game is not set in. On the concept art out of all things.  I mean, im sure that you get a kick out of dropping knowledge bombs about the Eiffel Tower timeline, but people that worked on this game/concept art most definitely have access to google too."

ImaginaryCityscapes,2z7xni,Odds-Bodkins,1 point,Thu Mar 19 13:50:03 2015 UTC,"Section 6. Childhood of article  Hanuman:       As a child, believing the sun to be a ripe mango, Hanuman pursued it in order to eat it. Rahu, a Vedic planet corresponding to an eclipse, was at that time seeking out the sun as well, and he clashed with Hanuman. Hanuman thrashed Rahu and went to take sun in his mouth.  Rahu approached Indra, king of devas, and complained that a monkey child stopped him from taking on Sun, preventing the scheduled eclipse. This enraged Indra, who responded by throwing the Vajra (thunderbolt) at Hanuman, which struck his jaw. He fell back down to the earth and became unconscious. A permanent mark was left on his chin (हनुः hanuḥ ""jaw"" in Sanskrit), due to impact of Vajra, explaining his name.   Upset over the attack, Hanuman's father figure Vayu deva (the deity of air) went into seclusion, withdrawing air along with him. As living beings began to asphyxiate, Indra withdrew the effect of his thunderbolt. The devas then revived Hanuman and blessed him with multiple boons to appease Vayu.

I wish I could just 'not' do that pal.""  ""No, I mean the coffee, there are way better ways to wake up. You're in the middle of Hong Kong and you spend time every day getting smelly coffee when there is incredible, good for your tea up here waiting. Clears the mind and heals the body son of Jack. That black stuff just gets you all jittery and wild eyed."" Joeng waved his thumb over the panel and let the machine scan it. In less than a blink of an eye billions of records were accessed and choices made. Data logged and the all clear signal was sent all over. The door below let its single light cycle from unblinking red to an inviting green. Chinese hanzi below greeted the Detective as he walked into the elevator to be scanned and cleared before coming up.  Jackson sipped his coffee before stepping on.  ""I like the hunt. Some days its the only case I get to solve. The case of Java, the Coffee Demon."" He wore his cleaner jeans today. A shirt older than the building he walked into and with letters that could have been any number of punk or rock bands from the last 20 years. As soon as the elevator doors close he pulled off his jacket. The metal buckles and near its end leather could sometimes play with the scanners. The price he paid to look like a relic. He new the machine would give pause and he would have to sit a few minutes longer as it tried to reason out the drink he had in his cup. Coffee, American coffee was just never programmed into the database of items to be allowed into the precinct. And each morning he came in with one it  had to access an exception list and OK him again. He was beginning to think somebody in the office just had it in for him and wanted to chuckle at him each day.  Joeng was deep into his second log file by the time he made it through the several levels of security check points and scans. They both knew you could never be too careful but it still bothered them just the same.   ""Anything good?"" Jackson said in place of a good morning or hello.  ""Nothing special. Hookers are wearing rooster feathers in their hair again. I guess that's new. Oh, and your favorite body mod is back on the hot list.""  ""Great, more tongue splitting."" Jackson took another sip and logged in.  ""Joeng, you see this?"" ""What?"" He pushed back from his console, unplugged and spun around. Jackson opted to never use a deck and still pulled up work on an older 3D holo machine. So Joeng had to undeck to actually see his screen. His feed was from a sector drone doing routine facial scans in the Red District.  ""Congrats, you found the last non-cyber enhanced hooker in Hong-Kong. We got all day to look at hookers Jackson.""  He hit a few strokes and pulled up still images. Jackson half grunted. ""No, look at her face. I've seen it before. ""  ""I swear if you tell me she's been in your dreams all night I'm dumping that coffee and requesting a new partner."" Joeng begins as he starts pulling his rig back onto his head.  ""I'm serious here, and something is wrong, I've seen that face before but not here.  I think it was back home in Chicago.""  ""So what, hookers look the same across the water as they do here."" ""But not exactly the same, that's nuts."" Another quick sip started and ended his sentence.  ""Nuts maybe, but not illegal. Calm down."" ""Joeng, I know. Yeah people can look like someone else, but a straight up clone? Who does that for hookers? That costs too much money.""  With his rig back on his head, Joeng paused momentarily before re-jacking in. ""Hey, its a business. People, companies clone and copy merchandise all the time. This is no different. Yeah its tacky but that's allowed too.""  Jackson begins making a call with his old hand unit. ""Im telling you that's her exactly and that aint right. If we got a Copy Shop in town then we are in big shit. I'm calling a buddy in Chi town and seeing if he can help me.""  ""See, a nice cup of tea and this day would have been fine. Now you're really gonna play ""Guess Who"" with street walkers on two different continents. I told you coffee gets you all hyped up."""

An artist has painted this piece, where the character is also painting their re-imagining or beautiful version of the world before them...there's NOTHING in that photo to hint that there's chemtrails or big evil corporations in this characters re-imagining of the world, you came in and completely made up that the artist purposefully included chemtrails and corps in the painting.  What if I gave an example by saying something like ""OMG the artist is so evil with her subtle propaganda look at how this terrible person included big evil aliens from outer space that pretend to be plants by looking like them and are eating our buildings would they not be gone in a beautiful future?!""  Or ""omg look at the evil propaganda by the artist the sky is blue that's the evil devil lord satan shining his blue hate out of his butthole would the sky not be purple in a beautiful future?""  Do you understand?  It has NOTHING to do with what we see with our eyes or heart, it's the fact that you came in here and completely made up that there's things in the photo and that the artist purposefully included these as subtle propaganda when they literally do not exist in the picture.  Please try to understand this basic logic and re-evaluate the way you think before you turn completely into one of those crazy old people who scream that every little tiny thing is a sign of evil or chemtrails or whatever through made up facts and thoughts."

ImaginaryCityscapes,2x93mu,Thedr001,3,Fri Feb 27 03:57:48 2015 UTC,I read something somewhere about most of existing San Francisco being destroyed and being rebuilt by a large immigrant Japanese population. Or something. I wish I remember where I saw the comment.

It's my favorite city in the game - but it's just so small.  We get a market on the left, a huge in in the center, a few wealthy houses in the upper left and right side and on the far right side a big circle with just a few houses and a shop or two.  Actually that sounds pretty big now that I mention it, but it needs to be bigger.  Maybe some modders should take us all the way around the castle and double the size.  I mean, the graveyard alone, which looks so amazingly cool, is basically just a courtyard in an alley."

At first, it all looks pretty, but then I see that the castle has nearly no windows, only impossibly tall expanses of unbroken wall. Houses are piled onto hills haphazardly, painted but never decorated. And all throughout the city, not a single soul can be seen.  If I were at the gates of this city, I would approach it the same way I would Lordran; with hesitant steps, hiding behind a heavy slab of iron."

ImaginaryCityscapes,2ve8lh,Hydrostatic_Shock,2,Tue Feb 10 07:36:51 2015 UTC,Why let such a tedious detail ruin the awesome feeling this picture gives?
ImaginaryCityscapes,2ve8lh,JanosAudrun,3,Tue Feb 10 16:33:55 2015 UTC,"In a landscape, perspective isn't a tedious detail, and it really does ruin the awesome feeling this picture is supposed to give.   It's still a cool picture, but the scale looks way off because of the size of the plants, and even the airships to a lesser degree."
ImaginaryCityscapes,2ve8lh,Tallain,1 point,Tue Feb 10 17:48:41 2015 UTC,"Please, explain."
ImaginaryCityscapes,2ve8lh,ggWolf,3,Tue Feb 10 17:47:42 2015 UTC,"The culprit is this copse of trees outlined in red.  And the real problem here is the size of the shadows being cast. They're traveling all the way to the base of the mountain; judging by the size of the foliage and the size that the city is supposed to be, these shadows are just way too big.  In the above picture, the tree in the blue box appears to be very far from the rock outcropping up against the city wall. This tree's shadow is also too large, but it doesn't appear as off because the shadow also just kind of looks like discoloring in the ground. However, the trees in the red box (which appear to be equidistant from the camera) cast that huuuuge shadow, making them appear disproportionately big.  To make it look better I would leave the tree in the blue box alone, maybe adjust its shadow a little bit, then move the trees in the red box forward, even to the bottom edge of the red box, then also adjust the size of the shadows they cast, although only slightly. It would take some fine tuning. I would also shrink the taller trees in the red box; they're too tall imo and are also messing with the appearance of the scale.  Looking closely again, there's another tree hiding in the shadow of the mountain that's also too large for how far from the camera it is."
ImaginaryCityscapes,2ve8lh,Tallain,2,Tue Feb 10 19:18:56 2015 UTC,"That's actually... very thorough. Can't really argue with you about that.  True as it may be, and though I really like the picture, I find the lack of life disturbing. Not necessarily people walking around, but indirect signs. Those zeppelins is great ones, but without them it would have been a ghost town. So either the artist could have let the zep's go, or added more life."
ImaginaryCityscapes,2ve8lh,ggWolf,2,Tue Feb 10 19:34:52 2015 UTC,"Haha I put way too much thought into this picture.  I agree with you there, it would be pretty nice to see maybe a merchant caravan with camels and mercenaries traversing that road in the foreground."

ImaginaryCityscapes,2tq186,ethan_kahn,4,Mon Jan 26 14:37:53 2015 UTC,"some words from artist: This was made for CGSociety's ""Strange Behaviour"" Challenge. The story goes: In vertical oriental cities, gas-filled floating fish are commonly used for cargo transport. Being very docile creatures, they normally create no fuss. They glide slowly though the crowded markets, letting themselves be steered by their drivers to their docking stations deep within the city. But then once in a while a fish panics in the narrow passages and tries to get away, shaking off the little people climbing all over it and tearing down wooden bridges and market stands. Such behaviour is considered unacceptable and most strange. This painting depicts one such event.  source: http://minnhagen.deviantart.com/"

ImaginaryCityscapes,2rv5fv,DisinhibitionEffect,1 point,Fri Jan 9 17:17:27 2015 UTC,"Timber framing:       Timber framing and ""post-and-beam"" construction are methods of building with heavy timbers rather than dimensional lumber such as 2""x4""s. Traditional timber framing is the method of creating structures using heavy squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs (larger versions of the mortise and tenon joints in furniture). It is commonplace in wooden buildings from the 19th century and earlier. The method comes from making things out of logs and tree trunks without modern high tech saws to cut lumber from the starting material stock. Using axes, adzes, and draw knives, hand-powered auger drill bits (bit and brace), and laborious woodworking, artisans or farmers could gradually assemble a building capable of bearing heavy weight without excessive use of interior space given over to vertical support posts. Since this building method has been used for thousands of years in many parts of the world, there are many styles of historic framing. These styles are often categorized by the type of foundation, walls, how and where the beams intersect, the use of curved timbers, and the roof framing details. Three basic types of timber frames in English-speaking countries are the box frame, cruck frame, and aisled frame.

Kredik Shaw, the giant palace in the middle was designed so it would look imposing always, with its large black spires.   Scadrial, the planet Luthadel is on, is plagued with mists by night, obscuring everyones view, and by day they have to deal with the ashfalls from the Ashmounts (one is visibile distributing an ashfall in this picture). The only places that can actually afford to be kept clean are the Noble Keeps along the walls, and even then, the skaa only clean it to shining for the weekly balls.   If someone tried to do a high definition version of Luthadel it would be a lot of specs of ash!"

For a minute I thought you were just making all that up off the top of your head.  Pretty cool how the story behind it turned out to be pretty much as I was playing it in my head.  Much of it is expected, like the nobles living in a clean environment and the constant problem with ashfall, but it's still really close to what I was thinking even though I have no knowledge of the novels.

I'll go against the general consensus here and say that I really didn't like either of Mieville's books that I read, and that I'd be much more likely to give another one a chance if it hadn't taken so many damn pages (I am almost incapable of abandoning a book once I've started, if only out of bloody-minded principle) to find out."

ImaginaryCityscapes,2g5yca,travio,5,Fri Sep 12 04:19:40 2014 UTC,"I have always loved the idea of arcologies since I played the pen and paper Shadowrun in high school.  I have to think that they would have a rigid class system almost like a cruise ship with the distinction between the guests and higher up crew having large accommodations on the choicer areas while the rest of the crew has smaller accommodations in the bowels of the ship. This would be doubly so in an arcology like this that exists away from any other population source.   Looking at this one, you can see the huge difference between the size of the interior areas to the very small open park areas. The ratio will almost always be like this as a tall building will only have the roof and whatever balconies without overhangs can be added for possible park areas. The taller the building, the worse this gets. I live in a 4 story apartment building. The roof has the same square footage as one of the floors, so 1/4 of the total square footage of the interior can be used as a park. If it was 8 stories, this would be an 1/8th and so on. A building like this arcology might have hundreds of levels(I am not going to count) so the amount of open space is infinitesimal to the amount of interior area to house your citizens. Tons of people and little greenery would necessitate limiting these areas to only a certain amount of people unless you want them to look like chinese beaches.   This creates a Metropolis situation where the working class toils away in the bowels so the idle rich can be idle. Unless there is some sort of revolution or technocratic singularity there will be a working class turning the cranks that keep Bartertown running."
ImaginaryCityscapes,2g5yca,Treesclera,6,Fri Sep 12 07:23:12 2014 UTC,"Where I live, Edinburgh, there is a scheme in which people without gardens use those of people who have them but can't or don't want to maintain them. That is one of the more simple ways around these situations in real life, lots of suburbs with gardens and people too busy to tend them and high rise buildings with no been space but with occupants who want to garden. Something similar may work here. The rich enjoy the garden that the poor tend to?  Also of note is that public parks aren't built to accommodate enough room for every person living nearby, why? Because not everyone will use it at the same time, people have differing work and school schedules and the same would go for an arcology, or your 4 storey building. It may only be 1/4 of the floor space but as long as all four floors don't want to use it at the same time, that shouldn't matter.  Edit: sorry if that came across as argumentative, it wasn't meant to be."

The enlightened found that the properties of the universe could be predicted precisely. They were able to derive things like the acceleration of Earth's gravity (9.81 m/s2) or the orbital period of the Earth which is 365 days every single year.  Their only explanation was that the divine creator made the universe to act as clockwork. How else could the universe be calculated so precisely they wondered.

His tumbler archives: http://jeffturley.tumblr.com/archive  and the amazon link you gave made no mention of a Jeff Turley anywhere on the page. but did mention a Jeff Kurtti tho."

Jeff Kurti is the person who put the book together, Jeff Turley is a concept artist with Disney Animation Studios.  The credits of Tangled lists Jeff Turley, but no Jeff Kurtti  I've been looking around for other sources of crediting his name to the piece, though just like many concept art pieces by studios such as this its often done by nameless people. This one is a concept art blog listing some of his work."

It was published by Sega. It was released on February 22, 2002 in Japan, February 25, 2002 in North America and March 14, 2002 in Europe, near the beginning of the Xbox's lifespan. After the game's initial release, it was added alongside Sega GT 2002 onto a single disc and bundled with new Xbox systems.  Similar to the original, it depicts a future Tokyo where freedom of expression is outlawed. The user plays a character in the GG's, a gang of in-line skating graffiti artists who skate around Tokyo covering up rival gangs' graffiti, knocking over Rokkaku police, and dancing to the electric soundtrack. The game uses a cel-shaded style of animation, and has been widely acclaimed for its unique music style, detailed art, and gameplay.

The buildings also have windows instead of those awfully cliche monotone slabs that so many artists rely on.   Plus, the junk swimming in the shot looks great. It, along with some of the smaller buildings, really highlights how a city doesn't simply drop all semblance of its historic architecture as it continues into the future. Really nice image overall."

ImaginaryCityscapes,2blc9h,ethan_kahn,2,Thu Jul 24 18:42:58 2014 UTC,"I disagree. That wooden boat is a key part of why this is such a nice image. Today, we have boats made from many advanced materials yet at the same time you will still see wooden boats at a fairly frequent rate.   In Amsterdam, for instance, there are parts of the city with extremely wealthy residents. These are the sort of people who can purchase the latest and greatest in motorboat technology. Despite that purchasing power, many of these people own very old-school wooden boats. The point is, the existence of more modern technology doesn't have to result in the mass extinction of traditional designs.   Many sci-fi images focus almost exclusively on space ships, crazy skyscrapers and hovercraft while ignoring how our own current cities have evolved. Paris is, by most every metric, an advanced city yet the aesthetic is largely devoid of the sort of skyscrapers that you see in a city like Chicago. And even in Chicago, where you see modern buildings like the relatively new Trump Tower, you will also see much older skyscrapers that are largely from a different era."
ImaginaryCityscapes,2blc9h,blaggityblerg,1 point,Thu Jul 24 19:12:57 2014 UTC,I'm fine with materials and style of the boat. But it is the only primitive thing in the piece. Maybe the artist wanted this be a talking point. I just feel like the boat should be hovering. But art is all about personal aesthetics.
ImaginaryCityscapes,2blc9h,ethan_kahn,3,Thu Jul 24 19:37:53 2014 UTC,"The boats to the left look fairly contemporary, and the bridge behind the boat looks fairly dated. The skyscrapers in the area of the bridge are also right in line with the current prevalent style. In the image as a whole, there seems to be a nice blend of past, present, and future."

ImaginaryCityscapes,29siky,ChokeZero,1 point,Fri Jul 4 21:22:21 2014 UTC,"As someone who has played continuously for 7 years I can say yes.  The game has changed a lot, if you do feel like playing again it's still f2p, core mechanics are there but sone notable differences added are:  Customizable interface  Revamped combat system (if you don't like the new combat a update is coming later this month to add a combat style exactly like the old one, a version of it is on the beta to try out for f2p players)  Graphic overhauls for a majority of city's and armours in the game  Bots have been 99% obliterated from the game   Multiple new bosses and weapons and armour.  The crystal wall that holds the empty area in the elf lands will soon be filled with a full blown elf city.  Polls determine where efforts/ what certain updates are wanted in mass  Lots of new quests and a brand new skill  Here is a list of all the new updates on a timeline that you can check to see from when you left to now:  http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Update:Game_updates  However if you aren't a fan of the updates a old version of the game from 2007 was launched by jagex a year ago called Old School Runescape ( you have to start over from scratch but it's fairly fun as well, got 99 magic, fletching, and cooking in it over the course of a year).  It is members but there is a 2week free trial type system you can try that allows access to f2p from a new account. The old school game is headed by 3 senior J mods who made content and worked on the game during the time of 2007 and have an extra 4 j mods recruited to help with development.   Old school runs polls based of suggestions and feedback that determine what updates get added into the game. Lots of luxury and ease of life updates to old bug fixes to some full blown content that isn't even in the main game.   Both games are updated weekly ( old is bi-weekly ish) so if you wanna try out give it a go:  http://www.runescape.com/community  Old school here: http://oldschool.runescape.com"

ImaginaryCityscapes,29siky,ChokeZero,1 point,Fri Jul 4 22:25:03 2014 UTC,"You might see that a bit in old school since the bot detection isn't as optimized as rs3.

ImaginaryCityscapes,29conw,InfdevMinecrafter,2,Sat Jun 28 22:33:35 2014 UTC,"If this is the view you're going to use, compositionally it's okay but could be better. What's the focal point of the image? Traditionally a landscape picture (cityscapes are a subset) should have interesting elements in the foreground, middleground and background. Your image currently seems mostly middle.  You've also chosen a square frame. This can be tricky to add dynamism to the image (look through the other submissions and note how most are wider than they are tall).  The cluster of buildings is nice. I would suggest adding some horizontal elements like a riverside in front, and some main roads carving up the spaces between buildings. Also try to get some gaps showing between the big buildings, and maybe an open space like a park in the centre of the smaller ones."

ImaginaryCityscapes,264brr,frogdude2004,5,Wed May 21 20:18:46 2014 UTC,"Only until you consider the practicalities.  Would it be sanitary? If this place has normal gravity, with houses this old, that's highly unlikely. Everybody would have to be perfectly civilized and clean, with absolutely no littering. Also, the smoke from those chimneys would cause serious issues for the upwards neighbors. There could be a system of pipes running inside the cliff to carry the smoke and dejects upwards/downwards, but how would you diagnose issues and repair them without major inconvenience to all the neighbors?  Speaking of repairs, these buildings would need them all the time. They're all built haphazardly on top of each other, on the side of a vertical cliff! Either they use advanced materials (steel, reinforced concrete and the like), the cliff is artificial, or it can't all last very long. Especially as such canyons tend to channel wind currents, which compounds the erosion caused by the rainfall (if there is any).  It's a dangerous place for raising your kids. Sure, there are safety railings, but the danger of falling and hurting yourself is very real, especially if you don't know what you're doing.  If this planet is similar to Earth, with a tilted rotation axis, most of the houses in this city would get very little light during most of the year. Even if for a few weeks the position of the sun in the sky aligns with the canyon, the rest of the time the sun is only going to light the houses below during the time of the day when it's right above the canyon. During the winter it will also be closer to the horizon, which reduces the amount of light even further. While those large windows might make sense in order to catch as much sunlight as possible, ultimately this would be a very cold place, so smaller windows and darker walls would make more sense in order to retain more heat.  Also, where did they get all of the wood for those doors and such?  ...Sorry for the engineer moment. punches brain"
ImaginaryCityscapes,264brr,Pteraspidomorphi,3,Wed May 21 22:53:29 2014 UTC,"I didn't really see that cliff in the background. Yea, this is probably pretty impractical (unless the streets on the big cliff are considerably bigger with more infrastructure that's shown). However, this looks like a cool setting for a wacky children's book about a little girl with red rainboots going to a bakery or something. Or a cool fantasy campaign, for people who don't overthink it (or they use magic as an excuse)."
