Malazan,3e3oh9,Rabbit_Tooth,9,Tue Jul 21 18:37:53 2015 UTC,Malazan is a prime example of in medias res. Not everyone can digest that.
Malazan,3e3oh9,Coltaine7th,2,Tue Jul 21 18:51:41 2015 UTC,"it's kind of funny, when i was younger, before dvrs and netflix i used to enjoy turning on an episode of law and order half way through and trying to piece it together.  never really liked the show that much when i started watching it from the beginning, seemed overly predictable and dull."
Malazan,3e3oh9,Underdog76,5,Tue Jul 21 22:03:08 2015 UTC,"I just finished Gardens of the Moon, and I loved it. I wish some things here and there were explained in a little more depth, but other than that I was enjoying every bit of the book. I absolutely loved the Adjunct, Tool, and Rake. And some of Kruppe's dialogue actually made me laugh out loud at points. I couldn't put down the last 150 pages or so of the book.   Can't wait to start Deadhouse Gates."
Malazan,3e3oh9,TriscuitCracker,6,Tue Jul 21 18:50:25 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, most of the time, questions you have will probably be answered later by characters experiencing the answers to those very same questions or within the context of the plot of the series as you connect the dots.  You'll have many ""Ah-HAH I get it now!"" moments. Enjoy Deadhouse Gates!"
Malazan,3e3oh9,midnight_toker22,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:11:05 2015 UTC,"Just finished it as well (those were all my favorite characters too)! I have to agree with the OP, I don't know how people could leave with an overall negative impression, I though it was great once I got acclimated to the world and Erikson's writing.   As soon as I finished, I went right out and got Deadhouse Gates and I'm a few chapters in. It's nice coming into it having some background knowledge of characters, locations and events, as opposed to the previous one which had me pretty confused for the first 1/3 of the book or so. I'm definitely liking the start of this book more than GotM though, can't wait to things to keep improving!"
Malazan,3e3oh9,Grumpi83,2,Wed Jul 22 04:25:30 2015 UTC,GoM is my favorite of the series.
Malazan,3e3oh9,BellamNom,2,Tue Jul 21 22:35:24 2015 UTC,"I can totally agree with this. Even though for me each book got better than the last, I can't disagree with this statement."
Malazan,3e3oh9,TriscuitCracker,3,Wed Jul 22 02:36:24 2015 UTC,"If you're good with Dune, Anathem and especially Book of the New Sun, you're gonna do fine. Enjoy Deadhouse Gates! You've only just begun your journey and you have so much farther to go.  Any specifics for GoTM?  Parts you liked, parts you didn't, etc."
Malazan,3e3oh9,japgolly,2,Tue Jul 21 19:09:03 2015 UTC,The link contains a massive spoiler in the 4th paragraph! spoiler  One of the things I enjoyed the most about MBotF was having no idea where everything is going. I would've been pissed to have read that link before completing the series.
Malazan,3e3oh9,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:43:50 2015 UTC,You are correct. Got ahead of myself there. Deleted the link.
Malazan,3e3oh9,TRAIANVS,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:16:57 2015 UTC,"I found Dune to be a much easier read than GotM the first time through, so it's probably just a matter of personal opinion. As for the quality jumping up, the general consensus is that GotM is the worst book in the series by quite a margin, and I'm inclined to agree with those voices.  I think if you read the books carefully (like you seem to be doing) you will definitely be fine. There is of course many more layers of complexity, which you will see if you decide to reread the series in the future. Erikson does foreshadowing like none other, and I don't think any reader could possibly catch more than a tiny fraction of them in the first read.  Also, things are about to really heat up, as they always do in the last part of each book, so buckle up."
Malazan,3e3oh9,BellamNom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:25:51 2015 UTC,"Can tell you're gonna love the entire series. The quality jump is definitely palpable. Brace yourself, your in for one hell of a ride"

Sha'ik is the priestess/commander leading the rebellion, thought to be the incarnation of the Apocalypse/Raraku. Make of this what you will.  As for the Path... power. A lot. And there is one thing that has to do with power and everyone wants..."
Malazan,3e2wrp,Coltaine7th,5,Tue Jul 21 15:47:09 2015 UTC,When looking for information about DG I guess its a pretty good idea to get it from Coltaine.
Malazan,3e2wrp,mortal_sword,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:21:17 2015 UTC,Dryjhna is a female

Malazan,3e2wrp,Coltaine7th,6,Tue Jul 21 19:54:57 2015 UTC,"Dryjhna is the desert goddess. Sha'iks are her high priestesses. Since Dryjhna is a bit angry, the whirlwind is the physical manifestation of that. Its practical function is both a barrier and fast travel warren. She had a lot of followers in 7 cities which explains a part of her power (her power also stems from something else though). Her background is interesting, but I dont believe it is touched upon in this book."
Malazan,3e2wrp,Silmariel,3,Tue Jul 21 19:56:16 2015 UTC,"Second question: It's hard to answer the 2nd one without massive spoilers.  Read Coltaine's answer carefully. You are on the right track with your questions regarding this. Read on!  The Path of Hands questions will be absolutely answered by the end of Deadhouse. Read on!  Man, that wasn't helpful at all, sorry about that. Glad you're liking the series so far! Can't wait to hear what you think at the end of the book.  And don't worry, you're back to Genebakis in Memories of Ice.   EDIT: I was not remembering Dryjhna correctly."
Malazan,3e2wrp,TriscuitCracker,2,Tue Jul 21 15:57:05 2015 UTC,"Dryjhna  was a person, and she got pissed off, with good reason. She is way more than a desert deity. Her actions have reverberated into the present and touches on some very significant characters, outside of the theater in this book.   Edit: I have edited this a few times, because Im paranoid that I give spoilers out :("
Malazan,3e2wrp,Silmariel,2,Tue Jul 21 19:41:38 2015 UTC,Yea path of hands should be experienced without any prior knowledge so definitely a big RAFO

Malazan,3dyy5w,iwillnotfear,7,Mon Jul 20 22:55:30 2015 UTC,I think it is explained in one of the books - much of the cursing is done with a sort of irony ie Togg doesn't have teats nor does Hood have breath!
Malazan,3dyy5w,TisteSimeon,2,Tue Jul 21 04:23:36 2015 UTC,I believe Toc explains it to ALL.

Malazan,3e0wke,DkAlex610,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:44:17 2015 UTC,"He appears with Hood in the final Mhybe scenes but is not identified as Baudin.   Edit, whoops, this is answered below."
Malazan,3e0wke,future_forward,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:25:47 2015 UTC,"Hmm alright... I believe you, but I'm curious as to why? Wasn't Baudin ex-Talon, and the Rope ex-Claw? Why would they be rolling together, since Cotillion is his main man?   Edit: Oh you said Hood, and I was thinking of Shadowthrone. My bad there, , but I'll leave it. However, I still don't know why Baudin would be chillin' with Hood."
Malazan,3e0wke,DkAlex610,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:31:53 2015 UTC,"Before ascension, Dancer was the head of the Talon. Surely, before becoming Empress, was the head of the Claw."
Malazan,3e0wke,Bilbato,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:54:22 2015 UTC,"Hood chose him as his Solider of Death he didn't have a say in the matter. He can't remember anything from his life except ""fire"" if i remember correctly.  He is the guy who buries the Mhybe in the temple with the swords stuck in his hands. Rope was ex-head of the Talon."
Malazan,3e0wke,adamanderrake,6,Tue Jul 21 19:22:50 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a resurrection-prone series, and plenty more to come. There's nearly always a substantial price to pay though, and plenty of them are ""fate worse than death"" territory. I don't think any of them seem like ""whoops, I shouldn't have killed that guy off"" either.   If that's not enough then rest assured there are some definite tear-jerkers and epic perma-exits later on, esp in books 7-10."
Malazan,3e0wke,Lankles,6,Tue Jul 21 03:18:20 2015 UTC,Immortality is rarely a blessing in the Malazan series.  It can be a cause for terror.  What if the worst happens -- for all eternity?  And what if you can't kill your worst enemy?
Malazan,3e0wke,wjbc,5,Tue Jul 21 03:27:22 2015 UTC,"If you are expecting death in the malazan world to be the same as death in our world, then you are sorely mistaken.   I don't really want to say anything that is going to spoil things for you, but death cannot be treated the same as you would it in our world. Think on it like this: 'magic' in the malazan world takes many forms - even magic from the same source; a warren is both a means of travel and a means of conjuring magic.   So what then does it mean, if death itself has a warren.. a realm..?"
Malazan,3e0wke,sillywillywillkilly,4,Tue Jul 21 11:59:19 2015 UTC,"Also to add:  It doesn't appear to me that Steven treats the death of a character as trivial, or as a talking point (""whoa man, I can't believe xxx has just died!!!""), or even just for the sake of shocking the reader with something unexpected.   Everything has a reason in these books, you won't find any 'ex machina' saving graces here"
Malazan,3e0wke,sillywillywillkilly,5,Tue Jul 21 12:04:39 2015 UTC,"Some die and come back. Some die and ascend. Some die and come back undead or in someone else's body. In the Malazan universe, death itself is not tragic. What happens to a person while being alive or for that matter dead is of more importance. Remember, the fates can be cruel to those who are living and also to those who have died. ASoIaF uses death as a shock and awe technique and often, it subtracts something from the tale. Here, death is treated subtly and more poetically. It is the ability of Steven Erikson to move us not just with death but with life as well, that makes Malazan a much better read than ASoIaF. And before you slam me for saying that ASoIaF ain't that good, I would like to say that I read ASoIaF before Malazan and until then, I rated ASoIaF very highly. Like many here would agree, once you read the complete works of Steven Erikson and ICE, anything in the fantasy genre (excluding LoTR) has to be benchmarked against Malazan."
Malazan,3e0wke,the_bridgeburner,4,Tue Jul 21 13:54:00 2015 UTC,"Coltaine is reborn as a child, if anything. I still consider that tragic. There are many, many deaths in the series that people don't come back from, even early on. And for everything there is a cost. The barrier between the living and the dead may be fluid- it literally exists as Hood's Gate- but for someone to come back 'better off?' For free, or even at all? No. I don't know what series you're reading."
Malazan,3e0wke,LucidLunatic,6,Tue Jul 21 04:02:26 2015 UTC,"Lol hate to break it to you but Baudin already came back in MOI, he was in Gruntle's legion, the guy who couldn't let go of his swords and had no memories. Far as I can recall he never comes back afterwards, and it doesn't really cheapen the death for me because Baudin is basically dead; his body is just the soldier of High House Death now."
Malazan,3e0wke,mortal_sword,5,Tue Jul 21 03:09:57 2015 UTC,I'm not sure that's right- it's pretty clear that he's the Knight of Death that shows up before the Siege of Pale. (Can't remember the name of the other city).
Malazan,3e0wke,LucidLunatic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:59:29 2015 UTC,Do you mean the siege of capustan? Cuz the siege of pale was GotM and Baudin had yet to be introduced.
Malazan,3e0wke,Bilbato,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:15:28 2015 UTC,"Hah, evidently I can't remember the names of any cities. But yes. Baudin is the Knight of High House Death that shows up toward the end- appears as one of the Gidrath, according to the Wikia."
Malazan,3e0wke,LucidLunatic,4,Tue Jul 21 13:34:35 2015 UTC,You mean the guy that interred the Mhybe while Coll and Murillio watched?
Malazan,3e0wke,adamanderrake,3,Tue Jul 21 03:26:58 2015 UTC,"Yes. That was Baudin, Hood chose him to be the Soldier of High House Death."

Knight: I was, I think, sworn to defend a child's life. But the child was no more.  Clearly Baudin. Also, he's the Knight, replacing Dassem Ultor. If you look at the glossary, under High House Death, it says ""Knight (once Dassem Ultor)"""
Malazan,3e0wke,mortal_sword,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:11:01 2015 UTC,Dassem Ultor was the Knight/Champion of HHDeath but he forsake Hood.
Malazan,3e0wke,Bilbato,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:54:52 2015 UTC,"I don't remember exactly, I know Coll talks to him at one point anyway."
Malazan,3e0wke,TriscuitCracker,3,Tue Jul 21 03:34:24 2015 UTC,"Just because a character may have died, does not mean they will come back. Furthermore, even if a character comes back from death, do not under any circumstance assume it is the same person, that they will think, act, feel the way before the events of what happened.  Would you behave the same, think the same, feel the same about anything if you had been dead for days and then magically came back to life? Why do you assume that there is no effect on the character because of this? Why would you assume that the character is still the same?"
Malazan,3e0wke,RuinEleint,3,Tue Jul 21 03:15:22 2015 UTC,"At the risk of spoiling, don't worry. There are plenty of characters who don't ""come back"" so to speak in any way, shape or form.  Some you've met and some you haven't.   I can see how you may become jaded however, death isn't exactly permanent in your experience so far. I hope you'll keep reading!"
Malazan,3e0wke,TRAIANVS,3,Tue Jul 21 03:43:43 2015 UTC,Just wait until you read RG.
Malazan,3e0wke,WulftheRed,3,Tue Jul 21 05:00:19 2015 UTC,Really the only one of the deaths you mentioned where the resurrection wasn't foreshadowed like crazy was Paran.
Malazan,3e0wke,aimzzz,2,Tue Jul 21 09:23:59 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree with you that Erikson is a bit overfond of killing off a character and then bringing them back, although I'd disagree that most of them are ""better off than they were before"". Most of them are changed by their death and resurrection - an obvious example being that Silverfox is NOT Tattersail, she may be the dominant soul but there are other people within Silverfox. As for other examples, if you haven't read past MOI then you ain't seen nothing yet!  There's a conversation later on when someone makes a comment on the lines of ""Doesn't anyone stay dead around here?"" and while there's a story-related reason for that character to make that comment in that place, I think it's maybe also a sly nod from Erikson that he's well aware that he might be overusing this idea."

Malazan,3dzd7k,Suqleg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:24:55 2015 UTC,"I'm scared of spoilers, don't want to go to a character page having the first sentence of the bio telling me when they die or something"
Malazan,3dzd7k,aimzzz,2,Tue Jul 21 13:28:55 2015 UTC,Try the Wiki Fan Art page. One thing I like about it is there's more than one picture of a lot of characters. It's interesting to see how different artists view the same person. The Fan Art page is pictures-only... no descriptions beyond the picture title.

Malazan,3dylff,Circle_Breaker,30,Mon Jul 20 16:19:39 2015 UTC,"Your friend has given you horrible advice.  Midnight Tides is among the best books in the whole series and is completely vital to the overarching plots uniting the rest of the books.  It is NOT a standalone.  It is followed directly by RG, DOD and TCG."
Malazan,3dylff,pfk505,2,Mon Jul 20 16:46:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly I wasn't that fond of the book  I didn't really like the Edur characters and I hated Udinas, the one saving grace in that entire country was Tehol & Bug  However I would not recommend anyone to skip it under any circumstance"
Malazan,3dylff,Bunnylove_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:14:19 2015 UTC,"I thought the early parts of that book were brilliant.  Erikson's crafting of the Edur characters and their culture was brilliantly realized, and it was one of the moments in the series where I really felt transported out of reality as a reader.  I was just so into it.  Udinaas I'll grant you wasn't my favourite character in that book but his arc progresses nicely throughout the rest of the series.  And yes, Tehol and Bugg are the greatest."
Malazan,3dylff,pfk505,15,Tue Jul 21 18:17:07 2015 UTC,"No, it's important. Not only it's backstory, but it sets the groundwork for the rest of the series. It just wouldn't be the same without it.  I, too, found it weak at first, but it was just because it didn't have any - almost - of the characters I knew from the previous books, but by the time you finish it, you'll appreciate the new cast as if they were part of the ""original"" :]"
Malazan,3dylff,Coltaine7th,8,Mon Jul 20 16:25:26 2015 UTC,"Agree wholeheartedly. Midnight Tides will introduce a number a new characters with Trull Sengar as the only real person from previous works.  However, despite new characters it is important to the overall story and should not be skipped.  Plus, MT introduces probably my favorite character in the entire series so far (I am almost done with TTH) in Tehol Beddict.  In my opinion, the book is worth reading just for Tehol and Bugg."
Malazan,3dylff,OnGiantsShoulders,10,Mon Jul 20 16:37:41 2015 UTC,"Um...no, not at all. Midnight Tides starts the last main plotline.  You'll miss waaay to much.  There is great drama, action and most definitely comedy you'd be missing.  I will admit at the start of Midnight Tides you're at an entirely new continent and only one recurring character and I was ""AAAAAH!"" when I saw that, but by the end it was one of my fave books.    Do not skip it.    EDIT: What did you think of House of Chains?"
Malazan,3dylff,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:49:10 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed it. I would probably rate it something around 7.5/10. It's weird because I absolutely flew through it, but for some reason I found it to be the weakest of the first 4 (well one of them has to be!).  The entire book just kinda seemed like build up to me. I remember being about 500 pages in and having the feeling that I was still in the first act (probably because the book was dedicated to Karsa.) My favorite parts were defiantly Strings POVs, and in general the Malazan army. I enjoyed the anticlimatic duel at the end.   There are couple things that I was a bit confused about. Like what was the deal with the Bridgeburners song? Unless I missed it, that didn't really play a role in the climax, to me it seemed to be a smoking gun that never went off.  Also what deal did Aspalar make with dancer? Was that explained in the book, or is that for the future?"
Malazan,3dylff,sillywillywillkilly,4,Mon Jul 20 17:05:42 2015 UTC,"that didn't really play a role in the climax   Don't look at the malazan book of the fallen as a ten book series, look at it more as a single book split into ten parts - this might help with plots or events or conversations not seeming to lead anywhere. They eventually will.   Steven mentioned in an interview somewhere that with this series, he has written a really long, short story."
Malazan,3dylff,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:05:03 2015 UTC,Both the repercussions of the Bridgeburners Tano song and Apsalar's deal with Dancer will be explained in Bonehunters!

Malazan,3dylff,Blusummers,3,Mon Jul 20 17:55:41 2015 UTC,"Midnight Tides is my favorite book in the series. Reaper's Gale is a sequel to MT, like HoC is to DG. Midnight Tides explains a few things that has already happened but you've had no explanation for. There's not a single book in the series I would recommend skipping."

Malazan,3dwv1d,mortal_sword,3,Tue Jul 21 00:19:26 2015 UTC,Its an excerpt from Gothos' Folly. I think it was at the beginning of a chapter.

Malazan,3dwv1d,RuinEleint,3,Tue Jul 21 02:30:01 2015 UTC,Figures he'd write about himself in the 3rd person. The dragon would try to escape from Gothos' long winded stories.

That's pretty meaningful, but the end of the book when the girl is returned to Pannion... that's a bit of a tear-jerker.   Fiddler moments are usually pretty poignant. One of the specific ones I remember is in Reaper's Gale when he's setting up the Drum, and Cuttle is watching him. ""The last of the great Malazan sappers"" gave me a little shiver. I was also struck pretty hard by the fiddling scene in Malaz City with Gesler, Stormy and Braven Tooth.  Aside from that, any moment with the Mott Irregulars just makes me laugh, Crump in particular, because they're the embodiment of ridiculousness and calamity."

Malazan,3dwv1d,parabola01,3,Mon Jul 20 13:16:53 2015 UTC,"http://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/3898723-the-bonehunters-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-6.  That link has some great quotes.  One of my favorite quotes is this one:    “There is something profoundly cynical, my friends, in the notion of paradise after death. The lure is evasion. The promise is excusative. One need not accept responsibility for the world as it is, and by extension, one need do nothing about it. To strive for change, for true goodness in this mortal world, one must acknowledge and accept, within one's own soul, that this mortal reality has purpose in itself, that its greatest value is not for us, but for our children and their children. To view life as but a quick passage alone a foul, tortured path – made foul and tortured by our own indifference – is to excuse all manner of misery and depravity, and to exact cruel punishment upon the innocent lives to come.  I defy this notion of paradise beyond the gates of bone. If the soul truly survives the passage, then it behooves us – each of us, my friends – to nurture a faith in similitude: what awaits us is a reflection of what we leave behind, and in the squandering of our mortal existence, we surrender the opportunity to learn the ways of goodness, the practice of sympathy, empathy, compassion and healing – all passed by in our rush to arrive at a place of glory and beauty, a place we did not earn, and most certainly do not deserve.” ― Steven Erikson, The Bonehunters    Also one of the moments that gave me goosebumps is when Tool rescues Toc where he just crashes through the walls to go fuck shit up.  Another is when one of the children of shadow is killed while defending the throne of shadow and Onrack does the speech of how they have never seen a Tlan Imass act in anger.  TL:DR Too many epic moments that gave me goosebumps."
Malazan,3dwv1d,Sonofkyuss666,2,Mon Jul 20 12:59:47 2015 UTC,"Along those same lines of when shit is going to go down! moments is this one:   Crimson smile broadening, Moroch Nevath sagged to the slick stones, even as Rhulad pitched down. Another figure loomed over him, then. One of Rhulad’s brothers. Who spoke as if from a long distance away. ‘Tell me your name, Finadd.’ Moroch sought to answer, but he was drowning in blood. I am Moroch Nevath. And I have killed your damned emperor. ‘Are you the King’s Champion in truth? Your soldiers on the bridge seem to be yelling that – King’s Champion ... is that who you are, Finadd?’ No. You bastards have not met him yet. With that pleasing thought, Moroch Nevath died."
Malazan,3dvy3m,Kheshire,5,Sun Jul 19 23:56:41 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit vague on this because I read this stuff a while ago. I loved the continuity of the Silanda and all but the timeline always confused me. As far as I can recall, Binaddas set off with the ship in the Nascent, got killed by Karsa ( like most thing in HoC), was piloted by him and Nom for a while, they left it, Kulp, Heboric, Ges, Story Felisin etc boarded during the crazy mage pulling them into a warren, then some T'lan tried to close the rent left by the mage, Kulp and the others escape, while ges and his people got hit by Kurald Lisoan though the Rent and were transformed by the fires of Telas as well as Liosan. Making them very powerful humans, nearly Ascendants. I don't know if there's more backstory but I think the heads were some random Andiis they'd found. Correct me if I'm wrong."
Malazan,3dvy3m,mortal_sword,9,Mon Jul 20 01:44:58 2015 UTC,"The Nascent was a plains-type warren that the Edur flooded with a demon-realm river/ocean. They used it to speed up their search globally for other Edur/champions to face Rhulad.   The Silanda was originally a boat that ran a regular route from Drift Avalii (the moving island controlled by the Andii). The boat was crewed by Andii and was fairly well known because that moving island thing is special. It disappeared from its route for a long time and the next time it popped back up, Binadas was the captain with a headless zombie Andii source of propulsion.   Perhaps Binadas found it like that, but we know that it's more likely he and the other Edur did the beheading and the zombifying. Something happened during the zombifying in the Nascent that made the Silanda strangely immune to rot or slowed time down greatly.   So Karsa wiped out the Edur and then left the boat. Kulp, Heboric, Felisin, Baudin, Stormy, Gesler, and Truth all made it onboard the boat. Heboric, Baudin, Felisin, and Kulp fell off, which made them go somewhere other than where Stormy, Gesler, and Truth went.  Stormy, Gesler, and Truth were transformed by the fires, the zombifying sorcery, and so on to be the next best thing to Ascendants outright."
Malazan,3dvy3m,Udinaas,2,Mon Jul 20 03:11:58 2015 UTC,"I dont think anything happened to the Silanda to make her immune to rot.  Tiste edur ships are made from blackwood or ""living wood"", which if I recall was one of the main reason Letheras wanted to conquer the tiste, as the wood can heal itself and is therefore sought after material for building ships especially.  Not to be confused with the bloodwoods from which the toblakai make their weapons."

Malazan,3dvy3m,mortal_sword,0,Mon Jul 20 17:10:04 2015 UTC,"The Silanda was not an Edur-made ship.  The description is a ""Quon dromon"". I'm not sure what exactly that entails, but the crew was Andii."
Malazan,3dvy3m,Udinaas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:36:48 2015 UTC,"As far as I understood, it was an Edur ship, the only edur ship with a contract to trade with the first empire.  I think the text is a bit ambiguous but that is how I understand it.  If it was an empire ship why was it crewed by the tiste, with tiste andu sorcery and also the only reason how that ship can survive all it does.   Don't need one to know this ship,' Baudin said. 'That cargo lying about down there, that's from Drift Avalü. Silanda was the only craft sanctioned to trade with the Tiste Andü. She was on her way to the island when the Emperor's forces overran Quon. She never returned.'"
Malazan,3dvy3m,Sonofkyuss666,0,Tue Jul 21 06:16:03 2015 UTC,"Drift Avalii was controlled by the Andii and there was a trade route between Quon and the island. The overrunning of Quon Tali happened about 200 years before the battle of Pale.   There is no chance the Silanda was originally Edur. The Edur did not want to trade with the Andii - in fact, they wanted to murder the Andii (Ahlrada, Bluerose etc). The building of the Silanda also is too early for the Edur expansion.  There is no First Empire relation either."

Malazan,3dvkdp,grixa,3,Mon Jul 20 14:53:38 2015 UTC,"I love the following paragraph that describes the Malazan series really well. Very mild Memories of Ice spoilers:  ""Homeric in scope and vision, Erikson interweaves stories and characters upon a grand stage that not only captures but competes for the reader's attention. The description of the assault upon Capustan is reminiscent of the blind poet's siege of Troy, with figures equally bold and tragic, and struggles Herculean in task. Gods are Olympian in character, if playing quite dissimilar roles. And the final battle before Coral is cataclysmic, leaving both heroes and foes fallen (like Martin, Erikson is not one to pull his punches). But what really sets the author's writing apart, aside from his rich and vivid use of language and description, his unparalleled management of action and gripping combat, his compassion towards his characters, or the sheer scale of his imagination and mythic vision, is the secondary and thematic elements running well beneath all the action and apparent fantasy, metaphors and allegory that speak, if one is listening, to deeper intellectual and existential issues easily lost amidst the toil and turmoil of the author's animated and cyclopean plots. Themes of loss and redemption, religion and the sacrifice of love, identity, heroism and what it means to be human, are woven through mirroring imagery of beasts, men and gods blinded by a single eye, or a mother's love which can both nurture and destroy. The body can become crippled, though deformity need not disfigure the spirit or the heart. And through the entire story there exists a deep and abiding humanity that refuses easy simplification or categorization into dichotomies of good and evil, right and wrong, even when identified. Each and every character struggles with their personal burdens, losses and joys, some to be resolved, others to be carried, and in ways as unique and varied as the characters portrayed. Finally, despite the tragedy and heroism expected of a work that consciously embraces the epic form, and does so in a way that truly captures this genre's original intention, rather than merely mimicking its style and content, the author has also infused his narrative with a great amount of humour that, just as in real life, alleviates and offers counterpoint to the great tragedy, pathos and at times brutality of this ambitious and prodigious tale.""

To answer your questions as best as I can, if  I recall Vorcan was injured and being hunted by the Tiste, Rallick saw the only safe option available... the house ( its also a bit of a RAFO)  Kruppe and K'rul pulled him into the dream as far as I can recall.  That fight really is! I loved reading the climax, it was awesome. The fight with Raest was great too, as well as the assassin stuff. I love the fact that Rake wore a black dragon mask to the fete.

Anomander Rake, behold the one they call the Eel.  Darujhistan's master-spy.'  'Do you jest?'

It's a surprise in GotM considering how his powers were described in the build up to his awakening, but remember that Raest has been asleep for a very long time, and the world has changed while he was asleep.  That's perhaps the biggest surprise in GotM, but it isn't really explained until later."
Malazan,3dsl0l,tyl110,6,Sun Jul 19 01:29:53 2015 UTC,"The malazan books are a high fantasy epic set in a world fraught with believable characters, intrigue, magic and a history that is both extraordinarily rich and ancient.  The books are very fast paced in so far as there is little in the way of a formal intro.  You are given only enough info to understand what is going on... Most of the time.  Although it can be a difficult read, and not for everyone,  it is an extremely satisfying series full of action suspense intrigue laughter and tears. I highly recommend."

Malazan,3dufay,shaiyamalaz,8,Sun Jul 19 16:08:45 2015 UTC,Its way to big and if someone did try to do it I think they would ruin it.  However I think they could somehow cut out smaller stories in the world that would work.    I always thought a Chain of Dogs movie/show would work.
Malazan,3dufay,Jhantax,6,Sun Jul 19 16:23:15 2015 UTC,Nope. Malazan Tv series maybe. But not a movie. Definetly not a movie.
Malazan,3dufay,Kellt_,3,Sun Jul 19 17:58:52 2015 UTC,Please...not a movie. A long running TV series would be fantastic though
Malazan,3dufay,noimadethis,-1,Sun Jul 19 18:26:40 2015 UTC,"Yep, it should be good too, but they (makers of movie) can try to make the first movie GotM and then deicide according to the spectators and fans of this movie if it is possible to make next movies according to the book serie."
Malazan,3dufay,OldManSimms,2,Sun Jul 19 19:24:28 2015 UTC,Gardens of the Moon was originally written as a screenplay. Erikson reworked it into a book after years of failing to get it actually made into a movie.
Malazan,3dufay,TRAIANVS,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:56:02 2015 UTC,AFAIK it changed significantly in the conversion from screenplay to novel. Apparently the movie was supposed to have a much lighter tone than the novel.
Malazan,3dufay,TriscuitCracker,2,Mon Jul 20 16:02:20 2015 UTC,Movie would be great but they'd have to cut out most of the series to fit.  I think the only way Malazan would work is a long running comic book series like Cerebus or Lone Wolf and Cub.  Or an animated series with a Gargoyles-like style or Avatar Last Airbender style. And it would have to be on HBO or another non network channel.
Malazan,3dufay,AenTaenverde,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:20:06 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid it would end up like that Avatar movie, that was never made.  I always thought, that with the scale the world of Malazan has, it would need to be a TV series with a lot of expensive CGI or an anime (which due to amount of content and work needed be a better choice by far).  Someone like ufotable (I'm just a sucker for their animation style) would be a great candidate for it."
Malazan,3dufay,noimadethis,2,Sun Jul 19 16:42:17 2015 UTC,You think there would need to be that much CGI? When I read the series my vision of it is pretty low on the effects end.
Malazan,3dufay,AenTaenverde,4,Sun Jul 19 18:22:53 2015 UTC,"Massive battles with thousands of soldiers, non-humans and monsters with spells, traveling through warrens. In those days, even camps of higher sizes, backgrounds, crowds or cities are done in CGI - see Game of Thrones VFX breakdown."

Malazan,3dpmit,wjbc,8,Sat Jul 18 05:47:34 2015 UTC,"Also - if you're in an unmarked thread, assume it's no-spoiler, regardless of the title's contents (unless it's quite clear, like ""just finished RG."")

Malazan,3dpmit,Oathsend,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:48:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with this.  Also, people seem to keep posting character names alongside the book name in post titles which might bother you a bit if you are reading an earlier book with that character in it."

Malazan,3dq14f,Sathram,5,Sat Jul 18 09:28:17 2015 UTC,"The way I interpreted this was that the gods will choose an actual Mortal Sword, Shield Anvil, and Destriant, whereas the Reves (Grey Swords etc) simply use the same titles.  For example, Krughava is the Mortal Sword of the Perish Grey Helms, who happen to worship Togg and Fanderay. Krughava is not the Mortal Sword of Togg and Fanderay. Contrast that to Gruntle and Heboric who are actually chosen by Trake and are the actual things.  Basically, the titles are First Empire words that the mercenary companies have adopted for their own purposes."
Malazan,3dq14f,ashjjw,2,Sat Jul 18 16:35:04 2015 UTC,This makes sense and looks like most plausible explanation.
Malazan,3dq14f,SageOfTheWise,0,Sat Jul 18 16:48:28 2015 UTC,"This explanation also fits with the events of MoI, where The Grey Swords Shield Anvil wasn't actually Fener's Shield Anvil.  Though it also gets a bit more confusing when you think about it. Togg and Fanderay, despite always being mentioned together, are two different gods. I don't think there's a reason they couldn't have two sets. Again to use MoI as an example, on that council of people who represented gods in Capustan, there was a representative for Togg and for Fanderay, not one for both."
Malazan,3dq14f,SageOfTheWise,3,Sat Jul 18 17:58:00 2015 UTC,"This explanation also fits with the events of MoI, where The Grey Swords Shield Anvil wasn't actually Fener's Shield Anvil.   Wait what. Any source on that? Considering what he did, he absolutely was Shield Anvil."
Malazan,3dq14f,Oathsend,2,Sat Jul 18 18:22:24 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean Itkovian. I might have been thinking of Destriant, not Shield Anvil.  There's a whole plot where someone is publically claiming and known as Fener's Shield Anvil or Destriant, and only a few people know that Fener's real chosen one is someone else. Whole bunch of Grey Swords die because of it and everything."
Malazan,3dq14f,TocTheEternal,4,Sat Jul 18 19:46:00 2015 UTC,"You're thinking of Rath'Fener, one of the representatives on the Council of Masks. He publicly claimed to be aspiring/to being Feners Destriant, despite the fact that there already was one in the Grey Swords."
Malazan,3dq14f,Jonna09,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:40:25 2015 UTC,"Wait what? I'm pretty sure that the Grey Swords had the real representatives as their leader. Itkovian was definitely Fener's real Shield Anvil, same with their Mortal Sword. Probably the Destraint too."
Malazan,3dq14f,i_a1m_to_misbehave,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:02:39 2015 UTC,"I had this doubt when reading BH as well and this definitely seems like the right answer.  I wonder then, what would happen if these counterparts ran into each other? For the events in MoI, it worked out well enough for Karnadas because he was clearly superior in skill.   But what if the title holder of a reeve actually turned out to be stronger or more capable than the one the god chose?"
Malazan,3dq14f,Oathsend,2,Sat Jul 18 22:55:03 2015 UTC,"Togg and Fanderay were First Heroes, if I recall correctly, or equivalent, similar to Trake's position before succeeding Fener as the God of War.   As /u/Oathsend said, it's possible that the group previously existed, but only became aligned once the Wolves claimed the Beast Throne, or that the alignment existed, but only the positions were taken up when the new gods chose their followers."
Malazan,3dq14f,i_a1m_to_misbehave,3,Sat Jul 18 15:53:16 2015 UTC,"Togg and Fanderay were never Soletaken in any way, actually. They never had any kind of human form, and had ascended as beasts. Treach, on the other hand, was a human that gained a Soletaken tiger form sometime during Dessimbelackis' First Empire, and slowly lost the ability to semble back to his human form.  Your point is still entirely applicable, just a bit of background information you might not have known, I guess.   Edit: ""First Hero"" is just the First Empire title for an Ascendant/Soletaken/D'ivers, by the way."
Malazan,3dq14f,i_a1m_to_misbehave,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:33:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I did know it! Pretty cool. And yup @ that last bit, though I thought it was only applicable to Ascendants - probably wouldn't call Dejim Nebrahl a First Hero. I also highly approve of your use of the word ""semble""."

At the same time Grey Swords have Destriant, Shield Anvil and Mortal Sword of the same Togg and Fanderay.  How come there's 2 trios?"
Malazan,3dq14f,Storm-Of-Aeons,2,Sat Jul 18 16:12:35 2015 UTC,"Either the Grey Helms had always worshipped the Wolves - meaning there was no crossover with previous titles, even when the Grey Swords realigned their worship to the Wolves - or they used to worship Fener - meaning they recently inherited their titles. That's assuming they are even the actual Mortal Swords/Shield Anvils/Destriants, which they might not even be, as /u/ashjjw said.  It's not always a known thing whether a God possesses a Mortal Sword/Destriant or not. This is shown pretty clearly in how Rath'Fener was aspiring to be the Destriant of Fener despite the fact that a member of the Grey Swords was already the Destriant. It's not even a widespread knowledge between the worshippers themselves."
Malazan,3dq14f,Oathsend,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:20:46 2015 UTC,Repeating it doesn't clarify it.

Malazan,3dq14f,420DnD,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:16:29 2015 UTC,"Since there are never more than one Mortal Sword/Shield Anvil/Destriant of a single god, it's likely that the Grey Helms either didn't have those leading members and only recently had them reach those ranks, or had members assuming those titles until all three happened to inherit the actual titles after the Grey Sword started worshipping the Wolves instead of Fener."

Malazan,3do361,mortal_sword,2,Fri Jul 17 21:13:24 2015 UTC,"I love that this is somehow number 48 on the front page, but I haven't read that book yet, so no response xD."
Malazan,3do361,Exxetron,3,Fri Jul 17 23:21:47 2015 UTC,48?
Malazan,3do361,pencil_pusher,2,Fri Jul 17 23:47:04 2015 UTC,"I think he means spot 48 on his front page of reddit.  To respond to your post...  I hadn't really thought of it.  I would be curious to see what a tiste ""family"" is though.  I'm wondering if it's something like a giant clan, where you have the leader (the ""father"" figure) acting as a surrogate parent for the rest of the clan..  And that's it.  No actual parents, nothing.  This is a complete shot in the dark and likely wrong...  But I believe most of the father figures we do see are the heads of their house, so there is that.  Other than that?  I think Rake is a bastardized version of Purake, something that just happened over time.  Silchas Ruin..  I'm not sure if that isn't just his ""first name"" or not.  It's a tough call, and hell if I can follow the way Erikson chooses his names.  Yes, there is a lot of hatred in those books.  A lot of people you just can't stand, and that you want to see crucified.  This upcoming civil war is going to be bloody as all hell..."
Malazan,3do361,pencil_pusher,2,Sat Jul 18 02:09:25 2015 UTC,"I figured but I'm confused as to why it would be number 48.   Well an interesting idea but most of the families I mentioned are direct mothers and fathers, Like Osserc's dad, Nimander's dad ( Rake doesn't even know the identity of his mom), and so on most the people live in typical blood family units that I mentioned. A lot fo characters think about motherhood, raising children, Arathan wants to see his mom, I think the ideal family unit does have both mother and father but weirdly its skewed in this book.   Yeah I assumed, Silchas i have no idea, I remember scratching my head back in MT when they called him Rake's brother and I find myself still doing it even after FoD. I assumed Purake got bastardized as well yes but in this book people call him Rake to, so I'm not sure? And yeah tbh most fantasy authors have crazy naming choices.  Its funny actually, you'd think crucifixion would make me think of Jesus but Erikson's actually caused me to only think of Coltaine, the army and the kids in the Rebellion. He can really write villains."
Malazan,3do361,pencil_pusher,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:26:23 2015 UTC,"Ah, each front page is different depending on which subreddits you have and this might have just been there..  As to why I really don't have a clue how reddit determines what should be on someones front page at a given time.  Yes, they are.  I'm very willing to admit that my idea was a shot in the dark.  It could be that for the most part the tiste are a patriarchal society (maybe this is why some are uncomfortable with mother dark and her ""consort"", and want to put Urusunder(I think) up as the king and new co ruler.  After all I'm fairly sure the only reason Mother Dark is ruling is because Draconis wanted to fulfill her wish and granted her power..  Though I may also be wrong there).  Or it could just be that for some strange coincidence all the mothers in the series are not in the picture, for some reason or another.   Ah, they do call him Rake?  It's been a while since I read that book so I wasn't sure..  Okay new theory on how the hell this works.  They are all part of ""Purake Hold"" as stated in the Dramatis Personae.  It is quite likely that ""purake"" is not a surname, given that Draconus is part of ""Dracons Hold""(Draconus Dracons?  Wouldn't put it past Erikson...).  I then wonder if ""Rake"" is the name given to the leader of that house, or if surnames have significance among leaders/other notables.  For example Osseric has no surname that I am aware of, however his father does have one.  I feel like Eriksons naming is even worse than others, because given his anthropology background the names make sense(somehow)...  I love to hate his villains.  It is just so much fun to have these characters that I just loathe.  I see no redeeming features, nothing.  Mother fricking Jistal priest...  Oh man am I waiting for Nil and Nether to grow up and tear him a brand new breathing hole."
Malazan,3do361,pencil_pusher,2,Sat Jul 18 02:47:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess so, must just have been number 48 for some reason.  Yeah I figure its just a coincidence or maybe subtly its supposed to be a contrasting thing, motherless realm, mother dark. And I think that's what Draconus did.  It is pretty patriarchal but what's odd is that usually in that type of society the women do the raising while men do jobs. Its odd is all.  I just have no clue with the names, I just stay faithful that they''l make sense one day, its my dream.  Have you read ICE?"
Malazan,3dmx13,wezzboy123,17,Fri Jul 17 15:55:41 2015 UTC,I admit. I judge everything by Malazan now. It has absolutely colored the rest of fantasy literature for me.
Malazan,3dmx13,mgallowglas,8,Fri Jul 17 16:21:27 2015 UTC,"I still enjoy fantasy. I read Joe Abercrombie after Malazan and who doesnt like his stuff. Also I only read The Black Company after Malazan so it was almost like getting to read Malazan again, but not, but good!  If you are looking for some good fantasy series, I recommend the first two Joe Abercrombie trilogies, Glen Cook (Black Company), or Richard Morgans trilogy. The latter is also good for awesome sci fi.  You can also get a kick out of Lawrences, prince of thorns trilogy, or Scott Lynchs bastard series. Also R. Scott Bakker has made a really good trilogy called The Prince of Nothing. I especially recommend that one to Malazan fans, because it is heavy on the philosophical musings and abstractions familiar to malazan devotees.  Also, there is this huge body of work from the Guy Gavriel Kay. If you havent already, get started, that stuff is seriously going to blow your mind.  Having said all that. The only thing that comes close to Malazan for me, is more malazan. So, so happy that more is comming. I would have a depression if there was no more to come."
Malazan,3dmx13,Silmariel,2,Fri Jul 17 17:02:02 2015 UTC,I don't like Joe Abercrombie.

The first I read was Tigana, and from that one I jumped to The Lions of Al-rassan and then Sailing to Sarantium. Honestly, except for his trilogy, I dont think you can go wrong in your reading order."
Malazan,3dmx13,Silmariel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:32:52 2015 UTC,The Kingkiller Chronicles is amazeballs. Unfortunately it is not finished yet.  It is extremely well written.

I have a different attitude from most people when I read books.  While actively reading them I literally do not think about them, I don't pick up on foreshadowing, I just sit back and enjoy the ride. Part of what helps with this is that I'll normally read a book over a day or two, so I don't have much time between reading sessions to think it over...  So what it comes down to is that I just enjoy the story, and I like being entertained.  Anything out there can have an enjoyable story, it can be a fun ride.  Hell, I can only handle a true Malazan rollercoaster every now and then before it just becomes routine..."
Malazan,3dmx13,pencil_pusher,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:58:22 2015 UTC,"I don't pick up on foreshadowing, I just sit back and enjoy the ride.   I wish more people would do this.

Malazan,3dmx13,Jester814,2,Fri Jul 17 18:34:37 2015 UTC,No
Malazan,3dmx13,Armed_To_The_Teets,2,Fri Jul 17 15:59:41 2015 UTC,I still enjoy plenty of other series but they all seem a bit shallow now. Quite predictable too in many cases....not like I know exactly what will happen but you pick up on subtle clues and have a good general idea.
Malazan,3dmx13,0haymai,2,Fri Jul 17 16:27:06 2015 UTC,Sure. But I enjoy them differently than Malazan. It's like with music. I don't enjoy metal and jazz in the same way.
Malazan,3dmx13,TRAIANVS,2,Fri Jul 17 20:09:28 2015 UTC,"I have been disappointed by a lack of foreshadowing since reading Malazan.  A recent example: reading a book that features animate stone gargoyles, a certain character did things like taking ponderous heavy steps or regarding other characters with a ""stone face"" so I just knew he was going to turn out to be a secret gargoyle.   nope :("
Malazan,3dmx13,codyloydl,2,Fri Jul 17 21:37:23 2015 UTC,"It definitely narrowed the fantasy genre to a few select series. I could not read the Wheel of Time Series after the Malazan, and reading the Blade Itself felt bland. However the Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones) was still enjoyable."
Malazan,3dmx13,ZubKhanate,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:58:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a little. I try to judge everything on it's own merits though. I can't deny that Malazan has slightly diminished other new fantasy for me."
Malazan,3dmx13,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:42:30 2015 UTC,"Malazan is the basis of comparison for everything I read now.  Since reading MBotF, I've read: Wheel of Time, Kingkiller Chronicles, Mistborn, Stormlight, Dan Abnett's Gaunt's Ghosts series, Name of the Wind, Dresden Files, Dark Tower, Red Knight, and Evan Currie's ""On Silver Wings"" and ""Oddesy One"" series.  Surprisingly, Dan Abnett's Gaunt's Ghosts series is what I've found to be the most like Malazan from a ""Military Brotherhood"" and combat stance. I absolutely love it. The Red Knight was also pretty good, but not as good.  Other than Dresden Files, which keeps getting increasingly more and more intense, well written, and crazy every book, all the others just don't stack up.  I know a LOT of people recommend Black Company alongside Malazan, but I tried it for two books and really didn't like it.  I almost feel like I made a mistake reading Malazan as anything but the last series I ever read before I die. It spoils everything else that comes after."
Malazan,3dmx13,Jester814,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:33:22 2015 UTC,Try Prince of Nothing by Scott Bakker or Prince of Thorns by Mark Lawrence. They are much darker and more philosophical than the other non-Malazan stuff you have tried. Along with Malazan and Fire & Icem they are the top series in my 35 years of reading Fantasy.
Malazan,3dmx13,flaskhalses,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:56:08 2015 UTC,"Only on Reaper's Gail, but as much as I am loving Malazan, I find that there are other authors/series which do some things better. Patrick Rothfuss's prose is nearly indistinguishable from poetry much of the time, the writing itself is just that good. I think that Brandon Sanderson's worldbuilding is at a a similar level, but he does a better job of introducing his worlds in a timely manner. Many books are more character driven- though whether this is a strength or simply a difference is open to debate."
Malazan,3dmx13,LucidLunatic,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:44:41 2015 UTC,"Oh yes. The Malazan world is clearly as complex as no other. It makes everything so easy afterwards, though no less enjoyable.   A man carried a heavy anvil through the Holy Desert. When asked why he would do such a thing, he replied: ""If I should be beset by an Enkar'al, I could drop the anvil and run much faster.""

Malazan,3dmx13,SerLaron,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:09:35 2015 UTC,"I'd probably recommend Gene Wolfe, The Book of the New Sun will stick with you long after reading it cause he paints such a vivid picture in your mind.

Malazan,3dmx13,i_a1m_to_misbehave,0,Fri Jul 17 18:22:36 2015 UTC,"I still enjoy other series.  But for a few weeks after I read Malazan I admit, it was hard to read anything else.  That has happened to me a few times,  First it was after WOT,  then after Nights Dawn Trilogy.  Basically if it is well written and wide ranging in scope,  it generally takes a few weeks for me to extricate myself from that world."
Malazan,3dmx13,mockeryjones,0,Fri Jul 17 20:39:27 2015 UTC,"It's a damned hard act to follow, that's for sure.   Nothing else can compete in its arena; I spent months looking for anything that could, and was very disappointed.   However, I found the best approach was to work around the problem. Find other angles on fantasy, instead.   After finally completing TCG, I went and binge-read the entire Discworld, both as emotional rehab and as something that wasn't even on the same turf.   From there, I spent some extra time on fun, popcorn fantasy - things like Vlad Taltos.  After that, Mark Lawrence has been a godsend. Plenty grimdark, but with a personal rather than world-shattering narrative.   Nobody can beat Erikson at grand high drama and tragedy. Martin is a decent backing act, but that's about it. But there are plenty of areas where Erikson doesn't tread, or doesn't excel.   Tigana is still achingly beautiful. Mieville is still horrible. Moorcock is still weird. Pratchett is still funny, Butcher is still fun. Rothfuss is still damn good at prose.   What has been taken from me is save-the-world stuff. I just couldn't take Mistborn seriously, for instance. Everything in the 'will our hero save the day' genre has been thoroughly broken; it's as un-compelling as an Australian action-adventure movie."
Malazan,3dmx13,TheBananaKing,0,Sat Jul 18 01:46:19 2015 UTC,"I don't read anywhere near as much as I'd like to, but I still enjoy other series. It's important to enjoy other fantasy books for what they are, rather than for what they aren't. At this point I don't think I'll ever enjoy a series as much as I enjoy Malazan, but that's okay.   I do have trouble making it through series, though. I know it's an infamous example, but I couldn't make it through the Wheel of Time books despite my best efforts. Not because it felt so inferior to Malazan, but because everything that made me enjoy those books seemed to have disappeared after eight books. I read the seventh mostly on fumes, and 200 pages into the next book I couldn't maintain enough interest to continue. It's a shame, because I'd like to be able to say I've read the entire series, and there were some truly amazing parts, but it lost its charm when things just kept getting dragged out."
Malazan,3dmx13,ESGunslinger,0,Sat Jul 18 02:16:24 2015 UTC,I just switched to a different genre for a few books.  There was no way I was going to jump into another long fantasy series right away.

Malazan,3dnfbb,i_a1m_to_misbehave,3,Fri Jul 17 18:40:44 2015 UTC,"There is something else I'm a little foggy about, and it'd be great to get some verification.  So Caladan Brood is allied with Anomander Rake.  Is it at Rake's bidding that he is combating the Malazan Empire, or is this something he is heading on his own?  Also, Rake mentioned that he was affiliated with Brood eight hundred years ago.  Does that make them of equal power?  Maybe it's just that I haven't seen Brood in action, but I didn't get the same mysterious, commanding impression I got of Rake."
Malazan,3dnfbb,i_a1m_to_misbehave,9,Fri Jul 17 18:55:47 2015 UTC,"It's tricky to answer this without spoilers. It's not at Rake's bidding that Brood is fighting, exactly, as he'd likely be fighting anyway, but the fact that they're old allies likely encourages Brood's actions.  This second is also hard to answer; they're not equal, per se, or at least they're never in conflict and so one can't really say. Their power is also so different, but as leaders, they're both the powerful, commanding, withdrawn types who'd rather carry the weight of the world than share it. They're certainly kindred spirits. Memories of Ice ought to elaborate quite a bit more for you."
Malazan,3dnfbb,i_a1m_to_misbehave,3,Fri Jul 17 19:05:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the speedy and detailed reply.  For a series that's been finished for over four years, it's great how helpful this subreddit is to new readers."

The black ones are just Soletaken (shapeshifters) Tiste Andii; the red, Silanah, is more of Rake's companion and friend, similar to Brood."
Malazan,3dmonq,newuser234,11,Fri Jul 17 14:51:07 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't really understand this sort of question - you didn't like it, that's your own personal take from it, it's not like you are ""wrong"" or anything, it's just not your bag!  We won't be able to explain to you what we saw in it that you missed, you just weren't drawn in to it. Sometimes happens - I mean, it's why we have so many authors and genres out there!"
Malazan,3dmonq,Ordinary650,3,Fri Jul 17 15:36:28 2015 UTC,"I would suggest reading Memories of Ice. It is almost always in peoples top 3 books of the series.  It is one of the most epic and crazy books of the series, a roller coaster ride, and you really start to get the scale and scope of what Erikson is trying to do. It really looks at the larger scheme of things.  If it doesen't click with you by then, then it's probably not for you. No shame if it isn't! No series is for everybody.   I do have to say, anticlimatic is not a word I've heard in associated with the ending of Deadhouse. What was anticlimactic? What were you expecting vs what happened if I may ask? Were you moved at all?  Usually Deadhouse is just devastating to people. Serious questions, not criticizing!"
Malazan,3dmonq,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:58:21 2015 UTC,"To be honest, im not completely sure. i was just left with a unsatisfied feeling after reading it. i loved parts of it, it just seemed like several of the points of view went no where.  I will reread it before i start memories of ice, i suppose. I actually liked Gardens of the Moon, i just couldnt seem to get into Deadhouse Gates."
Malazan,3dmonq,TriscuitCracker,2,Fri Jul 17 15:04:22 2015 UTC,"Well, often times rereading Malazan is like reading a whole new book, you're able to connect the dots better and pick up what you missed. If you're a fast enough reader, great. I'm sorry it was unsatifying.   Memories of Ice returns to the characters of Genebakis btw."
Malazan,3dmonq,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:08:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies, i will go ahead and read Memories of Ice. I think the problem is that i took a while to read DG. i typically will read a book of that length in 2-4 days, but for whatever reason i didnt have as much time and it was spread out over about 2 weeks. That probably left me more confused than i would have been otherwise."
Malazan,3dmonq,lykideus,2,Fri Jul 17 15:21:19 2015 UTC,"That definitely could happen. There's so much in Erikson's books, if you stop for a bit, it's easy to lose focus and forget things. Erikson is best read when you have a few hours of uninterrupted reading time, or once the climaxes start happening, all nighters."
Malazan,3dmonq,wjbc,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:29:51 2015 UTC,"It's heresy around these parts to say that you didn't get into DG, but I was with you on my first go around. I actually stopped partway through it; I wasn't interested enough in any of the storylines to even finish the book. It took me a few more tries to get through it, but I finally did and moved onto MOI, and MOI was amazing."
Malazan,3dmonq,universal_straw,2,Fri Jul 17 16:11:33 2015 UTC,"The ten-book series is one very long novel, not independent novels.  So they end more like chapters than like novels, with a lot of loose ends.    But if you aren't into it three books in, you might not be into it.  I would say you gave it more than a fair shake."
Malazan,3dmonq,Djoric,2,Fri Jul 17 15:59:01 2015 UTC,It's not for everyone. Don't waste your time if you're not enjoying the series. There's too many unread books out there to waste your time on something you don't enjoy.
Malazan,3dmonq,Ryjacork,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:21:34 2015 UTC,"Bear in mind: Deadhouse Gates is essentially a separate plotline. Memories of Ice goes back to the fallout of Gardens of the Moon, and ties up the Genabackis plot nicely, which in turn allows room for the Seven Cities plot to develop later.  Deadhouse Gates isn't really a climax, it's an opening act that will more or less be concluded in Bonehunters, but even then, you must always remember - Erikson writes as a historian. History rarely has clean endings."
Malazan,3dmonq,JestaKilla,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:24:40 2015 UTC,If you didn't like Deadhouse Gates then the rest of the series will probably be wasted on you. Many consider it the best of the series.

By the end of the series there are plenty of new characters but a plethora of originals from Deadhouse Gates and Gardens of the Moon are in the thick of things. In fact alot of my favorite characters didn't even show up till book 5 or 6. I finished the series last week and I'm still coasting of the magnitude of the ending. Its 100% worth it to keep reading.

Malazan,3dm4hp,SKR47CH,9,Fri Jul 17 11:38:33 2015 UTC,It's not that the characters you know aren't there. It's that there's a lot more characters you haven't met yet.

Malazan,3dm4hp,Djoric,2,Fri Jul 17 16:02:46 2015 UTC,"The book of the fallen is essentially three separate series in one.

Masterpiece is the right word, glad to see you enjoyed it and that the emotional side didn't suffer too greatly.."
Malazan,3dkyk8,sillywillywillkilly,3,Fri Jul 17 03:48:32 2015 UTC,"After I read the last part of the Crippled God, the ""Remember Us"" part, I went back and read it again, outloud, slowly.  Musing on the long, wonderful journey Erikson had taken me on. All the wonder and terror and heartache and joy that I had experienced. All the ancient lands and races I had seen, all the gods and ascendants I had cowered from in their power, all the laughter I had gotten from Kruppe, Tehol and Pust, all the heartache....  Musing....  And then I opened Gardens of the Moon once more and began again."
Malazan,3dkyk8,TriscuitCracker,5,Fri Jul 17 05:51:01 2015 UTC,"So many amazing moments, Minala's and Quick going for Kalam, the woman seguleh in the omptose phelack Warren,  lostara screaming when she thinks he's gonna die, and when she slams her head 'pearl?'  But the battle of lightfall on the shores is like a dream thinking back on it, like it was so majestic and vivid sometimes I'll feel like I dreampt it and not read it cause I was reading so fast at that point trying to get to the end, and haven't reread yet. The whole convergence of the CG is one big blur... Like I remember feeling overwhelmed with the poignancy of Erikson at his best finishing the most epic story ever told."
Malazan,3dkyk8,BellamNom,2,Fri Jul 17 05:57:56 2015 UTC,You will have the reread forever.
Malazan,3dkyk8,itkovian,2,Fri Jul 17 12:42:50 2015 UTC,It's ... only the beginning.
Malazan,3dl1r4,nieud,3,Fri Jul 17 03:21:04 2015 UTC,"Glad you liked it!  Congratulations, you are halfway through! Brys and Tehol and Trull are amazing characters, it was so heartbreaking about Brys. I also loved the tragedy of poor Rhulad.   My fave part in that book is when Trull is searching for his brothers in the snow.  The last five books are definitely as good as the first. They all compliment one another nicely. Keep reading! My personal experience was fine with the last five. The only thing I can think of is that Erikson experiments with a new writing style with Toll the Hounds that some like, and some don't, and Dust of Dreams is really part one of The Crippled God so it doesn't really have an ending like the other books, so that is a difference."
Malazan,3dl1r4,TriscuitCracker,2,Fri Jul 17 05:58:03 2015 UTC,"I also really loved MT. The style evolves I'd say at MT and on, more poetic and polished prose, better with each book even though they're each completely different from the last. I think of the first 4 as an intro, then with MT it's like the whole time there's been a bigger game, but I think he wanted to set up a sense of nostalgia especially for Genabackis. I remember just looking at the cover for MoI with Gruntle and Stonny when I was on gardens and wanted to get there so bad, having no idea how good it actually is. TtH is that nostalgia, and it wouldn't be possible if Erikson wasn't as good as he'd become I think.  But the epicness of MoI and DG , no other author can pull that off.  Also, Udinaas is brilliant in MT, but you don't realize it yet. There's just a sense of grief and tragedy surrounding Letheras from the start to the end."
Malazan,3dl1r4,BellamNom,2,Fri Jul 17 05:18:51 2015 UTC,"If I had to say, I'd put Memories of Ice and Deadhouse Gates as my favourites, so it might be the case that the latter half isn't quite as good as the first.   That said, I'd put Reaper's Gale and The Crippled God as my third and fourth favourites, so it's not like the quality plummets."
Malazan,3dl1r4,Lankles,2,Fri Jul 17 06:02:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think The Bonehunters is my favourite book so far (I'm 2/3 the way through Reaper's Gale with this fast becoming one of the best in the series for me). If you enjoyed Midnight Tides, you're going to love RG!"
Malazan,3dl1r4,LayYourGhostsToRest,2,Fri Jul 17 08:51:53 2015 UTC,"You will learn to love the Bonehunters, because of the writing."
Malazan,3dl1r4,LegSpinner,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:01:33 2015 UTC,"It made me sad when Trull told him to never betray Rhulad, when it is clear that Udinaas is not loyal to his emperor, and would choose to leave given a good opportunity. However, I don't blame him in the slightest for his lack of loyalty to a nearly insane emperor.    We don't really know what Udinaas would have done if given a choice.  His loyalty was not the issue, because when he left, he didn't have a choice, he wasn't in control.   Unfortunately, the revelation that Bugg is Mael was spoiled for me ...   How?  I'm only on The Bonehunters, but I love it.  I'm on my second reading, and I wish I had kept track of all the quotes that left me in awe.  I may have to go back through and search for them!"
Malazan,3dl1r4,wjbc,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:06:24 2015 UTC,"Well, Udinaas' internal dialogue revealed that he didn't really care about Rhulad, or at least that's how I interpreted it. I accidentally read the spoiler in a thread that wasn't marked for spoilers. :/"

Malazan,3djmuy,andrewjackstoned,10,Thu Jul 16 20:22:15 2015 UTC,"I find when I'm in that state of mind and reading a malazan book, I get drawn inwards so deeply that I can't handle reading too much for too long haha. I mean, I get completely sucked into the story and forget where I am and (almost) who I am (that may be a slight exaggeration) - but it is a little eerie.   On topic though, I find it hard to fathom that our current data - stories, history, people - will survive a thousand years, or even be considered relevant. At the rate we are progressing in technology and amassing information, I think a lot of it will be lost amidst an ocean of overstimulation.  It could be that I've been affected by Steven's cynical take on the world though :P"

Malazan,3djmuy,Aiolus,4,Sat Jul 18 03:57:48 2015 UTC,"It's my favorite series so far.  However, to take a non serious comment serious, HP or GoT will be regarded super favorably. Too bad it can't more easily be adapted to TV or film. Also Homer had it easy, there was like one author ;-)."
Malazan,3djmuy,Aiolus,2,Thu Jul 16 23:24:45 2015 UTC,You're right those mainstream works are more likely to garner attention. A man can hope though. Maybe well get a Malazan movie in 2115.
Malazan,3djmuy,Aiolus,2,Fri Jul 17 00:33:24 2015 UTC,Once CGI is very very good and affordable it should be possible to make a solid Malazan series. I don't see a movie cause what could it possibly cover.
Malazan,3djmuy,wjbc,2,Fri Jul 17 03:49:24 2015 UTC,I'm not a big anime guy but sometimes when I'm reading a scene I can envision it perfectly in an anime. I think that's probably the best way to move Malazan to the screen.
Malazan,3djmuy,sillywillywillkilly,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:36:23 2015 UTC,It could be done as an anime. I'm a mainstream anime fan. Malazan as an anime could work but it wouldn't have the mass appeal of live action. As you said though it is probably the best way to get it on the screen and not ruin it.
Malazan,3djmuy,SKR47CH,2,Fri Jul 17 15:45:03 2015 UTC,"That's an apt comparison.  The gods are just as crazy, the story is just as complicated and fantastic and bloody and grim -- yet with comic relief from time to time.  There's poetry, there's sex, there are heroes and cowards and innocents and not-so-innocents, tricksters and, well, slower types.   Combine Homer's Iliad and Odyssey and Virgil's Aeneid and you even have the dawning of a new empire."

Malazan,3djgik,thegoatofharrenhall,9,Thu Jul 16 19:35:23 2015 UTC,"Reading is an extremely personal experience. The outcome of your reading can be enjoyed, hated, mused upon, discussed, expanded, and ridiculed, with others to your hearts content - but the act of reading, that actual moment in time, there is only The Story...and you. I can blather on about how much I love this series, how many times I've ridden the emotional roller coaster since starting this series, what effect it's had on me personally, but that's all about me. I can't convince you to do something you don't enjoy just because I do. I can understand the reasons why you want to continue, but if those reasons are not good enough for you, don't force yourself into something you don't enjoy. Maybe it's not the right time for you to read these books? Maybe the story has become too convoluted for your tastes? It sounds like you prefer to be attached to a group of characters and follow them through to the end of the story - I'm not saying that's a bad thing at all! But not all books are for everyone. And just because a set amount if people have an interest doesn't mean that you'll become a pariah and shunned for not.   I think for myself, I would have a tough time stopping a series on the second to last book, if only because there is no culmination to all that has gone before, without it. Plus, kittens.   Sorry I'm not much help :/ good luck on your quest to find something worthwhile in these books, I wish you all the luck!"
Malazan,3djgik,sillywillywillkilly,4,Thu Jul 16 20:06:50 2015 UTC,"Telling me to bear with it for the payoff isn't working anymore. If the only reason to continue is a TTH style payoff at the end of TCG then I won't bother. TTH had a great ending but in hindsight it was an awful book which I didn't enjoy and a good ending doesn't make a good book.  The style of the late (i.e. 7-9) novels has not been enjoyable compared to the early ones. If 9-10 are the same then I doubt I will enjoy the rest of the series.   I'll be honest with you. The style you're reading now (in DoD) continues. It doesn't really start to pick up until about half-way through tCG. I personally found BH and RG to be two of my favorite books, but really didn't care for DoD (or the first 80% of TtH). That said, I found the ending to be incredible.  I know you said you didn't want to slog through just for the ending, but I do think it's worth it. Perhaps you should take a break, read something else, and consider returning."
Malazan,3djgik,NoFortress,4,Thu Jul 16 20:45:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've grown a bit weary as well to be honest. The thing that gets me the most are the inner monologues and philosophical ramblings. He's just beating the same dead horse over and over again. Yes, the world is unfair, yes, the rulers seek power and control, yes, innocent people end up dying. You don't need to say this 50 fucking times though. That's the problem, I'm starting to roll my eyes at all this stuff. I feel like TTH was a sharp turning point for me. RG was awesome, definitely my favorite book of the series, but TTH was almost entirely pointless, short of the ending. DoD also felt pretty pointless for me.  Unfortunately, having just started TCG, I still find have no clue as to what the fuck is going on. I'm not sure if I'm enjoying it anymore, to be honest, but I'd feel like a fool if I don't finish TCG. And Erikson's obsession with not telling you what's going on feels absurd at this point. I've read 9 books already, around 10,000 pages. I still don't know about the damn plot!. I thought it would start unveiling in DoD, but nope, just more mysterious shit and cryptic dialogue. I open TCG and in the first few pages what do I get? Yep, mysterious shit and cryptic dialogue. I mean I know I'll unserstand it a few hundred pages in, but come on. It's book 10! Still new characters being introduced, still new storylines and there's still no clue as what's going on.  I'm just afraid that all this build up would lead to nothing. Just another 900 pages about the general unfairness of the world and the futility of living and 100 of the actual plot. The philosophical ramblings were used to merely add a spice in early books, but now they pretty much dominate. And he's just telling you the same thing over and over again."
Malazan,3djgik,abir_valg2718,5,Thu Jul 16 20:58:03 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, having just started TCG, I still find have no clue as to what the fuck is going on.   He beats you over the head with it for the past nine books. He even names his final book as the crux of the story. It should not be hard to put two and two together, considering that main theme of the series is compassion.  Books: 3,4,6 and 7 have major hints towards what endgame is going to be about, and what essentially is the whole purpose of the story."
Malazan,3djgik,mmSNAKE,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:57:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I suppose they're going to free the Crippled God or take away his pain shield anvil style or something along those lines. I admit to somewhat exaggerating my cluelessness. But still, I mean there are so many murky details and partially answered or unanswered questions or there are parts that I've missed/forgotten. Please don't spoil TCG though in case you or anyone else decide to answer.  Main series, except TCG  Main series, except TCG  Main series, except TCG  And I could probably triple or even quadruple that if I had the time."
Malazan,3djgik,abir_valg2718,2,Fri Jul 17 03:46:19 2015 UTC,"Most of these questions could be deduced. Some are directly answered in TCG. Some are red herrings. Some are not resolved and some get addressed later. Like K'rul. More on that in Forge of Darkness. Or Silverfox in ICE books.  Regarding TCG  That won't answer your questions but it should put you on the right track. Regarding most other questions a lot are already covered. It seems like you missed a great deal of information reading these books. For example Karsa. He has a appearance in TTH that is left on a cliffhanger. How would his story be finished? Also his story will continue after the series as well, there is a trilogy planed just for him."
Malazan,3djgik,mmSNAKE,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:03:06 2015 UTC,"Most of these questions could be deduced   Yes, I know that they were hinted at or somewhat answered in one way or the other. But here's my main problem: I'm a slow reader. It took me a year and a half to get to TCG.  With regards to spoiler'd paragraph: Main series, except TCG  Main series, except TCG  Damn, you see, this is why I like this series. It's just so rich and full of lore and history and stuff. But it's also so long and big and sometimes it feels like Steven is withholding information just to screw with you. I suppose if I could devour 1000+ pages in a week, I wouldn't be asking a lot of those questions. Of course, I could only imagine just how satisfying it would be to re-read the damn thing since I do recall tons of foreshadowing and ""mysterious dialogue"" that would make plenty of sense on a re-read. But I just can't, it's too big of a commitment. I know it's a silly comparison, but still, 11000+ pages of Malazan is ""worth"" about 28 400-page books. I just don't feel like I've read 20-someting books. Feels like 9. Again, it's a stupid comparison and certainly it's due to my individual quirks as a reader, but I just can't help but make it."
Malazan,3djgik,abir_valg2718,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:44:46 2015 UTC,Try looking at the problem from this point of view: Series.  You can look at it like such all the way back from Memories of Ice. It is just a matter of perspective and asking the correct questions. It also gives you insight into why Paran sanctioned the house.
Malazan,3djgik,mmSNAKE,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:09:36 2015 UTC,"That has been my view for quite a while now. Main series, except TCG"
Malazan,3djgik,abir_valg2718,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:25:48 2015 UTC,"Correct, now Series  There is something Shadowthrone figured out, something that Tavore as well figured out, as well as Ganoes. The motive behind most of what happened in the series, how events were steered towards the convergence in TCG. Obviously you still lack few pieces that are in the last book, but its easy to see when you take a top down approach to what is happening, and what essentially Shadowtrhone is trying to accomplish. You can figure it out from context, events as well as a lot of his philosophical remarks how he views society, civilization, order and gods.  There is a reason the series fares so well on re-reads. Because there are so many details, that are not feasible to catch first time through."

The rereads on tor can provide you with closure. If the tone feels preachy to you and you're soured on the writing and characters don't torture yourself.   For me the series kept on hitting and I devoured all books. The most notable issue was RG or MT, whenever it switches perspectives, but that soon became a favorite. I read all ten books pretty quickly and almost immediately reread them.   I doubt anyone will hate you for stopping. Some things aren't for some people. Just chime in on the books you love and on the books you don't (more sparingly ;) )   The only series I never finished is the Terry Goodkind one. Once I hated it (around book six) I noped out real quick.   I will say that I am on book five of WoT and even though I loathe the dialogue, descriptions and often times the writing I will finish it due to its prevalence in the fantasy world. I do enjoy the world and overarching story/lore."
Malazan,3djgik,sillywillywillkilly,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:00:04 2015 UTC,Thank you for your honest answers. I am going to take a long break and see where I am a year from now. I welcome any suggestions you have for something fresh to read of any Genre.
Malazan,3djgik,Aiolus,2,Fri Jul 17 06:33:52 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! With WoT I constantly take breaks because the actions and dialogue of some of the characters makes me physically ill and a bit angry lol.  Some recommendations (I only read fantasy with very little sci fi, Enders Game)   Joe Abercrombie - The First Law Trilogy, great series and turns some common tropes on their heads. Joe frequents reddit which I find cool Brian McClellan - The Powder Mage Trilogy, guns turn me off but this is set right at the advent of guns and the magic and characters are a lot of fun. Also frequents reddit.  C.S. Friedman - The Coldfire Trilogy, read this in my teens and it remains one of my favorite series of all time. Awesome world and unique magic. Multifaceted characters with an awesome anti hero. David Gemmel - Legend and Stones of Power, pretty much everything by him is awesome. L.E. Modesitt Jr. - The Saga of Recluse, this series for me ranks right up there with the best. The magic system is awesome and the characters are very real. It deal with a lot of the mundane so it may not be for everyone. It is ongoing and the most recent books aren't bad but don't hold a candle to the first like seven. Jim Butcher - Dresden Files (awesome even though it is in modern times) also Codex Alera is solid Michael J Sullivan - Riyria, another reddit guy. Good series. Raymond Feist - forget the name, I think it's Riftwar. Good series.   That's about all I've got off the top of my head, I recently read a lot of reddit authors so they're heavily represented on the list."
Malazan,3djgik,sillywillywillkilly,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:30:48 2015 UTC,"Can I throw Robyn Hobb into the mix here? She is a great author with a slightly off-kilter take on fantasy.  And I just want to add my support for Raymond E. Feist (Magician is a seriously good book) and David Gemmel - these are two top fantasy authors.  A rather more darker fantasy series (yet mind-bending all the same) is The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant by Stephen R. Donaldson. Stephen has done something here that no other author has done for me - made me view the main character with disgust and revulsion, yet continued to keep me enthralled."
Malazan,3djgik,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:59:19 2015 UTC,"I really should check out Hobb have heard great things.   I have also heard gokd things about Covenant but also that he is whiny and unbearable which would be tough for me, ie I cant stand Nynaeve (of WoT). I can't imagine reading about someone I loathe. Are the tertiary characters not horrendous? What carries the book if not the main character?"
Malazan,3djgik,wezzboy123,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:36:25 2015 UTC,"Oh no, Thomas Covenant carries the book 100%. He suffers from leprosy, is cynical and has huge self-esteem issues. And he gets thrown into this fantasy world (kinda along the lines of how the main characters stumble into Albion in ""A Song of Albion - Stephen Lawhead (also a great series)) already dealing with his own issues, and then gets a whole lot more thrown on him.  It's a very serious story, but I believe well worth the read."
Malazan,3djgik,grixa,2,Thu Jul 16 23:05:53 2015 UTC,I'm gonna give Thomas Covenant a shot. If the character isn't too cringey it should be fine.

Malazan,3djgik,TriscuitCracker,2,Fri Jul 17 03:50:41 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear this.  I won't lie. If you didn't like the series past The Bonehunters you will probably not enjoy the last two books very much. There's a lot of marching, and philosophyzing and inner monologues... And actually I also found myself disappointed that many characters I'd grown to love early in the series weren't part of it anymore. There were more characters I didn't care much about in the last part.  However, I still found the last books as appealing as the rest. I was really invested in the story and the world. And I liked Erikson's style a lot. I was eager and always looking forward to reading the most epic convergence of all time. And although the struggle to get there was hard it was absolutely worth it. There were so many moments that will stick with my for a very long time.  Don't know what to say to convince you, really. I think reading this series is a unique experience that becomes very personal and there isn't much one can say to encourage another to finish it. Just share our own feelings and experience.  Still, don't feel bad if you don't make it. There's no shame in that."
Malazan,3djgik,wjbc,2,Fri Jul 17 04:16:36 2015 UTC,"My major gripe with the series so far has been not just its morose dwelling on the depressing and its antisocial tendencies (which in themselves are not that great without being redeemed by the joys of liveliness) but this above all---its lack of philosophical depth and poetry... meaning your reason for not continuing is good reason for me to continue! Thank you!  ... and looking forward to dreaming of the epic's equally epic meta-sequel, the Commentaries on the Dream-Autobiographies of Kruppe."
Malazan,3djgik,BellamNom,2,Fri Jul 17 15:27:19 2015 UTC,"My opinion is that you may not fall in love with TCG. It is FAR less bloated than DoD is, but few things are very prevalent, and that is inclusion of philosophical thoughts throughout the book and not giving information directly, especially regarding some plot lines. Honestly to me the philosophical bits were the best parts of these books, because they thematically hit the spot, they make me think more than just ""I'm on a wild rollercoaster"". I get that you want to continue the plot, see what happens and not worry about soldier's existential crisis, or their view of morality, hope and compassion, however that was sort of the point with this series. If it doesn't suit your fancy, no shame in stopping.  There certainly is fat in the TTH and DoD but your reaction is rather adverse to what these books ultimately try to accomplish. I am surprised you made it this far.  Personally to me the second half of the series is far superior to the first five books."
Malazan,3djgik,Thyneown,4,Thu Jul 16 20:14:48 2015 UTC,"I'd stick with it, if nothing else, to see how it ends. Reserve your final judgement on the series as a whole. I for one, found Crippled God wonderful.  Yes, a few plotlines are not wrapped up neatly, and the philosophizing is there (but lessened in my opinion than DoD) but there are so many good moments and so many epic climaxes both between characters and armies that coming to the forefront after literally books of content, that I feel like you're cheating yourself if you don't finish.  Most of the book is multiple battles.  If you have never quit a series, I think it would be sad, as you posted, that Malazan is the one where you started.   Plus if you plan on hanging around this sub and posting and the like, you should read the whole thing so you can have a solid opinion!    And I find your honest criticisms very refreshing. I usually find that on this subreddit we can take the criticisms without taking it personally.  Lots of other fantasy subreddits just can't stand that kind of thing and aggressively attack people who say anything to the contrary.  Malazan is not perfect. Yes, TTH's ending is amazing but yes it's slow getting there for example. But the series as a whole for me personally makes up for individual book flaws or Erikson's writing style sometimes being unecessarily dense or dull.    I hope you continue, but I understand if you don't!  Thanks for posting."
Malazan,3dgdwe,mlbontbs87,17,Thu Jul 16 01:42:20 2015 UTC,Welcome. Just go with it. You may be very confused for a while. Just go with. Trust that it's awesome and will kinda make more sense as it goes on.
Malazan,3dgdwe,mgallowglas,13,Thu Jul 16 02:01:02 2015 UTC,"It is a book. With a story. Part of a larger universe. You will follow characters. Events. New discoveries will be made of yourself. Of the world - both our world and Steven's/Ian's. Emotions will be teased out of you. Sometimes torn. You will laugh with incredulousness. Your heart will ache in horror, sympathy, for what some of these characters go through. Experience an almost physical, palpable hate for others. Utter confusion will reign, only to be swept away with a sudden moment of eureka. To then have uncertainty creep in at the edges with your mind's next step. You will marvel at the grand vistas Steven paints before your mind's eye. But also at the smallest detail that sets the scene - the mood - so perfectly.   So nothing to be nervous about, it's all there for your enjoyment :)"
Malazan,3dgdwe,sillywillywillkilly,5,Thu Jul 16 04:36:36 2015 UTC,"Realize that GotM is the weakest book in the series and that you'll start to understand more and more the further you read.    And if you find yourself confused or are worried that you're missing important details (I certainly did), check out the Tor re-read of the fallen.  There is a summary of each chapter and commentary by two readers, one who is experiencing the series for the first time (Amanda) and the other who is doing a re-read (Bill).  After each chapter you read can check out the chapter summary and Amanda's take on things; you may want to avoid Bill's comments because they contain the odd spoiler.  And you'll definitely want to avoid the comment section, as spoilers abound.  Seriously, just keep reading, it's totally worth it (I'm about to start reading the 8th book, Toll the Hounds).  And be careful when poking around on this subreddit, because not everyone remembers to follow spoiler etiquette."
Malazan,3dgdwe,internet_enthusiast,4,Thu Jul 16 02:16:06 2015 UTC,"So, after re-reading the series, I actually do find GotM to be one of my favorite books from the series.

Definitely a different style from the rest, but not in a bad way imo."

I did have a character death spoiled for me shortly after I discovered this subreddit, but all in all if you pay attention to the titles of threads and avoid those that are obviously discussing books you haven't read yet, you'll be okay.

To give you a really, really basic example:  I'm a Mage with access to the ""Fire Warren"". I can cast Fireballs and make it rain fire. If I need to, I can open up the realm of fire and travel across it, rather than traveling across the ""normal world""   edit: I'd like to know why I'm being downvoted. This isn't a spoiler.

I loved the first one so I'm pretty excited that people are saying it's the weakest one and the series just keeps getting better.  Read the glossary before starting. Erickson tends not to stop to explain what things are, he just keeps on going. So you'll be wondering ""What the fuck is a Denul Warren and how is it different from a Thyr Warren?"" Also, get comfortable flipping back and forth between the page you're on, the glossary, maps and the dramatis personae. All very helpful reference material, and it's better than the internet where spoilers abound.  Sometimes you'll come across really vague descriptions of people, places or events that leave you questioning what happened and maybe a little frustrated at the vagueness. You'll get the answer, but where other authors might just spell it out for you, this author will put clues in other passages and trusts that the reader is smart enough to piece them all together. Again, Erickson doesn't like to explain things.   I think I had a third one but I forgot what it was. I'll edit it in if I think of it. Have fun reading!"

Malazan,3dfsnm,DownToJupiter,8,Wed Jul 15 22:49:19 2015 UTC,"K'rul convinces Envy to help him by showing her ""that, in striding through the warrens, we travel through your very flesh. That, when we draw upon the power of the warrens, we draw your very blood.""  Thus, Lady Envy owes him, and also needs to help him to preserve her own powers.  I don't know why you think this specifically relates to the rent and the Silanda, but you will learn more about them in other books.  Raraku is a desert, not a warren.  However, it is an ancient place that has seen many civilizations rise and fall, and it was not always a desert.  Although it is not a warren, it may have some kind of magic associated with it.  Raraku changed the Bridgeburners in part because they made it through a difficult desert journey, that alone turned them into a tight unit.  But Raraku is also considered a holy desert and may have changed them spiritually or magically in a way that is not clearly explained, at least not in MoI.  It ""etched the souls"" and ""burned our pasts away,"" whatever that means."
Malazan,3dfsnm,wjbc,6,Wed Jul 15 23:55:13 2015 UTC,"Actually, part of Rarakus power is that a particularly large fragment of Kurald Emurlahn is geographically fixed to the area. So, while the desert is not a warren in the literal sense, it does gain warren-esque properties. These get shown in HoC a fair bit and also might have possibly been related to the Bridgeburners ""change"", if it isn't just metaphorical."

More or less. When he takes down the fall he goes underwater and the book says he never took another breath. At the very end of the book people see a figure underwater at the bottom of the hole just there motionless, armored and sword in hand. I imagine he's now some kind of eternal guardian of the area or something. To be brought back if ever needed. Reaper's Gale. But that's all just speculation.   And was the Lady an elder god (Shrikmasil) using tCG fragment or was it just the fragment itself?   My understanding was that the Lady was the fragments of the TCG that had kind of taken on their persona. I haven't read Blood and Bone yet, but I know it picks up with Skinner who now has a fragment so there might be more detail on it there."

I've read both ASOIAF and Malazan and while I'm an ardent fan of both, I would put Erikson above GRRM. Erikson has the power to make to make me shed tears as a grown ass man. At the major deaths in ASOIAF I simply felt outraged, but in Malazan it was a  turmoil of emotions and I have only experienced that with Erikson till now. Anyway, all this is simply my opinion."
Malazan,3dd4i8,DidNatziThat,8,Wed Jul 15 09:53:06 2015 UTC,This. Loved both series but Erikson has made me cry and GRRM has not been able to.

Malazan,3dd4i8,WiskEnginear,3,Wed Jul 15 17:50:54 2015 UTC,"I read ASOIAF about 10 years ago (obviously keeping up to date with 5th book). Started malazan this year and if the payoff and tie ins as good as I'm expecting from what I have read so far (about 3/4 way through midnight tides) then this will be my hands down go to series.   The world building, the characters, (coltaine, Duiker, Felisin) are just beautiful. When they didn't tell Tavore what happened to her sister it was just tearing me apart. That arrow headed for Coltaine argh. The emotion is just there.   I just can't wait to finish this series and start again, some of the foreshadowing is amazing and I find myself wanting to reread books immediately after I finish them but I'm too hungry for the next chapter.

Malazan,3dd4i8,RuinEleint,5,Wed Jul 15 11:48:44 2015 UTC,"I never found it hard to sympathize with her, although she could be grating sometimes. She got dealt an awful hand (from the deck of dragons?) in life, and despite it all parts of her former self did still remain. That's another thing I liked that Erikson did; we saw her facing trauma, but it wasn't the sole defining aspect of her story. A lot of other stories will use rape as a plot device signifying this or that person to be bad without actually exploring its effects on the victims, or if it does it treats them as nothing but rape victims rather than people. Erikson avoided both of those pitfalls with Felisin."
Malazan,3dd4i8,karsa1987,6,Wed Jul 15 17:57:59 2015 UTC,"impressed but devastated  That pretty much sums up the entire series. Glad you liked it, I felt very sorry for Felisin as well.  The best thing I can say about Erikson is that he makes me care. Whether the emotion is devastating or elation or anything in between, any book that can actually make me care enough to feel an emotion is wonderful.   On to Midnight Tides! All new continent, only one recurring character. Don't be scared now. Keep reading! You're almost halfway there."
Malazan,3dd4i8,Alfons1983,2,Wed Jul 15 15:16:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Erikson finds a way to create a host of really sympathetic characters facing absolutely awful situations that is quite unique, I find. He avoids the nihilistic tendency to just make things stop mattering in the darkest moments, and instead makes them matter all the more, which really impressed me.  I think I can handle Midnight Tides. I made it through Gardens with no complaints, and there's no way I can leave this series unfinished now."

Malazan,3d7erq,TriscuitCracker,4,Tue Jul 14 04:05:40 2015 UTC,Worried about Gardens of the Moon is more of a /r/fantasy staple. Comparatively at least.
Malazan,3d7erq,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:06:51 2015 UTC,"I bet that's possible. I know /r/malazan is really good about spoilers but I try to only come around here for specific questions until I get through the series.  And then deliberately stay in that specific question thread.  For example, and this isn't a complaint or a condemnation, I read through the top posts yesterday before posting and saw something like ""Bugg, spoilers all"" -- so obviously Bugg is going to survive Midnight Tides.  So that's why I ended up rehashing the old topic, I'm paranoid about hanging out here.  Sorry 'bout that."
Malazan,3d7erq,SageOfTheWise,0,Tue Jul 14 12:22:58 2015 UTC,"Well, the reason 'Character Name (Spoilers All)' topics are allowed is because there's no actual indication they're talking about the characters actions (and therefore implied survival) at the end of the series. It's just as commonly used to mean ""here's a subject I want to talk about, and also I've finished the series so there's no reason to limit the conversation to a certain book"". I mean, lets put it this way, for all you know the ""Bugg (Spoilers All)"" topic just says ""So I've read all the books, and I still can't figure out who killed Bugg in book 5. Any ideas?""  There actually was a post awhile back of someone who had only started book two complaining they had been spoiled by a ""Felisin (Spoilers All)"" topic, because now they 'knew Felisin survived all the books.' Never could figure out how to tell that guy he interpreted it wrong without actually spoiling him."

I think it's more likely you don't typically want to discuss a character from book five at the end of book ten if they were only around for the one book - but it is absolutely conjecture on my part.  Like I said, I wasn't complaining and I'm not super bothered by it.  Strictly personal preference and certainly not any type of problem with the sub and how you guys handle spoilers.

That was one of my problems with the reads was keeping track of time, years pass and you have to figure it out by looking at dates, then randomly you get a crossover from a previous book and you know where you are in the time line.  You find some of the most beloved and complex characters in this book, you will not regret meeting Tehol, Bugg, or Trull. There are many many more characters I could list but you'll find your favorites and stick to them just like in the previous books.  Remember, Erickson LOVES convergence and everything does come together."

We get a couple of details - Shadowthrone was Dal Honese, and is said to have been short, with curly grey hair - but apart from that they're not exactly fully described. You can infer little bit, though.   Being a master of shadow dancing, it's likely that Cotillion was a citizen of the Seven Cities, as shadow dancing seems to be a ritual of the cults of Shadow native to that area. He's also tall, apparently, but that might be in relation to Shadowthrone's height. early DG  So, yeah. The only information you really get about those two are their skin colour and height. Shadowthrone is a small, ebony-skinned man with grey hair, and Cotillion is a taller, tanned-to-dark skinned man."

Malazan,3d2iip,adamanderrake,3,Tue Jul 14 03:28:17 2015 UTC,I'll have to check back.  But I think he's Kanese. I'm pretty sure it's in one of the ICE books. It would also make logistical and storyline sense. All the people who stayed in the Deadhouse before he started the empire were from Quon.  They all originate from some city-state on that continent. Also the first place they conquered/settled scores after obtaining Malaz Isle.

Malazan,3d2mdv,mortal_sword,11,Mon Jul 13 00:56:17 2015 UTC,"Jethiss is actually Spinnock. The Seerdomin was his friend, with whom he played Kef Tanar. Spinnock probably fell in battle at lightfall in TCG. We never see him again after he leads the TCG charge."
Malazan,3d2mdv,RuinEleint,2,Mon Jul 13 01:12:42 2015 UTC,Yeah I thought he could have been Spinnock but then I'm disappointed that it could be Spinnock cuz they never showed him dying?  What he says at the end contradicts Keddevis but tbh how is being Spinnock make him Son of Darkness?
Malazan,3d2mdv,Sappledip,6,Mon Jul 13 01:16:31 2015 UTC,"My take on this I posted on Malazan Empire (an unquestionably better grounds for discussing these books)  ""Reading through these comments it seems that most people are on board with Jethiss being Spinnock and thats my opinion as well. I think the battle in front of the ""gate"" was definitely the Liosan/Galain border fight, the friend's burrow was definitely seerdomin, and the title Son of Darkness is simply a title awarded by Mother Darkness to a Tiste Andii who she sees fit, as we read in Forge of Darkness (Anomander was simply the first Son of Darkness, Andarist the second and SIlchas Ruin the third).  I think the best arguments for these would be that although the ""terrible battle at the feet of the gate"" could depict Anomander's trip into Dragnipur, the tone of Jethiss in making that remark made it seem as though he had participated in the battle in some harrowing and gruesome way, where as Anomander simply showed up and ended the battle without actually taking part in the fighting. Another thing would be the absence of Spinnock at the end of the book where the remaining populace of tiste showed up for the final convergence in TCG. He was a character of note, and while other main tiste Andii were present (Korlat, Nimander, etc.) Spinnock was nowhere to be found.  The second point would be that although some could, at a stretch, say that Anomander could have considered Seer Domin a friend through the games Spinnock played with his tactic, it would be even more of a stretch to say that Anomander Rake, Mane of Chaos, First Son of Darkness' first thought upon rebirth would be to seek out the burrow of a man he had never personally met before. It was kind of a defining characteristic in the series that the only friend he had made in a very very long time was Whiskeyjack, who was undoubtedly interred into Moon's Spawn with the rest of the bridge burners that died in Coral.   Lastly, and what really makes it for me, is that Anomander Rake's death was so perfect and well written that I would hate the idea of SE or ICE spoiling it by bringing him back like this. It would seem like a cop-out to me, because Rake's storyline was my favorite in the series and had a sense of finality / completeness to it in its closing.  These are my thoughts, hope maybe they shed some light for people still on the fence.  Edit: Im pretty sure that it was said in Forge that Sons of Darkness were awarded powers by Mother Dark akin to sorcery, so that could explain how Spinnock who had not been a mage before, was now a bamf with serious magic skills"""
Malazan,3d2mdv,TocTheEternal,3,Mon Jul 13 05:08:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are correct that the title ""Son of Darkness"" had nothing to do with actually biology. Rake, Ruin, and Andarist were actual brothers, but they were chosen Sons of Mother Dark, granted the title and powers later in their life, not created by her.   Also, Spinnock is listed among those who fell during the battle against the Liosan in TCG. I think it is Korlat that has a line listing him among the dead."
Malazan,3d2mdv,adamanderrake,2,Mon Jul 13 15:07:42 2015 UTC,When I read it I definitely got the impression it was Rake. His build was nothing like Spinnocks' and everything alluded to it being Rake. I think the though of it being Spinnock is people just don't want to see Rake brouhgt back into the storyline like that
Malazan,3d2mdv,Sappledip,-5,Tue Jul 14 02:00:33 2015 UTC,"Haven't read FoD. Guess that makes sense, whatever. I thought maybe Spin but its stupid to me that they would make such a bid deal of a mysterious returned character... when Spin wasn't even mentioned as gone, who knows as far as his absence maybe he ate a bad burito? Couldn't make to help CG. Bah whatever that's just bad writing but I accept it."
Malazan,3d2mdv,PhilosopherIshamael,3,Mon Jul 13 05:12:19 2015 UTC,"Im with you on that, ICE's writing is so sub par compared to SE. Its for that reason Im glad it was spinnock and not Anomander; if he had butchered my favorite character I would have had to seek out some kind of retribution"
Malazan,3d2mdv,RuinEleint,-2,Mon Jul 13 05:14:59 2015 UTC,"I don't really lay the blame at ICEs feet entirely, I mean you'd think SE and ICE would discuss shared characters but no. And ICE has gotten pretty good I think, his writing improved as the books went on. I blame both of them, they should have thought this through... and I also liked Spin y'know. I was disappointed with him becoming Jethiss, why? Why die off screen, not have his ancient buds, not be with his new human love... now Spin doesn't get to rest. Sigh, it was supposed to be his last damn stand. I mean he's going back but what a load of bs. I thought the ending of back in Kharkanas gut his human gf was good enough but nah now he uses his arm as a sword cuz why not!"
Malazan,3d2mdv,RuinEleint,-1,Mon Jul 13 05:28:22 2015 UTC,How do people think it's Spinnock? I always assumed it was Anomander reborn.  He even dissolved himself into Darkness and then was reconstituted.
Malazan,3d2mdv,adamanderrake,6,Mon Jul 13 01:34:35 2015 UTC,"Thats one of the reasons. Rake didn't just die, his soul, his very essence was disintegrated as a sacrifice to reopen Kurald Galain and get the attention of Mother Dark. Kind of hard to come back from that. The Kef Tanar bits put it squarely on SPinnock."
Malazan,3d2mdv,TocTheEternal,-1,Mon Jul 13 01:40:11 2015 UTC,"People think its Spinnock because he mentions a great battle at a gate (lightfall), he's great with a sword, has to make a 'stand' again. MD was active near Kharkanas. The only problem is he didn't die on screen or off screen. It might not be Rake because he mentions how he played the Kef Tanar with his dead friend Seerdomin. So it points to him being Spinnock.... I for one am skeptical because he didn't die on screen, my best bet is still Kadspala."
Malazan,3d2mdv,TocTheEternal,3,Mon Jul 13 01:41:54 2015 UTC,Kedeviss was one of Nimanders companions right? How does he fit? Do you mean Kadaspala? He fits even less.  There a couple of threads in the Assail subforum in the Malazan Empire site which discuss this issue in detail
Malazan,3d2mdv,TocTheEternal,0,Mon Jul 13 01:44:59 2015 UTC,"Whoops I meant Kadspala thanks. And the problem with Jethiss is the more that happens the less likely he is to be someone else. Well he uses magic, Spinnock never used magic. I go for Kadspala he did some weird tattoo god making magic so... then again his closing comments are pure Spinnock but Spin was never said to be dead so.... I go for Kadspala because magic, he's a blank slate, he's dead, was there at Gate, would get honorary son of Darkness title. ( Also hahahaa might be Orfantal the boring useless chump.)"
Malazan,3d2mdv,adamanderrake,2,Mon Jul 13 02:04:38 2015 UTC,Kadaspala was a painter not a warrior or mage. It's definitely not him.
Malazan,3d2mdv,NegativeChirality,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:01:49 2015 UTC,He did die. He's mentioned by Korlat among the list of the dead in TCG.   There's basically no question that Jethiss is Spinnock. It is certainly not Kadaspala.

We all can assure you, the re-read is as good as, If not better because you put together so many more connections and foreshadowing. Plenty of ""Oooooh"" and ""Ah-HAH!"" moments in your future!  Before you do, you may want to read Esselmonts 6 books for lots of backstory and side stories about things only mentioned in the main series. Or read them in their chronological order interspersed with the main series during your re-read. Lots of things to learn about, Spoiler and much more!  Esselmonts next book ""Dancers Lament"" is hopefully about Dancer and Kellenvads merry adventures after they enter the Deadhouse.   Also don't forget Forge of Darkness, it's set thousands of years in the past and involves our favorite Son of Darkness and many more familiar Elders in their heyday. Part one of the upcoming trilogy. Erikson is also going to write a Karsa trilogy but that's several years down the road.   Also the Bauchelin and Korbal Broach novellas are great for a grisly laugh.   Basically there is no shortage of getting your Malazan fix. Other fantasy may seem off or not as satisfying for a while.  Any favorite parts or criticisms of Crippled God? Or the series as a whole? Glad you enjoyed it!"
Malazan,3d158p,TriscuitCracker,8,Sun Jul 12 17:50:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll have to read all those ICE books even though I've heard the writing isn't the same.   I wish there was more of Karsa, but if he's getting his own trilogy that is great! Icarium and mappo- what the fuck! Ugh. So many heart wretching moments. I'm grateful about how it ended for Onos T'oolan though."
Malazan,3d158p,number7,3,Sun Jul 12 18:45:03 2015 UTC,"I would say Forge of Darkness will give you ten times the backstory than the ICE novels do.  Personally thought a book revolving around the Tiste would be kind of boring, but it's basically about how the world got to be the way it was at the start of the novels."
Malazan,3d158p,TriscuitCracker,2,Sun Jul 12 20:36:15 2015 UTC,"He is not as good as Erikson, but a perfectly competent writer. Less philosophizing than Erikson. Definitely worth reading."
Malazan,3d158p,wjbc,15,Mon Jul 13 15:17:53 2015 UTC,"I have the urge to read Gardens of the Moon again and Deadhouse gates and basically everything over for details I might have missed the first time around.   Do it, you won't regret it."
Malazan,3d158p,Morghus,6,Mon Jul 13 16:26:41 2015 UTC,"I'm currently on a re-read, so that's entirely out of topic, so I just want to say that you're entirely right about what you're saying; I'm hesitant about starting The Bonehunters, because this is the one series that actually makes me feel. It's made me cry, laugh out loud, and everything in between. So yeah, I dread the enjoyment I will get out of continuing it.   Also, absolutely, try the Esslemont series. He'll grow on you. He's not a major literatant, literature producer, prose-manufacturer...? Many words. He has a story to tell, and I enjoy his stories. He tries really hard, and it shows. I like his story-telling, and his progression as a story-teller."
Malazan,3d158p,TheBananaKing,3,Sun Jul 12 18:41:15 2015 UTC,"There just isn't anything to say at the end, is there?"
Malazan,3d158p,ToTheUninitiated,2,Mon Jul 13 00:33:38 2015 UTC,"Bravo, congrats! I felt the same way, but you just can't explain it to other people (friends, family, coworkers etc.) even if they are ""readers"" it's impossible to express how meaningful and epic it really is.   Since reading it, I tried other books but I was always chasing the dragon, so to speak :)  So now I'm on my second read through (on Toll the Hounds). It's great on the 2nd read because you catch so much more stuff that was overlooked the first time. Plus I'm taking notes & writing down some of the more brilliant passages & prose. Absolutely love it.   Edit: we should all get broken glass face tattoos so we can identify all the other badasses that have finished the series. Witness!"
Malazan,3d158p,xolotl92,2,Mon Jul 13 01:49:43 2015 UTC,"Before you reread, I would say check out the other books in the world.  The ICE books give you great peaks into what was going on in other parts of the world while the main story was going on.  While his writing isn't as good as Erickson, it gets better with every book and is very entertaining on its own.  Then, you have Forge of Darkness which lets you see were Rake, Draconus and a slew of other Ancients came from.  Lastly, some Bauchelain and Korbal Broach stories cause you need some light hearted necromancy before jumping back into you reread.    I just finished my first reread of the main story and am on FoD now, it is as emotional and entertaining the second time around, just so you know."
Malazan,3d158p,chodan9,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:13:00 2015 UTC,I just downloaded it and am finishing up another book before I dig into the crippled god.  I'm a little nervous :-)

Me, I wouldn't want to wait that long for the ending, and I promise you it's going to be enjoyable either way. However if you feel the need to do it then go ahead."
Malazan,3d0n6x,universal_straw,3,Sun Jul 12 14:59:28 2015 UTC,"I have been rereading every book before moving onto the next, and I love the reread.  Erikson is constantly making references only someone who has read ahead could possibly understand.  It's a joy to reread the books.    It's not necessary because anything important will come up again, so you could probably pick up where you left off and everything important would be explained.  Or you could read the Wikipedia summaries and look up anything confusing on the internet.    But it's such a pleasure to reread the books that I highly recommend it.  And when I'm done with the entire series I plan another reread."
Malazan,3d0n6x,wjbc,2,Sun Jul 12 16:52:48 2015 UTC,"You've mentioned you've read each book twice a few times, I was just wondering, do you read very fast or do you happen to have a job that allows you to read a lot in spare time? Kudos for you that, it must be a great experience."
Malazan,3d0n6x,TriscuitCracker,2,Sun Jul 12 17:34:07 2015 UTC,"I read fast and I take my Kindle everywhere.  I commute on the train, that helps."
Malazan,3d0n6x,wjbc,2,Sun Jul 12 17:38:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Checking out the summaries sounds like a good compromise, not sure I could actually commit to rereading without finishing it first."
Malazan,3d0n6x,TriscuitCracker,2,Sun Jul 12 23:52:33 2015 UTC,"You could do that, it would certainly help your understanding, but you may lose your momentum, especially once you read the end of Toll the Hounds and you may feel you NEED to finish!   I would do the next best thing and hit up the Tor Re-Read of the Fallen chapter summaries and analysis in the sidebar. They are excellent and really helped me when I got a little lost or couldn't keep everything straight.   You're almost there! Congratulations on making it this far."
Malazan,3d0n6x,JestaKilla,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:29:46 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, reading a detailed summary sounds like a good idea. It's taken me a while to get this far so rereading it all now, without the pay-off of the ending, is a bit hard to commit to."
Malazan,3d0n6x,itkovian,2,Sun Jul 12 23:48:29 2015 UTC,"When I first started the MBotF, Bonehunters had just come out. By the time the Crippled God came out, I'd re-read the earlier books at least once each (excepting DG, since I loaned it out and it came back missing the last like 30 pages or something). So yeah, it may enhance your enjoyment. But ultimately, I have found that re-reading after finishing the series gives me more and huger insights into everything."
Malazan,3d0n6x,SKR47CH,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:36:18 2015 UTC,"I deliberately found a series that was already finished after the torture of A Song of Ice and Fire... I can't handle the waiting!

Malazan,3cxxoi,TriscuitCracker,5,Sun Jul 12 00:27:26 2015 UTC,He does get way better as the books progress. I was not disappointed with the action scenes in the ICE novels even though the deeper aspects from the SE novels were not there.

Malazan,3cxxoi,ImaginaryHearts,3,Sun Jul 12 08:20:36 2015 UTC,"I've tried to look at the ICE books as if I am reading about Malazan from a different historian (ala Thucydides who made up speeches and dialogue for his histories).  This way, even if a character doesn't seem to be written in a way to capture how SE wrote him/her, I can still imagine the ""true"" character as interpreted by this 'historian'."
Malazan,3cxxoi,OvidNaso,2,Sun Jul 12 16:48:40 2015 UTC,Is it possible to read OST before ICE's other books? I'm on DoD now and I'd love to see more of the Darujhistan crew and some insight into the Seguleh.
Malazan,3cxxoi,DreamlordOneiron,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:03:51 2015 UTC,"No. OST takes place after the events of TCG, and there's lots of spoilery information in there. Be patient, you'll get there."

Malazan,3cxkem,neokami,16,Sat Jul 11 17:55:31 2015 UTC,"The religion of Shadow existed way before Kellenved took the throne. The religion didn't always worship him, it just worshiped Shadow in general, with no specific god involved."
Malazan,3cxkem,SageOfTheWise,6,Sat Jul 11 18:17:24 2015 UTC,"So my question is, how does High House Shadow have an organized religion that has obviously existed for quite some time?   It was inaccessible, but that doesn't mean no one knew it existed.  Just as there were cults of light and darkness, so too shadow.  The religion existed, and even seemed to have developed some measure of power aspected to Rashan."

That said all three aspects had religions dedicated to them, people worshipped though the offshoot warrens like Rashan, Meanas, and Telas/Tellan.

Malazan,3cxkem,Dwolf63,2,Sun Jul 12 02:25:33 2015 UTC,"Mild spoilers below, but I will try to dance around them a bit. This is something you are not really supposed to know at this point, because the series hasn't really touched upon the Tiste Edur or history of Kurald Emurlahn (the Elder warren of Shadow). There are other non-Elder warrens that humans have access to which are also aspected to Shadow. The Hounds originate from the Elder warren of Kurald Emurlahn, not from one of the human accessible Shadow warrens."
Malazan,3cxkem,Cryophile,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:56:32 2015 UTC,"Yea, I'm part way into book two and reading a little too fast. This definitely bothered me.

They've said the hounds are creatures that have lived for thousands of years so I wonder if they originated from another warren? Hopefully that's explained later."

Malazan,3csrt3,shekkie,15,Fri Jul 10 14:01:54 2015 UTC,"Bugg/Mael can't do anything to Mallick Rel.  Mallick Rel is a high priest, and it's been said in the series a couple times, the Priests and worshippers impart control on their God.  He has to obey them when they call and how they worship.  This is why a lot of Ascendants don't want to be worshipped.  You gain more power as a God, but you lose your complete freedom."
Malazan,3csrt3,sonofa2,10,Fri Jul 10 14:18:21 2015 UTC,"This. Remember, Mael isn't necessarily a nice god. He's an Elder God, which means he gains power from blood.He may have changed somewhat after being Tehol's manservant, but that bloodthristy aspect  is still a part of him, and as long as it's being worshipped by people like Mallick Rel, there's not much he can do."
Malazan,3csrt3,SiroccoSC,2,Fri Jul 10 14:26:26 2015 UTC,"This part I get I think. Bugg/Mael has the ability to separate part of himself from his daily life as Bugg in an almost split personality? Bugg is a somewhat humble and compassionate man with a mortal best friend. Mael is still and elder God, with a bloodthirst that when sated allows him more power and it seems, his mind is more of that of a elder god in that role."
Malazan,3csrt3,sonofa2,9,Fri Jul 10 14:44:49 2015 UTC,"Bugg is Mael.  He hasn't split into multiple personifications like Dassem.  Since Mael is an Azathani, he is in a whole other level of godhood.  Mael took on the role of Bugg and stopped doing Mael things because he didn't like that side of himself. Tehol showed him the lighter side of life, and hence why he sticks around being Bugg doing silly things with Tehol, instead of ruling the seas."
Malazan,3csrt3,DAMCARDLE,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:57:56 2015 UTC,"Right, I meant more that the two happenings aren't exclusive in their timing. Bugg can and does appear as Bugg in Letheras while at other times meeting with the Errant and Kilmandaros in the capacity of Mael. So he is actively living two personalities to some extent."
Malazan,3csrt3,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:06:41 2015 UTC,"Not so much living two separate personalities rather than just showing disdain for the Errant and being nicer around Tehol, im sure how you act around friends is far different than around people you don't like. He is as much Mael when he is with Tehol as he is with the Errant, just handles himself differently."
Malazan,3csrt3,TriscuitCracker,6,Sat Jul 11 09:58:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's a scene in RotCG where Mallick basically forces Mael to help him. They exchange unpleasantries and everything."

Malazan,3csrt3,greater_golem,9,Fri Jul 10 14:37:11 2015 UTC,"They kind of stopped worshipping her.  It was a punishment. They were all corrupt and turned to the Crippled God for the power of blood instead of worshipping her.  This was said in ""The Bonehunters."""
Malazan,3csrt3,titanemesis,2,Fri Jul 10 14:41:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah. It's really a question of how far are you willing to go. Destroying your power base destroys your power. The Errant calls Mael out on it in DoD or TCG. How Mael seems perfectly content with this far away worshipper taking over an empire, out of sight out of mind.   D'rek was put in a ""it's you or me"" situation by his/her/it's priests. Mallick isn't that stupid, to put it bluntly. Obviously its a grey area of morality for Bugg."
Malazan,3csrt3,titanemesis,5,Fri Jul 10 14:44:51 2015 UTC,"Mael, unlike the Errant, is still worshipped outside Lether, as evidenced by Mallick Rel. That grants him considerably more power than the Errant.   As for morals... He probably can't hear everyone doing things in his name every day (and the Letheri time lock thing might also cause issues), while what happened to Tehol happened right in front of him. And Tehol is probably one of his best friends. So, yeah, he lost the run of himself.   In summary, I think that's why the Errant has to nudge, while Mael can just wade in: Mael has more power,which lets him act more freely."
Malazan,3csrt3,Circle-Breaker,4,Fri Jul 10 14:15:26 2015 UTC,"This is a bit of a RAFO point, although I'm pretty sure there's been some subtle clues so far.   If you want to know now (though I'm still pretty vague):  Mild thematic spoilers for the whole series"
Malazan,3csrt3,Garph,2,Fri Jul 10 15:00:12 2015 UTC,"This makes a good, non spoiler point. Thanks."
Malazan,3csrt3,Sonofkyuss666,4,Fri Jul 10 15:08:56 2015 UTC,"A couple of things:  Blood Magic - Mallick Rel is a Jhistal priest, which seems to imply blood-magic. Throughout the series, you'll find that blood magic is powerful and very compelling. It's one of the most direct means of influence worshippers inflict upon their respective gods. It's actually more transactional than anything. So anyway, the point is: Mael didn't really have a choice.  Mael's indifference to suffering: The Malazan series is very much about how 'good' and 'evil' are tricky things to attribute to any people or culture, and how very few of the villains are out-and-out evil. Agreed, Rel is a particulalry huge fuckhead, but still. Mael's choice to basically dick around being Tehol's manservant is a consequence of two things: first - that Mael is tired of the constant, endless squabbling and fuckery between the mortal races, and chooses to leave them to their own devices. Second, he finds Tehol fascinating precisely because he is so very unlike his fellow mortals, and is the first entertaining thing to come along in eons. Mael genuinely cares for him, and will thus protect him unconditionally.  Mael is not immoral, but rather disillusioned with mortal affairs. He's been around a long time, so for him all mortals have failings and no one seems truly innocent. He feels that there is no fair way to intervene on moral grounds, since eventually all mortals end up being the same kind of oppressors, and committing the same atrocities. Intervening for personal reasons (e.g. Tehol is his friend) is a far more genuine, and worthwhile motivation for him."
Malazan,3crmot,BobFromMarketing,6,Fri Jul 10 05:33:12 2015 UTC,"Oh damn. I had forgotten I have this coming up soon.  The Bridgeburners, The Bonehunters, hell the Malazan army in general, such emotion attached to them.   It's funny how there are beings in these stories that have some amazing powers and great skills and awesome humour, but damned if I'm going to root for anyone but the Malazan soldiers and marines."

Malazan,3crmot,Kheshire,3,Fri Jul 10 08:24:35 2015 UTC,"The whole engagement was pretty epic. So much chaos breaking out, Quick Ben unleashing real power, Ruthan Gudd pulling out Stormrider magic, then Lostara.  Lostara going full shadow dancer mode was pretty much perfect."
Malazan,3crmot,sonofa2,2,Fri Jul 10 14:13:45 2015 UTC,"The ending of DoD may be my favorite part of the series.  So many great moments:  “That, soldiers, was Quick Ben.”  “Hail the Marines.”  “Blood of the gods, what manner of soldiers are you?”"

Malazan,3cpcfg,mhardegree,2,Thu Jul 9 18:25:31 2015 UTC,It's ok. I get them mixed up too.
Malazan,3cpcfg,DrinkyDrank,8,Fri Jul 10 08:21:16 2015 UTC,"I haven't been able to get anyone else in my life to crack into the series, so I would probably go completely insane without this sub."
Malazan,3cpcfg,ocher_knight,4,Thu Jul 9 21:39:13 2015 UTC,"Same here. My friend got me into ASoIaF, and I dutifully plowed through those books so he and I could discuss theories and the like. I've been trying for the past several months to sell him on Malazan (""It's like GoT, except magic is everywhere"" is what I usually say), but the most I get is a halfhearted ""Oh, that sounds cool."" It's like, dude, at least this series is finished.  He finally picked up GotM a couple of weeks ago, but to my knowledge he hasn't cracked it open yet."
Malazan,3cpcfg,DrinkyDrank,6,Thu Jul 9 21:48:18 2015 UTC,"I never even try to compare it to ASoIaF, it just makes people disappointed when it doesn't feel like watching HBO and actually makes them think."
Malazan,3cpcfg,internet_enthusiast,3,Thu Jul 9 22:00:39 2015 UTC,"It bothers me when people conflate the show GoT with the book series ASoIaF.  They aren't the same.  The HBO series started off as a dumbed down version of the books with a bunch of gratuitous nudity, and the most recent season changed so many plot points I don't think you can really consider them to be the same story anymore.    I'd argue that MBotF doesn't ""make you think"" any more than ASoIaF does."
Malazan,3cpcfg,future_forward,7,Fri Jul 10 00:16:10 2015 UTC,Hmm disagree. Malazan devotes an equal amount of words to philosophy as ASOIAF does to describing food.   It's a fantasy story that speaks volumes to what it is to be human. I don't think ASOIAF comes close to the emotional and intellectual potency at play here.
Malazan,3cpcfg,ocher_knight,5,Fri Jul 10 00:40:08 2015 UTC,"What ASoIaF does that I love is give a clear picture into the minds of the characters. Tropes like the unreliable narrator are used to great effect, and you always have a sense of the character's motivation and thought process. You get some of that with Malazan, but often it seems like the characters keep most of their emotions and knowledge hidden from others and even the reader.  That being said, I consider Malazan to be a far superior series, not only better written, but truly thought-provoking in the themes it explores."
Malazan,3cpcfg,Mahdimuh,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:01:00 2015 UTC,"In that regard, I'd consider Malazan closer to real life experience. Malazan transcends storytelling in that way. It's why it feels alive."
Malazan,3cpcfg,SirStumpyMcFry,3,Sat Jul 11 15:47:36 2015 UTC,"Interesting, while I don't disagree with you I would caveat this by saying that the defining difference is that MBotF invites and entices the reader to think where as ASoIaF does not. With ASoIaF you have to make the choice to actively do so."
Malazan,3cpcfg,LegSpinner,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:04:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with you. I had a discussion with a friend about this and we came to the conclusion that ASOIAF is a saga, something like a soap opera but with more incest and gore. MBOTF is more an epic, with a focus on world-building and where quests and campaigns have a more overarching effect.   The Lord of the Rings trilogy, in my mind, is more an epic than a saga, and though it's very black-and-white and less complex than MBOTF, I use it for comparison."
Malazan,3cpcfg,SirStumpyMcFry,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:02:29 2015 UTC,"The thing I have found is that one of the things that attracts so many people to GoT is the ""lack"" of magic in the setting.  I went through this with a friend and in the end I told him that it was amazing because it is one book broken into 10 parts set in a post modern world with fantastical elements. I've found that if the person has any interest at all it is enough to get them to ask a follow up question even if that question is ""what does that mean""."
Malazan,3cpcfg,sillywillywillkilly,5,Fri Jul 10 01:11:38 2015 UTC,"Same here - I'm trying to get people interested, but if you have to push it, they generally get turned off :(.

He's just such a horrible person, who succeeds because other people are horrible and self serving, and it's so out of place in a series where compassion and kindness is such a lauded trait.

Malazan,3cqodc,sillywillywillkilly,7,Fri Jul 10 06:53:55 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it's not exactly like the books are all in chronological order...  But I see your, uhh (no vulgar intentions), point."
Malazan,3cqodc,KevDrinksCorona,2,Fri Jul 10 04:07:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Luckily it wasn't a spoiler to me, but the thread titled 'Question about [Character that dies in MBotF] in [ICE Book]' is a good example."
Malazan,3cqrjn,B-more_freshout,19,Fri Jul 10 00:49:19 2015 UTC,"Read the from the first book.  The books are involved sure, there is a lot of information, but they are not as complicated or hard to grasp as some may make it seem.  As long as your reading comprehension is not poor you should have no problems.   It isn't necessarily that these books are complicated it is how information is given to you. It is usually indirectly. A lot of has to be figured out from context and clues. Which you shouldn't have much problems with.  Will you get everything? I honestly doubt that. I doubt anyone did. It is why the books fare well on re-reads. But your first time through just read normally and you will have all the info needed to sort everything important. If you miss something or are unclear on it just ask."
Malazan,3cqrjn,mmSNAKE,3,Fri Jul 10 01:43:04 2015 UTC,"I agree.  The thing most people seem to have trouble with is to simply accept things are as they are at the time you read them.  It will all be clear eventually, so don't worry if you don't understand something right away."
Malazan,3cqrjn,Montaron87,7,Fri Jul 10 12:21:47 2015 UTC,"The information is not spoonfed. You have to be attentive, and you to have to have a good memory. Its also a good idea to be connected to an experienced and knowledgeable community like here or the Malazan Empire forums.

Malazan,3cqrjn,RuinEleint,4,Fri Jul 10 02:56:00 2015 UTC,You cannot go wrong reading this series. Even long after you finish it the characters will still be with you. Yes it is a complicated read but you are going to want to read it more than once anyways. The ending is spectacular. Definitely read them how they were released. But seriously....start reading....now!
Malazan,3cqrjn,kelsmnstr,6,Fri Jul 10 01:32:56 2015 UTC,"The Malazan: Book of the Fallen is a wonderful series.  Absolutely worth reading. It's not for the faint of heart and the books are not your typical light fantasy type. It's got a cast of hundreds, tons of plotlines, world building galore and it will make you laugh, cry, and cheer. Each book has an overall plot that contributes to the series as a whole, as you read them you connect all the dots and see the big picture the author is trying to achieve.  Since you haven't read any fantasy besides ASoIaF it may be a bit jarring, you won't know any of the typical fantasy tropes or experiences.  I would definitely read the main series in publication order. Do not skip the first book.   It is one of the pinnacles of epic literature fantasy in my opinion. Erikson's writing style can be intimidating and hard to get into at first. You feel like you got dropped into a foreign country with no understanding of the language, customs, and who are all these people?! This is normal! Give it two or three books until you get used to Erikson's style. Personally it didn't click for me until near the end of book 1.   Remember the glossary at the back of the book and the dramatis personae are your friends. There is literally a cast of hundreds between all the books.  Erikson tends to not do info-dumps and can be heavy on the introspective philosophy. The first half of each book is usually character building, plot, history, etc, and the last quarter are when the epic craziness starts and next thing you know it's 4am in the morning and you have to work at 7am but you can't stop now. He wrote the first book 9 years before the second and it shows a bit, but he is an archeologist and an anthropologist so his world building skills are second to none. Every place a character visit feels ancient, every race you come across has an entire history to it, every millennia-old ascendant (powerful being) has several lifetimes of stories to tell.  You have to piece together the overall arching plot and other things, like how the magic system of warrens works, from clues and context of various characters and what you experience through the characters. It's all part of the fun, seeing how all this will fit together and where it's going. You go back and forth between continents and characters and the overall arching plot of the series only really becomes clear after book 5-6 and you and you get an astounding sense of the audacity and craziness and the scale and scope of what Erikson is trying to accomplish.  It's an amazing, wonderful, crying into the books, epic ride. It's even better on a re-read in its own way. Of course, no series is for everybody, so if you don't like it, at least give it through book 2 or 3, but no shame if it's not for you. If you decide to read it I hope you enjoy it!  If you have any questions about getting into the series post them here, we love impressions from newbies who are experiencing it for the first time. If you end up reading it and liking it and you have any questions we'll keep it spoiler free or tell you to read on.  Erikson is a master of the climactic ending. Each book ends with a bang and/or tears. And the ending of the entire series...well you'll have to find out.   Welcome to the sub!"

Malazan,3cqrjn,SKR47CH,3,Tue Jul 14 07:13:32 2015 UTC,"Lastly, I have seen many suggest to start with the second book or read them in a certain order, is this a good idea or would you be better off reading them in the order they were released?    You could read a couple of the books in different orders, or with ICE books in between, but I don't think many people here would recommend it on the first time around. You can't go wrong with the publication order."
Malazan,3cqrjn,Oathsend,2,Fri Jul 10 03:09:30 2015 UTC,"It's certainly complex, with dozens of major plot lines and i have no idea how many significant characters.  You can definitely keep up if you pay attention, though. Some people resort to notes and maps, etc, but I stayed afloat without.  Just read the main series in order. There's an ongoing plot, and you can't mess with it.  Book 1 is not the strongest, and has a steep immersion curve - but you will be lost without the background it provides.  If you handled the complexity of ASOIAF, you can handle this."
Malazan,3cqrjn,TheBananaKing,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:35:58 2015 UTC,"Of course we need the obligatory TOR Reread mention. If you're having a hard time following what's going on, I'd recommend following the TOR Reread. They have handy recaps of each chapter, as well as commentary from Amanda (a first time reader) and Bill (not a first time reader). If you like your reading spoiler free, I'd stay clear of Bill's commentary though."
Malazan,3cqrjn,TRAIANVS,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:31:38 2015 UTC,Yes. So much more complex than asoiaf. I end many a chapter thinking wtf just happened? And then I read the Tor Reread analysis and it's slightly more clear but still mire and more questions pile up. I'm five books deep and this is still happening; I just accept my confusion and read on. I'm actually taking a break to reread asoiaf since that's more of a sit back and experience it type of series.
Malazan,3cqrjn,mcgarmm,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:30:55 2015 UTC,"Are these books really as complicated as everyone says? Like if you are paying attention and reading closely will you be fine?   If you are paying attention and reading closely you will be fine.  What you have to remember is that it's one humongous book in ten parts.  There are lots of things you won't get in one book, but the important stuff will be explained later.  Not every loose end gets tied up, but the important ones do, eventually.  There's quite a bit of resolution within each book, as well, enough to satisfy you while giving you a taste for more.  That being said, you will get a lot out of a second reading.  Erikson constantly makes references only he and someone who has read ahead can understand.  Those references will be mysterious if you have not read ahead, but that's okay, just keep reading.   Also, is the ending to the series considered satisfying by the majority of fans?    I haven't gotten that far but I've been assured it is.   Lastly, I have seen many suggest to start with the second book or read them in a certain order, is this a good idea or would you be better off reading them in the order they were released?    That strikes me as a bad idea.  The first book is the most confusing because it is the first book, but if you started with the second book it would be even more confusing.  You have to start somewhere, and I say read them in the order they were published.  If you want to get a taste of the world of Malazan without committing to the entire series, I recommend Bauchelain and Korbal Broach: Three Short Novels of the Malazan Empire.  It's three short novels that will not spoil the main series but will give you some idea of what to expect."
Malazan,3cqrjn,wjbc,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:00:55 2015 UTC,"I've just read the first three.  When I started I knew nothing about the series.  I struggled a lot with the first book, and frequently went back to read something or look in the appendix or at the maps.  The maps kinda drove me crazy because in my edition few of the places mentioned are on the map of genbakis.  And most of what's on the map has little or no connection to the story.  I was 100s of pages in before I realized the action was taking place on two continents, and the map had only part of one.  The introduction to the world is not graceful.  This is not a standard fantasy world, but it is written as if there's no reason to explain what a barghast is (for instance).  By the third book enough hints and descriptions have accumulated, that I understand, but in the first book you are introduced to lots of magics, places,races and species simply by name with little or no info on what they are.  But I got enough to make it worth my while.  I don't finish books, let alone series that aren't fun.  By the second book things were much more smooth, and I didn't need the appendix much, and the maps actually showed the area where the story took place.  The third book I listened to (the narrator was awesome), and I never regretted the fact that I did t have access to maps and appendixes. I don't know the answers to all the mysteries, but I know what's going on.  This is the combination of what I've learned from the previous two books, and I suspect the authors growing skill at obliquely explaining the his world.   But now that I've come this far, I doubt rereading the first book would present any difficulties."
Malazan,3cpv24,Snuug,2,Thu Jul 9 20:34:04 2015 UTC,Did you have a specific composition by Mahler in mind (or playing) while reading the end of DG? Was it his 8th?
Malazan,3cpv24,volz_rocksti,2,Thu Jul 9 20:47:31 2015 UTC,"I've been taking them slowly so I can stretch them out across all the books as best as I can, but a memorable moment was during the first battle on the chain of dogs while listening to the first movement of the 2nd symphony. On the whole, though, I didn't have any specific one in mind."
Malazan,3cpv24,volz_rocksti,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:52:37 2015 UTC,I'm checking out Mahler now on Google Play and am thoroughly impressed. Do you have a preferred orchestra/conductor for his works?
Malazan,3cpv24,Elandar,3,Thu Jul 9 21:06:17 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Leonard Bernstein's (a variety of orchestras) collection is available on spotify, google play, and apple music and is fantastic. My only caveat to that is that Ricardo Chailly's collection (mostly with the royal concertgebouw) is a little less bombastic and is slightly more traditional, but the only recording of his I prefer to Bernstein is the eighth. Additionally, Bernstein's recording of Das Lied von der Erde (the remastered one from the 60's) is sublime and absolutely essential. If you want any more suggestions for some of the lesser known stuff, just let me know.   Mahler ranges from fairly traditional to very avante garde for his time (nothing is crazy compared to later 20th century, orchestral music) and I would definitely recommend you start with the symphonies and listen to them in order if you have the resources to manage that. Much like the Malazan books, the symphonies are the meat of the story, but there are song cycles and other vocal works that play equally important, if smaller roles.  I really hope you enjoy."
Malazan,3cpv24,DidNatziThat,2,Thu Jul 9 21:19:11 2015 UTC,"I happened to end up reading some of Deadhouse Gates while listening to Joaquín Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez.   It was several years ago at this point, but it was somehow perfect."

Malazan,3conw1,qcp,7,Thu Jul 9 17:41:31 2015 UTC,"MT takes place in the same time period as the rest of the books I believe. But it begins, technically, before or maybe even during GoM. Just on another continent in the world, to the West of Seven Cities.    As to why its harder to get into, and it is, I'm with you on that.....this is a whole new set of characters and storylines. Erikson is basically back to the drawing board with character development etc. Keep with it though, the whole last 1/4 of the book is awesome."
Malazan,3conw1,phathiker,3,Thu Jul 9 17:21:35 2015 UTC,"It becomes clearer where/who the Edur are, and what their relationship is to the rest of the story.

Malazan,3conw1,Elandar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:40:08 2015 UTC,"I'd considered that it may just be distance, however, I dismissed the idea due to the fact that the Malazan certainly have mages of rashan. Quick ben is the ex high priest of shadow, and coupled with the fact that shadowthrone and cotillion are kellanved and dancer, it seems unlikely that they would be blissfully ignorant of a large population of edur, when kurald emurlahn is/was their warren.    It would seem likely that they would encounter each other within the warrens.    I mean, shadowthrone/cotillion seem to be unaware as they sent cutter and apsalar to discover the threat to shadow. Is mere distance enough to hide from a god?"
Malazan,3conw1,SageOfTheWise,5,Thu Jul 9 15:56:46 2015 UTC,"Quick ben is the ex high priest of shadow, and coupled with the fact that shadowthrone and cotillion are kellanved and dancer, it seems unlikely that they would be blissfully ignorant of a large population of edur, when kurald emurlahn is/was their warren.   Nothing says any of those characters don't know about a civilization of Edur somewhere. They are all characters with lots of very privileged information, most of which they don't share with anyone. One of the things to remember about Emurlahn is it's shattered. There isn't any proper Emurlahn warren to use. Just many different distinct pieces.   It would seem likely that they would encounter each other within the warrens.   Heh. Clever thought. Keep this question in mind going forward, there's definitely an answer here.   I mean, shadowthrone/cotillion seem to be unaware as they sent cutter and apsalar to discover the threat to shadow. Is mere distance enough to hide from a god?    Gods aren't omnipotent, they don't know everything. And just because Shadowthrone is aware of the Edur's existence doesn't mean he knows they are specifically the ones attacking Drift Avali. Not that I remember specifically if it's ever actually implied he didn't know."

Erikson can be not clear about timelines sometimes. Midnight Tides was my least fave book at the start but by the end of the book it's one of my faves.  Also if it makes you feel better, you're almost at the halfway point! After this in Bonehunters, all plots and subplots start to Converge all the way up to the Crippled God."
Malazan,3conw1,LucidLunatic,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:32:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for your reply. I'm looking forward to the convergence of storylines.  I'm holding out hope that Karsa Orlong and Kruppe will cross paths one day.
Malazan,3cp4og,danaran,7,Thu Jul 9 17:20:42 2015 UTC,"The Imass was used to seal a rent in the warren, and he left his sword with Stormy. He knew he would escape as he took a severed Andii head with him and he could substitute that.  D'rek part is RAFO  I think you are confusing FOreigner (Withal) with Traveller. Look out for Traveller in Return of the Crimson Guard and Toll the Hounds  Throne issue is RAFO (I think)  As far as I remember Hand is a subunit of the Claw like a squad."
Malazan,3cp4og,RuinEleint,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:38:50 2015 UTC,Thanks! Would you mind reminding me who Traveller is again? Is he the guy in the tall lighthouse thing that Karsa and Torvald Nom went to after escaping the Nascent?
Malazan,3cp4og,LayYourGhostsToRest,3,Thu Jul 9 19:10:27 2015 UTC,"The only thing you'll know about Traveller is the passage on the moving island and the throne of shadow when he is introduced. The guy who builds the skeletons, who Karsa and Torvald meet is someone else entirely."
Malazan,3cp4og,RuinEleint,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:27:27 2015 UTC,I think revealing that would be a serious spoiler. Are you reading the Esslemont books as well? Because its revealed in RotCG.  Its not the House of Chains guy. That person Karsa and Torvlad visited is Urko Crust of the Imperial Old Guard who is in hiding.
Malazan,3cp4og,SageOfTheWise,5,Fri Jul 10 02:50:13 2015 UTC,"Someone mentioned at the end that Topper was still missing in the Imperial Warren. I have a vague memory of Topper doing something there in HoC but can't remember, where was his story left?   Last you saw Topper I believe was when he appeared at the beginning of HoC to give Tavore her marching orders and update her on what happened in Genebackis with the Bridgeburners. He's been missing in the warren since soon after.   I'm kind of forgetting the distinction between the Claw and the Hand - were the Hand the secret assassin organization controlled by Korbolo Dom in HoC, and the Claw are just under Laseen/Pearl's rule (except for Mallick Rel's Black Hand within them)?   The Claw are Laseen's personal assassin squad basically. She created them and used to run them before becoming Empress. Topper was the leader until he disappeared, and the job was briefly Pearl's before his death. The Black Hand was Mallick's own version he was making secretly from within the Claw. The group Korbolo Dom was using in HoC was The Talon, which was Dancer's old similar group, that was thought wiped out by The Claw.   So we finally find out that Foreigner is Withal! I can't recall all the places Foreigner showed up in the past books though, he showed up to the moving island with the Throne of Shadow right? And said he'd take care of the rest of the Edur? Where else has he shown up in the past books?   'Foreigner' only shows up in The Bonehunters I believe. The person who is on the moving island and all that is someone going by the name 'Traveler'. You'll learn more about this person later.   Speaking of thrones, do we know yet why Shadowthrone is so intent on protecting the First Throne / why the Edur need to secure it? Or is this a RAFO?   Shadowthrone is in the business of denying people power. The Edur wanted it because it was The Throne of Shadow, and they are the Edur (of Shadow) so they decided it was there's.   There were lots of mentions of D'rek in this book, how the god killed all his followers for 'betraying' him and then how Tayschrenn used (still is?) to be a D'rek follower/big cahuna and allegedly stole a bunch of important documents. I didn't see/can't recall the significance of this stuff in relation to the plot, is it RAFO?   It's a continuing plot. Important to remember Banaschar and how he's now like the only living worshipper of D'rek.   Right at the start of the Malaz City ending a big red fireball lit up the sky and landed in the ocean. Then it seemed like no one mentioned it again. What happened? I loved the scene where the T'lan Imass comes to the city to ask for the sword back from Stormy, but I'm forgetting why he got it in the first place back when they were on the Silanda.   Answering these two together because they're connected. The fireball was Imass, popping out of the rent in the sky he had been healing for the past few books. The fireball lands in the bay, and then a few scenes later you read about the Imass emerging from the bay. Stormy got the blade from him on the Silanda because someone needed to hold on to it while he was gone."
Malazan,3cp4og,internet_enthusiast,3,Thu Jul 9 20:05:44 2015 UTC,The Edur wanted it because it was The Throne of Shadow   I think that the OP was referring to the First Throne rather than the Throne of Shadow.
Malazan,3cp4og,TriscuitCracker,2,Fri Jul 10 00:03:47 2015 UTC,"Wow thank you! That was a really satisfying refresher, things make a lot more sense now. Maybe I was being oblivious about the fireball thing, I totally missed that. Excited to do a re-read some day and pick all this stuff up."
Malazan,3cp4og,TriscuitCracker,3,Fri Jul 10 05:02:17 2015 UTC,"Because you've read HoC, I feel I can post this.  Bonehunters is one of my fave of the series.   HoC_Spoiler_Tor_Re-Read_HoC_Chapter_20   For D'Rek, read on, for Traveller, most definitely read on, and other questions, I cannot recall.   What did you think of the Siege of Y'Ghtan?"
Malazan,3cpgbd,Coltaine7th,3,Thu Jul 9 18:47:26 2015 UTC,"This ones always frustrated me a bit, because it's such a cliff hanger it really deserves more of a resolution for the reader. But I think we can conclude enough about it.  The most specific answer to what Hood asked for may just be hidden in a line of Jaghut humor. When Paran and Hood are negotiating, Paran asks Hood what he wants more than anything else. Hood tells him (we don't hear it), Paran responds ""You can’t be serious"", to which Hood says ""Death is always serious.""  Now you read this and take that line to mean ""I (the personification of death) am always serious"". But imagine if what Hood said he wanted was ""I want to die"". It fits Paran's reaction perfectly, and turns Hood's response into a play on words.  Now, how exactly is Paran required for Hood to die? Not a clue. I mean you can imagine that given Paran's role as Master of the Deck, he might be required for this some how, but this is never touched upon or hinted at, and we never see Paran in any connection to Hood's death come TTH. So it's hard to say. It's possible Paran's role was really more in being able to name a successor to the realm of death (The Bridgeburners), because Hood doesn't want to die and leave the spot open. That's probably a better guess overall since that seems more in line with Paran's powers, but again, we still don't see any actual indication he's involved when it does happen.  As for Hood's line about opening the gates of death in the other direction, that's in reference to what Paran is getting out of the bargain. Hood is letting a soul out of his realm. Heboric's soul to be exact. Because Heboric is the one who can stop the rain of Jade Statues."
Malazan,3cpgbd,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:36:21 2015 UTC,"It's never explicitly spelled out, but given the events of TTH I think it's safe to assume that he wanted to stop being the god of death."

So Serious Spoilers upto The Crippled God follow  I think there  are several aspects to this. Firstly as stated above, Heboric had to be allowed to do his stuff.  Secondly Hood needed to take the dead and move them into Dragnipur for the finale of TtH, which is of course part of Rake's grand plan to break Dragnipur, reopen Kurald Galain to the Andii, bring back Mother Dark and stop the Liosan.  Thirdly, Hood wanted to stop being the GOd of Death as without a divine aspect while still being Ascendant it would free him to act against the FA"

I would always recommend the first read-through done as the author intended. He is the story-teller here and has chosen this way for reasons. Same goes for Esselmont's books.

The book is the roughest for me in terms of the cruelty and depravity of humans. I skipped it on the reread! Just like I won't watch Hannibal again even though it was awesome. Felisins arc was really rough and The Chain of Dogs was also.

Malazan,3cktu7,Berserker42,2,Wed Jul 8 20:43:19 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah I had a similar idea. The fact that Rake and Osric inversely mirror each other like MD AND FL. Like: Rake gets the TA to involve themselves outwards to protect from inward dangers ( their emoness), Osric closes KL to portect from outer dangers forcing them to be inwards. So Rake willingly goes into Gate, Osric gets pulled into gate. ( I wonder if I'm the only one who wished they were friends though- thought it would have been nice I guess.)"

Jaghut are the orcs from World of Warcraft with a zany sense of humor.   Kruppe in my head looks like Friar Tuck from the Robin Hood with Kevin Costner.   Whiskeyjack looks like an unshaven Russell Crowe from Gladiator in my mind.   Pust reminds me of Brad Pitt from 12 Monkeys."

Malazan,3ch6bs,nieud,8,Tue Jul 7 21:46:33 2015 UTC,"I think the similarity to elves comes from two aspects that are borrowed from traditional Tolkienesque fantasy: 1) the idea of an extremely long-lived species that is supposedly wiser than humanity, yet forced to begrudgingly interact with humanity due to common threats or struggles; and 2) the idea of a species with claim to special knowledge of the origin of the universe or world, a claim to be a product of perfection.    Pointy ears don't really matter in the scope of these themes."
Malazan,3ch6bs,DrinkyDrank,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:49:53 2015 UTC,"1) the idea of an extremely long-lived species that is supposedly wiser than humanity, yet forced to begrudgingly interact with humanity due to common threats or struggles; and 2) the idea of a species with claim to special knowledge of the origin of the universe or world, a claim to be a product of perfection.   Funny that we 'read' those races quite differently. Nice that the books allow for that :)   My image of the Tiste does not really fit point 1 and 2. Well, they are long-lived and do begrudgingly interact with humans. But I don't think they are seen as especially wise by humans. Maybe the Andii a bit, but not the Edur and Liosan. The Liosan themselves think they are pretty damn swell and (a product of) perfection of course so I agree on that point. But that's not really the collective self-image of the Edur and Andii in my opinion. Spoilers all   Do they claim to have special knowledge of the origin of the universe or world? I cannot directly recall Tiste characters making that claim in their interactions with other races, but I can very well be that I've forgotten ;) This may be more of an image-thing, that humans assume the Tiste know what's up. In general I have the felling that humans have misinterpreted Tiste myths / made myths around the Tiste and that the Tiste (Andii, at least) have just let that happen. They don't really seem to care. And going on how the Tiste talk about stuff in Forge of Darkness"

Rather than make the Tiste wiser than humans, Erickson makes them uniquely flawed by their own experiences, e.g. the Andii's apathy, the Liosan's self-righteousness.  Rather than possessing true knowledge and a deep connection with the origins of the universe, they have shattered faith and misguided myths."

Malazan,3cf4l2,ron_to_the_hills,4,Tue Jul 7 12:43:59 2015 UTC,"It's not clear that Treach had to die to become the God of War.  I don't want to spoil Night of Knives, but it's not at all clear that the old emperor had to die to become Shadowthrone.  It's also not clear that there's just one God of War, or, for that matter, that there's just one God of Shadow.  Not everyone acknowledges Shadowthrone's title.    Therefore it's not clear what would have happened if Fener had been secure as the God of War when Treach died.  Presumably Treach could not have taken Fener's place if it hadn't been vacant, but it's possible he could become a new God of War or play some role in the pantheon.  Or there might have been another way for him to challenge Fener.  And no, there aren't fixed amounts of gods.  Read on, and you will meet someone assigned to manage the pantheon, but his ability to do so is very much in doubt.  And he is not an old god.  It seems easier to fill an old slot than to create a new one, but both are possible.  Fener's fall happened first, Treach's death happened next, but it took a while for Treach's worshipers to accumulate and his temples to be built.  So there was a delay between the time Treach first took Fener's place and the followers of Fener realized he had been replaced.  And there also may have been some denial involved on the part of Fener's worshipers, it may have taken even longer for them to accept that he had been replaced."
Malazan,3cf4l2,wjbc,2,Tue Jul 7 13:32:29 2015 UTC,"A lot of these things are very chicken and the egg like when it comes to actions concerning gods. Since MoI and DG take place side by side, it's indeed true that worship of Trake existed before his ascendance to godhood. Trake was a known entity for a long time. A famed Ascendant figure from the First Empire. In GotM, Rallick wears a Trake mask at the Fete. And the forces that be kind of have a way having setting up things ahead of time. Stuff like Felisin on the path to replacing Sha'ik way before Sha'ik needed replacing. Trake worship starts to become a thing just a little bit before there is suddenly going to be a power vacuum in the realm of war gods.  Which goes right into your next question, there aren't finite fixed roles for gods. Certain roles by their nature could be limited, but that doesn't apply to the general case. Ultimately it's kind of just up to what people worship, because that's where the power comes from. To take the specific example of war, there can be multiple war gods. The nature of war lends itself to that. Opposing sides and all that.  For something like healing, I believe there's one god we know of directly related to healing, Soliel. There may be more 'gods of healing' somewhere. If people worship them somewhere. They could both coexist as long as they both have the worshipers. Or one might try to take the power of the other if they feel threatened. And then there are overlapping roles. Soliel is healing, but someone like the Queen of Dreams is life, which would certainly cover healing as well. So you can see their certainly aren't fixed discrete roles. The roles are only finite in the sense there are only a finite number of beings to worship them."

I think there were many things that led to his usurpation such as a purge of the Malazan ranks for followers of any cult of war or any particular ascendant, such as the soldiers who were pledged to Hood when Dassem was Hood's champion and First Sword of the Empire.  Also the ritual of his legitimate High Priest/Destriant (heboric light touch) being severed from the Priesthood and cast out over a political beef made him start to lose touch with the world."

Most people after finishing the series can remember ( ironically) when he says: ""i remember something"". Its a testament to how well he's written that he can steal the whole show with one or two lines and one scene where he's actually awake in a huge book. Icarium is Erikson's best written character, him or Rhulad imo."
Malazan,3ccodc,mortal_sword,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:35:51 2015 UTC,"I always found Icarium's chapters interesting throughout the series, which is actually remarkable. Erikson creates depth in a character that doesn't have much to work with in terms of dialogue and thought, just using passing references.   As for Rhulad, when you start to see the real him breaking through the shell of insanity it's pretty heartbreaking, especially for his brothers who can't do anything to help him. Another incredible character."
Malazan,3ccodc,WallyMak,2,Thu Jul 9 00:07:29 2015 UTC,Ah damn Rhulad... and never have I wished harder for a happier ending and literally everyone in the Sengar family dies bar Trull's baby. Damn and Rhulad's final moment... looking for forgiveness while Trull looked for forgiveness. Shit.
Malazan,3ccodc,mortal_sword,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:15:07 2015 UTC,"Never have I initially hated a character that much, and then over time feel really sorry for them. It serves wonderfully as sort of a microcosm of the Crippled God though, demonstrating that pain driving him to do things that are regarded pretty universally as evil. I always thought it was clever how Erikson makes you sympathetic towards Rhulad by the end of his life, but at that point I didn't make the connection that this is sort of what tcg is dealing with too."
Malazan,3ccodc,WallyMak,2,Thu Jul 9 01:24:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know I didn't see it coming until DoD, it makes me laugh thinking back to after I finished RG  how  I imagined the unholy convergence of people ( including Rake in my mind - lol) beating down Kaminsod. Not exactly what happened in the end. And damn every Rhulad scene in it as sad. Over two books he lost: three brothers, his parents, two wives, his kingdom, his life (many times) and finally ( this always surprises me) two unborn kids!"
Malazan,3ccodc,mortal_sword,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:36:49 2015 UTC,The same could be said about Karsa. He played a hugely pivotal role in the events that took place at the end of TCG.
Malazan,3ccodc,Priest_of_Aroo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:45:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah. While they weren't at the battle, their actions had huge impact. Karsa ultimately (and ironically) brought about one of the few happy moments in the entirety of those last two books."
Malazan,3ccodc,WallyMak,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:08:46 2015 UTC,"Regarding Tavore, its  amistake to assume she knows everything. She knows that that the heart of the Crippled God is in Kolanse and it has to be freed. To do this she has to fight the Forkul Assail. The Assail's possession of the heart is nothing new, and hence she probably knew about that when she set out. But ahe doesn't know everything. When the T'lan IMass find her and bring her greetings from the Crippled God her reaction shows how uncertain she was. Also Shadowthrone and Paran's conversation at the fort sheds a bit of light on how while the general outline of things maybe known the details  are hazy."
Malazan,3ccodc,RuinEleint,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:07:47 2015 UTC,With regards Tavore I always took the revelation that she was a Talon to indicate offscreen interactions with Cottilion given how they are his personal soldiers.
Malazan,3ccodc,DAMCARDLE,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:48:40 2015 UTC,"ICE's books answer about Silverfox, Karsa gets his own trilogy, the Malazan empire and Laseen are in ICE books as well. I personally like the Crokus and Apsalar reunion ( although I still have no idea why Cotillion split them up - Didn't really do much and seem to have a reason for it) .  Anyway Tavore like you said has Shadowthrone, QB and T'amber/ Eres'al but there are other sources of info. For example she's a great scholar, she spent years in the Empire's greatest library, she gets a lot of knowledge from there. She is also a Talon. She also relies on Fiddler's readings. Felisin also rtalks about how her mother was a seer but she didn't get the talent.... maybe Tavore did?"
Malazan,3ccodc,mortal_sword,2,Mon Jul 6 23:43:17 2015 UTC,Ah so they are a continuation in the same world. In terms of collected reading are those the next ones recommended to read (Tale of Malazan Empire) or the Triste triology or Novellas?
Malazan,3ccodc,mortal_sword,4,Tue Jul 7 00:11:15 2015 UTC,"The first book by ICE is way back when Dancer and the Emperor try to ascend, Night of Knives ( although there's not much Kell and Dancer in it). The next is after Bonehunters, Return of the Crimson Guard and the rest are in the same time frame as DoD and TCG or just after it. These are finished and answer a lot of questions. They are also really good so I'd recommend them first to get more of an understanding of outer plots and characters mentioned in the main series, ex Crimson Guard, Kallor, Assail etc. The Tiste trilogy is unfinished so whatever... and I haven't read the novellas so I don't know. So ICE books first I'd say."
Malazan,3ccodc,SageOfTheWise,2,Tue Jul 7 01:27:34 2015 UTC,Cotillion split them up because Apsalar wanted it. She saw the changes 'Cutter' was going through to be like her and couldn't live with the guilt sharing that life with him so she leaves him for his own good basically.
Malazan,3ccodc,mortal_sword,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:52:18 2015 UTC,Ah I see. Thanks I vaguely remember that now but I sort of forgot all about it after finishing the books.
Malazan,3cawmw,end_O_the_world_box,9,Mon Jul 6 14:02:45 2015 UTC,"Keneb is a commander in the Malazan army. He was riding with Kalam in Deadhouse Gates, but had been concussed at the time.   At the end of DG, he was last seen withdrawing his command behind the gates of Aren when Pormqual led the Malazan army out to be crushed by the Dogslayers (led by Mallick Rel and Korlobo Dom) and witnessed by Duiker, the Wickans and the others at Aren. He'd remembered a fragment of conversation from his time traveling with Kalam that had predicted Rel's betrayal.   I believe he is promoted to a Fist in HoC. He's slightly stigmatized as a ""coward"" for withdrawing his troops from the clash with the Dogslayers and feels a little bit guilty about it, even though he knew how it would shake out and that he saved his solders' lives. He's a good guy.  I'm pretty sure Borduke is ""just"" a soldier."
Malazan,3cawmw,future_forward,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:25:24 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot! I knew there was something about Keneb besides being a fist for Tavore.
Malazan,3cawmw,drae-,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:15:07 2015 UTC,I think borduke is introduced in hoc. Nothing to remember iirc.
Malazan,3cawmw,Montaron87,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:12:49 2015 UTC,"Keneb is the dude that Kalam runs into when he's trailing the Chain of Dogs. Used to be captain of the city guard in a city on the seven cities continent before the whirlwind uprising started and he was fleeing towards Aren with his wife and kids (and Minala).  Borduke is just a random sergeant in Tavore's army, who's close to Strings and Gesler."
Malazan,3cawmw,Ordinary650,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:26:40 2015 UTC,"Keneb was part of the small group that Kalam came across in DG, the same group that Minala was in. They travelled together for a while, although Keneb was a bit out of it so Minala and Kalam took control. He was an ex city guard fleeing the uprising.  Borduke is just a soldier.  EDIT: Well, should have checked the replies first, basically an identical answer"
Malazan,3c8qx9,afw4402,15,Sun Jul 5 23:25:01 2015 UTC,"On your 1st reread of the series. I am joking, but then again, not really. So much makes sense after you reread for the 1st time, it is just like a new series."
Malazan,3c8qx9,gbardelli,3,Mon Jul 6 01:16:45 2015 UTC,"In my first re-read right now. Can confirm, but not really..."
Malazan,3c8qx9,h0ll0way,3,Mon Jul 6 12:10:39 2015 UTC,Exactly.
Malazan,3c8qx9,gbardelli,5,Mon Jul 6 15:41:58 2015 UTC,"You kinda just need to stick with it and enjoy the feeling of being overwhelmed by a new, strange world.  Try to keep characters and locations straight in your head, other than that just go with the flow.  Things will start to make more sense as you read, and you'll actually miss that element of mystery once it's gone."
Malazan,3c8qx9,DrinkyDrank,4,Mon Jul 6 00:02:46 2015 UTC,"If it makes you feel better, a lot of us felt the same way when we first started. It didn't click with me until near the end of Book 1. GotM, while good in my opinion is definitely the weakest of the books. It's Erikson's first book and he wrote it nine years before the rest of the series and it shows sometimes.   I promise you, it does get better, amazingly so, and make more sense the further you read. The writing style does not change much, but is much more polished.  I would read through this book,  Deadhouse Gates and perhaps even Memories of Ice. If you don't change your mind, then stop there. No series is for everybody.   Think of Malazan as if you were an alien visiting Earth for the first time. You have no context, no sense of history, no idea of how things are, or how the world works.  You have no idea who's famous, who's a war hero, who is a nobody.  You have to learn by living here. That's how Malazan is. You have to figure out how warrens work and ascendancy and godhood, the characters interaction, etc just by reading and putting things together, drawing your own conclusions. Eriksen rarely spoon feeds or does info dumps.  There are many ""Ah-HAH!"" moments as you put things together and see how things interrelate, how plotlines and point of views interact.   If you need help, please feel free to ask this sub for spoiler free answers or check out the Malazan Tor Re-Read of the Fallen in the sidebar for  chapter summaries which can be very helpful. Also the glossary and the dramatis personae in the back of the book are your friends."
Malazan,3c8qx9,TriscuitCracker,2,Mon Jul 6 02:19:22 2015 UTC,I'm definitely going to stick out Gardens of the Moon.  The Prologue and the parts I've read about Ganoes has definitely caught my interest and I'm following whats going on so far with that plotline (I think)  but this part about Tattersall is a bit confusing right now.
Malazan,3c8qx9,h0ll0way,5,Mon Jul 6 02:25:44 2015 UTC,Always an even trade!
Malazan,3c8qx9,funkysylvanelf,2,Mon Jul 6 12:11:16 2015 UTC,"If you enjoyed Ganoes AND The Prologue, you will absolutely love the rest of the story. Tattersail story is mostly the confusing part of the story early on because it imply that you know her & about her from way back, which you don't. I would say 200 pages more & things will start to make sense."
Malazan,3c8qx9,academ777,5,Mon Jul 6 02:49:13 2015 UTC,You will notice that the first book is split into two parts. Usually about 50 to 70 percent into each book you will start to get a grasp of things. Most of the books are setup this way.
Malazan,3c8qx9,dragonkillingdroid,3,Mon Jul 6 01:12:57 2015 UTC,"I finished GotM a couple of weeks ago, and oddly enough I found it fairly comprehensible right from the start. Once you agree that you're not going to understand everything, it becomes clearer. Does that make sense? Anyway, when the second sub-book starts 'Darujistan', it became really interesting for me.  Btw, i'm currently reading Deadhouse Gates and it's even more awesome, so just keep on reading."
Malazan,3c8qx9,CloudyOut,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:20:21 2015 UTC,"Yea, I've kind of been surprised by others confusion, and the warnings that this is some kind of huge struggle to undertake. Other than certain things that are out of any real context for us because background information hasn't been revealed, or some confusing lines of dialogue, the story seems pretty straightforward and easy to follow. I made the mistake of a three week hiatus before finishing Gotm yesterday and I still had a pretty good idea of what's going on. I'm sure there's some important stuff I might have missed or hints to what's going on that went over my head, but it's still not hard to follow the basic plot.  I'm 6% into Deadhouse Gates and pretty damn excited for what's to come. I really want to know what's happened to Felisin"
Malazan,3c8qx9,mortal_sword,2,Thu Jul 9 03:15:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah you'll spend a lot of time confused, its the just the type of series it is. Many fantasy writes are said to open a window into a different world for the reader to look through; Erkison launches you through the window. By the second book you'll have more of a hang on it, things will make sense further in the novel though. But you should keep in mind its a thick subtle series nothing is usually outright explained. Enjoy!"

Malazan,3c8qx9,Aiolus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:12:58 2015 UTC,It's weird to say this but you may just be confusing yourself. You're not meant to understand everything.   What is it you're specifically confused about?
Malazan,3c8qx9,herminator,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:46:54 2015 UTC,Just read a part where Tattersall is talking to Hairlock after some magical attack and he's missing his whole lower half as he lays there dying.  Tattersall talks to these 4 Bridgeburner guys then goes back to wherever the hell she is and is sleeping with a guy Calot and all the sudden Hairlock just shows up again?  Like aren't you dead bro whats going on here?
Malazan,3c8qx9,dangertom69,4,Mon Jul 6 02:20:45 2015 UTC,"It's a flashback, the whole scene with Calot happened before the battle that sees Hairlock cut in half. It confused me the first time too :)"
Malazan,3c8qx9,Kheshire,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:17:06 2015 UTC,Makes much more sense now thanks.  I was confused because as he was dying he was talkig as if he made some deal with somebody to come back to life.  I'll be reading more tonight hopefully things begin to connect but I am pretty intrigued so far.
Malazan,3c8qx9,Aiolus,3,Mon Jul 6 16:11:22 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the part with Calot and Hairlock is a ""flashback"", is it not?"
Malazan,3c8qx9,TheBananaKing,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:11:08 2015 UTC,"My interest really picked up either that chapter or the next, when tattersail described the battle. I had the same confusion but keep at it, it'll click soon. Also you're not supposed to know all these terms yet, what a moons spawn or an ascendant is. Just keep reading it's definitely worth it. I can't answer this question though, I don't remember him appearing again until after Ben is done with him"
Malazan,3c8qx9,swjm,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:40:54 2015 UTC,"They had a deal with dying hairlock. I imagine it was to save him.   Edit: it's a bit sparse on exposition or whatever the word is. I do feel like it kinda is all there, imo. You just have to make sure you don't skip anything. If I remember correctly hairlock is fully explained."

Malazan,3c8qx9,dangermond,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:29:34 2015 UTC,Push through to book 3 of GotM. By that point all the main players will have been introduced and things will start to settle a bit.
Malazan,3c9eg9,Whales96,9,Mon Jul 6 03:03:58 2015 UTC,After Reaper's Gale is where it makes the most sense contextually. Or you can read it after the main series entirely. I'd recommend not inserting it anywhere else otherwise it will just break up the flow and not add much.
Malazan,3c9eg9,TocTheEternal,4,Mon Jul 6 04:18:19 2015 UTC,"I started ICE after reading Book of the Fallen, and I'm currently on RtCG. ICE and Erikson have such a different style of writing that it would be weird for me to switch back and forth. ICE is all about short sentences and glazing over periods of non-action (travelling from one place to the next, for example). Erikson loves to go into detail and will fill those quiet periods of travelling with random conversation.    Both have their places but mixing the two isn't my cup of tea."
Malazan,3c9eg9,KevDrinksCorona,3,Mon Jul 6 10:39:07 2015 UTC,Return of the Crimson Guard ends after Reaper's Gale and contains implied spoilers for Reaper's Gale. So read it after.
Malazan,3c9eg9,SageOfTheWise,2,Mon Jul 6 05:06:58 2015 UTC,"If it is your first reading, and you have yet to read any of the other ICE novels, then I would recommend finishing out the main series. After The Cripple God you can go back and read through ICE as that just helps fill out the world, but nothing vital to that main story that is MBotF.  Either way, happy reading!"
Malazan,3c9eg9,Bilbato,2,Mon Jul 6 06:04:10 2015 UTC,"Well I've read Night of Knives, and I do enjoy the idea of putting a face to events and groups that are constantly talked about, like the Crimson Guard and Dassem Ultor."
Malazan,3c9eg9,beyond1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:20:53 2015 UTC,Read Return of the Crimson Guard between Reaper's Gale and Toll the Hounds. It'll definitely fill some backstory for a certain character in TtH.
Malazan,3c9eg9,TriscuitCracker,2,Mon Jul 6 11:02:43 2015 UTC,Personally I'd wait. Don't lose your momentum with the main series.

Malazan,3c81n7,wjbc,7,Sun Jul 5 19:42:47 2015 UTC,"I think that's precisely why one of the main underlying themes is compassion. I'm going to quote one of other redditors in this sub-forum cuz he hit it on the nail I thought.   ""In a dark/gritty fantasy settingn such as the world of Malazan, the few acts of kindness and their intent lets us glimpse into a side of the human being which is neglected or forgotten in most brutal and ruthless depictions of a world like ours; empathy/compassion."" -HumbleAsFudge"
Malazan,3c81n7,JyNadaril,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:22:19 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of comic relief, that doesn't make comedy the theme of the series.  Sure, one of the themes is compassion, and one is humor, but the overwhelming theme is that, to paraphrase Thomas Hobbes, in a world at war life is nasty and brutish.  Not always short, because this is a fantasy and immortality is part of this fantasy, but still so nasty and brutish that many immortals long for oblivion."
Malazan,3c81n7,TRAIANVS,12,Sun Jul 5 21:35:33 2015 UTC,I would say that compassion and kindness and humour in the face of unrelenting cruelty and horror is the main theme of the series.

It's possible, but unlikely. The only warren that Rel is capable of accessing - as far as we know - is Ruse, the warren of Sea. It's possible that he's also capable of using Mockra, but there's no evidence of that in the text.

Malazan,3c4xyv,Silencer8X,11,Sat Jul 4 20:49:15 2015 UTC,"Well there's two parts of what used to just be Dassem Ultor; Dassembrae the god part, which is sort of an offshoot and Traveller who's less god more Ascendant because as I said his God part is split from him. Its split because he doesn't accept his Godness and so Dassembrae is formed where as Traveller, non-god Ascendant Dassem needs to eat and drink. Icarium, an ascendant I'm pretty sure, for example, needs to eat and stuff. Also didn't he get shipwrecked, swim to shore and a beat a bear to death... that's pretty strong, I think. And he went a few days without sustenance right? ( sorry been a few months not sure if I'm remembering right."

I always loved the Segulah and to finally get some answers about them and plus to see Daseem again was great.   On to Blood and Bone!
Malazan,3c4fzo,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:16:24 2015 UTC,"Oh.. I loved RotCG and SW too. Don't know why I didn't like NoK, but apart from that it's a great tide. Even Erikson's first book in Malazan is a big turnoff for many."
Malazan,3c4fzo,mortal_sword,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:38:01 2015 UTC,Yeah I recently finished OST too. It was amazing. ( I thought the tohers by Esslemont were great too) I too love the Seguleh ( who doesn't though?) Jan was great. I think OST is probably one of my favourites better than some of Erikson's like House of Chains or Gardens.

Malazan,3c4hss,dragonkillingdroid,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:48:19 2015 UTC,"I'm also on Deadhouse Gates and using the TOR-re-read after every chapter (or 2.. or 3). And I do read Bill's sections as well. And.. so far so good. I don't think he is to spoilery at all. It's sort of like he's talking to Amanda, or at least he's aware that she reads his sections.   Until now I haven't been spoiled, and find his sections a welcome addition. Especially because he's saying things like 'pay attention to this' 'remember this name' 'watch out for more of this'. And that sort thing helps a lot to follow this complicated story and focus on the right things."
Malazan,3c4hss,EvenBiggerBoss,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:26:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess spoiled was too strong a word.   His sections are great and worth reading for sure, but I feel like sometimes he'll confirm things or draw attention to specific details that I don't really want to know I should be paying attention to, if you get me.   For example, sometimes Amanda will says something like 'oh I wonder if X is related to Y' or 'X story didn't match Y story, I wonder if there's more to it than there seems' which is ok by itself because it lets the reader wonder with her, but then Bill might draw attention back to it and confirms that there is indeed something there, and then when it starts to fall into place it doesn't have the same impact because you knew to expect something.  I guess it's just one of those personal things. I'd rather read a book once and miss those little details and connections the first time only to pick them up on a reread rather than catch them all on my first try."

GotM was written a while before the rest of the books. There may be a bit less polish to the style, and there are definite discrepancies, but for the most part, you're past the major hurdle. There's one more big one, I think, but once you get past that you're home free and on your way to finishing one of the best series ever written."
Malazan,3c3qdr,25cents,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:25:01 2015 UTC,"I would keep going. GotM, while good in my opinion is definitely the weakest of the books. It's Erikson's first book and he wrote it nine years before the rest of the series and it shows in the criticisms you described. The Azath does definitely appear out of nowhere lol  I promise you, it does get better. MUCH better. You clearly see potential because you had some good things to say sprinkled in with the criticisms. I would read Deadhouse Gates and perhaps even Memories of Ice. If you don't change your mind, then stop there. No series is for everybody and no shame if it doesent grab you!   Think of Malazan as if you were an alien visiting Earth for the first time. You have no context, no sense of history, no idea of how things are, or how the world works. You have to learn by living here. That's how Malazan is. You have to figure out how warrens work and ascendancy and godhood, the characters interaction, etc just by reading and putting things together, drawing your own conclusions. Eriksen rarely spoon feeds or does info dumps.  There are many ""Ah-HAH!"" moments as you put things together and see how things interrelate, how plotlines and point of views interact.   It's an amazing series, and Deadhouse Gates has some of the best moments thrilling and heartbreaking alike in the entire series.  If you need help, please feel free to ask this sub for spoiler free answers or check out the Malazan Tor Re-Read of the Fallen in the sidebar for  chapter summaries which can be very helpful. We love newbies and will be happy to help. Criticisms are fine, we're not blind fanboys, Erikson is not perfect, but no author is.   You're only just at the beginning of your journey. You have so far to go and so much to see and emotion to experience.   If that emotion is along the lines of ""WTF is going on in this book and WTF is this wordy dense gobbledygook philosophical crap"" then that's okay! To each their own!   But we hope you continue. Thanks for the post!"

Rallick Nom is definitely the standout and I hope I see more of him throughout the series. I've sort of put my foot in it because some of his monologues were great particularly after killing Orr wondering about his direction after being on the path on vengeance for so long and if it was even worth it cas Coll had become a drunk.  Although hard to read I like Kruppe aswell.  And Erikson sure doesn't lack originality.Cheers for the help."
Malazan,3c3qdr,SKR47CH,3,Sat Jul 4 19:13:03 2015 UTC,"Kruppe thinks as well, Kruppe is hard to read. But shouldn't that be just, as Kruppe is Kruppe and thus hard to read, in more than one way. Any such attempt to read or decipher Kruppe is naught but a foolish attempt for is Kruppe not the most evasive.  Slippery like an Eel, Kruppe would suggest."

Malazan,3c3qdr,Valar05,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:32:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with this.  For me, Deadhouse was amazing the last 1/3 of the book, but Memories of Ice was amazing (almost) the entire way through."
Malazan,3c3qdr,thegoatofharrenhall,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:32:15 2015 UTC,"The character monologues are cringeworthy    Yeah there are lots to come unfortunately. Down to personal taste and not ultimately a deal breaker (I hate them too but I still enjoy the series).   I can't relate to anyone see above   Gets better. I still can only relate to a minority of the cast (I'm on DOD) but for every five 1-dimensional characters there's a really good 5-dimensional character.   If your going to jump from pov to pov at least give the characters a few distinguished features. The Glade scene was a mess.   Gets easier once the characters are well established across books.   I have no idea what warrens are   No-one does lol.    I don't care about your writing style   One of Eriksons strengths is that he can do a huge variety of writing styles depending on character, place etc. You go from witty banter to philosophical monologues to packed action sequences to emotional depths. There will almost certainly be parts you like and dislike. For the record I can't stand the cringey ""funny"" dialogue or the philosophical monologues but the series still has so much more to offer that I love it.  I think you should at least read Deadhouse Gates, if you don't like it then quit because I can't see you enjoying the whole series if you don't like Gardens or Deadhouse. Hope I helped."
Malazan,3c3qdr,abir_valg2718,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:31:08 2015 UTC,"The Azath house was explained so poorly   Don't worry, you'll learn quite a bit more about Azath in Deadhouse Gates. In fact, Deadhouse in the title refers to a similar sort of house that appeared at the end of GotM.   I have no idea what warrens are   The books span a grand total of over 11000 pages. You've barely scratched the surface. It's broken down into three seperate storylines and the third one doesn't even start until the 5th book. Don't underestimate the sheer scale of the work.   Every charcter is a super badass with super powers   The series also focuses heavily on ordinary soldiers. But as far as super powers go… well, yeah, that's Malazan. It may be a bit off putting at first, but you'll learn more about the world and magic as you read further. Though do remember that there are no infodumps. Some important, crucial observations that shed light on the Erikson's Universe will be presented in a casual, oh-by-the-way sort of way. What may seem confusing, nonsensical, deus-ex-machina-esque at first, will suddenly make sense later (sometimes much later, for instance, GotM's storyline is continued in book 3 and is ""concluded"" in book 7, with four books in between; some of the storylines and characters are put entirely on hold as a consequence).   People rave about Eriksens writng style   The first book is not representative of his writing style. Try starting the second one, you should notice a considerable improvement almost immediately."
Malazan,3c3qdr,Ordinary650,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:27:25 2015 UTC,"No, you are way too critical a reader to get through the whole series. And that's fine, move to another series.  I don't understand people who do this, if you are sitting outside the story and analysing the writing style, or criticising how scenes go, you aren't enjoying the book and should stop. You just don't like it, that's life, there are loads of other books out there.   Why do people make these sort of posts? Any ""why should I continue"" or ""what am I missing"" posts should be removed IMO. You are basically asking people to change your own personal opinion."
Malazan,3c3qdr,ZealouslyTL,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:39:05 2015 UTC,I was enjoying a good portion of GOTM it was until book 7 the fete which was the first time I questioned reading the rest of the series.

Malazan,3c3qdr,raisin_reason,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:31:01 2015 UTC,"And can't they? Opinions are opinions and can (often) change when new facts or ideas come to light. Taxes might suck to someone with no understanding of why you need to give the government money, but that doesn't mean said person's opinion of taxes can't change. Same goes, to some extent, for Malazan. The feeling of being at a loss can be frustrating and make you feel like you're missing something crucial, and understanding that some things won't come to light until much later might change how you view the series entirely."
Malazan,3c3qdr,SKR47CH,0,Tue Jul 7 19:46:50 2015 UTC,I think I shot myself in the foot. I was just also on my 3rd re read of ice and fire. While the series are different every  I read Eriksons work it makes me miss reading Martin.   I'm envious and at the same time pity people on their first read of ASOIAF seems like you feel the same way about Malazan. Ill give DHG a go.
Malazan,3c3qdr,Xardov,2,Sat Jul 4 14:38:33 2015 UTC,"I am reading DG  for the first time right now, it's open on my lap. I only read the first book of ASOIAF, and liked it, but didn't feel the need to keep going at the time. With Erikson, however, I'm interested to see where he takes the world.  I'd suggest trying DG, I find that the quality of writing greatly improves compared to GotM overall."
Malazan,3c3qdr,SKR47CH,2,Sat Jul 4 16:03:10 2015 UTC,"Not to sound a douche, but these two series are on different levels and ASOIAF doesn't really compares with Malazan. Non in world building, not in character development, not in lore , and certainly not in writing.   I came after reading ASOIAF looking for similar book that can match it and Malazan did more than match it. Now, after 13 books of Malazan, I don't think there's anything that can get more amazing that this. I'm open to new Series though."
Malazan,3c3qdr,Storm-Of-Aeons,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:00:31 2015 UTC,"Hey, I've also read ASOIAF and four books of Malazan (currently reading Midnight Tides), and I agree that Malazan is overall a better series, but I'm interested in why you think Malazan's characters are better than ASOIAF's.

Malazan,3c1jj1,mortal_sword,2,Fri Jul 3 22:22:15 2015 UTC,"I'll edit this with successive answers.   1) no, I don't think he had any relation to the Jaghut.   2) relatedly, a Finnest seems to be a Jaghut specific artifact, so I don't think those are Finnests. The mask is probably supposed to be symbolic of something literary.   3) I don't think that they are demons. I'd guess that they were just human High Mages, either gifted their original capabilities by him or permanently subverted by him (while he is active).   4) no, he is not. He is some sort of an enigma to Baruk in GotM, and Baruk is plenty familiar with the cabal. He is also ignored by Vorcan when she is tasked with killing them, and ignored by Baruk and Derudan when they band together to resist her. And he isn't directly affected by the Tyrant when awoken.   5) I think that the Tyrant originally came after the age of the Jaghut and T'lan was well over.   6) maybe Kruppe is on some strange path to Ascendancy, maybe he's been affected by his dealings with K'rul, but I'm pretty sure that he is mostly just an eccentric genius with some magic talent.   7) utter and unassailable domination of Darijhistan. He was trying to bring in an unbeatable, perfectly loyal army (the Seguleh), enslave powerful High Mages (the Cabal), create an impenetrable barrier around the city (the circle), and obliterate his ancient nemesis (the Moranth) to achieve it. Who knows what his future plans would be, but that was his initial aim. Also remember that Darujhistan is by far the most important city in the continent, so complete rule of it is not a small prize.   8) I think the special bolts that killed him also ended him."
Malazan,3c1jj1,TocTheEternal,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:14:15 2015 UTC,"So why did the miner T'lan smell ice?  I also thought maybe a powerful human mage figured out how to make a finnest so that's how he smelt of ice. ( he did say he studied Raest?) Sorry but it was mentioned that Baruk twisted into something demonic when he was taken, Vorcan also shifted into something demonic and Taya was half demon ( So unless Vorcan getting really freaky I thought it came from her) So tis just a form of Soletaken- seems a stretch considering how often they mention the idea of twelve demon servants. Yeah I was reaaaaaaaallly hoping Kruppe wasn't a Cabal demon but wanted to be sure. It would ruin his character somewhat if he wasn't just a human. I figured Jaghut wouldn't care but this new Tyrant might have  ( if he was a Jaghut)  been targeted by T'lan Imass- its their purpose- they wouldn't ignore him.   6.Yeah I figure the same; its what makes him a good character.   Fair enough; though any points on his abilities, his magical power etc...? Really? After all the mask stuff you'd think ICE would mention what happened to the damn thing.   Thanks for reading and answering."
Malazan,3c1jj1,alpha2k8,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:32:54 2015 UTC,"Is been a while since I read the book.  However   1 the miner t'lan smelt I've because raest was in finnest house.  That was his thing.  He wanted to kill raest.  2 I vaguely remember the tyrant saying he studied raest.  But I think it was in a ""that's what this guy did,  now how can I do better.""   3 The cabal. My theory is they basically exchanged their souls for power and immortality in exchange for Unending servitude.    I think the tyrants main abilities are the knowledge gained from reigning over darujistan in the past and being extremely charismatic.  Also with the mask he can transfer his soul into another body. He doesn't need to be a good mage because he had the cabal.  He doesn't need to be a warrior because he had the seguleh.   8 i agree with the original comment.  The bolts were forged from dragnipur, the sword that trapped souls. Had they not been the tyrant would have just changed bodies again.  I'm sorry I can't recall what humble or kruppe did with the body  Sorry for any errors and formatting. On a phone ."

They'd been playing cards for the majority of the book, he knew where Raest was. He said he smelt ice then left the house and found the Tyrant picked him then saw it was human. He wasn't sensing Raest he was sensing the Tyrant which is why he went. Surely He's not stupid enough to not get the Jaghut he's been playing cards with his Raest his sworn enemy..."

I was hooked at first, partially because I was 15 and I was finally capable and eager to digest semi-mature long fantasy series. The world was pretty neat too. But over time I got sick of the plodding romance element, began to hate reading about Richard, and just felt underwhelmed by every ending. This was coupled by my friends continuously egging me on because it was SO GOOD. And after reading the likes of Dune, asoiaf, and Malazan, I can't help but look back at the series as a whole as mediocre bordering on annoying.

Malazan,3bxxf6,Iliad_Keys,8,Fri Jul 3 01:54:50 2015 UTC,"It is super rewarding because of the scale. You may pick up on things you hadn't noticed before. The writing and the story also hold up really well to a reread. The world is huge and worth re-exploring if you enjoy it on the first go.   For me the second read was awesome because I knew a lot of these awesome characters already. I could focus and see more minor details that slipped past on the first read. I also enjoyed linking things from early books to later books. Foreshadowing, etc.   I had no issue whatsoever with GotM. I barely noticed the gotmisms so I was lucky in that respect. The book ties in very well with the series and is awesome on the reread. What is inconsistent are minor details, like the sex of a character."
Malazan,3bxxf6,Aiolus,2,Fri Jul 3 03:11:29 2015 UTC,"What is inconsistent are minor details, like the sex of a character.   Maybe you don't consider it an inconsistency because you bought the explanation, but there are some revelations in later books that make much of what we learned in GotM a lie.  Don't get me wrong, I think it works, but I also think it was a change of plans on the part of Erikson, and not what he contemplated when he wrote GotM.    Why do I think that?  Because there's absolutely no hint of it in GotM, none of the foreshadowing we usually see and don't understand until the reread."
Malazan,3bxxf6,wjbc,4,Fri Jul 3 14:21:58 2015 UTC,"Why is malazan rewarding to reread? What about the experience is different the second time through?   So many things make more sense the second time around.  It's as if Erikson is constantly making remarks and jokes and casual references only he can understand, until you read it the second time and finally get them.  And then suddenly you feel wise.   How well does Gotm tie in to the rest of the series? I ask bc of the ten year gap between it's writing and book 2, and the various gotmisms people mention as inconsistent w the rest of the series.   Because of the unreliable narrators in GotM, the inconsistencies can be explained.  The point of view characters in GotM simply did not know the whole story.  And GotM ties into the rest of the series quite well after you accept that explanation.  Indeed, it adds to the rest of the series, because characters from GotM are still holding on to their suspicions several books into the series."
Malazan,3bxxf6,wjbc,5,Fri Jul 3 03:07:27 2015 UTC,"I'm currently on my first reread, about a quarter through MT. I must say, you notice a great many things you wouldn't have seen your first time through. I noticed this most in MoI actually.  For instance, you may encounter a passage or two that seem quite vague or make little sense your first time through. On the reread however, you will recall coming plot points, and realize this passage concerns events that are yet to come. ""Ooooh i get it! (vague reference) is talking about (coming plot point)!""   As far as GotM is concerned, personally I feel it is less polished, perhaps, than the rest of the series. The decade between GotM and DG allowed Erikson to realize his world more thoroughly, and map out its (often quite convoluted and meticulously interwoven) subplots and campaigns before fleshing them out completely.   GotM is, at least for me, the least 'necessary' of the main series, if you will, because I cannot recall any event or information found in it that is not referred to or rehashed later on in one way or another.   I'm sorry for the somewhat meandering reply, but it's the first time I've been able to sit and reply to a question in quite a while.  Hope it helps!"
Malazan,3bxxf6,FUCKS_LIKE_A_VIKING,3,Fri Jul 3 03:18:07 2015 UTC,"Also, in regards to the rewarding-ness(?) of the reread, while you generally know what's coming, Erikson is such a great writer, that you find yourself reveling in the WAY the events are presented to you, and his diction. The feelings his writing evokes are new again; Yes, you know what's coming, but you'll feel like you did the first time reading it, every time. Honestly, it doesn't feel like a reread, it's more like reuniting with a lost love than it is watching reruns on a Saturday morning."
Malazan,3bxxf6,FUCKS_LIKE_A_VIKING,2,Fri Jul 3 03:22:43 2015 UTC,"To add to the comments that people have already supplied (all pretty much being the same reasons why I love rereading this series), there is more to the book(s) than just the story. I read somewhere that Steven stated he treated writing this series as an extremely long short story and so filled each sentence with as much information as he could. This isn't just information to foreshadow an up-and-coming plot line either, nor is it to set the scene - sometimes (at least I believe so), it is there to just inspire imagination in the reader and to set alight your curiosity as to what else might be occurring in this world.  But also, it is easier to appreciate the ""little"" things, the amazing descriptions (one that a friend sent through was: ""the sound the tool made was minimal, no more the shivering of a locust's leg"") and style of writing is easier to appreciate on the second read through.  Another thing that I love to do is look deeper into what Steven has written. There is a poem at the beginning of a chapter (I can't remember what book at this point) that goes (potential spoiler): Spoiler - this poem right here I spent a good 10 minutes mulling over, even just those last two lines brought much into perspective.  Rereads are amazing"

Malazan,3bwpl8,adamanderrake,2,Thu Jul 2 20:05:08 2015 UTC,"Pretty much what you said.  So all the Imass had been living with thousands of years of built up mental anguish and ennui over their existence and endless wars. Silverfox was supposed to let them die so they could be released from that. She  didn't because she was selfish, and tried to make them fight for the Malazans.   As Shield Anvil, Itkovian can take all their suffering and pain and guide their soul to his gods afterlife (afterlifes are very segmented in the malazan world). When he saw the Imass he wanted to do this for them, even though his God was no longer in power meaning he'd have no outlet for all he took in. So he basically took all their pain and anguish away and died because it was too much for him.  After this Silverfox realizes she was really being a selfish bitch and decides to grant them their deaths after all. But now that the Imass were pretty much mentally/spiritually rejuvenated from Itkovian's sacrifice, they want to go and save their clans dealing with some unknown shit in Assail before Silverfox does that.  I forget how or if the Mhybe thing comes into this."
Malazan,3bwpl8,adamanderrake,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:10:30 2015 UTC,Ok your second to last paragraph really helps make things clear.   Definitely still confused about the overall purpose of the Mhybe other than somehow being a vessel for Fanderay. But I already am someone who's not particularly fond of dream sequences (Kruppe can be grating that way as well).
Malazan,3bwpl8,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:20:58 2015 UTC,The Mhybe is the one dreaming the world her dream where she was in the realm of Fanderay and Togg is also the world where the Imass souls transport to in the end. When she's placed in the tomb through the help of Kruppe and Hood she's put in everlasting sleep where she and all the imass stay young and live out their lives as they would before they completed the Tellann ritual.
Malazan,3bwpl8,sillywillywillkilly,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:50:43 2015 UTC,She was actually trying to be altruistic in not releasing them not selfish. They wanted oblivion but she was creating a dream world where they could live in peace and happiness once again but it wasn't ready through out the book until near the end. She needed the Mhybe to be in eternal sleep when she was placed in the tomb to have the groundwork for the Imass dream world.

Malazan,3bwtxg,chrisanf,2,Fri Jul 3 06:31:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure. It's the way that Steven bespokes Dujek's entire presence - it's a completely loyal trust of his soldiers that helps him stand tall, but to also have a physically commanding presence as well."
Malazan,3bwtxg,sillywillywillkilly,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:19:36 2015 UTC,I find most of Yap's work fairly inaccurate and sexist. Like he has men in full plate armour and then women in armour that only covers their breasts. Most of his female characters are curvy and striking a provacotive pose. Most have a fairly large amout of cleavage. He pretty much ignores book descriptions and draws what he wants.   He drew Felisin and Tavore Paran as white and Ganoes Paran as black...

It sets a few things in concrete a little more, and also provides quite an insight into certain characters Spoiler and lays a bit more foundation of the Malazan world.   It's a fairly quick read, especially being the smallest book in that series - but if you are determined to forge ahead, you won't miss anything super relevant."
Malazan,3bxeyx,sillywillywillkilly,2,Fri Jul 3 01:32:07 2015 UTC,"To add on to this, following Ian's skill as a writer as he progresses through the series is actually really enjoyable as well. From Knight of Knives to Blood and Bone (haven't yet read Assail) it is amazing how detailed and enriching his writing has become. I could easily confuse him with Erikson by that point."
Malazan,3bxeyx,sillywillywillkilly,3,Fri Jul 3 03:58:29 2015 UTC,I'd read them in order honestly. Characters in NoK carry through to Stoneweilder and OST. But don't forget Forge of Darkness and the Bauchelin and Korbal Broach novellas!! Forge of Darkness is amazing and it will help that you've read the main series twice.
Malazan,3bxm3j,thekevmaester,3,Fri Jul 3 00:11:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah Rake let it happen ( he's the more skilled swordsman- he managed to end the fight killing himself, just the way he wanted.), Dassem was sad because he didn't get vengeance and because Rake died. I think Cotillion was trying to talk him out of it because it would break Dassem. An yeah its one of the best in the series."
Malazan,3bxm3j,mortal_sword,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:23:36 2015 UTC,What was Rake's plan if Ultor didn't show up or was he counting on that?
Malazan,3bxm3j,mortal_sword,4,Fri Jul 3 00:33:32 2015 UTC,"I think he was counting it, there are several reason to ensure Dassem would be there: 1. Hood was there, Dassem's goal in life. 2. Convergences draw forces; Ascendants actually feel a pull... it stans to reason Ultor would sense something insane was occuring. 3. Rake came quite late to Darujhistan who knows if Dassem ate some bad berries on the way, got the runs, had to stop halfway maybe Rake would kill Hood then fly back to Dassem. 4. In summation Ultor was the pivot of Rakes's plan because sacrifice having great power is a huge theme of the book. And the God of Sorrows failing in his vengeance with the death of the Son of Darkness being the main result is a huge sacrifice. Probably gave Rake a power up before entering Dragnipur. 5. Hypothetically I guess he could have  got Brood to do something if Dassem feel into a warren or got killed or soemthing?"
Malazan,3bxm3j,adamanderrake,3,Fri Jul 3 00:40:39 2015 UTC,"Rake Shadowthrone and Hood were all scheming for the breaking of the sword so they were all driving Dassem towards Darujhistan. I don't think #4 is very accurate besides the original point of him needing Ultor.  He in no way gained power by being killed by Ultor, I think he just used him as a person who he could trick into killing him and then be so broken emotionally from it that they wouldn't want the sword or its power which would give time for him to complete his task inside and then have it destroyed by Brood."
Malazan,3bxm3j,mortal_sword,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:57:43 2015 UTC,"That's makes sense, its a bit stupid questioning it I suppose. All Malazan book endings I've read so far are a bunch of stuff coming together nicely at the end, with Shadowthrone and Dancer coming out unscathed."
Malazan,3bxm3j,sillywillywillkilly,3,Fri Jul 3 00:56:09 2015 UTC,"To be honest I think its quite neat really and it seems like a chaotic mess of "" wait what...?"" but I think the reasons I listed make it pretty clear why what happened happened and showed it was well planned."
Malazan,3bxm3j,KevDrinksCorona,3,Fri Jul 3 00:58:22 2015 UTC,"If your version of a nice ending is having the Malazan army at Aren butchered in cold blood and Coltaine's army staked to crosses lining the entranceway to Aren, then I shudder to imagine what a horrific ending would be :P  Question everything in these books, but don't pass judgement until you've finished them at least once before (twice through and you will have a much greater understanding generally) - you will see why! That wasn't a criticism either, just advice :)"
Malazan,3bxm3j,mortal_sword,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:38:23 2015 UTC,"Cotillion wasn't trying to talk him out of it, he was encouraging Dassem to kill Rake. It needed to be done, and Dassem didn't want to do it."

He never really wanted to kill him and then he realized like most other times in his life he was forced into a path he didn't want to take and had killed and honorable man.  Hence why he is such a broken wreck emotionally immediately afterwards, and also why Karsa spits and is outraged and says Dassem was cheated."
Malazan,3bxm3j,adamanderrake,0,Fri Jul 3 23:53:34 2015 UTC,"That's what I meant...? And tbh swinging a sword at someone... you'd think the First Sword would know a consequence of sword fighting is that people can die during it? Dassem's no innocent, and the reason its torture for him and the point of it is that he wasn't forced... it was his obsessive need for revenge. No one forced Dassem he forced himself."
Malazan,3bxm3j,theodorferdinand,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:57:53 2015 UTC,"No because you can tell he didn't mean to kill Rake, not all sword fights end in death.

As far as any advice for Malazan, imo you just need to put yourself into the scene as an observer. I imagine I'm looking through a window into this world and have to deduce what's going on.   Thinking like this, of course there's going to be no exposition, and of course nobody is just going to explain their entire back story out loud, or describe exactly how warrens work."
Malazan,3bszas,teamnewg,2,Wed Jul 1 22:34:34 2015 UTC,"put yourself into the scene as an observer        Thats very good.  I had a feeling about that.  Kind of being a witness to certain events.  Or like a movie that begins abruptly without any explanation, only to be rewarded at the end.     Could it be compared to a non-linear story? Like in the spirit of pulp fiction where it begins abruptly into a unexplained scene?  Or saving private ryan, where you are just forced into omaha?"
Malazan,3bszas,Rnet1234,2,Thu Jul 2 01:09:44 2015 UTC,"Like in the spirit of pulp fiction where it begins abruptly into a unexplained scene?   I think you just described the beginning of GOTM, so yes.  But actually, that's a good way to think about it. And best of luck with the series. If you approach it in the right way, I'm sure you'll love it."
Malazan,3bszas,mmSNAKE,7,Thu Jul 2 06:36:46 2015 UTC,"First off I would try to understand what conceptions you have against fantasy. Before you even pick this up. This series is unlike anything out there and just blindly jumping in without at least some sort of expectations is well rather jarring.  Ok here is what I mean. Fantasy usually has something that other fiction does not. It has to build up it's world, people, cultures and most of all laws of physics that don't correspond to ours. In fiction that centers on our world the most you need to get comfortable with is change of scenery and cultures of specific geographical section.  ASOIAF has this but it still roots a great deal in medieval structure society that is somewhat similar to ours. A feudal system of management with more or less simple understanding of how things work. Sure there is some supernatural in there, and some magic stuff, but for large parts of it, it is the background and it isn't a necessary component to understanding how the world works.  This is where Malazan differs. It has concepts like Warrens, Deck of Dragons, ascension, convergence etc, that literally define reality for this fiction. Understanding this is as vital as understanding politics, philosophy, social structures as well as different races, evolution and so on.  In short it is far more complex in terns how much you need to take into consideration when you answer even some basic questions. Does that make the series overly difficult to read? No. And I repeat, no. Anyone with a good reading comprehension should not have a problem eventually figuring out this work and getting to the bottom of it, but it is not a process that is even. You won't get as much understanding of concepts in book one, as you would in book seven. You will always be learning, always be questioning and compiling information.  But again, before you even get to thinking more on this. I think your question should be ""what is it that I hate about fantasy?"". Because I can pretty much guarantee if you like ASOIAF even remotely, there is guarantee that you can find other work that will more than suit your fancy."
Malazan,3bszas,Nugle,5,Thu Jul 2 00:25:38 2015 UTC,"""This is where Malazan differs. It has concepts like Warrens, Deck of Dragons, ascension, convergence etc, that literally define reality for this fiction.

These are a really great straight up honest opinions I think I’ve been needing, and I think will be helping me in my initial approach to the series.           ""I think your question should be ""what is it that I hate about fantasy?""           This is so good. So after addressing these questions I think I may be able to determine if I need a couple of more fantasy novels under my belt before proceding.  Good stuff, thx so much!"
Malazan,3bszas,TheBananaKing,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:24:45 2015 UTC,"If you need more fantasy novels read some from Brandon Sanderson, its lighter than malaz and really entertaining"
Malazan,3bszas,wjbc,5,Sat Jul 4 12:08:43 2015 UTC,"Malazan presents four different challenges to readers:    Dense prose. If YA fiction like Hunger Games is lemonade and hotdogs, then Malazan is red wine and roquefort. It's very intense, very descriptive, and you can't just gulp it down. Going by your reading history, this will be the biggest challenge for you. There's also a rather broader vocabulary than is common, and it has a percentage of the population reaching for the dictionary every ten minutes.  Lots and lots of characters and viewpoints, switching every chapter. If you've got through ASOIAF, this shouldn't be hard for you - it just plays with a much larger deck and across more times / countries / species /etc. Some people find it difficult to keep track, and end up making a lot of reference to the dramatis personae, or even keeping notes.  Emotional exhaustion. Not to be taken lightly. I'm not a highly emotional person, and I've never cried at a sad movie, but this series left me wrung out like a rag. There are savage kicks in the feels on a regular basis, and absurd humour out of left field completely destroying your equilibrium, until you start laughing at the tragedy and crying at the jokes. It's like being beaten with a sock full of Latvian Jokes, pretty much. If you kept your equilibrium through all the horrible deaths in ASOIAF, then you're prepared for this, though.  No infodumps and no handholding. You do not know what's going on, you don't have enough information at the start to understand what the game even is, let alone what the rules are or who's winning. Nobody explains things ahead of time, or ensures that concepts are conveniently mentioned before they're used. You pick up stuff as you go along, and many things will make sense only in hindsight. The way to survive this is to treat it like you're an intern on your first day in the ER. (you've watched Scrubs, yes?) Just nod along and try to keep up, because you'll be doing the next one yourself. The days themselves will pass in a whirlwind, but you'll look back on the week and realize how much you've learned.    As such, it does have a wickedly steep immersion curve. It takes a good long run up to get through the first book, but once you get into Deadhouse Gates, it will start pulling you along. It does take commitment and effort to get into it, but once you're hooked it'll be hard work trying to stop. The writing definitely improves after the first book, too.   One thing to help make sense of the huge jumps in viewpoint: the central theme of the book is that power draws power - every conflict slowly snowballs up the hierarchy of power as everyone squabbles for scraps of advantage. The first five books more or less cover five different snowballs on five different mountaintops, all quietly tumbling towards one very doomed valley.   I have read a hell of a lot of SF and fantasy in my life, and this series outdoes them all. It does take more effort, but it pays off bigtime.   Now, if you need something halfway between ASOIAF and Malazan... hmm.   China Mieville is perhaps closest to the prose density and emotional wreckage, but personally I just find him too horrible to enjoy. He does tend to cover his books in grime and shit, and nothing ever ends well. Malazan is rough, but it has plenty of good among the bad.   The Black Company by Glen Cook provided a chunk of inspiration for the series, though it's very light and crispy by comparison. Definitely worth a read; it'll get you somewhat into the mindset for the military-sorcery angle, and some of the moral ambiguity. Malazan is pretty much this series multiplied by ASOIAF.   Dune by Frank Herbert is a good standalone book (there were sequels, but I hated them and choose to pretend they don't exist) that shares some of the complexity and depth and philosophical tone; if you consider yourself an intermediate reader, it might be a good stepping stone. Technically it's SF, but with very fantastic themes."

It has a lot of stuff I think you'd enjoy and some things you may hate. As for the philosophy or themes running through it, most of them are shallow enough to be noticeable, but deep enough to keep you ruminating on them at odd moments.   I think you should try it. Give the first three a go and you may end up having the time of your life."

Malazan,3bszas,TRAIANVS,2,Thu Jul 2 01:12:05 2015 UTC,"At the end of The Crippled God (final book in the series) I was left with so many questions. More than when I had finished Gardens of the Moon. But this was not detrimental whatsoever - in fact it made me hunger for more, so much so I started the series over again and realised how sly and sneaky Steven is in slipping hints and info throughout the books in such a way that you can't hope to understand it all without having read it once before.   I've found that the best way to appreciate and enjoy this series is to let yourself flow along the storyline as it is given. Don't stress about confusing scenes that seem to have no relevance and just enjoy them for what they are, a fantastic storyline that is both humourful and thought-provoking. Steven and Ian have a multitude of characters in their books, and sometimes you can go whole books without seeing or hearing from them, to only have them pop up in a later book causing you to see their name and think ""this sounds familiar, where have I heard that before?"" But even this is not detrimental as you can still enjoy the tale that they are involved in at that moment in time.   The moment I finished the Malazan Book of the Fallen I realised that I was hooked. But the moment I finished it the second time I would never enjoy another fantasy novel by any other author quite the same again.   If you loved tracking the bloodlines and travels and places of ASOFAI, then the history and lore of this series (and all other related ones - Steven is currently writing a new series that is near the beginning of the history of this world) then you will be set for life, or at least a good few years!  My advice? Enjoy each book as it's own and apply any knowledge from previous ones as you can, but don't be disheartened if you lose track or don't understand what it has to do with anything else. Each story is fantastic in it's own right, and you will see the second and third read throughs will give you even greater joy."

But this was not detrimental whatsoever...        That is very refreshing to hear.  Unsatiated curiosity that compels one to keep digging deeper and “geek out” more.  Wanting answers.  Its definitively been a driving force that caused me to want to understand the asoiaf world more and reach an a certain “enlightenment.“        Don't stress about confusing scenes that seem to have no relevance and just enjoy them for what they are...           This is a very reassuring opinion thats giving me more motivation given the total word count in the series.       I definitely never thought in my life I would be so interested in the histories and lores of any fictional world as I was of asoiaf.  It was a happy shock/accident I learned about myself, corny as it sounds.       Before it seemed pointless considering all the real life human histories there are. But real life history can be too academic and dry, and fictional storytelling is such a great escape and and so much more rewarding. Its a concept that I’m barely discovering and understanding. It was illuminating.       I hope I’ll stumble across more self-discovery as I make my shaky re-attempt at this series.  Thanks a bunch."

Malazan,3bszas,Eretnek,2,Thu Jul 16 05:22:55 2015 UTC,"Welcome! Here's my usual speech. Others who've seen this a zillion times need not read.  hands out complimentary Kleenex  Yes it is absolutely worth reading.  This sub has had a bunch of new readers lately and it's wonderful to see.  But its not for the faint of heart and the books are not your typical light fantasy type. Its dense, It's got a cast of hundreds, tons of plotlines, world building galore and it will make you laugh, cry, and cheer. Each book has an overall plot that contributes to the series as a whole, as you read them you connect all the dots and see the big picture the author is trying to achieve.  It is one of the pinnacles of epic literature fantasy in my opinion. It starts with Gardens of the Moon. It is finished, which is great, and there are multiple other side novels by Ian Esselmont. Erikson's writing style can be intimidating and hard to get into at first. You feel like you got dropped into a foreign country with no understanding of the language, customs, and who are all these people?! This is normal! Give it two or three books until you get used to Erikson's style. Personally it didn't click for me until near the end of book 1.   Remember the glossary at the back of the book and the dramatis personae are your friends. There is literally a cast of hundreds between all the books.  Erikson tends to not do info-dumps and can be heavy on the introspective philosophy. The first half of each book is usually character building, plot, history, etc, and the last quarter are when the epic craziness starts and next thing you know it's 4am in the morning and you have to work at 7am but you can't stop now. He wrote the first book 9 years before the second and it shows a bit, but he is an archeologist and an anthropologist so his world building skills are second to none. Every place a character visit feels ancient, every race you come across has an entire history to it, every millennia-old ascendant (powerful being) has several lifetimes of stories to tell.  You have to piece together the overall arching plot and other things, like how the magic system of warrens works, from clues and context of various characters and what you experience through the characters. It's all part of the fun, seeing how all this will fit together and where it's going. You go back and forth between continents and characters and the overall arching plot of the series only really becomes clear after book 5-6 and you and you get an astounding sense of the audacity and craziness and the scale and scope of what Erikson is trying to accomplish.  It's an amazing, wonderful, crying into the books, epic ride. It's even better on a re-read in its own way. Of course, no series is for everybody, so if you don't like it, at least give it through book 2 or 3, but no shame if it's not for you. I hope you enjoy it! If you have any questions about getting into the series post them here. We love newbies who are experiencing it for the first time. If you end up reading it and liking it and you have any questions we'll keep it spoiler free or tell you to read on! It's an amazing series, and definitely in my top 3 fave fantasy series.

Personally,  I didn't get every little nuance or subtle connection made but it is now my favorite series. Don't be intimidated even though it is heavy, just let it come to you and you'll be fine.   One thing that helped a lot was the Malazan Reread of the Fallen. They summarize and discuss every chapter of every book. There have been a few times where something will tickle the back of my mind, check the summary and it clicks. They're good about avoiding spoilers too. Goodreads has one as well but they don't discuss the chapter in scene order which can and has spoiled things for me."

Malazan,3bruct,SageOfTheWise,7,Wed Jul 1 20:43:43 2015 UTC,"Raest is very good, but you can't discount Hood, Gothos, and Haut.  They're are pretty fantastic."
Malazan,3bruct,sonofa2,5,Wed Jul 1 20:57:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah Gotho's garden was hilarious. Hood was amazing ( speaking of when he talks to Rake about reconsidering was that just Jaghut humor as well... if so Rake's next action really shows he doesn't appreciate it!) And Haut, not sure if I know that Jaghut ( I haven't finished OST or the next two ICE novels."
Malazan,3bruct,Ronnoula,4,Wed Jul 1 21:42:02 2015 UTC,"speaking of when he talks to Rake about reconsidering was that just Jaghut humor as well... if so Rake's next action really shows he doesn't appreciate it!   Yep, that was a joke."
Malazan,3bruct,Giotto,3,Wed Jul 1 23:33:57 2015 UTC,Thought so... haahahahhaa Hood such a legend. No shits given.
Malazan,3bruct,im_a_moose,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:02:00 2015 UTC,"Without giving spoilers, Haut is in Crippled God and Forge of Darkness. If you haven't read CG yet, I do recommend that before jumping into ""Blood and Bone"" and ""Assail."""
Malazan,3bruct,SiroccoSC,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:46:47 2015 UTC,"I read TCG I don't recall a Haut actually and i was gonna read FoD last.... Who was Haut, one of the fourteen?"
Malazan,3brafl,phathiker,7,Wed Jul 1 14:49:33 2015 UTC,"They  usually tell something related to the coming chapter, either related in content or in theme. Every once in a while they give relevant information about the past, and super rarely (like twice in the series) they give information about the future.  I read them."
Malazan,3brafl,SageOfTheWise,7,Wed Jul 1 15:12:57 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this. They're not in any way essential to read, but they do give you small bits of information that might help in your perception of the world. I particularly liked the one in HoC that talks about the Empire after the series, and how HoC chapter 19 epigraph  A couple of them are tedious as fuck, though. Like, multiple-paged poems. Screw that."
Malazan,3brafl,Oathsend,5,Wed Jul 1 15:37:02 2015 UTC,The Grub one was the only time I really felt satisfied spending my time on these excerpts. It was nice to meet finally meet Fisher after reading all his bs though.
Malazan,3brafl,andrewjackstoned,2,Wed Jul 1 18:10:56 2015 UTC,Usually I only read them if I saw it was written by one of the character in the series otherwise I think it won't harm you at all not reading them.
Malazan,3brafl,crazycakeninja,2,Wed Jul 1 23:55:43 2015 UTC,I found the one for chapter 17(I think) to be funny and relevant.
Malazan,3brafl,SHD1313,2,Thu Jul 2 03:47:31 2015 UTC,"I mostly stopped reading them, but there's one in MoI that gives some very useful foreshadowing about the fact that there are three different Tiste races."
Malazan,3brafl,DreamlordOneiron,2,Thu Jul 2 09:39:41 2015 UTC,"I find them all pretty useful. There's quite a bit of foreshadowing in many of the epigrams. Or the provide a detached perspective on events that no other character actually in the story can.   Example: Early on in GOTM there is a poem about how there were two cities left on Genabackis for the Malazans to conquer. One was proud, strong and unified in its opposition while the other was weak and riven with internal problems. The strong city fell first.   That immediately lets you know what the situation is going to be like in Darujhistan since its clear that Pale is meant to be the ""strong"" city. And you know that long before you actually get to the first scenes in Darujhistan."
Malazan,3brafl,madmoneymcgee,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:53:45 2015 UTC,"One of the chapter beginnings in GoTM is a conversation between Brood and Kallor from MoI.  It's the ""...you never learn"" one.  Always liked that."
Malazan,3bqgv6,sonofa2,17,Wed Jul 1 09:14:03 2015 UTC,He's got like super cancer. His entire body is has tumors in it. He negates it unknowingly because Oponn blesses him.
Malazan,3bqgv6,gathmoon,9,Wed Jul 1 10:50:25 2015 UTC,"This is the answer. Corabb is, in my opinion, the single most blessed by a god character."
Malazan,3bqgv6,TheHopelessGamer,14,Wed Jul 1 11:05:39 2015 UTC,Dude is Oponn's Mortal Sword.
Malazan,3bqgv6,gathmoon,6,Wed Jul 1 12:39:07 2015 UTC,Man even Gruntle doesn't have the same level of god tier blessing that Corabb gets. Fiddler has a line in reaper's gale (I think) about he thinks Corabb could stumble around and survive any battle.
Malazan,3bqgv6,NickofSantaCruz,6,Wed Jul 1 14:34:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, also when they were marching towards Letheras, Bottle said that Corabb has the Lady in his shadow and that he'll probably outlive all of them. TcG gave him the glory he deserved. :( [the book, that is]"
Malazan,3bqgv6,TheHopelessGamer,3,Wed Jul 1 15:49:01 2015 UTC,or perhaps he's the Shield Anvil whilst Hellion is the Mortal Sword
Malazan,3bqgv6,TocTheEternal,5,Wed Jul 1 17:52:38 2015 UTC,"I would say Hellion is the Destriant. Sure she doesn't have any Magic that we know of, but the drunken priest is too good a cliché to pass up."
Malazan,3bqgv6,CaptainUnusual,3,Wed Jul 1 19:02:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was amazed how he didn't die when he stopped that cusser (I think) with a plain helmet."
Malazan,3bqkqr,DreamlordOneiron,3,Wed Jul 1 10:11:58 2015 UTC,"The timeline seems a little inconsistent considering Harllo is 5 years old and was born after MoI, especially since we're following directly on from RG.   Yep, straight up inconsistency. There's a number of these in the series where the timeline is concerned, though normally they aren't as obvious as ""meet my 6 year old son I had 2 years ago.""   I am a bit baffled about where the Dying God came from, despite the explanation given, and I'm not entirely sure if he has anything to do with the Crippled God.   The two are unrelated. When there was the whole melding of people and minds back in GotM to create Silverfox, Bellurdan was cast off by the amalgamation as undeeded, and ended up in the abyss of chaos, where it met what was left of Hairlock and got the inspiration for making puppet bodies from him.   The whole assassination plot about the former Bridgeburners seems to have been left hanging - I never really got what Humble Measure's motive was meant to be apart from that it had something to do with the pickled Seguleh.   I was never a fan of how this was done in TTH. Really my only problem in what is otherwise my favorite book in the series (tied with TBH). All of that Humble Measure/Segulah stuff is set up for one of the side books, Orb Scepter Throne.   but the crippled T'lan Imass never seemed to actually go anywhere since he just ended up captured by the Azath.   I think that was the joke. Forshadowed as this big menacing thing, but then NOPE, Azath trumps all, as always.   have no idea why the moon exploded (something to do with the Jade Strangers?)   You're on the right track.   why were there ten Hounds of Light, anyway?   Are you asking why were they there, or why were there 10 of them?   I still don't know why Shadowthrone unleashed the Hounds on Darujhistan in the first place.    They were there as part of Shadowthrone's agreement with Anomander I believe as part of the group defending Dragnipur during the climax. Though it's been long enough at this point I can't remember if Shadowthrone tries to renege on the deal and take the sword for himself. (I do remember Iskarel Pust going rogue and trying to get it for himself, but not making it past Kruppe)."
Malazan,3bqkqr,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:10:35 2015 UTC,"Are you asking why were they there, or why were there 10 of them?   The latter, since the Deragoth and the Hounds of Shadow were both groups of 7."
Malazan,3bqkqr,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:35:17 2015 UTC,"There isn't enough info on what the Hounds of Light are and their origins to give an explanation. But remember that there are only 7 Deragoth because that's just how many were left when Dessimbelackis merged his souls with the remaining Deragoth. There are mentions of more than 7 hounds of shadow, and some of the hounds are other hounds kids, which implies there was a time where there were less as well. For example Doan is the offspring of Rood and Pallick, the latter is a hound that's never actually shown up in the books, just been mentioned."
Malazan,3bqkqr,Neffarias_Bredd,2,Thu Jul 2 15:18:14 2015 UTC,"Toll the Hounds was probably my favorite of the series despite all of the issues that you had with it. The ending is just so powerful. Telling the story through Kruppe does a great job of creating a melodramatic feel to everything that's going on.    I didn't understand a lot of what was going on outside of Darujhistan either on my first read but it made way more sense when I read through the series a second time. The side plot with the dying god is tied into the plot of Rake's sacrifice and Mother Dark's rebirth.    Good luck on Dust of Dreams, that was another one that was much improved the second time through. Dust of Dreams is really focused on moving everything into place for the Crippled God. I enjoyed it way more when I focused on the why of everything that was happening rather than the what (if that makes any sense)."
Malazan,3bq4ej,wjbc,3,Wed Jul 1 06:24:46 2015 UTC,"I imagine the ""Midnight"" is synonymous with the armies of the Edur and the ""Tides"" are the armies washing over everything they see, killing everything in sight. The Edur are a seafaring race after all. Who knows?  Glad you liked it. I hated it at first but now it's in my top 5 Malazan. Loved the tragedy of Rhulad, the hilarity of Tehol, Bugg and Shurq/Ubala. Brys and Trull are such wonderful characters. I loved the prologue as well. Such massive scale of the armies and Gothos to boot.   Congratulations, you've made it halfway through! All the plotlines and subplot lines will now sloooowly start to coalesce into a ""Convergence"" with a capital C in Dust of Dreams/Crippled God.   Onto Bonehunters, where you'll see what your wacky Bonehunter pals have been up to since the Whirlwind petered out, other characters plotlines pick up again, and of course, some new ones!    And, in Bonehunters, prepare to sweat. You'll see what I mean."
Malazan,3bq4ej,TriscuitCracker,3,Wed Jul 1 07:42:50 2015 UTC,"Ahh Midnight Tides is one of my favourite books in this series (I have ten favourite books in this series) and that is mainly due to the Lether and Tehol storyline, but also because we learn more about this ""new"" mysterious race of Tiste, the Edur.   One thing I've learned after reading through these books is that so many words and phrases have multiple meanings or hint at deeper traces of philosophical directions. The subterfuge in these books is not just in the plot and characters and places, but in the very words and phrases used. The title Midnight Tides refers to so many different things I believe - there's a nod towards Hannan's summoning near the beginning against the sealer's boats, there is the wordplay with the ebbing of tides and how the dominance of power flowing from one entity or group to another. Then there is the word Midnight that can hint towards the Tiste Andii, but also the fact that midnight is the twelfth hour and the Tiste Edur come into their race's twelfth hour (Rhulad's power and the direction he takes them, the Lether's curse of money, the crippled god and his puppet-strings) just to name a few.   I don't believe Steven would ever be blaise or reckless in choosing a title for his books.   I hope you know that this series only gets better as you read through. Enjoy :D"
Malazan,3bq4ej,sillywillywillkilly,2,Wed Jul 1 10:59:38 2015 UTC,"we still don't know why he was banished at the beginning of House of Chains.   Well, there is a bit more connecting tissue between the past and present story here, but I'd say now is a good time to go reread the HoC prologue, where Trull is shorn and his crimes talked about.   I'm still not exactly sure why it's called Midnight Tides.   You know... I'm not really sure either. There's a vague metaphoric mention of it in the narration near the end, but it didn't really mean much to me. Also in MoI, Paran talks to some Andii ghosts that warn him:   The Edur have sworn to destroy Mother Dark. You must warn him! Poisoned souls, led by the one who has been slain a hundred times, oh, ware this new Emperor of the Edur, this Tyrant of Pain, this Deliverer of Midnight Tides!   Foreshadowing what we'd learn in this book, but I believe it's the only time Rhulad is ever referred to that way."
Malazan,3boe6v,StephenElShaarawy,4,Tue Jun 30 21:01:26 2015 UTC,"Why does Silchas Ruin have white skin if he's Tiste Andii? A bit weird..   I think he's just albino.    I'm quite confused as to the Houses/Holds, this takes during GoTM if i'm not mistaken, there's a lot of holds/houses missing at the end of the glossary (High House Life? High House Shadow?) since its in another continent does that mean that houses/holds need to be built in those continents to have prevalence? Also why doesnt the Azath Hold exist post GoTM?    All these magic systems are geographically based. The Warrens don't exist in Lether. In the prologue, Gothos kind of freezes the continent in time with his ice magic, which is why the holds system is still around while the rest of the world has moved on to warrens, and why the dead have a tendency to not die in Lether.   Blue Rose are Tiste Andii, how did they get subjugated by the Letherii? One of the most powerful races..   This is what they're like without someone like Anomander to lead them.   Corlo says the Avowed (Iron Bars) objective is to return Prince K'azz to his lands (Kellanved's). I don't get the relation bewteen him and Kellanved, is he the the rightful air to the Malazan Empire or something? If so why did he side with Caladan Brood?   So K'azz was the Duke of some country in I believe Quon Tali before there was a Malazan Empire. When Kellanved came into power, K'azz's country was one of the many Kellanved took over when creating the Malazan Empire. After they were defeated by the Malazans, K'azz and his men made a pact to keep fighting the Malazans until they had their home back, which created the Crimson Guard. And for reasons you don't know yet, the pact also made these original members functionally immortal (theoretically until their pact is fulfilled).  So K'azz and his people were allied with Caladan Brood in GotM because they were fighting the Malazans."

You will slowly learn quite a bit more about the nature of ascendants and gods as the series progresses.   The way I understand it, Trake was an ascendant in the real world that had to die in order to become a god and take the place of Fener.   Based on what I know about other gods and their powers I'm not exactly sure how that works yet, but I'm not done with the series."

As I understand it, only gods have warrens.  There are other ascendants who are as nearly as powerful as gods but don't have warrens.  Trake was an ascendant but didn't have a warren until Fener was tossed out of his and left it vacant.  Even though he had already ascended as First Hero, Trake was dying when he ascended to godhood.  He transcended death by ascending to godhood, but I'm not sure happened to his physical body.  I suppose it either healed and went to the warren with his spirit or it died and he left it behind."
Malazan,3bn63d,wjbc,6,Tue Jun 30 16:46:02 2015 UTC,"Not to go against the grain here, but the only thing that I found unifying the ""Gods"" in this series is the fact that they have worshippers, who's worship gives them power. Their level of actual power varies drastically, and some non-""divine"" individuals are far more powerful than many lesser gods.  Some gods seem to be trapped in the ""material"" realm - crypts, azath houses, etc. Many reside in their own warrens, as traveling to the material realm leaves them supremely vulnerable.  This is why they often work through proxies (worshippers, agents, etc.). As far as communication goes, it seems many of the more powerful ""worshippers"" (high priests, etc.) are able to commune with their gods, if the god deigns to respond to their attempts at communication. Otherwise it often falls to some worshipper claiming to know the motivations of his god, just like in the real world.

Malazan,3bn63d,The_Voice_Of_Ricin,2,Tue Jun 30 17:15:53 2015 UTC,"I didn't say all gods have warrens.  But, as far as I can tell, only gods have warrens.  And regarding communications, I said it depends on the god.  Not all gods have worshipers.  Perhaps all of them had worshipers at one time, although I'm not even certain of that.  Did Trake have any worshipers when he became a god, or did he become a god and then get worshipers?  But there are forgotten gods who no longer have worshipers."
Malazan,3bn63d,wjbc,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:18:37 2015 UTC,The way I've taken to understanding it is that occupying a particular throne is what takes one from being an ascendant to being a god. Though that could be completely wrong. Considering how Trake becomes a god while dying is unexplained unless he was placed onto the throne by someone.
Malazan,3bn63d,Hortbek,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:37:17 2015 UTC,"Trake may have had some assistance from Togg.  He had visions of a wolf when he lay dying, IIRC, and the Wolf of Winter and the Tiger of Summer seem to have some sort of relationship, both as gods of war.  I don't think occupying a throne necessarily makes someone a god.  Thus, any mortal who sat on the First Throne could gain control of the T'lan Imass."

Malazan,3bn63d,Hortbek,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:50:36 2015 UTC,"She predicted it, but no, I don't think she played any part in it.  She said she had no power to help, only to kill.  But she remarked that there must have been another power that awakened Treach/Trake from his beasthood, and just before she arrived Treach/Trake had a clear vision of a one-eyed wolf which awakened all within him.  I think that was a vision of Togg, one-eyed because he is inhabiting the body of Toc."

They did X to become ascended to Y, and now they have worshipers because it is something the High Priests tel the populace.

That being said, it just wasn't as well written.  It was good, competent writing, but nothing that made me set the Kindle down and go ""wow, did I just read that?""  And I felt no desire to read it again, whereas in the main series I am reading each book twice because I enjoy them that much and get so much out of a second reading.  I have no suggestions for persuading your brother to continue.  Sometimes I have a hard time reading anything recommended to me, it feels too much like a homework assignment no matter how good the book might be.  And I know nothing about your brother, so I don't know how to appeal to him.  Here's a wild idea, though.  Maybe he should read Bauchelain and Korbal Broach: Three Short Novels of the Malazan Empire before continuing with the main series.  Maybe they will convince him Erickson knows what he is doing and it's worth sticking with the main series, which is essentially one very long novel."

He wasn't signed for a 10 book deal to begin with so I can't fault him for not writing with that large of a timeline in mind when he began that book. From his POV I'm sure he never imagined he would get the chance to write 9 other books and have them all published lol most Authors barely get one book picked up let alone 10 plus a prequel and group of short stories.  As someone who has read everything within the Malazan universe that has been published if I could give one piece of advice it would be too not get to worried with timeline issues and remembering every minor character and detail from the previous book because it's impossible on your first read thru lol your definitely gonna get lost and confused at some points but as you go thru the series and piece together parts of the whole story it starts to make sense, kind of....lol"

So, my guess is that Envy didn't look down and a fight ensued. She magicked the hell of of the three of them, essentially charming (literally) them into service. So it's not that she was painting it into a victim story, just that she wasn't aware of their social rules and they attacked her because of it. She's also so aloof in her power that she assumes , just like the segulah, that  people should automatically capitulate to her will."
Malazan,3bg3yd,wazir,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:03:18 2015 UTC,"I read ROTCG actually and yeah you have to be subservient but it doesn't apply to women, Lanas Tog is not subservient at all. For them the rules are different for men and women."
Malazan,3bg3yd,KevDrinksCorona,2,Mon Jun 29 01:08:06 2015 UTC,Hmm I'm not sure I noticed that. There are Seguleh women and I imagine they would not care who stared them down. but now that you mention it I can't remember a Segulah vs woman staredown. I remember when the seguleh went to travellers temple one of them challenges a lady and got whooped though.
Malazan,3bg3yd,KevDrinksCorona,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:24:25 2015 UTC,"It is mentioned in the Malazan Wikia that Seguleh do not fight women unless attacked. It's mentioned in Malazan Book of the Fallen (I forget where) that Seguleh women make a choice when they come of age as to whether they want to become part of the warrior society or live seperate to it. If they choose the latter, they may never be challenged."
Malazan,3bg3yd,KevDrinksCorona,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:59:53 2015 UTC,So most likely Envy took control of them without provocation.
Malazan,3bg3yd,end_O_the_world_box,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:52:13 2015 UTC,"That seems likely, though Mok was travelling the same way as Envy anyway - to the Panion Seer. He and his brothers also disobey Envy (in order to duel with Tool), so it's likely that the Seguleh were content with pretending to be under her control, for the most part. Obviously Envy is a very powerful mage, so I doubt they'd have wanted to fight her regardless."
Malazan,3bg3yd,end_O_the_world_box,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:58:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah they were going the same way but later in OST its mentioned Mok is destroyed from his experiences... this confuses me, what exactly got to him? The cannibalism, getting beat at the end or maybe it was Envy constantly knocking him out and controlling his mind which if so is pretty sick."

It was really good, but didn't have the epic convergence that the second and third had. Midnight Tides may frustrate you at first, as it occurs before even Gardens of the Moon and is a completely new case, barring Trull. Push through it though, as it may be my favorite in the entire series. DG and MOI hold a special place in my heart, as they were the books that made me fall in love with not only Malazan, but reading once again. In my opinion, it continues to get better. Thank you for your thoughts, I think I can speak for everyone here and say that is why we keep coming back, even after finishing."

Malazan,3bfqnp,ChaosBrat,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:59:04 2015 UTC,"I know it would necessarily simplify the world, but given Magic's history with some really cool narratives and characters (Eron the Relentless, the Rathi tribes, etc.), I think it would be really neat.  And not hugely difficult to do, either.  Some friends of mine and I used the Heroscape system as the framework for a similar idea, importing characters from various media to compete in a sort of miniature tactics game.  The flavor of the characters was preserved while staying within the bounds of the system foundation."
Malazan,3bf2ij,ZubKhanate,18,Sun Jun 28 17:22:39 2015 UTC,"If we can ignore the general issues like there just not being a market for a serious epic animated fantasy, and that they would never realistically have the creative control to tell a story as weirdly structured as Malazan, animated would be a really good format for it."
Malazan,3bf2ij,SageOfTheWise,0,Sun Jun 28 17:49:07 2015 UTC,"Been saying this for ages. In an ideal situation - there would be a demand for it and enough people doing the animation, music and voice acting. It would be perfect.   I have to specify anime instead of western animation just because the actual animation in western animation tends to be better (less still frames). And also anime creators, in my opinion, seem to tell a better story. Which Malazan needs."
Malazan,3bf2ij,PromisedPrince694,2,Sun Jun 28 19:07:24 2015 UTC,"Not to mention, in my opinion, western animation that isn't in a movie or high budget, looks absolutely atrocious and I can barely watch it for the other content. Except for Archer. That show is perfect the way it is."
Malazan,3bf2ij,Morghus,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:59:59 2015 UTC,"Archer is rotoscoped, that's why it's so convincing and consistently animated."
Malazan,3bf2ij,OIPROCS,5,Sun Jun 28 22:42:30 2015 UTC,"The artwork would need to be amazing. Without the words to describe the intensity of the series, you would need one hell of a good art team. I don't know if CGI would be better than animated. It's tricky because of the huge variation in scenes. Anything highly detailed and gritty while being visually stunning would be perfect. It is a tall order though and would be a huge project."
Malazan,3bf2ij,Sir-Francis-Drake,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:03:59 2015 UTC,I would love to see a Malazan anime in the style of Peter Chung (Aeon Flux). I love his character design and his work on the Riddick short was nothing short of beautiful and breathtaking.
Malazan,3bf2ij,volz_rocksti,3,Thu Jul 2 20:01:04 2015 UTC,I've always thought the best visual medium for this world would be a graphic novel. Reading the graphic novel adaptations of the ASOIAF books solidified it for me.
Malazan,3bf2ij,1ce9ine,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:30:58 2015 UTC,I have been thinking that a visual novel might be the cheapest and most succesful ways to bring new fans to the crowd and if it becomes popular there can be other adaptations.
Malazan,3bf2ij,HighCrawler,2,Mon Jun 29 11:26:35 2015 UTC,"Yea it could be done either as an anime or a show like GoT (the cost would be more thrn any other show/movie).   If it were an anime it would work pretty well if people got into it. There would probably need to be lots of internal dialogue, narration (maybe), exposition, and recaps. All in all anime would be the most workable format."
Malazan,3bf2ij,Aiolus,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:36:21 2015 UTC,"Yess, its basicly Fate series on steroids!!! And I don't think that a show like GoT will do it, because many of the fans will just say it is crappy GoT rippoff... But in the Anime it is normal to see a fantasy epic battles and complicated plots :D"
Malazan,3bf2ij,HighCrawler,2,Mon Jun 29 11:24:48 2015 UTC,"I fear the internal monologues and deeper intentions will fall away a bit, which means you lose a lot of what sets Malazan apart from generic fantasy.  If they find a way to incorporate that it could be done, but it seems like a tough task."
Malazan,3bf2ij,Montaron87,2,Sun Jun 28 17:48:23 2015 UTC,I feel that some animated series have a lot of internal dialogue and exposition. I am watching Naruto Shippuden and I noticed that there is a lot of internal monolgue and detail given through conversation that I personally enjoying hearing and learning about. Maybe I am just really patient....
Malazan,3bf2ij,TriscuitCracker,5,Sun Jun 28 18:14:28 2015 UTC,"I always thought it could work on HBO as an animated series. I'm afraid they'd have to whittle down the cast to nowhere near the number of characters we have today. Plus the philosophical parts may be diminished. It'd have to be adult and intelligent. Maybe in the style of Avatar: The Last Airbender animation/style or something along something more mature-like, like something out of the DC animated universe movies or Hulk vs Wolverine.  They'd have to do 10 seasons or more, one or two seasons per book to squeeze it all in."
Malazan,3bf2ij,Storm-Of-Aeons,2,Sun Jun 28 19:27:56 2015 UTC,I've seen a lot of people on here suggest an animated series. I honestly just have no interest in anime and would not watch it. I would be fine with live action and don't see why it couldn't be possible.
Malazan,3bf2ij,volz_rocksti,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:30:47 2015 UTC,"I think a popular hang-up with a live-action adaptation is the sheer volume of casting and the fact that, as the show goes on, it would be hard to hide the aging of the actors. With how dense each book is (and if this hypothetical series is as faithful as we'd like it to be), I think the actors would age far more rapidly than their characters. Additionally, many roles would be put on hold for long periods of time (i.e. Whiskyjack during all of DG) and keeping actors on a retainer like that can be costly and unrealistic.  But don't get me wrong, a live action of this universe (we can dream!) would be bad ass!"
Malazan,3bf2ij,shimshimmaShanghai,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:04:55 2015 UTC,"If you can put up with subtitles I highly recommend putting in the time for a few anime shows.   It really stands out in both highly violent and deeply contemplative situations. Live action has to be really high budget to compete, especially when a series has so many species / characters, the costume and cgi budgets for a quality show would probably be enough to cover the entire series animated.   Check out Samurai Champloo, its a really great introduction to anime, and its not too long (24 episodes.) It shows just what anime can achieve in terms of emotion, action and comedy."
Malazan,3bf2ij,HighCrawler,0,Mon Jun 29 02:16:13 2015 UTC,"I would recomend Psycho-Pass because of it's plot and no fansurvise, but it is sciense-fiction and if it is not to your liking i can understand.   My favorite fantasy anime is Berserk and you could try it too.  The main thing about anime is getting used to its art style and not to hit the garbadge popular ones. And there is another thing that if you want a real combat depiction you have to look at anime as Skallagrim said in his The most realistic weapons / armor / fighting, in an ANIME??, well the title speaks for itself..."

Malazan,3bguwq,bartonar,6,Mon Jun 29 02:46:06 2015 UTC,"Dragnipur wasn't actually fully completed at the time of the first Chaining, iirc. There is also a couple reasons why having tCG inside Dragnipur would be a VERY BAD IDEA, but they're kind of spoilery.  Not sure about Draconus never escaping from Dragnipurs warren, though. It's possible he felt guilty about creating it."
Malazan,3bguwq,Oathsend,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:52:52 2015 UTC,"I mean, I was kinda thinking that having him in the sword, either he'd figure out to escape, or he'd poison Darkness rather than Burn... but as far as I'm aware, the people chained are essentially impotent... except the Hounds weren't, because they nearly toppled the wagon.   Following that train of thought leaves me wondering whether I'm greatly underestimating the Hounds, or overestimating things like Imperial demons, Jaghut tyrants, Kallor (he does fear the blade, at least, which should imply that it's stronger than he), and the like.  Semirelatedly, when K'rul and Envy talked, they mentioned that Dassem Ultor's daughter was used in the Chaining, which led to his falling out with Hood... but I was under the impression that Dassem was Knight of Death after the Empire's founding... what's up with that?"
Malazan,3bguwq,Oathsend,2,Mon Jun 29 04:05:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think he'd be able to escape, but yeah, poisoning Darkness would probably come into it somewhere.  The Hounds aren't especially powerful, it just happens that they were the newest residents of Dragnipur, meaning they had been pulling the wagon for much less time than the other residents. Pretty much everyone would fear Dragnipur if they understood what it does. Realistically, Kallor isn't that powerful. He's just a mortal that happens to be immortal.  There has been multiple Chainings of tCG, with at least two being mentioned. Dassem was Knight of Death up until the most recent Chaining, and renounced Hood afterwards. That Chaining probably only happened a decade or so before the books, since Cotillion and Shadowthrone were also present."
Malazan,3bguwq,Storm-Of-Aeons,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:18:25 2015 UTC,"I've definitely been overestimating Kallor, if that's all he is. I mean, he used to be such a powerful tyrant that people thought it would be a good idea to forcibly drag some other world's god into it to try to get rid of him, and the Crippled God (or Gethol) thinks so highly of him he was offered the role of High King of House Chains, but I suppose some hundred thousand years of experience might just do all that.  There being many Chainings makes a lot more sense, I'm not sure how I missed that"

Malazan,3bd9b1,nieud,7,Sun Jun 28 03:53:09 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't really call him a villain. An antagonist, maybe, but overall he was just an idiot who was easily influenced by Mallick Rel. But I agree, I'm glad he's dead."
Malazan,3bd9b1,WeDoTheWeirdStuff,6,Sun Jun 28 05:26:52 2015 UTC,he was just an idiot   This. So much this.
Malazan,3bd9b1,volz_rocksti,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:19:04 2015 UTC,He's dead because even the bad guys couldn't stand being around that scummy piece of shit.
Malazan,3bcqr5,rosshm16,19,Sat Jun 27 23:56:33 2015 UTC,"If you've read GotM and DG multiple times and still don't get what's going on, nor are really enjoying the story, it might be time to give up. While more stuff is explained in later books, a lot more stuff is introduced and you never really get the full picture laid out for you. That being said, if you're willing give MoI a shot. Personally I think that the series is one of the best crafted and well thought out worlds/stories. But Erikson will not and does not spoon feed the reader and many things don't become clear until rereads/ discussions/much rumination, if at all.  Tl;Dr if you're not enjoying it, find something else you do like, there is plenty of awesome books out there. But maybe, just maybe, stick it out and read one hell of an epic saga."
Malazan,3bcqr5,Anonymous_Bonehunter,5,Sun Jun 28 00:41:20 2015 UTC,"You finished Deadhouse Gates and you got nothing from it? You can try MoI, and I would recommend it. I just don't see how it could be so confusing that through the whole book you didn't become attached to any of the characters. If by the end of MoI you're still not liking it, it's probably time to put it down. Maybe give it some time and come back and the information you gained the first time around will help you to better follow the plot."
Malazan,3bcqr5,Storm-Of-Aeons,2,Sun Jun 28 01:45:42 2015 UTC,"Where did I say I ""got nothing from it"" (not even sure what that means) or ""didn't become attached to any of the characters""?  I'm not attacking or criticizing anyone who likes the books, I wish I did too and am trying to.  My issue is that I struggle to keep track of what's going on with the very dense plots and cast of characters, and am not enjoying the lack of exposition.  These seem to be things that most people enjoy about the series so maybe it is just not for me.  I do plan on at least giving MoI a chance though."
Malazan,3bcqr5,VordakKallager,9,Sun Jun 28 02:04:14 2015 UTC,"The plot gets more dense and entangled and the cast of characters expands by quite a lot. If it feels like the world Erikson is crafting is too big after just the first two and it's significantly hampering your ability to enjoy the read, I would recommend moving on to something else."
Malazan,3bcqr5,Oathsend,3,Sun Jun 28 02:55:34 2015 UTC,"If you enjoy the series despite the fact that you don't fully understand the events happening, I'd recommend that you keep reading. That happens to a lot of people the first time around.  If you're not enjoying the books, and are just continuing to read in the hope of hitting some point where you'll understand everything and start enjoying it, you might want to put the books down."
Malazan,3bcqr5,TRAIANVS,3,Sun Jun 28 02:59:08 2015 UTC,If it's exposition that you feel is lacking then MoI might be more to your liking. It has tons of exposition (at least compared to the series in general) and is pretty straight-forward as these books go.
Malazan,3bcqr5,Storm-Of-Aeons,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:51:27 2015 UTC,Whoa I think I came off too harshly. I wasn't implying that you were attacking anything. Your reaction the books seemed to be that you did not enjoy it at all. It's not a big deal not all books are for everyone. I'm just very surprised because Deadhouse Gates is a very intense book.
Malazan,3bcqr5,Doomaise,3,Sun Jun 28 03:11:13 2015 UTC,"I'm part way through DG, and only read 15-30 minutes a night (at best) before bed.  So I end up having to stop quite frequently in random spots where it becomes difficult to pick back up and remember what was happening.  How I've overcome this so far is by reading the TOR reread (link to this is on the sidebar).  I only read the chapter summary and then Amanda's 'read' through.  Bill is doing a re-read and his section contains spoilers so stick to just the top (Amanda's) section.  This really helps to get a clear understanding of what's what, and who's who.    That's my best advice to you."
Malazan,3bcqr5,DarrenTPatrick,2,Sun Jun 28 02:24:02 2015 UTC,Agreed.  The TOR re-read is an excellent guide and does help with the challenging parts of the read.
Malazan,3bcqr5,thebeginningistheend,3,Mon Jun 29 13:32:13 2015 UTC,Malazan is high fantasy on hard mode.
Malazan,3bcqr5,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:06:37 2015 UTC,"Well hey, no series is for everybody. If the writing style isn't for you, then no shame in putting the book down. I'd give Memories of Ice a go however, it's the book where you start to see where the main plotlines take off and you start to see the larger scale and scope and just what the heck Erikson is doing. It goes back to Genebackis and the characters from Gardens of the Moon with a few from Deadhouse Gates thrown in.  If you have any questions currently or in the future or have trouble following please ask us or you may want to try using the Tor- Reread of the Fallen in the sidebar, it summarizes chapter by chapter what's going on and was very helpful to many of us the first time around reading. If you do, stick with Amanda's point of view, she's the newbie reader, Bill is the re-reader and spoils things a little.   But again, no shame at all if you decide to put it down, and kudos for making it this far!"
Malazan,3bcqr5,gogomom,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:46:56 2015 UTC,"The Malazan world is dense - I describe it as military fantasy on steroids.  It has a cast of thousands, hundreds of locations (some not even real), several dozen sentient species, and confusing magic...    I read all of Memories and didn't know if I was going to keep going, read Deadhouse and kind of started to get the plot, even if I still couldn't keep the characters all straight.  It really wasn't until I got to Midnight Tides (my favorite so far) that I actually started to love this series....  now I'm only a few pages from finishing Dust of Dreams, and I've already got The Crippled God sitting waiting for me.  IDK - I will fully admit that this series has taken me longer to read than any other books or series - ever.  It's been 7 months, and I'm still not through - I finished the GoT series in just over a month."
Malazan,3bbw91,Karsa__,11,Sat Jun 27 19:13:03 2015 UTC,"What I have always been most affected and inspired by with Eriksons books are the examples of self sacrifice that occur. Often not noticed or elaborated to those whom it ultimately affects the most, which to me seem to make the sacrifice all the more poignant. Frustrating to read sometimes because you dont get the emo porn that comes from the satisfaction of seeing everyone appreciate the sacrifices that occur.  Erikson way of storytelling transcends beyond the actual story, and becomes deeply emotional, and to each reader probably touches on various life experiences that they can draw from to add depth to what they are reading.  While I like Esslemonts books, I do not think that he writes the same way. I think you could read Esslemont as a 15 yr old, and get about the same value for your money as you do at 30. I dont think that is the case for Erikson. Which leads me to state that Esslemont has even less of an underlaying message. He ""just"" wants you to enjoy his story."

Malazan,3bbw91,makfreeman,3,Sun Jun 28 05:45:11 2015 UTC,"I loved the philosophy of Eriksons books. As for ICE, I don't think he really tried to portray a specific message. Honor, friendship, battling against the odds, etc are all in his books."
Malazan,3bbw91,Aiolus,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:07:30 2015 UTC,"I don't agree that Erikson's underlying message is compassion.  Yes, there are remarkable examples of compassion.  But there are also remarkable examples of ruthlessness, often from the same characters who previously or subsequently show such compassion.  The compassion stands out all the more for its rarity.  And often it's temporary in nature, quickly fading, never to be seen again."
Malazan,3bbw91,wjbc,6,Sat Jun 27 20:35:26 2015 UTC,"The compassion stands out all the more for its rarity   I think thats the reason people consider it to be one of the major themes/messages. In a dark/gritty fantasy settingn such as the world of Malazan, the few acts of kindness and their intent lets us glimpse into a side of the human being which is neglected or forgotten in most brutal and ruthless depictions of a world like ours; empathy/compassion."
Malazan,3bbw91,HumbleAsFudge,0,Sun Jun 28 00:33:43 2015 UTC,So much this.
Malazan,3bbw91,Waylandyr,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:42:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed. This is why it's a major theme.  If anyone here disagrees with me, feel free to start your own text post about your thoughts. As for this thread, let's just try to answer the actual question."
Malazan,3bbw91,tjordi,3,Wed Jul 1 19:24:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think like Cook, he depicts more of a human aspect to his characters.  They're all flawed, some in significant ways, but they continue on because they have nothing else to do.  I always got more of a redemption motif from Erikson.  A lot of character seem to be attempting to atone for past misdeeds.   That's just me, beautiful thing about books, ask 25 people get 25 answers."
Malazan,3bbxip,Eretnek,13,Sat Jun 27 19:24:01 2015 UTC,Try The Black Company by Glen Cook. It's pretty much Erikson's main inspiration for Malazan. I believe one of the Malazan books is even dedicated to Cook.
Malazan,3bbxip,SageOfTheWise,2,Sat Jun 27 19:40:33 2015 UTC,All of Cook's books are great and some are short stories if you don't want a long series.

Malazan,3bbxip,TriscuitCracker,7,Sat Jun 27 20:17:32 2015 UTC,"Prince of Nothing series by R. Scott Bakker. Very complex world building very different than most fantasy universes and cast of many. Fascinating magic system and many cultures to learn about like Malazan.  Heroes Die by Matt Stover.  It's really good.  (Copied from Wikipedia)- The novels are set in a future dystopia Earth where a parallel world called Overworld reminiscent of the worlds featured in post-Tolkien secondary world fantasy has been discovered. The corporations that run Earth send actors into Overworld in order to provide the masses of an overcrowded world with virtual-reality entertainment.  Hari Michaelson is a famous Actor and son of a now-mentally ill libertarian professor. On Overworld, he is the assassin Caine, while his estranged wife Shanna is another Actor playing the mage Pallas Ril. In this world Actors are people who travel to Overworld through advanced technology and assume an alternate persona which they then use to carry out 'adventures'. Pallas is captured by Ma'elKoth, the Emperor of Overworld's human kingdom of Ankhana on one of her adventures. Ma'elKoth's plan to rule Ankhana by wiping out a final resistance group, is blocked by a spell that causes others to forget the existence of the resistance group's members. The remainder of the book plays out the conflict between Ma'elKoth, Caine and the resistance. Hari finds himself manipulated by both the powers on Overworld and the Studio on Earth, and must defeat them both in order to save himself and Pallas Ril from death.  Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe.- this is one of the more unique series I've ever read. The narrator is notoriously unreliable and much of the book seems like a dream. Very otherworldly and the sense of wonder is palpable. The main character is a torturer by trade and he commits one of the greatest sins a torturer can do.  The sin of Mercy. So now he's exiled and out into the wide world for mystery/adventure, and wherever the world takes him and who he meets.   Joe Abercrombie's the First Law Trilogy. Great characters, gory as hell, it's like Sanderson on bath salts. Also there is a great wizard character that is about as anti-Gandalf as can be, and a barbarian who rivals Karsa in his awesomeness. Plus a former knight who is totured for years becomes a bitter (yet humorous in a sarcastic way) torturor himself.   EDIT: Sage already said Black Company, also a great series."
Malazan,3bbxip,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:01:27 2015 UTC,"I can't recommend Heroes Die enough. The series is great in general, but the last book in the series specifically is one of the greatest books I've ever read."

Malazan,3bbxip,Montaron87,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:19:56 2015 UTC,The Prince of Nothing series has a very good magic system imho. I found it easier to grasp and accept then Eriksons warrens while still being complex and diverse between different schools and factions.
Malazan,3bbxip,tehsing,4,Sat Jun 27 22:14:49 2015 UTC,"Should I try JRRR Tolkien? I am afraid I won't be able handle the grammar in his books   Just to clarify, but you enjoy fantasy and have yet to read Lord of the Rings? Regardless, yes you should read one of the most complete and iconic fantasy series out there.  And the writing style is completely different, but I'm a huge fan of David Eddings, basically because he is both incredibly funny and he uses some cool tricks in some of his books that make them interesting from a technical writing perspective."

Malazan,3bbxip,wastedcleverusername,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:51:25 2015 UTC,I think if you made it through Malazan you shouldn't have trouble with Tolkien.  You're probably a more competent reader of English than most people that I know.

Malazan,3ba0ik,SomeGuy1297,15,Sat Jun 27 05:20:31 2015 UTC,"My friend recommended it to me after I finished reading A Dance With Dragons.  He said it'd give me something to read while I waited for the next ASOIAF book to come out.    I finished The Crippled God last month after three years (taking breaks between each book to read something else), and was utterly amazed by the series from beginning to end.  I was reading the Malazan books through four jobs, two relationships, moving to a different part of town, and a complete turnover in my social group.  It was kind of the only constant in my life for a while.  And now, all this time later, I'm finally done, and George R. R. Martin is still writing The Winds of Winter.  Well, fuck you, George, I found something much better."
Malazan,3ba0ik,Explodian,4,Sat Jun 27 10:02:01 2015 UTC,This is my story as well. Finished A Dance With Dragons then googled a fantasy book similar to ASOIAF. I'm just about to finish up The Bonehunters and am just amazed with the story so far!

I started reading them immediately since I was between quarters at school. It took me about a year to get through the series because of finals and other projects. Planning on re-reading them now.

I finished up A Song of Ice and Fire a couple weeks later and began my first reading of it a little over 2 years ago. I have since read it twice and have been contemplating a 3rd.

Anyway, my roommate had a lot more time on his hands than I did. A few days later I got home from work and he asked me if I would order the books online from Canada if he gave me cash.

Anyone who got in on that on the ground floor know my pain.
Malazan,3ba0ik,ElectricMarmalade,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:03:23 2015 UTC,"Amazon says I purchased gardens of the moon and the next 3 books in the series in 2008. When I look at the orders I made prior to that, its Robin Hobbs Liveship traders and Soldiers Son trilogies o.O which I cant imagine lead me to Malazan, so going 2 months further back I find - yep, George Martin and the first 3 books of a Song of Ice and fire..  Oddly enough, today I have bought everything in the Malazan universe by both ICE and Erikson, but I never got the rest of the Song of Ice and Fire books. Probably had forgotten the story by the time 2011 rolled around :/  So one of the Martin purchases had a Malazan book listed in suggestions. And off I went."
Malazan,3ba0ik,Montaron87,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:45:42 2015 UTC,"Having read both The Lord of the Rings and A Song of Ice and Fire, I subscribed to /r/fantasy for more recommendations.  Malazan seemed to be exactly my cup of tea: a massively complicated world, a huge cast of characters, and no intrusive exposition.  I'm nearly done Gardens of the Moon now, and it's been phenomenal.  There are so many great characters like Kruppe, Whiskeyjack, Quick Ben and Toc the Younger, and not one storyline I don't find interesting.  I'm a newer subscriber to this subreddit, and obviously I'm careful about which threads I click.  Even so, it's helped me a lot with understanding the world of these books."
Malazan,3b889x,hunter8306,14,Fri Jun 26 19:31:15 2015 UTC,"From my understanding of it, the reason everyone was marked except for Tavore was because everyone else had a specific role to play for the various gods and houses. I don't remember who was marked as what so this analysis might be slightly off in the details, but I think Quick Ben was marked as Magus of Shadow, meaning that High House Shadow was somehow acting through him, or had goals very closely aligned with his goals. Kalam was, I believe, Assassin of High House Death, meaning that he was going to murder a lot of people that Hood specifically wanted dead.  Tavore, on the other hand, wasn't acting out any god's wishes. She was forcing the gods' hands, not the other way around. She has no patron, no protector or divine supporter. She's just a mundane, determined woman, and cares nothing for the gods' wishes or favors.   It was significant because, in a gathering like that, there were a lot of very powerful, very influential people, all of whom were marked or favored by some god or other, and all of whom were following the leadership of one unremarkable, uncontrollable woman."
Malazan,3b889x,CaptainUnusual,6,Fri Jun 26 23:02:53 2015 UTC,QB was named Magus of High House Dark.
Malazan,3b889x,Quickben33,2,Sat Jun 27 04:44:16 2015 UTC,"Ah, close enough. Like I said, I didn't remember the specifics, but the general reason is the same.  But seriously, why dark?   Edit: huh, just noticed your user name. I suppose if anyone would know, it'd be you."
Malazan,3b889x,CaptainUnusual,6,Sat Jun 27 04:53:11 2015 UTC,"Isn't it strongly implied that one of his souls is Tiste Andii? If so, there's the connection with Dark."

Malazan,3b9a3y,mortal_sword,7,Sat Jun 27 00:48:49 2015 UTC,You kind of get a pass on the whole brooding thing when you are the unwilling literal embodiment of tragedy.

Malazan,3b9a3y,BioChemistryStudent,3,Sat Jun 27 01:51:57 2015 UTC,I took it as a Joke on Erikson's part that the lord of tragedy is such a let down and nothing seems to go his way.
Malazan,3b9a3y,Aiolus,5,Sat Jun 27 04:03:11 2015 UTC,I quite liked Dassem. He is sorta an embodiment of tragedy. He's a tortured and tormented soul with a mission. Not the most charismatic persona.   Rake respected the hell out of that man :-)
Malazan,3b9a3y,Aiolus,3,Sat Jun 27 01:27:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know Rake and others respected him, its part of my problem with him. He's all legend with no substance... like what's so great about him, that he's a tragedy? I mean if tragedy on its own is worthy of respect you'd think people would respect the hell out of Kallor."
Malazan,3b9a3y,nandanvora,6,Sat Jun 27 01:51:55 2015 UTC,He is the single greatest swordsman alive give or take a Rake. He was the first sword. He helped form the empire. All of his feats are from the past. We get very few inspiring new feats.   Also you did ask about ICE and we do get some stuff from him.
Malazan,3b9a3y,Aiolus,2,Sat Jun 27 01:54:21 2015 UTC,I like the 'give or take a Rake'. I think it can be used for almost any discussion related to malazan.

Pale did have wizards:   From chapter 2: Dujek grunted—as close as he ever got to laughing. “All right, cadre, listen carefully. Two things.” A faint scowl crossed his scarred features. “One, the Empress has sent a Claw. They’re in the city, hunting down Pale’s wizards.” A chill danced up Tattersail’s spine. No one liked having the Claws around. Those Imperial assassins—Laseen’s favored weapon—kept their poisoned daggers sharp for anyone and everyone, Malazans included. It seemed Calot was thinking the same thing, for he sat up sharply. “If they’re here for any other reason . . .” “They’ll have to come through me first,” Dujek said, his lone hand reaching down to rest on the pommel of his longsword. He has an audience, there in the other room. He’s telling the man commanding the Claw how things stand. Shedunul bless him. Hairlock spoke. “They’ll go to ground. They’re wizards, not idiots.” It was a moment before Tattersail understood the man’s comment. Oh, right. Pale’s wizards."

Completely able to escape into solid story telling, but then feel enlightened and reminded about the way the world works as well. - Weird.  And also how, you make constant leaps of assumptions, that you trust enough to base the next leg of the stories on. Because He doesnt tell you everything exactly. You kinda asume or adjust your asumptions as you learn more. Its the strangest thing. I think about it, and it seems to me I should be annoyed by it.

I can't remember which book (second half of the series), but Erikson devotes one small section of his storytelling to a family on a farmhouse as they are being wiped off the map. It seemed really random, but looking back that's just another aspect of the world that we get shown through the storytelling. No named characters, no further mention. Just there, and then gone.

Malazan,3b3g8c,shekkie,5,Fri Jun 26 06:20:19 2015 UTC,I wasnt so affected by that one actually. Not the actuall death I mean. However the reactions of other chars where sad as hell. Mallet for example :(

Malazan,3b2lmx,thebeginningistheend,10,Thu Jun 25 13:41:33 2015 UTC,"I would say Earth is bigger but that's just my impression. I don't think SE has ever released a full world map to scale so hard to tell. Here is a fairly accurate fan map http://thewertzone.blogspot.com/2012/12/updated-malazan-reading-order-and-map.html?m=1. Appears to be much less landmass than Earth. Gravity wise we will never know, I'm sure we're supposed to assume it's just 1G since it's highly doubtful a fantasy author would describe the density/mass of the planet."
Malazan,3b2lmx,danny_b87,2,Thu Jun 25 14:12:46 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see that's a useful map, thanks.  But looking at that has made me realize that they invaded Genabackis from the wrong end. Why were they invading North to South and not South to North?"
Malazan,3b2lmx,wjbc,5,Thu Jun 25 14:57:08 2015 UTC,"They came from Seven Cities and are supplied from there.  They also started with the independent cities in north Genabackis, picking them off one by one.  It probably looked like the easier end of the continent at the time.  I can't see that particular link on my computer, but because there's no official map, world maps vary, perhaps that one is different.  Here's a few."
Malazan,3b2lmx,ChaosBrat,2,Thu Jun 25 15:00:46 2015 UTC,"I think it makes sense that from Malaz to Quon Tali, the Empire would expand southeast to Fist and northwest to Seven Cities across relatively small expanses of ocean.  Getting to North America from Spain via Greenland and Newfoundland is probably less risky than a straight line across the Atlantic.  Long supply lines make for easier disruption.  I am more curious about the MT Spoiler"
Malazan,3b2lmx,wjbc,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:53:32 2015 UTC,I don't remember that from Midnight Tides.  Are you sure it isn't a spoiler from a later book?  I haven't read past Midnight Tides.

Malazan,3b2lmx,internet_enthusiast,2,Thu Jun 25 23:49:00 2015 UTC,That scene occurred in MoI; not sure I ever connected it with the Edur before but it makes sense.  From the Malazan wiki entry on Callows (spoilers through TtH on that page):  Spoilers MoI:
Malazan,3b2lmx,ChaosBrat,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:17:06 2015 UTC,"I sincerely thought it was MT, but that may have been later.  My apologies if I spoiled anything for you, but it's not much of a plot point, just a minor blip."
Malazan,3b2lmx,internet_enthusiast,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:49:55 2015 UTC,"It's more of a RG spoiler I think, but it's strongly hinted at in MoI."
Malazan,3b2lmx,vkodld,3,Fri Jun 26 00:17:53 2015 UTC,"I think the size of the primary world is about the same... though we never really get to know about the whole world, most events are happening around the Malazan empire, there are some travels that take weeks and months by ship... so that gives a good perspective on the size. You have to remember that there are multiple realms/worlds in the 'universe' that are mentioned, so in total the 'accessible universe' is much larger than the earth in my opinion."
Malazan,3b2lmx,vkodld,2,Thu Jun 25 14:56:36 2015 UTC,"Here is a good answer to your question.  http://malazan.wikia.com/wiki/Malazan_world   The Malazan world appears to be at least similar in size to Earth, and may be notably larger. No unified map of the entire planet has been published to date, although fans have frequently attempted to create one. According to Erikson, a world map may appear in the planned Encyclopaedia Malazica. He has also confirmed that rough sketches of such maps have already been created."
Malazan,3b3sqa,SketchesAndStuff,4,Thu Jun 25 19:03:58 2015 UTC,I want to ruffle his mane
Malazan,3b2hhm,codyloydl,3,Thu Jun 25 13:03:14 2015 UTC,Well.. He met up with the edur fleet because he was pissed that they were oppressing the tribal people he met on his travels with Samar Dev     Can't remember where he was going before they ran into those tribal people though.   I am also working on RG at the moment
Malazan,3b2hhm,codyloydl,5,Thu Jun 25 13:46:33 2015 UTC,"Did some checking.. In chapter 5 Samar Dev convinces Karsa to go to Sepik by telling him that there are some oppressed people living there, and he agrees to go.   Interesting in that I'm pretty sure that is where the Edur fleet finds the enslaved mix-blooded Edur so he probably would have met up with them anyway.  Also, I think we know that Karsa is the Crippled God's knight or mortal sword or something so it is likely that the CG needs Karsa in letheras for some reason or another and was realized that Karsa wouldn't make it to Sepik in time."
Malazan,3b2hhm,DumpTruckJester,6,Thu Jun 25 14:08:22 2015 UTC,The crippled God wants Karsa to be the knight in chains of the house of chains and Karsa consistently tells the god to get stuffed
Malazan,3b2hhm,codyloydl,5,Thu Jun 25 16:01:16 2015 UTC,"If you've finished the books then you know more than I do, but I have been wondering about the possibility of CG using Karsa as the knight through subtle manipulation, even though Karsa denies it."
Malazan,3b2hhm,Oathsend,6,Thu Jun 25 16:12:59 2015 UTC,"It's possible that the CG got Rhulad to send fleets that could, by chance, encounter Karsa so that he would be able to fight Rhulad, with one of those fleets being the one that Samar Dev told Karsa about. I don't think he would be able to manipulate him any more than that, though. Karsa's whole shtick is that he refuses to follow the whims of the gods."
Malazan,3b2hhm,shadow793,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:10:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it could be this."
Malazan,3b2hhm,universal_straw,3,Thu Jun 25 17:47:11 2015 UTC,Karsa is the imperfection in the structure of the House of Chains.
Malazan,3b2hhm,SageOfTheWise,2,Fri Jun 26 03:59:21 2015 UTC,Different powers at various points in the past have tried to push Karsa in certain directions. I just chalk it up to that.
Malazan,3b2hhm,Morghus,2,Thu Jun 25 13:47:20 2015 UTC,"Well The edur were searching all over for strong warriors, probably doesn't matter much which direction he went. Especially since he went out of his way to hunt them down when he heard about what assholes they were."
Malazan,3b2bvz,microcosm315,8,Thu Jun 25 12:06:59 2015 UTC,"Much of the series wraps up, however there are a couple arcs that don't. Last I heard they would be continued in future titles."

Malazan,3b2bvz,TriscuitCracker,3,Fri Jun 26 23:45:53 2015 UTC,"Definitely read the Esselmont books. Sure, he's not as good as Erikson, but they are definitely decent reads that answer lots of backstory and side character questions.   Also, Forge of Darkness and the future Erikson books!   Also you will get a laugh and a chill with the Bauchelin and Korbal Broach novellas."
Malazan,3b2bvz,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:46:19 2015 UTC,Definitely have them on my future reading list.  Are any of the related works solely based on Karsa?
Malazan,3b2bvz,herminator,2,Thu Jun 25 16:52:08 2015 UTC,"Actually yes.  There is supposed to be a Karsa trilogy in the future written by Erikson. Probably a few years off though. He just finished writing the second book Fall of Light in the Karkhanas trilogy which as a whole focuses on the Elders and the Titse Andi way way back in the past before Mother Dark turned away from them.  Esselmont is now going to write Dancer's Lament, about Shadowthrone and Cotillion pre-Ascendant days I believe."

Malazan,3b0yam,nastyasshb,15,Thu Jun 25 02:17:03 2015 UTC,Cannot recommend actually skipping it.
Malazan,3b0yam,Lankles,14,Thu Jun 25 03:24:44 2015 UTC,"To be perfectly honest, I think this is a terrible idea."
Malazan,3b0yam,nothingcleverleft,4,Thu Jun 25 03:31:08 2015 UTC,"Terrible idea. If you are confused now, you're only going to be more confused when you aren't even actually reading the book.  Also the Tor rereads summaries for book 1 are very sparse, they really assume you've read the chapters. Would probably be even harder to follow them on their own than the book."
Malazan,3b0yam,SageOfTheWise,3,Thu Jun 25 03:46:13 2015 UTC,"Unless you're strapped for time, I really think you should try to get through GotM.  Characters continue through from book one to book two, and I think you'll appreciate how some of the characters are behaving towards others more if you read the first book.   That said, the first time I read GotM I was very underwhelmed. The series really picked up with the second book. I reread all the books right before The Crippled God came out, and I was impressed at all the foreshadowing I started picking up in book one.   Either way, give the series a shot. But I'd recommend you try to muscle through book one."
Malazan,3b0yam,Johnswizzle,3,Thu Jun 25 03:33:20 2015 UTC,"It starts to make sense in the latter two thirds of the book, once the story gets to Daruhjistan. The series just isn't for you if you're going to skip reading the book entirely."
Malazan,3b0yam,Solarin88,2,Thu Jun 25 04:14:56 2015 UTC,Lol lazy. I loved GoTM
Malazan,3b0yam,CapytannHook,2,Thu Jun 25 06:33:21 2015 UTC,Nooooooooooooooooo.  If you're having trouble following go to the Goodreads read along.  They do a really good job of avoiding spoilers while helping you understand whats going on- but you also need to understand that you are not supposed to understand most of whats going on yet.  That was Erikson's intention.  It's worth toughing out.
Malazan,3b0yam,Ftove,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:24:25 2015 UTC,I didn't know there was one! Or that goodreads had any read alongs! Thanks for the tip!

Malazan,3b0yam,zendium,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:38:01 2015 UTC,"When I read GoTM the first time I was quite overwhelmed my self, so I ended up with reading the summaries before I started on a new chapter. That was really helpful, and made so much easier to follow. It will of course give you some spoilers, but your gonna read the chapter right up anyway, so I like think about as a sort of ""coming up"" trailer at a TV-show."
Malazan,3b0yam,HighCrawler,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:54:16 2015 UTC,"The beginning is hard, trust me we have all been through it. You just have to keep reading. Give it another 200 pages and then see if your more interested or you could get the audio book.   Myself personally went through almost the whole book beeing confused and I started the second one because I wanted to understand more of the universe. So yeah i think the confusion is totally normal thing and if it does not work for you, you might be better to leave the whole series for a bit and return to them later."
Malazan,3b0yam,end_O_the_world_box,-3,Thu Jun 25 06:33:42 2015 UTC,"You would definitely have a diminished experience, but you probably could do it if you really, really wanted to. GotM was one of the first books I read after a long hiatus, so my comprehension was way down, so I basically just got a summary before moving on to DG. The downside was I wasn't super attached Incredibly minor ""this character exists in this book"" structural spoilers GotM-MoI"

Malazan,3axsgk,ZubKhanate,3,Wed Jun 24 10:34:26 2015 UTC,"I restarted twice. Once during HoC and once during TtH. It was much easier to get over the hump and solidified a lot of things in my mind, which really amplified my anticipation and excitement about the stuff I hadn't read yet."
Malazan,3axsgk,drae-,4,Wed Jun 24 19:11:54 2015 UTC,If you think you need a refresher here is the tor reread. Perhaps just the Gardens of the Moon stuff to reacquaint yourself with some of the Daru characters.    I'd suggest just pushing through a little more though. Things start to pick up in a big way towards the latter portion of TtH.
Malazan,3axsgk,Dannick,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:06:51 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend just starting over again with Gardens of the Moon.  Re-reading this series is such a pleasure, I'm reading each book twice as I go along, and so far I'm on my second reading of Midnight Tides.  I assure you it will be a pleasure.  However, the shortcut is to reference the summaries in Wikipedia, or the more detailed summaries in TOR's ""Malazan Reread of the Fallen."""
Malazan,3axsgk,wjbc,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:49:57 2015 UTC,A year is a long time to not restart.
Malazan,3axsgk,Lankles,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:56:31 2015 UTC,Honestly I'd just power through it. The last quarter of the book is one of the best convergences in the series. You're pretty close!   And go check out the Tor Re-read of the Fallen for that book up to the chapter you are in for a recap. That should be enough.
Malazan,3axsgk,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:14:16 2015 UTC,"I am not sure whether it would be a good idea to keep going, or maybe just torch everything and completely restart the series so I can refresh my memory and pick up on things that I might have missed.   Judging by how many people enjoy the books more after a reread, and your struggles with TtH, I think starting over can't hurt.  Another idea is to just reserve some time and to just sit down and read for a few hours. In my experience, when you really delve in, and push through, the memories kinda come back to you. TtH is the favourite book for many, due to it's finale and the lead-in to that finale, so you're basically going to quit before it gets good.  As with all Erikson books, the second half speeds up considerably."
Malazan,3axsgk,Montaron87,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:09:17 2015 UTC,The finale of Toll the Hounds... Oh my! I can honestly say you need to keep reading

Does anyone know: Is it as heavy as Malazan? (Heavy as in complex, hard to get into, in media res, a billion characters etc.)"
Malazan,3av9at,codyloydl,6,Wed Jun 24 00:39:52 2015 UTC,"It's a complete satire. Very light, very funny."
Malazan,3av9at,angeleus09,3,Wed Jun 24 04:11:51 2015 UTC,It's not heavy at all just a real light fun read.
Malazan,3atmzx,putridbabybutt,17,Tue Jun 23 12:27:53 2015 UTC,"Haha good skit there.  You're not alone in this. A lot of people, my self included, felt at first that Midnight Tides starts off as the worst book in the series. Midnight Tides takes place during the timelines of the first four books. At first I was like ""Not ANOTHER new continent!"" and ""Oh man, another zillion people to remember!"" But by the end it was one of my favorites. Trull and his family are amazing characters. The Bedict brothers end up being some of the most beloved in the series.   One of my favorite passages in the series is Trull fighting through the snowy wastes and he hallucinates his brothers. So good.  I feel sorry for Rhulad, and Tehol and Bugg just crack me up every time. And Spoiler  Glad you liked it! And Congratulations, you are halfway through!! And now, back to your Bonehunters pals. What has become of the Malazan army after the Whirlwind has been crushed? All the plotlines and subplot lines from the previous five books will now sloooowly come together over the next few books to epically ""converge"" in Dust of Dreams/Crippled God. It's a helluva ride. And you still have so far to go.    Oh, and as for Bonehunters, prepare to sweat. You'll see what I mean."
Malazan,3atmzx,TriscuitCracker,8,Tue Jun 23 14:35:33 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. I get a bit of a lump in my throat thinking about Brys. Probably one of the most genuine persons in this series so far... He and Duiker both made me feel like I was sucker punched.   Midnight Tides is certainly one of my favorite Malazan books so far. I think it goes Memories of Ice/House of Chains in the top spot, and then Midnight Tides.   Thanks for the encouragement! I know my boy Kalam is on the cover. So pumped :D"
Malazan,3atmzx,danielcore,5,Tue Jun 23 14:52:43 2015 UTC,"I just finished Midnight Tides today myself, and I honestly think I'd rank it as my favourite book so far. As you said, the smaller cast of characters allowed Erikson to delve further into their lives and why they made the decisions they made, bringing you into an intimate relationship with these people. I cared more for the Sengar family and the Beddict brothers than any other characters I've met so far. I feel like most of the other main characters that I really like (Kalam, Quick Ben, Mappo, Icarium, so on) are still too unknown to me to really be that invested in their well being. Spoilers up to MT"
Malazan,3atmzx,danielcore,3,Wed Jun 24 04:13:56 2015 UTC,"I just want to agree with you and reiterate how horrible Tehol's death was to me. Just a smack in the face.   So glad I'm reading along with someone, sort of! I'm wondering if I'm the only one who missed how Trull ended up where he was at the start of HoC. Did I miss that in MT? Or is it still unknown to us?"
Malazan,3atmzx,BlackViperMWG,3,Wed Jun 24 07:59:19 2015 UTC,It hasn't been explained yet. I was waiting to see when the Edur would send their ships to Drift Avalii because I assume it has something to do with that.
Malazan,3atmzx,TriscuitCracker,2,Wed Jun 24 12:07:40 2015 UTC,"From what Trull said in HoC and in MT, you could easily assume he finally stopped following Rhulad and being chained in Nascent is his punishment."
Malazan,3atmzx,BlackViperMWG,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:18:55 2015 UTC,"That was my assumption, I just wanted to know if I missed where it was stated ""Trull this is what will happen if you keep butting heads,"" or if it was something else entirely."

Malazan,3atmzx,Alfons1983,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:31:51 2015 UTC,"Speaking of MT, why it's chronologically at the same time with GotM, but at the chapter 7 when Feather Witch reads from deck of holds, she says ""The Hold of the Beast has found Twin Rulers"", which happened at the end of MOI."
Malazan,3aveop,25cents,3,Tue Jun 23 20:33:13 2015 UTC,"I don't believe they are anyone we met before, unless we met them in the scene they died. They were all just the people who's souls or whatever got absorbed by Icarium's machine when it turned on, because of their proximity. The characters we don't know are just random people who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time."
Malazan,3aveop,SageOfTheWise,2,Wed Jun 24 02:36:34 2015 UTC,"We met a few of them. Feather Witch was one for sure. And Taxilian. Those are the only two I remember right now off the top of my head, but there were others. Veed was another I think."

Malazan,3aveop,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:04:23 2015 UTC,"I remember their being huge discussion and debate for months over who the two ghosts were at the beginning of the TTH prologue. Eventually someone asked Erikson, turned out to be just two random dead people we never met before."
Malazan,3aveop,TriscuitCracker,3,Thu Jun 25 17:08:24 2015 UTC,I don't actually know...I wonder if they were just random people's souls caught up in the wake of Icarium's making of the new warrens like Taxilian and Rautos.
Malazan,3aveop,KevDrinksCorona,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:06:07 2015 UTC,"The exiles that find Kalse Rooted are representations of what is within Icarium. We know he summoned Feather Witch's soul before she died. Her soul was gone when Errant killed her (iirc the line 'Who cleaned that out?' was used), which is how she was able to supply him with Errant's eye to create a Finnest. The others represent a strong emotion or trait of Icarium."
Malazan,3aveop,Priest_of_Aroo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:34:45 2015 UTC,I thought they were personifications of his emotions. They all exhibit strong emotions of a single kind.
Malazan,3auq9h,HighCrawler,3,Tue Jun 23 17:43:23 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I'm still not clear on why you think Tay is Arathan. Could you please elaborate a bit on what exactly pointed that out to you?  As far as the high mages go: Tay was not the most powerful (in Gardens of the Moon, anyway). Perhaps out of all the mortal high mages, yes, but if you read Night of Knives Spoiler.   If you're basing that assessment of power from the siege at pale, remember that Rake was holding back his magic, so as not to raze the entire army. He's a scary dude. Tay however went balls-to-the-wall and melted Nightchill, A'Karonys and Hairlock (IIRC). But more than that, remember that Gardens of the Moon is full of little idiosyncrasies that don't continue into the rest of the series (e.g. Orfantal being female).  I think his name in MoI is just coincidental, personally, but I'm interested in hearing why you believe differently."
Malazan,3auq9h,titanemesis,5,Tue Jun 23 19:36:02 2015 UTC,"I'd just like to point out that I'm 99% certain that Tayschrenn was in fact not behind the attack that killed the other mages at the siege of Pale. Everything points to it at the time, but this is due to unreliable narrators, it's straightened out in MoI I think."
Malazan,3auq9h,Phhhhuh,3,Tue Jun 23 23:18:22 2015 UTC,"Firstly disclamer: I have not read all the Ian's novels only the fist one, NoK.  Soooo now on the whole Tay beeing Arathan thing it was a theory when FoD came out and yea many things fit, but nothing is for sure with Erikson :)  About the magic, I think that Anomander overexaggerated his power in front of Baruk plus if you think about it he has always been a warrior not a mage.  About the fight I don't think we know for sure what happened because no one is reliable witness, because Erikson is like that with telling stories of stories."
Malazan,3auq9h,BioChemistryStudent,3,Tue Jun 23 20:50:52 2015 UTC,"I assumed the one with the warren that disagreed with Tattersail was Hairlock, because right after that, we get the whole Hairlock being wreathed in shadow, and trying to get Sail to sit on his lap thing. Human Light, vs Human shadow."
Malazan,3aup12,Romoth,7,Tue Jun 23 17:34:47 2015 UTC,I don't think that the history behind that is really explained flat out. IIRC all you really know is that One Eye Cat is a city that the Malazans conquered (in a difficult campaign) and that Studious Lock has some questionable (maybe outlaw) history back there. Nothing explicit.
Malazan,3aup12,TocTheEternal,2,Tue Jun 23 18:02:24 2015 UTC,Exactly what I needed to know.  Thank you!
Malazan,3aup12,KrugSmash,2,Tue Jun 23 18:07:38 2015 UTC,"Actually I'm at about the same place as you (page 900 something in TtH), and I'm 90% certain that I read something about One Eye Cat being an absolute massacre.

Malazan,3aup12,Priest_of_Aroo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:16:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, they are. But, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe they reference in some of their conversations that they met and fought together in One Eye Cat. I believe both Badrun and Door are renegades.

Malazan,3aup12,Priest_of_Aroo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:39:19 2015 UTC,"A fair point, but I think we can both agree that despite them not being from there Door and Badrun fit the crazy mold created in one eye cat."

Malazan,3avpfs,zippykeno,7,Tue Jun 23 21:49:34 2015 UTC,"Fener chose to die because he unlike humans got tired of war, his vulnerability made him rethink war in general and he decided he'd have one last blaze of glory before getting some rest. He needed to die because his godblood helped the CG's heart, rejuvenated it or something. And coincidentally he brought the undead back to life, the Jaghut and the Imass, righting an ancient wrong caused by war, his aspect."
Malazan,3avpfs,mortal_sword,8,Tue Jun 23 23:43:53 2015 UTC,"He was vulnerable, he was trying to hide but he reflected on it and he tells the Errant that he wants to go out in one last big battle... he decides to do something good as his last act of God of War... later Heboric is devastated over Fener's death but Mael tells him, “Even gods of war will tire of war . . He [Fener] has absolved you of all blame. His blood has brought life to dead lands. He deems it a worthy sacrifice.”  Fener sacrificed himself on purpose for the greater good, he had a change of heart."
Malazan,3avpfs,mortal_sword,3,Wed Jun 24 00:21:11 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, he was trying to hide in Lether.   He was hiding in Lether because he wanted to live long enough to die in this battle. He says almost exactly that to the Errant when he asks for shelter."
Malazan,3avpfs,SageOfTheWise,0,Wed Jun 24 01:00:01 2015 UTC,"There is also the issue that, because Karsa Orlong shattered a turk in Darujhistan, Fener (who was hiding in a cave under Lether) appeared as a gigantic being above the Spire in Kolanse, and then splits in two and spills blood everywhere (and despite Fener not being Tiam or Elder his blood still seems to have magical powers).  None of this being in any way cromulent with anything we know can happen in the book, making it annoying deus-ex-machina (extremely literally in this case) number three thousand in the Malazan series."
Malazan,3avpfs,JebusGobson,3,Wed Jun 24 02:38:17 2015 UTC,"The plan to get Fener killed was in motion back in Toll The Hounds, Hood sent Toc to tell Picker to tell Karsa exactly where to go the shrine in Darujhistan. Hood had been told by a God of War ( they don't tell you in TTH to build suspense as to which God gave the message and which is to die. With the fact that Fener sacrificed  himself probably he sent the message as well as being the god to die. Fener got from Seven Cities to Lether... he CAN go from place to place avoiding detection with what being vulnerable this is necessary for him. Then Gesler and Stormy two powerfully magical individuals, who as early as DG are almost fully ascended, call on him during battle. They were in a cult of Fener, he was their patron God they have a connection so when they call him he can manifest fully. Finally, Fener himself connected the tusk in Darujhistan to form a portal which Karsa's sword swings THROUGH hitting him. People see a giant flint sword appear in the sky and cut Fener. So actually there were hints of this from the last three books... in fact Hood or Toc even reminds someone that the blood is all important... And on the blood: Gods are magical as hell, who says a dying God's blood isn't very powerful? Oh wait saemenkalyk or whatever is literally the Dying God's blood and its pretty damn magical. Its been proven god blood is magical so yes it wasn't a deus ex machina its been planned since TTH, Erikson even used the Dying God to show blood had power."
Malazan,3avpfs,mortal_sword,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:24:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying there was no foreshadowing, but there is absolutely no reason why Fener would appear incredibly massive in the sky above the Spire and get physically cut in two there. By what mechanism? Is there a huge-making-and-transporting-half-around-the-world-in-an-instant Warren out there or something? Because if there is they sure didn't mention it the entire series."
Malazan,3avpfs,JebusGobson,2,Wed Jun 24 15:20:27 2015 UTC,"The reasons ( which I'll admit aren't very directly shown in the chaos of the last part of the book) are that 1. Gesler and Stormy, very powerful members of his cult called on him. 2. He is still a God of War and all this crazy warfare gives him more power, sacrifice in the name of war. How did he get to the Spire? Possibly he got there like he got to Letheras which is unknown but nobody knows how he managed to cross a huge distance undetected, he probably used the same means to get to the spire. And Fener used all his god power to connect the Tusk one of the last surviving things sanctified in his name to his physical body in the sky. So it wasn't literally a sword transporting across the world but the magical energy or power or whatever from it hit Fener through his tusk. The mechanism is his connection to his last surviving shrine."
Malazan,3au00o,Clearly_a_fake_name,4,Tue Jun 23 14:27:11 2015 UTC,"How did Heboric know that he was Treach’s Destriant? He was rescued from the Jade Statue by Treach.  Last I remember, his ghost hands were possessed by Fener.   Not exactly.  More like he possessed Fener with his ghost hands, pulling him out of his warren and deposing him from godhood.    Then he had quite a psychedelic dream where he witnessed large Jade Statues (presumably in the world that the Crippled God came from?).    Yes, except it appears to be one of the real dreams that happens in this series, and he was in real danger.   Then when he woke from the dream, he was suddenly Treach’s Destriant. How did that happen, and how did he know?   Treach rescued him from the dream, grants him gifts, and steers him toward certain tasks.  We don't see communications between Treach and Heboric, but then we didn't really see communications between Treach and Gruntle, either.  When a god chooses you, eventually you realize you've been chosen, like it or not.   Why did Karsa leave Sha'ik in the first place?    Karsa was aware that Felisin Paran was not the Sha'ik reborn but rather a replacement, and not a person to whom he had any attachment.  He was also being pushed aside by Felisin/Sha'ik, who rarely listened to his advice or even asked him to do anything.  So he had time to create several sculptures, speak with the spirits of his friends and his ""gods,"" and eventually decided he might as well go find a horse worthy of him -- which, as it happened, also was what his ""gods"" wanted him to do because it took him where they wanted him to go for their own purposes.  They, in turn, are being guided by the Crippled God, who has chosen Karsa for his Mortal Sword.  Karsa sees no reason to object, but isn't so keen on serving the Crippled God.   I know Karsa goes on the hunt for his Flint sword.   Actually, it was more the horse that started the hunt, he wasn't really aware that he would get a new sword.  His old sword was serving him and didn't break until he faced Icarium.   Did his Gods tell him he needed to leave?   In part, but he already suspected their true nature and went in large part to serve his own interests.   What made him go back to Sha'ik?   He had some people to kill, now that he had a proper horse and weapon.   Bloodlust?   Not random bloodlust.  He had a list.   What on earth happened in the last couple of chapters?!   You could read the summaries in TOR's ""Malazan Reread of the Fallen.""    So…. We spend the entire time building up to a battle in the desert that never actually happens.    Many things happened just prior to what people thought would be the big battle.  Most importantly, the Whirlwind Goddess was assassinated, which left Sha'ik defenseless.  But also a ghost army killed the Dogslayers, and assassins and Karsa killed several of the major players behind Sha'ik, so the rebellion was severely weakened and the remnants made a strategic withdrawal.   All of a sudden, there are Talon assassins all over the camp.    There are assassins all over the camp, but most of them are Korbolo's.  There are also Claw assassins, and Pearl and Kalam, but I don't remember any Talon assassins, unless some of Korbolo's were Talon assassins.  At any rate, they were following Korbolo's orders.  Korbolo calls himself the Master of the Talon, but I'm still not sure that means he's master of the entire Talon network.  He does, however, employ Talon assassins.   Who sent these Assassins? If Korbolo sent them, how is he in charge of the Empires oldest and best Assassins?   Korbolo had assembled his own team of assassins who were apparently more loyal to him than to the Empire.  If he really was the secret Master of the Talon, how he claimed that position is not explained.  But we do know that the Talon were working for the nobles, so perhaps he simply offered them employment.  But some of the assassins were not under Korbolo's control.   If I understand it correctly, Kamist Reloe (Or was it Korbolo Dom?) betrays Shai’k?    Both betrayed Sha'ik.   Who was Kallam fighting for? Obviously he spends a lot of time working for Cotillion (who I’m beginning to grow fond of). But why did he infiltrate Shai’ks camp?   He was still working for Cotillion.  But his exact mission is unclear.  He seems to be using his own judgment and, for the moment, his interests are aligned with the Empire's, particularly after he reunites with Quick Ben.   Shai’k the Goddess / T’lan Imass?! So the whole book, I’m thinking Felisin and Shai’k are the same person, 2 souls perhaps within 1 body. But then in the final chapter, Loric is witness to several Talon’s murdering a T’lan Imass who apparently is the goddess? Where did she come from? Why is she not within Felisin?   She is inhabiting a warren, or a fragment of a warren.  She is with Felisin the way Treach is with Heboric.   Finally, 2 questions that I should know the answers too but don’t: What was Trull Sengar’s/Onrack’s storyline about? Obviously it’s Trull in the HoC prologue who is chained up and exiled. Onrack comes across him and sets him free. What is there mission from then on? I know they start heading towards The First Throne (where they find Apt). Was that their mission all along? To find the First Throne?   Their mission becomes protecting the First Throne from the renegade T’lan Imass who were posing as Karsa's gods, and from the power behind them, the Crippled God.   Same with Lostara Yil and Peal. I enjoyed their story, but I’m not quite sure what their objective was. Was it simply to find and rescue Felisin?   Yes, although Pearl also wanted to know more about the Talon.  And they also captured Korbolo and delivered him to the Adjunct.   What was up the song in the end? Was it physically being sung by a girl or was it the desert itself singing?    The song seems to be playing in the heads of those who can hear it, and also is sung by the ghost army, so it's a bit of both.   So all the dead Bridgeburners have ascended? Does this mean that they are alive?   No one is quite sure what this means, as it isn't usual for a whole army to ascend together like this.  As far as I can tell, they have transcended death, but they aren't physically alive (except for those who were never killed).  Edit: I missed the fact that Korbolo called himself Master of the Talon, and edited accordingly.  However, I'm still not sure that means he controlled the entire network like Dancer, or just that he employs several of the Talon and therefore considers himself their master."

Malazan,3au00o,TriscuitCracker,6,Tue Jun 23 15:43:24 2015 UTC,"You asked very good questions, (also, good answers!) and seem to be following everything nicely, frankly, some confusion on your first read of Malazan is perfectly normal. I'd suggest following along with the Tor Re-read on chapters you've already read if you need clarity, or just ask this sub.   Your first re-read is honestly as good as the first one in its own way. Everything just connects and foreshadows so much better and you can see waaaay more of how Erikson connects the dots from Book One to Book Ten.   On to Midnight Tides! It's an entirely new continent (again) and all new characters (again) except one, but don't be scared. We'll help if you need but just keep reading.

To clarify, all of Korbolo Dom's assassins were Talons.  He is the hidden Master of the Talon that Pearl was supposed to identify.

I appreciate the comment though, as I have advocated on a number of occasions to tighten up the spoiler policy on this sub (more in line with how they do it in /r/asoiaf where a spoiler scope is necessary).  EDIT: From the Malazan Wiki's entry on Talon (Spoilers through tCG on this page so be careful!):   A number of different characters attempted to track down a supposed new ""Master of the Talon"", including Cutter, Apsalar and Lostara Yil, who were each tasked by Cotillion, while Lostara and Pearl were looking for the Empire itself.  Korbolo Dom claimed the title of ""Master of the Talon"", with Kalam recognising the difference in their formation to that of a Claw hand, though Cotillion (Dancer) had no input in this new group of Talons.  Korbolo was captured and had his Talon organisation destroyed by Kalam and Quick Ben.   It goes on to cite the source of this info as House of Chains, Chapter 25, UK MMPB, pg. 929, 938"

It's that old unreliable narrator thing.  But Korbolo Dom certainly employs a number of assassins, several of them from the Talon."

Malazan,3apt67,TriscuitCracker,3,Mon Jun 22 15:52:14 2015 UTC,"There are limits to magic but many ways to get around those limits, so you will meet people who have done so, often in very clever ways.  There are also ways to nullify magic, but there are ways to get around that, as well.  There are so many creatures and items with magical powers or the ability to nullify magical powers that the magic often cancels out, leaving the non-magical fighters to decide the issue.  But not always, sometimes the magic wins, at least in the short run.  I'm confident that there are rules to the magic, if there weren't I would quickly lose interest.  But in general there is a lot of magic, much more so than in most fantasies I have read.  If they tried to televise this series, the budget for special effects would be incredible.  The key to making such a fantasy work is balance of power, but because the magic is so prevalent the balance is constantly threatened.  So the ""heroes"" of the tale are those who attempt to right the balance, even when, in abstract, what they are doing may not seem particularly honorable.  That may be the theme of the series right there.  As it is stated in Midnight Tides: ""No deed stands outside the moral context. At the same time, the most morally perfect act is the one taken in opposition to what has occurred before.”"
Malazan,3apt67,ijvsld,2,Mon Jun 22 15:43:44 2015 UTC,"Bear in mind there are no set rules like in Sanderson's Mistborn series. Magic is very fluid in the Malazan series.   Keep reading! There's lots to learn.  Think of Malzan as if you were an alien visiting Earth. You have no idea what people are saying when they talk about WWII, or Rome, or the Civil War, or how cellphones work. But if you hang around long enough, you'll pick up everything and connect the dots as you hang around amazing characters.  Erikson does not usually do info dumps."
Malazan,3apt67,Alfons1983,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:52:56 2015 UTC,I'm thinking I'm going to have to cover an entire wall with sticky notes and thread to keep track of all the characters.

Also you may want to check out in the sidebar the Tor Malazan re-read of the Fallen. It has a newbie and a re-reader going through the series analyziing chapter by chapter. Very helpful to remember things, but stick with Amanda's viewpoint."

Malazan,3amylc,25cents,3,Sun Jun 21 23:35:26 2015 UTC,"I've read them three ways: Physical books, e-books individually, and as the new Malazan Book of the Fallen e-book (this one has all ten books in one). I liked the physical books a lot since I could flip to the back easily to use the glossary and read up on the Houses and Holds, but the e-books are just so convenient. The single e-books have a bunch of typos, but the Malzan Book of the Fallen fixed almost all of those. No more Toe the Younger, thank lord."

Malazan,3amylc,ChillBro69,2,Mon Jun 22 14:56:22 2015 UTC,Yep
Malazan,3amylc,RickyLidz,2,Mon Jun 22 15:01:22 2015 UTC,"I mostly read on my commute, so kindle all the way from a purely practical standpoint.  That said, there's a semi-unique bonus to reading Malazans on an eBook, and that's the search in all books function. Lose track of who a character casually referenced 4 books ago was? No problem. This was particularly useful when reading forge of darkness for checking references to characters in the main series!"
Malazan,3amylc,MrChug,5,Mon Jun 22 11:04:17 2015 UTC,"FWIW, I read the majority of the books as audiobooks. I was left with mixed feelings. On the one hand, I was able to blast through the series as an audio book, as I could listen more often than you can actually sit down and read. Also, the narrators Kruppe is the definitive voice for Kruppe, I can't unhear that voice when reading the physical book.   Unfortunately, the audio books are not finished, they are still in production and just released Midnight Tides(?). More damning is the fact that they've changed narrators. They did change on a book they introduce a lot of new characters, but it's very hard to get used to."
Malazan,3amylc,vancity-,2,Mon Jun 22 00:02:15 2015 UTC,Audible has all of the series and it's excellent. I read through the series over a couple of years and then have been listening to the audiobooks for the past year. Love it.
Malazan,3amylc,mikeyo73,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:22:12 2015 UTC,I'm getting through DG ahd I'm not impressed with Lister. His speaking/narrating voice handling Erikson's descriptive prose. His character voices are the most inconsistent I have ever heard. Mappo had Fiddler's voice until he met Fiddler. He doesn't seem to have a diverse array of voices either. Iscarel Pust is also really inconsistent but more forgivable because he's insane.
Malazan,3amylc,thenerd22393,3,Wed Jun 24 00:01:44 2015 UTC,I read them all in paperback and then all as ebooks.   There will always be something special about physical copies since I grew up reading them. Nonetheless it is soooo much more convenient as an ebook.   The typos were annoying for the ebook.   Edit: I just read on my cellphone. No reader or extra anything. Moonreader+ in dark mode is awesome. I read faster too on the phone.
Malazan,3amylc,Aiolus,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:38:52 2015 UTC,"I only read on Kindle.  It was nice, because all 10 books came as a single volume- but it suuuucked if you wanted to try and flip back and reference something- which with Erikson you want to do all the time."
Malazan,3amylc,Ftove,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:26:36 2015 UTC,"I have both physical copies and on kindle, currently reading the series for the first time. I read each probably 50/50."

Reading a physical book is 10000 times better. I followed the story much better and the fact that its so damn easy to skip back a few pages in a real book, or look at the map or person list just killed the e-reader for me. Will never use a e-reader again."
Malazan,3amylc,Alfons1983,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:21:52 2015 UTC,"I have both.   The only problem with the ebook editions is that it's a pain to get to the glossary or dramatis personae, you can't just flip to them like you can with a physical book. Sometimes I'll read a little Malzan on the fly for favorite passages with ebooks. But if I'm actually sitting down to read the entire thing, with a chair, a fireplace, a coffee and a cat, I'll use the physical book everytime."
Malazan,3alzfo,BlackViperMWG,5,Sun Jun 21 15:10:42 2015 UTC,"I tend to think Olar Ethil is their mother simply because she's the one Draconus acknowledges in FoD. Sheltatha is just a rumor we get second hand.   On your second question I think that, and this is just personal opinion, the Azathanai probably moved between worlds as they willed long before the Tiste migration. Or maybe they can manifest simultaneously across worlds. Either way I feel sure they were there before the Tiste."
Malazan,3alzfo,universal_straw,3,Sun Jun 21 23:25:14 2015 UTC,"For the leaving of Kurald Galain, before the Tiste, that seems right. I think we'll get more of this in Fall of Light and the final book in the trilogy.   I also think Olar Ethil is the true mother. Meandor and Sukul could just be stating what they thought, and not what's actually true.  Whereas Olar Ethil and Draconus are speaking from firsthand accounting obviously."

Since I am interrupted a lot and timing of things I almost never get to the end of chapter. I generally know about where I am and pick it up from there.

I feel like the malazan series is one where if listened at work my productivity would tank to unacceptable levels or I generally would miss too much of the story.  I may consider it for for hiking/running though.    I've heard the audible quality is much better that of the other version that's out there, which from what i've heard really suffers at times.  for example, in the bonehunters where two characters are discussing magic the narrator spontaneously switches their voices"

Aye, we know of its worth, yet in knowing we then attach to it a value, we guard the giving of it, believing it must be earned. Compassion is priceless in the truest sense of the word. It must be given freely. In abundance.”  -Itkovian"
Malazan,3aih15,aleifur,6,Sun Jun 21 19:55:17 2015 UTC,"As I think about I like this answer more and more. In a world of powerful and ancient magic, the world often turns on the head of a supreme act of compassion.   Itkovians actions are a perfect example. The Crippled God can be viewed as power twisted by compassion denied.   Compassion is the most powerful magic in the world, and Erikson contrasts suffering and compassion time and again throughout the series."

Malazan,3abyiw,ijvsld,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:51:21 2015 UTC,"You're not alone in the opinion. Toll the hounds probably does have the best ending, but you will have to finish the series before you can really decide! :)"
Malazan,3abyiw,Sacripain,0,Mon Jun 22 19:25:51 2015 UTC,"I finished the main series and Esselmont's one as well, as well as the Bauchelain and Korbal Broach tales. Haven't started Forge of Darkness yet as I'm waiting for all books to come out. So yeah, out of all of those I must say that Toll the Hounds has the best ending in my opinion. The Crippled God was probably the worst ending because of all the rushing and loose ends but that's what typically happens in fantasy finales - it was still decent."

Malazan,3aa1fv,BioChemistryStudent,6,Thu Jun 18 16:19:53 2015 UTC,At this stage I suspect Nefarious Bredd is a made up character to boost moral amongst the marines but I'll be happy to be proved wrong. He sounds like a badass!

Malazan,3a9f0i,TisteAndii,6,Thu Jun 18 07:26:18 2015 UTC,"Well, adjunct came straight from pretty much every English speaking military.  It's the military assistant of a high-ranking officer.  Given that he's an archaeologist, I imagine he pulled a bits from various cultures, and then modified them slightly to fit his narrative.  For instance Atri means sub.  Preda seems to be a made up title for an officer similar to a captain (as I haven't found the title from Google searches), so an Atri-Preda is a sub captain (or lieutenant)."
Malazan,3a9f0i,AllWrong74,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:09:16 2015 UTC,"Well Atri means sub or under or something of that sort, seeing how atri-something is the rank below something. I can't find any base for it, but I'm not a well-versed in ancient languages besides Greek and Latin, so there might be something there. I assume the titles are (semi-)made up as well.  Adjunct is just an English word based on a Latin word. It basically means addition or extension. Which is exactly the role of the Adjunct in regards to the Empress.  Edit: Pannion Domin is the Domain of Pannion (the name of the Jaghut afaik). Besides that Pannion could refer to the Latin pan, which translates to everything or all. So there might be a kind of reference to Domain of everything, which was the goal of the Pannion Domin."
Malazan,3a7xt8,totallykvothe,23,Wed Jun 17 22:51:59 2015 UTC,"Welcome! Here's my usual speech. Others who've seen this a zillion times need not read.  hands out complimentary Kleenex  Unfortunately, I have not read Wheel of Time.  But Malazan is a wonderful series.  It's not for the faint of heart and the books are not your typical light fantasy type. It's got a cast of hundreds, tons of plotlines, world building galore and it will make you laugh, cry, and cheer. Each book has an overall plot that contributes to the series as a whole, as you read them you connect all the dots and see the big picture the author is trying to achieve.  It is one of the pinnacles of epic literature fantasy in my opinion. It starts with Gardens of the Moon. It is a finished main series, which is great. Erikson's writing style can be intimidating and hard to get into at first. You feel like you got dropped into a foreign country with no understanding of the language, customs, and who are all these people?! This is normal! Give it two or three books until you get used to Erikson's style. Personally it didn't click for me until near the end of book 1.   Remember the glossary at the back of the book and the dramatis personae are your friends. There is literally a cast of hundreds between all the books.  It starts off with a flying mountain citadel attacking defending a city called Pale under siege complete with dragons led by a being who's sword will send you to a hell of sorts literally if it kills you, while a cadre of wizards(and a Malazan army) defend attack the city with fireballs blazing.  Erikson tends to not do info-dumps and can be heavy on the introspective philosophy. The first half of each book is usually character building, plot, history, etc, and the last quarter are when the epic craziness starts and next thing you know it's 4am in the morning and you have to work at 7am but you can't stop now. He wrote the first book 9 years before the second and it shows a bit, but he is an archeologist and an anthropologist so his world building skills are second to none. Every place a character visit feels ancient, every race you come across has an entire history to it, every millennia-old ascendant (powerful being) has several lifetimes of stories to tell.  You have to piece together the overall arching plot and other things, like how the magic system of warrens works, from clues and context of various characters and what you experience through the characters. It's all part of the fun, seeing how all this will fit together and where it's going. You go back and forth between continents and characters and the overall arching plot of the series only really becomes clear after book 5-6 and you and you get an astounding sense of the audacity and craziness and the scale and scope of what Erikson is trying to accomplish.  It's an amazing, wonderful, crying into the books, epic ride. It's even better on a re-read in its own way. Of course, no series is for everybody, so if you don't like it, at least give it through book 2 or 3, but no shame if it's not for you. I hope you enjoy it! If you have any questions about getting into the series post them here. We love newbies who are experiencing it for the first time. If you end up reading it and liking it and you have any questions we'll keep it spoiler free or tell you to read on! It's an amazing series, and definitely in my top 3 fave fantasy series.  Welcome to the sub!"

Malazan,3a7xt8,aleifur,5,Wed Jun 17 23:54:12 2015 UTC,Wow... Thank you. That was the most welcoming intro I have ever been given to a story.  It sounds a lot like Wheel of Time concerning the cast of hundreds. I am actually really excited now.
Malazan,3a7xt8,holyplankton,12,Thu Jun 18 00:50:13 2015 UTC,"Wheel of Time has nothing on the cast of characters you will have to come to know in Malazan. The world is huge and very well fleshed out by the anthropologist author. Every country and area has its own customs and traditions and they all feel like different places and peoples, not just variations of the same people.   I will say, though, that my usual recommendation is to not jump into Malazan from something like WoT. The transition can be a bit jarring. If you haven't read A Song of Ice and Fire yet I would honestly recommend reading what is published from that series before jumping into Malazan, as that will prepare you more for the style of book you'll be delving into. I know WoT was my first fantasy series ad it introduced me to the genre as a whole. I read ASoIaF before Malazan and I'm glad I did as the former really prepared me for the barrage of names and places and cultures that would be thrown at me in Malazan.   You are obviously free to do whatever you desire, and I highly recommend Malazan, it's widely regarded as one of the best fantasy series ever for good reason, but it's also very dense and can be daunting at times. I personally found that ASoIaF was a great bridge between the relative simplicity and LotR-esque world of WoT and the information-packed world of Malazan."
Malazan,3a7xt8,holyplankton,6,Thu Jun 18 01:01:46 2015 UTC,"I think I can handle it. I plan to do my annual reread of LotR before this as sort of a break, and then hit this series. aSoIaF is the last thing on my reading list because I don't want to wait for a new book, like I'm doing with Rothfuss, any longer than I have to. Thanks for the advice though."
Malazan,3a7xt8,PhilosopherIshamael,2,Thu Jun 18 01:33:12 2015 UTC,"I can definitely understand that mindset, I'm waiting on GRRM and Rothfuss myself. I hope you enjoy Malazan, it's a hell of a ride."
Malazan,3a7xt8,AllWrong74,8,Thu Jun 18 02:05:40 2015 UTC,"I would say that also, Malazan is a much more ""adult"" fantasy epic in that it has a lot of characters relative to WoT that are flawed and multifaceted as opposed to evil.  I mean, in WoT it's the good guys versus people literally called the Forsaken and Darkfriends, lol."
Malazan,3a7xt8,HighCrawler,4,Thu Jun 18 00:55:26 2015 UTC,"When he says it will make you cry, he's not exaggerating.  The last time I cried while reading a book was when I was 13.  I read Old Yeller and Where the Red Fern Grows back-to-back.  I first read MBotF when I was 37, and I cried so hard at the end of the second book (I was on the bus at the time) that I must have had 30 people stop and ask if I was OK.  I cried in books 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 10.  So...60% of the books made me cry in at least 1 spot.  There's also comedy, victory, defeat...basically the whole emotional gamut that life throws at you."

Malazan,3a7xt8,AllWrong74,11,Sun Jun 21 15:40:01 2015 UTC,"As someone struggling with WoT I will say that the lore, powerful entities, the world, etc are equal or imo bigger and better. ""Also that the prose/writing/dialogue is much better, you wool head"" I said as I tugged my braid.... Uhg  Granted I am only on like book five but the central characters are driving me crazy. The way they talk, their mannerisms, how they act (I want to kill Nynave and I know she's learning but it took four books!)   Realizing this is more just my ranting about WoT.   So yeah malazan is awesome, you should enjoy it. The world is huge and has a tremendous amount of lore, realism, and depth. There are many interesting and well fleshed out races. Eriksons anthropology and archeology shine through. The magic system is huge. You get a tremendous amount of POVs (one of my favorite things about it). I personally loved Eriksons philosophy. Has immediate storylines and overarching storylines."
Malazan,3a7xt8,Demandred696,6,Thu Jun 18 01:14:38 2015 UTC,"Haha Wheel of Time is extremely aggravating at times, but book 6 is incredible, and then you have to go through literally four books of massive character development while the plot sort of stagnates, and then comes the thunder. The last four books of the series are absolutely astounding. AMoL had me bawling many times, and I still feel terribly hollow, wishing for just one more line."

Malazan,3a7xt8,FR05TB1T3,4,Thu Jun 18 20:40:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with everyone here who says that the Malazan world is huge but one thing they missed is that there are other books by Ian Cam Esslemont (ICE) which tell us the tale of what goes on in parallel to the main storyline. Also, Eriksen is writing a nice trilogy about how the whole Malazan universe began (the first book is already out) and ICE is writing a new series on how the Malazan empire was founded. So the world is huge and we're getting to know more about it.  In my opinion WoT is a great series but it pales slightly in comparison to the Malazan books. Wish you the best for your journey and would like to know what you think of the books when you finish them. Burn's blessings be with you!"
Malazan,3a7xt8,TRAIANVS,7,Thu Jun 18 01:18:20 2015 UTC,"One thing I appreciate about this series is it's not quite as cut and dry good vs evil as a lot of other fantasy stories can be. cough cough LOTR cough cough A lot of the ""heroes"" have serious flaws, and some are downright unlikable. There is a lot of grey area regarding the morality of the choices, nations, and characters involved. Finally, I'll say that the humor in these books is rather sparse, but when Erikson DOES use humor it's spot on hilarious."
Malazan,3a7xt8,midnight_toker22,3,Thu Jun 18 02:31:25 2015 UTC,"While not laugh out loud alot of the time, there is a ton of humor in the books."
Malazan,3a7xt8,TriscuitCracker,2,Thu Jun 18 04:09:30 2015 UTC,Exactly. It's rather that a lot of the time the comedy is very subtle.
Malazan,3a7xt8,TriscuitCracker,2,Thu Jun 18 13:27:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I like both the good vs. evil and the grey shaded stuff if it is done well. Like, I get along fine with both LotR and The Gentleman Bastard Sequence."
Malazan,3a7xt8,wjbc,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:59:36 2015 UTC,"I'm only in the first book, but so far, Kruppe is one of my favorite characters, the way he talks and rambles in third person is hysterical, and his description as ""a man of false modesty"" is perfect.   I haven't found much humor elsewhere in the book, but man, I just love any scene with Kruppe in it."
Malazan,3a7xt8,wjbc,3,Thu Jun 18 14:07:27 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, it will come from a certain priest in DG and in Midnight Tides a comedy duo to rival Kruppe's most crazy ramblings enter the fray.

Malazan,3a7xt8,NickofSantaCruz,2,Thu Jun 18 13:41:08 2015 UTC,"Malazan Book of the Fallen (the ten book series, not necessarily other books set in the same world) is a series designed to be read more than once.  I'm on Book 5, and I've read each book twice, and I don't regret it, and I'll probably read the whole series a third time when I'm done.  I'm thankful that /r/malazan actually gives me a place to discuss an immense amount of information about an imaginary world.  Alternatively, if you just can't bring yourself to read each book twice as you go along, I highly recommend turning from each chapter to Tor.com's Malazan Reread of the Fallen.  It's almost as good as rereading it yourself, and spoiler free as long as you don't read ahead.  Here's a quote from author Steven Erikson's old AMA on /r/fantasy in which he explains why his writing delights those who read it twice:   Did I intentionally design the series for re-reads? A couple years back it occurred to me that I never really learned how to write a novel: I learned how to write short stories, and when I set to writing a novel I simply scaled up. So you can consider the ten book series as the longest short story ever written. I approached every line as if under the burden of carrying as much information as it could withstand, balanced against the elegance, rhythm, word-choice, of the sentence itself. Just like in a short story. It's no wonder the books do well as re-reads, because let's face it, who reads a novel as if it was short story? The text is packed. It's bursting at the seams. I must have been insane.   I highly recommend the series, but only if you want to make the commitment.  If you made it through WoT, I would imagine you can make it through MBotF -- but whereas WoT sometimes felt too slow, MBotF may sometimes feel too fast.  It both cases, it's worth sticking with it."
Malazan,3a7xt8,AllWrong74,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:14:22 2015 UTC,"That Short-story analogy really makes sense.

One of the cool things about wot was the foreshadowing, it is even more intense in malazan. As for characters, they are way more gray than in wot. The shifting povs are kind of jarring, not at all clearly stated so sometimes a whole page will go by without you realising that a different character has been introduced but you'll get used to it. Also there are a lot of humour similar to mat's humour from when Jordan wrote and not sanderson. As for reading any other series before getting into this, I don't think it's necessary. Also take breaks between the early books if you can resist the temptation, once book 6 starts you won't be able to put it down."

Malazan,3a7dc3,DJGebo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:09:15 2015 UTC,Yeah I've read all the books except some of ICEs which I'm gettin to now during my reread and I didn't get anything stating Pust is someone else other than a servant to shadow. What are you talking about????
Malazan,3a7dc3,Aiolus,2,Thu Jun 18 02:13:12 2015 UTC,Kruppe is my favorite character and Tehol is number two.   After those two come the more traditional hero types.
Malazan,3a7dc3,Montaron87,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:25:55 2015 UTC,"It's always funny to me how many people are fans of Kruppe. I always found him to more annoying than anything else. Tehol I can agree with, though."
Malazan,3a7dc3,Aiolus,3,Thu Jun 18 09:15:27 2015 UTC,YOU'RE A MONSTER!!!!  jk still can't believe you didn't like Kruppe. For me he was very much like a joyful and compassionate Sherlock Holmes type that revels in the absurd all the while working for good.  At least you like Tehol :-) though I think they share many traits their mannerisms are different enough.
Malazan,3a7dc3,mmSNAKE,2,Fri Jun 19 00:07:35 2015 UTC,"Gags between these two are fantastic. Such a grim series and then you get those two.  The book overall is very good. I didn't know what to think that the setting was completely new with only one previous character, but I had nothing to worry about. Outstanding book from start to the fantastic finish."

Malazan,3a6lmg,mortal_sword,7,Wed Jun 17 19:13:47 2015 UTC,Sharl was her name.  I've just about finished rereading the series for the first time too and just got to the point where she's dying and reveals the bit about her brothers.  Just an amazing bit to include in the story.
Malazan,3a6lmg,rileypunk,3,Wed Jun 17 22:43:14 2015 UTC,"Its all the little details Erikson puts in that really make the series exceptional, I mean after seeing Yedan, Sharl, Pithy and Brevity's struggle, its impossible not to hate the Liosan."
Malazan,3a6lmg,mortal_sword,4,Thu Jun 18 03:34:59 2015 UTC,"I was not a fan of the Shake storyline, and then the Hust and battle of Lightfall badassery started, and now Yedan is one of my favorite ""gives no fucks"" characters."
Malazan,3a6lmg,TriscuitCracker,8,Wed Jun 17 20:48:27 2015 UTC,I love his scene where the fights the random forkrul assail along the path.  My name has no power.  I am the Watch.  Or whateve he actually says.

Malazan,3a2kx9,ashtrayheart3,15,Tue Jun 16 19:01:43 2015 UTC,"Also, when Cotillion spoke with the apt-like-demon-boy about how he wasn't being punished for doing something wrong, and that his father would have helped him if he could have, I realized that these Ascendants can be more compassionate than I had previously given them credit for. Has anyone else had this somewhat heartwarming realization? Sure, he's a cold calculating killer with a vendetta, but he showed something close to love for this boy and the other 1300 child victims. I wish I could see more of this side of ""Uncle Cotillion,"" but I'm not sure that will be the case."
Malazan,3a2kx9,grixa,15,Tue Jun 16 19:07:27 2015 UTC,"You will see more of Cotillion, be sure of that. You will be amazed. I loved every moment of him."

Malazan,3a2kx9,PromisedPrince694,3,Thu Jun 18 14:03:34 2015 UTC,Yeah that was definitely one of the great moments of DG. I liked how unsure Cotillion seemed when doing it too. You can tell that he is not used to being in that kind of situation.   I had forgotten about the dogs part at the end. Probably reeling from seeing Mapp and Icarium appear again. The ending of that book was just exhausting.
Malazan,3a2kx9,unseenarchives,7,Wed Jun 17 00:56:05 2015 UTC,Roach and Bent :D Ah those dogs. Everyone loves them. Even some of the characters. And who can say they didn't completely understand why?
Malazan,3a2b9x,HomeSmash,8,Tue Jun 16 17:55:58 2015 UTC,"What you are feeling is normal and most of us felt the same way to a greater or lesser degree when we first started reading. yes it's definitely worth reading but it's not for the faint of heart and the books are not your typical light fantasy type. It's got a cast of hundreds, tons of plotlines, world building galore and it will make you laugh, cry, and cheer.  Each book has an overall plot that contributes to the series as a whole, as you read them you connect all the dots and see the big picture the author is trying to achieve.  Erikson's writing style can be intimidating and hard to get into at first. You feel like you got dropped into a foreign country with no understanding of the language, customs, and who are all these people?! This is normal! Give it two or three books until you get used to Erikson's style. Personally it didn't click for me until near the end of book 1. Remember the glossary at the back of the book and the dramatis personae are your friends. There is literally a cast of hundreds between all the books.  Erikson tends to not do info-dumps and can be heavy on the introspective philosophy. The first half of each book is usually character building, plot, history, etc, and the last quarter are when the epic craziness starts and next thing you know it's 4 in the morning and you have to work at 7 but you can't stop now. He wrote the first book 9 years before the second and it shows a bit, but he is an archeologist and an anthropologist so his world building skills are second to none. Every place a character visit feels ancient, every race you come across has an entire history to it, every millennia-old ascendant (powerful being) has several lifetimes of stories to tell.  You have to piece together the overall arching plot and other things, like how the magic system of warrens works, from clues and context of various characters and what you experience through the characters. It's all part of the fun, seeing how all this will fit together and where it's going. You go back and forth between continents and characters and plots. Imagine if you are a race of aliens coming to earth. You wouldn't know what anything means or stands for or how the world works, but if you live among them you pick stuff up until you get it. Malazan is like that. The more you read the more you understand. Not a lot is spoon fed to you.  It's an amazing, wonderful, crying into the books, epic ride. It's even better on a re-read in its own way. Of course, no series is for everybody, so if you don't like it, at least give it through book 2 or 3, but no shame if it's not for you. I hope you enjoy it! If you have any other questions about getting into the series post them here. We love newbies who are experiencing it for the first time. If you end up reading it and liking it and you have any questions we'll keep it spoiler free or tell you to read on! It's an amazing series, and definitely in my top 3 fave series."
Malazan,3a2b9x,TriscuitCracker,3,Tue Jun 16 18:28:23 2015 UTC,"I thought I would update. I went home and reread the part I was specifically having trouble with. I took it slow, used the information resources in the book every time I was unfamiliar with it. Once I got to the end it all made perfect sense!   Thanks for the encouragement. I think I'm going to have a lot of fun with these books!"
Malazan,3a2b9x,RonSnooder,3,Wed Jun 17 01:18:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! The whole ""getting dropped into a foreign world"" thing was how I talked about it with my girlfriend and I really like that idea. I just wanted to make sure that's what it actually was and I wasn't alone in the way I felt.  I am naturally a slow reader, because of this I can remember more detail in a book than almost anyone I know. Because of that I think I will enjoy the series once I get more immersed in the world.  Thank you so much for taking the time to write this out for me and making me feel welcome! I look forward to reading and getting involved in the community."
Malazan,3a2b9x,RonSnooder,2,Tue Jun 16 20:08:28 2015 UTC,"I don't have time to find the direct link right now, apologies, but look for the Tor Re-read of the Fallen.  Very good scene-by-scene chapter summaries to keep things straight, and a good analysis by a first time reader that really helped shed light on things I originally didn't pick up on.  Important: Do not read Bill's summaries. He has read the series before and includes spoilers from later books. Amanda is reading for the first time like us and just connecting dots that she sees. Sometimes there's a minor spoiler if Bill interjects or if she guesses something that you haven't, but overall they are very helpful.  I'm just beginning DG and found those extremely helpful for GotM. Also, enjoy it. That book is a hell of a ride. I loved it."

Malazan,3a2nzv,iamtheduff,6,Tue Jun 16 19:23:02 2015 UTC,"You don't have too, but personally, I'd put it down and finish the main series. You won't really miss much, the ICE books are all the sideplots that are only hinted at in the background of the main series.  Like Sage said, you may kill the pace of the Erikson books. Don't stop now!"
Malazan,3a2nzv,TriscuitCracker,4,Tue Jun 16 21:18:24 2015 UTC,This is pretty much all I was looking for. I can wait until finishing the MBotF main line first. I'd just been given the impression that RotCG fills in a few story holes. On to Toll the Hounds then!
Malazan,3a2nzv,internet_enthusiast,2,Tue Jun 16 22:10:38 2015 UTC,"I'd just been given the impression that RotCG fills in a few story holes.   What I heard was that a plot point in RotCG was spoiled by TtH.  Not sure if that's the case or not, but I'm inclined to finish the main series first before starting on the ICE books."
Malazan,3a2nzv,Jragghen,2,Wed Jun 17 02:39:23 2015 UTC,"The impact to TtH is that there are a few characters who you'll wonder how they got where they are, and it's explained in RotCG.  The main plot point from RotCG which is spoiled in the main series happened in TCG. And it's kinda a big'un."
Malazan,3a2nzv,SageOfTheWise,2,Thu Jun 18 07:42:56 2015 UTC,If you don't mind killing the pace of both stories be merging two series together. Did you read Night of Knives yet?

Malazan,3a271r,PaxCecilia,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:21:12 2015 UTC,"I can tell you from personal experience, reading the 'chapter summary' sections can help you understand the movement of the plot a lot more, but be a little wary of Amanda and Bill's commentary. Bill does this thing where he says ""file this"" and usually it's extremely telling that he's picking and choosing certain lines of foreshadowing, and it often gives away what is coming up in a very unsatisfying way.  Personally I'm not super averse to spoilers, but after having a few too many things given away I have stopped reading his summaries. They provide a lot of really valuable insight into character motivations from time to time, but I'd just as soon have the reveal be a bit more of a surprise and think back to the foreshadowing rather than have every little bit of foreshadowing bolded for me as I'm reading. The way Steven writes is so goddamn verbose that half the time red herrings, foreshadowing, and just straight up exposition and side stories are almost indistinguishable to the new reader.  (written from the perspective of someone who's currently reading Toll the Hounds, I've read the TOR chapter summaries along with the book since GotM)"
Malazan,3a271r,teamnewg,2,Fri Jun 19 14:58:41 2015 UTC,"I'm currently rereading after stopping after book 3 a few years ago.  I recommend you start from the beginning again.  First time around, I enjoyed GotM, but I got lost easily, and it took me several weeks to read (I usually read a novel in a day or two), then I enjoyed books 2 and 3 a lot more. School ramped up and I just didn't have the time to read anything that wasn't a textbook.  Second time around, GotM was a joy to read. I had vague, general recollections from last time, and that provided a solid framework to ensure I followed the story easily, and really kept up with who's who.  I'm currently 50% or so through deadhouse gates, and that too is way better than last time. A certain character cropped up very briefly, and I had a memory of their origin story which is still to come (in book 3 I think), and I'm looking forward to it immensely.  tl;dr: start from the beginning again, GotM is made to be read twice.  (edit: I'm not actually sure where I made it to last time, I think it was book 3 but it could have been further)"
Malazan,3a271r,internet_enthusiast,5,Tue Jun 16 18:02:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips, I'm gonna give the whole thing another go. I think that's the best way to get back in. I don't think I gave either books a proper treatment."
Malazan,3a271r,Valar05,2,Tue Jun 16 19:20:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think you need to re-read GotM (you can always read through it again after finishing the series; my understanding is that it becomes a lot more comprehensible the second time around).  Just skim through the summaries on the re-read of the fallen and then dive back into DG.  It's a great book, and you stopped at the point of the story where I really started to get engaged with the characters and their struggles."
Malazan,39zp7e,hollahoIIa,7,Tue Jun 16 02:24:13 2015 UTC,In TTH it is said that each crate of chasers has 12 but for some reason every 12th or 13th crate has a 13th cusser that was a dud
Malazan,39zp7e,DJGebo,2,Tue Jun 16 11:04:57 2015 UTC,Wasn't it more of a bakers dozen thing on the part of the moranth? They always put in a clay filled 13th. Not sure which book it is but kalams brother barathol gets out of a sticky situation using some fakes he threatens to drop on some thugs.

Malazan,39yobb,nieud,39,Mon Jun 15 21:29:49 2015 UTC,"I personally hope they never make an adaptation. No one could do it justice. A few years back there was discussion on the official forums about a potential film of just the Chain of Dogs section from DG but nothing came of it.  As for popularity, it is definitely picking up fans and fantasy is doing well as a genre. But Malazan is a step above what a vast majority of fantasy readers are willing to invest in - time, money and of course emotional investment. We just have to keep spreading the word!    I think that is why most Malazan fans I know & chat to are so happy to help others, answer questions & chat about the books - we want people to love them as much as we do but know that some might need some encouragement along the way."
Malazan,39yobb,TisteSimeon,7,Mon Jun 15 21:57:35 2015 UTC,"You are probably right about the adaptation, it would probably be very watered down and condensed. for example, Game of Thrones worked for the first few seasons because they stayed close to the books, but the newer seasons are becoming worse IMO. After watching the season 5 finale last night, I realized that season 5 was probably the worst season yet. It's even worse that the show will now overtake the books. I guess that wouldn't be a problem with Malazan since it is finished."
Malazan,39yobb,Priest_of_Aroo,6,Mon Jun 15 22:21:01 2015 UTC,"Spot on about GoT, the only adaptations that would work would be long running HBO or Netflix like series or an anime, in my opinion."
Malazan,39yobb,Partybar,8,Mon Jun 15 22:37:05 2015 UTC,I feel as though an anime is the only way it could work with the Warren and stuff
Malazan,39yobb,yxhuvud,5,Mon Jun 15 23:15:36 2015 UTC,"I could possibly see a game adaption set in the Malazan multiverse though, but maybe not of people driving the main story. For example, imagine a game where you are playing a squad of marines in book two, three, six or seven, or RotCG, or so. There are quite a lot of possibilities to get awesome there.  Heck, the battle in RotCG is sufficient for a game all by itself."
Malazan,39yobb,TisteSimeon,3,Tue Jun 16 13:10:01 2015 UTC,I would pay whatever they asked for such a game!
Malazan,39yobb,BirdBathandBeyond,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:45:42 2015 UTC,An open world RPG like the Elder Scrolls games or the Witcher would be really cool in the Malazan universe.  So many possibilities for character creation and quests!

""we’re in serious talks with a RPG 20D group who are keen to adapt the Malazan universe to a game. If this goes ahead, well, it will of necessity involve a release of all the relevant maps and game-notes presently occupying a cardboard box in my garage, and those from Cam as well. Said project demands full disclosure, don’t you think?

But based on past popularity examples of fiction, as well as current trends of entertainment, I would say not very likely. At least not to massive world wide recognition in comparison to something like Harry Potter or A Song of Ice and Fire."
Malazan,39yobb,AllWrong74,3,Tue Jun 16 15:23:04 2015 UTC,"I doubt it will ever be more popular.  This series is like Fantasy's doctoral thesis work.  Only the advanced fantasy reader will really keep up with all that's going on.  It's written in a style that is so diametrically opposed to the popular writing styles that most people either can't follow along, or don't enjoy following along."

The re-read is in its own way just as good as your first read. I suggest reading ICE books and Forge of Darkness before however. Glad you liked the series! Congratulations on making it.
Malazan,39xy4z,mortal_sword,6,Tue Jun 16 07:07:45 2015 UTC,"Hey, I recently finished the Crippled God as well, what a brilliant series! Fiddler's playing was a highlight for sure and Gesler and Stormy was sad as hell, especially considering they'd been around for so long!( Rereading DG who'd have thought those two random Coast Guards would end up leading an army of K'chain Che'malle to go steal the Crippled God's heart from a Forkrul Assail, wtf) As for your questions, I haven't read FoD of ICE's books so I might be wrong but here's what I remember:   Yeah its Yedan vs one of the Liosan Soletaken. Yeah Icarium was probably my favorite, was surprised he didn't do anything but Erikon always misdirects like how Silchas Ruin looked like he was gonna **** stuff up in Letheras but didn't. ( And anyway if Icarium woke up he'd probably have killed everybody so its good he didn't) His ending is sad as hell as well. Draconus was sort of a loose end really, but he did kill two Elders and was specifically told not to enter the convergence so... who knows? The older gods took the CG's power during the chainings and I guess Cotillion and ST being new gods didn't have that advantage and wanted to ensure no one could utilize the power to get ahead of the other gods again. Also I think (?) the other Gods were weakened as well, having the CG taken away, having no more access at all. They also did it to be nice in the end. Not sure on that one, I think Traveler's in the ICE books though so... although I don't even think Dassem could even beat Hood after seeing Hood kick some ass and eat faces. Not sure maybe the demon who hangs out in Smiley's in Bonehunters?   Sorry I'm not sure on some of the questions. And I agree what a ride, best series I've read hands down.... like how In HoC Karsa enters a 'child's' house and destroys an alter to a boar god...."
Malazan,39xy4z,TwoColdOne,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:55:42 2015 UTC,"RE: 1. I started a whole thread regarding the covers of the books. There is a subtle difference between two editions of this book - once contains a multi-headed dragon emerging from the storm, very obviously making it TIAM.  While the other has a single head, and would support the theory of Lightfall. I wonder if someone in the publishing chain changed their mind?"
Malazan,39xy4z,TocTheEternal,6,Tue Jun 16 08:14:48 2015 UTC,"I think that Yedan is a good guess, but personally I think that it is a Bonehunter. Dunno if it is a specific one, but it does kinda look like Fener in the sky. He did successfully create new warrens, those were what Sinn and Grub were running around in for most of the book.  His spirit also came into play by fixing/operating that skykeep (Ampealeas? Kalse? Don't remember the name) in the fight with the Nah'ruk at the end of DoD. Doesn't he kill Kilmandaros and Sechul Lath? I also think that his return is more of a resolution or response to the void that Anomander left and the return of Mother Dark. Also, his re-emergence into the world obliterated almost the entire remaining Barghast armies and the barbarian horsemen they were fighting in an icy cataclysm. The Crippled God was being drained for power by other Ascendants and factions. The Crippled God himself was an alien force that was actively and passively undoing the gift of K'rul by tainting his blood (the warrens). And finally, the Jade Giants containing the spirits of his native worshippers were landing which would cause devastation. He needed to be banished. He was on a hopeless quest of revenge against Hood, and fought Anomander to continue it. Anomander instead allowed himself to be killed. If you read OST by Esslemont, you'll see him again. That particular quest of his is over though. The bartender of Kellanved's old tavern before he started plotting his conquests (I can't remember the name for some reason) is a powerful demon. It's where all those Malazan oldtimers would hang out."
Malazan,39xy4z,TocTheEternal,2,Mon Jun 15 19:55:45 2015 UTC,"Doesn't he kill Kilmandaros and Sechul Lath?   He does. It just seemed odd for such a powerful being to be omitted from the giant convergence at the end (the confrontation with Kilmandaros and Sechul Lath happens a bit before).   The Crippled God was being drained for power by other Ascendants and factions. The Crippled God himself was an alien force that was actively and passively undoing the gift of K'rul by tainting his blood (the warrens).   Hmm, it seems I missed out on the magnitude of this. I knew the Forkrul Assail at least were feeding on him for genocidal reasons, but there was apparently more going on here."

I felt like there were a lot of loose ends there, too. A commonly recurring theme (and Hood's motivation for everything since the War Against Death until the very end) was that the gods all didn't care about the souls of their worshipers when they died, and that none of them took their souls into their realm like they should, but just left them to Hood.  Cotillion (or Shadowthrone, don't remember), and Hood, say at one point or another that they are going to 'force' the gods to take care of their worshipers. Is this accomplished? I don't think so.  Also, about Fener. Wasn't Fener in the Errant's hideout in Lether? How does the shattering of a statue in Darujistan make a hugely enlarged version of Fener's body appear above Kolanse and split in two? Of all the weird things in the book, that one made by far the least sense to me."

Malazan,39z1df,the_bridgeburner,7,Tue Jun 16 01:11:55 2015 UTC,ICE is writing a prequel trilogy that takes place during the early stages of the Empire. The first book is going to be called Dancer's Lament.

Malazan,39y1l7,wjbc,3,Mon Jun 15 18:50:27 2015 UTC,"Best part of this book was easily the flashbacks to Temper and Dassem at Y'Ghatan. Really enjoyed all of that.     In general, though, Esslemont spells things out more than Erikson.    Oh don't worry, Esslemont will 'fix' this. In later books he really starts to enjoy arbitrarily never mentioning characters by names in some scenes and you just have to guess who's doing what. It's pretty frustrating."
Malazan,39y1l7,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:14:43 2015 UTC,"Hmm, not sure that's a fix.  But you did put it in quotes."
Malazan,39y1l7,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:18:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was joking."
Malazan,39y1l7,Aiolus,3,Mon Jun 15 21:43:16 2015 UTC,This was one of my favorite of his stories (not saying much). Though overall it was blah. I liked Temper and hated Kiska.  I was fine with reading it and have read all of his books. I just don't like his writing overall. The central characters always seem to lack something. I will continue reading his Malazan novels and hope to be surprised but if he wrote something outside the world I wouldn't pick it up.   Anyways Erikson is coming out with Fall of Light (I forget if that's the right title) and I am super excited about that.
Malazan,39y1l7,TocTheEternal,2,Tue Jun 16 02:23:03 2015 UTC,"NoK definitely feels like a beginner's effort, and there are several aspects that feel like pale imitations of Erikson's style.  A lot of the focus and pacing is questionable, and I imagine that this particular event could have been portrayed in a much better manner were either author to attempt it now.  ICE's writing remains a bit wobbly and some plot threads are a bit unfocused in RotCH, but I think that it is an improvement and that his subsequent works are on a much higher level and generally get better as you go on. I particularly like Assail and Stonewielder.  ICE does start to develop his own threads independent of the MBotF that continue through most of his works. For instance, he follows the doings of the Crimson Guard to a similar degree that Erikson follows the Malazan Empire. More relevant to NoK in particular, Kiska and Tayschrenn continue to show up later on."
Malazan,39y1l7,the_bridgeburner,2,Mon Jun 15 20:42:41 2015 UTC,"Why does everyone call Esslemont ""ICE""?  Just easier to write?"

Malazan,39w107,darkazoth,5,Mon Jun 15 06:48:32 2015 UTC,"Midnight Tides is supposed to have taken place about four to five years before GotM, in 1159 Burn's Sleep. Gardens of the Moon (ignoring the prologue and first chapter) takes place in 1163 Burn's sleep. House of Chains probably takes place a few months to a year or two afterwards.  But there are a load of inconsistencies, though, such as how Trull would have survived five whole years being chained in the Nascent before Onrack finds him. Unless there's a gap in time between Onrack freeing Trull and them protecting the Throne of Shadow, but I don't think there is."
Malazan,39w107,Oathsend,11,Mon Jun 15 08:36:33 2015 UTC,I think there was magic in what trull was bound to because when on rack freed him he said he needed water now so it was possible he was there for that amount of time without needing food or water
Malazan,39w107,ChickenManT,2,Mon Jun 15 11:22:27 2015 UTC,"I must have missed that on my first read of MT. Makes it vaguely feasible instead of pretty damn impossible, at least."
Malazan,39w107,Oathsend,2,Mon Jun 15 23:35:54 2015 UTC,Yea I think the point was that whoever chained him wanted him to suffer as much as possible.  In which case it's more impressive that he isn't stark raving mad after 5 years of doing nothing.
Malazan,39w107,shoots_and_leaves,3,Tue Jun 16 11:00:53 2015 UTC,"The magic used to bind him reduced bodily needs. He mentions, when freed, that he is starting to feel hungry again and tries to get onrack to hunt those weird mutated seal things."

I know there's mention of some of the Bridgeburners making games up to play with them, but they're the one - like Fiddler - who have some connection to them, and its just more of a variation on a reading than an actual game with rules. In fact it says when they do it that they're just completely making things up as they go along."
Malazan,39rlmr,Lord_Rob,4,Sun Jun 14 13:03:43 2015 UTC,Yes! How is this not a thing already?? Someone should've made at least the cards by now. I have contemplated making my own.
Malazan,39rlmr,cylons_R_people_2,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:23:45 2015 UTC,Someone most have sold a deck on Etsy at some point...
Malazan,39rlmr,Phhhhuh,4,Sun Jun 14 11:10:41 2015 UTC,"There are games designed for a tarot deck, I suppose this would be similar since the Deck of Dragons is heavily inspired by tarot. Note that card games typically use a full tarot deck (both minor and major arcana). When most people think of tarot they think only of the major arcana, which is a sequence of icons/symbols, and that is the part of a tarot deck which is commonly used for divination. But a full deck also includes the minor arcana, which is a lot like a normal deck of cards in that it is composed of ascending cards in four suits (goblets/chalices, coins, swords and staves/wands). Those suits remind me of the houses in the Deck of Dragons, while the major arcana would be unaligned. Then it becomes a bit more complicated, because I believe that not every house (or suit) in the Deck has an equal number of cards?  It seems that most games played with a tarot deck is trick taking games, where the major arcana functions as a suit of trump cards, and The Fool (number 0) is an ""excuse"" that excuses the player from following suit. Perhaps one could take a look at those games to design a really interesting game based on the Deck! One of the best card games I know of is bezique, where one takes tricks, but the real objective is to be able to put down different combinations of cards on the table. A ""pair"" for instance, is a King and Queen of the same suit, and gives 20 points, a pair in the trump suit gives 40 points. One may only put something down on the table by taking a trick first, so that's the only point of the tricks. Bezique is usually played with a common deck of cards, but it could easily be translated to tarot (and therefore to a Deck of Dragons). The real problem, I guess, is that bezique is a two-player game, so if one wants to include more players we'd need to tweak the rules.  There are some other good trick-taking games out there, I'd suggest trying to scavenge the best features from several of them to adapt a game for a Deck of Dragons."
Malazan,39rlmr,Phhhhuh,2,Sun Jun 14 15:52:32 2015 UTC,Isn't it know that there's no rules to the game? Just what Fiddler makes up as he goes along.

Malazan,39rzvp,improperly_paranoid,3,Mon Jun 15 15:42:54 2015 UTC,"It depends. Some of the characters appear in most books, but there are others you'll only see in one book and then never again (and not necessarily because they die). The cast changes from book to book along with the setting - from example, most of the characters from Gardens of the Moon are not there for Deadhouse Gates because it takes place on another continent, but some of them are back in Memories of Ice (along with a shitload of new characters), which happens on the same continent again and so on."
Malazan,39rzvp,gogomom,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:17:51 2015 UTC,"Erikson doesn't seem to leave books with a ton of cliffhangers - in other words what your building up to in each book concludes (for now, somewhat anyway).    That said, I couldn't just pick one book out of the series and read it independent of the others - there is just too much backstory to each person and place.  Plus, he doesn't write ""down"" to his readers, very little recapping is done, so even though you haven't seen or heard of a character in 3 books doesn't mean the next 3 chapters are not going to be dedicated to this character and their situation."

Malazan,39ks43,CakeStrider,11,Fri Jun 12 12:32:17 2015 UTC,Oponn is the god/gods of chance. They basically just like to throw things in disarray
Malazan,39ks43,stanglemeir,7,Fri Jun 12 14:02:48 2015 UTC,"Oponn resurrects Captain Paran and blesses his sword in direct opposition to Cotillion, who was, while possessing Sorry, responsible for Captain Paran's death.  Cotillion wanted him dead, so Oponn resurrected him and also gave him a sword that could keep him alive.  It's unclear whether the plans went beyond that.    Why did Oponn oppose Cotillion?  Maybe for no reason.  But there's something Erikson said about assassins, that they were problem solvers -- although the solution usually involved killing someone.  Oponn probably didn't like problems to be solved, he preferred to keep the game going.  Similarly, Oponn may have given Crokus the coin in order to screw with the plans of Anomander Rake, the Knight of Darkness.  Rake is another problem solver, and again this may have been enough reason for Oponn to interfere.  Rake (or his minions) wanted Crokus dead, so Oponn kept him alive.  Oponn may not have been clear on the consequences of either of these actions.  Certainly he did not anticipate that Captain Paran would give the sword Chance to Cotillion, thus giving Cotillion a hold over the twins."
Malazan,39ks43,wjbc,12,Fri Jun 12 17:19:07 2015 UTC,"They are the gods of chance and randomness. There motive is merely to screw over other peoples plans. I'd say Paran is the more obvious one here. Because of Oponn's intervention, he was around to cause Shadowthrone and Cotillion to be completely removed from the events surrounding Darujhistan, and then ironically enough, he himself removed Oponn as well.  With Crokus it's kind of more the coin that's important. There's just a lot of times where it comes up in the book and some outcome changes, I can't remember them all. Often time it's just mentioned as someone changing their mind about something as they hear a coin drop. The big ones I remember is Crokus' initial acquisition of it saves his life, and the assassin mistakenly trying to kill him remains distracted by Crokus long enough for his real assailants to kill him... on K'rul's belfry, which makes it an accidental blood sacrifice to the elder god and awakens him from like a millennia of non existence. Also Rallick and Murillio's plan with Lady Simtal is just to kill her, but right before Rallick does that he hears the coin and comes up with a different plan that takes up the bulk of the book. There's other things but it's been so long since I've read the book.  And of course just in general, Crokus and Paran would both be dead without the intervention, so literally anything they do in the ten books can be linked back to this."

Malazan,39ks43,Montaron87,7,Fri Jun 12 14:51:11 2015 UTC,"I think this is kind of a combination of GOTM-isms and Oponn not really having a motive and just doing things for shits and giggles.

From there Kalam sets off, fools around Raraku and the book and Fiddler, Crokus and Apsalar end up in Raraku as well. But as far as I know, they set sail on Genabackis, on a lake, and next thing I remember they're in Seven Cities on a different continent. I guess I need to find the book again to fill in the gap :D"

I was already frustrated and reading that motivated me to stop rereading that series and find something new. I wrote down three books from the list of top fantasy novels on reddit. Wheel of Time,  The Name of the Wind and Malazan. I told my brother, who was also pretty disappointed at the news, and we went to the book store. He picked up The Name of the Wind and I was stuck staring at Eye of the World and Gardens of the Moon. Honestly, I picked it on a whim and that choice legitimately changed my life. This series helped me during the hardest time in my life, and helped me get over the emotional stress and regret that came with a five year heroin addiction. It has taken the place of ASOIAF as my favorite peice of media I have encountered. I finished The Crippled God a few nights ago, and am already 300 pages into GOTM. Thank you Steven.

It didn't sell very much but just enough to keep one of each of the ten main series in stock.  Then in about 2011 I took the plunge and bought Gardens of the Moon. Was saying in my head 'wtf is going on' for half the book but the sheer scope and the visual imagery (Anomander attacking Pale, Paran going into Dragnipur, Sorry's possession, Tool and the idea of the T'Lan I'mass, Kruppe's mannerisms, Hairlock and Quick Ben, the chaos warrens, the demon that gets summoned in Darujhistan) kept me going, because I could see there was a TON of world building and potential to this series and frankly, though I had a hard time with it at first, I wanted to see how it all ended. I was also lucky in the fact I had an hour long train ride to and from work, plenty of reading time, and I often had to phone my wife and let her know I would be late because I embarrassedly missed my stop because I had my nose buried in a Malazan book. DG hooked me with the Icarium/Mappo duo and the tragedy of the Chain. MoI then further cemented my feelings for the series, and here I am, the subreddit I most visit being about a man named Beak, a really fast magician and his wacky pals, and a Jaghut with a cat named Tufty."

I don't know, maybe it was just recognizing it, but I remember quite clearly having seen it before.

I took it home and started my reading, but I didn't get very far before I realised that my English wasn't really up to the task (non-native speaker), so I put it on a shelf for a few years, before I picked it to go with me on a holiday trip. I was caught up in it completely and thoroughly enjoyed the book.

IIRC the seven imass warn him not to try and take such a large piece as it is impossible etc etc  But Karsa don't care, too many words.  Witness."

Malazan,39gnfi,wjbc,4,Thu Jun 11 23:05:00 2015 UTC,"This one, only you know, 8 feet long, is pretty much how I picture his."
Malazan,39gnfi,KrugSmash,2,Thu Jun 11 20:19:18 2015 UTC,I picture it with the same ridged flint texture but for shape i had it straighter kind of like http://imgur.com/wfDjPLP but again 8 foot long and instead of the hilt and handle it would taper off into a handle like in your image.  Also would expect it to be a dark blue/grey colour.
Malazan,39gwwu,nothingcleverleft,5,Thu Jun 11 17:16:18 2015 UTC,"You can read FOD before reading ICE, but I absolutely recommend reading ICE, it fleshes out lots of backstory and characters that was/were only hinted at in the main series.   Absolutely pick up FoD, and learn lots of tantalizing things about the Titse Andii, Mother Dark, Anomander, Draconus, the Azath, many Ascendants you've already read about, and many many more questions than answers of course lol  Glad you enjoyed Crippled God! It truly is an amazing series."
Malazan,39gwwu,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:12:38 2015 UTC,What did you think of FOD? How did it hold up against the best of the Book of the Fallen?
Malazan,39gwwu,TriscuitCracker,4,Thu Jun 11 20:01:36 2015 UTC,"Well it's the start of a trilogy, so it's unfinished in what happens, but I'd put it it solidly in the middle in terms of quality of the main series. I love seeing all these powerful characters thousands of years earlier, and how it all came about, and all the speculation that came about from reading it.  It can be a bit dense at times, but that's normal with Erikson.  It's also faster paced than a main series book in my opinion. I read it really quickly."
Malazan,39gwwu,TriscuitCracker,2,Thu Jun 11 20:07:29 2015 UTC,"That's awesome to hear. Even looking at the map and character list blew my mind. The history is already so rich that I feel as if I know more about the history of that world than our own. I love the dense style more than anything. It makes the intensity of the endings hit much harder. The more dense, the more rewarding in my experience. Thanks for your input man. I have nobody around me to talk about this series with, so I resort to reddit."
Malazan,39gwwu,pseudo86,3,Thu Jun 11 20:11:28 2015 UTC,That's pretty much everybody here lol
Malazan,39gwwu,pseudo86,2,Thu Jun 11 20:23:23 2015 UTC,"I would suggest trying out the ICE books (Night of Knives is the first one) gives you a lot of background of what was happening to the Malazan Empire whilst the Erikson series was happening, and in particular fleshes out Tayshrenn's character and motivations which is something that is desperately needed."
Malazan,39gwwu,sonofa2,2,Thu Jun 11 17:27:32 2015 UTC,"I will be reading then eventually, I have the first one. I just really love Erikson's writing and I would rather read FOD before going to ICE novels, as his writing style just doesn't do it for me, not after reading top notch writing for the past year. I will read them eventually, but I am on an Erikson kick at the moment. Thank you for responding!"
Malazan,39gwwu,sonofa2,3,Thu Jun 11 17:53:56 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be fooled by the first one. As far as I can tell, he's trying to do something a bit clever by commenting on ""new"" fantasy (represented by the old soldier) vs. ""old"" fantasy (represented by the young girl) but I'm not sure that necessarily comes across ; it just appears incredibly jolting in tone as it shifts between the two perspectives."
Malazan,39gwwu,cantlurkanymore,2,Thu Jun 11 18:15:43 2015 UTC,"I'll keep that in mind. I read the first 15 pages and decided to just keep going with the main series. It was like going from Hemingway to Rowling, it just seemed very YA in it's style. Thank you for the encouragement though."

Malazan,39brye,wjbc,6,Wed Jun 10 18:18:50 2015 UTC,"It's a glottal stop. You just pretty much never see them explicitly in regular english words because english will just use something like a hyphen instead, or just spell the word without one and expect you to already know how it's pronounced (English can be an asshole like that)."
Malazan,39brye,SageOfTheWise,5,Wed Jun 10 18:45:13 2015 UTC,"Glottal stop:       The glottal stop is a type of consonantal sound used in many spoken languages, produced by obstructing airflow in the vocal tract or, more precisely, the glottis. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is ⟨ʔ⟩.  In English, the glottal stop is represented, for example, by the hyphen in uh-oh!. For most United States English speakers, a glottal stop is used as an allophone of /t/ between a vowel and a syllabic ""n"", as in button or mountain, except when talking slowly.

Malazan,39amqe,PunkMoon,4,Wed Jun 10 13:26:51 2015 UTC,"I suspect that you will find a similar 2/3 - 1/3 split in pacing in many of the books, though there are a couple of exceptions.  You have a couple of questions here and there in your post to which I can just say that nothing has been resolved yet. Fener and the results of his fall have not fully come into play yet.  Additionally, you've not really even encountered the antagonist of the main storyline yet. In fact, the unifying plot thread of the entire series only barely gets introduced in the next book you read, and even then it is just sort of a launching point."
Malazan,39amqe,TocTheEternal,3,Wed Jun 10 14:48:53 2015 UTC,"Not only is Erikson playing a long game, he also engages in misdirection.  He doesn't necessarily follow up on everything that could have led to a new story.  And when he does follow up, he often takes it in an unexpected direction."
Malazan,39amqe,wjbc,3,Wed Jun 10 15:04:35 2015 UTC,"Speaking of Fener: Has that been resolved? Last I recall, he was pulled into the world via by Heboric, Baudin, and Felisin, but I don't remember reading any resolution to that. Maybe I missed something subtle.   Nope, you didn't miss anything. The fate of Fener and the empty throne of war is a continuing plotline through many of the remaining books."

Malazan,39ba8d,SageOfTheWise,2,Wed Jun 10 17:41:03 2015 UTC,"I don't remember if she would be mentioned there. It's possible though. Apparently there is some mention in the series of Sheltaha Lore being Envy and Spite's mother, maybe that's it. Not that much stock should be taken in that though, the second the Tiste enter your family tree it becomes almost impossible to figure out what's true or not.

Malazan,3965lj,SKR47CH,2,Tue Jun 9 19:17:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe it hit me harder than most, maybe it was the combination of ""ah, now I get these guys,"" and ""shit, something really messed up is going on."" Because prior to that line I was slightly confused as to what was happening."
Malazan,3965lj,wjbc,2,Tue Jun 9 20:44:39 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.  The whole ""pawn"" thing has it's downside, especially in a world with fallible and often negligent gods.  Better to have leverage with a god, even power over them, or at least power to bargain with them, which amazingly enough is possible in Erikson's fantasy.  Perhaps the best is to make them afraid of you -- again, it can happen."
Malazan,3965lj,wjbc,2,Tue Jun 9 19:39:21 2015 UTC,"I just love how nonchalant that character was about such a line, because there is a lot of weight to it, yet it's put so simply."

The tragedy of Rhulad, the hilarity of Tehol and Bugg, the Lether society, the nobility of Brys. Erikson excels at endings.   Now in Bonehunters, all the plotlines from books 1-5 will slowly start to converge into the last two books. Convergence with a Capitol C.  Hang on for dear life.   And as for Bonehunters...prepare to sweat. You'll see what I mean."

As for epic scenes, you hit the nail on the head.

However, the siege of Capustan was fucking fantastic in MoI. Gruntle's story is just.. amazing. Battling on the roof top, killing so many people that the bodies pile up to the first floor.  I also really, really enjoyed Toc, Tool's and Lady Envy's journey too.   Can you remind me about:    the reunion of Togg and Fanderay   Am I right in thinking 1 of these wolves was traveling with Lady Envy's party? Where did the other wolf come from? Was Toc a vessel for Togg's soul? Something like that?"
Malazan,3945ig,wjbc,3,Tue Jun 9 14:34:58 2015 UTC,"You got it.  Togg was lost in the Warrens of Chaos until he came across Toc.  He used Toc to get out of the warrens, but then he needed to get out of Toc.   Fanderay, meanwhile, was in the body of Baaljagg, Lady Envy's giant ay."

Malazan,3938mb,TriscuitCracker,2,Tue Jun 9 00:49:43 2015 UTC,"Don't worry you'll head back to Genebackis and all you're Bridgeburner pals in Memories of Ice.    When I read GOTM and started Deadhouse I wanted to stay with my GOTM pals too.  Then by the time I finished DG I didn't want to go back to my GOTM pals, I like the DG stories too much!  Then by the time I finished MoI I didn't want to swap again, I liked my MoI pals!  Now I'm about to finish HoC and I don't want to go back to my MoI pals! :)"
Malazan,3938mb,Clearly_a_fake_name,3,Tue Jun 9 14:39:12 2015 UTC,"Welp, you're not going back to you MoI pals in the next book.  Midnight Tides introduces a whole new cast of characters except for Trull Sengar, and it takes place in the continent of Lether in the time before the events of Gardens of the Moon.  Don't be discouraged, though. It might take a while to get into it, but it is an excellent book, many people's favourite, in fact, and like before you will not want to go back to your old pals.  Midnight Tides presents the last of the three main storylines in the Malazan series. After that book, all the plots will start to converge and will culminate in the epic climax of The Crippled God.  You have good times ahead of you. Enjoy it!"
Malazan,3938mb,grixa,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:38:15 2015 UTC,"Yep, same here. I'm about 75% in and have been having a blast with DG. I'm taking the rest of the night off from reading because I know shit is about to get crazy and I don't want to wreck my sleep schedule tonight, hah."
Malazan,392ptg,Wounded_Hypothosis,12,Mon Jun 8 20:45:43 2015 UTC,"Gardens of the Moon. Forge of Darkness you should read after you're done the main series.   Happy reading! post your impressions or questions, we'll try and keep it spoiler free."
Malazan,392ptg,TriscuitCracker,7,Mon Jun 8 21:26:30 2015 UTC,I wouldn't start with Forge of Darkness for the reasons given so far.   I also wouldn't start with Forge of Darkness because the other two prequels are as yet unpublished.
Malazan,392ptg,Lankles,6,Mon Jun 8 22:42:01 2015 UTC,"Karkhanas is not a good place to start, largely because it's not done.  There's two books still coming, and you'd be putting off reading the core series by 3-4 years just to trot through a prequel that isn't necessarily the gentlest starting point.    I suspect the whole Karkhanas series may make for an interesting primer and involve a certain amount of exposition that would be useful in reading the core series, but FoD sure barely delivered on that, and the few details it's provided are more interesting trivia than useful information in understanding the world or plot of the core series."
Malazan,392ptg,Anomander,6,Mon Jun 8 22:46:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely the main series.  I believe that Erikson himself has said that the prequel trilogy is meant to also be a good place to start, but despite him being the author I think that he is dead wrong.  Forge of Darkness's appeal and readability depend heavily on the information and preconceived notions that you develop from reading the MBotF.  Basically, Forge of Darkness would likely leave you bored and confused, and this would be particularly unsatisfying because the trilogy only has one book published so far.  Gardens of the Moon will also likely leave you a little bit confused (though hopefully not bored) about certain aspects (this is to be expected), but piecing things together is part of the charm of the series as you continue reading it."
Malazan,392ptg,TocTheEternal,3,Mon Jun 8 21:40:01 2015 UTC,"I would certainly not recommend to start with FoD, but I did find when I read it, I had some preconceptions about what would happen, that caused me to wait for it, instead of revisiting my ideas and just enjoy the story. A reread will fix that :)"

That is the daughter of the head of the D'arle house. The D'arle's are old and established, and the head of the house (who's name I can't remember) was portrayed as a fairly wise, competent, and reasonable Councilman. This maiden daughter ends up with Gorlas Vidikas by OST, and she's not very happy with it.  Nom: This house is a minor one that is mostly defunct by the events of GotM. Rallick Nom, the assassin, is distantly related to the main branch. Torvald Nom, the guy who helps out Karsa a bunch in HoC and does some stuff in Darujhistan in TTH is also fairly disconnected with the family but is familiar with Rallick.  This is how he ends up inheriting the Council seat.  Coll: I don't remember what his house's name is, but basically he let himself get stripped of his inheritance by that golddigger woman who was the target of Murillo and Rallick's plot in GotM.  Murullo drives her to suicide when Rallick is assassinating her new lover (a Lim family member).  He is then able to recover his title and sobriety.  Lim: Just another fairly powerful and well established house. In general the various head of this house that we encounter are part of the conspiracies and politics that work against the interests of most of the factions and characters we might consider protagonists. This can basically be said of the House Orr as well."
Malazan,391u7t,TocTheEternal,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:34:46 2015 UTC,"I believe the one who was killed was Shardan Lim, correct?   And thanks for the D'arle one. I somehow remembered that the maiden was supposed to marry a heir of D'arle. Totally got it wrong.. Thanks.  Also, there's Bellam Nom there.. how's he related."
Malazan,391u7t,TocTheEternal,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:41:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Shardan Lim sounds familiar.  None of the Nom relations are actually explicit. It is just a family with scattered relations that happens to have a council seat. Bellam is just another of them. I think that Rallick and Torvald know him, but otherwise he's just a minor nobleman. Rallick and Torvald seem to have had more common upbringings, though not necessarily poor ones."

A thigh bone is a leg bone, I don't see a discrepancy.  I don't think the omen was about Whiskeyjack, and certainly that's not what the soldiers got out of it.    The soldiers turned the omen by embracing it.  It's like the Day of the Dead, when people wear skeleton masks or eat skeleton cookies, or Halloween for that matter.  It's like the difference between telling your child there are no monsters in the closet, or using a paper sword or monster spray to get rid of the monster, or maybe even pretending it's a friendly monster who just wants a tickle.  By embracing bones as part of their uniforms and, eventually, their standard, they rob the omen of its power."
Malazan,38zhjn,wjbc,2,Mon Jun 8 06:31:33 2015 UTC,"For your second question: It's basically the Malazan soldier's fatalist attitude that is persistent throughout the books that allows Fiddler's scheme to work.  It's hard being a soldier and facing death every day.  The Malazans turn this fact on its head and laugh, joke, or embrace death as a means of making themselves feel better.  So when a bad omen comes up, portending more hardship, their mentality shields them.  ""Fuck it right guys?  We were going to die anyway.""  Fiddler just helped them all remember it with the bones.  Now it's plain on everyone's person, and they can laugh at Hood and show their courage instead of fearing fear.    Also, as I remember it, fingerbones are what some wore, but I think many soldiers just used any sort of bone they could find, provided it was relatively small."

Although now I don't have as much time as before.  It has to do, partly, with the fact that you spend most of the time wondering what in Hood's name is going on, so experiencing the story knowing the characters, events and the mythology from the start might be very rewarding. That, and all the hints and the foreshadowing you didn't catch the first time.  I also find comfort in the sense of familiarity of the things I love."

Malazan,38ulp6,wjbc,6,Sat Jun 6 23:29:26 2015 UTC,Nice write up! Just gonna share a couple of my thoughts as well.  Karsa... my most complicated Malazan relationship (I think). I do not think I like him but I do respect his transformation. I really liked that Erikson forced me to view things from his perspective. Also to be honest I typically HATE characters who are new to their super awesome powers and also ones who don't understand how powerful they are (Karsa for long periods).  Killing her sister was rough :( sad times. Felesin was one of the characters I was most sympathetic towards from DG.   Your other point about moral ambiguity is true. Life is terribly ambiguous and ultimately unfair. Erikson doesn't pull punches which is refreshing but he doesn't make it all bad (though the world is super harsh as you said).  Anyways I liked your write up. Checking out the others.
Malazan,38ulp6,Aiolus,3,Sun Jun 7 01:13:12 2015 UTC,I'd rather be raped than have my genitals mutilated.  But that's just me.
Malazan,38ulp6,NotYoursToCut,2,Sun Jun 7 01:26:23 2015 UTC,What about having your hands and feet cut off and then being left to beg for food?
Malazan,38ulp6,NotYoursToCut,2,Sun Jun 7 04:31:08 2015 UTC,I suppose I would sacrifice the sexual pleasure of having clitoris/labia/foreskin/whatever else people cut off in genital mutilation in order to save my hands and feet.  It's not like I would be getting laid much (or even masturbating for that matter) without hands and feet and unbegged-for-food.

Malazan,38ttza,Wounded_Hypothosis,6,Sat Jun 6 19:39:09 2015 UTC,"Yep. Most important thing is you're just about to start reading one of the greatest fantasy series ever.  A couple things to keep in mind. It is a large world and you get thrown right into the middle of it. You don't get all the answers/explanations right away, and I think it really helps with the world-building. It can turn off certain people.   Also, there are a lot of characters/sub-plots. It's okay if you lose track of some of them. The books are still very enjoyable. If you really want to catch everything, it's probably best done on a second read-through.  You might be aware there are 2 authors in this series. Erikson wrote the 10 main books, some side novellas, and is working on a prequel trilogy. Esslemont writes stand-alone books that fit into the main series timeline in different places. There are suggested reading orders all over this subreddit if you're interested in reading both authors (which I personally recommend, though they have slightly different writing styles).  Erikson's books can get quite philosophical at times. They're amazing, but paced a bit slower. Esslemont's books I find to be a bit faster paced, and lighter on the philosophy.  Enjoy!"
Malazan,38ttza,crossfire87,5,Sat Jun 6 19:56:40 2015 UTC,My recommendation don't read ICE until after Erikson. (the published order). Erikson wrote his books in the order they're meant to be read in.
Malazan,38ttza,Aiolus,3,Sat Jun 6 20:49:59 2015 UTC,Seconded.
Malazan,38ttza,Ftove,3,Sun Jun 7 03:56:20 2015 UTC,"You should follow along with the Tor rereads. They provide handy chapter summaries and insight from Amanda (who was reading the series for the first time) and Bill (who was rereading it). I'd stick to just Amanda's commentary since Bill sometimes slips in minor spoilers on accident. Apart from that, the preface gives you a pretty good idea of what you should expect.  As for whether you should read about the series before reading the series, I wouldn't. There are a lot of characters for sure, but finding spoiler-free info on them might prove very difficult.  http://www.tor.com/features/series/malazan-reread-of-the-fallen"
Malazan,38ttza,TRAIANVS,2,Sat Jun 6 19:50:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, don't go looking online for a summary of things. If you're confused, you're where you should be."
Malazan,38ttza,Nichase,2,Sat Jun 6 20:32:48 2015 UTC,"There will be many times when you're confused. DO NOT GOOGLE ANYTHING! You're supposed to be confused. The wiki is full of spoilers. Avoid it at all cost. If you do want some supplemental material then use the Tor.com re-read, but nothing else."
Malazan,38ttza,universal_straw,2,Sat Jun 6 21:18:46 2015 UTC,"Congrats on starting your grand adventure! Please ask any questions you like we'll keep it spoiler free. Don't go to the Wiki!   The dramatis personae and the glossary in the back of the book are your friends.  Think of it like this. You are an alien looking at Earth and you drop in the middle of the Roman Empire. You have no clue who these Romans are, why they have an empire, who their fighting, what their culture is, etc. You start hanging out with a soldier who tells you what's what, according to his point of view and experiences, then you go to the other side of the fight whomever the Romans are fighting to another soldier and experience the same thing from their point of view. That's how Malazan is. You learn things as the characters do and piece everything together. There are many ""Ah-HAH!"" moments as you connect the dots between plot lines.  There is a lot of introspective philosophy, you may find yourself skimming it at first but it is really wonderful reading if you take your time. Don't rush this. Savor it. This is not a speed reading kind of book, you have to pay attention, follow the clues on how things work like the magic system and what the big arcing plot of the entire series is, and put things together.  This is a wonderful series with a cast of hundreds. Every new continent you go to feels ancient, every new race you encounter has an history, every battle you partake in is bloody and brutal. Every story around the campfire will make you laugh at all the friends you'll make and it will make you cry all the harder when you lose some of them. Erikson is an archeologist and an anthropologist and it shows in his complex world building. Each book is 3/4 plot line and characters and the last quarter ups the craziness and epicness to 11 and you won't stop reading until you realize you've spent the entire night nose buried in this amazing world.  It is not for everybody. No series is.  No shame if this is the case, but at least read the second book and maybe even the third if you don't click with the first. The first book was written 9 years before the rest and it shows. By no means a bad book, but the inexperience shows a bit.  Enjoy!  The sheer scope and scale of what Erikson does across the entire series is astounding. It's crying into the books good. And they are even better on a reread. Stop by here and post your impressions as you go, we love first time impressions. Good luck!"
Malazan,38ttza,TriscuitCracker,2,Sat Jun 6 22:48:07 2015 UTC,you should know that you've made the best decision of your life by reading these books
Malazan,38ttza,letsbeaun,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:08:33 2015 UTC,"It's an awesome series. Depending on what you've read before and your expectations you may feel a little lost or that something wasn't fully explained. Feel free to ask in this sub.   In my opinion pretty much everything was understandable while also not being spoon fed to me.   For instance I watch GoT and the red witch/sorceress does magic with no explanation beyond that she worships the sun god and kings blood. There's more explanation in GotM about stuff but the scale is much much larger.   Not even sure if this makes sense. Hope it does. Read and enjoy the expansive world, characters, magic, lore, etc. Again feel free to ask us if you felt you missed something."
Malazan,38ttza,Aiolus,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:48:40 2015 UTC,"You will miss things.  It's the way the book is written.  It's okay.  Be calm.  My personal solution is to go back and read each book twice before moving to the next, and it's a pleasure to do so.  But if you don't have time for that, you can consult the summaries on TOR's ""Malazan Reread of the Fallen"".  For future reference, the link is on the sidebar.  Come back and tell us what you think when you are done."
Malazan,38rpiy,MohKohn,10,Sat Jun 6 06:09:42 2015 UTC,"A demon is just a generic name for some being from a Warren, never really a correct term, just one used by some people either out of ease or ignorance.  The power level of people of the main world seems so much weaker than beings of any other place because you get to see every kind of person on the main world, no matter how weak. You don't see the normal denizens of other world's usually. You see strong summoned people, or people strong enough to travel different realms."
Malazan,38rpiy,SageOfTheWise,4,Sat Jun 6 06:38:12 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. MT spoiler
Malazan,38rpiy,groovy_ash,7,Sat Jun 6 09:19:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, but you'd see the same sort of thing if someone were to summon a ""normal"" Toblakai, K'Chain, or Jaghut. There would be no point in summoning a human equivalent from that realm."
Malazan,38rpiy,TocTheEternal,4,Sat Jun 6 15:34:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's some selecting going on. No self-respecting summoner pulls from the planet of blind worms for his shock troops. All the demons we see were brought in specifically for ""power level""."
Malazan,38rpiy,AUae13,2,Sat Jun 6 17:35:23 2015 UTC,"As I understand it some warrens are easier to summon and bind from, such as aral gamelain, known as the warren of demonic summoning. As I can tell it is known as such simply because its the easiest to summon from, and therefore the most common. But at one point baruk summons a ""demon"" from tcgs realm."
Malazan,38qfxd,cockdragon,9,Fri Jun 5 23:16:17 2015 UTC,"I'll try to help out a bit. This is all my interpretation, and it's been a bit since I've last read Memories of Ice, so grain of salt, etc.  (1) It is abstract. He's taking the pain that makes the spirits of the dead unable to fully release the suffering of their lives. Without their suffering, they can move on. Also, the world that Itkovian ""seeded"" with the T'lan Imass memories was already in existence - it was created by K'rul, the Imass bonecaster, Kruppe, and possibly Silverfox as an eventual home for the Mhybe. Things got a little off track, and it then becomes a home for much more. Remember how surprised Silverfox was when she realized what was happening?  (2) This is a ""read and find out"" subject. It gets elaborated on, with the expected unreliable narrator twist, in later books.  (3) I'm not sure this is ever explained, but power is power, and why shouldn't beasts have their place in the pantheon? Also, many of these ascendants/gods are soletaken as well.  (4) Another read and find out subject. It becomes clearer, but still open to interpretation.  (5) Your interpretation is dead on. Both you and he learn more about what he is capable of as the series progresses.  (6) It's either a retcon, or the ubiquitous unreliable narrator showing up again. As we learn more of Tay, I'm more inclined to lean towards the latter.  (7) They are independent of each other. One is the convergence of the Soletaken seeking the first throne, and the second is the Crippled God poisoning the warrens with Chaos.   (8) It is super fucking metal, and too badass for words.   Most of it you had correct, and the parts you didn't will become clear in time. If you treat the series as if it were written by a historian piecing together disparate sources, it becomes a little easier to accept the occasional retcon or unexpected twist."
Malazan,38qfxd,Elandar,4,Fri Jun 5 23:58:15 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks a bunch! Super helpful.   It is abstract.   I can totally dig that. Yes, I do remember K'rul and company creating that realm, and I guess you just have to roll with it. ""Yeah, they collectively somehow talked to the Mhybe and resurrected like four different people inside one person...so why wouldn't the be able to create an entire world?"" lol. For now, I'm going to tell myself there are two different types of ""magic"" characters--those with rules, and those without rules. So Quick Ben, Kamist Reloe, Mallet, etc. can use magic by accessing warrens, but there's a specific set of rules that they have to follow. However, there are some characters that can use magic to do a lot more abstract shit.   Also, many of these ascendants/gods are soletaken as well   That's right--Trake is soletaken, right? Like eventually he just pulled a Marshawn Lynch and went full beast mode? Yes, I can totally see beasts having there place as gods, I just didn't totally get like how they can have an agenda. As with all things Malazan, I'm just gonna go with it."
Malazan,38qfxd,Elandar,4,Sat Jun 6 00:21:47 2015 UTC,"For now, I'm going to tell myself there are two different types of ""magic"" characters   There kind of are, and it becomes clearer later (I know, I could say this about most things in these books). Accessing warrens is one type of magic, but Elder sorcery (like the type used by Elder Gods like K'rul and flesh and blood Imass) tends to not play by those rules.   Also, why would gods need an agenda? A primal force is a primal force, logic has nothing to do with it. Bestial urges are a totally valid avenue for divine participation."
Malazan,38qfxd,Elandar,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:29:00 2015 UTC,"Gotcha.   Also, why would gods need an agenda?   I guess I just figured actions like selecting Gruntle as a mortal sword would require some kind of sentience and agenda, but I get what you're saying. I mean--this is fantasy after all ;)  So what's up with Raest? Is he basically just Paran's butler now in the Deus Ex Machina House? I would totally watch that sitcom."
Malazan,38qfxd,Aiolus,2,Sat Jun 6 01:46:16 2015 UTC,"Is he basically just Paran's butler now in the Deus Ex Machina House   Pretty much. As the series moves on you learn so much more about the Azath houses. The Malaz City Deadhouse guardian is my personal favorite, but the undead guardian you meet a continent away in a later book is the cutest."
Malazan,38qfxd,wjbc,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:53:50 2015 UTC,"As for the Mhybe they create that with the help of K'rul and the wolves. Not sure what rule they're ""breaking"" the wolves moved their throne there. It's also a RAFO sorta thing.   Also to chime in with the animals remember how people used to worship them. Trake at some point offers some insight (when we read about his past). Also a RAFO about how gods and ascendants interact with the world."
Malazan,38qfxd,xolotl92,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:36:57 2015 UTC,Even Quick Ben used Elder Magic when he transferred the soul of Hairlock to a puppet.  The Elder Magic has its own set of rules.

In Memories of Ice it is mostly the creation of Silverfox, although she draws on the memories of K'rul and Kruppe and the bonecaster in making it.  But then, yes, the memories of thousands of T'lan Imass turn it into something much bigger and beyond her control."
Malazan,38qfxd,Oathsend,2,Sat Jun 6 12:11:57 2015 UTC,"I'm only a little ahead of you, reading House of Chains for the second time.  However, MoI is still pretty fresh, and here are my thoughts based on what I know so far:   (1) What exactly does Itkovian's shield anvil pain absorption Dr. Phil ability do? It all just seems so abstract. I get that he ""dies for their sins"" and allows them to have an afterlife, but I'm just....not really sure what's happening? How do they just magically create a heaven for the I'mass? (I get that it's magic but can anyone do this?) What does putting all of their memories into the soil of their new heaven/land/place....do?   Itkovian took the memories and pain of the T'lan Imass.  But the T'lan Imass did not pass on to the afterlife, they decided they had one more mission to perform.  However, their memories were sent to ""fertilize"" Mhybe's dreamworld, to make it more real, now the product of many, many memories.  Mhybe was granted a permanent sleep so that she can live in her dreamworld as a young woman, live the life that was stolen from her, and which is no longer a nightmare to her.  (Keep in mind the world of Malazan is Burn's dreamworld, and she, too, sleeps.)     (2) Am I supposed to completely get what a warren and even a hold is? My current understanding of the warrens is that K'rul somehow created these magical ""realms"" that people can use to fast travel and access magic. Are these actual physical places? What about holds? What was there before K'rul?   I don't think we are supposed to completely understand these answers yet.  We've learned that the warrens are K'rul's bloodstreams.  They certainly seem physical when people go there, but again, keep in mind the world in which the Malazan Empire is located may be Burn's dreamworld, so what does ""physical"" mean?  Holds seem to be older than Warrens and Houses, perhaps older than K'rul, I don't know.   (3) I don't completely get the pantheon of gods/ascendants. Trake/Treach, Fenner, and Togg are all animals. How...can an animal become a god? Like do they become sentient upon ascendancy?   I don't completely get this either, but Trake/Treach is a soletaken, he spent millennia as a tiger, but he was not always a tiger, although I'm not sure what race he was when not a tiger.  Togg and his mate Fanderay seem to be true animals who somehow ascended, I'm not sure how.  I don't know Fener's backstory.   (4) Actually, this whole ""god vs. ascendant"" thing isn't completely clear. At first I thought gods were basically--well--gods, and ascendants were like angels or demi-gods--immortal, powerful beings, but not like actively worshiped or followed. But someone can become a god or an ascendant? Like some of the characters have been around for hundreds of thousands of years, but Kellenved magically ascended like a few years prior to the story starting?   It seems like ascending is the necessary prelude to becoming a god, but most ascendants do not become gods, some because they simply have no desire.  Trake/Treach ascended but did not become a god until something happened to Fener, leaving a place open for a new god.  But the fall of Fener shows that gods are still vulnerable.  Ascending seems to be a way of transcending death.  The gods, though, have worshipers and roles to play, as defined in the Deck of Dragons.   (5) I don't really get Paran's powers or role, but I'm not sure if it matters because it doesn't seem like he does either at this point _^ Basically, I'm thinking of all of these gods and ascendants as players in a game (or cards in a deck) and Paran is sort of the referee. He can't ultimately just decide who ""wins"" or is the most powerful, but he can monitor who's allowed in the ""game""?   That seems right to me, his full role has yet to be explored.  He seems to be a kind of referee, seemingly much less powerful than the gods, and yet placed in a position of power over them.  But the gods seem hopeful they can take advantage of him.  Yet he resists being used.   (6) So...Tayschrenn wasn't an evil jerk the whole time? Most of the plot of GotM just turned out to be a huge misunderstanding? I heard GotM was written almost a decade before the rest of the series. Was this like a retcon from Erikson?   I've never heard a definitive answer to this, but it seems like a retcon to me.  However, I also think it works because throughout the stories the narrators are unreliable.  So it's not entirely implausible that what we learned in GotM was wrong.   (7) There's a lot of ""poisoning of the warrens"", and I'm confused as if they're all independent of each other. In MOI, the warrens are poisoned by the crippled god, the DG it's because of the path of hands, and I remember this being an issue back in GotM as well. I guess a lot of my questions are just not understanding who has the ability to do what--like--there seem to be a lot of ways someone can just fuck with the warrens. Like they're getting doxxed or some shit.     In DG the problem was all the soletaken and d'ivers who were using warrens to seek the path of hands, converging on the holy desert Raraku, but it was a local phenomenon.  Similarly, the poisoning of the warrens on the continent of Genabackis was a local phenomenon associated with the Crippled God.  I believe they are independent of each other, although the Crippled God has his fingers in many places.  And yes, there are lots of ways to fuck with warrens, some are even destroyed or torn apart into fragments.   (8) Trake's legion can Voltron-merge into a giant fucking tiger? That's the most metal thing I've ever read.   Agreed.  It's like the opposite of a the d'ivers, if you think about it -- instead of one into many, it's many into one."
Malazan,38qfxd,wjbc,2,Sat Jun 6 00:52:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanations--this was a huge help.   Keep in mind the world of Malazan is Burn's dreamworld, and she, too, sleeps.   OK, that's something that confuses me as well. So the entire world (planet?) that these books take place in are all taking place inside Burn's dream, right? But when they say 1160th year of Burn's Sleep...like...that can't be right because there are tons of events that take place like hundreds of thousands of years ago, right? Help plz lol."
Malazan,38qfxd,Whales96,4,Sat Jun 6 01:41:43 2015 UTC,"Whether the Malazan world is literally ""dreamed up"" by Burn or if it's some kind of metaphorical thing hasn't been elaborated on yet. We might find out in the next two books of the Kharkanas trilogy. But yeah, Burn has definitely not been asleep for only 1160 years, since we know of events that have occurred hundreds of thousands of years back.  I believe Erikson explained it as ""1160 years ago there was some event that could've been interpreted as Burn 'waking up', such as a massive volcanic event, and afterwards she went back to sleep"""
Malazan,38qfxd,wjbc,2,Sat Jun 6 03:02:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, and I don't really know the explanation for that.  As I said, I'm not much farther than you in the series.  But they do imply that we are all part of Burn's dream, just as the Mhybe's world is part of her dream.  However, the Mhybe's world did not disappear when she woke up, and was there when she went back to sleep, so maybe it's the same with Burn, I don't know.  I do know they are very worried about anything happening to Burn, and not just because they sympathize with Burn, but because of the potential effect on the world."
Malazan,38qfxd,Whales96,2,Sat Jun 6 01:48:39 2015 UTC,Right on--gotcha.
Malazan,38qfxd,wjbc,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:49:48 2015 UTC,It's not a retcon because no events were changed.
Malazan,38qfxd,lighttsout86,3,Sat Jun 6 01:24:21 2015 UTC,"Only because of the unreliable narrators.  The events were changed, but the explanation was that they were ""misunderstood"" by the narrators in GotM.    It works because the narrators were unreliable.  But it sure looks retroactive in nature."
Malazan,38r6n4,mcgarmm,18,Sat Jun 6 02:57:52 2015 UTC,You think TWOW is going to come out next year? That's cute.
Malazan,38r6n4,Whales96,5,Sat Jun 6 05:40:11 2015 UTC,You think TWOW is going to come out? That's cute.    FTFY.
Malazan,38r6n4,wheeloficeandfire,4,Sat Jun 6 18:18:46 2015 UTC,"Take a break after Midnight Tides. If you get some free time or the urge to witness more, then read Night of Knives. It provides a nice change of pace and scenery and you get to see a few of those you might have only considered side characters till now.  Thats what I had decided on doing, though I was weak and now am reading RotCG after finishing Reapers Gale."
Malazan,38r6n4,nandanvora,3,Sat Jun 6 08:46:46 2015 UTC,"Probably after Midnight Tides then. Half way point of the series, and everything from after this is more of a long continues plot compared to the previous ones."
Malazan,38r6n4,SageOfTheWise,2,Sat Jun 6 06:07:14 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, after Midnight Tides would probably be the best place for a break. The plot lines that continue through the next five books really accelerate, so once you start Bonehunters, you probably won't want to stop."
Malazan,38n7t4,Kitad,15,Fri Jun 5 08:38:01 2015 UTC,When you know Tavore better...  They could have told her. They chose not to.  Weigh that cost against future events.

Malazan,38n7t4,SomeGuy1297,8,Thu Jun 11 06:06:56 2015 UTC,"The whole point is that the rebellion cannot hold it together, there are too many intrigues, and too many characters who have invited retribution from angry spirits by committing unforgivable acts.  Too much hot iron, not enough cold iron.  There are several hints that the convergence will bring retribution, and not necessarily from Tavore and her green, outnumbered, magic-poor infantry.  The rebellion is doomed by its own flaws, and Tavore just finishes it off.  I thought that ending was set up beautifully, and there was lots of action, it just went down the night before.  It's an exercise of misdirection, but there are plenty of hints it will end this way."
Malazan,38n7t4,wjbc,6,Fri Jun 5 10:20:09 2015 UTC,"Something you may have missed, as it's only implied. Tavore has visions, as her mother did. It's possible she knew a bit more than you give her credit for."
Malazan,38n7t4,Whales96,3,Fri Jun 5 08:46:37 2015 UTC,"Even if this was true, it's still pretty pointless since we don't see her character develop in any way. She starts as a cold practical women and ends exactly the same way."
Malazan,38n7t4,Whales96,4,Fri Jun 5 08:59:30 2015 UTC,"Well, Felisin mentions her mother and her visions, and Tavore doesn't have a single council where she discusses strategies with her generals. She also foresees that there will be allies that appear and instructs her own soldiers to not withhold directions to them, so I would say it's a pretty backed up theory. Though, I'm only on book 5 myself.   As far as character development goes, this is the first book where we really get a good look at Tavore. By the end of book 2, Felisin didn't really have much development of her own. Give Tavore some time.   Book 5 throws you right back in in the deep end, so maybe the break will be good for you? The only character in book 5 that's in the other books is Trull Sengar, the Tiste Edur that travels with Onrack."
Malazan,38n7t4,Whales96,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:09:15 2015 UTC,No Felisin development in book 2? Are you kidding?   She went from being a scared young daughter of house Paran to being a nihilistic bitch to being the leader of the apocalypse.  She was the most developed character of book 2.
Malazan,38n7t4,TheHopelessGamer,3,Fri Jun 5 09:16:09 2015 UTC,I'm not sure nihilistic is the correct words. The goddess wouldn't have cared if Felisin wasn't filled to the brim with vengeance. She was planning to kill her sister from the first pov.
Malazan,38n7t4,wjbc,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:17:51 2015 UTC,"Keep reading. It'll be a bit before you get back to her, but you will get more. Much more."
Malazan,38n7t4,Whales96,2,Fri Jun 5 22:55:25 2015 UTC,"Where is this implied in HoC?  This feels like a spoiler from a future book.  Maybe when the child mages tell her she's ""right""?  But in HoC, we never find out why they said that."
Malazan,38n7t4,wjbc,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:42:07 2015 UTC,Well Felisin has some inner dialogue about how her mother had visions and that she didn't have them herself. Tavore doesn't have a single war council where she passes on information about their tactics. The most compelling evidence I would say is that Tavore foresaw reinforcements coming to help them and told her soldiers to make sure they have directions etc. Tavore never left the camp or had contact with any sort of person that could convey messages to other groups or anything. Especially with the nature of the reinforcements(ghosts).
Malazan,38n7t4,Whales96,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:56:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, but how she gained that knowledge is very much hidden, except for that one hint from the mages who say she was right about something.  I had no clue she had visions until I read this spoilery thread.  That's okay, it's not a huge spoiler."
Malazan,38n7t4,wjbc,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:04:33 2015 UTC,I thought it was pretty plain. Felisin mentions the visions right before the ghosts show up.

But even if I had, I'm not sure I would have made the connection between Felisin talking about her mother and secret visions of Tavore, her sister.  There's enough in there that it becomes obvious in hindsight, but it wasn't obvious to me on my first reading."
Malazan,38n7t4,wjbc,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:16:18 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not like I got any information from a future book. I just started book 5."

Malazan,38n7t4,wjbc,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:19:55 2015 UTC,"When i read it i was very intrigued that basically tells the reader how it's going to end, and you continue to read dismissing the obvious signs and going for the little ones. And at the end you get surprised by the obvious thing. But i will give you this minor spoiler"
Malazan,38n7t4,Boneyabba,2,Fri Jun 5 14:18:07 2015 UTC,"I want to emphasize that I am not annoyed by what happened, but rather how underutilized what happened was for pushing the characters forward.  I actually liked the night before the duel, and how it all came crumbling down. That was cool. But I would have liked for the Tavore-Shaik encounter to be more meaningful for either character. Even if Tavore ended up not knowing, maybe she could have undergone some changes or emotional moments of some sort. As for Felisin, we didn't see her for many pages and then we only had a brief segment closing her arc.  Again, maybe there is more to this in future books. But I think that characters from a novel should have some sort of arc throughout it, and for me the most important characters were these two and their arc left me cold feeted."
Malazan,38n7t4,SleepyRebel,2,Fri Jun 5 14:41:04 2015 UTC,"I wish people would refrain from spoilers, however minor.  I haven't read past HoC, and I thought this thread was safe, but I'm getting all kinds of hints of things to come.  I know they are just hints, but still, at least use a spoiler tag.  Edit: Thanks."
Malazan,38n7t4,HighCrawler,-1,Fri Jun 5 15:53:38 2015 UTC,Let me give you some advice friend.  If this sort of thing bothers you...  DO NOT READ GAME OF THRONES.
Malazan,38n7t4,Boneyabba,2,Fri Jun 5 09:40:05 2015 UTC,"on the contrary (HEAVY ASOIAF SPOILERS AHEAD)  I want to emphasize that its not the fact that Felisin died that bothred me, its the fact that the characterization and the arcs felt incomplete and disappointing  In ASOIAF a lot of main characters die but there is always a point to their deaths...  [spoiler] Ned dies because he is too honorable for his own good, some say that most of his actions came from wanting to avoid child slaughter (even Cersei's children)  Oberyn dies because he is too hellbent on revenge. His crime is one of arrogance.  And so on [/spoiler]  So you see, even though characters die, every death comes as a consequences of a series of choices, is in line with the character arc and pushes the story and the character forward.  Maybe Felisin's arc and legacy have a greater pay-off down the road (they hinted at that) but as it was I didn't get much out of it in the end of this book.  You gotta understand that I was waiting for the two sisters to confront for a long time now."
Malazan,38n7t4,HighCrawler,14,Fri Jun 5 09:47:19 2015 UTC,"Maybe its personal preference, but that's one of the reasons I like this series so much more than GoT, the deaths always have to mean something there. Sometimes in this series people just die, or coincidences that seem to be built towards just don't happen. It's unpredictable and a lot more believable to me."
Malazan,38nsqm,SageOfTheWise,13,Fri Jun 5 12:26:27 2015 UTC,"He's a character with a history though. He was a Letherii child that was kidnapped and raised by the Awl (as was the style at the time). Some events lead to his exile (I forget what it was now), and he went off into the Awl'dan. The reason he was so aggressively against the Letherii is because he had to spend his whole life living with the 'shame' of being Letherii and not true Awl among his people. This is why he wears the mask, to hide his heritage. He only comes back to the Awl after enough time and after enough of them have been decimated that no one remembers he is Letherii, and he can finally basically live out his dream. The only one who still remembers his origins is that one elder, which is why Redmask kills him.  That all kind of precludes him from being Hull."
Malazan,38nsqm,Lord_Rob,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:47:00 2015 UTC,"I totally missed that part. Ok, it doesn't appear that Redmask has any connection to Hull except for somewhat similar motives."
Malazan,38nsqm,TocTheEternal,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:51:11 2015 UTC,Regarding the mask
Malazan,38nsqm,future_forward,11,Fri Jun 5 23:38:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think that there is any basis for this. To start, there is literally no indication that Redmask is Hull, no hints about appearance, his true past, having any brothers, any unknown motivations or associations. Nothing. Not a shred. Just that he's Letherii. Additionally, there is literally no reason to believe that Hull has come back. There is no mechanism ever brought up that would have done such a thing, nor any mention of a character with the motivation to do so. Or even the tiniest hint that anyone so much as contemplated the idea. And finally, Redmask doesn't act anything like Hull. Redmask is a total dick, has gained unbelievable mastery over two extremely rare and unique weapons, instigates war by personally engaging in an unprovoked attack and somehow spent a bunch of time out in the east getting the K'Chain to follow him. And he keeps period faces for some reason.  None of this makes any sense at all with Hull's character.   So no, I don't think this theory holds any water at all. At best it is completely speculative, more likely it just doesn't make sense."
Malazan,38nsqm,TocTheEternal,2,Fri Jun 5 12:48:47 2015 UTC,Of course someone named Toc would say that...
Malazan,38nsqm,future_forward,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:52:47 2015 UTC,"To be fair, if it was supposed to be a revelation, SE would intentionally have avoided any of the info that we know about Hull. But I'm with you, I doubt that this is a thing. I think it was simply a final twist for a (not-so-interesting) character."
Malazan,38nsqm,HighCrawler,2,Fri Jun 5 14:29:22 2015 UTC,"I dunno, the most obfuscation that Erikson usually does is simply not name a character that is showing up several books after they vanished/died and letting you piece it together from context, description, and actions.  Like Iskar Jarak, Artanthos, Traveler, or any number of somewhat minor characters. Most of them are eventually explicitly revealed as well."

Malazan,38jkut,TriscuitCracker,8,Thu Jun 4 22:46:55 2015 UTC,"In Gardens of the Moon, he was revealed to be ""the Eel"", with several agents in his employ such as Circle Breaker. It's just a sinister sounding name he uses when doing deals under the table, so nobody in Darujhistan knows Kruppe is secretly running the show. It's understandable you didn't remember, I don't think I picked up on it right away."
Malazan,38jkut,Joomes,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:35:39 2015 UTC,"I did remember - but for whatever reason I thought it was something more like being ""the warlord"" or ""the king"" of a high house.  It never even occurred to me that they were simply saying he was ""slippery like an eel""...  possibly because when ""the Eel"" is referred to in ToH it's capitalized."
Malazan,38jkut,The_Voice_Of_Ricin,0,Thu Jun 4 18:03:47 2015 UTC,"they were simply saying he was ""slippery like an eel""   I mean, they're not.

Malazan,38jkut,The_Voice_Of_Ricin,4,Thu Jun 4 19:28:11 2015 UTC,"It's not a title/position in the Deck of Dragons, if that's what you're asking.  It's merely a ""codename"" he uses.  People ""in the know"" know of the Eel's existence, and that he's a major player behind the scenes in Darujistan, but ""The Eel"" doesn't fall under a particular house's hierarchy.  At least as far as I recall, I could have missed something."

Malazan,38jkut,Joomes,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:58:30 2015 UTC,"Yes. My point is, ""The Eel"" is a title in the sense of a moniker or alias, but not a position in the pantheon (such as ""Knight of Shadow,"" or ""Herald of Death"")"
Malazan,38jkut,Giotto,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:30:36 2015 UTC,Agreed :)
Malazan,38jkut,Lord_Rob,2,Fri Jun 5 15:37:52 2015 UTC,"Kruppe is the only Eel. I think you've misunderstood the use of the word 'title'.   While a 'title' can refer to a heritable or repeatable position, it doesn't need to. Eddie ""The Eagle"" Edwards' 'title' is ""The Eagle"", but he is also the only person referred to as ""The Eagle"" in the context of ski-jumping."
Malazan,38jkut,0haymai,3,Thu Jun 4 20:45:36 2015 UTC,I think your first response was misleading - a title is something more specific in the context of Malazan.
Malazan,38jkut,Teddyholden,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:53:36 2015 UTC,"It is a title, but it has nothing to do with any houses, or relating to any other authority.   Its basically a self-assigned codename. If it helps you understand, think of it like the names of the Malazan soldiers - they have names that reflect their qualities.   Kruppe - completely separately from the Malazans, just to avoid any additional confusion - has built a name for himself under the identity of the Eel because he's slippery, difficult to catch, and can worm his way into and out of any situation he wants to."
Malazan,38jkut,wjbc,3,Thu Jun 4 23:08:06 2015 UTC,"I always thought of it as his title. In GotM, people refer to a mysterious someone simply known as 'The Eel' who runs an underground network of spies/thieves/etc. For example, Crokus Younghand considered himself a student of Kruppe (although he didn't realize how infamous Kruppe was at the time).  So in a way, it is a title like 'The Warlord'. By asking what is an Eel, it's like saying what is a warlord. In this situation, and Eel is someone who is sneaky and shadowy, kinda like the animal. Although as a title, The Eel is less generic then warlord. There are many warlords, but only one Eel."

Malazan,38hqfg,Montaron87,4,Thu Jun 4 09:59:28 2015 UTC,"There are a handful of important events that occur in RotCG. I'd suggest trying to find a summary (the Tor reread of it, maybe) and trying again with Stonewielder which I found to be much better written.  Off the top of my head, here are a couple of somewhat relevant events for SE's series:  Laseen is killed. There was one more stalker than she was prepared for, and she is simply assassinated in a fairly straightforward manner. Mallick Rel (the Just...) is left in charge. It should be noted that even though he is probably even more of a racist, treacherous, ruthless scumbag that he appears in the main series, he definitely shows that he is more than a petty manipulator or opportunist. It is very likely that he will be a more effective ruler than Laseen.  You see more about Traveler/Dassem between when he acquires the sword Vengeance/Grief and when you see him again in TTH (no spoiler, but he is a fairly important character in that book). In particular, you see that he has physically ascended well beyond mortal. At one point he was stuck on the Stormwall in Korel and was their Champion (the premier enslaved warrior that they use to defend from the Stormriders) until he was rescued by the previous Champion. Another interesting fact is that throughout the early Malazan conquests, the only Guardsman and honestly the only Champion (not a Korelri Champion, this time I'm referring to any nation's premeir warrior) that was ever able to match Dassem was Skinner.  There is a rematch at the end of RotCG, and even though Skinner has since acquired apparently indestructible armor, this time Dassem is easily able to take him down (though he survives). Kallor also pops up (fairly randomly) and Dassem ends up driving him off with a should-be mortal wound but the Crippled God intervenes and saves him.  If you are interested in maybe trying some of ICE's future books, I can list a couple more points that pertain to them. His books mostly have their own continuity (except OST, which mostly just follows TTH) but RotCG is mostly relevant regarding changes to the Empire rather than specific plot points that come up later in the main series so I decided not to list them."
Malazan,38hqfg,TocTheEternal,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:44:51 2015 UTC,"That's super helpful, thanks. Gah--now I don't know what to do. I will probably leave RotCG and just rely on Tor rereads. Really anxious to crack on with TtH. I hear good things about OST, so I might try ICE later on then.   By the way, I heard Tayschrenn pops up a couple of times in RotCG. Not so important?"
Malazan,38hqfg,TocTheEternal,3,Thu Jun 4 15:54:10 2015 UTC,"He does, and he's actually really important for ICE's later stuff and the grander scheme the world. But what he does is mostly irrelevant for SE's books so I left it out.  Initially you see him basically in a state of ennui, where he has sequestered himself away from the world because he is reaching a sort of Gothos-like prescience and he is realizing that the more powerful and aware he becomes, the more powerless he feels and the more predetermined the universe seems.  It is also shown that Cowl (the Guard's High Mage and Master Assassin) was a major rival of his (as well as of Topper, and Dancer, Cowl's quite a guy) but is a bit smaller minded and Tayschrenn is now dismissive of him.    So basically there is a 3 way civil war going on with a bunch of mages and stuff but Tayschrenn sits out like a grumpy grandfather until all the kids start breaking shit and nearly end the world. He jumps in like some sort of near deity to sort things out, but just before he finishes closing the Rift of Doom that some idiot mage created, he is knocked into it and winds up in Chaos, status unknown."

Oh god I really wish you would just read it all, RotCG is one of my favourites of all the books not just amongst the ICE novels, I know it starts pretty slow and it's really long but to me it's the only ICE book that can stand alongside the Erikson books and feels like a true malazan novel"

To echo the guy's words: sounds like an invitation to mediocrity :)  More seriously though, while I know what you mean about ICE being more straightforward, there are some points when I'm much more lost with respect to what ICE is writing about than what SE is writing about. In some ways, I find ICE more difficult to follow than SE."
Malazan,38gq67,mhardegree,16,Thu Jun 4 02:29:42 2015 UTC,Just keep reading. Things start to clear up. You're one book and two chapters into a ten-book behemoth of a series; you can't expect to have all the answers just yet. Enjoy the ride :)

Malazan,38gq67,ohpuic,3,Thu Jun 4 10:00:04 2015 UTC,"I did Gardens of the Moon, Night of Knives, and Deadhouse Gates with tor reread. About a little over half way through Deadhouse I started noticing I was picking up most of the things Amanda was getting.  Now I'm in Memories of Ice and I'm at the point where I don't feel like I need the tor reread at all. So it really does get easier as you pick up more of the history of the Malazan world.   Never have I started a series of books and wanted to finish it just so I can start over right away as much as I do for Malazan."
Malazan,38gq67,ohpuic,3,Thu Jun 4 15:40:20 2015 UTC,I noticed that they read Night Of Knives before Deadhouse Gates on the reread.  Is that one that I need to go ahead and read as well?
Malazan,38gq67,ohpuic,2,Thu Jun 4 17:21:14 2015 UTC,"Night of knives takes place after the prologue of Gardens but before it's first chapter. So I read it after Gardens.  It's pretty fast paced, and unlike Erikson, Esselmont tends to explain a lot of stuff. You aren't going to be missing a lot of stuff by not reading it, but you may spoil some minor things.  Over all I liked it, since to me it felt more like am action movie where everything moved very fast (whole book takes place in one night).  It also gave multi dimensionality to at least one person who seemed comically evil and inept before I read Night of Knives.   If you're reading Deadhouse though, keep reading that because once DG takes off, it is a very hard novel to put down. Maybe read Night after DG then."
Malazan,38gq67,Fnarley,2,Thu Jun 4 19:21:08 2015 UTC,"Have you read the rest of Esselmont's books?  If so when is the best time to do those?  Im thinking I may just read all of Erikson's and then go back to Esselmont's, unless it is more rewarding to read them together."

Malazan,38gq67,The_Voice_Of_Ricin,2,Thu Jun 4 07:26:11 2015 UTC,"I recommend reading it twice.  The first time, don't worry if you are lost.  It will all (well, almost all) become clear the second time.  And it's an amazing feeling when it does.  Alternatively, I agree that TOR's ""Malazan Reread of the Fallen"" will help clear things up.

Malazan,38bpxk,terker,7,Wed Jun 3 04:39:59 2015 UTC,"Most of us feel this way, I hated Karsa at the beginning but loved him at the end. Kind of how I felt about the book Midnight Tides. You'll see what I mean. He's a great character! Did you enjoy figuring out the connections to DG?"
Malazan,38bpxk,TriscuitCracker,5,Wed Jun 3 04:55:52 2015 UTC,"Karsa did some terrible, awful things.  Rape, slaughter, brutal treatment of the slavemaster Silgar (I know, if anyone deserved it, Silgar did, but still...).    Karsa changed over the course of the story; at times he was humbled, although more often he humbled others.  He's a brutal man in a brutal world, but he can be surprisingly thoughtful and imaginative, and he still has a sense of outrage that many lack.  He shocks others, but he can also be shocked, he has a sense of justice and injustice (just not the one we associate with civilized society).    He reminds me of the Malazan Empire itself; scary and ruthless, but perhaps better than chaos.  Maybe that's why Karsa declares a truce with the Empire, for the time being.    However, I don't know whether Karsa wants to emulate the Empire or create something different.  Coltaine at first rebelled against the Empire, and then joined it.  Rake at first fought the Empire, and then allied with it.  What will Karsa do?  Can he and the Empire find a way to coexist?  Can he do so without accepting civilization?  I can't wait to find out."
Malazan,38bpxk,wjbc,3,Wed Jun 3 17:12:44 2015 UTC,This is a neat read about Karsa.

It's really interesting to hear him explain what he was trying to do with a rather divisive character. Personally, I think he nailed it."
Malazan,38bpxk,Elandar,2,Wed Jun 3 11:29:26 2015 UTC,"This statement by Erikson caught my eye:   In fact, probably the boldest claim to escapist fantasy my series makes, is in offering up a world where we all have power, no matter our station, no matter our flaws and weaknesses – we all have power.   This is a fascinating statement.  The mirror of this statement is that mortals can challenge gods and immortals and win, or at least fight them to a draw, and I think we see many examples of just that in the series.    Karsa destroys one of his gods, and banishes the rest, and it looks like he plans to do the same to the Crippled God.  We can call Karsa's gods false gods who take advantage of an ignorant tribe, but are any of the other gods really that much different?    However, there's another question raised by many of the mortals who find themselves raised to power by such battles -- is it worth it?  Or would it have been better to remain anonymous?  Some of the smartest characters treasure their anonymity, and fight hard to retain it, even after they become powerful."

It is as if an alien had come to earth after humans died out and came across books talking about ww2. They would have little to no context about where these places are the books speak of, who is this axis, who are the allies, what are all these different nations and great leaders spoken of, what had happened before the events within those books (though there may be some allusions and references to peoples and events long past), what is are these tanks they speak of, what is a blitzkrieg, and on ad nauseum.  So you are this alien historian reading these texts, a collection of various accounts to pivotal events dubbed convergences. Most accounts have little knowledge about events and things outside their lives, some are much more knowledgeable, and so you as the historian are seeking to pick out whatever you might call the truth and bear witness to the events, lives, hopes, fears, dreams of those long, lost, forgotten, and unwitnessed lives with naught bet a small set of texts to commemorate the victories and defeats endured by the fallen."

Malazan,38b7xw,NickofSantaCruz,3,Wed Jun 3 19:35:03 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the next 10 books.  IIRC, Erikson wrote a foreword for the first book (may well not be there on certain editions) where he explains that his writing style is very lacking in exposition.   You are dumped in a world with things going on, with people who know what those things are. They're too busy with the important things going on to explain to you what's going on, so you're just along for the ride, and have to piece things together of your own accord from things you see, conversations you overhear, and from meetings you see taking place.   He also warns you that this style is definitely not everyone's cup of tea, and it doesn't get better throughout the series, so bail if you're not into it by the end of the first book. Personally though, while it took me a while to get accustomed to the different style of storytelling, I found it to be much more organic, and it was more rewarding to make links myself rather than being spoonfed them.   Basically, what I'm saying is, relax, its normal. You'll pick things up as you go :)"

Malazan,38b7xw,CapytannHook,0,Wed Jun 3 11:32:16 2015 UTC,"My personal solution is to read every book twice.  That's pretty extreme, but I find it a pleasure.  It's even more of an issue with the first book, though, since you are diving right in with no prior explanation.  Many things that are confusing now will be explained in later books.  But you are guaranteed to miss a lot if you don't read it twice.  If you really want help figuring out what's going on without re-reading or encountering spoilers, I recommend TOR's ""Malazan Reread of the Fallen.""  The link is in the sidebar and also here.  You can read the summaries and the comments by Amanda, who was reading the book for the first time.  You can also read the comments of Bill, who was re-reading the books, but there are hints of what is to come in those comments, so if you want to be totally spoiler free, stop with Amanda's commentary."

Malazan,389v4q,We_Fight_inthe_Shade,15,Tue Jun 2 20:52:19 2015 UTC,"Malazan is way overpowered world compared to most other fantasy realms, based on the descriptions of warren magic and feats of the top fighters.  The Imass already are already armed with stone swords (no steel to shatter), and would probably work out obsidian cuts up White Walkers fairly quickly. We know the top Imass swordsmen like Tool have incredible speed, are able to fight multiple opponents simultaneously, and can take quite a beating, effectively requiring their skulls to be smashed before they quit. And as they are already undead, the White Walkers won't be able to reanimate them into wights. Additionally T'lan Bonecasters are already very adept at fighting cold magic; overall I see the Imass stomping the White Walkers every time."
Malazan,389v4q,MasterPatricko,3,Tue Jun 2 21:30:57 2015 UTC,"To play Walker's advocate, the current strength of the WW horde is three-to-fourfold (or more, it's got to be nearing 50-75 thousand atm) the amount of Imass remaining. Further, it is winter and using Tellann would be a lot more difficult. Entire Imass armies were decimated by Jaghuts using Omtose Phellack.    Just to give you a counter-argument."
Malazan,389v4q,Anomander,10,Tue Jun 2 21:48:06 2015 UTC,"I know you're in a fan sub and we're all gonna be biased as tits, but GoT and Malazan are written on very fundamentally different notions of power scaling.    GoT's core themes are the humanity of its heroes, that they're mundane and vulnerable and full of faults in spite of their status, GRRM very deliberately attacks tropes like Plot Armor and reader expected outcomes.  MBotF is almost the reverse, focusing instead on the exceptional or even superhuman feats characters sold as ""normal"" are capable of.  They're both relatively similar at the surface, each has protagonists that are exceptionally plot-fragile and still capable of exceptional feats in between.    But MBotF is OP as fuck.    We're very early presented the notion that the T'lan Imass are substantially more powerful than conventional armies, and nearly indestructible to boot.  The notion that Kellevaned's command of the T'lan secured him the Malazan Empire's place in history, and Laseen's failure to have similar hold on the undead legion is a large part of why she's gradually losing control of the empire of the span of the series.    Numbers are pretty much irrelevant - at least in MBotF lore, we're consistently shown that numbers are irrelevant if a character or concept is strong enough.  Think the Seguleh, whose low-ranking members alone are cast as equivalent to ten or twenty ""normal"" soldiers.  The Imass are presented as universally equivalent or better, except at the highest ranks of Seguleh society.    A 4:1 Walker to Imass ratio is certainly not a substantial numerical advantage by MBotF standards.  I would almost go so far as to say that it remains a fairly trivial advantage, if it is one.    The walkers are portrayed as having superhuman strength, and some measure of supernatural resistance to harm, both innate durability and whatever their funky black armor is. They command some measure of sorcery, both the storms and chill they conjure as well as their capacity to assimilate humans and raise the dead.  But in spite of how threatening those things are to ""mere mortals"" if you will, they're really not much to the imass.  Walkers don't need to be fought with obsidian (""dragon glass"") or Valyrian steel, it just helps.  Imass weapons are largely knapped stone, so not subject to the vulnerabilities of traditional steel, and are already sold as sorcerously durable far beyond what normal stone could withstand.  That some might be obsidian and the Walkers' vulnerability could be discovered accidentally is much more probable than one of the more conventionally armed Malaz nations.  Simply diassembling a walker is enough, at least in the short term - and once the clash ended, the imass are capable of gathering up the pieces and just setting them on fire.   The Imass, individually, are the far greater threat.  Also undead - and bound to their mission in undeath via the collective will and power of a society of millions' simultaenous sacrifice to the cause.  No matter what hold over the dead the walkers have, I don't think it would apply to the Imass.  Each ""warrior"" imass has had centuries of practice and combat experience to hone their craft - they didn't die and hide, they died to better continue their war against the Jaghut.  The only times legions have rested was when they ran out of Jaghut.  They have strength not based on flesh or muscle, but instead the same power that keeps them ""alive"" and that far exceeds most mortals both in raw strength and in speed.  They aren't bound to bone, per se, or even a truly corporeal form - they can become dust at will and reform similarly.  They use this for transportation, but suffice to say it would be nearly impossible to ""trap"" Imass in a disadvantageous clash; they'd just be dust and take off - coming back when things more favour them.  This is something they've used against the Jaghut over centuries of war, so a little Walker Winter isn't going to pose an issue.  It's strongly implied they're not truly bound to stay physical during combat, and could if needed swap back and forth rapidly to gain an edge - outside of them being a 1:1 outmatch, they've enough on-the-spot and force projection mobility that larger conflicts would almost exclusively take place under conditions already advantageous to the Imass.  The cold, the winter ... the entire species is used to that, and took the Ritual of Tellann to combat Jaghut powers specifically; resultantly they're nearly immune to the more immediate dangers of Walker Winter - the freezing and the cold - and can only actually die by becoming dust and mixing with water; otherwise even disassembled they retain sentience.  The entire body needs to be destroyed enough to not be possible to repair or reassemble, but even that won't necessarily kill them.  They communicate telepathically - not quite a hive mind, but certainly all linked via Tellann and not subject to having coms lines cut - nor supply lines.  Their few bonecasters throw Tellann, the warren of ""fire in darkness, heat in the cold"" ... it might be affected by Walker Winter, but mostly its aspect is exactly what Imass would need - immediate and close protection from environmental or creeping cold, and the heat to crack through  - not break the winter iteself, but simply incinerate the Jaghut causing it.    You bring up their losses against the Jaghut as a possible parallel, but I think in comparing the Jaghut to the Walkers, you're doing the Jaghut species a serious disservice.  Even taken as a whole host, the Walkers just ain't on the same level.  Quite simply, a single average Jaghut is given to us as powerful enough to conjure a glacier, to freeze a (Wu-scale) continent solid - something that the entire Walker host is obviously incapable of doing at will.  I mean, the whole reason they're hosting a war is because they want to freeze the world and can't just do that at whim.  Jaghut magic is the slowing, stopping, or stasis nature of absolute cold to defend and secure vast spaces around themselves - to contrast, Walkers are more the slow creeping harm of chill: gradual, implacable, a death of starvation, fatigue, and hypothermia where Jaghut are simply a quick blast of absolute zero.  Jaghut sorcery is responsible for entirely halting the development of Warrens on Lether ... as an unintended side-effect; Raest, the Tyrant raised in Gardens, is billed as being a threat to all players, collectively, participating in the convergence at Seven Cities.  In spite of how goddamned scary everyone participating in that conflict, one dead and sleepy Jaghut tyrant is posed as a threat to the entire group, and an average Jaghut is already written as substantially more powerful than the entire White Walker host is.    Like Patricko said above; Malazan is just OP as hell and written that way, so taking lore at face value pretty much anything plot important is simply going to outscale almost any other series of lore set.  While GoT is deliberately understated and unclear."
Malazan,389v4q,Whales96,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:05:01 2015 UTC,All this and you didn't even mention that all the bonecasters are soletaken.

And in the case of Imass, especially the bonecasters, I'm not sure that being able to transform into an undead bear is really that massive or even meaninful an advantage when you already have the Walkers outmatched just by staying Imass and shooting lots of fire.  AFIK no non-Eleint soletaken can channel magic while veered?"
Malazan,389v4q,Whales96,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:32:13 2015 UTC,"Well, one of the bone casters is a soletaken dragon. Onrack states in HoC that all the bonecasters are soletaken. Even Tattersail is mentioned to be a soletaken in the first book she's revealed."
Malazan,389v4q,Anomander,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:58:02 2015 UTC,"Olar Ethil is the only Eleint soletaken amongst the Imass, and her loyalties are pretty questionable throughout; whether or not she'd align herself with the Imass I don't think can be counted on.  Without going crazy spoilers, she doesn't consider herself ""full Imass"" and she's definitely one of the Elder Players - running her own game not always in the interests of ""her"" people.    Most the rest veer to apex predators or apex omnivores like wolves and bears."
Malazan,389v4q,PromisedPrince694,7,Fri Jun 5 20:35:13 2015 UTC,"Entire Imass armies were decimated by Jaghuts using Omtose Phellack.   Which is why they used the ritual of Tellann, which made them stronger vs ice."
Malazan,389v4q,smpm,8,Wed Jun 3 15:42:14 2015 UTC,"The T'lan Imass are a formalized army that have fought for over 300,000 years. There are hundreds of thousands of them. They fly around as dust, appear, wreck your shit and fly away. Tellann, is a warren of fire and there seem to be a lot of Bonecasters (around 20 are known) where the WW's seem to only have 1 mage, the Night King. Magic aside though, they would dominate the zombie horde."
Malazan,389v4q,universal_straw,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:59:55 2015 UTC,"Again, to play Walker's advocate, the Walkers have been around since Westeros existed: this may not be 300,000 years, but it is quite a long time. Further, as grimly foretold in the latest episode, not only do they have the wights, but they have ice spiders as big as hounds.  In this case, all of the White Walkers have some access to Omtose Phellack , as their presence is heralded by freezing temperatures. They also have supernatural strength, something not attributed to the Imass.  And White Wakers could not be killed by the stone weapons of the Imass, unlike the wights or spiders. Everyone is assuming that the Imass would simply know or figure out automatically that obsidian or, to be fair, otataral, would destory the White Walkers. Perhaps Telann would also do the trick, but I don't think it would be the cake walk everyone is assuming it would be.  Edit: And I'm not sure where you got the numbers for them...hundreds of thousands? After the wars with the Jaghuts, and reading The Crippled God it does not seem that there are nearly that many. At best, after the Diaspora, I'd place the remaining armies of the Imass at around 30,000-50,000. Which is outnumbered by the current armies of the Walkers, which I'd place at 50,000-90,000.   Don't get me wrong; Malazan is my favorite fantasy series of all time. Objectively it might be a fracas, and it would be awesome to see it. And if Olar Ethil is included in the fight, the Imass win, hands down, no questions."
Malazan,389v4q,TwoColdOne,6,Wed Jun 3 03:58:01 2015 UTC,"I think you're referencing the wights from GoT. The White Walkers are the masters and the wights are the reanimated corpses. The T'Lan Imass would wreck the wights. The Walkers might be a different story though. If the Imass count as dead then the Walkers would have control over them. If not the Imass would win through sheer numbers. A cage match would be up in the air. Both are ancient, sentient, and skilled fighters so it's hard to say. My bet would be on the Imass though."
Malazan,389v4q,TwoColdOne,3,Tue Jun 2 22:48:40 2015 UTC,"Oh, I understand the difference. Just like not all Imass are the First Sword, or a Bonecaster. So comparing all Imass to Tool or Kilava would be like comparing all wights to the Seven of the Dead Fires, or all Imass to the Night's King. I've read both series numerous times.  I appreciate your input, the match contains ALL of the undead hordes, not just the foot soldiers.  Edit: so the WW could reanimate/control the Imass? Not something I'd considered, and an almost insurmountable advantage if true."
Malazan,389v4q,MasterPatricko,6,Tue Jun 2 23:30:18 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that all T'lan Imass are skilled fighters. They conducted the ritual to pursue a genocidal war, and have been doing so for 300,000 years. In their T'lan state - there are no other needs.  No food, no water, no craft, no culture. There are no peasants among the T'lan Imass. They exist to fight.    While there are some peaks of skill/power among individuals such as  Onos and Kilava - the implied prowess of any T'lan is very high."
Malazan,389v4q,Quakercorn,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:12:39 2015 UTC,"Everything you stated about the Imass could be paralleled with the Walkers/wights. They exist to destroy humanity. They need no sustenance, their only purpose is warfare.    And saying there is no peasants among the Imass is disingenuous. An entire race underwent the Ritual of Tellann: how did they subsist before that? There were no farmers or hunters among them? How did they feed themselves? Not every Imass is a killing machine like Tool or Onos.   Edit: Again, I'm not including Olar Ethil. If she is fighting for the Imass, they win."
Malazan,389v4q,SageOfTheWise,6,Wed Jun 3 04:39:27 2015 UTC,"The extant Imass lives were short: comparable to humans.  The hundreds of generations they have spent in their T'lan form supersedes any previous occupation.  They are stoic and calculated in their disposition - and wholly martial in their new culture.    To compare: while the Walkers may have a devised motive - the mass of their power lies in the Wights; which act and exist more like zombies than any thinking animal.  They lack martial prowess, organisation, tactics, or proper armament.    The parallel is lacking. On one hand an immortal warrior society - on the other a horde of vicious and mindless minions.    Just for interests I would wager the Tenescowri would stand a fair chance against an equal force of Wights!"
Malazan,389v4q,SageOfTheWise,4,Wed Jun 3 13:40:54 2015 UTC,"The Imass were still a hunter-gatherer society, not agricultural, before the ritual, and had already been fighting the Jaghut for generations -- I think this explains why we never see an Imass farmer or potter, and every Imass is a skilled fighter."

There isn't much else to add on what you said. Fear and Trull are with Rulad at throne room. They leave when he starts weeping and they all end up looking for Seren to help them escape Lether.
Malazan,389ijt,SageOfTheWise,2,Tue Jun 2 20:30:17 2015 UTC,"Ok to back up slightly, you actually know a bit more about Wither at this point than I thought you did. He is 'Killanthir, Third High Mage of the Sixth Cohort', one of the mages in Silchas Ruin's army that was betrayed and killed by the Edur all that time ago. Which is why he used Udinaas to help Silchas escape the Azath in Midnight Tides.  Anyway, so Trull brought Fear to Seren, because she can help him out of the city, and be his guide while he looks for Scabandari's finnest.   Meanwhile, Udinaas, Kettle, and Iron Bars were at the Azath as Silchas comes out of it. Silchas needs a way out of the city without being detected, and Iron Bars suggests finding Seren to help. Kettle goes with Silchas because Silchas made some as of yet un explained promise to the Azath regarding Kettle in exchange for being let go. Udinaas tags a long because he has no where else to go, with Rhulad wanting him dead.  So that's how the whole group comes together. In Reaper's Gale, they've stuck together because both Fear and Silchas are looking for Scabandari's finnest, for different reasons, and Udinaas really just has no where else to go and stays with them."

Malazan,3834ep,future_forward,6,Mon Jun 1 14:44:53 2015 UTC,"Withal is first in MT, where we see him escape from the CG's island with Mael's help. He and Sand then eventually ends up in Malaz Island where they meet the Tisti Andii refugees from Drift Avalii (not to be confused with the Shake). We see this in TBH, and we see he is following someone's orders to wait for Tavore on Malaz. (And by the end of RG, it's pretty clear this was Mael's orders.)  That whole group goes with Tavore back to Lether, where they pretty much just hang out for most of the book, doing plot that isn't really relevant to this post. In the last chapter when all the shit starts going down, Tavore approaches Withal, tells him ""it's time"", and they leave together. The next we see Withal, he's appearing in the CG's island again to destroy the sword. So I think it's pretty clear he got there because of Mael, because he's really the only person who could have set up Withal with the orders to meet up with Tavore in the first place, to eventually come back and destroy the sword."
Malazan,3834ep,SageOfTheWise,2,Mon Jun 1 16:41:27 2015 UTC,"'""it's time"", and they leave together. The next we see Withal, he's appearing in the CG's island again to destroy the sword.""   This part I don't recall. Withal leaving with Tavore. As I recall it:  After escaping the island Withal waits on Malaz and meets up with Tavore at the end of bone hunters. They head to Lether. They stop at Second Maiden Isle where they meet up with the shake before assaulting the Lether Empire in the last book of Reapers Gale.  At the time of Karsa fighting Rhulad, Tavore's army is sailing up the Lether River towards Lether, they may have landed just outside Lether by this point. Karsa cuts off Rhulad's arm and heads through the portal.  Where are Tavore and Withal when Withal leaves for TCG isle? On the Lether River?"
Malazan,3834ep,drae-,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:31:52 2015 UTC,"Going by the Tor reread to get the details on this one. First half of chapter 24. Tavore and Withal are on the Froth Wolf when this happens, so probably the Lether River. It's whatever body of water they are on in the beggining of that chapter. And the scene immediately after has the Nacts jumping overboard into the water. Since they then appear with Withal on the CG island that probably strengthens the Mael connection."
Malazan,3834ep,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:45:24 2015 UTC,"Isn't Withal with the Shake when the stuff with Phaed goes down? Anyway.  Still not sure I'm sold about Withal/Mael but, yeah, the Nachts do jump overboard, so the connection is definitely there as you say. It's possibly one of the least clear points in the series – at that point, there's so much awesome stuff happening that it's so easy to overlook."
Malazan,3834ep,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:50:35 2015 UTC,Isn't everybody with the Shake more or less at that point? They're all on one of the Maiden Forts or something. It's not like they've gone off somewhere else with the Shake or anything.

Malazan,3834ep,drae-,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:19:27 2015 UTC,I don't doubt the mael connection.  Withal is with the shake. He's the one that throws phaed through the window.

What do you mean ""last seen""? I don't quite get what you are asking), so I'm not sure the best way to answer.   But Withal was picked up from the Meckros city (maybe this was in HoC, I dunno) by the Crippled God, made Rhulud's sword for him while stuck on that island with him, and sat around praying to Mael until he shows up and brings him and Sandalath back to the prison fort island thing back in the Letherii Empire. They run into the Shake there."

He can run a battlefield, but he can't predict who the enemy is and he can't predict the enemie's next move. Quick Ben is infinitely better at the twists and turns and complex stategies, but he still can't keep up with Shadowthrone. Ben wins a couple of individual show-odowns, but he never even sees all of Ammanas' strategies."

Malazan,381rr2,analton,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:34:10 2015 UTC,Would be a good fight. I know Kalams power seems to increase as the books go on. You also see throughout the series he sort of puts himself down in a way and is never overconfident. That being said when cotillion jumps in at Bithadals tent Kalam goes on to say that he was shocked at his skill. I think Cotillions Shadowdance would kill them both

In an essence: The Book of the Fallen only exists at all because of this enigmatic duo."
Malazan,381rr2,TwoColdOne,3,Mon Jun 1 18:26:40 2015 UTC,"Karsa & Samar put Karsa within swishing distance of The Crippled God. They would rival Cotillon and Ammanas for sheer power. Rake and Brood would be hard to beat, too. Mappo exists only to hit Icarium on the head to stop him.   But in the end, it will be a tie between Team Tehol and Kruppe's Clan."

Malazan,381rr2,bilbo_elffriend,3,Mon Jun 1 15:07:01 2015 UTC,"Without Samar Dev Karsa could not have taken that cursed sword back to the island at all.   Remember it was with her knife she trapped the spirits and it was her releasing them that allowed for the portal to be made. I think she does in her own way. She is loyal and strong, and her influence on Karsa is pretty significant. Im not sure Karsa would be as awesome as he is if she wasnt there to act as counterweight and conscience in some cases.  Also, In my opinion the teams dont have to have magical powers or some otherworldly abilities. They just have to kick ass in their own way."

Onrack and Trull were goddam heartbreakers, everytime the book goes onto trull in Reapers gale he's crying, Definately and emotional read.  I could go on and on. Fiddler and Hedge the 2 living legends and Cuttle and Fiddlers relationship is also a good one.

FoD definitely is great but I will always love the Malazans and the other characters. Tehol and Kruppe are my favorites. They stood out and were so empathetic and compassionate. I would love to have seen Tehol succeed and create a just kingdom. Also a Kruppe offshoot (maybe his backstory) would be the best thing ever.   I found ICE to just be missing something. NoK, OST, and Assail are my faves by him but they all don't end strongly and have characters that are blah (Kyle). The only character I hated in Erikson was Crokus. ICE is worth reading though.

Malazan,381dst,Foliagus,2,Mon Jun 1 04:45:42 2015 UTC,"Warrens, like some other concepts, get fleshed out little by little throughout the series. I recommend not to try to understand everything immediately and just enjoy the ride. You will be getting a better grasp on many things the further you are into the series. Don't worry if things don't make sense at first. Eventually, everything gets explained and there will be many ""Oh!"" and ""Holly shit!"" moments along with ""Fuck yeah!"" and also ""Nooo! Dammit! sniff"" moments.

I'll have to pass on your spoiler because I love the surprises of the series, I'm just really interested in learning more about the Forkul Assail. They seem a little amoral and obviously have a lot of power.

And where does lieutenant fit in, between sergeant and captain or are there any more ranks in between?"
Malazan,37vsmj,iamthelostone,2,Tue Jun 2 16:50:15 2015 UTC,Lieutenant appears to be the lowest officer role; between Sergeant and Captain and roughly equivalent to Master Sergeant. Master Sergeants aren't so much in the combat chain of command; they're ancillaries and are in charge of training.
Malazan,37vsmj,AllWrong74,1 point,Sat May 30 20:56:11 2015 UTC,"Correct. Lieutenant is the lowest ranked, commissioned officer."
Malazan,37vsmj,i_a1m_to_misbehave,5,Sat May 30 21:01:40 2015 UTC,"An adjutant is a military officer who acts as an administrative assistant to a senior officer. So, it would be the assistant to a Fist or a High Fist. It's not really in the chain of command, more like a box sticking off to the side. He/she will wield power, because they have the ear of the Fist/High Fist.  The Adjunct is basically the same thing, only the Adjunct is the assistant/right hand woman of the Empress instead of a high ranking military officer.  EDIT:  Also, keep in mind that militaries didn't really have many ranks (not counting the Navies) until the modern day (late 19th to 20th century).  Most had Generals, Captains, Lieutenants, Sergeants, and maybe Corporals, then the run-of-the-mill soldier.  Basing the Malazan military structure on this, you would have (real world modern-day USMC analogue in parenthesis...I use USMC because that's the branch I served in...also XO means Executive Officer (2nd in command) and CO means Commanding Officer):   Soldier/Sapper/Heavy - run-of-the-mill soldier - (Private, Private First Class, and Lance Corporal) Corporal - lieutenant of a squad - (Corporal) Sergeant - captain of a squad - (sergeant) Lieutenant - 2nd in command of a regiment -  (regimental XO - Lt. Colonel) Captain - commander of a regiment - (regimental CO - Colonel) Fist - commander of a brigade - (Division CO - Brigadier General (1 star General)) High Fist - supreme commander of an army, also a military governor - (General (4 star General))   As you can see, many ranks are left out, as are many unit sizes.  Modern militaries have fire teams, squads, platoons, companies, battalions, regiments and/or brigades, and armies.  The extra ranks and unit sizes became more necessary as more weapons with a wider area of efficacy came into play.  Way back in the day, axes and swords didn't matter that much, so you would divide along the lines of cavalry and infantry, then below that into light cavalry/heavy cavalry, light infantry/heavy infantry/archers, etc.  Then of course the smaller squads that operated together."
Malazan,37vsmj,AllWrong74,2,Sat May 30 23:25:14 2015 UTC,Would it be mentioning that above High Fist would be First Sword; supreme commander of the entire nation's forces?
Malazan,37vsmj,i_a1m_to_misbehave,2,Sun May 31 07:07:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I did forget that.  That would be the General of the Army (or the Fleet Admiral for the Navy).  A 5 start General (or Admiral).  In the US they only exist during time of war.  The General of the Army is in charge of all Army Operations in their theater (like Dwight Eisenhower in WW2) and the Fleet Admiral is in charge of all Naval Operations (like Chester Nimitz in WW2).    Actually...the 5-star guys are more like High Fists, so change my original list to fit this.  The First Sword doesn't have much of a real world equivalent."
Malazan,37vsmj,AllWrong74,1 point,Sun May 31 08:33:37 2015 UTC,"George Washington, who was the equivalent of a six-star general - or at least, made so posthumously."

It would have had the title of General of the Armies.  They did posthumously award Washington the rank of General of the Armies (in 1976 during the bicentennial brouhaha and it was described by someone as being ""a six-star rank""), but no such rank actually exists."
Malazan,37vsmj,iamthelostone,1 point,Sun May 31 10:08:51 2015 UTC,"the equivalent   No rank exists, but as General of the Armies he would have been equivalent to the First Sword. Also, there has been a law passed that states that no commander shall reach the same rank as Washington, which would in theory have him as being a six-star rank.   I think this only applies to the army, as well - I believe there was a Naval commander who attained a six-star equivalent rank? I'm not entirely certain, as I'm not actually American."

He/She doesn't fit into the traditional military ranks but essentially possesses all of the Empress/Emperor's authority. Generally speaking, an adjunct would not be commanding an army personally under normal circumstances.   There's also the First Sword, basically the top military commander. This rank had only been held by Dassem until certain events occur in Malaz City."

Just in the Bonehunters you will see at least 4 important ones (Sort, Kindly, Keneb, Ruthan Gudd).  And there are plenty of others elsewhere if you pay attention (Paran).

Malazan,37sowx,GPSBach,10,Sat May 30 02:01:35 2015 UTC,"[Spoilers all]  I don't know how accurate this is, but it's generally acknowledged that the Azathanai are the most powerful beings around. Some beings can rival their power - it's hinted that it's unknown how things would have gone down between Brood and Rake had they ever fought. I don't think Hood is ever really seen truly letting loose.   From the reactions of... well, the entire world, when Dragnipur is destroyed, especially the Elder Gods, I'd say that Draconus sat right up at the top of that pile. The only one who strikes me as being more potentially powerful is Ganoes Paran.   So... in a lump at the top, I'd have the Azathanai, Anomander, Osric, Dassem, Hood, Burn, Cotillion and Shadowthrone. Probably Mother Dark and Father Light, too. I'd probably put Icarium in rage mode in there as well. Draconus and Paran are at the top of that heap. The sort of beings that, through their actions, could probably wipe out the better part of continents should they really put their minds to it.  Next tier down; major gods like Treach, Togg, Fanderay, Beru, T'riss. Powerful Ascendants; Menandore, Spite, Envy, Silchas, Scabandari, Korlat, Orfantal, the Bridgeburners, Stormy and Gesler. The Eleint. Karsa. The Deragoth. The Hounds. Kimloc. If Kimloc wasn't boasting, then maybe he ought to be a tier up, but it's hard to say. I think I'll also include Quick Ben and Trull Sengar, as well as Kallor. Maybe Fiddler. Beak. That lot could probably put a fair dent in a city. In terms of personal power, not Laseen, but she's on this level in terms of what she can get done.   Then individual Jaghut. Onos T'oolan. Probably Greymane. Ruthan Gudd. The Agatii of the Seguleh. Gruntle.   I've probably missed plenty out, but that gives you a good idea of how I perceive the general relative power levels."
Malazan,37sowx,i_a1m_to_misbehave,9,Sat May 30 02:22:12 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't put Dassem at the top. And maybe not Osric either. Definitely not Shadowthone or Cotillion, they get by with intelligence not raw Power.    On the other hand, you seem to have missed Gothos, who is definitely in the top tier. I also think that most of your ""probably's"" are more clearly top tier than your initial list. Icarium, Mother Dark, Draconus, Paran are all premier individuals.  Also, T'riss is Azathanai and should be at the top (both because she is Azathanai, and because she is a central goddess). I think your secondary level is pretty solid, which I guess isn't really hard considering how nebulous everything is."
Malazan,37sowx,TocTheEternal,1 point,Sat May 30 03:57:53 2015 UTC,"I missed Gothos, yep. I would put Shadowthrone and Cotillion up there because, well, they're pretty much a single unit. Shadowthrone is powerful. He had command of the First Throne. He got onto the ancient Throne of Shadow. You never really see him properly throw down, but that's not for lack of ability. Cotillion is lethal.   And yet their most dangerous attributes are those of planning. Between the two of them... it's safe to say that their actions as well as Kaminsod's had more effect on the world than any others'. The difference is that theirs were, for the most part, deliberate."
Malazan,37sowx,i_a1m_to_misbehave,1 point,Sat May 30 04:04:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess if you lump them together, and I sorta forgot about the First Throne and the fact that they haven't even claimed the true Shadow throne yet, you get a top tier force."
Malazan,37sowx,TocTheEternal,1 point,Sat May 30 04:15:41 2015 UTC,"You never really see Shadowthrone and Cotillion in a fight against another powerful enemy the way you see, for example, Rake fight the demon in GotM. Or even Karsa fight Icarium. It's hard to tell how...strong they are. But in terms of power, they basically set out to change the world and succeed.  What I love about High House Shadow is that they are definitely powerful but prefer discretion. Remember Iskaral Pust fighting Kruppe? Hilarious fight but we know from Pust fighting Dejim Nebrahl in The Bonehunters that Pust is actually a powerhouse."
Malazan,37sowx,PromisedPrince694,3,Sun May 31 13:40:10 2015 UTC,"Well put; I agree with much of what you wrote.  I'd put K'rul on the inside track of that lump at the top, and Gothos somewhere in the top 5 (iirc Erikson said something about how powerful Gothos is in some interview).  Kaminsod too.  Honorable mention for Oponn."
Malazan,37sowx,NickofSantaCruz,2,Sat May 30 03:17:42 2015 UTC,"K'rul is one of the Azathanai, so is included in that lot at the top. I wasn't sure about Oponn. Kaminsod should have gone in, but what bears thinking about is that he was actually summoned from another realm and torn apart. Not quite sure as to how that happened in the first place, but yes, he is powerful.   Gothos is a bit of a mystery for me. He's probably on a similar plane to Kruppe, and sort of outside the system - although Gothos is more overtly magically and physically powerful, much of what they accomplish is through intelligence and manipulation."
Malazan,37sowx,i_a1m_to_misbehave,7,Sat May 30 03:44:51 2015 UTC,"I think Gothos is actually fairly clear. He's basically an untouchable mover in the universe. In one of the prologues Mael (an Elder God) asks him for a favor, which turns out to be a cosmologically altering continent wide, milennia long enchantment. Which Gothos just kinda does without any aplomb.  Not just that, but in FoD he turns out to not only be the one to convince an entire race to abandon civilization entirely, but that race happens to be the only one that is close to on par with the Azathanai (which is almost interchangeable with ""Elder God"").  And he knows their full nature probably as well as they do, yet doesn't really care about them at all or treat them any differently than he does some random human.  I don't rate anyone above him."
Malazan,37sowx,TocTheEternal,1 point,Sat May 30 04:05:05 2015 UTC,"Eh, you're probably right. I'd still put Draconus and Ganoes above him. And in a whowouldwin contest, I reckon there are a few could take him. Oddly enough for the Malazanverse, in a straight fight, he's probably one of the only people Icarium couldn't kill."
Malazan,37sowx,i_a1m_to_misbehave,2,Sat May 30 04:09:21 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think that Draconus would even be a threat to him.  If Draconus were to ever make a move, not only would Gothos be just as powerful head on, but his general prescience would make it not even be a real contest.  I mean, somehow Anomander ends up killing him (though there are a lot of circumstances involved) even while wielding Dragnipur, and I don't think Anomander is really on par with Gothos.  Ganoes is weird. I think with some clever plan and preparation, and maybe a bit more experience with his power, he might be able to do it."
Malazan,37sowx,TocTheEternal,4,Sat May 30 04:14:09 2015 UTC,"I'm really not sure as to how Anomander ended up killing Draconus. But seeing as Draconus was killed with Dragnipur, and I doubt that he was killed in the same fashion as Anomander - as that was deliberate - as well as all of the Azathanai referring to him as ""the biggest wolf of them all"", I really do rate him very highly. The biggest tell is how, upon his return, everyone got the metaphysical snot kicked out of them.  And yeah. Ganoes can basically do what he want with the system of magic. The Warrens contain significantly more power than the Holds, now, as evidenced by Fid's reading in Letheras. The mention of the Master of the Deck really puts the shits up Errastas. So... hard to say what Ganoes can actually do. But I have a feeling that, given enough time to get a feel for things, he can do what he wants."

Also Mael in a true rage, would be interesting to see how he would match up to some of the other gods. Throughout the books Karsa is sort of being built up as a godlike character though when he meets dasseem and wouldn't' cross blades with him we sort of get the feel there really are a lot stronger people out there.   There's also the crimson guard, we here alot about Skinner and the i've not read the esslemonts yet so not sure if he's in there. By whats mentioned of him I think he must be on or above Dassem/Rakes/Karsas level, Especially when iron bars kills 4 tarenthal gods and isn't considered a better fighter than him"
Malazan,37sowx,chappyyy,2,Wed Jun 3 20:45:25 2015 UTC,"K'ruls ""modern"" power hasn't been called into open question yet AFIK. Consider that he literally is the font of all non-Azathenai magic power as far as we know so far.   Everything he does is very minor power expenditure and loads of careful planning and manipulation, he has made no overt moves so far in the series ...  Almost seems much like he's very carefully presenting a far weaker front than is probably true.   His power, though, should be somewhat decreased compared to some others due to his ""death"" as a god - Kallor's curse that he lose his followers and be forgot would have been true death to a more conventional god, so it's a safe assumption that his Azathanai power would remain. It's unclear what he sacrificed to grant his boon of sorcery beyond ""his veins are warrens"" etc., but even simply owning the system itself should convey some measure of control and power, even were that not intentional. Paran for instance is sold initially as more a tool of the Deck than the reverse, but that later it's shown to be an alternate sort of power he was able to learn to control and wield."

C: Guys Like Greymane, Stormy, Gesler, the First Sword guard, most Seguleh. Most potent mages not listed yet.  This is very incomplete. And there is plenty of crossover. In the right circumstances or just in 1v1 combat someone might beat someone else in a tier above them, but in general this is how I rate overall potency."
Malazan,37sowx,TocTheEternal,1 point,Sat May 30 04:02:05 2015 UTC,Well we are speaking as if Age = Power when power is actually derived from ones current place in the hierarchy.  I think it is fair to accept that Rake at his height could have possibly been the Alpha.  Possibly not in raw power but perhaps in efficacy.  Can that also be said for Icarium.  He made new warrens from a machine.  Dassem with Vengeance in theory in unstoppable until he achieves his goals.  My current Picks as the universe stands at the end of TCG would be Shadow Throne or Mael but we have seen Mael cuckolded by a human.

Malazan,37pu23,wehavedrunksoma,12,Fri May 29 13:24:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you're criticizing besides there being no drawbacks to a magic user using magic.  You seem to ramble your thoughts and it's hard to follow.  If you are saying there are no drawbacks to being a magic user, then you're wrong on a couple fronts.  For one, this magic system isn't the same as say The Second Apocalypse series, where mages are damned and have their souls tainted for using magic, as that magic is tired to God's power, and using it is against God's demand.  In Malazan, the warrens were given freely to the world. They exist as their own world, with their own species in them.  Some magic is based on Warrens, some on Holds, some on other things.  Using certain magic corrupts and destroys you.  Using some other magic requires blood or a sacrifice of life of another. Hell even in book one they show this, so you should have seen this already.  You say you're halfway through the series, so continue reading and fine out even more, as things get explained and expanded a lot as the series goes on.  So far you've dealt with some powerful mages that are far from ordinary.  The criticism you have regarding stirring an ascended being makes no sense.  The people in the series that deal with Ascendants, do so because they are very special people and have connections with those Ascendants for various reasons.  Some were former priests for the Gods, some knew Ascendants before they ascended, some people are way older than you think they are and are not who you think.  A random person in an army or the world will have no connection with the Ascendants and Gods in the Malazan universe.  What quest are you referring to?  The 10 main series books tell a story that has a definitive goal at the end.  Everything builds up to the end.  There isn't any lack of gravitas.  You may be missing entire plotlines if that's your conclusion.  The convergence at the end of the books is a writing style of Erickson, he uses the entire book to build up to a boiling point which you don't know, then unloads it and you see it all in hindsight."
Malazan,37pu23,sonofa2,4,Fri May 29 14:35:55 2015 UTC,"I do think that the Malazan series is like one of those D&D games with a generous DM, where all the characters soon have godlike abilities.  But at the same time, enough horrible things happen to those same characters, including death or loss of powers, to make it exciting nevertheless, a battle of supermen and superwomen, taking place on a vast stage.    And then Erikson also slips in seemingly ordinary characters, sidekicks and bystanders, who can bring the supers down to earth, or even up the odds with some explosives or help from an Azath House or maybe just some local connections.  Often, however, those who hang around with supers eventually become supers themselves, whether they want to or not.  Many characters wish they could slip off and disappear, and some actually do so.  However, retirement isn't always what they dream it could be.  They can get restless and find themselves back in the game."
Malazan,37pu23,wjbc,5,Fri May 29 15:35:04 2015 UTC,"There is a pretty staggering revelation about the nature of the warrens rather early on in the series; if you're past MoI, you should have encountered it already. It frames the cost of magic even existing pretty well. I didn't personally feel like the magic in the Malazan world needed to exact a personal toll on the user each time, but it really does in many ways (e.g. Tattersail at the siege of Pale).  There are a couple of instances early on in the books which demonstrate that performing magic isn't a hassle free process. In addition to being physically draining, being a magic user of the wrong 'type' can run you afoul of the wrong people (for more information, see Tattersail's involvement in the Imperial Purge in Malaz, and the Otataral mines).    The 'Ascendant' level mages have a somewhat easier time with throwing their magical weight around, but they have other greater burdens to bear (Dragnipur, for example)."
Malazan,37pu23,titanemesis,4,Fri May 29 16:53:23 2015 UTC,"First, you're reading this series as if it were written like a normal series.  That's not the case.  View it as the Major Events on Wu Over the Course of a Decade (or thereabouts).  Read it like you're reading a history book, not a fantasy novel.  Shifting your expectation this much will do a whole lot to your pacing issues, since your issues are caused by your preconceived notions of how a novel's pacing should be (not that this is your fault, it's the way we've all been trained for decades when reading fantasy books).  Second, there's quite a lot of personal cost to using magic.  People can cripple and/or kill themselves by using too much power.  To be slightly spoilerish, I can think of 2 specific times (just as a way of being extremely specific, there are more than just these 2) where someone cripples or kills themselves as a cost of using magic.  Third, (this one addresses your issues with Ascendants and magic both) this book focuses on the truly special cases.  There's another thread in /r/Malazan right now asking about who is the most powerful.  A name that appears on just about everyone's list is (this reveal has already been given to you if you have made it past MoI, but the full import doesn't hit until later, just a warning before you hover over the tag) MoI Spoiler.  He doesn't look that powerful, and he doesn't come from a background that would make you think of him as super powerful, yet he is the badass's badass.  Most of the characters in the series, regardless of how little power they appear to have are extremely special in at least one way.  This gives them the right and ability to meddle in the affairs of Ascendants, as well as toss around magic like there's no limit."
Malazan,37pu23,AllWrong74,2,Sat May 30 13:40:04 2015 UTC,"I don't really know what you mean about their objectives getting achieved too fast. To me it seemed more like half of the books the characters are walking/marching to some destination, and it's following their thoughts the whole way, then out of no where some crazy shit happens."
Malazan,37pu23,Storm-Of-Aeons,2,Fri May 29 16:43:57 2015 UTC,"I think one of the main differences in Malazan as compared to other fantasy series is that we are as the reader put into the head of the character. Even in POVs we don't get a stream of thoughts, we mainly get actions. This is actually a very Malazanish thing wherein we are viewing the tale of the fallen from afar, as if someone like Duiker is telling it, we are not living it.  As for the point of stirring with ascendants and magic having a lower cost as compared to other series, Malazan just shows that everyone is not equally capable and that, like in real life, there will be people who are inherently better at certain things than others.  Another point is that in Malazan the Gods are real people who have ascended, a Malanzander would have a very different view of a God as compared to a religious Earth human (in our religions God is considered omnipotent which Malazan Gods are definitely not) so Malazanders are closer in a sense to their Gods than us."
Malazan,37pu23,nandanvora,2,Fri May 29 18:55:37 2015 UTC,"Really good point about the gods in this series, for a world with so much talk about divinity and religion, it does a lot to undermine the whole basis of worship.  It's not just that the gods fight amongst themselves, it's also that they have fundamental flaws and weaknesses and can be replaced by humans, who in turn have fundamental flaws and weaknesses and can be replaced by other humans, until you start to wonder whether there's anything godlike about the gods.  And, indeed, many of the characters want no part of religion and despise priests, at least two I can think of are former priests who turned their back on religion, and several of the characters chosen by the gods would just as soon spit on the gods who chose them."

Malazan,37pu23,Capt91,1 point,Fri May 29 22:50:19 2015 UTC,"I'm only on book 4. But my criticism would be about the pacing too. Used to game of thrones, I read about a character and think  ""wow, by the end of the series, this character might be King of Assassins""  But then they'll be King of Assassins by the end of the chapter because everything escalates so fast!   I guess it's not a bad thing, but it just makes it hard to predict.   At this rate, by the end of the series, I'm expecting a character to grow to 350ft tall, have full control of time and matter, and they'll be battling aliens in space"
Malazan,37pu23,Clearly_a_fake_name,1 point,Fri May 29 20:06:25 2015 UTC,The series covers massive spans of time for the sake of the overarching plot. It has to move along. I like it. I don't like slowly paced stuff so much.

Icarium/Karsa RAFO   Think back to a certain event in Deadhouse Gates involving a songwriter and an encounter with Fiddler... This is a big, involved question and many threads have been written on this, start scouring the r/malazan. There is no hard set of rules.  Ascending can happen many ways, through great deeds, great hardship, or magic. The general consensus is that gods are ascendants who's power comes from worshipers.  (Fenrir, Treach, T'riss)  You do not need a House to become a god, you can be Unaligned. A big theme in Malazan is what happens when the worshipers no longer like their god, or vice versa?

The Crippled God is basically just trying to get himself freed and is willing to do anything to achieve that goal.  The same can be said of Kallor.  Expounding this concept to every other character, you see this as a sort of universal truth: we are sometimes willing, due to circumstances within and beyond our control, to sacrifice our morals and principles to achieve our goals.  As for the Patriotists movement, I can't rightly recall all the details, but it sounds like a [British/French] political organization common to those we see in human history that sees its influence rise and fall over time.  In low points, the group does what it can to survive until the times change and its platform/agenda can be supported and advanced by coalition."
Malazan,37m241,NickofSantaCruz,1 point,Thu May 28 17:11:54 2015 UTC,"Great response - thanks for sharing.  Totally agree.

Malazan,37m241,TriscuitCracker,2,Thu May 28 17:56:33 2015 UTC,"You are correct, the Crippled God was brought to this world by wizards who were trying to use his power to get Kallor out of office. Kallor will do anything to change the curse placed upon him by the Elder gods, and he knows the Chained God had no say in Kallor's situation, the wizards were the hand that tried to swing the proverbial sword and failed so to speak, so no harm, no foul I think.

Malazan,37m241,Giotto,3,Thu May 28 18:16:46 2015 UTC,"It's also worth noting that the Crippled God is the perfect patron for Kallor. The Crippled God's worshippers are beggars, cripples, the broken, the infirm, the failures of the world.  Kallor is the High King of Failures, thanks to the curse the Elder Gods dropped on him.  It makes sense for the Crippled God to invite Kallor into his pantheon, and it makes sense for Kallor to accept."
Malazan,37m241,Giotto,2,Fri May 29 00:38:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think that the Patriotists existed under the old King at all, and if they did they would have had a very minor role.  The have so much power so quickly because they are the tool that the (previously ruling) high Letherii class (in particular the Chancellor and the Consign) sponsors to maintain the previous status quo and make sure that their new ruling class is mostly just an annoying leech rather than a serious authority in their society.   The Edur were a tribal people. They have essentially no way to manage a massive cosmopolitan empire such as Lether. I'd imagine peoples like the Mongols had similar issues in places like China.  They are more like leeches on the society than actually running it because they have no ability to replace the existing bureaucracy and power structures, and no longer really have a home for themselves (the ""pre-emptive"" mage strike at the beginning of the war destroyed their villages).  The Patriotists is just a natural symptom of a sophisticated bureaucracy/aristocracy shutting out their nominal and unprepared imperial rulers from real power."
Malazan,37jrfj,Xardov,13,Thu May 28 03:18:47 2015 UTC,"I assumed it was an unspoken challenge, like the fight between Tool (Onos T'oolan) and the Seguleh Third in Memories of Ice.  The fact that the D’ivers and Mappo warn Karsa against it just made it more likely that Karsa would take the challenge.   Also, Mappo says before the fight that it's inevitable due to the rule of convergence, telling Karsa that “when curses collide . . . singular purpose. Powers and wills are drawn together, as if one must by nature seek the annihilation of the other. Thus, you and Icarium are now here, and we are moments from a dreadful convergence.”  However, I'm not sure Icarium's heart was really in it, he wasn't angry, and therefore he was vulnerable."

What exactly is the deal with Mother Dark? Why do the Tiste Andii say she turned away/betrayed them? Was this because she got it on with Father Light?  Is the above related to Anomander Rake's ""betrayal"" of her? Was this how the Tiste Andii lost her?   These two go hand in hand.

Eventually it lead to war and destruction, and Anomander lead a group of a bunch of the head Andii to slay Tiam and drink her blood. All of this, specifically the last bit, lead Mother Dark to forsake the Andii and leave them. Here's the relevent quote from a flashback in TTH:   You have killed Tiam. My son, do you realize what you have begun? Silchas flees, yes, and where do you think he goes? And the newborn, the others, what scent will draw them now, what taste of chaotic power? Anomander, in murder you seek peace, and now the blood flows and there shall be no peace, not ever again. I forsake you, Anomander blood of Tiam, Dragnipurake. I deny my first children all. You shall wander the realms, bereft of purpose. You deeds shall avail you nothing. Your lives shall spawn death unending. The Dark - my heart - is closed to you, closed to you all.   So basically, Mother Dark considers what Anomander and the Andii did a betrayal, and the Andii consider her abandoning them for it a betrayal.    Was Mother Dark locked inside the gate being pulled within the wagon inside Dragnipur? If so, how did that even happen? I thought Draconus forged Dragnipur. Why would he put a warren in a sword that contains the Gate of Darkness inside a wagon that is pulled away from Chaos (how did that get in there?) by the souls of those who were slain by the sword? That whole scenario confuses me.   Mother dark is not in the gate. She just left to someplace no one found her to do whatever she wanted. We only know eventually she decided to reside in  Aranatha because of the events that were going on at the time. Basically, with Mother Dark gone, Draconus was under the incorrect assumption that the gate of darkness was now undefended from the forces of chaos. So he devised this whole Dragnipur thing as a defense, or more of a flee from chaos. The souls pull the gate away from chaos forever basically. I forget the exact nature of this now, but somehow it turned out the gate of darkness was never actually in danger of being taken by chaos, but Dragnipur removed that protection. And now with the Dragnipur system, it was inevitable that one day chaos would catch up.   What was the point of Dragnipur in the first place? If Rake betrayed Mother Dark and locked her away, why did he sacrifice himself to return her? Did he just regret that or something?   Mostly answered above. Rake never locked mother dark away. But in the millenniums since the betrayal, Rake does regret the whole thing, and he sacrifices himself to unbind the gate from the wagon and fix the whole system again so the gate to darkness is stationary again and protected for real. And mother dark saw this sacrifice and decided it was also time to forgive the Andii for their betrayal and return to them."
Malazan,37islb,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Wed May 27 23:50:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed response! Follow-up:   If Mother Dark simply turned away and, thus, was not hindered in any way as I originally thought, are you saying that she could have defended the Gate of Darkness from Chaos had Draconus not locked it in Dragnipur? If the above is true, does that mean I can blame Draconus for the eventual loss of one of my favorite characters? Then again, part of Rake's badassery came from all of his deeds related to the sword, Draconus, Mother Dark, etc..."
Malazan,37islb,SageOfTheWise,3,Thu May 28 00:03:04 2015 UTC,"I really wish I could find a good reference to what I was thinking of with the gate always being safe... believe it was something Draconus talking about, probably in TTH. Maybe someone will be able to pull it up. But I want to say that for 1, basically yes, but its not that she would defend it, it didn't need defending. It could defend itself basically... or something. Need to find the relevent passages.  As for 2, what Draconus did wasn't all bad. It did also basically distract chaos for a few millenia. Now that it isn't all focused on the gate of darkness there could be consequences coming..."
Malazan,37islb,docforlife,2,Thu May 28 00:40:27 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, the gate basically 'drifted' throughout existence randomly.  This protected it from chaos because chaos could never catch up to it.  When it was chained in Dragnipur, though, it was kind of rooted in place so chaos could follow it"
Malazan,37islb,SageOfTheWise,2,Thu May 28 03:21:43 2015 UTC,"I want to say it was something about the gate wandering around a blackwood forest, but that's all I've got. It was all very metaphysical whatever it was."

It was wielded first by Draconus, who had forged it, then Anomander Rake , who slew Draconus imprisoning him inside his own creation, thus fulfilling Kallor's curse against him. The sword was a Warren containing the Gate of Darkness. This gate was held within an immense cart, which was drawn by chains linked to the souls of all individuals who have been slain with Dragnipur. The cart was endlessly pursued by the forces of Chaos.  Interesting: Cast | Ditch | Venesara | Jalan    Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Malazan,37islb,skirpnasty,1 point,Thu May 28 16:38:15 2015 UTC,"My understanding was that Rake's sacrifice was so great that it essentially forced Mother Dark to turn back to them and forgive any perceived wrong they had done in drinking of Tiam. The heart of darkness was vulnerable because it wasn't occupied, mother dark had essentially left a void on the throne. In the event that Hood assaulted the realm of death, I assume that the heart of darkness essentially took the role of death. So the original order was for death and chaos to be continuously in struggle, which is why it was critical for Hood and his realm to enter Draginpure and take the place that darkness had been fulfilling. When this happened Rake was able to sacrifice himself and free darkness from Draginpure, and death had taken it's natural place in battling chaos. In book 9 or 10 you're told that Hood waged the war nobody else would and took up arms against death, through the experiment/events of Draginpure we have seen that death was necessary to keep the force of chaos at bay.    These are just my thoughts, quite possibly wrong."
Malazan,37hmdp,ChaosBrat,13,Wed May 27 18:22:42 2015 UTC,"I assumed ascendants to be kissing cousins with gods, and Elder Gods to be something even further removed genealogically. At this point, the relationships seem to be much more incestuous   I'm not sure what you are trying to say here. One of the common themes, most explicitly explored in ICE's books, is that there are many routes to Ascendancy, and that Ascendancy itself is a nebulous term.  I don't think that there is a ""coherent existential system"". I feel like you are trying to do something analogous to defining the method of government on Earth into some coherent system. There just isn't one. Each sovereign nation and all of its multitude of subdivisions is an individual case with only a loose relationship to the existential nature of any of the others.  An ""Ascendent"" is just an especially powerful, or influential being. Generally one that either through will, popular recognition, or magic has achieved a potency that reaches beyond that of a normal human or other mundane species.  A ""god"" is generally just an ""Ascendent"" with worshippers, though this is not always the case.  And just like human governments each have a distinct relationship with their governed and other governments and different ways of obtaining and expressing their power and authority, the nature of Ascendants, their roles and capabilities, and their relationships with others can be unique and up to interpretation.  So for a single specific case, while most of the ""Elder Gods"" are Azathanai, not all of them are (e.g. Mother Dark). And not all Azathanai became gods at all (Envy, Spite, Caladan Brood), and not all Azathanai that became gods are considered ""Elder Gods"" (T'riss). It is simply a somewhat arbitrary distinction loosely based on the length of their existence and that of their worshippers.  So I think it is very clear that looking for a coherent system governing how this all works is futile. That isn't to say that there isn't a ton of room for speculation about each of these beings and how they relate to each other, their similarities, their shared origins and histories, etc. But I don't think that it is appropriate to search for a clean system or hierarchy, like we will probably find in Sanderson's Cosmere."
Malazan,37hmdp,TocTheEternal,5,Wed May 27 19:31:41 2015 UTC,"Unless I'm forgetting about someone who breaks this, I'd add that the difference between a god and an elder god is and elder god's power is based on the old system that required all that blood sacrifice and stuff (the system The Errant was trying to bring back into power in the last books), and a god's is based on the new system made by K'rul.  Which is why you have elder beings like Hood or T'ris that aren't ""elder gods"" because they run under K'rul's system. This might also just be analogous to ""this is someone still normally worshipped"" vs ""this is someone who used to be worshiped"". That being said, this is Malazan, I'm sure there's some exception to this."
Malazan,37hmdp,SageOfTheWise,2,Thu May 28 00:05:04 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty good point. The only sorta exception I can think of is when the Errant tries to use Icarium's warrens.  Or maybe Mael, who is definitely an Elder God but also straddles the line and is associated with Ruse (which is of K'rul, but also noted somewhere as somewhat Elder) while still taking blood sacrifice."
Malazan,37hmdp,TocTheEternal,1 point,Thu May 28 00:15:26 2015 UTC,We are told that Hood could have been an elder god IIRC. Not sure what distinction makes him not so. Maybe he chose to be constrained by K'rull's warren system rather than allow death free reign?
Malazan,37hmdp,skirpnasty,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:50:42 2015 UTC,I'm sure we're going to learn a lot about that with Fall of Light coming out. Jaghut war against death and all that.
Malazan,37hmdp,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:59:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah it kind of makes sense that he would choose to restrict it to warrens, and maybe that is a catalyst for K'rull creating them. It seems that he definitely makes a choice to take on the aspect of death and surrender his hold on OP."
Malazan,37hmdp,skirpnasty,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:04:12 2015 UTC,"Crazy theory time: I have this unsubstantiated idea that the Jaghut War was to Death as K'rul was to magic.  Before Hood and his war, death was merely oblivion.  The Jaghut provided death with an infrastructural framework that bound it into an ordered system, effectively creating a sort of afterlife, perhaps even allowing for the possibility of resurrection in one way or another."
Malazan,37hmdp,tjordi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:51:15 2015 UTC,I mean in terms of power some of the Jaghut appear to be as powerful or more so than the Azathanai.  Hood and Gothos come to mind.  Hood biting off the Assail face still one of my favorite moments.

Malazan,37hmdp,i_a1m_to_misbehave,3,Wed May 27 22:05:04 2015 UTC,Haha well some of it is a bit spoiler-y.
Malazan,37hmdp,Montaron87,3,Wed May 27 22:12:26 2015 UTC,"Pretty good summary. I'd also add that the Houses of the Azath are constructed by one of the Azathanai, who is as yet unnamed, but Nimander helped him build a house around himself. It's also hinted that the Houses are distinct beings in and of themselves.   The term ""Elder Gods"" appears to omit Caladan Brood, who is actually one of the Azanathai.  The Nameless Ones worship the Houses of the Azath, which is why they were controlling Icarium; they feared he had the power to destroy them (pretty damned impressive, considering these things are meant to be the antithesis of unchained power).  Icarium also overlays a system of Warrens in Lether, but because of Gothos' use of Omtose Phellack, magic hadn't really evolved into Warrens there. Hence it being Errastas' hangout.  My take on Dassem is that while he and Dessembrae are the same being, they're simply different aspects. The difference from Cotillion/Ammanas is that they ascended through the Houses of the Azath, while he ascended through worship. As it is only one part of Dassem that was worshipped, the Ascendant is different to the mortal, yet they are the same. (Not very clear, but I hope that made sense.)   I assumed ascendants to be kissing cousins with gods, and Elder Gods to be something even further removed genealogically   So, all gods are Ascendants, not all Ascendants are gods. I think the qualification for godhood is worshippers. So when Dancer and Kellanved ascended and assumed the Throne of Shadow, they gained worshippers who followed the path of Meanas, and became gods. When the Bridgeburners ascended, they didn't have worshippers (at least, nothing more than hero-worship and admiration), and so they're just Ascendants.  That's my take, at least.  I'd like a bit more clarification in the role of the Master of the Deck with respect to K'rul/Tayschrenn. In the analogy that the Warrens are K'rul's blood vessels, would that make the Master the brain? Or some kind of surgeon, capable of altering it from the outside?"
Malazan,37hmdp,skirpnasty,2,Wed May 27 19:32:32 2015 UTC,"Dancer and Kellanved achieved their ascendancy after a romp behind the main stage of the world via the Azath Houses   Achieved isn't the right word here in my opinion. It's more that they completed their ascendancy. They started that path long before, basically when they started the Malazan empire.  Ascendancy is a process, usually started by obtaining a whole lot of power, influence or skill through normal or magical means and then building on that until you complete the (rather vague) process with some kind of final trigger.   Kalam is someone who's pretty obviously on his way there (outside of the Bridgeburner ascendency) if he were to seriously pursue it. So is Trull, and speculation says that Coltaine was one of the guys capable of going that way as well, seeing how his face was able to seriously hurt the hand of another person know for superhuman strength at point."

I don't really remember if there was a reason why it was Mammot that the Tyrant chose or it was the first random powerful person he came across, I'm sorry. Read on for answers, regarding the Azath. It's very nature and what it does is why people feel wrong around it.

Really appreciate your help!
Malazan,37gz0q,SageOfTheWise,4,Wed May 27 17:11:27 2015 UTC,So the whole Azath thing is weird form a literary perspective. It comes out of no where with no explanation in book 1 and is basically just a Deus ex Machina. But the rest of the series is in large part about the Azaths and their mysteries. GotM is just your really abrupt intro to that topic.
Malazan,37gz0q,wjbc,1 point,Wed May 27 16:44:11 2015 UTC,"Good to know. I was listening to it on audio and was like ""wtf just happened, what are they talking about, am I mishearing?"" - I went back and read those parts in the book and was like, ""nope, still a mystery""."
Malazan,37gz0q,TriscuitCracker,2,Wed May 27 17:10:09 2015 UTC,"First, I'm only on book 4, House of Chains, so there may be something I don't yet know.   I'm just wondering if my level of confusion with some of the end parts is normal.   Yes, it's normal.  I went back and read the whole book again, and still didn't get some questions answered until the next book.   Should I know what the Azath is in any depth?   No.  It will be explained in the next book.   Should I understand the whole Azath/Finnest/Azath House situation?   No. It will be explained in the next book.   Why did Mammot get possessed - I didn't think he had a warren?   It may have been due to Mammot's earlier activities spying on Raest while in a meditative state.  Mammot had trouble recovering from that state, and it may be that Raest had already established a connection.  But I'm not sure if it's ever explicitly explained in the first four books, at least.  I see that /u/FR05TB1T3 says it's explained in Ian C. Esslemont's Orb Sceptre Throne, which I have not read.   Why did people get a feeling of wrongness around the Azath stump? (Or was the wrongness from the Finnest?)   I'm not sure what you mean by the feeling of wrongness, do you have a quote?  But there's more about the Azath, in particular, in book 2, maybe you should come back after book 2 and see if your questions have been answered.   What is the Finnest monster Paran fights and where is he fighting it?   It's the Finnest that Paran fights, transformed into a tree-like monster and attempting to get back to Raest.  It's unclear where they are fighting, presumably some kind of warren or dreamscape but it's unclear which one and I'm not sure that's ever explained."

Malazan,37dj8o,livestockhaggler,3,Tue May 26 21:41:47 2015 UTC,Coming to the end of my re-read.  Its so much more enjoyable and understanable this time.
Malazan,37dj8o,TheInfelicitousDandy,2,Wed May 27 01:54:26 2015 UTC,"The beginning of GoTM is pretty confusing, but very rewarding for those patient enough to get through it.  Check out Tor's reread of the fallen, they do chapter summaries and commentary for every chapter of every book. Stick to Amanda's commentary, she wrote it on her first read through.   http://www.tor.com/features/series/malazan-reread-of-the-fallen/"
Malazan,37dj8o,Solarin88,1 point,Wed May 27 03:04:47 2015 UTC,"So here's the thing.  If you want to become immersed in the world of the Malazan Empire it's well worth it, very entertaining, epic.  But it's not easy, and that's part of the pleasure.    I've been reading each book twice, and I'm just starting my second reading of book IV.  When I get done I plan to read everything a third time.  But it's not a chore, it's pleasure.  It is a big commitment, though."

I'm alternating between Malazan and the Revelation Space series, so after I finish this book, I'll be starting Return of the Crimson Guard. I expect to be able to start my reread in about 8 months time. Seems like a long time, but so worth it."
Malazan,37dj8o,iamtheduff,1 point,Wed May 27 14:43:21 2015 UTC,Looooooove the Revelation Space series. I love the long game Reynolds plays with his plots. How you liking it? Which book are you on?
Malazan,37dj8o,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Wed May 27 15:59:11 2015 UTC,I'm halfway through Chasm City and I'm loving it. I take the bus everywhere and so I dig in traffic jams that let me immerse myself for two hours at a time. I'm really fond of his science background lending so much validity to the concepts presented in the story. Probably why I like Erickson so much too.

Malazan,37cy32,wjbc,6,Tue May 26 18:42:01 2015 UTC,"Kudos to you for reading each book twice, I hope you're a fast reader! You're correct, on a re-read you get so much more out of it, but usually we wait till the whole series is finished. I don't think you would need to do it for House of Chains, but you may need to do it for Midnight Tides, as it is a whole new continent set during the events of GotM up to HoC and all new characters execept for one.  The book after this, Bonehunters, starts to converge all the plots and subplots all the way up to the Crippled God. Glad you're enjoying it!"
Malazan,37cy32,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Tue May 26 19:14:12 2015 UTC,"That depends. I read the first four books multiple times while waiting for the next ones to be published, but after that I had (i) too much other reading, (ii) more work, so I waited and have recently started from the beginning again. Also made it to HoC."
Malazan,37cy32,itkovian,3,Tue May 26 19:54:01 2015 UTC,"I'm also rereading House of Chains.  What I am doing is every two weeks (or so...) I finish a book, then reread it immediately after.  The first time I read HoC I got so lost by the end of it, but now that I'm almost done with my reread I'm filling pumped for the next book.  Started doing this reread earlier this year, and am totally hooked on the Malazan World, just four books in.  Can't wait to read Midnight Tides, but I'm a little apprenhensive since it'll be a new setting and new charactyers for the most part, but it should fun.  Enjoy your reread!!!"
Malazan,37cy32,rowanlocke,2,Tue May 26 22:35:15 2015 UTC,I skipped Midnight Tides my first go because I just could not get enough Karsa. And the legacy of Coltaine. But I went back and afterward I could not get enough Tehol and Bug. This series...smhofl.

Malazan,37cy32,Juddah555,2,Wed May 27 02:15:07 2015 UTC,"The way these books are written are all about RAFO (Read and find out). I re-read Gardens of the Moon because I didn't understand it, but i still didnt after the re-read. It was only until reading the next books that I caught on.  You should honestly just read the book slowly, absorbing everything and then continuing the series. Then come back for a full re-read, which is what I'm doing and it's fantastic seeing all the foreshadowing and things that you could only pick up knowing the end game."
Malazan,378yqc,beandips,11,Mon May 25 21:09:58 2015 UTC,I'd wait. ICE books are best read in order.
Malazan,378yqc,TriscuitCracker,2,Mon May 25 21:18:44 2015 UTC,Okay that's fine. I was just wondering really if this was a series you could jump around with (like the Culture series) or best to go in order/(like Harry Potter).
Malazan,378yqc,TriscuitCracker,5,Mon May 25 21:24:55 2015 UTC,"No worries. Dumb question, did you read the main series?"

Malazan,378yqc,TriscuitCracker,14,Mon May 25 21:32:22 2015 UTC,"Start with Gardens of the Moon by Erickson and read the main 10 book series. Ian Esselmont's books are more like back stories to sub plots in the main series that get mentioned but aren't the driving force. It IS daunting at first, but stick with it and it is oh so rewarding."
Malazan,378yqc,Dullahan3470,3,Mon May 25 22:00:54 2015 UTC,Okay thanks for the info my friend. Good to see a sub where questions are actually answered.

Malazan,374uu6,MarquisHalimOndore,14,Sun May 24 22:05:50 2015 UTC,"I always think that if an author actually evokes an emotion in me because of the plot or a character, even if it's anger, even if I hate what's happened, that means that he or she has done their job. I care enough about said character to care about what befalls them, good or bad. Erikson does that multiple times throughout this series.   Fuck the Errant indeed."
Malazan,374uu6,TriscuitCracker,4,Sun May 24 22:44:05 2015 UTC,"exactly, the fact that I'm this upset just means he's done his job."
Malazan,374uu6,Xalimata,2,Sun May 24 22:53:03 2015 UTC,Ok I just finished this book a bit ago.  What did the Errant have to do with Trull's death?  It was that one stupid rapey guard who killed him I was more mad at the Crippled God for trying to trick Rulad back into the sword with the promise of his bother. Did the Errant mess with Trull's perception like with the Ceda?
Malazan,374uu6,cantlurkanymore,9,Mon May 25 07:11:14 2015 UTC,"Not much, just a nudge. I believe specifically, he stopped Trull noticing the owl and looking up.

Malazan,374uu6,Lankles,3,Sun May 24 22:19:13 2015 UTC,"I found Beak's death much more emotional, despite him being more minor of a character compared to Trull. Don't get me wrong, I cried for both of them, but while Trull's death was abrupt and over quickly (with only a few more references to it from Hedge, Quick Ben, and Seren POVs), Beak's was drawn out across many pages with tons of inner thoughts and purpose behind why he was sacrificing himself (saving his friends). Add in Hood coming to see to his soul personally and reuniting him with his brother, and it was all a great cryfest."

Malazan,376bkj,Morph19_,19,Thu May 28 01:47:02 2015 UTC,"It's not a trilogy. It's a ten book series plus seven and counting additional books that further flesh out the characters and world. It's definitely the most difficult book series I have ever read, but it is also the best."
Malazan,376bkj,Kaiedos,9,Mon May 25 06:55:46 2015 UTC,"A trilogy specifically refers to a series of three books. Lord of the Rings is a trilogy, Malazan and Potter are not.  Malazan isn't as straightforward as many other series. There is an end goal, but it isn't clear until later on and not every event necessarily moves towards that goal. Each character is on their own journey, but most of them get swept up in the events of the series along the way. You have some plot lines that end on a personal but ultimately unimportant note, and you have others that lead to huge changes in the world. Getting the whole concept is something you get by reading, not from a summary. It's more fun that way, anyways.  Seeing as you're in the Malazan subreddit, the answer to whether or not it's worth reading is obviously ""yes"" from people here. It is a hard read, though, and if your previous reading experience is around the level of Harry Potter/LOTR you might have issues. Those books deal with few characters, straightforward stories, and (at least for Potter) simple language. Malazan does not."
Malazan,376bkj,Shugo841,1 point,Mon May 25 07:04:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you say about the Malazan books, but LotR is not a trilogy, it is one book that was originally published in 3 volumes because the publishers thought a single volume edition would be too expensive."
Malazan,376bkj,WulftheRed,7,Mon May 25 19:22:12 2015 UTC,"First, its not a trilogy.  Secondly, malazan book of the fallen some of the greatest fantasy books I have read and I have never read a book whose world was as epic as this, both in might and size.  But if you think its anything like harry potter or LoTR, you are really really mistaken. This series is geared towards more mature readers and is lined with all sorts of realities.  Also it has many perspectives and requires a bit of patience.  Good reading!"
Malazan,376bkj,half-idiot,8,Mon May 25 07:00:49 2015 UTC,"It's a 10 book series and yes it's definitely worth reading but it's not for the faint of heart and the books are not your typical light fantasy type. It's got a cast of hundreds, tons of plotlines, world building galore and it will make you laugh, cry, and cheer.   Each book has an overall plot that contributes to the series as a whole, as you read them you connect all the dots and see the big picture the author is trying to achieve.   May I ask what fantasy you've read? Malazan isn't really idealy suited for the beginning fantasy reader, I mean, you could give it a shot, more power to you! If you do start it, post your impressions and we'll help if you wish, without spoilers."
Malazan,376bkj,TriscuitCracker,5,Mon May 25 07:28:58 2015 UTC,"It's very, very good.   It's also very, very long and very, very dense. This is not a light and crispy holiday read.   The theme... well, there's a lot of themes, but a lot of it centres around a military regiment in an imperial army... plus gods, elder gods,  sorcerors, shamans, dragons, barbarians, undead warriors and a whole lot more that would take a lot of explaining.   Imagine if Rome, the Turks, the Mongol hordes, Conan's roided up big brother, some extremely pissed off Inuit, a bunch of emogoth dark elves with nothing to lose, an island full of elite samurai plus all the mythical beasts and gods out of all their respective mythos...es  all decided to fuck each other up in a pattern of shifting alliances and betrayals, with lots and lots of highly unpleasant magic being thrown around.   (to be clear, it's not historical fiction - the civilizations in the book are a bit like the ones I listed above)  It's absolutely worth it, but it will take a respectable chunk out of a year to finish.   Standard disclaimers:    The first book is hard work. Most people take a few attempts to finish it.  The second and subsequent books are when the series will really grab you - stick with it until then.  The prose is dense, and some people find the vocabulary challenging.  Nothing is explained in advance - you're thrown in the deep end, and there's a lot you won't understand until later. Erikson does not hold your hand or spoon feed you. There will be lots of savage kicks in the feels. If you thought George Martin was evil to his characters, you ain't seen nothing yet."
Malazan,376bkj,TheBananaKing,1 point,Mon May 25 07:34:34 2015 UTC,This is a great description I'm stealing some of this when I attempt to sell this series at my job and they ask what it's about.
Malazan,376bkj,TriscuitCracker,4,Mon May 25 14:13:56 2015 UTC,"Standard Malazan Disclaimer Alert  You have to power your way through Gardens of the Moon (Book 1).  It was written a decade before Deadhouse Gates (Book 2).  The writing style changes a good deal.  In addition, you start GotM with as much knowledge of the world as, say, your average farmer.  You learn about Gods, Ascendants, Warrens (magic), etc. through reading the books.  There are no info-dumps, you learn through doing (so to speak).    Most people say they were completely hooked at the end of Deadhouse Gates (Book 2) or Memories of Ice (Book 3).  So, if you aren't in love with the series by then, it's a safe bet you won't be by the end of it.  I, personally, loved GotM and this disclaimer was wasted on me.  However, it is different enough that it's worth throwing the disclaimer at everyone that is thinking of reading the series.  This series is some of the best fiction it has ever been my privilege to read.  I hope you do decide to read it and if you do, I hope you enjoy it at least half as much as I did.  To anyone interested, join us over in /r/Malazan.  When you are weeping, and need someone to talk to, we understand; we've all been there.  When you want to celebrate a victory with Coltaine, etc.; we've been there too.    In this sub, you'll pretty much get nothing but a ""Yes, you should read it"".  /r/Fantasy might be a better place to go, since it's not full of fanboys (and fangirls, or girls really do exist on the internet, which I'm not convinced of).    The back-of-the-book blurbs won't do you a lot of good.  It's not a story like LotR or Harry Potter.  The author was an archaeologist.  He wrote it like a history.  It's basically a history of the major goings on over about a 10 year timeframe."

Malazan,370tnz,tenth,9,Sat May 23 20:25:48 2015 UTC,"There's also a fourth soul in there: the unborn/dead daughter of Pran Chole (The Imass bonecaster that was present). This is how Silverfox gained her bonecaster powers, and her name.  The way that Erikson has explained it is that Tellann's anti-magic aura somehow removes the influence of Hood's Path from the area. It's also a GotMism, and is never visited again in the series.  The reason she was born was because K'rul wanted a living bonecaster to be born to lead the T'lan, for whatever reason. Kruppe has weird dreams that clearly take place in some form of warren, and K'rul hijacked one to use as a place to create Silverfox. It's likely because the Rhivi Mhybe and Tattersail/Nightchill/Bellurdan were all in the vicinity of Darujhistan. Silverfox herself probably isn't an ascendant, just a Soletaken Bonecaster.   They do seem to appear to go back in time, with Pran Chole appearing as an Imass unaffected by the ritual. This is probably explained by K'rul being the father of warrens, and Erikson has repeatedly made mention of a ""warren of time"". K'rul would probably have power over that warren through virtue of creating it, allowing him to reach back in time to Pran Chole.  The Sister of Cold Nights is a part of Silverfox solely because Nightchill was the Sister in disguise the whole time. She's not very creative with names."
Malazan,370tnz,Oathsend,3,Sat May 23 21:09:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think K'rul was responsible for Tattersail's intial soul transfer into the body of Nightchill.  That happened because Tattersail happened to have put a spell of preservation on Nightchill's body, and also happened to have witnessed the transfer of Hairlock's soul.   Desperate, she opens her warren, killing both her own body and Bellurdan's, then transfers her soul into Nightchill's body.  At least, that was her intent.  Apparently because of the effect of the anti-magic aura, not just her soul but Bellurdan's as well transfer into Nightchill's body, but as it happens Nightchill's soul is still there as well.    Here's a detail I don't understand.  Why was Nightchill's soul still in her body, which has been dead for several days?  Was it because Nightchill is an Elder God in disguise and chose to hang around?  Was it because of Tattersail's spell of preservation?  Was it because Bellurdan had not performed the appropriate death rituals and Nightchill's spirit haunted him?  Was it still in its body, or just hanging around Bellurdan like a ghost?  Did Nightchill even need a body?  I don't think I've seen an answer to that.  So this unnaturally-preserved undead abomination with three souls in it gets out of the bag and leaves the scene and K'rul intervenes, and with the aid of Kruppe, the Mhybe, and a time-travelling Pran Chole (or maybe Pran Chole is the only one who doesn't travel time) transfers all those souls into the womb of the Mhybe.  As I understand it, a child had to be created to house the souls, because the Mhybe was not pregnant.  Presumably that's how Pran Chole begat a daughter of his own, although as far as I can tell no sexual intercourse was involved.  It was a magical form of artificial insemination, I suppose."
Malazan,370tnz,wjbc,2,Sun May 24 11:02:58 2015 UTC,"Here's a detail I don't understand. Why was Nightchill's soul still in her body, which has been dead for several days?     I can only really think of three possible reasons, tbh.   Elder God souls work differently to mortal souls after death. I don't think this is correct. Since Nightchill died at the scene of a massive battle where thousands of soldiers (and civilians, after the battle) also died, it caused some kind of soul-buildup that Hood couldn't deal with instantly. This is seen a couple times in the series. It's a GotMism.    I don't really think it'll ever be clarified, though. Maybe in the Kharkanas books."
Malazan,370tnz,Oathsend,1 point,Sun May 24 11:26:31 2015 UTC,"We know that Nightchill has inhabited several bodies over history, so I don't think it's completely unreasonable to attribute it to her being an elder god."
Malazan,370tnz,wjbc,3,Sun May 24 11:32:46 2015 UTC,"You've got it about right, I think.  The sealing spell on the body was involved too.  I don't think it's supposed to be perfectly clear, although it does get revisited later."

Think a Giant C formation that has been made into a fortress so that its impossible to get inside the C. They can see because the Riders glow they see glowing figures go in then less come out. The tide is massively higher after the wall breaks remember.

There is a character there who is associated with Greymane who has some pretty out there powers which includes a special sword.  edit:  As FR05TB1T3 says the Ring is a rock formation/island/mountain range, you can see it on the map in the front of the book."

Malazan,36xlvw,Galahad_Lancelot,22,Fri May 22 23:26:38 2015 UTC,Basically throughout the entire series you're following one army or another.  I assume by your post that you're still on book one.  I can safely say that book 2 will blow you away if you're looking to follow an army and their exploits
Malazan,36xlvw,docforlife,6,Fri May 22 23:41:55 2015 UTC,wowowow!!!!! yes I am still on book 1. Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Malazan,36xlvw,i_a1m_to_misbehave,5,Sat May 23 05:00:47 2015 UTC,I love reading about massive battles and the heroes that lead their armies. Martial prowess and most importantly the minds behind each maneuver. I want to really be invested in the leaders but also the entire army groups themselves.    This is basically how you describe most of the Malazan books.
Malazan,36xlvw,mykunos,3,Sat May 23 07:51:49 2015 UTC,"i swear to god I did not know and i just guessed. I thought this would be like GoT, lots of drama. but fantasy military campaigns and tactics?! YES!!!"
Malazan,36xlvw,mykunos,4,Sat May 23 11:04:45 2015 UTC,"Well, there certainly is drama as well, and Erikson's bromances are probably the best from any author I have ever read.  How far are you into the first book ? :)"
Malazan,36xlvw,Kellt_,4,Sat May 23 11:13:08 2015 UTC,about 90% done. yeah the camaraderie is awesome. and I like drama so it's all good. but Malazan seems to be a different kind of drama than GoT and plus they have army battles like you guys all tell me...so I am pumped!
Malazan,36xlvw,Kellt_,3,Sat May 23 11:14:52 2015 UTC,"About a full third of Return of the Crimson Guard is this. I know a lot of people didn't care for that book, but I loved it for the huge detailed battles."

I actually think that RotCG is one of the best books in the entire series including the MBotF novels.  The convergence at the end is unreal and seeing all these legends from the old guard in action is just great fanservice."
Malazan,36xlvw,Fnarley,2,Sat May 23 21:18:09 2015 UTC,"There's a little bit in GotM but it focuses in a lot of other things besides. There really is a lot later throughout the series. I'm with you, I love all of this stuff!"
Malazan,36xlvw,MetaBotch,2,Sat May 23 09:21:39 2015 UTC,Yes! you're going to be in for a huge treat on book 2. the battles in it are amazing and the look into the strategical minds of the leaders is just excellent. most of the other books also include following an army through a period of time through battles and sieges. have fun and enjoy man :)
Malazan,36wva3,wjbc,10,Fri May 22 19:56:21 2015 UTC,"It depends under what context. The Malazan soldier also follows orders, yet as long as they are following orders they are given freedom to think. Also it does depend on the type of warfare. Anything behind enemy lines and with limited support? I'd take the SAS any day. Indeed, I'd take any British regiment over... well, any non-special forces from any other country. Because of the selection process for officers and high training standards, they're simply better.   The Romans had the advantage of being better trained, better disciplined and tactically superior to pretty much everyone else that they faced. The few instances where they got their asses handed to them were in the early days, with Hannibal, who in fact contributed to their becoming a more effective military force. Also, in Teutoburg forest, and in northern Britain - where the legions simply weren't suited to fighting, and got massacred due to ambush by superior numbers."
Malazan,36wva3,i_a1m_to_misbehave,2,Fri May 22 21:27:42 2015 UTC,"Did you know the Russians invented the concept of special forces in WWI?  The problem is, they didn't know what they had invented and didn't do the same on a regular basis.  They were trapped on the Eastern Front without artillery support, so they improvised and sent their best men out to cut barbed wire and kill guards, then attacked without bombardment.  It worked great.  But they didn't duplicate it.  However, the Germans did duplicate it, and eventually taught the Western allies to duplicate it as well."
Malazan,36wva3,i_a1m_to_misbehave,4,Fri May 22 21:37:45 2015 UTC,"I did know this. And the West's special forces may only be duplicates, but they're actually better than the originals."
Malazan,36wva3,Trakend,4,Fri May 22 21:43:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know what history you've been reading, but the Russians were only so effective on the Eastern Front in WWII because they sacrificed millions of their men to get at the Germans. Sure it was obedience, but it wasn't more effective than the American and British troops."

Malazan,36wva3,autowikibot,3,Sat May 23 18:55:37 2015 UTC,"I think you have your Earth military concepts a bit off.   The German military post-Napoleon was/is known for being unusually flexible at the lower levels in terms of interpreting and implementing orders. The Scharnhorst and von Moltke reforms and the other less attributable changes all made the WWII German military astoundingly good at implementing the overall objectives rather than the specific orders. This flexibility was not maintained for the full duration of the world wars, but it certainly made the Germans very difficult to decisively beat on the smaller unit levels until supply and High Command problems rose.   Look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission-type_tactics (Auftragstaktik), the Schlieffen changes and more.   Furthermore, your characterizations of the Greek methods of warfare and Roman methods of warfare are needlessly monolithic and inaccurate. We're talking about tactics and strategies shifting over hundreds of years with those two proto-nations/empires alone.   The WW1 tactics were more complex than artillery fire and hesitation/running. Maneuver warfare was not yet a real thing, but the WW1 strategies and tactics were more robust than stories with a surface look at WW1 gives them. There were trenches, there were mines, there were tunnels and there were people and units who did contradictory/stupid/smart things.   Erikson clearly believes in the superiority of the Malazan marine/mobility combined with the ability to bring astounding amounts of firepower at small points concept, which does involve something more like the German organization and the approach that the US/UK and the Russians eventually adopted and developed even further."
Malazan,36wva3,singul4r1ty,1 point,Tue May 26 18:34:11 2015 UTC,"Mission-type tactics:       Mission-type tactics (German: Auftragstaktik, from Auftrag and Taktik; also known as Mission Command in the US and UK), have (arguably) been a central component of the tactics of German armed forces since the 19th century. The term Auftragstaktik was coined by opponents of the development of mission-type tactics. Opponents of the implementation of mission-type tactics were called Normaltaktiker. In today's German army, the Bundeswehr, the term Auftragstaktik is considered an incorrect characterization of the concept; instead, Führen mit Auftrag (""leading by mission"") is officially used, but the older, unofficial term is more widespread.

Malazan,36wva3,FR05TB1T3,1 point,Tue May 26 18:34:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think the soldiers would be left to think on their own sense - they're trained on how to think rather than how to follow orders. So to use your example, soldiers would have the tactical understanding to accept running towards artillery isn't a bad move, and they would be free to make tactical decisions about what to do rather than blindly running in, especially if there's a better way the higher ups wouldn't see."
Malazan,36wa4z,wjbc,22,Fri May 22 17:23:31 2015 UTC,"I think this is one of the reasons that Malazan works over the long haul where some of the other dark big fat fantasy series bog down. We get moments of levity and joy along with the grim, gritty, it sucks to be alive moments."
Malazan,36wa4z,mgallowglas,9,Fri May 22 17:35:31 2015 UTC,"This. The book had some super sad, heart wrenching moments. As well as just the general messiness of war. But in the face of that the great moments of compassion and overcoming were all the more powerful."

Malazan,36wcp1,Squadz,9,Fri May 22 17:41:50 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming this book was meant to be what happens to Trull Sengar before House of Chains, correct?    Yep. It's also an introduction to the continent of Lether. A lot of time is spent in Lether after MT.   Who exactly is the person that came out of the House of Azath?   He's Silchas Ruin, a Tiste Andii ( although he's hella pale ) soletaken. You saw him being betrayed by Scabandari Bloodeye in the Prologue. He's Anomander Rake's brother.   Mael & Errant are both gods, correct? If this a look to the past, where are Mael & Errant in the future   Yep. They're both still in roughly the same place. Bugg is still undercover as Tehol's manservant, and the Errant is hanging around in Letheras doing his thing.   Probably the most confusing to me - Crippled God exists, and is controlling Withal in his realm until he escapes at the end of the book with the help of Mael. What happens to CG from this point up until HoC? Mael wants to beat him, but can't kill him?   Not much has really happened. The gap between MT and GotM is about five years. The CG is kind of hard to kill, for reasons that are RAFO. One big thing is that Bugg might be opposed if he tried to directly confront the CG. Some gods/ascendants don't want the CG dead."

As for what is happening with CG between the end of MT and the 'present' he has the pannion seer stuff going on and generally running schemes all over the place being a nasty shit."
Malazan,36wcp1,Oathsend,2,Sat May 23 22:31:09 2015 UTC,"No, Withal definitely leaves the beach after he goes and knocks down the CG's tent. Mael brings a boat with him when he turns up so Withal and Sandalath can leave. It's the last page of MT.  But yeah, the CG is dealing with the Pannion Domin and all of his other weaselly stuff."
Malazan,36wcp1,TriscuitCracker,4,Sat May 23 23:06:15 2015 UTC,"Oathsend answered your questions nicely, but if it makes you feel better, I felt confused in the exactly the same way, but on a reread MT was one of my favorite in the whole series.  You are NOT stupid, Erikson's books are like this, they can be confusing with all the multiple plotlines and characters and such.  You are obviously paying attention!  Erikson is not easy and rewards patient reading and attention to detail.  And congratulations for making it thus far because da da da dum...you're at the halfway point! Books 1-5 are actually ""Setup"" for the entire series as a whole. You know how each book has a convergence at the end with epic craziness?  Starting with Bonehunters (back to your Malazan pals still in Seven Cities after the Whirlwind petered out) all plots and subplots (with some new ones) on all continents will slowly ""Converge"" with a capital C over the next few books to culminate in Dust of Dreams and Crippled God. Midnight Tides takes place from before GotM all the way up to HoC, this is correct.   As for Bonehunters...prepare to sweat. You'll see. Glad you're enjoying it!"

I didn't remember a specific part of the books to check when I saw this earlier, so I said nothing, but I just came across a part in the Crippled God where they mention it. (pg. 203, right near the top, but don't check it unless you've read it, there are things at the bottom of that page you do not want to know).   It makes sense, too, since they seem to be neanderthals in all but name. Also, humans are a cross between them and other things, and everything else is taller than humans, so the short genetics have to come from somewhere."

Malazan,36u783,SnowSaur,6,Fri May 22 03:50:45 2015 UTC,"I think it is cotillion releasing kamisod from the crippled body so he can go back to his people, thats just based on the conversation he and shadowthrone had afterward though. I cant remember exactly but i think shadowthrone says something like he understands what cotillion did and approves or something along those lines."
Malazan,36u783,seabasz,4,Fri May 22 04:37:02 2015 UTC,"for me, the fact that when Cotillion stabs the CG and then green flame shoots spiraling into the sky, means that he has released the CG from his body to return to his followers and stop the Jade Giants from obliterating the earth.  If SE had intended that it was just a plain murder then I don't think he would have mentioned the bit about the green flame going into the sky"
Malazan,36u783,hocknose,1 point,Fri May 22 10:32:21 2015 UTC,"If you read Erikson only, straight from Gardens to Crippled, and want to go back to Gardens, I'd interweave Esslemont's books, so:  Gardens of the Moon  Deadhouse Gates  Memories of Ice  House of Chains  Midnight Tides   Night of Knives   The Bonehunters   Return of the Crimson Guard   Reaper's Gale   Stonewielder   Toll the Hounds   Orb Sceptre Throne   Dust of Dreams  The Crippled God   Blood and Bone Assail"
Malazan,36u783,Lankles,1 point,Fri May 22 04:41:28 2015 UTC,"I'd have Crimson Guard and Stonewielder moved down one, and Orb Scepter Thone moved down one or two (happens during DoD/TCG. but people usually don't like splitting that pair up). The majority of Crimson Guard happens after Reaper's Gale."
Malazan,36u783,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Fri May 22 14:34:13 2015 UTC,"Well, first you should probably look into Esslemont's Novels of the Malazan Empire series. Theres 6 of them and the order is:   Night of Knives Return of the Crimson Guard Stonewielder Orb Scepter Throne Blood and Bone Assail   Each one covers a different section of the world that (usually) didn't get much coverage in the main series. The stories are laregly self contained, but they do have enough plots that run through them all to justify calling it a series, and to justify having to read them in the right order.  Other than that there is Erikson's Forge of Darkness, the first book in the Kharkanas Trilogy that takes place thousands of years ago and is about the origins and early days of a lot of the ancient characters. You could read this one before the Esslemont stuff if you want, but since the series isn't done yet, makes more sense to put it after the other books if you ask me.  There is also eventually going to be a prequel trilogy about the Kellanved and Dancer created the empire, and a sequel trilogy following Karsa post TGC. But those are a ways off."
Malazan,36u783,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Fri May 22 06:09:45 2015 UTC,"Some people believe that Cotillion intended to kill tCG, whereas others believe that tCG intended to kill off some gods/ascendants on his way out and Cotillion only forced him to leave. Erikson's official ""stance"" is that it's entirely up to how the reader interprets the event, so it's up to whether you believe Cotillion would take part in killing tCG."
Malazan,36u783,Oathsend,1 point,Fri May 22 08:03:43 2015 UTC,i felt that he assured his and shadowthrones supremacy by collecting cg blood just before he left. therefore in there conversation they are talking about whos most angry with them and that that would be the ones alive. seems to me like they are going on a quest to kill of the remaining ascendants.. i dont know..
Malazan,36u783,Priest_of_Aroo,2,Fri May 22 11:13:06 2015 UTC,"I took it as he released the crippled God from the body holding him in this realm, allowing him to leave and avert the jade giant disaster. The reason other ascendants/gods are upset about that is that some of them were trying to harness parts of kaminsod's body to gain more power."
Malazan,36rbrh,Mryappy,3,Thu May 21 14:35:25 2015 UTC,Very nice! This might seem weird but I really like your clothing detailing.   Now do Greyfrog! With his mouth open and a pair of twitching human legs sticking out lol

Malazan,36sixb,SKR47CH,2,Thu May 21 19:44:13 2015 UTC,"I'd say the Wall in ASoIaF is larger in height, but not in breadth. As for defences? The Night's Watch is comprised of scum and criminals, in the main, and as it's relatively inactive, they see little fighting and thus aren't very reliable. The Stormwall is manned by veterans. In terms of importance... probably equal, as everything would be fucked if they weren't there, but it's hard to tell with different levels of activity.   Also, if you've read the Codex Alera by Jim Butcher or the Drenai saga by David Gemmell, add into that the Shieldwall and Dros Delnoch."
Malazan,36sixb,i_a1m_to_misbehave,1 point,Thu May 21 19:56:37 2015 UTC,"Regarding Stormriders - As far as I have read, they don't seem to be able to survive without the sea. So, what if they just leave the Stormwall, and go up the hill. The Riders can't submerge the whole Island. And even if they can fight on land, I guess the Humans will have an advantage.  Now regarding the Others. We also don't know much about them too, but here also, I think if they reach the desert Dorne, they can't just simply make it cold. We don't know what happens to them when there's no ice/snow."
Malazan,36sixb,i_a1m_to_misbehave,3,Thu May 21 20:40:46 2015 UTC,"Well, the Stormriders might just destroy the landmass and advance the sea. It'd be pretty easy, freezing and thawing to crack the rock, then just disperse it in the ocean.   With regard to the Others? They probably could just make it cold, similar to the Icemen in the Codex Alera (which, if you haven't read, do so)."
Malazan,36sixb,Silcha,2,Thu May 21 20:43:50 2015 UTC,The Stormriders can just flood the land. The Stormwall holds back the sea as well as the Stormriders

Malazan,36nv0m,ArchVangarde,3,Wed May 20 20:44:14 2015 UTC,"I just started working my way through The Black Company, it's like a trip back into one of the squads."
Malazan,36nv0m,jswens,2,Wed May 20 23:10:48 2015 UTC,"I saw this recommended a lot, so read the first three (combined into one book), and felt pretty meh about them.  Not sure why, maybe the point of view format, maybe the writing style, maybe the characters, but I never felt as pulled in."
Malazan,36nv0m,thekuch1144,1 point,Thu May 21 13:15:42 2015 UTC,"Erikkson vs Cook-   Errikkson has so much in the way of worldbuilding its unreal. The magic is much higher fantasy while still gritty and real. And his endings are so beautiful, he practically invented the perfect climax for really complicated plots.  Cook, though, writes from a single point of view. Its raw, gritty and real. The thoughts of real soldiers. It resonates really well with actual soldiers too, because of the perfect capture of soldier humor and fatalism. Its vietnam war style fantasy. Really weird and hard to rationalize, but overall so much different than standard fare."
Malazan,36nv0m,ArchVangarde,2,Thu May 21 13:47:48 2015 UTC,"I guess I should have also said that while it didn't do it for me, I can absolutely see why it keeps popping up as recommended after Malazan as a gritty, dark, military minded fantasy series."
Malazan,36nv0m,thekuch1144,1 point,Thu May 21 18:16:58 2015 UTC,"Definitely recommend, reading through it right now. The world's not quite as big as in Malazan, but the squad based story and dark humor is all there. It's pretty fantastic."
Malazan,36nv0m,crossfire87,6,Thu May 21 04:58:30 2015 UTC,Have you tried wheel of time? Kinda long and drags at a few points but good overall

Malazan,36nv0m,SageOfTheWise,6,Wed May 20 19:30:55 2015 UTC,"I just recently finished the Acts of Caine series, I highly recommend it. It's a kind of fantasy/scifi hybrid series. I'm going to steal the wikipedia description to give a good quick premise of the series:   The novels are set in a future dystopia Earth where a parallel world called Overworld reminiscent of the worlds featured in post-Tolkien fantasy has been discovered. The corporations that run Earth send actors into Overworld in order to provide the masses of an overcrowded world with virtual-reality entertainment.   I'll keep this vague for spoiler reasons, but a few things really made the series stand out for me. First is how incredibly distinct each book in the series stylistically (and bonus points for book 2 being stylistically the most similar thing to Malazan I've ever read). Each one ends up being a refreshing change of pace from what you were reading previously. The dynamic between two of the main characters in this series is incredibly interesting and possibly the most unique I've ever read in fantasy. And the last book is one of the most brilliant books I've ever read, it's written as one huge nonlinear puzzle. It's one of those books I'd except places like /r/fantasy to obsess over constantly to the point its almost a joke(like the Malazan series), I'm honestly surprised how little it's been talked about."
Malazan,36nv0m,mmSNAKE,2,Wed May 20 19:38:57 2015 UTC,"It's a series that needs a good deal of input and thought to figure out. Especially Caine's Law. However once it clicks and everything is put in it's place, it's just amazing.  I loved everything about these books, from the detailed and extremely violent action, to it's social commentaries and philosophy of said violence, power, domination, control, free will and so forth.  Caine resonated with me, more so than any other character I've read about.  These books generally are not widespread. Outside of the first book, people lose interest because like you say, each book is so different than all the others. I speak out about these books as much as it applies but again, they are not very well known.  I really like Scott Lynch's review of Blade of Tyshalle. He puts it better in words than I can.  In general this series is not only absolutely superb on action, suspense and excitement front, it also is an intellectual ride that explores so much that I can only urge people to read it and see."
Malazan,36nv0m,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Fri May 22 03:12:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think I've ever been so excited and just generally giddy for an entire book as I was with Caine's Law. Took like 50 pages to understand what the book was doing, but then I fell so instantly in love with the concept and it was just pulled off near flawlessly from start to finish."
Malazan,36nv0m,mmSNAKE,1 point,Fri May 22 03:27:37 2015 UTC,"Same. Was pure joy to read that book. Caine spelling out why he is as he is. Then that finish. Picture perfect finish.   Oh also if you didn't, check out the audiobooks. They are outstanding. It was a bit strange for Caine to have such a deep voiced and distinct narrator but it fit so well.   Any fucking questions?"
Malazan,36nv0m,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Fri May 22 03:34:17 2015 UTC,"I did listen to the audiobooks a lot actually! When I read I have a physical copy for at home, and the audio copy for the car. I thought the narrator was perfect for this series, but I guess it helps that I heard Caine's voice as really low from the beginning. He managed a really good female voice for such a deep voiced narrator as well.  Funnily enough, only audiobooks I can think of that sound even better are Scott Lynch's Gentleman Bastard books."
Malazan,36nv0m,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Fri May 22 06:04:21 2015 UTC,"I actually read the first two books in that series. Loved the first book, and enjoyed the second, but the whole stuff about the gods, especially of the modern world, kind of put me off.  I'll definitely check out the next ones."
Malazan,36nv0m,TriscuitCracker,2,Wed May 20 19:41:29 2015 UTC,"If you mean the Blind God stuff, yeah I had a bit of a hard time figuring out what exactly that all was in book 2. Like how real or how metaphorical that whole thing was supposed to be. Its only a minor aspect of the last 2 books, and when it comes up its better explained."
Malazan,36nv0m,stanglemeir,5,Wed May 20 20:30:29 2015 UTC,"I'm in the middle of the Powder Mage Trilogy by Brian McClellan. Sort of a mix of Mistborn and Abercrombie.  Mixes magic with flintlock pistols and the like. A military coup of a king sets in motion forces that could destroy everything, also the returned gods walk the earth, though no civilized person believes that nonsense...but they should.  Good characters, it's pretty straightforward fantasy like Sanderson and approaches the gore levels of Abercrombie at times.  Or you may like the First Law series by Joe Abercrombie."
Malazan,36nv0m,anointed9,3,Wed May 20 21:00:47 2015 UTC,"Powder Mage Trilogy was excellent. I made the mistake of reading the first book before the other two came out, McClellan can write a hell of a cliffhanger.  The First Law is also amazing. It's much more mundane than most fantasy I like but the story and characters are what really sets it apart."
Malazan,36nv0m,Nightender,6,Wed May 20 21:06:42 2015 UTC,Have you tried the black company? It influences the experience on MBOTF quite a bit I think.
Malazan,36nv0m,TriscuitCracker,4,Wed May 20 21:00:19 2015 UTC,"Try out The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe.  It's technically sci-fi, but it acts a lot more like fantasy.  It's dark, challenging, and unlike anything else."
Malazan,36nv0m,Nightender,1 point,Wed May 20 21:12:47 2015 UTC,One of the more unique series I've ever read.
Malazan,36nv0m,toke81,1 point,Wed May 20 21:37:45 2015 UTC,Unique is almost an understatement.
Malazan,36nv0m,Nightender,1 point,Thu May 21 03:12:23 2015 UTC,Almost done with Citadel of the Autarch. I finished MBOTF about a month ago and this is the first sci fi/fantasy I've read since. Amazing....definitely gonna have to re read them.
Malazan,36nv0m,TOGTOGTOGTOGTOG,2,Wed May 20 22:25:30 2015 UTC,Wolfe lends himself to re-reading more than most authors. There's one hidden bit of history that is hinted at later in the series; it changes how the reader looks at some of Severian's interactions.
Malazan,36nv0m,Storm-Of-Aeons,3,Thu May 21 03:14:53 2015 UTC,Sir Terry Pratchett's stuff is amazing. World building of a different sort but just as interesting. And not to mention you'll be laughing so much people will think you've gone crazy.
Malazan,36nv0m,Storm-Of-Aeons,2,Thu May 21 00:12:27 2015 UTC,What other books have you read? What did you enjoy about them? Wouldn't want to recommend things you have already read.
Malazan,36nv0m,wjbc,1 point,Wed May 20 19:19:39 2015 UTC,I threw an edit into my original post answering that.  Thanks!
Malazan,36nv0m,wjbc,2,Wed May 20 19:27:28 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend The Broken Empire trilogy by Mark Lawrence, he also has another trilogy with 2 books out so far(or soon to be out I don't remember the release date). He is an amazing author. Anathem by Neal Stephenson is more scifi but still one of my favorite books. Chronicles of the Necromancer by Gail Z Martin is good. Not up their with Erikson and Rothfuss, but they are very entertaining books with an interesting new take on necromancers. Also The Demon Cycle by Peter V Brett is a very good series."
Malazan,36nv0m,MarquisHalimOndore,2,Thu May 21 17:56:46 2015 UTC,"Ever try some historical fiction from the days when warriors really did use swords?  Try Bernard Cornwell's Warrior Chronicles or Saxon Stories, starting with The Last Kingdom.  There are eight books in the series.  You may know Cornwell as the author of the Sharpe Series, set in the Napoleonic Wars.  The books I'm recommending are closer to fantasy, although they are firmly grounded in the real world.  But like many fantasy books, they follow the adventures of a sword-wielding barbarian."
Malazan,36nv0m,wjbc,2,Wed May 20 19:46:15 2015 UTC,That sounds awesome. I love history.
Malazan,36nv0m,i_a1m_to_misbehave,2,Wed May 20 19:59:04 2015 UTC,"It has much of the warrior vibe of Malazan, magnified by the fact that they can't use munitions or magic to get themselves out of a tight spot.  There's also an interesting tension between the rise of Christianity and the stubborn paganism of the central character -- who nevertheless for complicated reasons finds himself defending Christians, who hate him because he refuses to convert."

Malazan,36nv0m,0haymai,1 point,Fri May 22 09:55:38 2015 UTC,"Sure! Haha.  1: Lord of the Rings, and the Silmarillion. Pretty much one of the absolute greatest stories ever told.  2: Malazan and GOT.  A Storm of Swords in GOT is by far one of the absolutely greatest books I've ever read.  3: Dresden Files by Jim Butcher.  They're about a wizard who acts as a detective in modern day Chicago.  Great series, alot of fun and an easy read.  4: Kingkiller Trilogy.  It isn't finished yet, but its beautifully written with a fantastic story. 5: A Wheel of Time.  Its about as far away from Malazan as you can get in terms of fantasy.  High fantasy, where the heroes are absolute heroes and the villains are villains. 6: Stormlight Archive, and Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson. 7: Codex Alera by Jim Butcher.  Imagine Lost Roman Legion meets Pokemon then about a 100 times cooler. 8: The Night Angel Trilogy by Brent Weeks.  Its about a street urchin who becomes an assassin.  Absolutely loved it.  Brent Weeks other series The Lightbringer Series is also great 9: Lies of Locke Lamora.   I've read a lot more than these over the years, but these are the ones that have stuck out over the years.   Hope this helps!"
Malazan,36mtob,xolsiion,7,Wed May 20 15:17:26 2015 UTC,"The Lord of Light card did not represent the demon, no. It didn't represent anything in GotM, actually, but will become more significant later on.   The Azath house wasn't precisely foreshadowed. It's not just a ""and then something ate the baddie and all was well"" thing, it's significant, and in ways that aren't immediately apparent in GotM. It was a specific reaction to the maelstrom of magic due to the Jaghut Tyrant.  It's implied-to that yes, it is Burn that is being caused pain, as Raest was buried underground, and within her.   The Crimson Guard stopped Anomander's assassin because Caladan Brood isn't a bloodthirsty monster, and assumed things would go his way without assassination. Anomander is rather more... remote, and doesn't leave things up to chance. The Coin Bearer was an unknown quantity, and Lorn wanted to remove the influence of luck, as without luck, the balance was less likely to be skewed either in favour of Raest or Anomander, and therefore the outcome would more likely be mutual destruction, which was Lorn's plan. While Brood may command the Crimson Guard in battle, they are actually loyal to Prince K'azz D'avore, who hates the Malazan Empire, and thus would oppose them at every turn - thus why Blues saved Crokus.   The soul-shifting occurred by K'rul's design as both Tattersail and Bellurdan were engulfed by Tattersail's full unleashing of her Thyr warren. The presence of Tool's own Tellann presence made it unstable, and so it killed them both. K'rul being an Elder God... well, he does what he wants.   Yes, the four black dragons were Soletaken. They may or may not have been the mage assassins, but they were certainly Tiste Andii. Anomander Rake is also a Soletaken. Silanah is not. She is a true Eleint; a dragon that cannot change form."
Malazan,36mtob,i_a1m_to_misbehave,2,Wed May 20 16:19:17 2015 UTC,"The Azath house wasn't precisely foreshadowed.    It wasn't foreshadowed at all, and it's a flaw with book one in the series.  Yes, after book two it makes sense, but in book one it comes out of nowhere.   The soul-shifting occurred by K'rul's design...   I don't think K'rul was involved in the initial soulshifting into Nightchill's body, but only in the later soulshifting into an unborn child's body."

Malazan,36mtob,i_a1m_to_misbehave,1 point,Wed May 20 17:11:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know how it could involve spoilers if we are talking about foreshadowing in book one.  I'm just saying that GotM, as a self-contained book, without looking to any other books for explanations, is flawed.  Erikson recovers nicely and gave us a great series, but my understanding is that most people agree book one is the weakest book in the series.  And everyone comments on the Azath coming out of nowhere, particularly because there's such a build up about Raest."
Malazan,36mtob,wjbc,4,Wed May 20 17:16:01 2015 UTC,"The Azath not being foreshadowed isn't a flaw of the book in a long view, it is just a flaw because new readers might be put off by it. It fits in perfectly with the general scheme of ""things happen and you learn why later"".   As an entire story, it doesn't need to be foreshadowed because GotM is not self-contained and was never meant to be self-contained.  Almost none of the story in any of the books makes sense if you don't put off your questions until later books. Even other series have this happen. GotM has a lot of flaws, but he does not ""recover"" from his ""lack"" of foreshadowing.  It isn't necessary."

Coming off of finishing the first book I don't think I agree here.  It seems, based on what I've got as answers so far, that I was correct in thinking that the word ""Azath"" doesn't show up until the last 10th of the book.  And it's the solution the the problem of Raest.  It's a different type of ""left hanging"" than me not knowing much about Warrens, or about Ascendants, or Tiste Andii, or T'lan Imass.  Those things were throughout the book and I know I have things to learn yet about them.  The Azath just kinda ""poofed"" into existence right there at the end and I was left with a WTF face that lead to my question.  I have no doubt I'll need learn more about Azath and all the rest so, yes, I can see it being the same in that way...but this thing was NOT part of the story like all the rest of the converging elements.  Even with the Crimson Guard thing I had a rough understanding of who they were because they'd been mentioned a couple times earlier in the book."
Malazan,36mtob,TheBananaKing,4,Wed May 20 18:31:16 2015 UTC,"There's an important difference between deus ex machina and being blindsided, though.   If the Azath just disappeared and were never mentioned again - yes, that'd be a cheap DEM, and I hate those.   But what's happened here is that one of the major players just surfaced suddenly and without telegraphing its moves ahead.   Think of Spike showing up and casually frying The Annoying One in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. A whole plotline just casually clipped off with no warning? How cheap is tha... Oh. Oho.  Some things you don't see coming - and it's only in hindsight that you get their full impact."
Malazan,36mtob,TocTheEternal,1 point,Thu May 21 00:58:11 2015 UTC,"Points for the Buffy reference. :)  I think I'd modify the metaphor slightly because Raest was actually more like the big bad of an entire season.  To me it would be more like Buffy is all geared up to fight the Master in the season finale and then suddenly poof Spike shows up and kills him out of nowhere and without breaking a sweat.  Sure, Spike is a big part of the next season and we learn more about him - but it's still this completely unknown guy resolving the major plotline of the season.  Is it Deus Ex Machina?  I'd say no because by the end of the book one hopefully trusts/understands that Erikson has a plan for everything.  Just caused a bit of confusion is all.  Within the context of the single book or single season I wasn't a fan of how it was handled, but it's certainly not enough to turn me off.  There are far too many other open-ended things that I know I'll find out about later."
Malazan,36mtob,wjbc,1 point,Thu May 21 12:22:00 2015 UTC,"It is true that the Azath is not introduced until it becomes relevant, and that it takes a pivotal role in the climax. But this is not entirely uncommon in later books, to one degree or another, and I think that people tend to just take these things in stride by then.  Again, GotM is in no sense a standalone book, it is by necessity the introduction to a lot of things. I guess that Erikson might have been able to include something about the Azath earlier in the book to at least familiarize the reader with the name and general presentation of the things, but on the other hand it would have been much more forced than most of his exposition."
Malazan,36mtob,cantlurkanymore,1 point,Wed May 20 18:45:17 2015 UTC,"But this is not entirely uncommon in later books, to one degree or another   I can't think of any other examples in DG or MoI, which is as far as I've gotten so far.  PM me or use a spoiler tag if you can think of a similar example from those books."
Malazan,36mtob,TocTheEternal,2,Wed May 20 18:51:50 2015 UTC,"the azath is foreshadowed however, it's just extremely light. i can't remember who, (i think rallick) but someone plants an acorn in the back garden of colls, which later grows into the stone block that rallick is then able to inhibit because of the otataral he rubs on himself. it's hard to follow, and connecting the dots from such disconnected scenes is a tough job, but it is there. perhaps the lack of more direct foreshadowing is a flaw, but there is some foreshadowing."
Malazan,36mtob,autowikiabot,2,Wed May 20 20:49:53 2015 UTC,I don't really know that I'd consider that foreshadowing. That comes basically at the end of the book and isn't really early enough to be considered hinting as much as details of what is actually occurring.
Malazan,36mtob,cantlurkanymore,1 point,Wed May 20 20:58:55 2015 UTC,The only acorn I remembered was the Finnest?  http://malazan.wikia.com/wiki/Finnest

Malazan,36mtob,TocTheEternal,1 point,Wed May 20 20:58:37 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure that's it, and lorn actually planted it there to draw raest. The azath popped up there because of all the power gathering. RAFO for more on the nature of the azath.  Either way, all this occurs in the last book so it does make the azath seem to come out of nowhere.   In his more experienced years SE may have shown better how integral the azath are to the world but as it is it's not really evident just how intertwined with the story the azath are. There are none active on genebackis before the Daru house so that's kind of an excuse but not really since the first few scenes are all in the empire and one is in the same city as the Deadhouse :p"
Malazan,36mtob,wjbc,1 point,Wed May 20 21:42:15 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree.  There's a huge amount of build up around Raest, this isn't just some minor plot point.  And I've seen many first time readers complain about the Azath.  The fact that it's explained later does not change that -- it's a swift recovery in book two, but book one is still flawed.  Even Erikson's fans mostly agree that book one is the weakest of the ten in the main series, and this is the biggest flaw in it.  Similarly, the biggest flaw in The Lord of the Rings is Tom Bombadil.  Everyone knows it, everyone complains about it.  That doesn't make the trilogy any less awesome, and there are even some things I love about Bombadil.  But I'm not going to call him flawless.  I love the Malazan series.  But I tolerate the failure to foreshadow the Azath in GotM.  Re-reading your comment, I agree that it is a flaw ""because new readers might be put off by it.""  But I don't agree that putting off new readers is somehow unimportant."
Malazan,36mtob,ChaosBrat,2,Wed May 20 18:21:03 2015 UTC,"I explicitly said that ""GotM has a lot of flaws"", I was not calling him flawless, so I don't know where that last sentence is coming from.  And yes, I know that it is off-putting to new readers, but it isn't a flaw in the story. A lot of new readers are put off by the whole concept of being dropped into the world without explanation and having to fill in the details often times books later. That is a structural and stylistic choice, not an objective flaw. Not everyone is going to like the books, and there's nothing wrong with that.  The more ""objective"" flaws would be the clumsy introduction of some characters, certain plot inconsistencies with the later books, and some pacing failures. Things that could be fixed without having to change the principles that the story was written with, just improvements in the actual writing itself.  The fact that many readers don't like the way that the Azath is just dropped in there to be explored later isn't a ""flaw"" in the story, it is just the nature that a lot of people don't like that structure or don't want to have to trust that the author will make sense of it later on before investing more into the series."
Malazan,36mtob,wjbc,1 point,Wed May 20 18:29:55 2015 UTC,"We at least agree that it puts off new readers.  Perhaps I think it's more singular than you; I found it the single most off-putting part of GotM, by far.   And it could have easily been fixed with just a little foreshadowing, that's what foreshadowing is all about, and Erikson clearly knows how to do it in other contexts.    Even if I don't catch the foreshadowing the first time around, I appreciate catching it the second time around.  But there's absolutely nothing hinting at the Azath."
Malazan,36mtob,i_a1m_to_misbehave,4,Wed May 20 18:39:53 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why foreshadowing is necessary.  Is there a particular point beyond which introducing anything new in the first book of a series (in which by definition, everything is new) is a flaw in the writing?  I suppose I could understand thinking of the Azath as a deus ex machina, but only if GotM was a standalone book.    It's true that Erikson gets better in his later books at establishing the threads of convergence early on, but given the staggering impact of the Azath, I feel like it was an apt way to shock the reader, especially one new to the world.  I don't know if that was the purpose, but that was the way I received it."
Malazan,36mtob,notaswedishchef,1 point,Wed May 20 20:01:55 2015 UTC,"I suppose I could understand thinking of the Azath as a deus ex machina, but only if GotM was a standalone book.   That's precisely the problem, and he doesn't do the same in books 1 or 2.  It's one thing to create cliffhangers, it's another to pull in something completely new and never discussed at the end of the book to deal with the biggest baddie in the whole book.  My understanding is that GotM was written years before the rest of the series, and that Erikson learned a lot before he wrote DG, having written several other books in between.  One of the things he seems to have learned is the importance of foreshadowing."
Malazan,36mtob,wjbc,1 point,Wed May 20 21:22:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clearing some of that stuff up.  Everything you're saying makes sense, and the differences between Brood and Rake you're describing really flesh out my understanding."
Malazan,36mtob,wjbc,1 point,Wed May 20 18:33:41 2015 UTC,"The further you progress through the series, the more you get to understand. GotM has a couple little discrepancies with the rest of the series, but it ties in and things start a bit more sense"
Malazan,36mtob,notaswedishchef,2,Wed May 20 18:40:03 2015 UTC,"Some answers I can give. I forget about the reading, hopefully someone else can help.  The Azath house was a bit out of the blue, however you quickly learn that it isn't a cop out on Erikson's part but the world just has big gods and then big scary things that eat gods. Azath houses usually end up where important things happen, Darujistan  ends up being important throughout the books.   Burn is the world, so in some of our creation myths the world is created from the body of a god or titan, sometimes the being is dead other stories will have the being alive. Burn is a sleeping goddess, she just happens to be home to a bunch of races. If she awakes it's eluded that everyone will die.   Brood and Rake are good friends, Rake commands the tiste andi  while brood commands the rivi and kind of the Crimson guard. Brood tends to sit back and react to things, Rake is much more proactive. Rake hunts the assassin's guild because he knows at some point they will be trouble, the coin and crokus are like a turning point. Brood thinks no matter how it turns he can come out on top. Meanwhile rake doesn't want any chance (hehe get it?) that things could go wrong, so he wants to get this turning point out of the way so that his plans will be exact.  So while it's a cool skill the anti magic aura that tool has kinda gets retconned I even forgot that can happen. However you can kind of understand what happens but it's confusing. All of those dreams that are a man (kruul) and the fat man (kruppe) answer it. In the malazan world most magic deadening happens to the human warrens, they are newer and weaker than the elder warrens. Kruul is an old god, he uses the old much stronger magic that is not affected by magic deadening. Soul shifting is an elder magic, plus,what tattersail  becomes is very important later on, not just book wise but in the later universe what she becomes is needed, kruul sees this so when the opportunity to pick a mage that is kind and loving to ascend to this next role he provides the source of power for tattersail.  Kinda makes you wonder how Lorn felt,here she is safe from magic and a huge magical explosion happens near her, which can only mean an old god just stepped into the game.    Silanah is an actual dragon, I think the others who fight raest are too. Dragons are kinda rare at this point, that's why raest asks why these rare and very powerful creatures would bother bowing to Rake. Rake and some tiste andi are indeed soletaken, when rake fights the demon he assumes his dragon form but he is tiste andi first and foremost."
Malazan,36mtob,wjbc,2,Wed May 20 15:48:50 2015 UTC,"The Azath house was a bit out of the blue, however you quickly learn that it isn't a cop out on Erikson's part but the world just has big gods and then big scary things that eat gods.   The Azath house came totally out of the blue, and we don't understand why until the next book, Deadhouse Gates.  It's a flaw with book one, I judge, although Erikson recovers nicely in book two."

Is Burn really the world?  That threw me a bit because the time-keeping has the ""Xth year of Burn's Sleep"" so I kinda had the impression she was an ascendant that had, at one point, been awake and kicking like Shadowthrone...I assumed the world was older than the 1,xxx something years she's been sleeping...maybe I just need to wait and see."
Malazan,36mtob,wjbc,1 point,Wed May 20 18:36:54 2015 UTC,"Is Burn really the world?  ...  ...maybe I just need to wait and see.   Yes, wait and see, it's explained in book three, Memories of Ice."
Malazan,36mtob,i_a1m_to_misbehave,1 point,Wed May 20 18:52:45 2015 UTC,"So we never get hard proof of burn being awake. There is apart of her aspect, or mind, that is awake and wanders around. However the idea is she's a giant sleeping goddess that everyone inhabits."
Malazan,36llnr,wezzboy123,11,Wed May 20 07:56:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm about half way through the series and there are definitely times when I've started a new book and gone ""okay, I remember this dude but have no how he got here...""  However, with the bigger 'behind-the-scenes' kind of stuff, in terms of what is going on in the world as a whole and so on, I've actually found there tend to be enough reminders to keep you on top of things. I've no doubt I'm missing a lot though.  Lastly, I've found the folk on this sub to be super friendly / helpful, so just stick up a post if you want a recap on something specific!"
Malazan,36llnr,nodogbadbiscuit,5,Wed May 20 08:26:58 2015 UTC,"I had the exact same experience. I am not a super fast reader, and between that, my job, and normal boring daily responsibilities it took me about a year to finish this series. So there were definitely fuzzy details on some plot lines by the time I got to the end. I would not say this hampered my experience too much, however. In fact, it makes me want to reread the series.  There were several times when I went to the Malazan wiki to clarify something in these type of situations.  DO NOT do this. There are spoilers everywhere, and many of them are unmarked. I spoiled some truly amazing moments from doing that, so stay away from there.  If you feel you have read a particularly dense chapter, I would head over to the Tor Reread and read the recap to make sure you didn't miss anything. I found that the commentary by Amanda was always good to read; she caught on to a lot more than I did on her first pass through the series, but there are no spoilers here as she has not read the series before. I would stay away from Bill's commentary, however.  And lastly, there is a Malazan group on Goodreads that did a group read and posted individual spoiler-free chapter summaries. I have found that the Tor reread posts a point-by-point retelling of the events of the chapter, whereas the Goodreads group read generally posts a more concise summary of the chapter. They each have their own strengths."

I've found the 'search' feature really helps, since you can look up terms/people that have been mentioned throughout the book. I think that if you highlight the word, and use 'search>all text' it looks up all the times it is mentioned in all the Malazan books you have on your Kindle."
Malazan,36llnr,nodogbadbiscuit,2,Wed May 20 17:30:24 2015 UTC,"I am reading on Kindle, but hadn't seen that you can search by highlighting! Useful tip :)   I do find having the dramatis personae bookmarked very useful too, although sadly the maps don't work so well."

At least in the early books, each one was kind of self-contained enough that it didn't matter. Each book had its own conclusion and I could stop reading when school got heavy.

We'll let you figure out which are which as you read the rest of the series.  Something to remember is that Erikson writes with voice in mind. Each story told is told by someone, to someone, from a certain point of view. This is not a story told by an omnipresent reliable narrator."
Malazan,36jkpg,somedude2012,2,Wed May 20 14:00:54 2015 UTC,"This is not a story told by an omnipresent reliable narrator.   Right, I did comment on that when I said the rewrite worked.  I'm still convinced it was a rewrite of fictional history, but it worked because the original narrators weren't trustworthy anyway.  Also, there's a lot of deception going on, Erikson's world is full of liars or characters who simply choose not to reveal all they know.  And there's misdirection from the author, as well.  He loves to play with our expectations and confound them."
Malazan,36jkpg,OvidNaso,3,Wed May 20 14:23:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the write ups.  I really enjoy revisiting the books through your writings.  Being half way through TCG as well, there is so much I have not thought about in a while.  I can't wait to do a second read through after completing the series.  Knowing what I do now will surely give a much different perspective on certain characters and situations."

I wasn't necessarily blown away by the first two books; instead I was very intrigued and wanted to see if the series really grabbed me in. I'm about 400 pages into MoI and it's developing into something I think is outstanding."

Memories of Ice has some significant info dumps, unlike the previous two books. I think the whole project of making the reader wrap his head around what is going on leads to this effect."

Malazan,36gz5t,BorealHound,2,Tue May 19 21:49:27 2015 UTC,"It plays more like Civilization than Sins.   Best part about Galciv3 are the absolutely huge map sizes that make for really deep games. That and the ship editor.   Battles are not real time. Just animations whose outcomes are determined by stats. Sort of like Endless Space, which is another great game if you like the genre."

Malazan,36gz5t,BorealHound,1 point,Tue May 19 22:07:01 2015 UTC,How does it compare to GalCiv 2? I liked that game but felt like it was a little clunky.  Especially conquest.
Malazan,36gz5t,Xalimata,0,Mon May 25 07:15:28 2015 UTC,"Very similar to GalCiv2. I'd almost go so far as to call this a heavily modded GalCiv2. There isn't any conquest animation, just your ship invading then a screen detailing the results.   The ship builder is as fun as ever with a lot more versatility in how you build your ship. If you can imagine it you can build it. I still wish they gave you control over part shaders, that's my only complaint really.   I think it takes a step back from GalCiv2 in that you don't really have as good a picture of your fleet stats and there needs to be expanded UI options in how to sort and manage your units.   The space battles are disappointing. They need better artists or something over at Stardock. Also, the camera controls suck.   The economy is very intuitive to manage, however you can't mine asteroids anymore. Now there are resources around the galaxy that you can capture with a mining starbase instead. Planets route production to shipyards you place down in the same way you do starbases.   It's still rough around the edges, but I've spent memorial day weekend on just one game with about 20 factions and an absurdly large galaxy. Hundreds of planets and stars. It makes for really interesting wars and strategy. Time flies for me when playing this game, so I'd recommend it."

Malazan,36hqmt,wjbc,6,Tue May 19 15:20:46 2015 UTC,"The incredible part is, you get introduced to more and more characters throughout the series. And rather than killing them off, as does GRRM, Erikson just sort of... drops them off slightly at various points.   And brings them back. You get to greet old friends again, and fall in love all over. It's incredible."
Malazan,36hqmt,i_a1m_to_misbehave,2,Tue May 19 16:12:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm loving Erikson's writing style. I loved the Song of Ice and Fire novels, but I was tired of waiting around for the new releases. I am in love with the Malazan series and GRRM's novels aren't even a thought in my mind anymore."
Malazan,36hqmt,i_a1m_to_misbehave,3,Tue May 19 16:19:31 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I was never especially enamoured with A Song of Ice and Fire. The first book, I thought was awful. The others were merely ""Meh."" I'd heard lots of things about this series, and was really blown away. Erikson's world-building isn't quite as immense in scope and complexity as Tolkien's (who was a linguist, and spent decades on it besides), but it's still pretty incredible."

So throughout my entire read through, I was expecting something sad to occur. I don't know if this was a good thing or a bad thing.   But as I was reading through DG, I thought the most emotional parts were Mappo and Icarium. They have such a strong friendship, but it's such destined to end tragically (I assume?).   Two immortal (or very, very long living?) people. One that is essentially a parole officer, and the other that is incredibly dangerous but has a very short term memory.   I was getting sad when Mappo was carrying Icarium to the Deadhouse."

Malazan,36ir18,ep777,4,Tue May 19 18:11:51 2015 UTC,"Let's look at how the series ends first. Tavore PARAN frees the crippled god as part of Shadowthrone's plans. Turns out she was associated with the Talons all along.  Now let's look at how it beings.  Shadowthrone and Cotillion release the hounds and who's investigating? Who ends up getting drawn into work for Laseen? Ganoes Paran.  When Lorn ends up dead and Ganoes is ""outlawed"" who does Laseen conveniently end up making the adjunct? Tavore...  I don't think the releasing of the hounds was specifically for revenge. It was to force Laseen's hand to do something. It was an event she would feel the need to cover up, but be too big to easily cover up. It was an event that threw many other things in motion.  Don't forget Shadowthrone always plays the long game.   The part that probably was NOT forseen was Oponn getting mixed up in the whole thing. I'm certain  later plans had to be adjusted and improvised because of that."
Malazan,36ir18,Dwolf63,2,Wed May 20 00:46:12 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think that is what was happening here, there are 'private'* conversations between shadowthrone and cotillion where they make it clear that they wish to depose Laseen of the throne she didn't earn.  They don't hint towards any wider plan where they are forcing her to act for some greater good it's clearly a revenge mission, it's not a 'we need to force laseen to shuffle her deck' it's a 'we need to get rid of laseen'  *ok not strictly private but the people who are present (sorry and paran) are not expected to ever have the opportunity to share what they have heard."
Malazan,36ir18,Fnarley,1 point,Thu May 21 13:56:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah except in NoK, it's made abundantly clear that they orchestrated the whole thing anyways. They wanted Laseen to do what she did.   It's probably just another one of those GotM-isms that either got changed or clarified in the rest of the books."
Malazan,36ir18,CowDefenestrator,4,Thu May 21 20:14:03 2015 UTC,"Shadowthrone and Cotillion always seemed MUCH darker to me in GotM than in any other book. I couldn't picture the Cotillion (or even Shadowthrone, really) in any of the other books even considering slaughtering an entire village for some slight political gain.  I honestly think that Erikson was still in the works of hammering out his characters and plot. Which is fine, there was a lot to hammer out."
Malazan,36ir18,BorealHound,2,Tue May 19 21:52:08 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling that this is proleptic irony on Erikson's part - at the time it appears that their main goal is killing Laseen, but later, you realise that their ""main goal"" actually is not that, and they're just after power.   On the other hand, you may be right."
Malazan,36ir18,i_a1m_to_misbehave,1 point,Tue May 19 18:17:39 2015 UTC,"This could just be a GotMism (as a discrepancy between the first book and the rest due to the gap between the writing of the first and the rest is known on the ME forums). It's generally accepted that some pieces of Erikson's plot and details of the setting, characters, etc changed because of the long time between GotM and DG.   On the other hand, it could have something to do with the fact that as the King and Assassin of House Shadow (which focuses a lot on misdirection, lies, etc), Shadowthrone and Cotillion's plot could be a feint in the first book."
Malazan,36ir18,eclipse350,1 point,Wed May 20 00:34:44 2015 UTC,Shadowthrone and Cotillion's plot could be a feint in the first book   But if it was a feint then why when they are alone don't they describe it as such?
Malazan,36ir18,Fnarley,1 point,Thu May 21 13:57:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't know, I was just trying to think of any possibility other than this discrepancy just being Erikson changing the plot before the second book, but yeah, it probably is just a GotMism"
Malazan,36hr7i,ep777,5,Tue May 19 14:04:03 2015 UTC,"You just answered that one question - he manifested in front of them IN CHAINS.  Let's break it down.  The Crippled God crashes to the world in pieces. Some parts of him/his magic are carried off by the great ravens. Whether because he's in great agony and causing grief, or just because it's convenient, the various pieces of him are chained as they are discovered.  So we have little bits of his spirit all over the world, all magically chained. At this point the CG is mostly a spiritual/energy manifestation as his flesh is broken, so the chains exist on some sort of other plane, possibly making them less susceptible to the effects of Otataral. If nothing else, one would have to find and break each set of chains separately with sufficient otataral for each. As it took an entire Otataral dragon to break the final chains this just might not have been practical.  If the chains had initially been holding him in spirit form, then even after his body assembles, if he's just killed right then, the CHAINS WOULD JUST KEEP ON HOLDING ON TO HIS SPIRIT and we'd be right back to square one.  In fact, because his physical heart could be moved to the mound, the chains weren't to hold the actual physical pieces of him in place they were to bind his energy.  So he was reassembled, with as many pieces of him as possible - as more of his spirit gets drawn in one could assume all these chains from the various chainings are all brought together in one place.    They are also forced to manifest on the physical plane, rendering them more vulnerable to Otataral's negating effects.  The dragon only has to fly to one location minimizing the damage she would otherwise have done.  The chains have to break - but now we have another problem. His physical form can't fly up to his followers, so his followers are going to come raining down to reunite with him.  And so  Cotillion now frees his spirit from his physical body by killing him - after the chains are broken - so he can ascend to his followers leaving his broken mortal coil behind.  It had to happen in a certain order.   Why did Cotillion do it from behind?  That part isn't easily guessed.  Could be he just couldn't bear to look the CG in the eyes as Shadowthrone had taken part in one of the last chainings.   Maybe time was of the essence, and there wasn't time to convince the CG of the necessity. He might have agreed to be sacrificed once he understood the intention, but there wasn't time for a debate."
Malazan,36hr7i,Dwolf63,2,Wed May 20 00:29:52 2015 UTC,"Tavore was revealed to be a Talon towards the end of the book which was Cottilion's faction and called herself a child of the Empire I.E Kellenved,  add that to the fact that it was Shadowthrone and Cottilion who planned the whole thing it's easy to see where she got her info from."

Some believe that CG would attempt to take out some of the gods and ascendants that participated in his Chainings on his way out, and that Cotillion stabbing him just forced him to return to his world without doing any of that. Eriksons official stance is that it's up to the reader, so it's up to you whether you believe that Cotillion would take part in a plan to kill the CG or not.  Also, the Bonehunters were never really privy to the ""plan"" until the very end, and probably wouldn't have even attempted to harm the CG without Tavores direct command. If killing the CG was part of Tavores plan, she would've let Fiddlers company know. Either Tavore was acting out of compassion for the CG, or Fiddlers company would have been unable to harm the CG regardless."

Malazan,36d0j4,wjbc,9,Mon May 18 12:10:21 2015 UTC,"Annihilation is the closest I can think of. Decimation may have originally meant one in every ten men being beaten to death, but has come to mean, or imply, the near-wiping out of a body of people. Annihilate is derived from the Latin nihil, meaning ""nothing"", and so essentially means ""being reduced to nothing""."
Malazan,36d0j4,i_a1m_to_misbehave,8,Mon May 18 12:18:27 2015 UTC,"Modern English seems to use the term decimation closer to annihilation than a ritualistic, self-inflicted group punishment used to maintain order in the Roman military.   It's not just Erikson. If you knew nothing about Rome, you would likely follow along Eriksons use of decimation without issue."
Malazan,36d0j4,vancity-,4,Mon May 18 13:18:26 2015 UTC,"Yep. That's exactly my point. Because not many people actually know about the Roman punishment, the term shifted to mean large amounts of people being killed. And, in a storytelling context, most people would interpret that as being almost everyone being killed, because it makes for a better story.   However, if one knows Latin, then it's fairly obvious. Decimation. Decimal. One in ten.  Though I can't bring to mind a specific example where Erikson has used the word."

Malazan,368fl4,MortalSword_MTG,6,Sun May 17 07:42:49 2015 UTC,"This is mostly guess work and my own impressions cobbled with a few tidbits from some behind the scenes stuff. But basically Immortan Joe has built up a cult for the War Boys. It's sort of mentioned that they are all walking dead men because of their exposure to radiation (it's in their bones) and that they are reaching the end of their half life. They see cars/trucks as power because of the way Joe hands out favor based on those who do incredible things out on the road. They worship the power of the V8 engine (the sign they make by interlacing their fingers over their head, it's the sign of the V8 configuration, canon from a behind the scenes) and I imagine they worship chrome because everything in the world has gone to shit, so finding anything shiny is rare/noteworthy. Immortan Joe has built upon Norse legend and convinced them all that when they die in crazy acts of violence they will later join him and the other War Boys in Valhalla. I get the distinct feeling that they are loosely based on the Oskorei, or riders in the Wild Hunt. The white body paint and other ghostly features are representative of that. Reminds me very much of corpse paint used by Black Metal bands for the same reason, they are assuming the visage of spirit riders in the warband.   The blood sack idea is that Max has O-neg blood type, which they know is universal donor. Because he is essentially crazy and kicks major ass, they see it as high octane fuel for their depleted bodies. Nux is dying at the beginning, his body giving out to the radiation, so Max's blood is a ""topping him off"" basically giving him really healthy blood for long enough to go die a warrior's death in service to Joe, to gain his favor and a high status in Valhalla.   Again, mostly my piecing together ideas from some background stuff and my own logic/knowledge. Personally as a fan of worldbuilding I loved those War Boys and think its a top notch concept."

One of the symptoms of radiation poisoning is reducing the amount of red and white blood cells you have.

Malazan,368fl4,BobikaFett,3,Sun May 17 21:47:09 2015 UTC,"It looked, to me, like they were trying to imitate Immortan Joe's silver breathing mask to assist them in getting into valhalla.  Like a suicide bomber yelling ""Allahu Akbar"" before blowing themselves up.  Larry and Barry are the reason for the bloodbag, the only thing that gets me is when doing a blood transfusion, doesnt the old blood have to come out? He only had one tube."

As for the pale dudes, they were breeded but defective somehow, hence the whole ""half life"" and ""live, die, live again"" thing. The bloodbag was because Nicholas hoult lost blood or something so he used an O blood type human."

At the point in history that the series takes place, it's basically just a fact of the universe that they are constantly trying to destroy each other, not much explanation is needed."
Malazan,362r7o,ChaosBrat,3,Fri May 15 17:19:12 2015 UTC,"It's a little bit of a digression, but this is what I love about this series.  Even the Jaghut-Imass wars aren't actually easily explained.  History is a story told from a perspective, and no perspective is absolutely comprehensive.  Erikson does a magnificent job of illustrating that, often by undercutting what was ""explained"" by revealing the underlying biases or misinformation at the heart of that explanation, or just by showing another facet to make it all so much more complex (see Olar Ethil)."
Malazan,362r7o,hustlegion,2,Fri May 15 18:47:53 2015 UTC,"i thought the imass war was explained okay, the jaghut had a couple of tyrants that oppressed the imass, the imass grew up and overthrew the oppressed and so thought very jaghut had to be exterminated so they wouldn't be ruled by a tyrant in such a manner again"
Malazan,362r7o,SKR47CH,3,Fri May 15 22:33:34 2015 UTC,"I take it as a general rule, that all Ascendants hate each other. The sisters might have some history, as is implied often.  Regarding Jaghut/Imass - spoiler.   Hope that made sense.  Edit: Ooops. You said it's pretty easy to figure out Jaghut/Imass. Sorry/."
Malazan,362r7o,Tumblehawk,1 point,Sat May 16 11:33:32 2015 UTC,Yeah no problem.  Thanks for the explanation.  I thought there was a pretty big Jaghut reveal in this book.  Two actually.
Malazan,3630r1,notaswedishchef,3,Fri May 15 17:52:12 2015 UTC,"It's a different series the second time through.

Malazan,3611a7,wowzers002,11,Fri May 15 04:50:45 2015 UTC,"The Malazan Wiki is going to dry up as a good source when you hit book 2. If you're looking for something helpful to read along with the book, check out the Tor reread. Just stick to the chapter summaries and Amanda's commentary and you won't get any spoilers.  The other advice I'd give is don't feel afraid to reread sections if you need to, and don't feel too bad about being confused, this series is designed around that feeling."
Malazan,3611a7,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Fri May 15 05:06:21 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! And that is a great source I'm going to use that from now on instead of the wiki. Thanks!
Malazan,3611a7,Elandar,1 point,Fri May 15 05:14:03 2015 UTC,"That is a great resource. I'm halfway through a reread right now, and have been following along. They do a great job.  I would add to what /u/SageOfTheWise said, and suggest even reading Bill's commentary as well. Occasionally there are some pretty strong hints at things, but I can never remember him outright spoiling anything. Hopefully someone will correct me if I'm wrong. I'm not sure how it would look from a first time reader's perspective, though.  Stay away from the comments, and don't read the author question and answer pieces. Spoilers everywhere.  EDIT: Actually, scratch that. I just looked at Bill's commentary for the prologue of GotM, and he gives a little too much away right off the bat. I really think that's more the exception than the rule, though."
Malazan,3611a7,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Fri May 15 13:49:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah honestly, Bill's commentary is spoiler free at least 99% of the time from what I remember. He knows Amanda is reading it and doesn't want to spoil her. I just stay on the safe side, plus people get on my case when I suggest it. Plus those posts start getting longer and longer, starts taking just as long to read the whole post as it did the chapter."
Malazan,3611a7,Elandar,1 point,Fri May 15 14:02:09 2015 UTC,"They do tend to carry on a bit, especially Bill. From a re-reader's perspective, I really enjoy it. Could most definitely just be too much for the first time through, though."
Malazan,3611a7,madcowbomber,1 point,Fri May 15 14:31:03 2015 UTC,I knew jumping into this series was going to be a challenge but  I'm really intrigued by the story and want to keep on reading. Like you said key will be re reading if I am ever confused.
Malazan,3611a7,Galahad_Lancelot,7,Fri May 15 05:15:40 2015 UTC,"Wow, you've really jumped off into the deep end!  Malazan is known for having a tough first volume, although I think you'll find it's definitely worth it.  Erikson doesn't hold hands at all like most authors do when it comes to introducing new settings, characters, and concepts, so it's definitely a challenge for even a more experienced fantasy read to pick up for the first time.  Plus he has a couple of quite unique magic systems that can be hard to figure out (warrens and the Deck of Dragons).  As far as a reading strategy, I would say do what works for you.  If reading chapter summaries helps, by all means keep doing that.  To give you a sense of the overall shape of the story, you might consider it through the theme that Erikson himself stated, that ""power draws power"".  Right now you're seeing little droplets of power scattered all over the places, but over the course of the novel they're going to draw closer and closer together and combine for a very... explosive finale.  For reference without spoiling much, the story settles down to focus on a few main groups of characters.  Primarily, the Bridgeburners, a group of soldiers in the Malazan Empire.  Whiskeyjack, Paran, Kalam, Quick Ben, Sorry, and Fiddler are all Bridgeburners.    Then you should meet a group of characters in the city of Darujhistan - Kruppe, Crokus, Marillion, and Mallick are all Daru citizens.  Finally, you'll follow Adjunct Lorne, right hand of the Malazan Empress Laseen, and her aide Toc the Younger, and the T'Lan Imass Tool.   There's a few other more powerful characters who make a few appearances in the novel, but these are the main groups you'll want to follow.  I would encourage you that if you can get through Gardens of the Moon, the next two volumes are among the best epic fantasy I've ever read.  Also, if you can get through this, you can probably work through just about any fantasy novel."
Malazan,3611a7,madcowbomber,4,Fri May 15 05:13:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I knew after reading the prologue I had a tough test ahead of me. I really think the key was my e reader purchase. A lot of words I had no idea existed that I can find out what it means with the click of a button.   Like you said jumping into the deep end, I've been playing d&d for the past 5 years so I feel comfortable with the setting (so far) for the warrens I could be wrong by I am envisioning as an example a giant hall way with doors. And certain mage can open  certain doors. As soon as they open a door there magic comes out and flows through the hall. I'm going to take it really slow and not rush it. Luckily I don't have to write an essay on it so I don't have that to worry about and just take it slow. I've ran into a couple spoilers using the wiki. But from now on I'm going to use the source the other comment here suggested"
Malazan,3611a7,Galahad_Lancelot,2,Fri May 15 05:21:19 2015 UTC,SPOILER can you please explain a bit about the deck of dragons and the warrens and the Gods that are not like the usual immortal gods but seem like demi-gods who can be killed? I have no idea what hairlock is doing in the warren and I don't know what Tattersail's thyr warren even means. Thank you! just a bit of a hint would be great!
Malazan,3611a7,groovy_ash,1 point,Sun May 17 09:49:49 2015 UTC,"The Deck of Dragons  It's like a tarot card deck, except instead of suits it has houses.  Each house has a series of positions like King, Queen, Knight, Herald, Jester, etc., which are all represented on cards in the deck.  However, those positions and houses correlate to real factions and persons in the real world.  That's why Ammanas is sometimes called Shadowthrone, because he represents the House of Shadow and is the King of Shadow in the Deck of Dragons.  The kicker is that when someone lays out the cards in the Deck of Dragons, it can reveal what the entities in the Deck are up to.  Gods and Ascendants  There are gods in the world of Malazan, some more so than others.  K'rul, Burn, Soliel and Poliel, Oponn, and Fener and so on and so forth, are all gods.  That said, there are also Ascendants, who are like demigods - powerful characters in their own right, and who may occupy cards in the Deck of Dragons.  Ammanas and Cotillion are Ascendants, and when you get into Deadhouse Gates, you'll meet shapeshifters called Soletaken and D'ivers who are also trying to become Ascendants.  Warrens  Warrens are like alternate dimensions which can be traveled through like a wormhole; but they also radiate magical energy that can be manipulated by mages.  They are also often aspected to particular elements or races; for instance, Jaghut use a warren called Omtose Phellack, which is a warren of ice, and the Tiste Andii use Kurald Galain, the warren of shadow. Human mages may access other warrens like Denul for Healing, D'riss for stone, or Thyr for light."
Malazan,3611a7,Galahad_Lancelot,1 point,Sun May 17 10:05:20 2015 UTC,"SPOILER Couldnt someone keep playing the deck of Dragons again and again? also, isn't Sorry and Paran technically demi-gods? they are possessed by the Gods Rope and Oponn. Also, what does Crokus' coin do? It is Oponn's coin but I don't know why it is important. Lastly, who is Cotillion and what does he want in all this, he is the one who unleashed the hounds on Itko Kan and possessed Sorry...so I am thinking he is after Laseen. And Sorry became a crazy killer with her new powers. If Gods can die in this book, does that mean they are gone forever? Then perhaps in the future there are no gods! Sorry! I am just so excited about knowing more!"
Malazan,3611a7,groovy_ash,1 point,Sun May 17 10:18:13 2015 UTC,"Playing the Deck over and over will yield the same results because it's basically telling you what is happening/going to happen. Each card can represent something different based on the place and time.   'Demigod' isn't really the right word. All gods are ascendants, but not all ascendants are gods. To be a god, you need worshippers. So Cotillion is a god, and because he's possessing Sorry, you could say she's a god too. And an ascendant. Oponn wasn't possessing Paran if I remember correctly, just using him.   The coin is Oponn's involvement in the mortal world, and I think it gave him unnaturally good luck as well.   You're on the right track with Cotillion, but saying any more would spoil it :)  As with your last question, the answer is difficult, even for someone who has read the entire series. Also spoilers :) Don't be sorry for asking questions! We live to answer them on this sub and it's awesome to see new people excited about the series."

I was told to check out Malazan through a GoT forum. Have you read GoT? If so, how do the two compare? GoT is a lot easier to read and very gripping. Can it be that Malazan is just harder to read but even MORE gripping? I would love that~"
Malazan,3611a7,madcowbomber,2,Sun May 17 12:46:53 2015 UTC,"I've read ASOIAF 1.5 times (gonna wait until TWOW comes out to reread) and I love it. I dunno how the two compare; they're totally different in some aspects and really similar in others. Prose is a lot different, Erikson starts to really get into philosophical rants and long descriptions while GRRM tends to use a lot more brevity, at least from what I remember. But they are both totally unique and do away with a ton of fantasy tropes, and have a lot of adult themes. Different but the same, y'know?   But yeah, Malazan is very gripping. Some books will drag on, while you will probably tear through others in a manner of days, but they all have the nonstop action extravaganza at the end."
Malazan,3611a7,Galahad_Lancelot,2,Sun May 17 13:26:48 2015 UTC,holy crap that is awesome! Fellow GoTer! makes me happy that we have same interests =D
Malazan,3611a7,Galahad_Lancelot,0,Sun May 17 13:29:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you have to have some skill in reading the Deck, I believe, but it can be read multiple times.  That said, it still needs to be interpreted, which is rather trickier.  Sorry being possessed by Rope does make her more powerful than just a regular fisher-girl, but she's still physically limited in ways that Cotillion himself isn't.  Paran, IIRC, isn't possessed, but he does have the attention of Oponn in GoTM, if I recall, and the coin is simply some kind of tracking mechanism.    Cotillion is aka the Rope, and I'm not going to say much more on that, because it'll be explained at the end of the second volume, and it's way too good to spoil.  Yes, gods can die, but they can also be brought back."

Malazan,3611a7,end_O_the_world_box,2,Sun May 17 18:00:00 2015 UTC,"Reading comprehension is something you will have to build up on your own.  People who have been reading for years obviously don't even think on this. Their minds are just practiced at it. While my suggestion would have not been to read Malazan first go, pick up something less dense with not as many details and point of views, I still feel this isn't beyond anyone's capacity as long as they have interest in it.  As SageOfTheWise noted you check out the Tor reread. They do a decent job covering the books and various points covered in them. I also suggest that you ask questions here if you feel you missed something, misunderstood or got lost.  I doubt there is a person here who got everything on their first go. Most of us here discovered something new by asking questions, or reading various threads. This place in particular has a great deal of people who know quite a bit about these books.  Also first book is disjointed in events. It's not as smoothly done as the others. It was also written about a decade before the others. You will see his writing improve immensely as he goes. Honestly by the last book his work is breathtaking.   Avoid the wiki. There are unmarked spoilers, information is damn near all over the place. It also doesn't have no where near as much context as necessary. Sometimes I just get a feeling I should bite the bullet and start setting that place straight.But you know, hundreds and hundreds of characters. And I don't remember all the details in my head. Perhaps during another re-read I'll start taking notes.  Anyway, ask questions. Especially early on where you feel like completely lost. No one here will spoil anything, just clarify stuff to help you on your way."
Malazan,3611a7,TriscuitCracker,2,Fri May 15 05:23:01 2015 UTC,I have run into a couple spoilers already there and i was a bit disappointed but I'm not touching there again and going to the tor reread from now on. I am definitely taking a look at this sub because seems like it's a great community. I'll keep at it as I keep reading the stories get better and better in the next books and am anticipating them now. Thanks for the kind words!
Malazan,35yh1t,MMSTINGRAY,13,Thu May 14 15:53:04 2015 UTC,"Glad you're liking it!  I admit after I read it most other fantasy books including ones I've re-read many times seem a bit lacking, or small in nature. That does fade, thankfully.  Best thing for you is to read Forge of Darkness, and the Esselmont books, then do a re-read! You catch so much more on the re-read and see how everything connects or is foreshadowed. It's almost like reading a whole new series."
Malazan,35yh1t,TriscuitCracker,7,Thu May 14 16:06:40 2015 UTC,"You should definitely reread the whole series a couple of years after you have finished. Erikson's books are even better the second time, when you catch all the small hints and nods to future events that he put in there."
Malazan,35yh1t,EarinShaad,3,Thu May 14 18:10:45 2015 UTC,"I am doing a reread now (just about 25% done with crippled god).

Its pretty awesome! - But glad you have discovered Malazan, its good for several rereads as well. - You can reread it right after Crippled god unless you read very fast, is should be a good while since you last read Gardens of the Moon, but why not try The Black Company by Glenn Cook, or Esslemonts books in the same universe. - The options are many, but they are all awesome :D  If you do read Esslemont, try google a reading order where his books appear as well. It gives even more depth to your reread."
Malazan,35yh1t,hustlegion,1 point,Thu May 14 23:33:55 2015 UTC,"i thought the exact same thing, tbh lotr is an all time favourite but i prefer the malazan world cause its so complex and large and i wish i could read some of the books for the first time again, i feel like the malazan world is much easier to resonate with. like how can you not fall for fiddler and the bridgburners  , or the marines in TCG and rake is my fave. oh look im gushing anyways yeah i completely agree its an amazing series that i think improves greatly as it  progresses ."
Malazan,35zuu2,discard668,5,Thu May 14 22:16:36 2015 UTC,"they are the true mirror of their people   That's not a bad way to put it. So if I remember right, the Barghast gods are just the spirits of their ancestors. So take all the terrible Barghast way of life, and imagine how even worse they probably were a few hundred years ago. That's about the mentality of the gods."
Malazan,35zuu2,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Fri May 15 05:02:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the entire Barghast story in DoD was a disaster in my mind. It served one main function that could have been accomplished in far less than the 300 pages devoted to them in that book. Nothing about this storyline makes a lot of sense so i wouldn't question it too much. OUt of the entire series, it's the only storyline that i truly hated."
Malazan,35zf7g,SKR47CH,2,Thu May 14 20:18:10 2015 UTC,I think there's a typo in Assail where Fisher and Kyle are switched for some reason. Needs better editing.

Malazan,35ybv0,Tumblehawk,3,Thu May 14 15:21:24 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more about WoT. The worst part of those books was the pacing, mainly because it seems the author mistook repeating himself for depth and development at some points."

But considering that ICE is working on a prequel trilogy next, who knows when we'll get that? I do wonder how many characters native to the ICE books would make their way into the Karsa Orlong trilogy that SE has talked about writing, since that would presumably take place post-TCG."

Just gave myself chills remembering."

I was also disappointed with how localized it was. Especially after Reaper's Gale started collapsing and colliding major plotlines. I was really hoping/expecting some main empire or Seven Cities in this one. I know some people had some idea of the plot of each book but I came in with no knowledge. Really expected at least Paran here with his connection to the hounds and Dagnipur.   That's how I felt when I finished this one at least. I've now finished the main series and have many more thoughts but that's for another conversation"
Malazan,35vpye,Lankles,1 point,Wed May 13 23:05:58 2015 UTC,The whole Picker contacting Paran thing has made me excited for the next book. But I think I'll take a break and read something basic inbetween.
Malazan,35vpye,anisotropy77,1 point,Wed May 13 23:50:32 2015 UTC,"This one is probably my least favourite ... it seems like a lot of it takes place to conveniently tie off threads that SE didn't really need for DoD/tCG. The narration by Kruppe (loved by some) also aggravated me, as much as I enjoy his conversation with other characters I don't want him talking to me.   In fairness though, the convergence/duel/Dragnipur-business and the way those Darujhistan and Bonehunters threads were tied off were omnisplendid, and DoD/tCG were better for it. GG SE."

Malazan,35vfoh,gogomom,7,Wed May 13 21:04:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is really a spoiler because we commonly say that the final two books are on Lether to newer readers. So as a premise, within the narrative itself, most high level beings or anyone with foresight, intuition, or even a vague awareness of what is going on in the universe knows that some serious shit has been going on off to the east of the Lether Empire, in Kolanse. It is hidden from the reader (though a lot of hints are there on your second read-through) but many of the characters are aware of a massive convergence brewing and at least some idea of the major factions involved. They are just extremely cagey about this knowledge (Quick Ben, Tavore, etc.).  Because of this, it is the nature of the Malazan universe (Wu?) that everything is drawn to convergence. Which is why the Grey Swords went there.  Remember that Toc had joined the Grey Swords at the end of MoI. Also remember that they had originally been dedicated to Fener, but during the siege Fener was cast out. Afterwards, the survivors approached the Barghast that had arrived for a new god (besides Trake, who already found followers), and their shamans told them about the newly re-ascended Wolves of War/Winter, so they swore themselves to them. Sometime later (not explicitly in the books IIRC) the Wolves told their new Destraint ""get your asses to Lether"" without much of an explanation. So they showed up clueless and at a loss of what to do, saw some native people getting eradicated, and being mercenaries with morals they sold themselves into service of these people (the Awl), but were betrayed and basically obliterated (except Toc, this poor guy's story just kept going).  Tool and the Barghast followed a similar path. Remember in MoI that some Barghast emissaries showed up at Capustan right before the siege looking for their Founder's relics (the emissaries being Setan and her brother)?  They found them, and they called their kin who arrived in time to wipe out the Panion's forces after the city was devastated, and discovered that the relics were boats and weapons, indicating that the Barghast were foreign to Genabackis. After the battle at Coral, Tool had become mortal again and forswore his people and his title, and he hooked up with Setan and ended up leading the entire White Face Barghast nation after her father (the unifier of the tribes) died.  As a nation they had decided to go find their ""homeland"", where their boats were made, at the urging of their newly awakened (and pretty naive) gods. This brought them to the continent of Lether, and like the Grey Swords, they showed up basically clueless, and being Barghast they immediately decide to go fight stuff because that is what they do (I think at this point I'm getting into information given to you at the start of DoD, but it isn't really spoiler information, just something that is told to you when you return to this plotline in DoD). Also, presumably their gods had told them of some sort of enemy that they were supposed to drive off when they arrived there, but no one could figure out who the enemy was, so they started making enemies. You'll read more about them later."
Malazan,35vfoh,TocTheEternal,2,Wed May 13 21:53:21 2015 UTC,Thank you ever so much for your insightful reply.

Malazan,35vfoh,TocTheEternal,2,Thu May 14 17:39:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a good bit of background to be aware of. The Barghast plotline might not be central to the plot but it is pretty important and explored thoroughly in the last two books.

Malazan,35r7y5,Jester814,2,Wed May 13 04:39:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Something like the way Mallick used Mael, he would get his homeboy Tehol to outfuck Mallick.  Well, I am currently 25% in SW, and Mallick seems to be a character with great potential. Sure we can never forget what he did in the main series, but then, I think we only hate him because we got a direct view into the battle and his schemes. If we were just told what happened, like with Kallor, and Draconus, I don't think we'd be hating him this much.  Mallick is a smart guy with ambitions, and it's not like his crimes were the worst of the lot. It's just that we were looking into his schemes and POV in real time."
Malazan,35r7y5,SageOfTheWise,7,Tue May 12 22:10:43 2015 UTC,I think Mallick is Malazan's take on the idea of how good a person you are and how good a ruler you are aren't too connected. Usually a story does this be showing good person -> bad ruler. With Mallick we've got the opposite.

Malazan,35r7y5,notaswedishchef,1 point,Wed May 13 20:18:22 2015 UTC,"I want to throw my thoughts in but they are a bit jumbled so feel free to take what you want.   Very small point from BB by ICE, one character in the book comes to the conclusion Mael being the oceans, sees all of  humanity, the good and bad. Tehol uses the wisdom of the ocean, he's kinda the enlightened human right? Then there's malick, he uses the strength of the ocean for power the supposed base instinct of humans.   The malazan are an empire built on strength, strong armies and strong mages plus strong munitions,this comes off as cruel, slaughter and conquering, but even rake admits the cities that join the empire thrive and are greater than before so is it cruel destruction or the tearing of old ways by force. The lethari are an empire built on infrastructure and supposed.       brilliance. Only this is twisted, instead of conquering by armies the majority of conquering is done by talking, trades that end in one side being in debt then being owned by the lethari with the soldiers not conquerers  but guards to keep the slaves in line. Tehol seeks to fix that, Malick doesn't.   Now I don't like malick, but I like shadow throne. Only time and again we are told that shadow throne was cutthroat in his rule. Oh sure he goes on about when the government gets to big it's all about numbers not people. Yet he uses the I'mass  against li heng and the genebackin campaign. Malick should fall so that the malazan version of Tehol steps up, but who knows if that'll happen."

Malazan,35qtku,JestaKilla,3,Wed May 13 12:20:00 2015 UTC,"Aww, that sucks.  Just a little more patience though and you can start reading the greatest chapter of the series."

Malazan,35qtku,JediMasterZao,1 point,Tue May 12 20:48:11 2015 UTC,Yeah - getting back into the old characters.  Karsa might be my favorite.  Getting a Cotillion POV was interesting too!!!

Malazan,35qtku,Jragghen,1 point,Tue May 12 23:55:58 2015 UTC,Ha!  He really is a great character.  Driven.  That's what I like most about him...determination.
Malazan,35qcww,ep777,10,Tue May 12 17:21:38 2015 UTC,"First one, continue reading. It gets nicely summarized, oddly enough for this series, in the end.  Just enjoy the awesomeness of the Hust Sword.  Second one, you're just witnessing the Crippled God as we've learned about him via character POVs.  In Reapers Gale, we see how he came to this world, an involuntary summoning, that shattered him into all the fragments, painfully.  In TTH, you see his priests offering salvation (death) to those suffering.  In Bonehunters, you see the result of him trying to make a stronger world through Poliel and Young Felisian.  He suffers and cares for those that suffer."
Malazan,35qcww,sonofa2,7,Tue May 12 17:35:01 2015 UTC,"Also, he is also called the ""Chained God"" for a reason, and his chaining took place before he was (actively) poisoning the world in order to control his power. He's been screwed at every turn, it was just for 7 books you only see his reactions without seeing the purpose or cause."
Malazan,35qcww,TocTheEternal,4,Tue May 12 18:51:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we've basically been spoonfed a bunch of anti Crippled God propaganda up until book 6 or 7 and now you're finally getting to see the story from his side a little bit."
Malazan,35qcww,Montaron87,8,Tue May 12 22:28:04 2015 UTC,"First one, I actually don't really remember, so I can't help you there. The whole Shake storyline felt pretty useless and disconnected from the rest of the story, actually.   For the second one, that's kind of the point. They're not trying to help him because he's a good guy, or even just not evil. They're trying to help him because it's the right thing to do. He was, ultimately, a victim, lashing out at a world that has only ever caused him pain. Even someone as cruel and destructive as the Crippled God deserves compassion, and an end to their unjust suffering. Tavore's goal has nothing to do with the fact that he's poisoning the world, and causing untold suffering and death. It only has to do with the fact that he was unjustly stolen, torn apart, chained, and tortured. I wrote this, a little while back, to give better perspective on why the Crippled God is a tragic figure worthy of compassion"
Malazan,35qcww,CaptainUnusual,5,Tue May 12 18:23:09 2015 UTC,"It is explained in chapter 12, in a couple of words to do with Iparth Erle,. If you have read the chapter already and missed that I can get you the proper quote later."
Malazan,35qcww,MoranthMunitions,3,Tue May 12 22:28:12 2015 UTC,"The trick of DOD / TCG books is to make showing compassion to the Crippled God a worthy goal.  As for the Liosan, I believe Shadowthrone describes the issue at some point in a very clear way.   You may not have gotten to that point though."

Malazan,35m703,TriscuitCracker,3,Mon May 11 20:21:42 2015 UTC,"Nah. Cuttle and Fid for two are pretty good with them. Mince managed to use them pretty well (i.e. not suicidally) in the Chain of Dogs, and even Spindle seems relatively reasonable with them. Perhaps certain specific sappers - but we've already discounted Crump (Jamber Bole)."
Malazan,35m703,tripod-pop,2,Mon May 11 20:37:26 2015 UTC,"Even if they are pretty good, shaving cussers IS an horrible idea. There also this story about companys of sappers that used to existed and that were dismantled after one sapper stepped on his cusser and obliterated half his company. You need to be kind of batshit crazy to do what the sappers do. And like some said, Hedge is probably the worst of the lot."
Malazan,35m703,baconforged,1 point,Tue May 12 00:08:34 2015 UTC,"It was Spindle that commanded that sapper company, until it got blown up. At which point Dassem decided it ought to be abolished. And the only two to be shaving cussers are Fiddler and Hedge. Those two were the first two sappers, and by way of experience, seem to be the best. I also expect that Fiddler was left to do most of the shaving, as he's the one with the sensitive touch."

Also don't forget the glossary at the back of the books."
Malazan,35n12q,TriscuitCracker,3,Mon May 11 21:27:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly, you learn the history by reading the books, if you learned the history up front it would ruin half the fun of the books."

He claimed he was her father, and the madame said he must have been 10 years old when he sired her (she was commenting that he was too young to be her father).  8) Gothos (in the prologue he says he's going to, if you recall) used ice to cut Lether off from the rest of the world, in an attempt to keep the Edur invaders from the rest of the world.  This stunted their exploration, and their magical growth.  It's never stated outright in the series that I can recall, but this is what I always assumed happened."

Malazan,35l290,TocTheEternal,3,Mon May 11 13:37:31 2015 UTC,"1) Yes, in book 7.   2) again, keep reading.   3) I don't know when that happens, but yes, it is a joke or something.   4) Ublala is fairly ""pure"" blooded as far as the remaining Tartheno on Lether go. The Seregahl are more. Karsa is basically 100% of the original ""giantish"" blood.   5) Keep reading.   6) The Andii of Bluerose disguised or hid themselves.   7) I don't think so?  8) I'm not sure if this is explained in the beginning of book 5 or 7, either way I wouldn't really consider it a spoiler if you've read this far. But there is a prologue scene from ancient times explaining that Lether is essentially sealed off from time, especially from the hold of death. In present day, this enchantment is crumbling and modern magical structures are appearing and conflicting with the old order. I guess you could say that they were ""frozen"" in time.   9) The first time around? One of the richest people around. Rich enough that he caused a financial crisis and garnered empire wide attention when he went broke.   10) Kallor is not the First Emperor. The First Empire of men was ruled by Dessembelakis or something like that TBH Spoiler. It is generally thought that Kallor's original empire (there were many) was roughly contemporary with it (names can be misleading). It was on Jakaruku and the continent he destroyed. The continent he destroyed was absorbed by K'rul (MoI prologue, when he and Drakonus and the Sister of Cold Nights confront him) and turned into the Imperial Warren that the Malazans claimed. You'll be seeing more of Kallor, and yes, he is a very important figure. The Letherii are actually originally an old colony of the First Empire (which was based on the Seven Chris continent) and so you'll start noticing references to it.   And finally, yes, you will see several more appearances by the Seguleh in the main series. They are also a main faction in ""Orb, Scepter, Throne"" by ICE, if you decide to read his books."

I do think the end room and the river discussion are related in some way but likely unimportant.  Another question I had was:  the Avowed is a new character set - right?  If yes, why the overlap name with the Crimson Guard that has been seen in previous books?  The two sets of Crimson Guards seem to be at odds with one another...unless it's an coming twist.  Thanks for the explanation of Leather being frozen as well as the first Empire.  Makes sense in context of current settings."
Malazan,35l290,AllWrong74,4,Tue May 12 10:35:18 2015 UTC,"Hah. He is Crimson Guard, that's why. The Avowed are the original members is the Crimson Guard. Their leader,  K'azz D'avore, went missing a while back (around GotM) and the Guard went on ""Diaspora"", which basically means they split up to recruit and grow their resources. Some of (like Bars's group) got very lost. ICE's books actually focus on the Guard quite a bit, staying with ""Return of the Crimson Guard"". And there are some internal conflicts in the Guard that start to develop, but not much of that is touched on in the main series. They're still pretty united overall."
Malazan,35l290,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Mon May 11 13:00:20 2015 UTC,But Iron Bars said he wanted to return the original Emperor to the throne.  In Seven Cities they fought for the Empress and Tavore.  Am I mistaking that in some way Iron Bars and his group are with them...just not up to speed on the strategy???  Iron Bars seems anti Malaz  Seven Cities CGuard seem pro Malaz  Or am I missing something critical?
Malazan,35l290,SageOfTheWise,6,Mon May 11 13:05:35 2015 UTC,I think you're mixing up the Red Blades (Seven Cities soldiers who are loyal to the Malazan empire) with the Crimson Guard.
Malazan,35jgdu,SomeGuy1297,7,Sun May 10 23:32:49 2015 UTC,"I think at this point you're supposed to take it as something along the lines of him putting it out of his mind and focusing on the job at hand. Whether or not it could have deeper meaning based on future events I won't spoil, but I will say that that's a cool thought in the context you mention."
Malazan,35jgdu,dirksoccer,1 point,Mon May 11 00:51:03 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean, I don't really care about spoilers... I even tried to check the wiki to see if it mentioned anything about him being an ascendant, but that was useless. It essentially says ""He did shit in Darujhistan, and was trapped in the house with Vorcan."" It's a truly informative page. People should try and improve that wiki... All 2,623 pages of it.  Anyways, I don't give a fuck about spoilers.  Edit - Removed a slight spoiler that does not pertain to this discussion."
Malazan,35jgdu,Aiolus,6,Mon May 11 01:13:38 2015 UTC,"Otatoral or whatever dust can have a bunch of properties. One of which is faster healing. Rallick coated his body in it and absorbed it.   Also a cult following of sorts forms based on rallick assassination style; No magic, poisons.   Rallick also is mixed up with a lot of epic entities.   Characters can be at various points of ascension. Rallick more than likely is somewhere on the spectrum."
Malazan,35jgdu,AllWrong74,1 point,Mon May 11 01:28:35 2015 UTC,"Well, that explains the healing.  So, what you're saying is, if Rallick ascended, he could become a god of assassins? That's kind of what I was hoping for, to be honest.  Makes sense, epic entities sound fairly common in this series.  And this is why I was wondering about that sentence. ""He began his ascent."" It sounds like it's foreshadowing him becoming an ascendant. Ascendancy doesn't seem like a thing that happens instantly, which is why that sentence seems so important.   I guess that if magic dust could turn you into an ascendant, that would be a bit too easy. It essentially just turned him into a living version of Adjunct Lorn's sword, I guess."
Malazan,35jgdu,Aiolus,3,Mon May 11 02:01:26 2015 UTC,"Well, assassins don't really have gods, because they're a rather irreverent lot.  They have a patron in the form of Cotillion/The Rope.  If they weren't so irreverent he would be a god and not just a patron."
Malazan,35jgdu,Aiolus,1 point,Mon May 11 05:16:36 2015 UTC,Gods are full ascendants with lots of worshippers. I don't think rallick is that. Also cotillion is the patron (god) of assassin's.   Honestly Erikson never quite lays out the ABCs of Ascendancy.   Ascendants and those on the path are just somewhat supped up humans. Ascendancy does get fleshed out more and more as the series progresses.   Yea he is kinda like lorns sword.   Edit: a lot of this is speculation. Ascendancy is never explained fully (which I love) and is up for debate to some extent. As you continue reading you'll develop a view on it
Malazan,35jgdu,the_bridgeburner,1 point,Mon May 11 02:23:52 2015 UTC,"Well, I was just saying that since a cult following thing pops up because of Rallick, if he actually became a full ascendant, he could become a god. And Cotillion being the patron god of assassins probably wouldn't matter too much, because there can be multiple gods for one thing. If you worship Cotillion, that basically means you worship Shadowthrone, which not everyone would like... So, they could worship a different god of assassins. That, or Rallick could be the god of poisons or something.  Unfortunately, Rallick does not become an ascendant, and therefore does not become a god, so there go my hopes. Well, I assume he doesn't, unless you haven't read all the books and don't actually know.  All that I know about ascendants is that they're people who became more or less immortal, and have the ability to become gods if enough people worship them. They also gain powers, likely pertaining to who they were before they ascended, or perhaps after they ascended but before they were gods.  Oponn, for instance, was (were?) likely twins who had really good and really bad luck, likely due to a curse or a blessing gone wrong. This stayed with them all the way through ascendancy, and eventually it became their power to bestow good or bad luck upon people.  And him being like Lorn's sword (made out of the same material as the powder, I guess) would make it even more likely he would become some type of assassin god. I mean, what kind of assassin wouldn't worship a being able to stop magic users from using magic? Magic seems like it would be the downfall of many assassins, and since he gained the ability to stop magic, that would probably become his ability if he became a god. It is rather unfortunate that this won't happen... I mean, that one sentence that would most likely get overlooked by most people could've been great foreshadowing for Rallick becoming some type of god for assassins."
Malazan,35jgdu,dirksoccer,1 point,Mon May 11 03:10:10 2015 UTC,On Mobile so it's hard to respond well.   I've read all the books but when talking about characters I (try to) only say what's known in the book we're talking about. You said you didn't mind spoilers about ascension but I figured you would for characters.   There are houses and holds and whatnot which gods/ascendants occupy. There also are ascendants outside the houses.   I don't want to spoil anything.   I do think you're understanding is fine.   As for assassin's yea that's why the cult was formed around him. Though assassin's can be magic users.   Erikson does have tons of little foreshadowing sentences (we'll maybe not tons). I won't say one way or another what happens to rallick but he seems to be on some sort of path.
Malazan,35jgdu,dirksoccer,1 point,Mon May 11 03:22:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no. Oponn's ascension had nothing to do with a curse or good/bad luck. Since you don't care about spoilers, here is a big one. There was an Elder god of luck called Knuckles or Sechul Lath if you prefer. The Oponn were his children/heirs.  If you take my advice, stop speculating and read on. Ascendency is a tricky subject and it would do you no good in toying with theories. Otataral for e.g. is not just a magic stopping powder. It's something much bigger than that. So just read and enjoy the abrupt WTFs and similar surprises."
Malazan,35jgdu,AllWrong74,1 point,Tue May 12 16:51:52 2015 UTC,"But... Speculation is 1/4 of the fun! Finding out whether you're right or not is another 1/4 of the fun, which is why I asked this question... And enjoying the read is 4/4 of the fun! The other 2/4 would be discussions about it, and speculation about what happens after the story is finished."
Malazan,35jgdu,wjbc,2,Wed May 13 00:50:56 2015 UTC,"Haha, fair enough. Well iirc he doesn't ascend. I do think that would have been a really cool double meaning though, especially with the crazy stuff the otataral (spelling?) does."
Malazan,35jgdu,the_bridgeburner,1 point,Mon May 11 01:27:07 2015 UTC,"Damn, I was hoping I caught some foreshadowing... Cause it does sound rather foreshadowy. Unless you're just saying that to make it unexpected so it's even better, because it would make me think that I know it won't happen. Not sure if you would do that, but you never know.  Also, I suppose I should remove that possibly slightly major spoiler from TtH in my comment... Sure, people may be expecting spoilers, but they'll generally only be about Rallick and GotM."
Malazan,35jgdu,the_bridgeburner,1 point,Mon May 11 01:42:33 2015 UTC,"If it does turn out that way I swear it's because I'm remembering wrong, I just finished GotM on my way through round two of the series, and I'm reading things I'd forgotten about all the time. And it's definitely not outside of his MO to write some subtle foreshadowy stuff like that in, so you're right to be looking out for it."
Malazan,35jgdu,the_bridgeburner,1 point,Mon May 11 01:47:59 2015 UTC,"Ascendancy is a little trickier than that.  It basically means you've transcended death.  The literal difference in an ascendant and a god is that a god is worshiped.  Now, this certainly could be viewed as foreshadowing, seeing as he has this new-found power, and he's possibly beginning down the road of ascendancy, or it could just mean he started climbing the tower.  I don't want to tell you one way or another, because you've still got 9 books to go."
Malazan,35jgdu,SkimaskMohawk,1 point,Mon May 11 05:14:25 2015 UTC,"There's only one sentence that bothers you?  There were a lot of sentences that bothered me.  I've been reading each book in the series twice (I'm on book 3) because I just knew there was so much I was missing along the way.  All I can say is, read on (or maybe read on to the end of GotM, re-read GotM, then read on?)"
Malazan,35jgdu,the_bridgeburner,1 point,Mon May 11 17:28:31 2015 UTC,"It's not that there's only one sentence that bothered me, it's just that that one was fresh in my mind, and him healing made it seem even more like foreshadowing. I had a few days between starting and finishing the book, so I definitely forgot some sentences that sounded like they could be foreshadowing. Anyways, I finished GotM (only had 21 pages to go), and I would probably be fine with re-reading it, but now I want to read book 2.  Oh, and Rallick entering the house makes it seem even more foreshadowy, because a character mentioned that the people who go into those things are generally destined for greatness. Meaning that if I had finished the book without asking this question, I doubt that I would've asked it because I probably would've been certain he was gonna become an ascendant, or even a god. Now I'm thinking he'll only kill gods...   Rallick is so disappointing. /s  But no, really... I just like Rallick, and I wanted to know if he would undergo changes as major as ascendancy. Besides, I came here (to this subreddit) about halfway through the book, and saw a few things mentioning that there were sentences in these books that would generally be overlooked, but were, in fact, foreshadowing. I mean, most good authors will include foreshadowing in their books, sometimes being subtle, other times not, but I generally don't look out for it. However, I started paying a little bit more attention to sentences (but not spending minutes on each sentence trying to figure out if it was subtle foreshadowing), and that was the one sentence that really struck me as something that was possibly majorly major. It might've actually been that way intentionally, seeing as how it wasn't just a sentence... It had a whole paragraph to itself.  Anyways... GotM is a good book, gonna read the second one, and I guess I'll be seeing more of Rallick in the future.  Also, I use way too many ellipses... I should really stop that... I didn't use too many in this comment, but still."

Malazan,35dnsw,nandanvora,6,Sat May 9 08:46:59 2015 UTC,"If you haven't read it, ""A Wizard of Earthsea"" by Ursula K. LeGuin is a great, short fantasy novel and quite a change of pace from Malazan. It's technically the first book in a series, but stands on its own very well. Another great one-shot fantasy novel is ""Tigana"" by Guy Gavriel Kay."
Malazan,35dnsw,jeremyteg,6,Sat May 9 09:23:38 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, The Bonehunters is my favorite book in the series.  I am a huge fan of The Lies of Locke Lamora and would recommend interleaving that in. It's more light-hearted, fast-paced, and is an amazing book in general. It has two sequels, but can be enjoyed standalone until you are done with Malazan."
Malazan,35dnsw,NoFortress,6,Sat May 9 13:11:20 2015 UTC,"I mixed Malazan up with The Dresden Files when I read through it the first time! Both are great series, but in completely different ways. Dresden is not heavy, language-wise, and it's got a lot of humour, banter and pop-culture references."
Malazan,35dnsw,Phhhhuh,4,Sat May 9 10:50:21 2015 UTC,This is exactly my suggestion.  I always alternate my big series with smaller lighter books in between.  Dresden files is perfect for that.
Malazan,35dnsw,Yarrbossa,0,Sat May 9 14:48:58 2015 UTC,"Jim Butcher's (the author of Dresden Files) Codex Alera is also great.  Also, you can try The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss.  Its the first book of a trilogy but its absolutely amazing."

Brandon Sanderson also has a lot of one-shots. Warbreaker is allright, and ties in to The Stormlight Archive if you ever plan to read those."

Malazan,35dnsw,putridbabybutt,2,Sun May 10 06:05:49 2015 UTC,"I thought The Scar was even better than Perdido, and just as readable on its own even though they take place in the same world."

Yes, in fact, it takes place at the same time as Gardens of the Moon.     Hopefully Bonehunters is as good as DG.   The Bonehunters is massive, not to give too much away, but it's the first book where all the different storylines are slowly starting to converge.   Should I consider reading the first Esselmont book right now?   Absolutely! Esselmont's Night of Knives is a perfect set-up for The Bonehunters. You'll appreciate the latter much more, when you've read the former beforehand."

My favorite scene with him was when he got revenge on Bidinthal...winces I loved seeing how it all connected with the Silanda and the events in DG. Loved the forging of the flint sword and the revelation of the Seven gods and what happened to the Bridgeburners. Also come on Fiddler, worst nickname ever. Also love Corrab, he's one of my favorite side characters.   What did you think of Tavore/Felisin in the end?   Oh and just a warning on Midnight Tides, it's on a completely new continent with all new characters except 1, and takes place during GotM all the way up to HoC. But by the end of the book it was one of my favorites.   After that, you've reached the halfway point! In Bonehunters all the plot lines start slowly weaving together until Crippled God. Glad you're enjoying it!"
Malazan,359pnz,TriscuitCracker,4,Fri May 8 13:54:11 2015 UTC,"Oh man, Tavore and Felisin made me sad. I mean, I'm one of the ones who disliked Felisin quite a bit in DG. I mean she REALLY irritated me. I understood why she was the way she was, but I still disliked her. She got better for me in HoC, in part because she was there less often and when she was the main perspective she was panicked with fear or dull from the Whirlwind Goddesses influence.   I think their final scene would've had more impact if Tavore had more intimate presence... But it still made me sad. It was well done, as per Erikson's usual, and it plucked my heart strings."

Malazan,359pnz,drynwhyl,5,Fri May 8 14:51:24 2015 UTC,"You just made me want to do a re-read, and I don't have the time for it with kids.  But no, Karsa is amazing.  A friend and I ask each other to Karsa something if we need a witness to a signing."
Malazan,359pnz,Giotto,2,Sat May 9 00:50:03 2015 UTC,"""As Karsa Orlong as my witness..."" I love it! That may just happen at my wedding. I'll probably need to marry a Malazan fan girl to get away with that, though. Otherwise I'd probably just get a look."
Malazan,359pnz,drynwhyl,3,Sat May 9 03:49:20 2015 UTC,If she loves you she'll understand how important it is to be witnessed.
Malazan,359pnz,Kheshire,3,Sat May 9 12:58:52 2015 UTC,"Essentialy, he's saying ""hold my beer and watch this shit"" Whenever he drops that line."
Malazan,359pnz,Kheshire,1 point,Sat May 9 19:51:08 2015 UTC,"""Witness as I take this ship"".  That was my favorite ""Witness"" from the series. Maybe it was due to the delivery of the audio in the audiobook, or maybe because it was simply badass."
Malazan,359pnz,Oathsend,3,Tue Jun 23 15:23:53 2015 UTC,"I think that final scene with Karsa and 'Siballe might be my favourite ending of all the books I've read so far. (I'm currently on Reaper's Gale.) It perfectly rounds off Karsa's journey to the man (understatement?) he would become.  The fun continues with Midnight Tides! Although I found it somewhat overwhelming to begin with, especially when you get to Letheras and a thousand or so names and titles get thrown your way, but it's a thoroughly enjoyable book. Loads of great characters, a lot of action, and a healthy dollop of feels to round it all off."
Malazan,359pnz,angrywhitedude,2,Fri May 8 11:17:24 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right about that particular scene. So gratifying to see how far he'd come.  Plus, he murdered two Hounds of Shadow, mostly with his bare hands. Character development and cajones of lead!"
Malazan,359pnz,heavy_metal_samurai,3,Fri May 8 11:20:21 2015 UTC,He murdered two Deragoth. The hounds of Shadow are shadows of the hounds of Darkness.
Malazan,359pnz,damedash,1 point,Fri May 8 12:53:04 2015 UTC,Yeah I started a thread a few weeks ago about my confusion with these hounds.
Malazan,359pnz,chappyyy,1 point,Fri May 8 13:12:47 2015 UTC,I definitely meant hounds of Darkness. Deragoth. Chalk that whoopsie up to being awake at... Whatever time I was awake. Work. Heh.
Malazan,35av0u,danaran,3,Fri May 8 15:49:34 2015 UTC,"Guys! Let's do this. You know you want it. Lets start this fucker. It'll take time, but it'll be great. Reread will be more fun."
Malazan,35av0u,SKR47CH,3,Mon May 11 20:50:46 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately there isn't, at least none I know of. The fanbase is too small in comparison to the complexity of the series, not many resources exist. Best solution is just to ask.  Also with this series, a lot of the time their are less facts, and more competing opinions about what has happened at any given time."
Malazan,35av0u,SageOfTheWise,2,Fri May 8 18:10:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd avoid the wiki...spoiler city! Honestly, your best bet might be to just post a list of what you want refreshed right here in this reddit. There are some people (MoranthMunitions, AllWrong, SageoftheWise to name a few) who have an encyclopedic memory of things!"

Malazan,35av0u,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Mon May 11 03:22:41 2015 UTC,"How many times have you read the series, just out of curiosity? I'm guessing at least two!"
Malazan,35av0u,Tumblehawk,1 point,Mon May 11 22:14:52 2015 UTC,I'd be up for it.  It would be cool if 10-20 people all pick a character or three from GotM and chronicle what they do each chapter. Or each person tackles a chapter.
Malazan,35av0u,MrCaptDrNonsense,1 point,Thu May 14 20:53:48 2015 UTC,"The wiki has something like that, but you can be easily spoiled."
Malazan,35av0u,bantuftw,2,Fri May 8 16:10:13 2015 UTC,The wiki is also incomplete and not very good.
Malazan,35alla,skirpnasty,8,Fri May 8 14:32:22 2015 UTC,"There's two posts on the front page asking the question about reading order, and the majority answer is always to read the full series first."
Malazan,35alla,Montaron87,7,Fri May 8 15:33:51 2015 UTC,"Recommend they stick with just the series, let the weight of it all sink in for a minute, and then pick up FoD and the Esselmonts afterwards."
Malazan,35alla,NickofSantaCruz,1 point,Fri May 8 15:00:46 2015 UTC,"I mean you could do that, but I don't really see any compelling reason to. Safest bet is to stick with the Book of the Fallen and then go to either Forge of Darkness or Novels of the Malazan Empire afterwards. I agree that FoD does explain some stuff but I don't think it explains it in a way that really affects the reader's appreciation of the story all that much."
Malazan,35alla,angrywhitedude,1 point,Fri May 8 18:58:33 2015 UTC,"I would definitely not recommend someone read FoD before finishing the main series.  FoD debunks quite a few of the legends about these guys.  Hell, it's been such a long time, even their memories are warped to believe the legends were real.  As much as I like FoD, it took way too much away from Rake and Ruin, IMO.  There's no way I can turn away, though.  I have to know how Scarabandaris turns into Scabandari Bloodeye, 'cause that's a huge change.  I also have to know how Osserc finally grows up."
Malazan,35alla,AllWrong74,1 point,Sun May 10 12:13:32 2015 UTC,"FoD could be read as a FIRST book if you wanted a direct sample of the ""essence"" of Malazan.  This because GotM cannot give you that, and you need to wait a few books to actually get a real taste of Malazan.  So, the quickest path is FoD.  But beside that there shouldn't be a real reason to put it in the middle of the series."
Malazan,3592k5,ocher_knight,12,Fri May 8 03:08:39 2015 UTC,"Fuckin A, man. You're just getting started, too. Duiker is a hero, you'll find out more about heboric, Gesler and stormy are the absolute best. Love me some Gesler and stormy. Once you get your breath back, keep going! More awesome to come!"
Malazan,3592k5,philman53,7,Fri May 8 04:03:10 2015 UTC,Memories of Ice is already no less engaging! I'm excited/terrified!
Malazan,3592k5,EarinShaad,7,Fri May 8 05:17:20 2015 UTC,"Memories of Ice is probably my favoruite book in the whoe series. The Pannion Domain, Capustan, the Grey Swords, Trake's legion, the Bridgeburners, Kallor, the Moranth, Caladan Brood, Kruppe (!), Anomander Rake and his Tiste Andii...the list goes on and on. There are so many amazing characters and so many intense, thrilling, horrifying scenes..."
Malazan,3592k5,PromisedPrince694,3,Fri May 8 10:20:38 2015 UTC,Capustan is one of my favourite fictional sieges across all media. That was such an intense part of the book.
Malazan,3592k5,Calathe,2,Tue May 12 20:03:08 2015 UTC,Aah... Itkovian. :[
Malazan,3592k5,dan_au,6,Wed May 13 16:18:31 2015 UTC,MoI is legitimately my favourite fantasy novel ever. I'm jealous of you being able to read it for the first time. Savour it.
Malazan,3592k5,TriscuitCracker,2,Fri May 8 09:33:51 2015 UTC,Great prologue isn't it? Ramped up the scale and scope of the series by a factor of literally a millennium.
Malazan,3592k5,FUCKS_LIKE_A_VIKING,2,Fri May 8 06:04:56 2015 UTC,300 of them haha
Malazan,3592k5,AllWrong74,1 point,Fri May 8 08:01:00 2015 UTC,My favorite thing associated with Gesler and Stormy was Crippled God spoiler
Malazan,3592k5,AenTaenverde,4,Sun May 10 12:16:12 2015 UTC,"Iskaral Pust was wonderfully insane...   On my first read, I got bored of his character (and Kruppe's aswell) and started skipping his lines to get over his appearances. Now on a re-read of the series, I do not and I do enjoy his madman-like speak with particular focus on events, references and possibilities as he thinks outloud.  If Kruppe, Pust and Tehol (very similiar character you'll meet later on) would get into conversation, that alone would be a convergence in itself."
Malazan,3592k5,philman53,1 point,Fri May 8 07:55:43 2015 UTC,Tehol is my favorite character
Malazan,3592k5,i_a1m_to_misbehave,3,Fri May 8 12:37:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, yes. This has been one of my favourites. Perhaps later moments among the soldiers eclipse it, but overall, this is perhaps my favourite book. Fiddler, Mappo, Icarium, Gesler, Stormy. This book introduces my favourite characters - or, in the case of Fiddler, gives him a bit more of the limelight. And the Chain of Dogs is so emotional. Oh my goodness. Duiker, Coltaine, Bult. Wow."
Malazan,3592k5,chappyyy,3,Fri May 8 05:14:46 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to say it sounds like you're going to suffer the same fate as me. Obssession. This is the greatest series i've ever read, for me it blows game of thrones out of the water. Currently on my secod re-read up to MT atm, I only finished the series the first time around in December, 2 months later I just had to start again the world is just so breathtaking and seriously emotionally engaging. Enjoy!"
Malazan,3592k5,TriscuitCracker,2,Fri May 8 19:56:50 2015 UTC,"Agree with everything you said. And you're only on Book 2! You have so far to go, you're really only on the beginning of your journey. If you feel this way about DG I'm looking forward to see the essay you write on Memories of Ice.   Don't worry you'll return to Seven Cities in House of Chains."
Malazan,3592k5,Falkor,2,Fri May 8 06:04:00 2015 UTC,It will never happen but i always thought Deadhouse Gates and primarily the chain of dogs would make a great movie or miniseries. Definitely my favourite book in the whole series
Malazan,3592k5,Ominus666,2,Fri May 8 08:00:19 2015 UTC,I think that the world of Malazan has the best worldbuilding of any series I've ever read. And characters. And lore.
Malazan,3592k5,wjbc,2,Fri May 8 14:18:27 2015 UTC,"It's funny that you call it a believable world, considering the fantastic things that happen in it.  What makes it believable to you?  For me one of the interesting aspects of this fantasy is that power could be considered a curse.  Kruppe and Pust, though, seem to have found a way to hide their power behind real or simulated buffoonery (Kruppe) or real or simulated madness (Pust) and thereby remain relatively happy."
Malazan,3592k5,Calathe,2,Mon May 11 17:46:33 2015 UTC,Aaah Iskaral Pust. He's awesome.
Malazan,3592k5,Calathe,1 point,Wed May 13 16:19:31 2015 UTC,He really is. He and Kruppe are two of my favorites so far--I just love characters who speak in paragraphs. After every one of Pust's speeches I would go back and try to glean some hidden meanings. He strikes me as a character to pay particular attention to on rereads.
Malazan,356ex6,Clearly_a_fake_name,9,Thu May 7 14:21:53 2015 UTC,"I've never seen that before, it's a nice look at how it all is laid out.   Read Malazan how you want to read it, but personally I would read the main series in order for your first read through and then do Forge of Darkness or Esselmont. I think most on this sub would agree. It's jarring to go from Erikson to Esselmont, he's not a bad writer by any means but it's just not as good as Erikson. Plus you'll lose your momentum for the main story. Also Esselmont is not required reading, they aren't crucial to understanding anything that's going on in the main series, it just fills in gaps and answers throwaway plot lines that Erikson puts in Malazan throughout the series.   They are good books and well worth reading for the backstory of Malazan.  If you do a re-read of the main story right away you may want to incorporate Esselmont, or just blow through them separately.   But to each their own! RotCG is a good book and whenever you choose to read it you will enjoy it."
Malazan,356ex6,TriscuitCracker,2,Thu May 7 14:52:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  I was planning to just go for Eriksson, but after hearing that RotCG  is strongly recommend before TTH, I feel like I would be missing my only opportunity"
Malazan,356ex6,Tumblehawk,10,Thu May 7 15:10:38 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd strongly recommend reading RotCG AFTER the whole series. ;) It's a cool book with cool stories but it's also totally bloated and not well-paced, and I think it'll kill some excellent momentum leading into TtH.."
Malazan,356ex6,DAMCARDLE,2,Thu May 7 15:19:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's given me stuff to think about."
Malazan,356ex6,Lankles,2,Thu May 7 15:20:51 2015 UTC,"I'd completely disagree with the above and strongly recommend you read RotCG before you read Toll the Hounds as you will A) be spoiled for a major character death and B) not have major insight into a character's motivation or any idea how the character ended up where they are,  and how they got there from when you saw them last. The rest of Esselmont you can skip for now but RotCG is pretty much mandatory if you want the full journey of the major characters in the Book of the Fallen."
Malazan,356ex6,13143,2,Thu May 7 20:49:22 2015 UTC,"Obviously our opinions differ, but IMO ""A"" isn't all that significant to the story, and you find out enough about ""B"" so it still works.   Not that I'd put my copy of RotCG in the bin, it's still a good story and I like how A and B are fleshed out. :)  Source: I've read the MBotF once with Esselmont, and once without."
Malazan,356ex6,gbardelli,1 point,Fri May 8 03:53:11 2015 UTC,"I'm just about finished with the main series and thinking about reading the ICE books, but I'm not really interested in Night of Knives...  is it important to start there?  Will I miss out on anything if I skip it?"
Malazan,356ex6,13143,2,Fri May 8 00:19:48 2015 UTC,"You won't really miss anything, as you already know what happens with Kellanved and Dancer. Even though I don't particularly love how it's written, I still enjoyed it."
Malazan,356ex6,gbardelli,1 point,Fri May 8 01:07:19 2015 UTC,"Pretty much every series I've ever read, I'm just really disinclined to tackle prequels, or books that seem like prequels, which NoK kind of seems like.  But I am interested in the stuff going on in Assail.    So skipping NoK, is starting at RotCG alright?"
Malazan,356ex6,Montaron87,2,Fri May 8 01:30:14 2015 UTC,"Sure, RotCG has more ""original"" stuff than NoK, so you'll probably enjoy it more."
Malazan,356ex6,Tumblehawk,2,Fri May 8 05:26:33 2015 UTC,"Night of knives is a very small book (I finished it in a few days) and it sets up a few characters for ICE's later books, so you should read it in my opinion.  It's not a necessity, but it's basically a fun intro to the ICE books and I personally thoroughly enjoyed it."
Malazan,356ex6,PaxCecilia,7,Fri May 8 09:10:32 2015 UTC,"I'd retitle this infographic ""Re-reading Order Recommendations for All Malazan Novels."""
Malazan,356ex6,drae-,3,Thu May 7 17:21:49 2015 UTC,"Hmm, am I reading the infographic correctly that the events in DoD will spoil events in RotCG?  Er, and I should read both NoK and RotCG before TtH? Fuck it, no I'm just going to finish the main series and I'll catch ICE's books on a re-read.  Aint nobody got time for that."
Malazan,356ex6,PaxCecilia,3,Thu May 7 17:17:46 2015 UTC,There is a rotcg spoiler in dod. A pretty major one if you ask me.
Malazan,356ex6,drae-,2,Thu May 7 18:56:24 2015 UTC,So between RG and TtH I should read RotCG (which I should have already read NoK for)?
Malazan,356ex6,Aiolus,6,Thu May 7 19:04:15 2015 UTC,"Nah you don't really need to read nok if you can deal with not knowing who one minor character is.  And while the dod spoiler is, IMO; pretty big, it does not involve a POV character."
Malazan,356ex6,Tumblehawk,3,Thu May 7 19:12:52 2015 UTC,Erikson says to read his series first
Malazan,356ex6,Aiolus,1 point,Thu May 7 19:13:31 2015 UTC,Do you have a source for that? Was it in an interview or AMA or something?
Malazan,356ex6,MoranthMunitions,2,Thu May 7 20:35:27 2015 UTC,Not off the top of my head. Only that Erikson said in an interview or ama type thing that the published order is the one he intended it to be read in.
Malazan,356ex6,MoranthMunitions,1 point,Thu May 7 21:01:43 2015 UTC,"I remember that too, maybe from a ToR reread. But I thought he meant the joint publishing order, because that way neither series spoils the other."
Malazan,356ex6,SchizoStarcraft,2,Fri May 8 02:02:51 2015 UTC,"I need to read through the corresponding thread at some point because I have no idea how's they decided when the goats of glory should be read, there's barely enough details to identify or add occurring in the same universe, let alone plane it on a timeline.   It's a solid list though, I remember liming at it when it got added to the wikia just after it got made, as the two main moderators/admin are from the forums. It's all well reasoned, I'd go for it."
Malazan,353k2c,ep777,19,Wed May 6 20:29:05 2015 UTC,"I think the big thing to keep in mind is that books 9 and 10 are really one big book. Unlike all the other books 9 doesn't really wrap things up.   What was the point of the entire K'Chain Chemalle story? Do they play a role in The Crippled God? If not, I'm at a loss as to why this was included in the book.    They play a role in book 10.   What are the motivations for Sechul and Kilamandaros' desire to destroy the world?    They've all got their own motivations and I'm not sure when they're discussed. All I remember that is talked about by now is that the Errant got them all together to do this so they can break the existing magic system and go back to the old one where everyone has to do blood sacrifices to them, and all the chaos will put them back on top.   Was there any point to the entire Barghast story outside of looking for a reason to revive Onos Toolan as a T'lan Imass? This another story that seems, on its face at least, utterly useless. There has to have been an easier way to bring tool back to the T'lan Imass.   Well, a point of a lot of the stories in this series are themselves. It was a deconstruction of the whole idea of a group coming back to their homeland to fufill some prophesied destiny of defeating an ancient foe. None of it really works out, they all fall to their own infighting and pretty much wipe out their own species. It also connects to the larger plot in how it effects Tool, Toc, and Tool's three children going forward. And of course there also is still one group of Barghast left that's with I believe the Bolkando(?) which will also be important in book 10.   Who exactly are the children of the Ribby Snake? Are they merely the survivors of the Kolanse extermination at the hands of the Forkrul Assail?   They are. And again that will continue in book 10.   What's the deal with the Forkrul Assail's ability to freeze people with their voices? Has this always been the case? Or is there something in the Crippled God that explains what allowed them to accomplish this.   I believe they've always had this power. But as always, you'll be getting a lot more info on the Assail in book 10.   Questions on the Crippled God: -I noticed the Dramatis Personae was suspiciously lacking several major players from the story. Will we find out the god Karsa has to kill? Will we see Kallor's motivations? Or do these just wind up being loose ends?    I don't remember who's missing from the last Dramastis Personae, but it's definitely hiding a few people from you for added surprise. That being said, yes, Karsa and the god he has to kill are covered in this book. I don't believe Kallor is in the book though, but I'm also not sure what there is left to say about him.   Will we ever find out what happened with Lasseen and Korbolo Dom? Or is the Malazan Empire completely irrelevant at this point?   You get a few more mentions I think, but for the most part they aren't important in this last book. The Malazan Empire mainland has never really been important in this series, its more about its effects on the rest of the world. There is a side book though all about what's going on with Laseen though, called Return of the Crimson Guard."
Malazan,353k2c,SageOfTheWise,3,Wed May 6 20:58:18 2015 UTC,Kallor and the Empire get more fleshed out in ICE's books.
Malazan,353k2c,Lobsterpunch,2,Thu May 7 01:18:54 2015 UTC,"This is the best answer, especially the first part about the last two being one big book for all intents and purposes. Dust of dreams was so sad and grotesquely accurate with regards to war and refugees it made me tear up at multiple points."
Malazan,353k2c,gathmoon,2,Thu May 7 03:12:36 2015 UTC,Kallor is present in a 4-5 page flashback/memory in tCG. But BaB wraps him up for both of the series.
Malazan,353k2c,MoranthMunitions,5,Thu May 7 04:32:50 2015 UTC,Branching stories serve the role of making the world bigger. Journeys are not always in a straight line. The world doesn't always wrap up neatly with a bow.   On Mobile someone will give a more thorough answer.
Malazan,353k2c,Aiolus,2,Wed May 6 20:45:29 2015 UTC,"I only have two things to say:   Fuck the fucking Barghast. Fuck the fucking Errant.   After the end of the series, I hate the Barghast and the Errant more than anyone else.  This includes Mallick Rel and Pormqual."
Malazan,353k2c,AllWrong74,1 point,Sun May 10 12:25:00 2015 UTC,"I don't want to spoil tCG for you, so I'll just say that most of these questions are answered in the last book."
Malazan,353k2c,Tragyn,0,Wed May 6 20:57:19 2015 UTC,"you didnt like TtH?! also TtH signals the beginning of the end, a chraracter says that i think. Then DoD is the first half of the end and i think thats whats different about it theres not proper start/end to it like the other books i think. Its structure is different. although the end made up for the rest of the book and TcG IS amazing  1. kilamandaros and sechul lath didnt really have any proper motivations, sechul lath kinda followed the errant like he always does and kilamandaros just did something suicidal. i never got her motivations for it she was really quite powerful and was fairly neutral, the feeling i got from both books was that with the events that occured in TtH she thought it was time for a big big shake up in the world, to hell with the consequences .   the barghast overall i felt meh. i agree with you but ah well i didnt mind em. the ribby snake have my eternal respect in the book. i didnt catch it the first time i read TCG, but their impact is subtle yet vital i think. they are survivors but they do have a role IMO they are more yseful than the barghast. the FA thats just the power of their warren kinda like the jaghut with ice, pretty sure theyve always had that power, the TCG just acts as a power boost."

The ICE books have a lot of good stuff, but I can't imagine reading them mixed in on my first read-through of the main series, I just think it would kill the pacing."
Malazan,34zghj,Tumblehawk,2,Tue May 5 21:17:24 2015 UTC,"Agreed, ICE gets better with every book, but he isn't Erickson so putting those books in between will be off putting."

Malazan,34zghj,xolotl92,2,Wed May 6 16:15:08 2015 UTC,"Not to mention with the amount of characters that would be shown inbetween and separately in the two series and getting oriented in the chronological order, could be quite confusing for first time reader.  Sure I was and only with the main saga, MT got me good. I'm on my firts re-read now with ICE books mixed in and so many things I understand now, not to mention the pre-shadowings of events to happen."
Malazan,34zghj,AenTaenverde,3,Fri May 8 07:46:47 2015 UTC,"Yep, there are two authors. Both of them together made the Malazan world. Erikson is an excellent writer, Ian not that excellent if you compare him with Erikson.  But, really he is an amazing writer too. I am currently reading Ian Novels, after finishing the 10 main books by Erikson, and I must say, it has the same feel and somewhat same level of immersion.  As for the books, look at the side bar and you'll find the list.  Now for the reading order -   There are a number of ways to read.. Some like to read as the books came out, some like to mix it as per chronological order.  I prefer the first, Even though some Ian books are set at a timeline between some novels by Erikson, and have some same characters and storylines affecting each other, I like it this way.. It your preference, anyways.   You can search the sub for the recommended reading orders too. It's asked quite often."
Malazan,34zghj,SKR47CH,3,Tue May 5 21:12:00 2015 UTC,Just focus on the main sequence for your first go IMO.   I found trying to mix them in with publication order hurt the pacing and I don't think I gave Ian's novels a fair go because I wanted to get back to the core story.
Malazan,34zghj,Lankles,3,Tue May 5 22:44:55 2015 UTC,"Read through the main series first, then on your reread stick in the Esslemont books where they fit chronologically."
Malazan,34zghj,Jhegaala,2,Wed May 6 13:03:29 2015 UTC,This is the order I am following and I like how it flows so far information wise but yeah ICE isnt nearly as good so far and I hit a road bump on RotCG and just now finally getting back to the series. Basically chronological except not reading FOD until after main series http://thewertzone.blogspot.com/2012/12/updated-malazan-reading-order-and-map.html
Malazan,34zghj,danny_b87,2,Tue May 5 22:23:40 2015 UTC,"Id recommend doing them in the order they were published and leave ICE's books for after. There is a certain order to things and you can fill in gaps by skipping around, but it makes for a better story the first time around imo if some of the mystery is left in for certain characters"

Malazan,34znf1,Tumblehawk,8,Tue May 5 21:54:35 2015 UTC,Some people think Jethiss=Rake but I wholeheartedly disagree and thinks it's obvious that he's Spinnock.
Malazan,34znf1,Zingbrit,1 point,Wed May 6 00:51:20 2015 UTC,"I was one of them, but then someone provided a clear and convincing case shortly after Assail was released, that convinced me it was Spinnock."

Malazan,34znf1,DumpTruckJester,3,Wed May 6 04:43:23 2015 UTC,"Totally agree, its mentioned throughout the series in hushed whispers as this cursed land and we get there expecting some tyrants or monstrous new force and ... well, I was equally disappointed."
Malazan,34znf1,Ftove,2,Wed May 6 20:31:14 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for linking to that post. Makes all the sense in the world; the main series just isn't fresh enough in my mind, been 3 years since I read it now that I'm digging thru ICE.  And agreed on your overall take of the book."
Malazan,34znf1,Gaebryal,2,Thu May 7 22:07:37 2015 UTC,"The problem is that everything jethiss does makes him be rake, powerful with KG (rake is, spin wasnt), white streak in hair (rake had white hair, spinnok didnt),  someone that was dead and could be reborn (rake was, no mention of spinnok dying). mentioned being a son of darkness (rake was, spinnock wasnt)  And then at the end he drops one line to make it seem like hes spinnock. (that could still be rake)  Im sure the ICE wanted you to think that it was rake the whole time then flip it on you. But it was pretty badly worded."
Malazan,34xsi0,increasingly_purple,7,Tue May 5 13:20:59 2015 UTC,"I did too, you are not alone! TtH is a great book. One of the best climaxes in any Malazan book and that's saying something."

Malazan,34xsi0,VisionQuesting,2,Tue May 5 21:30:40 2015 UTC,I loved this book.  All of the deaths in it just grab you so much.  Keep reading though! The climax is worth the emotional ride of this book.

Malazan,34x6nr,beyond1,1 point,Tue May 5 08:34:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reminders. When reading Dust of Dreams last year, there were two storylines that confused me a bit (that has never happened to me before). So first of all:   You also follow a group of people that are trying to figure out whats going on in a dead K'chain city.   Can you tell me what's up with those people without spoiling much? They're basically the group of people that were consumed by Icarium's machine in Reaper's Gale, right? I remember Rautos is there, so is Taxilian. Did they become ghosts or something? That story was pretty confusing.   The Barghast are having issues with leadership. All the clans are breaking up.   Yes, I remember that one rather well, especially the gruesome parts with Hetan. So basically, some of the Barghast don't like the fact that Tool is leading them now and want to wipe him along with his entire bloodline out. Is that the sole reason, or is there more to it?   Olar Ethil is a bitch. She's the T'lan Imass goddess/bonecaster.   Was she in some of the earlier books as well? When I read Dust of Dreams, it seemed that she just popped up out of nowhere, yet is extremely important."
Malazan,34x6nr,ESGunslinger,1 point,Tue May 5 17:14:45 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply!   Correct. They are not ghosts. They do have a ghost that follows them around.   So the ghost is Icarium I presume.    Olar Ethil's first appearance was in this book. They may have mentioned her in other books since she was the one that started the ritual of tellann (the T'lan Imass Curse).   That sheds a lot of light on the character. Thanks!
Malazan,34woaw,wazir,4,Tue May 5 04:22:31 2015 UTC,When you join the army your master sergeant will give you a nickname during training and then your squad leader will let you choose your training nickname or your real name. Some of the others are  living under an alias such as Bugg or we never get their real name like Redmask. There is probably some people that dont get a nickname.
Malazan,34woaw,shadecrimson,2,Tue May 5 05:36:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think that it is quite as systematic as you describe, or as voluntary.  Some (maybe most) soldiers are given a nickname, if they didn't volunteer an alias to begin with, and when leaving training for your actual squad you don't necessarily get to choose what people call you. Sure, if you don't tell anyone your nickname, they won't use it, but if someone says ""Braven Tooth calls him Stinky"" your name is gonna be ""Stinky"" whether you like it or not. And not everyone is given one to begin with."
Malazan,34woaw,TocTheEternal,1 point,Tue May 5 15:35:26 2015 UTC,I remember in one of the ICE books a soldier chose his own name 'butcher' and all the other soldiers made fun of him. Most names are not 'cool' sounding or 'war' sounding names so I imagine nicknames like 'killer' are frowned upon.
Malazan,34woaw,howtopleaseme,6,Wed May 6 07:55:33 2015 UTC,"Its not like they have birth certificates. Your name is what people call you. Giving nicknames during training is a way to form a bond between troops. Other peoples nicknames and just assumed names. Ganoes Paran was a noble and an officer, his name had weight, most soldiers were peasants."
Malazan,34vs3x,mucp55,5,Mon May 4 23:37:33 2015 UTC,You're doing just fine! If this is grabbing you you'll love the rest. You've only begun your journey and you have a long ride ahead with many ups and downs and sleepless nights as you read until 5 in the morning. If you have any questions just ask we'll keep you spoiler free. I'd advise against going to the wiki and just remember the dramatis personae and the glossary are your friends.
Malazan,34vs3x,TriscuitCracker,3,Tue May 5 01:03:28 2015 UTC,"Good to see some other new readers of the series here (I'm new myself, on page 210 or so of Gardens of the Moon) when most people seem to be way deep into the series. Glad you like it too, I find it to be equally engrossing. I even find myself putting the book down just to try to picture the characters and settings and events that are being described, and I haven't done that since I read Rendezvous with Rama years back. I feel like I'll finish this in no time, and will eagerly be starting the next Malazan book when I'm done.   It's especially nice considering my last read, an 1100+ behemoth that, while full of interesting ideas and concepts and settings, took about 800 pages for anything interesting to happen. And the first 800 pages were full of mutilation, rape, murder and satanic rituals - not my thing at all. (props to anyone who can guess the sci-fi book based on that description)"

Malazan,34vs3x,docforlife,1 point,Tue May 5 03:57:50 2015 UTC,"It's kinda lame but it's good to write down names, you'll hear a lot about ALL of the named characters again at some point. It's a good theory that if a person was given a name, they will show up in the story more than just once or they're related to someone important."
Malazan,34vs3x,smpm,1 point,Tue May 5 01:47:19 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about ""overanalyzing!"" I found it really helpful to listen to the audiobook then go back over what I heard on my way to work/school/etc for better retention. I'm a fast reader, so it certainly helps with the many characters introduced."

But I could appreciate the story without it, I'm not taking a test, I just enjoy the second reading every bit as much as the first."
Malazan,34vw5c,SageOfTheWise,3,Tue May 5 00:11:30 2015 UTC,"This is going to be one of those things that I'm just hazy enough on to not be sure, but I believe Hedge, Trull, and Co. spent the better part of a year recovering in the shadow warren after the fight to defend the throne between BH and RG. So that was a lot of off screen time for them to bond."
Malazan,34vw5c,BleaK_,2,Tue May 5 04:03:36 2015 UTC,Also if I remember correctly it was Quick Ben who spent most time with Trull and had a close relationship with him. I remember he was way more distrought by Trulls death than Hedge.
Malazan,34vw5c,BleaK_,1 point,Tue May 5 09:01:08 2015 UTC,"From what I've read so far, Hedge was farrrrr more upset by Trull's death, at least visibly, than Quick Ben. That's why I'm a bit confused."

Malazan,34wemg,ANGARRC,5,Tue May 5 02:49:20 2015 UTC,"For me it's the verb ""to scowl"". I mean, everybody's always scowling everywhere it's absurd. Honestly, it makes me picture everybody in the Malazan books as people over-acting with their facial expressions.  Seriously, when does a human being scowl for real? When your toddler does something wrong, maybe. When you're trying to communicate displeasure to your dog. But otherwise? Who the hell ever scowls IRL? Especially to the degree everyone's scowling all over the place in these books."
Malazan,34wemg,JebusGobson,3,Tue May 5 06:41:16 2015 UTC,Don't scowl man.
Malazan,34wemg,SKR47CH,3,Tue May 5 07:45:33 2015 UTC,The people in these books are usually at war... Pretty sure a scowl is not out of place

Malazan,34ua4r,Dwolf63,2,Mon May 4 23:07:08 2015 UTC,"Fiddler and Whiskeyjack were play-acting at not knowing each other in that flashback scene from MOI. -- Which they probably found hilarious seeing as they'd figured out Kalam was play acting at not knowing about or being in cahoots with Quick Ben.   Funny thing though we're never really given much about Whiskeyjack's past , nor at what point they take matters into their own hands with Dunsparrow.  Was it before what happened to Dassem's daughter? Was it afterwards? One might think there's a connection there. Dassem was sworn to Hood for a while, and we've been told that when Whiskeyjack was a full on commander, before his ""demotion"" to sergeant, he was pretty close to that high command.   There are SOME points where the timelines conflict, but there aren't as many as most people think.  As  for the real disagreements in dating - I like to believe that's partly due to a world with warrens and warren travel. People's experience of time becomes disjointed. While we never see it  directly, I'm sure there's times where people feel they've spent weeks in a warren only to come out and only a few days have passed locally, or where they spend a couple of days in a warren and a week has passed locally.  So my ""just yesterday"" becomes your ""last week"". Since we have accounts given from different races with different life spans and different perspectives, sometimes gathered from different realms, of course there's going to be ""conflicts in the timeline"".  The worst that can be said of the author is rather than try to keep this all straight, he just kind of  shrugged and decided that all things considered, he could just blame any mistakes in the timeline on the disjointed nature of the historical records. And so yes in that sense he is right. ""The timeline doesn't matter."""

Or do you just make all them cards you could possibly think of?  I don't think it was ever fully explained, but I always tought of it as having to do with relative power, whether this player is in the fore- or background and this player's alignment.  Like with most divination techniques it's sufficiently vague as to be open to interpration at first and correct enough so one can say ""Well ofcourse!"" in the end."
Malazan,34t6pz,zippykeno,1 point,Fri May 8 23:05:38 2015 UTC,"As to which deck to make, you'd probably have to choose one from a specific point in time.

Does that imply the rules of divination are known? If so, I don't know them..."
Malazan,34t6pz,JohnBFD,2,Sat May 9 02:51:33 2015 UTC,I have no idea about if someone has made a deck I kind of doubt it would be cool though. As to the rules I don't think they are never down concretely but as I understand it a practitioner can do a reading and the card's and their order give the reader an idea of which ascendants and there followers are currently involved in the situation around them. Particularly gifted readers may get more information than others an example of this is in GOTM when tattersail does a reading and hears a coin spinning something which taschern totally misses.

Malazan,34sjr7,madcowbomber,2,Mon May 4 07:40:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you've got most of it down, and the story will settle in soon to focus on Paran, Sorry, and the Bridgeburners, Adjunct Lorn, and a crew in Darujhistan whom you'll meet soon, as Moon's Spawn, will be going to defend it.  Warrens are essentially alternate dimensions that radiate different types of magic, which are often aspected to certain races.  One may open a rift into a warren and travel through it and arrive at another location, almost like a wormhole.  The gods are (mostly) just gods.  That said, there are also Ascendants, which are like demigods.  Ammanas and Cotillion are Ascendants.  The gods and Ascendants occupy places in an organized system of Houses, which can be observed using the Deck of Dragons, which is like a tarot card deck.  You saw Tattersail using it to try and figure out what was going on at Pale."
Malazan,34sjr7,hustlegion,2,Mon May 4 07:14:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I hope my misspellings from quick typing wasn't too distracting from my post. I like how complex this series is from the get go. Its nice to literally be thrown into a world that you have to figure out and I think keeps the reader paying attention.  So, are the Gods like on the level of greek gods? or were the gods ever humans at one time? Could Ammanas and Cotillion ever become actual gods, or are they forever capped out ascendants. And if they are apart of house shadow, who is house shadows god?"
Malazan,34sjr7,Montaron87,1 point,Mon May 4 08:18:57 2015 UTC,"all gods are ascendants but not all ascendants are gods.  thats how i see it. And house shadows god is shadowthrone, cotillion is god of assassins. and most of the gods were mortal and some point in their lives. in the malazan world they arent really on the level of greek gods you get some super powerful ones like hood. some ascendants like rake are more powerful than gods, and the gods can be killed."
Malazan,34sjr7,hustlegion,2,Mon May 4 08:49:48 2015 UTC,"Actually, the Greek gods are pretty damn close to the Malazan gods. Greek gods were killable, tried to manipulate humans and influence each other, while not being overly obvious about it.  They picked sides and played games which got a bunch of humans killed. The entire Trojan war for example was started because one of the gods wasn't invited to a party."
Malazan,34sjr7,mmSNAKE,1 point,Mon May 4 10:57:42 2015 UTC,good point. i just meant that a lot of the gods are shown to be much more human and vulnerable in the malazan world. The elder gods remind me more of the olympians.
Malazan,34sjr7,wjbc,1 point,Thu May 7 18:05:30 2015 UTC,"Shadowthrone and Cotillion are considered gods. Difference between ascendants and gods is power gained form worship. Shadowthrone and Cotillion have worshipers, makes them gods with an aspected place and title within the deck.   They both belong to high house shadow. Now the origin of warren of shadow. That is more complicated.  Anyway most ascendants and Gods are just people of different races that become so. However not all of them. There are Elder Gods, which would be too early to discuss what they are."
Malazan,34sjr7,mmSNAKE,2,Mon May 4 17:29:43 2015 UTC,"You're doing well.  Just remember, though, everything you learn comes through the eyes of unreliable narrators, and just because they believe something to be true doesn't mean it's true.  Also, many of the narratives started in GotM won't be finished until later books, so there are a number of questions that won't be answered yet, at least not definitively.  The prologue to GotM is really important, it sets the theme of the whole book -- Whiskeyjack's good advice and Paran's failure to follow it, in particular.  Essentially, Whiskeyjack says don't be a hero, don't attract notice, live a quiet, obscure life somewhere if you possibly can.  The rest of the book shows you why that was good advice, but as the series progresses the question arises whether a quiet life is possible in a turbulent world."
Malazan,34rtks,xCHAOSxDan,2,Mon May 4 00:39:21 2015 UTC,"Did my best to keep this spoiler-free, but let anyone else jump in if I'm too vague or otherwise inaccurate:  I believe that Mappo discusses the origins of The Nameless Ones in House of Cards. They're a cult with ties to Icarium. I'm foggy on how much you know right now, but you will find out more throughout the books, though it always will stay kind of elliptical since you'll learn about them through varying characters' POVs.   Drawing a blank on the eres. IIRC they're a very primitive people? Magicky?   The five gods beneath the Azath are not gods, just really powerful beings currently imprisoned. They're Toblakai, like Karsa, Ublala, etc.  Udinaas was raped by Menandore at the beginning of MT. Trull was raped by a magical eres – I'm pretty sure this was in HoC, though, so it happened later."
Malazan,34rtks,future_forward,2,Mon May 4 03:52:13 2015 UTC,"I'll adress these as they go down.  1).With the Nameless ones, not too much. Mappo dreams about them during Deadhouse Gates, mainly about how they tasked him to watch over Icarium. The Eres, even less. And the people imprisioned in the Azath, the least.   2). Trull wasn't, Unidaas was. Missed it my first time. Don't really know how, loved that book.   3). I suppose keep in mind when this book is set, it takes place before Gardens of the Moon, ending while Gardens is happening."

This is just like that, except the first chapter of the Malazan books is a giant war between two armies of wizards, including an elf on a flying mountain who melts armies with a word.  Then the main characters show up, grab a half-dead wizard, and put his soul in a puppet.  This pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the books."""

Lostara Yil learned it when she was in the Cult of Rashan, and Dancer mastered it when he was alive.  Apsalar gained all of Dancer's abilities when Cotillion possessed her in Gardens of the Moon, meaning she's on par with Dancer (not the Ascendant Cotillion, who gets a buff for being the Patron of Assassins).  We aren't ever shown the specifics of what the Dance does, besides making the user pretty much an unstoppable killing machine.   Lostara has flashbacks of her time in the temple practicing it, and remembering at the time it just seemed like a seductive dance.  From what we can gather from witnessing it, you move extremely fast, are extremely powerful, and it drains you."
Malazan,34m9mv,sonofa2,2,Sat May 2 13:50:36 2015 UTC,"Okay.. I might be incorrect here.. not really sure. And possibly spoiler too. So read with care.

Malazan,34m9mv,Ezzelino,1 point,Sun May 3 01:03:22 2015 UTC,When I think of the Shadow Dance it reminds me of World of Warcraft's rogue's Shadow Step but then on steroids. Just teleporting or running really fast from enemy to enemy killing them.
Malazan,34m9mv,valorcurse,1 point,Mon May 4 17:37:06 2015 UTC,"I think of it as a two-fold sort of thing.  On the surface, it is a dancing style or technique that incorporates profoundly esoteric martial arts movements.  As a result, masters of the Shadow Dance could be extremely adept at close combat, which lends itself to assassination.  Below that, however, I think of it as physically invoking the power of Meanas, the warren of Shadow.  The practitioners on this level would, in effect, be mages of Shadow, utilizing the magic through the channel of the dance to enhance their physical prowess."

Malazan,34k5xe,Undeniably_Bad,17,Fri May 1 21:19:18 2015 UTC,"What you are feeling is normal. Most of us felt this way at first.  Just keep reading and you'll start to piece things together. You may have to give it two or three books until you get used to Erikson's style. Personally it didn't click for me until near the end of book 1.   The dramatis personae and the glossary at the back of the book are your best friends.   Erikson tends to not do info-dumps and can be heavy on the introspective philosophy. The first half of each book is usually character building, plot, history, etc, and the last quarter are when the epic craziness starts and next thing you know it's 4 in the morning and you have to work at 7 but you can't stop now.  He wrote the first book 9 years before the second and it shows a bit, but he is an archeologist and an anthropologist so his world building skills are second to none. Every place a character visit feels ancient, every race you come across has an entire history to it, every millennia-old ascendant has several lifetimes of stories to tell.  You have to piece together the overall arching plot and other things, like how the magic system works, from clues and context of various characters and what you experience through the characters. It's all part of the fun, seeing how all this will fit together and where it's going. You go back and forth between continents and characters and plots. Erikson does not spoon feed you, half of what makes this series so good is the ""Ah HAH!"" moments as you connect the dots closer to the end of each book and throughout the series. Erikson is the master of the slow buildup/epic climax.   It's an amazing, wonderful, crying into the books, epic ride. It's even better on a re-read in its own way. Of course, no series is for everybody, so if you don't like it, at least give it through book 2 or 3, but no shame if it's not for you. I hope you enjoy it!  post your impressions here good or bad, or if you have any questions we'll keep it spoiler free or tell you to read on! It's an amazing series, and definitely in my top 3 fave fantasy series."
Malazan,34k5xe,TriscuitCracker,17,Fri May 1 22:19:54 2015 UTC,"I think without trying to persuade you why you should read this or not I'll lay out the differences for you between the two series. Both of these mind you are in my top five, I do however personally place Malazan at the top.  Anyway here it goes. In Martin's books every single chapter is told through perspective of characters that you get more than generous insight into their minds. You get to see them for who they really are. You are shown their feelings, motivations, urges, hopes, flaws and strengths. Each chapter will follow exactly the character it started with, and it ends with them.  Erikson is similar that he has point of view characters except he tends to flip through them almost like people flip through tv channels (With one exception at beginning of House of Chains). Each Book is divided into 24 chapters (I think there might be an exception somewhere in there?), and each chapter is rather long. So you can expect a great deal of PoV shifting. On top of that shifting isn't very well formatted, at least not in my copies. There will be two blank lines, the only way I was able to determine that PoV shifted sometimes. The other big difference is that you don't get that far into the minds of PoV characters. Some you will, but most you won't. Characters like Karsa, or Trull you will have a great deal of insight but others, umm not as much. So what does this do? This makes it difficult to directly get information pertaining to people you follow. You won't necessarily know why someone is doing what they are doing. At least not from them. You will most likely have to infer it from dialog, or other scenes. There will also be characters that are NEVER fully explained, but mostly you will get to know everyone important very well over the course of the series.  Another big difference is show don't tell. Martin tells you his plot. Erickson shows it. While this doesn't apply to action scenes or some dialog or whatnot, the overall plot that Erikson does is something you don't get on a platter. But don't worry about missing it too much. The only way I can see people missing the bigger bits is if they are deliberately not wanting to see what he is showing. By the end of the series if you didn't grasp the main theme, it's because you didn't care to look, not because as some people will say ""you aren't smart enough"". The details and nuances, hidden messages and philosophy, that might go over your head because you forgot details (don't take that in a bad way, I doubt ANY Malazan reader fully got everything on their first go, there is just so much content there) or because again you don't care for it.  Social issues may be present in both series, however philosophy is not. I'm not talking extreme high level stuff, but more like consequences of actions. Martin for example will explore morality in his books by having characters do some deplorable things to each other by our standards, but he won't ponder on it. He will have it happen and move on. Erikson will most certainly make you digest it. He will torture characters with their decisions to the point it might make you weep (I know I did). His characters will ask questions, of themselves and others, to determine what their actions really mean and do. This does not mean these characters are emo, just that they have moments where shit went so far that it's crushing their grasp of reality.  Scale, trust me on this one Malazan is exponentially larger, with more characters and more games within games. The difference is Martin's sub plots are told directly. Erikson's sub plots you have to hunt down, and sometimes they don't go anywhere because it either is explored in other books (See ICE or future projects), or just life doesn't give a full satisfying conclusion to a problem. Though overwhelming majority of plot threads are tied by the end, all the main ones and most side plots.  Authenticity of PoV. What Martin's PoVs experience is written in stone. Not the second hand stuff like Davos dying. What a PoV experiences, that is what happened. Erikson doesn't always have that. You have to question some of the accounts, though very few of them. And ALWAYS, always question when someone gives you a history lesson. Most of the time it's wrong. Think perspective, these characters know what they were told, what they were told might have been corrupted, they might have been lied to, they might have fabricated it, or misunderstood it. But it also might be the truth.  Foreshadowing, they both do a good deal of it. Though Martin still tries to 'shock' his readers. Erikson left clues for most of the damn thing in early books. I doubt most of the readers pick up on it first time (I didn't). It can be some throwaway remark, some sight of scenery, or just some random bizarre shit that ends up having absolute relevance in things to come.  So the difference in short is this. Martin focuses more on people, and their interactions, the story is there as a vehicle for character growth. The story in itself isn't extraordinary, but the characters are. Erikson while has amazing characters doesn't explore them in such way. His focus is on the story, the story that carries heaps of messages put in dialog, actions and descriptions. Both simple and complex themes explored for those who care to look through a massive tapestry that takes time and effort to observe. Martin's story doesn't require as much thinking and trying to piece together. He eventually gets to everything. Erikson makes you think on everything, because you don't know what might and what might not get directly clarified.   Anyone can feel free to add. I think typed too much so I'm gonna stop..."

Malazan,34k5xe,NickyAndretina,4,Sun May 3 08:24:20 2015 UTC,"Glossary in the back is helpful, but sometimes you just have to keep reading and find out.  Erickson doesn't hold your hand, so no info dumps and somethings may not be clear for a few books, but when it does all come together it is extremely satisfying.  Lastly, don't expect Erickson to follow regular fantasy troupes, he doesn't in the slightest.  It is more like Cook's Black Company series.  Enjoy!"

Malazan,34k5xe,PoorFlory01,1 point,Fri May 1 23:09:25 2015 UTC,"Hey, I read ASOIAF as well before Malazan, I found Malazan in the FAQ of the asoiaf subreddit if I remember correctly.  Keep going, and don't mind if you don't understqnd some things right of the bat. Erikson isn't an author like GRRM, you have to figure some things out on your own. This has it's pros and cons, in the beginning you can be a bit confused, as you said, but you get a lot of ""eureka"" momenta as you go forth.  The first thirs of GotM isnt That good, but the second book/second big chapter in Gotm is already really good. It's called Darujhistan IIRC, and it takes place in the wonderful city of Darujhistan, you may have already read that name.  But yeah, GotM is a decent book, not the best one I have ever read. The next 3 books are in the best fantasy books I have ever read, and this series is awesome in general.   I don't know about you, but I was a huge fanboy of asoiaf when I started Malazan, but I think I like Malazan more. BTW I havent finished the series yet, I am on the 9th book currently, about to finish it.  If you have some specific questions, you could always make a thread here. People usually keep it spoiler free. You could(probably should) read the TOR-Malazan reread after each chapter (google it , I am on mobile). It's really helpful, especially If you are just beginning. It will probably clear most things up, point out some things you didn't catch, and its spoiler free. If you have specific questions, feel free to message me, if you want :)"

Malazan,34k5xe,Fnarley,1 point,Mon May 4 09:48:30 2015 UTC,"well i saw MoI in a library picked it up and read it without having any bloody idea what was going on. I liked it enough to look up the series and found that two books came before it GotM and DG . But yeah i had no bloody clue until i finished GotM cause IMO the first book is kinda just an introduction to the series. introducing the reader to a load of different characters. also they way erikson writes youll never completely lose that feeling of being lost, theres always something that made me feel like "" i have no fricking idea whats happening here"""
Malazan,34k5xe,hustlegion,0,Sat May 2 11:40:28 2015 UTC,"Imagine if someone told you a story based on Earth - they would mention things like cars, computers, Europeans, Asians etc. Unless you are from Earth you would have no idea what these things are and would need to figure them out via context.   That's basically Malazan. A fully formed world, with a full history and set of stories never actually told in the series. One of the most richly padded out fantasy worlds around. But you don't know the history, and need to learn it as you go... So your confusion is normal!"
Malazan,34k5xe,Hhhaamuus,0,Sat May 2 08:12:45 2015 UTC,Soldier through gotm and DG.. Whenever I recommend this series I always make them read at least till end of DG before taking a call whether to continue
Malazan,34k5xe,karsa1987,0,Sat May 2 12:10:44 2015 UTC,"I was forewarned that the series is packed with information and you will get lost.  I made the choice to read each book twice before moving on to the next.  For me it really works, if I get lost I just read on, knowing the next time around I'll understand better.  If that doesn't work for you, and you don't like getting lost, then keep fingers in the dramatis personae at the front of the book and the glossary at the back of the book, keep a log of your questions and check them off when they get answered, and coming here with questions that ask for no spoilers.  Don't just Google the answer, you will find spoilers that way."
Malazan,34k5xe,wjbc,0,Sun May 3 02:47:57 2015 UTC,Just keep reading. A guide would spoil too much. Read the list of characters you can find in the book if you get confused on who is who

TtH rises and falls, but maintaining a steady increase of pace and action until it all culminates with the show down in Daru.. ji...hast..en?.  Also the interrupting narration from Kruppe is so great. 'A breath starts with love and ends with grief.'   Oh man I just want to read TtH again."
Malazan,34hojx,Ezzelino,7,Fri May 1 07:13:30 2015 UTC,"That's actually my favorite quote in the whole series. It so perfectly encapsulates what it means to live, love, and lose all in two little paragraphs of pure poetry.    The soul knows no greater anguish than to take a breath that begins with love and ends with grief. But there are other anguishes, many others. They unfold as they will, and to dwell within them is to understand nothing.  Except, perhaps, this. In love, grief is a promise. As sure as Hood's nod. There will be many gardens, but this last one to visit is so very still. Not meant for lovers. Not meant for dreamers. Meant only for a single figure, there in the dark, standing alone.  Taking a single breath."

Malazan,34g0cu,IWalkBehindTheRows,3,Thu Apr 30 20:55:16 2015 UTC,"1) You're not right on the statues.  Read and find out about them.  There will be more info coming in pretty much every book in the main series.  2) The Hounds of Dark are not related to the Hounds of Shadow.  The Hounds of Dark are the Deragoth.  More of that to come in this book.  The Hounds of Shadow were made by someone else you haven't met yet.  3) So the paths that you are talking about are a lot more complicated than you have knowledge of right now.  The next book, Midnight Tides will cloud the waters a little more.  For simplicity, Thyr is the human accessible version of Kurald Thyrllan and Telas the human accessible version of Tellan (which isn't directly connected to the Kurald warrens). Kurald Galain is pretty unique among the Elder Warrens, but that's Forge of Darkness territory.  Kurald Emurlahn is broken and only exists in pieces.  This affects how it's seen in this world, more to come explaining in the books.  4) Hood's Path is different than the rest of the warrens.  It is not a warren made by K'rull, like some of those other ones.  It's existence is because if Hood, for all we know right now, but that's getting on Fall of Light territory (which isn't out yet).  Keep reading though as it starts to get explained more, and asking these questions to yourself.  5) Shadowthrone's name is Annamus.  He goes by Shadowthrone because he sits the on the throne of shadow.  He's an odd guy.  He also his the throne on Drift Avalii.  There aren't two versions of it. Drift Avalii is also just a normal island that moves."

As much as I love this series it can be really frustrating when you believe that you are starting to understand the inner workings of something and then the rug is completely pulled out from under you. Also, ""Drift Avalii is just a normal island that moves"" made me laugh.  EDIT: I just remembered that the Hounds of Darkness are the D'ivers form of some guy. Is that what the Deragoth are?"
Malazan,34g0cu,sonofa2,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:06:29 2015 UTC,"Stick with the series.  It seriously only gets better.  Also, the whole thinking one thing, then finding out it's wrong, is on purpose.  You're reading this series from the point of view of people on the ground, not usually from the POV of Elder Gods or other Ascendants that have a firmer grip on everything.  You're learning these things, because the characters in the story are literally learning these things as well.  Think about Karsa.  He has spent his entire life with his tribe. He has no idea there are warrens and elder warrens.  He thinks 7 T'lan Imass are his gods.  Just sit back and enjoy the ride.  Enjoy the Jaghut humor, and the time you have with some characters, because they all won't last.   Edit: just saw your edit.  Yes, the Deragoth is the D'ivers of Dissembelakis.  The ruler of the First Empire.  You'll hear about that Empire sprinkled throughout the whole series."
Malazan,34g0cu,sonofa2,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:19:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it really is becoming one of my favorite series of all time. Some moment have already earned a spot on my favorite moments list. Did the same thing happen to the Unbound that happened to Onrack where they were so destroyed that they are now shunned by the rest of the T'lan Imass or did they just decide to go rogue and defect to the House of Chains?"
Malazan,34g0cu,SKR47CH,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:31:14 2015 UTC,"So the Unbound are also the last of their respective clans, hence unbound.  Kind of like how Tool is the last of his clan.

Diskanar and Nifadas poisoned themselves! Turns out they had no faith in Brys defeating Rhulad, and decided to take their own lives rather than be taken by Rhulad. Brys accidentally then poisons himself when he drinks the wine earlier. Though in the latter case it's implied that The Errant/Turudal Brizad nudged him into doing it.   After Kettle sees Udinaas fall into the Azath House, who were the monsters that were fighting in the swamp?    You're going to have to refresh my memory on this one.   Who was the Jheck god that Iron Bars killed? Also, I thought Iron Bars killed B'nagga outside the temple, but then later in the chapter he appears with Rhulad and co at the eternal domicile. Did I miss something?    The Jheck god was a very powerful d'ivers called The Pack. Not too much to say about it. They, like many other powerful beings, had been imprisoned in the Azath, and now that it was dieing The Pack was able to escape. It was waiting for its worshippers to arrive and planning to start a new Jheck empire when Iron Bars put an end to that whole plot. As for B'nagga, I really don't remember. Looking at sources online I just see references to Iron Bars killing him, nothing about him showing up later. You sure you got the right person?   If the Tiste Edur (in the prologue) managed to conquer the whole continent after betraying the Andii, how did they come to be stuck in the northern corner of it while the Letherii thrived?   The edur tribes spent all that time divided and fighting amongst each other, giving other races time to catch up and then surpass them.   When Udinaas goes with feather witch to starvald demelain, he meets his son who is Rud Elalle. Is there a connection there to Shurq Elalle?    There is! A really minor one. It's mentioned very briefly in seperate parts of Midnight Tides. Rud Elalle was initially raised by Araq Elalle and his wife, and they're the ones who named him. They also happen to be Shurq's aunt and uncle. This is of literally no importance and just a random fun fact really.   Do we find out more about the monster that was frozen under the lake?   You will. Eventually."

Malazan,34cwph,Giotto,2,Thu Apr 30 16:44:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies!  Regarding Kettle and Udinaas in the Azath House, I just reread that bit, and realised it was actually the Wyval that had climbed out of Udinaas and gone into the swamp, and then Wither followed. He was talking to Silchas Ruin about wanting to ""drive her deep,"" and to ""bind her again."" Who was he talking about? Also what exactly are Wyvals? I only just realised Wither and the Wyval were different things possessing Udinaas."
Malazan,34cwph,KrugSmash,2,Thu Apr 30 11:43:14 2015 UTC,"Who Silchas is talking about is a RAFO that will be answered in Reapers Gale.  And yea, I was also confused in Midnight Tides because there are 3 entities all with similar names, Wither, Wyval, and Withal.  The Malazan Wikia entry on wyvals is spoiler free;    Locqui wyval were described as having grey-scaled bodies the size of oxen, muscle-bunched necks, taloned hands and feet. Long, sloping heads, the jaws revealing rows of dagger-like teeth and the pale gums that held them. Eyes the colour of clay, the pupils vertical slits.  Like D'isthal'a, Enkar'al and Trol they were the (lesser) spawn of Starvald Demelain."
Malazan,34cwph,parabola01,2,Thu Apr 30 17:30:01 2015 UTC,"The Wyval was fighting off Sheltatha Lore, so that Silchas Ruin could climb out."
Malazan,34cwph,TriscuitCracker,2,Thu Apr 30 12:30:30 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, Sheltatha Lore, I vaguely remember. She was one of the three women whom Udinaas saw in one of his visions, together with Menandore and someone else whose name I forgot. Who are they again and will they be important later?   Argh so many things happen in the book, I barely remember the stuff that happens in the first half by the time I finish it."
Malazan,34cwph,LegSpinner,3,Thu Apr 30 13:56:53 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, this is normal. It's what makes your eventual re-read of Malazan so great, you understand way better all the dots connecting and all the foreshadowing.    If it makes you feel better, you are at the ""halfway"" point in the series. Books 1-5 are essentially setup for the series as a whole. In Bonehunters, all the plotlines and sub plotlines will slowly start to come together, to an epic Convergence with a capital ""C"" in Dust of Dreams and the Crippled God, which are really two books in one.    In Bonehunters, you are heading back to be with your Bonehunter/Bridgeburner pals. What is Tavore's next move after Shai'k? What is the Seven Cities rebellion's next move? What is Dujek's Host up too? Will Fiddler ever realize that Strings is the worst nickname ever? Answers to these questions and more await you! Bonehunters is in my top 3 of the series, and bonus, the usual epic craziness at the end of Erikson's books also happens fairly early on in Bonehunters.   Prepare to sweat. You'll see what I mean."

One of my favorite minor characters.  As for bigger side characters not on your list, I suppose I really like Yedan Derryg, and the two female soldiers (Pithy and Brevity) at the beach with the shake. They have some of the best dialogue in the whole soldier banter theme that appear in the books.   Ps. I know you put Helian on the list. And thats fair! But if she wasnt she would take the pot.

Malazan,34b0zw,TipsAtWork,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:40:22 2015 UTC,"I'd go with ""All Consuming"" - the series is a thing which demands your fullest attention the first time through so that subsequent readings (which you'll need) burnish the skein of your knowledge so that in your mind all the twists and turns of plot are connected as constellations...one's that never dull in daylight."
Malazan,34b0zw,NMiele,1 point,Wed May 6 21:09:16 2015 UTC,"A bit dry, but also the best fantasy series you're likely to read, it manages to be philosophical without being preachy and doesn't assume the reader is stupid by wrapping everything up in nice little packages.   Characters live outside the book in your hands, and move in and out as they have a place in the story, not beholden to artificial limits like most series, demanding that we follow each and every character from start to finish. Consider how many pointless storylines game of thrones and wheel of time follow and think about how great this fact is.   I'd go on at greater lengths ;) the only problem with malazan is that starting a new read through is an epic task on its own."
Malazan,34b0zw,Tevelyn,0,Thu Apr 30 11:51:14 2015 UTC,"Well, most people understand game of thrones. Burn their copy of it. And then gift them Gardens of The Moon. That should do it. Alternatively, you could probably enact a couple of scenes that really got to you?   Jokes aside, I keep telling people that this is by far the only other books I will re/read. Most of them know I don't re/read much. That sets a precedent. If it's a stranger I generally hold out on the spoilers, but tell them how big the authors imagination it would be to create worlds and magic systems. Along with languages and cultures. JRRT did it. Most have seen LOTR. In comparison to the world building and details. I think, personally, LOTR fades away."

Malazan,348s5f,terker,5,Wed Apr 29 05:02:04 2015 UTC,"Just don't listen to Michael Page's terrible pronunciation.  The first narrator of the audiobooks (Ralph Lister) took some getting used to (because of his incredibly scratchy voice), and I didn't like some of his pronunciation, but it didn't actively bother me.  I don't remember Page being so terrible with the Gentleman Bastards books, but he's driving me crazy with the Malazan books.  He pronounces Soletaken (which I've always pronounced as sole-taken, and that's the way I've always heard it) as saul-uh-tok-un (the tok is like tick-tock).  He had said the word 5 or 6 times before I even realized what word he was butchering.  And while I'm bitching about Michael Page, why does everyone that has an accent have to have an Indian accent?  So far, he's given that accent to some humans, a Forkrul Assail, the Jaghut, and if I recall correctly, at least 1 T'lan Imass.  Of the few he doesn't use an Indian accent for, he makes them sound like they are morbidly obese.  I'm really disappointed in the change of narrator, if you can't tell.  EDIT:  Oh, and to answer your question:  Ralph Lister said:  Tist-uh Andee Krupp-uh And the ' in names is a glottal stop.  Just interrupt the air in your throat.  Basically make it like half a syllable of interrupted air.  So it'd be more like T(interrupted air, almost making an ""uh"" sound)-lan Imass."
Malazan,348s5f,AllWrong74,2,Wed Apr 29 07:40:18 2015 UTC,"I agree that Lister is a superior narrator for this series by far. I started the series with the physical book and had pronounced pretty much everything the same as Lister. Page ,by no sole fault of his own since Brilliance Audio should have rectified the problems before release, ruined the audio series for me.  Basically if you can listen to the first three books narrated by Lister you should do so for pronunciation. Somewhere in the overviews of the books there is a quote from Erikson saying the Malazan words in those three are as he himself would pronounce them."
Malazan,348s5f,Boru12,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:30:11 2015 UTC,"I hate Lister's voices, though. The way he does Kalam would've ruined the character for me completely if my first read-through had been the audiobook."

Malazan,34739x,gorkemol,16,Tue Apr 28 20:41:56 2015 UTC,Warrens have a geographical element. The warrens are poisoned on Genebackis. The warrens in Seven Cities are fine. It never spread that far.
Malazan,34739x,SageOfTheWise,3,Tue Apr 28 21:11:23 2015 UTC,i think it was the fact that burn was being poisoned on genebackis  affected a lot of warrens there too.
Malazan,34739x,hustlegion,3,Tue Apr 28 21:34:53 2015 UTC,"Well the Seven Cities warrens were far from fine, they were crawling with soletaken and divers. But they weren't poisoned."
Malazan,34739x,drae-,6,Wed Apr 29 12:23:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not completely sure, but could it have to do with the proximity of the characters in Memories of Ice to the Crippled God's current source of power. That is, all of the characters were on Genebackis, and the Crippled God's ""base"" was in Coral, a city in Genebackis. Someone else might have a more accurate answer, though."
Malazan,34739x,Kaiedos,4,Tue Apr 28 20:46:29 2015 UTC,"The warrens are an imposition on Chaos. Think of it this way. All raw unadulterated power comes from Chaos. All the early Hold/Elder God magic required blood sacrifice which, in a way, gave the Elder Gods the strength to draw this power and order it into whatever useful form.  K'rul used his own blood (figuratively? metaphorically? who knows) to impose order and create the ""modern"" warrens. These became their own realities with their own rules, their own potentials. Wizards interface or cross into those worlds to create their magical effects.  Now here's the answer to your question.... the Crippled God draws on chaos magic - it goes into him and it comes out polluted and poisoned. This poison was spreading through chaos from the Pannion Seer as it's centre.   The warrens are super-imposed on chaos - but chaos can bleed into them - and that's what was happening. The poison of chaos was bleeding into the warrens where they were interfacing with the world.   This is also what was killing Burn... in a way the world itself is one with or tied to Burn's warren. As the chaos-bleed poisoned her warren it poisoned her and thus the flesh of the world. Or it poisoned the flesh of the world which poisoned her. In this case which one follows the other is not really relevant."

Malazan,34739x,Clearly_a_fake_name,2,Wed Apr 29 15:07:55 2015 UTC,IIRC it did.   Not at first but slowly as the Chain of Dogs kept going it got worse and worse. I vaguely remember the Warlocks claiming that they were lucky that the corruption was there or the Rebels would have used magic against them and it is why they use the spirits of the land at one point.

Although I agree that Esslemont isn't as strong as a writer, I feel that his subject matter (the actual Malazan Empire) benefited so strongly from MBotF's descriptions of it and characters reminiscing about Unta; I feel like this is going to end up in my Top 3 books of the combined series, with Toll the Hounds and Midnight Tides."

The first book was more raw than the others in my opinion, and it is pleasant to see his language evolve into a seasoned writer over time.   You'll also get more and more used to his way of writing and telling the story, so I imagine those who did find GotM overwhelming would have an easier time with the rest of the series as they progress."
Malazan,340fcx,chrisanf,3,Mon Apr 27 09:37:15 2015 UTC,"I am currently on Book 3 and I can only say; it gets exponentially better. Even though I preferred GotM over DG, it had more to do with the setting and the story at hand, Eriksons writing and world building however improves over each book."
Malazan,340fcx,HumbleAsFudge,2,Mon Apr 27 09:23:41 2015 UTC,The consensus is that GotM is the weakest book in the series.  Erikson wrote it several years before the rest of the books in the series.
Malazan,340fcx,wjbc,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:05:49 2015 UTC,I am also glad to hear that because I like GotM so far and if the series gets better then I cannot wait for what the rest of the series has to offer.
Malazan,340fcx,midnight_toker22,0,Tue Apr 28 01:22:32 2015 UTC,"That makes me really glad to hear, as I have so far found GotM to be very gripping and not confusing, far better than the previous book I read (Reality Dysfunction of the Night's Dawn trilogy, which I do not recommend). If the Malazan series keeps getting better, then I'm very excited and pleased with my choice."
Malazan,340fcx,karsa1987,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:28:28 2015 UTC,IMO the second book is my fav with books 7 and 8 being mu east fav
Malazan,340fcx,EarinShaad,1 point,Mon Apr 27 10:05:11 2015 UTC,"I personally find book 2 and 3 the best, closely followed by some of the last books. It definitely gets better. Gardens of the Moon is good, but the latter books show much more of the Malazan world and Eriksons talent as both a writer and a world creator."
Malazan,340fcx,lutzenburg,1 point,Mon Apr 27 11:18:18 2015 UTC,I have read all the books. It gets even better. Definity worth it.
Malazan,340fcx,sam1332,1 point,Mon Apr 27 12:48:35 2015 UTC,"I am nearly finished with DG, and in my opinion, it is much better than the first book. I thought GOTM was just ok, but I am really enjoying DG. I was told read to read the first few books and then decide if you are in for the long haul. Hang in there!"
Malazan,340fcx,Dwolf63,1 point,Mon Apr 27 12:55:47 2015 UTC,"In  regards to  the ""overwhelmingness"" some people feel with GoTM.....  .... One of the later editions has an author's comment at the start where Erickson discusses his writing choices for that book.  He says something interesting ... something that I found  to be true when I did my first read-through. ....The writing tempo, the crescendo of events as the book moves on encourages you to race ahead. But the sheer density of what is going on demands that you pay attention and resist the temptation to skim.  I remember  the first time I read it. I was trying  to race through it  like I do with  most fantasy I read...and I was having a tough time keeping track  of  things. During the first  150  to 200 pages I  had  to go  back and reread sections. Even during the middle part, I would find myself skimming ahead  to get back to favourite characters, then having to track back and reread.  I forced myself to  go slower, and that worked until I got near  to  the end  where I started racing again because I couldn't wait to see  what  happened next.   I think the main advantage to a reread is you already know what happens, so you can be more patient and savour the journey itself.  I don't have a ""favourite"" book in the series. There are two or three of them that aren't quite up there with the rest for me. Even then they're probably still better than 95% of the other fantasy out there.  I have a soft spot for GoTM though. I love that book. Each time I reread it, I experience the same kind of emotions as when I rewatch movies like the original Star Wars, or Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's just such a cinematic book."
Malazan,340fcx,Dwolf63,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:45:24 2015 UTC,"How would you rate this series in comparison with other fantasy series (asoiaf, wot, etc.)?"
Malazan,33zibt,sodium_dodecyl,3,Mon Apr 27 02:23:38 2015 UTC,"1) I don't believe it is ever answered completely, but in my opinion it was to return him to his world/followers (the Jade statues that were invading the Malazan world).  By dying, the CG may be able to return to his original world.  It could also have been Cotillion doing it just to remove the Crippled God from the equation, i.e. end his influence on the Malazan world.  I believe there is a mention immediately after the stabbing of a jade light in the sky, which can be seen as the CG's soul leaving.   Also, this action places Cotillion/ST at the beginning and end of the series: the entire thing was a plan set in motion by the two.  We get numerous hints and reminders throughout the series that these two have some much larger game in play, and this was the result of that game.  Their whole thing has to do with altering the relative power/relationship between gods and mortals, and this fits nicely into that theme.  Finally, a lot of different ascendants were trying to use the CG's power to increase their own influence.  Killing him sort of evens the playing field, or at least makes it better for Cotillion.   2) Never answered.  I think he is much more powerful than an ascendant.  Possibly an Azathani related to Shadow."
Malazan,33zibt,Tulkaas,2,Mon Apr 27 02:50:31 2015 UTC,"Edgewalker is one of my favorite characters, and though the ICE books fluctuate in writing quality, they often give really tasty morsels of Edgewalker-related information, nothing overtly explanatory though."
Malazan,33zibt,Tumblehawk,3,Mon Apr 27 16:15:53 2015 UTC,I thought kaminsod had to be released from his mortal body to be able to join his followers (the jade strangers) Don't know about Edgewalker
Malazan,33zibt,Asimov_800,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:32:10 2015 UTC,"The third book of Erikson's Kharkanas Trilogy is supposed to be titled ""Walk in Shadow"" - I'm hopeful that we'll learn more about Edgewalker in that book. The only things we really know about him are that he's ancient, far pre-dating Shadowthrone and Cotillion, and that Curdle and Telorast know of him and are scared of him. Maybe they'd be less scared if they had their Eleint bodies, but I'm not sure.  Personally, I think he's going to play an important part in the Shattering of Emurlahn somehow."
Malazan,33zibt,cuprous_veins,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:44:20 2015 UTC,"Maybe they'd be less scared if they had their Eleint bodies, but I'm not sure.   Even Skinner in his ""god-armor"" was hesitant/scared of Edgewalker"

Malazan,33zibt,Giotto,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:27:02 2015 UTC,"I think Cot's actions at the end of the book are meant to be open to interpretation. Either he ""killed"" kaminisod, or he ""released him"".  I think it's left ambiguous so we can draw our own conclusions. Which theory the reader believes is, I think; a reflection of the reader. Glass half full or half empty?  As to edgewalker, I think he attempted to seize the throne of shadow at one point and failed, and he's continuing to play the long con in an attempt to win it at a later date. I have a feeling that similar to scarabandi, he played a role in the shattering."
Malazan,33yg5a,this_is_theone,7,Sun Apr 26 20:53:56 2015 UTC,"I'm going to echo something you wrote, give it to the end of the book. Yes there's military talk but Duiker and Coltaine's story is fantastic. If you can look past the military minutiae you will find one of the best storylines in fantasy writing. Deadhouse Gates is one of my favourite books so my opinion is slightly biased.  Edit: The military aspect is secondary to developing characters the further you get into the series. It's always there but the characters are the main focus, Memories of Ice is an excellent example of that."
Malazan,33yg5a,dessembrae3,2,Sun Apr 26 21:13:17 2015 UTC,"When I was younger I couldn't stand any kind of shit about the military, even after having been in the military myself. This was a problem up until I had a session reading about various military achievements and historical battles, armies and such. Now my appreciation, alongside having been in the military, is pretty high for Erikson's writing."
Malazan,33yg5a,Morghus,4,Sun Apr 26 21:42:55 2015 UTC,"I felt like this halfway though DG just finish it, it's well worth it. Make your call after."
Malazan,33yg5a,ixosamaxi,2,Sun Apr 26 22:41:09 2015 UTC,"Finish Deadhouse Gates, then after that, decide if you want to pick up the next one.   There's not too much of the military organizational stuff aside from the beginning of this book, and the middle-ish of House of Chains. Once all that groundwork is laid, the stories become far more focused on the characters than they already are. All the things you're complaining about basically just have to be told early on so you can better understand the characters and their relationships, though most of that can also be figured out from the cast lists at the start of each book."
Malazan,33yg5a,CaptainUnusual,2,Sun Apr 26 22:19:49 2015 UTC,"Please let us know what you think when you are done.  I just finished DG myself, started on MoI.  I really loved the story of Duiker and Coltaine, but there's no law that says you have to love it."
Malazan,33yg5a,wjbc,2,Mon Apr 27 02:56:53 2015 UTC,"I'm going to say get through DG and into Memories of Ice. That's the one where the series went from, ""Ehh, this is okay"" to ""HOLY CRAP!!"" for me."
Malazan,33yg5a,JestaKilla,2,Tue Apr 28 22:26:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not reading three books! I've been victim to this before, when people kept encouraging me to read Wheel of Time. I read 4 books of that because I kept being told it gets better (It didn't).  I will read to the end of Deadhouse Gates, if the ending blows me away I may continue.  I don't mean to sound snarky or anything, I appreciate your advice."
Malazan,33yg5a,Giotto,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:43:19 2015 UTC,"Lurking this subreddit, I've noticed that for most readers either DG or MoI is the hook that ensnares them in the web that is this series. They're very different. On my first read of DG, I thought it was slow. MoI gets going very early and does not slow. MoI grabbed me and many others.   A side note, DG I enjoyed much more on a reread."
Malazan,33yg5a,Fnarley,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:26:14 2015 UTC,"Just try and finish DG. The end is worth it, once you have finished it you can decide if you want to read the rest of the series"

Maybe just quit but I, like most of the people on this sub, love the books. They're very character driven (though we meet tons of characters). I'm fairly confident if you keep reading you'll be glad."
Malazan,33yg5a,lilpin13,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:37:23 2015 UTC,I think nearly every Malazan Book has its painful chapters. Push past it and it will all be worth it.
Malazan,33yg5a,Liahkim2,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:09:43 2015 UTC,"I understand how you feel.  I never could visualize the placement of units on a battlefield with how Erickson wrote it.  I try not to focus on where the units are, as much as what is happening in general.  Deadhouse Gates is my favorite of the series and you should definitely finish it.  Don't focus too much on unit placement.  The next book in the series doesn't have a lot of military placement up until near the end of the book, but even then it's not much."
Malazan,33xmjy,_TheRedViper_,8,Sun Apr 26 16:53:04 2015 UTC,"Things aren't completely consistent throughout the series, personally i always attributed it to the characters lack of knowledge.  It mostly affects the first book, but i would argue the first book is also ""just"" the intro and the story gets really going in the next one."
Malazan,33xmjy,kolibrii,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:07:57 2015 UTC,"I mean i like the aspect of unreliable narrators, but someone should be able to tell if that's the case in any situation. (who tells what, is it completely different or relatively close to each other, etc) Generally i am just really nitpicky when i hear about continuity issues and retcons are a total no go for me personally :/ That's why i asked here cause i think even when most people here probably love Malazan, i should get some ""objective answers"" nonetheless. I know it's hard to explain it to me without spoiling things, but would you say he totally changed some things from book one to two/three/etc ?"
Malazan,33xmjy,YEMyself,5,Sun Apr 26 21:41:25 2015 UTC,"There are a couple fairly small details (termed ""GOTMisms"") that Erikson ended up changing or ignoring in later books. One that comes to mind is the magic-deadening effects of T'lan Imass. None of them have any significant effect on the series, so I wouldn't worry about them affecting your enjoyment of Gardens of the Moon or any of the rest of the series.   Edit: As an aside, I'd be careful what you read about the series on /r/fantasy - they may not be as diligent about avoiding spoilers as we are in this sub. Also, avoid the wiki like the plague until you're finished with the series."

I am pretty nitpicky about stuff like this and the comment in the other sub implied there may be pretty mayor deviations ?"
Malazan,33xmjy,HumbleAsFudge,2,Sun Apr 26 21:45:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, they are minor. I just looked them up to refresh my memory, and without being specific, it's really nothing you'd notice on a first read-through, imo. Nothing to worry about. Enjoy the series!"

Malazan,33xmjy,BioChemistryStudent,2,Sun Apr 26 23:11:24 2015 UTC,"Its hard to explain, but its more that events which are eluded to and briefly mentioned, together with many events, histories and peoples which are naturally entertwined will be expanded upon later.  Its more to do with the fact that you as a reader haven't been part of the history long enough to understand all these things"
Malazan,33xmjy,Silmariel,2,Sun Apr 26 17:13:33 2015 UTC,"It is somewhat true but not to the extent of which your thinking right now. Erikson wrote Gardens a while before the other books and that much can been seen pretty clearly after you get a little ways into the series. But most of what happens in Gardens does continue into the rest of the series, it can just throw a lot of people off to read DG and have it be about a lot of different and new characters, something Erikson does several times in the series. What you have to understand about these books though, is characters die, pretty often actually and that is something that can confuse and piss a lot of people off, especially in the way Erikson does it. As you read some characters that you really like will start to die off and he wont spend much time talking about it. Maybe thats what people were thinking of when they say the early stuff is ""retconned"" but its an essential part of Erikson's style and just another part of reading this amazing series."
Malazan,33xmjy,ashkestar,2,Sun Apr 26 17:27:01 2015 UTC,"I more take the stance, that the first book point of view characters are learning right there along side you, and so they are unreliable narrators in the same sense you would be."
Malazan,33xmjy,wjbc,2,Sun Apr 26 19:03:09 2015 UTC,"There are no issues you will notice in a first read through. The issues with timeline and particular mechanics that are not consistently fleshed out only become a source of curiosity and friendly argument and debate with other malazan fans. When there are GOTMism happening they are subtle and do not take away from the book you are currently reading, rather because the world building is SO good, they are things you ponder and try to explain with what knowledge you do have.  What Im saying is, dont frown over passages that are hard to put in context or hard to grasp. Most likely the lore and facts are fine, and you just need to plow on ahead or reread to fully appreciate the context and complexity. In other words, you can trust Erikson, he is not wasting your time. When something is a bit wobbly, I mainly put it down to Erikson not feeling the character or having found a storyline too boring to keep up (I only have one example of this from the last book, so I wont be specific here). Some issues with timeline in the grand scales are also apparent once you really start to knitpick, and certain things are never completely explained, like warrens and holds and their creation. But its ok, because you dont need to know how the world works on every level to be amazed at it. Just like irl."
Malazan,33xmjy,Montaron87,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:55:51 2015 UTC,"As others are saying, it's pretty minor stuff for the most part. A person saying they don't know someone they ought to, or that they knew someone they shouldn't. A very minor character in GotM pops up later as a more important character, but their gender switches. There's only one really major continuity error between GotM and the other books that I can think of, and it can loosely be chalked up to two different people recalling events differently.  Most of this stuff was found by wiki collaboration, not reading through the books on a first go. The lore gets dense, and unsurprisingly Erikson occasionally loses track of a detail or two."

Is he a badass villain absolutely. Is anyone 100% evil? Nope. Is Kallor a narcissistic sociopath? Absolutely. Do I like him as a villain? Yep. Bidithail the monster rapist was a somewhat compelling villain too.

Fantastic character, one of my favourites from any book."
Malazan,33ueea,aleifur,4,Tue Apr 28 19:23:15 2015 UTC,"I like your approach. Since the prolouge of MoI, I have always admired the guy, because of how powerful he was. One of the things that kept me going through Toll the Hounds (which I found incredibly boring up until 70-80%) were his chapters. I am currently on DoD, I hope I will get see more of his badassery.  Is he one of my favourite characters ? I am not sure, because we didn't get to see much of Kallor. I have read dozens of Fiddler, Trull and Tehol chapters, so I can safely say that they are some of my favourite characters."
Malazan,33ueea,SKR47CH,6,Tue Apr 28 20:17:27 2015 UTC,"I will never forgive him. So no, he's definitely not my favorite character. But I do respect your opinion and unique point of view!"

If anything the way he treats the young Tisti Andii in TtH makes me dislike him all the more. The only really sympathetic feelings I had toward him was in the extremely brief cameo he has in tCG in flashback."

Malazan,33up89,Kheshire,11,Sat Apr 25 20:23:06 2015 UTC,"If someone is an Ascendant I'm assuming they're going to turn into a god   They turn into gods if they have worshippers.   And what's the difference between D'ivers and Soletaken, and tied into that is veering when one changes form?   Diver's is one soul multiple bodies (like a swarm of bees), Soletaken has 1 soul 2 bodies (like Anomander turning into a dragon).   Do they have to pass through one of those Houses that Raest is trapped in to become one?   I don't think so. I mean, Treach/Trake didn't go through one when he became the god of war in MoI."

Malazan,33up89,midnight_toker22,2,Mon Apr 27 19:38:50 2015 UTC,Ascension leads to becoming and ascendant (more powerful and whatnot). People can be ascending and it seems great actions and stuff can make that happen. God's have worshippers. They don't have to pass through any azath.  The different God houses are part of a.... Hierarchy? Not sure what word to use. The houses are somewhat fixed. We learn more about this throughout. Some God's exist outside of the hierarchy and don't choose a side/house. The deck of dragons demonstrates this decently.   Divers means transforming into multiple animals. Soletaken means transforming into one animal. Veering is the change.
Malazan,33up89,Aiolus,2,Sat Apr 25 23:25:51 2015 UTC,"To be quite honest, part of the fun of the series is not really understanding what's going on. You get a sense of what different things mean, but never the full picture, which I really love because of the mystery of it. Ascending is still very vague and ambiguous at this point (I'm also on book 4), as are a huge amount of things. Just go with the flow!"
Malazan,33up89,singul4r1ty,2,Sat Apr 25 23:27:29 2015 UTC,A similar important question: How does ascension occur?
Malazan,33up89,shadow793,3,Sun Apr 26 02:40:35 2015 UTC,Ascension is merely the result of gaining power. So any way one becomes 'more than' mortal can begin the path to ascension.
Malazan,33up89,FR05TB1T3,0,Mon Apr 27 01:36:04 2015 UTC,So all of the Ascendants we read about were born as mortals and simply became extremely powerful to become immortal Ascendants? And then those Ascendants who subsequently gained worshippers then became new gods?
Malazan,33up89,midnight_toker22,2,Mon Apr 27 19:48:34 2015 UTC,"Its extremely complicated and convoluted, and never really explained properly. But that's a pretty good way to look at it. But that being said some beings 'mortal' state is more powerful than others. Jaghut vs human, Tiste vs Elient. All Spoiler"

Malazan,33ssjd,wehavedrunksoma,2,Sat Apr 25 07:15:54 2015 UTC,"1) How long has the fractured remnant of Emurlahn been in Raraku, or was it always associated with the Godess?  Emurlahn is in fragments all over the world, the prolouge of Midnight Tides will give some insight into this, as far as I remember.  2) I do not understand why, in a world of terrifying sorcery, everyone is shit scared of some big dogs. They are damned fast, strong and have big-arse teeth. But apart from that they seem frankly mundane and I don't get the horror associated with them. One of them got run over by a horse and struggled to get up, FFS.  In a world with nuclear bombs and other nasty stuff, I would still be terrified to death from a dog like that.  3) Who was the captain that said ""eyes front, soldier"" to Kalam before entering Korbolo Dom's tent? It mentioned he should have been long dead. Are we supposed to know who this is?   Absolutely no idea, I read it a long time ago.  4) Did the Ascendant Hedge really save Fiddler?  Yes.  5) Korbolo's Talon - are they a remnant from the days of Dancer (including Korbolo himself), or a pale imitation dreamed up in more modern times? Did Baudin have anything to do with them? Is Korbolo the real Talonmaster?  Isn't Dancer the Talonmaster ? Baudin was a Talon as far as I remember. They are more like  a remnant as far as I see, but I am only 50% in DoD so it may turn out otherwise.  6) What warren did L'Oric and Osric enter along with the Talon to try and kill the Godess?  I guess it was Kurald Emurlahn.  8) The scene where Heboric was drifting in space was pretty ""out there"". I should have made a note of the names of the ""beings"" that eventually spoke to him. They seemed to have such a routine exchange which was jarring compared with the bloody weird setting (it sounded like it was entirely outside our realm and all associated warrens). Were those beings the jade giants, or the figures trapped within them? It then seemed surprising that a relatively bog-standard terrestrial God like Treach claimed Heboric from this entirely alien place.  I guess it was the giants but I don't really remember that part, and found it really strange even back then."
Malazan,33ssjd,bantuftw,2,Sat Apr 25 18:21:37 2015 UTC,"The fractured remnant of Elder shadow has been overlayed over Raraku for a long time. The whirlwind goddess is Onracks ex-wife. To the best of my knowledge she takes over the remnant shortly after the Tellann ritual, when Kilava flees and Onrack takes the oath.  They're not just dogs. They are thousand year old ASCENDENT dogs the size of a horse drawn wagon. Remember in Gotm two of them destroy an entire company of soldiers. They've been used as the boogeyman to scare kids. They are scary! A former bridgeburner. At this time Kimlocs Spiritwalker song has begun to manifest in Raraku (triggered by Kalam and Fiddler's return to the birthplace of the bridgeburners). The song elevates the passed bridgeburners to ascendency. As Kalam enters the tent he is seeing a dead-ghost bridgeburner who has returned to take vengence on the dog-slayers.  Yes. Same as #3, since hedge is a bridgeburner. Dancer was the original talon master. The Talons were originally developed for external threats. Surly's claw was created as a reflection to deal with internal threats (like a secret police). When Dancer is ""assassinated"" Surly turns on the Talons and eliminates them (less a couple of operatives like Baudins father) with the Claw and expands the claws responsibility to external threats as well as internal ones. Korbolo's Talon is a imitation of the real thing, similar to his use of ""first sword"". Baudin is a real talon, the talon itself, and the training were passed down from his father. A fragment of Elder Shadow. I don't recall Scillara having those mutilations healed, but I do recall treach healing her; I was under the interpretation the healing only covered the recent injuries from her being attacked, but I could have mis-interpreted, even after 3 re-reads. ""Do you remember the Dark"" is a pass code to identify Bidithels servants & co-conspirators among themselves once the conspiracy is a foot, it is a reference to Bidithels penchant for Rashan. Heboric is talking to the beings inside the Jade Statues. Definitely RaFO"
Malazan,33ssjd,drae-,1 point,Mon Apr 27 14:26:33 2015 UTC,"Interesting, as I understood the Talon was ""external to the Empire"" but not necessarily for dealing with external threats. By that I mean, if a Claw sauntered into a military camp and revealed himself as such, he would be deferred to and treated as quite highly ranked. Whereas, if a Talon did the same thing, no one would know what a Talon is, and the Talon would have no official position or rank ""within"" the Empire.   That's how I understood it.   Meaning that, the Talon might also deal with threats within the Empire, but perhaps go about it differently."

The deragoth are an older more dangerous version of the hounds of shadow. They are hundreds of thousands of years old and can destroy entire armies. Thats why People are terrified.  3) Don't remember  4) Yes, RTFO more  5) Most likely a pale imitation, again RTFO  6) I want to say Thyrllan but i honestly don't remember  7)The darkness of her soul, after she was cut she had no reason to live.

Malazan,33qr2f,AllWrong74,2,Sat Apr 25 00:34:28 2015 UTC,"Is this game any good?  I got Dark Souls 1, and they didn't tell me a damned thing.  I don't know what Kindling does, I keep getting Humanity, but the Humanity on my character sheet stays at 0 (but even if I had Humanity, I wouldn't have the first clue what to do with it, because apparently the game designers decided that was yet another thing I didn't need to know).  I have no freaking clue where to go, every time I get into a fight, it seems like I should be much farther into the game to face these guys (for instance, 2 skeletons at once in a graveyard, if you move too far, you activate a third...1 shot from them takes 3/4 of my health bar, blocking them takes a ton of Endurance, dodging them takes like 3/4 of my Endurance, I have no clue how many hits it takes to kill one, because I die so quickly; but it takes more than 2 shots...oh, and those 2 shots take like 90% of my Endurance bar, so I can't block or dodge anymore...if I started out blocking or dodging, I wouldn't have the Endurance to swing my weapon at them).  Needless to say, I gave up on the game, but DS2 looks great, I'm just worried I'm going to waste $59.99 and have it be essentially unplayable all over again."
Malazan,33qr2f,Rhinomeat,4,Sat Apr 25 06:31:09 2015 UTC,"Kindling is to light fires, activating save points. When you save anything you've killed comes back but so do all your health potions.  Humanity is required to bring your character back to life, at a lit campfire. Life is required to forge souls into your weapons to make them stronger.  Lighter armor and no shield will allow you to dodge more often and have your endurance build up faster. As will a lighter weapon allow you to swing many more times and move out of the way.  DS is hard impossible, (At first but once you are slaying bosses you will feel all the more badass for it) persistence is key, and you'll find the game has a frakking surprising amount of depth for a death simulator. Some gentle advice if I may. Grind till your fingers bleed, if you find areas that you don't die in, kill everything and collect the souls (there are some areas where you can kite and kill a few higher level guys then immediately save to re-spawn them and keep collecting, tedious but worth it in the end). Once you die, try to make sure you don't die a second time before collecting your cache. Stick with it and upgrade some armor and your weapons and soon those skeletons in the graveyard will be falling to a single blow from your shining sword.   Try not  to break too many controllers...  Edited to give some advice first then encourage."
Malazan,33qr2f,AllWrong74,3,Sat Apr 25 08:47:42 2015 UTC,"Where do I get lighter armor and a lighter weapon?  The place I'm talking about is just a few steps from the campfire you get dropped off at immediately after the tutorial.  I haven't seen any coins drop, no merchants, no chests, etc.  I'm still wearing starting gear, and these are the first things I run into (after the tutorial, that is).  Where I'm referring to: You start at a campfire on a cliff immediately after the tutorial.  If you go up the hill from the campfire, there is a broken building, the first floor is flooded.  This is like 10 steps from the campfire area.  Just on the other side of the room is a path down a hill.  20 steps or so down that path, there's 2 skeletons that come and kick my ass.  So, where do I go to get better gear?  These are, literally, the first post-tutorial mobs I see."
Malazan,33qr2f,AllWrong74,5,Sat Apr 25 09:08:04 2015 UTC,"There are 2 ways to move forward from the campfire. The toughness of the skeletons is so that you're automatically pushed towards the other path. Look around and you'll find a path going upwards towards Undead Burg. Here the enemies are relatively easy.   Choose your starting class as Pyro, this will also make it easier.   Master the basics of the combat system like blocking, jump attacks, rolling, parrying and blocking (yes I put it twice because its very important especially for a beginner). Once you get used to the combat system of DS1, you will constantly gripe while playing other games like Skyrim.   If you have a friend who has played this game, watch them play for a while or else ask them to teach you the basics about the stats and leveling system (which is not really explained well). You can also read up on the wiki or go to the darksouls subreddit where everyone is really helpful.  Lastly, play DS1, its IMHO a lot better than DS2. You can always play DS2 later on and then maybe even Demon Souls and Bloodborne."

Malazan,33qr2f,AllWrong74,2,Sat Apr 25 09:26:46 2015 UTC,There are actually 4 paths from Firelink but you need to go to the one which leads to Undead Burg. Head towards the cliff face and there will be a slight ramp skirting it.   You will never get anything from breaking pots except for in one specific place.

As I'm not always frantically looking for snippets of information everywhere, I can sit back and enjoy the reading."
Malazan,33rw6n,Phhhhuh,1 point,Mon Apr 27 11:39:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's more linear and easier to follow, written a bit more like a ""normal novel"" than the main Malazan books are. That's very nice, my only complaint about the series is that (while I love jumping around with many different characters) it sometimes gets a bit overdone, making parts hard to follow. So I'd say that FoD has almost all the things that made me love the main series (except Malazan sappers), but no real downside!  EDIT: But there's still Erikson's signum with a lot of interwoven characters of course, it's not like the other extreme like he did with the first part of House of Chains. I heard that he wrote HoC like that because he had gotten so many complaints about his ""crazy"" writing style, and so we were forced to only. Follow. Karsa. With no other character mentioned for that part of the book. That was obviously even worse, probably why he did it to make a point, in FoD he just eased the usual style down a little bit, just about enough."
Malazan,33rw6n,thevorminatheria,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:25:57 2015 UTC,What you said.  But also the fact that you know most of the characters and can make much safer guesses on their motivations and future storylines. You are not working with hints here and there that you need to register for future reference. Everything is more relaxed.

Malazan,33v6gn,FelixViator,0,Sun Apr 26 01:54:03 2015 UTC,I have read the first 2 by the way
Malazan,33v6gn,singul4r1ty,-2,Sun Apr 26 01:42:08 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I read all but a hundred pages of Memories of Ice. And have to say I am mighty disappointed. Where to begin. First the good. The world is imaginative, but seriously the characters need work. Particularly their dialogue. Their are some truely cringe worthy moments. ""I will fail you all.""--Paran. ""Had you not done so Warlord I would have voiced my own threat""...""Harm a child? I would not beat you senseless, I would rip your heart out.""--Whiskeyjack. 'Who will naught but see me as a monster should we even so much as hold hands.'  The characters' go on an on for half a year in their inner monologues, seriously some of those thoughts need editing, you don't need paragraphs of people's thoughts to characterize. Excessive interior monologues bogs the story down. Most of the character's all sound like mouthpieces for the author. They shouldn't all be pontificating, especially if they are less educated or more gruff. The characters by in large felt rather wooden at times.  Secondly, the names are pretty terrible. What the heck is a Whiskeyjack? Trotts? The guy's supposed to become a Barghast Warchief and his name is Trotts? Belludran Skullcrusher? Really? Skullcrusher? Come'on a fifth grader could come up with a better title then that. I realize its a nickname, but its a really stupid nickname. And what's up with Key Chain Shemales. (K'Chain Che'Malle). Are they Shemales with key chains dangling from the necks or what?  Why in the world do characters in the story call female officer's sir? In real world military, calling a female officer sir ridiculous. It is both odd, off putting and rather annoying calling a woman sir.  I did not buy the relationship between Whiskeyjack and Korlat. 'I would seek you as a lover Whikseyjack.' What?  The author didn't let the relationship develop or grow. And by the end, the pathos involving them falls flat.  Seriously, no one saw the guy who basically said I'm gonna kill that little Silverfox as a betrayer; no red flags their. Lets trust him with our battle plans. If you're going to have a character be a betrayer at least mask his betrayal a little bit. I mean the guy was basically having it out with every officer in the book, and no one was like we should watch him a little bit. He might kill someone.  On the whole the story read like a rough draft that needed to be polished. It had some excellent ideas; it just wasn't polished and in some serious need of editing"
Malazan,33v6gn,Xardov,5,Sat Apr 25 23:18:21 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're new to epic fantasy... They're all perfectly valid points if you come at the series expecting an exciting, modern action thriller. That's how things are in this genre and if you accept that, these books become so much better.  With regards to the names, try thinking up fantasy sounding names. It's bloody impossible to get any that sound alright, so I think he's done a pretty good job.  Memories of Ice is also the third book.... Start from the beginning and push through the boredom of starting out.  Gardens of the Moon is the first book."
Malazan,33v6gn,Xardov,1 point,Sat Apr 25 23:31:48 2015 UTC,"I have read Gardens of the Moon and Death House Gates, both of which I really liked. So I expected great things. But I think Scott Erickson had his mind on book 4 and did not properly develop his third book. I've also read a number of Epic Fantasy Books. First Law, Stormlight Archive, Kingkiller Chronicles, Wheel of Time, etc."
Malazan,33v6gn,mykeyboardsucks,2,Sun Apr 26 02:12:49 2015 UTC,I think Whiskeyjack and Trotts are nicknames acquired in the Malazan army.
Malazan,33rqui,conner53,3,Sat Apr 25 00:06:57 2015 UTC,"Bear with me, it's been a while since I read Reapers Gale, apologies if this is incorrect:   1: As a reward for freeing Toc the Younger, in Memories of Ice, Togg returned Onos T'oolan to life.  Spoiler    Karsa's been collecting souls for a long time, he's always been more than just a regular Teblor, I think the soul catching was a side effect of his journey to ascendancy.  Semar perhaps knew how they could be used because of her knowledge as a witch. Fate vs free will is an eternal debate, and Malazan is full of such moments.  Karsa was still his Knight In Chains, there are other, more subtle ways to use him. I don't think the Crippled God really wanted too.  As you probably realize, gods/ascendants and their worshipers dont' always see eye to eye. He trapped him because Mael will upset what his ultimate plan is, and they don't get along.  The place of worship is just where latant power is, to be used to trap Mael.  Nobody really likes the Errant.  This can be confusing, with Icarium you have to ROFA. All will be made clear in Dust of Dreams.  Spoiler   Dust of Dreams and Crippled God are two books in one, where all the subplots and plots finally come together with a CONVERGENCE that will leave you gasping. Toll the Hounds starts off slow and is written in a different style, I have to warn you, it is set almost entirely in Darujistan, but the last 3/4 I guarantee you will be up to 4 in the morning because you can't stop now.   What did you think of Beak? Just curious :)"

After Malazan, it just doesn't do it for me, even though I can clearly see it's a well loved and well written series. I love Sanderson, so maybe I should just stick it out.   I also have a feeling younger me would have loved it when I was in my Dragonlance/Drizzt/Shannara/Eddings era, just starting out.  Maybe I'll give it another go.

Malazan,33q086,PINEAPPLE_BOOB_HONK,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:11:11 2015 UTC,The wheel of time some some serious slog chapters in books 7-10. IT does get better 11-13 but some of the issues of the earlier books carry through until the end.  It does pale when compared to the Malazan serious as it lacks alot of the deeper introspective themes of the books. WOT is the standard good vs evil plot and doesn't explore morality or what it means to be human in any real fashion.

Malazan,33p5w6,Sopp90,3,Fri Apr 24 10:52:17 2015 UTC,"It's amusing. I would list philosophy as one of the series's  best strengths. But hey to each his own.  To me WoT doesn't even scratch this series.  I'd avoid the wikis. They aren't well formatted. Content is all over the place, ton missing, some not particular on the mark and so on. The re-read however should give you a huge insight to a lot of details, foreshadowing, and plot points you might have missed.  Stuff people generally miss is hints and bits that explain the series. If you pay attention carefully in Memories of Ice, it can be deduced from there that Kaminsod was the victim. Korabas was shown in House of Chains, which was a huge hint at the final convergence. Trull's death was foreshadowed. Dassem's identity could be figured out prior to his duel with Rake. Most things could be deduced. One way or another. It's easier to list stuff that can't. Like full story of the Silanda. Azath house in GOTM, Paran ascending. Rake's plan and so on.  But big stuff like figuring out what Tavore wanted, and what the entire conflict was about could be pieced together as soon as Tavore sailed for Lether.  Frankly its easier when people ask questions. The series has so much to cover, and there is so much people can remember :P."
Malazan,33p5w6,mmSNAKE,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:18:41 2015 UTC,"I actually remembered Korabas from HoC, but I didn't realize the significance she would have.  Dassem I caught on to from the way everybody was talking about him during TtH, I was kind of proud of that:P  I did not catch on to Kaminsod being a victim untill very late, but it worked out allright in the end.  I actually enjoyed thinking of him as a traditional big bad wolf, and then having to realize he was deserving of sympathy.  It is really up to us to form an opinion in Malazan, and that is something I like."
Malazan,33p5w6,Enclosedbook,2,Fri Apr 24 18:45:01 2015 UTC,Funny you mention wheel of time. I just finished the Malazan series myself and started the wheel of time a few days ago.
Malazan,33p5w6,absolut696,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:16:54 2015 UTC,"Enjoy the ride!  It's a lot more straight forward than Malazan, but really enjoyable.  WoT will probably feel like a nice vacation or something after Malazan.  The characers grow a lot over the course of the series, and the world gets really fleshed out.  It's just an absolute treat of a story.  Oh, you've probably heard a lot about ""the dreaded middle books"".  Don't sweat it, it's been greatly exaggerated."
Malazan,33p5w6,TriscuitCracker,3,Fri Apr 24 15:56:59 2015 UTC,"I grew up reading WoT, started reading them in the early-mid 90's.  I fell off a bit in college, but luckily those were the ""middle books"".  Last year I buckled up and finished the series.  A tear may have been shed upon completion.  It's amazing how books can trigger nostalgia.  I remember specifically while reading the scene in Eye of the World where Rand and Mat are attacked by Dark Friends in the small village that I was home sick.  I still can remember where I was sitting on the couch, and that my Mom had made me beef stew.  Is was surreal.  I've never had nostalgia overload quite like that ever.  The book literally transported me to a moment in time almost 20 years prior."
Malazan,33p5w6,Brys_Beddict,2,Fri Apr 24 19:14:32 2015 UTC,"Glad you liked it! I can even agree with you somewhat on your complaints, especially the death caring part. The scope and epicness and pure ancient of everything is what draws me to the series.   You should check out the Tor Malazan ReRead of the Fallen. It's in the sidebar, it's a fantastic site where a newbie and somebody who's rereading compare notes on each chapter. Great analysis and commentary.   Just to warn you, Malazn is even better on a reread! You will pick up so much foreshadowing and have many ""ooooooh!"" moments.  You should also check out Erikson's Forge of Darkeness, the Bauchelin and Korbal Broach novellas and Esselmonts series for loads of back story."

Silchas Ruin spent the better part of two books bringing him along, then changed his mind and sent him away. Someone let me know if I forgot something here. It's as you said. Well, I always thought the picture was of Fener's death over the skies of Kolanse. Not sure if the guy in the front though is anyone specific. Don't remember specifically... warrens maybe? Not to mention half of them are dragons. I don't remember the context of this question at all, you're going to have to explain in more detail. Some take place right at the end or after. There's also going to be a sequel trilogy of sorts focusing on Karsa, once the prequel trilogy is done."
Malazan,33od3e,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Fri Apr 24 05:21:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the help, and number 5 is referring to the second epilogue where Fiddler is an old man living in malaz city. When he is talking to the boy he says something along the lines of ""just been awhile since we last talked"" referring to the demon at the bottom of malaz harbor. Just something minor that i was confused as to why Erikson added to the very end of the series having heard nothing about it before, but i suppose that's in true Erikson style isnt it, leave us guessing and hungry for more."
Malazan,33od3e,Silmariel,2,Sat Apr 25 06:52:52 2015 UTC,"1) Pretty sure Ruins' plan worked and Ryadd is on the sidelines. In the end he is with Hetan, the twins, Udinaas etc chilling - happy ending for him 2) I believe that the crippled god cannot return to his home along with his worshippers stuck in that body (Remember krul telling heboric someone else will be needed before this is over). Killing his mortal body allows him to ""reascend"" and in effect leave with his followers. I'm not sure wether Cotillion and Tavore had their own agenda here because the following convo between Cotillion and Kellenved sounds a bit as if, Kellenved is saying; well ok, I guess I see why you did that, and I am ok with your choice. (It did not sound like they were going into this showdown with a mutual agenda of killing Kaminsod asap) 3) donnu :) 4) After finishing up on the shore, and dealing with crazy sandalath, they arrive through portal. I distinctly remember Nimander and apsalara arriving together with their people, apsalara seeing whats going on, and thinking fuck, lets get out of here, but then Korabas arrives and all the warrens are shut down, no portals no exits. - Silanah, nimander and korlat and the other eleint are caught up with tiam and swarming. Apsalara goes to wait it out. 5) The demon from the old flagship that went down in the malaz harbor - The Twisted - Tavore remarks on it when she encounters the supposedly dead old admiral Nok. I do not believe Fiddler is ever seen chatting with this demon and I think he means it figuratively when he comments on it at the end of the last book. 6) Yes, the last 2 books happen after. You should read them all though. Also The Black Company is an awesome choice to soothe Malazan withdrawel syndrome :D"
Malazan,33od3e,TisteSimeon,1 point,Fri Apr 24 12:20:03 2015 UTC,"That is such a boring end for the badass character Ryadd could have been, to have him join in with the storm silchas and tulas made would have been a very cool ending for him. It just seemed like alot of buildup from the last two books to the huge letdown that was his ending.  And thank you for trying to answer all my questions, really helped a lot."
Malazan,33od3e,TisteSimeon,1 point,Sat Apr 25 06:40:40 2015 UTC,I don't know the answers to all your questions but most ICE novels happen before the end.   NoK: before GotM. RotCG: before TTH. SW: around the same time as TTH. OST: after TTH/during DoD. BaB: around the same time as DoD/tCG. Assail: after tCG.
Malazan,33od3e,TisteSimeon,2,Fri Apr 24 04:51:40 2015 UTC,"From the title im guessing assail deals with the forkrul assail. Again just guessing here but perhaps on the continent of Assail although i could be completely wrong. I think if i knew Assail would continue the story lines of some of my favorite characters it would give me more of an incentive to read the other 4.  Like what happens to Silchas and the hust sword with those dragons inside it; seems to me following that story would be immensely entertaining.  Or whatever Hood decided to do at the end of it all, he seemed to have a very minor role in the convergence for such a hugely powerful jaghut and incredibly important character to the plot. Like the only thing he did was watch gesler die and kill the really weakened sister reverence that it seemed any mediocre character in the entire series could have done."
Malazan,33od3e,Lankles,1 point,Sat Apr 25 06:49:10 2015 UTC,"Assail is about the continent of Assail. The Forkrul may or may not make an appearance. ;-)  I think reading ICE is worth it even if for nothing else it rounds out the series nicely, gives you insight into other characters you only hear about in the main series (eg SW is all about Greymane) and finish off certain other plot lines (like who are the seguleh?)  It may not answer all the questions you have but there are more Malazan books to come!"

Malazan,33nt2x,wjbc,12,Fri Apr 24 01:06:12 2015 UTC,"The first question I have is how things ever got so out of hand in the subcontinent of the Seven Cities, and why a fool like High Fist Pormqual was in charge.    Ok long story time. This all comes in small snippets throughout different books, but its good to read in one place. So, in Kellanved's original crew, a good portion of them were a group of Napan refugees lead by Laseen. While they spent all that time as one group, working under Kellanved, Laseen was always sure if it came to it, her people would chose her over Kellanved. This was her big assumption when she took out Kellanved and Dancer and took over the Empire. She'd have to get rid of all the skilled higher ups that were loyal to Kellanved, but it would be ok because she'd still have the backing of that original Napan subgroup that made up much of the Old Guard, and that would be enough to effectively run the country.  She was completely wrong. They all jumped ship (literally) on her basically in disgrace of her actions. These are all the ones that infamously all suddenly independently drowned. (aside: Even the method of faked death was meant to be an insult to her. They're all from the Napan Islands, and were more or less pirates before the empire was formed, and all known for their swimming abilities. Fake death by drowning was basically saying 'we don't even respect you enough to make this convincing')  Laseen was left with almost no support she can trust to run the Empire, she had to turn to the largely ineffectual nobility to fill in the gaps because there literally just was no one else. And she needed the backing of the nobility to keep her in power anyway at this point. This went on for years and really hurt the Empire as you had nobility paying their way into powerful roles and then sucking at it. This is the reason we have leaders like Pormqual. (This is also why a lot of the bridge burners hate Paran in the first book and aren't surprised he's killed on arrival, they assume he bought his position instead of earning it because he's a noble). She can't replace Pormqual with someone good because there is no one good spare to give. She has precious little and they're all tied up in other wars in other continents. Laseen has only recently been able to start to react to these nobility issues, as we see with the culling of the nobility.    The second question I have is why warrens weren't used to send help to the Seven Cities -- not just subtle help from the Claw agent Pearl, and a little help via the Trygalle Trade Guild, but real help on a large scale. Or why didn't an agent of the Empire get rid of Pormqual and put someone competent in charge?   The warrens are generally really really dangerous. It's not too bad traveling between two cities maybe, but Quon Tali to Seven Cities is immense. There's a reason the Trygalle Trade Guild is so incredibly expensive and full of lunatics. And again, there's no one to send. The latter point is the bigger sticking point here.   Frankly, I also found the whole idea of declaring Dujek Onearm and his army outlaws as a subterfuge implausible. Again, maybe I'll learn more later, but so far I've seen no reason they couldn't work with other armies against the Pannion Seer without first being outlawed.   The combined Genebacken forces despise the Malazans. The Malazan's have been waging war all over their continent and trying to take over their homes for years. This is one of the most diverse armies in modern history, full of people who would never have a reason to be allies, but the Malazan's have just been such a huge threat that its pulled all these groups together. The leaders might have been able to see past this and known the Pannion as the greater threat, but that means little if your army turns on you. They need to distance themselves from the Empire to even have a chance at trust.   It also feels a bit cheap to me because in Gardens of the Moon it was clear that the Empire wanted to get rid of the old guard, the Emperor's loyal troops and mages -- and did get rid of many of them. That was no subterfuge. Am I now to believe it was all just a tragic misunderstanding?   I'm not exactly sure what your issue is with this part. Or what exactly has been talked about at this point either, so I could use a refresher there.   Crokus seemed as if he did not have enough to do.   I remember having the same thought. It's realistic of him, but it can be a disappointment if you were a fan of him from GotM. He's just a boy chasing a girl through a story much larger than himself right now. There's not really any place for him in the story, but he has to be there because he has to come out the other end. He'll eventually come into his own as a character though."
Malazan,33nt2x,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:57:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, I figured we would get more information in later books, and it does make sense that with all the purging that's been done, Laseen might be short on leaders she can trust.  Still, at the beginning of the book we have nobles being send to a labor camp and at the end of the book we have purging going on in the Claw (through Kalam), and Topper and the Empress don't seem too upset about it."
Malazan,33nt2x,woetothedownpressors,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:19:20 2015 UTC,"Interesting summation. I do have a followup question though. If Surly/Laseen came to rely on the nobles then why have those purges periodically, where entire families would be culled, like the one Tavore supervised in Deadhouse Gates? After all, if the nobility is what bolsters her power then it makes no sense to undercut the power."
Malazan,33nt2x,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Fri Apr 24 05:37:24 2015 UTC,"As time went on her rule became more secure enough to afford it, and the nobility became cancerous enough to necessitate it. Though too little too late it seems."
Malazan,33nt2x,woetothedownpressors,1 point,Fri Apr 24 05:40:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that. I would have imagined the the nobility would have put in place certain contingencies. I mean what happened to Unta's royal family, should be an indication to some that Laseen could make for a dangerous bedfellow."
Malazan,33nt2x,SageOfTheWise,2,Fri Apr 24 05:50:10 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I never was clear on how she got away with culling the nobility, for the obvious reasons. Though maybe that's what having an assassin secret police is for. Something I should look into more."
Malazan,33nt2x,compiling,1 point,Fri Apr 24 05:59:50 2015 UTC,"Nice summary.  I believe the references to the old guard being eliminated were really those drownings you talked about.  And also a bit of what happened to the Bridgeburners and mages at Pale.  So, yeah.  Rumors aren't always completely accurate."
Malazan,33nt2x,Dwolf63,6,Fri Apr 24 13:29:43 2015 UTC,"Why large scale support couldn't  be sent by warren:  Among other things, an event  known as ""the path of  hands"".  As  we saw in the book, where the warrens  were interacting with Seven Cities, many of them were seething with Soletaken and D'Ivers all trying to make their way to the throne they were seeking.  But this is just icing on the cake.  As was said previously, warren  travel  can be dangerous at the best  of times. It's one thing for the Claw to use it - individuals and  small groups can travel without drawing too much attention from the denizens of those worlds. It's another thing entirely to try to march an army through one.  You'll get a better sense of the potential hazards  as  the series goes on."
Malazan,33nt2x,internet_enthusiast,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:29:05 2015 UTC,"I just remember in Book 1 Topper was saying that the Empire could use the Imperial Warren to manage its vast possessions.  Turns out, not so easy."
Malazan,33nt2x,notthatnoise2,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:41:19 2015 UTC,"Topper was saying that the Empire could use the Imperial Warren to manage its vast possessions   And it does; claw agents use the imperial warren to travel to far flung parts of the empire to make the empress' wishes known and to keep local administrators in line.  Moving an entire army using the same method would be magnitudes more difficult, however, which is probably why it isn't even discussed as a possibility."

Malazan,33nt2x,cantlurkanymore,2,Fri Apr 24 12:42:02 2015 UTC,The outlawing of Onearm's Host is explained by the fact that the Malazan empire on one side and the Tiste Andii and Brood's army were at war with each other and the only way for the two to combine forces without a shitton of bs was for Onearm's Host to be outlawed and thereby distancing themselves from the empire.

Malazan,33npzd,Tragyn,14,Fri Apr 24 00:39:26 2015 UTC,"Basically, if you died in the sword's warren, then you were dead for good. Anomander let the situation get as bad as it did, with the forces of chaos literally at the doorstep, so the more nasty people in the sword would be forced to fight and die more permanently. Anomander sacrificed himself to unchain the gate of darkness and basically undo the issue's Draconus caused in the first place, and is also for realz dead. Then Caladan Brood broke the sword, and everyone chained in the warren but still alive (ex: Apsalara, Draconus, Hood) were freed and returned to the normal world."

Malazan,33ksgn,Dannick,2,Thu Apr 23 12:42:40 2015 UTC,Might want to note what books those spoilers are for.
Malazan,33ksgn,Silmariel,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:26:11 2015 UTC,True that not even considering highlighting those lines
Malazan,33ksgn,Dannick,4,Fri Apr 24 01:04:02 2015 UTC,I think Kallor is pretty evil. The amount of terrible things he does for no other reason than to assuage his own ego...
Malazan,33ksgn,Silmariel,9,Thu Apr 23 12:57:47 2015 UTC,"No he isnt. He did some pretty terrible stuff, and then was cursed to eternal life while his body decayed with time, only preventing his body from dessicating through his weird medicine. Everything he tries to build, even things he might have been able to redeem himself through are cursed to fall to bits around him. It has definately made him vengeful, but he still has honor and even mercy, in him. I feel empathy with him, having read all the current books out there, I dont find him evil.   The only creatures that I think Erikson is giving the black and white treatment or atleast has done less nuanced are Hairlock (the puppet) and Clip, and perhaps some side characters in the scenarios surrounding Coral later on. - All the heavier players have nuances, backgrounds and thoughts that allow us to find empathy for them. I dont think evil allows for that. I am also sure its completely deliberate that Erikson writes like that.  The best example of this is the Forkrul assail. Most reasonable people would probably think they are pretty evil maybe even insane, since it boggles the mind how they can conclude that killing people equals justice in every scenario. But they are not evil. They are just not human, and our morals have no place in their way of viewing things. spoiler  Also many of the ascendants can seem callous, uncaring, cruel and perhaps even evil. But they are not human, and why should they adhere to what we think is right or just. - It throws the mind for a spin but I think I enjoyed the books more when I dismissed judging the characters in it."
Malazan,33ksgn,Oathsend,9,Thu Apr 23 14:10:03 2015 UTC,He was a cruel enough ruler that three gods agreed to remove him from power.   He responded to this by burning a continent and all of its inhabitants.   I'm not saying he wasn't also a person with motivations and reasons behind his actions. Everyone is the hero of their own story.   But he murdered millions of people.
Malazan,33ksgn,Dannick,3,Thu Apr 23 14:37:22 2015 UTC,"spoiler  Dont get me wrong, I completely get the satisfaction of just dismissing Mallick or Kallor as evil sons of bitches. But in my opinion that seriously subtracts from what you can get out of reading about them without judging them. Anyhoo, I guess we disagree on Kallor, but hey, thats totally fine. You obviously like the books alot, so it must mean there are many different ways to read and percieve the characters therein without it ruining the goodness of the stories :)"
Malazan,33ksgn,Oathsend,5,Thu Apr 23 14:50:35 2015 UTC,"Kallor wasn't the one who burned his Empire - the mages that rebelled against him did. He was a terrible, tyrannical king, and for whatever reason those mages felt that bringing down hellfire was a suitable retribution for that. MoI prologue  Obviously you could say that his actions are what led up to this, but it'd be a bit of a stretch to claim that Kallor wanted the empire that he had complete control over to end up as a smoking ruin."
Malazan,33ksgn,majiinbuu,10,Thu Apr 23 14:50:02 2015 UTC,"Kallor: ""Thus, what you would refuse me, I now refuse you.""....""[Jacuruku] Is no more and never shall be again. What I have unleashed will never heal.""  Kallor clearly takes responsibility for the destruction, whether by his word or by his hand."
Malazan,33ksgn,Silmariel,4,Thu Apr 23 15:16:40 2015 UTC,"Huh. You're absolutely correct. It's pretty clear after rereading the MoI prologue again.  I'd like to know how he caused all that, though. Especially since he's never been shown to be a mage.  MoI PrologueMT Spoilers"

Malazan,33mgj9,Tumblehawk,3,Thu Apr 23 18:41:42 2015 UTC,"Personally I consider Stonewielder to be his best, and Assail to be really good as well. BaB just seemed like filler on several layers to me. I enjoyed it more than most people seem to, but it just seemed like a cursory jaunt through a continent that hadn't been visited yet and there were a lot of dull parts and more hand-waving than usual. I'd say it was alright. RotCG was also alright to me, mostly because I really liked the story but the writing was pretty weak and it contained perhaps the single totally pointless plotline in the entire Malazan written world. OST was also really cool, though it took a while for it to get going in my opinion."
Malazan,33mgj9,dishwasherlove,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:22:41 2015 UTC,Opinions and all but I agree . I would call BaB 'fine'. Good if you want a further look into the Malazan world but not earth breaking. Will be interested to see what OP thinks of Assail after it being hyped up so much in every other book.
Malazan,33mgj9,Jragghen,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:45:22 2015 UTC,"I feel like with ICE, it's necessary to differentiate between quality of writing and interest in content. I think that each novel, he consistently improves his quality of writing, with Assail being the peak. However, many of the books seem to shift up and down in how much their actual content interested me - BaB suffers because, while it's while written, I didn't find the story to be as gripping as some of the earlier ones. On the flipside, I think RotCG might have actually interested me the most, even if he was still a bit unpolished then.  Assail seems to be in the sweet spot on those two spectrum."
Malazan,33mgj9,strawberrysundaeandt,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:25:35 2015 UTC,I enjoyed it too and finished just the other day. I liked the Crimson Guard arc more than the others though.
Malazan,33mgj9,Aiolus,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:06:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know - I dig the Disavowed, but I never found Shimmer or K'azz to be compelling characters in all the time we've spent with them. I'm a huge fan of Petal, he's awesome and I'm glad to see him listed in the Dramatis Personae for Assail.  I liked the Crimson Guardsmen in Stonewielder too - Bars, Blues, etc. Just not sold on Shimmer and K'azz like I said."
Malazan,33mgj9,anointed9,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:32:39 2015 UTC,"NoK and Stoneweilder are my favorites. BaB is by far my least favorite. It was so uneventful.

Malazan,33mgj9,semt3x,1 point,Thu Apr 23 23:04:38 2015 UTC,I thought blood and bone was mediocre at best. I guess to each their own. But I found it was slow and got super bogged down
Malazan,33mgj9,wazir,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:08:45 2015 UTC,"I found OST to be a bit of a let-down considering it had so much potential, then started Blood and Bone and feeling a bit lost I stopped with the Malazan world and that was a while ago, guess this might make me revisit it sooner rather than later."

Malazan,33k412,BruceLazer,10,Thu Apr 23 04:00:01 2015 UTC,Their relationship is one of my very favorite parts of the entire series. You can feel the love and friendship. So we'll written. I had misty eyes many times because of those two.

Malazan,33k412,wjbc,3,Sat Apr 25 22:55:22 2015 UTC,"It is really hard to find a friendship in any other book series that is so beautiful, yet so tragic like the one between Icarium and Mappo.   Icarium himself is definitely one of my favourite characters in the whole series. The way he desparately is looking for his past but constantly failing, grasping at sand grains with his machines and the terrible rage that makes him destroy whole countries... Yet in his heart he is a good guy. One of the best in the world of Malazan."
Malazan,33kyqp,microcosm315,3,Thu Apr 23 11:01:58 2015 UTC,"Its how I read it too,  regarding the chaining, there has been several chainings as he didnt come down in one piece as seen in the prologue,  and seeing as they didn't know what else to do and probably feared his wrath if left to heal chaining him was what they chose to do,  quite a lot of explaining it is RAFO though."
Malazan,33kyqp,DAMCARDLE,1 point,Thu Apr 23 11:49:06 2015 UTC,Got it!  I did understand the part I think where Itkovian also took on the grief of the murders that happened at Capustan.  In addition to being helped by Paran - was he also aided by the Bhargast gods?  The plot is moving but getting thicker by the page.  I can see why the series took ten main books to come to a conclusion.  Guess I should have kept my topic a little broader - another question -   Do we ever find out if there are powers above or greater than the Elder Gods?  K'Rul seems to be a fairly powerful part of the story - but - under Kallors curse...
Malazan,33kyqp,DAMCARDLE,2,Thu Apr 23 12:18:10 2015 UTC,"I don't recall Paran helping him much but he is getting to the point where his actions have unforseen consequences, the Barghast gods are wanting his blessing as the Master of the Deck but really most of your questions here are done by the end of the book. There is but one God,  and that is the great god of the Bhoka'rala! (RAFO then LOL)"
Malazan,33kyqp,DAMCARDLE,0,Thu Apr 23 12:26:53 2015 UTC,"Ahh - the flying monkeys - should have known!  In regards to Paran - he put his hand on Itkovians shoulder and seems to have brought him back to the conscious world.  That's the help I was referring to.  No gods answered Itkovians call for help - only Param ""touched"" him."
Malazan,33kyqp,DAMCARDLE,2,Thu Apr 23 12:36:42 2015 UTC,"I remember now, I guess its opening to interpretation as to whether he actively aided him through his role as Master of the Deck or was just a mundane physical interaction that brought his attention back to the real world?"
Malazan,33kyqp,Montaron87,0,Thu Apr 23 13:31:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Interesting though that is was Paran that ""answered the prayer""..."
Malazan,33k2au,CodyTheAwesomeOne,5,Thu Apr 23 03:43:03 2015 UTC,"Try to get ahold of the text one way or another, lot of names that would be easier to remember if you actually see it written out.  This is a military campaign fantasy where you will follow soldiers, their military conferences, and their battles. It is very different from ASOIAF, family houses are not as prominent and there is no theme of knights or heraldry.  It can be confusing, but remember this: this is a series meant to be reread. A lot of names and events won't mean anything to you now and that's fine just push through. If you can stick to it, you'll hit a big payoff.  You dont have to read them all in a row. Feel free to read other books in between the Malazan books, its long and its nice to take breaks with books youve been dying to read."

Malazan,33k2au,sleepinxonxbed,1 point,Thu Apr 23 04:59:15 2015 UTC,"No problem! Also some more things to mention, there are a lot of characters.  There are hard shifts between books since each book has their own cast of characters to follow and some people are really turned off by that because just when   they feel comfortable with the characters and pick favorites you're given a new set of characters in the next book. But don't worry, Erikson does his best ti make sure all his main leads are likeable in their own way.  Book 1 and 3 take place on the Genabackis continent. Book 2 and 4 take place in the Seven Cities continent. Book 5 takes place on a third continent (and occurs simultaneously as Book 1), and 6-10 will weave all three storylines together. I'm currently on book 4 and it's my favorite so far because its just so much easier to read than the first three."
Malazan,33k2au,GaslightProphet,1 point,Thu Apr 23 05:10:51 2015 UTC,"Is there a particular reading order that's recommended? Should I read straight through, or 1, 5, 3, 2, 4, 6-10?"
Malazan,33k2au,sleepinxonxbed,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:24:13 2015 UTC,"Read them in the order they were published so 1-10. With the exception of book 5, the series is fairly chronological. Each book has references to the preceding book despite taking place on different continents."
Malazan,33k2au,UGHfineILLjoin,6,Thu Apr 23 22:05:26 2015 UTC,"Buckle up Dorothy, because Kansas is going bye bye.

Malazan,33k2au,journeyinthedark,2,Thu Apr 23 04:30:18 2015 UTC,"The best tip for listening to this series, I think, is to have a physical book as well for character names, spelling, as well as spelling of places, races, and pretty much everything. Also it is good to have the maps. A warning as well since your using Audible. Audible has Brilliance Audio's performances of the series and even though Ralph Lister did an amazing job they change narrators after Memories of Ice (book three) and it is a very abrasive change."
Malazan,33k2au,Lexandru,1 point,Thu Apr 23 18:39:29 2015 UTC,"The Prologue is extremely important.  The characters are important, the set-up is important, the dialogue is important.  The theme of the whole book is spelled out in the Prologue, but if you don't may attention, you may miss it, because it doesn't seem that important at the time.  It is important.  After some more set up, also important, the story eventually reaches the siege of the city Pale.  Then it turns to the city Darujhistan, and dwell there for the rest of the book.  In Darujhistan we meet characters on the other side of the conflict, leading to a situation where it's difficult to tell for whom we should be rooting -- that's intentional.  Some of the stories will not be resolved in this book.  Many mysteries will not be explained in this book.  The whole book ends with a cliffhanger.  However, some stories will be resolved in a spectacular manner."

Malazan,33dpmk,EarinShaad,1 point,Wed Apr 22 07:21:57 2015 UTC,"Pust and Kruppe are on the same continent as of Toll the Hounds. This could concievably happen, and I can also see Tehol coming to Geneabackis to help Karsa bring about the end of the world."
Malazan,33dpmk,Nichase,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:09:25 2015 UTC,You're on the right track.
Malazan,33dpmk,SKR47CH,2,Wed Apr 22 15:17:41 2015 UTC,"Definitely these three guys.  And I also love reading Karsa's story arc, it seems riveting and of its own... ALSO Fiddler/Strings. Or any of the marines/bridgeburners. They're so gritty and nuts I love it."
Malazan,33dpmk,brandonszalony,1 point,Wed Apr 22 07:59:30 2015 UTC,Iskaral Pust without a doubt.
Malazan,33dpmk,lowfat32,24,Wed Apr 22 19:45:17 2015 UTC,No mention of Fiddler yet? I mean he might not be as humorous as Tehol or Kruppe or anything but I can't help but love him
Malazan,33dpmk,Perpli,7,Tue Apr 21 22:12:02 2015 UTC,I'd marry Fiddler.
Malazan,33dpmk,lilpin13,5,Wed Apr 22 03:47:20 2015 UTC,"Fiddler is easily in my to three favorites because he's not some sort of unstoppable ass-pulling super saiyan of a character. He's a fairly average, yet capable, soldier. He gets thrown into a less than favorable leadership position in one of the most dangerous scenario on the planet. He's unsure of himself, but he does his job, gets shit done, and more or less sees his squad and the greater army through maybe the most pivotal events of the history of the Warrens. I love him because he's really nothing special in the grand scope of the world."

Malazan,33dpmk,Sopp90,7,Tue Apr 21 19:38:16 2015 UTC,I always liked Iskaral Pust's mule.

Malazan,33dpmk,Sopp90,3,Tue Apr 21 20:11:03 2015 UTC,What about his donkey? I'm fairly sure that donkey holds some sort of record for erecting a tent without fingers
Malazan,33dpmk,Jarche,31,Tue Apr 21 21:13:12 2015 UTC,"Tool and Toc. That's one character. They're alright separately, but their mutual story arc is just so moving."

Malazan,33dpmk,MrCaptDrNonsense,7,Wed Apr 22 15:25:20 2015 UTC,My favorite character?  Definitely Quick Ben.
Malazan,33dpmk,increasingly_purple,6,Wed Apr 22 11:24:12 2015 UTC,Sgt. Hellion is highly under rated. I regularly snort out loud after her comments.
Malazan,33dpmk,theodorferdinand,2,Wed Apr 22 22:33:01 2015 UTC,yes! And she just gets better and better.
Malazan,33dpmk,ilikealphabitsoup,13,Thu Apr 23 22:15:19 2015 UTC,"I hate Kruppe.  I find him tiring and boring and his dialogue, while funny at first, feels more and more punishing to slog through every time he speaks.  His conversations with the Rhivi woman made me want to close the book; in fact, she's my second least-favorite character.  As for favorites, I'd have to go with Itkovian.  I've always loved the ""paladin"" archetype in fantasy and I think Itkovian personifies it to a T.  I cried more from MOI"
Malazan,33dpmk,Brys_Beddict,5,Tue Apr 21 23:40:09 2015 UTC,I'll give you three guesses.
Malazan,33dpmk,Jhippelchen,12,Tue Apr 21 20:13:16 2015 UTC,"Will I get banned from this place for admitting that I don't like Kruppe?  My favourites so far (halfway through Midnight Tides) are Anomander (for somebody half as old as time itself, and extremely powerful, he's refreshingly normal), and Tool."
Malazan,33dpmk,xshare,37,Tue Apr 21 19:15:38 2015 UTC,Everyone has their own unique tastes beloved and honest friend Jhippelchen. Why one can no more punish you for disliking uniquely talented and magnanimous Kruppe than he can hold it against this delicious pastry for only being able to be enjoyed in all of its creamy deliciousness but once!
Malazan,33dpmk,notthatnoise2,5,Tue Apr 21 21:18:06 2015 UTC,Yeah... Text like this is exactly why I don't like Kruppe.   EDIT: I can just imagine his fedora and neckbeard.
Malazan,33dpmk,xshare,4,Wed Apr 22 13:22:46 2015 UTC,"If that's the attitude you're imagining, I think you've misread the character. He's supposed to come of as a goofy idiot, at least outwardly that is. None of his friends or companions think he's more than a wordy annoyance. The point is he's just pretending, to get exactly the kind of reaction you gave him."

Malazan,33dpmk,Aiolus,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:04:56 2015 UTC,"I don't dislike Kruppe but I see where you might be coming from. Sure he's a funny and witty wordsmith with far more power than he let's on... But the gag kind of gets tired. Similar conclusions could be drawn for Tehol and Bugg, as well a Pust. Not that I feel that way specifically, but I get that people might."
Malazan,33dpmk,kaoschosen,3,Wed Apr 22 17:10:19 2015 UTC,"Mines Kruppe, it's a wonderful character. My second favorite is Tehol.   The bad ass characters are also awesome. Whiskey, Kalam, Rake, Silchas, Quick Ben, etc. However I'm very used to these types of characters. I just loved the compassion and make up of my two favorites."
Malazan,33dpmk,GLORYTOCHAOS,3,Tue Apr 21 21:07:27 2015 UTC,I feel like Erikson just loved Kruppe more.

Malazan,33dpmk,Balesirion,2,Wed Apr 22 21:47:36 2015 UTC,"Kalam is by far my favorite - I think I like him because he doesn't do magic or have power from being an ascendant , but he's skilled and determined.  Also huge fan of Tehol and Bugg, Icarium, Iskaral Pust (and his wife - I forget her name right now), Quick Ben and Cottillion."
Malazan,33dpmk,Kellt_,2,Wed Apr 22 19:36:20 2015 UTC,"I would have to say Itkovian, for well, everything he does in MoI."
Malazan,33dpmk,Tumblehawk,4,Wed Apr 22 15:16:23 2015 UTC,Shadowthrone. We don't see much of him and haven't got any PoV chapters but I just love how insane and cunning he is. Also mentioning him I can't leave out the other amazing half of the duo - Cotillion . He is a master assassin and isn't a total dirtbag like most of the other gods.

Malazan,33d3a8,MrCaptDrNonsense,8,Tue Apr 21 15:30:35 2015 UTC,"Well, they are all (except Clip) Anomander's children and other close younger relatives. Nimander is the main one, Anomander's son. They first showed up in House of Chains on Drift Avalii when Cutter and Apsalar visted there. They had been living their for centuries under the protection of Anomander's brother Andarist. When the Edur attack the island and kill Andarist they left with the other refuges on the island towards Quon Tali.  They showed up again at the end of The Bonehunters, on Malaz Island. At some point in their travels they had met Withal and Sand (the Meckros and Andii that had been trapped on The Crippled God's island in Midnight Tides), and stayed with them since Sand was the only other Andii they've met in probably centuries. When Withal joined Tavore and the army on the trip to Lether for his eventual role in the destruction of Rhulad's sword, the rest tagged along.  In Reaper's Gale they basically did a whole bunch of nothing, just hung out at Second Maiden Fort. Only real thing of note was that one of the group, Phaed, starts plotting to kill Sand. Phaed was a kind of already awful person, and really started losing it after everyone she ever knew was slaughtered at Drift Avalii, and her and Sand were always rather hostile towards each other, so eventually it lead to Phaed trying to kill her. Nimander finds out, and tells Sand in Withal, leading to Withal killing her. Nimander is rather haunted by this, and his role in it, because he knew this is what would happen when he warned Withal. It's comes up a fair amount in Toll The Hounds. At the end of Reaper's Gale, Clip shows up outside the house they're staying in (after retreating from his fight with Trull), claims he's the Mortal Sword of Anomander, and the Envoy of Darkness, and that it's time for them to all come home to see Anomander.  Hard to say what's happened in Toll The Hounds so far without knowing where you are, but basically they're traveling towards Black Coral, and it's really really obvious to all involved that Clip has ulterior motives and is just using them for something."
Malazan,33d3a8,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Tue Apr 21 16:31:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, they have been wary of Clip for quite some time.  He was unconscious for a good while, and then they had a big fight and one of the female Tiiste did something special but I can't remember what. I think I need to go back and read all of their sections again. I'm on page 720 of the US paperback at the moment."
Malazan,33d3a8,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Tue Apr 21 16:41:47 2015 UTC,"How many pages long is the book, 720 sounds pretty far in. I'm guessing they've gone to Bastion and had the encounter with The Dying God (not to be confused with The Crippled God)?"

Malazan,339nr1,bsoholic,5,Mon Apr 20 20:04:50 2015 UTC,"This is the death that broke me. When Faradan Sort sees the pattern of his skeleton and compares it to a ""child hiding in a closet"" I was weeping for him. Had to put my book down for a couple of days after this. His sacrifice for his friends was so tragic yet beautiful. Beak. Gods below...Beak."
Malazan,339nr1,HonestSleeper93,3,Tue Apr 21 02:53:16 2015 UTC,And I feel like Erikson so rarely goes out of his way to make us feel better about something tragic happening? Which makes Hood waiting for Beak with his brother at the gates all the more touching and heartbreaking.
Malazan,339nr1,Tumblehawk,3,Wed Apr 22 14:51:13 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, you're not alone.  This is always in everybody's Top 10 Malazan moments.  It's nice to know this works on the audio version as well!"
Malazan,339nr1,TriscuitCracker,3,Mon Apr 20 20:15:29 2015 UTC,"It's amazing how attached we all became to Beak in such a short time.  His loss was tough on all the readers, but what an awesome sacrifice.  It was such a great story."
Malazan,339nr1,TocYounger,2,Tue Apr 21 00:08:51 2015 UTC,I feel I should give this a listen. I know the series well enough to compensate if I miss a sentence or so.
Malazan,339nr1,mmSNAKE,2,Mon Apr 20 22:00:37 2015 UTC,I knew exactly who you were talking about. So many feels for a character you barely got to know. So many feels got punched. A tear or two was shed.

Malazan,33afzv,briang1339,8,Mon Apr 20 22:53:30 2015 UTC,"Homies, if you're not enjoying em, just walk away. I personally don't think anything is worth trudging through if you're not enjoying it. There's too much else for you to spend your time on.  But if you're enjoying yourself even a little bit, and you can see yourself reading on, I highly encourage it. This is one of the most rewarding series I've ever read, but it won't be if you're second guessing your motivations for reading it."
Malazan,33afzv,future_forward,1 point,Tue Apr 21 00:01:51 2015 UTC,"There's definitely some great moments thus far, but just seems to be a ton of confusion even where I'm at now.  I'm going to keep going until end of book three before I decide whether to keep reading or not though regardless."
Malazan,33afzv,descender421,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:49:25 2015 UTC,"For me all the mystery is part of the fun, not completely understanding everyone's roles and motivations.. not looking it up even though i want to. 3rd book was the slowest for me as well though."
Malazan,33afzv,Bibidiboo,4,Tue Apr 21 16:24:30 2015 UTC,"Hey, if it's not clicking for you, it's not clicking for you. No shame in putting the books down.  No series is for everybody.  I, for instance, can't seem to get into Wheel of Time.   I'd keep going however. Books 1-5 are, in a sense, ""setup for the entire series, with their own plots integral to each book (Chain of Dogs, Pannion War, Whirlwind, etc) In Book 6, the Bonehunters, all the plots from the past 5 books start to come together until you get a Convergence in Dust of Dreams/Crippled God. With a Capitol C.   It's an amazing ride and yes, not perfect of course, but no series is. You both have so far to go, and so much to see and experience! Once you see how it all starts to come together and the seeds planted in earlier books come to fruition, and you understand what Erikson has been building to over the course of multiple books, it is astounding. And even better on a re-read."
Malazan,33afzv,TriscuitCracker,3,Tue Apr 21 00:48:46 2015 UTC,"I went through those moments a few times throughout the series, where it felt more like a chore than anything else.  But then there were moments where I would get really invested in a few characters and really enjoy it.    I think with a lot of long series, there are ups and downs.    After finishing The Crippled God, I can tell you, the feeling of accomplishment you get is amazing.  It made the whole thing worth it."
Malazan,33afzv,TocYounger,3,Tue Apr 21 00:05:59 2015 UTC,"I ran into a wall at midnight tides and elected to start over rather then put them down. I'm glad I did, the second time through I had a much more thorough understanding of the world, which greatly increased my enjoyment of the later books.   May not work for you, but certainly worked for me!"
Malazan,33afzv,drae-,2,Tue Apr 21 13:21:23 2015 UTC,I'm currently half way through Memories of Ice and am wondering the same thing.
Malazan,33afzv,descender421,4,Mon Apr 20 23:49:02 2015 UTC,"If you're willing to finish the book, go for it. Some people say MoI is their favorite, for me it wasn't great but good enough to keep going.  EDIT: Also, I'd like to mention I'm 160 pages into the fourth book, House of Chains, and Erikson decided to spend this whole time focusing on only one (new) character. It's so easy to read and easy to follow, unlike any of the other three books, and it's great. I'm sure the whole book isn't dedicated to just him, but focusing a huge chunk on one POV when starting a new book in Malazan seems the best way to ease into it."
Malazan,33afzv,sleepinxonxbed,1 point,Tue Apr 21 02:11:49 2015 UTC,Good to hear that about book number four.  Thanks!
Malazan,33afzv,descender421,2,Tue Apr 21 03:32:19 2015 UTC,"I found some PoVs to be really boring, but most of them paid off in the end. And as everyone else is saying: when you complete the series it's awesome, it's so rewarding.  But if you aren't hooked after 4 books, the series might not be for you."
Malazan,33afzv,Randomonous,1 point,Tue Apr 21 07:27:05 2015 UTC,"Well....  I've contemplated moving on to other books dozens of times - then I read Midnight Tides and it's been my favorite so far.  It actually has some really good explanations of the warrens, holds and chaos that I needed to keep going - plus it had more comic relief than any of the others (so far) and I really enjoyed that change of pace - helped keep me going anyway."

Malazan,338ky4,Santusak,8,Mon Apr 20 14:46:51 2015 UTC,"That's kind of the eternal question.  Most people myself included will tell you to read the main 10 book Erikson series and then read Esselmont. Or do a reread of the main series and incorporate Esselmont into it. There are currently 6 Esselmont books dealing with backstory subplots that are only hinted at in Erikson's series. Esselmont is a good writer, in my opinion, not as good as Erikson, but for the backstory and getting your Malazan fix he is essential.  Erikson also has the first of the Kharkanas trilogy out with Forge of Darkness set thousands of years in the past. He is also going to write another trilogy based on a character you haven't met yet. Esselmont is also going to write a new prequel trilogy as well involving Kellenvad and Dancer's merry adventures in the Azath.  There are also novellas dealing with two lovingly evil characters from Memories of Ice written by Erikson.  TLDR: Recommend reading the main 10 book series by Erikson first! But hey, to each their own, read however you like."
Malazan,338ky4,TriscuitCracker,2,Mon Apr 20 15:32:16 2015 UTC,"Actually, he has met the character to be in the trilogy- he is one of Sha'ik's bodyguards in DG."
Malazan,338ky4,JestaKilla,2,Mon Apr 20 21:43:07 2015 UTC,"I guess that could be a spoiler, it took me a while to make the connection"
Malazan,338ky4,Asimov_800,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:02:11 2015 UTC,"Me, too! I didn't even really think he would be more than a bit character in DG."
Malazan,338ky4,JestaKilla,7,Tue Apr 21 21:25:01 2015 UTC,"Absolutely read the books in publication order for your first time. A reread would be the right time to mess around with that kind of stuff.  You could also put some ICE books in there as well, but I don't think any of them have enough of a major effect to the overarching storyline of the main series for it to be worth it."
Malazan,338ky4,Oathsend,2,Mon Apr 20 15:17:35 2015 UTC,I would slight disagree and say read Erikson's in publication order up to Reapers Gale and then read Esslemonts Return of the Crimson guard follwed by the 3 remaining Erikson books. Certain things happen im RotCG that you will be need to know for some things to make sense in Toll the Hounds.
Malazan,338ky4,DAMCARDLE,2,Mon Apr 20 16:29:01 2015 UTC,"I'd read the main 10 book series first, in the order of publication. Then, if you are hungry for some more fleshing out of the mythos, read the ICE books. (I'm midway through the 5th - it's very good). I really don't recommend people read the ICE books mixed in with the main series. It'd be too jarring, simply because ICE just isn't the writer Erikson is and I think it would kill the pacing."

I don't actually remember how Withal gets back there. Was Mael helping out a again? But he can break the sword because he's the one who made it. Access to a warren is like a natural talent, you can be able to access more than one, its just really rare (like Beak). Or you do something like Quick Ben did. A 'High Mage' has two slightly different meanings. It can refer to a mage who's just really powerful, and it is also an official rank in the Malazan army. So for example you have someone like Quick Ben who's strong enough to be considered a 'high mage' in the first definition. But he hides it so no one really knows, and later when its found out he gets promoted to the military rank of High Mage in the army. Bugg. No. Somehow completely forgot about the Tanno Spiritwalker thing and the dead Bridgeburners ascending as a unit. It's just confusing because Hedge himself doesn't exhibit any of the power of a usual ascendent."

I thought that he was after HoC with Fiddler, Kalam and Quick Ben returning to the heart of Raraku with the whole Tanno Spirit Walker/Bridgeburner thing going on.

Malazan,3338fy,Math2S,3,Sun Apr 19 02:28:44 2015 UTC,"Yep on Rillish. As for the Crimson Guardsmen you mention, I don't think you really find out what they were doing on Stratem (or how they got there) until the beginning of Blood and Bone, two books on from where you are now.   As for Peles, she dosn't want to reveal that she's from Perish at first - I was also confused by it, but it might be because at this point in the timeline, the Perish Grey Helms have sworn allegiance to Tavore (as opposed to the Malazan Empire) and she doesn't want to be doubted?"
Malazan,3338fy,Tumblehawk,2,Sun Apr 19 14:17:35 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Thank you.  Seems to be an interesting book thus far, Esselmont's writing has definitely improved."

Erikson is an anthropologist and archeologist and his world, races, etc felt very real to me. The hugely epic scope. The writing was very pleasant.   Finally the underlying philosophical points were perfect for me."
Malazan,32zj3x,Aiolus,9,Sat Apr 18 05:39:45 2015 UTC,"I love the sheer scope and scale of the Malazan series.  I'm a sucker for details, and Malazan is chock full of them, where another book it may be dull filler, Malazan makes every location seem ancient, every new character has a vast family history, and every new race have a millennia of forgotten lore. Even the magic is not fully understood, among the reader and the characters. The other races and ascendants and gods can be truly alien to the regular humans, we will never truly understand exactly what Krul's motivations are, or why the Spoiler Nothing is spelled out.  Also the visual imagery and sense of wonder as you read is palpable.   I also enjoy the philosophy most of the time, the characters drive home points on religion, politics, war, love, and many other things I have never thought of before, or I had, but never knew how to say with such eloquence, grace and simplicity."
Malazan,32zj3x,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Sat Apr 18 04:54:58 2015 UTC,"I agree with this answer, the scope is just amazing.

Malazan,32zj3x,TriscuitCracker,3,Tue Apr 21 14:44:14 2015 UTC,I fell in love with this series because the way it is written really makes me feel that this world Erikson created is millions of years old.  It feels lived in and alive.  It feels terrifying and also amazing.  There are gods and beings that are hundreds of thousands of years old and it makes you really change your concept of time.    The characters are really compelling and some of them are just so epically powerful that it's inspiring.

So many of them and they are so vividly writen, all unique with their own defined personality. And since we read their points of view, how they think and feel you really get to know them and become very attached to them.   Another reason is of course the scale and the scope of the series. There are so many storylines so enjoyable, so gripping and fascinating, all of them taking place in a world so rich in history, mitology and varied cultures.  And lastly, I think that the philosophy and the themes Erikson explores throughout the books are what really set this series apart."
Malazan,32zj3x,grixa,5,Sat Apr 18 05:07:18 2015 UTC,"I enjoy the history of it all. The world isn't just slapdash typical fantasy (oh look the elves are named something different!) copy pasted onto a landscape.  The characters/places have history. Sometimes long, sometimes short, but it affects events throughout the entirety of the series. Plus the way he conceives deities is pretty neat."
Malazan,32zj3x,Disingenuous_,4,Sat Apr 18 06:49:49 2015 UTC,"Because to me Erikson has created a world that feels real, the people in it actually feel diverse, the cultures are fleshed out and unique from one another, the regions have history that plays into the peoples living there and the history is often just hinted at instead slapping the reader in the face with it.  The characters have flawed viewpoints, and while not explicitly stated in the series makes a lot of the information given and the way it's given more depth and a more unique depth.  The theme of the series is so far-reaching that I still discovered foreshadowing that had gone unnoticed on my 3rd reading of the series, not that I hadn't understood what happened in the story the first time through, but the complexity of the plot reveals itself when you have a better view of the grander picture. That complexity is probably chief among my reasons for loving this series. It is truly epic and other writers can only grasp feebly at what erikson has achieved in my opinion."
Malazan,32zj3x,Priest_of_Aroo,2,Sat Apr 18 16:17:09 2015 UTC,Alot of great points its interesting how many reasons for everyone and how much that is close to the same. It seems like everyone agrees that it might be a multiple read series to get everything which Is awesome
Malazan,32zj3x,Clearly_a_fake_name,2,Sun Apr 19 02:51:44 2015 UTC,I like how there are Gods and Ascendants that actually come down from their perch and have a presence.
Malazan,32zj3x,TRAIANVS,3,Tue Apr 21 08:44:31 2015 UTC,What is everyone's personal reason for liking the Malazan series?   I only get one?

Malazan,32zj3x,mmSNAKE,2,Sat Apr 18 13:56:21 2015 UTC,"I love it because it's dark, gritty, vast in scope, and incredibly emotionally engaging. Not so much GOTM, but the later books will wring your heart out like a rag.  I'd say crushingly poignant, but there's joy in there as well (though admittedly, much of this is for contrast so he can crush you harder...)   Also it was written by an anthropologist, so the level of thought that has gone into every culture, every city, every religion... is astounding.   Even the freaking chapter-heading poems and quotes are like Buddha telling a Latvian Joke."
Malazan,32zj3x,DAMCARDLE,2,Sat Apr 18 16:42:35 2015 UTC,"In short:  It bring a sense of hope in humanity, that though all the shit we do to each other there are genially empathetic people who are willing to put the foot down to do the right compassionate example, not for their own benefit, but because they feel it is the right thing to do."
Malazan,32zj3x,tenhou,2,Sat Apr 18 03:16:52 2015 UTC,To add to the above it is also easily the most emotional impacting series I have ever read.

Malazan,32zj3x,pfk505,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:20:38 2015 UTC,"He doesn't spoon feed you history, lore, characters thoughts, or their intentions. He forces you to piece everything together yourself, which can takes the entire series to do so. It is a very satisfying feeling when that happens."
Malazan,32zj3x,ashkestar,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:54:35 2015 UTC,"For me the single biggest reason is the characters.  From the smallest character to the biggest, they are so well drawn, so astonishingly genuine, and you will fall in love with so many of them.  That combined with the narrative and various plot lines, culminating in an epic catharsis, are enough to make me recommend it to anyone.  But there is so, so much more in store for you!"
Malazan,32zj3x,wjbc,1 point,Mon Apr 20 06:43:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what snagged me on my first read, to be honest. I skimmed a lot, forgot a lot, and still made it to book 9 before realizing I had to start over if I was going to make any sense of the last book.  On rereads, I love the way Erikson creates these nesting dolls of stories. He has high-level worldbuilding - gods, races, religions, myths, legends, cultures, and so much history. Within that there are the major arcs that span multiple books. Within those there are the single book arcs. Then there are the detailed, personal stories of individual characters - which wind up feeding back into the worldbuilding and major + minor arcs.  To have all that and have the majority of it come together in the end? It's masterful. I can't wrap my head around how he does it, but I'm glad he did."

A lot happens, and yes we don't have all the details but that's how life works. It's a common enough complaint that I've wondered why it's such a big deal for so many people but I'm glad you've found a book/series to enjoy."
Malazan,32y7yu,zebano,3,Fri Apr 17 18:47:23 2015 UTC,"I think people are used to a Brandon Sanderson style of magic which is clearly explainable. Like in a paragraph he can have you understanding 50% of the complexity of a system and you have a decent idea of its rules.  Malazan is way more old school, in that there is way more for you to fill in and that puts some people off."
Malazan,32y7yu,Hhhaamuus,1 point,Sat Apr 18 15:33:30 2015 UTC,Agreed. You just have to go with it. Part of the enjoyment is the slow explanation over time. The fact that it wasn't all expositioned for me is what got me excited to continue reading
Malazan,32y7yu,ClassicalMusicTroll,1 point,Sat Apr 18 08:40:46 2015 UTC,"I read it twice before moving on to book two, and missed a lot the first time.  It's not that I couldn't follow the story at all, it's just that I knew there was a lot I didn't understand."
Malazan,32y7yu,wjbc,0,Sat Apr 18 11:50:13 2015 UTC,I just think that compared to other fantasy authors who tend to info dump it could be confusing at first... but so worth the payoff. Witness.

Malazan,32y7yu,TriscuitCracker,2,Fri Apr 17 18:26:49 2015 UTC,"The people who feel confused are readers who are used to info dumps or a more traditional fantasy method as the characters are introduced to the specifics of the world as the reader is. A perfect example of this is the wheel of time. Malazan drops you in a world where everyone knows whats going on so there is very little detailed 'organic' exposition. If you pay attention and don't get caught up in the fact you don't knew ALL of the details right away its really not that hard of a read. That being said there is a ton of information hidden in conversation, being able to read into what isn't said by characters will help you alot as the series goes on."
Malazan,32y7yu,FR05TB1T3,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:25:08 2015 UTC,Same here! I'm on page 91 and already hooked. I feel like the people that say it's confusing just aren't reading with the kind of attention to detail that books like this require.
Malazan,32y7yu,etotheeipi,0,Sat Apr 18 03:45:06 2015 UTC,The thing is:  Gardens of the Moon is a really easy read. But it slows down dramatically. Which makes me sad. D=

Malazan,32vpm8,DAMCARDLE,3,Fri Apr 17 13:40:17 2015 UTC,"Its much better on the second read through but still remains my least favourite Malazan book,  its very dark and grim and almost nothing but set up for the last book, but S.E tells us this at the start so just bear with it,  last third is the best third fo sure. You only have a book and a third to the end!!!!"

Malazan,32t144,Lost_Afropick,4,Thu Apr 16 14:31:47 2015 UTC,"Although maybe not very comforting, but most answers will come if you keep reading. For example, regarding the K'chain Che'malle you will get more background and cultural information in the latter books.  Others like the Tiste folk, a lot isn't known yet but the Kharkanas trilogy will shed some light on their history.  Just keep reading and enjoy the current story, the rest will eventually come."
Malazan,32t144,valorcurse,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:18:35 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks! That's reassuring to know, that eventually things will fall into place. Just wondering though is there a particular point in the series (say during a particular book) that all those different things will suddenly just ""click"" and come into context? Or will it just be a slowly progressive bit by bit reveal?"
Malazan,32t144,valorcurse,3,Thu Apr 16 15:41:17 2015 UTC,"It depends on the person, but I've had multiple ""Oh, shit"" moments when reading the series when different stories suddenly ""click"" and then spend the next minutes staring at the wall with an idiot's grin on my face.  There is a lot of foreshadowing for the biggest moments in the books although I never seem to catch them, so it might progress differently for you. So good luck and enjoy it!"
Malazan,32t144,drae-,2,Thu Apr 16 16:55:48 2015 UTC,"I found a lot of ""aha!"" came during reapers gale, as that's when the story arcs begin to... converge."

Malazan,32t144,somedude2012,3,Thu Apr 16 19:40:26 2015 UTC,"You're never going to get a full and complete history of what is/was going on in each book. Every story is told through a point of view, and those points of view alter the perception of those events related to the reader.  Burn is the sleeping goddess, the avatar of the earth itself. So if Burn is asleep, the earth is asleep, right? If Burn is awake, I'd expect earthquakes, volcanos, shifting tectonic plates...that kind of thing.   The Crippled God is...a god pulled down from another dimension/time/place to end the rule of Kallor.   The history of the tlan imass, jaghut, k'chain che'malle, toblakai, trell, etc...is known only to Erikson and Esslemont. Erikson is writing a trilogy going into the history of the Tiste that discuss the jaghut briefly, but you'll need to put the rest together yourself.  I wouldn't worry so much about where the greater storyline is going. Enjoy the ride.   That said, this is easier said than done. I found Midnight Tides a huge break from the earlier books, and didn't enjoy it because of that break. Rest assured that it will, in time, all make sense."

All plotlines starts to come together in Bonehunters to slowly come together over the rest of the books for a ""Covergence"" with a capitol C in Dust of Dreams/Crippled God, which are really two books in one. Nearly everything will be answered, or at least more clarity given.   You are NOT stupid. Malazan is complicated as hell, but that's half the fun, nearly nothing is spoon fed to you, it's so satisfying to figure it out and connect the dots. And just as good on a re-read.  What's most important is, do you LIKE them?"

Malazan,32ryuh,sleepinxonxbed,7,Thu Apr 16 05:59:51 2015 UTC,"Hey there, it's great to see such a detailed impressions post, they're always a pleasure to read through!    I normally don't like giving hints as to what features in which book, although I know it's pretty common and you did ask. So the Mott Irregulars don't really got a lot of airtime, but they pop up here and there in the series. The Seguleh are similar, however their biggest role is during Orb, Sceptre, Throne. Good question. I think it's partly that some of these characters are so old and experienced that it's difficult to hold a grudge forever, they'll be allies sometimes and they'll be enemies sometimes. Having him in the alliance probably also made more sense when their enemy was the Malazan empire, too (as the Malazans really threatened Kallor's way of life). Finally I think it's partly ""keep your friends close, keep your enemies closer"" from Rake/Brood and co. It might just be better to know where he is so you can keep an eye on him. Quick Ben is a mystery wrapped in an enigma wrapped in 12 souls. Witness."
Malazan,32ryuh,Nimander23,4,Thu Apr 16 07:53:32 2015 UTC,"You have great impressions and comments, I'm glad you liked it for the most part. Any difficulties you have with Erikson's prose you'll get better at as you start to piece together where he is going with all this. Truly, Memories of Ice is only the beginning, where you get your first real glimpse of the larger picture. I loved and cried at Itvokian, Envy/Toc/Tool, the insanity of the visuals of Capustan, the K'chain basically being velociraptors with swords for their hands, Gruntle's noble gruffness, the fun of the necromancers vs Quick Ben, and all the Bridgeburner goodness. Out of curiosity, what did you think of the prologue, the part with Kallor and the reason behind the Crippled God coming to this world? I always love a Malazan because of how ancient everything's and how every character or place has a feeling of history to them.  Questions: 1: The Mott Irregulars are indeed hilarious and they will appear a few times in the rest of the series. The Segulah as well, making some significant future contributions to the overall story. The Segulah are a major storyline in the Esselmont book Orb Sceptre Throne.   Kallor IS a military genius, but he also causes trouble wherever he goes. He is cursed by the Elders in the prologue to always try and gain power/ascendancy but never quite reach it and he's a little ticked off after a millennia of that, he's pretty angry and bitter about his lot in life and meddles a lot. I believe he's in the group simply so Rake and Brood can keep an eye on him so he doesent cause trouble.  Any military skills he can bring to the table are welcome but not needed.   Quick Ben has access to many resources, souls and warrens, he's probably forgotten more than many know. We all wish Erikson would write an entire book just on him.  Throughout the series he gets a lot of flak from his fellow Bridgeburners even Kalam and Fiddler about keeping his knowledge close and not ever really letting them know what's going on or his theories unless ordered or prodded. He will always protect his own however.   Unfortunately, the Assail continent does not get mentioned much until the Esselmont novel Assail which is about said conflict. There will be plenty of T'Lan Imass in the main series however, fear not.   House of Chains is a little quieter book than Memories of Ice. In fact, the entire first quarter of the book focuses on a certain character you will meet Spoiler and hopefully like after the book is done, it's one of the most engrossing character changes over time you will ever see and a smack in the face to all the barbarian tropes in fantasy. The timeline jumps around, it takes place in Genebackis and Seven Cities, and nearly all the (surviving) characters from Deadhouse Gates return as well as some new ones of course, what's a Malazan novel without a dozen new characters :-) hope you enjoy it!"

It was Silverfox. She releases him from the Tellan ritual at the end when he approaches her and he relinquishes his sword and title. It's within her power to do, she was created for that exact purpose. The reason she doesn't free the rest is because the rest of the T'lan decided they have one more battle left (in Assail) before ending the ritual. Tool just wanted out earlier.  Admittedly, its really hard to figure out that's how it happened since they basically just come to an understanding by staring at each other and the important part happens off screen. But it's out right stated in a later book."

Malazan,32ryuh,nieud,2,Fri Apr 17 13:20:27 2015 UTC,"Tool (and Kilava) is reincarnated into a hearthrob Barghast which Hetan immediately falls in love with. The bark message to the necromancers from the Mott Irregulars (who are hilarious by the way). Toc the Younger becomes the Mortal Sword of the Wolves and gets his own Anaster body. Happy endings all round for the people still alive, and I like it.   key phrase being 'for the people still alive'. Less happy for the tens of thousands of dead. Including he majority of the remaining Bridgeburners. Anyway, reincarnation is a weird way to put it for Tool. He just had the ritual removed from here. And he's an Imass not a Barghast. See here where I wrote about it in more detail, since there was a bit of bad info in this thread. Kilava wasn't reincarnated, she's been 'alive' all this time as an Imass, she never took the ritual. She's a Soultaken Bonecaster, both things alone make you crazy long lived, which is why she's still alive all this time.   The allusions to the conflict in Assail continent was the first and probably one thing that gave me chills in the book. We get to Assail in the fifth book, correct?   Not a bad guess, but no. You're going to want the side book appropriately named Assail.   Do the Mott Irregulars get any significant facetime in the series? They're a hilarious bunch, even off screen with the message written in bark to Bauchelain and Korbal Broach. Need more Mott Irregulars. Also, would like to know if we get to see more of the Seguleh to. Just mentioning name of the books they'll appear in and the length of their significance is fine.   Yes and yes. Different Mott Irregulars appear at different times in solid roles. Look for one the show up in book 6, and another pair get are part of a plot that goes from books 8 to 10. Individual Segulah appear from time to time. One comes to mind that likes to make quick cameo appearances once every few books in the later half. There's one as a secondary character in book 7. Another one comes to mind in 9-10. The side book Orb Scepter Throne deals with them heavily.   What should I know to get hyped about going into House of Chains? Just mentions of things like ""Karsa Orlong"" and ""Witness!"" is appropriate. I've passed through a lot of stuff about Malazan up to the third book while browsing the r/fantasy and r/malazan reddits besides those two things.   Well you hit the nail on the head there. Karsa Orlong. Other things to look forward to would be any of the book 2 characters you really liked. Most of them will be back."

I see a few in your post, so gonna go ahead and get right into it:   What's the name of the soldier you're asking about? There's a lot of em, and Seven Cities is a pretty big place.  Wickans are a human tribe. The book will explain more about their culture as you progress, but I can tell you a few things without spoiling anything: (a) they are fierce warriors (b) they have a very dry sense of humor, and pretty grim about things in general (c) their mages are very powerful and can practice soul-shifting (Nil, Nether and Sormo are all ""reincarnated"" mages).  I think you're referring to Apt here – she's just a demon. I don't think this is a spoiler, since I don't think it's supposed to be read as ambiguous. She's just Apt.    Come back with any other questions – this is your thread."
Malazan,32qkss,future_forward,3,Wed Apr 15 23:09:14 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, bro, thank you so much!    I think the other commenter /u/shadow793 is right - I'm talking about Duiker who I guess is a historian! I think I got confused because I just read the section where he's walking around Darujhistan trying to find his commander (?) Coltain (?) who is just the high fist for Darujhistan (??).  I definitely thought Wickans were troll creatures? But it makes sense since the hand-less and banished historian hanging out with Baudin and Felisin has tattoos and something is going on with them for some reason in the desert.    Oh, right, the little boy who is actually a dead mage! That is Sormo, right? I don't think I've met the other ones?  3) Yes, I am referring to Apt. Dang! I thought because his one eye kept being mentioned, it had to do with Toc the Younger losing one eye before he went through a warren last book.   You're the best! I am really struggling with this one!"
Malazan,32qkss,future_forward,3,Thu Apr 16 02:24:24 2015 UTC,"You got it bro!    Dukier's the Malazan historian who's running with Coltaine. Coltaine's the High Fist, which is kind of a big deal, because the Wickans and Malazans had a complicated relationship in the recent past.    I think you may have read something wrong re: Darujhistan – DG has only tangential connections with the city. There's a chapter or two wherein Dukier and Kulp, a Malazan sorcerer, split up and D has to march to rejoin Coltaine's company, though.   Also, Darujhistan was not conquered by the Malazans in GotM, so there are no High Fists there.    Well, DG introduces Mappo, who's a Trell, and has funny teeth and is really hair. Kind of trolly. And Icarium, who's a Jhag (half Jaghut), who has tusks and blue-green skin. Also kind of trolly.    Heboric was a priest of Fener, and apparently that particular religious cult seems to use tattooed markings in their practice.   2A. Sormo is a mage who appears to be 11-12 years old. Nil and Nether, who should have been introduced by now, but maybe after Dukier rejoins the company, appear to younger.   While I will say nothing in response to your comment because spoilers, don't sweat Apt and her companion."

Malazan,32qkss,TriscuitCracker,7,Thu Apr 16 02:25:25 2015 UTC,"Couple overall notes that could help:   The Malazan Empire is currently in the process of expanding before and during the series.  The Malazans are humans from the continent Quon Tali.  The Wiccan people are also from Quon Tali.  Before the series started the Malazans conquered the Wiccans and now the Wiccans fight for the Malazan Empire.  They are human and have a sort of tribal culture. Almost all of the first book takes place on a second continent called Genabackis.  The Malazans were trying to conquer Genabackis and doing a decent job until the events of the first book.  That is where Pale and Darujhistan are, and it's where most of the main characters and Dujek Onearm's army are during the events of Deadhouse Gates.  There are a lot more humans ethnicities on Genabackis too (such as Rhivi, Barghast, and Daru). Deadhouse Gates takes place on a third continent that doesn't really have a name, but is basically called Seven Cities.  Years before the series starts, Seven Cities was also conquered by the Malazan Empire (that's where Quick Ben and Kalam are from, they started as enemies of Malazans in Seven Cities, but were eventually recruited and joined Whiskeyjack and the Malazans, just like the Wiccans joined the Malazans after they were conquered).  Now Seven Cities are revolting because they don't like the Malazans as their rulers and they heard the Genabackis campaign failed.  Also there is a prophecy about one of their leaders/god (called Shaik and Drynjha) so they are using that as a holy war type of excuse to rebel as well. Felisin, Heboric, and Baudin from the Prologue start off in Quon Tali but are enslaved and sent to Seven Cities in the beginning of the book.  They sorta get caught up in the prophecy of the rebellion even though they are just trying to survive. Croakus, Apsalar, Fiddler, and Kalam leave from Genabackis for Seven Cities in the end of the first book/beginning of second book.  What they are doing is a plot point that will eventually become clear. Kulp, Stormy, Duiker, and other soldiers are all more or less Malazans that are there from the first time Seven Cities was conquered.  They are all there for different reasons, but they get caught up fighting against the rebellion too. Coltaine and the Wiccans are representing the Malazan Empire and just trying to stop the rebellion of Seven Cities continent. I've mentioned a lot of Human races, but there are also non-humans too. Moranth (From first book, allies of the Malazans, had the flying insect mounts and explosive munitions, had colors to describe their groups like Black, Blue, Gold). Tiste Andii (From first book, black skin, immortal, no real lands of their own and supposedly from a different world.  You'll learn more later). Jaghut (From first book, but there was only one, the Tyrant Raest.  They are sorta trollish, but mostly extinct.  In the second book you meet a Half-Jaghut named Icarium). Trell (Second book, I picture them sorta orcish but hairer.  Rare, you've only met one named Mappo so far.  You'll learn more later). T'lan Imass (From first book you met one or two.  Tool was the main character.  They are like undead magical neanderthals in a lot of ways.  You'll learn more about them later too)."
Malazan,32qkss,shadow793,3,Thu Apr 16 04:20:22 2015 UTC,"Also, remember to use the Dramatis Personae and the Glossary at the front and back of the book it's helped me a lot!  And ask anything you like, post your impressions, that's what we are all here for!"
Malazan,32qkss,shadow793,2,Thu Apr 16 02:54:05 2015 UTC,"I think the soldier you're talking about is Duiker. He's just a historian. Don't know if you were talking about Kulp, though. He is a mage of shadow. I only finished the book three days ago, but I don't remember any other seven cities wandering soldiers except for Kalam and possibly Fiddler."
Malazan,32qkss,Z3roSum0,2,Thu Apr 16 01:25:28 2015 UTC,"Dang, I was referring to Duiker, but now that you mention it, I am not sure who Kulp is. Is he the guy hanging out with Coltaine?"

It's super fantastic, IMO.

Malazan,32qhp0,JimmyTMalice,4,Wed Apr 15 22:29:23 2015 UTC,"From what I gathered in Heboric's visions in HoC, they're visitors from another world packed with thousands of souls. When they land, either otataral is created to oppose them or they create it themselves (not quite sure on that).   The jade giant that Heboric touched in DG is the source of all of the otataral which is mined on Otataral Island, but there are others across the world. I'm pretty sure one appears in the first chapter of MT, and Trull Sengar harvests some jade from it. Presumably there's one somewhere in the Lordaeron Plateau where the Teblor live, too, since the oil they use on their swords is infused with otataral."
Malazan,32qhp0,JimmyTMalice,4,Wed Apr 15 22:37:25 2015 UTC,Wow. I completely missed all of this. Did you have this explained to you or did you get this all on your own? You're way smarter than me if you got it on your own because all of this was way too vague for me to understand.
Malazan,32qhp0,TriscuitCracker,3,Wed Apr 15 23:27:02 2015 UTC,"I did manage to piece it together by myself eventually, but there are still so many things in the series that I'm clueless about. I often have no idea what's going on in passages like Heboric's vision, so I've no doubt missed many important details over the series. I suppose it'll all make more sense on a re-read."
Malazan,32qhp0,SageOfTheWise,2,Wed Apr 15 23:32:28 2015 UTC,Read on for answers to Heboric/Jade Strangers.
Malazan,32qhp0,JebusGobson,2,Thu Apr 16 01:25:53 2015 UTC,"The jade giant that Heboric touched in DG is the source of all of the otataral which is mined on Otataral Island, but there are others across the world.    That's not right. Otataral and the Jade Statues are independent in origin. We learn in MoI that Otataral is a material created when all the energy warren magic uses is exhausted from an area. Which can pretty much only happen during extreme magical catastrophes. The Otataral of Otataral island is what's left of that big Soultaken/D'ivers ceremony the First Empire tried to do that blew up on them and pretty much ended the entire empire, and the Imass had to come in and kill everyone to clean it up. Also how Treach/Trake became a soultaken. The Jade statue landed there separately (I would believe sometime after)."
Malazan,32qhp0,SageOfTheWise,2,Thu Apr 16 03:22:29 2015 UTC,"That's a bit spoilery, though I don't think the Ceremony and subsequent Imass cleanup are in Bonehunters yet. Isn't that Reaper's Gale?"
Malazan,32qhp0,JebusGobson,2,Thu Apr 16 08:55:43 2015 UTC,"I looked it up beforehand. Treach talks about the Ceremony and Imass cleanup in MoI and connects it to otataral. Exact quote I found:   Gods, we tore a warren to pieces on that distant continent. Turned the eastlands into molten stone that cooled and became something that defied sorcery. The T'lan Imass sacrificed thousands to cut away the cancer we had become.   Though I think it's talked about a bit earlier with DG since Felisin and Heboric walk all over that place finding the old ruins. The connection that the ceremony created the otataral was the MoI stuff though."

There are just so many moments of emotional intensity that can't be matched by the other books.   Capustan was the main highlight of the book for me; the horrors of the siege and the transformation of Gruntle into the Mortal Sword of Trake were simply awe-inspiring.   The way everything comes together at the end makes it the most satisfying of the books I've read so far. Everything fits into place, from the dream realm becoming the home of Togg and Fanderay to the Jaghut children shoved through the Rent in the prologue turning out to be Pannion and his sister. It's simply a masterpiece of storytelling and it's good that some of the characters' stories are tied up because you won't be seeing them again until much later.  Whiskeyjack's death was too sudden for it to fully sink in until the scene where Quick Ben and Paran visit the Moon's chambers filled with the dead Bridgeburners.   Good luck with House of Chains! It's not quite the rollercoaster of emotion of MoI, but it does expand the series in exciting new directions and introduces two very important main characters. The first quarter of the book is a bit of a departure, focusing on a single character, and it can be a bit challenging to get into but it's definitely worth it as you experience the Malazan Empire through a new set of eyes."
Malazan,32nyow,wheeloficeandfire,7,Wed Apr 15 08:48:28 2015 UTC,"Hey all,  /u/Fnarley here  Just a bit of background:  There was a post a short while ago asking if there were any Malazan podcasts out there (turns out there aren't) and /u/wheeloficeandfire and I started talking about starting our own and so here we are.    The preference for female cast members is just to make it more representative and stems from my personal experience that the best podcasts tend to have hosts of both genders like the excellent 'A Podcast of Ice and Fire' but we are really interested in anyone who might like to join us."
Malazan,32nyow,Fnarley,5,Wed Apr 15 09:38:41 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely be interested in listening to it.  Be sure to post it here, so we can add the website to the sidebar, once you get it going."
Malazan,32nyow,SageOfTheWise,6,Wed Apr 15 10:16:22 2015 UTC,Should try asking in /r/fantasy as well. People seem to be starting the series there all the time. They don't usually come here until a bit later.
Malazan,32nyow,SKR47CH,2,Wed Apr 15 15:07:59 2015 UTC,or /r/books for that matter..
Malazan,32nyow,Fnarley,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:56:05 2015 UTC,"We did a post in /r/fantasy too, but it didn't gain much traction.  Happily /u/MarquisHalimOndore is now on board and we have had a bit of interest from a few others too so hopefully we can do the community justice"
Malazan,32nyow,SageOfTheWise,2,Wed Apr 15 21:27:36 2015 UTC,"Looks like you guys got a post up there now that's going pretty well, so that's good."
Malazan,32nyow,Fnarley,2,Wed Apr 15 21:32:43 2015 UTC,"You are right, after replying to you I checked that post and looks like it blew up while I was travelling home from work and eating."
Malazan,32nyow,Bouncl,3,Wed Apr 15 21:42:04 2015 UTC,"Currently about to start Midnight Tides, and I'm happy to help. Not a girl though- I actually have a super deep voice."
Malazan,32nyow,Owenleejoeking,3,Wed Apr 15 12:02:32 2015 UTC,"Alright, contact us."
Malazan,32nyow,MarquisHalimOndore,2,Wed Apr 15 12:23:27 2015 UTC,I do not have a work load conducive to helping out but I must say I'm excited and hope it takes off!
Malazan,32nyow,Malky,2,Wed Apr 15 12:57:08 2015 UTC,"I'm actually the one who made that original post! I'm so glad you two are doing something with it, I'm so desperate for a podcast to listen to!  I'm actually a female on her first read through (Almost finished with Reaper's Gale, so I'm closer to finishing than starting), and while I would LOVE to participate I'm mostly worried I don't catch nearly enough with the story to be able to help with discussion. My voice is also a bit quiet (Myself and a friend run a podcast and my recordings are always soo quiet and I end up having to boost them. Probably from recording with my phone since I don't have any actual recording devices, but there you go).   Either way, I'm SO excited to see what you guys do, you can already count me as a loyal listener!"
Malazan,32nyow,Hoyasbrasil,2,Wed Apr 15 15:26:59 2015 UTC,"I'd love to help out, but I finished the series last summer, so I suppose I'll just have to be a devoted fan."

Malazan,32nyow,Fnarley,1 point,Wed Apr 15 12:19:29 2015 UTC,What sort of format will the podcast be? Like how often and stuff. Will be interested in viewing it if its decent.
Malazan,32nyow,stumble_on,2,Wed Apr 15 16:46:34 2015 UTC,Aiming for fortnightly and is likely to be in a read along format with 3ish chapters per episode starting of course with GotM so about 10 episodes per book but we are still working out the details
Malazan,32nyow,MrThreePik,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:02:33 2015 UTC,"Ohhhh would totally listen to this. However, if I was on the podcast it would probably be me saying over and over about how I had to stop reading because I'd started crying on the Tube again..."

Malazan,32oejd,shhimhuntingrabbits,6,Wed Apr 15 12:28:50 2015 UTC,"Glad you liked it! Tehol and Bugg are hilarious and funny especially considering Bugg's true face.   What did you think of Rhulad, Trull, Brys, etc? I found Midnight Tides jarring at first, completely new continent and aside from Trull all new characters but on a reread it's one of my fave books.   And as for Bonehunters...it's a fantastic book. Prepare to sweat."
Malazan,32oejd,TriscuitCracker,3,Wed Apr 15 13:35:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I struggled with MT first time around too, but the characters from it became some of my absolute favorites by the end of the series. All the Sengars are wonderful, as are Seren, Silchas, Tehol, Bugg, Udinaas... and some of the most delightfully nasty characters in the entire series, in Hannan Mosag and the Errant."
Malazan,32oejd,jsfsmith,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:19:03 2015 UTC,"I also found it jarring, but all the characters were so great I quickly got into it. My only complaint is how Brys goes out. I felt like he deserved better, and should have totally realized the wine would be poisoned. At first I thought his suicide was intentional, and when it was just a tragic death I was disappointed. Hoping he comes back with his under the sea pall. Trull strikes me as much less lighthearted in this book, but maybe that's just because he's not next to a deadpan T'lan Imass"
Malazan,32oejd,JimmyTMalice,2,Wed Apr 15 22:46:48 2015 UTC,"I think Bugg would have a hard time not sticking around, considering who he really is. :)  Incidentally, did you notice that the Edur he teleported underwater to be crushed was the same one whose corpse is found later in MoI by Quick Ben and co? It's a really cool detail that connects the two books."
Malazan,32oejd,TriscuitCracker,2,Wed Apr 15 22:41:32 2015 UTC,"Ahhh no way! Damn, I didn't realize that at all. It's those details which make it all so excellent"

Malazan,32ndal,Soontaru,8,Wed Apr 15 04:13:41 2015 UTC,"About the first 2/3rds of DoD take place concurrently with TTH. When DoD lines up with TTH's climax, it will be really obvious."

Malazan,32kjhj,phathiker,11,Tue Apr 14 15:11:15 2015 UTC,"Most people I've talked to dislike Karsa at first, so the fact that you love him already means you're probably going to spend the rest of the book and much of the series in orgasmic bliss. I really wish I could relive the epicness of his character development for the first time again."
Malazan,32kjhj,badgerine,9,Tue Apr 14 15:27:32 2015 UTC,I hated him so much to begin with but he's really my favourite character in the series
Malazan,32kjhj,Fnarley,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:56:37 2015 UTC,"Personally, I disliked Karsa... But Loved reading about him!"
Malazan,32kjhj,codyloydl,-6,Tue Apr 14 22:48:42 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS BELOW  Karsa never really grew on me. I didn't like him to start, and after finishing the series I still don't.   One thing that caught my eye, you said character development. But I don't really see how he was developed at all. He was the most one dimensional character and never grew. By the end of the series he was still the same exact person he was at the start. Characters like Fiddler or Ganoes showed growth, you learned more about them as the story went. Karsa is still the same stubborn person that wants to destroy all civilization. He rarely talks. There was nothing to develop. He was a big, bloodthirsty dude at the start, and the same exact big, bloodthirsty dude at the end. You learn very little about his personality/mindset that you don't already know within the first few chapters of his story.   In fact, now that I think back, I can't think of any character whose 'development' was more stagnant that Karsa. Sure he travels and kills things, but that's it. I think had Karsa been replaced by Bairoth Gild or Delum Thord I would have enjoyed that part of the story significantly more, and would have received significantly more from either character."
Malazan,32kjhj,dandello,20,Tue Apr 14 18:51:31 2015 UTC,"How can you say his character had no development?  He went from an ignorant tribesman to a well traveled warrior.  He used to listen to no one but himself, but he learned that others do have wisdom to give.  I can go on, but saying he was the exact same person at the end of the series as he was at the beginning is just silly."
Malazan,32kjhj,Tumblehawk,5,Tue Apr 14 20:19:57 2015 UTC,"As I get ready to do my first re-read, just wanna say that one thing I really value on this sub is the seeds planted for things to watch closely when I do. I want to argue this point with you; but it's also been a while, and I don't have fresh memory to seize upon. So, thanks for the food for thought moving forward!"
Malazan,32kjhj,turnpikenorth,5,Tue Apr 14 18:56:42 2015 UTC,You'd win if you did argue.
Malazan,32kjhj,turnpikenorth,1 point,Tue Apr 14 23:37:58 2015 UTC,"I never had a huge hard on for him but to say he had zero growth really isn't accurate.  I'm on my phone and don't know how to mark spoilers so I can't go into any detail but there is clear growth with how he views certain other peoples, how he treats certain people, and even how he views his own people."
Malazan,32kjhj,Grumpi83,1 point,Tue Apr 14 23:36:58 2015 UTC,"Wow, could not disagree more. Karsa goes through massive personal struggle and comes out a changed character. Yeah he is still a brarbarian, cause hes a barbarian. But his motivations and thoughts are massivly more complex and deep at the end."
Malazan,32kjhj,androgymouse,0,Wed Apr 29 17:17:33 2015 UTC,"Finally someone who doesn't seem to want to jerk Karsa off (not that there's anything wrong with that). While I wouldn't say he went through zero development, I saw very little, albeit on my only read through. He goes from ignorant badass to slightly more worldly badass. I also have a bias against ridiculously strong characters with borderline plot armor. Fiddler and Ganoes are two of my favorites, along with Toc. Talk about some fucking trials and tribulations with that unlucky bastard."
Malazan,32kjhj,Tumblehawk,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:40:08 2015 UTC,Toc is one of the most painfully beautiful characters I've ever come across.
Malazan,32kjhj,Sopp90,7,Wed Apr 15 15:34:24 2015 UTC,"Witness!  I loved that part too!  I listened to the audiobook narrated by Michael Page, and it was excellent.  Every time Karsa talked or thought about ""lowlanders"" (in the beginning) you could feel the contempt.  He just waltzed about the place, wrecking everything in his path that he felt needed wrecking.  It was fun! Also, it was a huge contrast to all the tragedy we experienced in the first three books.  Karsa Orlong...  Karsa fucking Orlong!"
Malazan,32kjhj,bigalthelawyer,4,Tue Apr 14 16:07:30 2015 UTC,"I felt the same way as you. I read Karsa's back story at just the right time in my life. Karsa does not accept failure, and he doesn't whine and complain. He's the embodiment of strength: physical and mental. He accepts responsibility for all of his actions. Witness!"
Malazan,32kjhj,Silcha,5,Tue Apr 14 16:00:25 2015 UTC,Karsa is by FAR my favorite character in the Malazan! Hands down!  Witness!
Malazan,32kjhj,tehpopulator,5,Tue Apr 14 16:37:57 2015 UTC,"Karsa grew on me so much. I hated him at first. But over time he's just such a complex character despite how he seemed at first. Erikson I think specifically wrote him to buck the ""simple barbarian"" trope in fantasy literature."
Malazan,32kjhj,SiroccoSC,1 point,Tue Apr 14 19:42:50 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what he did! SE wrote a cool essay just about karsa vs barbarian tropes. Saw a link here on reddit a few weeks ago, I'd post but on my phone."

I loved that every once and a while he wouldn't do the things that were expected.  His knowledge and understanding wasn't less than others, he wasn't a brainless destroyer, he just looked at the world in a completely different way than everyone else.  On my first reread and I love his story more this time around.  Witness!"
Malazan,32kjhj,danaran,2,Tue Apr 14 17:43:31 2015 UTC,"I hated Karsa at first, but by the end he was one of my favorite characters. This also happened with the entirety of the book Midnight Tides lol"
Malazan,32kjhj,shhimhuntingrabbits,2,Tue Apr 14 20:07:49 2015 UTC,"Nice! I was initially confused by Book 1 of HoC but then started to really enjoy it, it's refreshingly linear. No jumping around, just a very focussed start on one character and his journey. And you're totally right, amazing character development. Enjoy!"
Malazan,32kjhj,nieud,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:09:24 2015 UTC,"I loved the parts of the story that dealt with him (currently reading the book after he's introduced) and I can feel myself wanting to like him, but he's just awful. Dude is completely fucked up. Even by the end of the book, still super fucked. Still a fantastic character though"
Malazan,32kni4,Calathe,7,Tue Apr 14 15:41:24 2015 UTC,"Note 2: Malazan's ruined a few other series for me, though, because of the Deck. I thought it was a pretty cool idea when I read it another series, but now I realize the author just stole it. Meh. Puts me right off the other series now.   I mean, unless this other series is like really taking the Deck of Dragons concept identically from Malazan, it's all based the common ideas of tarot cards, I kind of doubt someone just stole the Malazan version."
Malazan,32kni4,SageOfTheWise,2,Tue Apr 14 15:54:28 2015 UTC,It is practically the same with different names.
Malazan,32kni4,Silcha,3,Tue Apr 14 15:55:40 2015 UTC,The priest (Iskaral Pust) becomes one the funniest and creepiest characters in the series
Malazan,32kni4,TriscuitCracker,3,Tue Apr 14 19:37:38 2015 UTC,Isn't he already? I just read past the part with the broom/boat and I don't know if it's him or Servant who creeps me out more. I'm kind of thinking Servant has a dark secret... He's much too placid and stuff with a master like that... Hm...
Malazan,32kni4,Silcha,2,Tue Apr 14 19:41:31 2015 UTC,"He's sort of a dark Kruppe...wagging tongue, mysterious motives and origins, at once crazy and intelligent..."

Malazan,32kni4,SageOfTheWise,3,Thu Apr 16 01:35:48 2015 UTC,27% DG surely is taxing emotionally. All the dead of the Wickan / SC clash and the mines... yikes!
Malazan,32kni4,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:51:31 2015 UTC,About the Deck in another series - are you talking about the Amber series by Roger Zelazny? A family friend who used to advance read for Steven Erikson told me about the similarities.
Malazan,32kni4,danaran,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:12:36 2015 UTC,I was talking about the Lightbringer series by Weeks. I do think though stolen might be too harsh a word. Perhaps 'inspired' would be better in this context. Let's say Weeks was inspired by the Malazan books. Heh.
Malazan,32kni4,SageOfTheWise,2,Tue Apr 14 20:47:19 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure weeks states that the card game in lightbringer was inspired by magic the gathering rather than malazan.

Malazan,32gstg,jsfsmith,10,Mon Apr 13 18:04:18 2015 UTC,"In terms of books like Malazan, I would heartily recommend The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolf. I would say it fulfiils the first 4 requirements, and possibly the 5th as well. It is more sci-fi than fantasy, but I think anyone who liked Malazan should at least give it a shot."
Malazan,32gstg,SiroccoSC,5,Mon Apr 13 23:05:13 2015 UTC,"can confirm, loved Malazan, book of the new sun blew my mind. i need to reread it, because it is definitely dense enough to merit one."
Malazan,32gstg,cantlurkanymore,1 point,Tue Apr 14 13:06:23 2015 UTC,I've read it and loved it! Maybe I should go read it again one of these days.
Malazan,32gstg,lutzenburg,10,Tue Apr 14 18:13:16 2015 UTC,"Of the books I mentioned, to give an example, I'd say that Kay's Kitai series satisfies point 1 (world larger than the story itself), but falls short on all other points. Rothfuss's Kingkilller Chronicle doesn't really satisfy any of them, with the possible exception of point 4 (uncertainty of knowledge). Tolkien, to fall back on a staple, satisfies points 1 and 3 (faith in the reader's intelligence) but no more than that. George RR Martin satisfies 2, 3, and kind of almost satisfies 1 and 4, but falls short in fairly key respects.  I think maybe my standards are too high."
Malazan,32gstg,Silcha,2,Mon Apr 13 18:08:38 2015 UTC,I have never found another series quite like Malazan so I would probably say your probably right about the high standards.  Great list.  I couldn't find a trying I disagreed with.
Malazan,32gstg,xenianadrift,8,Tue Apr 14 02:39:43 2015 UTC,My standards have gone through the roof since reading MBotF it makes finding books difficult.
Malazan,32gstg,Silcha,6,Mon Apr 13 19:27:26 2015 UTC,"I love it, well said. Malazan hits so many key points for me. It leaves behind preconceptions to a much higher degree than other works. Where others might 'think outside the box,' Erikson questions why it's a box in the first place. ASoIaF might illustrate the terrible reality of, say, a feudal society, but Malazan gives us the tragedy and catharsis necessary to push us beyond it - to see the 'game' for what is really is, a set of chains with which we bind ourselves.  It also captures a sense of 'epic' that hasn't been touched in modern fantasy. Sure, ASoIaF is huge and intricate, but it reads like the song it is. And despite its linguistic coupling, Lord of the Rings is just a pastoral, idealistic tale of good and evil. Malazan reads like a piece of human history. It forces the reader to think in terms of centuries and millenia, instead of days and lifetimes.  MBotF is the freakin' gauntlet of fantasy, and it deserves to be the standard with which to be compared."
Malazan,32gstg,sidthecoolkid,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:39:28 2015 UTC,Very well said. I agree completely
Malazan,32gstg,titanemesis,3,Wed Apr 15 18:35:58 2015 UTC,"My biggest issue with other fantasy novels like Sanderson's and Rothfuss's is that they spend way too much time thinking up the intricacies of the magic systems than on the story.   For worlds that have such a good understanding of magic, they sure are shitty places to live."
Malazan,32gstg,greater_golem,3,Tue Apr 14 05:52:24 2015 UTC,"There's also the other aspect we take for granted: that genuine effort has been made to create new races, species and creatures to populate Wu, Instead of defaulting to Humans, orcs, dwarfs, elves and hobbits/gnomes/halflings etc.  Asides from all the variations of 'human' (including the rather distinct blue 'Napan' variant), we also have the Jaghut (and their offshoots), the Imass, the Tiste, the For'Krul Assail, the K'Chain Che'malle and Nah'Rukh, the Toblakai, the Trell... and probably more; I'm fairly certain I've forgetten a few.  Sure, some of those do bear a resemblance to more conventional Fantasy races (the are some similarities between the Jaghut and Orcs, the Tiste and elves), but even in those cases the Erikson/Esselmont version have their own unique identity and characteristics.  Dragons are about the only mainstream fantasy creatures to populate Wu (although, they're pretty distinct in how they operate / feature as well).  I personally think it's pretty cool, and particularly remarkable when you compare the Malazan Book of the Fallen to something like Salvatore's Drizzt series."
Malazan,32gstg,NoFortress,7,Tue Apr 14 13:28:27 2015 UTC,"I think your list does a great job at teasing out the academic reasoning behind the books.   However, one of my more powerful reasons for loving the series is a bit more mundane: wonderful characters. Erikson makes us grieve RG Spoiler, laugh out loud with Tehol and Bugg, and, most difficult of all, takes Anomander (a Mary-Sue character in lesser hands) and makes him worthy of the respect everyone pays him in the story.  Another reason I love the series is the quality of the prose. Someone could tick all of your boxes above whilst not being able to compare to the overall effect of reading Erikson's writing. It's made it difficult to appreciate other authors as much (and the step-down has thwarted my efforts to read Esslemont's share).  As for nomination... it's difficult. The best I can come up with right now is Sanderson's The Stormlight Archive series. Due to only being 20% through 1 is not yet proven. I would say it does a good job of qualifying for 2, 3, 4. I think it doesn't go deeply (yet) into the themes of 5 (Vorinistic views of gender aside) so it would not qualify for that. It's really good, no Malazan (but what is?)  edit: Apologies, I made an (apparently poor) assumption that anyone reading a post about the whole series themes would have finished the core story. Mea culpa."
Malazan,32gstg,androgymouse,11,Mon Apr 13 19:40:16 2015 UTC,"I don't know, man. I really enjoy Sanderson's work, but I would not recommend any of his stuff given what the OP is looking for. In terms of ""show, don't tell"", Sanderson is basically at the opposite end of the spectrum as Erikson. I cannot think of another author with more blatant exposition than Sanderson. He is admittedly much better in The Stormlight Archive than his previous books, but I feel he still needs to improve in this area. Quite a bit of his ""witty"" dialog can also be cringe-worthy (e.g. Shallan).  He has stated in interviews that he dislikes dark, morally ambiguous stories (he could not read past A Game of Thrones for this reason) and he prefers to write about the traditional ""good"" hero. I do enjoy me some Sanderson; however, I do not think he will sate the Malazan appetite."
Malazan,32gstg,Soontaru,3,Mon Apr 13 20:26:45 2015 UTC,"It's such a shame, because I think  Sanderson is the grandmaster of sensible magic (which I love). Surgebinding and Allomancy are some of the most logical, cinematic, and badass magic systems out there, but damn I wish he could write for a more mature audience. Still a big fan though."
Malazan,32gstg,greater_golem,6,Mon Apr 13 20:47:24 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm going to read the Stormlight Archive, don't worry. I'm sure it will satisfy at least one or two of these points.   A note about 5 - it's possible to have cultures which share a lot of our own culture's faults and still satisfy this one... Erikson himself does so. Look at the misogynistic Barghast culture, for example, or the endemic racism and communal violence that seems to plague the Malazan Empire.  Regarding moral ambiguity, one of the really special characteristics of Erikson's writing, in my opinion, is that while he writes morally ambiguous stories, they're not necessarily either dark or nihilistic. Rather, there's a deep and profound humanity that runs through all of his characters, even the least sympathetic. For Erikson, everyone is at least partly good. With Martin or R. Scott Bakker (to throw in another example), it's the opposite - everyone's at least partly evil. I don't know of ANY other fantasy author who has taken Erikson's approach successfully."
Malazan,32gstg,Giotto,3,Mon Apr 13 21:02:43 2015 UTC,"I feel like most of themes that you describe are a direct product of Erikson's unparalleled character writing.  He really understands that no one is the bad guy in their own personal narrative, and that everyone has their own values, motives and goals. I think the moral ambiguity and ontological uncertainty come from the unique voice, perspective and experiences of each character, and the tremendous size of the universe follows from the fact that he just writes so damn many people into his novels!  The epic timeline also adds to the size of the world, as do the extremely well-thought-out social/political/cultural interactions between factions. But this makes perfect sense, doesn't it, because what are the factions but macro-characters in the over-arching plot? His background in anthropology and archaeology I think give the Malazans, the Letherii, the Barghast, the Shake etc. this wonderful completeness - from the smallest details to their larger motivations, they just feel real."
Malazan,32gstg,aleifur,1 point,Tue Apr 14 04:54:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, good points. In retrospect, not the best recommendation after all (in my meagre defence it was the only thing I could think of).   Perhaps we can see Shallan's crew (Gav et al) be the more morally ambiguous characters with further development?"
Malazan,32gstg,ShamelesslyPlugged,7,Mon Apr 13 22:23:17 2015 UTC,SPOILERS YO DAMN
Malazan,32gstg,therapy,3,Mon Apr 13 22:56:27 2015 UTC,please add a spoiler tag for
Malazan,32gstg,CaptainUnusual,2,Tue Apr 14 04:24:33 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed Sanderson, but I don't feel the same amazement at his work. The magic systems are very well thought out, but many characters and his worlds all feel very flat and one-dimensional to me. Like fast food versus a steak dinner."
Malazan,32gstg,resij,2,Tue Apr 14 16:23:11 2015 UTC,"The reader is allowed to form his/her own opinions about the central conflict, and decide for themselves who is wrong and who is right.   Well... no, not really. Isn't it pretty obvious who the good guys are? At times our information is limited, and at certain points people change sides. And some minor characters are just not clear. But overall, there is little left for the reader to interpret. These are good characters, these are bad.  Unless I am totally unaware, and there is group of readers that hate Whiskeyjack, the Lord of Darkness, Fiddler, Brys, Tehol, etc.?  edit:   Assumptions carried over from modern society regarding gender, sexuality, race, and other aspects of identity, are consciously and firmly discarded.   At times this is distracting, though. E.g. there are lots of women among the Heavies, but this is a little puzzling unless in their world, sexual dimorphism doesn't exist - which might be the case, but I don't think was ever clarified? Instead, we got some character once saying that ""being a heavy is a state of mind, not a size"" - but that doesn't counterbalance 100 scenes of big, dumb heavies using their size and power to do what heavies are supposed to do.  edit2:   While they are discarded, they are done so without preaching   I would say that there is definite preaching in a few places. Tiny amongst 10 books! But still there, for example, the White-Face Barghast explanations of hobbling."
Malazan,32gstg,therapy,4,Tue Apr 14 01:05:45 2015 UTC,"Disagree about there just being only straight good and bad characters. Who is in the right in the conflict between the T'lan Imass and the Jaghut? Is Laseen evil, or just doing what she needs to? CG spoilers"

Malazan,32dcpl,danaran,7,Sun Apr 12 21:19:59 2015 UTC,"What the hell happened to that book? Did it go along on the Chain of Dogs or something!  Every time a book gets mistreated, a librarian sheds a solitary tear. He doesn't sniffle, though, as that would make way too much noise."
Malazan,32dcpl,JebusGobson,8,Mon Apr 13 07:20:15 2015 UTC,"Haha I knew someone would mention it, the thing is, I have no clue how people keep paper back copies of books in such good conditions. I always carry my books in my bag with me to school, so they always somehow end up getting ruined, you should see my GoTM and and DG copies, they're in tatters. But honestly I see it at as a sign of my love towards the books ^ ^  Also the reason why it already looks so worn out is because I started reading it last year, however stopped for reasons unrelated to the book itself. However I took such a long break that I had forgotten the characters altogether and had to start with GotM again :p"

I genuinely laughed hard on several instances on the book, many of them right at the beginning. The chemistry and dynamism in the groups he presents you, both whole new and familiar ones, are superb.   And here I'm talking about just one aspect of the book! There's much more to it!   I usually rotate two or three books at once, reading a scene or a chapter then reaching the next book on the line. But here I found myself diving for aeons in MoI before feeling able to rotate!"

Malazan,32d3de,danaran,6,Sun Apr 12 19:57:30 2015 UTC,Bonehunters is one of my faves in the series. The questions have been covered (you HAVE seen the crucified dragon before) so I'll only  say this:  Prepare to sweat. You'll see what I mean.
Malazan,32d3de,TriscuitCracker,2,Mon Apr 13 01:08:11 2015 UTC,Awesome! I don't wanna give away too much so here we go: 1. Urko is also in HoC. Karsa and Torvald have an interesting stopover 2. Yes. Seemingly random encounter by Pearl and Lostara in Imperial Warren 3. More to come! Wasn't that a short-tail Karsa took on? Not too sure about the Kalam incident's location sorry.  Glad to see you're enjoying it. It's my favourite series thus far.
Malazan,32d3de,Dassembrae78,1 point,Sun Apr 12 23:23:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Can you remind me when Karsa and Torvald met Urko? I thought it was in that tower with the scaffolding after they come to shore, but I just checked and that guy was called 'Keeper' (unless his real name is Urko?). And yeah, Karsa took on a short-tail."
Malazan,32d3de,Mangler51,2,Sun Apr 12 23:33:02 2015 UTC,I believe he fought an erenkal (sp?) that was possessed by the submerged thel akai

Malazan,32d3de,Dassembrae78,2,Mon Apr 13 19:23:52 2015 UTC,"Yep you got it. Karsa got gut-punched something epic. Hmm not explicitly named but there are clues littered throughout as to his real identity. Drowning in the harbour, the empire's funds going down with him etc. In short, yeah :-)"
Malazan,32d3de,Dassembrae78,1 point,Mon Apr 13 01:59:56 2015 UTC,"Ok awesome thanks! Sometimes I miss the non-explicit revelations like that :) Like in MT I didn't get any of the sea/water hints that made the reader think Bugg was Mael, only realized 3/4 through when I was reading the re-read to catch up. Excited for the rest of BH!"
Malazan,32cj6j,agnost0,10,Sun Apr 12 17:11:36 2015 UTC,"When you re-read you'll notice a few weird things. I know that if you Google GotM-isms you'll see a few minor contradictions. Also, Harllo in TTH is older than the timeline could allow him to be, which is an acknowledged inconsistency by SE.   Other than that, the ""ancient"" timeline and what happened in the distant past is all over the place. It is pretty unclear which order the Ritual of Tellan, the Fall of the Crippled God, and the Tiste Civil War occurred in, you can find solid evidence that any one of them must have happened before the others.  It's made even more complicated by the fact that a bunch of people who were around lie about it, and some who weren't like to talk as if they know things that are probably incorrect."
Malazan,32cj6j,JimmyTMalice,6,Sun Apr 12 17:31:53 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that the Ritual of Tellann happened before the Fall of the Crippled God, going by the MoI prologue. Kallor says later on that he was alive before the Ritual, but that was probably just boasting.  Just checked and the first part of the prologue (when the living Imass were still hunting the Jaghut) was nearly 300,000 years before Burn's Sleep, and MoI 120,000 years before Burn's Sleep."
Malazan,32cj6j,DumpTruckJester,5,Sun Apr 12 18:05:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, you have found the evidence for one timeline. If I wasn't on mobile I'd try to look up the others, but you can create a three way cycle of one occurring before the other if you look at the accounts closely."
Malazan,32cj6j,PaxCecilia,3,Sun Apr 12 18:13:08 2015 UTC,"I think in one of the TOR reread Q&As Erikson also says that not even the memories of some of the ancient beings are 100% accurate. Probably as theyve been alive for, literal, ages."

Malazan,32cj6j,MetaBotch,1 point,Mon Apr 13 12:16:44 2015 UTC,"Its okay man, the question was supposed to be for the entire series. although anything other than the first six books should be tagged as spoiler."
Malazan,32cj6j,jsfsmith,2,Mon Apr 13 18:38:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's my point. Fortunately I don't recognize the name... so it shouldn't have spoiled anything for me."
Malazan,32cj6j,Giotto,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:43:51 2015 UTC,"The fall of the Crippeled God is clearly spelt out as having happened 200,000 years after the Ritual of Tellan, which happened sometime after the 33rd Jaghut War. The Tiste Civil War is much vaguer but the events surrounding don't point to the Jaghut being and endangered species, so the Imass Pogroms probably hadn't even started yet. What I'd like to know is which happened first, the fall of the Crippled God, or the fall of the First Empire."

Malazan,32cj6j,jsfsmith,3,Mon Apr 13 16:23:27 2015 UTC,He knows that's the warlord they're fighting. He's saying he heard it somewhere else - he's probably somewhat studied in history/sorcery in general. What he doesn't realize is it's the same Brood he's heard of. They also mention that through history there have been many Nightchills.

Malazan,326lbt,Clearly_a_fake_name,8,Sat Apr 11 00:41:37 2015 UTC,"I'll take a crack at a few.   So, was Tayschrenn posing as Artanthos the entire time, keeping an eye on Dujek? And did Dujek know?   Sort of keeping an eye, plus he's a hidden trump card for the Malazans. I believe Dujek knows.   So... early on in the book, Toc is given a gift by the Ay. Giving him wolf visions. This later manifests itself and I believe he becomes the Wolf king (Togg)?   Sort of correct. The wolf basically rode along in Togg's body without it being like a full on possession.   He enters a new world (The T'lan Imass Warren)? Where the Wolf King stays, but Toc returns to the regular world and is now the Mortal Sword of Togg, in a new body?   I'm pretty sure it's not Tellann. I think it's just a world that was created with the memories of the Imass. It's been awhile since I read it last though.   Toc has taken a new body. Why? Was his old one so badly damaged or something?   His whole body was damaged beyond repair by being in the Matron's embrace. Plus, he impales himself to release Togg. He's pretty much done.   Am I right in thinking he took Anaster's body? Isn't Anaster still alive though? The new Shield Anvil took his pain away, but left him alive?   Yes. Despair was all Anaster had so it leaves him an empty shell.   So, if I understand it correctly, Fener is the god of war and the Greyswords prey to her? (or him??)   Yup.   But during the battle of Capustan, Fener happened to be knocked from the position of God of War (something to do with Duikers hands? I half remember something happening on the Boat in Deadhouse Gates). And at that exact time, Treach took the mantle of God of War, and Gruntle was made Mortal Sword.   Pretty much.   So, I thought Mortal Swords were something related to the Greyswords beliefs. But... Mortal Swords are completely separate to the Greyswords?   Yup, not unique to them.   Do all the gods have Mortal Swords out there?    Not all, but some do.   So, Itkovian has the power to... absorb negative energy / memories from people? Is this a power he gains from Fener, or is it in any way related to the Greyswords?    This power comes from the position of Shield Anvil. He absorbs the pain because the ""psychic wounding"" (there's probably a better term for this) from such slaughter can basically permanently scar the land if it's severe enough. The 3 elder gods in the prologue dealt with Kallor's destroyed empire for much the same reason. It's not solely derived from Fener, however Fener assists him and helps take the burden from him.   So... Itkovian does that for them. Do they no longer have such dread? Do they now have a purpose in life? Are they immortal. Won't they just gain new bad memories and loose will over many thousands of years to come?   They're still the T'lan Imass. He was just able to relieve some of their pain.    At the end, Toc speaks to Tool (not knowing it's him) and Hetan sees him out on the road. However, he is now flesh and blood. Is Tool a Mortal Man now? Is this the case for all T'lan Imass?    It's just Tool. I honestly can't remember exactly what happened since it's been awhile. I believe it was because Silverfox released him from his duty as First Sword.   Does Silverfox some how reinstate or create a new warren / world. In that world, Togg the Wolf is King? Does The Mhybe live here now? With a renewed body? Who else lives here, and can they come and go as they please?   The world exists in a dream created by the Mhybe basically. Silverfox had a part in it. It was also the work of K'rul, Kruppe, the memories of the Imass, and probably some other folks I'm forgetting. I also don't remember why the Beast Throne is there exactly, but Togg and Fanderay claim it.    He obviously becomes friends with Talamandas, but I don't recall what happened with Quick Ben and Paran during the battle? Do they push the Seer into a Warren and deal with him there? Away from the rest of the battle.   They capture the Seer before anyone else can get to him. They plan to use the Seer's power with Omtose Phellack to help slow the Crippled God's poisoning of Burn."

Malazan,320rn4,Priest_of_Aroo,5,Thu Apr 9 17:35:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think they are yet,  but in the next two books I think we will see them transform into the Hounds of Shadow,  maybe even being part of what turns him into Tulas Shorn! I cannot wait for Fall of Light!!!"
Malazan,320rn4,DAMCARDLE,4,Thu Apr 9 18:43:33 2015 UTC,"They definitely aren't the hounds of dark (aka deragoth) because that name is a misnomer and the deragoth have nothing to do with the Tiste races. (plus the Imass being reffered to as dog-runners impliess the deragoth are already a thing).  I don't think we know anything about the origins of the hounds of light so its really hard to say there. We just know Tulas seems to fear them.  Hounds of Shadow is probably a good bet though. We know Tulas was their original master. And it does sound like these hounds were created by someone as opposed to occurring naturally (with talk of how they are the shadows of the deragoth). It's definitely going to be one of those things we're just going to have to wait for more books to see what happens, but I think its a decent bet that either Tulas does something to the Jheleck to make the hounds of shadow, or together Tulas and the Jheleck cause the creation of them some other way."
Malazan,320rn4,SageOfTheWise,6,Thu Apr 9 18:24:24 2015 UTC,I always thought they called the Imass dog runners because of the Ay...
Malazan,320rn4,Dumien,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:28:00 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't like the real primitive Imass, when the race was just starting out, basically exist as like pets for the Deragoth, running with them during the hunt or something like that? That's what I took the reference for."
Malazan,320rn4,SageOfTheWise,7,Thu Apr 9 19:44:33 2015 UTC,"No, the Erasol (i don't think I spelled that right) were ""pets"" of the Deragoth, not the Imass."
Malazan,320rn4,xolotl92,6,Fri Apr 10 00:38:50 2015 UTC,*Eres'al.  But you're right. We this in the warren L'oric goes to when he's looking for Osserc.
Malazan,320rn4,SiroccoSC,1 point,Fri Apr 10 01:06:56 2015 UTC,"Yup, and they talk about it a few times.  I never put the kids and the hounds together by the way...my head is blown right now..."

Malazan,320rn4,Dumien,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:12:15 2015 UTC,I always assumed it to be the Ay as well.  I don't remember anything linking the Imass to the deragoth.
Malazan,320rn4,AllWrong74,1 point,Fri Apr 10 05:46:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, but I think the name in FoD is from their relationship with the Ay. Isn't that reference from something with L'oric while he was looking for his father?"
Malazan,320rn4,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:16:31 2015 UTC,It is something we learn with L'oric while he was looking for his father. Doesn't make it less relevant though. The Ay thing could be what they meant though. Either way it doesn't make a difference in my point that they can't be the hounds of darkness.
Malazan,320rn4,Giotto,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:23:06 2015 UTC,"no, and I think you're right in that. I was trying to get a better view of when the deragoth reference comes into play, not use it to refute your claim. also goes along with the nature of shadow, light, and darkness. Darkness being a concept older than the harnessing of it by the Tiste and light and shadow being concepts derived from the rift caused by the civil war."
Malazan,320rn4,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:26:49 2015 UTC,"are we sure the Imass are the dog runners, and not the eres'al?"
Malazan,320rn4,Giotto,1 point,Fri Apr 17 21:23:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah so that post ended up being a little wrong on the dog runner thing. The Eres'al were the ones that ran with the Deragoth. The Imass ran with the Aye. So that's why the Imass are called dog runners.  I'd have to look into Forge of Darkness again to be sure, but I'm pretty sure they weren't talking about the eres'al during all that."
Malazan,31z0hx,AllWrong74,12,Thu Apr 9 06:53:06 2015 UTC,"It still relates to Whiskeyjack's death but the line that got me was Anomander Rake to Picker when he said ""...there is a solider there that I would pay respect to""   Geez, I lost it at that line."
Malazan,31z0hx,shekkie,2,Thu Apr 9 17:36:42 2015 UTC,Yeah. That did it for me too. The scenes with Rake and Whiskeyjack ... they were pretty intense.

Malazan,31vsge,ScottyBeans,2,Wed Apr 8 16:41:04 2015 UTC,Kruppe knew because he was Kruppe.  He always just knows things.
Malazan,31vsge,turnpikenorth,2,Thu Apr 9 03:39:54 2015 UTC,"There are two possibilities in my opinion:  The most likely one is that Kruppe implanted a suggestion in Scorch and Leff's minds so that they would open fire. While Kruppe's warren is never explicitly stated, it's almost certainly mockra, he temporarily wipes Murillio's mind in, I believe, GotM, to prevent him from realizing Kruppe was the Eel and he commonly uses magic to allow himself to steal food out of plain site. Kruppe's mental prowess is mentioned on multiple occasions so it doesn't seem unlikely that he might do this.  The other possibility is that Scortch and Leff aren't actually as stupid as they act and had been convinced by Kruppe to fire their crossbows at the Tyrant. The first possibility seems to fit more with their characterization however."
Malazan,31vsge,ShadowLordX,1 point,Sat Apr 11 23:10:19 2015 UTC,"Wow, okay, I did not put that together at all. Thank you.

Malazan,31vsge,Silcha,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:41:31 2015 UTC,"BaB is good, but a little more... subdued than his other books. Less action. I just finished Assail, and it's my favorite of ICE's books.

Malazan,31tgwe,Tyrannosoren,17,Wed Apr 8 00:58:30 2015 UTC,"Yay questions! Here's what I got:  1) Does the Crippled God come from another dimensions? Do demons? From other realms, but I like to think of them as other dimensions. I think it remains open ended in terms of what exactly constitutes a ""realm.""  2) Why do the (T'Lan) Imass and Jaghut hate each other? They don't hate each other. The Imass swore a never ending war against the Jaghut to prevent future Tyrants (like Raest from Gardens of the Moon). It's a bit of an irrational war, as you'll learn repeatedly throughout the series, because the Jaghut don't live together and don't have any real aspirations to conquer the world. Read more and find out!   3) Is Dassem Ultor dead? I thought he Ascended. Did he Ascend before or after he betrayed Hood? Loaded question, read more and find out!  4) How did humans (Malazans specifically) evolve from T'lan Imass if they can't reproduce? What about the * other human races eg. Wickans? I think humans are (possibly) genetic descendants of the Imass pre-T'lan ritual. You'll learn more about how the Imass became the T'lan Imass throughout the series, but there's a good bit of it in Memories of Ice. The comment on the Malazans being their true children is likely analogous to the fact that the Malazans have become the greatest army in the world.  5) What benefits are there to Ascension? Power. Near-immortality. Worshippers.  6)Did Kellanved go crazy after he Ascended? What about Dancer? Another loaded question. Not sure insane is the word. Dancer is cool as a cucumber. They are great and complex characters. Read more and find out.  7) Is Rake a Soletaken or D'ivers? Soletaken. D'ivers is a shapeshifter who becomes many. Soletaken is a shapeshifter that remains one. D'ivers = the rats, leopards etc from DG. Soletaken = Andii who veer into dragons.  8) Why was Wiskeyjack demoted? What was he before he was a sergeant? Because he was too popular and threatened the status quo of political power in Laseen's empire. I can't remember what his role/title had been.  9) Who were the children Shadowthrone gave to Kalam? Weren't these kids killed by the Whirlwind fanatics?  10) Did crows retrieve Sormo's soul after he died? 11) Did crows come for Coltaine's soul? To avoid spoilers for both of these questions I will just say RAFO, especially ICE's books.  12) Why did Kellanved adopt Shadowthrone and Ammanas as names? I think it's an arbitrary question about how naming works in these books. I don't know if I'd read too much into it, but someone else can correct/chastise me here if appropriate.  13) Did he Ascend with his Hounds? Or were they already there? Teensy tiny minor spoilers: That should answer you in the most vague way possible, but still marking for spoilers to be safe.  14) Did he overthrow anyone to take over House Shadow? Read and find out.  15) Was Ganoes successful in freeing the Hounds from Dragnipur? Yes – it's said in Gardens of the Moon, I believe, but will come up again in Memories of Ice.  16) Do only certain people become powerful from entering an Azath House? A complicated question that doesn't really get answered in a clear way. We're still learning about the Azath.  17) Why did Kellenved and Dancer need to go to Deadhouse before Ascending? Not sure they needed to, but you should learn more about why it may have been a good idea in the next book.  18) Are people born Aspected to a warren? I don't think so, but defer to others on this one.   19) When is Rallick coming back? Answer may be called a minor spoiler, but you can find out by reviewing all of the dramatis personae for each book on Amazon soooo  Let me know how I did!"
Malazan,31tgwe,future_forward,2,Wed Apr 8 02:40:16 2015 UTC,Thanks this is super helpful
Malazan,31tgwe,maharei1,7,Wed Apr 8 02:51:22 2015 UTC,"A couple minor additions:  4) Not all Imass were part of the ritual.  For various reasons, a few here and there were left out.  You'll see more about it later. If humans are in fact direct Imass descendants, it was probably from those. Or it might be possible that the genetic split happened prior to the Ritual. I'm almost positive that there are contradictory statements about this contained in the series, so you can try to work out who to believe for yourself.  6) The more you learn about Kellanved, the more you realize that he was probable crazy before Ascension. Or maybe that he isn't crazy at all.  8) I believe that Whiskeyjack was a Fist or High Fist, and he used to be Dujek's superior (you might see an exchange between them in MoI about this). The soldier that Paran talks to as a child in the very beginning of GotM is WJ when he was still at the top, and you can see how he views Laseen in that scene.  9) Remember there was a section where Kalam comes across a bunch of crucified children? The aptorian demon that was accompanying him at the time took it upon herself to deliver them to Shadowthrone because it was what Kalam wanted. ST healed them grudgingly and then had to figure out something to do with them.  18) What do you mean by ""people""? Because most (all?) non-human races have at least one warren, generally an Elder Warren (which isn't really the same thing, tbh) associated with them.  For lack of a better way of saying it, humans might be committed to a warren at birth or have an affinity with one in some manner, but I'm not aware of any pure human beings that were created with an aspect."
Malazan,31tgwe,maharei1,0,Wed Apr 8 03:06:02 2015 UTC,Very minor addition: 8) Whiskeyjack was Fist and commander of the 2nd army
Malazan,31tgwe,majiinbuu,0,Thu Apr 9 23:08:09 2015 UTC,Oh also for Kellanveds ascending you might want to read Night of Knives
Malazan,31tgwe,end_O_the_world_box,2,Thu Apr 9 23:09:34 2015 UTC,"12) Why did Kellanved adopt Shadowthrone and Ammanas as names? I think it's an arbitrary question about how naming works in these books. I don't know if I'd read too much into it, but someone else can correct/chastise me here if appropriate.   I remember reading somewhere that the gods can zero in on you if you use their names or think about them. I thought maybe he chose Shadowthrone cause if someone thinks or talks about the Throne of Shadow he could potentially know about it. Might be a bit of a stretch, but I thought it was an amusing possibility."
Malazan,31tgwe,jsfsmith,3,Wed Apr 8 03:24:09 2015 UTC,"I'm in the middle of MoI, so I don't know much more than you should, but I'll still be careful with spoilers and such.  1) Not sure where the Crippled God came from. I think another dimension. Not the Warrens. Demons come from Warrens. The Aptorian from DG was from the Warren of Shadow. It's possible there are some other demons from outside the Warrens, but I don't think they've been mentioned in the series thus far. Demons are basically just the normal beings from their planes of existence; they're not inherently hateful or spiritual or anything like that.  2) This one is revealed in MoI  3) I'm super unclear on Dassem Ultor myself  4) T'lan Imass are undead as a result of a massive ritual they took part in to make them live forever in order to kill the Jaghut. Before that they had normal flesh and didn't look dissimilar to humans, and they could also reproduce.   5) As I understand it, ascension makes you immortal and very powerful, but you aren't necessarily in charge of your own warren, and you don't have worshippers. Godhood is the next step up: more power, you're in charge of a warren, and you get worshippers. Depending on the shape your religion takes, though, it might change your nature.  6) I don't know much about their sanity. They seemed sane at the beginning of GotM, when Dancer possessed Sorry, but at the end of DG, Shadowthrone seemed completely batshit. I don't know.  7) Soletaken. Soletaken is shifting into one thing, D'ivers is shifting into multiple.  8)Whiskeyjack was demoted so he would have less military power. Before the coup, Whiskeyjack and Kellanved were close. Laseen was suspicious.  9) Remember when Kalam saw all the dying crucified children? He prayed that they would be saved, and the Aptorian worked with Shadowthrone to do it. Then Shadowthrone gave them to Kalam. It's weird, and I'm curious about how it'll play out in the future books.  10) Butterflies came for Sormo's soul.  11) Crows came for Coltaine's soul.  12) I've always seen Shadowthrone as a bit more of a title, but I don't know the actual reason for sure.  13) The Hounds are ancient. I'm not even sure that they're younger than the warren of shadow itself.  14) No, at that time, the throne of shadow was unoccupied.  15) This one is still confusing for me, but I'm pretty sure that scene is revisited several times throughout the series.  16) Not sure what you mean by ""become powerful.""  17) No idea.  18) No, people that end up associated with a warren either choose it or are chosen by someone in it.  19) I don't know yet. Hopefully soon.  Go ahead and ask any follow-up questions if you need to."

Yes, and his dimension is so different than ours that his blood poisons burn.  Demons come from another dimension that is pretty much identical to ours, theres fish, rivers,etc.  2) Why do the (T'Lan) Imass and Jaghut hate each other?   Jaghut are a solitary race, but sometimes, a jaghut tyrant will be born that has an unquenchable desire to dominate. one tyrant named raest found the imass, and enslaved thousands of them for over 3000 years, became their god.  when they learned what was happening, they decided that no matter the cost they would destroy the jaghut race, to prevent this from happening in the future.  tlan dont hate jaghut, they exterminate them for a better future for everyone else (they mention it was their sacrifice)  jaghut hardly notice tlan imass.  3) Is Dassem Ultor dead? I thought he Ascended. Did he Ascend before or after he betrayed Hood?   Dassem was sworn to Hood.  Hood took his daughter and used her as part of some ritual to chain the crippled god a couple of years before the books started, dassem has been chasing him ever since. When the Tlan imass named dassem their first sword, the power of that title split him, part of him is the god dassembrae, lord of tragedy, and part wanders as traveller  4) How did humans (Malazans specifically) evolve from T'lan Imass if they can't reproduce? What about the * other human races eg. Wickans?   not all of the T'lan Imass were able to make it to the ritual in time for various reasons. they lived on and evolved into humans.  5) What benefits are there to Ascension?  power, immortality, if you get worshipers, godhood  6)Did Kellanved go crazy after he Ascended? What about Dancer?   kellanved is ""esentric"" not insane  17) Why did Kellenved and Dancer need to go to Deadhouse before Ascending?  they didnt ""need"" to,  they used the deadhouse as a home base while they started the malazan empire, no one could follow them in there.  while they were there, they found that from an azath house like the deadhouse, they could reach all the other azath houses, as well as other realms.  they then studied these realms,  at the beginning of the books kel and dancer had been gone for over 2 years, most of which was not in the same realm as the malazan world. they used the knowledge adn power gained from this to come back and ascend."
Malazan,31sca5,lazy_cat_warrior,11,Tue Apr 7 20:00:05 2015 UTC,"Regarding the ""power draws power"" - This series usually uses convergences of powerful gods/ascendants to explore how if one powerful entity gets its hands in an conflict or area, other powers will want to negate that and jump into the fray.   Its actually an interesting concept in real like too - how great power countries want to have a say in how things play out around the world if one great power tries to affect change in a region.  This explains why some of the more powerful people in the series want to stay directly out of certain conflicts, or at least not just try to go ""Boom - I'm here and y'all are gonna listen to me or die!"" Because other powers will come in and it will all deteriorate quickly into a huge dangerous battle. Kinda like nuclear deterrence in a way.  Following that, this series is huge and complicated and its hard to understand why some gods/ascendants refuse to show up and go toe-to-toe with others, and instead manipulate and backroom deal in order to influence events to get what they want. Some of them are playing the long-long-long con, so it is interesting to see new gods vs old gods and their different styles of dealing with issues.  That said, usually most of the books end with said convergences where power draws power inevitably, and deals with how the ""little guy"" can make an unexpected difference.   Hope that makes more sense than just rambling and that you get something out of it.  Ninja EDIT: Its a good idea to try to finish the first three before you make a snap judgement, smart! I'm sure you got the idea from reading about how its ""confusing"" and ""the first book shouldn't be a judge for the whole series."" But if you blow through without worrying about every detail, hopefully you'll get as hooked as I did!"
Malazan,31sca5,GokuTheKnight,3,Tue Apr 7 20:48:56 2015 UTC,"Kinda like nuclear deterrence in a way.   I personally always describe the state of the world in these books as a sort of cold war. Everyone is looking at each other, but they're all scared to use their power, out of fear of retaliation.   And because it leaves them weak for a while, the downsides of using your power tend to outweigh the upsides, until the cause because worth the sacrifice, leading to a convergence and a scramble for positions when one opens up."
Malazan,31sca5,Montaron87,4,Wed Apr 8 07:28:27 2015 UTC,"Your the first person to describe it in an interesting way that makes sense. I'll keep that in mind as I begin to reading this series.

Malazan,31sca5,TurboS40,3,Tue Apr 7 22:39:32 2015 UTC,"Hope you enjoy it! Give it two or three books until you get used to Erikson's style. The dramatis personae and the glossary in the back of the book are your friends.   Erikson tends to not do infodumps and can be heavy on the introspective philosophy. The first 3/4 of each book is usually character building, plot, history, etc, and the last quarter are when the epic craziness starts and next thing you know it's 4 in the morning and you have to work at 7 but you can't stop now.   He wrote the first book 9 years before the second and it shows a bit, but he is an archeologist and an anthropologist so his world building skills are second to none. Every place a character visit feels ancient, every race you come across has an entire history to it, every millennia-old ascendant has several lifetimes of stories to tell.   You have to piece together the overall arching plot and other things, like how the magic system works, from clues and context of various characters and what you experience through the characters. It's all part of the fun, seeing how all this will fit together and where it's going. You go back and forth between continents and characters and plots.   It's an amazing, wonderful, crying into the books, epic ride. It's even better on a re-read in its own way. Of course, no series is for everybody, so if you don't like it, at least give it through book 2 or 3, but no shame if it's not for you. I hope you enjoy it! Please stop by the sub and post your impressions good or bad, or if you have any questions we'll keep it spoiler free or tell you to read on!   Welcome to a wonderful book series, you have so far to go, and I envy you reading it for the first time. GoTM just scratched the surface.   EDIT: holy crap, those subterranean editions are beautiful...seriously if you end up not liking the series you could probably sell those to somebody on this subteddit."

Malazan,31s8bf,WingedBeing,11,Tue Apr 7 19:31:45 2015 UTC,Read them after you finish the entirety of Erikson's books.
Malazan,31s8bf,Tarcanus,3,Tue Apr 7 19:52:38 2015 UTC,"This. I waited 3 years after finishing MBoTF to read ICE's work and I don't regret at ALL not reading them while I read MBoTF. I honestly think they would have upset the pace of the main series. It's easy enough for me to review old books, refresh my memory of what's going on, and slot the events of the ICE novels in appropriately."
Malazan,31s8bf,Tumblehawk,2,Tue Apr 7 21:52:09 2015 UTC,"I read RotCG between RG and TtH.   On the one hand, I think it provided some much-needed context for the last three Erikson books, particularly regarding Traveller and... certain occurrences... in the Empire.  On the other, as you say, it upset the pace. RotCG is a work in which ICE is still kind of figuring out the ropes of the doorstopper novel, and it's far from the best entry in the Malazan canon."
Malazan,31s8bf,jsfsmith,3,Tue Apr 7 23:54:27 2015 UTC,"You should just read them after the main series. And you should read them in their own order. Night of Knives, Return of the Crimson Guard, Stonewielder, Orb Scepter Throne, Blood and Bone, Assail."
Malazan,31s8bf,SageOfTheWise,6,Tue Apr 7 20:13:37 2015 UTC,Return of the Crimson Guard is the only one I would suggest you read as it has a major part of a characters arc in it and the death of a very significant character that would be spoiled if you just read Eriksons ten books.
Malazan,31s8bf,DAMCARDLE,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:11:21 2015 UTC,"I wish I had known this before I started.  That death came completely out of the blue for me during DoD (or was it TtH?).  No context, no nothing.  Felt weird man."

Malazan,31s8bf,DAMCARDLE,2,Thu Apr 9 20:18:42 2015 UTC,"That's kind of the eternal question. On the sidebar is a chronological reading order if you want to intersperse Esselmont with the main series.   However...most people myself included will tell you to read the main 10 book Erikson series and then read Esselmont.  Or do a reread of the main series and incorporate Esselmont into it. There are currently 6 Esselmont books dealing with backstory subplots that are only hinted at in Erikson's series. Esselmont is a good writer, in my opinion, not as good as Erikson, but for he backstory and getting your Malazan fix he is essential.   Night of Knives Return of the Crimson Guard Stonewielder Orb Sceptre Throne Blood and Bone Assail  Erikson also has the first of the Kharkanas trilogy out with Forge of Darkness set thousands of years in the past. He is also going to write another trilogy based on a character you haven't met yet. Esselmont is also going to write a new prequel trilogy as well.  There are also novellas dealing with two lovingly evil characters from Memories of Ice written by Erikson.  TLDR: Recommend reading the main 10 book series by Erikson first! But hey, to each their own, read however you like."
Malazan,31s8bf,TriscuitCracker,2,Tue Apr 7 19:58:58 2015 UTC,"The old sidebar, that got changed at least 6 months ago. Now they'd have to follow the top link to the ToR reread to get a reasonable idea of the chronology. Though is google it and find a discussion because IIRC that one's slightly poorly ordered.   I think if anyone is keen enough and finds themselves liking NoK they should at least try to read RotCG interspersed with the main series, at least then you don't have one of the more interesting ICE plot lines ruined by the main series. Best of both worlds!"
Malazan,31s8bf,MoranthMunitions,2,Tue Apr 7 20:54:36 2015 UTC,"I've only read the series once, am currently reading Assail, and still have FoD to go. I also interspersed ICE's books in. From what I've read, NoK should come after MT, RotCG after Bonehunters, and SW after TtH. The others were to be read after the main series.  Honestly, I liked the extra worldbuilding that these books provided. There is a lot of back story and interesting characters that sort of disappear from the main series but have major roles in ICE's books. The writing style is definitely a bit jarring at first but I think the plot points outweigh any negatives.  TL;DR Read ICE books during first time through series. Would recommend."

Malazan,31s8bf,Aiolus,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:35:22 2015 UTC,"I'll throw my vote towards interspersing them into the main series, in the order that they were released (can be found easily enough online).  It really depends on your preference though. Erikson and Esslemont have fairly different narrative tones, and it can be a bit jarring jumping between them. However, there are a couple events/characters that do get referenced between both series', and skipping Esslemont's books might leave you a bit confused or fuzzy on a few points (most notably, the events of RotCG have an impact on the main series starting with TtH I believe)."
Malazan,31s8bf,crossfire87,1 point,Sat Apr 11 20:37:01 2015 UTC,"I think deciding to read ICE's works during the book of the fallen depends entirely on each reader.   Personally the old guard and the heartland of the empire were of great interest to me and references to the crimson guard always piqued my curiosity. Esselmont's books begin centred on these locations and characters. I read RotCG before Dust of dreams because, well, dod wasn't out yet, but I think if I were to do it all over I would still read rotcg during the main series. I like the world building.  Of course there are many readers who could care less about what's happening elsewhere in Wu. They could be primarily attracted to the characters of the fallen or Erikson's style. To these readers I'd suggest reading the fallen straight through."
Malazan,31r4fk,thevorminatheria,9,Tue Apr 7 14:49:21 2015 UTC,"Warrens and Elder Warrens are completely unrelated things, they just have generally similar functions in modern day Wu, hence the misnomer (The Malazan series loves misnomers).  The Elder Warrens were originally called holds, which is a term also used a bunch in the series. Which term gets used depends on the person.   K'rul made the warrens, he had nothing to do with the holds that came before."
Malazan,31r4fk,SageOfTheWise,3,Tue Apr 7 14:55:47 2015 UTC,"OK, understood.   But I still don't get how an abandoned region of a world can become a separate Hold/Elder Warren? So Jaghut reached out to elemental forces of their home world (Omtose Phellack) and Tiste Andii reached out to elemental forces of their home world (Kurald Galain). I was shocked when I realized it's the same shared world.  That being said, I think we well get more clarity on the topic in the Kharkanas series as we still need to see how the Tiste schism and the migration to Wu play out. Or, at least I hope we will!"
Malazan,31r4fk,SageOfTheWise,8,Tue Apr 7 15:06:59 2015 UTC,"This is where things get really confusing and we're going to have to see how the rest of the trilogy plays out to make sense of it. My guess though is that Omtose Phellack the warren and Omtose Phellack the city are not the same thing, one is just named for the other (don't ask me which was named for which though)  Get's even more confusing when you remember that Jaghut are a race native to Wu."
Malazan,31r4fk,YoohooCthulhu,3,Tue Apr 7 15:13:39 2015 UTC,"I think the best explanation is that there's a loose distinction between ""holds"" and ""worlds"".  The realms of the tiste seem to have properties of both.  So it would make sense if ""holds"" (or a subset of them) are more or less worlds.  So a world is also a hold, but not vice versa.    What then of other worlds? Well, remember there are holds that people forget about.  The dinosaur hold, and the realms beyond chaos where the emerald statues come from.  Also note the large selection of mysterious locations that seem to be accessible within the azath.  So I think there are way more ""holds"" than people think of/remember and that's how there can be lots of worlds.  This raises the question of wu.  It seems to be unique in that there isn't a ""power"" associated with it. Which either means it's an energy neutral nexus, or it has powers that are not appreciated (maybe samar's and bottle's powers are examples?)"
Malazan,31r4fk,Czarcastick,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:19:00 2015 UTC,When SE decided to do a prequel he went back and revisited the whole aspect of the World we knew in Book of the Fallen my guess is he decided to change some things to fit everything into the series. Remember this is way before anything we saw in books 1-10. You should check out the Malazan Empire forums on the main Malazan website they have a lot of threads on FoD that clears up this issue. Some of the people there have been reading and rereading this series since the first day Gardens of the moon came out.
Malazan,31r4fk,cantlurkanymore,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:19:12 2015 UTC,Are holds and elder warrens really the same thing? I never got that impression.
Malazan,31r4fk,jsfsmith,6,Thu Apr 9 19:47:18 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna make a small correction and say we know the TISTE migrated to Wu at a later date. We don't know how everyone else got there and I think it's equally valid to speculate that the world of FoD is changed by the removal of certain portions that become the three tiste realms. The imass, jaghut, FA and TTT may have never migrated at all.   Then again I could be wrong. Can't wait for the next two kharkanas books."
Malazan,31r4fk,cantlurkanymore,2,Tue Apr 7 15:23:17 2015 UTC,"I think this is probably a good guess.  One thing I'm hoping the Kharkanas books will clear up is how the Forkrul Assail  and Jaghut can have elder warrens all their own and still be considered ""native"" to Wu."
Malazan,31r4fk,valorcurse,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:39:25 2015 UTC,"Well don't forget about the jaghut bridge of death paran visited, in the jaghut underworld they apparently abandoned. A realm created by the jaghuts belief in an afterlife, abandoned when they ditched the idea themselves. They seem to have an incredible potential to create, the jaghut.   On the other hand, I'm not so sure the FA elder warren is physical. If we're talking about akhrast korvalain I'd consider it more purely energy, like thyrlan."

I would love to see Jag and T'lan Imass from that style.  Also, I would like a more varied class choice.  To be a swordsman that can rival the Seghul, or a sapper throwing munitions around, an assassin learning to shadow dance (or was taught as a child).  This world would also make an unbelievable MMO"
Malazan,31ouh4,xolotl92,2,Tue Apr 7 01:27:18 2015 UTC,Oh Darksiders style would be cool. I was also thinking along those lines like Kingdom of Amalur. Honestly this series is versatile it could easily fit into tons of art styles.

The Souls' games also have a very special way that they marry the mechanics and lore. I think that it would work perfectly with the MBotF universe."

Malazan,31pyaq,sleepinxonxbed,10,Tue Apr 7 06:11:40 2015 UTC,"Ok the below have started to address your question however have concentrated on the technical side, Im assuming you're a bit more curious about how such a vast and detailed world can originate from a board game. So let me give you my spin on how I understand this (please keep in mind that Im only on book 3 so my experience may be limited)  As u/Ins4int explained, D&D and the Gurps system are two sets of different role playing rules. D&D has a fantasy focus and with a rule book, character models, boards, character books, lets you create your own fantasy setting and story in which your friends will go on adventures. The GURP system is more general and is meant to provided you with a set of rules to apply to any setting of your choosing, not just fantasy.  Erikson and Esslemont come from a background where fantasy was introduced to them through rpg's,  the original ones with pen and paper, like D&D for example. The world of Malazan was originally created by the two as a setting for their Roleplaying adventures. Using Gurps (I believe), the two created a vast background story with many characters and actually played out many of the battles that you have/will read in the series. It got to the point however that the world was simply to immense to simply keep track in ones head, so of course when you play a game like that you're gonna be writing allot of details down, this is presumed knowledge as this is the only way I see this developing the way it did, and it makes sense since most people who carry out complex fantasy games will keep notes in one form or the other. Anyways it did get to the point where Erikson and Esselmont realised that the world they had created was becoming to large and complex for it to simply be a board game. With a shit ton of notes and written material probably already at hand, it must have been around that time when the two were like ""fuck, we could write some books about this"" and they did. Erikson however first wrote GotM as screenplay, it was respectfully rejected I believe, and eventually turned into the first novel.  So yeah I hope that helps to answer your question a bit. if you need help visualising, look up a video of a game of D&D or better yet Warhammer to get a grasp of how a game could look like, then try and imagine the entire malazan world being played out on it, realise its close to impossible, and then you'l understand why it developed into a series :)"
Malazan,31pyaq,HumbleAsFudge,5,Tue Apr 7 10:08:37 2015 UTC,"Good Post! Except they decided to write a screen play, not a novel. GotM was originally conceived as a screen play."
Malazan,31pyaq,drae-,1 point,Tue Apr 7 16:47:01 2015 UTC,"Right, yea Im aware of that, you're definitely right, however the way I understand it, the reason why it was even able to be considered as a script was because the Universe had gone past a stage where it was being laid out as a rpg, but it had started to move onto paper. I mean its immense, I think its safe to assume that allot of different sections, such as scene, battles and relations had been put down on paper by the time the movie script had been finished :p Thanks btw!  -also, i fixed my original comment to include that info :)"
Malazan,31pyaq,HumbleAsFudge,3,Tue Apr 7 17:28:29 2015 UTC,"It's similar to the younger level fantasy books Dragonlance and by Margaret Weis/Hickman or RA Salvatore's Drizzt series. I and plenty others grew up reading those and they too are based on D&D campaigns. Between these books, Shannara and Eddings, these are what got me into fantasy. Basically the novels are there to provide backstory for your own tabletop adventures. They are also great books in their own right, definitely not in Malazan's caliber, but Malazan is more what you read when you've got a few other fantasy series under your belt.   There's a reason why I name all my wizards in my video games Raistlin. Although Quick Ben has a nice ring to it!"
Malazan,31pyaq,TriscuitCracker,2,Tue Apr 7 13:12:29 2015 UTC,"D'n'D is basically a group of people sitting on a table. One of these people is the DM ('Dungeon Master') and the others are players. The DM tells a story set in a fantasy-world only existing in his and the players' heads and the players play the main characters in this story. The tricky thing for the DM is that he can't foresee his players' reactions to what he is going to tell them. Needless to say, a certain skill in improvising is essential. ;)  In general when people are referring to D'n'D (and I think this applies to SE's case) they could also be referring to the set of rules of DnD, e.g. how to roll dices when you want to attack somebody with a sword or picking a lock. I'd guess SE and Esslemont took the rules of DnD and created their of world of Malazan but to describe action in the world in Malazan they used said set of rules used in DnD gaming worlds.   I have no idea about GURPS but the name (Generic universal role playing system) suggests that it is a system of rules that are more generalised so that they are not only applicable to a certain gaming world as DnD but to a greater number of worlds. Let me illustrate that on an example: Let's say you want to attack somebody with your knife. He's standing in range and has his back turned to you. This is quite easy and in my RPG may result in a chance of 90% of you hitting your target (so you roll a 20-sided dice and it should not show 1 or 2). In a more general set of rules you might be given certain options when designing your combat system. For example there could be options like: An attack from behind always works, or you could take other effects into account, such as the orientation of the sun (your victim might see your shadow when sneaking up from behind) or sounds you make. Just a guess though, correct me if I am wrong.  I am no player of D'n'D but I do have some knowledge about other Role-Playing Games. Sorry for any mistakes. I hope this sheds some light on RPG. :)"
Malazan,31pyaq,Ins4int,3,Tue Apr 7 07:06:10 2015 UTC,"To add onto that : dungeons and dragons has its ruleset tied to its own world. If you and your friends want to play in a different world (James Bond, Lord of the flies,.. Whatever comes to mind) you can use the general ruleset of GURPS to make up your own coherent rules.  The malazhan world, and many of its characters spring from the game of role playing Erickson and his friends came up with."
Malazan,31pyaq,my_phones_account,2,Tue Apr 7 08:39:10 2015 UTC,"Ehhh. The makers of Dungeons and Dragons make multiple campaign settings (Eberron, Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, etc..) in addition to third party settings, or settings/worlds made by the DM or GM. Games like Pathfinder have left D&D behind while maintaining a lineage and building its own Pathfinder setting. The rules and worlds can be connected and related but that is not necessary."

Malazan,31p2mb,TriscuitCracker,7,Tue Apr 7 01:56:17 2015 UTC,"Having just finished MoI, and coming from asoiaf, I wanted to offer a counterpoint to ""throwing away characters""  Yeah just having them retire seems strange (though I feel like the bridgeburners arent actually done from the story) but having them survive everything might seem to unrealistic. I like the feeling of reading about a world's events and not just protagonists with plot armor. To be honest, the amount of people who survived GoTM when some of the events and players are fights on a mythical scale, seemed weird to me. In DG, if Coltaine and the other interesting characters just all survived without complications (since he might be reborn judging by the epilogue), all the buildup about them being in an impossible situation would have been meh since everything just turns out okay. Character deaths in DG had a good balance of achieving something (getting refuges there, awakening Shaik) while not being unrealistically lucky and deus ex machina-y"

Malazan,31pbdl,mucp55,12,Tue Apr 7 02:27:50 2015 UTC,"Eh. Midnight Tides as a starting point would be an interesting experiment. Doesn't mean I'd wish it on someone I knew though. The way it's written makes it feasible to be read as a stand alone more or less, but that doesn't make it a good idea. There's a good reason why it's told as the 5th book and not the 1st. It's just so far and away not relevant yet. Won't really be relevant until book 6 (shocker). Just read the books in order. There's a reason they're written the way they are."
Malazan,31pbdl,SageOfTheWise,5,Tue Apr 7 03:15:43 2015 UTC,"Starting with Night of Knives is ok, I guess, though it ruins certain early hints and reveals in the first two books, in relation to a certain pair of gods. Also IMO Esselmont is by far the weaker writer of the two, I like his books but the Malazan universe isn't quite the same without Erikson's prose bringing it to life. But yeah, NoK's relative accessibility compared to Gardens, and its prequel setting, make me see why someone would recommend it as a starting point.  You definitely should read Gardens of the Moon before Deadhouse Gates though. For several main characters, DG is a direct sequel, so you're not going to have the plot and characterisation context that makes those bits awesome. One of the central plot threads, in fact, will not make as much sense without Gotm."
Malazan,31pbdl,yetanotherhero,5,Tue Apr 7 03:06:00 2015 UTC,"Generally its's recommended you read  the main series in order of publication your first read through. Gardens of the Moon BEFORE Deadhouse Gates.  And frankly I'd skip the rest of the Esselmont books until you're done the main series. But to each your own!  Welcome to the sub! Post any impressions you have we'll keep you spoiler free. You're in for a long, amazing, weepy, epic, fantastic ride."

Malazan,31pbdl,Montaron87,2,Wed Apr 8 00:17:33 2015 UTC,"There's a reason SE wrote the books in a certain order. Switching DG and MOI around is one thing, but as for the rest of the books, my advice is to stick to the main series first, in publication order.  DG before Gardens is silly and if you look at the first timer reactions around this subreddit, the issues with Gardens tend to be overstated a bit."
Malazan,31pbdl,Math2S,1 point,Tue Apr 7 12:02:44 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend that you just go in the order that the main series goes, so Gardens first. It's honestly not that bad and I would think that it flows better to read GotM first just because there are some characters that are in both books and maybe you'd learn about the world better if you read Gardens first."
Malazan,31orui,Just_trying_it_out,4,Mon Apr 6 23:42:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'll admit... MoI is kind of a whiny book when you put it that way I guess. It varies character to character on how justified it is(Paran? makes sense. Silverfox? Sign me up for my 'Kallor was right' t-shirt), but MoI is just such a relentlessly depressing book even for this series that the sheer quantity of depression can get tiring.  Though in some cases I feel like you're contradicting yourself. First you seem to complain that people over react to Whiskyjack's death. You note this being the thing that makes Kallor earn Dragnipur, and not his millenia of tyranny. Or Korlat, the thousand year depressed women, becoming even colder. But then at the end you say people don't react enough to his death, saying it's just like a normal argument?  Also to explain the Kallor thing, they're all these ancient immortals. All of these people have been bitter enemies and close allies and back again so many times holding long standing grudges is usually just a waste of time for these people. Certainly not like Andomander has never betrayed anyone before. I mean sure let them get ahold of you while the hatred is still fresh and you're likely dead, but give them a few decades or centuries too cool off and you'll probably be fine again. If nothing else they'll have 100 years of new enemies and tragedies to be distracted by. Particularly with Anomander's big thing being teaching his people to not just live in the past anymore. Now, does all this apply to Whiskyjack too, or is that actually something special? That remains to be seen at this point.  Anyway, bright side is, you're about to read House of Chains, which focuses largely on two characters who are pretty much the antithesis of the whole long introspective moody type you're not a fan of, albeit they do it in two completely different ways."
Malazan,31orui,SageOfTheWise,2,Tue Apr 7 01:17:51 2015 UTC,"Oh I was saying people complained a lot about other things (like Whiskeyjack having to kill the women of the dead seed) so then when it came to his death, their reactions seemed lacking in comparison, since they overreact to everything else.  Yeah that's how I explained Kallor not being chained up already to myself, but I guess just his use of draganipur in general seems strange. Like how everyone sees it as a horrible fate and last resort (like how Kallor's horrible betrayal now finally qualifies him) yet it's also basically Rakes first line of physical defense lol   Doesnt it seem like he would understand just because people are on the other side of a conflict doesnt make them immediately deserving of being enchained forever? He doesnt seem to have a ""I'll just kill this opponent"" option. In MoI we hear about how when he visited the Seguleh and fought through them, the ones he defeated are imprisoned now. Isnt he all about being just? Cause that seems a bit rude to the Seguleh"
Malazan,31orui,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Tue Apr 7 02:36:02 2015 UTC,"Do they say the Segulah he defeated are imprisoned now? I want to say that happened before he got the sword? If not, well, there's only so much you can do when and entire island of people keep rushing you with swords. (Not to mention, he's had a long life. He's not always been the Stalwart man of today) Similar thing with the women of the dead seed, he doesn't want to have to use it against people undeservingly, but he will if he has to. And you're probably now asking the logical question, why doesn't he just not carry that one around 24/7 and only bring it out when needed. There's reasons. They will go into it eventually."
Malazan,31orui,quadtard,1 point,Tue Apr 7 03:10:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah I figured the sword thing might have more to it thatll be explained, since MoI has Paran talking to Draconus about the sword either needing more people or destroyed soon.

Malazan,31orui,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Tue Apr 7 03:26:40 2015 UTC,He has Draginpur when he was with and fought the seguleh.  Its shown later in the series beyond a doubt and earlier too I think.

Malazan,31orui,JebusGobson,2,Tue Apr 7 14:50:08 2015 UTC,Idk how to spoiler tag on my phone so suffice it to say that what you allude to not being there in tth is in fact there and there is a scene where what you don't remember does pass and not in passing but goes on for about a whole page and comes back up later in the following sequences.

Anomander's reaction to Whiskeyjack offering to kill the Tenescowri witches wasn't only due to the dramatic nature of it, I think, but just because it was the first time he ever encountered a human that volunteered to carry a bit of the burden of a Tiste Andi. He contemplates as much in Toll The Hounds.  Also, Anomander having to kill people with Dragnipur is a burden for him... It's not like he wants to kill people with Dragnipur, but he has to. Otherwise there won't be enough souls to pull the wagon with the Gate of Darkness, and then... well...   I guess Rake, as someone who has lived practically forever, has a better understanding of what an eternity of dragging a wagon really means. It's a terrible, terrible fate, and while he actually aught to be slaying people with Dragnipur left and right so there's enough souls, he tries and save it for those who 'really deserve' it. But still, it's going to be hard to find people who really deserve so bad a fate... And while you might argue that people  like Kallor indeed deserve it, that's not so clear for the Witches of the Dead Seed. The wretched creatures were crazy and under the influence of a Jaghut Tyrant, after all.  I can't really say more about Dragnipur without it getting too spoilery.  As to all the whining in MoI: yeah, you're right. The whining in the books seems to get less and less the further in the books you go, though, so it seems even Erikson got tired of all the emo introspection."

Malazan,31m274,drynwhyl,14,Mon Apr 6 09:47:03 2015 UTC,"The Deragoth are the Hounds of Darkness. You might remember two of them being released from the statues Trull and Onrack saw back in House of Chains, in the Nascent. The Hounds of Shadow and the Deragoth seem to be linked in some way - the first two hounds were released by two Hounds of Shadow encountering those statues. Those two Deragoth were the ones killed by Karsa, at the end of HoC. Sometime between HoC and Bonehunters, the other five Deragoth were released from the statues.  I'm assuming the reason you're confused is the events at G'danisban, when Paran traps Poleil and Quick Ben saves his sister. Somehow, either due to Paran's influence with the Hounds of Shadow or due to Shadowthrone screwing with Ben, the Hounds of Shadow were led to G'danisban, and because of some kind of link the Deragoth pursued them.   In the end, the Deragoth and the Hounds of Shadow are definitely two distinct groups, with the Hounds of Shadow being under the control of Shadowthrone.  Hairlock was destroyed back in GotM, by a Hound of Shadow.  Edit: I've just gone over it and it seems that the Deragoth also have something against Dejim Nebrahl, who they were fighting and pursuing across the Seven Cities. The Hounds of Shadow interrupted the pursuit and made off with the last of Dejim's D'ivers forms, making the Deragoth chase them.  The Deragoth pursue the Hounds all the way to G'danisban, where the Hounds leave Dejim's body somewhere in the vicinity of the trapped Poleil, causing the Deragoth to take down Poleil in the process of killing Dejim. Afterwards, due to Shadowthrone being a tricksy guy, the Hounds attempt to take down Quick Ben while he attempts to save his sister, but Apsalar fights them off with a Shadow Dance."

Dessimbelackis had the T'rolbarahl hunted down and killed but not before seven T'rolbarahl imparted pieces of their souls into a Mahybe who bore the Dejim Nebrahl, a unique seven D'ivers T'rolbarahl -   'Dejim Nebrahl's seven souls became distinct from one another. D'ivers, yet far more so, not seven who are one, though that could be said to be true - but seven separate in identity, independent yet together.'   After that it's not clear to me whether the Deragoth that first stopped Dejim Nebrahl were the Deragoth race or the Deragoth D'ivers Dessimbelackis himself but either way it seems to be at Dessminbelackis's order that the Deragoth hunt down Dejim Nebrahl and someone(probably Olar Ethil) then sealed away."

Malazan,31n20a,ESGunslinger,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:35:24 2015 UTC,I wonder if this means Erikson is finally having someone revamp his site. I asked him awhile back about having things like appearances at various cons and bookstores be listed on his website and he replied saying that something was in the works.
Malazan,31lsa2,BruceLazer,23,Mon Apr 6 07:01:36 2015 UTC,"I disagree with this so much. Knowing that compassion is one of the central themes of the series I don't get how some readers hate her.   Erikson makes it clear, although not explicitly, that her attitude towards the others is just an armour, and there are few moments where she shows some warm feelings towards them.  She was sent by her sister to a mining camp as a slave when she was just a child. She has been through hell and not all people can handle that kind of hardship in a heroic way. She was just a regular innocent girl and she was torn apart.  How some people miss these things even in a reread is beyond me."
Malazan,31lsa2,grixa,12,Mon Apr 6 10:40:17 2015 UTC,"One can understand all this and still hate the character. I feel for her situation, but that doesn't change the fact that shes a bitch."
Malazan,31lsa2,drae-,8,Mon Apr 6 12:33:33 2015 UTC,I think what damns her in so many readers' eyes is the suffering she directly/indirectly inflicts on at least three characters we kinda like (in DG specifically).
Malazan,31lsa2,future_forward,1 point,Mon Apr 6 14:27:12 2015 UTC,That was exactly it for me. The way she takes it out on them.. Made me hate her

Malazan,31lsa2,grixa,3,Mon Apr 6 16:48:31 2015 UTC,"I agree that she was an innocent (spoiled) girl. I'm looking at both sides of it and I see how she's been damaged and how she reacts and treats people to keep herself safe.   The thing is that she is just so self-righteous, spoiled, devious and generally a gigantic pain in the ass. Yes, I know, she's a teenaget who's been through extremely hard times, which makes my feelings torn on the subject. However, I can't help but have a slight bit of compassion mingled with a large portion of disdain and disgust.  I admire perseverance, loyalty and intelligence most highly in people and while Felisin has some of those traits she uses them in an absolutely abhorrent way. She assumes because she started fucking Beneth that it helped the others and when they tell her otherwise she just assumes that their liars. I understand that she's been abused, that she isn't thinking right and that she's lost and confused.  The main point here is that Felisin is to be pitied, she's stopped behaving like a rational human and become a rabid dog. Which makes me dislike and pity both her and Tavore all the more. (Also, surely Tavore could have dropped some hint, like hey, I'm going to help you escape?)"
Malazan,31lsa2,grixa,2,Mon Apr 6 16:30:59 2015 UTC,"I don't like when people state things like ""I hate Felisin because she's a bitch"" but, well, this time you explained it better and I can see why someone would hate her.  I think one must look past the surface and see the things that make someone behave the way they do. Once we understand those things it's easier to connect with them and pity them."
Malazan,31lsa2,Quantum_Finger,5,Mon Apr 6 17:20:17 2015 UTC,"I should have stated my reasoning better in the original statement. I pity Felisin, I can understand her but I don't think I connect.

Malazan,31lsa2,JebusGobson,2,Mon Apr 6 17:35:54 2015 UTC,Indeed!
Malazan,31lsa2,HumbleAsFudge,10,Mon Apr 6 18:02:31 2015 UTC,"She's a victim. Someone who has had the only life she knew taken from her. From her perspective she was abandoned by her parents, brother and sister. In particular, her sister who she has always held in high regard has betrayed her and thrown her into this unbelievably bad situation. She's a teenager. She's broken. Try and have some sympathy. How would you react if those closest to you threw you into hell and walked away? Tavore didn't even explain her actions to Felsin. Most women I know thrive on communication. Tavore never said, ""I have to do this, please understand, I love you, etc."""
Malazan,31lsa2,BlueLaguna,3,Mon Apr 6 11:59:48 2015 UTC,"She's a victim. Someone who has had the only life she knew taken from her. From her perspective she was abandoned by her parents, brother and sister.   I agree, I do sympathize slightly with her. She has been through hell and back. It's her self righteous attitude that gets me. I know, logically, that she is acting out her feelings and that she is being a teenager. It is especially hard for her because she was a spoiled kid before the mines.   Try and have some sympathy. How would you react if those closest to you threw you into hell and walked away?   I would survive, then again, one of my highest values is perseverance. I'm also not a teenage girl.   Tavore didn't even explain her actions to Felsin. Most women I know thrive on communication. Tavore never said, ""I have to do this, please understand, I love you, etc.""    This makes me dislike and pity both of them. Perhaps that's the term I should have used, I don't hate Felisin, I hate the situation, I hate her reactions. The way she's snide and snobbish and thinks that through her actions she has saved everyone (trying to justify them so she retains sanity).  Heboric calls Felisin toxic at one point in time while they are still on the Ototaral Island. I think that's an apt description. It's her way of protecting herself, but her armor is made of acid and she insists on rolling all over everyone.  Tl;DR I do pity Felisin. I also dislike her. Both have myriad reasons."
Malazan,31juym,spursbob,18,Sun Apr 5 20:08:33 2015 UTC,"Maybe try some sub-genres for a bit? Some historical fantasy? Neal Stephenson's The Baroque Cycle is a favorite of mine. It is meaty, funny, poignant, and definitely treats you as an adult.  Or some sci-fi/fantasy? Simmons's Hyperion Cantos features incredible world-building and characterization, and will blow you away with its sad beauty.  May not be 'classic fantasy' but it will definitely transport you, just like SE does."
Malazan,31juym,Ganoes-Stabro_Paran,9,Sun Apr 5 21:03:59 2015 UTC,"Absolutely would second the suggestion of Hyperion Cantos - it's a really rich mythos. Not quite as staggering as MBotF, but, well, you're doomed. ;)"
Malazan,31juym,Tumblehawk,5,Sun Apr 5 22:19:08 2015 UTC,"Anything by Neal Stephenson, as you have already proven yourself to have a keen intellect and impeccable taste in literature."
Malazan,31juym,baconforged,14,Mon Apr 6 01:40:14 2015 UTC,"You should read the Black Company because it came before, and clearly is an inspiration for Steven. It is by Glenn Cook, and it will make the malazan withdrawal much easier to cope with. Imo, The Black Company is the closest you'll get to a new first reread of anything Malazan-like, if that makes sense. Apart from the works of Esslemont and the new trilogy ofc."
Malazan,31juym,Silmariel,4,Sun Apr 5 23:24:56 2015 UTC,Love me some Lady and Croaker.

Malazan,31juym,drae-,1 point,Mon Apr 6 12:30:34 2015 UTC,"I'm halfway through BH, and just re-reading the prologue of GotM has made me realise how much I must have missed the first time through. Can't wait to go through again after I finish the series!"
Malazan,31juym,JimmyTMalice,10,Wed Apr 8 09:16:48 2015 UTC,"I read Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun after finishing the main series and it didn't let me down-- I had the same pleasure of ""connecting the dots"" between different people and events in Book of the New Sun as I experienced while reading Malazan. Plus, it has the added bonus of being a completed series, which makes me feel better about recommending it."
Malazan,31juym,banjaloupe,1 point,Sun Apr 5 21:48:52 2015 UTC,Such an amazing series. Good recommendation!
Malazan,31juym,TriscuitCracker,8,Sun Apr 5 23:29:25 2015 UTC,"For me, back. I took a break, then I went back and read the series again.  And then again.  Then I read Forge of Darkness.  Then I skipped around in the main series again.  Then Forge of Darkness again.  Then read the Esselmont books.  And now back to Forge of Darkness.  Actually, saying all that.... I think I have a problem.  Lol."
Malazan,31juym,PhilosopherIshamael,2,Sun Apr 5 20:55:52 2015 UTC,Because Forge of Darkness is so good?
Malazan,31juym,no_social_skills,6,Sun Apr 5 21:20:08 2015 UTC,If you haven't read The Black Company that's your next goal. Or you may check out Prince of nothing
Malazan,31juym,PadOfStone,5,Sun Apr 5 21:44:59 2015 UTC,"A few fantasy books that I enjoyed after Malazan include:  Demon Cycle - Peter V Brett I honestly thought the premise sounded corny, but it's a very good story so far. The 4th of the 5 books just came out, and I'm still very early in it. Humanity is in a war against demons and on the verge of extinction. It makes for an interesting world.   Stormlight Archive - Brandon Sanderson I'm a pretty big Sanderson fan. It has the first two books out, and is also expected to be 10 books long. I very much enjoy it. If you are looking for something that is already completed try the Mistborn Trilogy by Sanderson. (Or anything else by him)  The First Law - Joe Abercrombie A nice trilogy. I enjoyed it. While Malazan was an adult series that was also gritty I feel that this tries to be an adult series, and succeeds on many fronts, but at other times forgets it and is just gritty instead. I feel that the previous sentence did a terrible job of explaining how I feel, but I have no better way to describe it. (I'm a reader, not a writer, lol). That said, it was still enjoyable, and has me eyeing other books by Abercrombie, but I haven't gotten to them yet.   Chronicles of the Unhewn Throne - Brian Staveley Two books out so far. No idea how long it's supposed to be. Story is a pretty basic start. Emperor is killed, and his three children, spread across the world, all react to it in their own ways. It's got some action and some political intrigue. Each book ends and leaves you craving more.   A Raven's Shadow - Anthony Ryan Story of one guy with an amazing skill in battle as a fighter and a leader. From his training, through the battles he's fought and into his current situation. The first two books of the trilogy are out with the third due out in July of this year. The first two books often had me reading as fast as I could as I was pretty captivated.   Gentleman Bastards - Scott Lynch A funny story about a thief that is 'richer and cleverer than everyone else', and finds himself stuck knee deep in a heap of shit in each book. It's actually rather funny, as the humor seems natural rather than forced. Regardless of that fact, the story is quite interesting and I'd can't wait for the next book.    And I'll throw in A Song of Ice and Fire and also Wheel of Time, though they don't really need much of an intro.  I'm also looking to get into The Belgariad and The Malloreon by David Eddings. The Goblin Emperor by Katherine Addison and Riyria Revelations by Michael J. Sullivan are also on my to-read list.  Also, Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson. I know I already said it. But it's good enough to warrant mentioning twice."
Malazan,31juym,scaryghosts,2,Sun Apr 5 23:13:46 2015 UTC,"I fully understand what you wrote about The First Law. Although I've only read the first one of the three I kind of felt the same, but I definitely thought it was entertaining. Malazan is my favorite fantasy series I've touched (currently on MOI). I'm kind of new to the genre so I'm trying to read some more noteworthy books, both contemporary and historical to fantasy. I'm having a hard time though because I keep wondering what will happen in Malazan."
Malazan,31juym,scaryghosts,1 point,Mon Apr 6 00:02:06 2015 UTC,"I know exactly what you mean. Generally when I read a long series I like to alternate books. For example, when I read Wheel of Time I read WoT1, then Mistborn1, WoT2, Mistborn2, etc. (It keeps me from getting burned out on a specific series. Otherwise I start to hate it for no good reason.)  Malazan was different. I finished GotM and had to know what happened next. Before I knew it I had powered through 10 books way too fast. Maybe it's the changing of location from book to book, or maybe it's just how kick ass the series is, but I never felt like I could even consider starting another book during that time."
Malazan,31juym,sodapopSMASH,1 point,Mon Apr 6 00:12:14 2015 UTC,"I've been a little reluctant to start any of Sanderson's stuff as it seems a bit too ""Young Adult"" for my taste. What do you think?"
Malazan,31juym,drae-,2,Mon Apr 6 01:42:33 2015 UTC,"I would go for it. Mistborn is amazing. He does have a series started that is advertised as YA and I didn't enjoy that nearly as much.  But mistborn is pretty incredible imo, and stormlight archives has started strongly"
Malazan,31juym,pruzzante,2,Mon Apr 6 06:08:04 2015 UTC,"I haven't read Way of Kings, but I found Mistborn to be kinda YA."
Malazan,31juym,MoranthMunitions,1 point,Mon Apr 6 12:29:07 2015 UTC,"I would give Way of Kings a shot anyway. I read Way of Kings and Words of Radiance before reading through Mistborn and in my opinion the Stormlight Archive is (so far) a significant notch above Mistborn in quality. It has less of a love story (although there are a couple of romantic plotlines) and more military storytelling. He also has another lovely, well-developed magic system."
Malazan,31juym,androgymouse,1 point,Sat Apr 11 22:55:36 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed all of those that I've read, and the skull throne was pretty good, I liked it more than the daylight war. Finished it yesterday."
Malazan,31juym,NickofSantaCruz,3,Mon Apr 6 05:00:20 2015 UTC,"Instead of jumping on ICE, I went to Sanderson. He's not nearly as good or as interesting a writer compared to Erikson, but he is a very tight world builder who is innovative but simple. It's actually quite refreshing, as it's easy to be immersed in his fun worlds, but everything is just less... dense. Kind of like drinking a Belgian white after months of straight IPAs."
Malazan,31juym,drae-,1 point,Sun Apr 5 20:56:05 2015 UTC,I second this recommendation.  The Stormlight Archive has a nicely-crafted world and interesting characters.
Malazan,31juym,androgymouse,1 point,Mon Apr 6 00:45:55 2015 UTC,ehh... I havent read the way of kings but I found mistborn to be a little... YA for my tastes.
Malazan,31juym,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Mon Apr 6 12:27:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, his target audience is much broader. I actually thought a few of passages regarding killings in Mistborn (at least the second one) were more descriptive than WoK, though not overly so. From a narrative perspective I can see how Mistborn on the whole would seem more YA. The one thing I wish is that he would be a tad more adult..."
Malazan,31juym,mashedpotatoshoes,3,Mon Apr 6 16:46:02 2015 UTC,"Read Esselmonts backstory books and then Forge of Darkness. Esselmont, while not as good as Erikson, will satisfy your Malazan fix with backstory on the Crimson Guard, Segulah, the Stormriders, Greymane, Assail, and lots of other subplots that were only alluded to in the main series. Forge of Darkness is answers and asks tons of questions about how it all began. Or you could read the Bauchelin and Korbal Broach novellas they are great evil fun.   Then do a re-read. Seriously, you miss so much the first time around that re-reading it may as well be an entirely new series!  It's great connecting dots you didn't connect the first time around.  As good as reading it for the first time in its own way.  Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson, Prince of Nothing by R. Scott Bakker, Black Company by Glen Cook, or Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe may scratch your epic high adult fantasy itch."
Malazan,31juym,Turin_The_Mormegil,3,Sun Apr 5 21:13:56 2015 UTC,"Another vote for the Black Company. Just finished the fourth book and it just keeps getting better. Found the first two a bit slow but by the time I got my bearings, (who is who, where is where, etc.) Definitely sucked me in and I love his writing style. Actually the audio book I have is wicked, I don't usually like audio books but this narrator has the perfect voice."
Malazan,31juym,wehavedrunksoma,3,Mon Apr 6 00:18:42 2015 UTC,"I followed up Malazan with the Aeneid , then read Chronicles of the Black Company, to get a feel for one of Erikson's influences. Afterwards, I read Revelation Space for something entirely different. It's possible to go back to the rest of the fantasy genre post-Erikson, just that it might help to do something completely different after Malazan to cleanse the palate."
Malazan,31juym,RunsWithSporks,2,Mon Apr 6 01:04:11 2015 UTC,"Robin Hobb hasn't been mentioned yet. The world is much smaller (The Fitz Trilogy) but she takes a slow pace, still crams a lot in, and in particular the two trilogies from the point of view of Fitz are quite heartrenching and touching."
Malazan,31juym,NegativeChirality,2,Mon Apr 6 07:13:58 2015 UTC,A few series I have enjoyed.   The Black Company Bloodsounders Arc Thousand names (Shadow campaign) Stormlight
Malazan,31juym,Gyiir,2,Mon Apr 6 01:19:45 2015 UTC,I'm a huge fan of ' the second apocalypse' by R Scott Bakker
Malazan,31juym,bye_buffalo_bye,1 point,Mon Apr 6 05:05:42 2015 UTC,There's the books written by esslemont set directly after malazan.
Malazan,31juym,Gyiir,3,Sun Apr 5 20:44:34 2015 UTC,"Actually they are set during the malazan series, often continuing stories Erickson started."
Malazan,31juym,bye_buffalo_bye,1 point,Sun Apr 5 20:51:46 2015 UTC,Ah yeah you are correct. Well either way more malazan books!
Malazan,31juym,Sopp90,1 point,Sun Apr 5 20:59:24 2015 UTC,Also Erickson is writing a prequel trilogy. The first book is out and second hopefully comes out this year.
Malazan,31jtvs,Iliad_Keys,8,Sun Apr 5 19:59:56 2015 UTC,"You're probably thinking of when he was stabbed by Sorry. It would have been fatal, but Oponn intervened and saved him kind of early on in GotM. He also ends up drawn into the warren inside Dragnipur later on by touching the blood of a Hound that Rake killed. He is able to get out though cause he wasn't chained since he wasn't slain by Dragnipur."
Malazan,31jtvs,majiinbuu,1 point,Sun Apr 5 20:14:10 2015 UTC,That all makes sense and is immediately important given his first scene in MoI - thanks.
Malazan,31jtvs,Sopp90,1 point,Sun Apr 5 20:56:22 2015 UTC,Thinking back on when I first read GotM...  Damn that was a trippy experience.
Malazan,31936v,DragonAce,4,Thu Apr 2 23:46:30 2015 UTC,The entire Y'Ghatan sequence just about killed me. Good luck finding a better ~100 pages of writing anywhere.   <3 Gesler
Malazan,31936v,drunkmilkshake,2,Fri Apr 3 20:48:03 2015 UTC,I was in awe of Truth and what he did. And also was shocked to find that Stormy was a destriant (Or was it Gesler)
Malazan,31936v,drunkmilkshake,3,Fri Apr 3 20:55:49 2015 UTC,"I think Stormy was Shield Anvil(could be wrong, read it last year). Those three - Gesler, Stormy and Truth - are such god damn good characters. I'd say they're my favorites, but then, there's this thing about Malazan where just about every character becomes my favorite when they're being showcased. I can't think of a series where I've just loved every character I come across...   GoTM it's like, ""Yup, Anomander is my man."" DG comes and I've got Coltaine fever. MoI is Whiskeyjack and Itkovian. Karsa, Trull, Tehol, the list goes on. Even incredibly minor characters like Moroch ""I will cut him to pieces."" Naveth leave lasting impressions and bring a sense of incredible complexity to the world."
Malazan,31936v,JimmyTMalice,5,Fri Apr 3 21:21:03 2015 UTC,"They definitely do. Now Paran is becoming a top contender for the spot of favorite character(s) since there are too many awesome ones to choose. I like how Paran isn't instantly ""good"" at using his newfound powers and how he keeps messing up, it adds a sense of realism. Also, Icarium is such a tragic character that it makes me unbelievably sad when Taralack kept egging him on to destroying compared to how Mappo tried to spare Icarium the truth."
Malazan,31936v,xHiKaene3zYnhavzaUqV,2,Fri Apr 3 21:23:21 2015 UTC,The part where Icarium woke up and found Taralack waiting for him instead of Mappo was really unsettling. It's so sad that he forgot his friend just like that. (I've got about a hundred pages left in BH so I don't know if anything else happens with them)
Malazan,31936v,Silcha,2,Sun Apr 12 18:23:40 2015 UTC,Icarium is just heartbreaking
Malazan,31936v,xHiKaene3zYnhavzaUqV,2,Sun Apr 12 18:52:28 2015 UTC,"reading tunnels of y'ghatan is also rather clautrophobic, yes? i love it."
Malazan,31936v,TriscuitCracker,3,Sat Apr 4 11:03:11 2015 UTC,"The Bonehunters are indeed legendary. Also, you will love the ending of TtH, it is pure awesome."
Malazan,31936v,Seattlelite84,3,Fri Apr 3 00:06:56 2015 UTC,but first! here's a word from reapers' gale.
Malazan,31936v,Photosynthesis,2,Sat Apr 4 11:05:05 2015 UTC,Glad you enjoyed it! Bonehunters is one of my favorites.  Now back to Daujestan!r  What did you think of Y'ghtan?  EDIT: Back to Letherii. I'm an idiot.
Malazan,31936v,SchizoStarcraft,2,Fri Apr 3 00:01:06 2015 UTC,"I was in shock! I knew Y'Ghtan thirsted for Malazan blood but that was intense, and I was shocked that Leoman managed to pull that off and even more shocked to find out that Whiskeyjack's sister was his lover/companion and that she was sanctified to/by Hood. It was cool to see Corabb accept Fiddler and save him and I love Paran and how inexperienced he is with being Master of the Deck and all his powers though he tries his best. I'm waiting to see what is up with Pust's mule and when Tehol is going to ruin society in book 7. All in all, I'm in for a hell of a ride and I'm loving every book more and more!"
Malazan,31656c,IAMA_WARG_AMA,22,Thu Apr 2 08:00:26 2015 UTC,"I know you get a lot of posts from new readers, but everything about this sub and the series (both so far as I can tell from limited knowledge) is just so kind and compassionate, and I figured you wouldn't mind another gush of enthusiasm from a newbie.   There's warmth at the heart of these books, and it's beautiful and wrenching and powerful and so admirably different from so much of the narratives we tend to be fed, both in fiction and in the real-world simplification of humanity... Uff da. So tired; don't have the right words now, but I'm in this through the end."
Malazan,31656c,TisteSimeon,10,Thu Apr 2 08:11:22 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about seeing lots of new people posting here. Most of us love it!  I know that when someone such as yourself posts something like ""I just finished [BOOK] and..."" I always read them.  I guess I feel like I am reading them for the first time vicariously through you! I have read the whole series twice. Some of the books I have read 5 or 6 times... They just keep getting better but at the same time I am so jealous of people who are experiencing these things with fresh eyes!  Edit: spelling"
Malazan,31656c,TisteSimeon,5,Thu Apr 2 17:23:07 2015 UTC,"I'm absolutely adoring the discovery in reading something so new and fresh to me. I've been very diligent about avoiding spoilers (I posted this here simply because I knew the subreddit exists, but I'm not going to sub until I finish the books), and apart from a tidbit about a certain set of creatures (which doesn't have the feel of something that will be a stunning revelation, but we will see), I've been able to keep it clean so far.  ...but man, something else I have been loving about these books is how well Erikson paces the rate of revelation. He doesn't seem to lean on cliffhangers at all, and generally things get a great explanation mere pages after I've figured them out myself. It's a kind of trust in the reader's ability to follow that is rare, rare rare. And there are always new wrinkles! An expansion on the discoveries, hints that aren't treated as a source of superiority. He knows his world, and he knows when he wants you to understand, and what. So good."
Malazan,31656c,TisteSimeon,2,Thu Apr 2 20:08:39 2015 UTC,"Haha I love the enthusiasm! It's interesting that you say he doesn't leave the reader hanging too much because I feel there are aspects of it that don't get answered for a few books! You are right in saying he doesn't treat the reader like an idiot. There aren't any obvious info dumps or characters stood around discussing major plot points for the readers benefit.   But yeah he knows his world. Like, scarily well. I have been fortunate enough to meet him a few times, and one of those times was at a forum organised BBQ just after Toll the Hounds came out. Sitting on a couch with him and grilling (no BBQ related pun intended!) him over random & obscure references etc, he had answers to anything I could think of!"
Malazan,31656c,somedude2012,1 point,Fri Apr 3 04:42:04 2015 UTC,"I believe that 100%! And yeah, there are definitely a whole bunch of things that I don't understand yet - but nothing has the feel of being hidden simply to be hidden. I have yet to feel cheated out of a crucial piece of information: none of the ""by the way, he had a horn and blue skin and wings for the last five books"" kind of stuff.  I think that the bit explaining the DEADHOUSE GATES Spoiler felt about as info-dumpy as anything I've read so far, but it still managed not to feel intrusive. It felt like a deliberate choice to explain things in a more abstract third person because having a character describe all of that would have been very out of place, and it works just fine."
Malazan,31656c,DrinkyDrank,1 point,Sat Apr 4 04:16:18 2015 UTC,Yeah they do appear to be a bit of a deus ex machina. At first. That's all I'll say about them ;-)
Malazan,31656c,Georgraphy,6,Sat Apr 4 08:39:01 2015 UTC,"Not to knock GRRM, but your second paragraph is why I can read the MBotF on a regular basis, and can't stand to read tSoIaF.   If you're not feeling anything by when you're reading Erikson's writing, you're doing it wrong."
Malazan,31656c,Ganoes-Stabro_Paran,5,Thu Apr 2 16:53:20 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on that. I have a lot of love for ASOIAF (heck, about half my comment karma is from /r/asoiaf), but I gave up on my last attempt at a reread about a third of the way through A Storm of Swords. Where I am in life right now, I just can't handle that kind of unremitting bleakness.  Kindness in ASOIAF is appreciated when it happens, but is almost always followed by something horrific. Sharing a cave with a stranger and not being murdered is the sort of thing I think of when trying to come up with moments of warmth in that series...  ...but one of the things I'm loving about Malazan is how the scale of the fantasy makes both incredible horror and incredible compassion possible. I didn't mark this for any spoilers, so I'll be vague, but the level of forgiveness and redemption I've seen so far in this series are just wonderful. I get genuine catharsis in the most classical sense with every denouement. So good, so good."
Malazan,31656c,Georgraphy,3,Thu Apr 2 20:03:16 2015 UTC,"So true!  I have been completely engrossed in Malazan for the past few months, my mind had not wandered even once over to the GoT universe, despite all the hype with the upcoming season and the book that is still in the works.  Thinking back on the whole series, I've realized that GRRM is all about convoluted plot and shocker plot twists, without even half of the depth that Erikson is capable of."
Malazan,31656c,Ganoes-Stabro_Paran,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:17:19 2015 UTC,Hear Hear!
Malazan,31656c,titanemesis,11,Thu Apr 2 20:13:12 2015 UTC,Sad to say you may be doomed in the latter half of the series. A few of the middle books are generally considered a bit slow in the beginning of them as they build up the story. It is tolerable though because you can feel why it will be important later and then BOOM. CANNOT STOP READING MUST FINISH 600 PAGES IN ONE SITTING!
Malazan,31656c,titanemesis,7,Thu Apr 2 12:14:38 2015 UTC,"Haha, I believe it. I have been having big problems with focusing and reading for quite some time now, but each successive book has taken me less time. GotM took over two months of fits and starts, DG was just under a month, and MOI took me ten days. On top of how good the series is, I really have to thank Erikson for giving me back the joy of reading long-form fiction. It has been so long since I've been able to focus this well, and that has been a very deep sadness, as someone who grew up with a book under my nose at all opportunities."
Malazan,31656c,compiling,3,Thu Apr 2 14:24:04 2015 UTC,"No lie. I holed up over a holiday weekend when I got my copy of The Crippled God, because I knew that bastard SE was going to falcon punch my soul.   Three days later I emerged, red-eyed, triumphant, and utterly sad because I was done."
Malazan,31656c,threewordusername,2,Thu Apr 2 21:06:03 2015 UTC,Have you picked up any of the ICE books or FoD? My soul is still recovering even though I finished TCG probably a month ago.

One fun thing about the ICE books is that you can honestly see Esselmont become a better writer as he progresses. It's not like he starts out badly, just he's not SE, but his prose style markedly improves as he matures."
Malazan,31656c,Montaron87,9,Fri Apr 3 21:47:48 2015 UTC,"The other folks here are right: abandon hope all ye who make it past the half-way mark in Erikson's books. Things take a while to build, but when they do finally hit critical mass, everything goes 0-YOLO so fast it'll make your nose bleed."

Malazan,315l7a,AllWrong74,-1,Thu Apr 2 06:35:42 2015 UTC,"When the Jews roamed the desert for 40 years, it was called The Diaspora.  I'm assuming Erikson named this event after that.  There's another group from Esselmont's novels that's in a Diaspora, as well.  Same deal."
Malazan,315l7a,anointed9,11,Thu Apr 2 05:31:14 2015 UTC,"Thus is not correct. That's the exodus. Diaspora is after the destruction of the state of Israel in 70 ad, and the almost 2000 subsequent years without a nation of their own"

Malazan,315l7a,quadtard,-1,Thu Apr 2 08:54:07 2015 UTC,Not correct.  The diaspora does not refer to the destruction of Isreal but it is the following dispersion of jews to all parts of the Roman Empire.   The spreading of a people from their original home is a diaspora.  The result of dispersion.  That is why it is an apt word for the tlan imass

Haag had no inflection and sound monotone. He also would pause where there shouldn't be pauses and power thru when he should pause. All in all Page isn't terrible.

I accidentally bought HoC, MT, BH, and RG as audiobooks thinking that Lister was going to be the narrator. I thought that once I got over the abrasive and jarring change it would be fine and that was simply not the case. Brilliance Audio really dropped the ball here and should have had a warning for purchasers since that is there business. I don't think Page even learned about the characters that existed before he started. I wrote to them to complain and I got an insulting insincere reply. I went to the physical books to finish the series so it will take a bit longer. I had them anyway for reference so the only real loss was the purchase of the audiobooks after MoI."

EDIT: How could I forget Beak...sheesh.   Bear in mind, Toll the Hounds slows things down a bit at first, but you're back in Darujihstan! And the craziness is just beginning, Kruppe has a magnificent tale to tell you, and the ending is even better than Reapers Gale, in my opinion.

But everything in MBotF comes at a price. I'm consistently amazed at how quickly SE can make me care about a character, then make me cry like a bitch in the span of a few sentences. I'm a junky now.

The series really doesn't look back. TtH starts slow, yes, but the ambiance, the quality of the writing, and the return of a number of much-missed characters (and some new faces) more than makes up for that.  And the closing duology... in a world where fantasists keep their series going for decades, and sometimes even die before completing them, Erikson not only completed his series, but did so in such a satisfying and grand manner that he set a standard that I, personally, think is impossible to beat."

The ending is one of the best in any Malazan book.  Kallor is also, Spoiler   I believe Rake deliberately made that move because he had too. Although you could make the argument that why didn't he just commit suicide in the privacy of Black Coral. Still a badass fight scene though. Hairs on the back of my neck the entire time.   With Kalam, do you mean Minala? The one who he saved the children with?   Daseem/Dessembrae has it's own cult, like lots of the gods. I don't think there's any connection to Dessimbelackis except the ""First"" part of their respective titles,"
Malazan,30ylgh,TriscuitCracker,6,Tue Mar 31 20:38:43 2015 UTC,"Although you could make the argument that why didn't he just commit suicide in the privacy of Black Coral.   Rake wanted to go into the sword's warren to free Mother Dark, but he needed to be sure that Dragnipur didn't fall into the wrong hands.  In fact, the reason that Kallor was in the area was to attempt to claim the sword (he was obviously delayed long enough by Spinnock to prevent that from happening).  Rake knew that Daseem wouldn't claim the sword for himself, and would allow it to get to Brood so it could be destroyed."
Malazan,30ylgh,Tulkaas,2,Tue Mar 31 20:53:47 2015 UTC,Also the whole reason for the hounds being there was to ensure that the sword was handed over smoothly (lol talk about using a sledgehammer to crack a nut)

Malazan,30ylgh,Dwolf63,4,Wed Apr 1 07:52:49 2015 UTC,"The reason why Rake didn't just ""kill himself"" is because he had to kill Hood first.   Hood had to manifest in Darujhistan because that's where that little altar to him was built, and all those people fingerless man killed was a way of gathering energy to summon Hood's corporeal form.  The problem is that Dassem showed up just after Rake killed Hood and  he had taken on all the weight and energy of the kingdom of the dead into the sword's warren. There wasn't exactly enough time to run away.  So he improvised. Had he tried at that point to fall on his own sword, Dassem might just have been able to disarm him and defeat his purpose and his timing. So he ""goaded"" Dassem into a fight and manouvered him into delivering the perfect killing blow."
Malazan,30ylgh,morroIan,3,Wed Apr 1 01:55:16 2015 UTC,"My experience reading it was very similar to yours, the 1st 60-70% of the book or so was sooo slow but after that it went by very fast.

Malazan,30ylgh,Aiolus,2,Tue Mar 31 22:11:42 2015 UTC,Rake forced dassem to kill him pretty much. Karsa has some perspective on the wrongness of the fight.   Not sure about this.   Dessembrea is the God of tragedy. Not sure how much we know about that in tth but let's just say Dessembrea (the station) is older than dassem. The name similarity is weird.
Malazan,30ylgh,docforlife,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:09:16 2015 UTC,Dessembre and Dassem are the same person.  Dassem ascended.  But he somehow separated himself from his godly persona.
Malazan,30ylgh,SageOfTheWise,2,Wed Apr 1 02:46:26 2015 UTC,"I didn't really get how Dassem killed Rake. Somehow Rake's own sword ended up in his forehead, how did it happen ?    Rake lost on purpose.   Where is the chick that was part of Kalam's storyline back in like DG in Malaz City. Is she the women who is like living with Stonny or something ? I have no clue.   She's still protecting the first throne last you heard from her. She's not in this book.   Can someone explain me the whole Dessembrae cult ? I understand that Dessembrae is Dassem ascended. And Dassem's and the cult's name sounds strangely familiar to Dessimbelackis.    The reason Dessembrae and Dessimbelackis sound so familiar is because they are both from the same language (though I'm blanking on which...) and the Dessem/Dessim part means 'first' (ones the ruler of the self titled first empire, one is the first sword). The fact that Dassem and Dessembrae is so familiar ironically is as far as I know a coincidence (Unless Dassem Ultor is not his real name, and also was a play on the whole 'first' theme.) I'm not sure what there is to say about the Dessembrae cult though. I mean they're a cult that worship him. He rejects his godhood so he's not exactly interacting with them much (Similar to Anomander). The nature of Dassem and godhood is gone into a lot more in the last two books."

Mages are more connected with the general metaphysical structure, and are more likely to have this ""talent"".  Different mages have different levels of the talent, but priests and others can do readings as well. It is just something that Fiddler is good at, perhaps from so much magical exposure, perhaps related to his subtle magical 6th sense."

Malazan,30x9ef,PaxCecilia,6,Tue Mar 31 16:36:44 2015 UTC,"I think good with a sword is a bit of an understatement, since he's probably the best letheri swordsman living, or not as the case may now be, and he single-handedly defeated the emperor of the Tiste Edur, who's skill was under the influence of sorcerous augmentation, without sustaining so much as a scratch. I'd class that as being a bit of a powerhouse. And i think having the ability to crush an entire economy after a few weeks/months of work probably also constitutes that same label. Hull maybe less so, although i thought in terms of the series he might have had a bigger role to play than the one he did."
Malazan,30x9ef,ScottyBeans,6,Tue Mar 31 16:57:57 2015 UTC,The thing with Hull is that all of the impact he had was sort of before the books began. He's almost singlehandedly the reason the Letherii were able to expand so much over the years.

That being said in MT he is the only Edur who actually speaks out against Rhulad and all the bullshit that happens after they get the sword, he says what everyone else is thinking but is too scared to voice and he knows they hate him for it but he does it anyway.  He carried the burden of an entire people's doubts and self loathing with a kind of quiet dignity that reminds me of how Rake is for the Andii.

In early GotM, Quick Ben and Whiskeyjack very very obviously hint that Shadowthrone and Cotillion are Kellenvad/Dancer, Quick Ben knew who he was.   Also, I would doubt that Quick Ben has ever met or seen the emperor, and if he has it would've been at a distance. Quick Ben would not want to attract the attention of someone like Kellenvad."

Malazan,30vymq,Ezzelino,9,Tue Mar 31 04:07:40 2015 UTC,"Here's an explanation I did not too long ago about the Cult of Shadow and it's worship.   It's pretty simple, Shadow does not require a god to be a religion.  The distinction is made in the way people refer to the members of the Cult of Shadow. The Cult of Shadow does not worship who occupies the Throne, they worship the aspect itself. There have been many occupiers of the throne.  When people refer to the priests they say 'Priest of Shadow' or 'Servant of the Rope'. However with other religions, in the case of say Fener, they refer to the priests as 'Priest of Fener' instead of 'Priest of War' because war is worshiped through Fener, not the aspect  Shadows aspect is ever changing and it does not require a godhead to have a religion. When Shadowthrone talks about how when you leave the cult, the Rope will release you, he's not referring to the actual Rope killing you, rather a servant of the rope.  Hope this clears things up.   Also, to expand, the Cult of Shadow is not a single united cult, the Seven Cities denies that Kellenvad and Dancer are the Godheads, and instead of using Meanas, the lesser warren of shadow, they use Rashan, the lesser warren of Darkness."
Malazan,30vymq,FR05TB1T3,2,Tue Mar 31 04:21:15 2015 UTC,The deck of dragons is a relatively new invention in the context of the series and its characters. For example rake is at least 200 000 years old. Just for some context.

Malazan,30varv,majiinbuu,9,Tue Mar 31 01:20:52 2015 UTC,"The Talon organization continued after the disappearance of Dancer and Kellanved, going underground to avoid the Claw and eventually ending up attached to the nobility (of which House Paran was a part). Tavore never directly served the Emperor or Dancer, she was just inducted into the Talon and tried to uphold their legacy where she could.  You are correct that she is too young to have been serving at any point during Kellanved's reign."
Malazan,30varv,SageOfTheWise,4,Tue Mar 31 01:22:58 2015 UTC,"The Talon organization was very big on bloodlines. You passed on the role to your child (Remember Baudin). Tavore wasn't recruited by Kellanved or Dancer, she was brought into it by one of her parents (father I believe?). This is why in DoD or TCG when I think it was Brys asked Tavore what started all this she said it was when her family 'lost their oldest son' or something like that. IE: When Paran sort of left the family and went off to join the army, and then ended up working directly for The Adjunct of the Empress (biggest enemy of the Talon), the Talon legacy fell to Tavore instead."

Malazan,30uizs,Prof_J,14,Mon Mar 30 20:43:07 2015 UTC,He's not as old as Toc the Elder... ;-)   I think at the beginning of GOTM he is probably late twenties/early thirties. He has been around but isn't a grizzled veteran. He was claw before so he has never been a part of a squad (like the Bridgeburners or anything) and I don't think there is anywhere that describes him as too old.  At least that's how I always imagined him.
Malazan,30uizs,TisteSimeon,4,Mon Mar 30 21:31:10 2015 UTC,I've always envisioned him as a late twenties kind of guy. No mention whatsoever in the books that I can remember.
Malazan,30uizs,MisoRamenSoup,3,Mon Mar 30 22:16:07 2015 UTC,"I always put him in the mid-late 20s. He seems immature and naïve at times.   Ages are super weird in these books. In the opening of GOTM Paran describes a certain Malazan marine with a fiddle as appearing slightly older than him, but by DG said character is described as considerably older. Just go with what's in your head, I say."
Malazan,30uizs,future_forward,4,Mon Mar 30 22:16:09 2015 UTC,In one of the books it mentions that the bridgeburners and a few others were unusually resistant to the ravages of time. I think all of the bridge burners are actually quite a bit older than you think. I have a feeling that after everything he probably ages extremely quickly.
Malazan,30uizs,Fennrarr,1 point,Tue Mar 31 01:17:24 2015 UTC,"My thought exactly. I know the timeline gets really wonky around MT (I think?), but even with that in mind, it seems like the Bridgeburners formed up a good fifteen years previous by the time GotM starts. Granted, that's a top of my head estimate, but you get it."
Malazan,30uizs,Fennrarr,2,Tue Mar 31 04:46:50 2015 UTC,"I mean, it mentions several of the main characters had been traveling for literally years in some points of the book.

The scale of the book is a little boggling because the books actually occur at different points in time and eventually tie all the story lines together towards the end but until that point, every story exists in a slightly different time."

Malazan,30tbi9,thekevmaester,23,Mon Mar 30 15:20:52 2015 UTC,"There is much more information about the troubles in the heartland of the empire in Return of the Crimson Guard. Some of Laseens actions and motivations are resultant from this; but it is not explained in great detail in the bonehunters, with only a dialogue snippet here and there) Below is what you could surmise from reading up to bone hunters, but not RotCG.  Essentially, the empress tells Kalam that the events in seven cities (the chain of dogs, the rebellion) has left the empire unable to feed itself and in danger of economic collapse.    Laseen decides that the Wikan plains is the best place to cultivate agriculture to counter this problem. (I believe Mallick influences this decision, it's seems too advantageous for him) Of course the Wikans are plains people; they are not interested in agriculture and could be expected to defend their lands should the empire force the issue. The truth of the events surrounding the chain of dogs is twisted to make the Wikans appear treasonous, alleging that the slaughter of the Aren army committed by order of Coltain. Destruction of the Seventh is also laid at Coltains Feet.    This is done so that the general citizenry will rise against the Wikans and little must be done by the empires forces directly (as the empires armed forces are stretched to the point of breaking, the heart of the empire and seven cities are in disarray; not to mention the Korel and Genebacken campaigns aren't exactly going well). Once the Wikan Pogrom is complete, those lands will be cultivated to feed the empire.   Of course; to make the new history regarding the chain of dogs believable Laseen had to release Mallick Rel and Korbolo Dom, and revise the history regarding their actions in Seven Cities.   So when Tavore meets with Laseen, Korbolo and Mallick are in attendance, exalted despite their actions in Seven Cities. Laseen realizes that being forced to pardon and exalt Mallick and Korbolo has weakened her political position significantly. She is attempting to convey to Tavore and Kalam that she would prefer they stay and help her consolidate her power through her offer of clawmaster to Kalam and the significance of her facial expressions duiring her discussion with Tavore.  Kalam realises that Mallick has infiltrated the claw and that Tavore will be assassinated returning to her ship unless Kalam accompanies her. Kalam also realises that Tavore has something much bigger in mind then the empire, and that she must survive. If Kalam remains, and accepts Laseens offer, he could purge the claw of Mallick's influence and reassert Laseen's political power.   Kalam decides that Tavore > Empire and protects her while she returns to the ship. This leaves Laseens political position somewhat precarious as she is far less capable of purging the claw with the tools she's left. The Claw has always been her source of political strength; and is what allowed her to gain, and maintain power. Remember she has lost Topper to the Imperial Warren, and has had to rely on Pearl (who doesn't survive the night)."

Malazan,30tbi9,ARRedditUser,2,Tue Mar 31 16:47:46 2015 UTC,"I think there was a lot going on in this meeting and I may get some of it wrong. The Empress wanted Tavore to give up the Wickans that were in her ships to be slaughtered by the mobs. Going a layer deeper, the Empress is kind of being controlled by Mallick Rel and Korbolo Dom and no longer has control of the Claw so it wasn't really her decision. Basically Tavore has to make a decision to either obey the Empress and let the Wickans get slaughtered or save the Wickans and rebel against the Empress.    I believe Kalam is also offered the position of Clawmaster and he has to choose to either protect Tavor and T'Amber against an entire army of Claw and save the Wickans, or accept the position, let them die, and try to fix things with the Empress not being in control."
Malazan,30tbi9,future_forward,2,Mon Mar 30 16:14:58 2015 UTC,"Good notes, but worth underlining the fact that Rel and Dom have vested interests in seeing the Wickans annihilated – they know all about the Chain of Dogs.   It always read as a political motivation to me rather than an economical one as suggested in OP. Rel has Laseen's ear, he wants all Wickans dead, that becomes an imperial prerogative.

Malazan,30rqw6,TriscuitCracker,2,Mon Mar 30 04:14:14 2015 UTC,"Anomander seemed to have his own agenda which I never understood, except that he was opposed to the empire.  His sword was both cool and scary, a fate worse than death, which didn't seem to trouble him in the slightest.  I didn't really warm up to him, but I respected the fact that he preferred not to be worshipped.  And he's certainly a bad-ass.  Ganoes got his wish and also learned why his wish may have been unwise.  It made sense to link him to the gods of luck, because he survived, thrived, and developed some amazing powers through being at the right place at the right time -- although, again, he also paid the price and it didn't necessarily make him happy.  But he did have the courage to take advantage of his luck, and even to turn the tables and use the gods the way they had been using him.  Tattersail was a complicated character, her back story was a little sketchy, she was over 200 years old but I really only read about her recent history.  She was a strong female character but not much different from the male characters, a soldier-mage.  She was one of the few characters with a love life that's discussed.  There seems to be a close bond between her and Ganoes despite a relatively-brief acquaintance, a one-night stand, really, although they also nursed each other.  That trick she performed at her death to be reborn was interesting, I'm still not quite sure how her new receptacle was arranged so she didn't have to stay in a corpse.  There was something Providential there, as if Someone was looking out for her -- but who?  Nor do I understand why it happened in one of Kruppe's dreams -- but then I don't understand the nature of Kruppe's dreams.  They seem quite powerful."

I don't know if you'll ever really warm up to him, the way you do a lot of the Bridgeburners, but you'll understand why he is the way he is.  Ganoes is definitely a character with an interesting story. I think you'll enjoy his path through the series.  Tattersail gets a lot more explanation in the subsequent books. I really can't go into it without spoilers. And I'm really not sure Kruppe understands why his dreams are so powerful, but then again it's Kruppe so who the hell really knows.

Malazan,30rqw6,Jay_somestuff,3,Wed Apr 1 02:55:50 2015 UTC,"You're right about the gods, though you don't realize it.  They are both incredibly powerful, and incredibly vulnerable.  Think of them like the Norse gods.  They are super powerful, and they'll live forever unless they are killed.  They can be killed by a mortal, it just takes a really lucky or a really powerful mortal, or even better a really powerful and really lucky mortal to do the deed.  Your point about  hanging plotlines is because it's just the first book.  These books aren't self-contained.  Think of them like a history of the major happenings of the Malazan Empire over the course of about a decade."
Malazan,30rqw6,TisteSimeon,2,Mon Mar 30 06:52:47 2015 UTC,"Second- thats a solid interpretation and I would agree with a lot of it.   Third- I thought Erikson completely nailed grim soliders humor as well as just some circumstantial humor and fun characters. Kruppe is my favorite character.   Fourth- yep, I found this to be a breath of fresh air and it allowed Erikson to have so many povs.  Fifth- I read GotM and then the rest but I did do a reread and even though I liked GotM the reread made it one of my favorites. Theres a good chance Erikson could have written it a little more solidly (he wrote it 10 years or so before DG)  Sixth- it was so awesome for him to break the cycle of ~3 PoVs per book and one per chapter. It shows the contrast between competing factions and individuals. There is a lot of grey in these books.  Seventh- Eriksons gods are awesome. They frustrated my inherent idea of what a god should be but for the better. As for the gods keep reading :D  Eighth- this point comes up a lot. I disagree, I never thought Raest was beyond the powers that had converged to deal with him. I even recall Tool himself having some confidence about maybe fighting Raest (I could be wrong, it's when he is talking to Lorn and they're going to release Raest, Tool thinks he should be there just in case or something). I won't go on with this train of thought because I honestly mix up information from future books and wouldn't want to spoil anything. Also remember the Empire released Raest to fight Anomander hoping it would kill or wound him. As for the Azath I did a quick search and check out the poem at the start of chapter 24 which is written by Adaephon.  Enjoy the next book! I found it to be one of the more visceral and heart wrenching ones."
Malazan,30rqw6,sam1332,1 point,Mon Mar 30 05:16:47 2015 UTC,"Tool stuck around to observe but the impression I got was that he had strong reservations about the wisdom of releasing the tyrant but was bound to do so for some reason.  And yes, the hope was that Rake would have to fight Raest personally, weakening him, but that never happened.  The poem in chapter 24 is not foreshadowing, the Azath has already taken Raest."
Malazan,30r9bg,darkazoth,8,Mon Mar 30 00:57:08 2015 UTC,Something like the Dante's Inferno animated movie? It's even got the different animation styles for the different circles of hell
Malazan,30r9bg,DragonAce,2,Mon Mar 30 01:35:54 2015 UTC,Yeah ... or Animatrix
Malazan,30r9bg,DragonAce,2,Mon Mar 30 01:47:24 2015 UTC,Never seen Animatrix but I just looked it up and it looks really interesting
Malazan,30r9bg,SgtScream,3,Mon Mar 30 01:50:23 2015 UTC,Really worth a watch.
Malazan,30r9bg,cuprous_veins,2,Mon Mar 30 03:45:47 2015 UTC,"It is really, really good. It shouldn't be lumped in with Reloaded and Revolutions.  There are a couple of segments which are kind of ""meh"" in my opinion, but then there are a couple that are jaw-dropping.   Definitely watch it."
Malazan,30r9bg,JUL3,2,Mon Mar 30 04:29:25 2015 UTC,Just looked this up. So much yes. This style could definitely capture all Malazan's little quirks and frankly bizarre moments.
Malazan,30r9bg,ixosamaxi,5,Mon Mar 30 17:38:41 2015 UTC,"It could go great but could go horribly, same as any other medium you'd try."
Malazan,30r9bg,AllWrong74,4,Mon Mar 30 01:29:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we've had this discussion.  I'm always happy to have it again to make my thoughts known.  It needs to be done Seinen, not Shonen; for both tone and artwork style.  The company I would be happiest doing this is Ufotable.  Check out Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Bladeworks.  They have the most jaw-dropping sequences I've ever seen in animation."
Malazan,30r9bg,majiinbuu,3,Mon Mar 30 05:20:31 2015 UTC,"This scene from Fate/Zero gives me a bit of a Malazan vibe, the rest of the show not so much. It's spoilery if you ever intend to watch it. Also, not the best video quality, but at least there's subtitles in this one."
Malazan,30r9bg,OverJealousRapidToad,3,Mon Mar 30 02:10:56 2015 UTC,Also this scene were Iskandar first uses his noble phantasm (Spoilers from Fate/Zero).
Malazan,30r9bg,GokuTheKnight,3,Mon Mar 30 07:57:21 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. Live action would be so hard to cast and keep the cast together for so long, plus the effects would be out of this world crazy expensive. Anime could go on for really long, and really tell this huge, sprawling story visually.   It could be badass as hell, but the main adaptation problem they would run into is that the books sometimes take ~75% of a 1000 page novel to build to a sweet convergence. They could try to kinda fast forward some of the ""boring philosphical"" parts, but those sections are generally important to the character development and revealing motivations for actions.  It could be done, and I would enjoy the hell out of it but to do it well it would require a fuckton of work."
Malazan,30r9bg,Brys_Beddict,1 point,Mon Mar 30 03:33:34 2015 UTC,More than often I've noticed the POVs alternating between action sequences and tense character building narrative.  That might work in favor.
Malazan,30r9bg,mmSNAKE,2,Mon Mar 30 04:15:26 2015 UTC,Yeah other people has mentioned it. Personally I think it's too complex for any sort of translation to TV/Film. I just don't want to see it butchered.
Malazan,30r9bg,85pctofyouhavetogo,2,Mon Mar 30 15:09:39 2015 UTC,"Long running Seinen shows are like needles in a haystack. And this would have to be long running and Seinen to be great. As well as having a quality studio invest their time in it.  Highly unlikely since there are plenty of very high quality material in manga/light novels/visual novels that doesn't get a glance. But if by some chance it does get attention I would absolutely love it. Thinking on some of the duels animated by ufotable (like the ones in book 5 and book 8), that would give one the shivers."

Malazan,30r9bg,mmSNAKE,1 point,Mon Mar 30 04:40:38 2015 UTC,"Something I've noticed about Malazan fans whenever the subject of adaptation comes up..  Everyone seems to assume that the adaptation would 100% follow the books and include every single character and detail from the 10-book series.  An adaptation would probably drop a lot of stuff (Game of Thrones and LotR, for example) to make it work.  Chain of Dogs and the Phoenix Inn Regulars, both made into screenplays at some point, focused on narrow parts of the story.  I'm only on book 3, so I can't say where the story goes in the end, but I feel like some stuff would have to be ditched.  As an example, the 100000 years of history with the T'lan Imass and Jaghuts and K'Chain Che'malle could maybe be dropped, while still featuring them as just crumbly undead soldiers and blade-armed raptors.  A lot of the cool visual stuff could appear, just maybe not explained in such detail as in the books.  If MBotF were made into a trilogy of films (probably the max a studio would fund), what story beats and characters would make the cut?"
Malazan,30r9bg,WulftheRed,2,Mon Mar 30 07:36:45 2015 UTC,"While I think that what you are saying is somewhat true in general, I think that having only reached book 3 weakens your case a little bit. At this point, you are only just barely getting introduced to the central arc of the series, and even by the end it isn't exactly explicit yet.  This is highlighted by the fact that you don't realize that you can't just take the visual elements that you are seeing at face value and leave them at that. The Imass, Jaghut, and K'Chain are integral to the story and their history is tied into the current events in very important ways.  You can't just leave it as an unexplained mystery, the story just wouldn't work."
Malazan,30r9bg,Fnarley,0,Mon Mar 30 15:44:41 2015 UTC,"As an example, the 100000 years of history with the T'lan >Imass and Jaghuts and K'Chain Che'malle could maybe be dropped, while still featuring them as just crumbly undead soldiers and blade-armed raptors.   Except that conflict has great deal of importance on the overall plot. Far more about all three races is going to be explored in later books.  There are certainly events that can be cut out, or trimmed, characters that can be avoided. This example is not one of those.  Also to make the point, there are some 750 named characters or so in this series. I'd say at least 100-150 of them have significant relevance."
Malazan,30r9bg,Xardov,1 point,Tue Mar 31 01:24:20 2015 UTC,"Live action would be prohibitively expensive. Anime would be awful, people keep suggesting Fate/Zero as an example, but it's still far too cartoony for me. It's far too stylised and doesn't convey any real emotion to me.  If you were going to animate it, this is the way to do it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVf25eukR4o  The assassin in that scene is pretty much my image of Kalam (except for the colour of his skin obviously)."

Malazan,30r9bg,AllWrong74,2,Mon Mar 30 01:13:27 2015 UTC,I meant something in the lines of Akira
Malazan,30r9bg,DruidicHeretic,-12,Mon Mar 30 01:26:44 2015 UTC,Oh you meant this.  Nah it's still pretty horrible.  What's wrong with live action?

Malazan,30r9bg,mmSNAKE,4,Mon Mar 30 02:04:25 2015 UTC,"Live action can't portray magic in any acceptable form, especially feats of Elder Magic. Neither can you accurately depict races of differing physical attributes, like the Tiste.   And there are anime which have animation worthy of this series, surely."
Malazan,30r9bg,DruidicHeretic,1 point,Mon Mar 30 02:24:07 2015 UTC,"Check out Ufotable's ""Fate/Zero"" and ""Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Bladworks"".  ""Fate/Zero"" is available both subbed and dubbed on Netflix and subbed on Crunchyroll.  ""Unlimited Bladeworks"" is available subbed on Crunchyroll.  The animation is top-notch, and there are truly jaw-dropping sequences in both series."
Malazan,30r9bg,AllWrong74,1 point,Mon Mar 30 05:25:28 2015 UTC,"I have seen Fate/Zero(and it's sequel, the detested Fate/Stay Night) and can attest to its ridiculous amounts of awesomeness. Truly one of the best animated titles in the last few years. I have not yet seen Unlimited Bladeworks, however, but I'm looking forward to it."
Malazan,30r9bg,DruidicHeretic,1 point,Mon Mar 30 11:08:56 2015 UTC,I'm still trying to figure out the correlation between Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Bladeworks.  It appears the latter is the one on Crunchyroll (and I really liked it).  I've never actually run across the former.  Is it a series or a movie?
Malazan,30r9bg,PromisedPrince694,2,Mon Mar 30 12:05:03 2015 UTC,"Correlation? They are each a potential scenario in the original game. There were three of them: Fate/Stay Night, Unlimited Bladeworks and Heaven's Feel  Ufotable will be doing the film for the third scenario. They are all possible interpretations of that holy grail war. Look at it as alternate dimensions. Each scenario has a different focus and gives more insight into different characters.  I personally prefer UBW route the most.  Fate/Zero is the potential prequel to all three of them.  The original animated Fate/Stay Night was pretty poorly done (especially when comparing the later ufotable work)."
Malazan,30r9bg,AllWrong74,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:30:24 2015 UTC,"It's a series. Minor spoilers ahead. It's a sequel following the story of Emiya Shiro (that red-haired kid at the end of Fate/Zero) and Saber in a following War. It was made before Fate/Zero, and doesn't even come close to the level of quality of Zero, in animation or story or characters."
Malazan,30p7lh,Yallberforce,13,Sun Mar 29 14:09:38 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar situation as you, could not quite get into MT. I was just thinking ""ANOTHER NEW CONTINENT, STEVE?!"" I pushed through and I can say that the pay out for doing so was really fantastic. MT has one of the best convergences you've seen at that point in the series. Give it a chance! Also, Tehol and Bugg are fan favorites."
Malazan,30p7lh,yarikhh,7,Sun Mar 29 14:50:59 2015 UTC,Tehol and Bugg need their own spin off.
Malazan,30p7lh,lilpin13,10,Sun Mar 29 18:12:50 2015 UTC,"You're not alone in this. A lot of people, my self included, felt at first that Midnight Tides starts off as the worst book in the series. Midnight Tides takes place during the timelines of the first four books. At first I was like ""Not ANOTHER new continent!"" and ""Oh man, another zillion people to remember!"" But by the end it was one of my favorites. Trull and his family are amazing characters.  The Bedict brothers end up being some of the most beloved in the series.  And there are characters from the previous four books that do pop up in the subplots.  Often times events that you know about from the first four books are referenced from new characters point of view.   And in the next book Bonehunters (back to the Malazans) that's where all the plot lines from all the first five books start slowly coming together over the course of the rest of the books to Converge with a capital ""C"" in the Crippled God. As a whole, books 1-5 are setup.   I guess the question for you is, did you like the series as a whole up to this point to continue? I mean if it's been a slog fest this entire time and you haven't been enjoying it that's okay to stop, or take a break, no series is for anybody. But honesty if you've enjoyed it thus far and it's only Midnight Tides giving you grief, then I'd push on. You're at the midpoint of an amazing fantasy epic and you're going to see soon how it's all going to come together, what exactly Erikson has been building to all this time, and how all this epic weepy craziness is going to end.   And kudos for having made it this far! Malazan can take up a lot of time and energy as you said, it's not light reading, and you are to be commended for getting this far. I hope you continue! You can always post any questions and we'll try and keep it spoiler free if you don't understand something. Midnight Tides adds a lot to the already complicated mystery of the magic system/pantheon side of things.   Hope you keep reading!"
Malazan,30p7lh,TriscuitCracker,3,Sun Mar 29 14:59:04 2015 UTC,"Stick with it and power through the series, if you can handle these books you can handle anything."
Malazan,30p7lh,absolut696,2,Sun Mar 29 17:15:42 2015 UTC,Read it. I just started the crippled god this morning and this is the best series i have ever read. It is a lot to take in with so much continent hopping. Ive already committed to a re-read before i start the forge of darkness trilogy
Malazan,30p7lh,Ceej54,1 point,Sun Mar 29 17:58:17 2015 UTC,Don't forget to sprinkle Esselmont in between your re-read! And FoD is amazing.
Malazan,30p7lh,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Mon Mar 30 00:56:19 2015 UTC,Is esselmont as good? Ive heard mixed things. And does it tie into any of the main plots?
Malazan,30p7lh,Ceej54,2,Mon Mar 30 13:21:18 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, Esselmont is not as good as Erikson, but his 6 novels deal with lots and lots of backstory. There are lots of characters and plots alluded to in the background of the main series and Esselmonts fills in those blanks in the overall story.  Like the Crimson Guards story, Skinner, the Stormwall, Kellenvad and Cotillion, Mallick Rel, the Segulah, Assail, etc"
Malazan,30p7lh,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Mon Mar 30 16:18:44 2015 UTC,Awesome i cant wait to delve in. I was kind of morose just thinking im almost done with this series and i think this series puts the bar quite high in the fantasy world. I read.
Malazan,30p7lh,Ceej54,2,Tue Mar 31 00:47:55 2015 UTC,"Malazan Book of the Fallen is not structured like normal novels/series. It's an epic saga of an entire world, and you have to spend some time getting to know the different continents and their people. The payoff is that in the end you will have read a truly unique story, that has never really been done in this way. As mentioned elsewhere, books 1-5 are about bringing you up to speed on where this world is at, and 6-10 are about the convergence of everything going on.   Think of it like World War 2. If you want to truly understand everything about a conflict on a global scale, you have to take the time to understand what was happening in the major players leading up to the conflict. You would need to study what was going on in Europe, Asia, North America and the Middle East. You would need to see the line of conflict and power struggle that culminates in that event.   MBotF is truly epic on that scale. Every book is riddled with amazing stories and great characters, and you'd be surprised how often one of your favorite characters comes out of a storyline you didn't initially care for."
Malazan,30p7lh,MortalSword_MTG,1 point,Sun Mar 29 23:17:45 2015 UTC,"That's a good way to think of it, I'm stealing this WWII analogy for when I try to sell this series to people at the bookstore I work at, thanks!"

Malazan,30p7lh,MortalSword_MTG,2,Mon Mar 30 05:56:39 2015 UTC,"It's kind of like Gardens of the Moon where it can be harder to keep track of what's happening the first time because it's all unfamiliar, especially when you should have been familiar with most of the terminology and locations for the last two books. However it's also the last book in the series where you might feel out of your depth and completely worth reading.   Once you get 2/3 or 3/4 of the way through it will be better, just like with most of the others, but the start can be a bit trying. I wouldn't restart - you wouldn't get much of of it unless you didn't pay much attention the first time and you'll probably not want to read through it again having only a little more context."
Malazan,30p7lh,MoranthMunitions,2,Mon Mar 30 01:06:00 2015 UTC,"That's weird, I too just started Midnight Tides as a newbie, I'm about 120 pages in and loving it. Now that I've done Gardens of the Moon, and Deadhouse Gates (and even Book 1 of HoC) I feel like I know now how to warm to new characters and locales. It's fascinating to see how Erikson develops these distinct cultures. And besides, that Prologue was just about one of the most epic scenes ever.  I struggled HEAPS to get through Memories of Ice, it sat untouched on my desk for at least a month (though perhaps because I was still digesting the Chain of Dogs). But what saved it for me was the TOR Reread of the Fallen. They do chapter recaps after every one. So anytime I felt lost, not knowing what on earth was happening, or even reasonably confident I understood what was happening, I'd read that. It's a great safeguard for a series as complex as this I think."

Malazan,30ohk0,Karsa__,7,Sun Mar 29 06:48:52 2015 UTC,Recently finished my second read through and consciously tried to pay more attention to their 'overarching plan' that's apparently bubbling away throughout. As far as I can tell it's intended as a signal that Shadowthrone's power as a God is being stretched to its limit by the sheer number of simultaneous tasks he's trying to accomplish at once. I think Cotillion references this at one point when he's watching Pust talk to him (around book 6?) but don't have my kindle around to check the exact wording.   Cotillion himself has something similar when people start commenting on his exhaustion in the last two books (because apparently spending multiple years just hanging out with the bridge burners didn't leave him rested enough...)
Malazan,30ohk0,MrChug,2,Sun Mar 29 13:36:56 2015 UTC,"Ah so he protects those other thrones from Crip taking them over, but he doesn't sit on them?   He definitely still holds the power of both the First Throne and Shadow. But what of the throne on Drift Avali? Is that the elder seat of Shadow, which would be different than the younger throne Ammanas is sitting on.  He also doesn't seem like the kind of person to gather power and not use it. Rather, of he does sit on more than 2 thrones, he wouldn't be using their power to a full extent so that others forget he holds so much power.  Ex: controlling the First Throne but not summoning Logros into battle. Controlling throne of elder shadow but not demanding worship and action from the Tiste Edur as their master. Controlling the Malazan army very surreptitiously without coming out into the open to just say: do what I say. I'm your Emperor."
Malazan,30ohk0,CowDefenestrator,14,Sun Mar 29 14:34:36 2015 UTC,"He also doesn't seem like the kind of person to gather power and not use it.    Actually he's exactly the type of person to do so. House of Chains, chapter 20, Cutter to Apsalar:    ‘Aye, it's an Azath tactic, isn't it? Negation serves to disarm. Given the chance, he'd probably plant himself in every throne in sight, then, with all the power accrued to him, he would do nothing with it. Nothing at all.'  Her eyes slowly widened.  He frowned at her expression. Then his heart started pounding hard. No. I was only kidding. That's not just ambitious, it's insane. He could never pull it off… but what if he did? ‘All the games of the gods…'  ‘Would be seriously… curtailed. Crokus, have you stumbled onto the truth? Have you just articulated Shadowthrone's vast scheme? His prodigious gambit to achieve absolute domination?'   Sort of similar to what Tehol did with Lether's economy - sat on capital until there was nothing left circulating in the economy. Remember, one of the biggest themes in Malazan is mortals taking agency for themselves in a world filled with ascendants and gods that will happily toy with their fates for their own petty gains. One of Kellanved and Dancer's ultimate goals was to tip the scales just a bit more in favor of mortals, by upsetting the status quo of the indolent pantheon."
Malazan,30ohk0,CowDefenestrator,3,Sun Mar 29 17:22:06 2015 UTC,Its nice to get an actual well thought out answer to a thread mostly fueled by my own musings! I agree with you for sure. This is where my previous post leads...I'm interested in seeing the rest of the books written.  Would be cool to see of shadowthrone succeeds here
Malazan,30ohk0,Qster101,5,Sun Mar 29 18:42:29 2015 UTC,"You see him flitting in and out of events in ICE books, if you haven't read those.   I feel like actually seeing the details of Shadowthrone's machinations and the results would be kind of dull and ""too neat"" for the series. Going along with the ending poem,    We were never what people could be.  We were only what we were.  Remember us.   And I definitely think this applies to Shadowthrone as well. Those lines at the end of the series so perfectly capture that struggle to hold onto hope, to keep moving forward in a world torn by war and despair that is so prevalent throughout the series. And I think that's what Shadowthrone and Cotillion's efforts ultimately represent: hope, for the future, for humanity, for compassion. And they make us believe it by succeeding against all odds to free Kaminsod from his chains."
Malazan,30ohk0,MoranthMunitions,4,Sun Mar 29 19:40:44 2015 UTC,I thought I read that he didn't want to claim the throne on Drift Avali because it would bring unwanted attention to him and so left it open and tried to seem a minor player in the game.
Malazan,30ohk0,Landmarkmoon,2,Sun Mar 29 14:38:59 2015 UTC,"I think it was outright stated that any god claiming more than one throne/realm would quickly have all the rest trying to destroy them, as they'd be too much of a threat."

That's why the Wickan warlocks were having to resort to the old ways to get the Chain of Dogs across the continent.  However, the poisoning you're referring to is geographical to the Pannion Domin.  The closer to the Pannion you get, the worse the poisoning gets.  Seven Cities is on the other side of the world, so it's not affecting them at all."
Malazan,30mkmm,AllWrong74,1 point,Mon Mar 30 09:09:07 2015 UTC,Is that what caused all those bones in the Imperial Warren Kalam and co travelled through to Aren? Soletaken and D'ivers fighting ? Also do Soletaken fight other Soletaken and do D'ivers fight other D'ivers ? (Only started MoI today)
Malazan,30mkmm,Anomander__Rake,1 point,Mon Mar 30 20:33:16 2015 UTC,"No, the Imperial Warren is explained in the prologue (and clarified later on) in MoI.

Soletaken and/or d'ivers on ascendants or gods or mortals, etc.  EDIT:  I didn't answer the second question."

Malazan,30kbgw,AllWrong74,4,Sat Mar 28 12:30:43 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way,  but if your looking for clean vocals, during the Blind Guardian AMA someone suggested Malazan to them so you never know there might be more Malazan metal coming up soon."

Yes, the vocals are harsh and no, they're not ""bad vocals"".  They are quite good in terms of the genre.  For those of you who like them, do also check out Summoning, Elffor, Emyn Muil, Ered Wethrin (US), and Utstøtt.  Plenty of great bands playing this style nowadays."

Malazan,30ie4n,CaptainUnusual,4,Fri Mar 27 17:25:34 2015 UTC,"Well, when you parry, you just lightly nudge the weapon out if the way. Just a light tap. So it doesn't need to be that sturdy."
Malazan,30ie4n,Hoyasbrasil,7,Fri Mar 27 18:26:06 2015 UTC,"That might be true in fencing, but isn't always the case when fighting weapons meant to deal with armored foes or in larger combat situations.  Which is part of why Kalam sometimes has to worry about breaking his blades.  Also, you can't always parry, sometimes you have to block. Again, it isn't fencing, they aren't always going to be thrusting."
Malazan,30ie4n,Brys_Beddict,1 point,Fri Mar 27 19:30:07 2015 UTC,"I think so.. but mostly because of the skill of the user... I always imagine them being very fluid fighters..  parrying elegantly and not just trying to block a heavier weapon , etc"
Malazan,30ie4n,AllWrong74,6,Fri Mar 27 17:54:27 2015 UTC,I like to think of them as slightly curved knives about 2 feet long. Sort of like on the cover of Bonehunters.
Malazan,30ie4n,AllWrong74,2,Fri Mar 27 17:59:42 2015 UTC,!! I'd totally forgotten the cover of The Bonehunters.  This is indeed a good interpretation.  The 'not-quite-a-sword' nature of the weapons suits their described use well.

Malazan,30ie4n,Aiolus,5,Sat Mar 28 06:02:37 2015 UTC,"There are several descriptions in the books, the usual length given is over a foot, or maybe two feet, and they are always described as straight-bladed. There are other variants described as similar in weight and purpose as ""long knives"" that are curved (kethra blades, for instance) but the ones typically referred to as ""long knives"" are pretty similar to straight short swords. Crokus sees them as a good middle ground between carrying normal knives (useless against heavier weapons) and learning to use a sword (difficult and conspicuous).  They can be compared to short swords, have been used to block swords, and sometimes have been broken by human strength.  Here and there in the series you should be able to find pretty specific descriptions of their size and shape."
Malazan,30ie4n,AllWrong74,2,Fri Mar 27 19:33:36 2015 UTC,Brilliant summary - thank you for your input. I'm more of a longsword fencer myself - but I have been looking at diversifying into arming sword... your description makes long knife sound like an attractive alternative !
Malazan,30ie4n,Aiolus,2,Fri Mar 27 20:20:37 2015 UTC,"I missed the straight bladed part.  That settles it in my mind, then.  It's like a long Bowie Knife.  (I was conflicted between that and the Arabian Bowie Knife.)"
Malazan,30ie4n,AllWrong74,2,Sat Mar 28 06:03:46 2015 UTC,From Wikipedia     Long knife  Knives such as the seax and other blades of similar length - between 1 and 2 feet ( ˜ 30 cm and 60 cm) - are sometimes construed as “swords”. This is especially the case for weapons from antiquity that lack access to the technology for the high quality steel that is necessary for reliable swords of the length of a spatha or longer.

In addition, when the Chain of Dogs was getting to the forest, the Jaghut ghost that was haunting the Corporal (Duiker's assistant, I can't remember his name), the ghost showed the Corporal a vision of the Imass shattering the children's bones, and pinning them under rocks.  EDIT:  Found the quote   He stands guard still, that Jaghut ghost. The statement, a silent utterance that was both simple and obvious, nevertheless took the historian's breath away. How to comprehend this…    'How old?' Duiker's voice was as parched as the Odhan that awaited them.    'Five. The T'lan Imass chose this place for him. The effort of killing him would have proved too costly, given that the rest of the family still awaited them. So they dragged the child here - shattered his bones, every one, as many times as they could on so small a frame - then pinned him beneath this rock.'

Malazan,30di2p,tehpopulator,1 point,Thu Mar 26 20:43:18 2015 UTC,When did they talk about this?
Malazan,30di2p,PromisedPrince694,2,Tue Apr 7 13:48:04 2015 UTC,There's always a cool rock/paper/scissors bit going on in Malazan. I think the Malazans would have the best armies. Because fully equipped with munitions they're basically unstoppable in conventional warfare. Mages pretty much cancel each other out.
Malazan,30di2p,Circle-Breaker,2,Fri Mar 27 00:37:51 2015 UTC,"Circumstances dictate each battle. But a full strength Malazan army wins out for the fact alone that they are the most versatile, not to mention basically the main characters of the series."
Malazan,30di2p,Jsin14,1 point,Sat Mar 28 13:22:46 2015 UTC,"Is is malazan and not close.  Their alchemists will make munitions themselves once they use them enough.  Their spies and assassins weaken an enemy's leadership before they even fight. Yeah, vikings, zulu, and the 300 may beat the US national guard if both used swords and bows.  But they get destroyed if they face Marines with rocket launchers and the CIA, which is what the Malazan are.  Malazan beats any race, including eleint."
Malazan,30di2p,AllWrong74,1 point,Fri Mar 27 01:38:35 2015 UTC,including eleint   That's a bold statement.
Malazan,30di2p,Jsin14,2,Fri Mar 27 07:25:05 2015 UTC,"At first blush, maybe.  But eleint can't be effective in more than groups of 3, or else they will turn on each other in battle.  Plus, quick Ben and Hedge took 3 down in one setting.  Give cussers to a company of sappers and you might have a turkey shoot."
Malazan,30di2p,MoranthMunitions,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:35:30 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Silchas Ruin decided that cussers weren't for him, and I don't think that Sheltatha Lore came off too well with one either, though it was fired into the inside of her chest which probably helps cause avoiding scales.  I agree though, there's a lot of dragons out there, I think all of them together would trash all of the Malazan/Moranth coalition, especially as a large number of powerful Ascendants/gods could be considered Eleint."
Malazan,30di2p,Tarcanus,1 point,Fri Mar 27 11:31:03 2015 UTC,All of them together would cause an Eleint Storm and they'd all start fighting each other.  Malazans still win.

Malazan,30c7io,ocher_knight,12,Thu Mar 26 04:21:33 2015 UTC,Welcome. And be prepared for the feels.
Malazan,30c7io,mgallowglas,3,Thu Mar 26 04:33:08 2015 UTC,I'm definitely bracing for it. The world is so unapologetic and hostile that there's bound to be a lot of sad things to come.
Malazan,30c7io,CousinNoonga,3,Thu Mar 26 04:42:40 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't like comments like these, especially the ""make sure you have a box of tissues"" comment. I felt like it spoiled the ending of Deadhouse Gates for me. It's like, ""well yeah, something bad happens, thanks man."" Then about a quarter way through you figure out what will happen and who it will happen to. At least for me, the blow was softened because I was told to expect it."
Malazan,30c7io,mgallowglas,4,Thu Mar 26 07:33:24 2015 UTC,"I think you're reading more into my comment than I actually put into it because you're familiar with what happens. If someone reads through GOTM, and if they are halfway intelligent, I'm pretty sure they will clue into this is not a series of rainbows and roses. And, if that's not enough, the series is called, The Malazan Book of the Fallen."
Malazan,30c7io,CousinNoonga,1 point,Thu Mar 26 15:02:42 2015 UTC,"I understand that fully. It's not necessarily you're comment, a lot of people probably get too excited and are a little too specific. Being told a lot of the characters die in a huge ten book series, is vague enough to not be a spoiler. But to suggest something devastating is going to happen, at a certain point, in a certain book. I don't know, maybe it's just me."
Malazan,30c7io,Aiolus,6,Thu Mar 26 22:00:39 2015 UTC,"I also loved it. The series for me was a breath of fresh air. So many POVs.   Erikson as an anthropologist and a archeologist created a world with different people's, races and events which just felt real to me. The characters were also just awesome and inspired tons of emotion, from joy to sadness to rage.   Deadhouse Gates is a great book. Powerful!   Enjoy.   Edit: word"
Malazan,30c7io,Aiolus,2,Thu Mar 26 04:49:21 2015 UTC,"I agree wholeheartedly. Darujhistan was a marvel of worldbuilding that felt like a bustling metropolis steeped in history. As much as I miss it, I am loving Seven Cities so far."
Malazan,30c7io,EchoTruth,1 point,Thu Mar 26 04:58:29 2015 UTC,Changing the setting/characters always throws me. With Erikson I would pretty quickly love the new ones.   Seven Cities I pretty awesome. I'm sure you will also be hugely invested in the characters by the end.

Malazan,30c7io,Boru12,2,Thu Mar 26 04:57:43 2015 UTC,"I envy your first time experience!!! Word of warning, they change the narrator after book 3 who isn't as good as Lister but still excellent. Conveys the humor better but doesnt have the same emotional performance that Lister did, and some of his main characters are poor compared to Listers,  some are a lot better though."
Malazan,30c7io,Zweems,1 point,Thu Mar 26 09:13:10 2015 UTC,"I too started the series with the audiobook and then got the physical books for the maps (which I love series that have maps), dramatis personae, and the glossary. I would listen when I was working and read when I had time. A heads up on the audiobooks, Brilliance Audio made a very poor decision in changing the narrator after Memories of Ice. It is very abrasive so have a listen to the sample before committing to it. Some could get by it but I on the other hand could not, for now anyway. Still have the books though and am plugging away though not as fast now. I am just getting in to Bone Hunters and though there has been some very sad times in this journey I still love it."
Malazan,30c7io,tripod-pop,1 point,Thu Mar 26 15:18:55 2015 UTC,"Hey man, speaking of the audiobooks. Are there any good copies? The ralph lister ones are amazing but they don't go past MoI I believe. I think I did myself an injustice by starting with them, because the other one that I found can't compare, and I have so many more books to finish."
Malazan,30c7io,Zweems,1 point,Thu Mar 26 15:34:11 2015 UTC,"Page is a great voice actor, just give him some time. I thought he was less than awesome starting off, but now his is the voice I hear."

Not to mention the audio quality.   Edit: Maybe I don't have the Michael Page ones. Is there a version other than Page and Lister?  Edit again: Apparently I have the Haag ones and not the Page ones. Time to get to work before I'm done MoI!"
Malazan,30c7io,Boru12,1 point,Thu Mar 26 17:45:16 2015 UTC,"I didn't even know there was another actor... Thought it was just Page and Lister. I have listened to Lister, he is great."
Malazan,30c7io,wjbc,1 point,Thu Mar 26 19:33:57 2015 UTC,I have tried to find other audiobooks after MoI and have even complained to Brilliance Audio about how there was no background work done before switching narrators. I got a terrible almost disrespectful reply that looked all cut and past with different font styles within the same paragraph. It makes me feel like they are a poor production company. I believe Michael Page id a good narrator but not for this series at all. I rarely get time to sit down and read which is why I used audiobooks but now I have to read the physical books so it is going to take me much longer to get through the series than I had hoped. Sorry I couldn't be more help
Malazan,30c7io,AlmightyZael,1 point,Fri Mar 27 16:31:14 2015 UTC,"I finished GotM recently and immediately started reading it again because I knew there was a lot I didn't understand.  That's still true the second time around, but I'm also catching a lot of things I missed.  Someone said the first five books are really a set up, that's a hell of a set up!  But I'm getting pulled in for sure."
Malazan,30ax3w,DidNatziThat,2,Wed Mar 25 22:03:59 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, go for Stonewielder. It's a major step up over NoK or RotCG (neither of which really blew me away). I've just started the next ICE book after SW - Orb, Sceptre, Throne - I'm 10% in and my god it is really good.  I personally don't want to read FoD yet cause I don't want to wait for the other 2 in the trilogy! I'd rather binge all 3 at once. Maybe I'll change my mind though.  So glad you kept up with it!!"

Malazan,30ax3w,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Thu Mar 26 11:28:48 2015 UTC,"FoD is amazing AND written by Erikson and answers (and asks plenty more) alot of questions about Elders and the Titse and the Azath.   But you're two books through the Esselmont series, so I'd finish those. I wouldn't skip FoD before your first re-read of the main series though."
Malazan,30963x,sam1332,6,Wed Mar 25 14:22:12 2015 UTC,"GoTM is by no means a ""bad"" book but Erikson wrote it 9 years before the rest and it was his first novel and it shows a bit. Combined with his writing style that can be hard to get used too and his lack of infodumping means GoTM can be intimidating.  Glad you got through it!   Deadhouse Gates takes place on another continent after GoTM with mostly new characters but there are a few characters from GoTM that are there as well.  Erikson's writing definitely improves.  Just bear in mind he does not do infodumps much, as you read, you learn as the characters do about how various things work. (warrens, Ascendancy, histories of the races, etc)  It's like you're dropped into a foreign country with no knowlege and you have to figure things out as you go and put the pieces together. As you read the series you will have a zillion ""Oooooh"" and ""Ah HAH"" moments as you put things together.  Often events you've read of or experienced through characters are perceived differently from different characters in another book. Things start connecting over serveral books.  If you don't understand something, either ask us, we'll keep it spoiler free or tell you to READ ON.   It's a heck of a ride and also intimitdating as hell. The dramatis personae and the glossary in the back of the book are your best friends. Erikson is a master of the slow build, 3/4 of each book is plot, character building, introspective phiosophy, history, great action scenes here and there, and then once you're nearing the end, he turns it all up to and epic, weepy 11 in EVERY book, and the next thing you know you're reading it until 5 in the morning because you can't stop now.   The third book, Memories of Ice, goes back to Genebackis and the Malazans and most characters from GoTM return.  Then in Book 4, House of Chains, it's back to the setting of Deadhouse Gates, then in book 5, Midnight Tides, you go to an entirely new continent AGAIN, with all new characters.   Just to put it all in perspective, books 1-5 are, as a whole, setup. They are self contained stories, but building to a much, much bigger picture across the whole series, which is what makes Malazan so good as a whole. All the plotlines from all first five books start to slowly converge (a term you'll hear throughout the series) in Bonehunters to culminate in the 10th book, The Crippled God.   Welcome to the sub! Post your impressions as you go, positive or negative, we'll try and keep it spoiler free for you."
Malazan,30963x,TriscuitCracker,3,Wed Mar 25 16:02:09 2015 UTC,"I find this post helpful to get an impression of the general pacing, thank you. I myself am just beginning the fete section while the Jaghut battles 4 black and 1 red in the distance of Book 1.  I am hopeful and pleased by the numerous claims that every book after GotM is better, because so far I've been disappointed. Pleased yes, but it simply isn't meeting my expectations as lauded by fans. The complexity is... shallow, many of the characters are rather flat and the often-vaunted ""lack of hand holding"" often is a result of cheap tricks like cutting away from the scene before a detail is revealed,  opening on a scene right AFTER a detail is revealed, and simply leaving out description that the characters in the scene would get, but the readers don't.  It's creating artificial mystery and it's amateurish, in my opinion. When Rake's assassin is about to kill Crokus and co. atop the bell tower but a mysterious stranger intervenes and threatens the assassin....she makes it aware that she knows who the speaker is. Yet the voice isn't even described as male or female for the reader, something we SHOULD know but aren't told because that creates a sense of mystery where there wouldn't be. That's one example of the eye rolls this book has induced in me. if you want masterful ""no hand holding"" story, check out Tom Lloyd's 5 book series.  I experienced far more confusion in his first book 'The Stormcaller' and it was all for good reasons, never because of intentional obfuscation at the reader's expense. And I loved it. It remains the best series of fantasy I've read in my life, and I'm learning it shares similarities with Malazan, such as the active gods and super powered beings. So I'm hopeful that Malazan will improve to that level of quality with the next books.  All that said, I do like the book. I like most aspects of it in fact. I think my issue was I researched for so long and saw so many variations of ""Gardens of the Moon is tough for some to get into because if the complexity"" ""-because Erikson drops you in the middle of the story""  ""-because he doesn't hold the reader's hand with information"" that I just expected more. I found it stupid easy, widely predictable, and more like a novelization of a D&D campaign (which makes sense). I fully beleive at this point that I would have enjoyed it even more if I had gone into it without reading the hype. I find myself having to tell friends who, like me, have read what others said about the book being difficult and opted not to give it a try yet ""listen,  ignore all that, it's pretty basic of quality fantasy stories and you'll have no problem following along with what's going on."" Hell, Star Wars starts in the same way of dropping the viewer into the middle of an ongoing war. If your style is comparable to Lucas, it can't be that complex :P.  The idea that Book 1 was originally written as a screen play both explains alot of the issues I have and confirms the vibe I got while reading. I often found myself thinking that a scene would work on screen to good mysterious affect, but just seemed poorly written in print. So the fact that the 9 succeeding books are intended only as books boosts my optimism further!   TL; DR  I've been mostly negative in this post but it's only because I really do like the world and the potential for the epic story that is unfolding, the pantheons and races and cultures, the treachery and intrigue, what's going to happen to the Bridgeburners, to the Empress, to the neutrals caught in the middle. The story and world, I love. The way it was written, though, I knit pick because I find it too easy to and I find so many people seem to tow the hype-line.  Just because an author doesn't hold my hand doesn't excuse them from giving me the tools to find the path myself, and just because an author decides to be sparse with the tools doesn't make them a better writer (anyone else instantly think of that special T'lan Imass? :P). That's my bumper sticker summary."
Malazan,30963x,Fingerbone_,2,Wed Mar 25 19:28:36 2015 UTC,"I think that a very fair critique of GotM, and it is similar to my experience. Your examples of missing details and flat characters are spot-on. I felt a little underwhelmed once I completed the book. I am interested to hear your thoughts when you have completed."
Malazan,30963x,Xanian123,6,Wed Mar 25 20:37:28 2015 UTC,"I am reading the sixth book, The Bonehunters, and I agree that Gardens of the Moon is not the best of the series. But I saw somewhere that there was a large gap between the writing of the first book and the others in the series. GoTM is, so far, the book that was hardest to get into for me personally. It could also be that you get used to the writer's 'no spoon feeding' style of writing. But I do think that the reading gets easier from the second book onwards, along with a considerable improvement in writing style. But the presence of deus ex machina in the books is one thing that pretty much remains constant, and is kinda my only gripe with the series. Apart from that, the series, or the first 60% of it, has been one of the most incredible reading experiences in my life. The emotions, and the awe you feel while reading Steven Erikson cannot be matched IMO. But hey, that's me."
Malazan,30963x,titanemesis,2,Wed Mar 25 14:40:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your response. deus ex machina is exactly what I was referring to, but was unfamiliar with that term. I am looking forward to starting Deadhouse Gates."
Malazan,30963x,Montaron87,7,Wed Mar 25 20:31:47 2015 UTC,"Accusing Erikson of using Deus Ex Machina to solve his plot problems is somewhat unfair to him; by the conclusion of the series, most of them are well fleshed out and don't feel like cheap one-off rescue gimmicks. There actually IS an upper limit to how powerful characters can get, and how many magical whatsits they can fling around to get out of trouble.  No offense is meant to /u/Xanian123; at that point in the series, it is easy to see why many of the plot devices seem like Deus Ex Machina."
Malazan,30963x,titanemesis,3,Wed Mar 25 21:07:26 2015 UTC,"I agree, instead of placing Chekovs gun and then using it, Erikson basically shoots someone and then later you find out that those guns are the norm."

Malazan,30963x,half-idiot,5,Thu Mar 26 13:03:22 2015 UTC,"The series definitely improves. Drastically, even. Deadhouse Gates marks the beginning of one hell of a ride.   The writing style of no-hand-holding-ever continues, but once you get used to it, it's incredible. The sheer scale of the story will stagger you.  If you enjoyed GoTM at all, you can look forward to much more awesomeness, and much less idiosyncratic story quirks from the rest of the series.  Also, re: Rake - you ain't seen nothing yet. Hang on to your hounds."

Malazan,30963x,drae-,6,Thu Mar 26 13:07:56 2015 UTC,"Had it been standalone, it would have been a terrible deus ex machina.  However the thing with the series is that it wasn't written ad hoc - he mapped out the giant story arc and a supporting world and millennia of history in advance.  While right now it feels like you were blindsided by cheap get-outs, later on I guarantee your eyes will widen as you realise the context of those actions in hindsight."
Malazan,30963x,TriscuitCracker,3,Wed Mar 25 22:31:13 2015 UTC,"yeah GotM was written like 10 years before every other book, it's quite a bit weaker than the others."
Malazan,30963x,Brys_Beddict,7,Wed Mar 25 14:59:31 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, GotM was also originally conceived as a screen play. Allegedly opening with the rooftop chase.   This also helps explain some of the difficulty readers encounter, as I imagine when it was being originally conceived the intention was to have visual cues as well as the written ones.   Gardens of the Moon [the first novel in the series, which baffles many readers to the extent that they don’t continue with the rest] began life as a treatment for a film. How on earth did it work as a two-hour screenplay? Do you ever let people read the script?  We’d love to let people read the script, if only we had a copy. It’s gone the way of the dinosaurs… As a script, it started and ended in Darujhistan, opening with the assassins’ war on the rooftops and closing with the events at the fete. As I recall, there was no Jaghut Tyrant, but I might be wrong in that. And it played for laughs.   http://the-void.co.uk/book/interview-damn-contrarian-steven-erikson-conversation-094/"

My first reread of GotM, I was like, ""Hey, that's a Tiste Edur body!"" I mean, there are clues and foreshadowing everywhere in that series."
Malazan,30afm9,Silmariel,1 point,Fri Mar 27 15:01:13 2015 UTC,"Spoiler  Btw, had many of those types of moments where I noticed the connections between myths and stories and observations across many different characters, and them suddenly connecting. Awesome stuff. Probably what makes the series for me. Ive read them many times, and probably will till my eyes no longer let me :)"
Malazan,30afm9,Novamonk1,1 point,Fri Mar 27 21:36:11 2015 UTC,"Just started another re-read, and that Paran meets Topper, and that we see the Crimson Guard in action in GotM."

Malazan,307n51,MetaBotch,1 point,Wed Mar 25 13:49:39 2015 UTC,"They did by then, Corlo had been using Mockra specifically for a fair while before that event. I'm just not sure how either Landmarkmoon's comment is relevant though, and depending on what they meant it might not matter if Warrens were present or not. They operate in much the same way as Holds, though arguably the character he mentioned might not use magic the same way that other Hold users might.  On the subject of Mockra and the actual thread though, I don't see why they couldn't, at least if you're not mentally stable. Maybe it's like tickling yourself, which works if you're schizophrenic, but I don't see why so long as being self aware of doing magic on your own mind would make you immune to it that you couldn't. Like if you did something to yourself and you knew you did it, you might reflexively nullify it if possible. I reckon you'd just have to be super careful."

Malazan,3019zx,Tumblehawk,5,Mon Mar 23 17:54:06 2015 UTC,"Orb Sceptre Throne is even better IMO.  Loved the vision of the Stormwall.   Yes, Esselmont hasn't really mastered the climax like Erikson, but he does provide great backstory.   Have you read Forge of Darkness?"
Malazan,3019zx,TriscuitCracker,2,Mon Mar 23 18:20:03 2015 UTC,I'm considering waiting till the whole Kharkanas trilogy is finished before I read it. I don't relish the thought of waiting a long time between books and then feeling the need to reread before the third comes out. I'm going to finish out the ICE novels...and then I think I'm going to do my first re-read of the main MBotF.
Malazan,3019zx,TheHopelessGamer,5,Mon Mar 23 18:21:25 2015 UTC,"I'm on my first read through and finished SW a few weeks ago (and am almost done with DoD already - the book is going by so quickly!), and I agree with your points.   I'm going to finish tCG before going on to OST, but I can say that I'm genuinely looking forward to Cam's next book, which wasn't necessarily the case before finishing SW.   I will just add that I really liked the bits with Greymane's Malazan army and Kyle (which is probably the worst-named fantasy character of all time) as adjunct."
Malazan,3019zx,TheHopelessGamer,3,Mon Mar 23 19:11:10 2015 UTC,"Agreed! When I finished RotCG I was heartened to see people on here generally liked SW, but there was a sense of, ""Ok, let's get on with this,"" in picking it up. Now there's just straight-up excitement to dive into OST.  Man, enjoy tCG!!"
Malazan,3019zx,Silcha,2,Mon Mar 23 19:26:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'm so looking forward to it. I've dedicated the last year and a half to getting through all the books chronologically from both authors after reading the first two books years ago and getting discouraged by the prolog in MoI.  I consider myself a very slow reader, so the fact that I'm 3/4 of the way through DoD in a little less than two weeks I think shows just how tense and much of a buildup the story is reaching.   I'm both desperately pursuing and desperately dreading the last page of tCG. Not sure how I'm going to handle it, to be honest."
Malazan,3019zx,quadtard,4,Mon Mar 23 20:48:49 2015 UTC,The book Assail holds the answer to what he saw as the source of the avowed's power. You'll be in for a surprise when you read it.
Malazan,3019zx,Silcha,1 point,Mon Mar 23 19:47:04 2015 UTC,I feel like there is plenty of foreshadowing and hints to figure things out probably midway between B&B.  The further into Assail I got the more I knew I was right.

Malazan,3019zx,twistacles,2,Mon Mar 23 20:30:56 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't want to spoil too much in regard of ICEs endings - but wait till you get to Assail! ;)   (specifically formulated ambiguously to avoid spoiler!)"
Malazan,301eh4,TriscuitCracker,7,Mon Mar 23 18:25:28 2015 UTC,"He IS Quick Ben. Some of his souls on tje other hand....there is definetly some Andii in there. But no, you cannot count on Erikson ever giving you the answer."
Malazan,301eh4,DAMCARDLE,6,Mon Mar 23 21:42:57 2015 UTC,"All we really know regarding future origin reveals is that both Quick Ben and Ruthan Gudd are both in the Kharkanas trilogy,  but not in a form that we will recognise them according to Erikson. Which is both fantastically teasing and frustrating in equal measures..."
Malazan,301eh4,Montaron87,4,Tue Mar 24 11:55:29 2015 UTC,"I always get the idea that Ruthan Gudd is ""just an Azathanai""  And with that I mean that while the others all were/became gods, he just couldn't really be bothered and therefore he kept his head down and tried to lay low."
Malazan,301eh4,DAMCARDLE,1 point,Tue Mar 24 16:21:02 2015 UTC,He is referred to as Elder and defo has that vibe so I'm thinking he is an Azathanai too but which one!!!

Malazan,301eh4,dirksoccer,2,Tue Mar 24 16:28:58 2015 UTC,"Kind of random but that ""He cheats."" at the end brought to mind Fiddler's card games, where he just makes up the rules as he hoes along. Always loved those parts"
Malazan,3011qz,BlasterSarge,9,Mon Mar 23 16:55:16 2015 UTC,"I think at the time, the T'Lan Imass were bound to serve the Malazan Empire still.  He may have been ordered to help Lorn in this.  I may be wrong on this, others will correct me if I am.   I also think that Raest was not necessarily ""dead"" to Tool, he was just imprisoned. Therefore Tool was helping to release him in order to finally have a chance to end him. (probably knowing other powers would also come to help like Rake as he himself knew he didn't have the power to stop him)  EDIT: Also, bear in mind Erikson wrote this 9 years before DG, so not all the character motivations may be in place, sometimes there are small inconsistencies between GoTM and the rest of the series.   Tool will return, RAFO! Glad you're liking the series!"
Malazan,3011qz,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Mon Mar 23 17:47:06 2015 UTC,"I'm reading it a second time, and noticed Tool talked about being bound by oaths, or something like that.  And he was happy that after this task he would be free.  So it does not seem like he felt he had a choice, although whether this was a magical compulsion or just a sense of duty is still unclear to me."
Malazan,3011qz,wjbc,4,Fri Mar 27 19:20:13 2015 UTC,As far as I remember it was due to Tool thinking that if they are going to release the Tyrant its better to do it with him around than not? Little hazy on it but I don't think we get anymore info about it that isnt in GOTM or MOI
Malazan,3011qz,DAMCARDLE,4,Mon Mar 23 17:46:41 2015 UTC,"I think he freed him in order to destroy him, or see him destroyed.  Tool is quite the bad ass.  Although he expresses some doubts about the plan along the way, I think that's why he did it.  Sleep was not good enough for a Jaghut Tyrant, he wanted that sucker destroyed."
Malazan,3011qz,wjbc,1 point,Mon Mar 23 20:22:18 2015 UTC,"If you're going to play with fire, you want to have the fire department right there.    Tool figured it was going to happen anyway, so didn't object that much when he was ordered to help - he figured he'd get a chance to destroy the thing when it inevitably went haywire."
Malazan,3011qz,TheTiniestPirate,1 point,Mon Mar 23 23:00:42 2015 UTC,I'm still hazy as to why Laseen and Lorn wanted to release Raest in the first place.
Malazan,3011qz,MetaBotch,2,Wed Mar 25 13:42:17 2015 UTC,I read it some years ago but I think it was because Laseen wanted to lure Rake out to stop Raest. That way Rake would be weakened and a smaller threat.

However, all the new plot and continent are pretty key to the rest of the story. It all ties in together in later books , so don't worry :)"
Malazan,300cgi,Hoyasbrasil,1 point,Mon Mar 23 13:45:30 2015 UTC,"Hmm, he's one character I feel like I didn't really understand from HoC. I'm confused by the Tiste races, Tiste Andii (led by Anomander Rake) are the children of Mother Dark. And, as learned in HoC, the Tiste Liosan are the children of Father Light. And the two are at war with eachother? Is this correct? If so, then what are the Tiste Edur? Are they a mixed race of the two, or something else entirely? He mentioned a few times Shadow is the child of Light and Dark. But the Warren of Shadow goes much deeper than the realm we know Shadowthrone and Cotillion to rule? It gets so confusing. Correct me if I'm wrong here, please? I assume a lot of this will be answered in MT."
Malazan,300cgi,DumpTruckJester,3,Mon Mar 23 13:57:12 2015 UTC,edur are to shadow as andii are to darkness and liosan are to light yes! and midnight tides and the rest of the books gives some input into the majority of your other questions.

Malazan,300cgi,h0ll0way,8,Mon Mar 23 14:13:36 2015 UTC,"Without veering into spoiler territory: let's just say they won't all be hanging around the campfire trading stories anytime soon.   There are numerous reasons for hostilities between them (some of them stretching wayyyyyyyyy back), but in short: the Liosan are fascist fanatics, the Edur are struggling to regain their former glory, and the Andii are consumed by a slow lethargy & loss of purpose. These characteristics put them at odds with each other."
Malazan,300cgi,DAMCARDLE,2,Mon Mar 23 17:09:01 2015 UTC,"Nice, that paints it pretty well I think. It's a shame, I thought I was going to like the Liosan."

Malazan,300cgi,Ganoes-Stabro_Paran,3,Tue Mar 24 10:37:58 2015 UTC,"The Andii civil war is being covered in the Kharkanas trilogy that Erikson is writing just now,  they aren't really at war with each other just now in a all out fashion but its mostly RAFO to see how they fit together,  Midnight Tides is a hoot and if you remember at the end of H.O.C Trull sits down to tell his story,  Midnight Tides is that story."

Malazan,300cgi,mashedpotatoshoes,2,Mon Mar 23 18:39:46 2015 UTC,I did like him. He's an ex-agent of the Malazan Empire isn't he? Stole riches from the Empress and bailed didn't he?

Malazan,301ky7,HiHaplo,2,Mon Mar 23 19:10:22 2015 UTC,"Which section pages 720-750 map to depends on which edition of the book you have. If I were you, I would fill in the gap with the Tor reread.  That said, I believe publishers will replace books like this if you are able to get in contact with them. I've never done this myself, but I seem to recall reading this somewhere."
Malazan,301ky7,NoFortress,1 point,Mon Mar 23 20:32:39 2015 UTC,"So this is a common flaw depending on the edition? I've thought about contacting Tor however I spent a significant amount of time earmarking the book for important points and don't feel like doing that again. Most likely I'll go to that reread, wasn't sure if one existed."
Malazan,301ky7,NoFortress,2,Mon Mar 23 20:44:29 2015 UTC,"So this is a common flaw depending on the edition?   No, I was saying where page 720 is will depend on the edition. For example, it might be the middle of chapter 20 on the US mass market paperback, a different chapter in the trade paperback or hardcover, a different chapter in the UK edition, etc.  The issue you have is just an unfortunately rare printing error."
Malazan,301ky7,internet_enthusiast,1 point,Tue Mar 24 14:27:52 2015 UTC,"My copy (US mass market paperback) has a different printing error; that same range of pages is affected (I think, although I don't have the book in front of me), but the majority of the text is there, sans the first and last few lines of each page.  I was able to catch the gist of what was going on, but I still missed a lot.  I was extremely frustrated because it occurred during parts that were action packed as well as explanatory (which I can't get enough of).  If I'm not mistaken, this portion of the Tor re-read summarizes the relevant section."
Malazan,300e78,Aurelianus_Augustus,4,Mon Mar 23 13:45:11 2015 UTC,"You are on the Malazan subreddit so I think you know what the answer will be. So I won't embellish it: yes, you should reread GotM. Nothing will sate an epic fantasy fix more than Malaxan."
Malazan,300e78,RonnieRim,1 point,Mon Mar 23 13:48:54 2015 UTC,"aha yea, That's basically what I was expecting. But I figured it was worth a shot just to see what happens."
Malazan,300e78,burningsky25,1 point,Mon Mar 23 13:50:31 2015 UTC,"Hey I basically did the same thing!  A year or so ago I read GotM, but never read more than a couple pages into DG and then didn't pick it back up again.  Over Christmas I decided to give it another go and am now on TtH and loving it!  Guess your question is more if re-reading the first book is worth it and your already gung-ho for the series, but I'd definitely recommend re-reading the first book.  Personally it might be one of my favorites and I'd say there are a number of pertinent details in the first that you'd be quite lost without even a couple books in.  It's also the shortest, so hopefully won't take too long :)"
Malazan,300e78,TriscuitCracker,2,Mon Mar 23 14:39:00 2015 UTC,I'm glad I'm not the only who's been in this situation. I'll definitely reread it before continuing on.
Malazan,300e78,wjbc,1 point,Mon Mar 23 15:30:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, reread the first book. It will be your second time and things will come back to you and it will fit better if you start from the beginning. It is by no means a ""bad"" book but Erikson wrote it 9 years before the rest and it was his first novel and it shows a bit. Combined with his writing style that can be hard to get used too and his lack of infodumping means GoTM can be intimidating, but give it a reread because if epic you want, than Malazan will fit the bill in spades. Post your impressions as you read the series, we love those and we'll try and keep it spoiler free of you have questions. Thanks for visiting the sub!"

I mean we shouldn't have to ""convince"" you, either you like it or you don't, and if you really don't, that's okay, no book series is for everybody and I'm not going to decry you for not liking it or having misgivings about it. It's your opinion!   Having said that, give House of Chains a whirl! You're back to Seven Cities with the Whirlwind uprising in this one and you are introduced to a character that probably changes the most over the course of the series from hated to loved.   One question: did the scenes with Kruppe and Caladan Brood and Quick Ben vs the Necromancers not fulfill the ""showing smartness"" need?"
Malazan,300iwb,TriscuitCracker,-2,Mon Mar 23 14:49:57 2015 UTC,"I mean we shouldn't have to ""convince"" you, either you like it or you don't   That's my problem, it's not a binary thing. I like some aspects, dislike others. I would have no hesitation if it wouldn't be so damn long, it's much better than a lot of books I already read.  HoC sounds interesting then.  As for the Necromancers, I'm not sure I noticed the action. I remember QB going in, showing his force down the two guy's throats (seriously, what could they have done against 12 warrens?), and then walking out. Maybe I missed a whole lot of stuff?"
Malazan,300iwb,TriscuitCracker,6,Mon Mar 23 15:11:46 2015 UTC,"Well it's true there is a lot of ""implied"" rather than shown stuff regarding Quick Ben. Keep reading for more of his badassery.   House of Chains continues the adventures of Crokus, Apsalar, Pust, Icarium/Mappo, Felisin, what the Crippled God is up to in Seven Cities and more, but the real meat of it is a new character who connects lots of events you've read about in the past. Also two other characters are introduced who have one of the best bromances in the series, and who's history is expanded in Midnight Tides, (which is a whole new continent and almost entirely new characters, btw, taking place on this new continent during the events of books 1-4.) After that it's Bonehunters in Book 6 which starts to slowly weave all the plot lines together with books 1-5 to culminate in the Crippled God, Book 10.  Give it a go!"
Malazan,300iwb,TheHopelessGamer,-3,Mon Mar 23 15:28:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I think this gave me a twist."
Malazan,300iwb,Dwolf63,4,Mon Mar 23 16:44:30 2015 UTC,"You should know that there are many, many Malazan fans who consider DG/MoI to be the best two books of the series.   If you didn't enjoy reading them, the rest of the series will likely be unsatisfying to you.  Not that this makes him a perfect author, but Erickson is a student of history, and to be honest, the plain military tactics that he writes are probably torn from the pages of our own, real-life history. What did you find to be so unrealistic about the Chain of Dogs? Also what do you mean when you say ""dangerously"" unrealistic? That seems kind of melodramatic and not constructive at all to add to your discussion."
Malazan,300iwb,Dwolf63,1 point,Mon Mar 23 17:42:27 2015 UTC,"If the rest of the books deal with different stuff than these two, than maybe they will be more to my taste actually.  For the rest, see my answer here."
Malazan,300iwb,Dwolf63,7,Mon Mar 23 19:27:05 2015 UTC,No.  Read it or don't. It shouldn't be anybody's job to justify your tastes or lack thereof.
Malazan,300iwb,Dwolf63,-11,Mon Mar 23 16:30:28 2015 UTC,justify   Get out. How can you read such long books without basic reading skills?
Malazan,300iwb,internet_enthusiast,3,Mon Mar 23 16:43:23 2015 UTC,"Seriously?  How about I ask you the same question? Because if you had basic reading skills you wouldn't be trolling the boards, you'd be busy reading and enjoying the books.  Stopping asking people to hold your hand and stand on your own two literary feet why don't you?  What Malazan requires more than almost any other series is an attention span. You can't rush through it. You have to savour it and pay attention - which is hard because Erikson makes it hard to take your time once the action accelerates.   It's one of the reasons rereads work so well - you're no long as in a rush to see what happens next, so you can be fully experiencing what happens ""in the now"".  Most people who don't appreciate the books have a hard time with attention an comprehension. Master those skills. It will do you good."
Malazan,300iwb,Jsin14,-2,Tue Mar 24 15:35:14 2015 UTC,These days trolling means: someone saying something I don't agree with.  I never asked anyone to justify anything. I asked people to point to stuff that makes it worth to read for someone with the problems I mentioned.  Now really go fuck yourself with your patronizing bullshit.
Malazan,300iwb,Tsarface,3,Tue Mar 24 21:28:18 2015 UTC,"More proof. Profanity - the first recourse of those with no real excuse.  By the way, you may want to look up patronizing. I  don't think it means what you think it means."
Malazan,2zxjep,nieud,4,Sun Mar 22 19:26:21 2015 UTC,"Be glad. Within a few books, all new characters are going to have names that look like alphabet soup. Have fun remembering names like ""Sukul Ankhadu"" or ""Tanal Yathvanar"" or ""Gr'istanas Ish'Ilm"""
Malazan,2zxjep,JebusGobson,3,Mon Mar 23 08:58:40 2015 UTC,"There is not much in the way of foreign language in the series. Occasionally you will come across an old andii name, or names that seem specific to a region and dont carry any english meaning. - You will see that there are some T'lan imass words that carry over (T'lan words seem to be the best developed language apart from english in the series for good reason), and some derivation of older t'lan words that have been modernised from the first empire to modern tongue, including military titles you'll come across later, as well as all titles you've just been familiarised with in MoI (fx shield anvil - Which btw is an interesting word in first empire language.) - When I think about it, I really think a lot of the words are pretty well connected, but would require serious spoiler tags to discuss in detail.  Also about Apsalar, I believe she understands Crokus sentiment when he says the word sorry, nothing else, and since she is herself incredibly sorry - she finds it apt. I think its a delicious case of irony on her part.  With Regards to Calm, she is a forkrul, and like all her brothers and sisters has chosen a name that describes a quality. I believe she would say her name in whatever the local language was, in the case of Karsa, whatever he spoke to her. But for us the reader we just get the translation. Afterall, it wouldnt be much fun to have to flip back and forth to a mile long index of foreign words. Its not that practical in storytelling.  Whiskeyjack is a fun example, but requires spoiler tags to discuss, and honestly I dont think I can use his name as example without taking something from your reading experience.  Edit: In the next book you'll see more examples of T'lan imass spoken, and actually needing translation for the PoV characters, as well as some eleint and Jaghuxery :)  Super spoiler"
Malazan,2zxjep,Silmariel,3,Sun Mar 22 20:29:23 2015 UTC,"Whiskeyjack comes from Wisakedjak, the name of the Algonquian god of mischief   EDIT: Just to make this clear, this isn't a spoiler or anything. That is literally where the word ""Whiskeyjack"" comes from in real life"
Malazan,2zxjep,Imaygetyelledat,2,Tue Mar 24 03:16:30 2015 UTC,"pretty much everyone speaks the common traders tongue, so whatever calms name is in FA, it translates to calm.   when you hear FA talking to each other, they are speaking their language, etc."
Malazan,2zxjep,Gaebryal,1 point,Tue Mar 24 17:27:04 2015 UTC,"Cotillion was definitely fluent in Daru (and I think most of the Malazan soldiers are fluent in many of the languages from around the empire).  Combine this with the fact that many of their names are not names in our traditional sense but just words, it makes sense that they would translate into other languages and be understood.  I think at least Sorry/Apsalar would recognize her name when spoken in Daru since she picked up Cotillion's language skills with all the rest.  Minor Spoiler"

And every book in the series is like this. 3/4 plot/character/world building and 1/4 crazy epic/weepy climaxes.  With book 2 Deadhouse Gates you're heading to a new continent with mostly new characters and a few recurring ones from GoTM. Then Book 3 Memories of Ice you're back to Genebackis and all your Bridgeburner madness. You'll start to see the larger picture of the entire series and get sense of the scope and scale that Erikson is trying to convey. Remember the dramatis personae and the glossary in the front and back of the book are very helpful.   Enjoy!

A guy in his early 20's maybe steps out, headphones in, clutching a copy of The Crippled God under his arm.  I recognized it in slow motion as he walked by, and I so I reached out and tapped him on the shoulder kind of insistently. He turned around with a ""the fuck you bothering me for?!"" face on. I grinned like an insane person and pointed at The Crippled God and then gave him a thumb's up.

At the time my reading in general was minimal. I spent almost every free hour training, fighting or doing undergrad college work.  I was  CS major, I think he was CS and English double major. Never heard him talk to about the books, and I never asked, which to my shame I should have. Would have discovered them few years sooner.  The other person I met. I was in Croatia visiting friends and family, I was reading Reaper's Gale at the time. To my shock, a friend of a friend was a true believer :P. He read all the books, and we ended up talking for several hours. I mean outside of online communities, he's the only person I was able to talk to about Malazan face to face.  I brought up the books to people in grad school. But I don't expect any of them would pick it up. This series is very specific. It doesn't have broad appeal.  I mean to bring up the scope a bit. I can count on one hand how many people I've met that read fantasy in my day to day life. And I can count on two hands outside of family how many people actually read for pleasure.  My crowd of people I usually associate with in my life are programmers, gamers and martial artist. The last one is a pool of all sorts of people, but they generally don't read books, but there are few who do. Those that do read, the books end up being more philosophy books (sort of how I got into reading those as well). Funny in all my life the people who end up thinking more about actions and behavior are people who enjoy beating the crap out of each other."

Normally if someone's looking for recommendations then they're new to the genre, and if they're new to the genre then a whole lot more of Malazan than usual will go right over their head. Their standards won't be so solidly low from reading other authors like Sanderson, Gemmell, or the other more-accessibles. :/  I do recommend it without hesitation to people if their ""What I like to read"" list seems to qualify them for it. :)"
Malazan,2zp20x,YearOfTheMoose,3,Fri Mar 20 16:06:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly. For instance, if somebody says ""I'm new to the fantasy genre, the last thing I read was ""Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire"" then I may recommend Malazan.  If they say ""I'm new to the fantasy genre, I like Hunger Games!"" then I usually start with Dragonlance, Salvatore, Brooks, Eddings or Sanderson.  Maybe Martin if they are fans of the show."
Malazan,2zp20x,MarquisHalimOndore,2,Fri Mar 20 16:53:58 2015 UTC,"A+ recommendations.  I love recommending books to people at B&N, even though I don't work there. <_<"
Malazan,2zp20x,Aiolus,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:01:52 2015 UTC,I was reading Bonehunters at work when a co-worker came up to me and said they'd read the first one. Otherwise I've finally managed to get a friend to read them so we talk about malazan when we have a shift together.
Malazan,2zp20x,Clearly_a_fake_name,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:21:24 2015 UTC,"A few times irl people talk about game of thrones, or their favorite fantasy books. I always bring up Malazan. A few have read it not enough.   The other case is my username on twitch is something Malazan related. I'd say what it is but twitch chat terrifies me. Quite a few people have talked to me about the books and it's like 3/4 good reviews."
Malazan,2zolx8,Fnarley,5,Fri Mar 20 09:28:50 2015 UTC,"Silverfox appears in ICE's novel Assail.  More or less from what I gathered, also as I believe Fiddler said that the crippled god could have slit many of the other god's throats on his way out through the door if not forced.  Most of your last remarks are also answered in ICE novels, so i'd say go with them :)"
Malazan,2zolx8,Harryzo,2,Fri Mar 20 10:23:01 2015 UTC,Cool just grabbed night of knives.   Yeah I guessed that some of the loose threads would be picked up in the ICE books.
Malazan,2zolx8,xolotl92,1 point,Fri Mar 20 11:37:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, ICE.  One thing, he wrote NoK way before anything else, so the writing gets way better as the books go.  Enjoy!"
Malazan,2zolx8,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:33:24 2015 UTC,Forge of Darkness is great prequel and answers a lot of questions as well as asking just as many. I loved TCG but yes there were some loose ends that didn't quite get tied up to my satisfaction but most of them were answered in the ICE novels.
Malazan,2znb1a,linuxcloud,3,Fri Mar 20 00:25:00 2015 UTC,Jaghut humour. Dassem was angry that he got his vengeance taken away. RAFO. Not sure what you mean? He no longer is since he died but he still carries around his mask and since we don't know his name its the easiest thing to refer to him as.
Malazan,2znb1a,Brys_Beddict,2,Fri Mar 20 01:47:08 2015 UTC,"Here's an except I found from the final chapter of the book.   Storm of light, a scattered moon, a rising sun behind bruised clouds from which brown, foul rain poured down, Black Coral was a city under siege, and the Tiste Andii within it could now at last feel the death of their Lord, and with him the death of their world.  Was it fair, to settle the burden of long-dead hope upon one person, to ask of that person so much? Was it not, in fact, cowardice? He had been their strength. He had been their courage. And he had paid the Hound's Toll for them all, centuries upon centuries, and not once had he turned away.   I was just curious what is meant by ""the Hound's Toll"" here. Especially since this is essentially the title of the book."
Malazan,2znb1a,BlackViperMWG,2,Fri Mar 20 02:10:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's metaphoric. Like ""Gardens of the moon"", another title, which is written in the books only twice IIRC.  About 3. and practically all your questions written here or not, plan a reread soon, go here (https://www.goodreads.com/topic/list_group/85396-the-malazan-fallen)and read after every chapter summaries (in group read of every book).. End of first reading is good, but you don't fully understand the extend of Erikson's, careful rereading is the only way to know more and connect the dots, apart from furious googling."
Malazan,2znb1a,Caomedes,2,Fri Mar 20 08:38:51 2015 UTC,"Oh I definitely plan to re-read this series at some point. I get the feeling that some portions of the books I don't care for (e.g. the slower parts of TtH) would be more appreciated a second time through.  How do you think the goodreads summaries (I did not know existed until now) stack up to Tor's? I don't care for the Tor re-read, to be honest. I followed along with it up through BH, but stopped once I started RG. It felt needlessly verbose to me at times, yet would gloss over some finer points that I was interested in."
Malazan,2znb1a,Fnarley,2,Fri Mar 20 11:44:15 2015 UTC,"From Malazan Reread of the Fallen in Tor:  Sssimon:   I'm not a native speaker and I'm confused by the meaning of the title. Steven, can you shed some light, esp. on ""toll""? Is it a noun/verb? Which definition did you have in mind: tax, ringing, summoning? I remember the phrase appears in the book in the form of ""the hound's tax"" (as mentioned by Kruppe). Does this mean the title could just as well be ""The Toll of the Hounds""? If so, why isn't it? In the Polish translation the book is called ca. ""The Hound's Tax"". Would you say this is a correct translation?   Erikson:   Sssimon: The Hound’s Tax? Oh dear. It’s the curse of the English language, isn’t it? All that connotative crap we gleefully employ in order to confound translators worldwide. The title just sounded good to me. It hovered there, amidst swirling clouds, hinting at this and that, and the other, too. Things like sonorous bells (the Vikings are coming! Run!); things like the price that must be paid (what your translator called ‘tax’); things like tallying the toll, as in just how many major characters are going die in this damned book, anyway? As for the ‘Hounds’ bit, well again, echoing back to Gardens of the Moon and their first appearance. As you note, many languages are strictly denotative, but not English. Makes for problems all the time.   Link  I was curious too, because not being native I didn't know if I was missing something or he was being subtle (or both!)."
Malazan,2znx8v,gathmoon,6,Fri Mar 20 03:46:20 2015 UTC,"In a Q&A with Erickson, I think on Tor, he said that there is a really big, huge, amazing secret there, but he hasn't given us enough information to figure it out yet. That was right before the release of Forge of Darkness, so some of the speculation about those characters could be closer to home."
Malazan,2znx8v,ScaraBandaris,3,Fri Mar 20 04:26:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah there's been speculation that either one of the characters from FoD becomes QB, or one of their souls is inside him, or something like that. Nobody knows for sure."
Malazan,2znx8v,Zingbrit,4,Fri Mar 20 05:11:17 2015 UTC,"We know almost certainly, one of his souls is Tiste Andii."

Malazan,2znx8v,Brys_Beddict,1 point,Fri Mar 20 18:50:59 2015 UTC,I missed that interview. Given that fiddler recently gave away quick's position in house dark it would make sense he is associated with or a tiste outright originally.
Malazan,2znx8v,Brys_Beddict,3,Fri Mar 20 12:27:15 2015 UTC,One of his souls is Andii from way back (like FoD times).  That's my theory anyway.
Malazan,2znx8v,Brys_Beddict,1 point,Fri Mar 20 16:30:26 2015 UTC,"That would be really interesting. Do you think that is the ""original"" Quick Ben perhaps? Maybe he shifted into a human body, at some point, to hide."

If you're going to reread I suggest you pick up ICE's books so you can read them at the same time as Erikson's."
Malazan,2zmat2,Nichase,1 point,Thu Mar 19 19:49:07 2015 UTC,"I've been reading some of ICE's books but they just don't have that same zing :( I'm not 100% sure why, but they just don't grab me as much."
Malazan,2zmat2,drae-,2,Thu Mar 19 20:47:31 2015 UTC,"The later ones are much better. Ice really improves over his books.  I haven't made it past stormweilder, but I see a marked improvement with each one I've read.  The books get so much better with a reread, the foreshadowing is much more apparent and it is much easier to understand the (don't worry about it) timeline."
Malazan,2zmat2,BlackViperMWG,2,Thu Mar 19 20:51:36 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah, I am rereading saga for second time and it's still very awesome. But first reread is the best, when you start noticing things and connecting them and suddenly, almost everything makes sense!"

I don't have the courage to go back to the Chain of Dogs haha. There's so much nostalgia and understanding that comes with a reread though."
Malazan,2zmat2,Kamins0d,1 point,Thu Mar 19 19:59:36 2015 UTC,You make a very convincing argument. The Chain of Dogs was rough but that follow up gut punch of the bridge burners and Itkovian was pretty tough too.

It's amazing, and as good as reading it the first time, and in many ways, it's even better because now I can connect more dots and see how it all interweaves together, and there is so much you don't remember or connect the first time around. Also more weepy however because I know what's coming. I also can take my time more and savor some of the more philosophical chapters.   Also, have you read Forge of Darkeness or the ICE books? It makes certain plotlines all the better.  If you haven't, I recommend reading FoD before you start the main series again, and read the ICE books in between the main series following the order in the sidebar."

Malazan,2zmat2,TisteSimeon,2,Thu Mar 19 20:49:37 2015 UTC,"Definitely worth a reread. I found the reread more emotionally intense than the first time personally. I think it's because on the first read I was so caught up with trying to understand the plot threads and such that I missed the emotional intensity of some of the events.  Obviously,  hit me pretty hard both times. There were two things in particular that hit me hard during the reread that I didn't really remember from the first read. The whole thing with  was the first. The second was . I blubbed for ages over that one. As others have mentioned, it's worth reading Esslemont's books during a reread. Good tips for a reading order can be found here.  Good luck :-)"

By the end of the book it was my favorite in the series. After finishing that book all i've wanted to do is get back to Lether.

I can't remember when they show up so I don't want to spoil it, but it gets better, I promise. That and it might not seem like it now, but what's happening in these pages are very important to the events of the next books.

I've loved all the books so far (only reading Erikson's books) but I'm having a hard time caring about or feeling interested in the story that is unfolding in this book. On top of what feels like endless bouts of examinations of what life is about in this book. To this point I've always enjoyed Erikson's characters waxing philosophic about the greater meanings or lessons of life, usually surrounded by some kickass shit going on around it. But thus far, lacking the kickass shit, this book just feels different.   I""m going ot finish, its not in my nature to stop and skip this book just to get back to other plot lines in the series, but I definitely feel like it, and I've never before felt that in this series.

Here is the most accurate world map I know of. Unta is in Quon Tali near the center of the map, while Pale and Drujhistan are on Genebackis, near the north east.  Here is an official map of North Genebackis where you can see Pale and Darujhistan, and here is Quon Tali where you can see Unta. Also has Itko Kan where the massacre at the beginning of the book takes place."

Malazan,2zkhw1,stabro,4,Thu Mar 19 17:53:15 2015 UTC,"There isn't a full official one at the moment, no. The world is absolutely huge and you have a loooooooong way to go with it! You don't, at the moment, need to know where Unta is, just that it is a long way away.  That being said, try the Malazan Wiki Page about maps but bear in mind that there might be spoilers or whatever on some of them (maybe...) There are so many places you have yet to discover!  Also the official forums has a bunch of discussions about the maps dotted around the place. As I said, there isn't an official full world map but most of the placements of the continents are probably in the right place."

I checked out a few (fan-made) world maps for reference and it really helped me orient myself.  There are no official ones of the whole world, but most of the ones you'll find are basically similar.  For GoTM just check Genebackis and Quon Tali maps on the wiki.  As an aside, I noticed most recently during Steven Erikson's tCG Q&A at tor.com a user tried unsuccessfully for the second time to get him to comment on the most recent maps from the malazanempire forums.  Erikson claimed the links provided didn't work, but it would be nice to get an opinion from him one way or another about maps."

Remember the dramatis personae and the glossary in the front and the back of the book are your friends. Often the first book is the hardest to get through, you may be overwhelmed by the feeling of having been dropped in a foreign country with no context for all these names, races, magics, histories, etc. This is normal.  Erikson does not really do infodumps, you have to gleam meaning and clues from the context of the characters and put it all together, often over the course of several books. His payoffs are always worth it.  Malazan demands you pay attention and does not hold your hand.  Just read on and post your impressions and any questions you have, we'll try and keep it spoiler free. Erikson is an anthropologist and archeologist so his world building skills are second to none. He also wrote GotM 9 years before the rest of the series so keep that in mind. If Book One doesent grab you as much as you'd like, I recommend reading through Book 2 or at least Book 3. He is heavy on the philosophy, action is generally brutal, and his last 200 pages of climax in every book are nothing short of spectacular. And if it just isn't clicking, no shame in putting it down. No series is for everybody.   Welcome to the sub!"

It might take you a bit longer than your average book but trust us when we say that this is an investment worth your time.

I loved the fact that you start out as a reader utterly lost in the in medias res because it made reading the book a challenge. It was like doing the Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales all over again where I had to do reading on the side of my reading just to follow. Flipping constantly between the action and maps and glossaries and character list, then hitting the wiki when a term I didn't understand bugged me. God it was great. Then I tried Divergent due to my GF's insistence and found the lack of challenge boring.  But please remember, I am a bit weird."

Malazan,2zj2lt,timefortiesto,8,Wed Mar 18 23:58:37 2015 UTC,"Well, it depends on the god. Most commonly though Elder Gods have fallen into obscurity (because of both the inevitability of time, and also some spoiler stuff) and since their power is pretty proportional to their followers means they can't do much.    K'rul specifically was cursed to be forgotten by the world by Kallor (as seen in the prologue of this book) and that had happened and he'd been more or less non existent for a very long time, until blood was spilled on a building that used to be his temple in Darujhistan (this happens in GotM), and he's been slowly back on the rise since then."
Malazan,2zj2lt,SageOfTheWise,4,Thu Mar 19 00:17:13 2015 UTC,The only thing I would add is that a big part of the elder gods losing influence and followers was the emergence of the current-gen gods/ascendants.

Malazan,2ziut3,MetaBotch,2,Thu Mar 19 10:48:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think he'd come close to killing the room full of nobles at the time of his proclamation. He's only died once at this point. Trull, Fear, or both together would smack him around. All they have to do is cripple but not kill him.   Even with control of the shadow wraiths.. it's not like the Edur collective can offer no sorcerous resistance against the wraiths."
Malazan,2ziut3,MetaBotch,5,Thu Mar 19 13:05:52 2015 UTC,"They probably would kill him if he were mortal, but i think theyre deterred by the fact he would resurrect even more powerful than before he died."

Malazan,2ziut3,Eltotsira,4,Thu Mar 19 12:57:32 2015 UTC,"When you find strange details like this in fiction, remember that they exist during our own history as well. For example, take the Roman invasion of Celtic Britain. The Celts tactics of harrassing Roman infantry from chariots to break up their formations before charging right through the middle played havoc on Ceaser's armies during the minor skirmishes. But when it came time for the big battles, the Celts formed up in large ranks, fighting in a style the Romans were actually familiar with, the Celts lost every single time. Had the Celts chosen battle strategies that complimented their effective tactics, they might have driven back the Romans and history today would be radically different, but they didn't.  Likewise, the Edur could have cast Rhulad out as an abomination and turned their backs on him, but they didn't.  But the text does provide some clues, and this is why I love how Erikson's background in anthropolgy shapes his fiction. The modern Tiste Edur just didn't seem to have a culture of challenging or questioning authority, going back all the way to Scabandari Bloodeye. They don't like to challenge tradition or the way things are done, they still insist on calling their cities ""villages"" because they've always been called villages. So when the old king backs down and gives power to the new king, everyone follows suit, because that's what Edur are expected to do, follow the king, as tradition mandates. Trull Sengar seems to be only Edur who openly and consistently resists and questions Rhulad and he is treated as being deviant, only tolerated because he's Rhulad's older brother, and both of them come from a powerful noble house in a powerful Edur tribe. If Trull had just been some nobody farmer they probably would have killed him on the spot."
Malazan,2ziut3,Eltotsira,4,Fri Mar 20 00:52:20 2015 UTC,"I don't see how the Celts fighting the Romans is relatable to this scenario. I'm questioning the motivations of a people, you're talking about poor battle strategy.  So you lost me at ""likewise"".   But to your next point, if the Edur are so stuck on tradition, why the hell would they accept Rhulad? Before this, he is treated as the child that he is. I doubt they have any precedent in their entire history for the youngest son of a noble family seizing the throne of their accepted leader. I see nothing traditional in yielding Rhulad the throne."
Malazan,2ziut3,Eltotsira,2,Fri Mar 20 13:12:21 2015 UTC,"The comparison is that sometimes people do things that don't make sense in the real world all the time and that was the best example I had on hand at the time.  Going back to fiction, the Edur followed Rhulad because their King followed him, and Morsang bowed down to Rhulad because he knew what the new emperor was capable of with that sword and so knew there was no way he could stop Rhulad anyway."
Malazan,2ziut3,Tsarface,2,Fri Mar 20 13:28:58 2015 UTC,"Hannan Mosag's capitulation is certainly the strongest point to me. And it makes sense for him to do - Rhulad would kill him first, and easily.   But the idea that the Edur, who are not inherently evil, and in fact seem to be pretty ""good"" dudes overall, just kneel before the psychotic abomination that is Rhulad... it's hard to believe they would do that, is all.   Following an insane person seems, by extension, insane in itself.   They're thousands of years old, but are as children in this scene."

Malazan,2zdmnp,Aiolus,3,Wed Mar 18 22:49:19 2015 UTC,"Glad you enjoyed it!  What were your favorite/disliked parts?  I immediately read the ICE novels (still have to read Assail) and Forge of Darkness.  I took a a break for about half a year, then I just decided to pick it back up from GoTM, because frankly, I just missed the world and I wanted too. I had other books to read, yes, but I honestly wanted to re-read Malazan more, just for the experience. I am now just starting Crippled God for the second time, and it frankly, has been as if I am reading a whole new series, except this time, I can connect so much more of the dots and retain so much more of it.  Knowing all the foreshadowing outcomes just makes it more weepy.  It makes me love it all the more."
Malazan,2zdmnp,Tsarface,2,Tue Mar 17 19:30:09 2015 UTC,"Yes!  It occurred to me at some point during DG or maybe MOI that all those people talking about re-reading were on to something, it becomes self-evident that one would get so much out of a re-read from all the connections made and callbacks to previous events.    Part of my motivation in asking the question was in trying to figure out how much time is too much, or, in how much time would I start to forget things.  I think that, like you, I'll miss the world too much for any risk of that to become a reality.  As far as favorite/disliked parts, are you referring to tCG or the series as a whole?  I have to say I'm a little surprised that some people weren't 100% happy with the ending, I thought it was as good and as complete an ending as was possible for a series of this magnitude and length.  It truly astounded me how few ""loose ends"" remained, and how much care went into sending off each character (especially those who are unlikely to be revisited, for example, in the Kharkanas trilogy).  I made a post awhile back where I stated that, upon starting DOD, that I doubted either it or tCG could rival MT (which was my favorite up to that point), but they sure gave it a run for its money.  Although I didn't find much to dislike, I found Tavore's arc was probably my favorite thing about the conclusion, that character is so unbelievably great, and the catharsis which comes in that final battle and her reunion with her brother was amazing.  I also loved the Snake storyline, how well crafted and intentional every bit we get about it, the connection to D'rek, the character of Badelle, the significance of Rutt/Held and Saddic, it was masterfully done.  Another of my favorite scenes is of course when the Snake meets the Bonehunters.  In any case I could go on here for hours but I won't.  It was a series of many, many standout moments and very few nitpicks (I had a few about TtH but I'll save that for other posts).  Thanks for your reply, I have and will continue to enjoy your posts here, especially the ones in which you patiently extoll the virtues of this series to new readers!"

I just remember him getting hung up on his morality so often that I had trouble taking him seriously. I'm sort of a philosophical sociopath though when it comes to book characters and their ethics so maybe thats part of it. Another thing, which I didn't really take into account until reading a few other people's reviews and retrospectively analyzing it was how the Damien/Tarrant relationship had some serious (and pretty comedic considering it was probably unintentional) homoerotic undertones. Not that there's anything wrong with that! (Seinfeld). Just made me laugh looking back at those two.  However, I do have a lot of respect for the series. The world was just awesome, human subconscious-influenced environment, etc. Totally unique in terms of creativity."
Malazan,2zdmnp,AllWrong74,3,Thu Mar 19 18:26:10 2015 UTC,"I've lost count of my rereads. This current re-read is probably my second time through the complete series since TCG was released.   I read the first two books back in 2002. Then reread them when MoI came out before reading MOI.  Then reread the first three again before going onto the fourth when that one came out.   I think at a certain point, probably when TTH came out I didn't go back to the beginning, but reread from book six, probably the same when DoD was released.   Then I reread the entire series from scratch while waiting for TCG.  This latest reread started probably a few weeks after the last one ended. I take my time with them now, rather than power reading through them.   I'm a Malazan addict.   I've read tons of fantasy before this, not as much after. There are a few works I'm waiting on, but I could see myself starting the journey again within a year...."
Malazan,2zdmnp,AllWrong74,1 point,Wed Mar 18 01:37:13 2015 UTC,"Wow!  That is some dedication, and it speaks volumes about this series that one can get something valuable out of the same well over and over again.  I'm not as well read in fantasy as you, but would I be right in guessing that, because of your ""addiction"", much of it ceased to work in the same way for you after Malazan?  Which series would you hold in similar estimation?"
Malazan,2zdmnp,BlackViperMWG,1 point,Wed Mar 18 02:03:17 2015 UTC,"Yay! Someone just like me!    The only thing different is I didn't quite finish DoD before the release of tCG: I didn't wanted to be left in agony waiting a year or so before being able to read the last of the series. So I went on to another full reread that took me about the time it took for tCG to be released. I'm itching to start another one, probably starting in the summer months."

In dreams brought to ruin.  In love withered.  In the shadow of Death's spectre, ever a threat to end what you will not relinquish."""

Malazan,2zdofe,mykunos,2,Tue Mar 17 20:27:14 2015 UTC,I noticed Kallor is in the list of ascendants in the glossary in Memories of Ice. any idea why he is there if he can't ascend? It really confused me when reading MoI's prologue initially and I still don't know why.
Malazan,2zdofe,drae-,8,Tue Mar 17 20:54:51 2015 UTC,"Well he's a power player who would've long since ascended sans curse.   Probably would be more appropriate to place him in the section with broods army, along with korlat and hurlochel, but he's also a step ahead of them and serves brood at his discretion, so that's a bit out of place as well.  Maybe Erikson put him there for lack of a better place."

Malazan,2zcth8,Silmariel,7,Wed Mar 18 12:36:37 2015 UTC,"I would have Anomander be saved in some way. I dont know what it meant that he had the eye from Apsalara - but I would like if somehow all his essence was gathered and he came back. It really bothered me that he had to die to fix Draconnus and Mother Darks fuck ups. Tbh a tiste princess made mother of darkness because drac was in love with her, doesnt exactly lend itself as good credentials for being asigned the role, and then she pouts for thousands of years, and Anomander has to find purpose for her people, because she isnt around to listen to their soultalk. It is so unfair that he had to carry that burden. He carries around dracs sword of ultimate idiocy, fixes dracs control issues of binding the gate to the sword, and has to die in the process, and all he gets is mother dark comming back, but going immediately awol again because she is grieving her son. Great!  Omg, it makes me so mad even thinking about it.   I know his sacrifice is like emo porn, but seriously, - and what is the meaning of throwing him the eye?   A close second is Trull dying the way he does, that was just infuriating. So we stick with this character and learn to love him (lets face it, he is one of the most likeable characters in the whole series) and he gets an arrow in the back while mourning his brother, and unknown to him the child his love is carrying. - That was just cruel, and unusual writing from Steven. Someone definately pissed on his sugared slice of bread that day."

Malazan,2zcth8,BirdBathandBeyond,2,Tue Mar 17 16:26:01 2015 UTC,"Well, she was always that shallow.  It was just Crokus' perceptions that had changed.  Also, he banged her anyway, because he's a young guy whose love left him, and she's hot."
Malazan,2zcth8,Lobsterpunch,4,Wed Mar 18 12:37:50 2015 UTC,I hated pretty much everything to do with Silverfox.  Kallor clearly fears what she can become and the power that she has but then nothing really happens.  I thought Tattersail was an awesome character and Silverfox was just disappointing.  Also everything needs more Iron Bars!
Malazan,2zcth8,BirdBathandBeyond,2,Tue Mar 17 18:51:55 2015 UTC,"You, my friend, need to hop on the ICE train."

Malazan,2zcth8,Rhinomeat,4,Wed Mar 18 02:56:08 2015 UTC,I don't get the very minor addition of quick Bens sister to the story in TBH.  It was just unnecessary. It have more background on qb that one could already surmise and all it ultimately did was provide a very convenient motive to get quick Ben to where shadowthrone wanted him when another reason could have easily been made without leaving an insignificant significant character.  Then again if she shows up in the Karsa booms I can't complain much.  Just dislike having named characters do essentially nothing if they have a purpose beyond adding flavor and depth which I don't feel that she did at all.

Malazan,2zctp1,Tsarface,5,Tue Mar 17 14:58:31 2015 UTC,"Spoilers to the end, I guess.  I was ok with this book, as it was plodding but had enough fun scenes for me. Mainly I disliked the ending. It did give closure, but I have come to expect really epic endings for these stories, and all we got was that the Forkrul are dangerous, but sleepy; the end. It just kind of seemed like he had these threads that needed tied up, but he hadn't really thought them through, and then ended by saying ""yeah, good enough""."
Malazan,2zctp1,ScaraBandaris,3,Tue Mar 17 17:21:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed on all accounts. I remember in Erikson's books lots of characters mentioning stuff like ""What the fuck is going on in Assail? Do you have word of the Imass? etc."" Then we get this story and its not bad, but certainly not concluded in an epic fashion. If this wasn't apparently the last ICE book, I wouldn't mind so much. But given that this was supposed to wrap up the 2 most important threads of the ICE storylines (The T'lan Imass/Silverfox thing, and the whole Crimson Guard ""What have we done to ourselves??"" plot), I was a little disappointed."
Malazan,2zctp1,mirion,5,Tue Mar 17 18:18:22 2015 UTC,"Well, the CG turned themselves into the T'lan Imass. I just wish that they had made a bigger deal about it."
Malazan,2zctp1,amtroy,3,Wed Mar 18 00:55:45 2015 UTC,"This was my biggest problem with it too. At one point in the Erikson books (think it was Olar Ethil in MoI?) it's mentioned that T'lan Imass are being slaughtered, and that it's human(s) doing so. That seems to have been dropped entirely in favor of some weak gold rush storyline and more Imass vs Jaghut drama.  And I think that summarizes well my main problem with all of ICE's books: it's not necessarily that they're bad (though I did find BaB and Assail to not be very good), it's that they're just so underwhelming. He takes some of the highest potential story lines and just doesn't deliver."
Malazan,2zctp1,StormyGesler,2,Wed Mar 18 01:56:39 2015 UTC,Hey what do you think of the theory that Jethiss is actually Anomander? it's a pretty popular theory on other forums!

I'm wondering how Op got Spinnock out of it.   Edit: and actually this was one of my least favourite things to happen in the series, but I can't comment it in that thread, especially as one person's least favourite is that Rake wasn't saved some way... Hope they enjoy Assail I guess."
Malazan,2zctp1,MoranthMunitions,1 point,Wed Mar 18 06:57:44 2015 UTC,"Well at the very last part of the book, Jethiss mentions that he has his name back, and that he has to go to Coral to pay respects to a friend he played Kef Tanar with. I may be wrong but I had thought Spinnock and the Seerdomin guy played Kef Tanar all the time in TtH?"
Malazan,2zctp1,Berserker42,3,Wed Mar 18 14:24:43 2015 UTC,"I've read up on the Spinnock stuff and reckon it's too hard to say either way. He was doing those games for Rake after all, and that's the strongest connection."

Malazan,2z9nxe,Iliad_Keys,3,Mon Mar 16 21:16:18 2015 UTC,Pre-undead T'lan Imass are simply called the Imass.  One of them (I don't want to spoil who) will explain (I believe it's in this book) the purpose of the glottal stop in reference to so many T'lan Imass words (including the one in T'lan).

Malazan,2z9nxe,Giotto,1 point,Wed Mar 18 07:31:25 2015 UTC,I think they only destroyed part of it when trying to kill him. When the Elder Gods come across him in the MoI prologue he's definitely finished the job himself.

But in any case, he definitely destroyed that empire, that time. And in the interim has probably destroyed a couple more, his and others, especially because of that curse. In one of the later books there's definitely mentions of other empires, and a solid reference to one of them in that one memory from Saranas too. I don't think it was the same empire anyway, but it could have been, from some of the descriptions of stuff in BaB."

There's also the greater powers - Anomander Rake, the Malazan Empire, and the Jaghut Tyrant. They all converge in Darujhistan, essentially drawn by each other. The Bridgeburners by the Empire, Rake by the Jaghut, and Crokus, Mallick, et al. by the City Council."

Neither series is known for going off the rails, and both authors are very much alive. Nothing to worry about. I really enjoyed all 10 books of the main series, including the first one, and they were 10 of the best books I've ever read. Go for it."
Malazan,2z994t,TurboS40,9,Mon Mar 16 18:40:26 2015 UTC,"Yes. Do it.   Don't be dissuaded by less than stellar reviews. As everyone will tell you, the first book has a tendency to be overwhelming, but it is necessary, or at least extremely highly recommended, that you do not skip it. The series as a whole is amazing.  If you're interested enough to ask about it, you should be able to give the first book a real effort. Once you dive in and start to get a picture of what's going on, you'll love it.   And as others have said, I don't know where you've read that the series isn't finished. The ten book main series is complete."
Malazan,2z994t,Zingbrit,5,Mon Mar 16 18:51:49 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. The main series is finished. Dive in!  Remember the dramatis personae and the glossary in the front and the back of the book are your friends. Often the first book is the hardest to get through, not always, but you may be overwhelmed by the feeling of having been dropped in a foreign country with no context for all these names, races, magics, histories, etc. This is normal, just read on and post your impressions and any questions you have, we'll try and keep it spoiler free. Erikson is an anthropologist and archeologist so his world building skills are second to none. He also wrote GotM 9 years before the rest of the series so keep that in mind.  If Book One doesent grab you as much as you'd like, I recommend reading through Book 2 or at least Book 3.  He is heavy on the philosophy, action is generally brutal, and his last 200 pages of climax in every book are nothing short of spectacular.    Welcome to the sub! Hope you enjoy Malazan."

Esselmont (referred to on this sub as ICE) is writing a series of standalones, they are the Tales of the Malazan Empire.  The Book of the Fallen is very much worth reading.  Gardens of the Moon gets its low rating, because Erikson throws you into the world with a basic understanding of how it works (let's say you have as much knowledge as your average farmer).  You have to figure out everything as you read your way through the series, and actually see how things work.  He doesn't do info dumps, and he doesn't hold your hand.  This is very different than the way most authors (especially fantasy authors) operate.  As a result, a lot of people give up on this one book, and give it low ratings."
Malazan,2z994t,AllWrong74,4,Tue Mar 17 05:23:21 2015 UTC,"The only negatives that I can see for the series is that it's quite long and a little on the difficult side of things. I'm just getting into the final book of the series now so I obviously think the commitment is worth it, and think that they may be the best books I've ever read. But if you're looking for a bit of an easier shorter series, then this isn't really for you."
Malazan,2z994t,nonrelatedarticle,3,Mon Mar 16 19:43:42 2015 UTC,"Definitely do not skip book one. You would be quite lost. I highly recommend the series though. And yes, the main ten book series is complete. Everything else coming out is side stuff."
Malazan,2z994t,ScaraBandaris,3,Mon Mar 16 19:01:34 2015 UTC,"I have said this in other threads and that is that I am not a particularly strong reader and had a bit of a hard time getting through GotM but once I did I was hooked. I am only up to MT and can't wait to do the recommended reading patten of finishing this series, finishing Ian C. Esselmont's series and then the re-read. This group is tremendously helpful and supportive so dig in!"
Malazan,2z994t,Boru12,3,Mon Mar 16 19:24:33 2015 UTC,"Your question is already answered, but I just want to mention that if you enjoy complicated, philosophical series you might want to check out R. Scott Bakker's Prince of Nothing and The Aspect-Emperor series as well."
Malazan,2z994t,ashemedai,2,Tue Mar 17 07:12:45 2015 UTC,"Hey man i've only just started the series (into book 2) and i thoroughly enjoyed Gardens. It's a very straight shooting fantasy series. It's like the author knows you are familiar with magic and decides to crank it up a bit. The interactions and various scenes are extremely memorable, i highly recommend it"
Malazan,2z994t,CapytannHook,2,Tue Mar 17 09:02:39 2015 UTC,I thought this was going to be a thread where Steven Erikson would be asking questions about the Malazan series.
Malazan,2z994t,JebusGobson,1 point,Tue Mar 17 10:08:46 2015 UTC,I am just finishing Gardens of the Moon. I really do not understand the hate toward this book. If it has to do with the fact that the rest of the series is such a treat GotM looks worse in retrospect then I am all the more excited to keep reading.
Malazan,2z994t,freeformjazz,2,Tue Mar 17 14:11:06 2015 UTC,"Oh, it's not hate, it's just an acknowledgement that it tends to be the hardest to get into due to Erikson's writing style. Not a bad book by any means, if anything it improves by leaps and bounds during a reread the entire book is one giant foreshadow."
Malazan,2z994t,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Tue Mar 17 18:21:36 2015 UTC,"The series is finished; there are more books coming out, but in a separate series.  The first book is a bit of a slog, and the writing is not up to his later standards; think of it as an awkward pilot episode.  It takes a lot of people two or three attempts to finish it.  No, you can't skip book 1, or you will be severely underinformed for the rest of the series. Though it's a little taxing, realize that even the worst of Erikson's writing is better than many, many other authors' best. You will not regret reading it."
Malazan,2z994t,TheBananaKing,1 point,Wed Mar 18 02:47:21 2015 UTC,"You can't skip book 1, just because it starts and finishes lost in medias res and the next book goes to a complete different continent don't think it's not crucial. The stuff with Ganoes, Sorry, and Crokus will carry you through the entire series alone."

Malazan,2zb3q3,nieud,18,Tue Mar 17 02:35:44 2015 UTC,"Sir is used when addressing a commanding officer, regardless of gender.  Not unique to Malazan at all."
Malazan,2zb3q3,Prefects,4,Tue Mar 17 02:55:13 2015 UTC,"In the first two books I don't think we saw much military interaction involving female officers, so you probably didn't notice it. But yeah, sir can be gender neutral in these contexts, even though we're used to using it only as a formal address for men."
Malazan,2zb3q3,Zingbrit,6,Tue Mar 17 04:33:01 2015 UTC,"I think it's unique to Malazan in that ""sir"" is used to refer to almost everyone.  Itkovian uses ""sir"" to address the recruit, so it looks like a Grey Sword custom."
Malazan,2zb3q3,Xardov,3,Tue Mar 17 10:20:15 2015 UTC,"Sir is usually reserved for superior officers who are male, while Ma'am is used to adress female superior officers. However it can vary depending on the organisation. The sense I am getting is that the less gender matters in a structure, as is the case in the Malaz books and in some sci fi - the more often you hear Sir used to adress superior officers regardless of gender (because the gender is irrelevant in the storyline).  The example you mention, I allways concluded the same, that Itkovian is being polite and gracious, and adresses the recruit that way because he is respectful, and this is just the way he is and rank doesnt matter in that regard (for him)"
Malazan,2zb3q3,Silmariel,1 point,Tue Mar 17 11:46:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with this, the use of ""Sir"" seems to be a deliberate choice by Erikson with respect to the Grey Swords (and in other military orders as well).  Its not that others don't use it, but it is used in a different way.  The Grey Swords seem to use ""Sir"" almost regardless of rank, at least among Brukhalian, Itkovian and Karnadas."
Malazan,2z92tv,Squadz,5,Mon Mar 16 17:23:14 2015 UTC,"I tell people having trouble with getting into the series that book three is really when the language of the series clicks. There is so little exposition in these book because you are witnessing a living world where either A) the characters understand what is happening and don't need to explain it to themselves, or B) they don't understand it either, so you are in the dark as often as they are. I hear questions about made up words like telaba. If you see headscarves everyday, you know what it is and you don't have to think about it, so neither does the character. You get those early explanations of warrens being like cracking a door, and people complain that they don't understand, but that's all the character knows at that point and can't explain it any further, so you are along for the ride. It'll be easier for you from here on out."
Malazan,2z92tv,ScaraBandaris,5,Mon Mar 16 18:57:04 2015 UTC,"Glad you're enjoying it! For me as well, MoI was what made me say, ""Okay, I finally get it, and now I'm in for the long haul."" I'm jealous you're reading all these for the first time!   And just think...you have 7 more books to go...where can it all go from here?  And then the 6 Esselmont stories, the Bauchellin and Korbal Broach novellas, and then Forge of Darkness, Erikson's prequel and then the inevitable re-read of the main series which frankly is as good in a different way as reading it for the first time."
Malazan,2z92tv,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Mon Mar 16 18:58:16 2015 UTC,"If you don't understand something, go to the left side of the page here and to the TOR rereads or goodreads forum, where chapters are summarized and discussed :)"
Malazan,2zaq10,Nichase,2,Tue Mar 17 00:43:04 2015 UTC,"People are divided on the ICE series. I thought it was just ok in terms of the writing quality, but I love it for expanding on the Malazan universe. I would encourage you to read it. Don't be too detracted by people talking bad about ICE's writing.   FoD is also amazing for expanding your knowledge of the world of Malazan, and it's a very interesting look at the early lives of some of the more ""epic"" side characters. I really enjoyed it.   Haven't read the novellas yet, as I wasn't too find of Bauchelain and Broach, but I've heard good things about the books."
Malazan,2zaq10,Zingbrit,1 point,Tue Mar 17 04:38:24 2015 UTC,Would you say that they're alright to read by themselves (ie without the Malazan series clearly in mind) or should I save them for when I'm rereading?
Malazan,2zaq10,Zingbrit,1 point,Thu Mar 19 19:51:22 2015 UTC,"I read them pretty much right after finishing BotF, but you should be fine reading them on their own. Their isn't too much crossover of plot/characters, and what there is is fairly major, so you won't have forgotten.   And a lot of people suggest integrating them into a reread, but I liked reading them separately, otherwise I probably would have forgotten what was going on with ICE's characters and whatnot. But it's up to you. If you find ICE's writing unpalatable you may want to read some of Eriksons books to break it up."
Malazan,2zaq10,Tumblehawk,2,Thu Mar 19 23:53:11 2015 UTC,"My ICE experience, this far:  Night of Knives - ehhh...but enjoyable. RotCG - bloated...a real slog at times...but parts just totally awesome. A couple storylines completely unnecessary though.  Now I'm 80% into Stonewielder and man oh man...it is So. Goddamn. Good."
Malazan,2zaq10,mr_me100,1 point,Wed Mar 18 15:13:41 2015 UTC,"I wasn't a big fan of the first book by Ian C Esselmont but I did start to enjoy his books halfway through the second one. Currently reading Stonewielder, almost done, very enjoyable."
Malazan,2zaq10,strawberrysundaeandt,1 point,Tue Mar 17 12:27:40 2015 UTC,"I'm still reading the ICE series. I loved Stonewielder a lot & am enjoying Orb, Sceptre, Throne. Didn't like the first one but the second was okay.   I had a hard time with Forge of Darkness because I only liked a few characters and it had less humor than the main series. On the other hand it's great at depicting cultures in conflict so I'll read Fall of Light when it arrives."

Malazan,2z2rkw,Iliad_Keys,18,Sun Mar 15 00:53:44 2015 UTC,"Malazan has been the most recent ""big"" fantasy series I've read that is finished.  It definitely is the most complex straight up epic fantasy series I have ever read. It has become my favorite fantasy series. It doesent mean however that all other fantasy books I previously read pale in comparison.   I love all the books below for different reasons. None are perfect, including Malazan, all have their strengths and their weaknesses. Some fantasy books are more philosophical but tend to be slow reads. (New Sun) Some have different ways of writing action sequences that you can picture clearly as if you were watching a movie (First Law) , others spend three paragraphs on an important battle and five pages describing the trees. (Tolkien) Some have the most well developed characters you'll ever read, (Martin) and in some, nothing but cliches (Shannara).  In most the world building is amazing (Prince of Nothing) but sometimes plot, not so much. All my examples above are books I love for one reason or another, despite any flaws I can see after years of reading fantasy and understanding various tropes and such.   For me, Malazan somehow combines it all, great world building, crazy-connected plot lines, amazing action, makes-you-think-philosophy, and wonderfully grey characters who are just people, flawed or noble, Ascendant or mortal alike. And as a plus it tickles my nostalgia for the great D&D campaigns of when I was a kid, reading Tolkien and Terry Brooks and Dragonlance that got me into the fantasy genre in the first place.   Some of my faves over the years:  Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkien  Kingkiller Chronicles by Patrick Rothfuss  Chronicles of Thomas Covenant by Stephan Donaldson  Long Price Quartet by Daniel Abraham  Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe  Gormenghast by Mervyn Peake  Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson  Mistborn series by Brandon Sanderson  Prince of Nothng series by R Scott Bakker  Elric Saga by Michael Moorcock  Earthsea by Ursula   Legend of Drizzt by R.A. Salvatore  Death Gate Cycle by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman (Also their Chronicles and Legends Dragonlance series)   First Law Trilogy by Joe Abercrombie  Night Angel trilogy by Brent Weeks  Dragonbone Chair by Tad Williams  Dresden Files by Jim Butcher   Shannara series by Terry Brooks   Wizards First Rule by Terry Goodkind (loved this series when I was younger, upon rereading it is DEEPLY flawed however in my opinion)   Runelords series by David Farland   Magician series by Raymond Feist   Assassin series by Robin Hobb   Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch   Game of Thrones by George Martin   Black Company by Glen Cook  Nine Princes In Amber by Roger Zelazny   Belgariad/Mallorean series by David Eddings   Acts of Caine by Mathew Stover (sort of a scifi/fantasy hybrid, very unique series with a great premise, as gory as Abercrombie, badass hero and villian, great action and intricate plot.)  Sorry to gush, OP's question just got me typing.   TLDR: Malazan FTW"
Malazan,2z2rkw,TriscuitCracker,2,Sun Mar 15 01:50:53 2015 UTC,"Belgariad/Mallorean series by David Eddings   I just wanted to say that while Eddings hits every stereotype while using every trope you can imagine in a fantasy book, his sense of humour is like none other.  The Belgariad and Mallorean are two of my favourite series and just so damn funny."
Malazan,2z2rkw,Montaron87,2,Sun Mar 15 20:33:10 2015 UTC,"Ah, i remember back in my 6th grade summer, my mom brought me home a copy of Pawn of Prophecy. Over the next two years I would read everything fantasy that Eddings wrote at least thrice. As tropey as Belgariad/Mallorean (also the Elenium and Tamuli books) were, I still love them for the nostalgia and, yes, the hilarious and quirky conversations. Not to mention that the world Eddings built was very well done, albeit a bit simplistic."
Malazan,2z2rkw,Tsarface,5,Mon Mar 16 16:01:06 2015 UTC,"I look for fantasy series that has over 10 books just so it lasts a long time. Tolkien was great for sure. I essentially started with Robert Jordan's WoT, it's what got me going for fantasy 15 years ago. I then moved on to Terry Goodkind's SoT series, which I now realize is pretty poorly written after moving on to GRRM and Erikson. I read ASOIAF years and years ago but I find a lot of the new fan base really annoying so I tend to stay way from the subreddit (they annoy me because they think waiting 2 years for the next ASOIAF book is a long time).   After these, I really got into Glen Cook's Black Company which eventually led me to Erikson. I liked Black Company but the early books are written a little poorly in my opinion. However, that could of just been me getting used to the way it was written (POV/past tense).   I discovered MBotF after all these and I'm pretty sure it has the best characters that I've ever read in fantasy, especially the marines. There are some plots that I could of done without but it's one of my favorite series now.  I hear Sanderson is good as well. Only thing I read from him is how he ended the WoT. Didn't care for how he dealt with some of the characters in it but I respect him for giving me some sort of closure after Jordan's unfortunate passing. I hear his Mistborn trilogies are good so after I get around to Assail I might jump on to that."
Malazan,2z2rkw,Brys_Beddict,1 point,Sun Mar 15 17:37:48 2015 UTC,"I tried getting into Glenn Cook years ago, but didn't get too far. I'll have to look into it again.    The first Mistborn book by Sanderson was good, neat inventive magic system, and interesting storyline. I tried 2 times to get into the second book in the trilogy, but failed to finish it both times. I think Sanderson, at least in Mistborn, but also in Elantris, has a much less refined writing style, almost as if it was intended for a YA audience, which perhaps it was. It was the writing style more than the story itself that turned me off of Sanderson, BYMMV."
Malazan,2z2rkw,herffjones99,1 point,Sun Mar 15 20:31:42 2015 UTC,"I really like Glenn Cook's work. It's not perfect, but the first Black Company series is one of my favorites.  I had the same complaint about Mistborn. I'm glad I finished it, but I really like Way of Kings better."
Malazan,2z2rkw,drae-,1 point,Mon Mar 16 02:11:22 2015 UTC,"I had this same issue with Mistborn, just felt kinda.. not verbose? Dumbed down? Written for YA seems an apt description.  Personally I enjoyed the Black Company, darker, grittier, like low fantasy with high fantasy elements. I liked it. Only the original series was greally good though, the rest I found I could do without."
Malazan,2z2rkw,Tsarface,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:08:29 2015 UTC,"Haha, I called the follow-up books when referencing them to my cousin (who I exchange/borrow books with frequently) ""The Black Company Goes to India"". Because thats sadly all it is. Although they deviate from the real grittiness of the original trilogy, I still think they were great reads, just waaaaay different."
Malazan,2z2rkw,shekkie,1 point,Mon Mar 16 16:03:28 2015 UTC,"An ""apt"" description? Nice Malazan pun."
Malazan,2z2rkw,mmSNAKE,1 point,Mon Mar 16 21:03:05 2015 UTC,In my head the voices of Croaker and Fiddler are very similar. That they had a character named Crokus in GoTM made it even weirder.
Malazan,2z2rkw,BlackViperMWG,3,Mon Mar 16 18:36:00 2015 UTC,"The list is too long to put up. I have a document that keeps track of this since I can't be bothered to commit it to memory.   I'd say Malazan is easily my top read. It profoundly affected my thought process (as much as any philosophy book I've read), it opened my eyes to many different themes, expectations, behavior and stories.  While the number of authors and books I like is immense, the stuff that is most similar to Malazan in regard to having a huge impact on me in a similar way, I can narrow it down to few others.  R.Scott Bakker and his Second Apocalypse. A deep thought provoking story that parallels a great deal of the real world into it's fantastical grim setting.  Glen Cook, his Black Company series. It goes over a great deal of things Malazan does, actions, morality, violence, soldiers and so on. It is evident why these books were a part of inspiration for Malazan.  Matthew Woodring Stover, in particular his Acts of Caine. These books also had a massive impact on my thought process, take on violence and discovering myself more in it than necessarily exploring the characters, which are just fantastic. For better of for worse I share a great deal of head space with Caine.  Mark Lawrence, Broken Empire. Not so much for redemption, or justification, but more of a cautionary tale to how one's actions aren't the sole responsibility of the will of that person, that environment, and experiences forced onto the individual are just as pertinent to what kind of monster you cook up.  There are a lot of other books I love for different reasons. I can easily say Dresden Files are my #2 read after The Malazan Book of the Fallen, but the reason I like those is  completely different."
Malazan,2z2rkw,uncreative_canadian,1 point,Sun Mar 15 18:50:12 2015 UTC,"Goodkind, Sanderson, Cook, Rothfuss, Ryan, Sapkowski, Heitz... but yeah, after second or third reading of MBotF other books are not that good, not that complex and without the potential to reread."
Malazan,2z2rkw,KrugSmash,1 point,Sun Mar 15 11:56:51 2015 UTC,"I haven't read as much as other posters, but I likewise started with Terry Brooks shannara series until getting bored with the rehashed ""druid tell an ohmsford to find elf stones and stop bad guy"" formula.   I thought that meant I was bored with fantasy and went on to read autobiographies and such for a while until my brother suggested Glen Cooks Black Company series, which sucked me back in. I've now read all those plus MBotF and am currently reading Esselmont.  So, I'd suggest reading Glen Cooks. Doesn't build a world like the Malazan series does does a great job of realistic/gritty front line soldiers POV. Really enjoyable."
Malazan,2z2rkw,KrugSmash,1 point,Sun Mar 15 14:07:37 2015 UTC,"I started with  Stephen King's The Dark Tower.  Next was The Wheel of Time, by Robert Jordan, and from then on I was hooked on fantasy.  I timed that read really well.  I finished Towers of Midnight about two weeks before A Memory of Light released.  After that I read The Dresden Files, by Jim Butcher.  I love that series, and cannot wait for Peace Talks.  I also loved the Furies of Calderon.  Then there's Glen Cook and the Black Company.  And finally Brandon Sanderson.  This man is my god.  I will read anything that he writes."
Malazan,2z2rkw,Tsarface,2,Sun Mar 15 22:25:47 2015 UTC,Great! But where is our beloved Eriksson in the mix?

Malazan,2z2rkw,Rogosh,1 point,Mon Mar 16 01:06:28 2015 UTC,"While the Furies books definitely had a YA feel to them, I'm wholly in agreement with you. I read the first one and couldn't put them down. I think I finished the entire series in like 1.5 weeks."
Malazan,2z2rkw,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Mon Mar 16 16:05:37 2015 UTC,Yup.  I'm looking forward to The Cinder Spires too!

Brett's the Demon Cycle, Django Wexler's the Shadow Campaigns and Brian McClellan's Powder mage triology.  Both Wexler and McClellan are flint-lock fantasy something I have recently started to enjoy. Brett's unique plot and magic are a fun read set in a fantasy world with pseudo Arabian and  pseudo European ties."
Malazan,2z10z9,letsbeaun,12,Sat Mar 14 15:58:19 2015 UTC,"Glad you like it! I loved Tehol and Bugg and the relationships between Trull and his bro's. Poor Rhulad. Did you like Brys?  As far as I know the owl has no real significance, just cool imagery. You don't need to know what island the poor are going too, it's not important:  As to why Mael has Gothos freeze Letheras there are a few theories that have been floating around:  1: He wanted the Andii and Edur preserved as some colossal monument to something.   The amount of death there, without a Hold of Death, would create so many ghosts/undead/specterly figures etc, it would render Lether uninhabitable or not a good place to be, so Mael knew if Gothos froze everything, it would unfreeze by the time a Hold/house of Death would exist, and be able to take the souls of the dead. There was some kind of other power that wanted to do something with that site/its bodies etc, and Mael needed to stop it, but knew that destruction was not the way to go, so chose preservation. Mael wanted Gothos to get the Finnest, but could not make sure Kilmandaros didn't get it and he did not incur her wrath unless he made that deal.   Now you're back to the Malazans. Bonehunters  is amazing, it's when it all starts to come together, multiple plot lines from all the past books start to slowly weave together for the next few books to ultimately converge in the Crippled God. You're halfway there!  Also, in Bonehunters, prepare to sweat. You'll see what I mean."
Malazan,2z10z9,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Sat Mar 14 16:44:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah I liked Brys a lot, why did he have to drink from the wine glass at the end!? That reminds me, the Errant. What's up with this guy, I'm not sure if he's good or bad, Mael seems to know him and not have a problem with him. I guess we'll see. I just remembered some questions I had on holds. So we find out who the errant is. Do we know who the other fulcra are or who important people in the holds are. I understand Udinaas must be the wyval, am I supposed to know anyone else who has a title in the holds?"
Malazan,2z10z9,JebusGobson,2,Sat Mar 14 19:11:29 2015 UTC,"That reminds me, the Errant. What's up with this guy, I'm not sure if he's good or bad,   He's supposed to be neither - but it's hard to stay on the sidelines."
Malazan,2z10z9,pruzzante,1 point,Mon Mar 16 07:51:02 2015 UTC,"I'm currently on my first read through as well, but my understanding was that the Errant is to the Holds what Oponn is to the Houses - an unaligned god of chance/luck."

Malazan,2z10z9,KrugSmash,1 point,Sun Mar 15 00:12:20 2015 UTC,I thought the owl symbolized the Errant?
Malazan,2z10z9,Foliagus,8,Sun Mar 15 23:14:45 2015 UTC,"They ate crap food because they had this ""poor"" mentality. Tehol supposedly had no money.  Bugg figured out it was an illusion, and poked his fingers into the illusory head. :).    He froze the battlefield to preserve souls, iirc. And stop the edur from just walking over the world. I'm hesitant on this, someone else can explain better."
Malazan,2z10z9,KrugSmash,2,Sat Mar 14 16:10:22 2015 UTC,Cool thanks that clears up a lot!
Malazan,2z10z9,JebusGobson,5,Sat Mar 14 16:15:42 2015 UTC,"To clarify the first statement; Yes they had a ""poor"" mentality and ate crap food, but Bugg is a god, so the food that he served was more than sufficient to sustain a mortal.  He is one hell of a manservant."
Malazan,2z10z9,Obiwontaun,2,Sun Mar 15 23:12:14 2015 UTC,Lol yeah I was confused how they were actually gaining sustenance from eating stuff like boiled shoes
Malazan,2z10z9,KrugSmash,2,Sun Mar 15 23:43:58 2015 UTC,I think they did it to put up an elaborate show about how poor they were so people didn't catch on to their conspiracy. Same with the shoddy clothes etc.

Malazan,2z216p,Katoneo,2,Sat Mar 14 21:01:12 2015 UTC,"Although a lot of what happens at the end of the book doesn't make total sense until later, TtH was my least favourite book in the series mainly due to the stylistic shift.  I still enjoyed all the plotlines and characters we are all familiar with, I just felt the Erikson took an unusually long amount of time (even for him) to advance the narrative.  The Andii storyline suffers the worst from this, along with the interminable bullshit between Crokus/Cutter and Challice, but like I said, I still loved the characters.   With that said, the last scene in the book (Harrlo/Stonny) absolutely destroyed me.  For me that's one of the most emotional scenes in the whole series."
Malazan,2z216p,pfk505,3,Sun Mar 15 00:40:00 2015 UTC,"She was not sealed in the cart. The cart help the Gate of Darkness. Rake's death forced MD into action.  I think her power was so small due to the lack of worship that this was the only influence she could do. He fought Rake because he was blinded by anger. He was minutes from finally getting his revenge and Rake took it from him. That's how I took it anyway. I think if he wanted to lose he would have.   As for TTH, I had a lot of trouble with it too. In the end, it goes by what you like to read about. It was very philosophical which I personally don't like. Couldn't really get into Nimander's group or the Black Coral stuff. The last 200 pages are great but yeah, by no means is this my favorite book.  I'm not saying I don't get why people have it as their No. 1 in the series, but parts of it were just not interesting to me personally."
Malazan,2z216p,SerBronnofBlackwater,1 point,Sat Mar 14 21:12:19 2015 UTC,"1.)When Annomander took the blood of the elient, and became soletaken, Mother dark turned her back on the tistii.  the gate to the realm of darkness was on the wagon, and soon to be destroyed by chaos.  Theres no telling what this would have done to MD, but it probably wouldnt have been good.  Rake sacrificing himself to free the gate, made MD come back to the tistii, and so she possed arantha to help nimmander.  2.) daseem had to kill rake to get dragnipur, so that he could get to hood to have his revenge."
Malazan,2z216p,Gaebryal,1 point,Tue Mar 17 16:53:51 2015 UTC,"TtH was a general disappointment for me, to the point that it made quit the series, i wrote a post here about that  like a week ago, i agree with all that you say, the book is full of garbage chapters and the fight between Rake and Dassem doesn't make sense, why Rake wanted to be killed by Dassem , he could commit suicide with Dragnipur end get trapped within the sword, i don't think that the sword have a clause that you canot ""enter its world"" if you kill yourself with the sword."

Malazan,2z216p,Morph19_,1 point,Sun Mar 15 01:05:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that`s the most arguable moment. I quess it was a part of deal between Hood and Rake. Hood knew that Dassem haunts him, and because he planned come back after Dragnipur event he wanted to get rid of Dassem. Then Rake take Dassem vengeance on himself."
Malazan,2z216p,Desolaice,1 point,Sun Mar 15 01:39:30 2015 UTC,"My theory is mainly pure conjecture, but I think it also may have to do something with the sword Dassem is wielding, rake's old sword Vengence/Grief.  It basically has two modes, (this may be spoilerish from FoD but I recall it also being explained in MT/RG.) Vengeance and Grief.  The mode depends on the wielder, and Vengeance mode has the tendency to spill innocent blood, Rake's.  His death ultimately could be seen as a way to change the sword to Grief, which does not have the same unfortunate tendency, which is important in one the ICE book OST which I won't spoiler.  Anyway thats just my theory."
Malazan,2z216p,quadtard,1 point,Mon Mar 16 13:27:34 2015 UTC,"the ""magic"" of the sword is its an insane hust sword with its ""tongue"" removed so it cant make the laughter sound like other husts.  Also its said that as long as the will of the user never breaks, neither will the sword.    so you put dassem behind it with an immovable will, and its an amazing weapon."
Malazan,2z216p,Gaebryal,1 point,Tue Mar 17 17:01:15 2015 UTC,"because there was no telling who would end up with dragnipur, he needed to make sure it ended up in the right hands.  Dassem is someone who could use it, and would use it for good reasons, at least untill he found a way to break it, which might take a while.  i think the plan was hood enters dragnipur so that his army can find it.  hoods army kills all the bad monsters, or causes them to die in chaos, then rake enters and frees all the good guys, and the gate, which is going to be destroyed by chaos eventually, since it cant wander freely."
Malazan,2yz8rx,Iliad_Keys,12,Sat Mar 14 02:04:43 2015 UTC,"Most of your questions will be explained. Anything said here can't help but teeter on the border of spoilers, where one wrong word sends it over the line.   In regards to your one complaint though: It is important to know that originally Mr. Erickson intended to release Memories of Ice as the direct sequel to Gardens of the Moon and then go on to Deadhouse Gates. However, having completed (or mostly completed) the first writing of Memories, he then lost the manuscript in a hard-drive crash.  Not being able to bring himself to start all over again right away, he instead went ahead and completed Deadhouse, and rewrote Memories afterwards.   The events in Deadhouse Gates and Memories of Ice are mostly going on at the same time. When you read Memories, most of your complaint will be resolved."
Malazan,2yz8rx,Dwolf63,5,Sat Mar 14 02:17:19 2015 UTC,This is really the only answer. The one thing that won't spoiler to much is if we talk about that bag. Wasn't the bag just a small fragment of warren unto itself essentially an enchanted item?
Malazan,2yz8rx,gathmoon,3,Sat Mar 14 03:36:04 2015 UTC,"I guess we won't never know for sure. But if Mappo said witches of his tribe enchanted piece of warren to his bag, it surely is that way."

Malazan,2yz8rx,Ry9012,6,Tue Mar 31 06:16:06 2015 UTC,"Without spoiling anything, what exactly IS the power of the Jahg/Jahgut? In the first book everyone was freaked OUT about the return of the Jaghut Tyrant, and he pretty much had godlike power and tore open the land and wrecked half Darujistan. I was led to believe they were an extremely rare if not extinct founding race.    The Jaghut are pretty rare, but not extinct. Tyrants are even more rare because most Jaghut aren't interested in dominating things. The Jaghut have their own Elder Warren, which allows them to do some pretty powerful magic. Like any of the other races, power and ability vary between individuals. For example, Anomander Rake is far more destructive and powerful using Kurald Galain than almost any of the other Tiste Andii serving under him.   And HERE we have Icarium walking around, a half Jahgut (do we ever know the other half?) and people are just cool with it. Not to MENTION his father Gothos just chillin' in Deadhouse RIGHT IN THE HEART OF MALAZ CITY and nobody knows?? I thought these creatures were pretty much the Titans/Olympians of this world.   You'll have to read more to learn about Icarium. You'll learn his other half and what's going on with him. If you think back to Mappo's parts, you can probably piece together why Icarium is left to roam free. Also, I'm not sure how many people are aware of where Gothos is chilling. Most people, with some exceptions, avoid the Azath houses if they can because they are capable of taking and imprisoning them forever."
Malazan,2yz8rx,majiinbuu,3,Sat Mar 14 03:50:21 2015 UTC,"One other comment, I read on a discussion on goodreads, and agree, that the beginning of the book seemed a bit Anti Empire and the end a bit pro Empire. It's interesting to see how SE has managed to  keep the central power structure a morally ambiguous force. Is the empire good or bad? Different characters all have different opinions."
Malazan,2yz8rx,gathmoon,3,Sat Mar 14 13:25:45 2015 UTC,Return of the crimson guard clarified a lot of this for me

Malazan,2yz8rx,majiinbuu,3,Sat Mar 14 18:45:23 2015 UTC,"At the start of the book there's also a comment from mappo to icarium stating ""Your dye is running"" hence they were disguised, mappo and icarium are quite a fearsome duo so most people will avoid them take for example the d'ivers and the soletaken who come across them don't want to test icarium's patience. It's mainly RAFO though. Enjoy!"
Malazan,2yz8rx,SageOfTheWise,2,Sun Mar 15 15:22:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks all for your replies. One OTHER question I had: At the beginning of the book there is a near slaughter in a market by I think the Red Blades, and it is stopped by Coltain. Duiker witnesses this.    BUT one of Duiker's last conversations in the book he's talking with someone about the situation in the empire, and I think he mentions how the Red Blades are the most loyal soldiers of the empire. Anybody remember this? Seems a contradiction."
Malazan,2yz8rx,Aiolus,6,Sat Mar 14 13:17:21 2015 UTC,"I think it's more that they're fanatically loyal to the Empire, rather than them trying to intentionally sabotage things. An example from DHG, the woman tailing Kalam has everyone killed in that garrison Kalam visits. She does this because she suspects they are aiding the rebellion because Kalam is carrying that book. I think the fanatiscm comes from them being recruits from Seven Cities. Seven Cities seems to be a breeding ground for it."
Malazan,2yz8rx,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Sat Mar 14 14:10:27 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, thanks. The slaughter at Aren also demonstrated the fanatical discipline of the malazan army in the opposite direction, passive or aggressive the main thing is they are conditioned to OBEY"
Malazan,2yz8rx,Hhhaamuus,2,Sat Mar 14 18:22:37 2015 UTC,"To answer your last one, keep in mind that just because a race isn't human, doesn't make it homogenous. Just because one Jaghut is all powerful evil Tyrant, doesn't mean they all are. And like you said, nobody knows about Gothos, so how can they freak out about him? I mean really same with Icarium, he's not exactly advertising himself to the world."

Can't spoil you on Brys and the Guardian. Keep reading!  And unfortunately I can't remember on the Kruppe spy.    After this you get to Bonehunters, (back to the Malazans) and all the major subplots across all previous five books and continents start to slowly weave together for an epic Convergence in the Crippled God."
Malazan,2ysplw,TriscuitCracker,5,Thu Mar 12 16:00:47 2015 UTC,"Circle Breaker sadly doesn't return in the series, no. At least, not that we know of. I guess he could have appeared again under another guise and another name.  Midnight Tides is like reading a new series entirely for a while, but then once you adjust to the change in scenery it's every bit as good as the Malazan stuff. Tehol and Bugg alone make that entire novel worth reading. All the other dope shit that goes down is just sprinkles on the gravy cake."
Malazan,2ysplw,ThunderfuckTheViking,2,Thu Mar 12 23:20:24 2015 UTC,I think it's a good thing Circle Breaker stays gone. He's gone on happy retirement!

Malazan,2ysplw,Morph19_,1 point,Thu Mar 12 17:01:58 2015 UTC,"Man, I'm on my first re-read and looking forward to getting to the MT/Trull/Brys story lines as I really struggled to read that book the first time around.   You will love The Bonehunters and I'm you're in for more of a treat with The crippled god, great finale."
Malazan,2ysnj2,Randomonous,11,Thu Mar 12 14:14:53 2015 UTC,"That part was incredible. The stand at Lightfall was pretty incredible in and of itself, and one of my absolute favorite characters in the series straight-up does the coolest shit at its conclusion.  I got chills just remembering the chills I got when I first read it!  But seriously though: I basically considered that book Erikson's reward to the reader for all of the sadness Dust of Dreams pours on you."
Malazan,2ysnj2,titanemesis,5,Thu Mar 12 14:25:19 2015 UTC,"Hetan was the first part in a book that made me put it down, resist tears, and take deep breaths."
Malazan,2ysnj2,Foliagus,6,Thu Mar 12 16:07:43 2015 UTC,"Seriously. Considering how amazing her character was Memories of Ice, that entire episode was really rough to read. The 'hobbling' was brutal."
Malazan,2ysnj2,titanemesis,8,Thu Mar 12 17:25:12 2015 UTC,"I remember not liking the Shake storyline, then reading the epicness at the light wall completely turned that around. On my first reread of the Crippled God and I like it so much better. How does Yedan Derryg stack up against other fighter characters in this series do you think? Could he beat Karsa? Brys? Segulah?"
Malazan,2ysnj2,TriscuitCracker,6,Thu Mar 12 14:57:08 2015 UTC,"I'm imagining Yedan as equivalent to a high ranking Seguleh and also Brys, around top 20 of the Seguleh if I had to pick a number.    But towards the end of the battle at Lightfall, it seems like a lot of his combat is being helped tremendously by his Hust-sword."
Malazan,2ysnj2,pfk505,5,Thu Mar 12 18:29:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah the whole Shake storyline was really just fantastic,  what a payoff!  I had goosebumps reading Spinnock Durav's speech, and pretty much every key Shake death hit me pretty hard.  I'm about 80% done with the book and its moments like this just one after the other."
Malazan,2ysnj2,seanms31,4,Thu Mar 12 14:59:21 2015 UTC,"I was kind of bored with the Shake story (I don't tend to think ahead a whole lot when I read, I'm a then and there kind of guy), so I really didn't see the payoff coming.  A Tiste Andii finding a real purpose, a true cause of their own, would be a thing to behold."

Malazan,2yph0x,Rhinomeat,7,Wed Mar 11 22:35:40 2015 UTC,"Speaking as someone who's just begun the series (1/4 into dead house gates) I must say I have to tread very lightly in and around this sub. One minute I'll be mindlessly scrolling through my custom front page, and then boom, something about a character I've only just been introduced to is getting discussed. Considering unsubbing until I've finished the series... It worked fine with the ASOIAF sub"
Malazan,2yph0x,CapytannHook,1 point,Thu Mar 12 04:06:39 2015 UTC,Yeah man save the subreddit for re reads or for self posts explicitly stating your spoiler scope if you have questions.
Malazan,2yph0x,verheyen,3,Fri Mar 13 23:42:02 2015 UTC,"Personally, the issue for me hasn't been spoilers in post titles so much as posts without a clear spoiler scope.  For instance, I had a character's death spoiled for me in this thread (although I do want to note that as soon as I asked the commenter to mark his spoilers, he did so with alacrity) and I think that perhaps if every post was required to have a clear scope in the title (as is the case on /r/asoiaf, for instance) the whole situation probably could have been avoided.    Granted, I'm fairly new to this sub, and if a relatively lax spoiler policy is what the majority and moderation team prefers that is just fine.  But I think if people got into the habit of marking spoilers as a matter of course (unless the title of the post indicated ""Spoilers all"", ""Series Spoilers"", or something of that nature) and mods instituted and enforced a policy of mandatory spoiler scope in post titles, it might save new readers some heartbreak."
Malazan,2yph0x,internet_enthusiast,2,Thu Mar 12 18:49:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, I got too much shit spoiled from titles already."
Malazan,2yph0x,bantuftw,1 point,Thu Mar 12 17:45:54 2015 UTC,"This sub is generally quite conscientious about spoilers, and polices itself quite well. I don't think it's a bad idea, but I also don't know that it's necessary."
Malazan,2yph0x,lykideus,6,Wed Mar 11 19:03:12 2015 UTC,Na I think it's necessary sometimes after 15+ books you don't even know the titles or that you're spoiling.
Malazan,2yph0x,Landmarkmoon,1 point,Wed Mar 11 19:12:24 2015 UTC,"But will a post saying ""careful with spoilers"" really help that? You still won't know you're spoiling."
Malazan,2yph0x,lykideus,1 point,Wed Mar 11 19:34:48 2015 UTC,But knowing you may spoil something will make you think harder.
Malazan,2yph0x,verheyen,5,Fri Mar 13 23:58:09 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree here.  I posted a comment in another thread requested more moderation around thread titles. The comments seemed to generally agree with me, but no mod stepped in to even participate in the discussion."
Malazan,2yph0x,linuxcloud,8,Wed Mar 11 19:48:28 2015 UTC,"Thread titles are what concern(ed) me the most and spurred the making of this post. Once you click into a post that's marked as containing spoilers, all bets are off. But titles themselves give away so much so often. And when working with authors like SE and ICE who are so masterful at withholding information and then unfurling it so beautifully, well, it's a shame to have things spoiled."
Malazan,2yph0x,burningsky25,5,Wed Mar 11 20:26:19 2015 UTC,"If nothing else some clarification of spoilers in titles would be nice, it's nice to be specific of what or whom the topic is about but too often the inflection reveals a lot of what the fate of the character is.  The text on the side doesn't say much about limiting information in titles."
Malazan,2yph0x,burningsky25,1 point,Wed Mar 11 21:14:47 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing.  Sad things happen to people in this series that do not include death.  In fact, something extremely sad happens to pretty much every single character.  It's one of the hallmarks of the series.  Saying ""Poor <X>"" doesn't mean that person dies, and jumping to that conclusion is your own prejudice at work.  Saying ""<X> in book <Y>"" doesn't even mean someone survives until that book, simply that something about that character may have been referenced.  Again, this is something that happens frequently in this series.  Lastly, given the nature of Ascendancy, even outright saying someone dies doesn't really mean a damned thing in this series.  This was discussed a long time ago, and we decided that as long as it's kept vague it isn't an issue.  Setting your assumptions aside, can you point to 1 instance where:   titles themselves give away so much   Sorry if I sound a bit snarky here, but I've got a guy that didn't file a report, or send a modmail, hell from the link he set he didn't even mention the moderators; and he's saying he asked for us, but we refused to respond.  That pisses me off, more than a little bit.  If I didn't respond to a request, call me on it.  Claiming I didn't respond to a phantom request is a different matter entirely."
Malazan,2yph0x,linuxcloud,4,Thu Mar 12 05:42:33 2015 UTC,"I don't see how this doesn't fall under the same category as ""If someone replies to a post, asking you to mark something as a spoiler, then edit your post and mark it as a spoiler. Even if you don't think it is a spoiler. Obviously, someone else does, and we aren't here to ruin anyone's enjoyment of the series."" - from the sidebar.   Lastly, given the nature of Ascendancy, even outright saying   someone dies doesn't really mean a damned thing in this series.   Ok, well I'm pretty sure saying someone dies is not the only form of a spoiler, it's anything that reveals future events!  Just because someone dies but is present later through ascendancy in no way makes it any less of a spoiler.  Just saying that titles could on some occasions be improved upon.  Inflection gives a lot away in a title.  No reason not too keep them more factual and simple, even elusive, especially when they reference events that are rather pivotal."
Malazan,2yph0x,NoFortress,1 point,Thu Mar 12 15:50:01 2015 UTC,"This was discussed a long time ago, and we decided that as long as it's kept vague it isn't an issue.   Right, well I just linked you to another thread where people obviously disagreed, and your counterpoint is essentially saying ""I don't care"".  The thread was about Whiskeyjack and the most highly upvoted comment was one saying that people should be more careful about how they word thread titles. I'm not sure what more evidence you need. Several anecdotes are provided in that thread for implied spoilers.   Sorry if I sound a bit snarky here, but I've got a guy that didn't file a report, or send a modmail, hell from the link he set he didn't even mention the moderators; and he's saying he asked for us, but we refused to respond.

Actually, I stated that no mod ""participated in the discussion"". Perhaps I have an unrealistic expectation that a subreddit with four mods that sees about the same number of new threads per day should do some level of participation on a large moderation-related discussion without having to go around reporting users."
Malazan,2yph0x,linuxcloud,-4,Thu Mar 12 11:51:07 2015 UTC,"the most highly upvoted comment   Yes.  13 whole people out of the 3,540 people subscribed to this sub.  Clearly a majority.   your counterpoint is essentially saying ""I don't care"".   We need to work on your reading comprehension.  My response had nothing to do with ""I don't care"".  My response had to do with you not pulling moderator attention to a conversation you thought we should notice.  At no point did I say, hint at, or paraphrase anything resembling ""I don't care"".   Several anecdotes are provided in that thread for implied spoilers.   Every single one of those anecdotes is filled with assumptions.  I provided a specific scenario that shows exactly what I'm talking about.  Simply mentioning Whiskeyjack and MoI doesn't tell you anything other than that Whiskeyjack is mentioned in MoI.   Actually, I stated that no mod ""participated in the discussion""   requested more moderation around thread titles. but no mod stepped in to even participate in the discussion.    Those statements don't seem to be saying the same thing.   Perhaps I have an unrealistic expectation   Perhaps you do, at that.  1 of those mods doesn't do any actual moderation.  He's there simply for when someone asks us to add something.  1 of the mods isn't around for a little while.  Even if all 4 of us were constantly here to moderate, this is something we do as volunteers when we have time to be on Reddit.  Because you got into a conversation after a mod (me, in this case) had already read through and commented in the thread, is no reason for you expect we'll be back without someone saying something directly to us."

Those guys are getting paid, and they're most likely going to get belligerent. Accuse me of ignoring you when I had already been through the thread and you didn't even reference the mods, much less mark spam or send modmail, and it'll piss me off every time."
Malazan,2yph0x,verheyen,2,Fri Mar 13 01:34:48 2015 UTC,"First, I just wanna say I appreciate all the work that goes into moderation on the internet. I was a moderator of multiple forums on a highly trafficked message board years ago and I know it's often thankless. But I also just want to point out that your post in this thread is the only one downvoted into the negative zone, and that's because you're being totally condescending and aggressive and I don't really understand why. This is a reasonable conversation that's happening here, and getting angry seems a pretty irrational response."
Malazan,2yph0x,Giotto,0,Thu Mar 12 20:04:42 2015 UTC,"I've explained why I was angry. The conversation happened after I came through the thread, so I didn't see it. It's as simple as that. If someone asked for me in a way that would notify me, like sending modmail, then he would have been totally legit calling me out. As it stands, he says he asked for me, and I didn't respond, which is a falsehood.   He didn't even ask for mods in the discussion, which he linked."
Malazan,2yph0x,MoranthMunitions,3,Fri Mar 13 01:28:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, you have made it perfectly clear that you are angry. Multiple times. I have apologized for the confusion caused by my wording. Yet you still seem hung up on trying to justify your anger.  We get it. You're angry.  Now can you please put on your objective, moderator pants and actually respond to the concern raised in this thread rather than repeatedly point out how angry you are? There are multiple users in this thread (and the other I linked to) that have expressed a desire to have more rules about the wording of thread titles. The consensus seems clear to me. I know I would personally, as a first-time reader, appreciate effort to word thread titles more neutrally.  To your point about tragic events occurring other than death: I completely agree with you. However, even the implication that tragic event occurs to a character is a spoiler to me. That said, I see a lot of posts in this sub of the format ""Poor <character>"" and every single time that character has died later on in the books. I know that death is not absolute in this series, and there are probably more tragic and shocking sequences than character deaths. However, I want to be able to come here to discuss one of the books I've just finished (which I've done several times) without potentially being exposed to a thread title that implies something tragic."
Malazan,2yls57,JediMasterZao,14,Tue Mar 10 21:26:33 2015 UTC,"Spoiler  If you think about it, what Steven did was write that sometimes shit happens to people, and not all of them rise up above it to become heroes. The title of the books are apt. It is a tradegy, and what happens to both her adoptive mother, and to herself, as well as by proxy to Tavore though she doesnt know it, is imho the saddest most tragic things to happen in the entire series. All the effort put in to save Felisin younger, the adoption, the healing etc, and all Tavores efforts for her sisters sake. - Went well didnt it?"
Malazan,2yls57,Silmariel,2,Tue Mar 10 22:05:00 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with your point, i was absolutely struck when i started realizing exactly who Tavore was about to kill and just how unaware of the fact she was. As to what you put inside spoiler tags, i was already aware but i expected her and her followers to have some kind of impact on the series and not just fade away."
Malazan,2yls57,Silmariel,3,Tue Mar 10 23:34:52 2015 UTC,"I vividly recall Pearl and Lostara telling Tavore about Shaik. Not telling Tavore the whole deal, and just being so goddamn frustrated.

Malazan,2yksf5,Kinslaer,26,Tue Mar 10 17:16:22 2015 UTC,"As /u/forgot-word said below: the leadership / strategic prowess of someone can be described in terms of Cold or Hot iron. Both are dangerous in their own way.  Leaders who are 'Hot Iron' are terrible enemies because they inspire fanatic followings, but do not balk at the prospect of throwing away countless lives to achieve victory. A 'Hot Iron' commander on the battlefield will prove to be an unpredictable, unstable foe. You must defeat them utterly to be certain that they are defeated. An appropriate description of S'haik.  Cold iron leaders, conversely, are consumed by singular purpose and conviction. They are not necessarily charismatic figures, but people will follow them into the maw of death itself. Their resolve, as opposed to their ideology, is the backbone of their command. Cold iron leaders are terrifying foes because they are, as /u/forgot-word said, calculating and ruthless. They strategize on an entirely different level, and if you cannot out-think them, you cannot hope to vanquish them. Once again, appropriate for the Adjunct.  I believe S'haik is unnerved because even though she is the subject of a fanatical following, she knows that her command is rooted in that fervour. Should it dissipate (given the volatile elements in the Whirlwind Army), she would be unable to hold her military might together. However, Tavore - an exemplar of cold-iron conviction - approaches with a lethal singularity of purpose, and S'haik is not sure if the flames of the whirlwind will survive against Malazan retribution."
Malazan,2yksf5,titanemesis,5,Tue Mar 10 19:18:33 2015 UTC,Ah that clears it up thanks! So other examples of hot iron leaders would be the Pannion Seer and his commanders in Memories of Ice.
Malazan,2yksf5,AllWrong74,4,Tue Mar 10 19:30:03 2015 UTC,"Yes.  And, from the series, the pre-eminent example of a cold iron leader would be Coltaine.  He never lost his cool, and everyone followed him, because they believed in his strategic prowess, and his commitment to getting the Chain of Dogs to Aren."
Malazan,2yksf5,forgot-word,5,Wed Mar 11 13:05:54 2015 UTC,"To just explain cold vs hot iron in a non spoiler way.  Cold iron is calm and collected.  Calculated.  A leader/general that thinks of the whole picture.  Hot iron is rash and short sighted.  They react and don't think of the future consequences as much.  So when L'oric lists off names you'll see there's a theme.  The names are leaders, and those leaders all did things in a similar way.  You'll have to read into it because I haven't read HoC in a while and I don't want to give away any spoilers unknowingly...  Hope that helps a bit. :S"
Malazan,2yksf5,DougDons,3,Tue Mar 10 17:23:39 2015 UTC,"Good explanation. Also, I think L'Oric makes the connection (and maybe says) that cold iron almost always beats hot iron, which is why she starts to panic."
Malazan,2yksf5,FR05TB1T3,2,Tue Mar 10 18:12:56 2015 UTC,Not always but a good 4/5 or something along those lines is what he says.
Malazan,2yksf5,Silcha,3,Wed Mar 11 02:51:46 2015 UTC,L'oric says that cold iron usually beats hot iron 9/10 times and Sha'ik realizes Tavore is cold iron and she is hot iron.

The laughter was necessary to help balance out all the heartbreak of all the craziness but the heartbreak of knowing that you're finally finishing one of the greatest series you'll ever read.   Now do the Esselmont books, Forge of Darkness, and then your first re-read! Honestly it's as good as reading it the first time for different reasons."
Malazan,2ykjuj,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Tue Mar 10 16:39:34 2015 UTC,Or maybe start the mandatory re-read with B&K and Esslemont books.

Malazan,2ykjuj,xolotl92,4,Wed Mar 11 00:28:09 2015 UTC,"Such an amazing feeling closing that book after hitting the last page, ain't it?  I waited three years and now am reading the ICE books. The first couple were a bit sluggish but Stonewielder is magnificent thus far."
Malazan,2ykjuj,Tumblehawk,1 point,Tue Mar 10 16:43:24 2015 UTC,Orb Sceptre Throne is even better! At least in my opinion.
Malazan,2ykjuj,TriscuitCracker,2,Tue Mar 10 16:46:10 2015 UTC,"I believe it. It's a pleasure watching him grow as a writer. I read some Q&A's that explained it a bit - NoK and RotCG were largely written around the same time as GotM, so, yeeears ago. Clearly he improved his chops a LOT in the intervening years."
Malazan,2ykjuj,Tumblehawk,2,Tue Mar 10 17:11:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, KoN and RotCG are pretty bumpy. Everything he wrote after that was quite enjoyable, though. I particularily liked Stonewielder."

This is the greatest thing I've ever read, and I can't wait to re-read it. TCG surpassed every expectation I had of it, what a way to end the series, its a masterpiece."
Malazan,2ykeok,maccers,11,Tue Mar 10 15:33:27 2015 UTC,"If memory serves, Steven Erikson mentioned fall 2015 as the release in his Reddit AMA."
Malazan,2ykeok,Tumblehawk,8,Tue Mar 10 15:40:22 2015 UTC,"I think Erikson has mentioned that he doesn't really know how to write a ""short"" series... He has been given so much space with MBOTF that trying to write a simple trilogy is actually quite a challenge for him!   SPOILERS  In Fall of Light he has written a lot about the Jaghut war on death and I think he realised that he has too much to write about just on that storyline. I think he has had to make some tough decisions about where to streamline, what to cut etc. Hence the delay. He isn't GRRM though so I imagine it will be out by the end of 2015."

Malazan,2yhu6x,TheBionicBosom,2,Tue Mar 10 05:33:55 2015 UTC,"Letherii are imo white European. Malazan are mixed because of the diversity in nations, with black and Roman. 7 Cities Arabic and steppe nations. Tiste are elves basically. Andii black, edur grey. Jaghut tall with green skin and big tusks, Jhag are halfbreeds with smaller tusks. Toblakai are huge semi giants and their halfbreeds are usually just human like with health issues or sometimes closer to Toblakai size. Most don't get 4 lungs as the bloodline is reduced."
Malazan,2yhu6x,verheyen,1 point,Sat Mar 14 00:26:23 2015 UTC,Pretty much nailed it. Genabackans I picture as white as well for some reason.   Also Napan people are blue-ish.

Malazan,2ygaap,BirdBathandBeyond,12,Mon Mar 9 15:59:23 2015 UTC,"I think Raest was very strong, but it was also believed that Rake could kill him, just would take a pounding doing it.  No idea how to compare him to others, but I suspect an Azathani like Brood could kill him.  Hood is, I think, the most powerful Jaghut, besides maybe Gothos.  We'll get to see him in action in Fall of Light, when his war on death happens.  In FoD, Gothos seems pretty convinced Errastas made a big mistake killing Hood's wife, due to Hood's strength."
Malazan,2ygaap,sonofa2,1 point,Mon Mar 9 16:44:32 2015 UTC,That's cool that stuff about Hood.  I have started reading FOD but I'm having trouble getting through it.  I don't really have much interest in the Tiste Andii so it's not really drawing me in.  Is the more with the Jaghut later on?
Malazan,2ygaap,sonofa2,6,Mon Mar 9 17:04:20 2015 UTC,"Oh sorry, I missed the FoD part of your original post, just saw the Spoilers all.  So to avoid too much detail, yes, the Jaghut are brought up in FoD. You deal with Haut a lot, and the end has some ties to the main story line of that book.  Fall of Light will definitely have more to say on them, as Hood's war will be shown (I'm pretty pumped for that personally).    For general encouragement, FoD is a weird book to read.  As it tells the story of the formation of the Andii and the Liosan.  You have to think back to the creation stories we read through the previous books by Erickson and ICE, and how they were really just exaggerations of the class based society.  The story does get better the more the book progresses, and the build up at the end is great.  Try and push on though, as the story is pretty great, and the Azathani revelations are pretty game changing."

Malazan,2ygaap,BlackViperMWG,8,Mon Mar 9 21:19:00 2015 UTC,"His goal was to destroy death. Not just some god of death, or some personification of death, but death itself. That's not a thing that is doable. He settled for controlling it, since ending the concept of ending isn't really possible."
Malazan,2ygaap,Gaebryal,0,Mon Mar 9 21:54:02 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, there isn't said he didn't won that war, and that Death was concept of death and ending, not some entity who was currently at the throne of death."
Malazan,2ygaap,lykideus,3,Tue Mar 10 17:22:59 2015 UTC,"Remember it took several jaghut working with a t'lann imass army to defeat him the first time, and they didnt have the power to kill him then, so they put him to sleep.  So yes, if Raest got his finnest, he would only have been able to be stopped by several accendants working together.  Raest, only contained a fraction of his power without his finnest.  In that state of weakness, he defeated 5 dragons, and the empire estimated that he would either kill rake, or injure him enough for the gallain lord to defeat.  Annomander was at the garden to prevent him from getting his finnest for this reason.  as for hood, hes most likely the 2nd most powerful jaghut, behind Gothos (who was icarium and raest's father, and SE has said that gothos would be his shaved knuckle if he could have any)"
Malazan,2ygaap,Giotto,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:22:49 2015 UTC,"Ya I agree about Raest, I think with his finnest he would of wrecked some serious shit.  What exactly was that Gallain Lord? Is he a Lord of some other realm?"
Malazan,2ygaap,cantlurkanymore,2,Mon Mar 9 21:29:10 2015 UTC,"If I recall, he was some Demon Lord or other."
Malazan,2ygaap,xolotl92,2,Tue Mar 10 00:47:57 2015 UTC,"He gets called in out of no where, and then is dealt with very quickly. But he's one Tayschrenn's demons, from some warren.  Rake tells Crokus to leave the area before the fight, saying, ""This will be a close thing"". So it's implied that their ""power levels"" are very close.  One thing to note about that, is that the Galayn Lord is a pet of Tayschrenn. That Tay can keep such a being as a pet speaks to his own power... Which we don't see too much of. But Tay does ascend later, so.. that's kind of foreshadowing."
Malazan,2yescl,TylerHopsBarley,3,Mon Mar 9 04:33:11 2015 UTC,"He'd probably have living plants rather than dead ones, like ivy, or maybe even a tree coming out of dormancy.   No idea what the High House Life gate would look like other than a more rugged and bad ass ""Pearly Gates"" look. Slightly less ethereal, imho.  His sword should definitely be there as it was apart of his whole adult life as a commander for Letherii.   I would also imagine, rather than moons and stars, he'd have a sunrise to symbolically represent Life anew. I'd also avoid death or morbidly morose things since he's the symbol of hope for the future.  I'm also only 30% through The Crippled God so other things might be mentioned later on that I'd add later.  I'd also like to see these cards you're making. I've got a wood burning kit that I'd love to play with and making the Deck of Dragons would be fun."

A river or mountain with a sunrise or just a sunny sky in the background. Border it with grapevines and some orange/red flowers around the corners."

Malazan,2yescl,Tumblehawk,1 point,Mon Mar 9 15:30:12 2015 UTC,"You could try for something that includes the whole underwater guardian thing, his knowing all of the names is I think closely linked to his position being in High House Light and it's because of that he was resurrected too.. all that martial stuff, e.g. being the King's Champion, a Finadd (guarding lives) and, later, general are probably the most important things to convey. You could possibly include something to do with the Azath, as he had a fair bit to do with it for Karu Qan.  I don't think there's ever really a physical description for him besides fit though, maybe from Atri-Ceda Aranict's pov somewhere though. I'll take a look.

Malazan,2ydov7,KrugSmash,8,Sun Mar 8 22:32:50 2015 UTC,"The letherii language is very similar to the language in seven cities, because both are based on the language spoken by the human first empire."

Malazan,2yb0k5,Morph19_,20,Sun Mar 8 03:40:02 2015 UTC,"Always been a fan of both. Personally I like Malazan more though. Main reason why this sub is so small is because Malazan doesn't have an HBO show.  We have seen a dramatic rise in our subscribers over the last year though since more people are reading the books. I assume more people are reading Malazan now for the same reason you are haha. But whatever works, I'm just happy more people are reading it.  I also agree it would never work as a series. Not a good one anyway. Unfortunately some people don't seem to understand that."
Malazan,2yb0k5,SerBronnofBlackwater,2,Sun Mar 8 04:10:23 2015 UTC,"At this moment i'm not really sure which books i like more, i will have to wait to read the end of ASOIF to decide which one i like the most."
Malazan,2yb0k5,HumbleAsFudge,2,Sun Mar 8 04:34:34 2015 UTC,"I still think that there is a small, yes small, yet existent opertunity to turn the franchise into an animated series, if enough people have started to read the books and show financial interest for a animated series."
Malazan,2yb0k5,SerBronnofBlackwater,5,Sun Mar 8 20:25:05 2015 UTC,I don't think you can get a large enough adult audience to follow the complex storyline and it's hundreds of characters.
Malazan,2yb0k5,HumbleAsFudge,1 point,Sun Mar 8 21:10:01 2015 UTC,"I would actually beg to differ. I am not sure if you watch Anime, but if you do then you would defently be aware that there is a very large audience, not only in Japan, but in the U.S and Europe who are willing and have, to invest countless hours into deep and complex plots.  I am not saying I think the series should be an anime. But trust me, the world isnt filled with only people who want quick explosion entertainment, the Anime and Manga community are a live testimony for this."
Malazan,2yb0k5,Xardov,2,Sun Mar 8 21:41:19 2015 UTC,"An anime could work for the series, something in the line of Fate/Zero, that anime has very good fight scenes, but i read one time that the anime industry doesn't adapt works outside from Japanese materials."
Malazan,2yb0k5,HumbleAsFudge,4,Mon Mar 9 00:16:06 2015 UTC,Oh please no.  Anime is full of wooden animation and cliche facial expressions.  If it's going to be an animated series it needs to be produced by a western animation company.
Malazan,2yb0k5,Whales96,2,Mon Mar 9 23:50:07 2015 UTC,"Well thats the thing, we dont want an anime do we? Because    I dont think the current anime art style would fit to well. That would imply that its voiced in japanese and then dubbed, and I dont know about you people but I would not be ready to watch 10 seasons of the favourite series, which was written in english, just to be dubbed by the same 6 people for 100+ characters.   Im simply saying that there is defenetly an audience for more gritty, mature and complex themes and plots, proving this with taking the anime industry as an example.  However Im sorry but I would never trust the anime industry with Malazan. What I think it should be animated as is a simply a high quality mix between modern western animation, and modern hyper realistic Japanese anime; Berserk movies, attack on titan."

Malazan,2yb0k5,internet_enthusiast,4,Sun Mar 8 22:55:14 2015 UTC,"2 books of ASOIF and decided that I personally preferred the TV show to learn the story.   To each their own of course, but I have a hard time understanding this mentality.  I'm a fan of the show, but I feel that the story it tells is a pale imitation of the one told in the books.  Characters are left out or composited, storylines omitted, and strange plot twists added in (often seemingly for no good reason).  Not to mention that the use of gratuitous nudity to make expository scenes more visually stimulating has given some the impression that the series has an overly prurient focus.  I'm curious, did you start by reading the books first, or watching the show?  What about the show do you prefer?"
Malazan,2yb0k5,TriscuitCracker,2,Mon Mar 9 19:56:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  I do understand where you're coming from as far as the camaraderie of watching the show with friends.  You should definitely read ASOIAF at some point.  The third book, A Storm of Swords, is probably my favorite fantasy novel of all time, although they are all brilliant in my opinion."
Malazan,2yb0k5,HumbleAsFudge,13,Mon Mar 9 22:55:11 2015 UTC,"I love both for different reasons. Malazan however isn't quite as accessible as ASOIAF. Erikson's writing style, which is heavy on the introspective philosophy and very complicated plot lines with hundreds of characters combined with little infodumping means he's highly intimidating when you first pick them up. I work at a bookstore and always recommend Malazan, but I've had equal amount of people tell me they are enthralled by it and almost the same number of people say they couldn't even get through the first half of Gardens of the Moon it was ""just too much"".    Malazan I feel could work as an animated series on HBO...could do all the crazy effects it needed and it could be the adult series it needs to be. The more people get the word out, the more the sub will grow!"
Malazan,2yb0k5,tenhou,2,Mon Mar 9 23:28:06 2015 UTC,"Completely agree we first off need some way to get the fanbase to drastically grow and then prove that were interested in a series; a animated series imo is the only way to go.    Financially more reasonable than live action Special effects and dramatic scenerey will be apreciated much more as a beautiful animated compared to cheap cgi, I say cheap because I doubt the fanbase can grow large enough to allow ASoIaF type funding, not at least until Malazan has its own show ;) Cities and locations can be depicted as closely to the concept art as no moddeling or reconstruction is needed; live action will always limit the representation of a fantasy universe."
Malazan,2yb0k5,bantuftw,2,Sun Mar 8 04:56:52 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm a freak of nature, but I was able to read Erikson much easier than Martin. I tried to get into a good reading pace with the first book of ASoIaF three times, but it just felt like reading a grocery list. It felt like a chore. I had to quit. I wanted to like it but I couldn't. With Erikson, however, it just flowed through me, and I couldn't help but to read more and more."
Malazan,2yb0k5,creativeatrophy,8,Sun Mar 8 20:29:12 2015 UTC,"I did.   Became bored with the wait between seasons, so I read the books.  Then I became bored with the wait between the books so I started reading Malazan. Currently on Toll the Hounds."
Malazan,2yb0k5,mobileforBACON,7,Sun Mar 8 22:47:23 2015 UTC,"Same here, loving this series.  I'm loosing faith that ASOIAF will finish, and happy to be working through a series that has an ending."

Malazan,2yb0k5,Heron78,4,Sun Mar 8 17:23:16 2015 UTC,read ASOIAF books and wanted to find something similar found a book list on I think io9 and they mentioned MBotF and I was hooked.
Malazan,2yb0k5,JimmyTMalice,3,Sun Mar 8 18:13:27 2015 UTC,"As I'm reading Malazan, I feel like the author has a plan for these characters, and that little hints will end up paying off.  I did not get that sense at all reading ASOIAF!"
Malazan,2yb0k5,pfk505,3,Sun Mar 8 16:13:00 2015 UTC,"The first three books in ASOIAF seemed to have a general direction in which the series was going, but as it sprawls more and more into irrelevant plotlines and nothing is resolved it becomes pretty clear that GRRM has no idea where he's going with the story and is just going down the route of randomly killing off characters for 'shock value'.   I'm up to the first part of House of Chains and all the deaths I've seen so far in MBotF have been impactful and emotional, affecting the story deeply rather than just being pointless twists. Sure, death is cheap in the Malazan world (one of the main characters is killed off early on and resurrected almost immediately), but that doesn't make the endings of DG and MoI any less impactful."
Malazan,2yb0k5,ItkovianShieldAnvil,3,Sun Mar 8 20:42:21 2015 UTC,"As far as reading goes, I was never much into fantasy until reading ASOIAF.  I had read Tolkien and enjoyed him very much, but never really felt the need to delve into fantasy more seriously as I tended to be more interested in classics and other philosophical fiction.  Like many others I watched GOT on HBO for a couple seasons and became intrigued enough to give the books a try.  At this point I won't watch the show any more, I really believe the books are far superior.  As for Malazan, I pray nobody ever tries to adapt it.  I came to enjoy it even more than ASOIAF and already have several other fantasy series/authors on my list to check out!"
Malazan,2yb0k5,tenhou,3,Tue Mar 10 16:17:31 2015 UTC,I came after Tolkien. Recommended by a bookstore patron.
Malazan,2yb0k5,TriscuitCracker,3,Sun Mar 8 05:58:25 2015 UTC,"I cut through Tolkien like a fat kid in a chocolate store. I also played a game called Dark Souls, and I asked the community for a series that was filled with just as much or more dark, gritty, melancholy, and hopeless imagery. A handful of people recommended Malazan, and I fucking loved it. I love cluster fucks, and Gardens of the Moon was an absolute blast to start a series with."
Malazan,2yb0k5,JimmyTMalice,2,Sun Mar 8 07:50:32 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, if you like Dark Souls, Malazan would be great. You also may like Black Company by Glen Cook or Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe."
Malazan,2yb0k5,TheHopelessGamer,2,Sun Mar 8 22:50:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with your comparison between Dark Souls and MBotF, i don't know a lot about the fantasy genre but i  can totally picture MBotF being to the genre what Dark Souls is to the gaming scene, although this is kind of weird because they are totally opposite regarding the scope of the plot, the MBotF has a very large, rich and complex plot while the Souls series of games has an almost non existent plot."
Malazan,2yb0k5,DougDons,2,Sun Mar 8 23:32:20 2015 UTC,"The central plot in the Souls games may be fairly simple, but the similarity to the MBotF comes from the complex layers of lore and history that you have to figure out for yourself. There's a lot more than you can see on the surface, and they both give the same feeling of being dropped headfirst into a world that you don't understand and having to sink or swim."
Malazan,2yb0k5,85pctofyouhavetogo,3,Mon Mar 9 00:10:26 2015 UTC,"My brother introduced me to ASOIF back when the first CCG set was being released in, I don't know, 2000? I read them throughout high school and was definitely blown away. My interest in them since has waned heavily.  He introduced me to Malazan somewhere around 2006 or 2007. I read the first two books but got stopped up at the prologue of Memories of Ice. Three years ago I reread the first two with the intent to gain some momentum going into MoI. With the help of the Tor reread of the Fallen, I'm now starting Dreams of Dust (having read the ICE books in sequence as well) and am convinced this is and will likely be my favorite book series.  I'm a gigantic Tolkien nerd having read the Lord of the Rings, Silmarillion, Hobbit, and even Children of Hurin several times each, but Erickson and ICE have created an even more lush, wondrous world than Tolkien, which is just a ridiculous accomplishment. It's also really inspired my own writing, for which I am eternally grateful."
Malazan,2yb0k5,Boru12,2,Tue Mar 10 16:12:43 2015 UTC,"My reading progression goes Wheel of Time > A Song of Ice and Fire > Malazan series, with some little series sprinkled in between."
Malazan,2yb0k5,Skest,2,Sun Mar 8 15:46:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm same boat. Tolkien -> ASOIF (after watching first season) -> MBotF.  Wasn't a huge fantasy guy till ASOIF, but after I finished that series I pined for more.  A quick internet search of ""book series like Game of Thrones"" led me.  Thought I was the only one who did this but obv not!  I'm on book 6 now, and I'm sure when I'm done I'll run another search for ""book series like MBotF"" haha.  Hood's Breath."
Malazan,2yb0k5,MrChug,2,Sun Mar 8 19:22:49 2015 UTC,"I picked up GotM during the long wait for A Dance With Dragons. I had a hard time getting into it at first, so I tried a couple of other fantasy series that were recommended from various sites and found them all to be lacking or annoying in one way or another. When ADWD came out I finished it quickly and went back through the whole process again with all the same series. What kept getting to me was the book I had that I did not finish, GotM. I powered through it and the Malazan world is by far my favorite and I am not even finished with it yet. Had I known about this helpful and supportive group before I would have never given up in the first place."

I got to the Malazan books because Stephen Donaldson (author of the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant) is a big fan of Erikson's and often mentions him.  I haven't read ASOIAF and don't plan to, though I love the TV show."
Malazan,2yb0k5,Owenleejoeking,2,Mon Mar 9 20:39:29 2015 UTC,"I think that you should give a chance to the books of ASOIF, they are a much lighter read than SE and the first book shouldn't  take much of your time anyway."
Malazan,2yb0k5,Tumblehawk,1 point,Sun Mar 8 08:29:59 2015 UTC,"Came to the Malazan books through one of those 'things to read while you're waiting for WoT 14 to come out' lists, captured by the promise of a fantasy series that was both epic and 'complete'. Blitzed through the series in a few months on my commute.   I've since read the ASOIAF books to date but found the 4th and 5th to be significantly weaker than the others - sustaining 16 viewpoints at once just means that each only has a few chapters to actually get anything done in each book (see also WoT books 7 to 10); MBotF consistently hits a sweet spot in capturing a diverse range of viewpoints without stalling the story.  I recommend MBotF to friends who have managed other fantasy books (fantasy novices get pointed at Name of the Wind instead) and haven't had anyone disappointed so far."

Malazan,2yb0k5,Nichase,1 point,Sun Mar 8 20:17:27 2015 UTC,"I read ASOIAF after I read the MBotF. Wasn't that impressed with the writing, at all. Cool story, though."
Malazan,2yaf09,houndoftindalos,25,Sun Mar 8 00:00:56 2015 UTC,"I think that a cannibal peasant army in the Malazan universe isn't more out of line than dragons, gods, undead warriors, big ass hounds and T-Rex with giant blades instead of hands.  I dont think that is over the top, rather i think that fits perfectly to the whole world, they die like vermin and don't have any military discipline, they are fitted to their sick Pannion Seer and Matron."
Malazan,2yaf09,Morph19_,8,Sun Mar 8 01:15:25 2015 UTC,You're right that the logistics of the army quite simply wouldn't work out.  However the notion of a conquering army eating the losers can be found in many parts of the world in early civilizations.
Malazan,2yaf09,ShakaUVM,3,Sun Mar 8 00:59:32 2015 UTC,I was under the impression that it was just the tenescowri that were not getting normal supplies. I know that the upper echelons did eat flesh too but I don't think that was their only source of provisions.
Malazan,2yaf09,gathmoon,7,Sun Mar 8 14:38:05 2015 UTC,"Peasant armies which were poorly fed, equipped, etc and we're used as cannon fodder were used a lot.   I feel like I read somewhere that Alexander the Great and The Crusades may have had cannabilism from the super poor peasant armies. The crusaders (no clue if it's anything but a myth) who were starving ate Muslims they conquered and this instilled a lot of fear. I think there was definitely cannabilism from starving soldiers but not on the scale of the Tenescowri. I don't think Erikson made the whole thing up. I imagine it having some truth and something to reflect on (the power of religious crusades, beliefs, etc).   So no equivalent but we have Mao, Stalin, Hitler, The Crusades, etc.   If you want to see what hunger can do check out The Great Famine and also just huge famines through history."
Malazan,2yaf09,Aiolus,8,Sun Mar 8 03:25:13 2015 UTC,Since you are not done with MOI you don't have all the details about the Domin yet. I would let everything play out before you call it as weird and out of place.
Malazan,2yaf09,gathmoon,5,Sun Mar 8 13:51:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think literally only eating the people who have been killed in battle would work for a variety of reasons but its not really any stranger than a lot of the stories about foreign soldiers in any number of different conflicts throughout history. Cannibalism is definitely not unheard of in times of conflict, but if this is based on anything its almost certainly based on a story, not actual people."
Malazan,2yaf09,angrywhitedude,1 point,Sun Mar 8 02:09:16 2015 UTC,It is not likely that there ever existed an army of cannibals like the Tenescowri but there have been some over the top behaviors by large groups of people that seem like they can't possible be true such as the dancing plague of 1518. I really don't think they seem to far out of place in this universe.
Malazan,2yaf09,PhumDuck,1 point,Sun Mar 8 15:26:20 2015 UTC,"The one that comes to mind for me is the Bronze Age Collapse. Shortly after 2000 BCE, all of the major civilizations of the Mediterranean go dark with the exception of Egypt who writes of the Sea People. Greece saw 90% of settlements abandoned and a 70% population drop. Nearly every major settlement of the Hittites  is destroyed. In Mycenae, the most famous Greek city of the era, the last thing they built before the city is destroyed was a well that was dug through hundreds of feet of stone--not something you do unless the situation is desperate. The fact that the site never sees any major work afterward tells you how that one played out... On Crete, you see people fleeing up to insanely remote mountain tops to live in fear and barely scrape out a living. From the ruins and location it is clear that the people were terrified and desperate to find safety. Pollen counts have shown a marked drop around this time, which indicate that massive drought swept through. When the Egyptians fought the second wave of the mysterious Sea people, they made note of the fact that the invaders brought their families and possession with them--they were refugees looking for food. The rolling wave of collapse includes horrifying final messages between kings writing urgently for help and food, a matter of life and death they say.   I've always picture this as a horde of hungry people who storm nearby cities' granaries for food, but in so doing they simply create more desperately hungry people who are forced to storm the next city for food. The Egyptians write of the diverse groups of people who were suddenly working together. Did they resort to cannibalism? We have one weird letter that mentions that that happened further east, but there is no direct evidence for it happening. That being said, with the catastrophic level of destruction and drop in population level, it's really hard to see a version of evens were everyone decided to starve to death rather than commit the sin of eating fellow human flesh. =\"
Malazan,2yaf09,Orbusinvictus,-2,Wed Apr 8 01:52:43 2015 UTC,Closest thing is the Mongols. I don't know how cannibalistic they were but I know they would cut open a vein in their horse and drink a little bit of their blood.
Malazan,2yaf09,Nichase,3,Sun Mar 8 03:01:49 2015 UTC,"The mongols did normally have a large peasant population that they drove infront of their army, particularly in the campaigns into china. They were used as fodder for the more technologically advanced chinese weapons."

Malazan,2y8p5b,ixosamaxi,6,Sat Mar 7 15:32:35 2015 UTC,"So any explanation is likely not going to be the ""correct"" one, but to me it seems basically that immortal beings who have lived for absurdly long periods of time are going to be extraordinarily cautious. Rake knows that he is absurdly powerful, but he also knows that if he attacks someone or something that is powerful enough he might be weakened in the process, and that some other being, ascendant or other, might decide that's a good time to attack him. This would fit in well with the idea of a convergence and power drawing power."
Malazan,2y8p5b,angrywhitedude,3,Sat Mar 7 23:54:30 2015 UTC,"To add on to this, if he is weakend and attacked, he risks losing Draginpur.

Malazan,2y8p5b,quadtard,2,Mon Mar 9 12:56:06 2015 UTC,"This would be my theory too. If he expends too much power, he's vulnerable to attack. If he expends too much power, he might draw more powerful foes into the conflict and cause more death."

Malazan,2y8p5b,BlackViperMWG,1 point,Mon Mar 9 17:59:21 2015 UTC,"That sound right about Karsa, i feel that that kind of behavior will suit more the old Karsa, like 2 or 3 years ago, not the new Karsa that SE presented in RG and TtH, where he seems very calm and intelligent.  The thing about Quick Ben is that i'm kind of tired trying to understand from where his powers come, yeah everybody says that nobody really knows him or know what he is capable of and in the books he is very obtuse about his powers and knowledge, but there's have to be a coherent evolution of a character and his powers, not just say that suddenly his powers are much much bigger for no reason, give me a reason i don't care if its weak, like when Stormy and Gesler became more strong, the reason, they travel in the path of a dragon through a specific warren(something like that)."
Malazan,2y8p5b,Morph19_,7,Wed Mar 11 13:48:25 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I don't know if people post questions like this because they really can't figure things out for themselves, or because they just want to poke holes in things for the sake of poking holes in things.  On the off chance that your confusion is genuine, let me repost the question in a different form - one that you may more easily relate to.  The United States is an all powerful nation. It has nuclear weapons that can obliterate half the planet. A bunch of fanatics blow up two of their buildings, and go around threatening to bomb their civilians. Why didn't the states just nuke them and be done with it? Why instead did they have to form a coalition of nations and go in their with boots on the ground?  Think through the implications of all the possibilities inherent in the question, and you'll have most of your answer - at least the political and moral sides of things.  As to what Lady Envy was doing, the differences are as follows:  1) she was going through areas that had already been corrupted to the core - not trying to save Capustan where there would have been innocent civilians.  2) she doesn't have the morals Rake does.  3) she doesn't have a people who follow her and look up to her who she would be dragging into the consequences of her actions the way Rake would.   This isn't the be all and end all of the argument by any means, but the rest is just details and easy to put together and figure out if figuring is really what you're out for. There is no GoTMism involved here at all."

Malazan,2y8p5b,drae-,2,Mon Mar 9 00:35:39 2015 UTC,"The reason a lot of ascendants stay out of big fights until either they have no alternative or are otherwise compelled to intervene is because all the ascendants and gods are essentially in competition with each other. As long as everyone stays put no one is really drawing attention to themselves and therefore not likely to draw fire from the other gods. Every so often you'll see a god try to pull off something big but even if they succeed it's rarely good for them in the long term (see: every fucking time Oponn tries to meddle). By comparison you have gods who are very, very sneaky about what they do, such that other gods will not have either sufficient cause to attack them or sufficient justification to draw other gods in to help. The best example of that is probably how Shadowthrone messed with the Path of Hands in Deadhouse Gates. He used mortal agents where possible and never did anything ostentatious, just lots of little manipulations. That way he doesn't have to compete with a god of the soletaken and no one takes a swipe at him for sticking his neck out."

Malazan,2y8p5b,PromisedPrince694,2,Sun Mar 8 07:15:26 2015 UTC,"The problem is not that of a convergence in capustan or other place, the real problem is that GotM was written like 10 years before the rest of the series and SE change his views in several things, in GotM they say that if Raest could control one T'lan I'mass bonecaster then the two of them could kill almost all the gods(something like that), but in later books you can see that the Jaghut, tyrant or not, arent as powerful as represented in GotM, so SE change his views in them, there a lot of things like this, i think that they are called GotMism or something like that, for example in GotM Korlat brother, Orfantal, is female and in later books is male.  You have a very good point, i don't see why Lady Envy and the Seguleh third(plus the others) can kill a lot of Kell Hunters like they are ants but Rake and Brood need not only their rebel army but also Onearm host. TtH.  There are  several inconsistencies in SE books like this one BH.  I suggested that the next time that you encounter some inconsistency in the books, just accept the fact that SE doesn't always holds what he previously wrote and just keep reading, the inconsistencies  are going to keep showing."

Malazan,2y8p5b,Morph19_,2,Sat Mar 7 20:50:13 2015 UTC,"Also, using the Azath so blatantly could lead to Paran unveiling his power too rapidly to his tastes. Power attracts power..."
Malazan,2y8p5b,gbardelli,0,Sat Mar 7 20:59:46 2015 UTC,"From where do you get that, there is never any mention of that in the books, why Paran using a form of travel that other regular people(Crokus) or special(Apsalar) have used, would unveil his powers rapidly, the travel didn't unveil nothing in Apsalar powers."
Malazan,2y8p5b,Morph19_,2,Sat Mar 7 22:27:42 2015 UTC,"There is effectively no mention of it anywhere. However, Paran does use other means of transport later on, when things are either more dire/near the ending. Why not early then? Well, I think it is part of him either learning his powers as he goes along, and also the Malazan aspect of never unveiling too much. As for Apsalar, well, being unnoticed/covert his one of her traits. She is also deep into Shadow, which can affect things pretty much everywhere. But frankly that's just my view of things.    But I don't think that the problem posed by OP's question is a GotMism. Rake is still able to kill a demon able to level a city. And it wasn't necesserily easy in GotM by the way. For strategical reasons, he just chooses not to use his powers to the fullest. Also, what is said about Raest enslaving a Bonecaster is not that they could kill all the gods, but that they could challenge them. You are right, there are inconsistensies with GotM being written 10 years before the other books, but I don't think this counts as one of them."
Malazan,2y8p5b,gbardelli,2,Sun Mar 8 00:35:49 2015 UTC,"I agree whit you Rake and his capabilities are not a GoTMism, he should be able to do the same thing that Envy did in the south, he chooses not to do it, i just accepted it , that's the story that SE wanted to write, but that by itself doesn't make it logical, for my that is and inconsistency according to Rake and Caladan powers."
Malazan,2y8p5b,Morph19_,2,Sun Mar 8 00:52:44 2015 UTC,"I see where you are going with that. But one thing to remember I think, is that Rake unveiling more willingly his powers in GotM is also in part due to the way Malazans are trying to do just that: make him commit everything and bring him into the open. Pannions aren't gunning for that on the other hand.  TtH    But I see your point."

Malazan,2y8l9p,possumman,7,Sat Mar 7 13:33:47 2015 UTC,"It can be confusing!  New continent, new characters. Again lol   This is from memory so apologies for incorrect info.  The Great Meeting is happening to negotiate new trade agreements and talk about issues concerning both empires and such between the Lethiri Empire and the Tiste Edur tribes. Buruk the Pale represents Letheri interests, merchants, government, that sort of thing. Think of Hull Beddict and Seren Padoc as designated ambassadors from Lethirri escorting Buruk, without them, Buruk couldn't enter Tiste territory. The Tiste don't really care and only do it to placate the large human nation next door and to provide a steady supply of human slaves.  Hull has a bad history between himself and the Letheri Empire that you'll see and wants to maybe muck up the whole process and more. The Queen is not a nice person, but the King truly is compassionate and I can't remember why they need Gerun out of the city. Think of the Letheri Empire as capitalism run amok. The Letheri are a ""slow and steady wins the race"" kind of Empire.  Their society runs on debts and treaties and backstabbing and plotting. They don't tend use their military unless they have to.  They see territory they want but say your tribe is already there.  They offer you trade and things you want and ask you give up your people and land and put you into so much debt you have to sell everything you have including yourself, and then they assimilate you and your culture so after a generation or two, you wonder just what happened?  The Letheri have been ignorant of much of the rest of the world beyond their own large continent for a very long time. Keep that in mind, the world has passed them by.   Midnight Tides was my least favorite book at first, BUT by the time I was finished with it I saw how it was all going to come together and now it's one of my favorites. Like all Erikson books, the ending is fantastic. I enjoyed the Tehol and Bugg mystery/banter and how Trull's story slowly unfolds. I felt the same way, ""ANOTHER new continent?!?!"" but Midnight Tides is all about what's going on on the other side of the world while the previous books are taking place. You'll have quite a few ""Ah Hah!"" moments as events from other books are aluded to in this one from other characters from a different perspective. Plus Trull and Tehol/Bugg and Brys, you'll grow to love, and Rulahd...well, just read on! Trust me you are not alone in how you feel. But it may change! It did with me. Keep reading!   After this you get to Bonehunters, (back to the Malazans) and all the major subplots across all previous five books and continents start  to slowly weave together for an epic Convergence in the Crippled God."

Malazan,2y8l9p,drae-,2,Sat Mar 7 17:08:11 2015 UTC,"Gerun Eberict has the ""King's Leave"". He saved the king from an assassination attempt a few years ago. As reward the King granted Gerun ""Leave"" to basically do what he wanted without being punishable by the kings laws.   Gerun has used the LEave to become a vigilante, meting out justice as he sees fit.   They want him out of the city because he's become a pain in their ass over the years, uncontrollable, likely from enforcing his ""justice"" in ways contrary to the king and queens interests; yet he has ""Leave""; and to strip him of that would be politically fool hardy. Therefore they just want to get him out of the city.  Baruk the Pale is just a merchant. For merchants to enter the Edur lands to trade they must be escorted by an acquitor. These regulations are determined at each great meeting. Baruk bid for, and won, Seran Pedac's services (as one of a limited number of acquitors) after the last great meeting. Baruk is ostensibly travelling to the Edur lands simply to trade; but he has also been tasked by the Queen to report back the state of the Edur after she provokes them (the seal hunting), and to continue to provoke them.  The Queen covets the Edur lands. She's an arrogant one and believes the Letheri can subjugate the Edur as easily as they have the other tribes. So before this great meeting she ""pokes the bear"" so to speak by sending Letheri to hunt seals at a traditionally Edur hunting ground. She does this to try and provoke a strong response from the Edur to give the Queen the excuse she needs to invade the Edur and seize their lands and possessions.   Hull Bedict used to be employed by the empire as a sort of ambassador. Turns out the empire was using the good will he generated and the information he gathered to subject foreign tribes (prior to the Edur). Hull didn't appreciate being used in such a manner as has resolved to teach the empire a lesson. He thinks the Edur can defeat the empire. He wants to use them to further his own vengeance. So he's there to betray the Letheri and help the Edur.   Hanan Mosag sees through the Queens gambit at the seal hunting grounds, and sees it for what it is, a provocation to war. Therefore everyone knows this great meeting will be a farce, negotiating nothing in regards to trading and only seeking to probe each other with words prior to doing so with swords."

But he had not comprehended the vast capacity within him, within a mortal soul, to take within itself the suffering of tens of thousands, the multitudes who had lived with loss and pain for almost three hundred thousand years.  He saw faces, countless faces. Desiccated, eyes nothing more than shadowed pits. Dry, torn skin. He saw bone glimmering from between layers of root-like tendons and muscles. He saw hands, chipped, splintered, empty now – yet the ghosts of swords lingered there still.  He was on his knees, looking out upon their ranks, and it was raining, a wavering deluge accompanied by reverberating groans, splintering cracks filling the darkness above.  He looked upon them, and they were motionless, heads bowed.  Yet he could see their faces. Each face. Every face.  I have your pain.  Heads slowly lifted.  He sensed them, sensed the sudden lightness permeating them. I have done all I am able to do. Yes, it was not enough, I know. Yet. I have taking your suffering-  ‘You have taken our suffering, mortal.’  Into myself-  ‘We do not understand how.’  And so I will now leave you-  ‘We do not understand…. why.’  For all that my flesh cannot encompass-  ‘We cannot answer the gift you have given.’  I will take with me.  ‘Please, mortal-’  Somehow.  ‘The reason. Please. That you would so bless us-’  I am the…  ‘Mortal?’  Your pardon, sirs. You wish to know of me. I am… a mortal, as you say. A man, born three decades ago in the city of Erin. My family name, before I surrendered it to Fener’s Reve, was Otanthalian. My father was a hard, just man. My mother smiled but once in all the years I knew her. The moment when I departed. Still, it is the smile I remember. I think now that my father embraced in order to possess. That she was a prisoner. I think, now, that her smile answered my escape. I think now that in my leaving, I took something of her with me. Something worthy of being set free.  Fener’s Reve. In the Reve… I wonder, did I simply find for myself another prison?  ‘She is free within you, mortal.’  That would be… a good thing.  ‘We would not lie to you, Itkovian Otanthalian. She is free. And smiles still. You have told us what you were. But we still do no understand – your… generosity. Your compassion. And so we ask again. Why have you done this for us?’  Sirs, you speak of compassion. I understand something, now, of compassion. Would you hear?  ‘Speak on, mortal.’  We humans do not understand compassion. In each moment of our lives, we betray it. Aye, we know of its worth, yet in knowing we then attach to it a value, we guard the giving of it, believing it must be earned. T’lan Imass. Compassion is priceless in the truest sense of the word. It must be given freely. In abundance.  ‘We do not understand, but we will consider long your words.’  There is always more to do, it seems.  ‘You do not answer our question-’  No.  ‘Why?’  Beneath the rain, as darkness gathered, with every face raised to him, Itkovian closed himself about all that he held within him, closed himself, then fell back.  Back.  Because. I was the Shield Anvil. But now…  I am done.  And beneath the Moon’s torrential rain, he died.   Nope, I don't have anything in my eyes."

Many people give up on the series because of this.  They are used to having their hands held, and having information spoon-fed to them.  This series takes a lot of investment from you, because you have to figure out most everything yourself.  This turns off a lot of people (just not people like you, me, or the other 3500 people subscribed)."

Though my home now is in the heart of my Seer.’ ‘Where the winds are even colder,’ Toc muttered. The Seerdomin was silent for a moment. Toc was expecting a blow from a gauntleted fist, or a painful wrench from the hand gripping his frail arm. Either one would have been an appropriate response; either one would have elicited an approving nod from the Seer. Instead, the man said, ‘This is a summer day, but not like the summer days I remember in my youth. Coral’s wind was warm. Soft, caressing as a lover’s breath. My father, he fished out beyond the cut. Up along the coast north of here. Vast, rich shoals. He’d be gone for a week or more with every season’s run. We’d all go down to the causeway to watch the fleets return, to see our father’s orange sail among the barques.’ Toc glanced up at the man, saw the smile, the glimmering echo of a child’s joy in his eyes. Saw them die once more. ‘He came back the last time ... to find that his family had embraced the Faith. His wife, to the Tenescowri. His sons, to the ranks, eldest begun schooling as Seerdomin. He did not throw his lines to me on that day – seeing my uniform. Seeing my mother – hearing her mindless shrieks. Seeing my brothers with spears in hand, my sisters naked and clinging to men thrice their age. No, he swung the boom, tacked onto the offshore breeze. ‘I watched his sail until I could see it no more. It was my way, Malazan—’ ‘Of saying goodbye,’ Toc whispered. ‘Of saying good luck. Of saying ... well done.’ Destroyer of lives. Seer, how could you have done this to your people? A distant bell rang in the palace behind them. The Seerdomin’s grip tightened. ‘The allotted time is done.’ ‘Back to my own embrace,’ Toc said, his gaze straining to catch, one last time, the world before him. Remember this, for you will not see it again, Toc the Younger. ‘Thank you for the use of your cloak,’ he said. ‘You are welcome, Malazan. These winds were once warm. Come, lean on me while we walk – your weight is as nothing.’ They slowly made their way towards the building. ‘Easily borne, you mean.’ ‘I did not say that, Malazan. I did not say that.’     From just near the start of Chapter 20."

This time around, reaction to the book has been much lower than I'm used to seeing. You defintely like it, but as you point out, you see many people cite it as one of the weaker ones. Funny thing is, if you asked me like 2 months ago, I would have said MT is easily one of the top 3 books in the overall community."

I just finished MT yesterday and have noticed a lot of posts about MT lately too.   I seem to have the same experience as many Malazan readers. Starting MT, I was really dreading it and not having fun... until about 40% in. After finishing, it may now be one of my favorites.  I also had trouble getting through the Udinaas bits until about 60% in. After that point I really started to sympathize with him."

I remember by Bonehunters that I knew this would be the greatest fantasy series I would ever read.  During my re-read (currently at Blood & Bone) I loved it even more because I knew what everything was and I could enjoy the planted seeds for the climax all the way back to GOTM.
Malazan,2y455t,tenement,3,Fri Mar 6 06:51:54 2015 UTC,He's just a mage from the otateral prisons gone mad by all likelyhood. He's not important and won't come up again. So you actually haven't missed anything.

As for the significance of the head... Think about how rents are closed and how an extra head, or soul, could help with that and the implications of that.  I dont want to spell it out too directly because i think one of the joys of the series is figuring shit out, but i should have made it pretty clear i hope :)"

Malazan,2xxiis,Udinaas,2,Thu Mar 5 00:02:25 2015 UTC,"In the Malazan World (sometimes called Wu as a joke), a soul survives a person's bodily death.   Thus there's ""death of the boy"" and ""true death by destruction of the soul"".   An afterlife of a particular type, usually related to religion, method of death or location, is open to the soul. Hood often takes the soul to pack into his warrens and increase his power. However, there is something going on with Hood and with the process of death itself throughout the series."

Malazan,2xwq0c,Oops_I_Derped,14,Wed Mar 4 14:27:35 2015 UTC,"Malazan Book of the Fallen, is a monstrously large series.  Two DnD players came together and wrote down 20 or so years of DnD roleplaying into what I consider the best fictional fantasy epic of all time.  It's like a massive monstrous web of story telling and convolution. You're thrown into the middle of a dark obscure ocean of politics, murder and fictional history and are expected by the author to piece the entire jigsaw together one large disconnected chunk at a time, and you will.  Get ready for some real cool shit, if you have the patience, that is all.  Oh, and I know you really want to get into it asap, but read the Dramatis Personae for EVERY book, spend a few minutes on it. ESPECIALLY, midnight tides:P"
Malazan,2xwq0c,Landmarkmoon,2,Wed Mar 4 15:12:55 2015 UTC,It's based on DnD roleplaying?!
Malazan,2xwq0c,BioChemistryStudent,2,Wed Mar 4 23:01:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, decades of it."
Malazan,2xwq0c,Landmarkmoon,8,Wed Mar 4 23:45:27 2015 UTC,GURPS actually but yes a role playing campaign.

Joking aside, I struggled the most with all the characters, the world is huge and each book seems to add a bunch of new characters.

Malazan,2xwq0c,DougDons,1 point,Wed Mar 4 16:30:43 2015 UTC,The wikis are hugely helpful for the characters. I used them a lot.
Malazan,2xwq0c,Silcha,2,Wed Mar 4 17:12:07 2015 UTC,Also sooo filled with spoilers. Needs way more and stronger spoiler tags. They need to step up their game on that.
Malazan,2xwq0c,Lysander_Argent,1 point,Thu Mar 5 05:53:47 2015 UTC,I'd avoid the wiki. Spoiled a few things for myself that way.
Malazan,2xwq0c,Tragyn,4,Fri Mar 6 23:55:40 2015 UTC,Take it slowly and you may have to reread a passage or two. It took me a while to get through it. The series picks up in Deadhouse Gates don't worry. Eriksons writing style is complicated so you have to take his writing slowly.
Malazan,2xwq0c,Silcha,2,Wed Mar 4 15:18:02 2015 UTC,"It's a tough series to read, Erikson doesn't give the reader any shortcuts.  But I highly, highly suggest slugging it out until at least Memories of Ice.  That's the book where things get a little clearer, and by then, you'll be a little more comfortable with the dialog and the world."
Malazan,2xwq0c,13143,2,Wed Mar 4 19:28:12 2015 UTC,Also these books have a lot of re-read-ability because they are so dense and convoluted.

Malazan,2xwq0c,revers3TCP,1 point,Thu Mar 5 03:43:24 2015 UTC,"Dialogue was something I noticed in that first book as well, coming from ASOIAF and not having read much other fantasy apart from Tolkien.  I still think dialogue is something Martin does exceedingly well, and while Erikson's might not compare in GoTM you do get used to his style and the way his characters tend to speak.  As the books progress the dialogue becomes much more diverse and, at times, profane, and you will no longer perceive any weirdness in tone or whatever you're experiencing now.    One of the most common responses to questions in this sub is ""keep reading, stick it out,"" and for good reason, because doing so is immensely worth it and ultimately satisfying."

Malazan,2xvx3d,HereticForLife,7,Wed Mar 4 07:33:19 2015 UTC,"The cover art isn't always the best representation.  I've got no clue about the tower. I would guess the riders are just a representation of the chain of dogs.  The ax wielder is no one.  It's been asked before, and there's only a single mention of a soldier using an ax in the entire book, and he was using 2 of them if I recall correctly.  Most likely it's just a no named soldier on the army that the publisher's artist thought looked cool.  The last one looks like T'lan Imass. I would guess that's supposed to be Coral."
Malazan,2xvx3d,sonofa2,8,Wed Mar 4 11:40:19 2015 UTC,I think the tower is supposed to be Mock's Hold
Malazan,2xvx3d,stanglemeir,3,Wed Mar 4 15:00:37 2015 UTC,"Which is where Paran and Whiskyjack first meet, IIRC, like the OP said."
Malazan,2xvx3d,AreYouReadyToReddit,1 point,Wed Mar 4 16:46:38 2015 UTC,I couldn't remember if that is where they met or not. Gardens of the Moon was a bit confusing for the first half of the book.
Malazan,2xvx3d,stanglemeir,2,Wed Mar 4 16:50:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it doesn't help that you don't see the city/isle again until 6 books later."
Malazan,2xvx3d,AreYouReadyToReddit,3,Wed Mar 4 16:54:56 2015 UTC,I really like the other covers or MoI and MT a lot more than the two you linked. I've always thought fantasy book covers were cheesy but those seem up there.
Malazan,2xvx3d,StrafingLobster,3,Wed Mar 4 12:05:51 2015 UTC,"A book's art is usually not under the control of the author. The publisher will usually have someone send a vignette/excerpt to an artist with a note saying ""Draw this"".   So... the artist hasn't read the book and has to guesstimate things. Or the artist may be pushed to make things generic because that might be a better sales tactic.   The GotM tower is Mock's Hold, but... stripped of context. It's a better cover than the random wizard with blue lightning bolts or the awful cover with a random armored dude on a horse with a woman wearing boob armor leaning on the horse.  The DG one is supposed to be a stylized Whirlwind with random revolutionary cavalry (Mathok's tribesmen?). I dunno what scene in particular prompted this, but it's got a cool image with the wolves in the sand. The covers that Subterranean Press did are better images, but... I'm not sure they reach out and seize an imagination like the sand wolves do.  MoI's covers are Gruntle/Stonny, T'lan Imass outside of Coral and the Steve Smith random warrior.   Somewhere along the way, several of the publisher people fell in love with Steve Smith's covers for the series and those have taken over for most of the others in newer editions."
Malazan,2xvx3d,Udinaas,1 point,Wed Mar 4 19:02:32 2015 UTC,"I think those are Pannions outside of Capustan, because they look too alive for T'lan Imass."
Malazan,2xvx3d,BlackViperMWG,2,Mon Mar 9 21:41:29 2015 UTC,I've allways inturpreted the last one to be to be the tannescowry sacking capustan.
Malazan,2xvx3d,aleifur,1 point,Fri Mar 6 15:42:03 2015 UTC,"The DG one I'd say is the Whirlwind, with Sha'ik and her people moving through it.  The rest are all generic fantasy cover that has little to nothing to do with anything in the book."
Malazan,2xvx3d,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Wed Mar 4 16:46:45 2015 UTC,"Not true, first is tower in Mock's Hold in Malaz and last one is probably Pannions assaulting Capustan or some fortress."
Malazan,2xvx3d,BlackViperMWG,1 point,Mon Mar 9 21:43:31 2015 UTC,"But that's just it. It could be any tower anywhere. What makes it Mock's Hold besides the assumption it has to be something? It's a tower sticking out of a mountain, not a fortress part of a city on an island. Same with the MoI picture. You take a generic picture of some kind of fighter, and put it on a book involving lots of battles, sure, you can say 'its probably...' and fill in any part of the book. Doesn't change the fact its generic fantasy man. Maybe he's one of the pannion. Maybe he's part of the Grey Swords. Maybe he's part of the Malazan forces. Maybe he's a member of the genebackin forces. Such is the power of generic fantasy man."
Malazan,2xvx3d,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Mon Mar 9 23:04:09 2015 UTC,I don't really remember much.. but in the second picture I think it's the guy who was given responsibility of the Book to keep safe after the fight starts is going out with his troops..  Third one seems to be depiction the city where T'lan Imass had once killed everyone.
Malazan,2xtum3,infidelcastro89,3,Tue Mar 3 20:59:49 2015 UTC,"Yep, there are definite parallels between the Anabasis and the Chain of Dogs, especially when comparing Xenophon's portrayal of Cyrus and Duiker's portrayal of Coltaine. Both stories are told largely from the perspective of one character, Duiker in DG and Xenophon (in the third person) in the Anabasis.  Now that you mention it, this comparison brings up all sorts of questions about perspective in the MBotF. The Anabasis is a definitively biased work: Xenophon continually depicts Cyrus as a magnificent and worthy leader. Even after Cyrus dies at Cunaxa, Xenophon goes on a 30 chapter tangent to tell the story of Cyrus' education and adolescence, which of course parallels another work of Xenophon's, the Cyropaedica, which similarly depicts the education of Cyrus the Great in a positive light.  This invites an interesting comparison of Cyrus to Coltaine. Since almost the entirety of the Chain of Dogs is related to us by Duiker (perhaps there's an actual frame story here, and whenever DG switches to Duiker's perspective we're actually listening to Duiker tell his story to the Malazan marines in Darujhistan at the end of MoI), perhaps Erikson is trying to bring our attention to the possibility that Duiker's perspective is a flawed, biased one, and that perhaps we shouldn't take his story as the absolute truth. Perhaps Coltaine was merely a good general in the right place at the right time, and not the almost-Messianic figure he becomes in Duiker's portrayal.  Overall, a quite interesting comparison! If you haven't yet read the Anabasis, I do recommend it; though there are some boring parts (I swear, if I ever have to read about how many parasangs the Greeks walked again...), it's more than worth it for its fantastic look into ancient warfare and its interesting portrayal of larger-than-life figures like Cyrus, Tissaphernes, Klearchos, and many more."

Malazan,2xtum3,DarthPositus,3,Wed Mar 4 11:46:15 2015 UTC,I would be interested in seeing you revisit your analysis after having read them.
Malazan,2xtum3,ShamelesslyPlugged,3,Wed Mar 4 11:51:49 2015 UTC,"I find that not only the Chain of Dogs but much of the rest of Malazan (particularly including just about everything the 7th does) is reminiscent of The Anabasis of Xenophon. I loved that similarity while I was reading the series. ^_^  Also, I don't know if it's still available like this, but a few years ago I picked up an ebook version of The Anabasis for free on Amazon. I'd say it was a fantastic find."
Malazan,2xtum3,YearOfTheMoose,2,Wed Mar 4 04:40:55 2015 UTC,"If you enjoyed that check out Arians ""The life of Alexander"" well worth a read, not the best historically but certainly a good story."
Malazan,2xtum3,Dastardly6,3,Wed Mar 4 10:38:16 2015 UTC,"Paul Kearney wrote a fantasy trilogy called ""The Macht"" which  very closely follows the events of the Anabasis.  So much so the the first book is even call The Ten Thousand.  It's a great story with good characters and action and a very interesting world.  Makes me wish there was more fantasy exploring ancient Greek and bronze age style settings instead of the very common medieval setting.  Definitely recommend it along with Kearney's other works."
Malazan,2xtum3,Egarim,2,Wed Mar 4 05:30:39 2015 UTC,"Saberhagen'sGemmell's Greek stuff is pretty cool.  Of course, it's using the actual Greek heroes, so it's more like historical fantasy.

I have stopped reading books when the writers battle has archers sharpening stakes, heavy cavalry and a muddy field.   The cool thing Erickson and Esselmont does is take these things and use them as a base before taking it off at a right angle. For instance you could see the Malazan army as just the Romans with nicknames. But throwing stuff like the sappers, marines and for the eclectic make up of its ranks we aren't stuck with another carbon copy of Caesar legions."
Malazan,2xt9tl,ajkp2557,10,Tue Mar 3 18:32:56 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed Midnight Tides, although it was not my favorite. Based on what you have said, I think you will find Reaper's Gale to have a similarly frustrating start. I know that's not what you wanted to hear, but if you do not particularly care about the story in Lether I am trying to set expectations.  That said, The Bonehunters is my favorite book in the series and, without spoiling too much, I think you will really enjoy at least the latter half of Reaper's Gale."
Malazan,2xt9tl,NoFortress,2,Tue Mar 3 18:51:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the heads-up. I'm definitely expecting the end of MT to pay off, but damn, I hate having to push through such large parts of a book."
Malazan,2xt9tl,Foliagus,7,Tue Mar 3 19:06:59 2015 UTC,"I was intrigued. Holds, the Edur, it felt like new and rich worlds. The expansionist approach was entirely different, and somewhat humorous.   Tehol and bugg are big parts of the story, too. You'll see."
Malazan,2xt9tl,Tumblehawk,1 point,Tue Mar 3 22:19:15 2015 UTC,I feel like I should be intrigued and I have the feeling that my attitude is going to cost me some future understanding when things tie back into this story.

Like all Erikson books, the ending is fantastic. I enjoyed the Tehol and Bugg mystery/banter and how Trull's story slowly unfolds. I felt the same way, ""ANOTHER new continent?!?!"" but Midnight Tides is all about what's going on on the other side of the world while the previous books are taking place. You'll have quite a few ""Ah Hah!"" moments as events from other books are aluded to in this one from other characters from a different perspective. Plus Trull and Tehol/Bugg and Brys, you'll grow to love, and Rulahd...well, just read on! Trust me you are not alone in how you feel. But it may change! It did with me. Keep reading!   After this you get to Bonehunters, (back to the Malazans) and all the major subplots across all previous five books and continents start  to slowly weave together for an epic Convergence in the Crippled God."

Malazan,2xvg6v,Lankles,4,Wed Mar 4 16:28:21 2015 UTC,"As someone who loves to read I have no trouble powering through boring parts/chapters/books if I like the characters or something about the authors style. That being said I did notice exactly what you mean. There are almost entire chapters dedicated to ideologues and philosophical pondering and after a while it becomes redundant. It does seem to get ""worse"" the further you get into the series, as well.   To me, though, this series is amazing, ideological  rants included, and it's definitely worth taking the time to finish. Erickson has some good insights in there that were just slightly tarnished by the repetition. To me disliking this series for those few flaws is the equivalent of turning down a pot of gold because there's a bit of dirt on the gold pieces. But to each their own."

Is there a big conclusion to this book, or is it just setup for TCG?  I'm okay either way, but I'll admit that TtH and DoD has been a f**king drag to get through (other than the insanely awesome ending in TtH ofc.)  Looking forward to TCG, I've heard it's insane, and counted by many as the best in the series."

But then it gets confusing because it seems everyone who drank from the blood of Tiam likes to refer to themselves as a child of Tiam, so Tiam might not be any of their mothers and that parts jus metaphor.  And then it again gets even more confusing because all three of them exist in the Tiste Edur Religion as goddesses and daughters of Scabandari, which is almost certainly not true for all of them.  General rule of figuring the lineage of any of the ancient beings is don't. It's intentionally impossible to figure out because those facts have just been lost to time."
Malazan,2xqx09,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Tue Mar 3 04:33:52 2015 UTC,"FoD  The upshot of which is, of those only Menandore is young enough to potentially actually be a child of the Tiste person claimed there, so even those claims are more a claim of allegiance rather than actual relations, kind of like how the Tiam thing is a reference to being Soletaken by directly drinking Tiam's blood. I'm doubtful that Menandore is actually Osserc's child too.  Edit: Though Menandore has white skin - so probably Liosan, unlikely there's two with skin like Ruin - and the other two are Edur, so even that doesn't 100% make sense with the scene where they refer to Osserc as father."

Malazan,2xqx09,future_forward,1 point,Tue Mar 3 03:28:22 2015 UTC,I think ROAFO is the best answer here. Menandore is the main one you need to keep an eye on. She's the daughter of Osseric/Osserc (Tiste Liosan) and Tiam and has a...contentious personality. She's the mother of Ryad with Udinaas.  I don't remember if the other sisters are representative of Andii and Edur. But you'll see more of them later in RG. It all comes to a head in a pretty Eriksonian sort of way.
Malazan,2xqx09,JebusGobson,2,Tue Mar 3 03:44:12 2015 UTC,She's the mother of Ryad with Udinaas.   How did that happen again? I honestly can't remember.

Malazan,2xo3ed,Truebacca,33,Mon Mar 2 14:12:45 2015 UTC,"Going from Wheel of Time to Malazan is going to hurt your brain lol   First off, the glossary in the back of the book and the dramatis personae in the front are your best friends. Refer to these constantly. They help you keep track of who's who until you get a sense of things.   Eriksen is an archeologist and an anthropologist so his world building skills are amazing. Each locale you visit and most characters of all races have a rich sense of history and lore. Malazan is ancient, and you feel it every step of the way.   You may feel confused at first, like you got dropped into a foreign country with no knowledge of the history or customs or language, and who the heck are all these people? This is normal. Eriksen usually does not do info dumps, you are expected to figure things out as you read. Some major plot lines  take several books to truly put the pieces together. It really is all connected, though it is not apparent at all at first. There are many ""Ooooh and AH-HA!"" moments as you connect the dots. Bear in mind that Gardens is Eriksen's first book and he wrote it 9 years before the rest of the series and it shows sometimes, while still being a good book.   Eriksen is also heavy on the introspective philosophy. Most of the books start slow and steady, with character and plot building, then near the last 200 pages, all hell breaks loose and the next thing you know it's 5 in the morning and you have to go to work in 2 hours but what the heck you'll finish it anyway because you can't stop now.   It's epic, exhilarating, thoughtful, weepy and the kind of series that you'll re-read and deliberately buy the hardcovers for. Its even more amazing on a re-read.  It's also got 6 other novels by a secondary author Ian Esselmont that fill in tons of backstory, as well as other prequels and sequels by the main author in the works. It's also intimidating as hell. Good luck to you! Just let yourself be swept away, and at least read through Book 2 or 3 if Gardens of the Moon doesn't grab you. Please post your impressions here, we love newbie first timers, or ask any question you have, we'll keep it as spoiler free as we can."

This series is a thing of a beauty. I often find myself reading 200pages chunks at once, incapable of setting the book aside.   Personally, I was hooked up at 50%  of book 1 and couldn't stop reading after reaching 70%. From there onward I was convinced this was a unique experience for life"

Malazan,2xo3ed,DaveQat,5,Sat Mar 7 10:44:14 2015 UTC,"Best advice I ever got was if you get confused, just plow through. I was hooked on Book 1 and it was a wild ride to the end."

I REALLY recommend keeping pace with their readthrough as you go."
Malazan,2xo3ed,stanglemeir,9,Mon Mar 2 16:27:12 2015 UTC,"That's a good advice.   I'd just advise some caution with Bill's comments.   There are two people doing the Tor reread, Amanda and Bill. Amanda is reading for the first time but Bill is, well, rereading the series. Hence he drops some minor to 'oh, fuck, are you serious?!' spoilers from time to time.   When I noticed it, I decided to skip his comments until finishing each book - so I was reading the chapters summary and Amanda's.   But turns out Amanda is often quite clueless, beyond even myself.  My personal solution?   I keep pace with the rereading, skipping Bill's comments until I complete one quarter of the book. So every 25% I read, I go back and read what he has to say.   It's not flawless, but suits me well.   Oh, stay away from users comments. WIDE AWAY."

Malazan,2xo3ed,Heron78,6,Mon Mar 2 19:19:46 2015 UTC,"This is actually the exact thing I did (except I powered through WoT in 3 months). I will warn you. WoT is an extremely deep and wonderful world but Jordan eases you into it. Erikson is going to shove you into the thrashing maelstrom that is the Malazan world and expect you to swim or drown. So I'll give you a few points that'll help the transition.  You will be confused. The world is much more complicated. Power through and things will be slowly explained.  Everything is connected. Any odd little tangents, or side characters are important to the overall arc of the series (even if it's 5 books later)  It's darker and less clear. Wheel of Time, at it's core, is still a standard good versus evil story. The line is clear between the forces of the Dark One and the good guys. Malazan has no such lines. You will often see both sides of a conflict (in Midnight Tides especially) and like characters on both sides. There are few characters that can be considered good or evil in truth.  Erikson will take your feelings, mold them into something beautiful and then stomp them into the ground with cleats. Be prepared to be so angry you'll want to throw your book at the wall. Be prepared to laugh so hard you'll wake other people up. And be prepared to be so sad you'll probably cry."

Erickson throws you in a busy kitchen and expects you to figure out the meal with only half the ingredients visible. Jordan is fun, Erickson is engrossing, you can actually see the foundations of his world and the connections and connotations each has. You'll have some ah-ha moments that are unbelievable as you connect actions by characters who never meet across continents and books.

Malazan,2xo3ed,Silcha,3,Mon Mar 2 20:14:08 2015 UTC,"I am slightly concerned for you.  MBotF requires far more investment from the reader than WoT.  If you had to stop partway through WoT a few times, you're definitely going to feel tempted at some point in MBotF.  All of the books start of slow, but if there's 1 thing Erikson does more than any other author I've ever read, it's end a book.  The way things all rush together at the end, so much happens in the last half of every book that it's a bit ridiculous.  Anyway, my advice is just to stick with it and power through any slow parts.  It will get better before the book is over...in every single book."

Malazan,2xloed,CaptainUnusual,10,Sun Mar 1 21:56:00 2015 UTC,"I think it isn't all too uncommon a reaction, so I don't think you're alone. Personally I was totally floored by it; despite the events in Deadhouse Gates, for me Whiskeyjack was the first character who definitely wasn't 'supposed' to die. Even though plenty of hints were there, I naively thought that authors just don't kill characters like him, it just isn't done.  Since then I've read a little more widely, and come to realise that it isn't as unheard of as I thought at the time, but for someone who grew up reading fantasy series that generally refused to kill characters I deemed important, it was a pretty big moment (in particular because I didn't really expect Kallor to 'win' there).   As to the character himself, I think Whiskeyjack comes to life a little bit more on subsequent reads. Knowing what happens here I think it makes things he says and does in the previous two books a little more emotionally impacting. In particular, I think his relationship with Anomander Rake is really something."
Malazan,2xloed,Nimander23,7,Sun Mar 1 23:22:45 2015 UTC,"It was at this point in the series that I remembered the name of it was The Malazan Book of the Fallen. It's not like I didn't know, but that fact someone how seemed to elude me until then. He was the first larger than life character to die. This is when I realized no one was safe.   It certainly didn't hit me has hard as Itkovian's death (one of only two scenes that actually brought a tear to my eye), but it still hit hard.   Reflecting on it I never felt any real attachment to Whiskeyjack. Instead I was attached to the Bridgeburners and Rake, and it was their awe and respect for Whiskeyjack that I felt vicariously through them. I'm doing a re-read now and just started MoI and this fact seems to cement itself more the further I get.  I wasn't sad that Whiskeyjack died, I was sad for Korlat, Dujek, Picker, Blend and the rest, because they were going to be sad that Whiskeyjack is dead."
Malazan,2xloed,frankhorse,5,Mon Mar 2 00:02:45 2015 UTC,Itkovian's burial was the single hardest thing I've ever read. It utterly destroyed me emotionally. That was most definitely the Malazan point of no return for me. DG and the Chain of Dogs and it's conclusion was beyond belief but the raw emotion of that burial was unbelievable.
Malazan,2xloed,linuxcloud,15,Mon Mar 2 00:28:48 2015 UTC,"This is off topic, but I think titles such as this should be discouraged. I know nothing is explicitly stated, but the title implies something big happens with Whiskeyjack in MoI. And that often means death in this series.  I personally recently finished Reaper's Gale, and the moment I encounted RG I knew he was a dead man. People on this sub occasionally post comments like RG in threads that aren't marked with spoilers. And while that technically doesn't tell me anything, I still knew.  Anyway, I'd be interested to hear what others think."
Malazan,2xloed,PaxCecilia,3,Mon Mar 2 03:36:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I posted a similar opinion in a thread a while back which contained spoilers in the title, and I got downvoted a bunch.  I have to admit though, I accidentally hovered over the spoiler text while I was scrolling through this thread and I'm still in the first book of RG... D'oh!"
Malazan,2xloed,linuxcloud,1 point,Mon Mar 2 12:50:39 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I'm sorry. I was hesitant to post a RG spoiler (even a marked one) in a MoI thread, but I figured that was the best way to get my point across. If it's any consolation, an /r/fantasy user spoiled the ending of Toll the Hounds for me in a non-Malazan thread without marking any spoilers (I'm about halfway through TtH right now)."

I've had 3 deaths spoiled for me like that. Each time I tried to push it out of my mind and pretend that person was referring to something other than death, and each time I was wrong. Stop, please. It's ridiculous and unfair. Everyone knows what you're saying and it isn't clever, it isn't some secret inside joke, it's a fucking spoiler. Not necessarily referring to this post, because this one wasn't bad, but I have seen it in almost every thread and you'd think people who love this series so much would care more for other people enjoying it the way they did. Especially considering how much everyone wants to here new reader's reactions."
Malazan,2xloed,Mabus5,2,Mon Mar 2 07:47:02 2015 UTC,Aww man I am so sorry if it was me that spoiled the RG Spoiler. You are totally right that the title can spoil it. I will be careful when posting. I hate spoilers and to know that I spoiled a big moment in such an epic series makes me feel like sh*t :/
Malazan,2xloed,linuxcloud,1 point,Mon Mar 2 23:07:47 2015 UTC,"No worries, it wasn't you. I finished RG sometime in January; I recall reading these sorts of comments early on in the series and wondering when that character was finally going to show up.  Luckily, I felt his death was foreshadowed pretty heavily and it was still an emotional moment."

To me, the moment you navigate to this subreddit you are officially gambling with spoilers, no matter how anyone else comports themselves in posting them.

Malazan,2xloed,aleifur,-1,Tue Mar 3 17:25:59 2015 UTC,"While I agree that it implies something important happens, it doesn't imply what. I could have titled it ""so, about ganoes in moi"", and maybe you'd assume he died, but he didn't, so it's not a spoiler. Obviously, yes, having a discussion about a character means that something significant happens, but characters do enough interesting things other than dying that I don't think it's a real concern."
Malazan,2xloed,linuxcloud,4,Mon Mar 2 03:47:33 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's not really a spoiler but better safe than sorry. I think it's a good rule of thumb to exclude (most) names from titles or use misdirection of some sort:   So, about whiskeyjack [Spoilers up to MoI]   Implying that you are talking about him/his role up to that point.  My policy has been to be super careful because I'd hate to spoil this series for other people."
Malazan,2xloed,future_forward,3,Mon Mar 2 12:57:26 2015 UTC,"I am not even sure that the name has anything to do with it, to be honest. Had I read the following title, I would not have suspected anything.   Questions about Whiskeyjack [Spoilers up to MoI]   There's something about the wording of this one that suggests something more. Saying ""So, about X"" almost sounds like spreading gossip.  As I said earlier, there's no explicit spoiler here. However, had I read this thread title before finishing MoI I would have assumed."
Malazan,2xloed,Georgraphy,5,Mon Mar 2 13:21:27 2015 UTC,"It's an affective death, but I'm kind of with you. For me, it always played as a realistically banal and meaningless death as a byproduct of war. (And I mean that as praise.) But it doesn't carry the dread emotions that some of the smaller deaths throughout the series do. Dukier in DG was probably the roughest death I'd read until this point."

Malazan,2xloed,aleifur,1 point,Tue Mar 3 00:46:26 2015 UTC,Interesting that you feel like that. I was pretty devastated by his death.

Frankly, any book that makes me want to throw it is a good book. The writing affected me emotionally enough to make me want to throw it out the window. That's good writing."
Malazan,2xlcb4,TriscuitCracker,3,Sun Mar 1 21:23:55 2015 UTC,"The worst part for me was Whiskeyjack...I'll write up some more when I'm not on mobile, but that was brutal."

Malazan,2xlcb4,MellowHallow,5,Mon Mar 2 14:15:31 2015 UTC,The next book is good. I had to power through the beginning but it was quite good.   Yep it was powerful stuff. I honestly found the second book to be the most viscerally (unpleasantly at times) intense. Felisin was almost too tragic and depressing. With some of the nobility on the chain making me so very angry.   MOI had quite a bit of upsetting deaths. I guess I kind of expect it. The tenescrow were rough to read about. Erikson really created powerful examples for me of good and bad but mostly grey.

I remember when they had one of these things on Deadliest Warrior, and everyone was oohing and ahing over how fancy its spins were, and then when they tested it against a pig carcass, it could basically make some shallow cuts then flop to the floor. It's kind of a terrible weapon."
Malazan,2xhi62,Whales96,3,Sat Feb 28 22:02:25 2015 UTC,Seems like it's more to cause pain than to kill.
Malazan,2xhi62,Silcha,2,Sat Feb 28 22:30:13 2015 UTC,Erikson might have known about these since was an archaeologist is its possible he knew when he wrote about the Awl's weapons.
Malazan,2xhhtt,StormyGesler,6,Sat Feb 28 19:14:32 2015 UTC,"No, there was not a First Sword after Dassem.

Not sure exactly where, but it is in there somewhere :)"

Malazan,2xfwhw,aleifur,1 point,Sat Feb 28 08:33:13 2015 UTC,We are shown a characters heart breaking ignorance on such a subject at other times in the series   TGC  as well as so much of Mappo Icarium.
Malazan,2xfwhw,MoranthMunitions,5,Sat Feb 28 22:19:42 2015 UTC,"I thought the crucifixion of all of the soldiers was way more brutal than Coltaine's death. With Coltaine you knew the moment it happened he was going to be reborn because of the crows, while the surrender you could see coming and knew it was inevitable. Then later on it's mentioned that Mappo, after leaving the Azath, has been walking for days and there's constantly been corpses along the road. At least the scene a little later with Rudd and Irp collecting Duiker's body and soul was kind of funny."

Malazan,2xfwhw,ddidiodion,1 point,Sat Feb 28 23:54:46 2015 UTC,"Couldn't it also have just been a figurative thing?

Malazan,2xdutd,Mabus5,7,Fri Feb 27 19:38:23 2015 UTC,"Finished the book myself like 2 days ago.  The part where Quick Ben fights the 3 Sisters, and then Hedge just obliterates one of them with a cusser is amazing. Also the part where Silchas Ruin is about to go ham on Letheras, but a couple of moranth munitions take care of him as well and has to retreat.  I loved all the scenes that had Trull or Onrack in them, and to have Kilava back was also interesting, I believe she last appeared on Memories of Ice. But the scene where that fucking asshole of a letherii backstabs Trull...fuck that guy. I despise pretty much all of the letherii except for the Tehols and Shurq, because of assholes like him, Karos Invictad and his ""assistant"" I forgot the name of.  Seeing living (not resurrected I mean) K'Chain Che'malle was interesting, I got a sort of Native-American feel with the whole Awl tribe and Redmask. I was dissappointed in Redmask when he tried to ambush the letherii, it was a bad decision in my opinion since he didn't have any means to counter their formidable mages. That triple-kill by Toc was awesome though. Then all his guys got pretty much slaughtered at the final battle, but they dealt some damage to the letherii at least. I am really curious how the whole Bolkando-and-other-guys-alliance will work out. However, I was a bit dissappointed with the Toc and Grey Swords storyline. We don't hear much about them since MoI, I just read at the beginning of TtH that Pretty Minor TtH spoiler. I hope that we will find out more about them.  Beak sacrificing himself was another heartbreaking moment. I had a feeling before the actual scene, that  they sent the Edur behind them so they could annihilate them with that massive wave of magic as well. I think it really fit the character of Fiddler to let Hanradi Khalag and his Edur under Beak's ""ward"".  I am still not 100% sure how Samar Dev and Karsa managed to defeat Rhulad. As I saw it, Karsa tired Rhulad out, then purposely got himself stabbed in the leg, only to cut down Rhulad's sword hand. Then, just as Samar Dev made Kuru Qan get sucked into her knife, she did the same with Karsa and Rhulad. Then the 2 of them and Wither and his Tiste Andii wife end up on the Crippled God's island somehow, where Karsa cuts down Rhulad and then walks back into that portal.  As for the Malazans, it was amazing to see how well their tactics worked against foreign troops. I first thought that all the marines got deployed on the island in squads, but it was only like 1000-2000 ? I am still not sure about the number. I am curious how Tavore will keep all the troops together, since she isn't exactly a leader that would inspire loyalty, such as the late Whiskeyjack and Dujek were. But I already read a spoiler in a title of a thread. The Crippled God spoiler apparently   And I found it really funny how Tehol became the emperor of Lether. I actually lol'd on the  (empty) bus when I read that part around the end where he discusses with Janath and Bugg/Mael wheter or not he should keep a First Concubine.  And I am also curious if the Errant and Paran will meet adventually. Also, there is the part where the Errant meets Fener, and Fener's tusks made me wonder if he was a Jaghut before he ascended. Maybe he was a  tyrant, and that's how he became the God of War."
Malazan,2xdutd,bantuftw,3,Fri Feb 27 20:35:44 2015 UTC,Remember all of the souls Karsa has been carrying around? Well he was using them to sever his bond to the Crippled God thus killing him. Karsa by this point has collected a lot of souls.
Malazan,2xdutd,FR05TB1T3,1 point,Sat Feb 28 02:36:13 2015 UTC,I'm glad the bastard that took Trull is in eternal torment.  The Awl story was interesting. The whole buried alive thing? Fuck that.  I agree with the whole Native American vibe though.  And how about the K'Chain killing redmask? that was unexpected. and he was a Letheri?   Regarding Karsa I thought he knew where to go to end the sword's power but he needed help to get to the Crippled God so Samar unleashed the souls that were bound to help Karsa travel to the island. Plus that one guy sacrificed himself to unleash Tarthenal spirits to further help Karsa make it to the island. That's how I interpreted that part anyway.   Tehol and Brys reunited? that was great and yeah the Concubine part cracked me up too.  Plus who killed Hannan Mosag? I thought it was Fener at first but it was a female Jag. U
Malazan,2xdutd,bantuftw,1 point,Fri Feb 27 21:01:04 2015 UTC,"Plus who killed Hannan Mosag?   I think it was the female Jhag, who helped Kuru Qan to freeze the demon under the lake."

Loved the image burned into my head of all the Malazan ships burning. And Brys of course.  Loved the breakdown of just how vicious battle with the Malazans can be, it was great to see their tactics at work, even Helians lol. Icarium and Karsa FTW. Excellent book!  Some advice, you may want to just go straight to Toll the Hounds, you don't have to read the Esselmont books interspersed on your first read through.  But to each their own! Read how you want. Very glad you enjoyed it!"
Malazan,2xdutd,Tumblehawk,8,Fri Feb 27 20:00:55 2015 UTC,I really agree that you should just keep on with the main thrust of Erikson books here. Skipping over to Night of Knives might kill some momentum you have; it's a cool book but nowhere near as well-written or compelling. To me the last 5 books in the series (after the great sort of sidestep/interlude of Midnight Tides) just have such a steamrolling momentum...I wouldn't break that up (on your first read) if I were you!  And Toll the Hounds is just....incredible.
Malazan,2xdutd,TrevorAndCorey,5,Fri Feb 27 20:03:42 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. Toll the Hounds it is.

Malazan,2xdutd,DAMCARDLE,2,Fri Feb 27 22:54:20 2015 UTC,I loved Reaper's Gale. One of my favourites in the series. There are so many great moments. Some badass and others heartbreaking. Toc being in this book was a great surprise and enjoyed his moments a lot. I also loved Trull even more in this book. And the malazans.   As others have said I would go straight to Toll The Hounds and read ICE books after finishing the main series.

He was the leader of the Black Moranth, so he was about during a bunch of the meetings but didn't say anything, before flying the Bridgeburners up to the Barghast Range to make the alliance with the White Face Barghast. He explained a bunch of Trott's fight to Paran, then he flew off to pick up Mallet to save Trotts. Because he was there the Moranth were accepted by the Barghast spirits to be their descendants too. He notified the army that Taur was with them for Paran. He told Paran that the Moranth were the Barghast who didn't fight the Edur. At the end of the book he died during the battle at Coral (or it was mentioned afterwards that he did), but from the poison in his arm, and got thrown in the Moon's Spawn with all of the dead Bridgeburners.  So not a completely insignificant character, he gave probably the most insight on the Moranth in the main series. But not really a major character or anything, considering how many there it's not unreasonable to need a bit of prompting to remember him.  Edit: I'd missed the bit in GotM. Whiskeyjack asked a Black Moranth about a one-armed warrior and got told like 5 chapters later that he still lived. So no appearances there, but a mention."
Malazan,2x9q5d,Mabus5,2,Fri Feb 27 04:44:21 2015 UTC,"He is mainly in MoI, he was the leader of the black moranth that came with Dujeks host."
Malazan,2x9q5d,Jhistal,2,Fri Feb 27 04:22:03 2015 UTC,"I haven't finished the entire series yet, but hes had a supporting role inGotm and MOI."
Malazan,2x8u7g,JimmyTMalice,8,Thu Feb 26 16:25:44 2015 UTC,"Well, if memory serves, he doesn't go into the Shadow realm, he just uses the warren to mask his presence.   Secondly, I think the thing he does when he leaves his body behind is just a trick he knows. He's doesn't have his full powers and he's technically not really there. It's kind of like when gods show up. They're not really manifesting physically in the mortal realm (like what happened to Fener in DG), they're just spiritually there.  Honestly, it is all very confusing and I probably don't understand a lot of either but I trick myself into thinking I understand it so that's good enough for me lol."
Malazan,2x8u7g,SerBronnofBlackwater,1 point,Thu Feb 26 16:37:27 2015 UTC,this is probably the correct answer on the first read. it's part of the journey that one does not understand everything.
Malazan,2x8u7g,xHiKaene3zYnhavzaUqV,2,Sat Feb 28 04:09:58 2015 UTC,"In my opinion mage could travel through the element of warren(Ruse-water, D'riss-stone/earth, Serc-air), also through the warren itself, in meaning of the realm itself.  And certainly he has some upper hand in being a high mage with souls of 12 different mages."
Malazan,2x8u7g,BlackViperMWG,1 point,Sun Mar 1 11:06:06 2015 UTC,Ben is also a master of illusion and shadow. That's his speciality so that might play into his tricks. He's probably just using a trick he picked up.
Malazan,2x8u7g,Silcha,1 point,Thu Feb 26 18:06:49 2015 UTC,"Well...shouldn't really compare Quick Ben to normal mages but the warrens are layered on top of ""the real world,"" they exist in the same space.     I also remember someone say, Kellanved I think, that Shadow is different from the other Warrens and by its nature can appear anywhere except in pure darkness.  The non-corporeal thing Ben does is one of his abilities from the doll/spirit life magic that he, Bottle and few others have access to, in different ways."
Malazan,2x8u7g,Capt91,0,Fri Feb 27 15:50:20 2015 UTC,My bad.
Malazan,2x62lr,Mabus5,24,Wed Feb 25 23:09:38 2015 UTC,"No, I did not almost cry when Beak sacrificed himself. I did not almost cry when he thought about wanting a kiss on the cheek, or for ""something far more brave"". I did not almost cry when Beak got to be with his brother.

Malazan,2x62lr,bhunter904,8,Thu Feb 26 06:41:57 2015 UTC,One of the many parts of the series that brought me almost to tears. Whiskyjack and Chain of Dogs also hit me really hard.
Malazan,2x62lr,AllWrong74,4,Thu Feb 26 02:39:21 2015 UTC,Don't forget Toll the Hounds Spoilers
Malazan,2x62lr,TheHopelessGamer,2,Thu Feb 26 06:44:05 2015 UTC,That first death you mentioned but also the one that immediately preceded it was pretty much the most shocking thing I've ever read in a fantasy novel. Like I was at Red Wedding levels of disbelief that such things could happen.
Malazan,2x62lr,xHiKaene3zYnhavzaUqV,1 point,Thu Feb 26 13:49:35 2015 UTC,to this day i still carry with me the chain of dogs.   i honestly fear going through that again. and i'm 45% of DhG! it feels like being sucker punched by a brick wall.
Malazan,2x62lr,xolotl92,12,Sat Feb 28 07:10:17 2015 UTC,I might have thought about crying but didn't actually cry because i am a tough man who doesn't cry over a book...but maybe my chest tightened up (due to probably health issues) and maybe my eyes started to water (due to dust and things).
Malazan,2x62lr,Ganoes-Stabro_Paran,4,Thu Feb 26 00:17:21 2015 UTC,"I am a tough man, and almost all my crying was rage-cries; you know where you start breathing and blinking rapidly and you want to go kill something while individual tears start coursing down from your eyes.      spoiler- all books everytime humanity stood up and said ""Fuck You!"" made me rage-cry."
Malazan,2x62lr,mr_me100,4,Thu Feb 26 10:18:30 2015 UTC,just reading this thread made me tear up ffs
Malazan,2x62lr,turnpikenorth,5,Thu Feb 26 00:31:42 2015 UTC,"Fucking beak man.  I am rereading Reapers Gale right now and every paragraph of his now knowing it's leading up to THAT, some of the most tragic shit I have ever read."
Malazan,2x62lr,sielias,2,Thu Feb 26 04:41:45 2015 UTC,"I'm doing the same! And I know exactly how you feel... It might even be worse the second time around, the rereads always flush out all the stuff i missed the first time around!"
Malazan,2x62lr,SerBronnofBlackwater,7,Thu Feb 26 17:28:43 2015 UTC,Ugh. Why'd you remind me of this. Beak breaks my heart every time.
Malazan,2x62lr,ItkovianShieldAnvil,6,Thu Feb 26 04:54:45 2015 UTC,"Dude, that was one of the greatest moments in the series, so far (that was the last one I have read. Need audible to get next audiobook so I can listen at work) just that whole sequence blew my mind. Stormy with the golden beard and Fiddler's reaction with ""that's the most obnobnoxious thing I've ever seen"" helped lighten the mmoment,  but damn.... that poor guy just wanted to love and be loved. His whole story I just wanted to reach into that world and hug him and tell him I would be his buddy."
Malazan,2x62lr,sielias,2,Thu Feb 26 05:14:14 2015 UTC,"Wait, there are audiobooks!?"
Malazan,2x62lr,ItkovianShieldAnvil,2,Thu Feb 26 17:29:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah bro. I finished 2 books in as many weeks and it has taken me three years to get as far as I am. I get too distracted by things. I need to be moving and interacting so I don't sit and read. Like I said, though, this book was the last available. The guy who read it gave beak a perfect voice. Suited the character very nicely."
Malazan,2x62lr,AllWrong74,3,Fri Feb 27 06:11:27 2015 UTC,"A more appropriate question would be ""Did anyone not cry when Beak sacrificed himself?""  In a series with some seriously heart-rending moments, this was probably the most heart-rending moment.  As I always say when someone brings up Beak (or Serenity Spoiler):   Still too soon."
Malazan,2x62lr,PromisedPrince694,3,Thu Feb 26 06:36:56 2015 UTC,Let's not forget that Buffy series finale too :(
Malazan,2x62lr,AllWrong74,5,Thu Feb 26 10:56:47 2015 UTC,"Jesus Christ, dude.  Now I'm gonna be all super depressed.  We might as well bring up Fry's dog from the Jurrasic Bark episode of Futurama while we're at it. *8("
Malazan,2x62lr,cowboys703,4,Thu Feb 26 11:40:47 2015 UTC,I think Reaper's Gale might be my favorite of the entire series. The whole lead up to that point with Beak is amazing. The marines just murdering their way across an entire continent. Nothing going as planned. They sink into the depths of depravity with all the trophy hunting and brutal guerrilla tactics.
Malazan,2x62lr,Czarcastick,7,Thu Feb 26 17:06:31 2015 UTC,How does an author even write something that touching or sad lol I imagine Steve sitting in a room light by candles with a couple bottles of wine empty and some old record playing. Just such a great story in that one I can't think about it lol. Rip Beak.
Malazan,2x62lr,elr0nd_hubbard,15,Thu Feb 26 02:39:33 2015 UTC,A room lit by candles...until all of the candles burn out. :(
Malazan,2x62lr,Czarcastick,3,Thu Feb 26 02:58:20 2015 UTC,Fuck didn't even think of that when I wrote that comment lol maybe that's where the idea for that came from.
Malazan,2x62lr,AllWrong74,3,Thu Feb 26 03:04:42 2015 UTC,"What makes it even more amazing is that Beak is an extremely minor plotline, yet it has probably the largest emotional impact in the entire series."
Malazan,2x62lr,YearOfTheMoose,6,Thu Feb 26 06:39:28 2015 UTC,"I feel bad; I didn't actually cry for Beak. I felt kind of sad, but neither his plotline nor Murillio's made me remotely as sad as any of the other prominent deaths mentioned (with spoiler tags which I'm too lazy to also use) in this thread, or (I lied, SPOILERS ALL)"
Malazan,2x62lr,AllWrong74,5,Fri Feb 27 05:51:09 2015 UTC,I agree wholeheartedly with your last bit.  tCG Spoiler    EDIT:  So...I guess I stand corrected.  Beak didn't have the largest emotional impact.  An even smaller plotline did.
Malazan,2x62lr,YearOfTheMoose,3,Fri Feb 27 06:10:37 2015 UTC,"I seriously made it to that point without my eyes welling over, and then I just bawled for an hour or so. :("
Malazan,2x62lr,AllWrong74,5,Fri Feb 27 06:12:33 2015 UTC,"The last time I cried while reading a book was when I was 13.  I read Where the Red Fern Grows and Old Yeller back-to-back.  With Malazan, I cried over Series spoilers"
Malazan,2x62lr,YearOfTheMoose,4,Fri Feb 27 06:15:46 2015 UTC,"What the hell, man! What could possess you to do that?!   When I read Where the Red Fern Grows I got to the part where the first one dies and he cries on the riverbank....and then all of the remaining pages of the book (literally past the line ""In the grey light of a breaking dawn I cried until I could cry no more,"" which is permanently seared into my memory) were torn out. It was three more years before I could get a new copy, read it, and find out how the story resolved. Three years of no catharsis. My preteen years were pretty traumatized for no better reason than that. XD On the other hand, it was basically my favourite YA book after White Fang, so..."
Malazan,2x62lr,AllWrong74,3,Fri Feb 27 06:19:55 2015 UTC,"What the hell, man! What could possess you to do that?!   We had to do book reports.  There was a list of acceptable books.  I had heard both books were good, so I picked them.  I did Where the Red Fern Grows, turned in the tear-stained report, and started on Old Yeller as the next assignment.  I'm pretty sure my teacher was laughing to herself about what I was about to go through when I picked those two books.  EDIT:  I should mention it was a series of 5 book reports.  I don't even remember what the other three books were, I was so traumatized."
Malazan,2x62lr,YearOfTheMoose,4,Fri Feb 27 06:45:06 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, that's horrible.   Also.....have we discussed this before? It seems like a really familiar conversation. o_O"
Malazan,2x62lr,AllWrong74,3,Fri Feb 27 06:51:31 2015 UTC,I think we might have.  Some of your comments seem naggingly familiar.

Malazan,2x62lr,WonTonBurritoMeals,2,Thu Feb 26 20:27:45 2015 UTC,"Oh man,  Yea saddest part of the whole series so far for me. Been slacking on book 8 maybe gotta pick it up.  PS- I named my character Beak in Wildstar when I played it. We tried to nab ""the bridgeburners"" for our guild name but we got the bonehunters, and a bunch of us had Malazan names."

Malazan,2x76z7,Nyanmaru_San,7,Thu Feb 26 04:39:30 2015 UTC,"This is like an argument for a penny on a train being why Ted Mosby doesn't get his dream job. (HIMYM reference, first thing I thought of).  The Thurmataugs are the reason the CG was brought down. You could say that they wanted Kallor dead because he was evil. But Blood and Bone showed us that the Thumataugs were selfish assholes who resented being powerless under Kallor.  Kallor was a dick but he wasn't any different than most emperors in Malazan history or our own."
Malazan,2x76z7,SerBronnofBlackwater,3,Thu Feb 26 05:35:30 2015 UTC,"True, but he's the linchpin of the whole series.  I still believe that if you remove him from the equation, there wouldn't have been a need to call down Kaminsod.  And I'm not trying to start a ""he's so evil"" argument.  When you get right down to it, everyone in the series is Evil in one way or another.  I just want to discuss how he is central to the whole series."
Malazan,2x76z7,SerBronnofBlackwater,1 point,Thu Feb 26 05:56:18 2015 UTC,Oh ok. Then I agree! :)
Malazan,2x76z7,Giotto,1 point,Thu Feb 26 15:05:00 2015 UTC,"Have to admit he did trigger many events.  But in some cases, like calling down the crippled god, you might say if they didn't do it to stop Kallor, it would've been against someone else. Anyone more powerful than them and trying to oppress them could've triggered that response, and there are plenty of villains in the series who likely could and would've done so."
Malazan,2x76z7,AreYouReadyToReddit,1 point,Fri Feb 27 05:48:23 2015 UTC,"True.  But I don't think anyone would have been there to trigger the rest of the events to ""save"" the world and tie off the loose ends."
Malazan,2x76z7,AreYouReadyToReddit,2,Fri Feb 27 06:00:03 2015 UTC,"He was so terrible that his people summoned down the Kaminsod, becoming the Crippled God.   That's like blaming the Japanese for being so fanatical the U.S. ""had"" to use the atomic bomb. Or Kennedy is responsible for the path of the bullet that caused his assassination.  Those 8 mages could simply have left the empire for warmer shores. (ie, The First Empire)."
Malazan,2x76z7,Tumblehawk,0,Thu Feb 26 20:13:26 2015 UTC,"But they didn't. That's what happens when you have two idiots with that much power. They bring down Kaminsod, Kallor sacrifices everyone to curse some gods. Nobody wins.   Like I said before, you remove him from the equation, there would be no books."

Malazan,2x4euu,Mabus5,1 point,Wed Feb 25 19:11:14 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with OP and this dude here.  Everyone's shrugging all the time it's so annoying.

Malazan,2x4euu,85pctofyouhavetogo,3,Fri Feb 27 05:44:27 2015 UTC,"It's a very long series written entirely by a single guy.  Eventually you are going to see repetition, everyone finds it somewhere. For myself, I'm rarely bothered by certain types of repetition (for instance I don't mind things such as the fact that he likes the color ochre, and none of Nyneave's habits in WoT bother me). The one that gets me is ""rotten/rotting/rotted ice"", which is just supposed to describe ice that has become pitted and weakened from slowly melting, but every time I see it I think of ice with a lot of decaying organic matter being exposed as it melts. And he uses the phrase all the time."

Malazan,2x4euu,ClassicalMusicTroll,2,Thu Feb 26 22:37:16 2015 UTC,For me it was 'baring teeth' and other variations. I don't think I've ever seen a human do that. At least humans shrug.

I can see she has mail, but it appears to be a thin strip on top of her red surcoat, so it doesn't really help much.   If it's because she is a cadre mage, and you don't envision her needing that much armour, I'd suggest removing it entirely. In her description, armour isn't mentioned at all, just that she wears a burgondy cloak on which there is a silver emblem of her rank as Commander."

They have basically left behind all of the emotions and motivations they held in life, and now they see everything in black and white extremes.  To the Imass, you are either someone who needs to be killed, or you are more or less ignored (excepting those rare instances where there is a shared enemy involved).  Onrack is entirely unique in that he has broken free from his tribe, and everything that he experienced in life before the ritual is slowly coming back to him, things like basic empathy, lust, sorrow and anger.  Onrack's relationship with Trull is really interesting, because Trull helps bring all of that out in Onrack.  You will find out in Midnight Tides why empathy is so important to Trull, which will in turn explain a lot about Trull's friendship with Onrack."
Malazan,2x10xo,Ganoes-Stabro_Paran,5,Tue Feb 24 20:29:27 2015 UTC,"Jon Snow beats Beowulf? Hell no.   Also, QB should beat the shit out of Vin. iirc Vin wasn't even that good at anything, at least not in comparison to QB. (not sure who won)  This is kinda why these shouldn't be operated via polls. The more popular character wins."
Malazan,2x10xo,Nichase,3,Wed Feb 25 01:34:46 2015 UTC,"Vin was considered an incredibly gifted Mistborn and naturally talented fighter. But considering that she is just a Mistborn, it's not even a competition, in Quick Ben's world she would almost be beneath notice of him."
Malazan,2x10xo,SageOfTheWise,2,Wed Feb 25 02:33:47 2015 UTC,"Quick Ben wins. If you read the story, basically they go into the match not knowing anything about the other, so Quick Ben gets tripped up a bit before he can figure out anything metal related is useless, plus Vin starts with Atium which if nothing else is going to make her near impossible to kill while it lasts, even if she can't do much back. Then he figures out the metal thing, and the atium runs out, and Quick wipes the floor with her.   I don't know how you'd say 'Vin wasn't even that good at anything' though.  I mean yeah, I don't see a scenario in which Vin beats Quick Ben that doesn't involve some ridiculous luck. (unless we're considering that brief period Vin was basically god, but that's not an accurate measure of the character so I assume we aren't). But she is still like the best in her entire series at magic used for combat."
Malazan,2x10xo,Nichase,4,Wed Feb 25 03:16:58 2015 UTC,Vin was powerful but she was nothing compared to QB. I think QB could have even killed her with the Atium. It's my opinion that we never really saw the most powerful that QB could have been.
Malazan,2x10xo,SageOfTheWise,2,Wed Feb 25 04:01:41 2015 UTC,"Sure, I agree that Vin is nothing compared to Quick Ben. Quick Ben, at 100% capability, would likely annihilate even Vin with Atium in seconds. But that's not how Quick Ben fights. His method is to reveal as little as himself as possible to complete the battle. That's why the theoretical match lasts as 'long' as it does. Quick starts out with much easier mundane stuff that Vin can compete with, even outdo, and then he ramps it up as needed."

Malazan,2wzqxa,PhumDuck,40,Tue Feb 24 14:46:05 2015 UTC,"So, part of the entire point of the sorcery battle at Pale is that it's impossible to put together the story 100%. It's kind of making a point about the immense chaos of war. You have all these really powerful people in a powder keg in the middle of a warzone and the exact chain of events are just unknowable, its all a mess.  That being said, here's the best I've been able to put together. So you have Hairlock, Tattersail, Nightchill, Bellurdan, Calot, Tayschrenn, and A'Karonys. First, Nightchill is secretly using this entire battle as an attempt to weaken/take out Anomander so she can get Dragnipur and free her brother Draconus. A'Karonys gets knowledge of this plan somehow and warns Tayschrenn. (I forget how A'Karonys learns of this but I believe this is part of Tays' explanation in MoI). Nightchill kills A'Karonys in the battle for this betrayal. Tayschrenn see's this and retaliates by unleashing a demon that tears Nightchill apart. Bellurdan freaks out and gets busy killing the demon.  Meanwhile, Hairlock is already all crazy paranoid that everyone is out to get him, in particular that Tayschrenn is going to kill him (I'd have to reread GotM to see if/what his particular claimed motivations are). He's already taken out Quick Ben's insurance plan in the event of his death. He see's the above start happening, immediatly decides all his fears were right and starts gunning for Tayschrenn. Tayschrenn attacks him back in self defense, and this is where things get the least clear, but it seems that Calot and Tattersail are hit as collateral damage of Tayschrenn's attack on Hairlock. They're hit by fire magic that couldn't be coming from anyone but Tay, but at the same time, Tay has no reason to kill Calot, and actively wants Tattersail alive. Collateral damage is the only explanation I've got. Anyway, then Calot dies protecting Tattersail."
Malazan,2wzqxa,SageOfTheWise,15,Tue Feb 24 15:40:25 2015 UTC,"Wow, I didn't realize how unclear I was about this until you explained that. This entire time I've been thinking of Tasychrenn as a villain. Great play by play"
Malazan,2wzqxa,Eltotsira,3,Tue Feb 24 16:12:12 2015 UTC,Thanks for your input I just have one question. Do we know that Hairlock attacked Tayschrenn? Or is that something was put together to give us a reason for an otherwise senseless attack.
Malazan,2wzqxa,Giotto,3,Tue Feb 24 16:19:50 2015 UTC,great explanation here

Malazan,2wzqxa,Silmariel,5,Tue Feb 24 15:48:01 2015 UTC,"Rake has a convo with Baruk describing the events, where he basically states Taychrenn just deflected his attacks on to his own soldiers, and that he (rake) had tried to make the price too high. Both Calot and Hairlock probably died that way."
Malazan,2wzqxa,MoranthMunitions,6,Tue Feb 24 15:26:11 2015 UTC,"A dun tone had entered Rake's eyes. 'I cannot defend an entire Moon. I cannot be everywhere at once. And as for Tayschrenn, he didn't give a damn about the people around him. I thought to dissuade him, make the price too high ...' He shook his head as if perplexed, then he looked to Baruk. 'To save the home of my people, I retreated.'   Yeah I know the one, but that's not what he says. Just that he wasn't defending people around him, concentrating on attacking. It doesn't say he was maliciously deflecting them onto his own side. That's pretty cold, but obviously it worked despite his entire cadre fucking each other over, if they'd actually done what was planned there probably wouldn't have even been many losses that way. Tayschrenn is a lot more human, in that he doesn't seem like he was out to kill everyone, in the later books.  Anyway, the link that you posted and the comment that I linked to both say pretty much the same thing, there's just more depth to the discussion on yours."
Malazan,2wzqxa,Silmariel,1 point,Tue Feb 24 15:41:49 2015 UTC,"In the later books especially and also in the entire ICE series Tayschrenn is an incredibly sympathetic character. In GoTM not so much. - Its allways been a bit of a weird skizoid element in the books for me, that he caused so much collateral damage on the people under his command at Pale, because of how sympathetic his character later becomes. I certainly did not like him in GotM."

Malazan,2wywq8,gorfuin,8,Tue Feb 24 07:53:21 2015 UTC,"It may be that they can walk the mortal world if they prepare themselves, but Fener was pulled in.

Malazan,2wywq8,CaptainUnusual,3,Tue Feb 24 11:20:38 2015 UTC,"Spoliers through RG: Yea, I also had a tough time understanding why this is such a big deal for fener as opposed to other gods of all varieties, and the scuba gear is a pretty apt simile for his situation. It may also have to do with his inability to actually act on anything much, answering prayers and the like are impossible for him (there's that one scene with [ is it Bugg or the Errant??] where he complains about all the noise in his head from the prayers being deafening and being powerless to act at all on them.   All the other gods are cognizant of their limitations and make sure to not overextend themselves too much lest they get taken advantage of, but they do make mistakes, example: Bugg went and got angry and went for a full unveiling of his powers when he got upset about janal and tehol getting nabbed, dude came on too strong in one place and got his ass trapped in a rock.   Lesson: be more like shadowthrone and never fully unveil your powers or show up all constituted in one single vessel, it's how you get taken advantage of, by gods and mere mortals alike. There's rules of magical physics abound in these books that govern everyone, even the elder gods........... unless you're war leader Karsa Orlong I guess, in which case, disregard everything."
Malazan,2wywq8,theaggrokrag,3,Tue Feb 24 12:45:42 2015 UTC,"This is it. His entire essence was drawn forth into the mortal realm. This made him vulnerable similarly to the way Hood and Poliel were, killable through mundane means."
Malazan,2wywq8,DumpTruckJester,3,Tue Feb 24 13:19:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I'm wording and or recalling it right, but this is the gist of it: his faith is under attack, the god himself is weakened by it and he has been forced 'down' onto the material world of the Malazan Empire where he can be attacked and killed. Permanently.  Shadowthrone for example always projects a part of himself out of the shadow realm to converse and convey with others. Say you slay that aspect, you might damage his integrity but most likely not inflict all too much damage. Then there's K'rul and co (Keruli from MoI) who seem to walk along the mortals without a worry on their mind. They, however, are elder gods. Yet, Nightchill got ripped to shreds - so who knows? I think a big part of what you're asking will never be given a clear-cut answer by Erikson :)"
Malazan,2wywq8,RebBrown,3,Tue Feb 24 11:13:56 2015 UTC,"I believe there's a difference between manifesting and entering. Hood appears several times; however, he doesn't enter into it until Darujistan and it was a monumental event."

Malazan,2wywq8,shonryukku,3,Mon Mar 2 04:20:44 2015 UTC,Gods are never fully on the mortal coil because then they are vulnerable. Fener was cast out of his realm and has to stay on the mortal realm fully. So he can't leave the mortal realm and is essentially no better than a mage at that point.
Malazan,2wywq8,SerBronnofBlackwater,3,Tue Feb 24 17:03:05 2015 UTC,"I am not sure how Erikson made his system, but if you draw parallels to, say, (A)D&D then a god is residing in some plane of existence beyond the normal world and any manifestation you see in your world is an avatar of said god. Slaying an avatar is a blow to the god, but since the power still resides where it should it can be recovered from. Now, if a god is pulled from his plane to the normal world, all bets are off, since any slaying of this manifestation would be final.  I think the GURPS system and/or Erikson's ideas are quite similar to this."
Malazan,2wxrai,Psychonaut117,11,Tue Feb 24 01:13:51 2015 UTC,"Toc's story got to me as well. More than that though was Itkovian. I was legitimately crying my eyes out at that part. The other part that got me, which was actually a very small part, was when Stonny was raped and how Gruntle reacted. The relationships are written so well in this series. They are just so natural. I can truly feel the love between characters. It really does get better, even though MOI was perhaps more packed with action. His writing only gets better, and the character growth and story progression really picks up and becomes a string point."
Malazan,2wxrai,nothingcleverleft,6,Tue Feb 24 01:44:14 2015 UTC,"Memories of Ice is the best fantasy novel I have ever read. Itkovian and his gift to the T'lan is also, arguably, the single best moment in any book I have ever read, topping many of the best moments in both other fantasy novels (say, some of the bits in The Second Apocalypse, which are often amazing) and in non-fantasy fiction novels (Anna Karenina being my go-to here, as it's my favorite book overall).  And I also cried the first time I read it. Whiskeyjack dying wasn't really a big part of it for me (that was more something that caused anger than anything else, as you said), but Itkovian, Toc, and Onos were a lot to handle. Only one other death mattered as much to me in the series as that of Itkovian, and you're still a ways off from that one."

Given the numerous accounts of Rake's prowess with the sword (and any sword, to be honest), as well as how his plans needed him to end up in Dragnipur, there is little room for doubt that the fight was always meant to end with him getting impaled by Dragnipur."
Malazan,2wvnyr,Montaron87,2,Mon Feb 23 19:17:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. I guess I'm not as convinced that he threw the fight as opposed to just knowingly fighting a superior swordsman.

Malazan,2wvnyr,RickyLidz,7,Tue Feb 24 00:53:24 2015 UTC,"It's pretty clear that the HOW of what happens in that fight was completely in the hands of Rake, as he needed to be killed with Dragnipur in such a way that it leaves the sword in the hands of people who he trusts would take care of it after he dies. Whether or not Dassem would've beaten him if Rake didn't actually want to die is unclear though."
Malazan,2wvnyr,Giotto,1 point,Tue Feb 24 10:05:33 2015 UTC,Right
Malazan,2wvnyr,Nyanmaru_San,3,Tue Feb 24 15:02:59 2015 UTC,"It's never explicitly stated, but also not that subtle...   We see from Samar Dev's point of view that something seemed wrong about the fight. Karsa then confirms this saying that someone was cheated (or something similar).   It's part of Rake's master plan."
Malazan,2wvnyr,Giotto,1 point,Mon Feb 23 19:15:29 2015 UTC,"Dassem himself is upset about the move, iirc."
Malazan,2wvnyr,SerBronnofBlackwater,1 point,Mon Feb 23 22:37:13 2015 UTC,"Oh, okay, gotcha. I guess that clears up that point for me then"
Malazan,2wvnyr,BirdBathandBeyond,1 point,Tue Feb 24 00:53:54 2015 UTC,I thought that was referring to the fact that Dassem was cheated of his vengeance on Hood.  Or it could be both.
Malazan,2wvnyr,ScottyBeans,1 point,Wed Feb 25 02:54:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think losing on purpose, regardless of how, implies Rake would be better. I think of them as equals."
Malazan,2wvnyr,BirdBathandBeyond,12,Mon Feb 23 22:39:10 2015 UTC,"Well if you have Mok in there then you gotta automatically put Jan in too and put him higher than Mok.  Also, I wouldn't have Mappo there at all or Onrack for that matter.   I would also put Blues and Fear."
Malazan,2wvnyr,SerBronnofBlackwater,1 point,Mon Feb 23 17:57:40 2015 UTC,"Who's Jan? And, I didn't put Fear because it was implied that Trull was a better warrior than he, and it didn't seem like he really stacked up to anyone else on the list. I can, however, definitely see taking Onrack off, though I'm not sure why you would take mappo off- he killed, what was it, four k'chain che'malle?"
Malazan,2wvnyr,SerBronnofBlackwater,5,Mon Feb 23 18:50:41 2015 UTC,"Jan is the Seguleh Second, he is covered extensively in Orb Sceptre Throne by Esselmont and I would say in pure sword fighting skill he is matched only by Rake and Dassem."
Malazan,2wvnyr,no_social_skills,3,Mon Feb 23 19:10:44 2015 UTC,I'd love to see a Mok vs Jan throwdown! They are brothers right?
Malazan,2wvnyr,SerBronnofBlackwater,1 point,Mon Feb 23 20:25:51 2015 UTC,"Oooo ya that would be great! I'm not sure if they are brothers though, can't remember."
Malazan,2wvnyr,no_social_skills,1 point,Mon Feb 23 20:28:44 2015 UTC,Yeah they were brothers. But Envy broke Mok so when he returned to the Seguleh he didn't want to be in the Agatii anymore.
Malazan,2wvnyr,SerBronnofBlackwater,1 point,Mon Feb 23 21:50:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just haven't read the esselmont ones, that's why I specified that I was referring to the main story"
Malazan,2wvnyr,no_social_skills,2,Tue Feb 24 00:54:46 2015 UTC,"Jan is the Second. You meet him in the ICE novel, Orb, Scepter and Throne. And Fear taught Trull everything he knows, it's stated multiple times that Fear was uncontested within the realm of the Tiste Edur when it can to the sword.  Also, when did Mappo kill K'Chain Che'Malle? I remember him killing 1 or two of Dejim Nehbral's D'ivers shape but that guy was easy, even Masan Gilani killed one lol."
Malazan,2wvnyr,SerBronnofBlackwater,4,Mon Feb 23 18:59:32 2015 UTC,I always thought that was before Trull went through all he did. Kinda seemed like he shot way past fear in terms of skill.
Malazan,2wvnyr,AnasterToc,2,Mon Feb 23 21:02:44 2015 UTC,I'm not saying Fear is better than Trull. I'm saying the best swordsman of the entire Tiste Edur deserves a spot.
Malazan,2wvnyr,BirdBathandBeyond,1 point,Mon Feb 23 21:10:29 2015 UTC,Could Fear be matched anywhere higher than the bottom of that list though?
Malazan,2wvnyr,titanemesis,1 point,Mon Feb 23 21:14:40 2015 UTC,Well we never see him fight so who knows. Also Silchas is someone else that should be on there.
Malazan,2wvnyr,BirdBathandBeyond,1 point,Mon Feb 23 21:18:17 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Silchas definitely should have been included."
Malazan,2wvnyr,no_social_skills,1 point,Mon Feb 23 21:19:54 2015 UTC,"I was gonna, but do we ever see him foght with just a sword?  Edit: forgot about when he slaughtered all those letherii lol"
Malazan,2wvnyr,abacabbx,3,Tue Feb 24 01:01:38 2015 UTC,He also beats Trull easily enough
Malazan,2wvnyr,nobadlinks,1 point,Tue Feb 24 03:47:27 2015 UTC,Interesting that such an apt spear wielder came from a master swordsman.
Malazan,2wvnyr,BirdBathandBeyond,1 point,Tue Feb 24 03:28:44 2015 UTC,"Oh, is that what was in that abandoned moonspawn? It's been a while since I read that bit- it was whenever he lost Icarium.   Edit: Oh, I didn't remember that about Fear."
Malazan,2wvnyr,nobadlinks,6,Tue Feb 24 00:56:00 2015 UTC,"I like to look at it like this, If you gave them all mundane versions of the weapons they use who would win in a duel.  I think it's tough to predict the assassins in this scenario because they aren't traditional stand and fight guys, that being said I'll try and fit them in.  Also I think it's impossible to rank Icarium because his level of skill varies so much.  Anyways this is who I would rank by pure skill:   Traveller Rake Seguleh second Cotillion Karsa Orlong Brys Beddict Trull  Mok  Yedan Deryg Undead Tool   I think Icarium could be inserted anywhere on this list depending on his level of rage.  Also I'm not sure on Cotillion, he could kill anyone on this list if he gets the drop on them but I'm unsure how he would do in standard duel."
Malazan,2wvnyr,BirdBathandBeyond,5,Mon Feb 23 16:55:54 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty solid collection of badasses.   That being said, I would put Spinnock Durav at least as high as Trull on this list. After all, he was entrusted by Rake himself to hold (and not kill) Kallor while Rake battled Traveller in Darujhistan. With nothing more special than his innate talent as a swordsman. Dude ain't nothing to fuck with.  Also, I personally think Rake and Traveller should switch places, but I totally understand why you've ranked them that way."
Malazan,2wvnyr,Montaron87,2,Mon Feb 23 19:48:56 2015 UTC,"Ya honestly I'm a little shaky on Trull, I'm not sure if he should be in there or not.  I could also see Rake and Traveller switching places depending on your preference.  I think with Dragnipur Rake wins but with normal swords Traveller edges him out after about 3 days of fighting."
Malazan,2wvnyr,titanemesis,7,Mon Feb 23 19:57:23 2015 UTC,"As for Trull, anyone that can 'hold the Lifestealer', while in his rage mode deserves to be on that list."
Malazan,2wvnyr,nobadlinks,2,Mon Feb 23 21:07:17 2015 UTC,Right? People forget so quickly that trull held icarium off for a bit.
Malazan,2wvnyr,titanemesis,6,Tue Feb 24 13:47:01 2015 UTC,Except you need to remember Traveler was wielding Vengeance/Grief at the time he took down Rake.  Even if you assume Rake didn't plan his death (and its pretty clear he did) you have to remember that Traveler was boosted by the sword during the duel too.
Malazan,2wvnyr,drae-,2,Mon Feb 23 21:22:45 2015 UTC,"O I know Rake wanted to die but you also have to remember Traveller didn't actually want to kill him.  Also, regarding Grief/Vengeance, I agree that it gives him a boost but I think Dragnipur is a bit more powerful (I've seen it argued that it's a 1 hit kill).  Anyways, that's why I said for this fight they would both be using mundane swords and I think it would be insanely close."
Malazan,2wvnyr,BirdBathandBeyond,6,Mon Feb 23 21:55:43 2015 UTC,"Vengeance will not let its wielder lose as long as their will allows them to fight on (Andarsit lacked the will and thus died).  It's an absurdly powerful weapon, and I think there is even some suggestion in the books that Rake actually made a mistake in choosing Dragnipur over his first sword.  Anyway, I agree.  Really close between them."
Malazan,2wvnyr,Montaron87,2,Mon Feb 23 22:12:26 2015 UTC,"Ahh fair enough, I don't remember that.  I'm just starting to reread the series (half way through GOTM)."
Malazan,2wvnyr,drae-,2,Mon Feb 23 22:16:18 2015 UTC,"there is even some suggestion in the books that Rake actually made a mistake in choosing Dragnipur over his first sword.   Could you explain what you remember about this? From my memory, it's never really said to be a mistake, as he's one of the few, if not the only person capable of wielding it and now falling under the pressure. The mistake in regards to the sword is that Rake stopped killing, so the amount of people dragging the cart starts to diminish, allowing chaos to catch up."
Malazan,2wvnyr,the_dayman,2,Tue Feb 24 10:10:19 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend reading Forge of Darkness, if you haven't yet: it will shed some light on this.  It's not outright mentioned, but you can gather from context that the sword isn't a blessing. I think it mistake boils down to the burden of wielding Dragnipur: there are multiple instances in Toll the Hounds where we see just how heavy the burden is (e.g. when he sets the sword down in Black Coral just for a few moments).   The moment he took it from Draconus, he would be condemned to sustaining it (or suffering the consequences). The need to constantly kill in order to serve a 'greater' good weighed heavily on Rake, who is not bloodthirsty at heart. It was a constant struggle to either damn his people (by letting Kurald Galain succumb to chaos), or to become the monster he was rumoured to be (and leaving a legacy of death, like Kallor).  By contrast, Vengeance / Grief fed off the emotions of the wielder, and would have sustained him as long as his conviction held (albeit by draining him in a different way).  They are both terrible weapons (in the sense that they come with a cost), but Dragnipur required someone truly exceptional to bear its burden, and ultimately destroy it."
Malazan,2wvnyr,Montaron87,1 point,Tue Feb 24 14:31:48 2015 UTC,"I can't remember.  I think it might be draconus or one of the other elders.  Basically discussing the fact that Rake went looking for another sword when he didn't need to. But, now that I think about it, it might have been a comment on Draconus choosing to make Dragnipur instead of being satisfied with his sword of darkness..."
Malazan,2wvnyr,NotATurdBurgler,4,Tue Feb 24 14:26:06 2015 UTC,"Oh I think you were right the first time: Trull should definitely be up there. Dude went blow-for-blow with an enraged Icarium with just a spear, and walked away in once piece.  You make an interesting point: we know Rake has considerable stamina (he killed his way through a lot of Seguleh before getting annoyed and leaving), but Traveller had a feud with Death itself. That's the kind of lethal focus that probably would win out in the end, but I couldn't say for sure. They're both just so fucking awesome, haha."
Malazan,2wvnyr,Montaron87,3,Mon Feb 23 21:22:02 2015 UTC,"Eh, I can't put cotillion above karsa or others.   Cots is wicked an all, but 1v1 in an arena? No chance. No magic? Dancer is likely beaten by anyone on this list in those circumstances.  The caveat being that when dancer picks the time and place, no one on this list would survive. Four lungs or not.  That's always an issue I see with these types if posts, no one ever states the circumstances. It's also very difficult to separate the magical aspect from physical.   Look at a character like rhulad, (not on your list but occasionally on similar posts) its impossible to say where physical skill ends and skills imparted by the crippled god begins. Even considering the dozens (hundreds?) Of challengers he faces.  Always fun to read other peoples lists!   Edit: so I totally missed the one part where you mentioned having a tough time placing assassins. I totally agree, even if the tone of my post is off! Sorry!"

Malazan,2wvnyr,BirdBathandBeyond,1 point,Mon Feb 23 21:28:59 2015 UTC,"I feel that it's fairly ironic that in a meritocracy like the Seguleh's the position of First, firstly, is offered, and secondly, was offered to like 3 people. Actually, more than ironic, I find it reasonable and stupid. It makes sense that the actual leader can't be challenged for their position, so they have a stable-ish government, but I feel like when it's up for grabs it should only be offered to the second (and maybe third). Dassem skipped like 6 ranks there and that doesn't seem to mesh well with how the Agatii is structured."
Malazan,2wvnyr,xolotl92,2,Mon Feb 23 23:59:44 2015 UTC,"I feel that they might've recognized his skill, though. If someone beats a reasonably strong opponent, using techniques and speed of which you know you can't copy it, you might be able to tell that he would best you in a fight.  But I agree it's somewhat weird."
Malazan,2wvnyr,xolotl92,1 point,Tue Feb 24 10:15:52 2015 UTC,"I'd be fine with that if I recalled Dassem actually fighting someone during the book, or beyond the prologue where he pretended to be the gardener. His whole thing was ""refusing to fight"". They didn't get to see him do anything, otherwise that'd be fine.  I recall RotCG where they explained the highly ranked Seguleh fights where they only do a single pass without fighting and the judges can tell who's better from form etc. Feels like a wasted explanation when Dassem refuses to fight later because he's so into passivism... despite fighting/destroying someone completely out of his league (downwards) in the prologue of the book. That's all a bit off topic I guess, but I do find an annoying inconsistency."
Malazan,2wvnyr,xolotl92,1 point,Tue Feb 24 12:26:13 2015 UTC,"I think you're right. Is there nowhere else they could've picked up on his ability?

As I put some where else, he could spar with Daseem and make him really work.

Malazan,2wvnyr,Crokus,1 point,Tue Feb 24 01:07:25 2015 UTC,"I agree, and it was explicitly stated by Mallet I believe, that he never would have lunged at Kallor if he wasn't sure he had him, and thus it was only his leg giving out that won kallor the day. Thus, imo, whiskeyjack would be better than kallor. I'm not sure if i put it like that in my original lineup, but i plan to do one at the end, with the general consensus anyways, so I'll keep that in mind"
Malazan,2wvnyr,Montaron87,0,Tue Feb 24 01:22:04 2015 UTC,"I think WJ was up there, we just never got the chance to see it.  I'm thinking even at Mok and Tool level.  I think Karsa and Icarium can beat him just by being so damn strong."

Malazan,2wvnyr,BirdBathandBeyond,2,Mon Feb 23 19:26:32 2015 UTC,"I'm on the fence with Trull, he doesn't get much respect or notoriety throughout the series but then he goes and holds his own against a fully enraged Icarium and beats back Silchas Ruin who is an extremely powerful ascendant.  I think if he was fighting to protect something he loves he could beat a lot of these guys. Why do you think Rake would only be 4th on the Seguleh list? He faced a ton of Seguleh in a row and beat them all and then left by warren when he realized they weren't going to stop.  I have him on par or just below Traveller's skill level and Traveller is the Seguleh 1st."
Malazan,2wvnyr,Crokus,3,Mon Feb 23 19:45:00 2015 UTC,"Trull is held back by his character, not his skill. He's got a lot of talent, maybe even more that we didn't get to see."
Malazan,2wvnyr,BirdBathandBeyond,2,Mon Feb 23 21:10:43 2015 UTC,"Don't forget he fights, and kills, a ton of soletaken on his own, in a snow storm, while protecting his brothers' rear."

Malazan,2wvnyr,Montaron87,1 point,Tue Feb 24 00:01:51 2015 UTC,"I think Karsa is too long, he went blow for blow with Icarium, he should be at the top.  Plus Brood is absent from this list, but in Gardens Rake says Brood is better than him."
Malazan,2wvnyr,Montaron87,4,Mon Feb 23 21:21:27 2015 UTC,"Karsa is awesome and would have a chance against the top guys just through his brute strength but even he admitted he wouldn't fuck with Traveller.

Malazan,2wvnyr,BirdBathandBeyond,2,Mon Feb 23 21:47:06 2015 UTC,Kasa goes blow for blow with Icarium because he is can resist Icariums magic. Although he would technically be the Seguleh 12th (I think)
Malazan,2wvnyr,titanemesis,1 point,Mon Feb 23 22:50:34 2015 UTC,"but in Gardens Rake says Brood is better than him.   Rake vs. Brood is tainted by Burn's Hammer/Dragnipur though. And I feel that Burn's hammer is a bigger boon in that case. I doubt Rake with average sword vs, Brood with average hammer would go in Brood's favour."
Malazan,2wvnyr,Silcha,1 point,Tue Feb 24 10:26:26 2015 UTC,I've always thought Brys gets a little overrated in these type of lists. He's definitely a respected swordsman amongst his own people but I don't think we ever really see him do anything that impressive. I'd probably put him on a level with any of the other swordsman that are well respected but not really tested in the series such as whiskeyjack.
Malazan,2wvnyr,Tulkaas,3,Tue Feb 24 01:31:38 2015 UTC,"He basically dissects Rhulad with his sword, while Rhulad is trying to kill him. How is that not impressive?"
Malazan,2wvnyr,no_social_skills,1 point,Tue Feb 24 10:21:28 2015 UTC,Haha I knew the Rhuland thing would come up.   Let me start by saying that I think Brys is a great swordsman I just don't think hes on the level of dudes like Rake or Tool who have literally thousands of years experience and wins under their belts. To use the seguleh as a benchmark I'd say he'd rank in their top 25 but definitely not top 10.  So I think the Rhulad fight is a bit misleading. I mean theres no reason to believe Rhulad is even above average as a fighter. His only ability comes from the fact he is immortal. Also keep im mind that when Brys faced him he still was really inexperienced too. I think in later books its mentioned that hes died hundreds of times and each time becomes better. So Brys is basically fighting a kid that has just got a new toy. Yes its impressive that Brys didn't sever any arteries or whatever but I think his first move was to dislocate Rhulad's kneecap which dropped him. After that it had to have been pretty easy to just make some precise cuts.   Also you have to think that Rhulad did not expect a strategy like that from Brys. He was probably just focused all on offense leaving himself completely open. Knowing that you can't die probably changes your fighting style.
Malazan,2wvnyr,MoranthMunitions,2,Tue Feb 24 23:09:19 2015 UTC,"Doesn't Trull see Brys taking apart Rhulad and note how amazing of a fighter he was? Like the best he's ever seen.  Also he does defeat that guardian of those lost gods names, who must be pretty badass."
Malazan,2wvnyr,Montaron87,2,Tue Feb 24 15:55:41 2015 UTC,"I went back to read that part of MT and you actually make a really good argument wuth the Trull thing. I think Trull is only a borderline top 10 but I will give him the benefit of the doubt when it comes to judging other fighters. So for him to say that Brys was the best he ever saw definitely means a lot.   I still have a hard time putting Brys with the likes of Dassem. On the one hand you have a champion of a small, secluded empire who isn't really shown doing much other than the ceremonial guarding of the royalty. On the other you have a champion (and I'm talking when mortal) who would purposely be the very point of his entire army when clashing with the enemy and who would seek out the opposing champions. I feel like Dassem level fighters just go through champions like Brys with ease."
Malazan,2wvnyr,MoranthMunitions,1 point,Tue Feb 24 23:20:38 2015 UTC,"Ya I agree with you that he isn't quite on Dassem's level, but I consider him and Rake the clear top guys and then everyone else is a bit below them.   I think what was more impressive than Brys killing Rhulad was him taking out the ancient guardian of the forgotten gods.  Also the guy who was supposed to be his rival for the Kings champion (can't remember his name, but he was the queens champion I believe), was killed by Rhulad after only one death I believe and then Brys just absolutely takes Rhulad apart no problem.  Since characters rarely fight each other it's pretty tough to rank them though, so no one will agree on everything."
Malazan,2wvnyr,Montaron87,0,Wed Feb 25 04:47:02 2015 UTC,"No Wiskeyjack?  Remember, he was the only person who Daseem could spare with.  He would have easily defeated Kallor had his knee not gone out on him."

Malazan,2wvnyr,Tulkaas,1 point,Mon Feb 23 17:53:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I debated that for quite a while. But, does it ever actually say that he's not a good swordsman, and all he uses is his rage? I thought it was both, but I could also have misunderstood"
Malazan,2wvnyr,ScottyBeans,1 point,Mon Feb 23 18:52:26 2015 UTC,I think in DG he's fighting some d'ivers and mentions not being particularly gifted with a sword or something of the sort.

Although, once he reaches enough rage to be  destroying cities, I don't think any swordsman could get close enough to him and it would definitely take a lot of high level magic to take him out."
Malazan,2wvnyr,ScottyBeans,1 point,Mon Feb 23 19:07:18 2015 UTC,"It was my impression that his rage is a defense mechanism: the second his life is in serious danger, it kicks in and he goes nuclear.  Mappo Runt was protecting Icarium from the world, but also the world from Icarium (thus the reason he knocks Karsa out before he could duel him)."
Malazan,2wvnyr,nobadlinks,3,Mon Feb 23 19:20:29 2015 UTC,"Would'nt Onos T'oolan be a bit higher? I got the impression he would be much higher on that list, closer to Mok"
Malazan,2wvnyr,MoranthMunitions,7,Mon Feb 23 16:22:29 2015 UTC,"Well, Mok beat Onos T'oolan, and that was when he couldn't die too."
Malazan,2wvnyr,nobadlinks,1 point,Mon Feb 23 16:27:15 2015 UTC,"I was always kind of confused as to how good Tool was.  In GoTM, during the ""dream"" sequence at the end with Raest, K'rul, and Tool, K'rul talks about how powerful the First Sword (Tool) is and how Raest can't comprehend the danger he is in.  Which implies, at least to me, that the Elder Gods thought Tool was on par with a Jaghut Tyrant.   Yet later, Tool is beat pretty handily by the Segulah third.  Leading up to that fight, though, I had thought Tool would be able to easily win.  He talks about struggling against the other Segulah, but he was fighting specifically to incapacitate and not kill, and he does so pretty quickly.  Plus, pretty much every other time we see Tool fight it is remarked how fast and deadly he is.  The whole scene with ""It was time for the first Sword of the Imass to announce himself"", etc.  Basically, I thought Tool was portrayed as one of the very very top warriors, with perhaps no equal amongst mortals.  Then the Segulah third just destroys him.  Perhaps I was under-rating the Segulah, I'm not sure."
Malazan,2wvnyr,RickyLidz,2,Mon Feb 23 20:04:12 2015 UTC,"Didn't Tool's sister (or someone) show up and was disgusted with his performance, like he wasn't even trying to win. It's been a long time since I've read it so my memory is fuzzy."
Malazan,2wvnyr,SerBronnofBlackwater,5,Mon Feb 23 21:04:17 2015 UTC,"I'd say no.   Yet the rage remained in Kilava’s eyes as she strode towards Tool. ‘You were defeated! You! The First Sword!’ Tool slowly lowered himself to collect his notched sword. ‘Aye.’ ‘He is a mortal man!’ ‘Go to the Abyss, Kilava.’ He straightened, back scraping as he continued leaning against the wall. ‘Let me kill him. Now. Then once more you shall have no worthy challenger.’ ‘Oh, sister,’ Tool sighed. ‘Do you not realize? Our time – it has passed. We must relinquish our place in this world. Mok – that man you so casually struck from behind – he is the Third. The Second and the First are his masters with swords. Do you understand me, Kilava? Leave him . . . leave them all.’   But when Tool is being rated as a dangerous being that takes into account that he's not just a swordsman. He's got some powerful kind-of-magic going on too."

He's got some powerful kind-of-magic going on too.   Also, I'd rate alive Tool on a mission of revenge in the later books higher than depressed defeatist undead Tool. Alive Tool basically turned into an ascendant, and judging by the ways we've seen other people ascend, he might very well be an ascendant at the end of the books."
Malazan,2wvnyr,SerBronnofBlackwater,1 point,Tue Feb 24 10:25:00 2015 UTC,"You mean re-undead Tool? He didn't really do much while alive, but he was hellbent on revenge after dying again. And he was definitely an Ascendant already, but I feel like he wasn't really into it. The exchange that Tool remembers between himself and Logros at the start of chapter 9 of tCG, with these bits:   Instead, Logros had lifted one hand, a splay of gnarled fingers all pointing at Onos. ‘You were once our First Sword,’ he said. ‘When we return to the mortal empire, we shall avow service to Dassem Ultor, for he is your heir to the title. You shall surrender the name of First Sword.’ Onos T’oolan considered that for a time. Surrender the title? Cut through the bindings? Sever the knots? Know freedom once more? ‘He is mortal, Logros. He does not know what he has done in taking for himself the title of First Sword.’ ‘In service,’ Logros replied, ‘the T’lan Imass sanctify him—’    Where are you now, Logros? Do you feel me, so fiercely reborn? My heir – your chosen child – has rejected the role. His footfalls now mark the passing of tragedy. You have made him the God of Tears, and now that Hood is gone he must hunt down the next one who made him what he was. Do you tremble, Logros? Dassem is coming for you. He is coming for you.   is part of what makes me think that his being First Sword has made him an Ascendant, that or the opposite, where his abilities as an Ascendant are what allowed him to become the First sword. Actually that whole conversation was really interesting. Anyway, yeah and you're right, he seems to think that he's been reborn stronger himself and it's the impression that I got too. Probably just needed some motivation. It seems to me that when he became clanless he became less powerful. I'm not 100% sure why Logros finally fobbed him off after 100k years, but it seems to be because they were replacing him."
Malazan,2wvnyr,MoranthMunitions,1 point,Tue Feb 24 12:26:05 2015 UTC,"You're right, I forgot he sacrificed his life for his clan and died again. I did indeed mean the bit where Hettan is killed and he basically becomes so strong and hellbent on revenge that he drags a whole bunch (T'Lan?) Imass with him on sheer power of will, resisting the call of Olar Ethil."
Malazan,2wvnyr,SerBronnofBlackwater,2,Tue Feb 24 12:38:10 2015 UTC,Well the Seguleh are better than most just because all they do everyday is sword fight lol.
Malazan,2wvnyr,MoranthMunitions,1 point,Mon Feb 23 21:51:57 2015 UTC,"well yeah, but I mean Tool has over a hundred thousand years of experience, and I think it is mentioned somewhere that the other two Segulah in the punitive army (not Mok) are like 14.  I know they are a crazy warrior society, but I had the impression (prior to the Mok/Tool fight) that Tool was the best swordsman apart from ascendants. He has hundreds of thousands of years of experience and was named the best fighter among all of the T'lan."
Malazan,2wvnyr,SerBronnofBlackwater,3,Mon Feb 23 22:20:48 2015 UTC,"From that group, I'd go with something like:   Rake by 10 miles Dassem Karsa Icarium Brood Dancer Kallor Mok Tool Derryg   I also think there are a few characters like Gruntle that could be argued should at least be in the conversation."
Malazan,2wvnyr,Montaron87,1 point,Mon Feb 23 18:43:01 2015 UTC,"Well, Dassem defeated Rake...  Edit: But yeah, Gruntle should definitely be in there. And maybe Amby Bole?"
Malazan,2wvnyr,SerBronnofBlackwater,9,Mon Feb 23 18:48:02 2015 UTC,'Dassem defeated Rake' isn't such a simple statement. It was Rake's goal to be defeated in that fight.
Malazan,2wvnyr,SerBronnofBlackwater,6,Mon Feb 23 19:44:33 2015 UTC,"Right, plus he also happened to have been bearing the weight of all the dead souls who have ever entered hood's warren on his back at the time of the fight, and he still made Dassem look a bit silly."
Malazan,2wvnyr,SerBronnofBlackwater,-2,Mon Feb 23 20:23:57 2015 UTC,"Right, but I dont think that implies that he threw the fight, as much as knowingly taking on a superior foe"
Malazan,2wvnyr,Montaron87,5,Tue Feb 24 00:50:53 2015 UTC,"Dassem did not defeat Rake.  Rake threw that fight.  Karsa comments on it.  Also, it's readily apparent because Rake needed to be in the sword so he could open the gate."
Malazan,2wvnyr,SerBronnofBlackwater,0,Mon Feb 23 21:26:22 2015 UTC,"Where does it say that? I believe you, I just dont remember it that way. I was under the impression that Rake knew he would lose, and that was part of the courage involved with his plan- to knowingly fight someone he couldn't beat, in order to become trapped in the sword. Because isn't that why Kallor was trying to stop the fight? He knew Dassem would win"
Malazan,2wvnyr,ScottyBeans,4,Tue Feb 24 00:48:58 2015 UTC,"Imo Rake was probably better than Dassem, but he's undeniably at least as skilled. Because he at least was confident enough to hold him off and make him kill him in a way that was to his advantage. I feel like he actually wanted to stop Dassem from having his vengeance, on top of needing to be in Dragnipur, but that's kind of unrelated/to do with what happened with Andarist.  Anyway, I'll quote the whole passage, because I'm sure a lot of people in the thread would like to read back through it properly.   To all who witnessed – the cultists, Samar Dev, Karsa Orlong, even unto the five Hounds of Shadow and the Great Ravens hunched on every ledge – that first clash of weapons was too fast to register. Sparks slanted, the night air rang with savage parries, counter-blows, the biting crunch of edges against cross-hilts. Even their bodies were but a blur. And then both warriors staggered back, opening up the distance between them once more. ‘Faces in the Rock,’ hissed Karsa Orlong. ‘Karsa—’ ‘No. Only a fool would step between these two.’ And the Toblakai sounded . . . shaken. Dassem launched himself forward again. There were no war cries, no bellowed curses, not even the grunts bursting free as ferocious swings hammered forged iron. But the swords had begun singing, a dreadful, mournful pair of voices rising in eerie syncopation. Thrusts, slashes, lowedged ripostes, the whistle of a blade cutting through air where a head had been an instant earlier, bodies writhing to evade counter-strokes, and sparks rained, poured, from the two combatants, bounced like shattered stars across the cobbles. They did not break apart this time. The frenzied flurry did not abate, but went on, impossibly on. Two forces, neither yielding, neither prepared to draw a single step back. And yet, for all the blinding speed, the glowing shower spraying out like the blood of iron, Samar Dev saw the death blow. She saw it clear. She saw its undeniable truth – and somehow, somehow, it was all wrong. Rake wide-legged, angling the pommel high before his face with Dragnipur’s point downward – as if to echo his opening stance – and higher still, and Dassem, his free hand joining the other upon his sword’s grip, throwing his entire weight into a crossways slash – the warrior bodily lifting as if about to take to the air and close upon Rake with an embrace. And his swing met the edge of Dragnipur at a full right angle – a single moment shaping a perfect cruciform fashioned by the two weapons’ colliding, and then the power of Dassem’s blow slammed Dragnipur back— Driving its inside edge into Anomander Rake’s forehead, and then down through his face. His gauntleted hands sprang away from the handle, yet Dragnipur remained jammed, seeming to erupt from his head, as he toppled backward, blood streaming down to flare from the tip as the Son of Darkness crashed down on his back. Even this impact did not dislodge Dragnipur. The sword shivered, and now there was but one song, querulous and fading in the sudden stillness. Blood boiled, turned black. The body lying on the cobbles did not move. Anomander Rake was dead. Dassem Ultor slowly lowered his weapon, his chest heaving. And then he cried out, in a voice so filled with anguish that it seemed to tear a jagged hole in the night air. This unhuman scream was joined by a chorus of shrieks as the Great Ravens exploded into flight, lifting like a massive feathered veil that whirled above the street, and then began a spinning descent. Cultists flinched away and crouched against building walls, their wordless chant drowned beneath the caterwauling cacophony of this black, glistening shroud that swept down like a curtain. Dassem staggered back, and then pitched drunkenly to one side, his sword dragging in his wake, point skirling a snake track across the cobbles. He was brought up short by a pitted wall, and he sagged against it, burying his face in the shelter of a crooked arm that seemed to be all that held him upright. Broken. Broken. They are broken. Oh, gods forgive them, they are broken. Karsa Orlong shocked her then, as he twisted to one side and pointedly spat on to the street. ‘Cheated,’ he said. ‘Cheated!’ She stared at him, aghast. She did not know what he meant – but no, she did. Yes, she did. ‘Karsa, what just happened?’ Wrong. It was wrong. ‘I saw – I saw—’ ‘You saw true,’ he said, baring his teeth, his gaze fixed upon that fallen body. ‘As did Traveller, and see what it has done to him.’   Anyway, read it as closely as you like, but the italics are what was italic in the book itself, which help to highlight it. It was pretty obvious, as these things go, that he got Dragnipur'd in the face on purpose."
Malazan,2wvnyr,Silcha,1 point,Tue Feb 24 01:16:02 2015 UTC,"Lmao, ""Dragnipur'd in the face."" But, ah, I see now. I must have just read through that part super fast because I was so excited, or something."

But, now that I think about it, it might have been a comment on Draconus choosing to make Dragnipur instead of being satisfied with his sword of darkness..."

Malazan,2wvnyr,future_forward,1 point,Mon Feb 23 23:47:30 2015 UTC,"Well it's not magic though, it's you becoming one with your blades. The blades become an extension of yourself. Lostara doesn't have a hint of magic in her and she's able to do it even without Cotillon possessing her."
Malazan,2wvnyr,no_social_skills,2,Tue Feb 24 00:13:39 2015 UTC,"House of Chains, Chapter 8:   Half a bell later there was a light rap upon the door and Pearl entered. And immediately halted. ‘I smell sorcery.’ Seated on the bed, Lostara shrugged then rose to collect her kit bag. ‘There are sequences in the Shadow Dance,’ she said casually, ‘that occasionally evoke Rashan.’ ‘Rashan! Yes.’ He stepped close, his gaze searching. ‘The Shadow Dance. You?’   So, yeah, it does have magic involved and Lostara is probably* able to use it.  I presume that even if you don't have the skills to use the magic it could be similar to how it was used as dancing/entertainment in Bidithal's temple. Like, it's still a way to assassinate people even if you aren't using it that way, so if it can use Shadow it might just require the right person. It's implied in some of the earlier books that magic can be learned by anyone if they really try, so it might be a way to learn to manipulate Rashan.  *Keep in mind the quote is from just after Cotillion left the room. He's probably the one who used magic, but what she's saying is still relevant and she's implying that she can, which I don't doubt. Otherwise there wouldn't be as much interest in her abilities with it."
Malazan,2wvnyr,Giotto,1 point,Tue Feb 24 00:46:00 2015 UTC,Yeah as soon as you quoted that I was about to write that she could be lying just to not let Pearl know that Cotillion was there. But I see your point!

Malazan,2wvnyr,nobadlinks,1 point,Tue Feb 24 10:29:32 2015 UTC,Yeah but Seren is an adept at Mockra. She learns to control it and uses it as some points after being taught by Corlo.

It's an actual thing, but they were all tricked into following a fake one, pretty sure the phrasing was convenience over misconception, but figured I'd mention it. Tremorlor didn't have a deal with Shadowthrone, he was just using it. Effectively the only objective of an Azath House is to contain powerful beings (Ascendants, gods, nasty mages), so it was fulfilling it's basic function by capturing D'ivers and Soletaken. It did need a new guardian though, especially because of the amount of things attempting to follow the Path, so the deal made was between it and Moby. So, yes it was random."

As well as the lead up to it. The epic characters working together. MOI was pretty consistently exciting I thought. Characters, action, war, magic, etc.   The ends of the books typically are the most exciting/convergent. Though if you don't like the beginning you're going to read like 6-7000 pages you don't like (series is 10000 paves iirc).

What I got from the Dragnipur battle scene was that the forces of chaos were there to overtake the gate of darkness, but when Rake showed up he basically moved the gate out of Dragnipur. This gave chaos no reason to keep fighting. Hoods forces were just there too hold back the chaos for as long as they could."
Malazan,2wr7he,Zingbrit,1 point,Sun Feb 22 17:53:38 2015 UTC,That makes sense. ..thanks for clearing that up
Malazan,2wr7he,Ceej54,1 point,Sun Feb 22 20:43:40 2015 UTC,Do we happen to know what chaos is?? I just startd dust of dreams and i am still unclear
Malazan,2wr7he,Ceej54,1 point,Sun Feb 22 21:22:09 2015 UTC,"I think It's usually discussed as a basic elemental type force, existing between/outside the warrens, which also manages to have some sort of consciousness/goal, e.g. trying to get the gate of darkness. I seem to recall much more elaboration throughout DoD and tCG in relation to certain events and beings. Someone could probably give more direct quotes from the books that paint a clearer picture."
Malazan,2wr7he,Zingbrit,3,Sun Feb 22 21:23:22 2015 UTC,It's the antithesis of magic.  The warrens are basically an imposed set of order and restrictions on the chaos that is magic.
Malazan,2wr7he,adamanderrake,0,Sun Feb 22 21:46:02 2015 UTC,"It isn't the antithesis of magic as /u/adamanderrake  said further down, that's what Otataral is, although the explanatory sentence is correct enough. As a physical location/warren/phenomenon it's more like the basic building blocks of creation, unfortunately the main series doesn't really do much towards informing you about the nature of chaos. If you're up to it I'd recommend reading OST (one of the ICE books) and FoD, which actually kind of delve into it."
Malazan,2wr7he,MoranthMunitions,1 point,Sun Feb 22 22:27:12 2015 UTC,"Actually Otataral is the opposite of chaos.  I meant to say Chaos is the basis of the ordered forms of magic.  All magic originally derives from chaos but the warrens were an ordered imposition on chaos, in which they chose a single dragon (whose lifeblood is chaos) and assigned them an aspect to create each warren.  They also had to do this with abnegation(otataral) or the opposite of chaos which is what Korabas is."
Malazan,2wr7he,adamanderrake,1 point,Mon Feb 23 08:00:36 2015 UTC,"Also Kallor wants to die but can't. Draginpur is an interesting weapons as it more enslaves the souls of its victims rather than kills them. He may believe that the sword could bind his soul in a worse sense of perpetual torment, than the eternity he is currently living."
Malazan,2wqwlj,tenement,12,Sun Feb 22 09:08:24 2015 UTC,"The second book takes you to another continent (don't worry its awesome) with many new characters (get used to it). There are some recurring characters but most from the first reappear in book three. The second and third books take place at the same time, on two different continents, and chronicle two different chains of events. It sounds daunting but don't worry! The second book is awesome..  If you enjoyed the first it only gets better. You are embarking on an epic literary journey. Enjoy friend :)"
Malazan,2wqwlj,sielias,2,Sun Feb 22 09:19:11 2015 UTC,I have to say I am excited about the second book. Even the first chapter has me gripped! I just wanted to know if I should be expecting characters I know or not and now that I know I probably shouldn't.. it will be even more enjoyable when they pop up!
Malazan,2wqwlj,Fnarley,6,Sun Feb 22 09:23:33 2015 UTC,"Fiddler, Kalam, Crokus and Apsalar are all recurring characters from GotM"

House of Chains-back to Seven Cities, the characters of DG return, many new characters introduced as well.  Midnight Tides-entirely new continent AGAIN, this takes place DURING the previous books but on an entirely new continent across the world. One recurring character from HoC and all the rest is new. Hardest book for me to get through initially because of the entirely new nature of it but now it's one of my favorites.   Bonehunters: All plot lines have been established across all continents. Now it all slooooowly starts to come together over the course of the next five books, with new characters introduced as well in each book, all culminating in the Crippled God.   Don't be scared! There are more characters in this series than any other I've read. Often times you may not remember what a particular character is doing since you last read them between books. You'll often read of characters points of view of events that happened in other books but from different times so you can see how it all fits. Many an ""Oooooh"" and ""Ah-Hah!"" moment are in your future. If you have questions feel free to post them here we'll keep it spoiler free and we love reading first impressions as new readers enjoy Malazan. You're in for a wonderful, amazing and weepy ride."

Don't worry, if anything Malazan is good for closure, there's a lot of characters and a lot of plotlines, and nearly all a closed by the main series. Of the few remaining ones, most are dealt with by the other Novels of the Malazan Empire. It's good, it feels like the series/plot-arc is complete without it seeming like the world has stopped moving just because the events of the books have, if that makes sense."
Malazan,2wqwlj,Montaron87,2,Mon Feb 23 08:52:32 2015 UTC,"It sucks at first. Or it did for me, it also (after book three) made me willing to take any and all time, location, character leaps that Erikson had in store.   I will say that I loved GotM and that the transition was hard until after the first few chapters. I always found Eriksons writing captivating.   DG for me was one of the most powerful and visceral books, enjoy!"
Malazan,2wqwlj,999steps,6,Sun Feb 22 10:57:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I still remember opening Midnight Tides and thinking ""are you for real??"". I'm pretty sure it had one previously mentioned character, and at that point I didn't even like Trull. But then it ended up being one of my favourites, so just had to trust Erikson after that."
Malazan,2wib06,Mryappy,16,Fri Feb 20 03:13:50 2015 UTC,"Well, for Edur, Trull Sengar is the easy iconic choice for the race. Only big question is whether you want to go with Pre or Post Shorning. Though if you want to go in a less conventional direction, Rhulad would certainly be a unique drawing.   Liosan is a hard one. By their very nature they really aren't in the series much.And when they are they aren't really memorable as their own characters as much as just being Liosan. Really the only one that sticks out to me in the series is L'oric. He show's up in multiple books, interacts with major characters, and actually does things occasionally. Lot more than could be said about any other Liosan."
Malazan,2wib06,SageOfTheWise,5,Fri Feb 20 05:44:50 2015 UTC,"Great points, I've already been thinking about how I'd draw L'oric. He seemed pretty badass in HoC.   I'm reading about Trull Pre-Shorning right now, but I'm still on the fence of what would look best. Possibly Pre-Shorning because he'd be more representative of the Edur at large."
Malazan,2wib06,MoranthMunitions,3,Fri Feb 20 13:44:40 2015 UTC,"There's not much in the way of descriptions for L'oric, but in case it helps I found some for you.    he was wearing armour. White, enamelled, scarred and stained with use. A long, narrow-bladed sword hung at his hip.    a tall, cloaked warrior strode in, drawing his hood back.    He wore his long pale hair loose, and layered green robes.    His face was thin, but there was a certain haughtiness in its expression in which she saw the relationship. This man should speak of arrogance! It marches emblazoned across his face completely unbeknownst to him.    A man now stood amid the dispersing dust. He brushed it from his green cloak as he set off walking with a brisk purposeful stride.    The tall wiry mage   I thought that his armour sounded pretty cool, and the green cloak/robes seems to be fairly iconic. Besides that he sounds pretty similar to any other Liosan description - general Tiste features/height, pale, a bit arrogant. I'll be interested to see how you go about drawing him.  I think that pre-shorning makes sense for your races height/description chart, though being shorn is an important part of his identity afterwards. How are you finding MT?"
Malazan,2wib06,MoranthMunitions,2,Fri Feb 20 14:41:38 2015 UTC,"As always, great stuff Moranth. I'm only a hundred pages into the book right now but I like the change of scenery and Edur-centric storyline so far.   My only apprehension in using Trull for the character heights list is that he's described as a foot shorter than most other Edur, which might not make him the best representative of their build. What do you think?"
Malazan,2wib06,pdoxney,1 point,Fri Feb 20 14:50:15 2015 UTC,"Sorry, had a busy weekend. I haven't been able to have as comprehensive a look around as I'd like, however with a few points for reference on Trull's height I'd say he's the height of an average Edur. Are you sure about that/can you find whatever made you think that?  The only thing I found in HoC was this one:  HoC Ch 9, pg. 446  Which would be comparing height to a Deragoth, if you have any idea of how tall they are. There's probably a comparison to Karsa, L'oric or a Hound of Shadow somewhere.  Besides that, I found Binadas is a bit taller than Trull and a bunch taller than Hull Beddict, who is almost as tall as an Edur. I figure this makes Binadas tall for an Edur, and Trull probably average height - therefore probably average Tiste height. Also, just because it relates to Trull's height, not that it's informative, Silchas Ruin is a bunch taller than Scabandari Bloodeye and described as tall from Trull's perspective, which doesn't say much but I figure if he was tonnes taller it would rate a more descriptive mention than tall. Anyway, quotes:  MT Ch. 1, pg. 39  On Binadas:  MT Ch. 4, pg. 145  On Hull:  MT Ch. 2, pg.75  On Silchas Ruin:  MT Prologue  MT Ch. 3, pg. 219  And I've just realised none of that probably needed spoiler quoting, but it's too much effort to get rid of it. Page numbers are from UK MMPBs (Bantam), so if yours are Tor they might be out by a few pages but probably still closish."
Malazan,2wib06,titanemesis,6,Mon Feb 23 08:45:53 2015 UTC,Osserc and Scabandari Blood-eye. Kinda fits well eith Anomander Rake being the Tiste Andii example.

Malazan,2wib06,bantuftw,2,Fri Feb 20 04:22:56 2015 UTC,I'd say it has to be Trull or Scandabari for the Edur and L'oric or Ossiric (spl)  for the Liosan.   As for appearance maybe this link for Liosan http://malazan.wikia.com/wiki/Tiste_Liosan

Malazan,2whwgy,NoFortress,5,Fri Feb 20 01:54:53 2015 UTC,"Brys has all of the names, not Tehol. But that is his general plan.    Rhulad's been the emperor for a fair while now, 2 or 3 years I think, there's been a lot of ships out looking for champions to challenge him.  The ones who left, well Iron Bars and his Blade went to head back to the rest of the Crimson Guard, they got dropped of by Shurq Elalle on Jacuruku IIRC. The others were dropped somewhere else on Lether and have been travelling around together looking for the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. Trull was shorn between MT and HoC like NoFortress said, and has been doing whatever you last saw in the Bonehunters, protecting the First Throne with the T'lan Imass, where after the last fight with Icarium he told Cotillion that he couldn't do it any more.  That's all you need to remember really. The book is set quite a long time after MT finished so really you're supposed to just infer what's happened in between as you're reading."

He was poisoned and killed, but when he was taken by the guardian and the names were transferred he became a second guardian. Didn't realise that was at the end of MT that the transfer happened though, just read back through to double check. Obviously need a reread haha.   ‘Yes. There shall be two Guardians now and for ever more.’   Is the bit, just before the epilogue, that lets you know that he's not properly dead though."

I personally really enjoyed his stuff, and the writing does get stronger further into his series of books.

I applaud your dedication to sticking with it, but rest assured, it does get better. The second book is pretty rough in terms of writing style as well. The writing in that book is much closer to SE's than in the first book but it's still not as great. As everyone has said already, his writing gets way better. Look forward to Orb, Sceptre, Throne. It's my personal favourite and feels like something SE wrote which is really awesome."

Malazan,2wg8vr,pfk505,1 point,Fri Feb 20 16:01:51 2015 UTC,Same boat here. I'm honestly a bit turned off of the idea of reading any more ICE novels after I finish this one. I find the Wikis more entertaining than NoK so far.

ICE lacks some of the depth (and also some of the needless pontificating) of Erikson, but his books are fun reads for the most part.  There seems to usually be one or two plotlines which don't quite match the intensity of the others but they are worth reading, for sure.  Some great characters and humour also."
Malazan,2wg8vr,xolotl92,1 point,Fri Feb 20 07:43:53 2015 UTC,"ICE is worth reading, but he is a very different writer to Steven. I think part of what makes him worthwhile is that he casually interweaves answers to many of the questions you get from reading the books of the fallen. I ended up really liking ICE's books and have purchased them all in Hardcopy. He does get better for each book. NoK is not a great piece of fantasy, and I think the only thing that made it worth while for me was that Tay'chreen (sp) became more fleshed out for me, and he was always one of my favorite characters."
Malazan,2wg8vr,Aiolus,1 point,Fri Feb 20 16:45:36 2015 UTC,"I get why people have a problem with ICE, but honestly, I don't care how bad the writing is as long as I get more Malazan.   And I don't think his characters/storylines are actually that bad."
Malazan,2wg8vr,xolotl92,1 point,Fri Feb 20 23:55:21 2015 UTC,"I'm with you but, if memory serves, he wrote that a long time ago, maybe at the time or before Erickson was writing GotM so he has grown significantly.  Also, the amount of knowledge of the background is more than worth it, even if ICE didn't get better.  That all said, Erickson is a great writer so even if ICE is very good he still gets over shown.  I think if ICE had written something outside of Malazan first, people wouldn't judge him as harshly (myself included)."
Malazan,2wg8vr,Aiolus,2,Fri Feb 20 00:37:50 2015 UTC,Not sure if I would have finished ice if it were outside of Malazan. Shit I bought Assail ages ago and still need to read it. BaB in my opinion was awful. The rest were okay.   The information though is pretty worth it.
Malazan,2wg8vr,xolotl92,1 point,Fri Feb 20 01:46:28 2015 UTC,"Imo, the information, and filling up of the world, is worth it to me, if you really enjoyed Erickson's series.  The ICE books feel more like stand alone books to me, they don't flow like Erickson's.  I think this makes it harder for me to get going, but I enjoy them once I'm in."

Malazan,2wfy89,Tyger18,3,Sun Feb 22 08:35:54 2015 UTC,"Before, they fill in some great info to Erickson's series.  While his writing isn't as good (but to be fair, how many writers are?) he gets better and better with every book."
Malazan,2wfy89,xolotl92,4,Thu Feb 19 18:02:49 2015 UTC,I found them very frustrating.  Not only is the writing of lower quality than Erikson's but it is just poor compared to anyone.  He takes characters/groups that you love and really diminishes them with his shallow story telling and characterization (Segulah for example) and he has a knack for annoying female characters.  The upside is he fleshes out the world and some major events and introduces some interesting new characters.  But I found that I wish ed I just had the hints Erikson had given of these events instead of the actual letdown of Esslemont's details.  Night of Knives had a good set up but was a let down.  Orb Sceptre Throne ultimately went nowhere and accomplished nothing.  The main resolution was that everyone went back where they were and nothing really changed.  Etc.
Malazan,2wfy89,sizemore33,1 point,Thu Feb 19 18:28:32 2015 UTC,My order was  NoK after Midnight tides RotCG after Bonehunters Stonewielder after Toll the Hounds  I felt I got the wider story arcs filled in without interfering (but I hated SW and couldn't wait for it to be over)
Malazan,2webmn,Eltotsira,7,Thu Feb 19 04:41:00 2015 UTC,"Glad you liked it! Now go read Forge of Darkness and the Esselmont series for your fix!  Then do your first re-read. It's like a whole new series lol   Erikson in theory after he finishes the Kharkarnas Trilogy is doing a Karsa Trilogy or as I like to call it, Witness: A Barb's Tale.   I loved the Jaghut as well, such a unique and interesting take on the Orc. Also ""I have had enough of your JUSTICE!"" Hood is just a great character.   Cotillion basically freed him to go back to his worshippers in the jade statues. Shadowthrone is not as crazy as he seems.   Most hilarious characters, Kruppe, Ikaral Pust, Tehol and Bugg. I also actually have a fondness for Scorch and Leff's bickering. And any Malazan Sapper arguments."
Malazan,2webmn,TriscuitCracker,3,Thu Feb 19 05:49:06 2015 UTC,"Yep, I agree 100% with the last bit. And, ah, so what was he doing before that, when the jade fire was surrounding him?   Yeah, the Jaghut were super cool. Wait, so it actually is supposed to be Jaghut=Orcs, Tiste Andii=Dark Elves, Toblakai =Giants, etc etc?"
Malazan,2webmn,Tumblehawk,4,Thu Feb 19 15:02:55 2015 UTC,"I think Erikson is very knowingly and consciously commenting on all sorts of fantasy tropes in his own writing, but I think it's oversimplifying it to put equal signs between those things."

You should definitely read the Esselmont books when you get hte chance, i personally dont find them as well crafted as Erikson's books but theyre enjoyable none the less."

I also like Rake and his priest and his warrior (drawing a blank on names).   Another awesome duo is Kindly and Pores (hope I got that right). Gesler and Stormy were awesome.   Cheers!
Malazan,2webmn,SerBronnofBlackwater,2,Thu Feb 19 05:24:50 2015 UTC,"Ah, shit! I meant to add Kindly and Pores! They were hilarious.  And as for Rake, are you talking about Spinnock Durav as the warrior? I don't remember the priest's name, but I know who you're referring to."
Malazan,2webmn,TriscuitCracker,2,Thu Feb 19 15:06:22 2015 UTC,"Yep Spinnock. Rakes scenes were good at highlighting his ""solitude"" but they also showed the tremendous love and loyalty of his people. Was pretty good. Plus Spinnock and the seer domin (spl)  were good."

It was a collections of stories and poems written by Gothos Well he promised to stay in Daru until he killed Fener which he did. His future actions will be shows in the upcoming Toblakai Trilogy. Loved it too. It subverted the trope of Orcs being these all evil bad guys. Eriksson does that a lot. You expect something out of someone and then they give you something else. Hood's Breath, I even felt sorry for Kallor at some points. The Wickans are featured a bit more in RotCG by Esselmont. Not too much but some characters return. I would also love a Wickan novella. Yeah the duos were great. Tehol and Bugg steal every scene they're in (even in some scenes they aren't in haha). He writes witty dialogue extremely well. My favorite was probably Ublala Pung and Draconus."

Malazan,2webmn,massassi,2,Thu Feb 19 12:32:12 2015 UTC,"Hah! Yeah, Ublala was great. Yeah, Kallor was definitely shown in a more human light towards the end, pretty much starting with when he met up with Nimander and gang, and subsequently fought Spinnock Durav, etc etc"

Malazan,2watgl,DAMCARDLE,1 point,Wed Feb 18 10:48:33 2015 UTC,"Much earlier in the night than that, I think.  I'm looking up the context now (just finished the book an hour ago).  edit; page 1049 of my Tor paperback, the one that the mob calls a Wickan head."
Malazan,2watgl,MoranthMunitions,3,Wed Feb 18 11:03:02 2015 UTC,"Do you mean this fireball:   Momentarily distracted by the plunging fireball that seemed to land just beyond the bay, the Claw Saygen Maral pushed himself forward once more. The assassin was pleased with the heaving press he moved through, a press settling down once again, although at a higher pitch of anticipation than before.   I think also mentioned here:   Something had just struck the sea beyond the anchored fleet, and the thunderous sound of its impact still echoed, even as darkness swept back into the wake of the bright, blazing fireball. The smell of steam was heavy in the air. It had seemed to Keneb that there was a peculiar lack of reaction to this event, from the Adjunct and T’amber, at any rate. There had been plenty of shouts, warding gestures then animated talk among the sailors, but that was to be expected.   ?  /u/DAMCARDLE was referring to this one:   ‘Now now, Obo,’ Shadowthrone said. ‘This is a courtesy, I assure you. Two most meddling twins have commandeered the top of your tower. I humbly suggest you oust them, in your usual kindly manner.’ The god then sketched a salute with his cane, turned about and departed. The door slammed shut after two strides. And now, Shadowthrone began to quicken his pace once more. For one last rendezvous this night, a most precious one. The cane rapped swift as a soldier’s drum. Halfway to his destination, the top of Obo’s tower erupted in a thunderous fireball that sent pieces of brick and tile flying. Amidst that eruption there came two outraged screams. Recovering from his instinctive duck, Shadowthrone murmured.  ‘Most kindly, Obo. Most kindly indeed.’ And the god walked the streets of Malaz City. Once more with uncharacteristic haste."
Malazan,2watgl,MoranthMunitions,1 point,Wed Feb 18 11:08:52 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's the one(the first), and I just checked and Shadowthrone prompting Obo to blow Oponn off the roof happens after Apsalar has killed Pearl(very clearly not a flashback, page 1152).  So that leaves my original question of what the deal with that fireball is."
Malazan,2watgl,PM-ME-YOUR-NIPPLE,5,Wed Feb 18 11:14:07 2015 UTC,"Yep, cool. I thought it was a Jade Stranger the first time I read through, but when I reread the series I noticed that I didn't notice (if that makes sense) anything about any of them being off course. So I decided it was related to this bit, which is about 12 pages after (mine's Bantam, but your 1049 was 1051 for me so I assume page sizes are roughly equivalent):   Lifting clear of the swirling black, filthy waters. Straightening, slime and grit streaming off, blood-sucking eels flapping down to writhe on the muddy rocks, the broken pottery and the brick fragments beneath the wooden dock. One step forward, then another, heavy, scraping. A rough wall directly ahead, revealing layers of street levels, bulwarks, old drainage holes dating back to the city’s youth – before iron was first forged by humans – when the sewer system was a superb, efficient subterranean web beneath level streets. In all, plenty of hand- and foot-holds, given sufficient determination, strength and will. Of all three, the one standing facing that wall had been given plenty. More steps. Then, climbing. A stranger had come to Malaz City.   That's Legana Breed, the T'lan Imass, arriving at the docks of Malaz City. As we all know that Imass generally travel as dust, why would they be in the harbour if not because they'd just escaped from the Nascent as a flaming ball? The head was potentially the Tiste Andii head that Breed brought with him into the rift caused by the mad mage (this was in DG btw). Anyway, that passage I quoted is definitely Breed, as later he's dripping in the tavern or wherever it is he meets Fiddler and Gessler.  Obviously I'm not 100% as it's all a bit tenuous, it might be a jade stranger that was put off course. But until I can find whatever made me think that to start with, I think it was Legana Breed and that's why."
Malazan,2watgl,MoranthMunitions,3,Wed Feb 18 11:38:57 2015 UTC,"Y'know, I had interpreted that as another passage of Hellian like the one after it(with her determination, strength, and will in pursuit of a drink), but it does make sense for that to be Legana, having escaped that rent from the Nascent.  Alright, I'll consider that question answered, thanks!"
Malazan,2w9zsh,henrikrh,21,Wed Feb 18 04:21:22 2015 UTC,"They dont usually directly involve themselves. They act through proxies and that dampens their power a bit. - I dont know if I read this or deducted it over time, but it seems to me that announcing your whereabouts and interests as an ascendant, makes noise and tells all your friendly and unfriendly ascendants alike what you are up to and what you are working towards. That is not healthy in the long run.  I dont remember what happened with Gruntle tbh, I just remember him as a reluctant proxy, which pretty much explains why some of the ascendants involvement doesnt manifest in ownage in all things at all times, because their mortal swords are not always willing to go all out at exactly the right moment.  Regarding powerful mages. I dont really think that is true. No mage can kill millions of people in one swing. Swathes of them sure, but I dont think even a soletaken in dragon form would be able to kill a million people in one move. So yeah. Icarium is a special case. We dont really know wtf happens whenever he blacks out. Just that he destroys everything around him. But at the same time, its pretty obvious from the books that he is a very special case, and that very special care has been taken with him to try and curb his wmd status."

Malazan,2w9zsh,shonryukku,6,Wed Feb 18 10:47:16 2015 UTC,"Something that everyone seems to forget: Treach represented unbridled, animalistic rage in war. Gruntle went into that when Stonny was raped in combat, basically massacring every Panion around him to the point where he was gaining followers to help in that cause and the blood began to resemble tiger marks. That's what drew Treach.  I'm surprised everyone in this thread seem to have forgotten about what happened to Stonny - it's a pretty big deal now and later in the series."

Malazan,2w9zsh,groovy_ash,16,Wed Feb 18 10:50:03 2015 UTC,"The Domin has mages too. In typical battles, mages serve just to nullify each other. In addition. using too much magic draws attention, or worse.  That being said, ascendants and gods are often weary about presenting themselves, it draws convergences and leads to death. You'll see this happen a few times in the series.  Gruntle was just 'luckly'. Treach ascended and was looking to firm up his base, he also didn't like the panion empire, so he found a warrior that was positioned just so.  Also, read on, the domin's has interesting goals."
Malazan,2w9zsh,i_am_not_you_or_me,6,Wed Feb 18 18:32:15 2015 UTC,"That being said, ascendants and gods are often wary about presenting themselves, it draws convergences and leads to death. You'll see this happen a few times in the series.   Yeah, this is the thing about ascendants. Power draws power, and it sucks to die, so they'd rather act through proxies."
Malazan,2w9zsh,Randomonous,8,Wed Feb 18 04:54:18 2015 UTC,"Gruntle was a special case. Treach is a young ascendant and doesn't know as much about how ascendants behave. IIRC he took a gamble with Gruntle because he needed to make his presence known and Gruntle was simply around so he just chose him. AFAIK ascendants and gods usually carefully choose their worshippers to represent them, like with Itkovian and co, but there are special cases.  Edit - to add more. I don't think that Gruntle was fully aware of what happened to him at the time. As time goes on, he does understand more. But I think it was Itkovian who realised that Fener had lost his status when he saw Gruntle and thought of a tiger instead of a boar.   Most mages aren't powerful enough to simply wipe out entire cities. There are very few characters that can do that themselves eg Rake, Kallor, Cotillion, Icarium, - but they usually just...don't. There was a Rake vs Enraged Icarium thread a few months back but it is spoiler heavy. And I don't think they can do it just using waves of magic. However, groups of mages are more than capable of doing this. But power attracts power, and that is dangerous for everyone involved. Which is why ascendants and gods act through proxies like priests or Mortal Swords because revealing themselves is dangerous. You will see this happen a few times, it's called a convergence and they are always thrilling to read.  Regarding Icarium, you will find out more about him in RG, DoD and tCG but I don't want to say anything else about him because it'll be a spoiler."

Malazan,2w9zsh,Silmariel,6,Wed Feb 18 19:40:28 2015 UTC,"Before I go on: the end of MoI does answer some of your questions.  If I recall correctly, Capustan as a city was particularly attuned to the various houses (perhaps on account of the Barghast Ancestors and such being buried there? I forget).  Mortal swords (as well as Shield-Anvils and Destriants) are not average people; they are usually already exceptional individuals, whose qualities draw particular gods into turning them into mortal manifestations of their will. It's not entirely clear that the Gods have direct control over this.  In any case, during Capustan's siege, Gruntle simply loses his shit when his companion (whose name I forget) is hurt / killed, and goes into a bloody killing rage. He was so ferocious that Trake was drawn to him, and saw in Gruntle potential to be a manifestation of his power. This enhances Gruntle's abilities, which is not quite the same as suddenly imbuing him with badassery.  Now, that being said: mortal swords, while formidable, are still mortal. Brukhalian was one seriously scary bastard, but regardless of the damage he inflicted, he was still defeated by the Pannion horde. They're not quite the WMD's they appear to be.  You should also be aware that the books are (necessarily) centered on the 'big players'. This is interspersed with plenty of action at the grunt-level, but the story largely shows you what the heavy-hitters are up to. As such, it seems like everyone you encounter is crazy powerful in some way, but you're only a third into the books. There's still quite a lot of cast for you to encounter.  Just bear in mind as you go forward: no one in the series is invulnerable. Power is relative in Erikson's work, and there are always methods of leveling the playing field."
Malazan,2w9zsh,titanemesis,2,Wed Feb 18 23:53:45 2015 UTC,"Power draws power, convergence is a theme of the books. A true Destriant of Fener, and real Mortal sword are in the city, which draws the rival, a new God of war treach. Keep reading and even more heavy weights are going to be drawn in. If Rake or another powerful mage went to the city who know what they would draw. Certainly the most powerful mages the Panion domin had, which until now have been held back since they haven't been needed. Power in the books is fluid and dangerous."
Malazan,2w9zsh,FR05TB1T3,1 point,Wed Feb 18 19:20:50 2015 UTC,"i think your giving some people a bit too much power.  sure, if rake had been inside it it probably would still have fallen, think of the seige of pale.  rake can do lots of damage, but he can only do so much.  the panion took capustan and barely used its most powerful forces, even vs gruntle and company. They just threw the tenescowri at them, and overwhelmed them.  icarium is a bit of a special case, but even if hed been there, he would have killed indescriminately, so it would still have fallen.   the panion was only eventually destroyed by 3 armies combining together, malazan, rakes, and the t'lan imass.  and there was a LOT of firepower in those 3 armies. and the malazan forces were wiped out, and they didnt even actually fight the pannion himself  (a powerful jaghut (semi) tyrant) or his matron k'chain chemaile slave (who would be a match for rake, if not more)  as for why trake chose gruntle, theres no reason specifically, trake died and he felt gruntle was a good choice for whatever reason."
Malazan,2w9zsh,Gaebryal,1 point,Wed Feb 18 21:50:58 2015 UTC,"Rake and the andii probably could have held the city against the forces currently arrayed. But there presence probably would have brought the Seer and all the power he had at his disposal, then its a different ball game."
Malazan,2w9zsh,FR05TB1T3,1 point,Wed Feb 18 19:54:49 2015 UTC,"Also, everyone keeps claiming that the city is doomed because of the numbers advantage of the Panion Domin, but the reality of the setting is that a single powerful mage can kill millions and that God's interfere on a daily basis to turn average warriors into nuclear bombs. How is no one accounting for the fact that someone like Gruntle might simply be inside the city? What if by chance Rake has been in the city, or Icarium? The entire Domin would have been slaughtered without a thought.   That's a problem with all of the books, IMHO (I'm currently at the end of Bonehunters).  Considering there's always hugely powerful wildcards and deus-ex-machina, it's hard to really feel tension about anything."
Malazan,2w9zsh,JebusGobson,3,Wed Feb 18 21:47:23 2015 UTC,"With the exception of GoTM, what other (blatant) uses of deus-ex machina have you encountered thus far?  My experience with the books was that no one is untouchable, regardless of how powerful they are. Some people are fettered in different ways (Rake, for example, can't be everyone at once; Brood can't go full Hammertime or he'll risk shattering Wu, etc.), but no one has complete unrestrained power. As such, even when the 'powerful' schemers scheme, there's a solid chance someone or something will fuck up their plans."
Malazan,2w9zsh,titanemesis,2,Wed Feb 18 08:59:14 2015 UTC,"With the exception of GoTM, what other (blatant) uses of deus-ex machina have you encountered thus far?   Well, plenty. From the top of my head [HEAVY SPOILERS FOLLOW]   In midnight tides, Iron Bars conveniently reveals himself to be so powerful he can kill (with a little help at the end) a grand total of six gods in one evening (one Soletaken and five Toblakai ) - despite all the foreshadowing about their power; Also in midnight tides, Tehols' manservant turns out to be an Elder God just is time to save him from death; In Bonehunters, Apsalar turns up (through pretty weird means) in Soleils temple just in time to fight off all the hounds of shadow;...   Etc. Etc. - I could probably go on for a while, but these are three pretty huge and obvious ones from just the last couple of hundred pages I read."
Malazan,2w9zsh,JebusGobson,2,Wed Feb 18 18:52:15 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see what you  mean. You're somewhat justified in thinking that at this point in your reading. The 'one-upping' that appears to go on has been known to annoy readers, and puts them off reading further into the series (where one discovers that that they're not just casual throw-away fixes). I can only tell you to press on, and report back if you make it through the entire set. Understandable if you're not a fan of it though; there is a huge cast of characters, and you're still only about 3/4 through meeting them all.  Without delving into spoiler territory, I can tell you that the best way to wrap your head around the bits that seem to lean on the ""magic problem solving solutions"" is to consider the series in it's totality, as opposed to book by book.   For example, Iron Bars' story is hardly complete by the end of Midnight Tides; it makes more sense to see this as his introduction into the halls of being a badass motherfucker. Remember, soletaken are not necessarily ascendants, and the five toblakai Full series Spoiler.   The same goes for Bugg. It's heavily hinted that he's more than he appears throughout the book; by the end of it he's officially stepping onto the stage as a major player. I don't quite recall the shifty means Apsalar uses to get there, so I can't speak to that."

Taralack Veed then replaces Mappo as Icarium's companion and Iskaral Pust attempts to heal Mappo.  Regarding character arc summaries, nothing really exists.

Malazan,2w3z4p,Mryappy,9,Mon Feb 16 20:03:09 2015 UTC,"My memory of the books might not be great - it's been approx 2.5 yrs since I finished them (having read over the course of a few months) - but isn't Leoman a bit older/more grizzled? He looks a little too smooth and young for me here, though the vibe of the pic overall is great."
Malazan,2w3z4p,Tumblehawk,8,Mon Feb 16 22:11:43 2015 UTC,"I got the impression that he was way older too, but that possibly came from one of the other books.  I've got from DG Ch. 5 DG Ch. 14 HoC Ch. 4  Then in SW and from the same spot.  So from reviewing that he's still fairly young - young enough to have dark hair still, that and it pretty much says he's 30 in DG - he's moustached later on but initially cleanly shaven, and the desert has made his skin dark and wrinkled. Then again, ICE describes him with dark eyes while Erikson with light blue, so that's contradictory."
Malazan,2w3z4p,MoranthMunitions,5,Mon Feb 16 22:51:09 2015 UTC,"Good show, man, thanks. Never imagined him any younger than thirty, but sometimes those little details (thirty years...) miss ya when yer reading! I love Mryappy's drawings so def don't want to seem like a debbie downer here, was just wondering."

Malazan,2w3z4p,Lobsterpunch,2,Mon Feb 16 20:13:59 2015 UTC,"Interesting point. Yea they're supposed to be tucked into his waist belt, but I see what you mean... If it's a big problem I can work on making that clearer via shading or something. Thanks for the feedback :)"
Malazan,2w3z4p,mr_me100,2,Mon Feb 16 20:17:48 2015 UTC,"I agree about the handles--at first the parts that are tucked into his belt looked like straps, but I think you're right that some shading where the belt lifts away from his body to go around the handles would help.  Still, this is one of your bests. Good job and thank you."

Malazan,2w3z4p,Eltotsira,2,Mon Feb 16 21:25:55 2015 UTC,Haha I'll definitely consider making the flail heads bigger but can someone confirm the mustache? I had no idea lol
Malazan,2w3z4p,angrywhitedude,2,Mon Feb 16 22:01:32 2015 UTC,Make everything about the flails bigger.  They should have handles long enough to be used two-handed.  The heads should be larger than a softball with spikes sticking out.
Malazan,2w3z4p,Eltotsira,2,Tue Feb 17 06:47:26 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna make the flail heads bigger but it's specifically mentioned that the flails are one handed. I'm going to draw them out of his belt though, which should reveal their appropriate size!"

Malazan,2w0sjp,HowkeCotchmeEye,1 point,Sun Feb 15 23:58:28 2015 UTC,"I actually did the same thing back when I first read MoI. I ended up finishing Deadhouse, started the first hundred pages of MoI and stopped due to both getting swamped in life, and being mentally worn out from Deadhouse.  Made for a very confusing read when I got back into it. Hope you enjoy the ride! MoI is a good one!"
Malazan,2w0sjp,Therrester,1 point,Mon Feb 16 05:50:30 2015 UTC,I think I read this one the fastest. Now I really want the audio book. Lots of great scenes in this one.
Malazan,2w0sjp,strawberrysundaeandt,1 point,Mon Feb 16 12:13:24 2015 UTC,Just finished this one last night and it's by far my favorite. The other 2 took a bit to get started but this one the characters already held my interest the stories were interesting and the battles were epic. So far my favorite.
Malazan,2w0sjp,yokramer,1 point,Wed Feb 18 02:00:09 2015 UTC,Its so good so far. I'm about 300 pages in. I read these books so slowly because of how intricate everything is. Just trying to absorb everything and enjoy it!
Malazan,2w0sjp,JimmyTMalice,0,Wed Feb 18 02:34:29 2015 UTC,"I'm reading it currently and I'm finding it much better than Deadhouse Gates. I really missed Quick Ben's excursions into the warrens and the links to the distant past and the gods. DG was more of a mundane story really, and the Chain of Dogs in particular just bored me."
Malazan,2vzrby,Eelin,6,Sun Feb 15 18:50:42 2015 UTC,"I'm also pretty new to the series and posted here a few times. I recently started Deadhouse Gates, which is the second book, and I'm definitely hooked - for what that's worth!  When I first started the series I was also a bit doubtful about it. I honestly didn't think I'd finish the first book, let alone the entire series (and it isn't short either), but now I just can't get enough of it. If I didn't have to go out to work or make the most of my free time trying to uphold a social life and friendships on weekends, I'd dedicate almost every hour now to reading the series. I'm not kidding!  It took me a while to really get into Gardens of the Moon because of all of overwhelming confusion, but when things started to make a bit more sense and falling into place, with new characters and areas being introduced, I couldn't stop.  So to answer your first question: just a little after halfway of Gardens of the Moon is when I realised I was going to love this series.  And to answer the second question: well, I don't really have an answer. There seems to be a lot of things in the books that don't initially make sense, so now, after reading that same response in this subreddit fairly often, I've decided to just 'go with it'. Even now I come across things that I don't understand, but I just take it as it is and hope it'll be a little clearer later on!"
Malazan,2vzrby,Tygett,2,Sun Feb 15 19:56:00 2015 UTC,Thank you for such a full and in detail reply! I will power on through. I have read a lot of epic fantasy but just find this one rather intense. I will just power on through. Thanks again.

Think of it like someone telling you a story about WW2, assuming you totally understood Earth, humans, European culture and most importantly world history - but you can't stop them to reveal that ignorance, so just keep listening until it makes sense."

Malazan,2vzrby,AllWrong74,6,Sun Feb 15 20:32:26 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit shy here because I don't know at what point you are in book one (I assume), but here are my two grains  It was all pretty confusing at first, but I knew I was in for a treat at that whole 'Paran meets Lorn in a ground littered with chewed up bodies. And horses. Goddammit horses'. But it's only the beginning yet and you feel quite overwhelmed - or suffocated - by the sheer amount of stuff going one.   Then I met Kruppe.   Then I met Rake.   By then I was all 'ok, this is cool' but still overwhelmed. I often read two or three books at a time and I confess I used to spend 2 days reading the others before going back.   It was then that I read a interview with Erickson where he goes about compassion as being a major theme on his books and something clicked inside of me.  From that point onward I was aware of a constant tune, an intermittent note that always made me go back to the book. I mean, there are lots of good stuff in there, lots of awesomeness, but there's this deep connection I felt but wasn't really conscious about.   It's a subjective thing, but keep on tracks. If you're anything like me in this regard, you'll savor and cherish these characters development.   If I may give you an advice, muffle down the confusion and bewilderment and attune yourself to the other sentiments the writing draws on you."

Malazan,2vzrby,purpleasfuck,3,Mon Feb 16 12:24:29 2015 UTC,"I got hooked later than most, currently reading MoI, and what really made everything click and get me excited were two characters introduced in DG: names from DG. I honestly barely finished the first book, and only started the second because a friend was so insistent. You definitely slowly learn everything about everything as the series goes, and its always exciting when you get a new piece of lore to fit into the puzzle.  Here's how I pronounce a bunch of the names, but everyone does it differently:  Ganoes Paran: GAN(a as in canon)-os(o as in nose, s as in mess) per(as in perimeter)-AHN(as in on)  Tayschrenn:TAY(as in taylor)-shren(sh as in shush, en as in hen)  Kalam:ka(as in kapow)-LAM(am as in Vietnam)  Lorn: just like corn but with an L  Laseen: la(as in la bamba)-SEEN(exactly like the word seen)  Onos T'Oolan: OH(as in oh no)-nos(no as in no, s as in mess) tuh(uh as in bruh)-OO(as in boo)-lon(just like the word lawn)  Crokus: CROC(as in crocodile)-us(like the word us)  Murillio:muh(as in m'lady)-RILL(as in frill)-ee(as in free)-oh(as in oh no)  Rallick Nom:RAL(like pal with an r)-ik(as in ick, that's gross) NOM(as in nominal)  Kruppe:Just like cup, but with an r in there  There's a bunch of other names, so just let me know if you wanna know how I pronounce them"

Malazan,2vzrby,AllWrong74,3,Tue Feb 17 21:43:29 2015 UTC,"When I read Gardens of the Moon I referred back constantly to the Dramatis Personae, the glossary, and the maps.  Every time I heard a new name or place, I skipped back/forward and skimmed them, in order to orient myself.  I also consulted a world map which helped me sort out the named continents (this one here will serve although there are others).  Even though it is laborious to constantly stop reading to check the indexes, as others have noted about a third to halfway through the book you won't have to do it as much.  I also did this with DG (new continent, and the book jumps around a lot between several groups of characters).  If you follow a close reading of the text like this it will minimize your sense of feeling lost and will equip you for later books as the glossary gets thinned out and eventually dropped altogether.  I found Gardens a pleasant read, but Deadhouse Gates is what clinched this series for me and it remains one of several high watermarks.  Keep at it, you'll be glad you did."
Malazan,2vzrby,angrywhitedude,1 point,Mon Feb 16 19:20:36 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot! The problem is i am reading it on my kindle fire so it makes jumping back a bit problematic ahah. I will stick with it though.
Malazan,2vzrby,tenement,4,Mon Feb 16 21:46:47 2015 UTC,"I found it difficult to get through the first third or so of the book, but it IS worth pushing through. As soon as you get to the part titled Darujistan things start coming together more, and the cast of characters gets rounded off so you don't have to continue learning many new ones from that point.    As far as the Warrens, I'm only a book ahead of you, and the mythos is still being explained. But it does begin to make sense in book 1. Basically, warrens are like links to magical dimensions that have several uses and affinities to various gods or forms of magic. By now I'm sure you've seen they can be used to travel between locations, as well as have their energy drawn upon to cast spells or influence the mortal realm in other ways. But basically, think of them as magical dimensions that mages can open doors to, to access their power. [edit] The warrens you have access to depend in part on your race (human or otherwise), and have different affects, so a mage with a Shadow warren can use stealth and secrecy spells, while a mage with a Light warren can divine truth and find out secrets, etc. Don't worry too much about memorizing which warrens do what, the plot will explain enough as you go. ;)"

Malazan,2vzrby,timefortiesto,2,Mon Feb 16 12:22:05 2015 UTC,"The Darujhistan part is really awesome. I can relate to you, I started this series not so long ago, I pushed past the 1/3 of the book, then I started really loving it. The second book in the series steps it up a lot, and it even keeps getting better and better (I am at book 7 atm)"
Malazan,2vzrby,aleifur,2,Mon Feb 16 17:53:22 2015 UTC,"Think of warrens as the world beyond the world, an overlay of our world if you will. Its a separate place all by itself, but if you're a mage you can adjust how closely they are to our world. So, taking Tayshrenn and his Warren of Telas as an example, he can bring Telas to us, and call forth fire, or if he wanted he could go to Telas, travel for a while and then pop himself back into our world. However, the warren of fire is not exactly a nice place, so people prefer to travel nice warrens.... Like shadow! Or the Warren of death, Hoods path. This process of manipulating the warren is hard on the mage physically, and if they do too much, too quickly the warren can kill them, because they are the conduit the warren has to travel through to get here."
Malazan,2vzrby,Dan_e77,1 point,Mon Feb 16 07:02:39 2015 UTC,Thank you! I presumed this much from what I have read. I would just eventually love to learn how warrens were made and how you learn to manipulate them etc.

The writing style changes a good amount.  The ""warren/god thing"" doesn't ever get outright explained.  Erikson doesn't really answer questions or give info dumps.  However, you see enough that you can pretty well figure it out by around the end of book 2 or midway through book 3.  Also, just FYI.  All of the books start out a little slow.  Every single one of them, however, ends with a bang.  If there's one thing Erikson does better than anything else, it's end a book."

Malazan,2vu0go,singul4r1ty,6,Tue Feb 17 16:58:02 2015 UTC,"They all work well but I feel like they're all too attractive for Makazan. Not that they all are described as ugly, but the characters are based on their personality and not necessarily physical appearance, and if they're a motley crew of extraordinarily handsome people it doesn't really add up."
Malazan,2vu0go,TheBionicBosom,2,Sat Feb 14 06:22:24 2015 UTC,"Well, yes, but it's not like you can just find unattractive people who've been in movies. Even ugly characters are just attractive actors in makeup."
Malazan,2vu0go,ZeppelinJ0,1 point,Sat Feb 14 06:30:18 2015 UTC,I'm sure there are plenty of actors who aren't quite so extremely handsome... It's not that they can't be individually attractive but for all of them to be like that makes it look like the avengers
Malazan,2vu0go,Professor_McWhoopass,2,Sat Feb 14 06:38:41 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree.  It'd just be wrong to cast perfect looking, standard actors for adaptations of books written by this guy. He just works too hard to avoid all the normal casting tropes for everyone to be so pretty."

Malazan,2vu0go,BirdBathandBeyond,3,Sat Feb 14 23:08:58 2015 UTC,"Love the Dujek casting. The Tehol one is great too, not sure how I feel with Bugg. Fiddler meh, needs more grit. Whiskey Jack is cool. Olyphant is a good choice. Oddly though you have Ganoes being older then Fiddler or Hedge, which seems wrong. I think I'd like the kruppe character, the acting is super important here. The rest seem pretty good. Would really need to see them in costume.   Personal bias but I really want Dicaprio and Russell Crowe (Whiskey?) in here"
Malazan,2vu0go,HumbleAsFudge,1 point,Sat Feb 14 05:12:49 2015 UTC,"Olyphant without a beard will still look younger than Ewan with a red beard. Ganoes and Fiddler are within 2 years of each other. And, let us not forget, Fiddler's age/appearance changes drastically. The same with Hedge.....at one point I do not believe his character ages anymore."
Malazan,2vu0go,TheBionicBosom,2,Sat Feb 14 08:24:05 2015 UTC,Very true about the ages. Just that paran meets a young adult Fiddler when he's a small child it set the mood for me right at the start. So I always perceived them at least 10 years apart. Anyways they deserve to be older.
Malazan,2vu0go,hero2goat,3,Sat Feb 14 08:46:05 2015 UTC,"Holy molly. From all the ones Ive seen from the previous thread, this is by far the best.

Malazan,2vu0go,chappyyy,3,Sun Feb 15 01:40:42 2015 UTC,"Ages man... Everyone ignores ages on these things. Ganoes, Apsalar, Tehol, and Brys are all far younger than the actors here. Ganoes is super young in the beginning and like late 20s by the end. Apsalar is pretty similar. Tehol is only a little older than Brys, who, if I recall, is just over 20 years old. I could nitpick the ages of some others, but age is a particularly big part of these characters."
Malazan,2vu0go,Asimov_800,2,Sat Feb 14 06:02:03 2015 UTC,I casted them about older on purpose. There aren't any established/good actors that are that young and are solid bets. I choose them approximately a decade older. Do you WANT another Hayden Christensen?
Malazan,2vu0go,MarquisHalimOndore,2,Sat Feb 14 08:26:41 2015 UTC,"While that's a valid point and no one wants another Hayden Christensen(although, one could argue it was Lucas that was to blame, but that's irrelevant right now, I just feel bad for him), there are certainly actors who are less than a decade older that could play the roles. I just couldn't see Timothy Oliphant as Ganoes Paran without it looking like this.   Edit: Fixed the link."
Malazan,2vu0go,Gaebryal,1 point,Sat Feb 14 15:44:10 2015 UTC,"I totally agree on the age thing.  Young unknown actors often do a great job and become house hold names.  Look at Game of Thrones, most of those actors were largely unknown in North America and now they are stars.  The writing and directing is often what makes characters and the actors that play them famous."
Malazan,2vu0go,PhumDuck,1 point,Sat Feb 14 21:04:43 2015 UTC,"Dont mean to come across as disrespectful but you obviously are not well aquaintanced with movie make up and casting roles. Movies will always cast actors 5-10 years older than the role, if they would use actors of the actual age it tends to look awkward. Make up and hair is prepared to make them look younger, it somehow looks more natural on film."
Malazan,2vu0go,unseenarchives,1 point,Sat Feb 14 13:58:52 2015 UTC,"I understand that, it's always annoyed me, I wish they'd just admit that people are awkward and cast them the right age, like Freaks and Geeks. It just looks silly when they have 30 year olds playing high school students, but casting like that is accepted so I didn't criticize the ones 5-10 years older. However, unless you want to go full Benjamin Button with your special effects, a 46 year old Timothy Oliphant does not make sense to play a 20 year old. The ones I mentioned are all about 20-30 years older than the character. Middle age actors shouldn't play people in their 20s - maybe Keanu could, but he's immortal, so that's different.   Edit: words and stuff"

Malazan,2vrlb4,TriscuitCracker,2,Fri Feb 13 14:17:44 2015 UTC,Agree completely memories of ice was the best book in the series imo.

Malazan,2vrlb4,AllWrong74,9,Fri Feb 13 14:51:08 2015 UTC,"The end of Toll the Hounds still just blows my mind. Every time you think that it can't get more intense, more epic characters just show up and shit happens."

Malazan,2vrlb4,aleifur,3,Mon Feb 16 08:30:52 2015 UTC,"If I had to pick my top three books of the series, I would find it difficult to do. There are too many amazing moments from so many different points in the series. Since I know more about the world now, in rereads I've discovered some cleverly hidden foreshadowing I had no idea existed, and a lot of scenes have taken on new meanings. Which has only added to my collection of favorite parts.   If I have to make a decision, it would be Deadhouse Gates, House of Chains, and Midnight Tides. Mostly because of how they revolve around one another. All the storylines are connected to each other in one way or another but these three had my favorite relationship. Plus, the characters, climaxes, and overall stories in each one blew me away.   Again, that was a tough decision. Even now I hate having made it. I want to mention so many great parts of the Malazan world, but you forced my hand.  With a parting note, I must mention that the novella Crack'd Pot Trail is my favorite book of all time. Best to wait till you've at least read Memories of Ice, and been introduced to the main characters of this novella series, before you read CPT. But that is the best book in the series. Hands down."
Malazan,2vrlb4,Blusummers,4,Fri Feb 13 17:03:33 2015 UTC,For me it'll always be The Bonehunters. I found the whole book to be incredibly satisfying and riveting.
Malazan,2vrlb4,JediMasterZao,2,Fri Feb 13 19:42:57 2015 UTC,One of the few books to START with a bang. I was sweating literally because of the circumstances the Malazans found themselves in. Amazing chapters. And then you get the onslaught rampage-fest at the end.
Malazan,2vrlb4,TriscuitCracker,-2,Fri Feb 13 19:48:48 2015 UTC,Aye and the under-the-city sequence was straight-up amazing. Simply couldnt put down the book 'till those characters got out of the undercity!

The Crippled God is the best fantasy book I have ever read. The last three chapters and the epilogue are just complete catharsis.

You're at the best parts of the series IMO, but in truth, the whole series starts on a bang right around there and never gets dull again.  Oh yeah, but Memories of Ice was my favorite.

In short like mentioned, all the books end with a huge splash. Dust of Dreams ends on a cliffhanger, since the last two books are should be read as one."

(taken from a post i made the other day)   [...] it was the army of savages that made me realize that I would love the series. When I first meet them I am told they are undisciplined rabble. Only to have that notion immediately snatched away when they stop a riot and enforce order with steely eyed discipline that awes even the malazans.  That was the moment when I realized Erikson gave me a trope and used my expectations against me. He gave me just enough rope to hang my self. He had done something new and exiting and the possibilities were suddenly endless. To tropes he was the pied piper and he made them (and me) dance to his tune. And by doing that he had made the world and it's inhabitants subtly more real.  When the Wickans stopped that riot Erickson told me that the rules had changed and that I was in for one hell of a ride. That is the moment I realized I loved this series."""

If I was excited to read this series before, now I am ECSTATIC.   The funny thing is, I got halfway through DG a year ago, then ended up losing the book in a move. I have been looking for it for months, when I happened to find a SINGLE copy of it buried in the back of a local used bookstore, and it was the ONLY Malazan book they had! I was so happy I almost hugged the store owner. So I started from the beginning to refresh myself, and I'm just now at the part where I lost the book last time. I won't lose it again!"

Malazan,2vrlb4,aleifur,1 point,Fri Feb 13 22:01:44 2015 UTC,"[some spoilers]     Now that you mention it, it DOES seem odd that in the first book gods and ascendants were appearing left and right to intervene - but in DG so far there hasn't been a single appearance by anything of the sort.    I'm also confused as to why nobody makes a big deal that Icarium is half-Jaghut. Weren't the Jaghuts one of the founding races that went extinct? GotM hinged on The Big Bad being a Jaghut brought back to life, and yet here's this little old wizard whose somehow part Jag and no explanation as to how or why this is possible."
Malazan,2vrlb4,Oathsend,2,Fri Feb 13 22:10:48 2015 UTC,"The reason there was a lot more Ascendant and God intervention during Gardens of the Moon was because many of the events that occur during Gardens have more major and long-term effects than those in Deadhouse. That's not to say that the events of Deadhouse aren't a major factor in the story onwards - they are - but from the perspective of the Ascendants/Gods, what happened in Gardens is far more important. You'll find out why later on, beginning in Memories.  The reason no one really makes a big deal about Icarium is that, over the years, he has become almost a forgotten piece of the world. END OF DG (kind of, not a major spoiler) Icarium has been alive for a long time, as you may have noticed from Icarium being mentioned as the creator of the Wheel of Ages in Darujhistan, which had been given to the city thousands of years past. His past will be further delved into in House of Chains and Reapers Gale.  Also, Jaghut? Not really a big deal. They're an immensely powerful people, but as you'll find throughout the series, they don't really contribute to the plot or background of the world, apart from a select few. The reason the Jaghut Tyrant was a BIG DEAL was because he was one of the few Jaghut who began to use his power to subjugate lesser peoples, which is a big no-no in Jag culture. Also as you've said, the Jaghut are extinct - the people of the Malaz world don't really understand who and what they were.   Edit: Also, I can't really pick a favorite book. Deadhouse, Memories, Reapers and Toll the Hounds all stick out to me because of their spectacular endings, but every single book has had parts I have immensely enjoyed."

Of course, that was a movie that encouraged you to try to figure it out.  Normally, I don't bother (Harry Potter being a notable exception), but Erikson rammed this one down our throats."
Malazan,2vrmh6,AllWrong74,10,Sat Feb 14 05:09:20 2015 UTC,"It's not supposed to be emotional because it's a shocking twist, it's supposed to be emotional because a character you theoretically care about died.  EDIT: Also I thought Itkovian was thinking about himself dieing, not Whiskyjack?"
Malazan,2vrmh6,SageOfTheWise,3,Fri Feb 13 16:00:42 2015 UTC,"As Whiskeyjack was leaving, it was said that Itkovian couldn't shake the feeling that they weren't going to meet again, or something to the effect. This instantly suggested, to me at least, that it would be Whiskeyjack that died, as he was a more central character."
Malazan,2vrmh6,parabola01,5,Fri Feb 13 16:45:02 2015 UTC,"Are you asking why Erikson chose to make it obvious, or how he made it obvious? If how, /u/AllWrong74 explained it. If why, that could step on some later series spoilers..."
Malazan,2vrmh6,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Fri Feb 13 15:20:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was poorly worded; I meant the latter. You say it could lead to spoilers, but I can see literally nothing that could ever happen where we would need to know a he was going to die without a character stating it or even directly suggesting it. My gut says it's not the last we see of Whiskeyjack, though, and that would be frustrating. Death is already starting to feel inconsequential."
Malazan,2vrmh6,Ganoes_,3,Fri Feb 13 15:41:30 2015 UTC,"Well, this isn't outright spoilers, let's call it rather pointed implication, but I'll tag it anyway since it's still beyond hte scope of the topic, though I'm blanking on which book it's revealed in (Toll The Hounds i think?) TTH?"
Malazan,2vrmh6,MoranthMunitions,4,Fri Feb 13 16:20:23 2015 UTC,"that just means you're the kind of person who enjoys looking for themes and hints in literature.  Erikson writes for people like you who enjoy noticing these things. Other fantasy authors whom I refuse to name give you no advance notice at all that your favorite character is about to die in a terrible way.  And just think of how Whiskeyjack died. Not so terrible, eh?"
Malazan,2vrmh6,Ganoes_,2,Fri Feb 13 15:43:13 2015 UTC,Other fantasy authors ... give you no advance notice at all that your favorite character is about to die   Who does that? Unless you're really adamant about refusing to name them. I'm curious because I feel like most of the books I've read lately have had at least some foreshadowing for deaths of major characters.
Malazan,2vrmh6,Landmarkmoon,2,Sat Feb 14 03:27:18 2015 UTC,"I was referencing Martin.  To be fair, he does provide lots of foreshadowing in his books, but since so many characters die or almost die or don't die at all following the foreshadowing, sometimes you're quite surprised.  ""no advance notice"" is unfair.  Martin's books are full of characters dying, so you can't take any foreshadowing he provides seriously."
Malazan,2vrmh6,Blusummers,3,Sat Feb 14 12:33:59 2015 UTC,"You will see later why, this is how he does it. And it's all for a reason;)"
Malazan,2vrmh6,TriscuitCracker,2,Fri Feb 13 16:07:30 2015 UTC,"The whole series is full of foreshadowing. It can be easier to miss in the beginning, because you're still trying to get a grasp of the world and what's happening. I've read the series 3 times, and I'm constantly shocked at the foreshadowing. GotM, alone, has some stuff in it that blew me away as to SE's scope and planning.   There's a million reasons why Whiskeyjack's death was coming and a million reasons why it works. But, I'm not willing to spoil anything. My suggestion is to keep reading. And keep analyzing what you read. SE does everything for a reason. In fact, here's a great source: http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/2vnkyp/rfantasy_exclusive_authorial_intent_discussion/"
Malazan,2vrmh6,PaxCecilia,2,Fri Feb 13 17:14:11 2015 UTC,"Personally, I didn't see it coming at all. So it hit me like a ton of bricks. On re-read, sure hindsight is 20/20, but I guess I just missed the clues. There's just so much in these books it's easy to miss something or gloss over without truly analyzing it."
Malazan,2vrmh6,SerBronnofBlackwater,2,Fri Feb 13 17:31:45 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I got this spoiled for me ahead of time :( and knowing it was going to happen made every single one of those lines tough to read and reminded me he wasn't long for the world. I think knowing ahead of time sort of shattered the sadness.  If I had Itkovian's ending spoiled for me, I would have been pissed. I cried after reading his last part in MoI."
Malazan,2vrmh6,xolotl92,1 point,Sat Feb 14 20:16:16 2015 UTC,"My first time reading it I didn't even think that. Up to that point in my life, I was reading books with straight forward plots and characters. What I mean by that is I didn't think Whiskeyjack was untouchable in the series but I assumed that he would make if past Book 3 of 10 lol."
Malazan,2vq6ax,Iliad_Keys,48,Fri Feb 13 03:11:19 2015 UTC,I pronounce it with a hard 'g' sound. like 'gehn-uh-back-iss'. I feel like a dork now if I've been saying it wrong this whole time.

Malazan,2vq6ax,Fnarley,1 point,Fri Feb 13 05:38:16 2015 UTC,SE said the first narrator for loads wrong but it was too late to change it when they switched narrators mid series
Malazan,2vq6ax,TRAIANVS,2,Fri Feb 13 09:40:25 2015 UTC,And this is why a pronunciation guide is a good thing.
Malazan,2vq6ax,Fnarley,1 point,Fri Feb 13 10:01:49 2015 UTC,Yeah it could go right in the dramatis personae and glossary sections.
Malazan,2vq6ax,vancity-,1 point,Fri Feb 13 10:48:49 2015 UTC,"I was really mad about the switch. Thankfully they did it at a fairly natural breaking point, but the first narrator had the definitive Kruppe voice to me. Now when I read the books, it's the narrators Kruppe I hear in my head."

Malazan,2vq6ax,Sex-Haver,1 point,Fri Feb 13 15:14:57 2015 UTC,I hate how Erikson made mall malle with the 'e' on the end. I makes my pronounce it 'mall-ay' for some reason. The same thing with the Trygalle Trade Guild.

Sure, people sometimes come to a consensus about certain names, but really as long a you know what you're talking about there's no problem.  I also like to think that the characters in the story have differing pronunciation. It's inevitable with all the different cultures and languages that are present in the Malazan empire."
Malazan,2vq6ax,ScottyBeans,1 point,Fri Feb 13 21:49:28 2015 UTC,First way is how I say it in my head
Malazan,2vnucy,elquesogrande,7,Thu Feb 12 16:05:18 2015 UTC,"Interesting read. It reinforces all of the reasons why I love his work so much.   It's so rare to encounter a world of literary work where you can read a passage, ponder it's significance and what it's meant to convey, all in the knowledge that the author crafted each line, arc and theme as carefully as a watchmaker."
Malazan,2vnucy,titanemesis,3,Thu Feb 12 18:20:24 2015 UTC,In this aspect I have found Erikson to be unique.
Malazan,2vnucy,HumbleAsFudge,1 point,Thu Feb 12 23:11:59 2015 UTC,"Indeed. There are other authors who are meticulous about other details - Tolkien, for example, painstakingly mapped distances, seasons and geography, not to mention inventing a complete language for Middle-Earth - but I haven't encountered anyone who has layered intricacies as well as Erikson."
Malazan,2vnucy,titanemesis,3,Fri Feb 13 13:59:11 2015 UTC,Thanks for the share.
Malazan,2voq7i,possumman,10,Thu Feb 12 20:19:14 2015 UTC,"By far the best thing about House of Chains is the introduction of Karsa Orlong.  I love how just about every other character in this series comes from mysterious past, which makes their motivations even more mysterious.  It is rare for Erikson to share an actual origin story with us, to expose a character from the ground up.  With Karsa, we know exactly where he comes from, and while we don't always know where he's going or what exactly he's thinking since he seems to just run on pure instinct, we always know that he's going to fuck something up that needs fucking up.  The other part of House of Chains that I loved and hated at the same time was the death of Felisin Paran.  That final scene where she faces Tavore and just gets stabbed without even swinging her sword...absolutely heart-wrenching!  Even more tragic, in my opinion, since Tavore seems to have no idea (or does she? don't tell me, I don't know yet!).  I wanted to somehow scream through the book at Tavore that she just killed her younger sister."
Malazan,2voq7i,DrinkyDrank,2,Fri Feb 13 00:11:45 2015 UTC,I can't find the quote but Erikson wrote Karsa in response to criticism that he couldn't write a single PoV. I guess no one said that again after House of Chains.
Malazan,2voq7i,aleifur,1 point,Mon Feb 16 08:46:50 2015 UTC,"Ha!  Erikson is a genius, I'm sure he can write anything he wants."

Malazan,2voq7i,mykunos,3,Thu Feb 12 21:30:54 2015 UTC,"I just finished HoC as well the other day. I'd say I share similar sentiments about the book - not as enamoring or engaging as DHG (my favorite in the series so far) was to me, yet I still really loved it and enjoyed the entire ride.  I will say that I think HoC had the most exciting and surprising revelations in the lore and history so far. The Malazan universe felt massive and deep before in the previous books but it felt like it just got so much bigger after HoC.  I also think HoC felt the most balanced in terms of character arc enjoyment. In the other books there was always a character arc that I liked less than the others or liked one over the others significantly more. But in HoC I really enjoyed all characters point of view equally.  As for your question about why Lostara clocked Pearl over the head once in Raraku, I'm not completely sure but I'm content with my explanation. As far as I see it, Cotillion didn't wanna take any chances with pearl interfering or inadvertently messing up Kalams mission. Even if it feels that they are on the same side, Pearls absolute allegiance is to the Empress and her wishes and perhaps Cotillion didn't wanna take any chances with that.  I just started Midnight Tides and am already a couple chapters into it. Good thing Erickson has already conditioned us to the concept of being introduced to loads of new characters each book or else I'd be pretty discouraged.  Good reading to you and I hope you continue to enjoy the series!"
Malazan,2voq7i,SageOfTheWise,2,Thu Feb 12 23:28:50 2015 UTC,Cotillion and the claw are natural enemies pretty much. and Pearl is a really powerful and nasty member of the claw. Cotillion really wanted him out of the way.
Malazan,2voq7i,mykunos,1 point,Fri Feb 13 07:22:15 2015 UTC,That still kinda confuses me. Even if they don't like each other it seems Cotillion and the Claw have the same goal of sabotaging the oasis and assassinating important people within Sha'ik's camp. Maybe Cotillion just wants the Claw to know as little about Shadowthrone's operations as possible.
Malazan,2voq7i,kvothe,2,Fri Feb 13 07:45:54 2015 UTC,Never assume you know what Shadowthrone and Cotillion want.

Malazan,2voq7i,AreYouReadyToReddit,2,Mon Feb 16 20:24:09 2015 UTC,"I got quite confused by all the scheming/plotting in Shaik's camp - Febryl, Bithidal, Kamist and all that - and wasn't really sure why Karsa killed them all.   Because each and every one of them was plotting to kill/exploit Sha'ik, who he as Toblakai was sworn to protect.  He was tired of waiting and opted for a direct approach.  I like to think that he didn't kill them sooner because he was distracted by his ""gods"", making their likeness, and the Crippled God's machinations around him."

Malazan,2vkpq7,AreYouReadyToReddit,4,Thu Feb 12 15:10:21 2015 UTC,I almost wonder if the Seguleh would work better as a City State that is aggressive against anyone they meet lol.

Malazan,2vkpq7,Ganoes-Stabro_Paran,3,Fri Feb 13 04:42:02 2015 UTC,"Just as an FYI, there is a 4e (expand, explore, exploit, exterminate) game out there called Endless Legend. One of the factions is called the ""Vaulters"". Their ranged units are ""marines"" and they use crossbows and shields. One of their hero types is the ""Chief Sapper"".    Additionally, you get to equip and rename any base unit you have, so I'm running around with a bunch of Wickan cavalry and BridgeBurner marine archers, and using an assimilated faction (Urces, kindof like ogres) that I renamed and specced out to ""Heavies"" as my infantry.    Pretty fun game, and you wouldn't have to mod it to play as the Malazans. Just respec your units and heroes. Give it a look if you want."

Malazan,2vkpq7,aleifur,1 point,Thu Feb 12 14:16:11 2015 UTC,"Great idea.  Some thoughts off the top of my head:  -Malazans have a superior crossbow unit and a sapper unit, and unhappiness in occupied cities decreases twice as fast (due to the claw and the cull)  -Pannion Domain generates Tenescowri units when you raze a city or pillage a tile  -Moranth renaissance units of some type that have abilities similar to helicopters in terms of movement  -Seven Cities generate extra religion per desert tile and possesses an enhanced religious ability: Dryjhna grants +20% production for military units and doubles unhappiness in former cities now occupied by another empire; maybe also grants a combat bonus for units fighting near cities under the influence of the whirlwind.  -Seguleh are a hostile, militaristic city state which grants unique units.  -Wickans get double the number of horses, mounted units get +1 movement, units fight at full strength regardless of health  Please do this.  *Edits for spelling, formatting, clarity, and new ideas"

Malazan,2vk19p,_zont_,2,Wed Feb 11 19:18:21 2015 UTC,I always imagined Dujek with a big beard. Don't the books describe him as having one (I'm thinking in GOTM) or am I just remembering wrong?  Very cool depiction either way.
Malazan,2vk19p,Asimov_800,3,Thu Feb 12 07:59:21 2015 UTC,All of the descriptions I've read online describe him with shaving cream on his face so I assume he shaves it all away. Could be completely wrong though haha. Thanks for the input and support!
Malazan,2vk19p,AreYouReadyToReddit,2,Thu Feb 12 16:57:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah I always imagined him with a big grey beard, wearing a permanent scowl/grimace too."
Malazan,2vjqlm,Noderator,12,Wed Feb 11 16:21:36 2015 UTC,"Dramatis Personae at the beginning of each book. Just keep referring back to it as you read/get introduced to a new character.  I'll give a few points on the main:  Tattersail: High mage (means she's baws at magic) who is trying to get to the bottom of a conspiracy.  Adjunct Lorn: Tracking a mystery central to the whole book  Ganoes Paran: New officer, aide to Lorn, also trying to piece together the mystery which could be linked to Tattersail's.  Whiskeyjack/Bridgeburners: Tasked with infiltrating and subjugating Darujhistan for the empire.  Crockus: A lucky thief who falls in love.  Kruppe: A modest patron of the Phoenix Inn, friend to Crokus."
Malazan,2vjqlm,SerBronnofBlackwater,2,Wed Feb 11 16:33:19 2015 UTC,I'd definitely echo Ser Bronn's advice to refer back to the Dramatis Personae as you go - that's what it's there for!
Malazan,2vjqlm,Tumblehawk,1 point,Wed Feb 11 16:51:48 2015 UTC,I have an ebook so I didn't know of that so I'll check for it. Thank you.
Malazan,2vjqlm,MoranthMunitions,5,Wed Feb 11 17:17:55 2015 UTC,"Don't go anywhere else on the wiki until you've read the full series, however it has a page for every Dramatis Personae, which I'll directly link to here.  Book 1 - Gardens of the Moon  Book 2 - Deadhouse Gates  Book 3 - Memories of Ice  They can be useful to refer back to as you read and, from experience, it's a real pain to do using the ebooks. Looking at them there will let you quickly refer to it on your phone or something I suppose if you wanted to.  Anyway, if you search on there using the book title and dramatis it'll drop down with something like ""Gardens of the Moon/Dramatis Personae"", which will take you to the page about that. The main pages for each book may contain spoilers (as do most pages), which is why you should avoid them and only go directly to the dramatis personae pages."
Malazan,2vjqlm,Foliagus,1 point,Wed Feb 11 22:09:32 2015 UTC,Thank you this will help a whole lot!
Malazan,2vjqlm,HumbleAsFudge,1 point,Wed Feb 11 23:20:19 2015 UTC,"This is a weakness, in this series.  Having the book means you can frequently check the map and dramatis personae, along with the glossary at the end.  If you get confused easily, contemplate it past book 2."
Malazan,2vjqlm,ILIKERED_1,2,Wed Feb 11 19:12:23 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Also, after all it would only be fitting to read it as a physical copy considering it is called the Malazan book of the Fallen, hehe.  Also it just feels right :)"
Malazan,2vjqlm,bantuftw,1 point,Thu Feb 12 23:14:21 2015 UTC,Thank you much.
Malazan,2vjqlm,DrinkyDrank,1 point,Wed Feb 11 17:18:08 2015 UTC,Where was this when I read the books 4 years ago?! I'm due for a reread.
Malazan,2vjqlm,TPK_MastaTOHO,3,Wed Feb 11 20:53:51 2015 UTC,"I myself started to read the series around October, and now I am at Reapers Gale.(normally I am quite a binge-reader but I had school etc interfering, so I am not that fast now) Gardens of the Moon is probably the least favourite book of mine in the series, it is quite a difficult read in the first 30-40%, but when the stuff in Darujhistan starts(second book in GotM) I started to really like it.  One big advice : dont use the wiki. I got some major shit spoiled in there."
Malazan,2vjqlm,Gaebryal,2,Wed Feb 11 17:18:24 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, refer back to the Dramatis Personae when you get confused about characters, but honestly the immediate plot involving the characters should be relatively easy to grasp.  What you will probably find more difficult is keeping straight all of the locations, factions, races, cults and religions, etc.  My advice is to just keep pushing forward, even when you're confused.  Most things will become clear in time, other things never become clear, but that's what makes this series such an immersive experience."
Malazan,2vjqlm,Circle-Breaker,1 point,Wed Feb 11 17:32:07 2015 UTC,in the front (maybe back) of Gardens of the Moon there's a guide to all the major characters with brief descriptions of who they are and its's also sorted by factions
Malazan,2vjqlm,Tumblehawk,1 point,Wed Feb 11 16:28:16 2015 UTC,"i dont know why it wasnt clear to me, but my biggest confusion in GoTM was moons spawn.   Moons spawn is a flying fortress that looks like someone carved a chunk out of a mountain. at the beginning of the books it is flying over the city of ""Pale"".  Rake is leader of the people that live inside, and is thus, the lord of moon's spawn."
Malazan,2vi7l8,tossingthisaccount,5,Wed Feb 11 05:05:53 2015 UTC,"Nope, there's nothing on what they've done between getting Mathok's troops and when they took over a stronghold in Kolanse. Well there's a slight mention in the first chapter, at the part that probably let you know about the empress when he speaks with Shadowthone. They were just chilling in Aren before he decided to do it, ignoring imperial orders to come back to Quon Tali.  The Laseen thing went down in RotCG though, that's the second ICE book."
Malazan,2vi7l8,MoranthMunitions,1 point,Wed Feb 11 05:37:28 2015 UTC,"Do you recommend I go back and read Esslemont's books before venturing further into CG? I've only read the first chapter.   EDIT: Could I maybe just get by reading their re-reads on TOR, or are they worth the time for an actual full read?"
Malazan,2vi7l8,MoranthMunitions,5,Wed Feb 11 06:26:54 2015 UTC,"Definitely not. The way it continues straight on from DoD it'd just mess you up trying to come back afterwards, and the 3-4 mentions of Laseen in DoD/tCG are about the only real cross over.  The ICE books just clarify some other aspects of the world a bit and expand on others. The events in them have no bearing on the plot in the last two MBotF books other than explaining the odd character's absence. Besides NoK and RotCG his books run either parallel to or after DoD and tCG anyway.  I hope you enjoy the conclusion of the series."
Malazan,2vi7l8,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Wed Feb 11 06:45:40 2015 UTC,"Ok cool, thanks. Pretty glad you said that, this way I can spend the night reading CG instead of waiting."
Malazan,2vi7l8,BlackViperMWG,7,Wed Feb 11 08:07:16 2015 UTC,"Also the other hint at what Paran has been up to was in Toll the Hounds when Picker tries to contact him and he's right in the middle of moving the army through some dangerous territory. That's your hint of what's been going on since The Bonehunters, and you'll learn more as this book progresses."
Malazan,2vg7um,Laticsman29,3,Tue Feb 10 19:48:49 2015 UTC,I'd say you don't need to remember anything as you're starting from the beginning. It will be awesome when you notice small things and your memory gets jogged. I found the reread to be incredible.   If you feel you must remember something I think the default answer of the tor reread is a good place to brush up. Or the Malazan wiki for reread purposes.   Ediy: tor not top
Malazan,2vg7um,Aiolus,1 point,Wed Feb 11 02:39:33 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply I'm really looking forward to seeing what little things I missed the first time round.
Malazan,2vg7um,Landmarkmoon,2,Wed Feb 11 03:17:57 2015 UTC,"Remember who wrote the story, and why. That's all. Oh and Surly isn't that bad."
Malazan,2vg7um,BlackViperMWG,1 point,Wed Feb 11 02:44:01 2015 UTC,Thank you for the reply. Yeah I never thought she was that bad either she was just in a VERY difficult position.
Malazan,2vgg2y,Jtitus187,16,Tue Feb 10 20:47:22 2015 UTC,"Define half way, are you still in Book 2 or have you started Book 3?  IIRC, Book 3 is when the Bonehunters come into play and then it sort of becomes a rehash of book 5, the Letherii vs an invading empire, except this time the empire actually knows what its doing.  It's the only instance where you see exactly why and how the Malazan Empire grew to be as big, strong, and powerful as it is. You see the marines doing what they do best, invading an opposing force. They react to change brilliantly, and there's no way to not love marine banter.  The other plot threads might be somewhat dull, and I do think that that's intentional, but play close attention regardless. Tehol's a class act, follow along with his antics and his moves, and see what ultimately happens. Both Karsa and Icarium have landed on Lether, tasked to kill a king to can't die. Think of the implications of this. Icarium can get so angry that Rhulad can't die that he goes into a fit of rage. Karsa is the Crippled God's knight, Rhulad his king. No way the god wants these two to clash, so what can be done?  The Errant is also playing behind the scenes, trying to use his priestess to gain more power and achieve his desires. But she herself doesn't want to be controlled and will fight for his power. With him being the aspect of pushing and pulling, how will this affect the other conflicts growing in Letheras? Quick Ben, Trull, and Mallet are exploring a lost realm, what sort of secrets will they uncover? And what about Trull's quest to save the Edur? Or most specifically, his brothers? Speaking of which, Fear is travelling with a pretty motley crew. He wants to resurrect father shadow, while his ""ally"" wants revenge for his betrayal. How will this factor into the overall scheme of things?   Characters such as Trull, Beak, Fear, Karsa, Rhulad, and so much more all have terrific development over the course of this book, so pay attention to them. Hopefully, they'll deliver in the best of ways. But most importantly, remember the following, Reaper's Gale is setting up for the climax of the tale. It's directly followed (plot wise) by Dust of Dreams and The Crippled God (both are which are arguably one big book) and you're currently watching Erikson set the stage.   Characters will triumph, others will fall, alliances will be forged and pieces will be set; in an explosive way. So, keep reading despite everything."
Malazan,2vgg2y,Therrester,3,Tue Feb 10 21:15:00 2015 UTC,"Damn...now you made ME want to go reread RG. Good sum up!   OP, listen to this guy. Power through and your in for a great convergence and Malazan badassery"
Malazan,2vgg2y,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Wed Feb 11 01:58:32 2015 UTC,Karsa belongs to no god he's had enough of chains
Malazan,2vgg2y,Fnarley,3,Fri Feb 13 13:10:44 2015 UTC,"I dunno. I'm on DoD now and RG was hands down my favorite book, right after MT. It was the fastest one I've read as well, took me less than a month (I'm a slow reader and usually MBotF books took me anywhere from one to three months each). TtH was the slowest one so far, though the last 1/4 was a breeze. Then again, some people swear by it and say it's their favorite book of the series."
Malazan,2vgg2y,abir_valg2718,5,Tue Feb 10 21:55:47 2015 UTC,"We are in possession of what seems to be an uncommon opinion.  I'm also on DoD, RG was my favourite and TtH was definitely the slowest. The last bit of TtH was great, but it didn't make up for the previous hundreds of pages of abstract philosophical musings and analysis of the world from the point of view of an ox."
Malazan,2vgg2y,TheBionicBosom,1 point,Wed Feb 11 05:16:22 2015 UTC,I dunno the only part of TtH I struggled to read was the convergence and that's because my eyes were filled with tears for about 200 pages
Malazan,2vgg2y,Fnarley,2,Fri Feb 13 13:21:50 2015 UTC,"I think my favorite has to be Bonehunters, but I agree on TtH. It felt unnecessarily meandering and slow. The POV of an ox is a cool novelty though, and the final quarter was insane. It was almost as if Erikson realized nothing had happened all book and wanted to make up for it."
Malazan,2vgg2y,Sopp90,3,Wed Feb 11 05:40:39 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I'm of two minds about this.  First of all, I find that Erikson's books become more and more drawn out as they progress.  The earlier books tended to have spectacular early sections which really grabbed the reader (e.g. MOI's Capustan, HOC's book 1 with Karsa, MT's introduction to the Edur), along with the concluding sections we have come to expect.  Some of the later books, especially RG and TTH, are about 3/4 buildup, with sometimes hundreds of pages before revisiting certain characters (e.g. Karsa in TTH).  In the case of RG, I loved the book despite all the buildup because of my affinity for MT (the best book in the series so far, I'm reading DOD and I don't expect it or TCG to surpass what I enjoyed about it).  The concluding third or so of the book is wonderful and I know you'll enjoy it (especially Tehol and Bugg's plotline).  I fear though, that if you're bogged down reading RG, that TTH might set you back even further.  That book is ponderous to say the least, and it is easily my least favourite in the series despite its absolutely awesome ending.  In any case, I would advise you to remember that ALL the books in this series are first rate, and that even though you might feel bogged down there is much to ultimately enjoy in each one (this is also true of ICE).  Take a break, read something else, come back to it, because for me its so far past being the best fantasy series that hardly anything compares."
Malazan,2vgg2y,pfk505,3,Wed Feb 11 04:23:31 2015 UTC,Take a break. I had to stop at midnight tides then again at DoD.

Malazan,2vgg2y,jjbutts,2,Tue Feb 10 21:07:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about RG as a whole, BUT the last 300 pages are absolutely insane.  And then TtH is good all the way through."

Malazan,2vgg2y,Jester814,2,Wed Feb 11 02:15:16 2015 UTC,Let me put it this way:  This was the first book I've ever stayed up late to finish (about 2 AM).

Malazan,2vffp8,Priest_of_Aroo,5,Tue Feb 10 16:16:24 2015 UTC,I assumed that access to magic through blood was the only possibility. The jaghut don't seem to have their magic yet and Omtose Phellack isn't frozen over yet. The Dog Runners don't get magic until the do the ritual. There's no mention if the Forkulan voice.   I didn't get the impression that the holds were even that.. Organized yet. The only people that preform magic are the Azathani with their blood magic. I would theorise that Draconus gifting night magic to Mother Dark as the start of the holds being open to everyone.
Malazan,2vffp8,Ezzelino,2,Tue Feb 10 18:20:48 2015 UTC,"I feel some magic had to exist for the Jaghut. Korya was described by Haut as a mhybe, and she seems to be getting trained in the soul shifting magic with the dolls.  And it also seems blood magic is stronger, but not necessary. Malice comes back to life, Draconus can essentially teleport places, Burn is sleeping, and T'riss is able to make clothes from the grass.  K'rull has also already started his gift giving.  The dragons have started to invade Kurald Galain, and that one Tiste said he can use the healing magic (Denul). The use of Denul is also a shock to everyone because it was a Tiste doing it, not an Azathani.  My take away, the holds exist already and Forge of Darkness is taking place right as the Warrens are starting to become real."
Malazan,2vffp8,sonofa2,2,Tue Feb 10 18:39:01 2015 UTC,"The Azathani are able to use magic, undoubtably. I got the impression that malice, envy and spites ability to return to life is unique to them.   I don't doubt that holds are around at this point but can everyone use them? Soul shifting is Omtose Phellack. Burn is an interesting point.   I think that Starvald Delmain being open and Kurald Galain being kicked into resistance marks the start of the separation of the dimensions, since currently everyone seems exist on the same plane.   Man im keen for fall of light."
Malazan,2vffp8,Ezzelino,1 point,Tue Feb 10 21:24:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think we have enough yet to say regarding all parties not being able to use magic and if the Holds exist for the Dog Runners and Jheck to use, since we've only gotten the Tiste POV, Haut's POV, and a couple Azathanis' POV.  We know the Tiste can't use magic, since using Denul was such a shock, and the split with Andi and Liosan is just happening now.    Haut saying Korya was a mhybe strikes me as it being a well known thing, and mhybe's are meant to be empty vessals for souls.  Olar Ethil seemingly is able to come back to life since she was supposedly burned to death in that tree and, yet she's alive in the main series.    And we can't forget Hood.  He's not going after Errastas, he's going after death now, and in Fall of Light we'll be seeing his war on death with an army of Toblaki, Dog Runners, Jheck, a blue skinned army, and Jaghut. That's gotta be magic right?"
Malazan,2vffp8,sonofa2,1 point,Tue Feb 10 22:00:49 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think whatever K'rul did made it accessible to everyone, but I don't think that anyone had knowledge of that. But the dogrunners had some form of magic as evidenced by Burn, but I don't know what that means."
Malazan,2vffp8,twistacles,1 point,Tue Feb 10 18:38:21 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that magic was ""cyclical"" and so it could be easier/harder to make use of it, and Darconus's gift was ""tethering"" the magic by making it a hold. It being a hold meant it was closer and easier to use.   I could be off, though."
Malazan,2vg73y,increasingly_purple,8,Tue Feb 10 19:43:08 2015 UTC,"Ok here's what happened. First the bottle was from Baruk, not Quick Ben. The bottle traps the users spirit when he dies. It was meant to save Coltaine, but Coltaine gave it to Duiker because he thought Duiker deserved it more (plus Wickans already have a leg up on the whole ressurection business.)  In the very end of the last chapter you see two of Baruk's minions coming to pick up Duiker's corpse, they never mention him by name because they don't know his name. It's just their job to pick up the corpse and the bottle so Baruk can put the two back together. MoI"

Assuming we're talking about the same thing (and apologies if we're not...) it was supposed to be given to Coltaine, but he refused it, so Duiker kept it.  When it broke (there was fluid or something inside, right?), it did... something, to Duiker that returned him back to life after he was crucified.  Duiker should be dead, but the bauble prevented that.  And it was really meant for Coltaine.    Sorry, some of the details are a bit sketchy, been a while since I read DG."

Hounds as Knights.  Iskarul Pust and Apsilar as bishops Kalam and Daseem Ultor as rooks Pawns could be shadows/assassins
Malazan,2vf6v5,Circle-Breaker,5,Thu Feb 19 23:44:14 2015 UTC,"There are so many group and sub-groups of characters it depends how you want to set up teams: Malazan Old guard vs new; Malazan vs Crimson Guard; Lether vs Tiste; Lether vs Bonehunters; Acsendants vs Gods; Bridgeburners vs Bonehunters.   Malazans: King - Kellandved Queen - Surly Bishops - Quick Ben, Tayschren, Ganoes? Knights - Kallam, Dancer Rooks - Dassem, Toc? Greymane? Tavore?  Lether could be easier:  RG    Others King - Anomander Rake Queen - CG Knights - Karsa, CG Bishops - Samar Dev, Mappo Rooks - Hood, Icarium"
Malazan,2vf6v5,uncreative_canadian,2,Tue Feb 10 15:53:23 2015 UTC,"In your Malazan set, where's Whiskeyjack? Also, assassins as knights doesn't seem to be the right choice in my mind. Assassination is a devious tactic, so perhaps the bishops that are going more sideways would be better suited. Then again, it is difficult to be more devious than Quick Ben."
Malazan,2vf6v5,gbardelli,3,Tue Feb 10 23:29:53 2015 UTC,"The knights are the assassins of chess, I quite liked the list."
Malazan,2vf6v5,BioChemistryStudent,2,Wed Feb 11 04:52:13 2015 UTC,"True. So many malazans to pick from. I picked bishops as mages because of the priest connection. Wasn't sure how to pick knights or rooks. Going with knights as proficient fighters and rooks as great leaders. Perhaps a revised list:  Malazans (Old Guard) King: Kellanved Queen: Surly Bishops: Tayschren, Tattersail  (Duiker perhaps) Knights: Dancer, Dassem  (could also include Temper) Rooks: Amaron, Dujek, (or Toc and Nok)  Malazan (New Guard) King: Mallick Rel Queen: Laseen (shh) Bishops: Quick Ben, Ganoes Knights: Kallam, Lostara Yil Rooks: WhiskeyJack, Tavore  And this doesn't even include Bridgeburners or Bonehunters like Fidd, Hedge, and al; who I guess could be pawns at least."
Malazan,2vf6v5,uncreative_canadian,3,Wed Feb 11 00:21:41 2015 UTC,Bonehunters:  King: Tavore  Queen: Quick Ben  Bishop: Ruthan Gudd and Lostara Yil  Knights: Fiddler and Pores  Rooks: Gesler and Stormy  Pawns: Marines
Malazan,2vf6v5,lykideus,3,Tue Feb 10 21:18:26 2015 UTC,"I think The Crippled God would be a rather fitting king. Perhaps more so than any other power player in the series, he relies on others to achieve his goals. Alone, he can't do much of anything."
Malazan,2vcbh1,scrndude,14,Mon Feb 9 21:14:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would not read it before finishing the main series. I know that it takes place before everything but It reveals so many things that are mysteries in the main series that it will really spoil the fun."
Malazan,2vcbh1,gathmoon,3,Mon Feb 9 22:04:10 2015 UTC,"I doesnt spoil what happens but it gives you the backstory for some of the larger than life characters you are currently reading about. - It explains who they were in their youth, and some of the reasons for how they became as they are in the malazan timeframe.   I think one of the things that captured me in reading the series was the enigmas and the mysteries surrounding alot of the characters and the complexities of the world. I think a little of that would be lost if reading the Kharkanas trilogy before finishing the books of the fallen. However another argument could be made, that it only helps bring depth to some of the narrative you are currently involved with, in that it deals with the Tiste as a people and explains how they fractured and came to be so tragic as they appear in the book of the fallen. It also goes into more detail with regards to the relationships between some of the pivotal characters you already know, and explains more indepth about the ""gods"".  I started reading the malazan books a long time before Forge was written, so I never had your dilemma, but I actually think it would have enhanced the experience had I been able to read the kharkanas books first. But remember you only have the first of the trilogy so far, so you'd probably just be totally hooked on a series that isnt finished yet. :)  Ps. Have you considered reading/listening to Esslemonts books? They all take place in the same world, and shares characters with The book of the Fallen. There are 6 or 7 books I believe. The first is called Night of Knives."
Malazan,2vcbh1,Silmariel,3,Mon Feb 9 22:06:03 2015 UTC,Esselmont books are a great way to wait out the last two audio books.

Malazan,2vcbh1,Lankles,1 point,Tue Feb 10 01:08:36 2015 UTC,Reading FoH might actually give you a lot of insight into TTH -- specifically the characters in Black Coral.   But I'm not sure overall whether it would be a good idea to read it beforehand. It would def make you look at them differently than you would otherwise.
Malazan,2vcbh1,Poser1313,1 point,Tue Feb 10 02:58:27 2015 UTC,"As someone who finished it while waiting for another book to arrive (I think it was Reapers Gale), I would suggest to read it after the series. It ruins some reveals later on, not big spoiler stuff, they just lose effect.   Also, a lot of the characters from FoD are in the main series, and it's much more interesting to see the old dogs of the series in their younger days than be introduced to them in a separate book."

Malazan,2v1mnh,Kangthereddit,13,Sat Feb 7 00:47:10 2015 UTC,"The certainty came from predicting the endgame Shadowthrone/Cotillon, Anomander, the Crippled God and the Forkrul Assail put together.   She knew what everyone was driving at (seizing Kaminsod's heart) and went there to tip the balance to the side she deemed better. She did so well by her soldiers and followers that they went with her - despite an awful trek across the desert and huge amounts of doubt - and fought for her without a clear reason beyond ""It is the right thing to do"".   The logic of this is helped somewhat by Tavore being revealed to be a Talon and in her brother's tales of her defeating military geniuses time and time again in face to face simulations.   Also, the desert crossing is boosted by the meeting of the Snake and the sacrifice of the Khundryl. That broke me down to tears."
Malazan,2v1mnh,Udinaas,4,Sat Feb 7 01:12:40 2015 UTC,If you reread the series the hints are there and Tavore actually pretty well fleshed out. Problem is you won't get this hints until you have read the series.

He was a very educated man, before the Claw arose, he had his own assassin faction called the Talon.  When she wears the mark of the Talon and says she's the emperor's child it means, as was written in previous books, she's well educated on matters of tactics, on a similar level as Shadowthrone and in my honest opinion was doing his bidding from the start. I feel that's why she never said anything to her troops, because she knew the outcome, what will happen to all of them and lastly, she was willing to sacrifice all of them for the end result and take all the punishment and blame from her troops unto herself.  After all, Cotillion finished off the whole matter at the end. Shadowthrone and Tavore were the masterminds."

Malazan,2uzk27,seamus_quigley,7,Fri Feb 6 16:46:27 2015 UTC,"I did it once. Read somewhere that one was in the works using TriStat, so decided to give it a go myself. TriStat is not a robust system. At all.  Anyway, some thoughts of mine.  Avoid character classes. One of the main points of the Malazan books is to subvert fantasy tropes. All classes do is reinforce them. Let your players put their points wherever they want. Over generalisation will hurt them in the end.  Avoid defined spells. The Great sorcerers in the Malazan books are noted for how clever they are with the Warrens they have access to. Have you characters buy access to a Warren, and then increase their skill in that Warren. Make it easy for the GM to assign a difficulty to Warren use by scaling size, duration, number of targets, complexity etc. Each bump up the difficulty track in a category adds an extra difficulty to the roll. Let the players try any spell they wish as long as they can use the Warren. It'll be their problem if it fails.  Keep an eye on scalability. This is your biggest hurdle. The range of abilities in the world of Malaz is huge. From incompetent mortal to elder God. With ascendance being such a strong theme in the books it needs to be possible for your players to rise all the way.  Make absolute mastery of fighting techniques as effective as powerful sorcery. Time and again we see individuals whose total competence in their martial ability leads them down the route of ascendancy. Almost as though the universe itself respects what they are capable of."

Malazan,2uzk27,number7,1 point,Fri Feb 6 17:23:18 2015 UTC,"I was thinking maybe you could treat warrens as similar to sorcerer bloodlines.  Wizard class would be out as I can't think of anyone in the Malaz world who needs to prep spells beforehand.  I would think your spell list would be pretty heavily truncated, spells seem to be 'blunt' for lack of a better word.  Offensive spells just sort of smack into opponents, defensive just keep offensive spells from smacking into people, and there only seems to be a few creative uses of magic (like mockra).  If you were going for house designations I would think that's pretty similar to clerics.  Or that could be something more assigned to characters as a bonus perk."
Malazan,2uzk27,GameOfShadowthrones,1 point,Fri Feb 6 23:33:11 2015 UTC,"I would say that combat magic is ""smack into things"" but the sequences with Ben with serc shows very creative use of magic for flight, mind manipulation, passing through walls."

Malazan,2uzk27,ElmoTheNefarious,1 point,Sun Feb 15 19:37:12 2015 UTC,"I am actually running a homebrew campaign right now that is a lot like Malazan. I was inspired to create the world we are playing in after reading Malazan, and I am trying to create a very Malazan - like vibe.   I have put in quite a bit of thought into the magic system I am using (all the characters are mages and are on the path to ascendency) and think that something ""fluid"" like what I have created would fit the Warrens pretty well.   You can read about my magic system here, if you are interested: http://redd.it/31s7jj"
Malazan,2uzk27,ElmoTheNefarious,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:16:33 2015 UTC,"Since there are no actual prebaked spells in the books magic is kinda tough. Maybe assign warrens on character creation, racially based, with human characters getting to pick multiple warrens but they have to pick from the non-Elder warrens. Each warren has an aspect, so only a character who can access Serc can do levitation spells for example. Make the player describe what they want to do and just improvise based on how hard you think that action should be. That seems to be how magic works in the books anyways."
Malazan,2uzk27,Nichase,2,Fri Feb 6 17:04:30 2015 UTC,"That was going to be my plan, make them roll for magical strength at the beginning and then use that as a base stat (obviously not all mages are equal in strength) . Later rolls would be based off how hard I thought the spell they where trying to pull off where.   I think limiting to one warren plus mokra would be better since although latent mokra is in nearly everyone warrens tend to be mutually exclusive apart from special cases.   Perhaps using the Warhammer fantasy / fate system of rolls to determine success / failure (easy to apply to lots of situations) Roll against other for vs-NPC magic duels.  I like the idea of leaving magic up to creativity rather than a random feat.   I will poke around for combat mechanics, not so hard. If I manage to get a workable system I will run it and post the results on here."

Malazan,2uw5va,frankhorse,2,Fri Feb 6 03:24:37 2015 UTC,It's how I've been listening. On Bonehunters right now. Ralph Lister does the first three and is amazing. His Kruppe is awesome. Michael Page takes over after. He did Gentleman Bastards and I loved him in that but not so much for Malazan. Too many characters and his range isn't as good as Lister but he isn't bad once you get used to him. Some of his characters are definitely better than others.

Midnight Tides is a lot different than the other books, but it gave a lot of insight into Trull's character, and also explains some Edur related stuff happening in the world of Malazan.

However, the common opinion (from what I've seen) is that MT is one of the best books in the series. Personally, it's my second favorite of all ten, second to Toll the Hounds.   So, I'd say go into Midnight Tides expecting something a bit different while keeping in mind that overall, it will deliver greatly."
Malazan,2uvwld,Therrester,6,Thu Feb 5 18:45:01 2015 UTC,"Cool, thank you. I was a bit disheartened to see all new characters and location and just needed a bit of reassurance from Malazan fans to keep motoring."

Malazan,2uvwld,Mabus5,4,Thu Feb 5 19:14:26 2015 UTC,"If you need reassurance, here's a couple of things you'll discover in MT:   Tehol and Bugg: easily the best duo in the entire series. These two will make you laugh with their entics, misleading conversations, and interactions with others.  Trull, Fear, and Rhulad: three of the four Sengar brothers. Easily some of my favorite characters in the book. I love the dynamic these three have as the story progresses, how they struggle with the changes, and try to keep a semblance of a family.  The climax: Oh god, the climax. Midnight Tides explodes in the last two chapters. It contains two of the best scenes of the series (in my opinion), and the overall climax is so good you'll devour it before you know it."

Malazan,2uvwld,Tumblehawk,2,Thu Feb 5 17:17:49 2015 UTC,I kinda think Wu is a warren. It's hinted at in MoI when the maybe dreams up her own warren. someone says 'I wonder how many old women there are dreaming up their own worlds'. Time is also measured on Burn's sleep.

Malazan,2ur665,MoranthMunitions,4,Wed Feb 4 14:06:09 2015 UTC,"As it's fairly obscure, if anyone's interested in reading the small exchange about the coins which I mentioned, I swear it doesn't spoil anything but I'll mark it in case:  GoG            I just thought it was strange that there's a small amount of detail here, but nothing matching it anywhere in 17 books and 5 other novellas."
Malazan,2ur665,strawberrysundaeandt,4,Wed Feb 4 14:11:26 2015 UTC,Good catch. I did wonder about the coins in MT. The lack of description of coinage is a gap because it's a good way to telegraph how isolated a culture is if they only have older coins or if a treasure horde has been hidden for centuries.
Malazan,2ur665,TriscuitCracker,3,Wed Feb 4 14:58:32 2015 UTC,"That is interesting given Eriksen's archeological background and attention to detail. But maybe it's just something he didn't feel like bothering with or maybe it simply never occurred to him to describe them beyond ""coin"". There are sooo many nations and races, there's bound to be a zillion kinds of coins too."
Malazan,2ur665,PromisedPrince694,2,Wed Feb 4 17:52:34 2015 UTC,"Excellent catch! I thought that there were coins mentioned in House of Chains that were rectangular in shape but that was so long ago that I can barely remember. As for the faces on the coins, it's never mentioned."
Malazan,2ur665,PromisedPrince694,1 point,Fri Feb 6 23:33:03 2015 UTC,"So you got me thinking and I searched through the ebooks (including ICE and novellas) for ""rectang"" - to catch rectangle and rectangular - and though it wasn't in HoC there was actually a mention in RG, chapter 10. There's a chance that they're not using malazan jakatas anyway, much as I suspect that they are, because RG. Slightly regretting making this thread no spoilers instead of spoilers all.  I reckon that they've thought it through and know but never thought to mention it in the books, otherwise there's no reason to have references there and in GoG to rectangular coins. Anyway, thanks, the plot thickens!"
Malazan,2uq3xs,lykideus,5,Wed Feb 4 05:10:50 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that Jaghut have more joints than normal. It might just be a slip-up by Steven. Or it might hint about some other stuff that might have to do Kilmandaros or Knuckles and some Jaghut, I have yet to finish TCG so I don't know what happens!  Interesting find, though!"
Malazan,2uq3xs,Randomonous,2,Wed Feb 4 06:17:43 2015 UTC,"Good pickup, I never noticed that before. Icy clutch.. the only detail there that points to Jaghut, but List's ghost is definitively Jaghut. Which is more apparent in every following encounter.  TtH, Ch. 8  That gives a second mention on Jaghut having long fingers at least. However I can't find anything else on them being oddly jointed, and I feel like if it were an important detail he would mentioned it in this passage because it's the perfect opportunity:  RG, Ch. 14  There was also a bit of talk about Gethol's hands, just briefly, in MoI, so I figure if they were specially jointed it might have been mentioned there too. So either it's a detail that was never mentioned again, maybe a slip up, possibly something silently retconned, it could be a metaphor, or a result of whatever happened to the Jaghut to make it a ghost. The Imass did like to put them under big rocks, or to crush every bone in their body - potentially making some new bones. I have my suspicions about who the Jaghut is though, so I doubt that last one's the case.  Edit: And after using ctrl-f for hand all the way through FoD, none of the Jaghut hands are mentioned to be anything but long fingered, gauntleted or ink stained."
Malazan,2uq3xs,MoranthMunitions,2,Wed Feb 4 06:31:16 2015 UTC,"I remember this section from my first read-through.  As a result, I always assumed Jaghut simply had long fingers with extra joints (not extra joints everywhere like the Assail, just on their fingers)."
Malazan,2uq3xs,AllWrong74,2,Wed Feb 4 10:00:25 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really make sense though. Like, the Assail having extra joints and they're more double jointed, so they're a lot more flexible, which seems reasonable, lets them hit things other ways, makes them more agile. Extra finger joints though, that implies more than one extra joint per finger and I can't see what the use of even one lot more is, all it would do is let you curl your fingers about themselves. Unless they're for lateral or reverse movement, but I think either of those would rate another mention at some point. Add to that Duiker's assertion about the hand itself having many joints and it just seems weird to me. I feel like they'd have to be for something, and if that something's not mentioned there's no point them having it, if you know what I mean.  Anyway, did a search through all of the ebooks for ""joint"", besides a lot of swelling, aching and a bit of cutting there was only: lots of Forkrul Assail, Kilmandaros, Sechul Lath, the Aptorian Demon, Vorcan Radok, a deformed creature/automaton from BaB called Veng and the case this thread is about. Interestingly Erikson uses joint (and disjointed/other similar things) a lot more than ICE, except in FoD where the word is only used once. Which is considerably less.  I reckon it was just something he decided to change, it was mentioned twice in one page so you'd imagine if it were a mistake he'd have noticed and there's too many random descriptions/opportunities to not mention it again later. Hopefully Tor will go through the rest of the ICE books too for their reread and someone can ask Esslemont or it is mentioned in a passing remark again in FoL. I'd love to know a good reason why someone could use, let alone need, more joints in their hand. And it's times like this that I realise I put altogether too much thought into some stuff in this series."
Malazan,2uq3xs,MoranthMunitions,2,Wed Feb 4 12:19:26 2015 UTC,"""Extra finger joints"" would only imply more than 1 extra per finger if you were describing one finger.  If you're describing a hand (which he is in this case) and you say ""Extra finger joints"" or even ""Extra joints on the fingers"" you aren't necessarily saying more than 1 per finger.  I was just pointing out with my post that he doesn't contradict that description as far as I can recall."
Malazan,2uq3xs,AllWrong74,2,Wed Feb 4 14:11:18 2015 UTC,"Good point, I was getting my plurals mixed up a bit there, though though the bit with Duiker states ""many-jointed hand"", which to me means more than just the fingers. I feel like most of the features of a race get mentioned fairly often by the end of a series though. It reminds me a bunch of how HoC, though that one is reinforced a lot.  I only checked every instance of hand in two books because it took forever, but I agree I don't recall it ever being touched on elsewhere. It just seems weird/unnecessary, especially when it's practically a defining trait of another species. I suppose the Assail and Jaghut must get some pretty cool secret handshakes happening."
Malazan,2uq3xs,MoranthMunitions,2,Wed Feb 4 14:20:29 2015 UTC,"I actually wondered if the Assail and Jaghut were related at this point of DG, because of that."

I only just finished Gardens of the Moon yesterday and explained in the topic I posted how difficult it was for me to get into in the beginning, but as soon as I hit Book Two, well, I knew I was in for a ride.  That assassin fight on the rooftops of Darujhistan at the very beginning was immense. I'll be honest, I've never read anything like that before. I had my own preconceptions of the whole assassins fighting on rooftops thing, and I just thought it was tacky. I always have. It's always seemed too 'anime' for me. And not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just never been my style.  But this, this was different. It actually blew my mind. It was at this point I realised just how many different characters, allegiances, wants and desires would be in the book. I loved how grey the world was. And that rooftop battle just paved the way for me, and, after that, I found the book a dream, with the struggle of getting past the beginning suddenly becoming worth it.

Malazan,2un2tp,Eltotsira,14,Tue Feb 3 14:59:33 2015 UTC,"1) Thel Akai are the original Elder Race of giants, the others (Thelomen Toblakai, Tartheno Toblakai) are descended from them. The Teblor and Tarthenal are similar again, effectively they're culturally lost in comparison and are more diluted, with some of the tribes were more weakened with human blood than the others. Like how Karsa's was purer and I think the Sunni were closer to humans and weaker, while in Lether how only a few Tarthenal had the whole 4 lungs etc. (the Fenn likely fit into this category because of their interactions with humans for >2k years, as they kicked the Seti out of their area, however there aren't any in the series so it's not definite).  2) Should be effectively the same, so far as I can tell.  3) Reaper's Gale, Chapter 11   The huge man struggled back to his feet, wiping at the blood on his face. He was not as tall as Karsa, but almost as wide. ‘I am Ublala Pung, of the Tarthenal—’ ‘Tarthenal.’ Samar Dev said, ‘A mixed-blood remnant of some local Toblakai population. Used to be more in the city – I certainly have not seen any others out in the markets and such. But they’ve virtually vanished, just like most of the other tribes the Letherii subjugated.’   4) It's unclear which Elder God ""belonged"" to which race, besides the relationships between Draconus and the Tiste, and Olar Ethil and the Imass. Kilmandaros was kind of worshipped by the Forkrul Assail too, so with Sechul Lath's form it's possible that's what she did. Maybe there'll be more info in the next two books. Hopefully.  5) That's not really clear either, when the Thel Akai started to die out/be replaced by the Toblakai. However Kallor made it his mission to kill the Thel Akai (RotCG), so I'd guess sometime around the advent of the Kallorian Empire.  I'm sure someone else will have more insight into it all though."
Malazan,2un2tp,MoranthMunitions,6,Tue Feb 3 15:29:06 2015 UTC,"A couple of additional details:  2) It is worth noting that the Teblor/Toblakai tribes that Karsa is from seem to be the ""purest"" blooded giants remaining. The Seregahl gods of the Tarthenal on Letherii were their dieties because there were the founders and purest members in that tribes history. But they were described as less pure than Karsa when he showed up.  4) Kilmandaros is usually in a form that sounds a lot like a Forkrul Assail, but massive.  The weird skin tone, extra joints and all that.  However, in one of her earlier appearances in MT or RG or something, she is in the form of a Toblakai or Thel Akai giant of some sort. As far as I can recall, this is the only time that she isn't in her typical monster Forkrul form.  5) The term ""Founding Race"" is a little bit misleading, it refers to a specific situation explained in Assail by ICE, and doesn't necessarily mean that those 4 races were the original or most important races.  There is a scene somewhere later in the series (maybe DoD) where there is mention of the K'chain at the height of their power going to war against the Toblakai and getting decimated. As well as the event that Karsa came across where there was a war between the Imass and Toblakai and the Forkrul Assasil.  The Toblakai are ancient and were a part of all sorts of ""prehistoric"" events before getting nearly wiped out like the 4 ""Founding"" races."
Malazan,2un2tp,gathmoon,2,Tue Feb 3 17:15:04 2015 UTC,"Right, the point you referenced about the Thel Akai decimating the K'Chain Che'Malle is what got me wondering about that specific point. Also, evidence seems to indicate that the Thel Akai were city dwellers, with the toblakai, and each subsequent giant/other race mix becoming more and more tribal?"
Malazan,2un2tp,sonofa2,3,Tue Feb 3 21:44:57 2015 UTC,"Back in the beginning of HoC when Karsa stumbles across the cave with Icarium's name this is hinted at. There is another point where that war is referenced later on, but I don't remember the context. But the upshot is that they struggle was getting out of hand, and Icarium or someone had to step in to prevent total annihilation. If I remember correctly, his intervention was after much of the devastation and was intended to rebuild them as a race (which would kinda make sense because it is likely that Icarium is half Toblakai).  The implicit assumption in this story (and I think it was made explicit somewhere, but I don't remember) is that prior to their decimation they were a highly developed society capable of easily crushing the incredible might of the K'chain Che'malle."
Malazan,2un2tp,verheyen,3,Tue Feb 3 21:53:26 2015 UTC,Very complete answer. Thank you for putting it together.
Malazan,2un2tp,MoranthMunitions,2,Tue Feb 3 16:52:24 2015 UTC,"Real good answer. I will add that FoD, which I assume OP hasn't read yet, kind of touches on the Elder God section more, and explains the favored race for gods."
Malazan,2un2tp,verheyen,2,Tue Feb 3 17:03:28 2015 UTC,"Olar Ethil embraced the ritual of tellan, but I thought she was Elient who veers into an imass and not the other way around?   And Sechul Lath calls Kilmandaros ""Mother"" several times, and coupled with her many jointed but massive body, seems to me she is literally his mother or a ""mother race"" to the assail. Maybe the precursors to assail and the toblakai gave birth to Kilmandaros?"

Malazan,2un56x,Fnarley,7,Fri Feb 13 14:00:23 2015 UTC,"Some deaths hit me harder than others. The further I got in the series, the harder they hit. Didn't really care about Tattersail as her character wasn't developed much. But once I had been following characters for multiple books and spending time in their heads for hours, it was tough seeing them die.   ASOIAF character deaths tended to be more shocking than saddening for me. Of course the Red Wedding was really upsetting but others (Lysa for example) were just WTF moments. GRRM tends to write mostly despicable characters, so seeing them die isn't always a sad moment."
Malazan,2un56x,TurboS40,2,Tue Feb 3 15:37:01 2015 UTC,"I'm on my third re-read and the deaths still make me sad, some even more than on the first read through.  No, I don't think too many died, it seems the right amount to me."
Malazan,2un56x,EvilAndPuissant,2,Tue Feb 3 15:37:50 2015 UTC,"I think that the right number have died, but just one or two too many ""survived"" their death. I'm looking at you Spoilers ASSAILAssail. Actually it's probably only the one that really annoys me, but still. I like how many random characters just die during the series, they might be seen in the background over the course of a book or two, then their death is mentioned in passing during a battle. I like that often it's that one character who once helped push a bogged wagon while complaining about their sergeant rather than ""a soldier over there wearing our colours"" who gets their head cut off.  But just two or three always get me. There's some characters that it's easy to get attached to who're killed."
Malazan,2un56x,MoranthMunitions,2,Tue Feb 3 15:52:24 2015 UTC,fucking shitsticks I didn't realize your comment was an Assail spoiler :/ It's pretty obvious but I wanted that small bit of satisfaction discovering that I was right :p I've been dragging my ass and only started reading it last week

It's kind of a shame how obvious it was imo. I'd say it's one of the better ICE books though, characters are more interesting like in BaB but there's kind of a story to it too."
Malazan,2un56x,MoranthMunitions,1 point,Tue Feb 3 22:52:04 2015 UTC,Oh no it was 100% my fault. I've just gotten extremely used to not checking spoiler tags since I've read every book other than Assail and it's the first Assail spoiler I've ever seen. I'll be done with the book within a week so I'll be back to my negligent spoiler checking then :p  And yes it's extremely good so far.
Malazan,2un56x,Jester814,1 point,Wed Feb 4 13:03:37 2015 UTC,"As much as I liked Dujek, he needed to die so Ganoes could be in charge of the Host. I expected him to die because I saw no other way that could happen.  A lot of characters die because there a lot of characters in the series, you'll have like 20+ new ones added per book so it's natural most will die so you don't go insane trying to remember everyone. Of course, some deaths do hurt more than others."

In Deadhouse Gates it's mostly new characters and an entirely new continent but Memories of Ice takes you back t Genebackis. Both are fantastic. Post your impressions as you go!  What did you think of Dragnipur? Blew my mind the first time I envisioned it.
Malazan,2ul3sf,TriscuitCracker,5,Tue Feb 3 05:38:04 2015 UTC,"I think Dragnipur is one of my favourite, uh, items in anything. Given that it is wielded by one of the most... immense, powerful and, I suppose, coolest characters, you can't help but appreciate how fantastic it is.  I loved Dragnipur from its name alone and from Baruk's fear during that early meeting with Anomander Rake, when Baruk pales at the thought of it being used to take the heads of two mages. That put it into perspective! And then, when he actually wields it and uses it, and you can hear the sound of chains and the moans, well, I don't think I've ever heard of anything quite like it!"

Malazan,2uhhfs,Phhhhuh,2,Mon Feb 2 13:58:31 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it was Draconus. From chapter one of FoD, just a few pages in:   Though no one ever spoke of his mother, Arathan knew that she had named him. His father’s predilections on such matters were far crueller. He told himself that he remembered his half-sisters’ mother, a brooding, heavy woman with a strange face, who had either died or departed shortly after weaning the triplets she had borne, but a later comment from Tutor Sagander suggested that the woman he’d remembered had been a wet-nurse, a witch of the Dog-Runners who dwelt beyond the Solitude. Still, he preferred to think of her as the girls’ mother, too kind-hearted to give them the names they now possessed – names that, to Arathan’s mind, shackled each sister like a curse."
Malazan,2uhhfs,MoranthMunitions,1 point,Mon Feb 2 13:59:45 2015 UTC,Yea I now realize I was misremembering the later conversation Draconus had with Olar Ethil -- coulda sworn he blamed her for the names.

As most of your posts here are pictures it's hard to tell, last I recall/just stalked to be sure you were on HoC, though it's been a while.  And with the Bauchelain one, I never got around to saying, I think the reason why the covers were able to reach that gaunt/menacing thing was because they had Korbal Broach in there too. Did you read any/many of the novellas? They were good, it's kind of interesting how few characters use demons, when you had him labelled as the Summoner I realised only really Kellanved, Tayschrenn and Baruk use them much otherwise.  Anyway, this one conveys a sense of duty really well, which makes him seem like I imagined when he was going fresh into Pale. Very straight laced and by the book, which he's not so much later on. Paran's a great character."

Malazan,2ucl42,strawberrysundaeandt,1 point,Tue Feb 3 14:08:45 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry about the novellas until you're done, they only take a couple of hours each to read, there's no overlap between them and the main series so if you feel like reading them and have them you may as well try one, as you can always leave the others for later. They're good for light reading if you enjoy the style, they're kind of different while being kind of the same.  Otherwise MT is effectively self-contained anyway, and I'd probably rate it in my top 3 books for the series. I'm sure you'll enjoy it when you get the chance."

It was a book called A Game of Thrones, by a chap named George RR Martin. I'd heard great things about his work and wanted to check it out.  The other was a book I'd never heard of before, I simply noted it on the shelves and grabbed it on impulse. That was Gardens of the Moon. I read the opening pages during a break I had since I didn't have time to get properly stuck into A Game of Thrones, my main aquisition. Those pages grabbed me enough that I set aside the other book and finished Gardens of the Moon first. So I'd say I was hooked right from the beginning."

This is how I see it.  1) It takes the most powerful people out of the city, leaving Malazans as the most powerful.  2) In culling the nobility, the Malazans look like saviors instead of invaders. They can say ""We took out the people who were repressing you."" This gains support from the commoners.   Later in the series, different people from conquered lands talk about how the Malazans brought order to their homelands."
Malazan,2u97fj,leogodin217,9,Sat Jan 31 00:39:30 2015 UTC,"They also cull their own nobility again to make to commoners happy, i think it might also be to keep the rest of the nobles in check and maybe to ensure possible usurpers are either flat out killed, or dissuaded from ever even trying. Aside from military leaders and possibly high mages, the nobles are the most powerful, influential people in the empire.  Not sure if I'm right here, but that's how I've always seen it."
Malazan,2u97fj,peopIe_mover,1 point,Sat Jan 31 01:57:29 2015 UTC,I always viewed it as more of the latter (keeping them in check).

Malazan,2u97fj,peopIe_mover,5,Sat Jan 31 01:57:51 2015 UTC,"Great point. Almost forgot about that.   I love how the books explore this topic. Malazans are much like the Romans. They were brutal, but that brutality brought order."
Malazan,2u97fj,leogodin217,9,Sat Jan 31 16:46:21 2015 UTC,"You may have read the books where the baby of royal lineage escapes and later reclaims the throne.   In Malazan they cull the nobility in conquered lands to stop them being reclaimed and to show/tell the peasants/people all will be better now. It is also a powerful spectacle to see the most powerful person you've ever seen be butchered. It can quell resistance and demonstrates power.   They cull the nobility in their own Kingdom for control. It keeps the powerful somewhat cowed. It offers a scapegoat to show the populace. I believe it was also explained that it helped reform the military from mostly purchased commissions for nobility into skill/merit based promotions.   Not all reasons apply equally in each case.   Edit, clarity"
Malazan,2u97fj,Aiolus,3,Sat Jan 31 06:32:29 2015 UTC,"I think the idea is based on what happened in the French revolution where the nobility lost their special rights. The nobility represents oppression and by culling them, the Malazans basically win over the peasantry in one quick move."
Malazan,2u97fj,Montaron87,2,Sat Jan 31 11:20:00 2015 UTC,"This has pretty much been answered, but I need to ask again just for my own confirmation: there's a scene between Dujek and Lorn in which he tells her that Tayschrenn wants to cull all of the nobility (of a certain city), to which even she replies is a bit excessive.  So my question is this: they cull the nobility to ensure their political power in conquered areas and to also garner some level of support from the commoners. If that's the case, why don't they cull all of the nobility? Why does Lorn think that's excessive?"
Malazan,2u97fj,Tygett,3,Sat Jan 31 09:47:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so Tayschrenn wants to cull 9/10 of the nobility of Pale in GotM. The reasons I can think of why that, or completely killing the nobility, would be bad are:   Tyranny - it's not the best position to be in, where you're seen to publicly kill the entirety of a class of a city. It shows that you're both capable of it and happy to do it and may intimidate others to the point of rebellion. You want to maintain stability in the area and without leaving a large occupation force if you can avoid it. Leadership - besides merchants the nobility (who often own a lot of businesses anyway) are the people who employ people in the city, they are the ones who have lead the city's population and can continue to exert an influence on it. If you've culled the nobility you can more easily pressure the remaining members - there's less of them and they're more scared of you - so you can leverage them to get what you want. Let them know that the claw are always watching. By keeping the current structure then altering it they can probably maintain better civic order than trying to change it all straight away. Tying into both - they targeted the greediest and least liked, which means that there's less ambition left behind, so less of a risk, and that the people, including other nobles, are more likely to be happy with the executions. If they're slaughtering most of them it's probably indiscriminate, they'll get the good and the bad.   Something mentioned in the book that's not in this thread is that they (apparently) get more recruits after their public executions, which helps to dilute the population into their military machine. I'm pretty sure I didn't expand on my points too well, but at least that's two basic reasons why you wouldn't want to kill them all."
Malazan,2u97fj,MoranthMunitions,2,Sat Jan 31 13:47:47 2015 UTC,"That explained everything really well. Thanks! I thought as much; I remember the bit about the surge of recruits after the executions, I just forgot.  But there is another question in relation to all of this. Paran himself is the son of a noble, and I can't quite grasp why he has been allowed to join up, and even more peculiar is that he has been given a rather prestigious rank working beside the Adjunct, the Empress' second.  It's just strange. But mind you, I am only on Gardens of the Moon so things might happen later in the series that explains these things a little more."
Malazan,2u6z1t,Bunnylove_,31,Fri Jan 30 13:05:22 2015 UTC,"Dassem is the first sword of the empire. Not just an exceptional swordsman, but un-arguably the best human swordsman alive. He wields a sword that will not break if he doesn't.  He was the knight(?) of death, literally Hood's agent on Wu. And given that he's an exceptional swordsman and overall commander of the Malazan armed forces, he's responsible for sending lots of souls to hoods realm, generating immense influence for Hood.  Oh and he hung out in the deadhouse; and likely inherited some of the legendary traits of the Old Guard.  But then hood killed his daughter and betrayed him. The empire betrayed him and sent assassins to kill him. He was betrayed by all that mattered to him, earning the mantle of lord of tragedy.   While he doesn't wield magic like a wizard, he's experiences have forged him into something more then just a human swordsman. Dassem is a great example of how experience and capability can lead to ascendancy. But Dassem is not just an ascendant, he's a minor God; because he has worshipers.   Oh and he killed some guy named Anomander Rake.   So when the former pre-eminent servant of death, who just happens to be the worlds best swordsman and military leader, who also happens to be a god, comes after you, you get the fuck out the way."
Malazan,2u6z1t,drae-,9,Fri Jan 30 13:51:33 2015 UTC,I agree with everything except when you said he's un-arguably the best swordsman alive. You can't tell me when I can't argue! You're not my dad!!  clears throat  Rake let him win so we don't know who would come out on top. Kallor didn't take him seriously so wasn't prepared. We also don't know his skill relative to others in the series. Like Icarium or Silchy. I also think Yedan could give the guy a run for his money since he chops up Hounds like they're nothing.
Malazan,2u6z1t,SerBronnofBlackwater,2,Fri Jan 30 15:43:35 2015 UTC,"1>7. And it could be argued that rake did not let him win. Let's just say the circumstances would likely dictate who would win.  Yedan had a hust sword. It was literally the sword imparting the majority of the skill.  Iccy would be a good fight. I think sichas, as much as he's one of my favourites, would get owned by dassem IMO."
Malazan,2u6z1t,drae-,5,Fri Jan 30 18:35:26 2015 UTC,"Well Rake was 7 because he got bored and stopped climbing the ranks because he was confused/annoyed. Dassem was 1 because they gave him 1, he didn't fight anyone for it. And that's the Seguleh rankings. It's not like world ranking.  So Hust sword makes you super agile? Was he using a Hust sword when he nonchalantly killed a Fokrul Assail and then five Liosan while barely trying?  And that's your opinion on Silchas but that in no way makes it a fact. The only person of skill we see Silchas fight is Trull and he makes short work of him. And we all know Trull was a superb spear wielder since he held Icarium for longer than 10 seconds."
Malazan,2u6z1t,SerBronnofBlackwater,2,Fri Jan 30 19:00:30 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree with the while seguleh thing, rake could likely progress further then 7, and dassem didn't climb the ranks. I was being flippant, sorry.  It's commented that the hust sword seemed to lead his hand. Killing liosans is no different then killing tiste, and its possible that fa was watered. I will not disagree that the watch is badass, but he's not in the same league as dassem. One is a God with a bad ass sword, one is a potential ascendant with a bad ass sword.   Just because silchas beat Trull, and Trull held off icarium, does not mean silchas > icarium. Circumstance matters. Ya silchas could likely beat dassem if he flew over him and breathed fire, but in a sword fight? No way."
Malazan,2u6z1t,drae-,2,Fri Jan 30 19:13:27 2015 UTC,"""Just because silchas beat Trull, and Trull held off icarium, does not mean silchas > icarium.""  That's not what I meant. I was just establishing Silchas' abilities with a sword not that he was better than Icarium.   All I'm saying is there's no way you could tell if he could or couldn't beat Dassem because you've never seen the characters fight each other."
Malazan,2u6z1t,SerBronnofBlackwater,1 point,Fri Jan 30 19:53:35 2015 UTC,"Also Icarium, Trull, Silchas and everyone else are not Human, they are their own races and obviously if you can turn into a dragon at will then that surely ""should"" mean you can beat a lowly mortal no matter how good they are at wielding a sword"
Malazan,2u6z1t,reaperlord14,2,Thu Feb 5 22:58:29 2015 UTC,Didn't Rake kill the seventh and only the seventh and he didn't do it to climb the ranks? He had no wish to climb the ranks unless I completely forget.
Malazan,2u6z1t,Aiolus,3,Sat Jan 31 06:59:28 2015 UTC,"He just wanted to talk but obviously him doing so issued a challenge to each Seguleh he met, and eventually got fed up and left"
Malazan,2u6z1t,reaperlord14,5,Thu Feb 5 22:59:02 2015 UTC,"Rake won their fight. I don't understand how people don't see this. He was at an immense disadvantage, but still manipulated the duel so that the final blow landed exactly where he wanted it to."
Malazan,2u6z1t,Quantum_Finger,4,Sat Jan 31 17:03:17 2015 UTC,"I do Brazilian jiu jitsu as a hobby (kinda like judo, but with much more ground-based chokes and joint locks). One on one duels is the nature of the game and I have rolled around with a spectrum of people ranging from world champion to child beginners for six years now.  I can set myself up to lose however I want and it doesn't mean that I'm necessarily better than the person I'm grappling. It means that I can configure my body fairly well and leave the opportunity there to be seized. Two extremely elite grapplers of roughly equal skill and ability can also roll for a very long time before someone actually loses by choke or joint lock. I'm talking 2 hours plus. Most of the matches don't last that long, but sometimes, to actually get the ""kill"" takes so long and is so hard that the winner has nothing left for the next fight.  I theorize that Rake figured he had to throw the fight in order to accomplish what he needed to do inside Dragnipur. To actually fight out the battle with Dassem would take so long (the battle with Draconus took three days, as per Envy's eyewitness account) that the convergence would be overwhelmingly stacked against Rake's and Hood's plans. It had to happen then or the sword would taken. Rake picked Dassem to fight in the hopes that Dassem would pick up the sword and/or guard it against all comers until Rake was done with his sword-breaking process.   So I think Erikson set up Rake to be on a par with Dassem with the purposeful obscuring of ""who is better"" being a key feature of that. I suspect Dassem is minutely better, but we didn't get to see that on the page."

I remember Kyle saying that something was different about him after he came back   Oh and he killed some guy named Anomander Rake.    Well to be fair to me and a lot of people it seems like Anomander intentionally killed himself. I don't think you can give Dassem the credit for it.  Either way what I think  First sword of the empire = Title with no power  First sword of the Imass = Title with no power (except over the Imass)  Knight of death = Title with no power (Possibly, undecided)  My point is that yes he's an ascended human who's an exceptional fighter but why would he be above any other ascendant or god? Why would Kellanved AND Dancer  both being ascendants (with several hounds of shadow) be weary of Dassem when he is alone."
Malazan,2u6z1t,titanemesis,30,Fri Jan 30 14:21:35 2015 UTC,"Let me try and expand on a few of the ideas that Drae mentioned.  The titles bestowed upon everyone don't necessarily grant power, but are rather explanations of the nature of the person that inherits them.   For example: Knight of High House Death implies you are one seriously scary motherfucker with a blade in your hand. Ganoes Paran inherited QUITE a lot of power from being recognized as Master of the Deck, and, and Fiddler basically had the gift of prophesy (reading the deck of dragons without the 'talent' ain't no joke). Karsa Olong being the Knight of High House Chains was basically a description of the weight of his actions he carried with him - something even Kaminsod failed to fully grasp.  But anyway, What does all that have to do with Dassem becoming an ascendant with powers? Well, the allusions to the 'First Sword' touches upon it a lot. Let's take it step-by-step:   He was the *First Sword of the Empire* i.e the absolute commander of the Malazan Armies, second only to Kellanved and Dancer. In that position, he was adored - and worshipped - by the men he led into battle, to the point that they would lay down their lives for him. His martial prowess and genuine concern for his men garnered him more sincere worshippers than many Gods at the time. And worshippers are a key ingredient to Godhood in Wu. So while it had no power in technical terms, in reality it definitely did because of who Dassem was. He spent time in the deadhouse on Malaz along with the other Old Guard. This is key, because it is revealed that the deadhouses are an Azath creation and the Azathanai are revealed to be FOD SPOILER. Deadhouse gates explores the potential power of the Azath houses, and why they are guarded so carefully. His exposure to these ascendant-creating forces is important, because: He was made *First Sword of the T'Lan Imass* - a gift / curse with from Logros, that may or may not have given him (further) ascendant powers. In addition to having a massive human following, he was also literally the commander of an army of the undead. Tool is shocked to his core when Logros reveals this to him, as he personally knows what the burden (and cost) of the title involves. But regardless, Dassem leads death itself into battle. In fact, Dassem's legend grew so large (and potent) that his personal bodyguard - also known as The Empire's First Sword - gained minor ascendant qualities of their own. Long lifespans, increased martial prowess (and let's remember, these were the guys lethal enough to be trusted to watch the back of one of the most dangerous men alive).   So basically, without even factoring in Hood's patronage, Dassem was already well on his way to ascendanthood/godhood. When Hood betrayed him, he was far enough along that the tragedy of his circumstances allowed him to embody (and perhaps tear away) the title of Lord of Tragedy from Dessembrae.  In short: Dassem was absolutely every bit as terrifying as everyone treats him. That's not to say he is without equal, but the people with power know he ain't nothing to fuck with.  Even Shadowthrone and Cotillion, with their hounds? - Yeah bro. Karsa fucked up a few hounds himself, and he is a terrifying bastard in his own right, who regarded Dassem as an equal / contemporary.  Even Kallor, the shambling High King of an empty empire? - Yeah bro. Remember, Whiskeyjack nearly killed Kallor himself, and 'Jack was Dassem's sparring buddy.  And the jury is still out on whether Rake threw that fight or not. I personally think he allowed himself to be killed, but there are a compelling argument to support Dassem really being THAT good."

Malazan,2u6z1t,whispen,2,Fri Jan 30 22:14:52 2015 UTC,Only because I will it.
Malazan,2u6z1t,titanemesis,0,Fri Jan 30 22:15:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think your arguments necessarily contradict my points because after all, don't most of your points hold true for Dancer/Cotillion (And in some parts Kellanved)? Maybe to a lesser degree  Dassem was the first swrod of the Imass, but Kellanvad sat on the throne  Dassem was the sword of the empire but as you say he was second to Dancer and Kellanved  Deadhouse? Yup  Patronage is a bit interesting. Shadowthrone might not have much in terms of patronage (Unless worshipping Shadow counts as directly worshipping Kellanved) , but we get a scene when Crokus speaks to Dancer and he briefly talks about how he gives blessings to assassins ""asking for his help""  If we look at what we know about them as fighters the one subject that comes to my mind is Skinner & Cowl. Skinner & Cowl are widely regarded as close in skill yes? Skinner was known as one of the few who could stand against Dassem and survive and Dancer was seen as equal/better than Cowl. Would it be far fetched to think that Dancer was close to Dassem in skill when both were ""ordinary humans""?   Even Shadowthrone and Cotillion, with their hounds? - Yeah bro. Karsa fucked up a few hounds himself, and he is a terrifying bastard in his own right, who regarded Dassem as an equal / contemporary.   Yes if you take them on one by one sure, but if Dassem were to charge into shadow to kill them you could expect that he'd be forced to fight Shadowthrone+Cotillion+Shadowhounds at the same time. Remember they never play fair   Even Kallor, the shambling High King of an empty empire? - Yeah bro. Remember, Whiskeyjack nearly killed Kallor himself, and 'Jack was Dassem's sparring buddy.   You are probably underestimating Kallor.  This is the same man who cursed 3 elder gods, has killed several dragons, Jaghuts and tried to kill Silverfox while Whiskeyjack AND Tayschrenn were standing right next to her and escaped alive. I mean he's no Anomander Rake but he's obviously a very potent fighter far above any ordinary human"
Malazan,2u6z1t,Montaron87,7,Fri Jan 30 16:15:36 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm absolutely not really contradicting what you're saying, only perhaps giving it more context.  Shadowthrone and Cotillion's power was never in question: they've already been established as extremely powerful, and not to be fucked with. They would probably win in a direct confrontation with Dassem, but that doesn't mean it would be easy. They respect his abilities, and are wary of him. He is nothing to take lightly, which is why when they manipulate him (and delay his arrival on Genabackis, etc.), they do so very carefully.  That being said, I absolutely think that if Cotillion got the drop on Dassem, it would be game over. But that's a big if. Same goes for Shadowthrone. In a fair fight (which would never happen), Dassem would be a formidable opponent.  In short: they're unbeatable as a pair, and an even match (more or less) for Dassem individually. But that doesn't mean Dassem isn't considerably powerful himself. He is definitely ascendant / god level. This becomes even more evident later in ICE's series (Orb Sceptre Throne in particular).  As for Kallor: for the rest of this paragraph, just assume Kill = defeated where he is concerned, because the dude is functionally immortal because of the curse. Don't get me wrong: the High King is definitely above any ordinary human, but he's not quite in Dassem's league. There are a number of examples of him getting his shit handed to him.    To expand on the Whiskeyjack: he actually had Kallor dead to rights before his knee gave out, otherwise he would have killed him.  In TTH: the Tiste Andii Spinnock Durav deliberately fought Kallor to a standstill (instead of killing him) to delay him.  Finally, Dassem does actually 'kill' Kallor (in RoTCG i believe,when Kyle and the others rescue K'azz. If not then, then definitely in one of the ICE books)."

What more proof of his power do you need than the fact that these superpowers are all shitting their pants at his mention? Even if his power isn't exactly shown in tangible examples.   In the world of Malazan, power comes from perception, belief and supporters.  Nefarious Bredd is literally willed to life by the remaining Bonehunters. People believe Dassem is a god, therefore he becomes a god. Kallor had the power to curse those Elder gods, and he sacrificed an entire continent to get it."
Malazan,2u6z1t,drae-,15,Fri Jan 30 17:31:06 2015 UTC,"still a lone swordsman no matter how good he is would never make an ENTIRE army back off, eventually the masses win unless he has a extremely advantageous chokehold.

Malazan,2u6z1t,Anomander,8,Fri Jan 30 15:29:08 2015 UTC,"Not arguing that, still a lone swordsman no matter how good he is would never make an ENTIRE army back off, eventually the masses win unless he has a extremely advantageous chokehold.   Except he's a god, and an ascendant.   My memory might be off, but is this implied anywhere? That they recieved any benefits from staying in the deadhouse?   It's implied that they received longevity, resistance to disease, and a sort of vitality from living in the deadhouse. Can't remember when and where, but for example Dujek is described as being 79 years old, but looking 50.    I might be wrong, but a most of these titles are JUST titles and offer no extra power. Gruntle gained extra powers from Trake, but Fiddler, Paran, Banaschar, Trull etc etc seemed to recieve nothing from their titles A god can grant extra powers, but he can also take it away (And if Dassem recieved anything from Hood, then surely he would've removed it in the first place)   Gruntle did gain power from trake, Iktovian gained power from Fener, Heboric gained powers from trake & fener, there are as many instances where titles confer power as there are instances where they don't. Usually governed by the character of the titled, and the stature of the God. Banaschar displays no powers, until the end; because the worm had destroyed all it's worshipers, and therefore significantly limited his power and influence. If power is funneled to the title holder, then a reduction (or lack of) power held by the God directly translates to power for the title holder.   One could argue that, given the power of mortal worshipers over their gods, that gods cannot control the power accrued by the follower from the god. Examples include featherwitch - Errant and Mallick Rel - Mael.  Sometimes the powers granted are simply in the form of efficiency. Look at Trull, how could a mortal man hold back Icarium with just a spear? At the time of that convergence Trull has taken the mantle of shadow, and it could be opined that it's the title that grants him the proficiency to hold back Icarium, as no where else does he display such an appalling level of skill. Often times the power conferred is simply enhanced talents they already wielded. I think the power Dassem receives from Hood is similar, simply an expansion of his natural abilities.    Since English isn't my native language, but Dassem time of ascension was when he was pulled under ground into the warren of driss right? I remember Kyle saying that something was different about him after he came back   It's really hard to pinpoint exactly where he ascends. Does he ascend while knight of high house death? Maybe in the moment he swears vengeance on hood? Maybe during the event your describing, it's hard to tell, there's no Level -up bubble that's for sure.   Well to be fair to me and a lot of people it seems like Anomander intentionally killed himself. I don't think you can give Dassem the credit for it.   Absolutely Anomander let Dassem kill him. That does not take away from the fact that Dassem didn't know that until the last second, and he still engaged, knowing full well who he's attacking and how powerful he is, I doubt a man with Dassems experience would engage without an opportunity to win. Also 1st > 7th.    First sword of the empire = Title with no power First sword of the Imass = Title with no power (except over the Imass) Knight of death = Title with no power (Possibly, undecided)   Those titles have to be earned. You don't earn them by being nobody. If dassem had no power as the Knight of Death, why was he at the chaining of the crippled god? Not exactly a spectator sport. Tool had power as the first sword of the Imass, (gotism maybe), we don't see enough of this time frame to determine if Dassem had the same power, or what power that title may have conferred. First sword of the empire is a military position, and I would agree that no non-mundane power is conferred by that title.   I think Dancer and Shadowthrone are afraid of dassem at that moment because of the circumstances, they can't beat dassem in a fair fight face to face, but on grounds of their choosing, playing to their strength; I doubt either would back off. Shadowthrone is a schemer, not a fighter, his strengths (both as a god and as a mortal) was in manipulating events and people. Dancer is an assassin, his strengths are ambushing, striking from concealment. Dassems strength is fighting. Of course they didn't want to engage dassem in a straight fight, they'd lose. But scheme to get him in the right position with his guard down and attack from behind.... oh wait surly tried that...  TL:DR -  * Power conferred is often an enhancement of existing talents, not necessarily the ability to throw fireballs; and therefore can be a very subtle thing. * Gods cannot simply recant the power they've invested in their followers, and often have no say in the deck positions assumed by them.* Shadowthrone and Cotillion back off from dancer because of the circumstances."
Malazan,2u6z1t,drae-,4,Fri Jan 30 16:04:45 2015 UTC,"Also 1st > 7th.   Huge nitpick though: 1st was empty prior to Dassem, mask was lost at the time, etc; but the position was one granted by abstract judgements of worthiness, not one won via combat like all other ranks.    He only actually won rank 7th, having killed Anomander.  The First mask came to him because everyone else present and eligible refused to take the mask, and he was not challenged by those below him in its taking.     ‘It was only chance, then, that it was the very option the First least wished to pursue. And because of that the mask did not come to you …’  Lo nodded again. ‘I merely presented the choice. Choices surround us every day, son. The test is in the choosing.’  Sall’s breath caught. ‘He passed your test.’  ‘Yes. Sall, the truth of it is that once you are competent enough in your technique, or your speed is as great as it can be – then what differentiates those at the highest levels? The truth is that unquantifiable ability to read others. To enter into their skin. To be able to understand them so completely that you know what they will do before they do it themselves. A sort of complete empathy. Jan possessed that. We could not help but love him for it. Gall worshipped him. But Gall was a traditionalist and would not have followed the road Jan had chosen. And so Jan did what he had to do to ensure that the mask would not come to him. And Palla? Well, those two might as well have been husband and wife. She may never recover.’  ‘And so it came to you – but you never challenged him!’  Lo’s voice took on an edge. ‘His entire life has been his test, Sall. That is my judgement.’   While fans can and happily will debate whether Dassem was greater, equal, or lesser than any others of the 10th, the matter was decided without that challenge occurring, so his ""score"" if you will is not as meaningful as his other accomplishments."
Malazan,2u6z1t,Anomander,2,Fri Jan 30 21:24:38 2015 UTC,"Sorry, that was a flippant comment."
Malazan,2u6z1t,drae-,3,Fri Jan 30 21:50:23 2015 UTC,"I figured, but that scene and how he ended up First was not just the ""climax"" moment of OST, but also this very pivotal moment in understanding the Seguleh culture and a very fascinating single example of the Seguleh's ... belligerent, pugilistic, martialocractic society allows its most fundamental value - the challenge - to be secondary to more esoteric cultural values.    That, essentially, Second is the highest rank pure martial skill can ever take you, and that First is a position that is given, not taken.   They're one of the most interesting societies that SE & ICE created, and the sparseness of clues and exposition just made that even more fun and interesting.   I thought that Dassem being judged worthy was actually a more telling credit to the character than if he'd simply taken it through swordplay alone."
Malazan,2u6z1t,Anomander,3,Fri Jan 30 22:08:10 2015 UTC,"Some interesting points. It's always nice to see long thought out posts that actually spur discussion and I always appreciate them whether I disagree or agree! :)   Sometimes the powers granted are simply in the form of efficiency. Look at Trull, how could a mortal man hold back Icarium with just a spear? At the time of that convergence Trull has taken the mantle of shadow, and it could be opined that it's the title that grants him the proficiency to hold back Icarium, as no where else does he display such an appalling level of skill   I always took it as Trull was always that good. We did get a lot of hints from the moment we met him how insanely good he was with that spear. That said it's entirely possible that he stepped it up to another level after the whole shadow affair   Often times the power conferred is simply enhanced talents they already wielded. I think the power Dassem receives from Hood is similar, simply an expansion of his natural abilities.    Heboric is the outlier I think. He recieved physical, magical and enhanced combat compared to what he was before, but as far as I can recall all other cases are just pure enhancements as you say   It's really hard to pinpoint exactly where he ascends. Does he ascend while knight of high house death? Maybe in the moment he swears vengeance on hood? Maybe during the event your describing, it's hard to tell, there's no Level -up bubble that's for sure.   I have no clue, but what else could be meant by ""seems different""? We had cases earlier were you could literally see that people were on the verge of ascending (Coltaine)   If dassem had no power as the Knight of Death, why was he at the chaining of the crippled god? Not exactly a spectator sport   Except we get to know that Dancer was present at the chaining (And the chaining took place before they ascended and became Cotillion & Shadowthrone)   Also 1st > 7th.    "" It was said that Anomander Rake had visited the island and, due to his perceived arrogance, provoked countless attacks by the Seguleh present. A skilled swordsman, Anomander defeated numerous Seguleh warriors, unknowingly advancing through the hierarchy and achieving the rank of Seguleh Seventh. Frustrated and uncomprehending, Anomander left the island without taking the mask of his rank, an act which angered all Seguleh and persisted into the modern Malazan period of history as this was considered an insult to their customs and traditions. ""  God we could really use a book that really writes out Dassem's history from the beginning. His story is such a mess that can easily be looked at differently by everyone   Gods cannot simply recant the power they've invested in their followers   Didn't someone lose their power? Was it Heboric who was stripped?"
Malazan,2u6z1t,Anomander,2,Fri Jan 30 16:37:50 2015 UTC,"He was stripped, but not by the god, by the gods followers. The ritual was actually anathema to fener because heboric did not commit the crimes he was accused of.  Been a real joy talking to you as well."
Malazan,2u6z1t,speedsk8,0,Fri Jan 30 18:29:13 2015 UTC,No that was before we met Heboric  I'm talking about a character that was stripped of his powers by X god when he really needed them
Malazan,2u6z1t,Anomander,3,Sat Jan 31 11:16:18 2015 UTC,"My point is that yes he's an ascended human who's an exceptional fighter but why would he be above any other ascendant or god?    Because that's how the character is written.   Erikson/Esslmont aren't into spoon feeding and exposition; they prefer to just show results. Dassem is powerful enough that other powers are wary of him. Anomander has a sword containing a miniature universe made up of nothing but a wagon, dead people, and a portal to Chaos; Dassem being intimidating is what challenges your ability to suspend disbelief?   Lorewise ascendants are not made equal, nor is ""power"" as a concept defined or demarcated. Those deemed powerful are shown as stronger, faster, and harder to kill than normal people, and ascension is just more power.   The titles he has don't necessarily give him power, they are given because of existing power. But remember that Paran was just randomly called ""master of the deck"" and look how that turned out down the road."
Malazan,2u6z1t,speedsk8,-1,Fri Jan 30 16:56:41 2015 UTC,"I think the universe was pretty consistent. The general rule seemed to be that age & worshippers reflected how much power the god/ascendant wielded  The most powerful entities were the oldest, but if the old god was ""forgotten"" then even the new gods could be stronger  Can you think of any god/ascendant which breaks this pattern except Dassem?"
Malazan,2u6z1t,Gaebryal,6,Fri Jan 30 17:23:14 2015 UTC,"The general rule seemed to be that age & worshippers reflected how much power the god/ascendant wielded   Ish.  But also other measures of power and other sources.  It wasn't that simple, the rules and mechanics were never formally laid out.  Power, as a concept, is a very ambiguous and undefined quality in Wu.    Gods' power is tied to their worshippers, but also their own resources, while Ascendants are generally pre-gods but sometimes they're way fucking stronger than the gods themselves and even then half the point of the books is that no matter how together your shit is some farmer with a pointy stick still manages to end you.     Can you think of any god/ascendant which breaks this pattern except Dassem?   I don't think Dassem breaks ""this"" pattern at all.  He's got most of the entire military of the biggest nation on Wu, as well as a good chunk of the general population, all worshiping him as a god.  At differing times the T'Lan Imass and Hood himself have both recognized him as ""really seriously definitely crazy dangerous"" with a formal title reflecting that.  He's not some random unknown and then flashy swordplay and fuck the lore.    I mean, really, Kallor should be the one you're harping on about.  He's literally just a really old normal human being.  Every worshiper he might've had as High King was killed during his fall - specifically, he burnt the entire continent to ""ash and bone"" and used the power of that slaughter to curse the elder gods.  How he achieved the burning of Jacuruku should really be puzzling because he's never been described as sorcerous before or after, the ""how"" still is unexplained.    Since then he's wandered around and been forgotten by pretty much everyone and is still subject to aging and injury in ways the Ascendant need not worry about ...  He cannot ascend and still occasionally tries to play with the big boys anyway."

The intention was that he arrive intact as a weapon against Kallor's rule of the continent - instead he kinda disintegrated on impact. The books are very specific that Kallor burnt the continent bare rather than lose it - in response to the threat posed by the Elder Gods' approach."

Malazan,2u6z1t,AwareTheLegend,0,Sat Jan 31 03:58:06 2015 UTC,"i always read it as they meant to bring the CG down on top of  Kallor, as a meteor, but it was more power than they could handle, so it destroyed the continent.  and despite that, it wasnt enough to kill Kallor"
Malazan,2u6z1t,drae-,2,Wed Feb 4 19:33:07 2015 UTC,"The exact intent with the summoning of CG is unclear; the fact that the conjuring was not by Kallor, intentional, went slightly wrong, and was intended to fuck with Kallor is clear - whether they wanted the Orbital Strike execution or just wanted a pet god is less clear.  That the CG summoning damaged the continents of Korelri and Jacuruku is clear as well, the extent of this damage is substantially less so.    Either way, Jacuruku survived enough that Kallor himself wiped it to ash and bone - as a ""if I can't have it, no one will"" gesture of spite, specifically against K'rul, Draconus, and Nightchill who were approaching somehow, with evident malice.  Whether this is ""they're walking here now"" or a more metaphorical sense is unclear. When they placed their curse on him, his empire was already dead; he used the ""energy"" of slaughtering a continent to curse them in return.    It's strongly implied that the Imperial Warren is somehow the remains of Jacuruku, bound into a warren by K'rul so the land can heal, but it's also clear that the continent is still physically there as characters have interacted with people from there recently and in RotCG a group even briefly spends time there.     it wasnt enough to kill Kallor   The resistance mages might've been intending his death, but don't give the man too much credit, the Elder gods' curse on him was ""mortal life unending, endless failure, and to never ascend.""  They wanted his ass alive and suffering.   K'rul: 'Know this: you, Kallor Eiderann Tes’thesula, shall know mortal life unending. Mortal, in the ravages of age, in the pain of wounds and the anguish of despair. In dreams brought to ruin. In love withered. In the shadow of Death’s spectre, ever a threat to end what you will not relinquish.’  Draconus:'Kallor Eiderann Tes’thesula, you shall never ascend.’  Nightchill: 'Kallor Eiderann Tes’thesula, each time you rise, you shall then fall. All that you achieve shall turn to dust in your hands. As you have wilfully done here, so it shall be in turn visited upon all that you do.’  K'rul: '‘Three voices curse you...It is done.’"

The only thing that changed was that the readings turned more powerful, but that was attributed to the convergence being absolutely massive  With Paran I was talking about Tavore and not Ganoes"
Malazan,2u6z1t,Landmarkmoon,2,Fri Jan 30 17:51:07 2015 UTC,While the First Sword title doesn't actually give any power it is an acknowledgement of skill.  Having a place in the deck doesn't give you any special power besides maybe influence over the course of events. With the exception of Paran his title gives him power once he figured out how to use it.   The difference between ascendants and gods is pretty non-existent and Dassem is probably one of the stronger gods/ascendants. ST and the Rope also know Dassem personally and know exactly what he is capable of. Not to mention straight up confrontation is not their style.
Malazan,2u6z1t,Ferivich,3,Fri Jan 30 15:50:56 2015 UTC,There's actually a big difference between gods and ascendants. Gods have worshipers.

Malazan,2u653m,Brus,2,Fri Jan 30 17:53:11 2015 UTC,"I had always interpreted it as a ""spicy smell"" like spicy Capsaicin oil or something that would be an assault on your senses, especially considering how some characters describe their eyes watering from the strength of the smell."
Malazan,2u653m,tripod-pop,2,Sat Jan 31 00:38:29 2015 UTC,I think the 'woody' was a hint of what warren was being used... If I remember correctly it was MoI towards the beginning when Quick steps back into the encampment.

That would have been referring to a fair number of Soletaken/D'ivers moving through there to traverse the Seven Cities while looking for the Path of Hands. Although with the tenuous links between Tellann and the ritual that turned most of the First Heroes into Soletaken, it could be that's what their transformation is based on."

Cotillion I always loved too (Especially that part when he appears in front of Kalam and shows him how good he really is)  Hopefully get started on the other books later this year maybe, doing the discworld novels at the moment there quite enjoyable reads."

Out of all the Elder Gods that were really fleshed out, he was basically the only one to actually realize that things couldn't go back to the way they were. Additionally he hangs around with a half-genius/half-insane fellow as his servant just for shits and giggles. Tehol is a good character as well, but it's Bugg that makes him hilarious.

I figure Andarist is either his only name/his last name too because he established his own hold named Andarist, so I presume that would have been the last name of any of his children, however that didn't happen FoD/TtH. Not sure which book it's first mentioned in during the main series, but it's definitely referenced well enough in TtH."
Malazan,2tkq5l,MoranthMunitions,3,Sun Jan 25 03:23:28 2015 UTC,"Looking of the Dramatis Personae of FoD, it seems there are quite a few Tiste that share their family names. Spinnock and Cyrl Durav, Sukul and Sharenas Ankhadu and Neres and Sandalath Drukorlat. So they can share last names."
Malazan,2tkq5l,Ezzelino,2,Sun Jan 25 19:48:58 2015 UTC,"I thought Andarist was the eldest brother. I was always under the impression that Anomander's true name, Anomandaris, was just a variation of Andarist to denote the younger age of Anomandaris."
Malazan,2tkq5l,holyplankton,3,Tue Jan 27 14:09:21 2015 UTC,"annomander is the eldest, the first son of darkness.  When andarist asks cutter if annomander had renounced his dragon blood, he said hed look older, much older than himself."
Malazan,2tkq5l,Gaebryal,1 point,Tue Jan 27 19:25:38 2015 UTC,"Ok, that was my misunderstanding then, I thought Andarist was the eldest since he appeared to be the oldest among them. I missed that explanation about renouncing his draconic blood."
Malazan,2tkq5l,holyplankton,5,Tue Jan 27 20:14:55 2015 UTC,"Just to be 100% clear, Andarist never had any draconic blood, as it could be inferred from what was said.   At least Silchas Ruin, as the youngest, looks his part. Drank the deepest of Tiam's blood, by his own admission, then spent >100k years keeping out of the sun's harmful rays and his skin pristine. Which could be important if you're the only white Tiste Andii, I figure the Liosan are alright in the sun because of the whole light aspect, but I'd be concerned about melanomas if I were him."
Malazan,2tkq5l,MoranthMunitions,1 point,Wed Jan 28 10:15:12 2015 UTC,I believe if FOD its pretty clear anomander is the eldest.
Malazan,2tkq5l,drae-,1 point,Fri Jan 30 19:30:30 2015 UTC,I searched the main books and FoD but didn't find a separate last name. Don't know about the ICE books yet.
Malazan,2tkq5l,strawberrysundaeandt,1 point,Sun Jan 25 03:20:35 2015 UTC,"Never thought about it. I always assumed they just had given names, whether single or double names.   In the whole series I don't really recall any Tiste sharing a last name despite being related. Korlat / Orfantal.   In FoD there is something of a hint but I'm on mobile and don't remember the spoiler tag and don't want to spoil anything. If you're interested in it let me know and I'll post."
Malazan,2tkq5l,Aiolus,1 point,Sun Jan 25 07:38:41 2015 UTC,I'm definitely interested.
Malazan,2tkq5l,Aiolus,2,Sun Jan 25 14:25:16 2015 UTC,Well it didn't turn out quite how I thought it would. Anyways I was curious too so I did a little research and I think this is pretty much what's going on. So yea it's a bit rambling but here's some info.  FoD and Minor Spoilers All
Malazan,2tkq5l,Giotto,1 point,Sun Jan 25 16:18:56 2015 UTC,"Good question. Pretty inconclusive in the replies here, might even be somewhat of a plothole. I imagine we'll learn more in the Kharkanas trilogy."
Malazan,2tjrrx,LREC,6,Sat Jan 24 21:16:37 2015 UTC,"From what I remember, it's a collection of things. Note, I have yet to read Forge of Darkness, so most of my info is from the main series.  The Tiste Andii are a REALLY long lived people. Most, if not nearly all, of the Andii alive in the events of the novels remember living in Kharkanas before Mother Dark left them, before they were sealed out of their warran, before they've gone to war, etc. They live in perpetual grief because they, as a species, have literally had their fall from grace.  The key event in their history is Mother Dark leaving them. Suddenly, they found themselves without their ruler/God (I'm unsure which Mother Dark was, exactly). After that, they were forced out of their homes, unable to return since the gate to the warran of darkness is locked away inside Dragnipur. There is little to no Andii children, so they're stuck living with the same people for centuries. And, any other mortal they're befriend is most likely going to die before they do, because of the Andii's longevity.   So they live together, following Rake, with little to no change in their culture and lifestyle. From all this, it's no surprise they live in perpetual grief."
Malazan,2tjrrx,Therrester,1 point,Sat Jan 24 21:26:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! Makes sense, I forgot that Mother Dark left them."
Malazan,2tjrrx,drae-,1 point,Sat Jan 24 23:15:50 2015 UTC,Mother dark was both ruler and God. Like a Pharaoh
Malazan,2tjrrx,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Fri Jan 30 19:38:47 2015 UTC,"Not a bad question. This is detailed in the book Forge of Darkness, Book One of the Karkhanas trilogy.   Spoilers Ahead:  This is from memory and as such may be a little off, so bear with me and anybody else please correct me if I'm wrong. The goddess Mother Dark, thanks to Draconus and others, turned away from the Titse Andii. This caused a massive revolution between the new Father Light based Andii or ""Liossan"" and the Titse Andii.  Many other major events happened (coming of Shadow, splitting of Kurhlaid Emerhlan, betrayal of Silchas Ruin, and Andarist  being sent to Drift Availi) and the remnants of the Titse Andii led by Anomander Rake fled to the Malazan world and have lived out their long long lives in despair ever since at their situation and the lack of presence of Mother Dark."
Malazan,2tjrrx,drae-,1 point,Sat Jan 24 21:31:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply! Definitely need to read Forge of Darkness when I finish Book of the Fallen.
Malazan,2tjrrx,SerhumXen,1 point,Sat Jan 24 23:16:22 2015 UTC,I'd say the rifts is caused by ursanders forces more then draconus'. But that's just my opinion as a draconus fan.
Malazan,2tjrrx,ginfish,1 point,Fri Jan 30 19:40:17 2015 UTC,"In addition to what the others have said (Fall from Grace, Long Life) they also lack purpose. Rake tries to find one which is why they were involved in GotM, MoI, and prior."
Malazan,2thux7,xHiKaene3zYnhavzaUqV,4,Sat Jan 24 07:37:35 2015 UTC,Haha I know what you mean. It's like Icarium came out of hyper space at the last second to save the day
Malazan,2thux7,SerBronnofBlackwater,2,Sat Jan 24 16:49:00 2015 UTC,deus ex immateria!
Malazan,2thux7,TriscuitCracker,3,Sun Jan 25 01:50:42 2015 UTC,Well now I know I need to read Dan Abnett's Titanicus. Glad you liked it!
Malazan,2tfnv6,Mryappy,2,Fri Jan 23 19:40:07 2015 UTC,"Nice job, he definitely has that dangerous look about him!  I always thought he had black hair though, but I might have just read it wrong."
Malazan,2tfnv6,BirdBathandBeyond,3,Fri Jan 23 20:02:37 2015 UTC,Haha thanks. I originally had black hair but further research told me that he had grey hair (apparently he was a healthy looking 60 year old)
Malazan,2tfnv6,BirdBathandBeyond,1 point,Fri Jan 23 23:58:42 2015 UTC,"Huh, I had no idea."
Malazan,2tfnv6,drynwhyl,1 point,Sat Jan 24 00:22:10 2015 UTC,"Kinda reminds me of Billy Connolly, great work!"

Malazan,2tfnv6,peopIe_mover,1 point,Fri Jan 23 23:59:00 2015 UTC,I like but did Bauchelain not have a widows peak? I've always pictured him Dracula-esque.
Malazan,2tfnv6,MoranthMunitions,1 point,Fri Jan 23 20:47:19 2015 UTC,Interesting point! I'll try it out and see if it looks better
Malazan,2tfnv6,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Fri Jan 23 23:57:59 2015 UTC,"Awesome! always pictured him with a thinner, bonier face, and a more menacing look though"
Malazan,2tfnv6,trolo-joe,1 point,Fri Jan 23 22:26:11 2015 UTC,Thanks! My first draft of him was way more gaunt but it made him look too frail haha. I thought giving him a bit more size would increase the menacing factor but I see what you mean
Malazan,2tfnv6,trolo-joe,3,Sat Jan 24 00:46:53 2015 UTC,Have you seen the the covers of the First Collected Tales of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach or The Wurms of Blearmouth? I think they managed to hit that balance fairly well.
Malazan,2th51v,RickyLidz,7,Sat Jan 24 02:49:18 2015 UTC,"Some incomplete answers here, so I'll try and round things up.  Kellanved and Dancer are both old, in their hundreds like /u/moranthmunitions says. However, their lives (and youth) is extended due to their time in the Deadhouse and also presumably through magical means.  Regarding the Chaining, it is not one event... There have been multiple chainings over hundreds and thousands of years. Shadowthrone and Cotillion were only present at the most recent one. Also, ICE books not including Assail  I can't remember exactly when that spoiler is revealed..."
Malazan,2th51v,MoranthMunitions,2,Sat Jan 24 15:20:38 2015 UTC,"I didn't bother to say because the comment I replied to was by OP, where they implied they saw the answer in another thread. I feel like it took me until BH or TtH to figure out there'd been multiple chainings, and I feel like that ICE bit was mentioned in the main series somewhere too, I'm just not sure where."
Malazan,2th51v,MoranthMunitions,1 point,Sat Jan 24 22:33:59 2015 UTC,Meant to say hawker but my tablet autocorrected to hawked and won't let me edit it  EDIT: ignore this.  Just read the exact same question further down
Malazan,2th51v,Dwolf63,3,Sat Jan 24 02:50:43 2015 UTC,"Kellanved and Dancer are probably more like ~150. The GoTM prologue was in the 96th year of their empire. And yeah, I was just thinking I read a thread on this the other day."
Malazan,2th51v,GuudeSpelur,1 point,Sat Jan 24 03:31:19 2015 UTC,"There's an answer to this that makes perfect sense but since I don't remember when it first becomes obvious, I'm not sure if it would be a ""spoiler"" though really it wouldn't really spoil anything.  So at your own risk"
Malazan,2th51v,Giotto,1 point,Sat Jan 24 03:39:10 2015 UTC,"The chaining has to be repeated every so often. There's a blink-and-you'll-miss-it reference to a recent chaining in Gardens of the Moon, when Kruppe is meeting with Baruk and reading a book."
Malazan,2tc8kc,HumbleAsFudge,19,Thu Jan 22 22:49:05 2015 UTC,"For a little while there, I thought about just deleting the sub, because there were so few posts.  I figured people just preferred the Malazan Forums, and the Encyclopedia Malazica.  I am, personally, uncomfortable with advertising the sub in other threads, unless it's completely relevant to the topic of discussion, so a lot of people didn't even know it existed.  I was extremely glad at the sudden uptick in posts, needless to say."
Malazan,2tc8kc,Anomander__Rake,2,Fri Jan 23 07:11:38 2015 UTC,I'm only on book 2 and made my account just for this sub.
Malazan,2tc8kc,sthreet,1 point,Tue Jan 27 19:35:48 2015 UTC,"I must now plug the subreddit I decided to make because the idea sounded cool that currently have no posts other than mine on it. (/r/hipsterbattle)  I will say that I like this subreddit, I used to go to the malazan forums chat, and I don't know why I don't anymore, except maybe it is easier to occasionally see highly rated posts on the front page of reddit."
Malazan,2tc8kc,number7,1 point,Fri Jan 23 17:59:20 2015 UTC,"Are you head mod now?  I remember when you were posting a book update each time you completed a book; or, were those reread updates?  Also, both Malazan Forums, and Encylcopedia Malazica seem dead.  From what I can tell they had their heyday when the original BotF series was being published and petered out afterwards."
Malazan,2tc8kc,AllWrong74,1 point,Sat Jan 24 02:21:04 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm head mod.  I created the sub.  I was on the 4th or 5th book when I realized there was no sub for the series and created it.  So, I was still reading through the first time when I was posting those (I just re-posted all the ones I had put in /r/fantasy right off the bat)."
Malazan,2tc8kc,number7,1 point,Sat Jan 24 06:14:51 2015 UTC,"Huh.  Never got that.  Well I at least appreciate you keeping it alive. We have a fraction of the activity of /r/asoiaf but we're more niche and there's very little need for tinfoil theories.  I feel like it's kind of our duty to act as shepherds into the series.  I've only convinced one of my friends to read it, but he was extremely grateful that I pushed him through GotM."
Malazan,2tc8kc,Tumblehawk,10,Sat Jan 24 07:32:49 2015 UTC,"Well, the thing about this series, with its dedication to the theme of compassion, and its embrace of political discourse and varied viewpoints...is that I felt it left me wanting to engage even MORE with the world...so while the reading experience itself was wonderfully escapist in that I immersed myself in a completely different world, it left (and leaves me) more awake in the world than I was when I encountered it."
Malazan,2tc8kc,TriscuitCracker,4,Thu Jan 22 23:07:12 2015 UTC,"I completely understand what  you mean, and thats sort of also what I was referring to when I say that the series has helped to me push through everyday life; every-time I put down the book I try and look at the world and the people around me with more respect and I am filled with an empathy which makes me want to change my surroundings for the better."
Malazan,2tc8kc,Aiolus,6,Thu Jan 22 23:19:47 2015 UTC,"Glad to have you, I feel the same way. I ponder Malazan sometimes just while doing everyday things, or remember a favorite scene or when talking deep issues. I wish my verbal skills were as eloquent as Eriksen's prose."
Malazan,2tc8kc,wheeloficeandfire,5,Fri Jan 23 01:20:56 2015 UTC,"I also really like this sub and try to answer questions when I can. It's actually a nice way to sort of stay in touch with the world by reading people's questions, rants, praise, and answers."
Malazan,2tc8kc,itkovian,2,Fri Jan 23 08:10:54 2015 UTC,"I'm still trying to get a friend to read the series, but he's started Wheel of Time instead so I guess it'll be a while yet.. In the meantime it's great to have this community! My favorite experience so far was when I finished TCG and posted about it and there were some great commments."
Malazan,2tc8kc,strawberrysundaeandt,2,Fri Jan 23 10:45:44 2015 UTC,"If you have questions, visit the Malazan forum, all book have separate categories, and mostly, they take care not to include (too many) spoilers. Check for old threads, which were ritten before more recent books came out. It'll give you a ton of information as well. -- edited for autocorrect."
Malazan,2tc8kc,madcowbomber,2,Fri Jan 23 13:38:11 2015 UTC,I find Malazan really engaging as a series and setting. The sub has helped me find resources like the Tor re-read too. As a side effect I'm mostly cured of my ASoIaF tinfoil addiction.  Looking forward to hear what you think about the other events in the series.
Malazan,2tbgxk,CaptainUnusual,13,Thu Jan 22 19:24:34 2015 UTC,"Doesn't really come across as a group of people practically begging him to come save them from Kallor. He came here as a savior/hero, only to be chained and abused.  He was so loved by his people that they undertook some kind of mass ritual to transport themselves across the heavens to join him. He had to have been an amazing god."
Malazan,2tbgxk,i_am_not_you_or_me,11,Thu Jan 22 19:45:12 2015 UTC,I reeeeally want to know what his home plane/planet is like and why his worshippers are trapped in jade statues and what he was the God of before he became Crippled. From his point of view he got abducted by aliens and used as a battery.
Malazan,2tbgxk,TriscuitCracker,6,Thu Jan 22 19:55:53 2015 UTC,"I imagine his followers followed on their own. The jade statues was their 'ship'. A race wide ritual akin to the ritual of tellan to survive the journey and find their god. When the first of the ships landed, their god was unavailable to free them from the ritual, thus they were trapped, just like him."
Malazan,2tbgxk,i_am_not_you_or_me,2,Thu Jan 22 20:00:39 2015 UTC,I believe there's a scene somewhere in the books where it's explained that he was the god of love and/or sex on his home planet. I think it's in one of those dream sequences with Silchas Ruin and the girl.
Malazan,2tbgxk,MellowHallow,1 point,Thu Jan 22 21:36:51 2015 UTC,Any idea which book has this scene?
Malazan,2tbgxk,speedsk8,2,Thu Jan 22 21:59:45 2015 UTC,"If I'm correct in that the scene is one of the dream sequences with Silchas as he tries to get out from under the Azath, then it would have to be Midnight Tides I think? Perhaps Reapers Gale?  Edit: Looked up Silchas, he was freed in Midnight Tides, so it would have to be that book I think."
Malazan,2tbgxk,MellowHallow,1 point,Thu Jan 22 22:14:07 2015 UTC,"The one where he fell in MT was in chapter 12, with Brys not Kettle. I don't think the others had anything to do with the Crippled God IIRC."
Malazan,2tbgxk,MoranthMunitions,1 point,Thu Jan 22 22:39:22 2015 UTC,"Its not when he's falling as far as I remember, it's Silchas showing Kettle (or maybe Brys I guess) the city where he came from."
Malazan,2tbgxk,MellowHallow,7,Thu Jan 22 23:16:24 2015 UTC,"The people who summoned him did it to use him as a weapon. He didn't agree to come save them from a tyrant, he was pulled to their world and torn apart in the process."
Malazan,2tbgxk,PromisedPrince694,2,Thu Jan 22 20:07:26 2015 UTC,But did he really come willingly to help them against Kallor? I thought that it was more like he was summoned against his will and he resisted so the summoning broke him.
Malazan,2tbgxk,titanemesis,12,Mon Jan 26 15:27:45 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting viewpoint. I totally get where you're coming from, and in a large part, that's precisely what Erikson is trying to show throughout the course of the series.  However, in the end, The Crippled God gets to go home; this vindicates his actions, and makes him less tragic than if he'd actually kicked the bucket.  Which is not to say that there aren't some downright heartwrenching characters in the series.  The most prominent in my mind is RoTCG Spoiler.  Trull got a pretty shitty deal too."
Malazan,2tbgxk,chappyyy,22,Thu Jan 22 20:22:04 2015 UTC,Tell me again about that tiste edur with the spear...

Malazan,2tbgxk,TriscuitCracker,3,Fri Jan 23 21:19:02 2015 UTC,Good example with Laseen and Trull. I always thought Toc got a really bad deal as well.
Malazan,2tbgxk,titanemesis,12,Thu Jan 22 20:57:48 2015 UTC,"Toc had some real heavy shit to deal with, aye.  Killed in GoTM.  Alive in MoI, partying with Tool and Envy. Promoted to Mortal Sword of the Grey Swords, like a boss. Betrayed by the Awl in Lether, and has entire army slaughtered. Dude bro is LITERALLY made to stand in a shithole, until Redmask rescues him. Dies again charging Letherii army. Lives (sort of) on as undead herald on horseback, where Olar Ethil makes him force his best friend back into an existence of misery.  How much shit does a dude need to go through, right?"

Malazan,2tbgxk,SerBronnofBlackwater,3,Thu Jan 22 19:31:00 2015 UTC,"Well, you know how a potato allows you to get an electrical current going with a potato, some zinc and copper. So they'd use his body in a similar way."

Malazan,2tciut,sleepinxonxbed,3,Fri Jan 23 00:09:40 2015 UTC,I definitely interpreted the tech level as being based in the Roman period and the soldiers looking a lot like legionaries (though the marines don't have shields or anything like that...).
Malazan,2tciut,Poser1313,3,Fri Jan 23 03:02:42 2015 UTC,"I think I read somewhere that the malazans were based off of the Byzantine empire.  So a bit of a mix of armour and clothing styles.  I think most of them wear chain mail with leather vests and maybe some steel shin guards or arm guards.  Edit* Also throughout the series several characters, usually of the heavier warrior type, are described as wearing banded armour, which would have multiple plates of metal covering the vital areas."
Malazan,2tciut,BirdBathandBeyond,2,Fri Jan 23 19:55:14 2015 UTC,"Its crazy I imagined kalam as idris elba as soon as I heard the description, the rest sort of come from a mix of dark souls,lotr,game of thrones sort of thing, kruppe was always my favourite to imagine or tool.

Malazan,2tciut,chappyyy,1 point,Fri Jan 23 00:36:50 2015 UTC,When you are finished MoI come back and tell us about some of your imaginative imagery. I'll be keen to hear it.  Some of my most epic jaw dropping moments were a result of that book and the pictures it paints for you. Epic.

Made those scenes really vivid and epic."
Malazan,2tciut,abir_valg2718,1 point,Fri Jan 23 05:12:31 2015 UTC,"That MoI cover definitely looks like hoplite armor, but the armor itself is too obscured to be sure.  The shield definitely brings the hoplites to mind for me.  I never pictured them armored this way.  I pictured chain hauberks for the Malazan marines, and heavier Eurocentric armor for the heavies.  For the Seven Cities folks, I pictured Persian Immortals https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortals_(Persian_Empire)#Equipment. (stupid Wikipedia and their stupid parenthesis in their URLs...)"
Malazan,2tafqu,HumbleAsFudge,4,Thu Jan 22 14:20:40 2015 UTC,"It's kind of hard to address this and not at the same time like you want. There's probably two details there that are a lot closer than I'd expect from someone whose just read GotM and DG. Which hopefully will make your speculation more interesting for you, have fun trying to find out which ones and how close.  Don't worry, this series has very few plot holes - incredibly few considering the scope - so most things you'll wonder about while reading will be addressed somewhere. It's definitely more fun to try to guess where it's going though, rereads are great for the small details but only being able to speculate on the plot the first time through, that kind of sucks."
Malazan,2tafqu,MoranthMunitions,3,Thu Jan 22 15:00:54 2015 UTC,"Well, it's certainly possible, I hadn't thought about the whirlwind type transport connection. I don't think there is any thing in the book that definitely says or implies the Whirlwind goddess rigged everything just so Felisin could take over however. I could certainly be wrong, it's been a while since I read DG. That's what the fun of Malazan is all about though, speculation! Good thinking."
Malazan,2tafqu,TriscuitCracker,3,Thu Jan 22 15:03:03 2015 UTC,"Interesting theories.  You might be onto something in some of it, but I wont tell you what.  Much of it is wrong as well, but I remember thinking similar things when I was that far along on the journey.  RAFO basically.  I'm on Toll the Hounds now, if you wonder what kind of basis I have.  Still floundering with other words, so do not take my word for anything."
Malazan,2tafqu,Sopp90,3,Thu Jan 22 15:03:58 2015 UTC,"Im not sure what the ""chained one"" has to do with this but Im sure this and multiple of my theories are addressed in the later books.   Not much directly at this point. In the long term though...  I don't recall Tiste Edur being mentioned in DG or that it was their warren. While that is certainly correct, that fragment was certainly a part of kurald emurlahn.  Also from memory I don't recall if it's DG that says what the goddess is, or is it HoC, so I""ll refrain to comment further.  As far as Felisin being Sha'ik reborn. That did not feel guided, but I could have missed references there. Frankly I feel I'm not sure, it's been some time since I read DG.  The entire fragmented warren thing is a huge clusterfuck, to think it served as a purpose for that. It might be, but too much of other things that are more relevant to it. The fragmented warren bit touches on several other plot points which will come along in various books."
Malazan,2tafqu,mmSNAKE,1 point,Thu Jan 22 19:20:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting.   Well, there is a fragment of Kurald Emurlahn anchored to Raraku by the deadhouse."

Malazan,2t4ank,dragonalthor,26,Wed Jan 21 01:20:50 2015 UTC,"You've already seen the typical responses. It gets better, 10-year gap between writing books 1 and 2, etc, etc.   All I will say is this: You have completed 10% of one of the longest  series out there. It feels like you've only scratched the surface because you've only scratched the surface.   Forget how other authors do things. The typical storytelling method in fantasy is formulaic and clichéd, but people seem to get hung up on it. Robert Jordan starts the reader off on an adventure that is 100% new to the characters, and get in their heads as they ride along and discover things for the first time. That's his method of building a story and a world, and it's quite typical in epic fantasy.  In Erikson's world, you are just dropped right in as an observer. As the series progresses you get into the characters' heads more, but there isn't much character development in the first book - it's all about observing, figuring things out and piecing them together. You may not become emotionally connected to some (or any) of the characters right away. That's OK, and you're not supposed to. You mentioned that it seemed like the characters had been besties for years - while that's not really the case, they have known each other for a long time. Some of them have known each other for thousands of years, have battled beside and against each other in different wars, and they aren't about to stop in the middle of a siege and tell each other their stories. Same thing with the magic system, it doesn't get explained via info dump and there's no equivalent to an Aes Sedai that teaches people how to use warrens, etc. You learn it as you progress through the series, through dozens of POV characters spanning across the world.  You as the reader just have to accept that, it's Erikson's storytelling method and I assure you it does work. You're hung up on your own expectations and seem to get a lot of nerd-rage when it's not going the way you had hoped - just relax and take it in. If you're unable to do that, read something else."
Malazan,2t4ank,TurboS40,8,Wed Jan 21 13:02:23 2015 UTC,Just wanted to say this was a great response lol you nailed it!
Malazan,2t4ank,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Wed Jan 21 14:10:29 2015 UTC,"I am not worried about info dumps, really if nothing else at all was explained about the warrens I would be fine, seemed intuitive to me. The bridge-burners already seemed like a cohesive unit so them interacting like they had know each other for years worked, it was a few others that seemed like that.  It isn't so much about thing not going the way I want, it was/is that I am felt like there wasn't anyone I could identify with or get that feeling that what happens to the characters matters and that seems to be what pulls me in, Game of Thrones hold some of those issues for me as well(though it definitely have some characters that grab you), I think that series almost works better on tv because it feels more like a soap opera that happens to be set on westeros"
Malazan,2t4ank,PhilosopherIshamael,9,Wed Jan 21 18:54:09 2015 UTC,"Hey, so one of the problems with the first book I think is that a lot of the emotion behind everything comes from understanding the history a little better, which only comes in the books after GOTM.  That being said, I didn't feel a huge connection to Tattersail either.  However, just some defense to what you said:  1) The Paran/Tattersail relationship makes a little more sense if you look at it from the perspective of a (fairly) young man who once had high ideals, but has grown weary and cynical working for an Adjunct.  He latches onto the first real human contact he has had in a while.  When he finds out that him being there isn't a promotion/being given some ""leash"", and is actually another ploy from the Empire, it kind of pushes him over the edge.  2) I can agree that the Tattersail/Lorn thing seemed shoehorned in, or at least abruptly brought up and then ""forgotten.""  I kind of liked it personally because it was a brief moment showing that the mechanical Lorn is actually more human than she seemed-which then gets immediately crushed back into the soul-sucking role of Adjunct.    About the other people, this is where the history thing comes in.  Whiskeyjack and Dujek are acting weird because there's a hidden game going on, with the elimination of the Bridgeburners.  They don't know if/how Lorn is personally involved, so they have to pretend like everything is kosher when it's clearly not.  Anyway, those defenses aside, feel free to not continue.  The series is difficult, sometimes in a way that I think is unnecessary even for someone trying to make a challenging adult series."
Malazan,2t4ank,Dwolf63,2,Wed Jan 21 04:39:47 2015 UTC,"lot of the emotion behind everything comes from understanding the history a little better   I just don't think that should be the case with the first book, not to the extent that this book has it seems. with that missing emotion there is no character connect and without that I don't care what happens. Really the Tyrant could have slaughtered everyone and that would have been just as fine of an ending as anything else. Delayed payoff is a great tool for a writer, but there should also be some payoff in the arc of the book itself and there wasn't any for me in this book. It is one thing leave some arcs open but nothing felt complete after the climax. To me there was no arc, defeating the Tyrant just didn't hold enough weight to the narrative to do the job and that was the only real candidate.   It doesn't matter how interconnected a book series is, or how much of a cliff hanger it ends on, it should still hold a contained conclusion in some fashion and I just don't see it.  I feel that the Whiskeyjack and Dujek parts were good and the information for what they were doing was enough as is with the right amount of mystery behind it, though why do they trust Paran so quickly seemed a bit off to me. As little time as I got with the two I felt them more keenly than some of the other characters, but from my experience the military leader types are easier to shape than other characters"
Malazan,2t4ank,Tarcanus,5,Wed Jan 21 06:13:38 2015 UTC,"I feel the need to analyse and critique this one sentence.  ""It doesn't matter how interconnected a book series is, or how much of a cliff hanger it ends on, it should still hold a contained conclusion in some fashion and I just don't see it.""  Let's get one thing straight. There is no written rule that says how a story must unfold. That should have been phrased ""... I expected a contained conclusion....""  Well, I'm sure you've been conditioned to expect a lot of things because so many authors do things the same way - not because it's ""right"" but because it's easy.   More telling is ""...I just don't see it.""  Exactly.. YOU don't see it.  You're not seeing it doesn't mean it's not there. More likely because you had expectations of things following a certain road, when they took a different fork you felt jarred out of your comfort zone, and it left you unsatisfied.  You're entitled to your opinion. If a particular style of story telling doesn't do it for you - then find a story teller who does.   But don't go making pronouncements about what ""should be"". The  rules for what make good literature are not yours, nor anyone else's, to write."
Malazan,2t4ank,holyplankton,1 point,Thu Jan 22 02:16:32 2015 UTC,"The ""I don't see it"" was me asking for someone to give their view of what they felt the arc was, that is the whole point of me seeking the conversation and looking for discourse as I sort through what I experienced. I perhaps could have phrased that better, but you have to realize I am not coming on here to force my view or opinons on any one.  It also puts thing on me, it recognizes that OTHERS SEE IT and that it is I AM NOT SEEING it, exactly why I am here  of course there are exception to every story telling rule, the majority of writers shouldn't stray from this, my view point at this particular moment is that this author is in that majority because I felt it didn't work for me. If you read through my other stuff in a different I specifically said it didn't work FOR ME. I might have missed a few qualifiers here and there but I didn't expect people to think that I though I was the definitive decider in these matters  On the point of qualifiers, You should also realize that it gets tiring to preface every thing with ""I think"" ""I feel"" ""in my opinion"" ""my viewpoint"". You should know it is just my opinion and give the benefit of the doubt when someone is seeking to discuss things that it is with the intention to expound upon what I see"
Malazan,2t4ank,Aiolus,3,Thu Jan 22 02:34:01 2015 UTC,"The arc for Gardens of the Moon revolves around the tyrant, its release, and its defeat.  Much like how other fantasy series open with the characters' main antagonist being a demon bear or king or something else with smaller impact on the larger world.  It's an opening conflict in a large, over-arching plot that encompasses the world.  Everything else that's going on:   Crokus learning about life The rest of the Daru crew finagling in the politics of the city The Bridgeburners and the plot they feel is going on The whole deal with Sorry Introducing Tool Introducing the Tiste Andii etc   Are ALL foundations for what comes later.  The fact that all of the plotlines converge on the defeat of the Tyrant is what I like best about Gardens of the Moon - and frankly what I think should've made it clear what the plot arc was in the book."
Malazan,2t4ank,Aiolus,1 point,Fri Jan 23 19:54:58 2015 UTC,"It just gave me no reason to care about the Tyrant as a protagonist, not in the slightest  He was a bad guy for the sake of being a bad guy, nothing more and that is as two dimensional as you can get"
Malazan,2t4ank,Aiolus,9,Sat Mar 28 03:37:58 2015 UTC,"One thing that I've noticed about Erikson is that he tends to tell you how emotionally impactful a situation is rather than letting the emotion hit you naturally. Sometimes this can evoke some powerful responses, but sometimes it also feels very forced, like the Paran/Tattersail relationship.   The second book is a completely new area of the world. Deadhouse Gates takes you to Seven Cities, an area talked about occasionally in the first book, but this is the first chance to see it in print. It does come with a whole slew of new characters, though Kalam, Fiddler, Crokus, and Sorry (now known as Apsalar) are in it as well.   One thing that I always like to point out is that Gardens of the Moon was written a long way before the rest of the series. It was Erikson's litmus test. The books get much more in depth, the characters develop much more naturally from here on out. The second half of Deadhouse Gates features an string of events known as the Chain of Dogs and is considered one of the more powerful sequences in the series. I'd say read the second book and see if that grips you a bit more before you decide to finish the series or not.  I understand that the books aren't necessarily for everyone, and that's perfectly ok. Malazan really needs you to invest your time into the first 2-3 books to really get into it, and I fully understand that it can seem like a very big investment for something you might not like. My advice is still to read Deadhouse Gates and see if you like it better than Gardens. If so, give the third book, Memories of Ice, a try. You'll be hooked from there."
Malazan,2t4ank,TrevorAndCorey,4,Wed Jan 21 02:44:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply  It really isn't that big of an investment, it only takes me a few days to read a book, but when I am not enjoying it it makes me illogically angry to keep reading it and then I am angry for days after I finish. I keep trying to start the second one, but I think I need to step back and let things simmer a bit. I just feel like there was no real story to this one, some of it should matter on its own and it didn't feel that way, I got no satisfaction, we'll see what happens after I simmmer"
Malazan,2t4ank,Aiolus,6,Wed Jan 21 06:27:24 2015 UTC,"I would say to skip the series. If you don't identify/care about the characters it is sort of a waste to read a million plus pages. Eventually and currently there are main protagonists but not exactly like in the classic 2-3 character POV. I found this incredibly refreshing but I can see how it might be jarring/unpleasant. I liked a world where there are many protagonists.  Not everything is for everyone and plenty of people have stopped reading after book one.   The characters I cared about/found compelling were; Whiskey Jack, Paran, Sorry, Cotillion, Ammanas, Rake, Kallor, Dujek, Kruppe, Toc, Topper, and the Bridge Burners (just to name some I remember being interested in). Some more then others. I didn't like Crokus as a character at all but was happy with pretty much all the others.    As for the reread I think people enjoyed it a lot because they were able to pick up subtle things they may have missed and just catch things that do get missed in the first read sometimes.  Sanderson is also one of my favorite writers and I love his books. His books typically go Chapter pov A, chapter pov b, chapter pov c with some mixing (which is very common). As for Sandersons characters I thought Shallan was the worst! She does get better though. Her and Crokus are a type of character I never enjoy.  Anyways if you are determined to read something you do not quite enjoy but want to finish try reading other things while knocking out some of it. Perhaps it is too slow of a start because of the large amount of characters and locations (book two)."
Malazan,2t4ank,TrevorAndCorey,3,Wed Jan 21 03:00:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the input, though you kind of confirmed Toc didn't die :P but I kind of assumed that anyway.  You are correct in that I do find character POV changes jarring to an extent. Lots of little side ones are OK if you give me a big chunk of one person that really lets me get lost in what I am reading. Each shift is like resetting and coming back to reality. On my rereads if I remember what happens in the side ones I will skip them most the time.  I also didn't care for Shallan much in the first book but the second one did a good job correcting it a ways. Can not wait to see some of the other orders.  Shame about Crokus, when he was first introduced I thought maybe I had gotten to a main protagonist(but why exactly was he a thief when his uncle seems to probably be a bit well off, theivery out of nessecity is one thing, but was it just for the sport?), Paran seemed the most likely candidate at first but never settled on him enough for that to be the case to me, plus they were hardly ever actually in control of what is going in the events they participated in, they seemed more along for the ride than anything else  So, is the whole series pretty scatter shot when it comes to character POV or does it settle down a bit? With the amount of time he spent on each character in the first book I didn't feel like it was enough for me, if that is a trend that continues then I don't think I will like it.  Thanks"
Malazan,2t4ank,Kwa4250,4,Wed Jan 21 03:39:51 2015 UTC,"My list was mostly based on characters I really liked like Whiskey, Paran, Kruppe, Rake, Bridge Burners but also ones who I found intriguing. So Toc being brief didnt take away from my liking him as a character.   Eventually there are more solidified POVs which stretch throughout. (Though I'd day there are a few main POVs in GotM). It settles down quite a bit around book three. However there is going to many more characters and switching to new POVs then you're used to. However over the course of the books there are probably like six main ones and 6-10 semi main ones. There are always lots of small character POVs who often shed light on other characters including the more central characters. Some characters who don't seem to be main POVs become main. The series has an overarching plot and subplots which develop the characters and the world.   With Shallan I originally hated when it switched to her POV. Also I was thinking and Kaladin can be viewed as a character whose rise and circumstances are... lucky but Sanderson inserts a logical reason for this later on. Erikson does as well. Others do also like Jordan, Gemmel, LE Modesitt, etc. I always hated when books didn't at least give a reason for a characters coincidences.   Is your name from WoT? If so I am struggling to read that series and am doing what I said for you to maybe try (if you decide to read Malazan) and am reading them sparingly and taking my time, I find Jordans page by page writing to be tedious at times and very cringe-worthy as well, though the overall lore and story is awesome.   So I don't really know what to say because many of Eriksons characters are among my all time favorites.  Some of Sandersons too. If you really dislike the POV switching then you probably will be disappointed at times but learn to enjoy the new ones and be very happy to see the old ones.   I'd say read the next and if it doesn't really click, fuck it, there's lots of great stuff to read."
Malazan,2t4ank,strawberrysundaeandt,2,Wed Jan 21 04:20:28 2015 UTC,"The first few books were gifted to me so I would almost feel guilty not reading them. But the first one kind of mad me angry with how much I held no interest in what was going on, which is normally not the case when I read series. I just couldn't make myself care about the events. Even with the idea that it all connects later there should have been something to connect on to make me excited for the second but there was no connection what so ever. I am going to try though.  Before Word's of Radiance, when I was doing my rereads of Way of the Kings I will admit that I skipped shallan, then after Words I went through a reread with shallan again and liked it more.  Yes, my username is a WoT reference, that series started amazingly for me, though Jordan writing of woman is very hit and miss and his descriptions are very repetitive. It does start to bog down in the middle but by that time I was invested enough to over come that. What book are you on? Matrim is my all time favorite character and he solely made some of those books exciting for me"
Malazan,2t4ank,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Wed Jan 21 05:46:50 2015 UTC,"I'd say just read them. Even if you just get through the gifted ones it won't be the biggest waste of time. Also no one can say, well you didn't read enough books so you don't know.   I'm on book five. They're the hardest books I've ever read because of the main POVs. For instance wool headed, braid tugging, two Rivers folk, skirt smoothing, etc all is super jarring to me. On top of that they're all sooooooo stupid/ignorant/arrogant and get captured every page or luck out every page. This applies heavily to Nyvane (spl)  and egwain, elayne, they're the worst. It would be one thing if they were just dumb but they allllways push it on people.   Matrim has always been pretty solid. However is distrust of everyone is a bit much. Rand is getting much much better. Perrins ok. I just tell myself that Jordan is trying his hardest to portray very ignorant people. I wish we got more POVs for Lan, Moraine, Thom.   I am going to finish the series if it kills me just because of its standing in the fantasy community. I just take breaks when it frustrates me. I get that they're learning but five books till they learn one ounce of wisdom is crazy."
Malazan,2t4ank,Tumblehawk,1 point,Wed Jan 21 18:16:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you certainly get tired of certain phrases, like stone-faced and as you mentioned wool headed, it is like he came up with 10 ways to describe something and just decided to stick with it every single time. Book 5 does start to wear but it has a real good ending IMO, matrim starts to really shine. But if you think book 5 is difficult to read, oh boy you are in for some real pain, but there should be enough good parts to keep you going hopefully."
Malazan,2t4ank,Tumblehawk,3,Wed Jan 21 18:36:34 2015 UTC,"Did you really care about characters like Rake, Cotillian, Dujek and Topper after reading GoTM though? These are all great characters, but the problem with GoTM is that it doesn't flesh out it's most interesting people. I didn't care about them because I didn't know anything about them after book one apart from the general ""Rake is a badass"" comments you'll get browsing review of the series."
Malazan,2t4ank,TriscuitCracker,2,Wed Jan 21 20:37:29 2015 UTC,"I tried to stress that the characters I listed were ones I cared about and also ones that I found very intriguing. So out of the ones you listed I cared about all of them somewhat except Topper. And the others were a mix of caring and intriguing. I cared about Rake based on his interactions characters I cared about, his air of mystery and unknown purpose was enjoyable. Kruppe was awesome. Lorn was also interesting. I didn't like Crokus much him and Tattersail were hit or miss and for me were the only characters who weren't as fleshed out as they needed to be based on their roles in the book. Quick and Kalam were good. Also the introduction to Tool was quite good, Toc was a great character.   I guess it just never occurred to me to know about so many characters so quickly.   Anyways that's rambly as can be. I will say that when book two switched from some of the characters I was loving in book one it was jarring. Though I grew to enjoy the characters in book two, it was a really strong book."
Malazan,2t4ank,Eltotsira,2,Wed Jan 21 21:19:25 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I just meant for the OP's sake we learn so much more about them. Even if he doesn't connect to Rake like I didn't in GoTM, they certainly get better and more in depth. The characters are developing all the way through TCG, and once the back stories come flooding in, the characters get better."
Malazan,2t4ank,AllWrong74,1 point,Thu Jan 22 03:11:52 2015 UTC,"I am glad someone was in the same boat. I wasn't looking for people that don't like the series, if I did I wouldn't come to the subreddit specifically for it, a part of what I was looking for was someone who felt that disconnect but overcame it and using that as encouragement to continue forward, so thanks. Others have also done a great job of letting me get out some of the bad feelings in order to focus on other qualities about the series."
Malazan,2t4ank,Eltotsira,6,Thu Jan 22 04:04:49 2015 UTC,"Your criticism of Gardens is spot on, and I can see how that could turn you off to the whole series.  I've read the series once, and just started my first re-read, so I'm experiencing these things all over again.    From what I've read Erikson say in interviews and my own interpretation of the Malazan books, his goal was to tell the story of a world, not to tell the story of any particular character or group of characters.  Rather than coming up with story and character arcs, he created a world, its history, and its events.  He then tells the story of participants in those events.  The ""what"" and the ""why"" of those events is more important than the subjective experiences of his characters.  I think of the Malazan series as being like history books set in fantasy worlds, rather than traditional, character-focused fantasy stories.    As a nerd who wants fantasy worlds to follow rules and make internal sense from a biological, anthropological, technological, economic, and political perspective, I loved these books.*  Also,as the series progresses, you get more involved in individual characters and their arcs, but the focus always seems to be on the world.  So, that may help allay some of your concerns, but likely won't make you love the series.  Ultimately, though, Erikson's style isn't for everyone, and I certainly wouldn't want every (or most?) series to emulate that style.  But, the books are fascinating, and I'd recommend sticking it out for a few more books.    *As an example, I hated how everyone spoke the same language in Wheel of Time."

I will try to recreate it as best I can but might end up being briefer than before  I tend to be very character oriented and enjoy internal monologues, it might be because of this I had the wrong mindset when approaching this book. I might use the characters too much of a crutch to connect to the world if that makes any sense and see the world as a backdrop. If I can approach it in a different manner then perhaps I can connect with it in a different way as you suggest  Thanks for your response."
Malazan,2t4ank,Bilbato,4,Thu Jan 22 03:47:47 2015 UTC,"You're going to run into other Shallan-type characters in the series. It takes time and lots of pages for them to develop into compelling characters. If Deadhouse Gates irritates you as much as GotM, I'd put the series down.  I made it through all of WoT but I'm glad I never have to read another line about the Sea Folk or how incompetent men are. I could handle the braid tugging though. :)"
Malazan,2t4ank,Foliagus,1 point,Wed Jan 21 12:22:05 2015 UTC,"It takes time and lots of pages for them to develop into compelling characters   That is part of what I meant about i felt there wasn't enough time spent on any one character, like there was no intent to develop a compelling character.    Everyone I knew flipped their shit when Ned Stark died, didn't matter if they read the books or just watched the show. He dies in book one.  Now that series is not necessarily one of my favorites, not saying it is bad by any means, but it goes to show how invested people were with the character before the first book even ended.  By the end of GotM any character could have died and it wouldn't have felt out of place or shocking or anything like that. It would have been like, oh Ok I guess this guy dies, and then continue reading.  That doesn't make this book bad, but it also doesn't help build my interest or excitement which resulted in me feeling a little let down by things, but others have giving me some hope and I will be pushing forward"
Malazan,2t4ank,TrevorAndCorey,4,Thu Jan 22 06:21:21 2015 UTC,"You have well thought out criticisms, thanks for taking the time to spell them out. I can agree that sometimes the character development, especially in the first book, can take a back seat to the plot and most of what you learn about any character is from how they interact with others without explaining their motivations internally and so it can be like, ""Oh, so now character A thinks this and character B thinks that and why? Because the plot calls for it.""   It gets better, he goes back to the POV of the main characters constantly and you learn more about them as the books progress, plus more of their internal thoughts and monologues, why they do what they do. There are literally hundreds of characters in this entire series, and I will admit, sometimes he will concentrate on a side character that you don't care as much about. On the flip side, there are instances where it only takes a few pages for you to love a new character you've never heard of for six books.  Eriksen tends to not do info dumps and is heavy on the introspective philosophy, you have to piece things together though context and clues and character conversations.  If I were you, since you seem to be a fast reader, read through Memories of Ice, book 3. Deadhouse Gates is very jarring when you first read it, as its on a whole new continent with new main characters and some returning others. It's a wonderful book though, written 9 years after Gardens of the Moon and it definitely shows Erikson improving his craft. In Memories of Ice, you head back to Genebackis and all the people from GotM return plus lots of new characters. It's widely considered in the top three books of the series, it's one of my favorites, and I hope you find it in yourself to at least get through it. Welcome to the sub!"
Malazan,2t4ank,TrevorAndCorey,6,Wed Jan 21 14:08:05 2015 UTC,"""most of what you learn about any character is from how they interact with others without explaining their motivations internally""  Perhaps this is what I like about Erikson. Nothing bothers me so much as when a writer tells me how a character feels. That's lazy writing. Showing it to me by way of interaction and decision-making is much stronger, much more effective. Someone with an amazing mind but totally weak in this way is China Mieville. He constructs incredible worlds and then just tells you, ""Isaac felt sad when he thought about that."" How...boring!"

It's bound to continue going up as long as GRRM continues to not write books in reasonable of time. His one sentence per month writing rate is really helping the Malazan universe grow as impatient people scramble for any other means of fantasy.

This thread from westeros.org which was probably the most informative of those. Like everywhere else I found they couldn't find a basis for the 20 million, and figured it was an erroneous input by tracing it back through some wiki history pages and multiple edits.  So most likely that's where the number comes from, as like you say it's a very high number in comparison. I'm surprised no one has removed it from that page by now.  I wouldn't be surprised if the number is closer to 2 million now though, it was 500 000 in 2008."

Malazan,2szpfk,Murse_Jon,10,Mon Jan 19 23:41:45 2015 UTC,"Just looking at the characters (I assume tBH is Bonehunters, but I'll spoil just in case):  Kalam is considered to be a badass by the Claw. He's an absolute monster, and shreds through them. The Bonehunters Spoiler  Temper was in Daseem Ultor's First Sword. As in, was a member of his personal bodyguard and retinue. Which meant he was a damn good fighter.  And finally, Daseem Ultor. The First Sword. No contest.  Additionally, the Claw are assassins. They're not supposed to do full-frontal assaults. They're supposed to be sneaky. If you fight them head-on, they're automatically weaker."
Malazan,2szpfk,KBKarma,2,Mon Jan 19 23:56:17 2015 UTC,Very good point about them being weaker head on. Didn't think about it like that. It just seems thy are put in when the stakes should be slightly higher than fighting a soldier or something
Malazan,2szpfk,KBKarma,6,Tue Jan 20 00:36:12 2015 UTC,"Thing is, they are very very good at what they do, which is murdering and ambushing. However, they don't quite focus on other stuff that soldiers would be good at. Like blocking. Or defending. Or large scale tactics. Or, y'know, bunking off and getting pissed. They're a bunch of one-man armies. Which means bugger all cohesion in the face of an overwhelming Kalam. I mean, force."

Malazan,2szpfk,MoranthMunitions,3,Tue Jan 20 00:58:55 2015 UTC,Also keep in mind that certain people begin ascendancy and are at various stages of power.   Also the claw was able to grievously would the first sword! Temper was ICEs best character.   Throughout the series we do meet some awesome individual claw members who are pretty bad ass and able to fight some of the best.   I'd give more example but I can never remember what would spoil what perfectly.
Malazan,2szpfk,Aiolus,4,Tue Jan 20 01:39:19 2015 UTC,"Temper was ICEs best character   I disagree, Principal Scribe Thorn was his best character imo. I thought Temper fell a bit flat as a character, probably because his writing didn't pick up until SW. I felt that in general NoK wasn't very fleshed out.  Pearl, Topper and Possum were all very effective as Claws. I can't think of any others besides RotCG/OST off the top of my head though."
Malazan,2szpfk,MoranthMunitions,1 point,Tue Jan 20 03:04:16 2015 UTC,Was Principal Scribe from Says which book he's in not really a spoiler if so he's a pretty good character and was actually entertaining. I really disliked ICEs work and didn't feel any of it was fleshed out well. The aforementioned book was least favorite. I haven't read Assail even though I got it awhile ago. I should read it though.  As for the claws those are the most effective ones but you missed NoK I think NoK but don't remember 100% its about the last spoiler but yea there aren't a ton of very powerful Claw assassins mentioned. I guess Spoilers All    Sorry for ramble not sure why I am trying to justify the number of powerful claws seen in the books :-D   Edit: Oh yea Temper is my favorite because I loved his back story and am a sucker for a grizzled veteran who still has the moves and is badass.
Malazan,2szpfk,Landmarkmoon,3,Tue Jan 20 04:05:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's the one, he's the only character that actually came off as humorous to me, though I'm sure some others were supposed to. On the one you disliked,, but I felt it was much better written than the earlier ones. Assail wasn't too bad really, there was one thing which I vehemently disliked with the plot, but on the whole it was a solid enough book in itself.  OST was the only one I actually disliked, the others had redeeming features. The differences between his and Erikson's stuff was more obvious and jarring when the same setting and characters were used.  I didn't count Laseen because I figured it went without saying - though she's not very active in the books she's got a solid reputation which she's had to back up ""off screen"".  I'll concede that Temper's back story was good. I should probably reread NoK because there were parts I enjoyed, I might have a more moderate opinion if I read it again too and even if not it'll only take a few hours."

Malazan,2szpfk,tripod-pop,2,Fri Jan 30 00:13:13 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that it is the named characters in this series that are generally badasses. The regulars and un-named characters are quite often lackluster.

There are some super fights id love to see..Kalam vs Trull...Laseen vs Kalam..Urko vs Karsa again and for keeps..Icarium vs Cotillion..Rake vs Icarium. Am I missing any really good ones?

You'll figure out what's happening with the writing style not long before the convergence at the end of the novel, if I recall correctly. Until then, just enjoy it.

It blew my mind. And Kruppe being one of my favourite characters and Darujhistan my favourite place in the Malazan world I loved it with passion.   Yes, it's Kruppe's voice, telling the story, as is implied in the prologue, to Krull and Fisher around the fireplace.   I don't know if it had to do with what Erikson was dealing with in the time period he wrote the book but for me it felt more personal and intimate than other books.  Enjoy it, man.

Malazan,2syaxs,DrinkyDrank,7,Mon Jan 19 17:29:56 2015 UTC,"The flooding of Raraku and Meal aren't linked. It all goes back to the Bridgeburners, if I remember correctly.  Back in Deadhouse Gates, Fiddler was touched on the shoulder by a Tanno SpiritWalker (I think that's the term), who enchanted him and the Bridgeburners as a whole. Or at least, more specifically, he enchanted Fiddler's music.  The key point is that the Bridgeburners were ""created"" in Raraku. At the end of Memories of Ice, nearly all of them had died. However, if one of them were to return to Raraku, the Tanno magic would activate. During the course of House of Chains, you hear Fiddler complain about ""that damn music"" as they get closer to Raraku. Even Kalam mentions it once he enters the desert.  Essentially, Fiddler (or maybe Kalam triggered it - not sure) returns to Raraku, the magic activates, and all of the Bridgeburner spirits come back to life (as ghost/projections, so to speak). This is what ultimately ends up killing the vast majority of Sha'ik's forces.  Another component is that Raraku is a warran in itself (a piece of Shadow, if I'm remembering this correctly) that the Goddess was trying to take over. With the return of the Bridgeburners (and most likely over events that happen during the climax of House of Chain), Raraku awakens, floods, and returns to how it was in the past.  I'm pretty sure that's the gist of what happens. Meal was no involvement to Raraku."
Malazan,2syaxs,Therrester,1 point,Mon Jan 19 20:37:34 2015 UTC,"I understand the bit about the bridgeburners and the tanno magic, it's the bit about Raraku itself ""remembering"" that it was a sea and re-flooding that seems strange to me.  I also know that Raraku is actually a fragment of Kurald Emuhrlan, which is why I thought there was some connection with the Tiste Edur and the events of Midnight Tides.  I thought I remembered Rhulad or some other character talk about flooding warrens or something.  There was also the part in Deadhouse Gates where Felisin and Heboric traverse a flooded warren on a boat that is filled with dead Tiste Edur...but I can't remember which warren, and I'm not sure if this has any connection to Raraku flooding."
Malazan,2syaxs,Therrester,2,Mon Jan 19 21:41:02 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the warran they end up flooding is a separate part of Kurald Emuhrlan, which at some point is called The Nascent. It's the same warran that they end up chaining Trull in, and that's separate from the Raraku warran.  What you're referring too is the hidden plot of the Silanda and the flooding of The Nascent. By Bonehunters, all of the pieces of it, save one or two, should be known to you, but I'll explain it in a spoiler below anyway. I'll split it between the pieces you've read (but maybe haven't pieced together), and what hasn't been revealed to you yet. You don't have to read it, on the off chance you haven't pieced all the pieces together. But that's up to you.  Silanda spoiler  Silanda Spoilers from Bonehunters onwards  Regardless of whether you choose to read the spoilers or not, there's no direct mention of Edur involvement with the rebirth of Raraku. The flooding of The Nascent and the Silanda are entirely seperate events all together.  I understand that this doesn't really answer your question about Raraku's rebirth. I always chalked it to the tanno magic. His spell caused all the ghosts of Raraku to come back to life. But, this also included the ghost of Raraku itself (the desert was always talked about as being its own entity). By bringing the ghost of Raraku back to life, it flooded and became a sea once more."
Malazan,2syaxs,abacabbx,1 point,Mon Jan 19 22:13:18 2015 UTC,"It's not really connected but that's a good eye my man.   The flooded realm is the nascent, another fragment of shadow. I believe rhulad flooded the nascent to gain allies in the demons, or he took water fork. The nascent to flood another fragment. To be honest it starts to get a little complicated with so many fragments of the shadow realm."
Malazan,2syaxs,Aiolus,1 point,Mon Jan 19 22:13:51 2015 UTC,"It's been awhile for me. I believe at the time of the flooding the desert ""remembers"" that it used to be a sea. I think it was altered and when the chains were broken the spirit of the land remembered and returned it to a sea."
Malazan,2syaxs,montaron87td,0,Mon Jan 19 18:05:14 2015 UTC,I thought this was connected to the part of Kurald Emuhrlan that was flooded by Rhulad (The Nascent). I always thought that warren basically emptied into Raraku.

So I stopped, took a step back and thought. The title of the series, does it refer to: The malazan's accounts and their fallen people during the conflicts? The Malazan accounts OF the fallen god Kaminsod, or the book written by the fallen god about the Malazan soldiers who laid down their lives for him.  The ingenuity of that really hit me in that moment, as well as Kaminsod seeing that people are willing to show compassion and understanding even after all the suffering he wrought upon them. That there are those who understood he was the victim, that they sympathized with him in such a way that would truly help without bringing more suffering onto other societies of the world. That there was a better example, of virtue in the goddamn hellhole of that world.  That, had me breathless. Sympathy for the Devil indeed.  I can probably go on all night about the many bits and lines that bring out reason and thought as I read.  Also naturally the last words of the book Remember us."
Malazan,2swm6s,mmSNAKE,3,Mon Jan 19 05:44:39 2015 UTC,I had the exact same thought during that section and I remember thinking back throughout the whole series and reimagining it as an account being written by the Crippled God. It really put things into a different perspective and I think that's just one area that showcases the subtle nature of Erikson's genius.
Malazan,2swm6s,mmSNAKE,4,Mon Jan 19 06:09:59 2015 UTC,"It's the sort of thing you can only discuss when people finish the books. It is difficult to illustrate the scope and reach of the story Erikson wrote without that tidbit. All of a sudden the entire series gets turned on it's head. Most stuff that happened, had many meanings, most of which are made clear with the final volume. It was pretty crazy, consider just how much he put in during these books. Hell even in Gardens of the Moon, where Kaminsod was only mentioned in a off reference passing."
Malazan,2swm6s,Aiolus,3,Mon Jan 19 06:23:15 2015 UTC,"I'm already considering a re-read and I have no doubt in addition to more things being made clear, I'll view events in an entirely different light."
Malazan,2swm6s,imprettycoolright,9,Mon Jan 19 06:26:31 2015 UTC,"Those are some incredible moments. A few of my favorites are,   -Kruppe he's my favorite and his underlying absurdity and compassion,   -Tehol breaking the mold of greed with a similar absurd compassion,   -""I lost her"" /sob,   -when Karlot(spl) is holding Whiskey Jacks stone and the bridge burners are ready to kill her if she tossed it aside; “And you, my dear lover, thief of all my thoughts, will you ever release me? Please. Do not. Ever.”  Anomander Rake and his dedication, planning and sacrifice.   Crokus for being my least favorite character.   The journey of characters like Trull, Karsa, Tool, and Onrack. As well as ones like Rhulad.   The super tragedy of Felisin :(  And finally cause I've typed enough. The Bridge Burners / Malazan Marines they had so many awesome characters and powerful moments. It was awesome to get so many POVs.   FoD is pretty great. ICE is at best meh but it's canon so it's kinda worth reading. If you ever do a reread of MBotF it's really good the second time around."
Malazan,2swm6s,Aiolus,3,Mon Jan 19 07:34:32 2015 UTC,Can I ask why Crokus was your least favorite character?
Malazan,2swm6s,imprettycoolright,9,Mon Jan 19 08:08:25 2015 UTC,"I typically don't like the generic young person thrust into the world who surprises everyone. For me he had little to no depth and any that he did have was typically based on whining. Crokus is probably a decent representation of a man who is a burglar for fun and someone who lacks perspective/wisdom.   I found the contrast between him and Paran to be striking from the beginning. Paran had a certain nobility, steadfastness, and wisdom which Crokus just never had till way later in the series if at all. I would prefer to meet almost all the good guy tertiary characters  over him.   I should have said he's my least favorite good guy."
Malazan,2swm6s,titanemesis,6,Mon Jan 19 08:28:45 2015 UTC,"Completely understandable.  I thought it was a bit silly when he came back to Darujistan and started acting like he was some dark tortured soul because he was an assassin, and I hardly remembered him actually assassinating anybody."
Malazan,2swm6s,TriscuitCracker,6,Mon Jan 19 08:42:17 2015 UTC,"By the time he returned, he's seen some pretty harrowing stuff no?  Didn't he participate in the defense of Drift Avalii?  I mean, I get what you're saying - it's not like dudebro stood the stormwall or anything, so what's up with all the excessive angst? - but he was certainly less naive than he was before he set out."
Malazan,2swm6s,Jack-Shepherd,7,Mon Jan 19 18:35:26 2015 UTC,"Spoilers below...  Fiddlers reading with every major player, just so tense!   Beaks death, Whiskeyjacks death, Murillo's death, Hood's death.  Hood's arrival in Darujestan.   ""I have had enough of your JUSTICE!""  Tehol, Bugg, Pust and Kruppe, for making me laugh the whole way.  Karsa's journey from stereotype to badass.  Quick Ben and Kalam in the realm of Shadow spying on all the skykeeps.  Quick Ben vs Bauchlin and Korbal Broach.   Brys slicing up Rhulad.  Rhulad's first anguished scream with the coins and he realizes his fate.  Trull's death and the part where he's staggering through the snow and he hallucinates his family.  First time Dragnipur is used plus Ganos realizing what happens when you get killed by it blew my mind.  The first quarter of Bonehunters. Never felt so hot and claustrophic in my life.   Icariun's sad realizations of what he's done, his rage in Midnight Tides, and Mappo just trying so desperately to get back to his friend.   Cotillion's love for humanity.  Shadowthrones nutty genius.   Loved Stormy and Gessler.   The sappers chatter, the group at Krul's bar, the marines in the trenches, just loved all the military camaraderie. Nefarious Bred of course.   Helan's hobbling. Ugh.  The friendship between Trull and Onrak.  The awesomeness of the T'Lan Imass in general.   Jaghut wit.  Itvokian's death, his taking of the guilt of the Imass, the Children of the dead seed storming Capustan.  Poor, poor Toc. The character who just never catches a freaking break.   Mule battle!  Kalam'a badassery in Bonehunters.  I always loved the relationship between Pearl and Lostara. I was sad to see Pearl go.   Heboric's trippy trip with the jade Giants.  The sadness of the Otaral Dragon's life.  The KChain Chemalle are just awesome to me in general.   ""I lost her!""  The opening of Memories of Ice where you realize the scale of the Crippled God's fall, Kallors madness, and the consequences that reverberate through the entire series.  The defending of the city of Karkastsn against the Light is amazing.   ""Remember us."" When I finished the series for the first time, I read that ending slowly, reverently, and outloud.   You're cheating yourself if you don't do a re-read eventually. It's like a whole new series, you miss so much foreshadowing and connections on your first read. FoD is a must read and the Esselmont books are good but not great, but good for the back story."

For the sake of brevity I'm only going to include things not mentioned already.   The symmetry of WhishkeyJack telling young Ganoes not to be a soldier; Fiddler retiring and talking to youth.   Ganoes taunting Forkrul  Kalam fighting through the Claw. So awesome to see his brute strength in action.  The Heavies hold against K'Chain ""good god they held"". Also Lostara Yil's shadowdance and Quick Ben vs K'chain throwing fire. The entire battle with the K'Chain vs Bonehunters was amazing.  Raest and Kitty  The Seguleh punitive army traveling with Lady Envy and Onos. Sending three people as a punitive ""army"".   The stare down between Kruppe & Iskaral   Karsa not knowing what to say to his daughters. He always had an answer for everything, was finally speechless & afraid. Full circle moment.   The new Letheri flag (bedsheets and chickens)  Bugg's cooking (rag soup, ""it must have touched food once"")  Draconus' arrival destroying two armies. The sheer power of his arrival was stunning.   ""Our stands"" can't recall who exactly, but remembering their childhood play fighting last stands.  Gruntle piling up bodies until building collapses  Gesler and Stormy last battle; last moments together  Y'dan Derrig with the Hust sword; throwing back the head  Crokus avenging Murillio  The knowing tap, tap, tap, of Shadowthrone's cane,   Cotillion (the Rope) fighting on Drift Avali  Brys watching Malazan sergeants marching the letheri troops in awe. Sargeants having no idea what to do  Chain of Dogs: Coltaine's last stand; breaking Gelser's (or Stormy's?) nose; sappers ""what does a turtle do in winter"" and blowing up the river  Lieutenant/StaffSeargeant/QuarterMaster Pores' accumulation of titles"
Malazan,2swm6s,CotillionTheRope,2,Wed Jan 21 18:48:21 2015 UTC,"So many things in this series that just blew me away.  I'm on a reread (well listen, got the audio books) and they still hit me...damn chain of dogs, thought knowing would make it easier."
Malazan,2swm6s,ghoulbuns,2,Mon Jan 19 22:13:41 2015 UTC,"In addition to what others have said, I'll add:   Trull's death hit me really hard, and is one of the sections that I read the most. The marines conquest of Lether in Reaper's Gale. It really gave me an understanding of how badass they really were. Kalam murdering some claw, and Apsalar's shadow dance in Bonehunters (I think?)"
Malazan,2sui73,Mryappy,32,Sun Jan 18 17:54:05 2015 UTC,"I love your style and how your putting good artwork out there for the Malazan series. But I just can't get behind the boob plates. I'm sure im in the minority, but they just irk me. Why can't women get drawn in proper armor?"
Malazan,2sui73,Sacripain,23,Sun Jan 18 19:00:16 2015 UTC,"Especially for Tavore of all people.  Even if one of the many fantasy elements of the Malazan world is that boob plates make sense, I still feel that Tavore wouldn't wear them."
Malazan,2sui73,TheBionicBosom,13,Sun Jan 18 20:02:15 2015 UTC,"Echoing this. I love your style. But, when I think of Tavore I remember her being described as sharp and angular. She seems a little too...busty...in this one to match that description."
Malazan,2sui73,BorealHound,11,Sun Jan 18 21:51:04 2015 UTC,"She's described as being rather buxom, actually. Breasts slightly larger than her frame, curved. Somebody can find the passage, I'm sure.  In armor, I'm not sure you'd notice."
Malazan,2sui73,Foliagus,2,Mon Jan 19 00:01:12 2015 UTC,"Huh, guess I missed that. Maybe I just superimposed her personality on her figure..."
Malazan,2sui73,BorealHound,1 point,Mon Jan 19 03:57:50 2015 UTC,"you surely did, she's said a few times from male character's POV to be rather hot under all the sterness and delibarate attempt at boyishness."

Malazan,2sui73,Foliagus,3,Wed Jan 21 20:27:59 2015 UTC,The guy definitely likes to draw busty women and huge muscular men.
Malazan,2sui73,SamTremblay,3,Mon Jan 19 00:04:17 2015 UTC,"To be honest, when I read Malazan I was wondered how many heavy breasted or even chubby and fat female characters in this series. While the mostly men were tall and muscular."
Malazan,2sui73,Desolaice,3,Mon Jan 19 01:01:07 2015 UTC,Isn't it obvious that those are the kinds of girls he likes?
Malazan,2sui73,herffjones99,3,Mon Jan 19 01:17:50 2015 UTC,Guilty as charged
Malazan,2sui73,Bilbato,5,Mon Jan 19 04:31:08 2015 UTC,"Its better then some of the other female characters he has drawn. See Korlat, Silverfox, and Hetan.  Because someone felt the need to downvote me, here are the even worse offenses of the boob/bikini armor.  http://yapattack.deviantart.com/art/Korlat-Second-to-Anomander-Rake-502129921  http://yapattack.deviantart.com/art/Hetan-Taur-493941864  http://yapattack.deviantart.com/art/Silverfox-The-Miracle-490249325"
Malazan,2sui73,SamTremblay,5,Sun Jan 18 20:00:10 2015 UTC,"I've seen you comment on his other women's drawings and just want you to know I feel the same way as you do. Even though he edited them, he completly missed the point of what was (and still is) wrong. I feel that the Malazan series has one of the best representation of women in fantasy and those drawings couldn't be further from Erikson's and Esselmont's representations and characterizations."
Malazan,2sui73,SamTremblay,4,Mon Jan 19 00:01:07 2015 UTC,"If I can make a slight rebuttal... (and remember that in the end, my best interest is in accurately portraying these characters) but could you elaborate on the ""best representation of women in fantasy thing?"" Correct me if I'm wrong, but almost all of the females up until HOC have been either strikingly beautiful or plain faced with voluptuous bodies.   -Korlat is described as a bombshell. I made the decision to give her less that natural armor because she's a god damn Dragon Soletaken! At the end of the day I dont think she'll find herself in a situation where she'll need a full set of heavy armor.  -Hetan is a straight up sex addict, and considering Barghasts are basically Natives I don't think that my ""bikini armor"" representation is that far off the mark.  -Silverfox is described as a generously proportioned. Erikson makes constant quasi-sexual references to her body throughout and considering the Rhivi are tribes people, I'm pretty sure a full set of clothes doesn't make much sense.  Have you ever read The Name of The Wind or Game of Thrones books? I'm pretty sure they both have more accurate representations of real world females than Malazan. Again, I absolutely love the Malazan series so far and am in no way comparing these great series. I simply want to know why you're so riled up by my representations?"
Malazan,2sui73,Bilbato,3,Mon Jan 19 14:50:46 2015 UTC,"By ""representation"", I mean the full character, not just their looks. They are realistic and not defined by their gender. Half the time, you can't know the gender of a character until it is explicited (take Blend, Picker or half of the Bonehunters' heavies for exemple). George Martin also has a good characterization of women, but in my opinion Erikson's is better, more diverse.  -Women can be bombshell without having gigantic breast.  -Women can like sex a lot and still be fully clothed while taking part in a military campaign. I won't even talk about your argument of ""Natives=bikini armor"".  -Tattersail (and Silverfox) are described as curvy, I give you that. But how can you think that tribal and pastoral cultures wear less clothes ?? It's absurd. They literally live outdoor. I guess it explains why you'd draw Icarium and Mappo shirtless while they travel in a desert."
Malazan,2sui73,SamTremblay,3,Mon Jan 19 16:42:30 2015 UTC,Great points here. No need to get all defensive on me though haha. Keep in mind that we're talking about fan art for a fantasy book. Everyone's depiction will be different.
Malazan,2sui73,Bilbato,2,Mon Jan 19 18:57:57 2015 UTC,He edited them? I can see no difference with any of those since OP had made the thread with all of his pictures in them.  It's hard enough getting people to take Fantasy as serious literature. And pictures like this just give fuel to feminists and others that want to downplay the depth that Fantasy can possess and to say that its just a bunch of men that don't like women and want to keep women oppressed. Why give them added fuel for their argument?
Malazan,2sui73,SamTremblay,3,Mon Jan 19 00:12:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, he added chainmail and bracers, but he did not change the bodies in his drawings.  I don't get why you bash feminism here ? The Malazan book of the Fallen is feminist in its depiction of women. Even your own arguments about those drawings are feminists."
Malazan,2sui73,Sacripain,1 point,Mon Jan 19 01:13:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not bashing feminism, I am saying that feminists will see that kind of thing and use it as a justification to attack the series, to say that its just another man fantasy that downplays women, that it is misogynistic. When as we both know that is not true at all.  So they will google the series to learn more about it, see these pictures, and instantly judge the series because of those pictures. And I prefer to not have these kinds of images associated with this series so that people aren't making those sorts of judgements about the series without having read it."
Malazan,2sui73,Sacripain,1 point,Mon Jan 19 17:38:19 2015 UTC,"I know, I know. The generalization about feminists (all the people I know who read this serie self-identify as feminists) just irked me. Your critique of MrYappy's drawings is nice, but your motivation to do so seems to be based on some imaginary scenario that won't happen. If someone wanted to bash fantasy for its representation of women, this serie is one of the last places to look and some fanarts won't change that."
Malazan,2sui73,strawberrysundaeandt,2,Mon Jan 19 18:05:47 2015 UTC,"I completely understand. Tbh I spent half an hour researching female armor for this particular piece, but the thing is 1. I couldn't find many good historical references for female armor (especially Roman-esque armor, which I've been basing my Malazan army builds off) and 2. The few pieces I did find hid the chest region completely, and I risked Tavore looking like a straight up dude..."
Malazan,2sui73,AnasterToc,10,Mon Jan 19 04:30:06 2015 UTC,"Now, im no expert, but maybe part of the reason you had so much trouble when looking for ""female armor"" is because armor isn't made any different depending on the gender of the wearer? Practicality takes precedence over anything else. The form and function of the armor is designed for maximum protection. So its kind of a side effect that women in armor do look like men. They are warriors first."
Malazan,2sui73,Fnarley,2,Mon Jan 19 04:43:47 2015 UTC,Any thoughts on the new chest region? I got rid of the boob plates but don't know what else to change.
Malazan,2sui73,Sopp90,1 point,Mon Jan 19 20:05:23 2015 UTC,"It looks a lot better! Its awesome that you take feedback and stuff. Its still kind of a boob plate though. The reason I say that, is that the breast plate is shaped around her boobs. It curves under them. While this gives them definition for the viewer, it gives an odd image of the actual armor. Its as if there is an angle of metal that presses against her ribs under her breasts. Any impact to her chest would then focus in on that angle, and be incredibly painful in a fight. Unless the breastplate is ending after her boobs, and its chain mail underneath? Then the armor is rather confusing to me. Still. There is no one putting out Malazan artwork like you are. To get too caught up on stuff like this is kind of silly. Lots of fantasy artwork does this with female armor. Its nitpicky for me to get this anal about it, but hey. That's reddit, right?"
Malazan,2sui73,HumbleAsFudge,2,Tue Jan 20 00:50:25 2015 UTC,"haha I totally understand, no worries. I'll definitely try to take what you said to heart in my later pics tho!"

Malazan,2sui73,TriscuitCracker,5,Mon Jan 19 04:32:35 2015 UTC,"My 2 cents:  The thing that jumped out the most at me (which probably means you depicted Tavore rather well) was the hilt of her sword. I don't remember an exact description of her sword (or even if this is her otataral sword pictured?) but I didn't think of it as a fancy dueling sword with full cover hand guard for the grip. I felt her sword would go very much in line with her physique and persona, being relatively plain, a rank and file hand and a half sword.  Also, that hilt on any sword would be hella thin haha. That's thinner than the tennis racket I first started playing on when I was 12.  On the personal detail side I think you did quite a good job, keeping the face distinct but at the same time (again) that plain factor, with a good dose of distance."
Malazan,2sui73,bantuftw,1 point,Mon Jan 19 05:54:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm pretty sure the adjunct's ottaral sword is a big one 2h or hand and a half sword, not a duelist rapier"

Its the Seven Cities plot is no more of a side story to the genebackis plot than vice versa. You'll go back and forth to both and see how they're both just as important. And they aren't the only two you'll see. Anyway:    Gods are ascendants with worshippers. Being a mage expands your lifespan naturally. That's why Tattersail is 200. Icarium is so old partly because of his species, and partly because of the unique magical stuff going on with him. Normal humans have normal life spans. Honestly don't remember. Anyone know this one?   Also you definitely met Caladan Brood in GotM."
Malazan,2stb4i,SageOfTheWise,3,Sun Jan 18 08:00:49 2015 UTC,"2. Also being an ascendant makes for effective immortality too, which would count for Icarium.  3. Unfortunately the reason was pretty much ""love"", which is a bit weak compared to most characters' motivations. There's little to Minala in DG, her old husband was a colonel that got killed in the uprising - which a fair few people thought Laseen was responsible for, cause she kind of let it happen - but he used to abuse her and she likes her family. That's pretty much everything to her, but I don't think any of that factored into it.  Brood was only in like 1 scene in GotM though, that bit where he talked with Crone and sent out some Crimson Guard members to Darujhistan. It's pretty easy to forget about."

You would be correct about it can be hard for important characters to die, however, a very important thing to remember is NOBODY is immune to death, even if they are ascendants or gods, or Elders.   That finger statue of Heboric's most definitely comes to play later. Read on!   Ascendant is a general term for a powerful beings that can do whatever the heck they want, with power levels varying, gods are ascendants with worshippers. A big theme of Malazan is what do gods owe their worshipers, if anything? What do worshippers owe their gods?  What if worshippers misinterrpret what their god is saying and do crazy things in the gods name that the god doesn't want, does the god owe them anything?  Like others have said mages have naturally expanded lifespans and ascendants age very slowly.   I don't recall Minala's motivations...but honestly, she's not that an important character.  Soletaken are minor ascendants who have the power of shapeshifting.  Soletaken can take one form. D'ivers are minor Ascdendants who can take the form of multiple animals at once, like a mob of kangaroos or a murder of crows or a pack of wolves.  Has to be the same animal however. A few Ascendants like Anomander Rake also have Soletaken powers in addition to any powers their ascendancy gives them.  Judging by your comments, you're going to abosolutely love Memories of Ice. It's many peoples top 3 books of the series, I know it's what cemented Malazan as something to be treasured forever. Glad your liking them so far!  After that it's back to Seven Cities with House of Chains, and then with Midnight Tides...some place entirely new....mwahahaha."
Malazan,2stb4i,TriscuitCracker,2,Sun Jan 18 16:11:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Bill and Amanda pick up on a lot of things in the reread.  Sometimes they are things that are normally noticed when rereading that help piece the plot together a bit better once you already know what happens.  And sometimes it means figuring things out before they are explicitly spelled out.  If you don't want to refer to them now, that's ok.  If When you want to reread the series, they are great.  Erikson uses a lot of military jargon.  I've found it's nice to swap to a dictionary when reading the ebook versions.  Pretty sure a ""charge"" is when one army runs directly at the other army.  He also uses ""enfilade"" and ""defilade"" quite a lot to describe the battle formations, so it's useful to know about those terms.  On question 3 - Minala has the hots for Kalam, plus he saved her family.  Add his reputation as a Bridgeburner, and she must have decided to trust him."
Malazan,2stb4i,compiling,2,Sun Jan 18 08:27:58 2015 UTC,"Gods have worshipers, ascendants don't.  With magic you can heal yourself, and generally you age slower.  Really can't help with this, haven't read DG in a while.  Soletaken can change into one form, D'ivers into multiple forms. Soletaken are generally more sane than their multi-formed cousins. As far as I know, any race can be either a Soletaken or a Di'vers but the way they become shapeshifters gets covered later on. And yes, Soletaken and Di'vers can only have one form and as far as I know it can't be changed."
Malazan,2srdb2,squarecake,8,Sat Jan 17 19:45:15 2015 UTC,"Stuff you know:  1) It's not exactly accurate to call Azath ""beings.""  Throughout the series it is unclear about how sentient the Azath are, although on some level they seem to have a will of their own.  But they ain't gonna be sitting anyone down for a chit chat or something like that.    2) Yes, to Nameless ones role.  Kellanved and Dancer had a thing against all cults so yeah.  3) Yup  4)Yes.  5) Yes  Questions  1) Not sure about the role Apslar's father had, but Apsalar didn't create the ruse. I was under the impression that Pust DID do it himself, at Shadowthorne's direction. Unless I am misunderstanding the question.  2) Because the Azath like to take powerful dangerous beings, which D'ivers and Soletaken are.  Sending them there means they can be captured and removed from the world.  3) To your first two questions: Yes. Or No.  Shadowthorne's motives are a mystery throughout the series to even his friends. To the third, it's probably because Shadowthorne prefers to work behind the scenes.    4) Icarium was drawn to Tremorlor because it was time aspected, and thus drew him in his search for his memories.  5) Shadowthorne made what he thought was a ""deal"" to protect the house from the possibility of Icarium going berserk and destroying it, as well as all the Soletaken and D'ivers swarming around. The terms were that he would help by lending the Hounds to fight, and the House would refrain from trying to capture the hounds.  As Pust says, Shadowthorne took from his feeling of silence that it was assent.  As I mentioned earlier, Azath don't really ""chat"".    6) This one is a Read and Find out, I would say.  7) Definitely not Ascendancy, definitely his memories.  8) This one is a little fuzzy, sorry.  9) I don't think when they made the plan they knew that the shapeshifters were all going to go to war.  10) Icarium and Mappo are wanderers, and at the beginning of the book are surprised when D'ivers attack them.  Fiddler and gang didn't really have a choice, they were just there when everything went to hell.  Which warren did you mean? The Divers and Soletaken are flitting in and out of the physical place of the Desert Raraku, and the warren of Tellann.  I don't recall either party entering the Tellann warren?"
Malazan,2srdb2,PhilosopherIshamael,1 point,Sat Jan 17 20:40:04 2015 UTC,"By ""warren"" I mean whatever place contained the big tree root maze that they go through to get to the house. Iskaral talks about how it's a ""fragment of warren"" or something like that. At this point there hasn't been much info on what constitutes the Azath and what is just the place the Azath inhabits. But thank you though. Those explanations make me feel like I have a decent grasp of what's happening."
Malazan,2srdb2,SageOfTheWise,3,Sat Jan 17 21:37:34 2015 UTC,"What role did Apsalar and her father have in creating the Path of Hands ruse and why couldn’t Iskaral Pust do it himself?   Someone may have to remind me if I've just forgotten stuff, but I don't think they did? I mean her father was working as Iskaral Pust's servant awhile so maybe he helped, because why not use a servant if you have one. But that's all that comes to mind.   Why divert the D’ivers and Soletaken to Tremorlor?   So the Azath will eat them.   Is there any particular reason that Mappo and Icarium even got involved with Fiddler and Apsalar and this Tremorlor nonsense other than “Well, we might as well help these guys out.""   Mappo was supposed to guide Icarium to the azath so it would capture him and then no one would have to worry about him anymore. He couldn't go through with it though because he's grown to care about Icarium too much. In Icarium's mind I think he just thought they were being helpful, because that's just the kind of guy he is.   In the Tremorlor sequence, Iskaral Pust talks a lot about some sort of “deal” that was made involving Shadowthrone, Icarium, and Tremorlor, but I had no idea what that was or what the terms were.   It's about what I said above about trapping Icarium.   Did Shadowthrone send Hounds to save Iskaral and Apsalar? Or to save Tremorlor? Why couldn't Shadowthrone just teleport everyone out of there the way he does at the end of the book?   Cause of that plan talked about above.   If Icarium is so dangerous, why didn’t the Nameless Ones just kill him? Is it possible to kill him? Why did all the previous guardians fail? Why would the Nameless Ones have to fake a massacre when Icarium actually does massacre people?   Is it possible to kill him? Great question. No one has managed it so far. Simply put, they can't kill him. If they found a way they would probably do it... if they didn't decide to keep him around as a possible weapon or something. Previous guardians all eventually die one way or another. Old age, combat, Icarium hulks out and kills them, I think there's mention of some taking their own life, etc. They made their own massacre because then they'd be in control of it. Can't control Icarium. This way the destruction can't get out of hand, they can craft the scenario so they can have the guardian of their choice with the proper motivation. Easier then just crossing your fingers and hoping it just all happens right with Icarium.   Why would Fiddler and the gang want to bother with such an insanely dangerous method of getting to Quon Tali? Why not just stick with Kalam and go overland / by sea and then split up once they get to Quon Tali?   Because they needed an insane way to get in that would never be detected. The goal of the group was to assassinate Laseen. Crokus and Apsalar were just an unknowing cover story. If they went any kind of normal way Laseen's agents would find them. Case in point, Kalam gets all screwed up in the Book of the Apocalypse business, and ends up taking a normal route, and he is found really early on and his plan doesn't end up working. He only gets out of the whole thing because he's Kalam."
Malazan,2srdb2,Thomo87,1 point,Sat Jan 17 20:51:22 2015 UTC,"When the party meets up with Apsalar's father he talks about how he had to finish off the ruse for Iskaral as a way of paying his debt to House Shadow. Reading back over that part again, it sounds like maybe he and Apsalar acted as bait to draw everyone into the Azath, but I'm not certain."
Malazan,2srdb2,bantuftw,1 point,Sat Jan 17 21:42:39 2015 UTC,"Bear in mind, I haven't read the series for a year or so, but I think this how it went down.  Apsalar's dad was acting as a servant to pust, as a way to pay back the debt of the arm shadowthrone gave him and helped to write out the path. He was then sent to out to Tremolor and the information that he was Apsalar's father was leaked to her. She went after him, drawing the rest of them with in an attempt to drag Icarium into the house. That was shadowthrone's plan.   Fiddler and the rest knew they could use the house to get to the deadhouse in Malaz because quick Ben told them so. They never intended to use the house except in the direst circumstances. When they went to help apsalar and were led to it, they figured hey, why not use it while we're here. Icarium and Mappo went with because they're nice guys.  Fiddler and the rest were led to believe by Pust that Apsalar was actually going into the desert to become the next Shiak, and they wanted to stop that.  With regards to Tremorlor and Icarium, I can't recall how much you know about it yet, but it's very heavily linked with Icarium's past."

Also, if he's really gone all that way to kill her, why does he seem to believe what she tells him so easily?"

Malazan,2sr3em,xavierhaz,15,Sat Jan 17 18:19:32 2015 UTC,There's been more than one chaining. The CG is ever working towards his freedom. The last chaining wasn't so long ago. Add to this that dancer and kelenved (and most of the old guard) have extended life due to magics and their time in the azath house.
Malazan,2sr3em,i_am_not_you_or_me,12,Sat Jan 17 18:54:42 2015 UTC,"The last chaining was also when Hood and Dassem had their falling out, which narrows it down even more on the timeline."

Malazan,2sq6q5,RonSnooder,5,Sat Jan 17 11:52:07 2015 UTC,"Think of the warrens as corresponding to ""elements"" or ""schools"" from other systems. It is difficult for someone to pickup more than one if they can master one at all. But no, multiple individuals, especially if casters of the same race will have access to a specific warren."
Malazan,2sq6q5,Laschoni,2,Sat Jan 17 13:22:41 2015 UTC,"Magic-user title are used interchangeably. You'll find out in later books that the Malazan Imperial Army is very multiethnic with magic-users from many cultures and they kind of keep their own designation, ""mage"" being the commonest.  However, Quick Ben IS in the army. While Tattersail is in a mage cadre (a team of powerful mages), Quick Ben is a squad mage, someone attached to a regular squad and who are usually less powerful than cadre mage."
Malazan,2sq6q5,SamTremblay,2,Sat Jan 17 15:59:55 2015 UTC,"I knew Quick Ben was army, but Tattersail always called him 'Wizard' and I couldn't tell if that was meant in some sort of slight, as in 'you're just a wizard and I'm a sorceress'.  But I'm glad it's all interchangeable, the less things I have to remember the entire read the better! :D"
Malazan,2sq6q5,sonofa2,2,Sun Jan 18 10:36:11 2015 UTC,"So warrens are essentially other dimensions or realms.  When a mage draws power from their warren, they can use magic.  Tattersail is a high level mage that uses Thyr.  Mages can't normally access more than like 2 warrens, and even that is special. Quick Ben has access to 12. So he's kind of unique, for reasons that you'll find out eventually.  That uniqueness is what Tattersail was referring to, as multiple mages can access the same warren."
Malazan,2sq6q5,sonofa2,2,Sat Jan 17 13:30:10 2015 UTC,"Oookay. So Thyr isn't her Warren. It's just the one she has mastered.  Is there explanation coming on how they do that? Or why they choose a specific one or something?  Also, with the color thing, do Warrens always look the same no matter who is accessing it? Or are the colors of the Warrens different depending on the user?"
Malazan,2sq6q5,sonofa2,1 point,Sat Jan 17 13:41:29 2015 UTC,"The color thing is kind of weird, but not important really, at least until a later book. Basically the colors represent the warrens, not the users.  Mages have a natural affinity towards their warren. Tattersail couldn't go out and use menas (another warren) for example.  There's also the concept of priests, which will be touched on later. Mages pull the power from the warrens, priests are given the power."
Malazan,2sq6q5,Giotto,2,Sat Jan 17 14:03:43 2015 UTC,"Oh good, I'm glad color does come back, it seemed a very intriguing concept.  What determines a mage's affinity? Is it personality? i.e. Is Tattersail meant to be seen as 'good' because her Warren is light? And whoever has the Warren for health has an affinity towards mercy/healing/etc.?"
Malazan,2sq6q5,jeanthine,2,Sun Jan 18 10:38:30 2015 UTC,"People are just born into an affinity.  It's not really tired to their personality, unless you count training, which can influence people, just as raising a child a certain way will influence them.    Also, a word if advice, don't think of certain characters as good/evil, cruel/merciful, etc.  Everyone is pretty much a gray character, and they do things that they think is right.  There's always another side to each conflict, and you will not be reading this story in a vacuum from opposing sides."
Malazan,2sq6q5,Fnarley,1 point,Sun Jan 18 13:47:27 2015 UTC,"Mages are sometimes called talents, and seem to be born with some sort of affinity to their Warren. Some can be a different sort of talent and sense magic while not really being able to use it. You'll notice this in Fiddler, who also has an affinity to the deck of dragons but can not access any warrens."

Ultimately you're not meant to understand it all at first glance anyway, remember that in this world it would take an academic a lifetime of dedicated study to understand the true nature of warrens, holds, azath, the whole mess.

Kettle isn't Feather Witch.  Silchas Ruin was released from the Azath Tower at the end of Midnight Tides. He was the one talking to Kettle throughout the book.

Malazan,2sqbpa,thegoatofharrenhall,10,Sat Jan 17 13:21:35 2015 UTC,"So, there was a post just the other day about a persons thoughts after having finished the series. And so I am going to copy-pasta most of my remarks because that poster didn't like all the philosophy either, calling it ""pseudo philosophical nonsense"".  ""I think its a little arrogant to say that the prose are full of 'pseudo-philosophical nonsense'. Maybe you didn't understand the purpose of that 'nonsense' but I know for myself I found deep meaning within much of his philosophical thoughts within the series. All of which he is using to help further explore the thematic issues and questions that he raises in the series.  What does it mean to suffer? What is the difference between absolution and redemption? How do we move on after our friends and loved ones have died? Are those that we deem evil deserving of compassion? Is there anything ever truly evil, or are we just products of the circumstances that bore us?  Can we ever truly know history when much of it has gone 'unwittnessed'? Or to use a quote from Churchill, ""History is written by the victor."" If that is true, than what of the histories of the fallen and the defeated?  In no way are these trivial or nonsensical philosophical discussions. And each and every one of those can be found within what you deem 'pseudo-philosophical nonsense'.""  They may not add to the story directly, but those philosophical musing most assuredly play a very large role in the thematic works that Erikson is exploring through-out this series. Those thematic works do end up having a role in what actually happens and helped shape much of the series. And to just skip them, is to ignore the main points he was trying to illuminate. And the ""gods not caring"" is entirely the plot of the series! You have not yet finished the series yet, so cannot understand the full significance of that statement.  As for the Errant, he is highly narcissistic, he couldn't give two shits about humanity and doesn't care about humans. Case in point how his old worshipers, before killing them off, performed human sacrifice for him. Humans are cattle to him, their blood was the source of his power. And so yes, when he is that self-absorbed he most certainly can and will learn something new about humans.  You also should remember that in these later books, especially Toll the Hounds, Erikson is struggling with the death of his father. So he does spend a lot of time philosophizing and contemplating various issues that he himself was facing and struggling against.  tl;dr Just because you don't think his philosophical musings play any role in the plot, you couldn't be further from the truth. While this series is fantasy, I see it as a vehicle he has used to explore deep philosophical issues of the real world that most of us would rather just ignore. You ignoring them only proves that point, because they tend to be really uncomfortable about what it says of ourselves and our species."
Malazan,2sqbpa,Bilbato,6,Sat Jan 17 15:38:00 2015 UTC,"I see it as a vehicle he has used to explore deep philosophical issues of the real world that most of us would rather just ignore.   That's so true, specially when it comes to the Snake.   For me the philosophical musings and the themes Erikson explores throughout the books are what sets this series apart. It's not just adventures and action and battles. It's something much more bigger and profound. And it's made more real due to the fact that he ties these fantasy elements to our own world and life issues."
Malazan,2sqbpa,grixa,4,Sat Jan 17 15:59:14 2015 UTC,"This. So much this. The overall story is quite layered, which is why it's known for gaining a lot on the reread. Sure he came up with some crazy plots and action scenes, but they're all just a vehicle to deliver some pretty hard-hitting themes. They may come across as filler if you're more into the fast-moving action parts, but they're really what gives the series value IMO."
Malazan,2sqbpa,TurboS40,1 point,Sat Jan 17 18:25:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I see your point and you're right the philosophy doesn't occur in other fantasy series, but I don't think they're worse off for it since IMO the context behind the deep themes doesn't need to be stated. Erikson is very good at leaving the reader to work out things on their own, and yet these philosophical sections are very wordy and spell out a theme that would otherwise be implied. For example Erikson's brilliant construction of his world and the Gods that dwell in it has left me thinking at many times of the pointlessness of worship, and how the temples and riches within signify the greed and power of the worshippers, and have nothing to do with the Gods (in his world at least). But I could dwell on this without the need for the constant introspection and musing. Just the book showing me the flaws of faith in his world is enough and it leaves the interprative thinking up to me. By spelling out characters thoughts on this it's like his opinions of his own world are being forced on me (especially when their thoughts on faith all go down the same route - ""the Gods don't care""). Anyway I'll post back when I finish the series since my opinion might change."
Malazan,2sqbpa,Bilbato,2,Sat Jan 17 20:26:52 2015 UTC,"how the temples and riches within signify the greed and power of the worshippers, and have nothing to do with the Gods (in his world at least).    More then just his world. The same is true of our own. We build our churches and temples and adorn them with gold and riches not to worship some God(s), but to worship our own selves. And your use of the qualifier ""in his world at least"" shows to me that you really didn't get the point that he was making. He is making philosophical arguments against our own world, but he is using a fantasy setting as it is better able to illuminate the specific issues that he is trying point out.  So to me at least, it would seem that those overt discussions and introspections by characters are necessary, because you yourself don't fully recognize or acknowledge what he is alluding to within our very own world.  If we accept that there is some God out there, watching down on us in this world of ours, how are we to take that? Is it a benevolent God as ascribed by the Abrahamic traditions? If so, then why does this God do nothing for the millions of lives that suffer? Can he truly be benevolent if he is willing to ignore their cries of pain? Where is its sense of compassion? If that God is willing, but somehow not able, then why would those religious texts say that he is all-powerful? At this point I am basically arguing Epicurus' argument against God  Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent.  Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent.  Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil?  Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?  Yes, those philosophical sections are wordy, but how else are we to discuss philosophy? He can point to things without ever having any musings or discussion on it, sure. But the grand majority of people will then just gloss over what he is saying, and not take the full measure of the implications of what he says about this world that we live in and the actions of humanity. Why? Simply because people will choose to read it as a fantasy series and say that its all about that other place, that what he says and the problems and issues that he raises doesn't apply to us and our world. Because humans are lazy, self-centered, full of hubris, and would rather not take the time to think about these highly complex and deeply troubling problems that he points out and seek any means to avoid those thoughts.  I will end with a quote from Kruppe that so elegantly illuminates this point.  “Tis the grand stupidity of our kind, dear Cutter, to see all the errors of our ways, yet find in ourselves the inability to do anything about them. We sit, dumbfounded by despair, and for all our ingenuity, our perceptivity, for all our extraordinary capacity to see the truth of things, we hunker down like snails in a flood, sucked tight to our precious pebble, fearing the moment is is dislodged beneath us. Until that terrible calamity, we do nothing but cling.  ""Can you even imagine a world where all crimes are punished? Where justice is truly blind and holds out no hands happy to yield to the weight of coin and influence? Where one takes responsibility for his or her mistakes, acts of negligence, the deadly consequences of indifference or laziness? Nay, instead we slip and duck, dance and dodge, dance the dodge slip duck dance, feet ablur. Ourselves transformed into shadows that flit in chaotic discord. We are indeed masters of evasion--no doubt originally a survival trait, at least in the physical sense, but to have such instincts applied to the soul is perhaps our most egregious crime against morality. What we will do so that we may continue living with ourselves. In this we might assert that a survival trait can ultimately prove its own antithesis, and in the cancelling out thereof, why, we are left with the blank, dull, vacuous expression that Kruppe sees before him."""
Malazan,2sqbpa,Bilbato,-1,Sat Jan 17 23:39:36 2015 UTC,"I don't want to get into a religious debate but the point I was making is that in other fantasy novels you can still find this philosophy. The arguments for and against it are fascinating and worthy of discussion, but not everyone looks for deeper meaning, and not everyone interprets this deeper meaning in the same way. Some people just want to enjoy the book, yet Erikson gives the reader no choice. You have to listen to his philosophical argument and you are only subjected to one point of view on it: Eriksons. I said ""in his world at least"" not because I didn't see what he was getting at but because I disagree that in our world places of worship are just temples to humans, again there is no answer to this in the books."

With an increasing number of religious extremists that feel that they have the right to kill, torture, or imprison those that dare to question their religions. Some even feeling the right to kill solely because they had the audacity to draw, or to teach a woman to read, or any other reason they find offense with.  My main point was not about religion. I only used religion because you emphasized it in your posts. My point is that most people don't want to take the time to think about things that make them uncomfortable. They will find any means within their grasp to drown out and ignore the source of those uncomfortable thoughts. To ""slip and duck, dance and dodge, dance the dodge slip duck dance"" as Kruppe so elegantly puts it."
Malazan,2sqbpa,SageOfTheWise,2,Sun Jan 18 18:29:06 2015 UTC,Yeah I absolutely agree with your point. I guess just for me a book is more about escapism more than dwelling on today's issues. Someone (I forget who) once said that no two people read the same book. Different opinions :)
Malazan,2sqbpa,SerBronnofBlackwater,1 point,Sun Jan 18 21:24:48 2015 UTC,"My point is that most people don't want to take the time to think about things that make them uncomfortable.   I don't think some even get to the part of them being uncomfortable... :P  I got a response today that justifies the judgmental view of some fictional characters because they are fictional...so that makes it ok, because they aren't real."
Malazan,2sqbpa,Cazraac,4,Mon Jan 19 05:29:14 2015 UTC,"RAFO He underestimated the Maranth munitions and was driven off by them. He's otherwise fine though. There isn't really a confrontation,  they just find his soul and silchas uses it to grow a new azath.  If you remember from Midnight Tides, the azath there was dieing and animated a corpse, kettle, to become it's seed basically, which is why kettle became the new azath. The reprieve is that Sabandari can rest in an Azath now, a reference to how Silchas had to be in one for years. I mean, he's redmask. The twist isn't that he's someone specific, but that he was a letherii child raised by that tribe and ends leading a war against his own people. He wears the mask to hide his heritage since its his shame. The thing you should be asking going into the later books is why were 2 k'chain under his command."

It is always a bit daunting to start a new book in this series, since the endings are so intense while the beginning to the middle of the books are usually much slower.  TtH has been mostly Darujhistan untill now, so if You like that you'll be good.  There are some interesting characters we get to meet again, and the plotlines are starting to form up.  I am not as sick of the philosophy as you are, I actually kind of like it, but I do agree the the prose is more complex than it needs to be really.  It feels almost like an academic text at times.    I really am enjoying this series though, there is no doubt about it.  Engaging stuff."
Malazan,2sqbpa,chappyyy,1 point,Sun Jan 18 19:20:15 2015 UTC,Yeah I explained earlier why I don't like them and I see why a lot of people do. I'm sure I'll enjoy TtH in the end and I have no doubts I'll finish the series.

You are approaching end game, should start reflecting on the main plot, and what you can make of it.  Your questions and concerns were already addressed so I'll spare you of my rambling :p"
Malazan,2sqbpa,PM-ME-YOUR-NIPPLE,2,Mon Jan 19 05:35:15 2015 UTC,"Most has already been said but i'll have to throw my opinion on your post...   The bit where you mentioned emotions you've found from reading the series is so accurate to me. I was very much the same I'd never really read anything to the point i was close to crying but the malazan books nearly got me there and pretty much did in the last book when a certain comment is made from Kalam. I agree on the Karsa ending too, totally awesome when he just killed him and then still denied the TCG. TCG was the best and saddest of all the books for me, I think it was the whole fact you have to face which is that this is the end of the line for the main story of the malazan world and it's really sad there's no more.  Please post back after the TCG I'd like to here some peoples reactions to the ending of the series!"

There will be moments that never leave you. I am only half way through House of Chains and I truly feel all of these things. I have loved ever moment and cannot put the books down. I was the biggest asoiaf fan, I read every theory and read each book three times. I already like this series more and there are moments that hit me harder than anything in asoiaf. That is not a knock on that series, I will always love it, but Malazan is something else entirely. I truly have trouble coming to terms with the fact that I have 6 more books left, in just the main series. I feel as if I have already been on such an intense journey. I cannot recommend this series enough. Push through and you will be rewarded. You're in for a ride."

I'm really glad I posted this question here, otherwise I would have thought I was just missing something, not really grasping the story (even though it was only the prologue), but it's made me feel a whole lot better to know that that is the story.

Malazan,2sp0ey,copypastepuke,3,Sat Jan 17 23:41:42 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Just imagine that the writer is writing it as if you live in that world. If you were to read something set in this world the author isn't going to explain what a car, cell phone or machine gun is, because it's obvious. This is written that way and you pick up on everything through context clues and casual conversation between characters. You will pick up on it. That's my favorite part about it. By the end of the first book you will understand the basics."

Malazan,2sp0ey,KBKarma,5,Sat Jan 17 04:28:02 2015 UTC,"If you don't expect to be food fed all information immediately and if you can accept that it's not written like traditional fantasy you're in for an awesome book/series.   Just go with the book and enjoy the characters, mystery, epicness, action, magic, intrigue, etc. As for literary fatigue it is a long series I started a reread shortly after I finished.   Edit: Erickson is a anthropologist and archeologist and for me it really made the world feel real and hashed out. Also his philosophy was very poignant and powerful."
Malazan,2sp0ey,DetectiveGamble,6,Sat Jan 17 03:51:27 2015 UTC,"There will be gardens. There will be at least one moon.  The phrase ""Gardens of the Moon"" may be uttered by someone at least once.  In addition to all this, you will find a fully-realised world, which you shall be flung into headfirst, to sink or swim. If you decide that enough is enough, and the water closes over your head, cease purchasing this series, and move on. The intro says that almost word-for-word. If you decide to try swimming, then you'll start finding out more. Slowly, you'll piece everything together. There'll still be mysteries (because, just as in the real world, not every mystery is solved), but you'll soon understand the central premise of the series.  Expect action, oh yes. Expect some tension. Expect some plot and exposition, the relevance of which will only be revealed to you later in the series. Expect some absolutely wonderful characters and dialogue (I think Erikson writes some good dialogue). You'll laugh. You may cry. And, afterwards, you may be interested in learning more, and continue the series. This is the smallest of the books in the series (barring short story collections, I think). It was also written about 10 years before the rest. So, every book after amps up all of this,  adds more, and feels grander.  But you won't know about that until you start this book.

Malazan,2sp0ey,TheBananaKing,3,Sat Jan 17 22:43:44 2015 UTC,"The glossary in the back of the book and the dramatis personae in the front are your best friends.  Like others have said, Eriksen is an archeologist and an anthropologist so his world building skills are amazing. Each locale you visit and most characters of all races have a rich sense of history and lore. Malazan is ancient, and you feel it every step of the way.   You may feel confused at first, like you got dropped into a foreign country with no knowledge of the history or customs or language, and who the heck are all these people? This is normal. Eriksen usually does not do info dumps, you are expected to figure things out as you read. Some major plot lines  take several books to truly put the pieces together. It really is all connected, though it is not apparent at all at first. There are many ""Ooooh and AH-HA!"" moments as you connect the dots. Bear in mind that Gardens is Eriksen's first book and he wrote it 9 years before the rest of the series and it shows sometimes, while still being a good book.   Eriksen is also heavy on the introspective philosophy. Most of the books start slow and steady, with character and plot building, then near the last 200 pages, all hell breaks loose and the next thing you know it's 5 in the morning and you have to go to work in 2 hours but what the heck you'll finish it anyway because you can't stop now.   It's epic, exhilarating, thoughtful, weepy and the kind of series that you'll re-read and deliberately buy the hardcovers for. It's also intimidating as hell. Good luck to you! Just let yourself be swept away, and at least read through Book 2 or 3 if Gardens of the Moon doesn't grab you.

Malazan,2sp0ey,SerBronnofBlackwater,3,Sat Jan 17 22:45:10 2015 UTC,"Basically try to pay attention more than you do in most other series.  Malazan is written as though you understand the world and most importantly its history. In most books understanding history means maybe a couple of hundred preceding years, in Malazan it's hundreds of thousands.  So any time it seems you are getting some info about the world at large, make sure you remember it. Some people like to write it down, or highlight it on the kindle or whatever.  Oh and it jumps around a lot of characters, so don't get annoyed if you love one character and they aren't the focus of the next book, they'll be around."
Malazan,2sp0ey,Fnarley,3,Sat Jan 17 12:14:41 2015 UTC,"When you were a kid, did anyone ever try to make you stop crying by making you laugh? At the height of your bawling, someone pulls a ridiculous face, and the laughter boils up and over.   Right at the tipping point between crying and laughing? That handbrake turn that your emotions pull as you make the transition?   Imagine being tied in a sack and beaten bloody with that feeling. That's the effect the series has overall.   Standard disclaimers for new readers:    The first book is something of an awkward pilot episode; the second and subsequent volumes are way better.  There's almost no infodump; you will not have anything spelled out for you, and there's no convenient outsider that needs things to be explained to him.  Just hang onto your hat, and trust that a lot will make sense later. The vocabulary is broader than many writers use; some people have problems with this. There's also a million and thirty characters. One thing that helps to understand (no spoilers) is that a major theme in the book is convergence: the wielding of power (whether magical, military or otherwise) tends to snowball into ever-larger conflicts. Though there seem to be many unrelated subplots, they're all on something of a collision course.  Be prepared for multiple savage kicks to the feels, and absurd (albeit extremely black) humour out of left field just when you're braced for tragedy."

Malazan,2sm9bb,nodogbadbiscuit,8,Fri Jan 16 10:50:45 2015 UTC,"There's nothing besides the Tor Reread, but you should be fine without it. The book goes back over the political climate a bit in the first few chapters anyway and is probably the only one that does much ""recapping"". So long as you remember that:    Paran went into Dragnipur and released the Hounds Tattersail got soul shifted into a Rhivi child by K'rul, Pran Chole and Kruppe (she met Paran on the plains afterwards) Dujek's Army and the Bridgeburners are all outlawed from the Empire Toc got thrown into a rent by Hairlock, which connected to Chaos Tool left Lorn and headed south after they released Raest because his job was done Darujhistan didn't get destroyed or taken over by the Empire   Pretty much everything else will fill itself in. Even this stuff is covered in the first few chapters pretty well, it's just what's important. The only other characters from the previous book really are Kruppe and Co., the Bridgeburners, and Anomander Rake.  If there's anything in particular doesn't make sense when you read it just ask here, because your only other options are the wiki (don't, spoilers everywhere), the Malazan Empire Forums or the Tor reread, which takes too long to read through for every chapter. The reread page for whatever chapter anything you're unsure of occurs in might be useful though."
Malazan,2sm9bb,MoranthMunitions,3,Fri Jan 16 12:08:24 2015 UTC,"Great that's super useful. Most of those I remember and the others are good reminders! Might have a flick through the reread to remind myself of the bits which are less clear!  Off topic, it's great that the folk on this sub are so eager to help and discuss, so thank you!"
Malazan,2sm0vc,KaleidoscopeIV,14,Fri Jan 16 08:26:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think it happens that often. And when it does, ie DoD Spoilers, it fits because it's been setup the whole book.   There's never one that comes out of nowhere which is essentially what a deus ex machina is.  As others have wrote, most of the book endings deal with convergence so you're not supposed to be surprised when something arrives."
Malazan,2sm0vc,SerBronnofBlackwater,2,Fri Jan 16 16:38:51 2015 UTC,"As I said to someone else, it's not the big Deus Ex things that bug me, because there is the assumption that a higher power with ulterior motives is at work. It's the little things that bother me, things that could easily be solved through a little effort on the part of the characters, but instead something helpful conveniently pops up when it would have been more fulfilling to see the character find a way to solve the problem themselves."
Malazan,2sm0vc,Eltotsira,1 point,Fri Jan 16 17:01:24 2015 UTC,"But to be fair, he also makes a lot of effort killing peripheral and main characters to convey a sense of hopelessness. So, I think it balances out. I see it less as a quick-fix, and more as an attempt at emotional balance.   Also, one of the things emphasized in the entire series is that sometimes crazy things happen for little or no reason, and while that certainly rings true for negative events in the books, it doesn't necessarily imply that it can't also apply to positive events.  Anyways, that's just how I see it."
Malazan,2sm0vc,Aiolus,12,Thu Jan 29 17:12:09 2015 UTC,"Hrmmm one of the core overarching themes in the book is convergence. So these powerful entities are pulled into the situation. Also there are a bunch of situations in the series which are not easily fixed or ever fixed. Considering the huge amount of epic mortals, ascendants, and God's it's not that unlikely.   Honestly for me, if the author adds a device which explains this sort of thing (Wheel of Time with ter'angel or whatever, and Gemmel gave his main characters, something with an R which gave great luck) then I'm pretty happy.   Also I may not fully know what deus ex is in relation to the series. I just know it's like a bad guy is unstoppable except for lightning and then good guy gets lightning gun. (right?) any example from the books?   Edit: hit send by accident."
Malazan,2sm0vc,NoFortress,2,Fri Jan 16 08:47:57 2015 UTC,"Right, it's basically like that, and in this case it's often a literal god intervening. I don't mind it so much when it's the god of luck blessing someone's sword (especially since that was so well done, and the way it's not just a lucky sword, it actually has a purpose within the plot besides just Deus Ex Machina stuff) or really the actions of any of the gods, because the assumption there is that they have ulterior motives for intervening. I don't think any of the Deus Ex examples in the books after the above example are as well-integrated and artfully done, because the sword one flowed, but a lot of them since have felt a little like let-downs where there could have been struggle with a satisfying resolution instead of surprise! all fixed.   Of course, I was also extremely bothered by the part with the Felix Felicis in Harry Potter and how it was used, because that was a Deus Ex Machina too, even though it was established and built into the world, as you say. Maybe it's just a pet peeve we don't share. I just think I'd rather see the characters prevailing rather than being saved like damsels in distress, just as I would have preferred it if Harry had convinced Slughorn to give up his memory in a more interesting and complex way. I guess it just feels like cheating sometimes to me."
Malazan,2sm0vc,JediMasterZao,4,Fri Jan 16 09:20:18 2015 UTC,"Harry Potter is quite honestly a clusterfuck when trying to make sense of the events that occur.  Can you give some examples of moments you felt were Deus Ex Machina? There were only a couple times I felt this was the case, and even those were foreshadowed if you looked hard enough."
Malazan,2sm0vc,JediMasterZao,2,Fri Jan 16 14:31:10 2015 UTC,"Spoilers:  The Harry Potter example was just included to show that even in works that are obviously weaker narratively than Malazan, where you can honestly expect some cop-outs and sloppy plotting, I still find it annoying. I guess I was trying to illustrate how I dislike Deus Ex Machina as a plot device as a general rule, even in simpler storytelling, and it feels like even more of a let-down in something as interesting and complex as Malazan. I actually think a lot of them are fine. For instance, Paran's resurrection was foreshadowed by Harlock's, and there is foreshadowing and after-shadowing for many of the bigger Deus Ex examples, but I'm not just talking about resurrections, I'm talking about convenient little things popping up right where they're needed and undermining the characters' abilities.   With a book series like Malazan, Deus Ex is almost necessary, considering the fact that you have to take in information on the fly, every detail like puzzle pieces that don't start to paint the picture until you have enough to make out this hill or that tree, and you don't always get them in an order that makes sense until later. I love that, which is why I still read the books, when Deus Ex in almost anything else is an immediate turn off for me. Just because I recognize and accept them doesn't mean they don't bother me. The main issue isn't the Deus Ex itself, just that it steals some characters' thunder sometimes, or doesn't provide an effort-payoff relationship that establishes good narrative tension.   I also understand that the books would be even longer than they are if that was included, but I think the extra length would be fine in exchange for fulfillment, I mean I'm already obviously in this for the long haul. If it was a little less ""and then the forest spirit tells them to go left,"" as JebusGobson said, and more ""they decided to go left, and worried about whether they were going the right way until they got there woohoo!"" (to give a really lame example), that feels like a better payoff. I just sometimes wish some of the characters got a little more credit.   Really, it's mostly a pet peeve, and a nitpick, but I think every series has room for improvement and this is one of Malazan's. In the end it's mostly just that there's no such thing as a perfect book, but these are pretty damn good ones.  Edit: sorry for no real examples from the books, but the big obvious stuff doesn't bug me as much as the little cop-outs that sort of pile up."
Malazan,2sm0vc,Giotto,9,Fri Jan 16 16:02:36 2015 UTC,"Dude, stop writting essays and start substantiating your bloody claims ffs."
Malazan,2sm0vc,quilmes86,0,Fri Jan 16 21:53:53 2015 UTC,"I don't have the books on hand right now, and there aren't any really specific examples because they're not big things, just little issues I personally have with the plotting. I don't need to substantiate anything, because I'm not trying to convince anyone of anything, just wondering if anyone shares my occasional annoyance. If you don't, that's fine, I respect that."
Malazan,2sm0vc,JebusGobson,4,Sat Jan 17 00:25:47 2015 UTC,"It's just that i'd really like to know what actually bothers you and to actually be able to have a discussion with you on those points but its literally impossible to discuss your issues when you cant even point them out yourself. My main argument would be that the whole point of Malazan - the convergences, the self-made deities and their interventionism, etc... - is that fate does indeed bring about circumstances that are unbelievable. Calling out the book for using Deux Ex Machinae is basically saying the whole premisce of the book's flawed. Time and time again we see a litteral god from the machine come up and do plot-solving stuff that seems insane out-of-context (just think of Itkovian). Ericksson's point is that in that world, god DOES come from the machine, but not without reason - it's always brought about by the endless prattling and manipulations of ascendants and gods."
Malazan,2sm0vc,Udinaas,2,Sat Jan 17 00:39:16 2015 UTC,"I remember specifically thinking this while reading book 7, which is the first book that I really felt like some of the Deus Ex Machina was more a plot hole patch than an inevitable byproduct of a series written the way Malazan is (which most of the Deus Ex in the series is, and it's the exceptions to this that bother me, the ones that don't seem to fall into any of the gods' previously or later established machinations and motives).  Sorry again for the lack of specific examples, I haven't read book 7 in a while and I don't have it on hand :/"

Malazan,2sm0vc,TurboS40,2,Tue Feb 3 03:33:42 2015 UTC,this annoyed me most in house of chains and one event in tcg where a female is resurrected
Malazan,2sm0vc,Bilbato,4,Fri Jan 23 23:48:26 2015 UTC,"Hah! I wrote this just yesterday over at /r/fantasy:   There's a ton of deus-ex-machinas everywhere (people being killed, revived or saved by supernatural powers just at the right moment), even in very small ways (""where do we go now?"" ""A forest spirit just appeared and told me to go left.""). If you start noticing it, like I did, it becomes EXTREMELY grating after a while.   link  I completely agree. Take, for instance, the scene I just read, where Karsa Orlong goes in search of a horse on the Jhag Odhan (spoilers for HoC follow)   He travels there by warren, and gets dropped off conveniently close to a Jhagut tower; In that tower, there's a Jhagut conveniently not dead yet, but dying under a spell Karsa is conveniently immune to; She send him on to her brother, conveniently capable of a magic that cloaked himself from the T'lan Imass for hundreds of thousands of years (and it's apparently very easy too, which makes one wonder why all Jaghut didn't just do that instead of covering the world in glaciers); He takes him to his sister, who conveniently appears to be the one responsible for Jhag horses tout court, and is still alive; Within a tree because the T'lann Imass conveniently impaled her exactly where a dying but conveniently not-quite-dead-yet Azath house was; Somehow the consciousness of that house then went into the spear, made that spear a tree, and formed a symbiosis with the Jhagut. Why? Fuck you, that's why.   Entire chapters of the book basically read like: ""And then he became hungry AND MAGIC HAPPENED and he had food, so he walked on AND MAGIC HAPPENED and he arrived on his destination much sooner. But then, oh no! He's outnumbered! But fortunately MAGIC HAPPENS and something kills all of them. But oh no! He's wounded! Luckily MAGIC HAPPENS and he's healed! But oh no! MAGIC HAPPENS and he dies anyway!""   After a while, you're left wondering why you even bother feeling suspense in 'suspenseful"" scenes, because chances of deus-ex-machina are nearly 100%. It's even worse: the worse the predicament the character is in, the worse his odds are, the most likely and huge the deus-ex-machina is going to be.   Don't get me wrong: I love the books, and this is more a criticism of love than of aversion."
Malazan,2sm0vc,itkovian,8,Fri Jan 16 08:49:22 2015 UTC,"The talk between the Jaghut after Karsa left strongly intimated that they'd been waiting for him and set everything up to happen extremely quickly because having him around is basically having a walking disaster zone set up shop nearby. The initial drop is because the ""departure point"" within that warren in that spot was close to the tower - we've had established departure points in warrens before in the books, so this isn't a Deus Ex Machina moment.   As for the Azath tree, the Jaghut took refuge within that Azath house for the reasons of possibly finding an ""out"" from the fate of being killed by T'lan Imass pursuers. She found it - although I'm certain it's not the ""out"" she wanted.   Karsa is meant to ride that border between implausible and ""huge, having-a-warren-within-himself, wickedly cunning barbarian sets forth into a world mostly unprepared for him"". He's meant to play with the tropes of ""strength solves everything"" and ""lucky adventurer"". Erikson makes sure he's humbled at key junctions, yet remaining entertaining through his outlandish successes in spots.  The critical component of a Deus Ex Machina moment is that it's unforseen and has no foreshadowing/set-up. Erikson doesn't do that - except for one moment late in the series that has to do with the effects of the death of a god."

Malazan,2sjyav,SerBronnofBlackwater,4,Thu Jan 15 20:50:30 2015 UTC,"Reasons to me it is possible:  We commonly see name changes over the eons such that Arathan being close to Ruthan makes sense  Has close ties to Draconus, views him as an equal power-wise when he says that the next time we meet one of us will die  Arathan has an oral fixation of biting his fingers, Ruthan has an oral fixation of stroking his beard  Good with a sword, plus ice magic is tied to the Jaghut he resided with for a time  T'lann Imass refer to him as ancient  Arathan says he wants to slide through life ""unnoticed"" which is  Ruthan's sentiment through DoD and TCG in his PoV chapters.  Recognizes Quick's full name, which is likely tied to the fact Korya Delath stayed with the Jaghut with Arathan (Korya being one of the souls transfered to QB as opposed to Arathan's -- separate theory"
Malazan,2sjyav,runin2k1,3,Thu Jan 15 21:11:20 2015 UTC,"ice magic is tied to the Jaghut he resided with for a time   The magic of the Jaghut and the magic of the Stormriders is completely different.   Recognizes Quick's full name, which is likely tied to the fact Korya Delath stayed with the Jaghut with Arathan   I also have an issue with that part of that theory, in the Bonehunters Quick Ben (as an individual human before having 11 other souls shifted in) was called Ben Adaephon Delat, that's how he was known to his sister. I searched through the ebooks again to be sure - so I am reasonably - but the only time Rudd says much about Quick Ben is in DoD:   He heard concussions somewhere to his left, caught the stench of howling warrens being forced to do unspeakable things—Quick Ben, how much longer can you hide? Well, Ruthan knew he’d not be around to witness any revelations.   Which doesn't really imply anything except that he's more than he seems, which everyone knows.  I think the rest of it is a bit circumstantial too, besides the name change imo, that's a pretty common thing like you say. Really anyone who has known Draconus would be ""ancient"", half of all characters are good with a sword (especially the ones 100k+ yrs old), and most gods or ascendants try to live on the downlow, which is why so few gods meddled in the series directly or even indirectly. He could just as easily be an Azathanai who never picked up any worship - technically they wouldn't be an Elder God but they'd still be ancient. I do like the comparison in habits though. That one's less likely, though that line from DoD: ""reminding himself of the stranger's face he now wore"" could work for that, as they can shape shift.  I'm not opposed to Ruthan Gudd being Arathan, or Korya's being one of the souls that resides within Quick Ben - from that bit on the Spar of Andii in tCG there's possibly two characters from FoD in there - but I think that people attribute more evidence to the theories than there actually is."
Malazan,2sjyav,MoranthMunitions,2,Thu Jan 15 22:43:06 2015 UTC,"Hmmm fair enough. He doesn't want Rake near him either. However just cause he has a sister doesn't mean that sister isn't also somehow ""elder"" as well."
Malazan,2sjyav,MoranthMunitions,2,Thu Jan 15 23:05:40 2015 UTC,"Chapter 15 of the Bonehunters:   She had once been sent out to hunt down her younger brother, tracking him through half the city – oh, he’d known she was after him, known that she was the one they’d send, the only one capable of closing a hand on one scrawny ankle, dragging him back, then shaking him until his brain rattled inside his skull. He’d led her a wild trail that night. Ten years old and already completely out of control, eyes bright as marbles polished in a mouthful of spit, the white smile more wicked than a wolf’s snarl, all gangly limbs and cavorting malice. He had been collecting ... things. In secret. Strands of hair, nail clippings, a rotted tooth. Something, it turned out, from everyone in the entire extended family. Fortytwo, if one counted four-month-old Minarala – and he had, the little bastard.   I don't think that Quick Ben's original body/soul's name has anything to do with anything because of this section. And it seems like a large stretch that Torahaval is some kind of Elder too, she'd have to have a bunch of made up memories as well as thousands of years of lost ones.

Malazan,2sh68t,jonasbomb,13,Thu Jan 15 03:11:54 2015 UTC,"Tavore in a nutshell:   The Adjunct sighed. ‘I am a child of the Emperor — what more is there for you to understand, Lostara Yil?’  Her detachment from the plot gave the plot mystery. Otherwise the entire twist and realization that Kaminsod was the victim would have not been as poignant. Since she realized this possibly even before becoming the adjunct. Her being a student of history and all.  Karsa, is a hit or miss with people. However if you look at it this way. Where he came from and what he came to understand of the world and it's views, as well as his purpose in it. Even with all his confidence (and arrogance) he is still humbled on more than one occasion.   He went from an uneducated crude barbarian to a barbarian philosopher, and the transition was harsh, full of humbling experiences, but at the same time it allowed him to grow and find other purpose in life as well as expand his view of the world.  Some of the books are a bit bloated. There are some side plots that could have been shortened, that is a given. But a great deal of philosophical banter and musings was close in hand with the actual plot.   The ending is nearly perfect, and perfectly because not everything is fully settled or resolved in perfect ways (or flat out explained, like Cotillion shanking Kaminsod). It's sort of the point that went through the entire series, life is messy and doesn't get clear answers. But even with that a whole lot of things happened. The entire world changed. Mortal races got a hell of a lot of ""say"" in the status quo of the world now. The final convergence was the biggest change of all, the one that had an impact on fundamental order of things in the world, and it's power structure/influence.   I guess there is a lot to discuss what the ending did, it would be easier to say which bits of the ending were disagreeable with you. I personally didn't like the small coverage of Karsa with Fener, and the lack with the Errant. The latter I hope might be explored in a different book."

Malazan,2sh68t,mmSNAKE,11,Thu Jan 15 04:34:19 2015 UTC,"I also didn't really buy this twist even though I could see from Deadhouse Gates that Erikson was getting it up. TGC is a terrible, terrible entity that does terrible things to mortals. The victimization didn't really work for me.   He came to the planet because he was summoned because of* Kallor. So not off his will. When he came all he knew was pain.He was shattered and broken into pieces, it also nearly destroyed the world. The powers of the world were so afraid of this entity that they instead of trying to help, they chained him up sealing him for eternity of torture without any hope of an end. If this wasn't enough, a great deal of them took parts of him and used it as a power source for their own devious and selfish agendas.  So you have Kaminsod, who came to a new world, all he knows is that everyone and everything causes him unspeakable pain, they exploit his very existence for his own means. Then he sees civilizations, mortals, how they abuse one another. How they show hardly any redeemable qualities. In almost every case the more despicable side won. He has to witness that for thousands, and thousands of years, with ever so often they chain him again, to remind him that they still fucking hate his guts for no reason.  And then you wonder why he grew to hate every living thing on that planet...up until the Malazan troops showed him a better example, that despite all the pain and misery he wrought upon them, they were trying to help him all along. That there IS compassion even in this hellhole of a planet.  I hardly think you can find a better example of a victim other than Kaminsod.    I think these are fair points, but I didn't really buy the transformation.   Karsa continually demonstrates insight and fresh perspective to conflict, authority and even compassion. He become a good friend with Torvald Nom, he could have ended him after they were free, but yet, he become his friend. And Torvald was a weak insignificant 'child' he looked down upon prior to his imprisonment.  Yet he parted with him on a good note, as a good friend. He carried both the hopes and terrors of his dead friends and clansmen.   If anything, he continually demonstrates that there is more to people and the world than is lead to think. He is also a great example of mortals fighting oppression from greater powers."

Malazan,2sh68t,Tumblehawk,9,Thu Jan 15 05:40:22 2015 UTC,"He IS mortal. If he ascended or gained power, he did that of his own accord and worth. His race isn't immortal.   He is not a greater power by any means. Urko Crust dropped him with ONE punch back in House of Chains. He shattered his ribs with it. Urko is no god, or ascendent, just a really strong bloke, and he brought down a dude 2-3 times his size in one hit.  Then in Toll The Hounds, when Karsa saw Dassem fight, he was humbled, he admitted in comparison he doesn't hold up. He was never OP, or even considered among the top contenders for power in the world. I mean shit, if he actually tried to pick a fight with Icarium again, that would have ended him on the spot, along with everyone else nearby.  If you wanna label someone the hulk, Icarium fits that bill down to the T. Hell he's even green too.  As far as his perception of people, I think you didn't read much into how people view conflict and it's consequences, both on physical and mental state. If you skipped all the philosophical musings in the books then yeah his chime in wouldn't be much of a contribution. But that also takes away a great deal from the series' worth."

Maybe you didn't understand the purpose of that ""nonsense"" but I know for myself I found deep meaning within much of his philosophical thoughts within the series. All of which he is using to help further explore the thematic issues and questions that he raises in the series.  What does it mean to suffer? What is the difference between absolution and redemption? How do we move on after our friends and loved ones have died? Are those that we deem evil deserving of compassion? Is there anything ever truly evil, or are we just products of the circumstances that bore us?  Can we ever truly know history when much of it has gone 'unwittnessed'? Or to use a quote from Churchill, ""History is written by the victor."" If that is true, than what of the histories of the fallen and the defeated?  In no way are these trivial or nonsensical philosophical discussions. And each and every one of those can be found within what you deem ""pseudo-philosophical nonsense""."
Malazan,2sh68t,mmSNAKE,7,Thu Jan 15 06:29:34 2015 UTC,"It's also something you cant bring up to discuss with people who bash this series for being nonsense basing it on Gardens of the Moon or parts of it.  The philosophy alongside the plot is what sets these books apart from others in the epic fantasy gig, as well as the construction of the whole damn thing.  It is also amazing how much of his work translates to our real world problems and ideas. A great thing to consider Kaminsod, the fallen one, the true victim of this story in contrast to Lucifer the fallen angel. The story in sympathy for the devil, or at least a tortured soul shown to be one."
Malazan,2sh68t,Bilbato,9,Thu Jan 15 07:54:24 2015 UTC,"Very much this. If we are to take accepted Christian theology, humans are the first and only beings that God created with ""free will"". Now, if that is true, then how could have Lucifer rebelled against God? After all, the angels do not, perforce of the accepted Christian theology, have free will. Therefore, Lucifer and the others that rebel against God, were in fact created by God to do just that.  Which then begs the question, is it morally acceptable to believe in a God that would punish its own creation for doing exactly what that God created them to do? Not to mention a lot of other moral issues I have with the Christian God.  To take another example from Malazan and apply it to the real world. I can't remember which book it is, but a character brings up the story of a God of peace. For some reason there are 2 groups that have very different views on this God of peace, and so go to war over it. After so long of fighting, would not that God of peace go insane because of the actions of its followers?  To translate this to the real world, we again look to the Abrahamic religions; Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. Here you have what is supposed to be a God of ever lasting love and peace, yet 3 different groups all say the others got it wrong. And for that, countless lives have been lost in the wars they have waged against one another. All in the name of a God of peace. Not to mention the Inquisition and the persecution of those within the same sect of religious belief but were not seen as pious enough, or that they questioned Church doctrine... there are just so many parallels between Malazan and the real world, at times its mind numbing and heart breaking because of how, aside from all the fantastical elements, closely the two worlds actually are.  So frustrating in /r/fantasy seeing people constantly bashing Malazan, yet have never even finished the first book. And then go on to say that nothing happens, that the characters are shallow, that the plot is nonexistent.  As I said in the Unpopular Fantasy opinions thread over in /r/fantasy, I think its just that they are lazy readers, and for some I would extend it even further that they are not intelligent enough for Malazan. Because it most certainly does require a higher base level of intelligence then most books, combined with needing a sense of introspection to truly connect with this series and to understand the themes and the points that Erikson is making with the series."
Malazan,2sh68t,mmSNAKE,6,Thu Jan 15 08:13:41 2015 UTC,"There are always people who just dislike the thing and move on. There is plenty of intelligent work that I personally don't stomach well but I will at least admit it's worth. I really dislike the Great Gatsby, but it's message is relevant and worth addressing.  Malazan seems to have issues because people expect to grasp it's core in just one book. Which just is not possible. ""This event didn't make sense"", it wasn't supposed to ""am I to just accept this and move on"", yes because it will be relevant later, as well help construct something bigger.  A huge issue is that people are just not willing to accept that the PoV characters do not understand a great deal of things happening. The point in time of the story is exceptional, and so many exceptional things happen. Legends come to life, forgotten comes about. There is no omnipresent narrator or super knowledgeable PoV that will explain this. Readers learn by accumulating experience of those poor fallen characters. Like the series signifies.  A problem people have is that they refuse to believe that this type of storytelling model works(if it doesn't work for you, thats no big deal, but don't criticize it for something you don't like, and not understand it's potential). Then they compare to to one off books that seemingly do this. No they don't. No other author attempted a project like this in a manner as such.  I try to be polite about it, and not come off as a snob, but a great deal of time it really is ""I want to understand this now, because I don't the books are flawed nonsense"". The amount of irrational stupidity... Oh and then when I had enough and point out the bias != objective criticism issue a shouting/insulting match starts (hey if I can't reason, I'll yell louder than the guy and I'm gonna be correct).  It is flat out not possible to properly critique these books without fully reading them. They aren't 100% perfect. Some side stories got slightly bloated and first book is certainly rough around the edges, but in contrast to what the story offers, it's a drop in the ocean.  Oh on religion, while Malazan does touch a great deal on it, I felt Bakker nails it down perfectly. Though his books are much more focused on that theme, while Erikson covered a whole broad spectrum of stuff.  Sorry on the rant, it's just frustrating constantly having to explain to people that their bias is not objective criticism."
Malazan,2sh68t,Desolaice,4,Thu Jan 15 08:44:11 2015 UTC,"No worries on the rant. I am of the same opinion. And I completely know how the whole ""snob"" things goes. Felt snobbish in my post in that /r/fantasy thread for saying A Song of Ice and Fire is sophomoric when compared to Malazan, yet I see that as being very true.  So many people point to it and say ""wow, thats such a complex story, theres so much happening."" And then they have the Red Wedding and all those other points that I see GRRM just using for shock value and not utilizing it for some purpose beyond shocking the reader. Whereas Erikson is far more brutal; yet he uses that brutality to serve thematic purposes through-out the entire series. Not to mention his story is far more complex and there is way more happening then GRRM could ever hope to keep straight without floundering.  Actually had to look up sophomoric to make sure it was the right word I even wanted to use, and god damn do I love its definition. Sophomoric - conceited and overconfident of knowledge but poorly informed and immature. Seems to sum up A Song of Ice and Fire quite well."
Malazan,2sh68t,Poser1313,5,Thu Jan 15 09:03:58 2015 UTC,"ASOIAF has different qualities and focus. Martin's gift is when he goes deep inside of character's head. Showing their feelings and reactions to others. The plot is just there to progress character evolution. Most people don't realize but they don't care all that much of the plot, but rather what happens to the characters they are invested in.  To be fair, ASOIAF has been put under a microscope due to crazy shift in popularity in last 5 years or so. People examined those books more closely than any other fantasy in comparison.  That said, a huge difference between Malazan and ASOIAF is that one is finished and one is not. One stutters and one does not. Malazan never stuttered, since the end game was planned from the start and checkpoints in mind along the way. Martin lost control over his creation. Shortly after ASoS the story becomes bogged down and branches with little end in sight. Time will tell. I would prefer if books finish before the TV show does, since last season of the TV show was a real let down for me."

From the link:   Tavore was and remains for me one of my favourite characters to write, to a large extent because she was all about holding back, revealing as little as possible, while a cauldron churned inside (culminating in that scream, which I’ve known was coming for most of the series – can you imagine how that felt, keeping her bottled up for scene upon scene?

She was the paragon of selflessness, and that was served by the author, and most characters around her, respecting that.  I was in awe."
Malazan,2sh68t,Tumblehawk,3,Thu Jan 15 21:56:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with you're reasoning on the philosophy. There was too much of it in my opinion as well. Especially in Toll the Hounds.   I like Karsa but he's not my favorite characters like he seems to be with most people. He does bad ass things but people like forget he killed children and raped a lot of women.   One can argue that he changed and no longer has childish views like glory. But his view of thinking he could destroy all of civilization is still very naive. I don't care how many Toblakai he can find, it won't be enough.   Hopefully his character grows even more in the Toblakai Trilogy and we get to see him become less naive."

Malazan,2sgf9g,mmSNAKE,4,Thu Jan 15 03:40:00 2015 UTC,"same here. I could wright a book about this. I think to be honest that way more people should be reading. I remember my parents telling me that it was more weird when they were young to not be reading at least semi regularly than reading. This is not only my opinion but for certain brain activities and certain forms of memory and intelligence reading has been proven to be extremely beneficial to the human mind.  And to be honest I blame education systems. No matter what education system you're in, when it comes to reading, no matter which language, its always the same thing; they teach you how to read with children books in kinder garden and as soon as you get to middle/high school all you do is read classics and books which are ""considered"" to be intellectual. Nothing wrong with that, but lets be honest here, sure, Lord of the Flies is an interesting book, but fuck me its boring as hell. Im not saying that all high class literature and classics ar boring, Im just saying that maybe, just maybe, its not what a 14 year old needs to get him into reading.  And thats precisely the point. English and language teachers around the world complain that kids don't read as much anymore, yeah maybe they would if you had encouraged them to read fun books for their age. And it is my firm belief that this is how future generations can be brought to read again; Teaching them classics and fun books; fantasy, romance, action etc for them for to rear in their free and class time. I personally for example found it much easier to enjoy philosophical and classic novels after having discovered the fantasy genre."
Malazan,2sgf9g,HumbleAsFudge,2,Thu Jan 15 09:17:06 2015 UTC,I agree with this. Most of the time stuff that kids are forced to read in school is something that is difficult to relate to. Teens don't give a damn what Great Gatsby's about. However once they start working and earning wages...things change.  I recall hating Grapes of Wrath. Thankfully I grew up amidst hundreds of books at home and I read since I could remember. I just didn't broaden my scope until at some point in college when I started taking logic and philosophy courses.
Malazan,2sgf9g,mmSNAKE,0,Fri Jan 16 00:13:46 2015 UTC,I could wright a book about this.   Friendly advice: your tirade on education system reform would be taken more seriously if you ran it through a spell-checker first.

I was trawling through loads of websites, blogs, threads, pretty much anything that could offer me great alternatives to GRRM's series.  I'm a huge fan of the fantasy genre, so when I saw that the name of this series came up in a few places, I decided to give it a quick search; the reviews were great, the plot sounded fantastic, and it seemed to be right up my alley.  Even though I'm still only on Gardens of the Moon, and even then not very far into it, I'm already hooked. And I've already recommended it to two friends of mine, both of whom love A Song of Ice and Fire and fantasy as much as I do — and that's exactly how I sold it.   And it worked. One of said friends has already gone out to buy it, the other hoping to borrow the first book when I'm finished. If you know people who are huge fans of fantasy then getting them to read this book shouldn't be too difficult."
Malazan,2scqbm,tenth,15,Wed Jan 14 02:03:25 2015 UTC,Laseen made laws against the use of unsanctioned magic. The Mouse Quarter is/was heavily populated by hedge witches and the like that rioted against this. Some of the army and a mage cadre were sent in to enforce the laws. It was handled badly and the the cadre completely lost control and the place burned down.
Malazan,2scqbm,SageOfTheWise,8,Wed Jan 14 02:23:05 2015 UTC,"I believe it was non sanctioned magic that Laseen was against. There were hedge witches there, also it was considered a bad move.  The attempt also got really out of hand and led to slaughter."
Malazan,2scqbm,Aiolus,5,Wed Jan 14 02:12:57 2015 UTC,"This is correct.  It was a move that made sense in terms of the Empire's general philosophy.  The Malazans have a history of attempting to limit both internal and external threats to the Empire.  Internally, Laseen ordered multiple cullings of the nobility.  Externally, the Malazans either befriend or try to conquer everyone they meet.  By executing the mages in the Mouse Quarter, Laseen was attempting to increase her power by weakening a group of people that wasn't under the Empire's direct control."
Malazan,2scqbm,PhilosopherIshamael,2,Wed Jan 14 02:36:23 2015 UTC,"What I never understood in GotM is why Tattersail and her boyfriend were even out there when they assaulted Rake? I mean, they did nothing, just tried to protect themselves, and failed."
Malazan,2scqbm,shinarit,6,Wed Jan 14 10:38:08 2015 UTC,"Because they were part of the mage cadre, it was literally their job. Desertion is normally followed by capital punishment.

Calot protected her to his own detriment, but if GotM/MoI  This comment by /u/SageOfTheWise and the other one further down that thread explain what happened during the fight, with a bit of hindsight added, in case you weren't 100%, but if everything had worked out properly they probably would have been a useful addition to the fight."

I knew they were compromised from the start by Imperial forces (Tayschrenn and co), but I remembered that they were assaulted by Rake alone at first, and they suffered from that. But duty is a good reason, nobody could have known at first.  This was the scene that made me love this series, just how uncheckedly powerful mages are. Though I have no idea why the non-magical troops were arrayed at all, they had no way to fight, they just died without reason."

The mages whole focus was to neutralize magic, the majority of which would come from Rake, but they knew Pale had their own mages (even if they didn't know they had fled).  So, infantry in front for assault. Mages in back for defense, siege."

Now i know I'm going to get allot of flack now because Im about to criticise a certain aspect of the book, even though each character and sentence seems to be worshipped here; Lorn was not a well written character in the sense of her being real. There was good character development, she was interesting to read about, sure but she was not real within the malaz world. Why?  Because of the scene that O.P described. Were talking about one of the most powerful positions in the empire, the second in command to Laseen, and somehow, this person thinks is to be appropriate to execute a mage for doing her job? And the whole thing about her not knowing that Laseen gave the orders doesn't add up. She works for the Empire, Laseen works for the Empire, even if Lorn wasn't aware that Laseen gave out the orders for the mages and soldiers to go down into the mouse district, what the hell does she think the mages and soldiers did? Just go down on there without any orders to have some fun? NO! Of course not, of course the order would have come from within the empire so why the hell is she treating Tattersail like a murderer? This is literally the only part which bothered me in GotM, its the only part where we see a character that doesn't fit within the scenario. The second in command to the Empress thought that soldiers and mages just swooped down onto the mouse district and randomly slaughtered. k."
Malazan,2scqbm,HumbleAsFudge,4,Wed Jan 14 11:38:08 2015 UTC,"You would think that's how she should act as Adjunct, but there was also that whole part in there about how her family was part of those who suffered the consequences of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Having just re-read, I'm pretty sure I'm GotM it mentions that her brother, mom, and dad were all killed by the fire/magery, and that the name she linked to those deaths was Tattersail. That's why afterwards Tay and Dujek were both basically saying that she needed to calm the f down because she is adjunct now, not the woman, Lorn. And then Toc makes a comment about how the woman Lorn was tried to resurface and then was battered down and killed by what she had become, Adjunct to the Empress.  So it wasn't a completely random outburst on her part, she just lost her cool for a second."

Malazan,2s680r,choihanam,1 point,Tue Jan 13 10:24:55 2015 UTC,"I've only read part way into MOI, so I may be missing something. But what is the reasoning behind assuming it's a glottal stop? Is this addressed somewhere in the series or by Erikson?  There are numerous other usages of the apostrophe (most commonly, in European languages anyways: omission, elision; also: aspiration, syllable separation, pallatization.) and I don't see why glottal stop is the one people have landed on. As such, T'lan is at least as complex to pronounce as Tellan, but languages normally evolve to be simpler or following predictable phoneme-change patterns (which also doesn't seem to apply here). Besides, I don't see why it should be the same for the Imass, the Seven Cities, the shapeshifters, and whoever else.  Actually, the whole apostrophe thing is one of the elements of the books that I of dislike. Like many before him, it seems like Erikson employs them rather haphazardly to make his made up names and words seem unique and foreign, but instead it comes across as rather sloppy and trite."
Malazan,2s5iw2,Fnarley,5,Mon Jan 12 10:23:08 2015 UTC,"Your best bet for hardback will probably be the Internet or second hand book stores. As for box sets, there isn't one. The only collection is an ebook.   Edit: what I did was just get the paperbacks and cover them with contact. They're over two years old and still look very good."
Malazan,2s5iw2,PromisedPrince694,4,Mon Jan 12 11:37:30 2015 UTC,I'm actually thinking about getting all ten paperbacks and just taking them to a book repair service and getting them all bound professionally in hardback. That way I'll have a perfectly matching set.

It'd be impressive enough to knock down to three volumes imo, and even then all three would be close to equalling Zettels Traum, the longest novel that's in a single volume.  3 million is a serious number of words, I doubt it could be done and even if it could.. shame that, it would look really impressive."

Maybe 2 over the past year, lol.  The numbered editions are more readily available and still pretty nice: hardcover, custom color artwork, archive paper, signed and numbered, etc. Once you have a numbered/lettered book, you do get first rights to that specific number/letter going forward."
Malazan,2s4s8k,pfk505,18,Mon Jan 12 04:27:10 2015 UTC,"Like you said there's some stuff mentioned NoK and RotCG, but it is mentioned obliquely in the main series too:  DG, Chapter 20:   Upon opening the door, they entered the tower’s ground floor. A stone staircase spiralled up from its centre. At the foot of the saddlebacked steps lay another body, a young, dark-skinned woman who looked as if she had been placed there but an hour before. She was dressed in what were clearly underclothes, though the armour that had once covered them was nowhere to be seen. Vicious wounds crisscrossed her slight form. Apsalar approached, crouched down and rested a hand on the girl’s shoulder. ‘I know her,’ she whispered. ‘Eh?’ Rellock growled. ‘The memory of the one who possessed me, Father,’ she said. ‘His mortal memory—’ ‘Dancer,’ Fiddler said. She nodded. ‘This is Dassem Ultor’s daughter. The First Sword recovered her after Hood was done using her, and brought her here, it seems.’ ‘Before breaking his vow to Hood—’ ‘Aye, before Dassem cursed the god he once served.’     MoI, Chapter 7:   K’rul continued after a moment. We have lost allies in our foolishness. Dassem Ultor, who was broken by Hood’s taking of his daughter at the Time of the Chaining – this was a devastating blow. Dassem Ultor, the First Sword reborn— ‘Do you think,’ she asked slowly, ‘that Hood would have taken her for the Chaining, had I answered the summons?’ Am I, she wondered, to blame for Dassem Ultor’s loss? Hood alone could answer that question, Lady Envy. And he’d likely lie, in any case. Dassem, his Champion – Dessembrae – had grown to rival his power. There is little value in worrying such questions, beyond the obvious lesson that inaction is a deadly choice. Consider: from Dassem’s fall, a mortal empire now totters on the edge of chaos. From Dassem’s fall, the Shadow Throne found a new occupant. From Dassem’s fall. . . ah, well, the tumbling dominoes are almost countless. It is done.   Besides that there's a bit of talk here or there of him betraying Hood and of how he's the Lord of Tragedy, Dessembrae, scattered throughout the books. It's not particularly easy to put together the first time, especially if you don't read RotCG, and is a bit ambiguous even when you have read all the relevant stuff."
Malazan,2s4s8k,MoranthMunitions,4,Mon Jan 12 05:22:30 2015 UTC,"Great stuff from you as usual, my friend.  I do remember that scene from DG but I'm guessing that I didn't register ""Dassem""'s importance at that time and it went in one ear and out the other, so to speak.  Thank you for the clarification.  To be honest all I really had in mind when reading Traveller's sections in TtH was that one scene towards the end of RotCG but it seemed like a fairly important plot thread, given the lengths Rake went to in order to stop him (or, if one takes another view, that it was all 'part of the plan').  Anyways that was exactly what I was looking for.  Thanks again!"
Malazan,2s4s8k,Ezzelino,0,Mon Jan 12 05:54:08 2015 UTC,"I can't remember when it comes into play, but there is a definitive reason why he wants Hood's head. As far as you know, why does he want Hood dead?"
Malazan,2s4chn,WingedBeing,4,Mon Jan 12 01:59:34 2015 UTC,"Also just started and did in fact notice that. It's not weird to do that, since most European authors do that, but it is weird for a Canadian author to switch three books in. I wonder why they did that?"

My ebook copy has them too. Hope for their sake it happens after that big war meeting, that'd be brutal to read without quote marks.  Unless they mean using ' instead of "" or something.

Malazan,2rylb9,OverJealousRapidToad,8,Sat Jan 10 13:57:18 2015 UTC,"It would make a great Seinen show, but if it were done Shonen, I think it would end up sucking pretty badly.

Malazan,2rylb9,Sopp90,4,Sat Jan 10 21:23:19 2015 UTC,Are there also artistic differences or is it just content differences?
Malazan,2rylb9,Kelset,7,Sat Jan 10 21:58:08 2015 UTC,"The art in Seinen series tend to be more realistic, while Shounen leans more towards the cartoonish.  I'll give you some examples:  Monster is a seinen  No Game No Life is a shounen  Here's to hoping I formatted the links correctly!"

Malazan,2rylb9,SKR47CH,1 point,Tue Jan 13 11:10:19 2015 UTC,"I think Ufotable could handle it in terms of quality. Not sure about the writing, animes usualy have that wierd sense of humour (not my style)."

Malazan,2rylb9,AllWrong74,3,Mon Jan 12 07:12:05 2015 UTC,As I've said before. Production I.G and Yoko Kanno. I would be so happy!

Malazan,2rylb9,SKR47CH,1 point,Tue Jan 13 11:07:12 2015 UTC,"I have to say, I kind of enjoy the lack of adaptation. I'm into the bit of art that has been created to illustrate the world, but the story itself seems so much about the power of storytelling, that I just love that it's being left to my imagination. I don't really want an adaptation - whether in graphic  novel or animation format - to ever sully the vision in my head."
Malazan,2rylb9,Tumblehawk,1 point,Wed Jan 14 23:12:17 2015 UTC,"The content probably would make for a good series, but I feel that disappointment would be inevitable and crushing for many existing fans."
Malazan,2rylb9,Lankles,0,Wed Jan 21 03:31:04 2015 UTC,"To be honest I think the animation style should be something between high budget anime and western adul movie animation. And with ""adult"" Im not talking about pornography, I'm talking about the western equivalent to seinen.   with a big enough budget I find they should do it in a format like 1 season for each book, so 10 in total, with each season containing between 15 and 20 episodes each one hour long. That would be quite close to the amount of time the audiobooks are, meaning that not allot would have to be left out and cut form the book, which as we all know would be great .  As for character design I find that they should have as always concept artist, but definitely consult Erikson and perhaps even ICE for how they pictured the characters.  If the series is successful they could continue to create spin offs for all the other novels by ICE and Erikson in the Malaz universe. It would be great because there would be so much material, so much to watch and none of it would be filler since their are so many books anyways, people would never get bored of re watching since there'd be so much; Eriksons main series, his novellas, his kharkans trilogy and his upcoming toblakai trilogy, together with all of ICE's novellas there would be so much material to watch it would be so nice!"
Malazan,2rylb9,HumbleAsFudge,2,Sat Jan 10 21:48:16 2015 UTC,15-20 hour long episodes? I suppose that's the ideal but it very likely isn't feasible for anything that isn't on the popularity level of Rowling.
Malazan,2rylb9,JPC5,1 point,Sun Jan 11 02:55:28 2015 UTC,"You're probably right, I think they would have two options;  A. The safe path in which they do the standard 10 episodes per season each 1 hour long.  B. They go all in and start off with a budget big enough to hold the first 5 season (since the standard ""end"" would be after 5 seasons of 20 episodes (100 episodes)) and then proceed to see if they've gained enough popularity/money to continue it would be a big risk, but with good marketing, a very loyal and active fan base, and a bit of luck, Im sure many more would jump on board."

Malazan,2rvra2,grixa,7,Sat Jan 10 11:52:31 2015 UTC,"The vocals on this album are actually pretty well done, and are certainly not atypical of the genre.  You're not the audience they're shooting for ;)"

Malazan,2rxeb1,Aiolus,1 point,Sat Jan 10 06:15:24 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter where you read FoD with respect to the rest of the series. That said I'd read it and then FoL when it comes out, that way you have something to break up your reread a bit and you can join whatever discussion occurs in the month or two after release, there should be lots to speculate on for the third book which should be interesting. Plus comparing the Tiste characters between the two series is pretty interesting so if you read it first you might have a different perspective on them during your reread.  I don't think anyone will have any really strong opinions on it though, the storylines don't interact enough for it to matter."

Malazan,2rtknm,Falkor,6,Fri Jan 9 07:04:18 2015 UTC,"The entire series is a set of threads that come in and go out of the window that is formed by the books. Some of these stay for a long time, some do not; some interact with a lot of other threads, some do not. It is a complex world, with real characters, with their own perception and information and ideas about reality and their own version of what is true and what is not. So there will always be things that seem to appear out of the blue, even though there is a complete history behind it. And sometime pieces of that history will be told (later), sometimes not. So if not everything seems to make sense at any point, do not worry. Just read on. The story will (eventually) make sense. And then be turned on its head."
Malazan,2rtknm,itkovian,5,Fri Jan 9 09:23:58 2015 UTC,It will all make sense in due time. Just enjoy the ride. The second half is insane.

Malazan,2rtknm,AllWrong74,5,Fri Jan 9 13:01:24 2015 UTC,"It's intentional!   You aught to read the first novel like it's a detective story: try your best to remember each and every character, and read each sentence like there's a hidden clue in it.  All the other books will read a lot more smoothly. Especially if you put down a good ""foundation"" by reading the GotM very carefully."
Malazan,2rtknm,JebusGobson,3,Fri Jan 9 09:03:30 2015 UTC,Just enjoy the ride. It's a great series to re-read because you'll catch things the second time around and may find yourself moderately less confused.

Malazan,2rtknm,Artemisian11,3,Fri Jan 9 10:18:25 2015 UTC,"I second what everyone else says.  I would read the first couple of books with no assistance but as you get further on in the series Good Reads has a really good read-along that does a great job of policing itself for spoilers.  http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/85396-the-malazan-fallen  I really enjoyed the good reads group.  6 or 7 books in you might forget where a character came from or be fuzzy on the details of something and this is a great way to refer back (especially if you are on an E-reader).  Also, people will point out some connections or references you might miss on your own.  Again, they are pretty good about not spoiling the flow or natural exposition of the books.  I'm excited for you journey!"

I'm banking on what everyone else on this sub is saying:  GotM is really confusing, but it gets much less confusing very quickly afterward.  I think it's because GotM was written 10 years before it was even published, which means there was 10+ years between finishing GotM and the publication of the second book.  If Deadhouse Gates is just as confusing as this, I might give up in general."
Malazan,2ru5zr,Imaygetyelledat,5,Fri Jan 9 07:43:31 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, it ties up.

I mean Im aware that some things will have to be cut, and don't get me wrong, I love the series but i can easily find things that one could cut for the sake of a series which really would have close to no impact; for example; I am currently reading DHG and as an example there are two different encounters between Mappo & Icarium against D'ivers, in neither was anything revealed about Mappo and Icariums history or intentions. In this case one could cut one of those two scenes. Bam. I feel like whether you like it or not, this series is still written by a human not a god, inevitably there are parts which sure, are still fun, interesting, nice to read, but leaving out a sentence shouldn't be sacrilegious god damn it. Not every single word written in the series is some Holy Heirloom.  The way I imagined it to make it a bit more clear:   The art style would be something between Anime and Western animation. Each season would be 1 book, each season consisting of 10 -15 1 hour episodes (depending on budget, 15 would be preferable. Its definitely do-able when you look at some of the longest running Animes out there) Just let me dream :´("
Malazan,2rr46e,HumbleAsFudge,1 point,Thu Jan 8 22:40:44 2015 UTC,I've always said if I ever won the lottery I would just spend it on getting it made into like 10 seasons of 20 episodes each.

Malazan,2rr46e,Sithun,2,Thu Jan 8 23:37:45 2015 UTC,Well I'd kill to be the artist for them.. lol
Malazan,2rr46e,TygettLannister,2,Thu Jan 8 20:07:07 2015 UTC,"Man, it would be nice. Can see it being drawn by Oliver Coipel or Esad Ribic or Jim Cheung, or if we want to go truly classic, Walter Simonson!   I'd like it more to be an animated series though. Don't know what style though...hmmm....maybe like Disney's Gargoyles? God I loved that show. So ahead of it's time, so dark and deep and adult. Funny too."
Malazan,2rr46e,TriscuitCracker,2,Thu Jan 8 22:16:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think there'd be much gained, really. A tv series I'd probably watch, though (and likely be disappointed in).  But I would love to see more artistic renderings of characters, creatures and races. Erikson's physical descriptions are a little sparse in this regard and the glossary isn't helpful at all. I've had much more luck on google images with other books I've read, so I guess Malazan hasn't attracted too many artists as of yet."

I want a Bridgeburner insignia I can sow onto a jacket.
Malazan,2rrdeq,hatchet4life,28,Thu Jan 8 17:18:55 2015 UTC,Funnily enough I always pictured Kalam as a very big muscular Idris Elba.
Malazan,2rrdeq,BlueLaguna,10,Thu Jan 8 17:29:29 2015 UTC,"Oh man same, I've always imagined Kalam as Idris Elba and Quick Ben as Lance Reddick"
Malazan,2rrdeq,SageOfTheWise,4,Thu Jan 8 18:04:41 2015 UTC,"Those two would be great, I bet they even have chemistry from doing The Wire, even if they didn't really cross paths on screen."
Malazan,2rrdeq,SerBronnofBlackwater,2,Thu Jan 8 18:58:14 2015 UTC,I don't think Lance Reddick would be able to pull off the dry wit or insubordination. He's too intense as an actor.   Also Idris Elba as Kalam? He's never done anything like that. He'd be more of someone in the command structure than being an assassin that is supposed to be built like a brick shit house. Can you see Idris Elba crushing someone's spine by falling on them just because he's gigantic? Cause I sure can't.
Malazan,2rrdeq,BirdBathandBeyond,4,Thu Jan 8 21:42:11 2015 UTC,"Idris is a big man. I don't know if you've seen rock n rolla but he definitely has a commanding presence in that (he looks bigger than Gerrard Butler in that movie).  Also in Pacific Rim he is super intimidating.  However I think he might be too old now, it all depends when in the series he would be depicting Kalam. If it's the beginning then I don't think he would work but by the end he would be perfect.  Of course I'm sure they could make him look younger."
Malazan,2rrdeq,AgITGuy,2,Thu Jan 8 21:49:27 2015 UTC,That is actually thing though - Kalam more and more wonders if he is too old for some of the stuff they do.

Charles Dance (tywin from game of thrones) would make a good Kallor I think.  I could also see Jamie Fox pulling off Quick Ben, he has the confidence to do it."
Malazan,2rrdeq,greater_golem,10,Thu Jan 8 19:40:38 2015 UTC,Charles Dance as Kallor is fantastic. He'll be able to play the sneering side without losing the sense of pathos.

Malazan,2rrdeq,Broncobacker,4,Thu Jan 8 22:40:14 2015 UTC,"Eva Green for Tavore Paran? No way.  Eva Green is HOT, and pretty much every role that she's taken has emphasized her sex appeal.  Tavore Paran was very clearly (and often) described as plain, unfeminine, somewhat dumpy, and basically uncaring about her attractiveness. And other than the fact that everyone knew about her involvement with T'amber, her on screen appearance is entirely non-sexual. Eva Green could be Lady Spite or Envy or something, but not Tavore."

Naveen Andrews (Lost) as Kalam - we've seen he can be a badass Joseph Gordon Levitt as Ganoes Paran - he has the chops to make Paran shine OP - Spacey as Kruppe? Viggo Mortensen as Whiskeyjack - Aragorn grown old(er) and distinguished Tom Hiddleston as Tehol - maybe still too old but we know he can do whimsical genius for days Doug Jones as Anomander Rake - he's perfect to give off the otherworldly vibe required. It's going to be another costume/effects job. Rinko Kikuchi as Sorry/Apsalar - a bit old perhaps Michael C. Hall or Damian Lewis as Fiddler - whoever misses out gets to play Stormy or Gesler! William Defoe as Iskaral Pust - you know it would be awesome.
Malazan,2rrdeq,SerBronnofBlackwater,5,Thu Jan 8 19:57:24 2015 UTC,"I was trying to think of a good Paran, Joe Levitt would be perfect!"

Malazan,2rrdeq,greater_golem,2,Mon Apr 20 19:05:37 2015 UTC,I think Damian Lewis would make a good Fiddler and Micheal C. Hall a good Stormy. He has more bulk which I've always associated with Gesler and Stormy instead of Fiddler.

Icarium slowly recovers enough pieces of his memory that Mappo breaks down and spills the beans that he (Icarium) has a history of going crazy and destroying things and then forgetting he has done so.  They accompany Fiddler and company to Tremorlor, where in the heat of battle against hordes of D'ivers and Soletaken Mappo bashes Icarium over the head and knocks him unconscious to stop him from destroying the Azath and everything else in the vicinity in a fit of battle rage.  Later, Mappo has the opportunity to finally fulfill his quest (to imprison Icarium with the Azath) but prevents the Azath from taking him out of the love and friendship that's developed between them.

Malazan,2rpgsy,MadFlavorr,10,Thu Jan 8 03:53:34 2015 UTC,"Basically, the artifacts Oponn hands out gives them the ability to influence the mortal world.  The coin is invested with Oponn's power. When Crokus is carrying it, Oponn can act through him. It's not possession- Oponn doesn't act that directly. Oponn is the god of luck/fate- it prefers to be more subtle. Because Crokus has the coin, Oponn can cause him to have supernaturally good luck- like when the Tiste Andii assassins can't quite seem to hit him with their weapons.   Chance pretty similar. While Paran was carrying it, Oponn could act through him. This gives Paran the good luck to manage to deal a deadly wound to a Hound and to block the 5 Rhivi spears on accident. During Paran's confrontation with the Hounds and Rake, Rake notes that there is another side to carrying Chance (another side, haha): if Paran pisses off Oponn, they can cause him to have supernaturally bad luck.  The reason why everyone wanted to take the coin was because a connection to a god works both ways. Oponn can influence Paran through the sword, but Paran can also influence Oponn. That's how Paran is able to bring Oponn into Dragnipur's warren- he exploits the connection. Oponn didn't think there was any risk giving the artifacts to a couple of know-nothing scrubs, but if someone with real power got their hands on them, they would be in real trouble.   Why did Oponn hand out the coin and Chance? They had some kind of plan they wanted to enact in the mortal world, and they needed mortal influence to do it."

Sadly, knowing how Rake is such a main character and all powerful and stuff, the first is more likely."

You said ""they didn't do anything in the end"" and the alternative is that it all went according to plan. It isn't that they didn't do anything, it is that they were locked out of the game right away by Shadowthrone, so they couldn't do anything.  There were a large number of Ascendents that weren't really involved for whatever reason. Oponn was among them.  I don't know where you got the idea that everything might have gone according to their plan, because that would mean that they spent all 9+ books completely out of sight anonymously influencing chances, which (besides being incredibly boring and lame story telling) has absolutely no evidence and adds literally nothing to the story."

Malazan,2rpgsy,Foliagus,2,Thu Jan 8 15:25:10 2015 UTC,"Dragnipur is a one of a kind sword. Chance, from what I can recall just gets thrown into a lake and forgotten. Chance doesn't really do anything in so far as I can recall, or is ever discussed.  Oponn, the twin gods of fate, I see as using Paran just as a means to try throwing a wrench into the plans of the other ascendants and Gods as they are making their power plays. They have no real goal in mind, they are just the god's of fate and so like to fuck with anyone and everyone. After all, that is nature of chance... random perturbations causing unforeseen consequences."

Malazan,2rmxjf,PaxCecilia,15,Mon Jan 12 12:10:28 2015 UTC,"Both of these- there seems to be an evangelical movement who are obsessed with letting you know why Malazan is objectively the better than ASOIAF and diminishing the greatness of that series. Malazan is bigger in scope, true, but that doesn't mean that it's better, or that at very least, Erikson occasionally didn't execute something as well as GRRM did. Malazan is so complex that the last thing it should be is immune to criticism."
Malazan,2rmxjf,returnofonostoolan,10,Wed Jan 7 16:02:31 2015 UTC,"I think the comparison shouldn't be really brought up until ASOIAF is completed. A large part of any series's worth is the grand payoffs, the mindblowing twists and huge events that were worth 3 or 7 or 10 books to properly set up.   On the other hand, I will say that Malazan is somewhat superior in that it never flagged in pacing the way ASOIAF did with books 4 and 5. Sure, some sections of TTH can be mind numbing, but the last 100 pages or so? Epic beyond anything I'd read to that point (until the last 200 pages of TCG). On the other hand, books 4 and 5 of ASOIAF start a lot of new plot threads then dump them with no real resolution after almost 2000 pages (with both books combined).  And people waited 5 then 6 years for them. Sure, Erikson had pretty much the entire series mapped out from the beginning (there's an interview from 2000 when he says he has all 10 novels planned out) AND help from Esslemont on worldbuilding and such, but still cranking out 10 amazing and fiendishly complex and interconnected fantasy books plus a few novellas in the space of 12 years without having a nervous breakdown... you have to hand it to the guy.   /rant"
Malazan,2rmxjf,wheeloficeandfire,7,Wed Jan 7 17:48:44 2015 UTC,"I'd say they're both great, but Malazan is a lot heavier on the deus-ex-machina.   In GRRM's books, there's no divine intervention that saves from (or drives people to) death - it's down to mundane machinations, human errors and human flaws. That makes it a lot more involved, IMHO."
Malazan,2rmxjf,JebusGobson,4,Thu Jan 8 08:20:04 2015 UTC,Erickson is objectively the better work horse. It can't be argued.
Malazan,2rmxjf,TheHopelessGamer,5,Thu Jan 8 02:53:16 2015 UTC,I actually find that it's the other way around. A lot asoiaf fans took up Malazan due to the tWoW wait and claim that asoiaf is more complex than Malazan...
Malazan,2rmxjf,SerBronnofBlackwater,2,Wed Jan 7 17:01:37 2015 UTC,"Having read both of these, I can honestly say that ASOIAF doesn't compare even though I still really like ASOIAF. But in all seriousness, it's an opinion, and it's going to differ from person to person. Who cares which you like better? Just don't go around putting other peoples opinions down (Not that I am saying you are, just that your post kind of connects to what I want to say)."
Malazan,2rmxjf,JaceQQ,8,Wed Jan 7 17:36:47 2015 UTC,"I think Malazan is about grander epics, the pivotal shock moments are so huge their impact is kind of a political intrigue, rimmed with the sense of personal loss we feel through the narrator at the time. Conversely, ASOIAF is about the personal impact, with the political/intrigue backdrop. ASOIAF is all about the character's personal journeys within a tumultuous world, whereas malazan is about a tumultuous world littered with personal stories. They both have a fantastic amount of drama for both the characters and the setting, just that GRRM is more about the internal and Erikson about the external. Just my opinion and how I ""felt"" the pivotal moments in both series."

Malazan,2rmxjf,Fnarley,10,Thu Jan 15 09:59:20 2015 UTC,"Whenever there is a recommendation thread on /r/fantasy and I realize that what the OP is asking for actually does perfectly describe Malazan, I feel kind of wrong for actually recommending it since I feel like I'm now one of those obnoxious fans that recommends the series in every topic ever no matter how inappropriate it is. I'm sure we've all seen a thread like ""hey guys I'm brand new to fantasy looking for something simple and light hearted"" and the top rated post is ""you're going to just love Malazan then!"""
Malazan,2rmxjf,SageOfTheWise,3,Wed Jan 7 18:17:02 2015 UTC,"Thread in /r/fantasy asking for series that don't read like a soap opera and are largely devoid of romantic sub plots. Yes, they happen in Malazan, but there are maybe a dozen instances interspersed randomly through-out the series. And those sub plots are often not the focus of what is happening, and are used to feed into a much larger plot about something completely different.  Getting downvoted and told its the ""second worst place to recommend Malazan."" and ""oh tattersail!""  Holy fucking shit they apparently have no reading comprehension as I clearly state what I did above. I think there are just a number of people on /r/fantasy that see Malazan recommended and just instantly say no without reading the rest of what is said, let alone reading what the OP of the thread said  ""The only books I recall reading that didn't feel like soap operas were the old Dragonlance & Forgotten Realms books I read as a kid. Not the pinnacle of writing to be sure, but at least they focused more on adventure, discovery, magic, world building, etc, than sappy romances."" Which that last sentence, about focusing on adventure, discovery, magic, world building etc, is so very freaking true of Malazan."
Malazan,2rmxjf,Bilbato,5,Wed Jan 7 20:01:12 2015 UTC,"Romance? Let's be real, Malazan is all about the bromance:  Hedge and Fid, Kal and Quick, Toc and Tool, Onrack and Trull, Mappo and Icarium, Tehol and Bugg. These friendships are what resonates with me and are IMO the driving force behind the series"
Malazan,2rmxjf,Fnarley,2,Thu Jan 15 10:16:51 2015 UTC,"I saw that thread before there were like any comments in it, decided to just avoid it since I couldn't really figure out what he meant by soap operay and could tell that thread was going to become a shitshow of everyone discrediting any possible suggestion if at any point in the series a girl and guy express any kind of emotion at each other.  Actually completley forgot about that like one chapter Tattersail and Paran are romantically involved. Actually thought any mention of Malazan would be thrown out the window because of Trull/Seren."
Malazan,2rmxjf,SageOfTheWise,2,Wed Jan 7 20:40:32 2015 UTC,"If you look at what the OP of that thread said though, it doesn't matter if at some point a guy and a girl fall in love. To quote the OP ""By soap opera, I mean a fixation of the author on romantic relationships..."" Yes, Erikson has romantic subplots, but in no way does he fixate on them. He uses those to tell a much larger story and those relationships are just stepping stones to that larger picture.  If the OP wanted a book that was completely devoid of any sort of romance whatsoever, my recommendation would be scientific non-fiction. But even then, the concept of love and romance seeps back in because it is such a fundamental part of being human. I would say historical non-fiction, but even then the amount of romance and love that permeates history is ubiquitous and unavoidable."
Malazan,2rmxjf,Bilbato,1 point,Wed Jan 7 20:55:17 2015 UTC,As somebody who picked up the series in November on the back of one of those threads. Please never stop recommending this series.

I have personally called people out who rip on the entire series after reading a small portion of it, but I wouldn't judge a person's ability to comprehend something after they politely state that they did not enjoy it.   Also, the butthurt about spoilers is annoying. Yes they should be tagged and usually are. No, finding out that character X dies in book Y will not ruin anything, and is no reason to lose your cool. I promise."
Malazan,2rmxjf,TurboS40,7,Thu Jan 8 01:06:12 2015 UTC,Recommending Malazan every time someone asks for any kind of recommendation on /r/fantasy. Want to get into fantasy? Malazan.

If it fits the OP's interests then it's fine but usually the OP will put something like ""I really liked the Redwall series of books and want something similar in tone and feel to that."" Then ten different people recommend Malazan since it's the greatest thing ever even though it is just ridiculously different than waht OP was looking for. If you avoid that and just adding another pitch for it when there are ten already present you are fine. Even worse than Malazan fans with this are Name of the Wind (King Killer Chronicles) fans.

Malazan,2rmxjf,JaceQQ,2,Thu Jan 8 03:57:58 2015 UTC,"... I'm a new reader, in MoI now.  I would really really like to have a sensible conversation about recommending MoI or DG as a reasonable starting place for new readers, or just read a forum thread where that conversation already happened.  I say this, as a reader who was intrigued by GotM, enough to pick up the next book and the next one.  But reading MoI, I'm realizing that whatever time I spent thinking about GotM and sifting through the Tor re-read (and encountering endless forums of oneupsmanship like HumbleasFudge satirizes) etc etc may have been better spent just starting with the recaps in MoI in the first place.    I'm a pretty spoiler-tolerant reader though, so I get that this approach isn't for everyone.  My question is:  how do you know which approach is more likely to get a new reader hooked?"
Malazan,2rmxjf,MightyIsobel,4,Wed Jan 7 18:02:39 2015 UTC,"I think they are better than the first, but I don't know if they'd be good entry points. You might spend some or most of GotM confused, or maybe not, but at the same time you're getting used to Erikson's style. This helps to better enjoy DHG and MoI. Plus, you would probably introduce confusion when issues from GotM start cropping up in DHG and MoI."
Malazan,2rmxjf,majiinbuu,1 point,Thu Jan 8 02:26:23 2015 UTC,"introduce confusion   But I think that DG and MoI are much better expressions of Erikson's style, and that Book One of MoI in particular clears up a lot of the confusion created by the chaotic construction of GotM.  I'm finding it frustrating to discover that the explanations given to readers in their WTF GotM?!?! threads aren't the result of carefully constructed reveals, as Malazan oneupsmans seem to suggest.  The explanations are literally verbatim exposition dumps from the first 150 pages of MoI.    So the choice is between beginning in media res in GotM, or in media res in the much better written MoI, with the option of going back and reading GotM when you have a shot at actually grokking what the hell is going on.  What perplexes me is why GotM is so heavily recommended as the Only One True starting place.  Maybe the answer is RAFO.  But if it's just about hazing newbies, that's not a very good reason."
Malazan,2rmxjf,MightyIsobel,1 point,Thu Jan 8 04:03:32 2015 UTC,"Well, there is some major characterization of important chars in book one, that you would lost starting in MoI. Tattersail, Crokus, Fiddler, Whiskeyjack, Paran, Tok, Kalam, Quick, Tool and more have already been reasonbly developed by books 2-3. I agree that book one is a bit more obtuse, but I would be even more lost if I just flat out skipped it."
Malazan,2rmxjf,Dumpsta121,1 point,Thu Jan 8 16:48:54 2015 UTC,"major characterization of important chars in book one   While I agree that these characters do a lot of things in GotM, I am struck by how, when we meet them again in DG and MoI, they get substantial recaps telling us what they were doing in GotM, and that those recaps are basically obligatory for retroactively understanding the plot of GotM.  I mean, I trust Erikson as an author.  He knows how GotM reads, and he fixed the problems in later installments.    So, why are fans so resistant to considering that GotM is not the right starting place for some readers who might otherwise never get hooked on the series?"
Malazan,2rmxjf,MightyIsobel,2,Thu Jan 8 16:57:42 2015 UTC,When people use terms or phrases related to the book to describe things like 'oh who cast the omtose phellack ritual on new england?' cause of how cold it is.  That shit is beyond annoying and plain cringeworthy.

Even if it's just for a particular Ascendant's motivation, remember the concept of convergence? Well, the last nine books have been building up to a big one. The Tor reread has chapter summaries which might help - at least read the summaries for book 9 - but keep in mind that you will probably miss things."
Malazan,2rl9w3,Mavrande,2,Wed Jan 7 03:58:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, one day I'll re-read all ten books, but I doubt I'll be starting that in 2015, I'll just be too busy. The problem with the Tor re-reads is that they're actually too in-depth, just reading the entire thing is a pretty herculean task, and it's really more about how people reacted than what is written. I'm not looking for scene by scene, chapter by chapter analysis, what I'd like is just each of the plot threads in broad strokes, as we enter the final stretch, without even maybe paying attention to which book specifically the events happen in."
Malazan,2rl9w3,Bilbato,3,Wed Jan 7 04:08:59 2015 UTC,"Just because of how much occurs within each book, I think it is impossible to condense any of the books down to a couple sentence summary, let alone the major story arcs. There would be far too many things that you would be forced to leave out and in a sense would become meaningless because of the amount of things left out."
Malazan,2rl9w3,Bilbato,1 point,Wed Jan 7 04:25:39 2015 UTC,Maybe to someone who hadn't read the books before an didn't know who the characters are.   So basically you're saying there's no possible way to know what I'm getting into without reading books 1-9?
Malazan,2rl9w3,autowikiabot,1 point,Wed Jan 7 04:45:02 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. I mean you can go ahead and read The Crippled God, but most things that occur will make no sense as to whos doing what, why they are doing what they are doing, and all other sorts of issues.  Your best bet as much as you may not like it, is the Tor reread. If not that, it would be going back and reading the rest of the books all over again, which would be far more arduous of a task then taking several days and looking through the tor reread.  There is also the Malazan wiki. But that is notorious for spoilers and just not being good or reliable in any way. Not to mention the amount of things that would most likely end up being glossed over.  http://malazan.wikia.com/wiki/Malazan_Book_of_the_Fallen"
Malazan,2rl9w3,Lankles,1 point,Wed Jan 7 04:52:28 2015 UTC,"Malazan Book of the Fallen:       The Malazan world was originally created by Erikson and Esslemont in 1982 as a backdrop for a role-playing game using a modified version of the Dungeons & Dragons rule set. By 1986 the Malazan world had developed to a world approaching that found in the novels. At this point Erikson and Esslemont developed a movie script titled Gardens of the Moon, which was to play on the interactions of the patrons of a drinking establishment in the fictional city of Darujhistan. The script failed to be picked up and the authors agreed to write novels instead. Erikson developed Gardens of the Moon into a novel around 1991–1992, though it was not published until 1999, when Transworld Books picked up the series in the United Kingdom after a fierce bidding war. During discussions with Transworld, Erikson developed his plans for the series into a story arc comprising ten novels. Tor Books began publishing the series in the USA in 2004. Esslemont, meanwhile, had written two Malazan novels in the late 1980s: Night of Knives and Return of the Crimson Guard. A revised and edited version of Night of Knives was published in 2005 as a special limited edition by PS Publishing, with Transworld picking up both books in 2007 for mass-market publication. Esslemont's initial deal with Transworld provided for six novels in total.

Ganoes Paran goes to investigate the aforementioned hound-massacre at the behest of Adjunct Lorn.   Anomander kills a couple of hounds with Dragnipur, ensnaring their souls in the pocket warren wagon within.   Paran ends up in a close shave or two with hounds as well, befriends Toc the younger, and after some magical encounters involving his sword ""Chance"", some shadow hound blood and a quick trip through Dragnipur's warren, seems to have gained a kind of werewolf-ish ability. Tattersail and he also have a brief affair.   Rallick Nom kills some guy, whose corpse bleeds into Krul's temple, reawakening the Elder God. Kruppe and Krul converse and make plots in dreams.  Whiskeyjack and the Bridgeburners arrive in Darujhistan to undermine the ruling cabal.  Sorry kills Paran, but he is resurrected by Oponn.   Crokus is in lust with Challice D'arle, but meets Sorry and is in love. He also has some (mis)adventures due to Oponn's coin.   Tattersail is killed by Bellurdan (at Tayschrenn's request IIRC) but she transfers her soul into Nightchill's magically preserved remains.   Adjunct Lorn and Onos Toolan release Raest so he attacks and weakens Darujhistan. Anomander, Silanah and some Tiste manage to beat him, but he possesses Crokus' uncle and Rallick has to imprison him in an Azath house, of which he later becomes the sarcastic butler.   Most of the cabal and heaps of assassins are killed in the process. Notable survivors include Vorcan (assassin boss) and Baruk the alchemist.    Crokus discards Oponn's coin.   Sorry kills Lorn.

Duiker, the imperial historian is also crucified but his soul saved for future use due to the soul-repository that Coltaine gave him.   During this not-so-merry escapade ...  Fiddler sets in motion a chain of events due to an interaction with a Tanno Spiritwalker leading to the ascension of the Bridgeburners.   Felisin becomes the new Sha'ik, although Baudin is killed. Heboric is still around, although he has been pretty seriously soaked in otataral.   Demoted marines Gesler and Stormy are forged into flame-retardant ascendants by the fires of Telas."

The thing is, I read this before, so it's more about jogging my memory than an ELI5 post. Thanks so much, if I could have more chats like this, I'd be caught up in a day. Out of despair and frustration I turned to the TOR re-read and it's just absolutely the wrong thing. I don't have time for it, it's unnecessarily verbose, and it really is focused more on how the readers reacted to the books than the content of the books themselves."
Malazan,2rl9w3,schadkehnfreude,2,Wed Jan 7 05:17:32 2015 UTC,That's good! What did I miss? It will probably help jog my memory as well as I'm adding.
Malazan,2rl9w3,Ezzelino,2,Wed Jan 7 05:33:03 2015 UTC,"Tayschrenn actually hit the mages and killed Nightchill (this might not be divulged 'till later, but it's worth mentioning). Also Hairlock survived the massacre (or is he less significant than I remember?)  Nightchill is also the Sister of Cold Nights (title?) and thus an ancient ascendant, one who cursed Kallor for some unremembered crime like what? 10000 years ago?  Also minor stuff like Vorcan being a High Mage (significant later, given iirc she appears as something less human later on)"
Malazan,2rl9w3,TurboS40,1 point,Wed Jan 7 05:40:29 2015 UTC,"Hairlock introduces us to the concept of chaos magic and soul shifting.   And kallor was cursed 301,000 years (roughly) before the events of gotm"

I have this pet theory what some of the stuff means, but that book is a doozy.   I'm wondering if maybe I can go about this in a productive way- giving my tl;dr account of what I do remember of the dramatis personae who come into play, with some pointers towards things I have missing/wrong."
Malazan,2rj5v9,DrinkyDrank,5,Tue Jan 6 17:34:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I felt like MoI was the most straightforward and easy to follow. It's a fairly simple military story of attacking the Pannion Domin. Sure, there are characters and plot points from GotM, but for the book's story as a whole, MoI was the most simple."
Malazan,2rj5v9,CaptainUnusual,4,Tue Jan 6 22:29:16 2015 UTC,"I agree MT stands out, especially if you view it in a vacuum. You wouldn't really be able to read the others due to so many interconnected threads, except FoD and GotM.  If you take your time with GotM, it tells a fantasy military story that can be left self contained and open ended, while laying the seeds for the series.  FoD is literally the prequel of the world.  It has some characters that occur in other books, but it doesn't rely on them to explain itself.  The only problem is the cliffhanger ending."
Malazan,2rj5v9,sonofa2,6,Tue Jan 6 19:17:16 2015 UTC,"I felt this way as well. I find it superb writing because since Lether is disconnected from the warrens and the rest of the world, you actually feel it."
Malazan,2rj5v9,SerBronnofBlackwater,4,Tue Jan 6 19:45:00 2015 UTC,"The other thing about Lether is how it clearly is analogous to America/capitalism in the way it uses economics to disguise its imperialism.  This context makes it a lot easier to grasp the depth of Erikson's political/war themes, the other books often make me feel like I'm back in college trying to decode Foucault instead of reading a fantasy series."

Malazan,2rj5v9,stanglemeir,1 point,Tue Jan 6 23:30:20 2015 UTC,"MT is the easiest read in my opinion. For me it was that I understood the world really well at this point. I understood what elder gods, Tiste, Ascendants, warrens, holds..... and the dozens of other aspects of the Malazan world were. But, unlike the other books, the characters within MT are almost always new. There aren't nearly as many of the random 'Hey remember this guy from book 2? No? Well tough shit he's important now"" moments that the series is full of. He also handles comic relief very well in the book with Tehol and Bugg.  Remember that GotM was written years before any of the other books and it took him a while to get a publisher for it. It wasn't necessarily an intended beginning to the 10 book saga that is Malazan. It was literally just a guy who wrote a movie script nope make that book about the D&D world he and his friend had been playing with for years."
Malazan,2rj5v9,WelfareBear,1 point,Tue Jan 6 21:11:14 2015 UTC,"Man, I hated Midnight Tides for exactly this reason; everything, from the writing to the cast, was so alien to the series I fucking loved up until that point. I'm all for taking artistic liberties and shaking things up from a creative standpoint, but the descriptions of the world and its inhabitants just sounded hollow. Compared to the vibrant, lively attitude of Darujhistan, or the crass yet poignant banter of the Bridgeburners, I struggle to believe Midnight Tides was written by the author of the rest of the series."
Malazan,2rhxjp,Clearly_a_fake_name,6,Tue Jan 6 08:45:01 2015 UTC,"Felisin   What happens is Felisin and the Whirlwind Goddess find.. an accord I suppose.. so while she isn't actually Sha'ik 'reborn' she is still the mortal representative of the Goddess. That's how she has the memories, not from the dead woman but from the Goddess. Because of this she has the same powers as the previous Sha'ik. I don't recall any strange alchemy water being consumed, however the part where they follow the undead dragon through some warrens is kind of important and possibly what you're referring to. Felisin becomes Sha'ik Reborn out of mutual convenience, but that travel had lasting effects on all of the characters (who lived).   Azath/Icarium   Yes, they're just the Azath House names. No, it's a lot more complex but basically it wants to contain powerful beings, that's its goal. Who it lets in is a lot more nebulous and the rules behind it are fairly unclear/unexplained throughout the series. That all the houses are linked inside is a feature of them, but not necessarily the most important one. It allowed him in because it needed a new guardian (the old one had died). Gothos' goals aren't really clear cut either, he isn't a very active character, he's important in both the main and other series but he's doesn't take an active role in many things. He's on the Azath's side, so to speak (and about as passive as an Azath House too), and would have preferred him imprisoned for altruistic reasons. Icarium is incredibly dangerous and unpredictable since his attempted destruction of the Azath which is why his minder (Mappo, tasked by the Nameless Ones) is supposed to ultimately trap him within one. If Icarium had been swallowed out there - successfully - he wouldn't have been with Gothos anyway, he would have been trapped in the grounds of Tremorlor. Option B.   I found the story much better on a reread, tbh DG was probably my least favourite during my first read of the series because of the Chain of Dogs."
Malazan,2rhxjp,MoranthMunitions,2,Tue Jan 6 11:49:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks very much for your fantastic answers.   I don't recall any strange alchemy water being consumed,    It was about mid way through I think. They came upon a cave which had statues of people made out of stone. Heboric said there was some special water that would have ""benefits"" to drinking it. They all drank it.   Also, if you don't mind me asking 1 more question.  The Whirlwind represents the rebellion and Sha'ik's movement. But am I right in thinking there is an actual literal whirlwind, swirling around the desert?"
Malazan,2rhxjp,CousinNoonga,2,Tue Jan 6 11:59:23 2015 UTC,"There is a whirlwind, and I recall Sha'ik having an affect on it. I think I remember Felisin was able to make it bigger and more furious. She definitely mentioned her affect on it."
Malazan,2rhxjp,MoranthMunitions,2,Tue Jan 6 12:04:13 2015 UTC,"Okay, I took a look through the book and found the section. From the rest of the sequence I think the main thing was that the water was supposed to refresh them more quickly and/or make them hardier in the desert. It was implied that the original alchemies just made the citizens live longer and was what helped them petrify rather than rot. I don't think there's anything verifiable later on that can be attributed back to that.  And yeah, there's a literal whirlwind."

At first, it was just Duiker walking from battlescene to battlescene. I didn't understand if he was fighting for Malazan, or fighting for the rebels.  That said, I was really invested in the CoD towards the end. I definitely want to re-read this book. At least the first 50%."

I assumed from the start that she pretended to be Sha'ik, and the more I read on, the more I started to think she became Sha'ik reborn. I also remember reading something about her not actually being reborn, something along those lines.  From what I could gather, Icarium's dad wanted him ""captured"" not for his sake, but for the world's sake. He was too powerful and full of anger?  I share your thoughts about not being that upset with The Chain of Dogs climax. Although their story line was my favourite part of the book, I didn't feel devastated as others have mentioned. I sort of saw it coming, but was amazed by it none the less. I guess knowing that both Coltaine and Duiker's souls(?) were saved, it softened the blow.  All in all, definitely a great read. I know there are many things I have missed, and many things will be answered in the following books. I am ready."
Malazan,2rgrsy,Romoth,2,Tue Jan 6 01:38:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Erickson is pretty amazing at humor in the series.  Dialogue is basically one of the main reasons I love it so much."

Malazan,2rc2n4,GentlemanTwoTies,3,Sun Jan 4 21:35:57 2015 UTC,"OK, I've gleaned this from here (WARNING: SPOILERS). As a side note, you don't need to read the ICE novels. They're mostly secondary plot. Some of it comes up in the main book series, but you should be good not knowing (I was). Anyway...  First off, Night of Knives is set before Gardens of the Moon, so that's that gone already. :P  Read on from Gardens of the Moon. As the sidebar says, Midnight Tides is technically happening at the same time as Gardens of the Moon, but it follows on from House of Chains.  Once you finish Bonehunters, you can read Return of the Crimson Guard, then Stonewielder.  Then, read to Toll the Hounds from the main series, and then Orb, Sceptre, Throne.  Read on in the main series until you finish The Crippled God. Blood and Bone is apparently set simultaneously with The Crippled God and Orb, Sceptre, Throne, so read that next.  Finally, Assail. And that's the main series and the ICE series done."
Malazan,2rc2n4,KBKarma,1 point,Sun Jan 4 21:57:36 2015 UTC,"Awesome! cheers pal! it seems daunting when put like that, but im just going to think of it like a series of steps, knocking them off one at a time!   again thank you!"
Malazan,2rc2n4,Aiolus,5,Sun Jan 4 22:09:26 2015 UTC,Read ICE after you read Eriksons books. It'd be choppy to jump from Eriksons to ICE imo.   Erickson has even recommended reading his in the order they are meant to be read. (if I remember correctly)
Malazan,2rc2n4,MoranthMunitions,2,Mon Jan 5 01:56:04 2015 UTC,"It's generally not recommended (from past posts/people's opinions there) to read the ICE books with the Erikson ones on your first read through, a lot of people don't like them as much so they can be pretty slow going considering how much smaller they are.  The reading order for reading them together, from the old sidebar that got changed because it's not a great idea for first time readers, is:  GotM = Gardens of the Moon DG = Deadhouse Gates MoI = Memories of Ice HoC = House of Chains MT = Midnight Tides * NoK = Night of Knives BH = The Bonehunters RG = Reaper's Gale RotCG = Return of the Crimson Guard SW = Stonewielder TtH = Toll the Hounds OST = Orb, Sceptre, Throne DoD = Dust of Dreams tCG = The Crippled God BaB = Blood and Bone ASL = Assail  So it's not too late if you really want to. But 16 books is a large undertaking, considering the main 10 books are something like 3.3 million words. There's only one major thing that occurs in RotCG that gets ruined by one of Erikson's books if you don't read them together, but it's not bad really. Actually a lot of people don't pick up on it anyway.  I'd say unless you're dead set on reading them all together just read the Erikson ones and leave them for a reread or read them individually afterwards."

I know most people don't like ICE as much but I thought Crimson Guard was a worthy addition which advances both the overall plot and the plots of several key shared characters.  If one is really into the series (and willing to read the extra books) I think its worth doing."
Malazan,2rc2n4,MoranthMunitions,1 point,Mon Jan 5 06:28:45 2015 UTC,"I've read them the way I listed on a reread and I liked how the books had those smaller interlinking parts. I agree that it's worth doing too, but I don't think that it would work well for most readers, especially considering how most readers find the ICE books.  In a general breakdown, I didn't enjoy NoK at all, it just didn't feel fleshed out or well written. I felt the only upside was it was so short and required little effort to read. While RotCG was a good story (probably the best of the lot) it still suffered from his writing, which had a fair few noticeable grammatical issues and sometimes the prose was a bit jarring. SW was actually pretty good, though I disliked a couple of the storylines it's probably the most well rounded of them all. OST I found was pretty lacklustre, probably because it trailed from TtH but didn't really work as well, like all the last few of his books there's not much substance to the plot, but it also felt like the writing went downhill again. BaB I actually quite enjoyed once I got into it, the writing was really well done, characterisation was good, and the same for ASL, however both felt like there wasn't much to the plot - especially BaB. Not much happened but they were much more interesting and fun to read than the other books.  It's also annoying that his book layout is inconsistent between the books, especially compared to Erikson's format of having a quote at each book and chapter start which was managed for all 10. RotCG especially, each sub-book thing starting at chapter 1 again, it's a nightmare to reference on the wiki when I'm not careful.  Anyway, I probably liked his books more than most, but I can't recommend that a first time reader go through them all. Though I think if someone thinks they'll read them all eventually they should just read NoK and RotCG with the main series, the rest can be left to afterwards where it'll fill in gaps of knowledge but nothing will have been spoiled for them. At least then if you aren't really getting into his writing you can just leave them for later, read everything ICE beyond RotCG after tCG.  It's a great series though, glad you're enjoying it. Plan to read FoD? Because I think it's best read directly after tCG, and if I'm giving unsolicited advice about reading order I may as well drop that in too haha."
Malazan,2rc2n4,pfk505,1 point,Mon Jan 5 08:02:05 2015 UTC,"I'll agree with you that ICE's writing doesn't compare to Erikson's, but for me that's OK.  I don't mind the sojourn into other parts of this world, but I can certainly understand why others do.  ICE does certain things quite well (action/battle, humor, and banter come to mind) which makes the structural deficiencies somewhat less grating.  I also found NOK to be a slog, especially the first half, but it ended OK.  RotCG was pretty great, aside from a certain amount of confusion with respect to places and characters (which can be minimized if one is a careful reader).  I will definitely save the remainder of ICE's stuff until after I'm done with Erikson's, save for SW which I already bought and will start in a day or two when I'm done with TtH... and on your advice I'll read FOD right after tCG.  By the way, your posts around here are fantastic and absolutely appreciated by me.  You have helped clear things up on more than one occasion around sticky or half-forgotten plot points from past books which can be quite elucidating as I continue my first read.  I hope to re-read these some day but I have so much else to read that to take the better part of a year at some point in the future might be tricky.    In any case, thanks again for your posts."
Malazan,2rah6l,bantuftw,6,Sun Jan 4 10:03:37 2015 UTC,"It's a reasonable presumption that the mages are aspected to specific holds, though I suppose it is never outright mentioned. The Elder races still use their holds (e.g. Kuruld Thryllan or Galain, or Omtose Phellack), but a few humans have access to those as well. Also, with the warrens though mages are aspected to them they aren't limited to them, even regular people are supposedly able to be taught to access them. So even if the mages of the Letherii Empire were aspected to a specific hold they'd be able to access others.  Gethol was Gothos' brother. And yeah, Silchas and Andarist are his younger brothers.  What happened in Raraku, pretty much the desert used to be a sea and it kind of ""remembered"" itself, makes more sense with the first section of BH - and maybe rereading some of HoC's final chapters, if it still doesn't make sense after that - so I won't go further into it.  That was a good pick up with the Crippled God telling Withal that, though it's fairly early in the book. Trull appears in HoC (meaning it occurs entirely after MT), but the Crippled God doesn't make his move on the fragment of Emurlahn until the end of HoC, so it's possible that it's referring to the Pannion Domin which he was affecting to a degree until the end of MT (Bug's squashed Edur he put through Ruse, found by Paran in MoI, came from the end of MT). But I agree, it was likely the plan with Raraku."
Malazan,2rah6l,MoranthMunitions,3,Sun Jan 4 11:24:10 2015 UTC,"holds are different realms, think of them as different dimensions, you can use the energy from them as magic.  warrens are an overlaid structure over the holds, they focus the energy, and can do many more refined things.    Holds are described as just raw energy, so they are good for things like blasting stuff.  Warrens can do that, but can be used for healing, and more sophisticated stuff like sending messages and illusions.  as far as who is more powerful, i would think that the most powerful creature ever was something like a matron, with a full set of servants (she controls them utterly, so they are part of her), i doubt a single other god/entity could touch her and their sorceries have destroyed entire parts of continents.  they also somehow stole the warren of the forkrull assail, as in the time of the books, they mention that they had recently reclaimed Akhrast Korvlain  -Gothos is almost surely the most powerful solo entity, he was old and immensly powerful even before hood was born, and likely even remembers being slaves to the kchain chemaille. Raest and icarium are both his kids, and Erickson said hed pick gothos to be his shaved knuckle. Forkrul Assail are too whimsical to determine, in some cases they are treated as certain death to fight, and others some stupid nobody tistii andii kills one (eye roll)  Family:  gothos is the father of raest (jaghut mother) and icarium (Tarthenal Toblaki mother)  Annomander, Andaarist, Silchas Purake, brothers, father was Nimmander Purake (also the name of annomanders son), noble tistii who gave his life for mother dark, she then adopted them as sons of darkness"

Malazan,2rah6l,photonsnphonons,2,Tue Jan 6 22:53:05 2015 UTC,"About the warrens-I think you just feel this way because most of the  series you aren't dealing with mages at the same power levels as someone like Gothos.  However, the Letherii mages have an equivalent with the sorcerous enfilade at the beginning of Gardens of the Moon.  Tayschrenn and the Malazan mages tearing up the countryside trying to take down Anomander shows the power of warrens pretty well I think."

Much more advanced use of English than Sanderson and Rothfuss, in my opinion.  Something incomparable about New Sun was mentioned by /u/TriscuitCracker .  Philosophically, this entire book is insanely brilliant.  Metaphorical blends with real often.  At times, it's like reading the acid trip montage in Easy Rider, without the motorcycles."

Malazan,2r5juu,TurboS40,2,Sat Jan 3 03:50:40 2015 UTC,"They are an amazing read. There's nothing quite like New Sun. It's very literary and philosophical and lots of descriptive prose and it is very trippy. Like Malazan you are dropped into the world and have to make sense what is going on from context and clues and the narrator who may be not the most reliable. I won't spoil anything, but they are great, thoughtful reads. And by today's fast pacing standards it may be a little slow if your not used to older fantasy/scifi. Give them a shot definitely. Books 1-2 are combined, starting with Shadow of the Torturer."
Malazan,2r5juu,TriscuitCracker,2,Sat Jan 3 04:15:21 2015 UTC,"Excellent books, I just finished reading them actually. I think the sort of person who loves Malazan would love them as well."
Malazan,2r5juu,banjaloupe,1 point,Sat Jan 3 06:00:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wouldn't say it's similar in style except in that it doesn't explain things to you. The Book of the New Sun is more of a world exploration with little plot, if I recall correctly. I thought it was... interesting. Not all that great in my opinion, though."
Malazan,2qyr77,Sprockat,7,Wed Dec 31 23:49:01 2014 UTC,"Crokus: short version. It was a play to destabilize the status quo of things.  Paran: RAFO on that. Answer to this is a fairly tall order. It's one of those events that have many repercussions down the line.  Oponn: they wanted a power shift. Even as unaligned entity there is no way they could do something as grand as having gods/ascendents stop messing with mortals. You only met a few ascendents and gods. All of them kept their influence and power to the very minimum. This includes Rake.  Jaghut are one of four founding races in the world. The other three are Imass, K'chain Che'Malle and Forkul Assail. All of them are immensely powerful in their own way. The Jaghut are most likely the most powerful by individual prowess and comparison. By nature they isolate themselves from everyone. They live in family units and generally are very secluded. Tyants are those that were the opposite of them. They sought out to subjugate and rule others. It is the nature of their wants and desires. The Tyrants were a perversion of Jaghut society, they also are what caused the never ending war between Jaghut and Imass (now T'lan Imass race).  Azath will be explained more in the next book, but it will still be difficult to understand. The concept of azath and their purpose will be revisited throughout various books as the series goes."
Malazan,2qyr77,mmSNAKE,3,Thu Jan 1 01:11:45 2015 UTC,"This is a more detailed answer than mine, and actually left me with a question!   The concept of azath and their purpose will be revisited throughout various books as the series goes.   All Books Spoiler"

Malazan,2qyr77,TooLeft,1 point,Thu Jan 1 01:25:34 2015 UTC,"There was an azath house builder and someone who had him enslaved to do the job. I believe this will be explained down the line in one of the latter books. However the house that spontaneously spawns because of the finnest from Raest, doesnt seem to be part of the greater network that was atleast at one point planned and overseen by someone specific."
Malazan,2qyr77,Silmariel,-1,Thu Jan 1 18:39:54 2015 UTC,I really don't think the Imass belong in that grouping... And id throw in the Tiste for that matter.
Malazan,2qyr77,Seattlelite84,3,Thu Jan 1 02:44:51 2015 UTC,The Tiste races were the invading races. They came from different realms. The Imass were one of the four founding races.
Malazan,2qyr77,mmSNAKE,3,Thu Jan 1 03:08:47 2015 UTC,"I think the question is more oriented toward Elder concepts, not rooted in a world or given plane. At least as far as I take it. And besides, they all up more or less on one world anyway. For that matter elder warrens are all essentialy realms, neh? So all the elder races could be said to ""be of"" different realms. Don't ya think?  The imass were considerably younger--by many hundreds of thousands of years--than any of the others."
Malazan,2qyr77,Seattlelite84,1 point,Thu Jan 1 03:29:45 2015 UTC,"The founding races means, that the current standing races (humans, berghast, toblakai etc) evolved from.  They were the first natural if you will races which evolved on Wu.  Tiste races came to Wu. They weren't off it."

Malazan,2qyr77,Gaebryal,3,Fri Jan 2 22:57:12 2015 UTC,LOL fucking WHAT. I'm gonna beg for a huge source on that shit.
Malazan,2qyr77,Seattlelite84,4,Fri Jan 2 23:28:24 2015 UTC,"Paran: This makes more sense during/after MoI. But basically Rake's sword is actually a warren/realm unto itself and each being killed by it is put to work pulling the wagon. Paran's sword, Chance, was linked to Oponn when they brought him back to life after Sorry/Cotillion killed him. That works both ways, which is part of how he summoned the brother into Dragnipur (but MoI will make how he was able to more clear). The wagon had a link the realm of darkness, which the brother mentions about the chains going into it, so the Hounds were tricked into going through that, lured by the god. Oponn: They don't have a real agenda, it's definitely not to stop other gods from using mortals though. They just like interfering and adding a bit of chaos to the plans of others. Crokus: Tying into the bit about Oponn, Crokus is just a bit of randomness added by the Twins. Pretty much a lot of others concentrate on him thinking Oponn to be a threat to them, but he isn't really. I don't think they really had any intentions for him unless they could turn his luck at an opportune moment for their benefit. Tyrant: Just a title, but an informal/labelling one, it's not like ""ruler of the Jaghut"" or anything. Jaghut in general are pretty much the most powerful race per individual. Raest is a lot more powerful than most but that isn't explained until TtH. It's not something relevant to any plots or anything, just info from an offhand comment, it wouldn't mean anything to you now anyway. But I'll leave it here in case you want to come back to it, or for the benefit of others: TtH. Azath: Doesn't make a lot more sense until you finish RG unfortunately, but you do find out more about the Azath in lots of the books before then. But basically the Azath house absorbed the Finnest's power and used it to grow, part of the role of an Azath house is to capture overpowered beings."
Malazan,2qyr77,MoranthMunitions,3,Thu Jan 1 01:29:52 2015 UTC,"Basically the answer to almost all of your questions is... Keep reading!   The Paran one is the most confusing but you just need to stick in there and see where the Paran character is going, it makes his actions in GOTM make sense as you go. Your interpretation of events is pretty close to what occurred as far as I remember!  But bear in mind most people don't understand all aspects of Malazan on a first read through. GOTM on a re read after you finish the series is absolutely clear and makes perfect sense!  I think the only non spoiler answers I can give you is that a Tyrant is a special type of extremely powerful Jaghut explained in more detail later.   The Azath is hard to explain really. Suffice to say it's not a race, but more is explained as you go :P"
Malazan,2qyr77,TooLeft,3,Thu Jan 1 00:43:27 2015 UTC,"a special type of extremely powerful Jaghut   I don't see how you're drawing that conclusion. The Jaghut are an Elder race, probably one to one the most singularly powerful of all--although, granted we are talking about a host of Elder races that are all insanely powerful.    The Tyrants are, to the best of my recollection, individually a perversion of their racial ethos, who've decided to use their power towards subjugation."
Malazan,2qyr77,Seattlelite84,3,Thu Jan 1 00:50:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think the only comparison to the Jaghut is the Azathani. But its all very subjective, and boils down to individuals rather than being able to generalize I think."

Malazan,2qyr77,TooLeft,1 point,Thu Jan 1 00:54:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with Seattleite, the tyrants were not more powerful. It is interesting to think that all the jaghut are as powerful as the tyrants but simply lack the drive to use the full aggressive capabilities of omtose phellack."
Malazan,2qyr77,gathmoon,1 point,Thu Jan 1 14:41:23 2015 UTC,"Consider this. Raest had the ability to bind the will of others and usurp their power for himself. This is mentioned in passing a few different times.  The question is then  is it having this power and the temptation to use it what makes a tyrant? Or do all Jaghut have this potential? Is the temptation to take over others part of the reason they tend to live alone most of their lives - so that they're not constantly fighting the urge to usurp each other?  Raest, Tool implied, had masqueraded as an Imass god, taken their worship and used the power it gave him to further mess with them. It's the whole reason for the Imass war ont he Jaghut. The fact that Tyrants are willing to do that pretty much makes them more powerful than average members of their race."
Malazan,2qyr77,Dwolf63,2,Mon Jan 5 23:55:48 2015 UTC,"Crokus: they were just trying to mess everyones plans up and throw things into chaos, they like when random things happen  Paran:  When someone is killed by dragnipur, they get transported to another realm, where they find themselves chained to a wagon. underneath the wagon is the gate to the realm of darkness, and on top of the wagon are all the souls that are too tired to continue, they just get squished for all eternity.  Paran touching the hounds blood gave him a link to them, and that pulled him into the same realm, but not chained to the wagon.  Oponn had ties to paran, and he used those ties to force them to come to him.  Jaghut as a people are anti-society, they used to have one, but they chose to separate because they believed that the very nature of society was that some are in charge, and some would eventually become tyrants.  They chose to walk away from that, and now they live solitary lives for the most part.  Every now and then, a jaghut is born and has an uncontrollable desire to dominate everything around him. These are known as jaghut ""tyrants""  the azath will be explained a bit in the books, but just know that they are kind of the worlds immune system against magic. Sometimes whenever there is very concentrated area of dangerous magic, azath are semi-sentient ""houses"" that will rise up and try to contain that magic.  They grow, untill they are a 2-story house with a walled in yard, and they all look different.  there are trees in the yards, and if anything powerful enough tries to cross the yard without the azaths permission the roots will rise up and pull them under the ground and try to contain them too, some azath have held gods.  Raest's finnest was enough to trigger the growth of an azath house, and it then grabs raest and pulls him in."

I found the pacing was good the first time through, there wasn't as much new information about the world being fleshed out like the other books so it seemed faster to me. That's possibly because it came off of TtH, which was probably my slowest read by a couple of days."
Malazan,2qvtai,Xardov,17,Wed Dec 31 03:22:05 2014 UTC,"Is Memories of Ice this good?   It's better, IMO. I enjoyed DG, but MOI is top 3 in the series.    Mallick Rel needs to die   He's not the last person you'll say this about in this series. Hold on to your hate."
Malazan,2qvtai,anisotropy77,5,Wed Dec 31 03:57:47 2014 UTC,"Hold on to your hate.   I think I've already spent it all on hating Felisin (Sha'ik now), Pormqual, Mallick Rel, and Korbolo Dom.  :(  EDIT: and Pullyk Alar."
Malazan,2qvtai,HumbleAsFudge,5,Wed Dec 31 12:28:01 2014 UTC,"holy shit, thank you finally someone who can see past Felisin being a well written character. In my oppinion there was no ""transformation"". She didnt become more intelligent, not more wiser. She lived in Skullcup, and before that as a noble her entire lifer, and during her jouney through the Odahns all she became was more of a bitch. She didnt learn anything. According to herself she learned to hate other people, (for the wrong reason). Felisin is meant to be a flawed character in my opinion. i think Erikson purposely made her views and opinions flat out wrong. This is emphasized through the fact that she is an unreliable story teller ( Her view and claims about helping Baudin and Heboric survive Skullcup for example).  Im sorry for this heavily opinionated rant, but I hate Felisin so much. After all to be fair as much as I detest Mallick Rel, hes fighting for his own cause and admitedly the citizens of Seven Cities may have a right to freedom in their own eyes, so to me good and bad is a matter of perspective."
Malazan,2qvtai,grixa,5,Wed Dec 31 14:44:35 2014 UTC,"I honestly don't get the hate for Felisin. I understand that her attitude is not likeable, but I see her behaviour as a way to cope with all the horrible things that happened to her.  Sometimes she is mean to those who care about her, yes, but it's not like she is a terrible person. In fact, there are moments through the books where it's clear that she has feelings of gratitude towards those closest to her. Few and short moments, but they are key to understand her.  I don't know, I personally did care about her. I guess her case is something that reveals much about the reader and that's why I believe she is a well written character."
Malazan,2qvtai,SerBronnofBlackwater,3,Wed Dec 31 19:53:21 2014 UTC,Well it's not like your view is unpopular. Everyone hates Felisin. I don't though.
Malazan,2qvtai,Quantum_Finger,3,Wed Dec 31 15:05:02 2014 UTC,"I didn't hate her, I felt pity for her. She was the victim of some pretty awful stuff, not surprising she turned out the way she did."
Malazan,2qvtai,anisotropy77,3,Wed Dec 31 16:59:08 2014 UTC,"This is much closer to my feelings about Felisin as well. There are plenty of people to hate in the series, but Felisin is just someone you pity rather than hate. She doesn't help her cause with her attitude and her actions but, when you put them in the context of everything that goes on, I just can't bring my level of dislike for her to the level of, Mallick Rel, for instance."
Malazan,2qvtai,Giotto,2,Wed Dec 31 18:54:35 2014 UTC,"How is Mallick fighting for his people? Everything he does, he does for himself."
Malazan,2qvtai,internet_enthusiast,1 point,Wed Dec 31 15:39:10 2014 UTC,How is Mallick fighting for his people?   I think HumbleAsFudge is contrasting the fact that Felisin is Malazan whereas Mallick is a native of Seven Cities.

Malazan,2qvtai,TheHopelessGamer,3,Wed Dec 31 15:06:23 2014 UTC,Actually Deadhouse Gates was one of my least favorite of the series. Not saying it is bad by any means but books 3-8 are just amazing.
Malazan,2qvtai,Melloncollieocr,3,Wed Dec 31 03:51:53 2014 UTC,"This is kind of an interesting trend I've seen among Malazan fans that they either really love the Midnight Tides/Reaper's Gale stuff or really prefer the more Malazan/Seven Cities/Genabackis stuff.  There's nothing wrong either way, but I always find it really interesting the split in the fan base and how the very different settings impact people in very different ways.  Granted, I've only read all the books released through Toll the Hounds (just started Stonewielder yesterday), and as much as I've loved every book, DHG/MoI are still my favorite in the series, although honestly TtH got very close."
Malazan,2qvtai,mmSNAKE,2,Wed Dec 31 14:42:33 2014 UTC,"Good Point...It wasn't until my second re-read of the series that I appreciated all of the story lines. I think for me, in the beginning you get so hooked on one story line and all of a sudden the Edur come into play. I had just come from the Game of Thrones books when someone recommended Malazan, so I was accustomed to characters coming in and out through the series, but with Malazan when transitioning to the Edur storyline I kept wondering when we would get back to soldiering. Also MoI was SO freaking amazing that after that it took a while for me to get back into another plot line.  Like I said, eventually I grew to love the entire series and appreciate most of the characters, but it took some time."
Malazan,2qvtai,stanglemeir,2,Wed Dec 31 17:03:59 2014 UTC,"Huh, that's interesting. I'm a huge fan of both.  First time reader on DoD right now.

I am not really invested there yet, but I have a feeling that will change as I read on.  Apsalar is great, I really like her development, though I had been hoping she would find Felisin and add her to her bodycount (guess that answers your question about what I think of her, ey?)  Crokus is just sort of there, right?  If he was gone by the end of the prologue I'm not sure what would be missed, guess Oponn is still working some magic.

Malazan,2qln2w,Jack-Shepherd,9,Sun Dec 28 07:00:52 2014 UTC,"It had to have been the third company, by process of elimination.   First Company (Skinner's): Jacuruku - They weren't all in Jakal Viharn itself (only Skinner was), but they were in the southern regions according to a statement from one of them in BaB. Second Company (Shimmer's): Bael - Southern Assail, where Kyle is from, and the beginning of the book covered those, it seemed like the whole compliment was there. Third Company (Tarkhan's) - Unaccounted for, or at least not explicitly explained. Fourth Company (Cal-brinn's): Assail/Jacuruku - Cal-brinn and some others remained in Assail, covering the escape of Iron Bars and his remaining 2nd Blade, who escaped to Lether, then travelled to Jacuruku with Shurq Ellale. There was some warring mage families on Assail that they were fighting with, so can't be them.   Not really sure where Umryg is though, but the Primogenatrix appears again in Assail, having sailed straight there because the Crimson Guardswoman said ""Jaghut"" when she saw her, so I assume it's a fair way from there. It's possibly near Jacuruku as the circlet of Umryg has their mages go by ""thaumaturg"". Which could have pointed towards the First company (location wise), except that they'd been trapped in there for decades and they were definitely working for Ardata - there are no islands are close to the coast of Jacuruku, so it'd still have to be a fair way out. Anyway, the Third was the only one that the contract wasn't stated, the others were all tied up with their stuff so it has to have been them."

Malazan,2qkt60,madtowntripper,27,Sun Dec 28 01:03:54 2014 UTC,"It's pretty simple, Shadow does not require a god to be a religion.   The distinction is made in the way people refer to the members of the Cult of Shadow. The Cult of Shadow does not worship who occupies the Throne, they worship the aspect itself. There have been many occupiers of the throne.   When people refer to the priests they say 'Priest of Shadow' or 'Servant of the Rope'. However with other religions, in the case of say Fener, they refer to the priests as 'Priest of Fener' instead of 'Priest of War' because war is worshiped through Fener, not the aspect  Shadows aspect is ever changing and it does not require a godhead to have a religion. When Shadowthrone talks about how when you leave the cult, the Rope will release you, he's not referring to the actual Rope killing you, rather a servant of the rope.   Hope this clears things up."

Malazan,2qgg12,xavierhaz,26,Fri Dec 26 17:04:47 2014 UTC,"Potentially from Silchas Ruin's swords and Scabandari Bloodeye's knife. In the prologue it mentions that ""The twin scabbards at his hips were empty – he had broken both weapons, despite the weavings of sorcery invested in them"". In Chapter 5, during Udinaas' dream, it was mentioned that they were broken by a K'Chain Che'Malle Matron's death cry.   Also from the Epilogue:   He reached down to the outside of his left boot and drew out a shadow-etched dagger. Sorcery played on the iron. A final step, and the dagger was driven into Ruin’s back.   When Trull sees Silchas in the forest in Chapter 3:   ‘They were shattered,’ the Betrayer said. ‘Long ago. Fragments scattered across a battlefield. Why would anyone want them? Those broken shards can never be reunited. They are, each and every one, now folded in on themselves. So, I wonder, what did he do with them?’   From Udinaas/Wither in Chapter 13:   The Letherii slave’s eyes shifted to the sword the emperor held like a sceptre in his right hand, the point anchored on the dais near the throne’s ornate foot. The answer hides in that sword, and Hannan Mosag knows far more about that weapon – and its maker – than he has revealed. Then again, I do as well. Wither, the shadow wraith that had adopted Udinaas, had whispered some truths. The sword’s power had given Rhulad command of the wraiths. The Tiste Andii spirits.   Chapter 16:   Rhulad crawled towards him. ‘You made that sword!’ he said in an accusatory rasp. ‘Fire, hammer, anvil and quenching. I’ve made more swords than I can count. Just iron and sweat. They were broken blades, I think. Those black shards. From some kind of narrow-bladed, overlong knife. Two of them, black and brittle. Just pieces, really. I wonder where he collected them from?’   So I'd say the ability to control the Andii spirits, with what Withal says about ""broken blades"", combined with Ruin's blades being mentioned a couple of times and the ""I wonder, what did he do with them"" make it a straightforward connection that they're a part of the sword. Then the shards, mentioned to be from a knife, would make sense (to me) to come from Bloodeye's knife. For completeness if anything, I don't have anything towards it, so they could be from another knife.  Edit: Had a name mixed up. Also Wither also mentions in Chapter 5 that an iron blade without sorcerous investment would have vanished by then when they discuss the arrow head, possibly related as Ruin's swords had investment, as did Bloodeye's dagger."

Malazan,2qgdee,Kitad,5,Fri Dec 26 16:35:27 2014 UTC,"Glad you got through GotM easily. It is a hard read, but it really is a great story.  A note though, GotM is not a self contained story. It may seen that way now, but this is a 10 book series by Erickson and another 6 book series by ICE, (plus a prequel series by Erickson that's still being written). Everything is connected, and you won't know completely how until you are deeper into the series.  Tattersail and Paran did fall in love in GotM. By MOI, neither are the same person they were before, Paran figuratively and Silverfox literally. This whole dynamic is explored more through MOI, so keep reading. Also, throughout the series characters will call in love, will have casual sex, will settle down, will have tragic loss. Erickson is very good at making you connect with characters, even people only on the 3 pages. By the point you're at now, he hasn't really dived in yet.  Ascendants are meant to be a mystery. These are the the most powerful beings and gods in the series, their actions have wide spread influence, by laying everything out for you, Erickson and ICE would run the surprises of the series.  They leave hints though, and once you figure out alignments and desires, you'll be able to predict slightly.  You'll have to read some more to figure out why Oppon was obsesses with Paran, by the end of MOI, you should have a better idea.    Get used to the craziness of Shadowthrone.  He's amazing, and will steal every scene he's in.  He and Cotillion have a plan, and you will be following it throughout the series.  The novellas are good, but you should get to them after you read the series. They aren't connected to the main story, and instead follow 3 characters in their crazy adventures.  The novels by ICE are parallel to the main 10 books, there is an overlapping story, events by one author will be referenced by the other. You can read them mixed in with the main series, you won't get spoiled.  I personally read 1-10 of Erickson, then read the ICE books. Then read Forge of Darkness and the novellas.  It made sense to me, and there's only like 2 minor spoilers towards the end of the series.  People will say ICE sucks as an author, but I disagree. If you just read them, and concentrate on the story he's telling, you'll do fine."
Malazan,2qgdee,sonofa2,2,Fri Dec 26 17:47:29 2014 UTC,"Ascendants are meant to be a mystery   I'm at the exact same place in the books as OP is, and frankly I'm kinda annoyed by the whole ""Ascendant"" thing. I get it's somehow tied to the Azath Houses, who manage the deck and stuff - but I'm super annoyed that I still haven't been explained anything yet, two and a half books in.  I mean - are ascendants gods? The books don't seem to use ""ascendant"" and ""god"" interchangeably - Rake or Brood or Shadowthrone or Oppon, for instance, are never referred to as ""god"", while K'rul, Draconus or Burn are. And Ascendants seem to bow down to Gods (in theory) regularly, like Brood vis-a-vis Burn, for instance.  And in the scene in the beginning of Memories of Ice where K'rul, Draconus and ""Sister of cold nights"" cast down Kallor - what is ""Sister of Cold nights""? Is she an Elder God? Is she an Ascendant? She seems so out of place compared to the other two...  I mean, simply: what's the difference between ""god"" and ""ascendant""? Can't the writer just throw in a sentence about what the difference is? I mean, just a wee definition of the words ""god"" or ""ascendant"" in-universe would be super helpful, IMHO. Or is the fact that I'm confused and irritated because of the vagueness intentional? Is it essential to the eventual (I assume) big reveal of what the Azath houses are, what they're for and who made them?  I'm hugely tempted to search the Malazan Wiki for info, but I'm pretty sure I'd get huge spoilers."
Malazan,2qgdee,JebusGobson,6,Mon Dec 29 10:30:39 2014 UTC,"That's half the fun, there is not much explanation. Erickson tends to rely on his viewpoints to provide the information:   The characters who don't know can't tell us. The characters that think they know tell us what they think, whether it's right or wrong. The characters that do know aren't likely to share, or it's considered common knowledge within their sphere of interaction. (Like shadowthrone isn't going to go blabbing how he ascended to randoms; nor does he spell it out to cotillion, since he was there and he already knows).   That being said, we collect enough clues along the way to establish a basic understanding of ascendancy. Most of these clues come from characters we can assume have a somewhat good grasp of the situation. Characters like Heboric, Duiker, Quick Ben Etc. Also we watch a few characters ascend from within their point of view MOI  Basically an ascendant is a being of power. That's it. Various powers, various abilities, gained in various ways. They mostly start mortal and most often they are associated with an aspect. Ascendants usually embody their powers, as in they are not drawing on a warren, nor do they reside within a warren, or request their power from Gods. There are many paths to ascendancy, but most require some combination of sacrifice and circumstance.MOI GOTM GOTM etc. etc.   Gods are basically powerful beings with worshipers they recognize. The only difference between a god and an ascendant are those worshipers. Gods often embody, or reside within; a warren. As Gods lose and gain worshipers over the years the face of their power changes, however once a god always a god, even if you lose all your worshipers. TTH.GOTM    One does not have to be an ascendant to become a god MOI but it often helps MOI. All that is required is worshipers.  Hope this helps! I know it's scattered, it's hard to explain without spoilers.   *Edited for clarity & spoilers"

Malazan,2qgdee,drae-,3,Mon Dec 29 15:20:47 2014 UTC,"So I'll try and give you a spoiler free explanation.  You'll have to take it for what it is though and continue reading though, as Erickson is not one to just lay things out for you.  Ascendants are defined in the glossary as beings that gain a lot of influence or power.  So you can have a human, that gains a lot of power, that eventually becomes an ascendant.  Think about Coltaine and Geslar from Deadhouse Gates.  They were just normal humans that have gained a lot of influence and power, and were on the path to becoming an ascendant.  An ascendant is not necessarily a god though.  Gods are ascendants that are worshiped.  The Gods generally rule over a warren, but not always.  Oponn doesn't rule over a warren for example, but Shadowthrone rules over Shadow. Gods aren't directly connected to the Azath Houses, Kellanved and Dancer just found a way to use them.  The houses are a little mysterious so I'll leave those out for now.  Elder Gods are different than Gods though.  Elder Gods have been around a very long time, and aren't aren't necessarily even Gods in the way that Gods become Gods.  This concept takes are very long long time to get explained, and gets further turned on it's head in Forge of Darkness, as that's our only first hand account of what happened back  when Mother Dark and Father Light actually got together.  Elder Gods for simplicity sake are extremely power beings, their magic sometimes needs blood, and they are unaffected by Otataral.  Some final notes: Brood doesn't worship or bow down to Burn though, he's more like a friend helping a sleeping goddess out. Sister of Cold Nights is an Elder God, just like Draconus and K'rul.  That's just the title she uses."

So it's just ""a powerful person""? So Laseen is an ascendant too, for instance?   As to the three marines from Deadhouse Gates - I was surprised as to the comments that they are ""on their way to ascendancy"", tbh - maybe it still needs to be explained what power they gained? IIRC all they got out of their time in the Warren was a tan.  Thanks for the rest of the explanation, too. I'm still wondering where the Crippled God fits into all of this - but I have a gut feeling that's going to be the entire point of the books."
Malazan,2qgdee,JebusGobson,5,Mon Dec 29 15:09:08 2014 UTC,"Laseen doesn't have enough power.  You need more.  She's just a really good assassin is all.  An ascendant would be like Rake.  An entire race follows him, and he's part Elient.  Gesler, Stormy and Truth were bathed in Kurald Thyrllan (same as Kurald Liosan).  That encounter changed them, more to come in later books.  And you're absolutely right. The Crippled God's story is told through the entire story, and the last book in the main series is called ""Crippled God"" for a reason."
Malazan,2qgdee,sonofa2,1 point,Mon Dec 29 16:18:37 2014 UTC,"I agree about Shadowthrone, he's a cool character, and we learn a lot more about his plan over the rest of the books.  Not sure about Oponn, though...? I read the other M:BotF books, so maybe I missed it, but Oponn's early actions never became clear to me."

Malazan,2qgdee,sonofa2,1 point,Sun Dec 28 00:21:49 2014 UTC,Are you saying they knew he would become Master of the Deck all the way back then? I might have missed hints if there were any.

Malazan,2qgdee,iamjoey,4,Sat Dec 27 16:10:51 2014 UTC,I get it that they found each other attractive and that they fucked like rabbits. But the love of his life? They had like 2 scenes together and it wasn't dripping in chemistry
Malazan,2qgdee,Hubbell,1 point,Sat Dec 27 17:18:53 2014 UTC,"MBotF is literally a book based on a DnD compaign.  I don't mean that metaphorically or anything, it is literally what it is.  Some character relationships just don't make sense in a typical literary sense but when you place it into the 'these 2 guys played DnD for 20 years then wrote a shitton of books about it' then it all comes together."
Malazan,2qgdee,stanglemeir,3,Sun Dec 28 01:49:59 2014 UTC,"I've always viewed it as more of a love-lost kind of thing. It's more that they never got the chance to develop their feelings that made them into something more. They never really loved each other, but the abrupt death of Tattersail turned it from a stress induced quickie into a great love that never was."
Malazan,2qgdee,drae-,3,Mon Dec 29 05:50:38 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I think it was kinda ret-conned. GOTM was written years before MOI. I think when Erickson got around to MOI he needed that relationship to be more then it was in GOTM to make the connection between the Malazans and Silverfox make sense. So he wrote it up in MoI as if it was bigger then it really was.  Of course most of that build-up happens inside of Parans viewpoint. Who knows what shagging and having her die on you makes you feel. Even the slightest of affections are likely blown out of proportion (""what if's"" and ""could've beens"", not to mention the survivors guilt). So maybe the traumatic events Paran suffers through twists his recollection of what he shared with Tattersail.  IIRC Paran muses on this during one of his internal thought sessions."
Malazan,2qgdee,SerBronnofBlackwater,4,Mon Dec 29 14:54:21 2014 UTC,"Did you just say you don't enjoy Shadowthrone parts? Friendship over!!  Haha I'm just kidding. Good commentary, don't worry you'll come to appreciate Shadowthrone.   Paran and Tatters are both different people by MoL (no pun intended). I don't think they were ever in head over heels love. It was more of a two people getting together that were thrust into a very dangerous situation. Strong feelings come of those situations but it was more of a ""flash in the pan"" love (strong and quickly gone).   I'm a fan of ASOIAF too! Read Malazan first though and I like Malazan a lot more. Eriksson had already emotionally raped me by killing my favorite characters all the time so I was already numbed by the time GRRM tried to do it to me lol. I do enjoy the fact that GRRM inability to write a book in a normal amount of time is causing a lot of people to discover the Malazan world though!"
Malazan,2qgdee,sonofa2,1 point,Mon Dec 29 16:18:30 2014 UTC,"I've read ASOIAF and the Malazan series.  It does pop up in my mind all the time the Erickson and ICE have been able to pump out the books every year or 2, and GRRM hasn't.  At the same time, I do realize, Erickson and ICE planned the series out playing DnD, and also the politics aren't as complicated in Malazan."
Malazan,2qgdee,SerBronnofBlackwater,2,Sun Jan 4 05:24:23 2015 UTC,Politics may not be but that doesn't really have any bearing on how fast a book comes out. The plot is far more intricate and there are hundreds of more characters with their own storylines. So it makes Eriksson more impressive.
Malazan,2qgdee,sonofa2,1 point,Sun Jan 4 05:44:55 2015 UTC,"I'd say the details of the politics has a pretty good bearing on the writing span of GRRM.  He far surpasses Erickson and ICE, in terms of complex details.  And I should clarify, when i say politics, I don't mean just Kings Landing, but also the Wall, Stannis,, the Others, the Wildlings, Iron Men, Dany, Faceless Men, Northmen and Dornish.  That's a lot of fucking plot."
Malazan,2qgdee,SerBronnofBlackwater,1 point,Sun Jan 4 05:55:06 2015 UTC,"I mean I disagree massively but your entitled to your own opinion. GRRMs threads haven't even come together yet so we still don't know how intricate they will be. Most people have a lot of the theories in their head as cannon already so they're really building it up more than what will come to past. GRRM gets a lot of praise for subverting fantasy troupes but honestly, he rarely does.   The only way I'd look at him in a different light is if ASOIAF spoiler Because that would be the twist at this point since he's built up as the classic fantasy hero who will fulfill a prophecy and save the world from the big bad."

Malazan,2qgdee,AreYouReadyToReddit,1 point,Mon Dec 29 10:14:07 2014 UTC,"You should never ask questions about a book when you're partially through it. Because it's hard to answer your questions without giving spoilers.  So, very minor spoilers below about your first puzzling element.  I think you're overlooking something important. Something that is vital to understanding this series, and human nature:  Just because a character says something, doesn't make it true. Humans often lie to themselves as much they do to anyone else. Spoiler  Steven Erikson never tells you what is happening. His characters express what they think is true in any given situation, but you never take it as 100% accurate."

My mom and I are currently on book 7 of the Malazan Book of the Fallen series. We are have a reading competition with these books.   When she started moving away from supernatural romance novels, I forced her to read The Black Company and she loved it. Then I made her read The Lies of Locke Lamora (and the other two in the series). We are both waiting patiently for The Thorn of Emberlain, fourth book in the series, to be released.  My 13 year old son and I are currently on the third book of Locke Lamora which we listen to via Audible. He loves them.  You are in for a fantastic ride and I hope you enjoy these as much as I have."

Take your Secret Santa's advice, though, and enter into GotM with some caution.  The book really does throw you into the deep-end.  I almost threw the book away in frustration because it was so difficult to follow, but after lurking on this sub, I got the confidence to keep reading through.  Then, about 300 pages in, it all clicked for me and I fell in love with the series.  I'd also recommend r/KingkillerChronicle/ and /r/Mistborn (also by Sanderson).

Malazan,2qeupx,AllWrong74,1 point,Fri Dec 26 14:24:15 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I don't.  I went over there a few times to look for recommendations after finishing out ASoIaF (until the next two are completed), then a friend recommended KKC, then I wandered to /r/fantasy and found recommendations for Mistborn and Malazan.  I think I saw some mentions of the Coin and Dagger series, too, but it didn't ""have"" me by the end of the first book.  I thought the characters and the races and the interaction with the economy were interesting, but the story didn't grab me as strongly as the others I've mentioned.    I'll give TLoLL a look and see if I like it.  AFTER I get through MoI."
Malazan,2qeupx,trolo-joe,1 point,Fri Dec 26 14:33:24 2014 UTC,"If you like fantasy and you like Ocean's 11, then you will probably like The Lies of Locke Lamora.  The first time I tried it, I was ambivalent after 100 pages, so I went on and read some other stuff.  When I came back and started over, I was hooked from the start.  No idea why.  It was a really fun book.  I hope you enjoy it, and I would also like to recommend that you hang out a bit in /r/fantasy.  There's lots of interesting stuff that gets posted there, plus you stand a good chance of getting to chat with authors like Brandon Sanderson, Michael J. Sullivan, Todd Lawrence, and M. Todd Gallowglass (who posts regularly here in /r/Malazan as well), etc.  EDIT:     If you like fantasy and you like Ocean's 11, then you will probably like The Lies of Locke Lamora.

I felt like it was written to a very young audience, but Lynch threw in some colorful language to make it more ""adult"" in its scope.    There were a couple of things I thought were drab and predictable, but ultimately I enjoyed the read.  I would definitely recommend it to a friend.  Next up is either House of Chains or the beginning of a Kingkiller reread.  I can't decide yet.  I need a bit of a break from fiction for a while, I think."
Malazan,2qeupx,KBKarma,1 point,Sun Feb 8 18:41:13 2015 UTC,This guy has good taste in books.   I had no idea about Sanderson's Cosmere..does that mean I will have to do an absurd 30 book reread when he is done with it in 10-15 years?
Malazan,2qeupx,StrexCorp,1 point,Fri Dec 26 14:18:08 2014 UTC,"If you want the full big ol' background on the overarching plot, probably, yeah.  The rough reading order, according to Coppermind, is as follows:   Elantris Emperor's Soul Mistborn trilogy 1 Warbreaker Stormlight Archive 1 and 2   Unfortunately, I can't find a reading order that includes the unpublished stuff. Alloy of Law is, I believe, still before Warbreaker, as is Mistborn Trilogy 2. Trilogy 3, however, is set in a 1930s analog, while Trilogy 43 is a sci-fi setting (Trilogy 3 was announced a few days ago) EDIT: just reread the announcement; a new trilogy wasn't announced, though I think the possibility was hinted at. Dragonsteel's first two books, at least, are before the Shattering, and so come before everything in that list (it's an eight book series). White Sands comes... somewhere. Nightblood, the sequel to Warbreaker, probably comes after Warbreaker chronologically, but may be somewhere in the Stormlight Archive timeline, depending on how many (or few) years there are between Warbreaker and Way of Kings. Additionally, Sixth of Dusk and Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell, and whatever full-length novels turn up based on those worlds, White Sands (a trilogy), The Silence Divine, and other unannounced short stories and novels, feature somewhere in the chronology, and no-one's asked Brandon precisely where (or he's not said).  So, in summary: in about twenty years, you'll have about 45 books to read over, and some short stories. However, the Cosmere is written such that the overarching stuff is not vital to know, so read them however you like. For more info, check out Coppermind or the 17th Shard (linked on Coppermind's front page)."

The Gentleman Bastard series is definitely my favorite in everything i've read in my life. I usually read slowly (a book like one part of the Malazan series takes me about a month to go through since i mostly read while i'm in the metro or the bus going and coming back from work), but i read Scott Lynch's books in about 2 weeks each. Couldnt stop.  Have fun with those! Also, Chronicles of the Black Company is good... a bit weird at times tho'. Didnt buy the second one."

Alternatively, commission art of her favourite character?"
Malazan,2qcuvb,srx_god,3,Thu Dec 25 10:49:52 2014 UTC,How about a sticky post with the reading order AND links to the art work as well. You can also include links to the re-reads on Tor. Might be too much for one post though. I also feel that we would be served well if we just include something somewhere to tell new readers to at least soldier on till MoI before deciding on whether they like it or not but I guess that'll sort itself out in the comments. The reason I say this is that is the number one question new malazan readers have. They get disillusioned somewhere near the middle of GoTM or midway through Raraku and miss out on something really epic. Just my 2¢.
Malazan,2qcuvb,SageOfTheWise,2,Thu Dec 25 15:05:00 2014 UTC,"The ""generally accepted"" reading order and the link to the re-read are both in the sidebar.  No real reason to re-post them in a thread, honestly.  EDIT:  In retrospect, the use of quotes made this statement look assholish.  I used the quotes, because there's not a real reading order, just a generally accepted one."
Malazan,2qcuvb,srx_god,3,Thu Dec 25 15:13:34 2014 UTC,Could have like a post on common reading orders and there pros and cons. Could have like a FAQ in general if we child think of other questions.

I thought I'd ask in case because only the Andii really get much of a mention in the first few books, with the Edur mentioned a bit, but the Liosan aren't mentioned by name until halfway through HoC, unless you count the same book's Dramatis Personae. There's just the odd tangential reference to there being a third Tiste type, like when Kulp mentions them on the Silanah in DG."

I think I'm in the deep minority by not loving DG, but the 2/4 story line with the Whirlwind was just eh for me. On the other hand, the 6-8 stretch is probably the best fantasy I've ever read."
Malazan,2q7nh9,TrevorAndCorey,2,Tue Dec 23 22:07:13 2014 UTC,"I didn't love DG too much either, I enjoyed it but I missed the characters from GOTM too much to fully get into it. When you say 2/4 story line, does that mean after HoC it won't continue on as a parallel story?"
Malazan,2q7nh9,TrevorAndCorey,1 point,Tue Dec 23 23:17:58 2014 UTC,"Essentially 1,3,8 are a story line, 2,4,6 is a story line and 5,7 is the last arc. Then 9 and 10 mix them all together.   So HoC is pretty much a direct sequel to 2, but as a bonus you get to meet one of the best characters in the series early on in HoC, Karsa. I enjoyed HoC, but for me that and DG didn't have emphasis on my favorite characters."
Malazan,2q7nh9,AllWrong74,3,Tue Dec 23 23:22:26 2014 UTC,"God, I hated that Karsa bit.  It took 1/4 of the whole book all at once, and there was nothing at all to like about Karsa for over half of the storyline.  By the end of it, I realized how much the character had changed, and how much I liked him.  It was one of the most superb character developments I've ever read.  It was so subtle, too.  I didn't even realize it was happening until the end of that section."
Malazan,2q7nh9,TrevorAndCorey,2,Thu Dec 25 08:52:19 2014 UTC,"And he continues to develop every time he's in the story, too. I found that slow as well, which is why I rank HoC near the bottom, but no one grows as much as Karsa over the series."
Malazan,2q7nh9,AllWrong74,2,Thu Dec 25 15:29:20 2014 UTC,Witness   Badassery follows.
Malazan,2q7nh9,TrevorAndCorey,2,Thu Dec 25 15:34:24 2014 UTC,"Hmm, so do books 5/7 have characters like Rake/Kruppe/Quick etc in them, or do they get a complete new cast. And yeah I'm looking forward to Karsa, I've seen a lot of buzz on here about him."
Malazan,2q7nh9,AllWrong74,2,Tue Dec 23 23:29:26 2014 UTC,No 5 and 7 are entirely new characters though 7 has some spillovers. But those new ones are Tehol and Bugg who you may also have heard of and they're amazing.   I don't want to spoil too much about those but suffice it to say all of them will be back in force later in the series.
Malazan,2q7nh9,Mahdimuh,1 point,Tue Dec 23 23:55:35 2014 UTC,"5 has 1 character you've met before.  7 basically brings characters from all the other books in to meet up with the characters from 5.  Also, timeline-wise, 5 takes place around the same time as the Siege of Pale."
Malazan,2q7nh9,TrevorAndCorey,1 point,Thu Dec 25 08:53:47 2014 UTC,Whats most shocking to me is putting the finale in tier 3. Did you not like the ending?
Malazan,2q7nh9,AllWrong74,1 point,Tue Dec 23 22:35:47 2014 UTC,"The ending was fantastic and emotional, I guess it's just a testament to the series that the others were just so good. But the conclusion of TTH was even more powerful I thought, making that stretch my favorite.  In reality these tiers are very close together, I just wanted to make a semblance of something for OP."
Malazan,2q7nh9,linuxcloud,1 point,Tue Dec 23 22:54:40 2014 UTC,"TtH is the best ending to any book I've ever read.  DG is the 2nd best ending to any book I've ever read.  I've read books that were better than these 2, but never a book that ended as well as they did."
Malazan,2q7nh9,TrevorAndCorey,1 point,Thu Dec 25 08:55:07 2014 UTC,"Hmm. I'm halfway through RG and have found it pretty slow so far. That said, BH (also in your tier 1) was my favorite book thus far. RG presumably gets better from here? I suppose part of my frustration is from RG."
Malazan,2q7nh9,AllWrong74,2,Wed Dec 24 14:20:17 2014 UTC,Oh it does. The ending third is only joined by TTH in how good it is to me. light RG spoiler
Malazan,2q7nh9,linuxcloud,2,Wed Dec 24 17:53:34 2014 UTC,"/u/linuxcloud finishes RG and the tears start to flow.  Be sure to post to the sub and let us know how you felt when you got to the end.  I'm anxious to hear from you.  Seriously...this series made me cry so many damned times...I'm 40, with the exception of MBotF, I haven't cried because of a book since I read Old Yeller and Where the Red Fern Grows back-to-back when I was 13."
Malazan,2q7nh9,strawberrysundaeandt,2,Thu Dec 25 08:55:59 2014 UTC,I shall. I've made posts after finishing several of the books to at least clarify events. I'll be sure to make one when I finish RG.
Malazan,2q7nh9,knockturne,3,Fri Dec 26 01:45:58 2014 UTC,"Toll the Hounds, followed closely by Reaper""s Gale, Bonehunters and MoI. I am indecisive! They all had strong narratives and characters I loved."

Malazan,2q7nh9,SerBronnofBlackwater,2,Wed Dec 24 05:22:18 2014 UTC,"Toll the Hounds    There's just no competition.  I was ranting and raving about how Deadhouse Gates had the best ending to any book I'd ever read, then I got to TtH."
Malazan,2q7nh9,sonofa2,2,Thu Dec 25 08:48:19 2014 UTC,Reapers Gale. No contest. Has the Bonehunters AND Tehol/Bugg. Love it.
Malazan,2q7nh9,NegativeChirality,1 point,Thu Dec 25 21:56:43 2014 UTC,"It's gotta be Reaper's Gale or Crippled God for me.  TTH and DoD had some of my favorite scenes in the entire series, but they have a lot of very slow sections.  CG is what the series has built up to in the last 9 books, and RG just has complete action and suspense, more than BH in my opinion."
Malazan,2q7nh9,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Tue Dec 23 21:35:58 2014 UTC,I agree with you on these selections.
Malazan,2q7nh9,ScottyBeans,1 point,Wed Dec 24 16:41:51 2014 UTC,Either The Bone Hunters or Toll The Hounds. Can't decide.

Malazan,2q5kdg,doverak,3,Tue Dec 23 07:09:22 2014 UTC,"I picked it up. I'm only about halfway through it, but I've enjoyed it so far. As a fan of Star Trek, the spoofs/parodies/jabs he keeps throwing in have been pretty entertaining to me."
Malazan,2q5kdg,tanngniost,3,Tue Dec 23 15:59:33 2014 UTC,"Very different from Malazan, but it's a fun quick read that really does a great job spoofing Star Trek.  I didn't like it as much as his ""serious"" work, but it was worth the time and I will read the sequel if/when he writes them."
Malazan,2q5kdg,nobadlinks,2,Tue Dec 23 15:26:44 2014 UTC,I read it and really enjoyed it. A complete departure from Malazan... Ever read Robert Ludlum's Road to Gandolfo or Road to Omaha? It reminded me a lot of those.
Malazan,2q5kdg,parabola01,1 point,Tue Dec 23 12:12:13 2014 UTC,It reminded me of Redshirts by John Scalzi.  It was entertaining for sure.

Malazan,2q4bby,therapy,10,Mon Dec 22 23:41:56 2014 UTC,"Mallick Rel and Korbolo Dom - that's it? After building them up so much as the worst of the worst, we end on ""Shadowthrone&Cotillion might mess with them""..?   We leave the empire just as we found it. With seemingly the 'worst of the worst' newly ascended to the throne and no end in sight. It's cyclical that way.   Mael/Bugg. Slowly over 10 books we see that these two very different characters are actually one. I was sure that this would be resolved in some manner, but it wasn't. How, then, does the charming, helpful, compassionate, ""gets it"", Bugg, be the same entity as Mael, who empowers Mallick Rel to take over the Malazan Empire? Why would Bugg want to take over that empire, and how could he be ok with the means that were used?   Who said Bugg/Mael was ok with any of it? Or that he supported Mallick Rel at all? Gods don't get to choose their worshippers. It's one of the huge perils of godhood in this series. Look at Feather Witch and The Errant. Even better, look at D'rek and all her followers. Literally the entire religion of D'rek (minus Banaschar) wanted to side with the Crippled God in his mid series plans and D'rek had to slaughter all of them before they could use her. A god's power being tied to their worshippers is one of the major themes of the series.    Karsa Orlong - that's it? After building up his fight to create ""a world of towns, not cities"", and his several-books-long quest to return to his people and form an army - we never get there? After taking so long, is anything left of his people by then, or have they all been enslaved already by the Nathii?   Well I mean I think the point was is we went on a long multi book journey where Karsa learned how silly and impossible his goals were. But also we're getting another series just on Karsa so obviously that plot isn't done.    Kallor. We spent a whole book seeing him try to go to Darujistan, to be held up outside the gates for a while, and then... nothing? I realize the issue is probably that he was only a danger in a specific time period, so once delayed he's not interesting anymore. But that wasn't really explained. See also next point.   What exactly wasn't explained?   Possibly related: The pickled Seguleh? The return of a ""Tyrant"" to Darujhistan? (I suspected the Tyrant might be Kallor, although ""Tyrant"" has had many meanings in the books?)   Yeah honestly, I didn't like all that being put in Toll The Hounds, its all a tie in to Esslemont books. Specifically the book Orb Scepter Throne.   Why did the Otataral Dragon destroy the Crippled God's chains? Surely Otataral is only effective against non-Elder magic - and we know the chaining involved entities that do use Elder magic?   Because of Heboric. That's why he was so important in the end. He was the conduit between the Crippled Gods power and the Otateral Power. He was basically a giant magical USB adapter. He had the one hand of Jade (Crippled God) and the other of Otateral (Dragon).   How could Shadowthrone plan the entire plot to free the Crippled God, when it depended 100% on the Otataral Dragon, which was freed by 3 Elder Gods, precipitated by no controllable event that I can see? Tracing it back, the Errant got too close to the ice-enclosed water god used by the Tiste Edur, which drove him to want to restore his cult and the power of the Elder Gods. But first, that wasn't predictable, and second, even if it was, that wasn't the only means to do so.   Remember first off, that all those other Elder Gods already planned this (Sechul Lath, Kilmandaros, etc), and they let The Errant think it was his idea when he came to them about it and they were already working on it because it made him easier to use. Also remember, this isn't just Shadowthrone's plan. This is Anomander Rake's plan. I know it can be a bit handwavery to say it, but the idea is Anomander is just that good. We don't know how he planned this all or how long it took, but somehow, he did.    We were told that the newer Gods also had a plan to get hold of the Crippled God's heart. Silchas Ruin even found them scheming. Yet, they did nothing - except help free him, in the case of 2 of those gods (Fener, Worm). What about all the others?   They just never even got an opening. Such things happen. It's not like more than a few pages were ever devoted to their plotting.   The Moranth. Somehow related to the Barghast, with some hints of Edur involvement. But more importantly, this small forest nation has the equivalent of modern-day firepower and air support, via their munitions and quorls. Just look at what unrestrained use of munitions did in forcing the Perish to surrender (and that's without quorls!). The Moranth should have had far more than enough capability to defeat Pale without the Malazan Empire (in fact, the natural thing would be to have a Moranth Empire).   They just don't have such designs to rule the world. I'm not sure what the question you're asking is exactly though.    Finally, a question about the Jaghut. Our first encounter was with Raest, who was basically unkillable. This could have been due to being undead, or being Jaghut. Later, we hear how hard it was to kill Jaghut for the T'lan Imass, even Jaghut children (sometimes they could just bury or trap them, etc.). I sort of took from this that they had superfast healing, or something similar. But, a few of the living Jaghut were killed in the final battle near the Spire. Just how powerful are living Jaghut? Was Raest special because of being undead? Or by just having more Omtose Phellack or something?   Raest was special because he was a incredibly powerful mage. You can't think of the race (or any race) as that homogenized. Think about humans. Obviously some humans are really easy to kill, and some are incredibly hard. Same with Jaghut."
Malazan,2q4bby,SageOfTheWise,2,Tue Dec 23 06:02:59 2014 UTC,"Who said Bugg/Mael was ok with any of it? Or that he supported Mallick Rel at all? Gods don't get to choose their worshippers. It's one of the huge perils of godhood in this series. Look at Feather Witch and The Errant.   Yes, but for me, the crucial part is that he killed her when he got fed up.   Even better, look at D'rek and all her followers. Literally the entire religion of D'rek (minus Banaschar) wanted to side with the Crippled God in his mid series plans and D'rek had to slaughter all of them before they could use her.   Another example of a god not being cool with their followers, and wiping them out.   A god's power being tied to their worshippers is one of the major themes of the series.    It is, but gods are still very powerful, and can enforce their will against their followers, precisely as those two examples show. Yet Bugg/Mael seems to not care - and even seems to silently admit he is behind the plot to take over the Malazan Empire, when one of the other Elder Gods raises the topic (in the context of the Errant being the only one without a grand scheme).   Yeah honestly, I didn't like all that being put in Toll The Hounds, its all a tie in to Esslemont books. Specifically the book Orb Scepter Throne.   From your response and others, I'm starting to see just how much of the 10 books are setting stuff up for other books. I find that kind of annoying, mainly because it's by another author, and also I wasn't aware of it. I was reading the books with the usual ""if a gun shows up in the first scene, it'll be used in the second scene"". Maybe my expectations were off. But I'm not sure what should have set them straight before reading the books (it's not like the blurb on the back cover says anything about it ;)    Why did the Otataral Dragon destroy the Crippled God's chains?

Ok, I guess that makes sense. It's not fully satisfying, but at least it is hinted at in the books."
Malazan,2q4bby,SageOfTheWise,5,Tue Dec 23 18:25:12 2014 UTC,"Well, if you like, you do get a bit of direct Mael/Mallick interaction in one of the Esslemont books. But the difference between Mallick and someone like Feather Witch and D'rek's cult is that they interfered in godly affairs became direct threats to their patron gods. (Moreso in D'rek's case, a bit less so in The Errant's case. Feather Witch and the Errant are just generally examples of how not to act as a god / priest in general). It's like an entirely different level of evil. Mallick is off on the other side of the planet just dealing in wholly human affairs. Its just humans being humans to other humans. Humans have done that for thousands of years. He's seen it hundreds of times, and this instance is out of sight out of mind. And there's also just the fact that despite not liking Mallick, his actions are directly benefiting Mael, Mael's power is only on the rise again because Mallick is also on the rise. It's just not really in his interest to deal with.   From your response and others, I'm starting to see just how much of the 10 books are setting stuff up for other books. I find that kind of annoying, mainly because it's by another author, and also I wasn't aware of it. I was reading the books with the usual ""if a gun shows up in the first scene, it'll be used in the second scene"". Maybe my expectations were off. But I'm not sure what should have set them straight before reading the books (it's not like the blurb on the back cover says anything about it ;)   Yeah, that's true. I think the point Erikson was trying to make is how much bigger the world is than any one story, even a story as massive in scope as Malazan. There are still all these other things going on in the world that we only here parts of.   Hmm, this is still unclear to me. I don't see why Heboric would make the Otataral Dragon more effective.   Ok, I read your questions a bit wrong I think. They don't destroy the chains on the crippled god at all. They use Heboric's connection to both the Crippled God and The Otateral Dragon to basically swap them. Now those chains chain Korabas instead of The Crippled God. Which is what Korabas wants too because her existence causes him to destroy anything she is near, but she doesn't want to destroy."
Malazan,2q4bby,SageOfTheWise,2,Tue Dec 23 19:04:06 2014 UTC,"A difference though is that Mael/Bugg seems like a genuinely decent person. He acts with compassion and with honor, consistently. That's why even if Mallick is just more bad human stuff like all of human history, it seems out of character for Mael/Bugg to just accept he is being used for such a purpose.  I do see the point about it not being in Mael's interest to confront Mallick. But that goes against the character of Bugg as we know it. That is exactly the contradiction that seems hard to explain. But, if it's addressed in an Esslemont books, I guess that's it then...  About the Otataral Dragon, I'm not sure I agree with that. The dragon destroys the chains before Heboric gets involved. Or at least it looks that way. But I'm not sure of evidence to support your theory? It is an elegant one, though - I kind of wish it were true, as it makes more sense, come to think of it, than how things looked to me as I read it."
Malazan,2q4bby,DumpTruckJester,1 point,Tue Dec 23 19:15:50 2014 UTC,"I don't have the book on me to look, but checking out the Tor reread and it seems like... both happen? Unfortunately the 'breaking of the chains' seems to happen exactly between two different sections of the reread so they don't touch much on it.  Ok so I'm thinking about it a bit, and we're thinking about it wrong. The assumption we're making is the chains can't be harmed by Korabas affected because they were made partly with elder magic. But on the flip side, they were also made partly with warren magic. When you think about it, if you're able to destroy half of something's essence, the thing is still likely to fall apart. So anyway, given that justification, lets go through the events. I'm sourcing from here.   First think that's mentioned is the Crippled God's chains shattered, as you said, thanks to Korabas.  But then we get this passage:   Fiddler finally breaks through and tells him he has to chain Korabas, that “she will accept your chains.” The Crippled God wonders how he could do such a thing to another, having “known an eternity in chains,” saying her death would be a “release.” But Fiddler tells him again Korabas will accept it. The Crippled God agrees and releases his mind to find someone waiting for him.   That someone is Heboric and they go on to use the Crippled God's chains to chain Korabas. That passage makes it clear that even though the chains are broken, they're still there to be used again. I imagine if you want to look at the technical level of this, whats happening is something a long the lines of The Crippled God using his power in place of the missing warren power (The Crippled God's power is neither Warren nor Elder magic, it's it's own separate alien thing, so it won't be destroyed by Korabas instantly either) and Heboric aids this transfer from The Crippled God to Korabas."
Malazan,2q4bby,anointed9,1 point,Tue Dec 23 20:01:50 2014 UTC,"Ah, nice! That makes sense. I assumed ""your chains"" means something new the Crippled God would create, but it does make more sense your way - we don't see the CG create anything, he's more of a passive participant in a pre-planned series of events. It does sound consistent that even though the chains were shattered, that something of them was left, and it could be used to chain Korabas."
Malazan,2q4bby,SerBronnofBlackwater,7,Tue Dec 23 20:39:13 2014 UTC,"Mael/Bugg Think back to the interactions between Feather Witch and the Errant. A god is beholden to and, shaped by, his followers.  Karsa Orlong Eriksson is writing a trilogy on Karsa after he finishes the andii trilogy.  Otataral Dragon Considering the last chaining was relatively recent and had Dassem Ultor, Hood, Oponn, Fener and a few others that don't use elder magic present I personally dont think its too unreasonable to believe that the chains would be destroyed."
Malazan,2q4bby,anisotropy77,2,Tue Dec 23 01:48:43 2014 UTC,"Mael/Bugg: Good point, and also as we saw with Dessembrae, gods can have ""part"" of them behave differently (Dessembrae was a jerk, Dassem was awesome, as Silchas says, ""the best part of you is walking around [somewhere]""). I guess these factors can explain some of it.  Still, something feels incomplete and wrong. The Errant is and has always been fickle and kind of a jerk. Bugg is conscientious, considerate, loyal - good. He would care if his power is being used wrongly.  Worse, in the book before last, when the Elder gods are summoned, the Errant is surprised when another (Olar Ethil? Or Kilmanaros or Knuckles) mentions Bugg's takeover of the Malazan Empire. It's mentioned in the context of ""everyone has a plan, except for you, foolish Errant."" Bugg does not dispute the plan, does not appear surprised, and basically it seems like a revelation in accordance with what he wants.  So I was really expected to see resolvement. We've seen other such resolvements - Tayshrenn wasn't really trying to kill the Bridgeburners, they weren't really outlawed, etc. - there were super-clever reasons for appearing to do bad stuff, but really they were doing the right thing.  But for Bugg/Mael, it just is left unresolved.  Otataral Dragon: They had Hood and Anomander, both of which use Elder magic. But I think you might be right, the idea might be that the dragon destroyed the non-Elder parts or something like that. And I realize the author hates spoonfeeding his readers. However, it still felt surprising - my reaction was ""oh, that's it? unchaining him is that easy?"" Might be my fault though."
Malazan,2q4bby,SerBronnofBlackwater,5,Tue Dec 23 02:21:30 2014 UTC,The Bugg thing is answered in the esselmont books. It's possible that the other elder gods are misinformed as to the realities of the situation.
Malazan,2q4bby,anisotropy77,3,Tue Dec 23 06:32:30 2014 UTC,"Most of these questions get answered in Esselmont books. As for Karsa, Eriksson is currently writing a Karsa trilogy where he returns to his homeland to unite the Toblakai."
Malazan,2q4bby,nobadlinks,2,Tue Dec 23 00:01:47 2014 UTC,"I see, thanks.  I wasn't planning on readng the Esslemont books - I've had nothing but bad experiences with a different author picking up characters from someone else. Is it different here?"
Malazan,2q4bby,darthese,5,Tue Dec 23 00:45:30 2014 UTC,"You should read them, but you shouldn't read them expecting an Erikson book. They are not. They are Esslemont's and that does take some getting used to. Like Erikson's books, they do get better as they go on but many of the questions you've asked are addressed, at least in some fashion, in those books."
Malazan,2q4bby,BirdBathandBeyond,2,Tue Dec 23 03:01:38 2014 UTC,"I see, thanks.  I can't help but see this as a weakness of Erikson's work, though, if it depends on another author to close up very important (to me, at least) story lines."
Malazan,2q4bby,AreYouReadyToReddit,10,Tue Dec 23 03:10:51 2014 UTC,Well the Malazan world isn't just Eriksson's. Him and Esselmont came up with the world together. Before they started writing they decided who would address most storylines. They each handle the characters very well. For the most part they have different characters anyway.   They each have different writing styles and each have their faults. But I wouldn't call either of them bad writers.
Malazan,2q4bby,AreYouReadyToReddit,8,Tue Dec 23 03:41:26 2014 UTC,"It's not a weakness when you consider that Erikson's story was very specifically about the Fallen...ultimately that's the story he was telling. Everything else is tangential to that. The things with Mallick and Mael and even Karsa (beyond his involvement that we saw), while interesting, do not help to tell the story of the Fallen and so aren't included there. That's where ICE's books come in. They tell the other stories, give you some background, flesh out some of the more tangential arcs that will appear from time to time in such a massive epic story. Orb, Sceptre, Throne is essentially a TtH sequel but it doesn't have anything to do with the main story of the Fallen, so it's not part of that sequence.

Malazan,2q4bby,quadtard,2,Tue Dec 23 03:39:56 2014 UTC,"Well that's not 100 percent fair.  Erickson has explained on many occasions that he and Cam (Esslemont) created these worlds, plot lines and characters together during their gaming sessions.  Many of the people in Erickson's books (and vice verse) were Cam's.  Still, the writing styles are very different, and there will be times when Cam's voice for a character doesn't sound completely right because we heard it first from Erickson.  Kruppe is the biggest one of these.  Still a huge chunk of Cam's books use the same settings but largely follow different (or minor) characters from the Erickson books."

Malazan,2q20rz,OctopusPirate,2,Mon Dec 22 09:28:06 2014 UTC,"Essentially, Erikson tried to not base the books too much on real world civilizations. I could go and find the quote from one his ama's if you want (but I'd probably get lost reading everything). He talks about how he wanted to steer away from the 'invaders from the east are mongols, invaders from the north are vikings' fantasy troupe.   He goes on to comment on some of the influences that are in the series, such as Byzantine having a big influence on the Malazan Empire and the such, and about how there aren't really that many cultures you can just look at and go 'that's so and so', sure the Seven Cities pull from Middle East and Africa but from a anthropological view how else could a culture developed in a climate as harsh as theirs?   Essentially, there isn't really a in-depth analysis because of how Erikson has written."
Malazan,2q20rz,Ezzelino,4,Mon Dec 22 10:16:09 2014 UTC,"From the AMA   With a background in archaeology and anthropology we set out to create a realistic world disconnected from whatever cultural assumptions in this world that tend to (often unconsciously) bleed across into fantasy fiction. That was the ambition, anyway. What do I mean by cultural assumptions? Well, an example would be fantasy novels where the hordes come from the east, or down from the north, with the former looking like Mongols and the latter looking Vikings. The bias is both European and North Hemisphere, and you'll find those motifs rife in fantasy literature, which always bugged us. Accordingly, we dismantled those motifs and set out to work against them. We also dispensed with social prejudices (specifically in regard to women) and loosened up the hierarchies by making an avenue to power (magic) gender neutral. Again, in reaction to genre tropes, we moved away from the Eurocentric medieval social structures, and elected something more akin to Late Roman Empire in terms of culture, technology, with an almost Byzantine egalitarianism regarding skin colour, religion, traits, etc (Constantinople was remarkably multicultural at its height).   I presume that's what you were referring to."

I asked specifically because some did seem to have fairly specific influences (Alto Kan in physical/cultural descriptions, Wickans and other tribes having some strong Native American influences), but it's interesting how he intentionally steered away from that.  Thanks!"
Malazan,2q20rz,SerBronnofBlackwater,1 point,Mon Dec 22 19:12:23 2014 UTC,Well Li Heng and Dal Hon are on the same continent. So that's like having Africa and China within leagues of each other lol.

The final quarter, however, took about a day. So let me tell you, friend.. I don't think any other Malazan book has as epic a convergence as Toll the Hounds does. That last quarter you will gobble up more than any other."

Finished Assail recently, haven't decided when or what to reread next. Lately I've been editing the wiki a bit, so I've reread lots of BaB for that cause there's nearly nothing on there from the later ICE books and I liked BaB. Just this past week I've read lots of random chapters from most of the main books due to that too, it's pretty fun. I'll probably do a bunch more of that before tackling another read-through."

Malazan,2q1029,turnpikenorth,2,Mon Dec 22 04:05:43 2014 UTC,"They were pretty funny really, it's a shame they're so short. They're fairly different from the books though, a bit in the style of the writing and a bit in their overall tone. If you think about how Bauchelain and Korbal Broach were in MoI when it was just them or Emancipor Reece - as opposed to when Buke was around, which tended to bring out the more serious side of them - and that's a pretty good representation of the sort of comedy in them. Except the Crack'd Pot Trail, that's was a different sort of read.  They're worth the read though, you can get the first three in a single book for ~$10."

Fener isn't in his own realm any more though and can't help him. After Itkovian started with Rath'Fener he overextended himself and tried to take away the pain from everyone in the city. Paran probably accidentally used his power/influence as the Master of the Deck to keep Itkovian from failing, but there's more later in the book about it, so you'll have to just read on.

Malazan,2pw3n7,HumbleAsFudge,2,Sun Dec 21 12:17:56 2014 UTC,"Literally from chapter 1 of DG:   Beside him Icarium flicked a pebble over the cliff edge. It clicked and clattered on its way down to the boulder-strewn base. Under the ragged Spiritwalker robe – its orange faded to dusty rust beneath the endless sun – his grey skin had darkened into olive green, as if his father’s blood had answered this wasteland’s ancient call. His long, braided black hair dripped black sweat onto the bleached rock. Mappo pulled a mangled thorn from between his front teeth. ‘Your dye’s running,’ he observed, eyeing the cactus blade a moment before taking another bite.   What you're probably getting mixed up with is tTH/DoD"

Malazan,2pw3n7,TheBananaKing,1 point,Mon Dec 22 16:29:41 2014 UTC,...Im not sure if you thought that I was finished with book 3 but I decently did not know he is half toblakai... please watch out with that kind of info...
Malazan,2pw3n7,wells235,1 point,Sun Dec 21 13:19:23 2014 UTC,I was under the impression that he was olive green (that's what it says on his wiki)..
Malazan,2pw3n7,shadecrimson,2,Sun Dec 21 15:07:20 2014 UTC,"Technical niggle: follow the angle of those tusks. There's no way they come out of the jaw.   Tusks are canines (always curved btw), and protruding canines distort the cheek/lip forwards, uglying up the chiseled features somewhat. Elder Scrolls orcs are a decent model for this."
Malazan,2pw3n7,wells235,2,Sun Dec 21 01:18:36 2014 UTC,Love the feedback man. I totally see what you mean. I'll edit the mouth today

Malazan,2pv3fi,BakkhosBlood,5,Sat Dec 20 05:59:28 2014 UTC,You should check out the re-read on Tor.com
Malazan,2pv3fi,mgallowglas,3,Sat Dec 20 06:56:10 2014 UTC,"I already follow the Tor re-read, and while it is def helpful I can only read the newbie commentary due to spoilers- which in itself is subject to the same ""who was that character again?""  I'm talkin' about having like, a summary that hints at what will be touched on again, but won't make outright explicit how its important. I'll try to give an easy example of what I mean  Gardens of the Moon SPOILER"
Malazan,2pv3fi,Phhhhuh,1 point,Sat Dec 20 13:14:55 2014 UTC,Good suggestion!

Malazan,2pv3fi,the_dayman,1 point,Sat Dec 20 08:53:27 2014 UTC,Here's a thread I posted a while back trying to pinpoint where all the characters were at the end of midnight tides
Malazan,2pv3fi,SerBronnofBlackwater,1 point,Sat Dec 20 16:26:25 2014 UTC,Just wiki that shit. Will give the synopsis of the whole book
Malazan,2pv3fi,HumbleAsFudge,5,Sat Dec 20 06:16:08 2014 UTC,B...But the wiki is crap...Its literally full of spoilers
Malazan,2pv3fi,MoranthMunitions,1 point,Sat Dec 20 08:52:49 2014 UTC,"The wiki's not completely crap. It's terrible for spoilers, but if you've read everything it can be useful to read up on something in particular, or find when/where in the books something happened. Though it's also inconsistent with how much info is on each topic. But it has it's uses.  Definitely a bad suggestion though, unless you've read everything by Erikson at least you shouldn't go there."
Malazan,2pv3fi,SerBronnofBlackwater,1 point,Sat Dec 20 10:39:39 2014 UTC,I meant like Wikipedia the book synopsis. It'll tell you the whole plot of a book. Not that malazan wiki garbage.
Malazan,2pv3fi,HumbleAsFudge,1 point,Sat Dec 20 17:42:19 2014 UTC,"ohhhh yes, Indeed i had mistakenly thought you meant the malazan wiki. But yes wikipedia synopsis is actually a pretty good idea."
Malazan,2pv3fi,MoranthMunitions,2,Sat Dec 20 19:04:38 2014 UTC,"The Gardens of the Moon synopsis is missing the entire later half of the book- seems woefully incomplete, unless we're looking at different wikis?"
Malazan,2pum35,Zingbrit,1 point,Sat Dec 20 02:38:01 2014 UTC,"Most of what we know about Assail from previous books is conjecture and hearsay. Lots of stuff about ambiguous tyrants, apparently human, and there being endless enemies to wade through for spinnock durav.  You've pretty much got it right about Silverfox, hasn't been doing much since MoI."
Malazan,2pum35,cantlurkanymore,1 point,Sat Dec 20 04:38:58 2014 UTC,"Yes, it is basically on track.  A woman T'lan comes back and tells the clans around Silverfox that T'lan Imass have been held up on Assail.  The clans forego the decision to have Silverfox release them from their Vow so that they can rescue their kin on Assail."
Malazan,2puj0b,FelixViator,3,Sat Dec 20 02:04:52 2014 UTC,"Its been three years since Kit Soden and his band October Gold have been on the subreddit, and well I think they deserve more attention. His album ""Like a dancer unstrung"" is full of songs written by Steven,  and you just have to take a look at the song names in ""Bridge of the Sun"" to see where most of the inspiration came from."
Malazan,2puj0b,CaptainJonnypants,1 point,Sat Dec 20 02:12:21 2014 UTC,God damn... this makes me want to go read Malazan again so badly. Thanks for posting this. This music really adds a huge element of repeatability to a work of fiction I already really love.
Malazan,2psl3m,mostlyjoe,5,Fri Dec 19 15:26:14 2014 UTC,"On a second read it's actually one of my favourites in the series.   Once you actually begin to understand the world of Malazan the first book references so many things which you read and think ""how the hell was I meant to understand that first time?""   GOTM is like a story set on Earth where the author assumes you know the history of Earth and therefore mentions historical events and people like you should understand. When I come back to read it, actually knowing the background, I loved it."
Malazan,2psl3m,pushnupmmrep,1 point,Fri Dec 19 15:49:21 2014 UTC,"Ya. I get that. I had to spoil a few things via wiki to get details then I went back and reread it it flowed better. The series could use a prequel book that helps establish things like Soultaken, Warrens, etc."
Malazan,2psl3m,RemusofReem,2,Fri Dec 19 16:22:03 2014 UTC,Figuring out soultaken was a huge part of GOTM tho
Malazan,2psl3m,pushnupmmrep,1 point,Mon Dec 22 20:08:53 2014 UTC,All I can tell is Shapeshifter (kinda).
Malazan,2psl3m,Nichase,1 point,Mon Dec 22 22:33:37 2014 UTC,"That's true, I think as much as Malazan fans defend the books, there's no denying even an opening chapter setting the scene would definitely help the series!"
Malazan,2psl3m,frankhorse,7,Fri Dec 19 16:23:13 2014 UTC,The whole fun of the books is figuring things out for yourself. There are plenty of books wherein you get spoonfed.
Malazan,2psl3m,Phhhhuh,2,Sat Dec 20 01:26:17 2014 UTC,This. I love that I feel the need to continually study and use outside sources like I'm in a Malazan history class. I'm only on book 4 but am already excited for  reread. I love the feeling that I'm only scratching the surface and those ah ha moments when stuff clicks.
Malazan,2psl3m,Phhhhuh,1 point,Sat Dec 20 04:32:47 2014 UTC,"Hehe, doing a reread (I'm on book 8 of the reread) is... well, it's at least as rewarding as you'd guess ;) It is good to have something to look forward to!"
Malazan,2psl3m,TriscuitCracker,2,Sat Dec 20 07:28:51 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I find that I love in medias res in hindsight (compare The Iliad), but it's like the shock of being thrown in cold water the first time."
Malazan,2psl3m,tanngniost,2,Sat Dec 20 07:30:26 2014 UTC,Hell I'd take a Kruppe dreams about the creation of the world or some such.
Malazan,2psl3m,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Fri Dec 19 16:30:15 2014 UTC,"You have to figure it out from clues and context and what people say about such things. Erikson usually not do infodumps. I find that's half the fun! Warrens are more completely explained in Memories of Ice, and you learn more book by book. It's not an exacting magic system with rigid rules."
Malazan,2pplqv,Sithun,6,Thu Dec 18 19:27:03 2014 UTC,Midnight Tides
Malazan,2pplqv,i_am_not_you_or_me,2,Thu Dec 18 19:33:51 2014 UTC,Is there an explanation for how that was possible?
Malazan,2pplqv,Asiriya,9,Thu Dec 18 19:42:19 2014 UTC,"No, not particularly. However, Gothos is a supremely gifted mage and if the warrens are the blood of K'rul, frozen blood doesn't flow."
Malazan,2pplqv,i_am_not_you_or_me,2,Thu Dec 18 19:48:28 2014 UTC,"I like it!  The areas in Reaper's Gale where magic can't be used; is it assumed that if a warren user tried to cast magic there they would fail too? What constitutes the hold magic, how can it be used up, can warrens be used up in a similar way and how does that work; if K'ruls blood is meant to be everywhere, does it not move to fill places where it has been used up or something (I know there probably aren't answers for half of this)."
Malazan,2pplqv,Asiriya,5,Thu Dec 18 20:01:52 2014 UTC,"I imagine warrens like a layer above holds. There's raw elemental power (the hearts of the azath houses). Holds which allow channeling this power (though not elegantly) and the 'focusing' of warrens that allow more fine control of the powers, without destroying the body.  I believe the crystal desert had something akin to an otateral bomb go off that completely deadened the area. (don't they make reference to this in RG?) I'm currently on my reread and haven't made it to RG yet.  Most of this is just speculation."
Malazan,2pplqv,i_am_not_you_or_me,1 point,Thu Dec 18 20:09:56 2014 UTC,"Oh, I thought it was something more like what Beak does, draining the area? Can't remember either."

Malazan,2pplqv,lykideus,2,Thu Dec 18 19:46:42 2014 UTC,"I sort of had the impression that when the warren using mages show up, their connections to the warrens help the newer sorcery gain a presence there."
Malazan,2pplqv,Giotto,1 point,Thu Dec 18 21:15:24 2014 UTC,"It's kind of annoying that i can't open that link in mobile. I've been forgetting to open it on my pc like three times since your response. Will edit when I do.   Edit: Fair enough. But that kind of poses more questions than it answers. Why would Mael ask that? Was magic usage getting too widespread? Not to mention how Gothos managed that! And what does ""stagnate"" even entail?"
Malazan,2pplqv,Ezzelino,2,Fri Dec 19 05:43:48 2014 UTC,"Mael has his reasons, which you find out. As to stagnation, everything decays so much slower in lether. A character in reapers gale comments that the buildings are unnaturally long standing. Its a common idea umong the letherii that they've been split from the first empire for what? 1000 years when its more like 10s of thousands of years. Souls can't even enter hoods realm from lether."
Malazan,2pplqv,mostlyjoe,2,Sat Dec 20 00:08:31 2014 UTC,"From what I can tell the Warrens are passed around by racial heritage and cultural teachings. The Jaghut, Imass, and later Human cults keep the Warrens and their paths secret because of the power it gives them. Elder Warrens are also VERY dangerous to use for the untrained. And being beholden to a Warren means you might also come under the say of a god/ascendant attached to it.  So plenty of reasons why Warrens are not as widespread."
Malazan,2pplqv,TurboS40,1 point,Fri Dec 19 15:33:05 2014 UTC,"But the holds also have dire effects on its users, right? Chaos being the most readily apparent example.  Another tidbit I found on malazan.wikia.com on the subject:   The use of the Jaghut warren (a ritual by Gothos) had sealed the land prevented the evolution of magic, whereas in other places these Holds would evolve into the more refined magic form of Warrens.   ...And now I've read on and spoiled a bit of the ending. Don't go to wikis, people!"
Malazan,2pm60i,heavy_metal_samurai,20,Wed Dec 17 21:24:23 2014 UTC,"I think you may have read that wrong. Itkovian is not the mortal sword of the wolf gods.  Gruntle became the mortal sword of treach during the siege.  EDIT: Also, I agree with you. MoI is my favorite in the series, and probably one of the greatest fantasy novels I've read."
Malazan,2pm60i,i_am_not_you_or_me,1 point,Wed Dec 17 21:53:55 2014 UTC,"Oh? But don't the old women tell him that he will be he mortal sword, the sergeant will be the destriant, and Norul his shield anvil?  Or am I thinking of different gods?"
Malazan,2pm60i,cantlurkanymore,5,Thu Dec 18 13:40:29 2014 UTC,you're just mistaken thinking itkovian is involved at all. itkovian is not involved with the wolf gods. reread the scene and you'll see that the shoulderwomen tell itkovian that another has already taken on the title of mortal sword to the wolves.

Malazan,2pm60i,i_am_not_you_or_me,2,Fri Dec 19 05:34:16 2014 UTC,"No, that was answered at the end of MOI, it was MOI Spoiler. Spoiler because OP hasn't finished the book."
Malazan,2pm60i,TriscuitCracker,2,Fri Dec 19 10:51:09 2014 UTC,"Itkovian was in the scene, but he was there basically just as a mentor and to transfer leadership of the grey swords.  I don't think he was offered the position, but if he was, he declined."
Malazan,2pm60i,JestaKilla,5,Thu Dec 18 16:20:31 2014 UTC,"Yep, Itvokian is the MAN.   I liked Deadhouse Gates, but yeah MoI is what cemented me to read the series through to the end."
Malazan,2pm60i,brettcg16,6,Wed Dec 17 22:44:19 2014 UTC,"Memories of Ice is my favorite of the first three books.   I'd probably put Bonehunters as my absolute favorite, though."

Malazan,2pm60i,frankhorse,2,Thu Dec 18 04:37:55 2014 UTC,Just finished RG (I've read NoK and RotCG too) and I have to say MoI is my favourite so far with BH a close second.

Malazan,2pluy6,TriscuitCracker,9,Wed Dec 17 19:56:16 2014 UTC,"I don't remember them saying Mael wanted Traveller. They said Mael was trying to stop Traveller from reaching Hood, under the mistaken assumption that Hood was running from Traveller, and not waiting for him. Mael basically didn't want the god of death to die.  Can't remember exactly why the hounds would not stop Traveller, but I do remember the hounds liking him, probably related to that.  The hounds of light were waiting for a chance to get Dragnipur for their masters."
Malazan,2pluy6,SageOfTheWise,3,Wed Dec 17 20:32:09 2014 UTC,"As SageOfTheWise said, Mael wanted to stop Traveller from reaching the coast and going after Hood. He made the ocean very difficult to cross and it took Shadowthrone's intercession to get Traveller there in time. Mael wasn't part of the set-up/deal in the beginning, so he wanted to maintain the status quo and have Traveller be on an eternal rabbit chase while Hood went around doing Hood's job.  The master of the Hounds of Light knew that Rake was going to fight someone in Darujhistan and that Dragnipur could be up for grabs. He positioned the Hounds of Light to swipe the ""kill anything"" sword and almost got away with it - but for those meddling mortals...  The Hounds of Shadow were there to protect Anomander's sacrifice and deal with the fallout. They also knew that the Hounds of Light were coming, even if it was nice to hang out with the one who ""infiltrated"" their group."
Malazan,2pluy6,Udinaas,2,Wed Dec 17 20:53:46 2014 UTC,"Aside from what /u/SageOfTheWise and /u/Udinass said, I'd like to offer up a different interpretation:  Never assume Shadowthrone is telling the truth. Even though he has a past with Traveler,  Shadowthrone is more than willing to manipulate people toward his desired end."
Malazan,2pluy6,AreYouReadyToReddit,1 point,Thu Dec 18 14:31:52 2014 UTC,"I took the hounds issue as a sort of pack mentality. They know traveller and respect him. They are loyal to shadow throne but not blindly. Also traveller, cotillion, ST were all of a pack(group) and maybe the hounds see them as alphas.   This could be wrong of course but it's how I remember interpreting it."

When I read I picture them as just big looking people, kinda like how you drew Karsa, but I'm not sure if that's how they would be. Is there anyone who pictures them as more monster looking?"
Malazan,2pjzof,RuffiansAndThugs,5,Wed Dec 17 06:46:24 2014 UTC,"It's actually largely with everyone from HoC, so you should be fine. As long as you remember that Felisin died, leaving the rebellion pretty much crushed with Leoman in charge of most of the remaining army of the Apocalypse. Tavore's army is still chasing them. Dujek's army is headed there too, though you don't see much of them and those you do you will only recognise as background characters.  Trull and Onrack are still just at the Throne of the Empire (or w/e it's called), Trull having just finished telling his story to the other T'lan Imass (i.e. Midnight Tides).  Heboric escaped the encampment with Felisin the Younger - with L'oric's help - bringing Scillara, though L'oric has gone off they still have Greyfrog. Pust brings them in to his temple, where Cutter has been lamenting his loss of Apsalar, who ran off to kill people for Cotillion, so Cutter has decided to help out them for something to do.   Paran is the Master of the Deck, but he's been retired in Darujhistan for a while. Karsa's run off into the desert to do some soul searching effectively. Mappo and Icarium are probably back at step 1, Icarium tends to forget things between books.  I think that's all the main characters."

Stick with it, it's worth it. You'll get some recognizable GoTM characters back next book as well.  In regards to your first point, I'm pretty sure if I remember correctly that the rent was opened by a crazed high mage wandering the seas.  Felisin is a bit annoying but how would you feel if your brother deserted you by betraying the Empire and then your sister let your parents killed while simultaneously putting you in a labour mine where you had to fend for yourself.

Malazan,2pj7l5,Cibfx,2,Thu Dec 18 13:54:44 2014 UTC,"Mages of a certain power level can rip a hole into most things. The problem lies in ""What's on the other side of the hole?"" and ""What happens to us when we go through it?"". The true warren masters can smoothly create a portal to exactly where they want to go without ill effects. There are risks to not having a warren's master with you because dangerous things can happen.  Kulp ripping a hole in the unknown warren is dangerous because he doesn't know the answer to both AND the water/undead dragon/whatever is in the warren and so on are rushing to that rip at the same time. He and the others on the Silanda have little to no control over what is happening.   Felisin is a young teenage girl from a rich family who was spoiled for her entire life - up until her parents were murdered in front of her, her sister cast her into prison and more people got murdered in front of her. She was also abused and started selling herself to survive, before her quasi-stable arrangements were blown up by a weirdo priest, creepster guy and unknown mage. She's also got bloodfly toxin in her and had to walk across a desert and go into a dangerous unknown warren as well.   Does that make you sympathize a little more with her?  Do you have any questions about Icarium and Mappo? Or the segments involving the Wickans and civilian evacuation?"
Malazan,2pj7l5,Udinaas,2,Wed Dec 17 21:05:40 2014 UTC,"I just started it the other day and I've found it easier to get into and also better written than Gardens of the Moon. Part of this is probably because I don't find the magic stuff as bewildering. Anyways, to me the seven cities have more character than Genbackis (as it comes across in the first book) and the descriptions are better."
Malazan,2pj7l5,choihanam,1 point,Fri Jan 2 08:57:17 2015 UTC,"DG gets infinitely better once you pass the halfway point, so there's that.  As for your question about Kulp, I don't remember this scene exactly, but one thing about magic in this world is that if you're willing to self-destruct, you can do much more than if you want to keep yourself alive. Using magic can consume you if you don't control it."
Malazan,2pj7l5,montaron87td,1 point,Wed Dec 17 14:04:29 2014 UTC,"Mappo and Icarium are introduced with no physical description, I spent several chapters picturing 2 humans before I found out they are both beastly humanoids of some form.   I knew I'd read this recently somewhere. In their first appearance in DG, chapter one, there's a lot of descriptive stuff about Icarium (height, skin colour, half-Jaghut) and while there's not much in that way for Mappo, the way that it says ""full-blood Trell"" and mentions the thousand years behind his eyes implies that he's not human.  Though it's easy to overlook descriptions with so much information getting shoved on you at the start of each book, I don't blame you for forgetting."

The Kell Hunters were used for hunting down fleeing soldiers and harrying the enemy, effectively acting more as a sort of cavalry. I can grab my copy of The Crippled God and will try to get back to you if I can find where its talked about, pretty sure it is one of the Stormy and Gesler sections when they join with the K'chain Che'malle and are discussing disposition of troops and what they can do."

Gothos it's powerful on his own right, and his son is Icarium.  Gothos also froze death on an entire continent. Hood waged a war against death, and came out as the good of death.  Let us not forget Hood slamming Sister Reverence either.  And best of all, Jaghut humor.  Between Tuffy, Gothos refusing tea for Kallor, the 13 Jaghut army, and Gothos meetings in Blood and Bone, it's just too great."

From Coltaine to Nil and Nether, it seems that every single Wickan is competent to some degree. Additionally their souls get passed on by swarms of Crows. To an extent they exemplify the older idea of the 'Noble Savage' because it always seemed that the Wickans, while not perfect, didn't suffer from a lot of the fractiousness that the rest of the humans did."

That helped me stick past gotm and I'm so glad I did. I came across the malazan series purely by chance. The only time Amazon auto recommendations have been right. What I like most is that he tells you to have faith in the author but at the same time he respects his readers. He won't spoonfeed you. Makes you work for it and without having confidence in a readers intelligence, that is not possible. This series has spoiled me. I judge books by different yardsticks now. It took me 3 1/2 years to finish the entire series and not only the story but the little quotes he includes interspersed throughout will always stick with me."

Everything about the books was so masterful, IMO, and they had a huge impact on me in a real way. The compassion and empathy the stories inspired was a great gift. Not to mention the epicness, heroicness, etc of both major and minor characters.   I also really loved the fact he steps back from the traditional novel model. I like his point of having faith in the author, and I did, and I do just so long as the writing is good.   There are a couple spoilers I am not sure which books they're in."

Malazan,2pe307,TriscuitCracker,8,Mon Dec 15 21:27:30 2014 UTC,"From the recent Reread of the Fallen questions:   The mule? I have always been surprised at how often this question is asked, when to me the answer’s so obvious, I mean, as an existential manifestation of archetypal paradigms in a quotidian context of subliminity in an exclusively ungulate but decidedly simian expression of attitudinal stances so often taken under trying or at least confabulating circumstances, as reflected in this extension of reality we so blithely, if somewhat disingenuously, call Fantasy.   Mules are frustratingly belligerent when it comes to explaining themselves, or so I’ve found.   Though I'm sure that's purposefully not meant to help."
Malazan,2pe307,MoranthMunitions,1 point,Mon Dec 15 23:23:34 2014 UTC,"If I'm interpretting that correctly, the Mule is a plot device, with both animal and human characteristics.   Personally, I think the Mules are some kind of Elder God, doing what Mael's been doing and hanging out with the humans/keeping an eye on the humans who have the potential to cause a heck of a lot of chaos. Maybe they are Chaos aspects?"

Malazan,2papug,Aiolus,2,Tue Dec 16 06:58:20 2014 UTC,I think I had a similar issue and went back to a previous book for some glossary info about warrens and people's places in them.   Not sure though it's a vague memory.
Malazan,2papug,holyplankton,2,Mon Dec 15 01:39:02 2014 UTC,"The best reason I can think of (other than Erikson ""couldn't be bothered""), is that the later books are not really introducing new characters and ideas. Once you get past the Bonehunters the story really starts converging, rather than growing, and the major players are mostly in place, limiting the need for the Dramatis Personae and the like. By that point you are expected to know the players and the layout of the game."
Malazan,2p816t,arachno_capitalist,4,Sun Dec 14 01:34:16 2014 UTC,"I always figured it was Felisin (much later on) or Adjunct Lorn who died for Paran. There's no-one else close to him that dies really, as Tattersail doesn't really die, she just soul-shifts. I figured it had to be someone he was close to at the time, though not make it need to be immediate. Anyone else that's later on he doesn't really have that much of a connection to at that point, like the other Bridgeburners. Or probably Tattersail either, I think it happens just after he reaches the 2nd Army's camp, from memory.  Edit: Also, have fun picking the small things that are nearly impossible on the first read. One good example is the characters that appear only momentarily in multiple books, e.g. Aragan. He was everywhere, just the one or two sentences in different books, often a different rank too, I only recognised the name again once first time round. I revamped his wiki page the other day which it took ages, though mainly because he became an important character in an ICE books so I had to reread half of it. I love all the smaller details."
Malazan,2p816t,MoranthMunitions,2,Sun Dec 14 02:10:12 2014 UTC,"I have an alternate idea. What if the person that was traded for Paran was Whiskeyjack? Think about it, Hood would probably bargain for someone he wants. He has a grudge against Whiskeyjack for stealing back Dunsparrow. He also needs the Bridgeburners later on in TTH. Also, think about how Whiskeyjack ultimately died. A spot of bad luck and his leg got crushed by a pillar in GotM. He kept putting off getting it treated which led to his death and it just happened to break at exactly the wrong time. That sounds like it could be Oponn nudging him towards his death in fulfillment of the bargain with Hood."

Meaningless even' and 2 phrases later the apparition of hood sais 'Someone close to you shall walk through Deaths Gate... in your place"" (speaking to Ganoes)  Early on GotM, when Ganoes is visiting his family residence, there's mention when Tavore is talking to Ganoes about how Felisin be devastated hearing Ganoes isn't staying at his home for long and somewhere in that event, there's mention Tavore is not as close to Ganoes as Felisin is.  At the time of Ganoes assassination, Tattersail has almost no idea who Ganoes is, and Toc the younger also sees Ganoes as a nobleborn. So its very unlikely that Oppon chose any of those 2.  The evidence i can come up with that its the Adjunct who was to die for Ganoes is that her death was pretty much meaningless. Also, later in the book, the Adjunct mentions in a monologue that she was becoming comfortable with Ganoes and started enjoying his presence."

Hell there's even this line from Heboric in DG:   Your brother disappearing on Genabackis took the life out of your father...so I've heard    And besides, Tattersail couldn't have been the intended target since it was intended to be someone close to him at the time, and they'd never met yet.   who paid Paran's assassination by Sorry?

I always felt it was Toc that was cursed and that's why he dies bunches. Felisin makes sense too and is probably the right answer.
Malazan,2p816t,gbardelli,1 point,Sun Dec 14 04:38:41 2014 UTC,"His mother dies after the Host become outlawed by the Empire. It was said to be an ""unconsequential death in his shadow"" if I remember correctly. I don't think the death of Felisin, however it happens, is that inconsequential. Also, it comes after both parents are dead. Thus leaving but Felisin for Tavore to prove her loyalty to the Empress.    Edit: I think you'll find enough of an answer in DG's prologue.    Edit 2: found the quote    ""Sister Tavore, did our brother's disappearance cut you so deep? How great his failing you must imagine to seek this recompense... and then, to make your loyalty absolute, you chose between me and Motherfor the symbolic sacrifice.

Malazan,2p7m2a,Aiolus,2,Sun Dec 14 01:52:45 2014 UTC,"Yeah, Baruk kind of sent him the glass thing with the Trygalle Trade Guild in Memories of Ice, as Kruppe brings Quick Ben one of Baruk's bhokaral with a message when he's trying to send the others Moranth munitions.  I presume from this quote that Baruk asked Quick Ben to make the device:   Karpolan nodded. ‘With financial assistance from a certain cabal in Darujhistan, yes. His words were thus: “The Empress cannot lose such leaders as Coltaine of the Crow Clan.’” The trader grinned. ‘Extraordinary for an outlaw under a death sentence, wouldn’t you say?’ He leaned forward and held out a hand, palm up. Something shimmered into existence on it, a small oblong bottle of smoky grey glass on a silver chain. ‘And, from an alarmingly mysterious mage among the Bridgeburners, this gift was fashioned.’ He held it out to Coltaine. ‘For you. Wear it. At all times, Fist.’   It's not really explicitly mentioned anywhere that Baruk sent it, however just before the epilogue of DG two of Baruk's demonic bhok'arala find the small smoky glass bottle with a crack in it and one says ""He's in there alright!"", and then they recover the body too.  I presumed that Baruk fixed his body then put the soul back in too."

Malazan,2p4hjp,tez205,20,Fri Dec 12 23:18:20 2014 UTC,"Um sort of, but not completely, because the books never come right out and explain it.  See, there are these things called warrens, sort of other universes, or pocket universes. Mages and wizards tap into these warrens to make magic stuff happen. How that actually happens never gets defined. Just like it never gets defined how a crossbow works. Or how the Moranth munitions work.  Basically it's the equivalent of fiction in our world in that nobody in fiction bothers to explain how cars, or guns, or cellphones, or anything else works.   So, you just gotta kind of accept that mages channel power through warrens to make magic stuff happen."
Malazan,2p4hjp,mgallowglas,3,Fri Dec 12 23:25:08 2014 UTC,"I do believe the Moranth munitions are explained though. They are filled with a chemical compound which explodes when it comes into contact with oxygen, and the Moranth have some technique for creating this compound capsuled within clay. Then a ""fuse"" works by using acid on the clay surface, a certain amount of acid takes a certain amount of time to go through the clay.  And some special cases, like Sharpers seem to have shrapnel packed into the shell and such."
Malazan,2p4hjp,Phhhhuh,2,Sat Dec 13 12:25:08 2014 UTC,"Having some experience with chemistry, I imagine they produce the munitions in a space filled with a gas that is inert to those chemicals being utilized to create all of their various chemical explosives. And I believe you are correct when you say oxygen, but in theory there are numerous potential other chemicals in the air that could take that place.  But that is getting very far into speculation to ascertain what the actual atmospheric composition of that world is."

There are Warrens, which are other, magical worlds, and mages can pull power from them to do stuff. Each warren has its own aspect. For example, Tellan is Fire, and Omtose Phellack is Ice, and Mockra is mind. There's also Chaos, which is the between worlds, and mages can draw on it as well, though it's more destructive and hard to control. Warrens can also be physically entered for various reasons, though it's dangerous.  It's never really well defined, and is intentionally left malleable and vague."

Might include spoilers if you are new to series, i.e. GotM  well, when opening a warren they tear the fabric between the worlds, I usually picture it like opening a zipper out of the thin air and a fissure/rent/hole appears with the other world visual, you walk through and enter it, after which you have to sear the 'wound', close the door behind you. As for the physical manifestation when conjuring, it depends on the type of magic, some just trick the mind, make you see things, some can be visual and freaking awesome, and when they are SE gives a vivid image to the reader. Drawing from the warren, preparing for attack before actually releasing the magic, cannot be seen, but other mages can sense it, and occasional susceptible individuals (goosebumps, change of pressure in the air...)"

The Malazan empire is at least 99 years old. The Deadhouse extended the life span of those who resided in it. I forget where this was talked about though.    In Bonehunters, when Karsa meets that tribe before boarding the Edur ship, the tribesmen talk about the Iron Prophet aka Iskar Jarak aka Wiskyjack warning them. The tribesmen made it sound like long ago.   If I remember correctly, this was during the Seven Cities campaign, around the time of the birth of the bridge burners.   At first I thought maybe it was just Dassem hiding his ascendency, but that bit in bonehunters makes me think they're all older than they should be.   I have an answer for this, but I'm really struggling to word this. Basically, he's a god, and awakening him to grief instead of vengeance (from TtH) is his path back to being Dessembrae, lLrd of Tragedy."

I would say the Old Guard are anywhere from 100-150 years old.  Its kind of vague as you've seen.    The part about Dassem being at the chaining is more straight-forward.  There have been many Chainings of the Cripped God through the years.  Dassem, Shadowthrone, and Cotillion were just at the most recent one."

The ICE books take place at different points along the main series in different parts of the world, detailing back story and trying up loose ends you saw in the main series Spoiler They are good in their own way, definitely worth reading for all the great backstory, but not as well written as Erikson. I read all the ICE books after the main series, and am in the middle of my first reread, and it's like it's a whole new series again with a zillion AhHA moments. You could also mix and match ICE and the main series using the listing on the sidebar. Also instead of the wiki, either ask us questions, we'll attempt to give spoiler free answers if we can, or use the Tor Re-Read of the Fallen linked in the sidebar for great summary and critique.

And I am certain that on my next reading, I will see even more things and connections that on either of my prior 2 readings.  I think SE actually answered a question asking if he intentionally made the series for rereading because of all the foreshadowing and its ilk. I don't recall his answer verbatim but from what I can recall I think the tl;dr was it being unintentional and naturally evolved out of the writing."

Malazan,2ozqqt,craptacus,5,Thu Dec 11 18:19:46 2014 UTC,"So the concept behind cutting off a priest of Fener's hands is that they are sent to Fener as part of a ritual so that he can dispense justice on the offender.  Heboric was subjected to this in a miscarriage of justice caused by some sort of politics or something.  This meant that Fener was stuck with these hands he couldn't do anything with (and were described as basically poisonous to him), so he seals them away until Heboric dies and retrieves them.  Touching the Jade Giant overwhelms this defense and forces Fener from his realm.  Fener has not taken shelter within Heboric. There is more to both of their stories later in the series."

Memories of Ice clears it up somewhat and it gets explained through context.

Malazan,2ov481,frankhorse,8,Wed Dec 10 14:02:17 2014 UTC,The slow revelation of the Silanda over the course of the books is one of my favorite things in the series. And there's still more about it to come.
Malazan,2ov481,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Wed Dec 10 16:37:54 2014 UTC,"Indeed! Glad you're enjoying it, there's plenty of ""Ah HAH!"" moments throughout Malazan but HoC is the first one that goes back in the timeline."

Malazan,2ov4p2,Nichase,9,Wed Dec 10 20:50:56 2014 UTC,And that tall guy was all like ♫ Can I Get A Witness ♫?
Malazan,2ov4p2,AreYouReadyToReddit,2,Wed Dec 10 18:56:39 2014 UTC,"I originally read this in the voice of a black baptist preacher version of Karsa. ""Can I get the congregation to Witness?"" ""Witness!"""
Malazan,2ov4p2,ChainedDog,2,Mon Dec 15 02:37:40 2014 UTC,Witness.
Malazan,2ov4p2,photonsnphonons,7,Wed Dec 10 20:50:18 2014 UTC,Actually my favourite part in the books is when that guy talks. He's quite funny!
Malazan,2ov4p2,LegSpinner,5,Wed Dec 10 17:05:28 2014 UTC,"Especially when he talks with the other guy about stuff, man I was laughing so hard."
Malazan,2ov4p2,xolotl92,4,Wed Dec 10 17:26:38 2014 UTC,"Shoot, I missed that on my first read. Must schedule the first 3 rereads anon!"
Malazan,2ov4p2,strawberrysundaeandt,6,Wed Dec 10 18:16:48 2014 UTC,Their are more than enough worthy examples of people who manage to easily convey what part they're referring to without spoilers on this sub. All you're doing is undermine the effort of people to keep this place spoiler free.  There are tons of examples of people conveying what part of a book they're at and their excitement without revealing an entire battle.
Malazan,2ov4p2,HumbleAsFudge,9,Wed Dec 10 20:15:41 2014 UTC,"I gave you a sympathy upvote. People are being dicks - this is reddit after all. Just enjoy the books, and don't worry so much about spoilers. The fact that people re-read this 3.4-million-word series over and over should be evidence enough that knowing what happens doesn't make it any less awesome. I had a few things spoiled for me, though never by this sub, and I still give the series a 100. Out of 10.   We're all more than willing to discuss things without cheapening the experience for you. Just chill!"
Malazan,2ov4p2,TurboS40,1 point,Thu Dec 11 02:07:18 2014 UTC,"thank you you're right, I do need to chill its just that I get easily irritated, and in the previous thread I was getting flak for claiming that its possible to use inductive knowledge with the malazan series, something that has happened in the past due to ""harmless titles"" which had ames, events , etc.   But Ultimately you're right even with somethings spoiled for me both GoTM and DG were great reads, and i really look forward to reading the rest of the series."
Malazan,2ov4p2,HumbleAsFudge,3,Thu Dec 11 08:45:06 2014 UTC,That bit kicks me right in the feelings every time.
Malazan,2ov4p2,pdoxney,2,Wed Dec 10 14:46:20 2014 UTC,Woah woah woah. I didn't know things happened in this series. Spoilers!
Malazan,2ov4p2,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Wed Dec 10 16:38:55 2014 UTC,DUDE!   Especially the part where the guys and those other guys fight the dudes at the place and the thing happens but BOOM actually it was another thing all along that was being done by the guys from the other place.
Malazan,2ov4p2,titanemesis,1 point,Wed Dec 10 15:07:54 2014 UTC,My all time favourite scene was when they went into that one warren and saw that thing and heard those sounds. That gods balls indeed.

Malazan,2ou783,TocYounger,4,Wed Dec 10 05:44:01 2014 UTC,"Is it possible to have a huge warning in the submission form in regards to titles?  That might be more effective than the sidebar that hardly anyone new on Reddit read anyway.  And I have no experience with reddit CSS apart from what I've seen in other subs, but would something like what they have in /r/relationships where all posts are flaired and the flairs can be filtered on be possible? That way you avoid seeing posts with flairs from after the book you want."
Malazan,2ou783,montaron87td,2,Wed Dec 10 08:38:54 2014 UTC,"Is it possible to have a huge warning in the submission form in regards to titles?   I like this idea. I don't think it's possible to make everyone happy, but this would be cheap insurance against accidental spoilers."
Malazan,2ou783,TurboS40,1 point,Wed Dec 10 12:50:47 2014 UTC,For example:   http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/submit  http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/submit?selftext=true  Or even the /r/relationship submission form with text already filled in
Malazan,2ou783,montaron87td,8,Wed Dec 10 12:56:49 2014 UTC,"Thanks for this. My other biggest pet peeve is post titles even mentioning a character is alive in a book. I'm only on book 5. If a title says ""so and so's story arc in Crippled God"", you've basically ruined any tension there may be that that character may not make it to that book."
Malazan,2ou783,goodnightlight,4,Wed Dec 10 09:52:12 2014 UTC,"This is a tricky one. It's allowed on /r/asoiaf with the rationale that characters are often mentioned long after their deaths. I think people just need to be considerate - if someone's fate is unclear in book x, and is revealed in book y, it's probably best to keep any hints out of the thread title."
Malazan,2ou783,TurboS40,1 point,Wed Dec 10 12:50:01 2014 UTC,Absolutely - that's the heart of my comment.
Malazan,2ou783,goodnightlight,2,Wed Dec 10 13:25:59 2014 UTC,this. You're a absolutely correct.
Malazan,2ou783,HumbleAsFudge,1 point,Wed Dec 10 11:41:31 2014 UTC,"So you basically want every post title to be ""something that happened in book X"" because anything else would be a spoiler?"
Malazan,2ou783,montaron87td,2,Wed Dec 10 10:42:10 2014 UTC,Not at all. I'm confused as to why anyone would disagree with me on this but it takes all kinds. You can simply say: Discussion of character X (spoilers all books).  That way I know to avoid it and it doesn't give away anything since even dead characters could be mentioned in any book.  I'm not sure how that doesn't make sense. It's not that hard to do and most people understand this anyway.
Malazan,2ou783,goodnightlight,1 point,Wed Dec 10 10:49:40 2014 UTC,"But what if I've only read through 8 books and want to discuss someone? I'll add a spoiler until book 8, avoiding spoilers for the last two books, but that immediately gives away that a character is alive or has an arc in book 8."
Malazan,2ou783,montaron87td,2,Wed Dec 10 10:54:24 2014 UTC,"Just say ""discussion of X (I've read through book 8)"". That doesn't tell me anything about anything that happens since you may be waiting for something to happen etc.."
Malazan,2ou783,goodnightlight,2,Wed Dec 10 11:03:49 2014 UTC,So if for example I say: Question about Quick Ben [Spoilers DoD]   That would be fine with you? Because doesn't that imply QB is still alive in DoD? Even if I might just only want to keep from spoiling that book for myself?
Malazan,2ou783,montaron87td,0,Wed Dec 10 15:10:41 2014 UTC,"I've already answered this. ""Question about Quick Ben (I've read through ___)"""
Malazan,2ou783,goodnightlight,1 point,Wed Dec 10 16:58:30 2014 UTC,"(I've read through ___)""   And when you say that, people will give you answers containing info exactly up until the place you've read. Which is exactly the same effect as saying [Spoilers ___]"
Malazan,2ou783,montaron87td,1 point,Wed Dec 10 18:25:44 2014 UTC,"I see your point. Either way my point was saying things that specifically indicate a character is alive in a book should be a no no. In this circumstance, I do believe there is a difference in saying [spoilers _] and (i've read through _). The first sounds to me like you are specifically addressing events in ___ while the later just says ""you can spoil through __, but my comments do not necessarily pertain to __ so rest assure that I am not spoiling anything with this title, just advising the reader where I am in the series and if you are not also at that point, you may want to avoid this thread."""
Malazan,2ou783,goodnightlight,1 point,Wed Dec 10 20:02:45 2014 UTC,"That's just a perception you've added to the tag. It simply means that anything up until and including that book is allowed, the rest should be tagged. Why you add the tag to a certain book is completely personal."
Malazan,2ou783,montaron87td,1 point,Wed Dec 10 20:06:13 2014 UTC,Is that really the only way you can think of to avoid spoilers?
Malazan,2ou783,herminator,1 point,Wed Dec 10 15:01:45 2014 UTC,"When names and books aren't possible in the same title without apparently spoiling that someone is alive and you have to use a book for your spoiler tag, then wouldn't names be disallowed in the titles by default?"
Malazan,2ou783,montaron87td,1 point,Wed Dec 10 15:10:27 2014 UTC,"You do not have to use a book in your spoiler tag. You can use ""spoilers all"" or ""spoilers <character> storyline"". Furthermore, if the book is the first book that that character appears in, then it is fine to mention the book (the Itkovian example that spurred this thread would be an example)."
Malazan,2ou783,herminator,1 point,Wed Dec 10 15:44:17 2014 UTC,"But in those cases we're back to the old problem. If I've only read until book 8, I don't want to use spoilers all or a character arc as a spoiler tag because I don't want to be spoiled and there might be stuff coming up which I don't know about."
Malazan,2ou783,montaron87td,1 point,Wed Dec 10 15:47:18 2014 UTC,"You say ""No spoilers beyond book X please!""."
Malazan,2ou783,herminator,2,Wed Dec 10 15:54:11 2014 UTC,"How is this any better than just saying ""[spoilers book 8]"" like we currently do?"
Malazan,2ou783,Zingbrit,0,Wed Dec 10 16:15:30 2014 UTC,"Because ""[spoilers book 8]"" indicates that your post contains spoilers specifically for book 8, whereas ""[no spoilers beyond book 8]"" just indicates that you don't want spoilers beyond that points, and implies that the post may contain spoilers for any of the books before that.  E.g. ""About Felisin [no spoilers beyond MT please]"" does not mean Felisin appears in Midnight Tides."
Malazan,2ou783,herminator,1 point,Wed Dec 10 16:23:39 2014 UTC,"I see your point. I guess I usually assume people will be asking questions about things they just read or are currently reading, so the two titles basically seem the same.  Another possible issue would be that if someone were to post a question about something Quick Ben did in MoI, but they've read through MT so they put [no spoilers past MT]. Then I come along, having just read MoI and having a similar question, but I wouldn't want to look at the aforementioned post since I haven't read through MT, so I either make another post or miss out on the discussion. Saying [spoilers MoI] just seems more straightforward."
Malazan,2ou20o,Monthral,6,Wed Dec 10 04:51:26 2014 UTC,I just finished my first reread of DG and MOI. I gotta say DG is my favorite book in the series. What I enjoyed most about it which i find lacking in MOI is the story pacing moves at a pretty good speed. Lots of action and real suspense. The characters were realistic with believable goals and reactions to events. The amount if lore concerning sorcery was really interesting as well.
Malazan,2ou20o,doomfood,2,Wed Dec 10 05:51:22 2014 UTC,"I agree, DG has a nice increasing pace towards the end, while MoI is somewhat erratic, with slow parts even throughout the last few chapters."
Malazan,2ou20o,montaron87td,1 point,Wed Dec 10 10:20:59 2014 UTC,Where would you rate GotM if DG is your favourite?
Malazan,2ou20o,_zont_,2,Wed Dec 10 19:43:28 2014 UTC,"29% into DG what about you ? I have read it once before however, so I vaguely remember a few events further down.   Im rereading DG because i took a break about 1/4 through MoI, forgot everything so I started again ^ ^"
Malazan,2ou20o,HumbleAsFudge,1 point,Wed Dec 10 20:12:34 2014 UTC,"Yeah this is sorta what i'm looking for, someone who is in the process of reading the book. I'm 58% of the way through the book at the moment."
Malazan,2ou20o,mgallowglas,1 point,Thu Dec 11 10:04:15 2014 UTC,I'm finishing up my second reread of Deadhouse Gates. I'm more than happy to talk about it.
Malazan,2ou20o,_zont_,1 point,Wed Dec 10 05:17:58 2014 UTC,Did you find a lot more clarity on your reread compared to the first read? I'm on my first read and I feel like sometimes i don't understand certain characters motivations for doing certain things. Should i just be patient and await further information from subsequent books or am i perhaps not taking it all in and glossing over DG?
Malazan,2ou20o,mgallowglas,3,Wed Dec 10 19:42:49 2014 UTC,"Oh absolutely. One of my favorite parts about Malazan is that I think it actually gets better on the rereads. Hemingway is one of Steven's favorite authors, and like Hemingway, Steven actually puts more stuff beneath the surface of the written words than he does on the surface level of his prose. Like with most Hemingway stories, some of the meaning of Malazan is only possible to get in rereading, as then you have a context of the whole story both in the individual characters and the scope of the tale in it's entirety. Keep on reading, and never mind that you don't understand everything. Some of it never really gets explained."
Malazan,2ou20o,_zont_,1 point,Wed Dec 10 20:22:11 2014 UTC,"Interesting because at points I find myself thinking ""yeah I'll understand more when I reread this book on my 2nd lap of the series"" as if I've already committed and know deep down that I'll reread. I read asoiaf twice and know the value of a reread in terms of understanding more the second time round."
Malazan,2ou20o,mgallowglas,1 point,Wed Dec 10 21:49:00 2014 UTC,Is there anything that would help in my current read through of the book? I felt kinda stupid when i realised that the trell and jaghut aren't just tribalistic humans and that they were something else entirely.
Malazan,2ou20o,mgallowglas,2,Thu Dec 11 10:16:29 2014 UTC,"Try not to think of it like you would any other fantasy series. Think of it as historical fiction from another world, written for people from that world. It's not going to go into a lot of details about the world that the average reader would know. Kinda like if someone from the Malazan world got a hold of some historical fiction about World War II. The author probably isn't going to go into a lot of extra details on what tanks are, trusting on the common shared knowledge of our culture background and education.   This figuring things out is just part of the greater Malazan experience. Some people groove on it. Some people don't."
Malazan,2ou20o,end_O_the_world_box,1 point,Thu Dec 11 15:47:19 2014 UTC,"Oh no, I understand that and all and I think it's an awesome writing technique. I just meant for the visualisation of the trell/jaghut, something that I probably missed in a sentence somewhere along the line."
Malazan,2ou20o,end_O_the_world_box,1 point,Thu Dec 11 17:20:36 2014 UTC,Maybe. I don't recall off hand which books the descriptions are in.
Malazan,2ou20o,Nightender,1 point,Thu Dec 11 17:42:42 2014 UTC,"I'm 70-80% through DG, first read. I've definitely had some trouble with people groups versus other races. I imagine the Trell as just hulking, juggernaut-like creatures with brown-yellow, very dry, almost scaly skin. It's a bit mottled, with some subtle yellow-green patterning. Dreadlocks. Huge tusks. The jaghut are a lot like orcs, but bigger and more of a magnificent kind of evil than a shambling, undergroundy kind of evil if that makes sense. Blue-green, smooth skin. Huge tusks. Icarium and mappo are definitely my favorite storyline in this book."
Malazan,2ou20o,_zont_,1 point,Sun Dec 14 06:53:28 2014 UTC,"I never took them as evil simply because they were orcs/trolls or whatever similar fantasy equivalent, their storyline does seem very intricate. I take it there's a lot more of them after Deadhouse Gates?"
Malazan,2ou20o,Nightender,1 point,Tue Dec 16 17:57:24 2014 UTC,"I mean I don't know I'm on DG right now, but I'm sure we learn quite a bit more about them, yeah. You're probably right, they wouldn't be evil as a whole, but from what we know, it sounds like they have power-hungry tendencies."
Malazan,2ou20o,_zont_,1 point,Tue Dec 16 22:55:53 2014 UTC,"I'm about thirty pages away from being done with DG.  I don't want it to end, even though it means I'll get to move on to Memories of Ice next.  I'm enjoying these books a great deal."
Malazan,2ou20o,_zont_,2,Wed Dec 10 18:44:46 2014 UTC,Did you think DG was on a different level to GotM? Reason I ask if because I quite enjoyed GotM but read that it's one of the weakest and DG is one of the strongest. I may be letting other reviews rub off me to much. So far I think DG is good but I wouldn't say its amazing
Malazan,2ou20o,Nightender,1 point,Wed Dec 10 19:40:21 2014 UTC,"DG is good.  The writing is stronger than in GotM, but the characters and their stories didn't grab me quite as much.  I loved reading about Tattersail, Anomander Rake, and Ganoes Paran.  I like reading about Duiker, Mappo, and Felisin.  I feel the Malazan world is bigger at this point in the story, having only read (most of) two books.  I'm enjoying what Erikson is doing, though I felt more engaged and entertained with the events surrounding Darujhistan.  There's only so much that can be said about the Whirlwind before it starts to seem repetitive."
Malazan,2ou20o,end_O_the_world_box,2,Wed Dec 10 21:38:21 2014 UTC,"""only so much that can be said about the whirlwind before it starts to seem repetitive."" Exactly. I love Coltaine and the whole march and the concept and all that, but whenever they start talking about sha'ik it just feels like it's taken way to long for the ____ to happen."
Malazan,2ou20o,end_O_the_world_box,1 point,Thu Dec 11 10:10:35 2014 UTC,Now I wonder what the ____ is...Read on I shall
Malazan,2ou20o,_zont_,1 point,Thu Dec 11 10:44:30 2014 UTC,How far are you into the book so far?
Malazan,2ou20o,Nightender,1 point,Thu Dec 11 10:58:31 2014 UTC,I'm just about to start the 2nd last chapter. Some grim shit has happened in the last few chapters which hit me. Made for an exciting and shocking read. I really appreciate when authors aren't afraid to kill off main characters like SE and GRRM.
Malazan,2ou20o,_zont_,1 point,Thu Dec 11 13:42:24 2014 UTC,People say that Duiker's plot is heart wrenching soooooo.... I'm afraid for duiker D:
Malazan,2ou20o,Nightender,1 point,Thu Dec 11 17:12:02 2014 UTC,"There's paced, there's drawn out, and there's waiting for ______ to happen.  I think book 4 will get running faster since it doesn't have all that wait time to get through."
Malazan,2ou20o,_zont_,1 point,Thu Dec 11 15:23:44 2014 UTC,"By this time I dont particularly care. I like fiddler but i don't like apsalar or Crokus too much, especially Crokus in gardens of the moon."
Malazan,2ou20o,Nightender,1 point,Thu Dec 11 17:13:40 2014 UTC,"I feel that. I feel like we haven't really learned too much about who Crokus and apsalar are. Sorry was a character, but we just haven't seen a lot of apsalar."
Malazan,2ou20o,choihanam,1 point,Sun Dec 14 06:57:20 2014 UTC,She's being built a lot more in this book. Crokus still seems like the underdeveloped teenage useless character to me at the moment.
Malazan,2ou20o,Nightender,1 point,Tue Dec 16 17:59:09 2014 UTC,"Yeah. I don't know where you are in the book, but in the second half, they talk a lot about how much he's grown, but I still have some trouble seeing him as a three-dimensional character."
Malazan,2ou20o,_zont_,1 point,Tue Dec 16 22:58:19 2014 UTC,"I would agree with you on the characters. I found tattersail, rake, gained and adjunct lorn storylines very engaging in GotM. In DG I found Felisin interesting straight away, Duiker took me a while to warm to, the others were decent but the mappo/icarium story was one I couldn't really get into. Now that I'm nearing the end of DG I almost want to reread all the Duiker story because it grew on me and tore my heart out."
Malazan,2ou20o,MrSilve,1 point,Wed Dec 10 21:54:03 2014 UTC,"The Duiker story is heart-tearing, even though I found it to be often the least engaging.  I found Coltaine to be a populist fusion of Sun Tzu and Sitting Bull.  Icarium and Mappo seem to have a connection to something larger going on.  That's about all I can peg given what I've read of the series so far."
Malazan,2ou20o,_zont_,1 point,Wed Dec 10 22:06:29 2014 UTC,I do enjoy hearing about the history of the world especially around the T'Lan Imass and the Jaghut. That stuff is fascinating
Malazan,2oscyi,Bayakoo,2,Tue Dec 9 20:07:41 2014 UTC,"Well I'm 9 books in and consider Midnight Tides to be my favorite. The plot, setting and characters are gripping and absolutely amazing. I wish I could get that book signed somehow."
Malazan,2oscyi,beyond1,2,Tue Dec 9 20:14:56 2014 UTC,"I'm halfway through MT right now, also on my first read. The prologue is the most interesting yet IMO, and while the book does start a little disorienting, once you get a feel for the characters it's really interesting. Also as /u/strawberrysundaeandt said it has some of the weirdest and funniest characters. Plus you'll enjoy Trull. Finally I'd say just keep in mind it takes place at around the same time as Gardens of the Moon. Enjoy! I'm not even done and I'm already praising it.."
Malazan,2oscyi,danaran,2,Tue Dec 9 21:24:10 2014 UTC,"TEHOOOOOOOOL! No seriously, if there's one character that kept me motivated while reading that book it's the absolute legend that is Tehol Beddict. His scenes and story lines are brilliant, and his interactions with his manservant Bugg are well written and entertaining. At first it might seem like a dull book, but keep in mind while you read the word 'ramifications'. Look at events portrayed in the book in terms of their potential long term consequences. MT is a very important book in the series."
Malazan,2oscyi,faustus19,1 point,Tue Dec 9 22:03:21 2014 UTC,I loved Midnight Tides eventually. It has some of the most entertaining characters in the series and memorable scenes. You also get to see Trull among his people.
Malazan,2oscyi,strawberrysundaeandt,1 point,Tue Dec 9 20:39:30 2014 UTC,"Midnight Tides was my least favorite book as well BUT by the time I was finished with it I saw how it was all going to come together and now it's one of my favorites. Enjoy the Tehol and Bugg mystery/banter and how Trull's story slowly unfolds. I felt the same way, ""ANOTHER new continent?!?!"" but Midnight Tides is all about what's going on on the other side of the world while the previous books are taking place. You'll have quite a few ""Ah Hah!"" moments as events from other books are aluded to in this one from other characters from a different perspective. Plus Trull and Tehol/Bugg and Brys, you'll grow to love, and Rulahd...well, just read on!   After this you get to Bonehunters, and all the major subplots across all previous five books and continents start  to slowly weave together for an epic Convergence in the Crippled God.  And I must say, I loved the Martian as well, loved all the hard science, and sense of wonder and explanation. But that's a heckuva switch back to Malazan lol"
Malazan,2oscyi,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Tue Dec 9 22:33:01 2014 UTC,"It's like starting out with GotM again because you're really thrown into the thick of an almost entirely 'new' world, but as with GotM the payoff is brilliant if you stick with it. You are about to meet some of the best characters in the whole series. And fear not, all the stuff that happens here ties back into the main arc soon enough!"
Malazan,2oscyi,SmiteStuffGirl,1 point,Tue Dec 9 22:38:18 2014 UTC,700 pages in. My favorite so far.
Malazan,2oscyi,theodorferdinand,1 point,Wed Dec 10 08:59:13 2014 UTC,A very popular sentiment is that Midnight tides is mediocre the first time through but rises to be considered a favourite upon a reread
Malazan,2oscyi,drae-,1 point,Wed Dec 10 23:14:44 2014 UTC,"I struggled through the first part because I don't give a fuuuuuuuuuck about the Edur, but I find the Letherii fascinating.  Of course that probably says something about me as an American, since Lether is dripping with analogues to the good ole US of A, even though Erikson claims it's not deliberate. Lether is where all the best characters are in that book, Tehol and Bugg, the Ceda, Shurq and Kettle, all great characters.   And even the Edur chapters start growing on me. Erikson's a master at creating characters that you go back and forth between hating and pitying, and he's in rare form here."

Malazan,2onr7v,YearOfTheMoose,2,Mon Dec 8 21:24:27 2014 UTC,"These are lovely, all of them. Despite his creative output, I wish he was somewhat more regular and frequent on lifeashuman."
Malazan,2ooaqp,Tulkaas,11,Mon Dec 8 19:34:47 2014 UTC,"iirc Tayscrenn was prepping Tattersail to become master of the deck, and when she ""died"" it kind of passed to Ganoes because of reasons and magic."
Malazan,2ooaqp,Notalec,6,Mon Dec 8 19:57:06 2014 UTC,"Just read that part in moi. This is correct. To elaborate it passes to ganoes likely because he was closest, spiritually; to tattersail at the time of her death. It's not confirmed that this is true, but it what is suspected in universe.  The characters (i believe dujek and wj) muse that they are lucky it passed to a malazan and more some ""rhivi goat herder""."
Malazan,2ooaqp,drae-,5,Mon Dec 8 21:39:36 2014 UTC,"I don't think it's explained exactly but it has something to do with his connection to Tattersail(and Nightchill) and when he was in the Finnest house(MoI) Raest told him that he had been chosen by the Azath.  I haven't read MoI in a while but I think it was something like occupying a throne.  The role of Master of the Deck was open and Paran was ""ascended"" enough to claim it.  Complete personal conjecture follows.  Technically Paran's aspect is Shadow.  He touched the Hounds blood after their fight with Anomander and then walked freely through Dragnipur.  He also did a half Soultaken/half Hound thing where he appeared to be a ghost Hound.  I believe this is how he started the path to ascension and had enough power to take on the role of Master of the Deck."
Malazan,2ooaqp,Capt91,1 point,Mon Dec 8 21:14:59 2014 UTC,I think he started his path to ascension with the naming of his sword. That seemed to be the main reason Oponn meddled when he was killed.
Malazan,2ooaqp,tripod-pop,3,Wed Jan 7 02:26:21 2015 UTC,"Funnily enough, in this serious all about non definitive answers and vagueness, it's really clear and specific about how Paran ended up as MotD. Tayschrenn was grooming Tattersail to be MotD (now granted, how exactly that works is beyond me, but sufficed to say Tayschrenn is pretty much leagues beyond almost anyone else in this series when it comes to magic knowledge, so I can believe he knows how this works) and when she died, that power sought out literally the closest person in the area, who just happened to be Paran."
Malazan,2ooaqp,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Mon Dec 8 21:12:28 2014 UTC,I don't remember Paran being near by.  It was Nightchill's body who was closest.
Malazan,2ooaqp,Capt91,3,Mon Dec 8 21:29:34 2014 UTC,"He was, they were both traveling across the plains to Darujhistan, not too far apart. And Nightchill was dead. If being dead didn't matter, it wouldn't have had to 'leave' Tattersail to begin with."
Malazan,2ooaqp,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Mon Dec 8 21:32:04 2014 UTC,"Well dead but preserved with a soul but yeah.  I guess they technically die to form Silverfox even though Nightchill maintains an identity and can communicate with Ganoes.  I have to reread, I had thought they were miles apart and Ganoes saw the explosion in the distance."
Malazan,2ooaqp,Capt91,2,Mon Dec 8 21:45:51 2014 UTC,"Miles apart is pretty close in the scheme of things (not that I remember if an actual distance was mentioned). Regardless, somewhere in MoI the question is brought up and that was the explanation given."
Malazan,2ooaqp,SageOfTheWise,2,Mon Dec 8 21:48:21 2014 UTC,"I don't recall the precise wording, but he did not necessarily mean physical proximity. Paran was very close to Tattersail emotionally and spiritually also."
Malazan,2ooaqp,Dannick,1 point,Tue Dec 9 15:14:44 2014 UTC,That makes much more sense.
Malazan,2ooaqp,Capt91,1 point,Tue Dec 9 15:23:30 2014 UTC,"many have said that Tays was grooming Tats for the role, and this is right, however, Paran himself is already an interesting fella, having died and come back to  life while still in Pale. i like to think that also has something to do with why the role passed to him."
Malazan,2ooaqp,cantlurkanymore,1 point,Mon Dec 8 21:49:32 2014 UTC,Ganoes paran's entire family was destined for tragedy and power as well. It was as if the culling of the royal lines was so they could reach there.
Malazan,2ol39d,finniganian,10,Sun Dec 7 21:52:20 2014 UTC,"Confusing isn't the best term for it. You can follow the plot along just fine. But unless I missed a whole lot, or you did some side research, then you still do not have a firm grasp of warrens, of what it means to be an Ascendant, etc. You might have a little bit more insight into the T'lan Imass but I don't think you know much about the Jaghut, yet. It's considered ""confusing"" because it drops you in the world without helping you out too much, but it's fun to watch the world unfold imo."
Malazan,2ol39d,ixosamaxi,2,Sun Dec 7 23:08:57 2014 UTC,"Aah, well fuck. So it's okay if you don't grasp how the world works in these first books?

Malazan,2ol39d,bluegender03,1 point,Mon Dec 8 07:43:43 2014 UTC,"Not everything is explained at first, and even in the end.  As for the characters though, every character has a purpose and almost all of them are brought back.  Even a certain unnamed guard from the second book makes a comeback in one of the later books."
Malazan,2ol39d,quadtard,1 point,Mon Dec 8 13:36:31 2014 UTC,It's totally okay. I remember reading the first battle on GotM and asking myself what the fuck is a fucking warren and how the hell are they doing whatever they're doing.

Malazan,2ol39d,Aiolus,3,Wed Dec 10 21:43:40 2014 UTC,"Not at all, I'd say, but the books are definitely more chaotic and confusing then most other books. So some people go in with the expectations they have from other books and are off put.   GotM is one of my favorites in his series but I can see how it could be seen as confusing as it fails to explain a ton of stuff.   I found the books lack of immediate explanation and plethora of characters refreshing compared to the standard three characters POVs and relatively quick explanations."
Malazan,2ol39d,Fennrarr,3,Sun Dec 7 22:39:05 2014 UTC,No. People just are dramatic. I think most of the people saying they need motivation to read the last books because the books are confusing but that they are incapable of reading a book that's a thousand pages long.
Malazan,2ol39d,dude21862004,2,Mon Dec 8 01:24:18 2014 UTC,I had very little trouble following along with the books. But on my second read through I found a lot of stuff that I didn't catch the first time around. I'd say this series is one of the few where multiple read throughs are rewarding.
Malazan,2ol39d,pfk505,1 point,Mon Dec 8 03:25:08 2014 UTC,"GOTM is the only ""difficult"" one, and that's only if you don't pay any attention to the maps, dramatis personae and glossary.  I found myself flipping to the back of the book a lot, but it was easy enough to follow.  I found it to be a pleasant read.  DG is where the basic structure of the series becomes apparent, and by the end of that book you'll be immersed enough in the world to follow without much issue.  Throughout the series I made frequent use of the maps and DP, but its easy enough to follow.  I think the warnings are a little overblown, but I would caution anyone to give the series at least until the end of DG before judging."
Malazan,2ol39d,strawberrysundaeandt,1 point,Sun Dec 14 06:32:36 2014 UTC,I needed help with the first book. Parts of Deadhouse Gates confused me and HoC. The other readers here are great for clarifying details.
Malazan,2ol39d,Phaeda,0,Sun Dec 7 22:08:15 2014 UTC,I think it's pretty easy to follow the action but some of the plot or setting won't make much/any sense until often several books later when the motivations of a character or a general setting piece of the Malazan world is explained. Which is why it's so great!
Malazan,2ol39d,LegSpinner,0,Mon Dec 8 09:39:03 2014 UTC,"I think it depends on your previous reading history. Prior to starting TMBOTF the only really complex book/series I'd read was Lord of the Rings. So I found GotM quite hard. But DG was relatively easy and then it just got better and better.   I actually found books 7, 8 & 9 a little harder because I had to read them in real time - I read the first six at one go and then had to wait for others to get released. So I would sort of lose track over the year between successive books and that would make it harder to catch up."
Malazan,2ol39d,MrSky74,0,Mon Dec 8 12:30:58 2014 UTC,For me books one and two were a bit of blur :/ book 3 is fantastic though
Malazan,2ojwih,danaran,4,Sun Dec 7 14:55:04 2014 UTC,"Random location for the tent, it's just on an island somewhere. The artist - Munug, he turns up again in a later book so may as well remind you of his name so you recognise it - did meet him in the tent in a cave in Genabackis, as did Quick Ben. He has no power beyond the confides of his tent, the reason why Rhulad turns up is just because of the sword though, it's not some kind of alternate realm of the dead or anything.  Letheras is just a separate continent, the Letherii Empire is just an offshoot of the (human) First Empire from the Seven Cities that got talked about a lot in DG and HoC, characters in MT, especially the Ceda, reference it fairly often."

Malazan,2ojwih,theodorferdinand,1 point,Sun Dec 7 23:12:39 2014 UTC,I imagine it's in a different realm - of some sorts. Like inside a warren? I don't think you could take a boat from e.g. Genabackis or Lether to it.
Malazan,2okehp,possumman,2,Sun Dec 7 18:10:11 2014 UTC,"It's been a while since I read the first 3 books, but I'll try my best (I'm actually planning a reread once I get all the ICE books)  1) Rake took over the city of Coral (where the climactic battle of MoI took place) and Moon's Spawn was cast away to die. The remaining Tiste Andii are with him.   2) IIRC Anaster (the main Child of the Dead Seed) died and Toc the Younger's soul is now in him.  3) Almost all the Bridgeburners died in battle and the few who survived were registered as dead and allowed to retire. They took over the old K'rul Temple in Darujhistan and made it into a bar.   4) The Kron T'lan Imass were redeemed from their burden of hundreds of thousands of years of war with the Jaghut by Itkovian (who died) and went with Silverfox to Assail. I can't say much about a link between any Imass and the House of Chains. It was formed by the Crippled God, though, who is indeed the same as the Fallen One.   Enjoy the rest of the books, and make sure to share your experiences with us as you read!"
Malazan,2okehp,wheeloficeandfire,3,Sun Dec 7 18:44:35 2014 UTC,"Toc Anaster now, as he goes by.  Also, it's important to note the creation of that special world the T'lan imass now reside in, the realm/warren thing where the thrones of the beasts are."
Malazan,2okehp,Foliagus,2,Mon Dec 8 06:09:17 2014 UTC,Also Toc the younger in his new body is the mortal sword of the two wolf gods on the throne of beasts
Malazan,2okehp,Fnarley,2,Mon Dec 8 13:56:49 2014 UTC,"Also of Note: the deceased bridge burners are interred in moons spawn before it is released. Iktovian takes Anaster's pain and suffering away (as shield anvils are wont to do). Because this suffering is what defines Anaster's identity, he is left as little more then a shell. Toc's soul is placed in his body. He is now ""Toc Anaster"". He becomes the Mortal Sword of Tog iirc. Correct! The only link I know of between Imass and The crippled God is House of Chains Spoiler"
Malazan,2okehp,drae-,1 point,Mon Dec 8 14:13:39 2014 UTC,"1) He was in it, but he wasn't hurt. He's still in charge of the remaining Tiste Andii. Since Moon's Spawn was destroyed, the Tiste Andii are currently staying in Coral.  2) He takes Anaster's pain. Since Anaster was a broken individual, pain was all he had. This leaves him a hollow shell. Toc's soul is placed in his body and he becomes the Mortal Sword of the Wolves.  3) They mostly died in the Siege of Coral. A handful of individuals survived and were retired by Dujek.  4)The big threat in the south you're probably remembering was the Pannion Domin, which was utterly destroyed in Book 3. It started on the south of Genebackis. The T'lan Imass are going to attempt to rescue some of their own on the continent of Assail. You're correct about the Crippled God in both respects. One point of clarification, he did create the House but it requires a blessing from the Master of the Deck of Dragons to become official."
Malazan,2okehp,majiinbuu,1 point,Sun Dec 7 18:37:53 2014 UTC,If you need a recap in the future you should check out http://www.tor.com/features/series/malazan-reread-of-the-fallen.  Breaks down each scene in all books and has discussion about each chapter.  It was very helpful when I took a break between some of the books.
Malazan,2ohed3,Bridgeburner_Fiddler,5,Sat Dec 6 19:39:20 2014 UTC,"It's been months since I finished the series, but I'm pretty sure Crokus in Toll the Hounds had thought it was several years since he had last been in Darujistan (back in Gardens of the Moon). I feel that a figure of 7 - 10 years over the course of the series seems justified (it did take months to years for the Bonehunters to travel to Lether by ship, for example), although I may of course be wrong. Erikson as we all know isn't big on strict timelines."
Malazan,2ohed3,RonnieRim,3,Sat Dec 6 22:16:32 2014 UTC,"If we use Harllo as indication, that would fit right in between those two dates I think."
Malazan,2ohed3,montaron87td,3,Sun Dec 7 00:12:47 2014 UTC,"Yeah, but Harlo's age is a known error in the series.  I forget the exact dates, but at one point in the book Gruntle thinks about the Siege of Capustan and it's literally impossible for that date to match up with Harlo's age."
Malazan,2ohed3,PhilosopherIshamael,1 point,Sun Dec 7 06:39:16 2014 UTC,"You can also use Hetan's (I think thats her name, the barghast woman Tool shacks up with) two girls she got from Kruppe."
Malazan,2ohed3,quadtard,3,Mon Dec 8 13:51:02 2014 UTC,"Taking a guess here, and because of the unreliability of the narrator the timeline is off.   TtH takes place around 6 years after MoI (the age of Harllo).  The time between GotM and MoI couldn't be more than a year.  TtH occurs roughly around the same time as DoD (Draconus being freed)  I'm sure someone must mention how much water the Bonehunters organise when leaving letheras, if I had to take a guess they probably take a month or so to get to Kolanse and then the final positioning maybe, a few weeks?   So overall, I'd say 7-8 years."
Malazan,2ofj5y,end_O_the_world_box,4,Sat Dec 6 03:51:57 2014 UTC,I like this one.

Malazan,2ofbs4,frankhorse,3,Sat Dec 6 02:32:25 2014 UTC,"I am on book 5, and yes its hard to adjust,  Fortunately the story carries you on.   If the series had started with him it would not be quite so jarring, but they started with the very talented Ralph Lister who breaths life into his narrations better than most.  One jarring lack of continuity is the producer didnt even bother to make sure all the names and places were pronounced the same from 3 to 4. Lister says Kruppah for Kruppe and Page says Kroop. Lister says Feleesin Page says Felicin. %90 of the characters names are pronounced differently from book 3 to book 4.  I thought I knew how to pronounce there names but now I am not sure lol"
Malazan,2ofbs4,chodan9,2,Sat Dec 6 04:30:52 2014 UTC,"I really have to disagree here-  While I fully agree that Ralph Lister set the bar for the series in terms if character narration, I feel that people are being hyper critical of Michael Page.  I too, was disappointed when I found out the narrator changed, and yes there was definitely a period of adjustment going from MOI to HOC. However, it wasn't THAT bad...at all really. On the contrary, Michael Page does an excellent job of telling these stories, and I wouldn't ever recommend someone avoid the audio books because of him. Is he as good as Ralph Lister? No - Not in my opinion. But, that doesn't mean he isn't good.  Yes - Many of the pronunciations change, along with characters voices (Lister's Kruppe will be particularly missed), but that is okay in my opinion. I'm sure the character voices in my head vary from the ones in yours - That is the beauty of books and imagination, they are open to interpretation, and thrive on individual experience and expression. I would liken it to when a new actor plays James Bond. Will someone be as memorable as Sean Connery? - Probably not, but maybe they will for some people. A new face (or voice) doesn't stop me from enjoying the characters or story. Plus - Even after MOI, there are MORE THAN ENOUGH new characters to carry you beyond the familiarity of characters in the first 3 novels.  So again - While Lister was magnificent, Page still does an excellent job of bringing the series to life IMO (especially in MT and TBH, where I feel Page really settled into his groove). I have listened to them all, and I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience with both narrators.  Will some listeners need time to adjust? - Yes. Reason to abandon the audio books entirely? - No."
Malazan,2ofbs4,TheScrumpster,2,Fri Dec 12 04:47:55 2014 UTC,"I just realized that I was listening to a friend's old recording with James Haag who is awful.

They all sound the same. He also has no consistency. Karsa for instance is completely different in HoC after Book 1. And a number of other characters voices change from passage to passage. Lister never had that and he had way more inflection. Page seems more suites to narrating a TV docu drama, especially not a fantasy series with this myriad of characters and cultures."

Malazan,2oemf4,trolo-joe,5,Fri Dec 5 22:24:22 2014 UTC,"so I know that this sub is frequently inundated with the ""I just finished [BOOK] and here are my thoughts!"" but really - I want some other fans to share excitement with me because none of my other friends are reading Malazan right now.   Seriously don't worry about that. We love them. There cannot be too much.   Felisin/Sha'ik - I don't know what to think of her, except that I hate her. But is she really Sha'ik now? Heboric made the comment that she is ""Sha'ik remade"", not reborn, so it seems that Felisin is retaining her will/memories and serving as the vessel of Sha'ik's power...but isn't really ""possessed."" Not like Sorry/Apsalar.   Interesting thoughts. Can't really say much more now.   I freaking hate the D'ivers and I am so glad Gryllen finally died. I still don't quite understand the relationship between the D'ivers and the Soletaken...but it seems like the Soletaken are the good guys? Or, at the very least, the less-bad guys?   Nah not really that. Soletaken transform into an animal, while D'ivers transform into a group of animals. Both can take a tole on your sanity, but the latter more so. D'ivers are more likely to be crazy and want to kill you in stuff, but its not really a good/evil thing.   I still don't understand why Mappo just doesn't tell Icarium the truth, but I'm hoping we get to see more of their story in the next book.   Even if you told him, how long would he remember? Icarium actually is told the truth, or most of it by the end of the book, but after the climax he's forgotten it all.    in the Epilogue of DG, we see an unnamed pregnant woman about to take a potion to abort her child, which she thinks has no soul. But another woman stops her as a massive swarm of crows come her way. Is Coltaine really gone? Or are the crows going to deposit his soul into that soulless babe?   That is certainly the implication, yes. Just like Sormo E'nath. The crazy thing is the greatest Wickan mage ever only took 11 crows to carry his soul.   Gesler/Stormy/Truth - so...are they Ascendants now? I really don't get how Ascendancy works yet. I don't even quite know what it means, except that it's a big deal. I know they tore through multiple warrens and were bathed in that fire (maybe it was from that undead dragon? I don't know it was left unclear), and they came out...different. I think it was Nil and Nether who claimed that they were on the fringe of Ascendancy, but there was nothing conclusive about it.    They're on the fringe still. The dragon dragged them through the fire warrens accidentally, but it was the warrens themselves that did it.   I would think that any competent ruler would destroy anyone who sought to actively assassinate them, but Laseen just let's him walk out. Wtf? Then he is charged with taking care of 1500 children who were ""saved"" by Apt? So, what, the Warren of Shadow is a foster home for lost kids now?   Two questions, basically one answer. Laseen has her uses for Kalam. And Shadowthrone has his uses for the children. You'll just have to see.   The Pannion Seer - another book where I read cryptic things about a supposed enemy. Am I ever going to see him? And jeez, is there a single part of the Empire that is living in peace?   Oh, you'll learn all about him.   The Bhok'arala - so is Moby a demonic soletaken, taking the form of a bhok'arala?    I believe something like that? It's honestly been a long time since I've read it. Sounds about right though.   Is Hood the overall ""god"" of the Malazan universe? I see references to him all of the time - his name is used in curses (frequently) and people seem to fear him because of his relationship with death.   No, there is no overall god. He's just the god of death, which just happens to make him more relevant than most a lot of the time.   Am I ever going to see Tattersail again? She was reborn in Gardens, right? And Paran? Seriously, it's nothing huge, but I loved those characters. Seriously. Paran summoning Oponn in the realm of Dragnipur and ""releasing"" the hounds...Tattersail's general awesomeness. Am I alone in that?   Sooner than you think.   Oh, and Mallick Rel. Dude. Don't know about anyone else, but I hope he ends up dismembered in a steaming pile of Fener's excrement, while the Hounds of Shadow piss on his corpse. Seriously. Bastard.   'Fuck Mallick Rel' is basically this subreddit's catchphrase. Well that and one spoilery other thing I can't mention yet."
Malazan,2oemf4,SageOfTheWise,2,Fri Dec 5 22:56:47 2014 UTC,"Thanks for this response! It's certainly a tad more gratifying than ""RAFO"" (even though I get it - reading is part of the fun).  I'm just glad to see that there's a fandom here that likes to see new readers getting into the series.  That's so fantastic.  Seriously.  If it had not been for this sub, I probably would have put GotM down a long time ago.  Good points about Icarium...I had thought that his memory was connected to his rage, and it was only when he went all Hulk on everyone that he lost his memory.  I did not think it extended beyond that.  With Laseen/Shadowthrone - that's part of what I love about this series.  It's so complex and it has layers upon layers of story.  It's great, and definitely makes me want to continue reading.  Hopefully I'll get my hands on MoI sooner rather than later (B&N was out of it) and I can check back in.  Thanks again for your reply!"

Oh, don't worry. Folks who are fans of this series seem to get sustenance from reading others' reactions. Keep 'em coming :)  The others that can get answered are mostly taken care of, but I figure I'll toss this out, too.  4) I took it as an assumption that he would be reborn without expecting it to be revisited at a later date.

Malazan,2oemf4,TriscuitCracker,3,Sat Dec 6 02:10:40 2014 UTC,"You have this down pretty well, the series elaborates in a later book.  The other guy explained it pretty succinctly. They're just two different kinds of shapeshifters, although it's usually implied that D'ivers are more powerful.  RAFO Again, RAFO. However, I will say that Laseen let him attempt to assassinate her so she could explain herself to him. There's a more accurate description in the next book. Also consider how much difficulty Topper and the Claw had with attempting to take him out.  Next book Next book   Hope I helped."

Malazan,2ocyyq,Blubberfish819,4,Fri Dec 5 13:00:43 2014 UTC,The most commonly used saying when talking about Erikson is RAFO: Read And Find Out. There are no easy answers in this series. Heck I have read everything a number of times and I still don't fully grasp everything. Some of the questions you have may not be answered for 2 or 3 books!   But it is so flipping worth the wait for the journey you take to get there!
Malazan,2ocyyq,TisteSimeon,3,Fri Dec 5 17:04:25 2014 UTC,"Hiya, I'm glad you're enjoying the series. It's been a while since I've read the first few books, but hopefully these answers help some  1) My memory is a little hazy here but I think it's partly due to their nature (they like to mess with chance, randomness, etc.) and I also believe it was an attempt to influence the Master of the Deck. And it definitely seemed to backfire for them; maybe it was too big a risk for not a big enough reward, even gods make mistakes sometimes.  2) Good question. Keep reading and more will (maybe) be revealed :)  3) This is mostly speculation, but there are a few reasons that help explain this I think. Firstly, Malazan troops tend to be very disciplined. They've had a pretty successful history of following the orders of very capable commanders (Dassem Ultor, Greymane, Whiskeyjack, Dujek, Toc the Elder, etc.), and the 'free spirits' tend to end up dead, promoted or in the Marines/Sappers rather than as the rank and file infantry types. Secondly, the man in charge of the opposing army, Korbolo Dom, is an ex-Malazan general and they probably assumed his offer of surrender was an honourable one. Finally, they were quite heavily outnumbered and were likely in no position to really resist as a unit.   4) Would this be the Obelisk card in the deck? As I recall it's used to generally signify 'time'. I won't say whether you're right or wrong regarding your speculation, but I like your train of thought and it's probably something worth keeping in the back of your mind as you keep reading  Hopefully that helps, and sorry if some of the answers are a little vague"
Malazan,2ocyyq,Nimander23,2,Fri Dec 5 13:27:43 2014 UTC,The Obelisk also represents Burn.
Malazan,2ocyyq,kvothe,1 point,Fri Dec 5 16:46:07 2014 UTC,"Ah cool thanks, also love me some kvothe.  Hopefully final book comes out next year.  :)"
Malazan,2ocyyq,MoranthMunitions,1 point,Fri Dec 5 17:27:17 2014 UTC,"Actually, /u/kvothe is only kind of right about Obelisk. It represents Burn in MoI and lots of the other books, but it doesn't necessarily all the time. It represents ""Past present future, the here, the now, the then, the when—"" according to Iskaral Pust, which lines up with everything else in the series about it. It's also called the ""dolmen of time"" in MoI by Spindle.  It generally represents an ""unaligned"" character (mostly an ascendant, like all the other cards do), it's pretty much a way for someone to have a position in the Deck without having to be a part of a House. You were right that Icarium - who is a Jhag not Jaghut btw - was represented by Obelisk in DG. K'rul mentions his own aspect being Obelisk in GotM too. Tool claims that Toc was ""touched by stone"" in MoI too, referring to Obelisk.  Also from the Book 5 quote of GotM:   Beyond these thin hide walls a child sits, before her on worn silk a Deck is arrayed. She cannot yet speak and the scenes before her she's never before seen in this life. The child gazes upon a lone card named Obelisk, the stone grey she can feel its roughness in her mind. Obelisk stands buried in a grassy knoll like a knuckle protruded from the earth, past and future. This child's eyes are wide with terror, for cracks have appeared in the stone of stones and she knows the shattering is begun.   Anyway, that's pretty much all of Obelisk as per the first few books."
Malazan,2odukv,scrndude,5,Fri Dec 5 18:21:20 2014 UTC,"Tool doesn't turn into a fleshy Barghast, he simply reverts to a mortal Imass, which is a very similar race to the Barghast both in ancestry and appearance.    I'm not quite sure what you are asking. Silverfox's coming and the return of the Wolves to their warren allows the T'lan Imass to escape the ritual, but rather than going to the warren like the rest of the T'lan present at the event, Tool remains in the current world.  Dropping his sword is symbolic of him renouncing his place as First Sword of the Imass, something that surprises and probably disappoints Silverfox. He's not done as a warrior (he and Kilava say that they are going off to make a new sword) but he is done with his own race (for now)."
Malazan,2odukv,SageOfTheWise,2,Fri Dec 5 19:13:47 2014 UTC,"Okay, thanks! So are all the T'lan Imass now reverted to Imass? I thought that they were now unburdened, but Tool is the only one I remember being described as having muscles and looking like a Barghast. The other T'lan up to that point are just described as looking less like zombies after Itkovian does his thing."
Malazan,2odukv,SageOfTheWise,3,Fri Dec 5 19:20:34 2014 UTC,"Itkovian provides a path to redemption, he does not actually cause an ""actual"" change in their state. Once he is done, they are still T'lan, still bound by the ritual, and still lack gods or an afterlife.  That is the goal of Kruppe/QB and co. to varying degrees.  The Mhybe provided a new realm for them, and the Beasts returned to their Throne.  Silverfox can release them from the Ritual, which is what they actually wanted.  Also, just as a note, ""all the T'lan Imass"" are not reverted, there are a couple of other factors. First, only the ones that Silverfox can reach are able to be released, and there are many more out there which she will have to find.  Further, most of them chose death once freed, they've been suffering for thousands of years and few care to stick around any longer. (Edit: I think this might actually be wrong, I think that they all put it off to follow Silverfox)  Finally, there was a reason that they chose to become undead in the first place, and even though they are done with the progrom against the Jaghut (for the most part...) it does provide certain advantages which some of them still want to use. This is why you only see Tool sticking around as a mortal. Thus, at least a few end up temporarily refusing release until they finish certain tasks. But most of this is only relevant much later, at which point it will be explained."

Malazan,2oafnf,cocoisland,1 point,Fri Dec 5 11:52:45 2014 UTC,"A little complicated, yeah. It's basically creating an image on Mylar in black, placing it on a photosensitive polymer plate, using a vacuum chamber and UV lamp to shoot the plate, then washing off said plate to get an etched pattern you can use to print multiple pics with. Lots more steps in there, but basically you ink the plate and run it through a press mechanism with wet paper, giving you a series of (assuming you did it right) almost identical prints"

Malazan,2oblwr,Math2S,4,Fri Dec 5 01:58:42 2014 UTC,"Honestly I would read all the series on their own. They just slow each other down. And you're really going to have your hands full with keeping everything in the main series straight without adding more on. Just my opinion though. (Assuming this is your first read. If not, hey go nuts).  If you do want to mix them together, nothing on this list immediately strikes me as an issue (besides my prior warning). Publishing order is pretty safe. Your placement of Crimson Guard is fine, it should definitely be after Reaper's Gale.  I guess if I had any other suggestions (besides don't do it :P), I'd take the books between Dust of Dreams and The Crippled God and either read move them before Dust of Dreams. DoD and TCG are really one large book. You aren't going to want to jam other books into the middle of that. I believe Blood Follows takes place before Memories of Ice. Might be interesting to read first, as a lead in to one of the MoI plots. But it also works fine as it is, as a sot of origin story after the fact. And lastly, I'd probably just leave Forge of Darkness until last. Everything you're going to be reading is roughly in a time line order (give a few years here or there), but then that one is like hundreds of thousands of years before everything else. It's starting its own separate thing and best to keep it separate."
Malazan,2oblwr,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Fri Dec 5 02:26:13 2014 UTC,"I agree with all that, though I think it doesn't really matter if RotCG before RG as RotCG/RG  The only thing I'd add though is I wouldn't read the novellas interspersed like that, just read them separately at the end or after MoI. They have no plotlines that fit in with the others, but are generally a continuation of each other so they're better off read together."

There's a lot of discussion as to what the order of Esslemont / Erikson books are, but the one on the sidebar is good. I haven't read it but I know that the Crimson Guard feature heavily in Esslemonts books.  I really don't remember Skinner being mentioned as the King in Chains, sorry I can't help. As far as I'm aware, once Eres'al gets outed as being T'amber, she doesn't come back.  I think the guy with the lamp is the Tiste Edur that Hannan Mosag sends to find Brys (who Hannan Mosag also kills). After he retrieves Brys he says something along the lines of 'I'm going to try find that house again' and just sorta start wandering.  Edgewalker is an Elder God, I think he's younger than the other Elders, read FoD if you're interested in all the Elder God stuff, they're all in it.    As to the rest, I seriously have no idea.

Malazan,2o8noh,unseenarchives,3,Thu Dec 4 13:22:29 2014 UTC,"Yep, pretty much. From Chapter 23 of BH:   And the scene seemed to somehow shift, a new illumination – it was gathered about a single body, too distant to make out details— T’amber,’ Grub said. ‘Only you and me can see. So watch, Lostara. Watch.’ The golden glow was coalescing, rising up from the corpse. A faint wind flowed past Lostara and Grub, familiar now, heady with the scent of savannah grasses, warm and dry. ‘She stayed with us a long time,’ Grub whispered. ‘She used T’amber. A lot. There wasn’t any choice. The Fourteenth, it’s going to war, and we’re going with it. We have to.’ A figure now stood at a half-crouch over the body. Furred, tall, and female. No clothing, no ornamentation of any kind. ... ‘Who – what is she?’ ‘The Eres’al. Lostara, you must never tell the Adjunct. Never.’   I think it was more T'amber died and the Eres'al left, but it's to the same effect."
Malazan,2o8noh,MoranthMunitions,2,Thu Dec 4 15:01:10 2014 UTC,"Yeah, she leaves T'amber and then I forgot how she gets interested in Bottle but she definitely is there to help when the Tiste Edur attack the Bonehunter fleet with sorcery. But she's only mentioned a few more times in passing after that."
Malazan,2o8noh,MoranthMunitions,2,Thu Dec 4 16:47:31 2014 UTC,"The Tiste Edur attack on their fleet was before they went to Malaz Island, when they were still sailing around the Seven Cities where the Edur fleet had been taking challengers for Rhulad. I'm not sure why she had a thing for Bottle either, I guess his magic type must have been the more earthy type that'd trace back the Eres more easily."

I still haven't got around to Assail but I've read everything else and don't recall anything like that. Also Skinner is definitely the King in Chains, but Esselmont does deal with that in a fair bit of detail."
Malazan,2o8noh,Ezzelino,3,Thu Dec 4 15:05:01 2014 UTC,"Ehh, its just a theory. Edge walker is just really different from the other elders. Have you read FoD?"

Malazan,2o8noh,MoranthMunitions,1 point,Fri May 29 16:08:53 2015 UTC,Thanks! I've seen the sidebar order mentioned a few times but all I see on the sidebar is the groupings of the different series.  Is that what you're talking about?
Malazan,2o8noh,Ezzelino,2,Thu Dec 4 16:51:04 2014 UTC,"Unless they're just thinking of reading the books as an individual series, the old sidebar's order was:  FoD = Forge of Darkness FoL = Fall of Light (forthcoming) GotM = Gardens of the Moon DG = Deadhouse Gates MoI = Memories of Ice HoC = House of Chains MT = Midnight Tides * NoK = Night of Knives BH = The Bonehunters RotCG = Return of the Crimson Guard RG = Reaper's Gale SW = Stonewielder TtH = Toll the Hounds OST = Orb, Sceptre, Throne DoD = Dust of Dreams tCG = The Crippled God BaB = Blood and Bone ASL = Assail  Which is pretty much what the Tor link says, except those are slightly out of order. IIRC bar FoD/FoL it publishing order on the sidebar, it's supposed to be so that you don't spoilers like Mallick being the emperor or about Toc. Otherwise it's all roughly chronological, which is why FoD is at the top. There's a lot of time overlap between different books, especially all the last three Erikson books and 3 or 4 of the ICE ones, so arguing which was first is kind of stupid and publishing order works best as they're written to not contain spoilers beyond the scope of what was already released. Though I guess that's obvious.  I still reckon they should have left a link to it at the bottom of the sidebar, this gets asked about once every month or two."
Malazan,2o8noh,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Thu Dec 4 23:50:57 2014 UTC,I guess it makes sense to read them in published order because like you said the authors aren't spoiling anything. But I'll save this list for when I do a reread.  Thanks.
Malazan,2o8noh,Notalec,2,Fri Dec 5 03:12:30 2014 UTC,"Hmm, maybe on the Tor site?"
Malazan,2o8noh,PhilosopherIshamael,4,Fri Dec 5 04:00:04 2014 UTC,"Yes you should read them, maybe mixed in the main series for a reread. I have to say, I'm on my first reread (on TtH) and it's just as good as the first time I read the series especially now that I can pick out all the little nuances and foreshadowing and connections between continents and characters. Esselmonts books fill in backstory and little gaps of the main series. Throughout the books, You catch up with the Crimson Guard, the Stormriders, Greymane, the Segulah, Daseem, what's going on behind the scenes in the Malazan Empire after Tavore leaves, what's happening on Jakaru, the continent that Kallor destroyed centuries ago and the most recent book is about what's going on with Silverfox, etc. If your not going to do a reread right away, then read all of esselmonts in a row, they are much faster reads than Erikson. And bear in mind, Esselmont's books are good, but he's not on Erikson's level. Totally worth reading for more backstory and your Malazan fix.   Have you read Forge of Darkness?  Others have answered your questions, but glad you liked the series! Edgewalker is one of the most intriguing remaining mysteries in Malazan. Any other impressions? Favorite parts in The Crippled God, or other books?"
Malazan,2o8noh,Notalec,4,Thu Dec 4 08:32:59 2014 UTC,"I've read enough epic fantasy that by the second book I could tell he was setting up a slow burn to a huge climax I just didn't realize how huge of a climax.   To be honest before about the halfway point in tCG I wasn't planning to do a reread.  I thought it was a monster undertaking and epic almost beyond belief but the books just had too much slow buildup and then a big climax with not enough in between.  Then, in tCG, when Kaminsod first said something to the effect of this whole thing was a book of his fallen and it hit me what the whole series was about and building towards I was just like ""Whoa.""  I even set the book down and thought about it for a while. Now I'm definitely doing a reread at some point. :)  Favorite parts, just to name a few:   When Anomander killed Hood. At first it seems like Anomander betrays Hood, because Hood starts to say he changed his mind then chop.  Then it's like this was the plan all along. And when Hood's army show's up behind him.  Aw yeah!  I think I even said that out loud. When Karsa, who is one of my favorites, just says, ""I'm only going to kill you once.""  Enough said. The few times when we read from the rank and file's viewpoint how they regarded the Bridgeburners.  Like when Kalam was sailing back to assassinate Laseen, he basically pulled rank on that Lieutenant by virtue of being a Bridgeburner. Or when Fiddler does the Drum in Lether and the regular sapper is just in awe of what he just witnessed. I've read Glen Cook's Black Company books and you never got to see an outside perspective on the squad like you do here. I really like those moment's. The Jaghut are standing at their memorial and the little dog pisses on Hood's leg and while the rest are laughing about it he just thinks to himself, ""This is why the Jaghut lived alone."" I could not stop laughing. A while back I was reading a thread on /r/fantasy about people's favorite made up species and someone said Jaghut. I didn't want to spoil anything so I stopped reading his entry but I couldn't understand how anyone could like them. Now I get it. And my favorite part in the whole series was Beak.  When it was so painful for him but he wouldn't let go because he had to save the only people he ever loved and he ends with just My friends. I let out a little sob.  Then a few pages later when he meets his brother through Hood's gate and he asks him if he can play with him.  I'm not ashamed to say I sobbed like a little girl."
Malazan,2o8noh,MoranthMunitions,2,Thu Dec 4 22:06:30 2014 UTC,"RotCG is pretty heavily focused on the Guard. Skinner as the King in Chains will be covered, yes. I think the Eres'al lost Bottle in the glass desert? I don't really recall. Mostly she just stops being relevant. I believe it was the Edur you're thinking of. Edgewalker is still a vague kind of guy at this point, he is connected with shadow, and as far as we know only has influence within that realm. He does seem to have a lot of it, though. That's Crokus/Cutter. The scene starts with a ditch and some turnips that you might remember from way back at the beginning of book 1, so they're standing in the location Apsalar was first possessed, and that's Crokus heading off to meet her in that same shitty fishing village. Dassem's story gets resolved in Esselmont's books. Well, /u/PhilosopherIshamael already spoiled this one. It's mentioned once or twice that Laseen is dead, but her replacement isn't actually revealed until Esselmont's books iirc."
Malazan,2o8noh,SerBronnofBlackwater,2,Thu Dec 4 13:51:29 2014 UTC,"Um I guess it was a spoiler to mention it, but I am fairly certain that it is mentioned in the books that Laseen has been killed.  They just don't make a big deal out of it."
Malazan,2o8noh,PhilosopherIshamael,2,Thu Dec 4 16:05:04 2014 UTC,"Yeah, they mention Laseen, but I'm pretty sure they don't mention who takes the throne. The only obvious choices are either Mallick or Korbolo, so it's not a big spoiler."

Malazan,2o5dq6,titanemesis,7,Wed Dec 3 12:33:35 2014 UTC,"Why Darujhistan? Hood had to be brought forth into the mortal plane. He was not already in the world. So why Darujhistan? Without veering into spoilers from Esselmont's books: the city is particularly attuned to Hood's demense. You could think of it as the walls between the worlds being thin there. This is also why Rake himself probably had to be killed there.  Why not invite Hood over to hang out and casually kill him then? Hood tenuously agreed. Hood had a change of heart at the last second. Remember, when he asks Rake to wait / reconsider? Rake couldn't afford to rely on Hood to do this (after all, no rule is quick to relinquish his rule, however altruistic). He made sure he was there to move him along into Dragnipur.  Why force Dassem to 'kill' him? Two reasons: one that's reasonably backed up with evidence, and one that's pure conjecture.   Reason one: to help Dassem ascend. Traveller was being manipulated by Shadowthrone and Cotillion (and Dessembrae, to a lesser extent). He also carried Grief. Why are these facts relevant? In order for Traveller to fully adopt the mantle of Lord of Tragedy, and be freed of external manipulation, he needed to have his vengeance changed to grief. Consider that he dedicated a huge amount of his life hunting down Hood in the pursuit of Vengeance. Rake robbing him of that vengeance (and permanently putting it out of his reach) reduced his bitter pursuit to an act of futility, but also freed him from the chains of that vengeance. He fully ascended. So while it was a bitter gift, it was still a gift from Rake. Reason two: he couldn't commit obvious suicide. Rake committed suicide when he let Traveller defeat him. And make no mistake: he contrived his defeat in a manner that let him be killed by his own sword. One of the greatest living swordsmen in that universe didn't fuck up a parry. In essence: Rake couldn't kill himself in an obvious way because it would have done a number of undesirable things. One: it may have alerted his foes that Rake was up to some shit. Two: if he killed himself without someone powerful (and scary) around to protect it, it could have fallen into the wrong hands. Having a grief-ridden, unstable Traveller near the sword was just enough of a deterrent to buy time until the sword could be safeguarded.   As for the convergence etc: that's answered by the other folks in this thread. Power attracts power. Dragnipur (the weapon of the Son of Darkness) suddenly being unclaimed naturally drew all the Tiste Liosan asshole dogs."

Malazan,2o5dq6,titanemesis,2,Wed Dec 3 21:42:24 2014 UTC,"Well, on a trivial level: better Dassem than some other asshat, right? He was a known quantity, and had some loyalty to Kellanved since he was formerly part of the old guard.  When you're playing a game that large, it's better to have players that you understand / control (however tenuously), rather than completely chaotic elements.  But no, their motivations for helping him ascend aren't overtly addressed in the ICE books as far as I recall."
Malazan,2o5dq6,PromisedPrince694,3,Wed Dec 3 21:51:37 2014 UTC,"I did think that it was because they knew ""him"" but I also thought that they'd have a lot more Dassem stuff in the ICE novels. Thanks for the info."

It's just that the motivations for them ushering in his embodiment of Dessembrae isn't really explored, beyond what you see in the Erikson books."

Malazan,2o5dq6,drae-,7,Thu Jan 1 04:37:46 2015 UTC,"Well I'ave only re-read Toll once, but I'll take a shot.    So it's all about Dragnipur.    Rake needs to enter Dragnipur for two reasons, to free Draconus, and to release the portal so the Andii can return to Kurald Galian.    In order to do this Rake needs to enter the sword, so he has to die by the sword. Convergences being what they are, power draws power; with hood unveiling his warren and Rake in town, this is a huge lodestone of power attracting all the ascendants in the area. Once they figure out whats going on they all want to get their hands on Dragnipur when Rake dies.  I think Rake orchestrates Traveler killing him so there's a chance Dragnipur falls into the ""right"" hands. Also this event is a pivot for Traveler, as he can no longer fulfill his vow of vengeance against hood. It's as much about Traveler being ""pushed"" to become Dessembre as it is about Rakes Plan to enter Dragnipur.  Hood gets Rake to kill him because Hood no longer wants to be the King of Death, and because Hood also needs to be in the sword to cut the deal with Draconus iirc.  I feel like I am forgetting something, but that is my best recollection."
Malazan,2o5dq6,drae-,2,Wed Dec 3 13:32:36 2014 UTC,"Yes, but I don't think that explains why it had to happend then, there and how  Anomander could've sat his ass in his palace and asked Brood to come to him (Remember he was nearby)  Hood comes to Rake, gets killed  Rake gives Dragnipur to Brood and ask him to kill him and the destroy the sword  It guarantees that the sword falls in the correct hands with much less effort and much less left to chance"
Malazan,2o5dq6,AllWrong74,2,Wed Dec 3 13:40:39 2014 UTC,"That assumes Rake and Hood can communicate, which the scene in Darujistan seemed to contradict.     Hood is there anyway, Rake goes to him. I don't believe rake can just like text hood and be like ""hey wanna come over?"" but I could be wrong."
Malazan,2o5dq6,AllWrong74,2,Wed Dec 3 13:57:06 2014 UTC,Obviously Hood knew he would meet Rake there and die by his sword.  Which indicates that they've most likely talked before (maybe through Shadowthrone)
Malazan,2o5dq6,MoranthMunitions,3,Wed Dec 3 14:19:13 2014 UTC,"Rake was doing Dassem 2 favors.  Dassem swore to kill Hood.  Rake beats him to it, so now Dassem can't get his vengeance on.  By allowing Dassem to kill him Rake has done 2 things:   He's allowed Dassem to kill the man that robbed him of his vengeance. He's pushed him into becoming Dessembre.  Without Rake and/or Hood, you have two calming powers missing from the ranks of the gods and ascendants.  By pushing Dassem into the role of Dessembre, he is making sure there's at least 1 person there to take their place.   At least, that's how I read it."
Malazan,2o5dq6,MoranthMunitions,2,Wed Dec 3 15:04:21 2014 UTC,"The role of Dessembre might be something i've missed from not reading the novels, but what you are describing isn't that essentially Draconus?  Regarding killing the man who robbed him out of his vengeance doesn't quite add up either. I mean Dassem asked him to step aside and told him he didn't want to fight knowing Hood was already dead  Whatever Dassem wanted to do it wasn't getting vengeance on Rake"
Malazan,2o5dq6,ReverendBizarre,3,Wed Dec 3 15:55:41 2014 UTC,"I phrased it wrong.  I meant it to say that there was 1 more person (because yes, that is Draconus)."
Malazan,2o5dq6,Gaebryal,2,Wed Dec 3 15:59:05 2014 UTC,"(maybe through Shadowthrone)   I figured through Paran, as he's the one Hood cuts the deal with in HoC."

Malazan,2o57yy,Rnet1234,2,Wed Dec 3 12:49:58 2014 UTC,My take on this was that they're just so used to weird things going on that they've just learned to not ask questions to avoid going crazy.

So I kind of figured the Chain of Dogs ghosts were coming from the Raraku warren more than Hood's gate. Again, likely mistaken but that's what I'm thinking right now. Also, that twist at the end of book 1 in HoC, when you realize you've been reading Toblakai's backstory... Wow."

The Return of the Crimson Guard was a bit boring though, which is sad. But it is also important to the main series, so it probably should be read anyway. And I hear that the latest of ICE's books becomes very good."

Malazan,2o2x06,Bilbato,1 point,Wed Dec 3 00:17:15 2014 UTC,"I think part of the purpose in his writing of the Snake is to show how we never think of all the potential consequences of our actions. It all starts with just wanting to do that little bit more farming, and that little bit more logging. Suddenly we have soil erosion and the farms slowly become infertile as all that soil gets washed away. So they go to chopping down even more trees as at least that soil is decent, for a few years. And then the soil erosion continues, and so the cycle continues. Enter the FA and they see a need to stop the injustices perpetrated against nature that has no means to defend itself, so they become that voice of justice. They begin to cleanse Kolanse, and from the cleansing emerges the Snake.  For me, this is a very big theme that he repeatedly explores throughout the entirety of MBotF.

Malazan,2o134n,MoranthMunitions,4,Thu Dec 4 01:14:06 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately the Seven Cities continent is probably the most confusing one for the maps, I remember having issues using the DG maps too. Someone posted a world map thread.  Here's the full Seven Cities map, while this is the Chain of Dogs' part one and part 2. They're headed from Hissar to Aren (right-centre to centre-bottom in the full map, horizontal then vertical).  They're the same as in the start of the book, but it can help to look at the full size images imo. There's some coloured versions floating about online, but they pretty much just use green for the landmasses, which doesn't really portray that the vast majority of the place is desert very well.  Crokus, Fiddler, Apsalar and Kalam start in Kansu further NW along the same coast (first major city the go to is Ehrlitan), planning to head out along the Seeker's Deep (bottom right) to get to Quon Tali. Well first they:   [Reached] the Imperial port of Karakarang from Genabackis, arriving on a Moranth Blue trader having paid passage as crew. The overland journey from Karakarang across the Talgai Mountains and down to Rutu Jelba had been on the Tano pilgrim route – a common enough journey. And the week in Rutu Jelba had been spent inconspicuously lying low, with only Kalam making nightly excursions to the wharf district, seeking passage across the Otataral Sea to the mainland.   Felisin, Baudin and Heboric are on the Otataral Island, which is across the straight from Hissar. I believe they are on the other side of the hills displayed on the map, but am not sure.  Pretty much at the start of the book everyone is on the right side of the map, and they all travel left.  Edit: And here's the maps again, for anyone they aren't displaying at full size."

Malazan,2o05t2,PMOD6,21,Tue Dec 2 02:18:23 2014 UTC,"I work at a bookstore and I'm always trying to get people to read it. I usually say, ""Don't be intimidated by its length, it's the kind of series you'll read until 5 in the morning because you don't want to stop."" I say it's more complicated than Game of Thrones, has a cast of hundreds, amazing world-building, a complex magic system, well-developed characters and I'm not ashamed to admit I cheered and cried several times while reading the series. I also don't sugarcoat it, I say it can be intimidating, has lots of philosophy, it is not a quick, easy read, and you have to pay attention. I always point out the maps and the glossary, I've had many people tell me they got to the end of GoTM and been annoyed to discover the helpful glossary. I also say it's a finished series because that's a nice thing, I've had many people turn down reading Game of Thrones or Way of Kings or Name of the Wind because they don't want to wait for books to come out. I also describe a few of the crazier concepts, like Dragnipur, or D'ivers or warrens. I say the author is an archeologist and anthropologist so his world building is amazing. I also ask what they've read before, but most of all, have enthusiasm. You can sell anything if you have enough enthusiasm and they see the love I have for the series and they want that feeling too, that feeling you get when you're reading a series where you know you've got a new world to play in for life.   Or you can say this and they may get confused:   These are but a few of the many stories that grace the Malazan Book of the Fallen...  It's about a millennium old dark elf with a magic sword that transports you into a place where Anomander Rake Spoiler It's about a barbarian Karsa Spoiler It's about a man who is so tragic he Daseem Spoiler It's about a half-Orc looking rage monster and his buddy. It's about a really fast wizard and a violin player and their wacky army buddies. It's about a jolly conversationalist fat man, a spider crazed shadow priest, and three unique brothers, Tehol Spoiler It's about an elf with a spear and a heart of gold, and another eIf covered in gold coins. It's about magic plant houses. It's about a boy and his Sorry Spoiler It's about an undead Neanderthals life story and dinosaurs with scythes for arms.  It's about a man who's mastery of playing cards makes him a Ganoes Spoiler It's about an insane shadow god trying to make things work in his favor. It's about an alien god getting Crippled God Spoiler  And, of course, a man named Beak.   And it is the best series I have ever read."

Malazan,2nvi4q,FelixViator,34,Sun Nov 30 21:12:42 2014 UTC,That's definitely the worst thing you could have said. The Zombie Neanderthals don't fight the Giant Zombie Velociraptor with swords for hands until the third book.

Malazan,2nvi4q,TriscuitCracker,7,Mon Dec 1 04:03:31 2014 UTC,"As a long time fantasy reader when I read Malazan, and knowing Erikson's D&D background, I got that he was doing subversions of typical fantasy races ie: Titse=elves and Jaghut=orcs when I started reading Malazan and read the descriptions closely. When I read the crazier things like the T'Lann Imass undead Neanderthals (great way to describe them btw) and the K'Chain C'hemalle, I just kind of accepted it. I think Erikson's archeology background helped because every race he introduced had a feeling of ancient-ness, like there was an entire history of an entire species waiting to be discovered, no matter how insane the race seemed. They weren't just thrown in there because ""undead velociraptors with swords for hands are cool"" although that is certainly a component of it, there's an entire species millennium of history behind it, that absolutely impacts what's happening in the present.  He takes it seriously, the characters certainly do, therefore we do as well."
Malazan,2nvi4q,Melloncollieocr,6,Sun Nov 30 23:00:54 2014 UTC,"This is an interesting topic for me. How can something like the Tiste, Forkrul Assail, etc. be accepted but the K'Chain cannot? Is it because the former are ""humanoid"" in appearance but the latter isn't? I never think about this anytime I read high fantasy as my assumption is I am outside of any reasonable assumptions with respect to what is what. That totally me though, I am sure that other peoples past experiences shape what they know today. Interesting conversation for sure."
Malazan,2nvi4q,thingreenlines,2,Sun Nov 30 23:18:18 2014 UTC,"Accepted by whom? I may be off, but doesn't the public at large in the book fear even the Andii? Let alone the Edur took over an empire, an the Liosan kill everyone on sight. The chemaile and naruhk (sp?) don't get along with anyone (but a few humans). The forkrul assail don't either, unless they're ruling a city."
Malazan,2nvi4q,Melloncollieocr,5,Sun Nov 30 23:30:57 2014 UTC,OP is talking about his buddy accepting what the Tiste are as fantasy creatures right? Not how they are received within the context of the book in general. Am I off? I re-read your comment and OP's post and now I have no idea but I thought I interpreted it correctly.
Malazan,2nvi4q,Aiolus,2,Sun Nov 30 23:48:23 2014 UTC,Yeah I was talking about my friend accepting the idea of different races
Malazan,2nvi4q,aleifur,2,Mon Dec 1 01:51:53 2014 UTC,Humanoid creatures are much much much more easily understood then non humanoids. Especially if they don't think like we do.   Even the multi jointed craziness of the Assail feels alien. But their logical mission is understandable.   Intelligent machine building lizards are quite bizarre. If the main protagonist was a K'Chain the book for me wouldn't be very enjoyable as I can't relate terribly well.

Malazan,2nvi4q,Foolishdogs,3,Mon Dec 1 12:38:09 2014 UTC,I thought the K'Chain Che'Malle were fucking ridiculous when they popped up in MoI.  It was like he ripped out a page from my childhood sketchbook of invented Mortal Kombat characters.  I liked them in the end though.
Malazan,2nvi4q,Aiolus,2,Mon Dec 1 01:05:49 2014 UTC,"I really, REALLY enjoy the concept of their species but I really feel like they're way too over the top. If he was trying to make them seem unrelatable and alien thats fine, but they just seem poorly designed. I wish he had kept them as vague and ambiguous as possible. Before you really learn much about them they have this almost lovecraftian quality about them and I loved it. But sometimes too much information can ruin the whole thing, which is what I think happened with the K'chain."
Malazan,2nvi4q,majiinbuu,2,Fri Dec 5 18:30:40 2014 UTC,As both an anthropologist and archeologist he gives it reality for me.    As for zombie neanderthals that is a terrible way of describing a prehistoric race which trapped itself in time for vengeance.
Malazan,2nvi4q,PromisedPrince694,2,Sun Nov 30 23:55:59 2014 UTC,"I will fully admit, I am not good with words."
Malazan,2nvi4q,Foolishdogs,3,Mon Dec 1 01:50:23 2014 UTC,"Heh, that's how I'd describe them too. Besides, you can't really give a lot of detail about them without revealing spoilers.   Also, the description didn't sink in at first for me, but those Shi'Gal assassins are even more ridiculously huge. I checked once before and I'm pretty sure they're taller than an actual T-Rex."
Malazan,2nreev,bantuftw,5,Sat Nov 29 15:11:37 2014 UTC,"Glad you enjoyed reading Memories of Ice! It's one of my favorites in the series too.   Humans have been around for a very, very long time. Keep in mind, the Malazan history is over 300 000 years old. In the prologue, if you remember, roughly 175 000 years before the start of the series, K'rul, Draconus, and Nightchill are walking to curse Kallor for being the tyrant king he is. He's that old. That's also probably around the time the first human civilizations came to be. The founding races, Imass, Jaghut, Che'mall, and Fokrul Assail, are even older still! Warran's are both; though you don't see all of their realms. The way I understand it, his veins are routes you take in order to access the warrans, allowing you to manifest their powers as magic. Each warran is typically associated to a god, whether the god is an elder one is arbitrary. For instance, the warran of shadow holds Shadowthrone, a relatively new god, while the warran of water holds Meal, the Elder God of the sea. However, there is an Elder magic (from these Elder Gods) call Holds. You'll learn more about them later. The reason why Tool's sister is alive after 300 000 years is explained in House of Chains, if you pay close attention enough. Its hidden but it's there. As for the Jaghut, only the relatively powerful ones have reached that age, unless they've been disconnected from the world (like the Seer was. He only lived as long as he did because he was stuck in the Morn rift). But everything in Malazan typically has a longer life span, yes. In regards to your Fener question, I don't remember the specifics. Fener is indeed keeping a low profile while he's in the mortal realm. He'll come back later though."

Malazan,2nreev,AllWrong74,3,Wed Dec 3 17:33:36 2014 UTC,"In regards to how long humans have been around for, the first empire isn't started until iirc, around 100-150 thousand years before the start of the series, and Kallor is older than that by a long shot. In regards to him saying he was around when the Imass were children, i'm pretty sure he's just talking shit. And the Jahgut, Imass, K'Chain Che'malle and the Eres are the founding races.  The nature of warrens starts to make sense as you read the series, and if after you've finished it, you still don't understand read FoD and it pretty much fully explains it. RAFO really.  Most races don't live to be 300k years old, the few individuals we see that are that old are extremely powerful.  The portal in Morn is a rent in reality, exactly like what the T'lan Imass entered in DG when he games Stormy his sword.  They might be aware of him because of his connection to Fener (an excommunicated, almost high-priest.) but not about him personally. They're on the other side of the world from eachother.  Feners Reeve is the religious doctrine of Fener, the rules and rituals of Fener really. A cult that worships a war God needs a reeve or they'll end up killing eachother or something."

Malazan,2nqn4k,MoranthMunitions,1 point,Sat Nov 29 13:31:19 2014 UTC,That character had me cracking up every time it went to that story arc.

Malazan,2nqiz1,gunsterpanda,2,Sat Nov 29 06:01:23 2014 UTC,"I can't recall if it was ever explained... I feel like somewhere in OST or BaB it was said that the Second was chasing him because he was ordered to by someone, not that it was a personal agenda of his or something (though maybe it became that way).  The Second had died and became the Knight of High House Death (Dassem's former role) so perhaps Hood was upset with Skinner for some reason."
Malazan,2nqiz1,MoranthMunitions,2,Sat Nov 29 07:49:27 2014 UTC,"I got the impression that he was chasing him for Hood because the Crimson Guard's pact prevented them from dying naturally.   Heboric called out from where he stood by the trough, ‘Soldier! May I ask – who do you hunt?’ The sharpened teeth lifted and lowered in a silent laugh. ‘Hunt? Oh yes, we all hunt, but I was closest! Piss on Hood’s bony feet! Pluck out the hairs of his nose and kick his teeth in! Drive a spear up his puckered behind and set him on a windy mountain top! Oh, I’ll find him a wife some day, lay coin on it! But first, I hunt!’ He collected the reins, pulled the horse round. The portal opened. ‘Skinner! Hear me, you damned Avowed! Cheater of death! I am coming for you! Now!’ Horse and rider plunged into the rent, vanished, and a moment later the gate disappeared as well.     That first encounter with him, with Cutter and Heboric's in Chapter 4 of BH. That bit about cheater of death is what makes me think that anyway."
Malazan,2nlawd,end_O_the_world_box,6,Thu Nov 27 17:11:47 2014 UTC,"Is it a good idea? Maybe. Is it necessary ? Definitely not.  There are loads of recommended reading orders. The safe bet, is of course just reading the Erikson books all by themselves, then diving into Ice.   Other than that there is the reading order recommended here (possibly outdated?, which mixes them up.  There are definitely character overlap and spoilers though, so just going straight in publication order might not be the best."
Malazan,2nlawd,FreddeCheese,3,Thu Nov 27 17:27:25 2014 UTC,I'm doing this reading order (first time) and am enjoying it so far. On RotCG right now and not bad though some chars really dont care about.
Malazan,2nlawd,danny_b87,2,Thu Nov 27 23:22:45 2014 UTC,"I'm only partway through Stoneweilder at the moment. As it stands, RotCG is probably the worst Malazan book of them all imo. Way too much fluff and dead weight characters.   Have you read the Korbal Broach /Bauchelain novellas yet?"
Malazan,2nlawd,FreddeCheese,2,Thu Nov 27 23:28:58 2014 UTC,"Ah good, only uphill from here then! No, I have the novellas but I keep starting the next book before remembering to read them"
Malazan,2nlawd,danny_b87,1 point,Thu Nov 27 23:47:35 2014 UTC,"Ah, well you can read them any time you want, atleast the very first 3. Lots of good, if somewhat strange, comedy to be had from them. Also some political/satirical musings in The Healthy Dead."
Malazan,2nlawd,FreddeCheese,2,Fri Nov 28 00:12:09 2014 UTC,"RotCG is probably the worst Malazan book of them all imo.   I agree! But despite being bad, it contains very important information concerning some of the characters and events.  Then again, Stonewielder turns a total 180 and is one of the smoothest and most enjoyable Malazan books I've read thus far (I'm 50% done with DoD atm)."
Malazan,2nlawd,beyond1,1 point,Fri Nov 28 07:41:25 2014 UTC,"Oh yeah, it definitely is hugely important.

Then again, Stonewielder turns a total 180 and is one of the smoothest and most enjoyable Malazan books I've read thus far (I'm 50% done with DoD atm).   Definetly feeling the same here!

Malazan,2nlawd,tve123,1 point,Mon Dec 1 05:01:41 2014 UTC,"I'm doing this same order and am in the same spot (~half way through RotCG) and have the exact same impression.  Some ICE scenes I just blow through and others are a total slog, whereas Erikson is a bit more consistent.  Either way I do recommend combining them as there are characters and plotlines which do overlap/intersect."
Malazan,2nlawd,pfk505,5,Sun Nov 30 08:47:32 2014 UTC,"I would recommend against it. Nothing much to be gained from it, and it makes the series feel really slow."
Malazan,2nlawd,SageOfTheWise,4,Thu Nov 27 18:01:09 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I would read the main 10 series, then Esselmont. On the sidebar there is a list of reading them with Esselmont included, but I'd do that on your 1st reread. There are several events going on in the world in the main  series that are mentioned in passing, and Esselmont does the back story of those events and fills in some gaps. Not as good as Erikson, but very enjoyable for your eventual Malazan fix needs."
Malazan,2nlawd,TriscuitCracker,3,Thu Nov 27 17:32:02 2014 UTC,"There is some character overlap and some events that are relevant to the main series, but nothing that you need to read because they're referenced later on anyway. Basically, you can read either series alone or you can read them together. If you want to read them together:   GotM  DG  MoI  HoC  MT  NoK  tBH  RG  RotCG  TtH  SW  DoD  tCG  OST  BaB  ASL  Them the novellas can be read any time after MoI, I think."
Malazan,2nlawd,PromisedPrince694,3,Thu Nov 27 17:27:22 2014 UTC,"Most people recommend sticking to the Erikson books in your first read through, and then adding in the Esslemont books one your second go.  The biggest issue people have with Esslemont is that he's not Erikson. His writing style is different. People go in expecting more Erikson prose, and so it's jarring to them. While I think Erikson is the stronger writer, Esslemont is good in his own way. Some readers just ahve a hard time adjusting.  You won't lose anything in the main story if you don't read the Esslemont books, but you will get some cool insight to the background and overall story arc of the Malazan world."
Malazan,2nlawd,mgallowglas,2,Thu Nov 27 17:31:39 2014 UTC,"There is some character overlap but not much. As for spoilers, Ice doesn't spoil any of Erikson's but Erikson mildly may spoil one or two things from the Ice books.  My first read I read them together and while not necessary I recommend doing the same."
Malazan,2nlawd,turnpikenorth,2,Thu Nov 27 17:49:09 2014 UTC,Do not read ICE at the same time as Eriksons. Eriksons an excellent writer don't spoil it read ICE after.
Malazan,2nlawd,Aiolus,2,Fri Nov 28 15:22:29 2014 UTC,I recommend doing it when you do your re-read like I'm doing now.
Malazan,2nlawd,SerBronnofBlackwater,2,Fri Nov 28 21:07:43 2014 UTC,"I'm going with the Wertzone reading order myself. It's good so far. Erikson is definitely better but the ICE novels aren't bad either. Series definitely goes a bit slower this way, I'm sure."

My Heboric was larger, stockier, stronger / more capable looking.  Physically speaking, this dude here looks like how I would picture Iskral Pust (minus the skin tone).  I would think that Heboric would have to be at least somewhat stout to be able to survive both the mines and the journey from there all the way to Raraku."

Malazan,2necog,hatchet4life,3,Tue Nov 25 19:07:18 2014 UTC,"From my memory (not exact, I'll admit, I'm on my first reread and on BH now) I believe that Seven Cities remains under Malazan rule after the events of HoC/BH and stays that way for the remainder of the series as the Fourteenth moves on.   Genebackis more or less stays the way it was. The Empire retained its hold on the 11 cities they had on that continent, and I believe we never hear anything about Pale being liberated after Dujek's host moves out after being outlawed. I always chalked it up to there never being a real unified force on Genebackis to rebel against the Empire after the Pannion Domin was taken care of, so the status quo was maintained there. There was also no need for Brood to rebel any further after MoI because Dujek's host had moved out to Seven Cities to squash the rebellion, leaving the Malazan occupied cities the way they were but also halting expansion for the moment.  I haven't read any of the ICE books other than Night of Knives, so I can't help you on the Korel issue."
Malazan,2necog,holyplankton,2,Tue Nov 25 20:21:58 2014 UTC,"Just to let you know - ICE's Orb, Sceptre, Throne is based primarily in Darujhistan and addresses some of the post-Dujek Genabackis."

Malazan,2necog,holyplankton,2,Wed Nov 26 14:24:45 2014 UTC,They get progressively better. I really enjoyed the last 2...
Malazan,2necog,likwidstylez,3,Wed Nov 26 14:53:07 2014 UTC,"I imagine the Toblakai trilogy will go further into Genebackis at least and likely a bunch of other continents.   Having said that, here we go with spoilers from everything that has been written so far. Please bear in mind that I am mostly doing this from memory and it's been a while since I read them all. Feel free to correct me:  I think Korel is done with. One of aims of the campaign was to get rid of the Lady and that was achieved. With the Mare fleet mostly destroyed or at least severely depleted by the blue Moranth, keeping in touch with the Empire will be a lot easier.  Seven Cities won't be a major problem now - they destroyed the Whirlwind army & the plague having sucked the life out of the rest of the continent I doubt it will cause issues for a long time now.  As for Jacuruku and Assail I don't think there is an official Empire presence there, at least not a major one at the moment. However there are representatives around which means they have an interest in those two continents. (I don't remember a lot of Blood and Bone so I might be wrong about that. Any correction welcome.)  Return of the Crimson Guard shows that they have subjugated the main rebellious elements of the people on Quon Tali.  Assail - all of ICEs books after Stonewielder - shows that the Crimson Guard are now no longer interested in their perpetual war against the Empire so that is no longer a primary concern for the Emperor.   What I imagine he is mostly focused on now is Lether. It is a flipping big place and they now have a stable economy and a popular leader. Will that mean anything to Mallick Rel?  Will he start thinking about expansion & conquest? I personally don't think so. A lot of the places the Empire conquered were horrible places and there is a consensus that actually, the Empire was a good thing. Lether is now not like that. Taking over would be a lot harder and the locals even more resistant than the likes of Genebackis and Seven Cities.  All in all the Empire is not in a bad state. I hate to admit it because I despise him, but actually Mallick Rel isn't that bad as an Emperor. I seriously can't wait for the Toblakai Trilogy. That should give us an insight into what has happened since, well Bonehunters and Return of the Crimson Guard/Stonewielder.  Tl;dr read the flipping thing it took me long enough to write on my phone..."
Malazan,2necog,TisteSimeon,3,Tue Nov 25 20:54:38 2014 UTC,"I haven't read Assail, but I don't recall any official Malazan presence on Jacuruku.  I'm not sure conflict is that likely between Lether and the Malazan Empire. Contact has been made, but the Malazan Empire itself knows little about Lether, and given the distances involved and the ability of Lether to defend itself (Total military strength at the beginning of Midnight Tides was something like 600k, it's probably a lot smaller now but that's still a huge force by Malazan standards) I can't see the Malazans trying to conquer Lether any time soon.  That said, I disagree with your summary. The Empire is in a terrible state. There was just a huge rebellion on Quon Tali that was narrowly suppressed. There was a huge rebellion on Seven Cities that left tens of thousands dead, followed by plague, resulting in starvation throughout the empire.   The Wickans are pretty much at war with the Empire, the events of OST severely destabilized the Malazan presence on Genebackis, Tayschrenn is gone...the Malazan Empire no longer has any military leaders of note, and the Claw, the main tool by which Laseen maintained order, has been seriously compromised. True, it was Mallick Rel who compromised it, but it remains a cesspit of backstabbing with severely reduced effectiveness at controlling the population.   Could the Empire recover? Yes, it's possible, if everything goes right. But it's in an incredibly fragile state right now."
Malazan,2necog,ElmoTheNefarious,1 point,Tue Nov 25 22:39:51 2014 UTC,"Perhaps I should have said that all things considered and compared to a vast majority of their enemies, the Empire isn't in too bad a state. I mean sure it is reeling from a number of setbacks (not least of which the Bonehunters could have been it's greatest asset and are not) but comparatively it has come out better than most.  Who are the enemies left to the Empire that are still actively opposing it? I can't think of any. The most worrying of them - the Andii,  Brood & his forces, the Crimson Guard - are no longer at war & were even allies for a while in some cases!  Shadowthrone and Cotillion may still have some plans but their main beef was against Lasseen and they are also ""big picture"" guys who would probably prefer the peace that currently is rather than stirring up more trouble and the possibility of involving more gods/ascendants. (Power draws power etc.)  Which leaves us with a few unknowns. You haven't read Assail yet so I won't mention any of the elements there but I don't think they would actively go against the Empire. Should Rel decide to attack Assail, that may cause issues, but there are enough who have been there who would know enough to advise him against that.  T'lan Imass, not going to happen for a variety of reasons. Jaghut, same story and there are not many of them left.   There simply aren't enough races/species/groups who the Empire has annoyed left to make a difference.   Which leads us to Karsa Orlong. And considering he is one of the most well written, well developed and unpredictable characters in the whole series who knows what he is going to do? Plus he has a grudging respect for the Malazan Empire so I don't think any speculation will come close to what is actually planned."
Malazan,2necog,TisteSimeon,3,Tue Nov 25 22:57:17 2014 UTC,"There aren't any known external threats sufficient to bring the Empire down, but there's no shortage of internal threats. The Malazan Empire's success is predicated on life under the Empire being better than life before the conquest. Widespread starvation resulting from the Seven Cities plague is very likely to result in new rebellions popping up, and the Imperial leadership is in a bad state to deal with them. Laseen spent years eliminating any subordinate she couldn't trust, and now Mallick Rell will have to do the same thing all over again. Numerous Imperial governors were assassinated across northern Genebackis. Admiral Nok, Greymane, and Dassem Ultor are all out of the picture. And the loss of Tayschrenn is likely of more importance than we yet realize.  I don't see the Empire being conquered, but I could easily see it crumbling under the weight of internal divisions."
Malazan,2necog,ElmoTheNefarious,1 point,Wed Nov 26 00:32:47 2014 UTC,"You could very well be right and while I disagree - Mallick Rel set up his own Claw/Talon organisation and supplanted the old one fairly efficiently. He probably has a top rate intelligence operation in place. I also seem to remember something about him doing some ""humanitarian"" type things in Unta and other places and got a lot of the locals on his side. Could be wrong about that though.  I also recall some kind of deal being made with the Wickans but it's been a while. It's also 1:15 am & I need my beauty sleep. Will try to do some research tomorrow to see if there is any other bits missing."
Malazan,2necog,TisteSimeon,1 point,Wed Nov 26 01:14:36 2014 UTC,"My impression was that Mallick Rel had the resources to take the throne but not necessarily the resources to hold it. His infiltration of the Claw would have centered on Malaz Isle and Unta, as well as Seven Cities, but less so Genebackis etc. He certainly has resources and connections all over the place, that's how he achieved his rise to power. He's a scrappy fucker and he might well manage to hold it all together, but I certainly see his position as it stands at the end of TCG as precarious."
Malazan,2necog,ElmoTheNefarious,1 point,Wed Nov 26 02:52:35 2014 UTC,"Also don't forget that after Kallanved and Dancer's ascension, it was still their empire. They ruled from the shadow."
Malazan,2necog,Landmarkmoon,1 point,Wed Nov 26 00:51:31 2014 UTC,"This discussion has been illuminating and intriguing!  The Empire indeed remains at the minimum, as strong at the end of the series as it was at the beginning of the series...territorially.    (I apologize for not properly citing to poster names and specific posts, I'm a longtime lurker and more or less first time poster, so just know I'm referring to everyone in the thread...sorry, don't pwn the newb)  It's likely it is even stronger:  I am most confused about who controls what in Korel since only ICE has anything to say about it, but it is my feeling that the Empire controls at least soooome of Korel compared to none of it, given the events in Stonewielder.  Take the events of Assail into account, and the empire likely expanded even more.  As for Seven Cities and Genabackis, they probably returned to the GotM status quo (based on my interpretation of the commenters' excellent commentary of the Crimson Guard's motivation and the state of Seven Cities).  That resolves, in my mind at least, the territorial discussion.  As for the future...well:   There are likely no other enemies other than Lether, which is a major enemy, and the two states are at the least very far from each other, so likely the empire will remain for some time. Rel seems to be pragmatic, given how he has gone about expanding/consolidating the empire in ICE's books...and that he was able to secure the throne in the first place.  The question is, therefore, whether the rot of the empire (to quote a Moranth in GotM) has festered or can be cut out by the end of the series.  Based on my impression of how Rel rules, I'd say the Empire has a long time to go, but isn't going to grow any larger.   Grub became the First Sword of the Late Empire period.  The late empire period could last who knows how long, but probably is the period of decline following the zenith of the Empire's power.  So, based on one italicized passage introducing a chapter in a 10 book series, I base my conclusion: once all of ICE and SE's books have been finished, the Malazan Empire will have reached the height of its power.  Who knows how long it will last after that?!?!"
Malazan,2necog,TisteSimeon,2,Wed Nov 26 06:09:01 2014 UTC,Just to point out that Lether is not an enemy of the Malazan Empire. I doubt Tehol would instigate anything and Mallick Rel is too busy consolidating and strengthening what he has.

Malazan,2n8060,Notalec,1 point,Tue Nov 25 01:49:59 2014 UTC,"Little of column A, little of column B. Perspective definitely makes it look bigger. Take that coupled with the Imass not being fully formed, the Imass being a bit smaller than humans by default, and that you probably had them in your heads as being more sized like Utah raptors, and you get that image.  Here's the description in-book.   How to describe such a demonic entity? When upright, it would have balanced on two hugely muscled hind legs, reminiscent to that of a shaba, the flightless bird found on the isles of the Draconean Archipelago, yet in comparison much larger here. The hip level of the fiend, when standing, would have been at a man's eye level. Long-tailed, the weight of the fiend's torso evenly balanced by its hips, thrusting the long neck and head far forward, the spine made horizontal. Two long forelimbs, thickly bound in muscle and hardened scales providing natural armour, ended, not in grasping talons or hands, but enormous swords, iron-bladed, that seemed fused,metal to bone, with the wrists. The head was snouted, like that of a crococdile, such as those found in the mud of the southern shoreline of the Bluerose Sea, yet again, here much larger. Desiccation had peeled the lips back to reveal jagged rows of fangs, each one dagger-long. The eyes, clouded with approaching death, were nonetheless uncanny and alien to our senses.   So, take the Imass being smaller than humans, and it's not far off."
Malazan,2n8060,Spicy-Chicken,1 point,Tue Nov 25 02:39:56 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I definitely had to remind myself how big they were every now and then. I think in that picture though the head/shoulders and the swords are way out of proportion to the hips, which seem more reasonably sized."

Malazan,2n8060,TurboS40,2,Mon Nov 24 08:45:06 2014 UTC,"I believe the images are, in order (warning, spoilers):   There has been debate on the cover image. Everyone seems to agree that the hound is a Deragoth despite it being the wrong color. It was suggested that the character whose back is to the viewer is Karsa and the artist took some liberties and created a scene that was not explicitly in the book. I don't think the character could be Onrack (doesn't look like a T'lan Imass whatsoever) and I don't think Trull ever faces a Deragoth (unless you count when Onrack freed two of them). However, there is a part near the end of the book where L'oric faces a charging Deragoth in Raraku's Memory (details are a bit fuzzy) that I think is plausible.

Malazan,2n7wq5,jo-zay,7,Mon Nov 24 01:32:07 2014 UTC,"IIRC, the king and his entourage knowingly poisoned themselves (I think it may have been the Chancellor who actually did it), believing Rhulad unable to be killed, and their deaths inevitable.   The Crippled God originally planned on Hannan Mosag wielding his sword, but Mosag went back on the deal by intending to use the CG's power to insulate the Edur, rather than domination as the CG needed. The CG saw an opportunity in Rhulad, and took the chance. I don't think it was ever explicitly mentioned what Mosag was supposed to get out of the deal, but it probably involved empty promises of ruling over a healed realm of Shadow."

I must inform you, Mok, that your mask has cracked.’ The Seguleh reached up, probed tentatively, finding then following the hairline fissure running two-thirds of the length on the left side.   Assuming you added the two scratches on to add character the picture. Also, as an enamel mask it probably wouldn't have that sort of ""grain"" to it, like you've drawn which makes it look kind of carved from a white tree or something, it'd just be a smooth white sort of thing. Though I figure that's so that you can do some shading etc. reasonably and make the mask shape noticeable.  I kind of agree with the other comment on the hair too, maybe it's just because of how everything to do with the Seguleh is to do with economy/efficiency, they seem like the sort of people who would shave to have the decreased weight/drag even if they were hairy.  Anyway, cool picture.  Do you think if some of the characters you draw change appearance over the series you'll redraw them and list their name with their different titles (assuming those change too, because those are the things that tend to change most often)? Though there's only a few characters that I can think of that you'd probably want to do like that, but they're the sorts of characters who are important enough you'll probably end up drawing them."

She disapproved of the actions her followers were making, so she killed them all of because of the influence it was causing her. (If that is not the case with Poliel, someone please correct me!)  This is very much a recurring theme in the series. That in the real world in our belief in God(s), we perceive of that relationship as unidirectional. That being how belief in a God shapes the believer, Erikson then puts forth this question of how might a believer shape the God? Can a God become something different because of the actions of the believers? For example, a God of peace has its followers co-opted by a group of warmongers. Would that God of peace go insane because of the amount of war, death, and suffering all caused in its name?"
Malazan,2n69ea,Bilbato,3,Sun Nov 23 20:27:23 2014 UTC,"Yeah I was on my phone on the train so it wasn't too in depth. And it was drek that killed her followers on RG. Poliel was killed by Paran.  I think I meant that this relationship between followers and gods is mentioned here so I wouldn't be surprised if we eventually get a new, more compassionate look at CG later on in the series, if you get my meaning."
Malazan,2n2mqu,Lorris,5,Sat Nov 22 11:05:26 2014 UTC,"I will say I really liked the Chain of Dogs sequence, but I can see where being ""put in the army"" isn't for everyone. I was not a big fan of Felisin's arc as she always just came off as a petulant, ungrateful little bitch all the time. Baudin and Heboric go through the trouble of getting her out of a slave camp and all she does is insult them and complain about how tough a time she had there? Go to Hood.  I will say that MoI was a more enjoyable read for me than DG was. Outside of the actual Chain of Dogs and some stuff with Gesler and Stormy, I wasn't that big a fan of the book. MoI is a much more epic depiction of a fantasy war and brings back a lot of the characters you got used to in Gardens of the Moon. It also takes place at the same time as DG, so be prepared for a little confusion at the outset. MoI puts you back in the mind of the leaders of the army, rather than being in the mind of just another soldier, so I think you'll find that more enjoyable, and the finale of the book is just fantastic. I hope you keep reading and enjoy the rest of the series."
Malazan,2n2mqu,holyplankton,4,Sat Nov 22 11:28:57 2014 UTC,"Hey! I just finished deadhouse gates a few days ago so I can share my thoughts on this too. Personally I thought each battle scene was very vivid and detailed, such that I can clearly see in my imagination each scene as it happened. Which I why I enjoyed it immensely.  However I can understand if other people thought it was too much, as there are there are about 3 (4?) battles that take place in random places in the desert, and then after they finish each battle it's like ""oh, so now you're going to march through this next desert until you reach the NEXT random place in that desert too.""  Perhaps Eriksen could have cut down on around ONE of the chain of dogs scene so that the whole army could have gotten to Aren earlier and forwarded at a faster pace eg. having Tavore arrive earlier, etc."
Malazan,2n2mqu,FranzSchubert,7,Sat Nov 22 11:24:37 2014 UTC,"That would completely contradict the emphasis that he was placing on the Chain of Dogs. It was a long, grueling procession. If it came across as tedious, that's because it was meant to."
Malazan,2n2mqu,MortalSword_MTG,1 point,Sat Nov 22 17:13:21 2014 UTC,"I just recently reread DG, and this was something I didn't pick up on during my first reread. The battle locations were not random. They were pretty much all at fords where the opposing army would have an advantage in terrain and the Chain of dogs would need to slow down for an extended period of time, defend on two fronts with limited ability to maneuver. They may seem random but I feel Erikson did a good job of describing a long campaign where it doesn't make sense to throw your army against superior troops without wearing them down."
Malazan,2n2mqu,Qster101,4,Sun Nov 30 21:59:47 2014 UTC,"why would you stop reading simply because you didn't like 1 section from one of the books. Everyone has POV's and story arcs they prefer to others.  I for one am your opposite -  I for example liked everything apart from the Felisin arc, and i also found that the chain of dogs part got tecious at time. Felisin arc was like shes going on a emotional and characteristic change, and shes kind of a bitch to everyone, I get it, no need for multiple chapters of her just complaining about everything but never actually doing jack shit herself. All because 'she doesn't care and wants to die anyways, so she doesn't have to ever be grateful about anything.  I just love the other parts of DG to much to care.   So no. I would not quit the series simply because you didn't like one part."
Malazan,2n2mqu,HumbleAsFudge,2,Sat Nov 22 16:22:15 2014 UTC,"I can totally see your point about the Chain; it can drag and be ponderous among other things. And while that's not how I feel personally about it, frankly, if you liked it, you liked it, and if you didn't, you didn't. We can't convince you to ""like"" something just because the majority consensus is the opposite of how you feel.  You can't debate someone or convince someone into liking anything. Liking a book or anything for that matter is a subjective experience and different for everyone.  We don't want to bash you and send you off Malazan forever, we'd be doing you a disservice to this wonderful experience of Malazan.  You should  absolutely read Memories of Ice; it's what cemented my love of Malazan for life. Thanks for posting, it can take guts to go against popular opinion."
Malazan,2n2mqu,TriscuitCracker,2,Sat Nov 22 14:12:29 2014 UTC,"I would still check out MoI, it's actually very different. I didn't care for DG  nearly like I did for MoI on my first read through. That said, I just finished rereading DG, and I appreciated it much more after finishing the series."
Malazan,2n2mqu,Giotto,2,Sat Nov 22 21:05:21 2014 UTC,"The others here have basically covered much of what I was going to say. In short: Coltaine and the Chain of Dogs did not resonate with me half as much as what most people say. I've only read it once, but it is not among my top 5 books of the series. MoI is my, hands down, dead on, favourite book of all time, let alone of the series.  For the love of god, read MoI, and if that doesn't do it for you, then maybe rethink continuing."
Malazan,2n2mqu,Eispeis,1 point,Sat Nov 22 21:30:53 2014 UTC,"Hi there! Personally I don't share your opinion on the Chain of Dogs, I really enjoyed it myself, but in the end different things will hit people differently. And I love that you really enjoyed the Felisin (and other) sections. She's such a well-written character, and her journey with Heboric, Baudin and friends can drag the reader through the full gamut of emotions just as much as the Chain can - unfortunately for me it really wasn't until my second or third read through the book that I came to appreciate this.   As for whether MoI/the rest of the series is worth continuing with, I think it absolutely is. In my opinion there are plenty of plotlines and characters to come that will be just as interesting and fun to read as the Felisin arc was for you."

She was such a douchebag but you sort of sympathised with her. Baudin revealing to her that everything she thought she did for them was for nothing was hard to read. I think the Chain of Dogs was awesome though, sorry. And come on, the end bit with Mappo, Stormy and Gesler? When they were healing Bent and Roach? That was so depressing."

Malazan,2n2mqu,leogodin217,1 point,Sat Nov 22 14:43:11 2014 UTC,"I think perhaps this series is not for you?  Just going on what you've listed here. This series often looks at events from the perspective of the common soldiers. Sure, there is plenty with the big players as well, but really the core of the story is about the common people and how they get swept up into the games of more powerful entities.   Coltaine is aloof and distant because that is the role of a great warleader. He carries the burdens of thousands of lives, and can't be close to most of them. It would be detrimental for him and for those he is responsible for. Being that most of the Chain of Dogs is from that perspective, it makes alot of sense you feel that way."
Malazan,2n2mqu,MortalSword_MTG,1 point,Sat Nov 22 17:19:29 2014 UTC,"The Chain of Dogs is about sacrifice, murder, chivalry, and disgrace. It's not comfortable, like a slow painful death. Yeah no shit it dragged on. I loved it.  Coltaine4Lyfe"
Malazan,2n2mqu,Landmarkmoon,1 point,Sat Nov 22 20:59:07 2014 UTC,"I love how all of our opinions differ so greatly in general in this sub. Honestly, the Chain was far and away my favorite part of the whole main series. I know what you mean about not caring that much about Coltaine himself though. I never got emotionally worked up or anything, but the heartbreaking part about the end was how easily the Chain could have been helped by the Aren Garrison, and they essentially just watched everyone get slaughtered.   Concerning you continuing the series, there are certainly more ""following the army"" story arcs over all the books, but they aren't the same, and there is so much more as well. If you finish MoI and just think, ""well that was dull,"" then maybe the series won't be for you."
Malazan,2n2mqu,androgymouse,1 point,Sat Nov 22 22:40:02 2014 UTC,"Hey, just because you didn't love the chain of dogs doesn't mean you should quit the whole series. It's a vast series with maaaaany characters and many story lines. Your dislike of a single storyline (out of 4 as i recall) no more disqualifies you from enjoying the rest of the series as disliking the felisin disqualified me. I can promise you that he does not repeat the chain of dogs for the next 8 books. That wouldn't be exactly sustainable.  I can promise you that as you spend more time with the characters of the series you will get closer to those of the fallen who stay alive. Personally I enjoyed the chain of dogs, for the sake of duiker's point of view and the epicness of it. The point of the books is mainly the immediacy of the individual and their struggle. Maybe you didn't feel for coltaine when he died, but I doubt that you didn't feel for squint, and didn't appreciate the sacrifice the 7th made in trying to save the refugees. Coltaine was mainly a inspiration for the heroics of the common soldier. If you feel like you consistently need to be invested in the figurehead, that isn't exactly the point of this series. If you can appreciate being along for the ride, its the best there is. There are many instances of living with the armies in this series, because all the characters are soldiers. But, they are all different in feel, and some are incredibly bad-ass. I can also say that the characterization and writing through the series is definitely top notch.  I suggest you keep reading, there's something in the series for everyone. Hope you enjoy MoI, I think you will. It was my favorite of the series."
Malazan,2n2mqu,anointed9,1 point,Sun Nov 23 03:47:26 2014 UTC,"I liked Felisins parts, but not her herself. I loved Coltaines, because it gave me the most heroic sacrifice feeling even from the start. That coltaine wasn't just a military commander, that he was fully committed to saving te innocent, the truly innocent and not the entitled, knowing there would be sacrifices and still doing it, even to the point of sacrificing his own people to make sure the civs survive as best as possible. Kind of the impossible odds type. A lot of the Non Wickans hated it in the way that their selfishness blinded them to the greater good. IMO the Chain of Dogs was the most heart rending part of the entire series, especial because blahblahRAFOblah"
Malazan,2n2mqu,verheyen,1 point,Sun Nov 23 12:28:50 2014 UTC,"I had issues with the Chain of Dogs sequences too.  As curious as I was about Coltaine--his march takes up two maps at the front of the book--I didn't care much for the story around him.  It got better as things went along, and I mourned his death.  The Chain of Dogs was one of the weaker story elements for me."
Malazan,2n0nwp,gogomom,12,Fri Nov 21 20:32:48 2014 UTC,"Deadhouse Gates is probably my favorite, but Memories Of Ice is a close second.  This series is incredible. Over time, you'll understand more and more. It's normal if you don't understand everything.   I've read most of the books twice, and I loved them even more the second time around.  Probably due to understanding things better."
Malazan,2n0nwp,leogodin217,3,Fri Nov 21 20:46:42 2014 UTC,"Yep. I'm on my first reread of the main 10 books right now. Enjoying it much more than my first time since I am catching all of the details. However, I also enjoyed my first read enough to want to read it again."
Malazan,2n0nwp,Teddyholden,9,Sat Nov 22 00:43:56 2014 UTC,"While it will be easier to understand as you go along, this is an important time to evaluate the series. MoI is set on the same continent as Gardens, and you will recognize a lot of names.  But at the same time, a ""slow"" first half leading into a huge finish is a hallmark of the series. If you didn't like the majority of DG, I imagine that House of Chains, the fourth, and Midnight Tides will also be a slog for you.  Personally, there were only four sequences in the series I found disinteresting (one being the Felesin arc in DG), the other three coming later in the series. But for me, they paid off in the end and were always surrounded by exciting sequences. I want to encourage you to go on, and you certainly should push through MoI, it's in my top three of the series for sure. But if you really, really struggle with getting through the first  half of the books and don't think the payoff is worth it, then well, the series isn't for everyone."

Malazan,2n0nwp,TrevorAndCorey,6,Sat Nov 22 03:12:36 2014 UTC,"So first of all, I will point out that ""not knowing things"" is sorta a stylistic choice he makes, and it's one that I really enjoy. Many questions are eventually answered, but it can take a very long time (6+ books later), and it does expect you to piece some things together yourself.  If you think that you can take on the attitude of not always understanding what is going on and just enjoying the mystery, then I think that you might start enjoying them more.  But, in the end it isn't a series for everyone.  I usually tell people to read at least the first two before giving up, and the first three if they are willing to make that investment.  I'd encourage you to read MoI and if you still aren't enjoying it then it probably just isn't for you.  One last piece of potentially relevant information is that MoI returns to Genabackis and the Bridgeburners, so you'll be going back to some familiarity unlike going into DG.  I will warn you that there are still a lot of new things introduced, and other books in the series will also jump into entirely new settings/casts, but MoI might not be as much of a struggle."
Malazan,2n0nwp,SchizoStarcraft,2,Fri Nov 21 21:40:06 2014 UTC,"This was the encouragement I needed - I was so thrown by the diversity of characters in the books - and although I could see where they connected, it felt like it could have been two complete and separate story lines through the same fantasy world.  Although interesting, I couldn't see myself investing in the hundreds of characters that would come to the forefront if he continued along this pattern of introducing so many new characters in every book - it made the entire series feel too daunting - like I should be taking notes or something.  The fact that we will be returning to the Bridgeburners puts me at ease and allows me to start from somewhere familiar.  Off to Indigo."
Malazan,2n0nwp,frankhorse,1 point,Fri Nov 21 21:52:21 2014 UTC,"Long run he will keep doing that but the last 4 or 5 books, when he begins to weave together 5 or 6 huge story plots, you get this sense of awe which, for me, is simply unparalleled in writing, as well as compared to most things in real life. He's worth the investment and MoI is the book to hook you if you have doubts."
Malazan,2n0nwp,ivebinmemeingtoasku,2,Sat Nov 22 02:15:51 2014 UTC,"MoI slogs a little in the beginning but when you get halfway in, like I just did, whoa. I actually enjoy not knowing and jotting things down to look up. I reference the maps and wiki constantly. I heard someone say it, it's like studying the history of an alien planet through the eyes of the current major powers.   Edit: In DG Felesin annoyed me but I'm encouraged by the end of her arc in that book. And the Chain, that ending..."
Malazan,2n0nwp,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Sat Nov 22 03:33:26 2014 UTC,I always found that it helps to keep referring to the dramatis personae during the early parts of eriksons books just so i don't feel as lost.

And if you stop in frustration, no harm no foul, the series isn't for everybody. But I implore you to keep trying, at least make it through Memories of Ice, it's what cemented me into the series for life. Erikson does not spoonfeed you infodumps and tends to be heavy on the introspective philosophy. Each book starts off slow, with character and plot building and history and events in the area, and then as you've seen, about halfway-3/4 through each book, it just keeps ramping up until your at a full blown crazy Convergence of everything that can make you laugh, cry, weep, and gasp. They are that amazing.   The glossary and the dramatis personae are your friends, and you can always hit us up here for spoiler free questions. You feel like you got dropped into a foreign country with no understanding of the language and the customs and are expected to teach a history class. Imagine Malazan as a historians notes on a subject, and they use terms and words that are normal for their time, but you, as the reader, have no clue and have to figure it out via context and connecting the dots, this is half the fun of what Malazan is all about, seeing how events and characters and plotlines connect across the books and seeing how it all ""Converges"" into the Crippled God, Book 10. Plenty of ""oooooh"" and ""ahha!"" moments to come for you. Erikson is an archeologist and anthropologist and it really shows in his writings, every place and long lived character you come across has that vast, old, epic feeling to it."

It's a helluva task, and it will break your brain.   Just go along for the ride, like an intern's first week in an ER. There's a lot going on that you won't understand until much later on anyway; even if you've lost the plot a little on something you did have enough information for now, you'll pick it up again soon enough.   A lot of novelists use an outsider's perspective to slowly introduce the reader to the concepts in the book.   With the minor exception of Paran in the first part of GoTM, Erikson eschews this in favour of a more direct approach: the reader is the outsider, and they can learn from context the way an outsider character would: in dribs and drabs, on the march.   It's... challenging... but it's a hell of a lot of fun once you get into stride."

Knowing the state of the houses isn't really common knowledge to begin with, that's probably why.   As for people who do have the knowledge but don't put it together, well, it's hard to say how obvious it is before its pointed out. Houses open an close in the deck occasionally, you probably don't expect those to be tied to events you know about. People probably just don't put to much thought into why shadow opened back up. (and the ones who did probably did figure it out).  Kind of a third point, really up to you if this counts. This is technically actually revealed in GotM Tattersail is having a conversation with Quick Ben and Whiskyjack and they spell out all the dots, but before they actually have to spell out the conclusion and say  ""Shadowthrone is Kellanved"", Tattersail says basically 'oh shit that's obvious when you put it that way' and the conversation moves on. Almost no reader ever seems to pick up on this (including me). But if you went back and read it it suddenly read incredibly obvious.

Kalam going into it doesn't make him ""indebted"" to Shadowthrone. Think the reference so far ibm your read to Dassems Daughter. No mention at all of Dassem being in debt.

Kallor is an asshole through and through, but don't dismiss him quite just yet. Really hurt when that scene with Whiskeyjack happened.   Just a warning on House of Chains. After MOI it comes as quite a literary shock and you may hate the character it focuses on at first but keep reading and he's one of the greatest characters in the series by the books end. Also look for scenes that harken back to events from previous books.  There are many ""Ah-HAH!"" moments.   Any other impressions? Quick Ben vs the necromancers? Gruntle? Poor, poor Toc? The sheer awesomeness of Itvokian? Segulah and Envy and the balls of Erikson to create a race of velociraptors with blades for arms? Kruppe vs Brood? Rake being a badass? And of course good to see Paran and the Bridgeburners again.   Excuse me I need to go read MOI...."
Malazan,2mz5fb,HustSword,2,Fri Nov 21 14:44:17 2014 UTC,"I'm sooooooo glad I've just started my first reread. Nailed GotM in about 5 days, and almost finished NoK.   DG and MoI were two of my favs on first go through, and I was also thrown and a bit lost by the shift in HoC and MT, but I'm now pumped to revisit them and re-experience what I didn't appreciate and understand the first time round."
Malazan,2mz5fb,TriscuitCracker,2,Fri Nov 21 15:12:13 2014 UTC,"Bloody hell, Toc went through so much shit! I've really grown to love his character, and to see him tortured, broken and mangled at the hands of the seer, just broke my heart; especially since I was pretty sure he was gonna tap the fine piece of ass that is Lady Envy ;)  When Tool came for him, called him his brother, I just couldn't stop smiling.   Kruppe facing off with Brood was one of my favourite scenes in the whole book, perhaps the series, so far. That man is definitely my favourite character, I love his flowery sentences, the way he always pulls out his handkerchief and mops the sweat from his forehead, and that scene where he's mentioned to be demanding white face paint from Hetan. Love him!  Itkovian... what a noble soul! Same as with Whiskeyjack, when I read that he died I shouted 'NO!' The scene where Itkovian's Gift was built, again, nearly brought me to tears. So much sacrifice, so heavy a weight on that man's shoulders. I'll always remember that scene in the siege of Capustan with the mounds of dead tenescowri around him and his warhorse; when he broke away and his soldiers rose up from said mounds was just fucking awesome.  Steven Erikson is a behemoth of a writer. I read the prologue and the first couple of scenes of HoC and, you're right, I can't say I love this Karsa Orlong who's setting out on a journey to pillage villages and kill children, but I wanted Tayschrenn dead in GotM and now I think he's a pretty cool guy, so who knows what will happen? Well, you do since I assume you've read them all, but you know what I mean."
Malazan,2mz5fb,DuckDuckFlow,2,Fri Nov 21 22:47:03 2014 UTC,"Yep, Itvokian is what made me love this series. And if you like Kruppe, your gonna love the future characters of Tehol and Bugg.    Think of Karsa Orlong as your typical fantasy barbarian. Which he stereotypically is at the beginning of HoC. By the end he is....not. And we all know how Erikson twists typical fantasy tropes on their heads.   Instead of lilting beautiful elves who sing a lot and are happy and secure in the world we get the Titse who are either depressed, asshole-ish or murderous and all of them lost their god in some way.   Instead of stupid orcs that can't string two sentences together and are cannon fodder, we get Jaghut, the wittiest species ever and who despise groups.   Instead of dwarves who love technology we get um....K'Chain C'hemalle who merge metal to flesh and do other technological wonders and look like velociraptors. Okay maybe that's reaching lol but you get the idea."
Malazan,2mz5fb,Ares0362,1 point,Sat Nov 22 01:29:41 2014 UTC,Itvokian and his death was probably one of the few times I was actually touched by a book/movie
Malazan,2mz5fb,HustSword,1 point,Sat Nov 22 01:03:29 2014 UTC,"Itkovians death was the saddest to me. He had to have been my favourite character in MOI. His unwavering loyalty to fener, the loss of his friends then dying for the T'lan Imass... :( he was a character who did so much good... And would not stop doing good no matter the consequences"
Malazan,2mz5fb,TriscuitCracker,5,Wed Nov 26 16:31:48 2014 UTC,"Kallor is a very interesting character and I enjoyed his arc the more I learned of him as the series progressed. Whatever a MBotF character's role in the series,  the more page time they get, the deeper you get to know them and understand their motivations. Even characters I actively root against and dislike while reading have reasons for their actions, and it's the explanation and understanding that comes of those actions that makes this book series so epic."
Malazan,2mz5fb,theaggrokrag,6,Fri Nov 21 14:13:31 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I can't put my finger on why but I love to hate Kallor. He's a miserable old fart who gave a big middle finger to meddling Elder gods by committing genocide and I would loooove to see fan art of him sitting alone in his throne smiling smugly at the approaching Elder gods with nothing but charred ash surrounding him for miles around and in the distance you can see the remnants of the Crippled God strewn about. I hate what he did to Whiskeyjack, but I don't hate him the way we all hate a certain character whom OP hasn't read about yet."
Malazan,2mz5fb,Foliagus,3,Fri Nov 21 14:47:53 2014 UTC,"I also think that it is worth pointing out that he was actually fairly upfront about his feelings and intentions towards Silverfox (don't know what everyone was expecting from him, honestly) and considering what he knows, his distrust of her is actually pretty reasonable."
Malazan,2mz5fb,Cazraac,2,Fri Nov 21 16:34:48 2014 UTC,Strange. I too just finished reading it for a second time last night... I think during my reread I've settled on this book as my favorite. I actually shed tears when itkovian smiles at the end.

Malazan,2mz5fb,TisteSimeon,2,Sun Nov 23 17:33:46 2014 UTC,"I have re read the scene to me it just seems people can't understand that I see taking advantage of seriously messed up women is rape. And im aware of her efficiency, but unless the RAFO is that she wanted her sister to get seriously fucked up, she dun goofed a little in this regard"
Malazan,2mz5fb,verheyen,1 point,Sun Nov 23 23:17:17 2014 UTC,"I would argue that felisin got herself fucked up.  She willingly became a whore, and shunted her own bodyguard.

Malazan,2mzir8,frankhorse,4,Fri Nov 21 14:31:45 2014 UTC,"Glad you're liking it! There are many amazing battle scenes in MOI.    Off the subject, How IS the audiobook?

Everybody is going to say this. Just trust us lol you're cheating yourself if you do the summary idea.   I'm sorry you didn't like Midnight Tides. It was my least fave book too, but then I did my first reread and now it's one of my favorites."

As mentioned below, I'll just push through and read it.  I think I'd end up kicking myself in the ass later if I skipped it in any way.  I just really want to get back to Quick Ben, Stormy, Gesler, etc..."

Most people feel the same as you did, lack of interest but it's pretty widely agreed that the book is one of the better of the series. (not to say your opinion is wrong.)  And I would never suggest skipping a book, even if you did read a summary. Reapers Gale especially, while set in the Letheri Empire, it is the direct follow on to the Bonehunters.   And in your way how? The goal of a book series should be the experience of it, not finishing a book series."

That would take away from my enjoyment of the series as a whole.    There was value to Midnight Tides, but it just didn't suck me in as other books like House of Chains or Bonehunters.  I suppose it's just the characters that I'm having a hard time becoming invested in.    I'm going to push through and read it.  I'm sure it's great, or if nothing else, I'll appreciate it after I've read it."

We undersold the book by a bit to be certain that we didn't have to cancel any orders because of damaged copies, etc., so now's your chance to pick one up if you missed it in preorder.    Seeing people asking around frequently on the subreddit for these books, probably the last chance to grab this one if you're interested without having to spend thousands."

Malazan,2mw8i7,flatbird,2,Thu Nov 20 19:28:29 2014 UTC,"'Press Edition' isn't a specific term. It's that the publishing company 'Subterranean Press' has been making really high quality illustrated editions of the series. They only make a small batch of them then never again. People are always looking for copies of the out of print ones, like this one."

Malazan,2mw8i7,erotic_hercules,1 point,Thu Nov 20 19:15:17 2014 UTC,"There was a bit of discussion on this cover when it was released, only thing people really agree on is it certainly took artistic liberties in depicting whatever it is depicting.  First off, that hound is clearly white. But there aren't any Hounds of Light in House of Chains so it can't be one of those. Pretty much has to be one of the Deragoth despite it being the wrong color. Some people say its a similar depection to the other HoC covers, and its Onrack breaking one of the Deragoth statues and releasing one.  I don't really like that explanation at all. Doesn't look like a statue, nor does it look like the hound was trapped inside anything. It's just running from the otherside. Now what it does look like is a whirlwind. Which hey, happens to be a major plot element of this book. So its probably a picture of Karsa literally piercing through The Whirlwind to attack the hound. Which doesn't actually happen in the book, making it a metaphorical picture at best. But that's the best I've got."
Malazan,2mw8i7,erotic_hercules,2,Thu Nov 20 19:32:32 2014 UTC,"could it be that the hound has dark skin/fur? the top of the head is dark and it looks like inside of the whirlwind which its jumping out of is bloody bright, so the reflection makes it look white? Also looks like a flint sword so could narrow it down as well.  What is the picture the glowing sword though? need a memory jog."
Malazan,2mw8i7,NoFortress,3,Fri Nov 21 03:47:18 2014 UTC,Glowing sword picture is Andarist being killed guarding the throne of shadow.

It happens somewhere near the end of the book and I believe he's rescued by his father shortly before getting destroyed by the Deragoth.  Whoever it is certainly looks a bit tattered, but there's no way that's a T'lan Imass. And I always imagined Karsa much... beefier."

Bugg was like ""well, I couldn't use real tea of course, because we don't have any."" Tehol stops drinking and is like ""Well, what am I drinking then?"" And Bugg says, ""I made it with wool"". tehol is offended at first and then asks ""wait, yellow wool or grey wool?"" Bugg answers ""grey"". Then Tehol shrugs and takes another sip.

It's been a while, but I think the portal they were all looking for was a portal to shadow? Something like that anyway, it was in Shadowthrone's interest to keep them away.  2) That's mostly correct, Mappo is charged with keeping Icarium from remembering and trying to keep him from wrecking shit. And he does wreck shit. Doubt might be cast on whether or not certain instances of shit being wrecked were him, but when he gets mad he cleans house. Mappo was never charged with bringing Icarium to the Azath, he was just manipulated towards that end.  You learn more about Mappo and Icarium later on, they have a pretty neat storyline. You'll have to wait for book 4 to get back to them though. I don't think it's a spoiler and I might be wrong, but Fiddler talked to Gothos in Tremorlor, right? I think the only info given on him at that point is that he's a Jaghut, and plenty of quotes from him or his book, ""Gothos' Folly"" are used as chapter openings.  3) He's keeping a low profile, because he doesn't want to end up as bacon.  4) I don't remember.  5) They were looking for Duiker, remember how he sent them to find Heboric in the first place?  6) They would totally leave you hanging like that, but don't worry, this is not one of those times.  We really do get threads like this every week, but I've never gotten to them first before now!"
Malazan,2muedy,Notalec,2,Thu Nov 20 04:21:28 2014 UTC,"Yup. Kalam mentions that he can see the pennants, but can't make out the details, thus he knows someone important is in town but not who. I assume minala could see them more clearly at some point."
Malazan,2muedy,drae-,3,Thu Nov 20 13:37:08 2014 UTC,"1) Did any of the d'ivers and soletaken end up finding the path of hands? And what was shadowthrone (Pust's) purpose in trying to hide it from them?   No they didn't, the beast throne plot has yet to be resolved. Shadowthrone didn't want some crazy insane shape shifter to have all that power.   2) I'm still a bit unclear on Mappo and Icarium's relationship. So we were led to believe Icarium had destroyed civilisations previously, and Mappo was charged with making sure he doesn't remember and bringing him to the azath where he could be trapped forever without repeating the horrible things done in the past, is that correct?   Yeah basically.   Now where did Mappo come from and who sent him to keep an eye on Icarium? And then we find out from Fiddler talking to someone (is it Icarium's dad?) in Tremorlor that it turns out someone else destroyed those civilisations. Who was it? And did Mappo and whoever sent him know about this? If so why was he needed to keep an eye on Icarium in the first place? And why does Icarium keep forgetting things if it turns out there's nothing to forget?   Ok, went and made sure this was all explained in Deadhouse Gates so I'm not spoiling anything. Mappo is a Trell and the last of his race. Long time ago the Trell had pretty much been wiped extinct and only a village of them remained. One day Mappo came back to the village and it was destroyed and everyone dead. He met this group called the Nameless Ones. They are a cult who sort of worship the Azaths and they also keep tabs on Icarium because of his connection with the Azath. They told him Icarium destroyed his village (as he's done many many times over the centuries) and they tasked him with being Icarium's protector of sorts, to keep him from doing it again. They give Mappo a few boons like extended life and his bag of infinite space.  Eventually Mappo gets orders that Icarium is going to be sacrificed to this Azath, and Mappo ends up defying the orders in the end because he's become too close to Icarium and now conciders him his friend. Then they learn from Gothos (Icarium's dad) that it wasn't Icarium that destroyed Mappo's village. It was the Nameless Ones. They just did it so they could convince Mappo to be Icarium's companion, because Icarium's last one killed himself. (Icarium has had many companions assigned by the Nameless Ones over the years) Icarium still destroyed many civilizations, he just didn't happen to actually destroy Mappo's. That's why he's still dangerous and still has those memories.   3) What became of Fener? When Heboric touched that monument it seems the Fener god entered the mortal realm, but then for the rest of the book he doesn't make any appearances.   He was cast down to the mortal realm and lost much of his power. Going to have to keep reading for more.   4) How did Minara know that Lasseen was in Malaz City (although it turns out she wasn't anyway, she was just using a corpse to communicate with Kalam)   Something about recognizing a certain flag pattern on Mock's Hold to be code for The Empress is in town or something I believe.   5) Who were Gesler/stormy/truth looking for at the very end and why?   They were looking for Duiker.   6) No Felisin/Tavore showdown! That was one thing I was looking forward to the entire book! But I assume it must happen in a later book because they wouldn't leave us hanging like this right?   Well, there aren't 8 more books in this series for nothing."
Malazan,2muedy,SageOfTheWise,2,Thu Nov 20 20:54:33 2014 UTC,"I can't answer much without spoiling. No soletaken or d'ivers got through, the azath did some shit to stop them, with the roots and shit.  Shadow got an agent on the inside, but shadow is so weird and shifty.  You've only just met some characters that may span 10 books. Keep reading, you're asking the right questions.  Also, I believe it was assumed that Laseen would be there... Could be wrong on that."

Malazan,2msyh1,TRAIANVS,2,Wed Nov 19 21:02:30 2014 UTC,When did Karsa use his personal warren? I don't recall that. Or is maybe not in the BotF?
Malazan,2msyh1,emolga587,7,Wed Nov 19 23:01:05 2014 UTC,"Somewhere in the series, someone mentions that certain individuals (I think specifically legendary Toblakai) become ""warrens unto themselves"" or something like that, and this may have been caused by an encounter with Karsa himself. And I'm pretty sure that if that instance wasn't inspired by Karsa, then there is at least one other instance where someone remarks that he seems to have a personal warren or something like that."
Malazan,2msyh1,verheyen,3,Wed Nov 19 23:12:59 2014 UTC,"Tool also specifically names ""Thelomen Toblakai"" as a warren in GOTM."
Malazan,2msyh1,LousyAutomaton,3,Thu Nov 20 03:41:39 2014 UTC,"Yeah, but that might be a racial warren (which it would make sense for them to have).  In fact, in this instance I think that it was referring to Bellurdan's warren.  But this doesn't necessarily mean that it was a ""personal"" one, in the sense that I imagine that they have their own unique flavor. Kinda like Dragnipur had its own little section, Mappo's bag was a piece of a warren, and Icarium's arrows were described as each containing a warren."
Malazan,2msyh1,TRAIANVS,1 point,Thu Nov 20 04:12:38 2014 UTC,"Bellurdan, from my reading, had normal access to warrens, but the Tool quote makes its seem the he was powerful enough to become a warren.

Malazan,2msyh1,Aiolus,1 point,Thu Nov 20 00:23:07 2014 UTC,"I thought that his personal warren was also the reason that magic seems to either not effect him or have a much lower effect on him.  Consider when he faces the mages in House of Chains. From his point of view, the  mages just mutter words and seem confident, before he utterly destroys them and shrugs off their castings.  This is seen again when he is captured by the slavers. I don't have the exact quote on hand, but the mage who casts the ""binding"" spells on Karsa remarks that the level of power put into them should have killed him, but Karsa is conscious and able to largely fight off the effects."
Malazan,2msyh1,Tulkaas,5,Thu Nov 20 06:19:23 2014 UTC,The magic invulnerability stems mostly from a lot of exposure to Oataral.
Malazan,2msyh1,mgallowglas,1 point,Thu Nov 20 10:11:47 2014 UTC,"Blood Oil has basically been hinted at being Otataral which kills magic, rubbing it into weapons by hand means rubbing it into skin (eg. Rellik Nom) but Its also stated that some Toblakai, by pure strength of character, are a warren unto themselves. Not quite the whole ""warren being magic through K'rul"" but basically having so much personal power that they cause a warren to... to.. be.. 'themselves'  And the mage who casts the binding basically says his spell (Ruse,I think, or Thyrr) would kill a Denrabi, and it only manages to barely physically subdue Karsa."
Malazan,2msyh1,wheeloficeandfire,4,Sun Nov 23 12:37:16 2014 UTC,He is ascending and he does have some followers so he is pretty close to ascendancy and may not know he's reached it.   Ascendancy is the culmination of ascending. Most of the epic personas are on some level of ascending / earning a mantle / etc.
Malazan,2msyh1,i_am_not_you_or_me,4,Thu Nov 20 03:28:13 2014 UTC,"I agree and think it is important to note that being an ascendant isn't a binary scale of yes or no. Obviously some people are clearly ascendant while others are clearly not. A lot of the characters we meet, however, are somewhere between being an average person and being an ascendant. For example, I think some of the more prominent members of the Bridgeburners were on their way there even before the Tanno song. Definitely Whiskeyjack, Kalam, and Quick. Probably Fiddler also.   So yeah, its not a black and white case. I think Karsa is definitely closer to being an ascendant to not being one, if that makes sense."

Malazan,2msyh1,PromisedPrince694,2,Sun Nov 23 13:13:53 2014 UTC,Think Gaz and Thordy from Toll the Hounds. Not necessary to be an ascendant if you are in the Deck. But it probably does help.

Malazan,2moic8,pale_of_frost,11,Tue Nov 18 17:18:42 2014 UTC,"Hello! Hope you enjoyed the read! Lemmie answer your questions as best as I can. I myself am only on book 3 but I may be able to help. Also I think some answers to your question might also simply include some 'read on and find out' material (ROFO)  Q.1 This was actually discussed between Whiskeykack, his squad and Onearm. You may want to go back and read that, I believe it takes place in one of the last chapters. To summarize; Yes they're breaking off from the empire, however Onearm is aware that a greater foe lies ahead; The Pannion seer and his Domin. Everyone was aware off the convergence which was going to inevitably take place in Darujhistan. This means chaos and confusion between who is on whose side. The plan was for The squad to blow some intersections, meanwhile rake is descending into the city, the Jaghut tyrant is on his way, and Lorn is in the city, At this point you can imagine, the lines between enemy and foe are quite blurred for the players involved, and especially the Daru people. This means that Dujek can march into Darujhistan, now outlawed by the empire, bring back order and peace, and make it obvious that the second army has come to help and restore the city. With the real rulers gone, and the second army reorganizing the huge mess they were partially responsible for (something which the daru people would not know) The second army would gain the favour of the people and be able to use Darujhistan to supply them with resources and act as a base for the upcoming war with the Pannion Domin.   Basically they needed to have a purpose in Darujhistan to be able to use it to fund their war efforts, ending the cabal and blowing the intersections would give them a role within the city to restore order, obviously the citizens and officials would be fed some lies about the whole story and would never find out that it was one of the Seconds squads which blew the intersections.  Q.2 After having his sword chance absorb one of the lances of energy flung by the Jaghut tyrant, Paran is somehow connected to the jaghut, his finnest and the azath, and is hence hurled into a strange marsh world which I'm assuming is the/a warren of the house of Azath.   Well anyways, Paran finds himself in this warren and See's Tool fighting the finest (The oak-fleshed jaghut figure). Tool however is being forced back and eventually asks Paran to help him defend the Azath. The azath is trying to capture the finnest, however it is currently to strong to imprisoned. The finnest attacks Paran, and he tries to raise his sword Chance to deflect the attack, however with no success, and ends up being wounded, (I believe).  Being jaghut, the Tyrant used his Omtose Phellack warren to attack, which unleashed the hounds blood found within Paran. You see I beleive Paran and the hound have formed a sort of connection, after Paran managed to Injure a hound, is then attack by it, and then touches its blood. all of these events have been starting to form a bond.  So, The hound is released and Paran goes into a primal frenzy and starts to batter and shred the Finest, only to be stopped by tool as he makes him aware that The azath still intend on imprisoning the Finnest now that it is weakened.  Once paran is back into the physical world, Paran finds himself in the shadow warre and one of The Hounds  attacks Paran, only to finally leave him alone as it is confused as it feels the presence of another hound within paran and senses kinship. ( I think its the hound gear that Paran is linked with if im not mistaken).   Q.3 I think it had to do with instinct, though Im not sure. Also he didnt really free them, we dont know where they whent. he sent them to the origin of the chains which bind the prisoners of Dragnipur to the huge Cart.  Q.4 From what ive understood, The Gods have their own agenda. I dont think we're meant to understand the plans of The Gods involved at this point, so early in the story. I think it will slowly unravel itself as we read on. From what Ive understood Oppon has its own plans and was using Paran and Crokus as their players/chess figures on the field.   Paran realized that he was being used pretty early on and was pretty pessimistic yet compliant at first, until he got fed up and decided to take things in his own hands, starting off with nearly getting Oppon devoured by the hounds. This was followed by him acting upon the advice given to him ""when your luck begins to turn/fail you (I'm paraphrasing here) break the sword or give it to your worst enemy"" -Advice given him by Anomander Rake. Paran decided that his worst enemy is Oppon who blatantly used him. Knowing that Cotillion is a god/ascendant and has the opportunity to wreck Oppons shit if given a tool, Paran decides that Cotillion would make the best use out of the sword to screw with Oppon. This turns out to be a quite accurate assumption as Oppon later in the chapter visits Paran in distress demanding why he had done so. (thank you u/MoranthMunitions for that edit!)  Sorry for the lengthy reply, but I hope it helped clear some things up! Although when things get cleared up in MbotF it tends to raise more questions than answer haha."
Malazan,2moic8,HumbleAsFudge,5,Tue Nov 18 19:24:07 2014 UTC,"This was followed by him acting upon the advice given to him ""when your luck begins to turn/fail you ... Hence Paran decided to give it up to Cotilion upon his request. Which has several implications. Foremost, Its Ironic because he was told to give it to his worst enemy, implying that the next possessor of the sword (Cotillion) is not going to have a good time.   It was Rake who told him that after he left Dragnipur, but you entirely misread the situation with Cotillion. He knew what Chance was, the two of them talked about it, Paran earlier reflected on Rake's words and decided that Oponn were his worst enemy, though he couldn't give them the sword (there was some memory of his tutor saying that the gods pretty much screw up mortal's lives). So later when Paran is in Shadow, talking with Cotillion:   Paran looked down at the weapon. 'It's yours, if you want it.' 'Ah.' Cotillion smiled, stepping over to pick it up. 'I'd suspected a change of heart, Captain. The world is so complex, isn't it? Tell me, do you pity the ones who used you?'   He is actually giving another god something that Oponn are connected to due to the duality of the relationships between people/objects/gods etc. which means Cotillion can do lots of bad things to them using it.  Also, Oponn's plans were literally to just mess up other peoples' plans."

Malazan,2moic8,Foliagus,2,Tue Nov 18 21:41:38 2014 UTC,"Thank you, I am humbled, however much of my precision simply comes from the fact that i finished GoTM 2 days ago. You see 1 year ago I had read up to book 3 and a bit. However Due to laziness among other things, I had a pause and ended up not reading for a good 6-8 months.  So I basically forgot to much to be able to simply pick up book 3 again. So I decided to start from new again, people say the re-reads are better and its just mind blowingly insane how true it is. Imagine that, the only superior knowledge i had when re reading the first book was my left over memories and scrap understanding of the world given to me by having read book 1, 2 and a bit of 3. And yet with that little extra info, GoTM became extremely enjoyable! To put it into perspective, Ima n extremely slow reader, it took me more than 2 months on my first go to complete GoTM, now I have been starting to be more consistent and I finished it in 3 weeks. God that was a good read! At this point I just use any free time in school to read the series, my friends must think im some sot of fantasy junky. I try to explain to them why the series is so great, but they either dont read at all or dont read fantasy :(  But I have hope that one day I will have my own convertee :)  So yeah, started DHG yesterday, and gonna got to bed now to read some more!

Malazan,2moic8,HumbleAsFudge,1 point,Tue Nov 18 23:03:41 2014 UTC,"Thanks for that!  The whole Paran-finnest fight was kind of a mindfuck for me, he was like teleporting in and out of here.  I didn't understand how Kruppe managed to trap the Tyrant in his dream but I'm okay with that as I'm guessing at this point there is much about Kruppe that I don't yet know.  I find it odd that Kalam intervened to save Derudan from the Jaghut posessing Mammot, when they had already asked Vorcan to kill her and the other mages.  And with Paran giving the sword thing, I interpreted it as him giving it to Cotillion because Cotillion was his worst enemy."
Malazan,2moic8,Foliagus,3,Wed Nov 19 05:28:42 2014 UTC,"They didn't want to wreck Darujhistan, in fact he called it off.  You're missing that they decided to fully go against the empire only after substantial evidence later in the book.  It was never fully ""oh we're going to fuck Lasseen now."", Whiskeyjack attempted to believe things would work out much later than other soldiers did.  Paran was never possessed, he had a sword that was aspected of an ascendant.  There's some trippy stuff involving the finnest, it all gets explained in later books, and Paran's role in the greater scheme as well.  He's living up to a strange destiny when he fights the Jaghut Tyrant.  Jaghut is a race, the Tyrant is exactly what you think it means, an individual seeking to dominate and rule others. Jaghuts weren't usually tyrants, but the few that were, were powerful indeed.  Even he wondered why he freed them.  Maybe he felt dispair that such magnificent beings were stuck in that place, he had a moment of compassion even for things that he didn't agree with.  Truly a good guy.  Oponn tried to use Paran, through that sword.  Anomander Rake fully explained it to him, and Paran made the choice of not being used anymore.  He even used the sword itself to bring them to a terrible place, to make them give him a favor.  He then pointed out something to them that you see later in the series.  By giving him that sword, they relinquished some control over their own fate, and risked a lot by dealing with a mortal.  Gods may be super powerful beings, but there are also ways mortals can fight against them.  You see this often, throughout the series as well."

Heborics deal made me confused as hell too, but these explanations make it a lot more sense.   Glad you liked it! Mappo made me cry too. I would read the shit out of a series of books with just him and Icarium tooling around the world. Fave books? Fave characters? Fave parts? Will you be doing a reread? I'd recommend Esselmonts books for lots of nice backstory and of course Forge of Darkness (which if you read before rereading Malazan main series really clarifies a lot of stuff) and the Baichelin and Korbal Broach novellasz"

It would break me and I don't have the luxury of forgetting. The end where Icarium looks at the broken pots and says that he's remembered something will just stick in my mind. And ""My friend, I am so sorry.""   My favourite book in the series is Memories of Ice. Second would probably be tie between The Bonehunters and Midnight Tides.  Fav characters. Tough one. I really like the Bonehunters. I'd say Bottle, Ganoes Paran, Kalam Mekhar and Trull Sengar. I also really like Tavore and Hood. To be honest, all of the Jaghut. Even Raest was such a sweetheart with the cat. A big change from the bloodthirsty tyrant who wanted to blow up Darujhistan. Stormy and Gesler too. The characters that made me rage - The Errant and that member of the secret police in Letheras who kept raping Janath, I forget his name.  I will definitely do a reread but only after I read the ICE novels. I'm excited to read about the Crimson Guard. From what we read of them in the main series, they are quite amazing! I'm going to read everything set in the Malazan world but not right now. I have a few other series that I am going to read first. Gentleman Bastards, Prince of Nothing, Broken Empire, First Law, Stormlight Archives."
Malazan,2mkbj1,HustSword,1 point,Mon Nov 17 19:14:38 2014 UTC,The ICE novels are great and add a lot IMO. I'd recommend reading the in their correct spots in the series for maximum effect.
Malazan,2mkbj1,gathmoon,1 point,Fri Nov 21 14:40:29 2014 UTC,I caught the Tavore Talon connection on my re read as well. The number of clues that are given to us about future events are all there just masked in such a way that most are glossed right over. Part of what I love about this series!
Malazan,2mkbj1,HustSword,1 point,Tue Nov 18 14:46:58 2014 UTC,READ EVERYTHING IN THE MALAZAN UNIVERSE. Haha. I'm so with you on that point and have just started a complete reread of both the SE and ICE novels.
Malazan,2mkbj1,SageOfTheWise,8,Fri Nov 21 14:38:52 2014 UTC,"The Forkrul Assail ally themselves with the K'Chain Nah'ruk and the Tiste Liosan. How they do this, I'm not entirely sure.    Well, they did it by talking. In DoD the Shake run into a Forkrul Assail in Kurald Thyrlan, which is the first hint they've allied with the Liosan. They also allied with the Wolf Gods. I don't think they really allied with the Nah'ruk, they said it was more like they used them. Like Nah'ruk didn't care about the Crippled God, just the Che'malle.   The question I don't know the answer to is whether she was working for or working with Shadowthrone and Cotillion.    I'd say with. There are many parts of the book with Shadowthrone expressing great frustration that he has no idea what Tavore is up to or how she plans to achieve whatever she's doing, which doesn't really imply she's going on his orders or anything.   Heboric SOMEHOW manages to chain Korabas with the aid of The Crippled God.   The point of Heboric was he was basically a conduit between The Crippled God and Korabas. Since Deadhouse Gates he's been affected by the Otateral (Korabas) in one hand, and Jade (The Crippled God) in the other."
Malazan,2mkbj1,SageOfTheWise,3,Mon Nov 17 15:56:54 2014 UTC,Thanks for clearing that up. I was quite confused by the Heboric stuff in TCG. Who released his soul though? Wasn't he dead?
Malazan,2mkbj1,MoranthMunitions,5,Mon Nov 17 16:01:44 2014 UTC,"Ok, so first he was killed in TBH and his soul went to Hood. Paran made a deal with Hood to release his soul back to his body to deal with the Jade Spires that were coming down in the end of TBH. Right after that his body sank into the sea. Which means Mael now has him. Mael brings Heboric into this whole deal. There's a scene in the beginning of either DoD or TCG where Mael is talking to K'rul about some stuff and he's dragging a body with him. That body is Heboric."
Malazan,2mkbj1,MoranthMunitions,2,Mon Nov 17 16:20:37 2014 UTC,"OH! That is whose body it is! I should have caught that. I don't remember Paran making a deal with Hood but I'll take your word for it, tBH was a long time ago."
Malazan,2mkbj1,thekuch1144,1 point,Mon Nov 17 16:52:34 2014 UTC,"It was a fairly important plot point, as Paran had to promise to do something for Hood. Anyway, because I had a couple of spare minutes and ebooks on hand:   ‘Oh, be quiet, Hood,’ Paran hissed, trying to climb to his feet, then stopping when he realized that doing so would not be a good idea. ‘Help me. Us. Stop what’s coming – it’ll destroy—’ ‘Far too much, yes. Too many plans. I can do little, however. You have sought out the wrong god.’ ‘I know. I was trying for Mael.’ ‘Pointless ...’ Yet, even as Hood spoke that word, Paran detected a certain ... hesitation. Ah, you’ve had a thought. ‘I have. Very well, Ganoes Paran, bargain.’ ‘Abyss take us – there’s no time for that!’ ‘Think quickly, then.’ ‘What do you want? More than anything else, Hood. What do you want?’ And so Hood told him. And, among the corpses, limbs and staring faces in the gate, one face in particular suddenly grew animate, its eyes opening very wide – a detail neither noticed. Paran stared at the god, disbelieving. ‘You can’t be serious.’ ‘Death is always serious.’ ‘Oh, enough with the portentous crap! Are you certain?’ ‘Can you achieve what I ask, Ganoes Paran?’ ‘I will. Somehow.’ ‘Do you so vow?’ ‘I do.’ ‘Very well. Leave here. I must open this gate.’ ‘What? It is open!’ But the god had turned away, and Paran barely heard Hood’s reply: ‘Not from this side.’   And another quote about it.   ‘That’s better. Anyway, I know who saved us.’ ‘Really?’ ‘Well, sort of – he started the big rock rolling, at least.’ ‘Who?’ ‘Ganoes Paran.’ Kalam scowled. ‘All right, I’m less surprised than I should be.’ ‘Then you’re an idiot. He did it by having a conversation with Hood.’ ‘How do you know?’ ‘I was there, listening in. At Hood’s Gate.’ ‘What were you doing hanging around there?’ ‘We were all going to die, weren’t we?’ ‘Oh, so you wanted to beat the rush?’ ‘Hilarious, Kalam. No, I was planning on doing some bargaining, but that’s irrelevant now. Ended up, it was Paran who did the bargaining. Hood said something. He wants something – by his own damned breath, it shocked me, let me tell you—’   Anyway, they're both from Chapter Twenty, pretty much Hood didn't want to be the god of death any more.  The fourteen Jaghut I presume were part of the war on death, which will possibly be featured during the second book of the Kharkandas Trilogy, I can't remember the last word I saw on that from an interview with Erikson. In any case the call went out in FoD for participants and IIRC some of the memories that Ublala Pung has from his armour/club are from that war too.   Was it all planned? In order to feed the heart of The Crippled God? By Shadowthrone and Cotillion?   Pretty much, that's kind of why Karsa was the Knight of Chains, like a lot of the planning appears to be set out from the start while other parts adapt from what's happening, but killing lots of people to make Fener manifest, then killing him to give power to the heart seems like it was part of the plan for a while.  Also I solidly laughed at your bit about Silchas Ruin having a BFF, congrats on finishing the main series."
Malazan,2mkbj1,CaptainUnusual,1 point,Mon Nov 17 22:01:07 2014 UTC,"Oh! I remember the bit about the eyes and the face being Quick Ben eavesdropping. I focused more on that than on what happened when I read the chapter. So Hood releases Heboric's soul. Heboric embraces the souls of the followers of the Crippled God. But what Hood asked for in return was what, exactly? Aid with Shadowthrone's and Rake's plan to get Hood and some souls into Dragnipur?"
Malazan,2mkbj1,drae-,3,Mon Nov 17 22:10:53 2014 UTC,He asked to no longer be the god of death. That's why the Bridgeburners took over the role and Deadsmell no longer controlled dead things because Hood's aspect reverted back to ice. Part of achieving that was getting killed by Rake (wielding Dragnipur).
Malazan,2mkbj1,CaptainUnusual,1 point,Mon Nov 17 23:22:01 2014 UTC,"Completely missed this.  Well, I completely missed a lot as I just finished my first read through.  What a series"
Malazan,2mlxvt,PromisedPrince694,8,Mon Nov 17 23:24:44 2014 UTC,It is an inside joke. And Laseen did get it. Most of the old guard that 'drowned' were from The Napan Islands and all ship captains and excellent swimmers. So drowning is the last way they'd ever die.
Malazan,2mlxvt,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Tue Nov 18 01:44:24 2014 UTC,Oh! So I did get it. Thanks I thought that there would be something deeper to it
Malazan,2mlxvt,StormyGesler,6,Tue Nov 18 09:58:34 2014 UTC,"I think it's just an inside joke, they are both admirals and it's said somewhere that they are excellent swimmers. I think its just Laseen's inability to kill off most of the old guard, such as Daseem, Temper, Toc the Elder etc etc. I think that for Laseen it's best if the general population just assumes that the old guard are actually dead so they wont rise up against her."
Malazan,2mlxvt,Notalec,1 point,Tue Nov 18 00:09:43 2014 UTC,Toc the Elder    so they wont rise up against her   That came back to bite her in the ass.

Malazan,2mkc0p,stockyard_stoic,3,Mon Nov 17 15:22:30 2014 UTC,They did know each other. It would make a sort of sense for Fiddler to be Whiskey Jacks apprentice in both masonry and war.   There was also some mention of hoods mason. Just woke up so can't think terribly.   Edit: word
Malazan,2mkc0p,Aiolus,1 point,Mon Nov 17 15:36:01 2014 UTC,"It would make a sort of sense for Fiddler to be Whiskey Jacks apprentice in both masonry and war.   I like this. I was going to mention something about Whiskeyjack being Hood's mason, but I can't really remember the context of that particular arrangement."
Malazan,2mkc0p,Ezzelino,2,Mon Nov 17 15:47:52 2014 UTC,"In GotM hood has a mason (I think it was the mason at least). He meets Oppon at hoods gate when they drag Ganoes back. Hood did have his eyes on Whiskeyjack since before Gardens, so who knows?  On the other hand, Bellurdan is depicted as the mason before he kills tattersail, and hedge is named the mason in DoD."
Malazan,2mkc0p,SageOfTheWise,4,Mon Nov 17 21:32:24 2014 UTC,Fiddler wand Whiskeyjack were old friends before they joined the army. Together they stole Whiskyjack's half sister Dunsparrow from the Temple of Hood together.
Malazan,2mkc0p,Jester814,5,Mon Nov 17 15:39:26 2014 UTC,Together they stole Whiskyjack's half sister Dunsparrow from the Temple of Hood together.   Yes but did they do it together?
Malazan,2mkc0p,SageOfTheWise,5,Mon Nov 17 21:50:34 2014 UTC,Yes. Fiddler is the one to tell us the story about how they did it.

Malazan,2mkc0p,Ezzelino,4,Tue Nov 18 03:59:53 2014 UTC,"In GotM fiddler says that he learnt masonry breaking into barrows, then comments that whiskeyjack was one too so I doubt that fiddler was his apprentice."
Malazan,2mkc0p,Ezzelino,1 point,Mon Nov 17 21:36:45 2014 UTC,"Ah, there's the catch. I didn't remember that it was Fiddler that mentioned Whiskeyjack being a mason. I'm not sure that rules out my theory entirely, but I also don't remember the story about rescuing Dunsparrow at all, so I might be assuming too much here.  Although, Fiddler learning masonry from breaking into barrows is interesting given the Bridgeburner's relationship with Hood."
Malazan,2mkc0p,citizen_mane,1 point,Mon Nov 17 21:47:47 2014 UTC,I assumed dunsparrows rescue took place when they were much older. Dunsparrow would be in her 30s-40s while whiskeyjack is in his 50s.
Malazan,2mkc0p,montaron87td,2,Mon Nov 17 23:41:48 2014 UTC,"I have a feeling this might get discredited later on. I'm trying to reconcile the age differences.   In the same conversation Gesler comments that apprentices are usually 10 years old. So Whiskeyjack would have known Fiddler when he was a child. Aging in the series is a touchy issue so I don't think I'll ever to be able to figure out for sure one way or the other, but the idea is so appealing to me that I'll probably just treat it as true. It's just one of those little details that seems to fit."
Malazan,2mkc0p,Priest_of_Aroo,2,Mon Nov 17 16:22:57 2014 UTC,"I think you might be on to something — looking at the GotM prologue, the age difference between Whiskeyjack and Fiddler could be that of a mason and his apprentice.  Whiskeyjack's young-ish, and Fiddler's only a teenager.   Description of Whiskeyjack: ""Finally the man faced him. His face was scarred, and something that might have been a burn marred his jaw and left cheek. For all that, he looked young for a commander.""  Description of Fiddler: ""Another Bridgeburner, this one with a broken, scorched fiddle strapped to his back, came up to the commander. He was wiry and if anything younger-only a few years older than Ganoes himself, who was twelve..."""
Malazan,2mkc0p,Montaron87,1 point,Mon Nov 17 16:42:17 2014 UTC,"Yes! I also like it as an explanation about why Fiddler did not get his name until Raraku. If Whiskeyjack knew Fid since he was 10, it might make more sense for his commander to call him by his real name. But at this point I'm basically writing fanfiction. Probably inaccurate fanfiction."
Malazan,2mkc0p,TygettLannister,2,Mon Nov 17 21:18:59 2014 UTC,Whiskeyjack is supposed to be very old right? Like kept young by the Deadhouse.   I think they didn't know each other before the army.
Malazan,2mjkg3,Killuminati620,5,Mon Nov 17 08:11:35 2014 UTC,"I did pretty much the same as you, and dragged out The Crippled God as long as I could. I finished a few weeks ago, but in the end I was so incredibly satisfied that I didn't feel as bereft as I thought I would. It's an absolutely incredible series and the ending lives up to everything it built towards. Enjoy."
Malazan,2mjkg3,harnagarna,1 point,Mon Nov 17 08:46:27 2014 UTC,"My roommate likes to torment me by picking up tCG every now and then and flipping to the last page and then looking at me. I told him if he tells me anything I'm moving out. But I'm happy that it has a satisfying ending. I wasn't really worried about Erikson being able to wrap everything up in a good way, but you never know. So that puts me more at ease."
Malazan,2mjkg3,Notalec,6,Mon Nov 17 17:52:07 2014 UTC,"Suddenly, other books just don't cut it. The ICE books will get you your fix for a while, some people are down on them but I liked them a lot; only problem was him using ""Talian"" rather than ""Malazan"" to refer to the language they were speaking, which threw me out of the story sometimes.  After that you'll maybe try some other fantasy books, maybe you'll read (or re-read as the case may be) ASoIaF, or WoT, or Name of the Wind/Wise Man's Fear, or the Black Company, etc., I did a long stint of Terry Pratchett myself (if you want suggestions, ask. Please ask). Eventually though you get to the point where you've forgot enough that you can reread them!  During my first reread, I realized how often characters got things wrong, or just flat out lied, and I got better at reading between the lines.  During my second reread, I realized how much Erikson likes the word ""bemused"".  And that's where I'm at now - working on my first reread of the ICE books. Poorly timed with the release of Assail, but I'll get there pretty soon. Then I get to reread Forge of Darkness (confusing as fuck the first time through, even after having read the main 10 twice), and hopefully that won't be too far off of the release of Fall of Light!  Then Pratchett's newest book if it's in paperback. Then I might reread Wheel of Time, but probably not. I got maybe 5 or 6 books into The Horus Heresy, so I might pick that up again. If Hell freezes over maybe Butcher or Rothfuss or Martin will be done with their next books by then.  Then I'll be back to browsing bookshelves for a bit, and if I'm lucky I'll end up finding a new author or two to like, so that after I eventually reread Malazan for the third time I'll have more books to fill the space before the fourth!"

The name of the language is going to depend on who's PoV you're in. Someone from Quon Tali is going to know its Talian. Someone from Lether or Seven Cities just knows its what the Malazan's speak. So they call it Malazan."
Malazan,2mjkg3,thewreckinball,3,Mon Nov 17 15:58:36 2014 UTC,It's 'Erikson' man. Fuck sake.
Malazan,2mjkg3,TriscuitCracker,2,Mon Nov 17 11:31:25 2014 UTC,"I completely agree. I'm in the middle of my first re-read after 8 months and it's almost like a whole new experience and utterly enjoyable and there is SO much you don't catch reading it the first time.   Also how much Erikson uses the phrase ""boiled leather"" lol   I've read tons of other fantasy, and even old faves like ASOIAF and Mistborn, First Law, Thomas Covenant, Moorecock, I've read a dozen times etc are just a tiny bit diminished now that I've had Malazan raise the bar on me.   I've never read Wheel of Time though. I'm kind of afraid to, it seems like a kind of series where 17 year old me would love it, but 37 year old me who's read a lot of fantasy it will be jaded. Heard it's pretty old school but great world building. I'll give it a shot because I gave Malazan a chance and that's hard as heck to get into at first. But ultimately so rewarding."
Malazan,2mjkg3,HustSword,1 point,Mon Nov 17 19:00:01 2014 UTC,"I did WoT before I did MBotF, and as much as I loved it, it's more of a LotR style epic fantasy rather than ASOIAF/MBotF.   I'd highly recommend WoT though, just know it's not the raw and gritty epic fantasy style of Erikson and Esselmont's world."
Malazan,2mjkg3,Hubbell,1 point,Fri Nov 21 14:52:48 2014 UTC,"I'm actually working my way through a casual re-read of WoT as a way of prolonging the ending of the Malazan books. It's even better the second time around because you can see how Jordan had a plan from the beginning, but my god I hate Egwene. It seems like as soon as she goes to the White Tower she instantly becomes the most annoying character ever. Nynaeve is also pretty bad, all the braid tugging and sniffing. But I still love it.   I haven't read much Pratchett, which is bad I know. I intend to correct that in the near future. I read Good Omens a couple of years ago and that was fantastic."
Malazan,2mjkg3,HustSword,2,Mon Nov 17 17:56:39 2014 UTC,"If I ever see a girl with a braid tug it I might backhand them out of my repressed hatred of Nynaeve.  God did I hate her.

I've got 4 rereads of BotF, 2 of Erikson's stuff, 3 WoT's, and 2 each on the aforementioned series just waiting on more books to come out.  BotF is definitely my favorite because the characters actually feel real and all the realistic comedic moments like when Gesler waves to a dragon, Gesler and Stormy's back and forths (I used to be a construction worker and their conversations were spot on with the kind we'd have on jobsites)."

Malazan,2mgukw,NYANHODOR,8,Sun Nov 16 14:49:00 2014 UTC,"There is not a collected version of the first few books, unfortunately. There is a collected ebook of all 10 main series books, but honestly I recommend you read the physical books to start with, as they look good on a shelf, and they are easier to flip through back and forth through the glossary and Dramatis personae and maps, which are required for this complex series. Just to give you an idea what you're in for, I've posted the following many times and I feel it applies here.   In this world, there are many, many different races, sub races, traditions, ethnicities, nations, and magic systems, and you're going to be bombarded and it's highly intimidating initially. Do not worry, we all felt this way.  Imagine it's like you've found a historians book and he has written it the way he has because he understands the terms and jargon and definitions of that time and you have to piece together what things mean by context and clues. It's part of the fun of Malazan. There are many, many moments where you will go ""Ah HAH!"" and ""Oooooooh!"" as you piece together different plots and characters from within the book as well as between books.  Gardens of the Moon, the first book is generally considered to be the hardest book to get into in the series. It's not bad by any means but Erickson wrote it nine years before starting the rest of the series and it was his first novel and it shows sometimes. Just stick with it.  The maps and character list in the front and the glossary in the back of the book are your friends. Especially the glossary. This enables you to keep track of things when you're feeling a bit lost or can't remember what's what.   Just dive in and just stick with it and let yourself be enveloped. You'll probably feel like you got dropped into a foreign country with no dictionary and no sense of history of the place and who the heck are all these people!? This is normal! Erickson does not do infodumps and can be heavy on the introspective philosophy. Every chapter you read uncovers a bit more of the Malazan world. Every book starts off with a lot of character development, history of the place they are in, geography, important events, etc. Each book is usually 3/4 buildup/plot and the last quarter is where the ""Convergence"" happens ie: crazy epic action/drama/weepiness/exhilaration.  You'll switch books and sometimes be on an entirely different continent with new characters and situations.  In Book 6 it all starts to come together and all the subplots and main plots weave together through the remaining books to culminate in the Crippled God.  The series is wonderful, amazing, crying into the books good. Its even better on a reread. It's also intimidating as hell. No shame if you put Gardens of the Moon down halfway through with a ""I have no freaking clue what is going on"" feeling. But if you stick with it, and you like it, you'll never look at other fantasy the same way again. It's that phenomenal. Read at least through book 2 or 3. Deadhouse Gates got me truly hooked, but Memories of Ice was the one that made me say, ""Okay, I'm going to be rereading this for the rest of my life and this gets a permanent place on my bookshelves at eye level, and now I'm off to find the hardcovers even though I already have all the mass market/ebooks.""  Sorry if I sound like a fanboy gushing, but I found it to be just that amazing. Welcome to the sub! Ask any questions and post your impressions and if you end up not liking it, no shame at all. No book is for everyone! It is an amazing series lore wise. You could debate about it and go deep into the little details forever. Erickson is an archeologist and an anthropologist and it really shows in his literature."

Malazan,2mh9qi,end_O_the_world_box,3,Sun Nov 16 17:44:47 2014 UTC,"Well, what was Hairlock doing immediately before being killed? He was busy going crazy and wanting ultimate power. He originally was supposed to be working for Quick Ben and uncovering the conspiracy for him, but the chaos power drove him insane pretty quickly and he became a villain basically.  It's just under Malazan rule now. They installed their own people to the government, set up new laws, etc. No Imass in the seed. I'm blanking on how Kruppe's dream was related to this all, you'll have to remind me. Basically there's a thing in the world called Azaths that react to too much power gathering and one place and try to swallow it up basically to lock it away. You'll learn a lot more about them in the series, its one of the main focuses of the series. Caladan Brood is a really old Ascendant who's like best friends with Rake. He doesn't have any official connections with the Crimson Guard, but him, the Crimson Guard, and the Rhivi are all allied against the Malazan empire. The Crimson Guard are run by K'azz D'Avore. K'rul did it basically. Rhivi are just humans I think. Like tribes people. Barghast are human looking, but like really big and brutish. Like how comic book artists in the 80's thought people looked like."
Malazan,2mh9qi,SageOfTheWise,3,Sun Nov 16 18:18:51 2014 UTC,"Thanks so much! I'm super lost on everything that happened with the jaghut tyrant at the end, but Raest showed up at the party, then Paran and Raest are inside the seed, and there's a house growing, and then Raest isn't quite dead, so he ends up in Kruppe's dream, where he can actually be killed. That's pretty much what I got of it."
Malazan,2mh9qi,Therrester,5,Sun Nov 16 18:34:30 2014 UTC,"You have a bit of the timeline confused, so I'll do my best to explain without spoiling too much.  What happens is that Lorn and Tool went and released Reast, the Jaghut tyrant from his barrow. Reast, while powerful, doesn't have his full power, which is locked away in the seed (which I believe is also called a Finnest. My spelling on that is probably totally off). So in order to retrieve his power, he sets off for the Daru city.  Everyone know Reast will destroy the city. So initially, a bunch of dragons go and fight him on one of the hill out-skirting the city. At the end of this fight, Kruppe, a powerful and mysterious citizen of the city, is sleeping in the kitchen of the fete. With the help of K'rul, he traps Reast in his dream, where he can be contained permanently.   However, Reast ended up escaping the dream by taking over Crokus' uncle's body. The reason as to how this happened escapes me, but now Reast in the garden where the fete is being hosted. Coincidentally, his Finnest, which contains his power, was buried in the ground under the shape of an acorn. This seed then manifested itself as an Azath.  Like /u/SageOfTheWise explained, Azath's react to power gatherings. The Azath, manifested within the acorn, grew into a small house which then reached out and trapped Reast within it, ending his terror."
Malazan,2mh9qi,Therrester,2,Sun Nov 16 21:13:28 2014 UTC,Thank you so much! This really helps a lot. I'm pretty sure that there was also something to do with the T'lan Imass in the final battle with Raest. Wasn't there some Imass clan that was rising/returning and helped in the fight against Raest?
Malazan,2mh9qi,LegSpinner,3,Sun Nov 16 23:20:35 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately, I don't recall any T'lan Imass rising to help with the fight. I even checked the character list in my copy and the names of the Imass didn't ring any bells. Sorry"

Malazan,2mfpy5,PromisedPrince694,10,Sun Nov 16 03:20:10 2014 UTC,"(spoilers Midnight Tides)  My favorite Trull scene on my first reread of Midnight Tides. Wonderful action scene before hand, and Erickson totally makes me believe Trull is lost, alone, fighting for his life, and hopeless. Makes me freaking cry knowing what this poor family and Trull will be going through. All he wants is his family to be all right.   ""He was lying motionless, the snow slowly covering him, whilst his mind ran on and on, fleeing this lie, this empty world that was not empty, this thick whiteness that exploded into motion and colour again and again.  Attackers, appearing out of the darkness and blowing snow. Moments of frenzied fighting, sparks and the hiss of iron and the bite of wood and stone. A succession of ambushes that seemed without end, convincing Trull that he was indeed within a nightmare, ever folding in on itself.  Each time, the Jheck appeared in threes, never more, and the Hiroth warrior began to believe that they were the same three, dying only to rise once again-and so it would continue, until they finally succeded, until they killed him.  Yet he fought on, leaving blood and bodies in his wake.  Running, snow crunching underfoot.  And then the wind fell off, sudden like a spent breath.  Patches of dark ground ahead. An unseen barrier burst across, the lurid glare of a setting sun to his right, the languid flow of cool, damp air, the smell of mud.  And shouts. Figures off to his left, half a thousand paces distant.  Brothers of the hearth, the dead welcoming his arrival.  Gladness welling in his heart, Trull staggered towards them. He was not to be a ghost, wandering forever alone, then.  There would be kin at his side. Fear, and Binadas. And Rhulad.  Midik Buhn, and Theradas, rushing towards him.  Brothers, all of them. My brothers-  The sun's light wavered, rippled like water, then darkness rose up in a devouring flood."""

Malazan,2mfsea,AllWrong74,3,Sun Nov 16 14:51:02 2014 UTC,"Power in the Malazan world gets a boost from unpredictability in how it'd be used. How do you plan against what you don't know what is there and where it's coming from?   So once it is known how the power is being used (and how much), it can be planned against and countered directly, indirectly, individually, with a team or whatever other options there are to the imagination.  The magic systems do have certain themes to them - darkness will obscure and hide, light will burn, the earth will move and reshape. However, some of this is manipulatable by the magic user themselves - can they imagine the magic taking on this shape, form it that way and hold it for the length of time it takes?  Gods are usually strong. Not all gods are equal though. In addition, take into your scheme of things that when the gods choose to form connections to the mortals, the connections are two way and are usually made known to other beings.  Kruppe's dream is a very strange place where the rules bend and break.   Fiddler and Kalam know that Sorry wasn't Sorry the Scary Assassin Who Could Kill Everyone from the get go. So when she isn't that anymore, isn't it the right thing to deliver a young girl home?"
Malazan,2mfsea,Udinaas,3,Sun Nov 16 05:34:42 2014 UTC,"I mean, you kind of did map out what's stronger than others in your question. I mean first off, a lot of this stuff is coming from the opinions of humans, the weakest of basically everything. So everything just seems unbeatable to them generally. But yeah, no one can kill a T'lan Imass because they're undead. What you would do is tear one apart limb from limb or something so it can never function again. They've had thousands of years of fighting experience though so good luck. Otateral isn't really on a power scale, it's just a anti magic material, simple enough. Again, 'no one' can kill the Tyrant because we're talking about humans. He also outclasses a single T'lan, which makes sense. The T'lan pretty much live (no pun intended) to kill Jaghut, but they do that with their superior numbers, not by being 1 on 1. And also, from the beginning its stated that Rake can kill the Jaghut Tyrant. That was the point. They release the Tyrant, Rake kills it, but has now used too much power and is too weak to defend the city. I'm blanking on god like demons in bottles. Do you mean the demon Pearl? He was sent on an immediate suicide mission against Rake just to stall for time. Not exactly god like.   Well, each warren of magic tends to have its rules and limits of what can be done, but there's lots of different warrens people could be drawing from that you'll keep learning about as the series goes. Much of being a god is a double edged blade. Because Oponn makes Paran one of their weapons pretty much, that also gives Paran a bit of power over Oponn. That's why Paran was able to do that. A lot of this series is about the relationship of gods and their adherents (willing or otherwise) and how they affect each other. It's also why many ascendents don't want to be gods, because it gives more power but puts more restrictions. I believe what broke the chains was the immense cold of the warren of darkness shattering them. As for why the hounds could get that close, keep reading. Completely blanking how this happened. Refresh my memory. Is this unrelated to the Azath? Hahaha, that is actually a very perceptive question. You'll learn why in the next book."
Malazan,2meyqg,linuxcloud,3,Sat Nov 15 22:23:41 2014 UTC,"For the life of me, I can't remember the specifics behind when this information is revealed, so if it's a spoiler, I deeply apologize. It doesn't affect anything in the long run, but it might help you understand what's happening.   This is how I interpreted this sub-plot. Again, I haven't read Bonehunters in over a year, so the details might be fuzzy.  Essentially, in Deadhouse Gates, Heboric, Felisin, and Baudin are sentenced to the Otataral Island mines, where Heboric comes into contact with a ton of Otataral and he somehow becomes interconnected with it.  After their escape, the group encounters a giant hand hidden in the sand. If I remember correctly, this is one of the many jade hands around the world, the same ""comets"" that came crashing down in this book. When Heboric touches it, he becomes connected with the souls within, and this event (coupled with other factors) is what causes Fener to fall down into the mortal realm. So now Heboric has the jade powers and Otataral powers within him.  The soul comets (or jade strangers, as their called) contain the souls of The Crippled God's followers. Remember, he was originally summoned from an alien plane as an attempt to take out Kallor back when he ruled his empire, and The Crippled God was consequently forced to leave his followers behind. They're coming to the world in order to find him.  Now, I can't remember why the group sets out to bring Heboric back to Otataral Island; I can't recall if someone tells them too, or if they decide on their own. I know Paran made a deal with Hood so that Hood would release Heboric's soul (since he was originally dead) back to his body. But I don't remember much beyond that. Never the less, due to Heboric's connections with the Jade strangers, he's able to guide them to him, and I believe they want to use Heboric to guide them to the Otataral Island so that the island itself (which cancels magic) can contain them instead of having them land on Seven Cities and cause apocalyptic destruction.  That's my current understanding of that subplot. The specifics might be off, I'm in desperate need to do a reread to understand it more. Plus, Heboric's story is easily one of the most confusing ones in the series. If someone else has a better understanding, please let me know. But never the less, hopefully this resolves a bit of your confusion."

Where have we seen those before?   The group was going to Otataral Island as a stop on the way and also because Dragon Spite was frantically towing them to the giant glowing thing on the horizon (also Otataral Island) out of a desperate hope to find shelter.

I get the feeling that their relationships and rivalries are microcosms of Edur and Letherii society. I very much want to see what happens when they inevitably come into conflict.   Initial Impression of the Brothers Beddict  Hull: ""Real man don't talk about his feelin's."" Reminds me of Robert Duvall in ""Who's More Grizzled?"" My favorite thus far.  Tehol: Either the most evil of the bunch, or literally Batman. Maybe both. I want to know more about what's up with Bug. Is he some kind of badass in hiding?  Brys: So noble. So dumb.   For what it's worth, I see parallels between Brys and Trull, in that nobility combined with naivete are their weaknesses. I don't have a good enough handle Sengars yet.

Malazan,2mc0ov,TheAmerikan,25,Fri Nov 14 23:50:39 2014 UTC,"Okay, I just finished my 3rd reread of the main 10 a week or so ago, so lets see how I do. I'm just going to gloss over the boring stuff and focus on the ""cluster fuck of esoteric magical lore, and deus ex machina"" stuff.  Heboric is chained in Unta, an avatar of Hood talks to him and that probably foreshadows something but by the time it happens no one remembers this scene.  Heboric goes to the mines and absorbs otataral into his body as is standard, then he escapes.  While escaping, Heboric touches a statue containing the souls of followers of The Crippled God.  The otataral (orange) and souls (green) fight, their balance fluctuates over the course of the books.  Meanwhile, Felesin and Bauduin, who have been escaping with him, get desperate. They push the ""summon god"" button on his tattoos, and Fener is dragged into the mortal world. I think Heboric himself had some agency in that too, but I forget and he was pretty out of it at this point.  Anyways, they get off the island and enter the desert and he's blind but can see sometimes and has ghost hands sometimes and maybe one's green and maybe one's orange and no one really cares, and somehow one of the colors lets him see the past and shit so he keeps talking about how all this used to be but everyone just thinks he's crazy, so they mostly ignore him.  Then he's in Sha'ik's camp in Raraku and he's being old and dumb, when Trake comes along and decides that since Fener isn't using his destriant anymore he'll make his own claim, so Heboric gets new tattoos and becomes a destriant of Trake, which he isn't so much a fan of but it makes him kind of badass.  So Felesin dies and somehow L'oric, Felesin jr., and Cutter all get roped into taking Heboric back to the island to give the green shit back somehow. On the way the Seven of the Dead Fires kill him because they want to steal Felesin jr., but Cutter keeps going and gets his body to the ocean, and as green comets are coming down threatening to ruin the shit out of most of Seven Cities, his body is sinking into the depths.  At this point, Paran decides that since he's in Seven Cities, he'd rather it not get pummeled by half a dozen green comets, so he goes to pull up a card and call in a favor, but by some mischance he ends up with Hood's card and gets to meet the reaper face to face. This works out, because Paran convinces Hood to shove Heboric's soul back out the gate, and somehow that means big green hands come out of the ocean and he catches all the comets and everything is good for now.  Fast forward to like, Dust of Dreams, and Mael brings Heboric's body to K'rul, because Mael gets fist dibs on anything that falls into the ocean and they have plans. Then I guess they use Heboric as a connection between TCG and Korabas because he has both the green and the orange? I don't actually know why he was necessary, but he's the dude that did the transfer, and he gets to hang out with the coolest dragon for the rest of eternity.  tl;dr: I've read through three times and I still don't fucking get it."
Malazan,2mc0ov,Notalec,6,Sat Nov 15 00:49:43 2014 UTC,"The key to the above is that Heboric was Fener's true Shield Anvil - and when he lost a political struggle, his hands were cut off and wrongly consigned to Fener.  That weakened Fener and created a massively exploitable connection between the god and Heboric - which others jumped on to link up other things between the two ends of the realm of mortals and the realm of the gods. Trake, otataral, jade giant souls, Mael etc. They all used Heboric and he tried to do the best he could to direct the using in a compassionate way (see him admonishing Trake at times in his speech).  Heboric is also the man who unintentionally taught Duiker and other unnamed historians to be critical of the empire and compassionate to the individual being shaken down by the bullies. Basically, he was the excellent thief who turned to religion and feared noone from then on - and he paid for it all too often for years on end."
Malazan,2mc0ov,Udinaas,5,Sat Nov 15 06:02:10 2014 UTC,"To clarify a bit about the comets: as I understand it the jade hands thing worked because Heboric realised his true duty/nature as a Shield Anvil. It's never explicitly stated, but I think through the jade he ended up taking the mantle of Shield Anvil to the Crippled God. As the comets were somehow related, perhaps literally were, the worshipers of Kaminsod seeking their god from their reality, Heboric was able to take on their souls as a Shield Anvil does, removing the threat of the comets."

So when the other priests cut off his hands, it put Fener in a weakened state since only part of his ritual tattoo was ""dead.""   When Baudin touched his stumps to the jade statue it caused a huge power surge that forced Fener to the mortal realm and gave Heboric the ghost hands (one hand is otataral due to his proximity to the mines).  Afterwards, he gets adopted by Treach because Treach needs some homies and Fener is no longer active. Heboric then dies because Treach is young and can't grasp the big picture so doesnt see all the players.  Later, when the world is about to die by the jade strangers, Hood releases Heborics soul as part of a deal with Paran. Heboric then saves everyone by realizing that he needs to accept the souls into himself like a shield anvil would. This causes the jade strangers to not fall to earth and they go into Heboric instead.   Finally, since Heboric's soul is just chillin for four books, with the help of the jade strangers, he helps chain the otataral dragon.   I think I got it all. The part with the hands getting cut off  weakening Fener always threw me off a bit. Either way, it's how I understood it."
Malazan,2mc0ov,TurboS40,1 point,Sat Nov 15 01:02:26 2014 UTC,"As you know Heboric was a priest of Fener but he was excommunicated. So, he had his hands cut off (remember when that happened to that other guy in MOI?). His chest tattoo was magically tied to Fener - so when Baudin pointed his nonexistent hands towards the tattoo, it released Fener into the mortal realm and somehow this attracted Kaminsod's followers, who were jade giants in the sky. Did this also shatter the moon? Fuck.  So to answer your question I don't know.   But there are people out there who do. Can't remember where I read things. Perhaps on here, perhaps on the Malazan Empire forums.   I need to read these books again. I just started re-reading the Wheel of Time though, so it'll be a while.   EDIT: Just realized after reading other responses that Fener wasn't released when the tattoos were touched, but when the jade statue was. What a fucked up storyline."
Malazan,2mc0ov,erotic_hercules,1 point,Sat Nov 15 00:37:56 2014 UTC,"Just a question about the excommunication. I am in the same boat as you, cant remember where I read shit but didnt the priests that chopped his hands off do so of their own accord? So he Heb was still ok in the eyes of fener and they did it to give themselves more power?  nfi is this is correct.. i might just be completely off the mark :P"
Malazan,2mc0ov,Notalec,2,Sat Nov 15 06:01:39 2014 UTC,"It's strongly implied by some ascendant I can't remember at the moment that Laseen/the claw pulled some strings to get it done, and that Fener was pretty pissed about it."

Malazan,2mc0ov,Gaebryal,1 point,Sun Nov 16 09:22:12 2014 UTC,"yes, his tatoos were a path to feners warran, with his hands being the key, so touching the tatoos on his hands to his chest could put him in contact with fener.   people in the temples of fener performed the reve on him, but it was for political reasons, so fener had never rejected him."
Malazan,2mbesz,Nightender,7,Fri Nov 14 20:29:54 2014 UTC,"Probably not just you, but definitely not me. That's how opinions are, I thought the whole series was awesome, I liked ICE too.

Malazan,2mbesz,Landmarkmoon,5,Fri Nov 14 20:37:35 2014 UTC,"I'm making sure I haven't missed anything, which is more than possible with Malazan books.  Also, I guess I'm just looking for hope or direction that reading Duiker's sections is worthwhile.  His sequences are easily twice as long as other POVs and I've felt like they were dragging.  This is the first time this has happened since I started reading this series."
Malazan,2mbesz,ghoulbuns,3,Fri Nov 14 21:00:13 2014 UTC,"Totally worth it.  Savor it, because it will pay off huge in the end.  The strategic element of Coltaines march and Duiker slowly appreciating the man and his efforts is worth the slow build up.  Duiker is a historian and his point of view is a bit dry but by the end of this book, that is not what you will take away from it.  I'm willing to bet you may look back on this post and think ""yeah, I don't know wtf I was thinking."""

Malazan,2m9jq5,drmunkeluv,4,Fri Nov 14 07:06:25 2014 UTC,"I think you should read FoD before moving onto Esslemont's books, because it's only one book and I think it's a good counterpoint to DoD and tCG wrt the Tiste plot-line with the way some of the characters look back on that time. I think FoD is best read after the main series anyway.   If you decide to read the Esslemont books though, they jump around and interweave with the main series (in publication order effectively). You might want to do a quick read up of the main discussions on the Tor reread of the book preceeding whichever of those you're up to as you go, though with NoK you might want to jump right in. With RotCG you'd probably want to brush back up on what happened on Malaz isle in BH before starting. Actually, that might be the only main one really, the others it's only the broader strokes of the series that matter, RotCG the political climate is more important coming in.  Anyway, I'd recommend FoD because it might be slow going through the Esslemont stuff and you'll probably burn through it as there's less subtlety in the writing compared to Erikson's other books while Esslemont's first 2 books aren't so well written.   The Bauchelain and Korbal Broach novellas don't take very long to read and are pretty funny, but are novellas so you could read pretty much all of them in no time."

Malazan,2m9jq5,Rasket,2,Fri Nov 14 07:37:59 2014 UTC,"Erickson has some off shoots, which are pretty good. FoD is awesome and should be read.   Sadly, Esslemonts books are canon and should be read so you should read them as well.  Sorry."

There are multiple references in MoI to the entirety of MT already happening. Paran is warned about the ' Deliverer of Midnight Tides' (Rhulad). There are Edur raiding Genebackis from the south, Envy's group see's them. The Bridgeburners find the body of the Edur that tried to kill Tehol, that Bugg sent through the warren of Ruse, etc."

Malazan,2m77wl,bigworm118,7,Thu Nov 13 18:04:54 2014 UTC,"1) By the end of the book? I'm not sure if his role is truly revealed, other than his constant claims that he is the High Priest of Shadow. Keep reading to find out more about Pust, you're not done with him yet.  2) It has just recently been sought because of the loss of Fener. With Fener being brought into the mortal realm and thus vulnerable, a battle between the world's most powerful Soletaken and D'ivers began to see who would replace him. The answer becomes clear in a few books, but the full explanation is not revealed until much later.  3) Kalam was convinced that Laseen was, in fact, working for the good of the Empire. My theory is that something Laseen said made Kalam see that she was still working under the plans of the old Emperor Kallenved, and Kalam trusts him because of his relationship with Whiskeyjack and Dujek.  4) Shadowthrone is insane. That's about it. He's nuts, but he is a master puppeteer and right now everyone is dancing on his strings. You can see mainly why Pust is his High Priest."
Malazan,2m77wl,holyplankton,5,Thu Nov 13 18:56:42 2014 UTC,"On Pust, in this book he was tasked by Shadowthrone to create diversions so that the D'ivers and Soletaken weren't able to find the gates to ascend and take Fener's place.  When Icarium and Mappo spend time with Pust, they go in his basement and find an old, dusty gate. That's the gate all the D'ivers/Soletaken are looking for. I don't remember the specifics following that, but the fact that it's his temple means he's hiding it since Shadowthrone naturally doesn't want a random crazed D'ivers/Soletaken to take Fener's place.   So Pust spends the book creating a false trail to lead them away from the true gate and instead towards the Azath house (Again, if memory serves)."
Malazan,2m77wl,Therrester,2,Thu Nov 13 19:07:47 2014 UTC,"That's right, I was looking a bit too forward and I think I misinterpreted OP's question. Thanks for clearing that up."

Malazan,2m3pgc,runin2k1,14,Wed Nov 12 19:51:27 2014 UTC,"a soultaken is someone who changes from one form to the other.  like a man to a bird, or rake to a dragon.  once youve gotten your soultaken form, you cant change it, (at least theres been no instances or mention of it happening.  When your killed in your soultaken form, your dead as well.  a D'ivers is someone who changes into many forms, like one person into  5 jackels, or 1 person into a swarm of rats.  the more animals you have, and the larger they are, the more powerful.  so a guy that turns into 5 dogs, is more powerful than a guy that turns into 5 cats.  but a guy that turns into 1,000 rats is more powerful than they are, theres no exact rules, but you can get the gist of how powerful they are  Divers are usually considered more powerful than all but the most powerful soletaken, however they tend to go insane eventually.  Divers can gain power by drinking blood,  when they are powerful enough, they can sprout more animals, so 5 dogs, could turn into 6.   Special cases:  Ryllandaras.  He was one of the first heros of the first empire (the first heros were soultaken that survived being killed in slaughter of the city)  He was originally a soultaken, but he eventually became d'ivers.  he could also change his shape, hes been white jackals, ay'tog, and desert wolves. At one point of the books he is 20 wolves, so hes massively powerful.  one of his white jackals was captured, and is currently imprisoned under the city of li-heng, and its theorized he was somehow able to put all his insanity into that 1 being and cut if off from himself.  there was a mage who was able to D'ivers himself, and so now there are 4 of the same guy, 3 of him wants to kill the other part.  there were 2 dragons that could reverse d'ivers into a tisti andii woman. some other god/power made this possible.  also you cant have d'ivers dragons, the chaos in them resists the ritual that splits them."
Malazan,2m3pgc,Gaebryal,6,Wed Nov 12 20:57:23 2014 UTC,"D'ivers are more likely to go insane also. Splitting the mind among all the creatures causes mental issues.  One D'iver figured out a way to put all the insane pits into a single creature, but he's pretty unique.  Also, AFAIK, D'ivers don't often return to their human form, which leads to a loss of humanity.

Still love the image though, the arms are great and that tail looks amazing."

Malazan,2lzxyr,arachno_capitalist,3,Tue Nov 11 21:22:47 2014 UTC,"Much appreciated! I totally get what you mean. I actually started conceptualizing with a lower-to-the-ground/salmanderish build, but realized that its arm-blade slices wouldn't be physically possible in those types of shoulder sockets. I'll keep messing around with them though."
Malazan,2lzxyr,MoranthMunitions,1 point,Tue Nov 11 21:36:34 2014 UTC,"After reading this comment I've been thinking a little about it and I thought with how a K'ell hunter would have to run but keep closer to the ground, maybe a longer tail and less of an arc upwards? That way you could kind of see it being balanced if it leaned forwards, put its tail down and ran keeping the blades forward for speed/stealth, while if it was actually fighting something it could stand in more how you currently have it. It would probably make it seem a bit more slender too, as they're the faster kind. All I can think is those arms must be pretty heavy being welded to the bones.  But it's very much how I visualised them and while a couple of others have mentioned broader heads I think what you have seems more reasonable. A broader head would offset the eyes weirdly, considering they're not so much like a crocodile watching out of water (upwards) all of the time which probably gives the higher positioning of their eyes, but actually a very tall predator, either on par height-wise or taller than other creatures (discounting the other K'Chain Che'Malle, you'll learn about those later in the series). I think the more ""dinosaur"" style head makes more sense in terms of what it is, though the eyes seem to be orientated outwards to make it look almost reverse cross-eyed haha.  ...Anyway, totally didn't mean to be doing any critiquing, just got a little carried away. I think it's a great picture, I can't wait to see what you come up with from the later books!"

Malazan,2lzxyr,SleepingJag,4,Wed Nov 12 02:35:27 2014 UTC,I thought dinosaurs were generally considered to have been large birds?
Malazan,2lzxyr,montaron87td,-2,Tue Nov 11 21:58:06 2014 UTC,"Nah, dinosaurs were lizards. Dinosaur literally translates ""Great Lizard"". Modern birds are thought to be descended from a suborder of dinosaurs called Theropoda, so that could be where the confusion comes from."
Malazan,2lzxyr,BorealHound,6,Tue Nov 11 22:28:03 2014 UTC,"I think the raptors among dinosaurs have been generally revised to be feathered. I know at least the Veliciraptor is.  There's many different types of dinosaurs and while mostly thought to be cold blooded they wouldn't really fit with how we see lizards. Something like the triceratops was likely not anything like a lizard in any way.  And the word dinosaur is an ancient artifact only used because everyone knows it that way. It in no way represents what dinosaurs actually were.  Also a fun dinosaur fact: while often depicted as living at the same time in media, there's more time between when the Stegosaurus went extinct and when the Tyrannosaurus roamed the earth than there is between the Tyrannosaurus and humans."
Malazan,2lzxyr,SleepingJag,3,Tue Nov 11 22:57:58 2014 UTC,"Not sure why all of the downvotes. You're only really partially wrong. Dinosaurs are considered reptiles, but not necessarily lizards. ""Lizards"" aren't even a really well-defined group. It pretty much just describes reptiles that aren't snakes that generally walk with 4 legs close to the ground.   As another poster said, some reptiles (as you said, most likely theropods) were the ancestors of birds. While some of them evolved bird-like traits (warm-bloodedness, feathers), you would not consider them as birds because they don't have all the traits necessary to be classified as a bird.   To recap:  -Not all reptiles are lizards.  -Not all dinosaurs were lizards.  -(Mostly) All dinosaurs were reptiles.  -All birds are descended from a sub-group of reptiles, of which some dinosaurs were also a part of.  -The lines blur the closer you get between reptiles and birds.  Edit cuz I can't format."

The ICE books are canon to that universe and he's a co-creator.  Also, the fact that a publisher, Tor, felt comfortable in running a re-read blog/book club that has lasted over 4 years!!??

Apparently, being published by a major publisher was formerly a criterion for proving notability, but was removed some time ago.  I'll try to slip the reference to The Guardian in there somewhere. I'd love to find a citation on sales figures, but I have not yet found a reputable one. Tor apparently claims the series has sold more than one million books but that's printed on the book cover of TCG which is copyrighted material and not easily citable."
Malazan,2lyq03,HustSword,4,Tue Nov 11 14:59:33 2014 UTC,This thread actually has me pretty f'n pissed. Stupid admin Nazi's.
Malazan,2lyq03,MoranthMunitions,3,Tue Nov 11 15:18:04 2014 UTC,"I did a fair bit of searching around earlier and it's ridiculous how little information there is out there about book series in general, like how you mentioned with WoT also on the Notability talk page. I didn't realise how much books must rely on word of mouth. It seems stupid that for the last probably 10 years you could walk into any regular book shop (Angus and Robertson, QBD, Barns and Noble etc.) and find at least one book in this series and there's nearly no articles on it beyond Tor and a couple of others. They're obviously popular but it seems mainstream media doesn't care much for (at least) fantasy unless there's a movie or tv show.  At least that other wikipedia editor agreed with you that level of sales should be considered. Do you think that having two bands (Caladan Brood and Chain of Dogs) named after things from the series and inspired by them is enough, with the other information, to help cover this?   The book has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works whose sources are independent of the book itself. This includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, other books, television documentaries and reviews.   Technically they're ""published"" works, I'm not sure how you would go about referencing these or anything, but maybe an extra section could be added to the main Malazan Book of the Fallen page to include them? One more thing towards the cause anyway."

Do you think that having two bands (Caladan Brood and Chain of Dogs) named after things from the series and inspired by them is enough, with the other information, to help cover this?   I'm not sure. I'm trying to expand the notability criteria here, but it sounds like you've already seen the discussion.  I spent more time than I should have today trying to find published works discussing the Malazan series that are not affiliated with the author and publisher in some way. So far I've found a Wired.com interview with Steven Erikson published after the release of Forge of Darkness and a Clarkesworld Magazine interview with Ian Esslemont. I'm hoping both of these count as ""non-trivial published works"" and have made this argument in the talk page of several of the articles. I seem to be mostly successful thus far, with the only current exception being Assail where some fucking cockbag called ""TheRedPenOfDoom"" keeps reverting my changes despite my requests to discuss it on the talk page. It is, quite frankly, a miracle that anything at all gets published on Wikipedia. Something that should have been relatively trivial has transformed into a 10+ hour investment on my part."
Malazan,2lyq03,MoranthMunitions,2,Wed Nov 12 01:59:38 2014 UTC,"Yeah I've looked through the talk pages this morning, including taking a look at Assail and BaB. I looked around for a couple of hours or so last night/early this morning here, just after you posted, and tried to find some related stuff.   This is a paper written by a user of the Malazan Empire Forum, while here on the forum it is mentioned that the The International Association for the Fantastic in the Arts (IAFA) has previously had papers about the Malazan world. On wikipedia it's mentioned under principal societies and as an annual conference, but with no citations there, so I'm not sure how well that would be received anyway. I was considering contacting them to see if they were able to either write a list of these papers on their site or find out if any were published in a (hopefully reputable) journal.  However I'm unsure of how to phrase a request like that and am dubious that even if I could find out that these editors on wikipedia would find that non-trivial, which is pretty vague. Tbh I probably wouldn't classify that as non-trivial myself, especially considering the effort it is to find it."

Even if you take Rake's magic away he is one hell of an accomplishes swordfighter. This won't be apparent until later.  Much like, that there are mortals who can stand up and even overcome other ascendents. Examples of this will come in following books.

He IS writing new books, but they will be set earlier on in the time, during the fledgling days of the malazan empire, and will focus on the Old guard (i.e. Kellanved, Dancer, Laseen, etc. etc.) before they ascended and became Ammanas and Cotillion.  As such, assail is the 'end' of the story, as far as Esselmont is concerned.   However, Erikson is writing a Karsa Olong trilogy once he's done with the Kharkanas triology, so those will probably continue along the timeline from where Esselmont left off."

Malazan,2lifu4,bigworm118,2,Fri Nov 7 16:48:24 2014 UTC,"big, but not to big, but again not to small, more medium than large, heavy but not like silly heavy."
Malazan,2lifu4,Bouncl,2,Thu Nov 13 17:42:27 2014 UTC,"They do have tusks, pretty sure. It's mentioned at least once in deadhouse gates."
Malazan,2lifu4,LegSpinner,2,Fri Nov 7 05:17:59 2014 UTC,I just changed the canines to tusks due to popular demand. Thanks for the advice and the support!
Malazan,2lifu4,AllWrong74,1 point,Fri Nov 7 20:13:46 2014 UTC,Don't they also have vertical eyes (i.e. slitted to open sideways)?
Malazan,2lifu4,NoFortress,1 point,Fri Nov 7 08:50:50 2014 UTC,That's how they are described.  Tusks.
Malazan,2lifu4,Sacripain,1 point,Sat Nov 8 14:31:25 2014 UTC,"Is Karsa's height ever stated? I seem to recall it saying he was half again as tall as a man, so I've always imagined him in the ~12 foot tall range."
Malazan,2lifu4,Sacripain,1 point,Fri Nov 7 13:50:26 2014 UTC,"Its worth noting that he didn't draw a Jaghut. He drew Icarium, who is Jhag."
Malazan,2lifu4,sonofa2,2,Fri Nov 7 18:19:04 2014 UTC,Curse my mobile internet :( my assumptions have made a fool of me once again!
Malazan,2lifu4,Svelte_Ninja,9,Fri Nov 7 15:39:17 2014 UTC,"Brood isn't a Barghast.  You missed K'Chain Che'Malle and Nah'ruk, and Forkrul Assail.    Otherwise, nice job."
Malazan,2lifu4,sonofa2,8,Fri Nov 7 15:41:50 2014 UTC,"Preliminary edit: what follows isn't really a spoiler but if you are super serious about that sort of thing do not read the following comment if you haven't read FoD. But really, it isn't a big deal.   Brood takes the form of a Barghast (or something similar), and towards the beginning it is said that people think he is at least part Barghast IIRC.  Warning edit: never go to the wiki unless you are finished or ok with spoilers.   Edit: This is seconded by the wiki http://malazan.wikia.com/wiki/Caladan_Brood"
Malazan,2lifu4,sonofa2,3,Fri Nov 7 15:46:25 2014 UTC,"Spoiler tag that, please."
Malazan,2lifu4,Asiriya,3,Thu Nov 6 22:14:05 2014 UTC,"Ugh, please dont post this sort of thing in a non-spoiler marked thread with not spoiler tags yourself."
Malazan,2lifu4,sonofa2,1 point,Thu Nov 6 23:04:07 2014 UTC,Sorry. It's not actually a big deal. Brood is obviously more than he seems and his true nature is neither revealed nor particularly important to the series so far.
Malazan,2lifu4,Asiriya,2,Sat Nov 8 14:33:45 2014 UTC,It's still a spoiler.  It's a fairly pertinent fact about a character that you don't learn until you read at least 10 books (reading in the published order).
Malazan,2lifu4,Torgan,1 point,Fri Nov 7 02:00:27 2014 UTC,I put a warning. I was on mobile and an again right now.
Malazan,2lifu4,MoranthMunitions,1 point,Fri Nov 7 03:07:28 2014 UTC,Brood can be whatever form he wants. Perks of being an Azathani.  The Barghast don't exist yet on FoD.
Malazan,2lifu4,mibeosaur,2,Sat Nov 8 14:34:39 2014 UTC,"Yes, but that's irrelevant. For the purpose of depicting the Barghast race, Brood is fine. Because he looks like a Barghast."
Malazan,2lifu4,pussifer,-1,Sat Nov 8 15:04:16 2014 UTC,"I disagree, if you want to depict a Barghast, use a Barghast. Trotts, Hetan, or Spax are all better choices. Brood, is not Barghast, and could literally show up looking like anyone or anything. Think K'rull being male then female, or Sechul being human, than FA, back to human."
Malazan,2lifu4,thevorminatheria,5,Thu Nov 6 23:14:23 2014 UTC,"I truly don't know what the hell you are talking about. Stop explaining Azathanai, I know what they are and it's completely beside the point.   For the entire main series, Brood is in the shape if a Barghast. He might even have that shape in FoD. Therefore, depicting him (in his standard, preferred appearance) is a perfectly valid example of a Barghast. Just as much as any actual member of the race. The fact that he can change shape to something else is irrelevant."
Malazan,2lifu4,stilgar02,3,Thu Nov 6 23:26:14 2014 UTC,"And Tiste Edur, Tiste Liosan."
Malazan,2lifu4,BZH_JJM,5,Thu Nov 6 23:35:31 2014 UTC,"Well yeah. They're close enough to Andii. I think of I remember right, the Liosan were the tallest of the 3, with Edur being the shortest.  Really the species should just be Tiste though, since the split happens due to allegiances."
Malazan,2lifu4,Seattlelite84,3,Thu Nov 6 23:41:30 2014 UTC,"Only on RG so not sure I know that yet.  We ever get to see Mother Dark in person btw? I find the Tiste one of the most fascinating parts of the books, I'm hoping there's going to be a lot more about them coming up."
Malazan,2lifu4,Seattlelite84,2,Thu Nov 6 22:26:39 2014 UTC,"You do in the most recent book, Forge of Darkness. Finish MBotF first though."
Malazan,2lifu4,The14thWarrior,1 point,Thu Nov 6 22:38:50 2014 UTC,"There is a lot of Tiste related stuff in all the next 3 books and FoD centres nearly entirely on them. It's fantastic, some of them got a bit on my nerves but for the most part the Tiste characters are great, hopefully you'll enjoy it all."
Malazan,2lifu4,LegSpinner,1 point,Thu Nov 6 23:30:17 2014 UTC,I'm aware but I've only just finished Memories of Ice so I haven't been introduced to those races or the Forkul Assail yet. I'll add them when I do though!
Malazan,2lifu4,LegSpinner,5,Thu Nov 6 23:41:46 2014 UTC,"Yes, but what do their hands look like??"
Malazan,2lifu4,gathmoon,1 point,Fri Nov 7 10:19:52 2014 UTC,Haha I knew that was coming
Malazan,2lifu4,LegSpinner,3,Fri Nov 7 13:30:22 2014 UTC,"I like them. Most of them are not quite like I had them pictured in my head, of course, but they look good. I'd love to see the other Tistes and the Assail, and maybe females? Or not. They're pretty great, either way."
Malazan,2lifu4,fondlemyflipper,3,Fri Nov 7 05:46:38 2014 UTC,I like most of them but frankly I picture Karsa and the Toblakai in general as more good-looking than represented here. Might be just me tough. I lack imagination.
Malazan,2lifu4,AllWrong74,7,Fri Nov 7 20:15:12 2014 UTC,Very nice job.  My only comment would be that Erikson actually tries very hard to avoid the stereotype in fantasy of the dashing white heroes and big black brutes (e.g. the Dothraki).   Actually most of his human characters aren't white at all!
Malazan,2lifu4,TocYounger,5,Fri Nov 7 04:19:21 2014 UTC,I feared that I'd run into that problem with this pic but I had little wiggle room around it considering I could only put one human in here.. I'm planning on making another group shot of the more interesting human characters (especially the likes of Quick Ben and Kalam) once I finish up the rest of the races here! Thanks for your support :)
Malazan,2lifu4,infernal_llamas,1 point,Fri Nov 7 13:39:02 2014 UTC,I got the impression that most of the humans had blue skin.
Malazan,2lifu4,strawberrysundaeandt,2,Fri Nov 7 04:17:56 2014 UTC,"Holy fuck your art is amazing, even if I do visualize the races differently."
Malazan,2lifu4,_ricepudding,2,Fri Nov 7 13:40:23 2014 UTC,Haha thanks man! I'm still reading the series so I plan on making edits/adding new races once I learn more about them
Malazan,2lifu4,simiancanadian,2,Tue Nov 11 23:15:40 2014 UTC,"My fucking god. You're the shit man. Can you make posters?? My best friend is really into malazan, thanks to my heckling till he read it, and he'd love one for Xmas. In fact, so would I!!"
Malazan,2lh7pp,ZeppelinJ0,13,Thu Nov 6 15:01:18 2014 UTC,I like it. Always thought this picture of Tool was badass  http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2012/080/2/1/ct_by_junalesca-d4thn9p.jpg  And this one of Cotillion  http://hellhowler.deviantart.com/art/cotillion-272169450
Malazan,2lh7pp,HustSword,3,Thu Nov 6 15:25:23 2014 UTC,That's a fucking awesome Cotillion...
Malazan,2lh7pp,MoranthMunitions,2,Thu Nov 6 15:28:23 2014 UTC,I like your flair.
Malazan,2lh7pp,Darce_Choke,1 point,Fri Nov 7 11:40:26 2014 UTC,"Both of these drawings are incredible, some really talented artists/Malazan fans."
Malazan,2lh7pp,bigworm118,5,Thu Nov 6 23:56:47 2014 UTC,"I was browsing around for some fan art and found a lot of older sketches and artwork from a long time ago and wanted to get some more recent renditions of characters and scenes from the books.    Suddenly I noticed this guy from Serbia's work in one of the DeviantArt Malazan galleries and it was posted merely days ago!  He has a couple pieces up right now and apparently has only read 4 books.  I wound up contacting him to get a print of the Apsalar piece printed for my new house so I'm fucking pumped for that to arrive.  Very interesting and unique style, I hope he keeps churning out more.  Hope you guys enjoy it as much as I do, it's a refreshing rendition of SE's vision!"
Malazan,2lh7pp,DrinkyDrank,1 point,Thu Nov 6 15:03:40 2014 UTC,I think this is an awesome fresh look at the characters. Nice find and Nice job to the Artist! how much for a print?
Malazan,2lh7pp,drunkmilkshake,1 point,Thu Nov 6 20:10:11 2014 UTC,"It was a little pricey. He lives in Serbia and charged 50 euro which ran me about $70 US.  I just got paid though and really need some decoration for the new house and would love him to continue his work so it was worth it for me.   It seems he'll only offer prints if you ask him directly, I also had to ask for SE's permission.  I'll try and remember to post pictures of it once it's framed and on a wall."
Malazan,2lh7pp,Ares0362,5,Fri Nov 7 02:59:55 2014 UTC,Awesome!  This sub needs more fan art imo
Malazan,2lh7pp,dude21862004,3,Thu Nov 6 17:03:12 2014 UTC,"Really cool style. I like the Whiskeyjack and Coltaine ones quite a bit.   My favorite Malazan art is probably this one of Itkovian. I've always wanted to try doodling some characters out, but they deserve better than me."
Malazan,2lh7pp,Asiriya,2,Thu Nov 6 22:55:33 2014 UTC,I literally just read this part of MOI. Fuck that book is intense
Malazan,2lh7pp,Yanutag,3,Sat Nov 8 08:33:18 2014 UTC,"I feel like there's just too much goin on in those pictures. Too much color especially. I think the more subdued pictures (Like the one of Tool by /u/HustSword ) match my own imagination much better, but maybe that's just preference."
Malazan,2lh7pp,hexarin,3,Thu Nov 6 16:46:47 2014 UTC,The fuck has he done to my Karsa :O
Malazan,2lh7pp,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Thu Nov 6 22:11:19 2014 UTC,Yes lol. They are all good except Karsa. I thought he was Fener's Mortal Sword.
Malazan,2lh7pp,Jtitus187,3,Fri Nov 7 01:25:26 2014 UTC,"I can't say the style quite fits for me, but the art itself is absolutely fantastic."
Malazan,2lh7pp,TriscuitCracker,2,Fri Nov 7 00:39:53 2014 UTC,"Apsalar seems rather old in that picture, but other than that they're pretty cool."
Malazan,2lh7pp,strawberrysundaeandt,2,Thu Nov 6 15:27:12 2014 UTC,"I really like the Coltaine, Rake and Whiskeyjack."
Malazan,2lfs2h,Garph,7,Thu Nov 6 03:21:11 2014 UTC,"I definitely say that you should wait for your copy of the Bonehunters. Book 6 is when all of the plot threads start coming together - without Midnight Tides, you are effectively missing one third of the introductory plot. Many events in MT pertain to TBH as well."
Malazan,2lfs2h,RonnieRim,2,Thu Nov 6 03:33:19 2014 UTC,Wait for the copy of Midnight Tides
Malazan,2lfs2h,PromisedPrince694,2,Thu Nov 6 12:00:10 2014 UTC,Thanks m8. I'll try to find something else to read in the meantime. Or even... study for exams... Nah
Malazan,2lfs2h,future_forward,2,Thu Nov 6 12:15:00 2014 UTC,"Definitely agree with Ronnie. I am on my first read through of the series and almost done with Bonehunters. The two plotlines converge in the second half of BH, and done so through an outsider's POV. If you haven't read MT first, it will be very vague – and probably won't feel significant, or at the very least as rewarding as if you have read it."
Malazan,2lfs2h,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Thu Nov 6 04:34:41 2014 UTC,"Much of The Bonehunters follows from the events of Midnight Tides, I'd strongly advice against it."
Malazan,2lfs2h,ScottyBeans,1 point,Thu Nov 6 15:25:03 2014 UTC,Don't do it. There are a good amount of spoilers  A month shipping? That's insane. Cancel and hit up a book store
Malazan,2lfs2h,ElmoTheNefarious,0,Fri Nov 7 17:16:39 2014 UTC,"I'm gonna come out and say it's probably fine. Are there spoilers for MT? Yes, a small handful, but they're not particularly big ones. If anything it'll probably help you get through MT - a lot of people have trouble caring about all the new characters when the existing plotlines have seemingly been discarded, and this may help ease you into that. I say do it, fuck waiting a month."
Malazan,2lfs2h,MoranthMunitions,2,Thu Nov 6 07:21:45 2014 UTC,"I personally think it can be bad enough for first time readers that it's not worth doing anything that'd make it harder, so I don't think that they should. But at the same time, BH before MT probably isn't too bad as far as these go, not as harmless as reading MoI before DG, but probably one of the only two switches that can really be done in reading order imo. Maybe HoC could be read before MoI too.  I just wouldn't recommend it."
Malazan,2lduj5,emolga587,3,Wed Nov 5 17:32:07 2014 UTC,Where are his answers? Or when does he answer.  Thanks.
Malazan,2lduj5,Aiolus,3,Wed Nov 5 21:34:11 2014 UTC,"I think they give it a couple days for questions to be posted, and then the answers will come in a separate thread/posting."
Malazan,2lduj5,Jragghen,2,Wed Nov 5 21:55:23 2014 UTC,"As /u/Jragghen says, the answers will come in a separate post, and if the previous books are any indication, it will be between one and three weeks."
Malazan,2lduj5,TisteSimeon,2,Wed Nov 5 21:59:16 2014 UTC,"And he normally likes his in depth wordy answers so I imagine he writes each one out before posting them. He loves to interact with his fans and has got involved with some big discussions in the past.  My personal, more dubious honour was to be involved in a conversation with him that someone else started about the comparative sizes of characters penises..."
Malazan,2lduj5,Aiolus,2,Wed Nov 5 22:36:53 2014 UTC,What an awkward conversation that must have been for a first fan meeting.  Still though quite an honor.  Would love to meet the guy.
Malazan,2lduj5,TisteSimeon,2,Wed Nov 5 22:40:46 2014 UTC,"That one was at a BBQ in Cambridgeshire in England. Those of us there had met him at his book signing tour when Toll the Hounds came out. He knew a few of us who were prominent posters in the forums and we had been at the BBQ for a while (lots of meat/alcohol...)   He really is a cool guy though I've had the honour to meet him about 3 times and he is always friendly and open to the most random questions the nerdiest fans have. Also, he KNOWS his work. Like, really obscure scenes in a book he wrote nearly a decade ago, he knows what they mean straight away."
Malazan,2lduj5,Aiolus,2,Wed Nov 5 22:48:54 2014 UTC,That's awesome.  It's actually just how I would hope he'd be.
Malazan,2lduj5,HustSword,2,Wed Nov 5 22:54:13 2014 UTC,I see Steven has answered some the question on the linked thread now. A few of thoughts...  Really liked his comments about Tavore and writing her in the style he did.  FoD Spoiler  I really wanted to have Pust's mule's identity revealed. DAMMIT!
Malazan,2ldg8x,HustSword,3,Wed Nov 5 15:30:21 2014 UTC,Fancy seeing you here Mike. I'm surprised you didn't go with Icarium.
Malazan,2ldg8x,powerslave44,1 point,Wed Nov 5 15:55:39 2014 UTC,Still on gardens for my re read. I'm slow.
Malazan,2ldg8x,powerslave44,6,Thu Nov 6 02:36:00 2014 UTC,"Man I never got on the Trull bandwagon and I'm really not sure why. I feel like everyone else seems to love him, but whenever I got to a Trull chapter I was like, ""Ugh, more of this idiot"". I'll admit the kid could do some good stuff with a spear.  Big Beak fan. Agree there. One of my favorite 'minor' characters for sure.  I think we can all agree on Tehol and Bugg, if not just for their humor and banter alone."
Malazan,2ldg8x,ScottyBeans,15,Thu Nov 6 12:05:35 2014 UTC,Fiddler. I love his internal monologues and his viewpoint 'from the ranks' is always the most interesting to me in regards to insane power tiers in the story.
Malazan,2ldg8x,yaymalazans,1 point,Thu Nov 6 16:51:53 2014 UTC,"Fiddler for me as well. Most interesting and relatable perspective, fascinating storylines.  Quick Ben is a close second."

TL;DR - Witness."
Malazan,2ldg8x,titanemesis,2,Wed Nov 5 19:55:38 2014 UTC,Also a rapist.
Malazan,2ldg8x,AreYouReadyToReddit,5,Thu Nov 6 00:48:55 2014 UTC,"Yes, but we don't celebrate him for that. One looks at the awesome parts of the Toblakai, and glosses over the unsavoury bits.   One actually does that for a lot of Erikson and Esselmont's characters, or one would have noone to root for."
Malazan,2ldg8x,titanemesis,3,Wed Nov 5 21:06:10 2014 UTC,It's not glossed over. It's gone into in detail. That's why we hate Karsa when we first meet him. One of the reasons Karsa is such a good character is because he realizes that what he was doing was wrong and he completely changes over time.
Malazan,2ldg8x,Jester814,1 point,Wed Nov 5 23:29:28 2014 UTC,I was referring to fans of Karsa glossing over his past actions.

Malazan,2ldg8x,Claughy,1 point,Thu Nov 6 07:09:20 2014 UTC,"True, but he also said it is because he doesn't use blood oil anymore.   Sounded more like an excuse than accepting responsibility."
Malazan,2ldg8x,Cazraac,1 point,Thu Nov 6 13:36:36 2014 UTC,"yeah that's true, although blood oil seems to make rape unavoidable."
Malazan,2ldg8x,Claughy,5,Thu Nov 6 04:14:31 2014 UTC,"Only a rapist within our cultural context, if you really read into  it through the story its embraced by the teblor as part of thier culture and helps avoid inbreeding which was a major problem for them. Karsa is one of the best stories ever told in fantasy, his story arc and personal development throughout the malazan book of the fallen is un rivaled."
Malazan,2ldg8x,Mangler51,1 point,Thu Nov 6 15:53:45 2014 UTC,"Regardless of Teblor excuses it is rape. Doesn't make him any less of a great character but it also doesn't make him a good person. Erickson didn't make characters good or evil he makes them real. And rape (sadly) is real. Kara IS a barbarian (as loose and poorly defined that term is). He ignores a lot of societies rules. Since of those rules are good and some aren't, but regardless he spits in the face of the world. In the best way possible."

His whole plan for dragnipur just blew my mind.   Runner up would be Icarium, also a badass but something about his condition just strikes a chord with me. His sections with Mappo were some of my favorites of the entire series, and that part where he's picking up the potsherds, oh god, the feels.   Apparently I'm drawn to tragic characters."
Malazan,2ldg8x,wolfofiron,3,Wed Nov 5 15:56:34 2014 UTC,The potsherds scene was the only time I've cried while reading. Hood's Balls those were some FEELS.

Malazan,2ldg8x,ScottyBeans,6,Thu Nov 6 02:33:45 2014 UTC,"Kalam is my favorite character. While good at pretty much everything that he does, he's also hilarious when he's with Quick and is just generally fun to read about.   Iskaral Pust for the runner up, for when his Mule set up camp."

Malazan,2ldg8x,Jester814,5,Wed Nov 5 18:09:57 2014 UTC,"Trull - Possibly the most badass character in the entire series and he doesn't even think about or know how much of a ridiculous badass he is.  Onos T'oolan - I played an Undead Warrior in WoW when I first read the series so... Also, he's a sarcastic smartass, which is basically me  Fiddler - A mostly regular human dude just trying to survive all the batshit craziness going on around him.  Hood - I. HAVE HAD. ENOUGH.

He has the weirdest powers and uses them in the coolest ways to execute his ridiculous plans. Almost like Rake, actually.  Tehol and Bugg. Bugg in particular, because he's such an absurdly human character in spite of being very much not. Tehol because he's hilarious and brilliant."
Malazan,2ldg8x,SerBronnofBlackwater,4,Thu Nov 6 02:59:36 2014 UTC,It's hard for me to have a series favorite it really differs book to book for me. If I had to pick any it would probably be Ganoes since his chapters were always the ones I looked most forward to.

But it's hard to justify any of them over Fiddler. He's the heart and soul of the series. He just is."
Malazan,2ldg8x,TygettLannister,3,Thu Nov 6 07:09:23 2014 UTC,Whiskeyjack. I have a tendency to like a certain character type and his character is definitely my type.
Malazan,2ldg8x,strawberrysundaeandt,3,Wed Nov 5 18:25:24 2014 UTC,"I really like Samar Dev. She's a strong and smart character trying to keep up with a guy who's a force of nature. I'm still on DoD though.  Also the ox in TtH, does his job, keeps going."
Malazan,2ldg8x,uncreative_canadian,3,Thu Nov 6 09:27:51 2014 UTC,"Rake: for the planning, power, and respect which he recieves from others (even Silchas) Tehol: obviously for the humour, but also the pure genius and selflessness required to tear down and reform and an entire economy Iskarul Pust (and Mule): if only for the stare down with Kruppe"
Malazan,2ldg8x,pfk505,3,Wed Nov 5 21:50:34 2014 UTC,"I was always expecting some sort of reveal about Pust's mule, and even had an inkling it might have been Shadowthrone at one point."
Malazan,2ldg8x,the_bridgeburner,2,Wed Nov 5 22:30:16 2014 UTC,"Can't say for sure as I'm not yet finished (RG), but leaning heavily towards Karsa Orlong.  Reasons: everything."
Malazan,2ldg8x,MateoHardini,2,Thu Nov 6 15:02:05 2014 UTC,"Itkovian. Because, Itkovian.  Karsa Orlong. Enough reasons have been given here.  Dancer. For being a God who really feels the pain of others. And being extremely badass as well.  Tehol and Bugg. Tehol for being a supreme genious but with no malintentions. And Bugg because of his loyalty towards Tehol despite being an Elder God.  And how can I not mention Anomander Rake. What a personality. A life full of sadness and a death that was equally sad."
Malazan,2ldg8x,Decstarr,2,Thu Nov 6 15:27:05 2014 UTC,"Yeah as soon as I posted I realised I hadn't included Cotillion in my original list, and immediately regretted it. I really enjoyed the humanity displayed by his character in some of the later books, especially towards Aspalar and Lostara Yil. Plus of course, another solitary bad-ass.   And Beak! Oh Beak! Another great character.   I did warm up to Tavore a lot as the books progressed. I actually really liked how so much of her persona was ""off screen"" so we really know/knew very little. The fact there is so little on page about her and yet she is actually inspiring the troops, and how her speeches are not the traditional rousing epic monologues was such a great anti fantasy trope.  Yeah, and Itkovian was an epic character too. The whole Chain of Dogs (Coltaine) and Seige of Capustan (Grey Swords as a whole) totally got me hooked on the series. The Vathar Crossing (Day of Pure Blood), and the Tenescowri + Gruntle's Tenement building are series high points and both stand out to me as some of my favourite moments in any fantasy I have read.  And I just wanted to say, aaaaahhhhhh, feels so good to talk Malazan with people!"
Malazan,2ldg8x,JediMasterZao,2,Wed Nov 5 18:10:12 2014 UTC,"I can't choose one, but I'll give by top 5.  Ganoes: when I picked up GotM, thought he'd be the literal main character of the book. But just his whole progression in the books to his badass deeds is awesome. The ""we are yours"" statement after dujeks death was great.  Toc: so tragic because it seems like he's just trying to constantly fit in, but the gods have other plans. Was surprised when we got to read him again in RG and overjoyed when whisky jack told him he was part of the bridgeburners.  Dancer: was one of the few gods who didn't forget he was a human and actually had a heart like with guiding cutter and apsalar back together.  Fiddler: words just can't describe how much he did. He was glorious and couldn't think of a better man to live a happy life in malaz island.  Erastas: just kidding...  Helian: was an interesting and complex character. Her bar invasion was awesome and when she ran out of booze she showed she was a great person but was held back by her crippling fear of spiders."
Malazan,2ldg8x,thingreenlines,2,Thu Nov 6 06:15:18 2014 UTC,"How is this even a discussion? The beginning of House of Chains to me is one of the best things ever written. Karsa is just by far the coolest character in the entire fantasy world. So full of himself, so powerful, and he even develops a sense of humor.   My other favorites are: Dassem, Rake, Envy, Tool, Tehol & Bugg (for obvious reasons), Kalam, Fiddler, Dujek, Whiskeyjack... fuck it, there are just too many :-P"
Malazan,2lcsay,montaron87td,4,Wed Nov 5 10:03:21 2014 UTC,"FA are a whole race of beings. Not all have the same views, as you see the difference already between Equity, Reverence, and Calm.  I don't recall it ever being explained explicitly why some FA mated with humans to make the watered, so we'd have to theorize. Rape maybe?"
Malazan,2lcsay,sonofa2,3,Wed Nov 5 11:03:35 2014 UTC,yeah I'm guessing mostly undignified rape.
Malazan,2lcsay,Giotto,5,Wed Nov 5 15:26:47 2014 UTC,I'm of the opinion that since watered are weaker they make good subordinates for the FA. So even if distasteful mating with lesser beings would allow them to grow in power.   Don't think it was ever fully explained. Also I think the FA were a somewhat slow breeding people.
Malazan,2lcsay,Aiolus,3,Wed Nov 5 15:27:19 2014 UTC,since watered are weaker they make good subordinates for the FA   That's a good theory. Basically bred for subordination while still being able to control lesser beings. Sounds like something the FA would do.
Malazan,2lcsay,titanemesis,3,Wed Nov 5 15:30:32 2014 UTC,"Might even be more straightforward than rape. They could have simply enslaved a number of humans as thralls, and used transfusions of Forkrul blood (in varying amounts).   This waters down the 'purity' of the glorious master race blood, but effectively marks them as property of the forkrullan, and possible passes over some minor strength / ability."
Malazan,2lcc8f,gunsterpanda,2,Wed Nov 5 05:46:52 2014 UTC,"""'Who ordered the T'lan Imass into Aren? I shall tell you. Surly, the commander of the Claw, the woman who took upon herself a new name- Fiddler: 'Laseen...I have never before heard that assertion...There were no written orders - none found, in any case-' Apsalar: 'I should have killed her there and then...these memories...they are so clear. I was...sent to Aren...to see the slaughter. To find out what happened. I...I argued with Surly. No-one else was in the room. Just Surly and...and me.'"" - Apsalar, speaking from Cotillion's memories, and Fiddler"
Malazan,2lcc8f,Landmarkmoon,2,Wed Nov 5 06:33:46 2014 UTC,"In this case, did Dujek lie to Whiskeyjack then when he claims that Laseen never ordered the massacre on Aren?  I cannot distinguish who is the liar: Dujek, or Dancer"
Malazan,2lcc8f,Notalec,3,Wed Nov 5 06:54:48 2014 UTC,"A lot of characters lie, but more often they're just wrong."
Malazan,2lcc8f,MasterPatricko,1 point,Wed Nov 5 07:49:18 2014 UTC,"I concur, but in this case, which character is the one lying? and what's the proof?  Hence my question XD"
Malazan,2lcc8f,SageOfTheWise,2,Wed Nov 5 08:09:06 2014 UTC,It's not clear who is telling (or even knows) the truth TCG spoiler.
Malazan,2lcc8f,Landmarkmoon,2,Wed Nov 5 10:03:30 2014 UTC,"I can't remember when it is (The Bonehunters maybe?) But I swear at some point there's some discussion about Aren and we get from some Imass point of view characters about how sometimes they take matters in to their own hands when empires start getting too powerful or get out of control (Human first empire massacre used as an example), with the implication being no one gave the orders, they did it on their own. Which does really explain why there's so much confusion. I mean Dancer is sure it wasn't Kellanved, and the series makes it more than clear by the end that the Imass don't take shit from Laseen, let alone orders. Neither fit the bill really.  Plus later in TCG when you get the whole Tlan worship of Dassem stuff, it makes sense they'd have some animosity towards Aren."
Malazan,2l5jll,danaran,6,Mon Nov 3 12:58:14 2014 UTC,"I also got caught out on these. They don't really matter a great deal in hindsight of having read the whole series, but book-to-book it did annoy me. I'd recommend just avoiding the order of houses if you can, but regardless the glossaries don't even appear in the 2nd half of the series.   As I remember it, ICE is even more guilty with a major spoiler in RotCG for one of the houses. ICE also has the unfortunate habit of spoiling character appearances in his Dramatis Personaes. Something Erikson is good at avoiding."
Malazan,2l5jll,harnagarna,5,Mon Nov 3 13:39:01 2014 UTC,"I think this is the only time it happens in an Erikson book. Watch out for ICE's stuff though, massive spoilers abound, in RotCG at least. Though the Baudin thing isn't a spoiler actually, since he shows up in MoI as the Knight of Death."
Malazan,2l5jll,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Mon Nov 3 15:16:44 2014 UTC,He did? When was that? I totally forgot or didn't notice at the time lol
Malazan,2l5jll,SageOfTheWise,7,Mon Nov 3 16:06:42 2014 UTC,"He shows up in the Mhybe plotline. Forget exactly what he does now. Helps out Coll and Murillio or something. He's got swords permanently attached to his hands. They don't actually say his name, but its made clear its him."
Malazan,2l5jll,PhilosopherIshamael,1 point,Mon Nov 3 16:09:59 2014 UTC,"He takes the Mhybe to the temple of Hood and puts her into a permanent sleep state I believe.  Also scares off Korbal Broach and Bauchelain, who think that he is there for them."
Malazan,2l5jll,TriscuitCracker,3,Tue Nov 4 01:05:13 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I found the appendices so important I forgave any spoilers."
Malazan,2l5jll,zerro_4,1 point,Mon Nov 3 15:43:39 2014 UTC,"Bonus: If reading the appendices spoil the plot, it only means you were actually paying close attention. It didn't quite hit me that Baudin was the Knight of Death until well in to MoI.  I found reading the backs of the books were much larger spoilers."
Malazan,2l5jll,TurboS40,1 point,Tue Nov 4 02:03:31 2014 UTC,"This. If if you're reading things in an appendix and getting upset about spoilers - you are way too paranoid about spoilers.   These books are so damn good that people re-read them over and over - and that is a tremendously time-consuming activity. If big twists and reveals were the bulk of the series' appeal, that would not be the case. Just chill out and enjoy."
Malazan,2l1heg,Mel_Books,12,Sun Nov 2 04:40:32 2014 UTC,"For a good 6 months, I ranted and raved about how Deadhouse Gates was the best ending to a book I'd ever read.  Then, I read Toll the Hounds.  Just you wait."
Malazan,2l1heg,AllWrong74,3,Sun Nov 2 11:52:35 2014 UTC,I've already got that one sitting on my shelf sstaring at me! I love the Hounds of Shadow (assuming those are involved) and it's one of my favorite covers. I'm so excited to get to it!
Malazan,2l1heg,aleifur,11,Sun Nov 2 12:52:43 2014 UTC,You have walked the Chain of Dogs. You are one of us now. Welcome Mel_Books
Malazan,2l1heg,TriscuitCracker,6,Sun Nov 2 12:13:53 2014 UTC,"Leave us alone, Mel Books!   Sorry, I couldn't help it lol"
Malazan,2l1heg,montaron87td,3,Sun Nov 2 14:12:24 2014 UTC,I am honored to walk among you. May we never forget the fallen.
Malazan,2l1heg,lilpin13,4,Sun Nov 2 12:53:38 2014 UTC,I just want to add that Deadhouse Gates is not really the book where Fiddler and Kalam get to shine. Wait until House of Chains and the Bonehunters and beyond for that.
Malazan,2l1heg,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Sun Nov 2 09:30:47 2014 UTC,I'm just starting Bonehunters and Fiddler and Kalam are so spunky and witty.
Malazan,2l1heg,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Sun Nov 2 14:06:07 2014 UTC,"That's one of the great things about DG, you go in invested solely in their plot lines because they're among the few familiar faces,  and they really take background roles for the entire thing,  giving you new people to care about and inevitably watch suffer."
Malazan,2l1heg,compiling,8,Sun Nov 2 12:45:10 2014 UTC,"Having read your post, I feel you're going to do juuuuust fine reading the rest of the series. Personally with Felisin I truly do feel sorry for, she's been through so much, and for what? Cause she's noble and slave to a political cause she didn't choose? And as for Baudin....well, keep reading. Icarium and Mappo are just a great tragic duo and I remember wanting to throw the book across the room when I read the final part of the Chain and what happened when it reached Aren, and the scene set among the thousands of trees that followed.  Glad you're enjoying them!   And now, back to Genebackis in Memories of Ice, to see what your old friends the Bridgeburners and company are up too...this is generally considered among the top three of Malazan books, you're just going to be knocked over with all the epicness. You'll return to your regularly scheduled Seven Cities program in House of Chains!"
Malazan,2l1heg,montaron87td,2,Sun Nov 2 05:18:21 2014 UTC,"I was nervous about the continental shift between GotM and DG,  but now I'm so invested in both I can't wait to get back to Seven Cities!"
Malazan,2l1heg,MoranthMunitions,5,Sun Nov 2 12:39:07 2014 UTC,"My only real complaint was the ""escape from the warren"" scene with Kulp and crew. That got reminiscent of GotM with ""What the fuck is going on? Am I supposed to understand? HOLY SHIT UNDEAD DRAGON! oh it's over..."" but that could have been a result of me reading it too late at night. I'll find out on a reread.    Anything about it you didn't get? Probably an important part of the book to get, because that section has probably some of the longest running ramifications in the entire series."
Malazan,2l1heg,HumbleAsFudge,4,Sun Nov 2 06:12:06 2014 UTC,"Did anyone here actually understand that bit the first time through?  Yes, there are a lot of ramifications, but that involves information that just isn't available yet."
Malazan,2l1heg,grixa,1 point,Sun Nov 2 11:05:28 2014 UTC,"Could you explain the ramifications (maybe in a pm to avoid spoilers for OP)? I remember the scene, but I'm reading tCG now and I can't really think of what makes that so important."
Malazan,2l1heg,ScottyBeans,4,Sun Nov 2 09:36:05 2014 UTC,Just some of the things related to it: Spoilers up to tCG
Malazan,2l1heg,mgallowglas,1 point,Sun Nov 2 12:25:05 2014 UTC,"also read DG, currently on MoI so if possible no spoilers, but i too was  bit confused at that part, is there anything I should have concluded?"
Malazan,2l1heg,Bilbato,1 point,Sun Nov 2 10:18:37 2014 UTC,"I think I followed what was happening,  it was really just the how and why, I definitely got the feeling that once I understand warrens better I'll be able to go back to that scene with an ""oh, duh!"""
Malazan,2l1heg,mgallowglas,4,Sun Nov 2 12:42:47 2014 UTC,"Cool post. It's always nice to see new readers' reactions to the books.  Deadhouse Gates for me was hard to get into. It had a new setting with more new characters and I didn't started to enjoy the book until halfway through it. From then on it was a hell of a ride. A roller coaster of emotions.   I, too, loved Felisin. Hers is a tragic story from the beginning. To be thrown to such a place at that age. I inmediatly sympathized with her. I also liked Heboric a lot and it was nice to know that there was at least someone who cared for Felisin. My favourite moment was when Baudin reapears to save them but then dies, the moment Felisin's armor falls.  The chain of dogs plot was the one I was the least invested in. English is not my first language and it was very difficult for me to understand what was going on in the battles. I couldn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to. However, I did enjoy Duiker a lot. It was great to see things from his perspective.  Mappo and Icarium were definitely a highlight of the book. And it was very cool when their story was joined by that of Fiddler and company. Like you, I was indifferent towards Fiddler in the first book but after Deadhouse Gates he became a favourite of mine and he really shines in later books.  And, by the way, don't worry too much about the incident in the Silanda. It's an event with many layers that are going to be uncovered little by little every time it is revisited. You will have the chance to understand it better.  On to Memories of Ice now. That book will blow your mind, trust me.  Anyway, cool to see you are loving the series. You have a long journey ahead of you. Enjoy the ride and keep us posted."
Malazan,2l3b6k,sthreet,9,Sun Nov 2 20:18:08 2014 UTC,"I would say no.  Seven Kingdoms is a nation where the rivals to power are all in the aristocracy, which has a wide variety of houses.  Even without the money aspect, Letherii has basically only the small royal family.  The rest is just secular merchant power. Also, Westeros seems to involve a greater number of nations than Lether, which is pretty isolated."
Malazan,2l3b6k,PhilosopherIshamael,1 point,Sun Nov 2 21:00:15 2014 UTC,"Ok, sounds like I just had a bad memory of Lether and and really wrong idea of game of thrones."
Malazan,2l3b6k,Landmarkmoon,3,Mon Nov 3 00:45:05 2014 UTC,More like Crimson Guard VS Laseen's Empire. Without the magic and the cool subplots and more centered around the politics I guess.
Malazan,2l3b6k,Landmarkmoon,1 point,Mon Nov 3 00:49:37 2014 UTC,"I need to read more Malazan then, but will keep that in mind.  Is there only two sides in that world then? I thought there were like thirty or something."
Malazan,2l3b6k,Decstarr,2,Mon Nov 3 03:27:37 2014 UTC,"There are a lot. I'm just exaggerating it's just more humans than Gods, Monsters and Toblakai"
Malazan,2l3b6k,Sex-Haver,-1,Mon Nov 3 04:48:10 2014 UTC,"Ah, ok. Sounds boring, but I mean, good writing is always good. To prove this point I would point out that the witcher and Brunner would be summerized as very similar characters, but Brunner is so awesome."
Malazan,2l3b6k,Landmarkmoon,2,Mon Nov 3 05:51:02 2014 UTC,"You can't compare Apples and Oranges... Malazan is truly epic in terms of typical fantasy aspect (mainly magic & alien races), whereas ASoIaF is more like a ""realistic"" medieval setting with small fantasy elements mixed in. If I explain it to other people who are not that much into fantasy, I always say something like:  ""ASoIaF is like a medieval political thriller with a lot of violence and sex and some discreet elements of fantasy. In terms of characters ASoIaF is probably one of the best series ever written. The motivations and general aspects of all the protagonists are so manyfold that you never stop being surprised, but at the same time the character development in most cases is absolutely believable.   Malazan is a total fantasy overkill with insanely epic magic battles, legendary beings and pure badassness. The authors are able to create funnier dialogs and really impressive, powerful characters, but in my opinion are not too good at creating multi-layered characters (with a few exceptions). And they completely, utterly fail at telling love stories!!"

Malazan,2kybw3,TriscuitCracker,5,Sat Nov 1 07:14:27 2014 UTC,"I feel the same way. It really shows how Erickson is an archeologist and anthropologist, everytime he describes something new about geography or the history of a race, you get a sense that you are only glimpsing one tiny blip that barely encompasses the whole. I loved the opening of Memories of Ice. Erickson throws thousands of years, alien gods actually falling to earth, beings of power and burned to ash continents around like it was a dark and stormy night."
Malazan,2kybw3,jhanjria,6,Sat Nov 1 04:59:58 2014 UTC,"His writing style is so elegant. It doesn't seem that all these people and their origins, lives are a fragment of his imagination.  He must have a warren through which he can peek in the Malazan universe and bring us these awesome tales."

Malazan,2kybw3,TheBananaKing,7,Sat Nov 1 10:33:58 2014 UTC,"Yep. Every other author you pick up is going to feel YA for months.   I finished CG recently, and the only thing I could think to do was binge-read the entire Discworld series back to back."

Good ol Coltaines Chain of Dogs is what first grips you in the Malazan series. How did you like Rake and the Tyrant, Icarium/Mappo or Tool/Lorn, or The Bridgeburners? (Malazan has lots of buddy combos, Quick Ben/Kalam, Fiddler/Hedge, etc)"
Malazan,2kxu7x,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Sat Nov 1 05:10:45 2014 UTC,"I couldn't really keep track of all of the Bridgeburners. I was familiar with Whiskeyjack (who I've actually wondered, is he the same captain who spoke to Paran in the prologue of the first book?), and Quick Ben, but I kept confusing the others, especially with the Darujhistan natives thrown in the mix as well.   Tool and Lorn were pretty funny, as Lorn was used to being in a position of power but Tool didn't give a shit what she thought most of the time.  Icarium/Mappo is intriguing, as I haven't found out where exactly they come from or what their true purpose is, so still on the fence on that one."
Malazan,2kxu7x,AllWrong74,5,Sat Nov 1 06:18:09 2014 UTC,"Not only is Whiskeyjack the captain that talked to Ganoes, but Fiddler is the other soldier that was on the battlement that day, along with Surly who had just changed her name to Laseen."

Malazan,2kxu7x,Jester814,3,Sat Nov 1 09:30:35 2014 UTC,Book 1 is NOT the worst of the series. It's simply one of the hardest to read because you're thrown in the middle of..... everything... with no explanations.
Malazan,2kxu7x,MoranthMunitions,2,Sat Nov 1 05:24:07 2014 UTC,"It's true that it's hard because of that, but imo while it's still good it doesn't stack up to the other books in the main series.  Which one did you think was the worst?"
Malazan,2kxu7x,Jester814,5,Sat Nov 1 05:32:55 2014 UTC,"I don't remember, but there were 2-3 that I really didn't like or just didn't stack up to the rest I should say.

Malazan,2kxu7x,SKR47CH,2,Sat Nov 1 22:03:21 2014 UTC,"Actually, the first is in my opinion the best book. To actually start a series with something like that speaks volumes about the author. Furthermore, this particular book is so much more than it  looks. I have constantly and frequently came back to this book when reading the latter books."
Malazan,2kxu7x,ShamelesslyPlugged,2,Sat Nov 1 06:38:51 2014 UTC,I'm jealous if you. The first time through the Chain of Dogs is a tremendous experience.
Malazan,2kxu7x,SKR47CH,1 point,Sat Nov 1 16:44:15 2014 UTC,"First of all, I second the foundation.   And Malazan only gets better and better with each book. New awesome characters getting introduced everywhere. The character development over the series is the best I've seen. And by Hood, the vastness of the world is beyond comprehension.   This series is like a whole new world you can immerse yourself in. I did that in my first read through. Now I am waiting for things to get a little foggy in my head before the re read. And while we are in the topic, this book was meant to be re read. I haven't done that yet, but I can actually see how it'll be a whole new experience."
Malazan,2kxu7x,HustSword,1 point,Sat Nov 1 06:33:36 2014 UTC,"I joined Reddit purely so I can talk Malazan with people, as I know no-one who has read it...  It was the last of the big four epic fantasy series I got to (the others being ASOIAF, LotR and WoT), but MBotF certainly contends with ASOIAF as #1.  And damn, Asimov's Foundation series is flipping excellent. The Mule has to be one of the best ""bad guys"" of all-time!"
Malazan,2kycey,ginfish,12,Sat Nov 1 04:42:03 2014 UTC,"can someone say just how strong Elder Gods (Mael in particular) are? Would they be able to put up a fight to Icarium or Rake?   Elder gods are fucking scary powerful.  As for the question of Rake taking one, he already did at least one.  Draconus forged Dragnipur.  Rake took it from him, and then killed him with it.  A Mael/Rake fight would be pretty epic, and would probably lay waste to a continent.  I'd bet on Rake, though.  Icarium's problem is that even though he turns into the Incredible Hulk, he's got a glass jaw (for the purposes of being knocked out).  I think Mael would be able to stop Icarium, then get the fuck away, so that Icarium wouldn't remember him when he woke up.  Based on that, I'd call that one Mael's way.  Note:  The only reason Rake isn't an elder god is because he isn't worshipped by more than a small cult.  He's elder, has access to an elder warren, and is one of the most powerful beings in the world.  He's just doesn't have a large church."
Malazan,2kycey,AllWrong74,2,Sat Nov 1 12:53:31 2014 UTC,"Elder Gods are from a time when there was only darkness tho' (Before Light came... Hell that reminds me of Tolkien's beginning to his legendarium), so i don't know just how ancient that makes them compared to Rake."
Malazan,2kycey,ShamelesslyPlugged,2,Sat Nov 1 13:57:54 2014 UTC,Rake is a Tiste Andii directly descended from Mother Dark. That makes him come from that exact same time.
Malazan,2kycey,SchizoStarcraft,5,Sat Nov 1 16:47:19 2014 UTC,"It's hinted in FoD that Draconus came before the Tiste, being Azathanai."

Malazan,2kycey,DarkAdaephon,5,Sat Nov 1 15:19:13 2014 UTC,"Being that it takes a bit for Icarium to get rolling, I say Rake smokes him.  Then Icarium wakes up and starts anew."
Malazan,2kycey,AreYouReadyToReddit,6,Sat Nov 1 06:56:08 2014 UTC,Quickben wins.  Unless Kruppe is around...
Malazan,2kycey,TriscuitCracker,3,Sat Nov 1 23:17:21 2014 UTC,"Well, Rake has Dragnipur, and Icarium isn't called the Lifestealer for nothing. Plus in the Malazan universe, no matter how god-like and powerful your Ascension is, either more pantheon based like Fenrer or just a really powerful being like Rake or Brood, you CAN be killed, or injured by brute force. Sure, Mael could raise a tsunami and bury Icarium, but it probably wouldn't kill him. Rake was only the 7th among the Seguleh and Dragnipur is a huge part of his fear factor. Everybody is vulnerable, no matter how powerful they are. It's  more about who gets the lucky shot in or who has the will to actually throw down in battle."
Malazan,2kycey,Aiolus,18,Sat Nov 1 05:06:13 2014 UTC,Rake is only accidently seventh and gave no effort to rising in the ranks.
Malazan,2kycey,YearOfTheMoose,3,Sat Nov 1 15:20:23 2014 UTC,"Triscuit, have you read Forge of Darkness yet? I think it did a pretty good job of setting up the fact that Rake's ""fear factor"" is enormous long before Dragnipur gets forged."
Malazan,2kycey,TriscuitCracker,2,Sun Nov 2 21:00:43 2014 UTC,"You're right, I have read Forge of Darkness, and had not really thought of that history of Rake. It's been a long time since I've read it, time for a reread!"

Malazan,2kycey,turnpikenorth,3,Sat Nov 1 17:35:24 2014 UTC,"It's important to realize that in GotM Rake says Brood could take him, therefore I say Icarium wins."
Malazan,2kycey,Seattlelite84,2,Sat Nov 1 19:22:17 2014 UTC,Some serious underestimation of Icarium ITT if ya ask me. Hmph.
Malazan,2kycey,Aiolus,1 point,Thu Jan 1 04:56:04 2015 UTC,"My wager would be on Rake. It wouldn't be easy though.   Elder God's play by certain rules and this occasionally hinders their abilities. They could most definitely hold their own, depending on the Elder God and their current power of course.   When you read the prequel FoD you will get some more insight into Rake and Elder God's"
Malazan,2kycey,ScottyBeans,1 point,Sat Nov 1 15:26:47 2014 UTC,"I'd give it to Rake all things considered. I think Icarium in rage-mode would be challenging but not overpowering to the other big-time ascendants. The thing is, it seems like Icarium is just really really good at taking out entire cities etc, where there are no such beings to oppose him.  Apples to apples, I think Rake could wipe out a city pretty easily if he decided to put his mind to it. I also think Rake is a boss even relative to some of the other gods. Not sure on Mael. He's powerful, sure, but doesn't have many feats to look back on that make me go ""oh damn, Mael kicked some ass there."" A couple, but not many."
Malazan,2kycey,Decstarr,1 point,Tue Nov 4 16:39:44 2014 UTC,"To me, the answer obviously is Rake. I argue that the only ones even close to contesting him are Dassem (ascended) and Karsa (being his own Warren and physically superior). It is true that throughout all the books Icarium is always promoted as the Hulk, but the few times we actually see him in action, he isn't too impressive. I mean, Trull stood his ground versus Icarium in full rage mode. The ONLY indicator we have for him being so terrifying is stories of how he wiped out entire cities (without any major resistance since everyone seems to pee his pants when he's around) and the fact that when Quick Ben fights him, he seems to get stronger and stronger the more angry he gets (HELLO HULK!).  Given the incredible talents, I'd say both Rake and Dassem could easily deal with Icarium before he even becomes enraged enough to be dangerous to them. A full rage Icarium supposedly is like the Hulk - who, iIrc theoretically is the strongest being in the entire Marvel Universe.   As to the Elder Gods: Their power is somewhat unclear. I have the feeling that both Eriksson and Esslemont just like creating badass powerful characters (which is awesome), but dislike clarifying their abilities and powers. Considering that Rake DID kill Draconus (who supposedly is the nastiest of all Elder gods), I'd argue he might be able to deal with Mael. At the same time, I think Mael is the most cunning bastard around, so he'd prolly find some way of avoiding a conflict."
Malazan,2kycey,Hubbell,1 point,Mon Nov 10 23:49:41 2014 UTC,"Dassem lost to rake though.  Rake maneuvered the final move of their fight to end with Dragnipur killing him which is why everyone who watched the fight went full blown WHAT THE FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK????? and Dassem lost his shit over it.  To be able to do that, knowingly, in a fight for your life puts him far ahead of dassem in just pure swordsmanship in my opinion.  If Rake wanted to just end it he would have unleashed Kurald Galain on his ass the moment he saw him and end it instantly.  EDIT: Also, Icarium was said to have become enraged at a simple wounding by an arrow so it isn't like it takes much to piss him the fuck off."
Malazan,2kycey,Decstarr,1 point,Tue Nov 11 03:48:28 2014 UTC,"Like i said in various other posts, I agree with the interpretation that Rake lost on purpose and that it takes immense skill to do that. At the same time, the only real indicator we have for this interpretation is Karsa's ""cheated"" comment, and it might very well allude to something entirely different, like e.g. cheating Dassem out of his revenge on Hood. Admittedly, it's a bit far strechted, especially considering the beauty of using Dragnipur itself to destroy it, but it could be a possibility.   At the same time, maybe it is just me, but I dislike the whole ""Icarium Hulk"" theme just too much. He's a cool character, but the fact that over the course of all the books we never get to see him in real action is somewhat annoying.   Btw, IMO Rake would probably be THE strongest being in the entire series. Best swordsman undoubtedly, an incredibly strong mage, the most powerful soletaken and truly smart and cunning. I don't think anyone else combines all these attributes in such a way."
Malazan,2kycey,drae-,1 point,Tue Nov 11 22:09:02 2014 UTC,"Karsa was appalled by the level of skill rake showed during that duel, I think it's safe to say karsa wouldn't be able to stand toe to toe with rake."

Malazan,2ksufj,neokami,15,Thu Oct 30 17:43:13 2014 UTC,"Erikson does this intentionally. Think of it as if it were a historical text from our own world and you were an alien from a different world. When that historical text begins to refer to various peoples, places, events in our own world, the alien would have no context for any of that. The alien would be required to continue reading and piece together what those places, events, and people all mean to the history that is being presented.  It will only be as you continue through the rest of the series that you will be given the context in which to understand all that is being presented. Learn to be comfortable not having all the answers, because you assuredly will not be given all the answers to all the questions that will arise from this series. Again, this is intentional on the part of Erikson, he likes to leave questions open ended for the reader to answer for themselves."

Malazan,2ksufj,valorcurse,2,Fri Oct 31 01:06:29 2014 UTC,"I'm afraid concerning most of your questions, the only answer is to keep reading. My only advice is to not concern yourself too much with anyone or any event you haven't met yet, it will come eventually. Halfway through GotM you'll start getting more confortable with the characters and writing style and when you read DG it will be a lot more easier. If you have any specific questions I can try to answer them as spoiler-less as possible."

Malazan,2kpqon,mgallowglas,9,Wed Oct 29 21:09:11 2014 UTC,"I've always dreamed of a Malazan game in a tactical RPG setting.  Make it like X-Com or Final Fantasy Tactics where you get one squad in an Army for different campaigns.   Classes like Heavy, Marine, Engineer, Squad Mage and plenty of variations within those classes. (Mages with different warrens heavies favoring different fighting styles)   Your first squad would be during the Chain of Dogs. It get's wiped out. You think game over, but you just take control of a new set of characters. You could fight with the Bridgeburners one chapter and then find yourself under the command of Fear Sengar on the attack with the Tiste Edur.  You could keep it vague and let each character being named by the player or you could add ""special"" characters who might stay around longer. Meaning they have a history and actual place in the book series rather than just one of the nameless Malazans in the Book of the Fallen."

It's where I met them about ten years back in Austin, Texas.  The above conversations were in relation to a table-top gaming supplement. A couple of years ago, we were talking shop over dinner, and I mentioned a couple of friends in the gaming industry that were looking for properties to licence. SE and ICE mentioned that a company was working on a Malazan RPG game that was a side story to GotM. Don't know that's happened with that. They told me one pivotal scene from the world that's not in the books that they wanted to include in the game. I was like, ""MUST PLAY NOW!!!""  As for who it who, I don't know for sure, except that neither was Karsa. That was a close friend of SE who played through the entire first part of HoC. I'm pretty sure SE is Whiskeyjack.

I mean Gwyneth Paltrow named her daughter Apple, there's no way that's an expression of the kid."
Malazan,2kqeb2,likwidstylez,1 point,Thu Oct 30 20:00:16 2014 UTC,"Oh it's a cool name for sure... But it's not something of this world really. It feels to me that a child's name is more about what you perceive in your child (albeit only really the time that they are in the womb) than it is just pulling out your favorite fictional character and slapping it on your progeny. But that's my take on it - obviously your own take is your own. Gwyneth (have you actually heard the backwards logic she tries to use to defend the name? Holy hell ""It's pure and biblical"" - Except the biblical apple apparently damned us?), stuff like this, I can say I'm not for it, but ultimately I'm not for having a list of predefined names that we can use a la Denmark"

Malazan,2kqbhc,stabro,3,Wed Oct 29 23:53:45 2014 UTC,"The ""Watch"" his title refers to is the portion of night just after midnight, iirc. The Shake royal titles all refer to different parts of the night.  If you remember from RG, the shake had all gone to the prison island and there was a bit of discussion about how they had some Andii blood in them, probably remnants of the survivors that fled Bloodeye's betrayal intermixed with humans. So when DoD starts off they've left the prison island because it's being flooded by the rising sea (because the ice is melting, remember?) and are now hoboing out on the beach deciding where to go.  Twilight wants to gtfo, because Lether isn't really a great place for them, since they declared independence when the Edur invaded and also they're poor. I don't think her plan is really fleshed out, but basically she wants to be on the other side of Lether, The Watch is saying that they should just ride through, but she thinks that'll get them killed so she's considering less mundane options that will be explained in time. There's a nice ""Aha!"" moment that you get when they finally reach where they're going, it's pretty great.  You'll get to the Perish and the Khundryl, but basically whenever someone in these books does something that's confusing in the short term, it turns out they're actually next level as fuck and balling hard in the long term."

Malazan,2kqbhc,majiinbuu,2,Thu Oct 30 01:58:23 2014 UTC,"What happened at the end of RG with the Shake and what was their significance? I just remember that Twilight turned out to be the queen and that Yedan is her brother, the Watch. But I don't really understand what his title means. I just read about how Yedan kept telling Twilight to take ""the mortal path."" I don't even understand where/why Twilight is going. I feel like the whole Shake plot is really important since it gets a ton of attention but I still can't really figure out what is going on.   Without being too spoilery, the events of MT and RG make things dangerous for the remnants of the Shake people. Twilight has decided to lead them to the place they came from originally because she thinks it's too dangerous to stay in the Lether Empire. It will probably become clear the farther you get into DoD and tCG.   Also, where did we leave off with the Perish and the Khundryl? Why aren't they with the Bonehunters?    Tavore sent them on ahead to make contact with the Bolkando kingdom. The Bonehunters want to secure safe passage and supplies for their march, if possible."
Malazan,2koe7e,linuxcloud,5,Wed Oct 29 14:27:53 2014 UTC,It is very intense. I thought it was some of the best description of city based warfare in the series.
Malazan,2koe7e,gathmoon,5,Wed Oct 29 15:04:11 2014 UTC,"That's why I love Malazan so much more than Asoiaf. The details in the descriptions of warfare is just so good. GRRM tends to skip to another POV as soon as the fighting starts and you'll get some snippets in a flashback of how things turned out.  Asoiaf is good in other areas, but in terms of combat, it pales in comparison."
Malazan,2koe7e,montaron87td,3,Wed Oct 29 15:33:44 2014 UTC,"I feel like ASOIAF is more political intrigue than it is about war. The malazan books and the black company books are views of the fighters, the people in the pits."
Malazan,2koe7e,gathmoon,3,Wed Oct 29 16:13:01 2014 UTC,"On the other hand, Asoiaf is really good with food descriptions."
Malazan,2koe7e,valorcurse,3,Thu Oct 30 18:58:35 2014 UTC,I can't remember Gurm actually writing a war scene except the siege of King's Landing. All Dany's battles never really....happen. HBO writes them in.

Malazan,2koe7e,PromisedPrince694,2,Sun Nov 2 00:00:55 2014 UTC,I only hope the rest of the book keeps up with the first ~40%. I feel like all of the previous books saved a big convergence for the climax at the end of the book. Having something that intense in the first half of the book was surprising.
Malazan,2koe7e,ScottyBeans,3,Wed Oct 29 15:20:16 2014 UTC,"The ending is insane as well. I liked it just as much, if not more, than the Y'Ghatan engagement.  You are in for a treat, my friend."
Malazan,2koe7e,gathmoon,2,Wed Oct 29 18:34:10 2014 UTC,I am re reading it right now actually. It continues to be a really good entry in the series. You will not be disappointed me thinks.
Malazan,2koe7e,AllWrong74,6,Wed Oct 29 16:12:14 2014 UTC,"That's the longest chapter in the series.  As Erikson said, ""The reader gets a rest when the Bonehunters get a rest."""
Malazan,2koe7e,SerBronnofBlackwater,6,Thu Oct 30 10:42:09 2014 UTC,That whole sequence is probably the best thing I've ever read in a fantasy genre.
Malazan,2koe7e,JediMasterZao,3,Wed Oct 29 15:13:39 2014 UTC,"Agreed, once the Y'gathan fight started i just couldnt stop reading at all. The sequence with the soldiers crawling through the city's bones was just amazing. One of the best litterature i've read. Certainly the best in its genre."
Malazan,2koe7e,AllWrong74,4,Wed Oct 29 20:43:56 2014 UTC,"The sequence with them crawling under the city was hard for me to read.  It was so well written, it was giving me claustrophobia."
Malazan,2koe7e,TriscuitCracker,2,Thu Oct 30 10:42:49 2014 UTC,Bet you are sweating now! The rest of the book is just as good but yeah it's a little different that you have a major big event happening in the first part of the book. This book is where it all starts coming together and subplots from different books start overlapping.
Malazan,2kpytl,ScottyBeans,3,Wed Oct 29 22:07:23 2014 UTC,I don't have the link right now but the newest Werthead map is apparently very accurate. Erikson even approved it and offered suggestions for improvement to Wert.   As far as I can remember Korel is almost straight east of Lether. It's an interesting idea and the Jheck correlation is also something worth thinking about. Hmm.
Malazan,2kpytl,stabro,2,Wed Oct 29 23:58:39 2014 UTC,This one you mean: http://thewertzone.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/updated-malazan-world-map.html
Malazan,2kpytl,montaron87td,1 point,Thu Oct 30 10:28:58 2014 UTC,"Yeah I don't have much to go by on the theory except for what I posted. If its canon that Korel is due east of Lether then I guess it's wrong.  It looks to me like you could move all of Lether under Korel and attach northwest Lether to southwest Korel, and then maybe move stratem over a bit to the east. I actually think that would make more sense of the Bonehunters' trip to the west coast of Lether from Quan Tali. They'd basically just sail South either around Jacuruku or between that and Korel. The Mare blockade wouldn't affect that path at all I don't think, since Mare is on the opposite side where of Fist where it's possible to land an invading fleet."
Malazan,2kopov,froggerlegs,5,Wed Oct 29 16:08:41 2014 UTC,"Your best bet will be Tor's Malazan Reread of the Fallen, found here. It contains an entry for each chapter of each book.

Not really a spoiler, but in case.  Gothos froze everything at the request of the gods and made the Finnest from Scabandari Bloodeye's soul. The freezing is a trademark Jaghut type thing, but Gothos is extremely powerful which is why it had such a long lasting effect which did things like stop the House/Hold of Death from manifesting.  The First Empire mentioned is the human First Empire (with Dessimbelackis, from the Seven Cities) which the Empire of Lether is effectively a lost colony of - not to be confused with the earlier First Empire of the Imass. Kallor's empire was very old also, but is never referred to as the First Empire.  I thought Harlest was a great character for comic relief too. Personally MT is one of my favourite books, there's lots of funny lines in the subsequent books, but really there's a lot more death and the series is a bit darker. Which I guess is saying something considering MT was about a large scale invasion. Trull is easily one of the best characters in the series. Hope you have fun with BH and especially RG (the effective continuation of MT)."

Malazan,2kn5gz,turnpikenorth,2,Wed Oct 29 16:19:29 2014 UTC,"The phrasing Moranth used is a little unclear, but yes Gothos is a Jaghut. Also, although Errant is the Elder equivalent of Master of the Deck, it is a personality trait of his that he is capricious and shares tendencies that are similar to Oponn even though that is not necessarily his exact role. There is some overlap."
Malazan,2kn5gz,PhilosopherIshamael,3,Wed Oct 29 16:52:55 2014 UTC,"Glad to see you're loving the series!! It only gets better from here(imo)  The errant is not oponn... But read further to find out more!   From what I remember it was gothos who froze everything, but it was at the request of a fat blue mael  There have been several empires called ""the first empire"" depending on who is talking depends on which one they're referring to, it is pretty confusing haha"
Malazan,2kn5gz,DumpTruckJester,2,Wed Oct 29 05:05:54 2014 UTC,"And who did poison him?   The king and the other guy (don't remember who, been a long time since i read it) didn't believe that Brys could win so they poisioned their own wine and drank it while they watched the fight, then after defeating Rulhad, Brys (being the suave guy he is) saunters over to the king, not noticing that he is a corpse, and takes a swig of poisoned wine.    Errant is obviously Oponn right? But goes by a different name in Letharii culture?   The Errant and Oponn fulfill a similar role but The Errant is connected with the holds while Oppon is conected to the houses/warrens. In short, no not the same.   Mael was the god that froze everything in the prologue right?    In the prologue Gothos is watching the battle and the betrayal and decides he's going to kill everyone. Mael asks him instead to preserve the battlefield, witch he does.   I hope Erikson keeps up the humor in the next five books.    He will. Just you wait :)"
Malazan,2kn5gz,aleifur,2,Wed Oct 29 11:12:09 2014 UTC,"There were serveral times where the cirst empire was mentioned. I'm confused as to who built the cirst empire. Was it the tiste andii? But I also remember Kallor having an empire in what seemed hundreds of thousands of years in the past.    I assume you mean First Empire (specifically the human First Empire)? The First Empire was an empire in Seven Cities, ruled by Dessimbelackis. It kind of fell apart when the whole d'ivers ritual went to shit and caused all that otateral to be created and the T'lan Imass came in to destroy everyone involved. The Letherii were originally a colony of that Empire, and have now progressed far beyond it.  Kallor ruled a different empire in Jacaruku, around at the same time."
Malazan,2km73j,nectarhoff,22,Tue Oct 28 22:34:31 2014 UTC,"If we're talking pure melee combat, motherfucking Yedan Derryg. Did you guys forget about that time he killed like 2 Elder dragons, four Hounds of Light and a million Tiste Liaosan?   After that, Dassem, In third, hard to say. The Seguleh Second from OST, Trull Sengar, or Angry Undead Tool from DoD, probably. After that, Karsa, Skinner, Rake, Silchas Ruin, Kallor, Brys Beddict, Iron Bars, Rhulad Sengar, and Gruntle all merit consideration.  If we're considering other powers, it's probably a bit harder. Excluding gods: Icarium, then Rake, then Caladan Brood, Kilava Onass, Quick Ben, Tayschren (or so we're led to believe), Silchas Ruin...shit. No idea how to order these, except the first two.  Karsa's a beast, but he's definitely not the most powerful fighter out there. Remember that he fought a non-angry Icarium, and that the most impressive fight he actually won was the two Deragoth, unless you count Rhulad Sengar. Although...I know I put Trull ahead of him, and in terms of technique I stand by that, but Karsa would win that fight through size, strength, and having a gigantic stone sword."
Malazan,2km73j,ElmoTheNefarious,9,Wed Oct 29 00:13:37 2014 UTC,"I definitely do not consider Yedan Derryg to be at the top. He's extremely skilled, but it's honestly mostly the sword he uses.  He was a badass before that, but he was wounded fighting a few Liosan.  Using a Hust Sword in a bottleneck doesn't speak as much to personal prowess as to the weapon that he was using.  Dassem is basically untouchable, even with mundane weapons.  I honestly can't imagine the likes of Rake or Draconus not completely shredding him. Or even others like Ruin or even Karsa. It's kinda like Skinner with Ardata's armor. He seems to rely on tools for his prowess. It would be ok if he had had any part in helping make them or acquired them in some important way. But he always seemed to me like a skilled but pretty mundane warrior that just happened to pick up a ridiculous sword."
Malazan,2km73j,helljumper23,3,Wed Oct 29 01:45:44 2014 UTC,He did kill a Forkrul Assail without use of his Hust sword though. Those guys are supposed to be pretty unstoppable.

Malazan,2km73j,ElmoTheNefarious,7,Wed Oct 29 10:00:16 2014 UTC,"I was thinking solely physical, but yeah, Quick Ben is scary. Brys is amazing. Tayschren was the highest of mages for a damn good reason. And holy SHIT, Yedan Derryg. I mean, seriously. Wow.  I'm not sure Iron Bars counts, since, y'know, he just sort of offhandedly killed Rhulad, but it was said (I cannot remember where) that he wasn't the best in the Crimson Guard.  I don't think Brood is a great fighter. Like Urko, he just hits you so hard he ends the fight immediately, but the problem is that he has issues hitting people.  Kilava isn't really powerful, I think. At least, not on the level of most of the rest. Magically, Quick Ben and Tayschren would paste her. Physically, Icarium, Karsa, Brys Beddict, Kallor, or Silchas Ruin would crush her as well."
Malazan,2km73j,KBKarma,2,Wed Oct 29 00:24:00 2014 UTC,"To be honest, we've never actually seen Caladan Brood do anything except for one swing of the hammer that didn't work out. That said, it's implied numerous times that he's comparable to Rake, and he does at one point step to Rake in MoI.   Iron Bars offhandedly killed Rhulad and like six other dudes. Dude's a monster. That said, you're probably right.   In DoD Silchas Ruin tells Olar Ethil that Kilava is more powerful than her. She's the oldest Imass Bonecaster. She's not the most powerful, but I'm not sure we've seen her go all out.  Brys is good, but it's really hard to say how good. He was the best in Letheras, but he took a wound beating Rhulad. Certainly worth consideration, though."
Malazan,2km73j,ElmoTheNefarious,1 point,Wed Oct 29 00:31:44 2014 UTC,"My reason for putting Brood lower is because, as I said, if he hits you, gg, game over, good night Irene. I forgot he was considered second only to Rake, though. That would be an interesting fight, but I think Rake would win. And then mourn, as he'd probably have to kill Brood.  My impression of the old gods is that they're mired in the past, and are thus less powerful. The Errant (bastard) is outwitted and beaten by humans. Silchas Ruin gets a face full of Moranth munitions and Quick Ben, and is soundly beaten. One of the only gods that's retained the majority of his power is probably Mael, as, while the Errant is revered in the weird little bubble of Letheras, Mael's got worship from the entire world. More to the point, he's hung around humans for a good long while. He knows that they can pull off some stupid shit that actually works. He's up to date. It's the equivalent of an ancient wizard coming to our world and using occult rituals to find knowledge, while the wizard that's been here for millennia exploring the world would probably use Wikipedia. So, it's not that Kilava is strong (though she probably is, now that I think of it), but Olar Ethil is weaker now. I thought it was alluded to or even outright stated at one point that the older gods are out of touch and newly reawoken.  Brys was determined to be the best guard of a monolith retaining the names of thirteen elder gods (that was my interpretation, at least). I think he really is that good."
Malazan,2km73j,KBKarma,1 point,Wed Oct 29 00:43:22 2014 UTC,"Again, I feel like we don't have enough info about Brood. I mean, we're assuming he's slow because he's a big guy with a hammer, but Karsa's a big guy with a two-hander and he's fast as hell.  The Errant's power has largely faded. Silchas Ruin is not an Elder God, unless I'm very much mistaken. That said, if we're considering gods, Draconus needs to be mentioned. Forged Dragnipur, one-shotted the jade thing...actually, we don't see him do too much, but he's definitely on Rake's level based on what other people say.  Mael's power is hard to determine. He deliberately avoids using it. This is why discussing physical combat is a lot easier, there are too many unknowns with magic."
Malazan,2km73j,ashemedai,1 point,Wed Oct 29 00:51:11 2014 UTC,"I'm basing it off the fact that that hammer is fucking heavy, but you have a point.   Silchas Ruin is an Ascendant, last I checked, and one of the original Soletaken. He is probably stupid powerful.   Variableness and fuzziness is probably why OP didn't mention magic originally. Physically, I think Mael is pretty boss normally, but Bugg doesn't show it. Olar Ethil is probably stronger than she looks, but no match for Rake or Ruin or the more imposing crowd."

He clearly says that Mok is way stronger than him and he's the Seguleh number three. Iron Bars says he ain't shit compared to Skinner...
Malazan,2km73j,ElmoTheNefarious,5,Wed Oct 29 01:02:06 2014 UTC,"I'll agree about Iron Bars, he's definitely not at the top.  Tool, though...he says Mok is faster, but remember that that's Sad Undead Tool. He's not at his best there. We've had this discussion on here before and as I recall the consensus was that Angry Undead Tool would curbstomp previous iterations. Also, he's a T'lan Imass. He acknowledges in MoI that Mok is the better swordsman, but Mok bleeds and Tool doesn't."

While Bars may not be as skilled as Skinner, (nor does he possess enchanted armour) he displays quite an.... Iron will.   I think bars is more closely linked to the vow, but Skinner is more skilled. Minus the armor I think bars would be tougher to kill, but Skinner is more deadly."

Malazan,2km73j,lykideus,10,Wed Nov 19 03:03:03 2014 UTC,"Here's my very incomplete ranking of some of the top fighters:  Bullshit Tier: Enraged Icarium  Tier 1: Rake, Dassem, Trull, Yedan Derryg  Tier 2: Karsa, Brys Beddict, Seguleh Second  Tier ??: Kallor, Whiskeyjack, Silchas Ruin, a lot of other people.  Reasoning:  Enraged Icarium should be obvious.  Rake and Dassem are legendary even to other people on the list. Trull managed to hold off Icarium by himself for a while, so he's amazing. I put Yedan Derryg in tier 1 because he straight up 1v1'd a Forkrul Assail, even before he got the Hust sword.  Karsa and friends got demolished by a Forkrul Assail in HoC, so he's clearly below Derryg. Edit: Even after he gets his stone sword and a ton more experience he still acknowledges that Dassem and Rake are on another level. Brys is really, really good, but since he's never fought someone that was really powerful it's hard to say exactly how good he his, so tier 2 is a safe bet. Seguleh second is very impressive, but just by definition has to be below Dassem.   I don't know where to place Kallor, because he's a seriously deadly motherfucker, but we don't see too much action from him. Same with Silchas. Whiskeyjack has to be on a similar level because he held his own against Kallor."
Malazan,2km73j,ginfish,9,Wed Oct 29 00:17:31 2014 UTC,"I suspect post-HoC Karsa would do a lot better against a Forkrul Assail, though I think tier 2 is the place for him. That said, if we're using the Forkrul Assail as a measure, let's throw Hood in for consideration. He butchers two of them without slowing down in TCG."
Malazan,2km73j,rabozza,8,Wed Oct 29 00:39:54 2014 UTC,"I'd put Whiskeyjack up there with Karsa and Brys. He's nearly as good as Dassem Ultor. It gets a very brief mention near the end of MoI, but Dujek stated that Dassem would use Whiskeyjack as his sparring partner back when he was First Sword. He says it took Dassem a good amount of time to be able to break Whiskeyjack's guard. He didn't just hold his own against Kallor, he had him reeling in a matter of seconds and fully extended himself to deliver a killing blow when his leg gave out."
Malazan,2km73j,ScottyBeans,3,Wed Oct 29 01:07:40 2014 UTC,"Karsa's fight with the FA was at the beginning of his story arch. In the years after that, he's been wandering about the world and getting stronger, smarter, and more seasoned.   For example, had Karsa fought Rhulad Sengar instead of the FA at that point, he would have definitely died, but he took it handily. I think you're selling him short. He might not be in Tier 1, but he is a half step above the Second and Brys."
Malazan,2km73j,drae-,3,Wed Oct 29 00:51:17 2014 UTC,I think the big thing everyone is missing about Karsa is that he gets SO much stronger as the series progresses.
Malazan,2km73j,montaron87td,3,Wed Oct 29 01:02:57 2014 UTC,Trull & Fear both agree that they wouldnt be able to defeat Brys... So if you put Trull up there... Brys is definitely up there.
Malazan,2km73j,herffjones99,2,Thu Oct 30 01:28:03 2014 UTC,Trull was pretty much stupefied when watching Brys fight wasn't he?
Malazan,2km73j,montaron87td,1 point,Mon Nov 17 20:37:54 2014 UTC,I thought just Fear said that?
Malazan,2km73j,herffjones99,1 point,Tue Nov 4 16:50:57 2014 UTC,Trull is also modest.
Malazan,2km73j,ScottyBeans,2,Wed Nov 19 02:23:44 2014 UTC,"I put Yedan Derryg in tier 1 because he straight up 1v1'd a Forkrul Assail, even before he got the Hust sword.   In that case, Hood should be in tier 1 or even bullshit tier as well. The dude didn't just beat an pure blood FA, he bit his face off, without the FA even having so much as a chance."
Malazan,2km73j,knottshiny,2,Wed Oct 29 10:04:30 2014 UTC,"I haven't read FoD, but isn't it implied at some point in the series that Hood might have actually won against death (which is why he's now death?)."
Malazan,2km73j,Aiolus,1 point,Mon Nov 17 06:20:47 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure who was sitting on the throne of Death at the time, I haven't read FoD either, but I know they went to war to fight death and then Hood betrayed everyone by claiming the throne for himself.  I suspect there was just another guy sitting on that throne, like Hood was for a few hundred thousand years and like the Bridgeburners are now and Hood killed him."
Malazan,2km73j,ginfish,1 point,Mon Nov 17 10:59:19 2014 UTC,I guess my point was that it takes a  special kind of badass to win in a fight against death.
Malazan,2km73j,Aiolus,1 point,Tue Nov 18 01:43:39 2014 UTC,"I feel like Brys and Karsa in the same tier doesn't make sense. If I picture them fighting, Karsa wins 10/10. Is that just me?"
Malazan,2km73j,ginfish,9,Tue Nov 4 16:52:29 2014 UTC,"I'm voting for Rake, he is able to manipulate his fight with Dassem to a point where Dassem's counter causes him to kill Rake with his own sword.  We have a good idea of Dassem's skill level it is well established. For Rake to be able to manipulate a fight with someone at that level has to be evidence of supreme skill."
Malazan,2km73j,ScottyBeans,2,Wed Oct 29 07:45:17 2014 UTC,Brilliant point.   The only person I can see that may be a class above Rake is Draconus.
Malazan,2km73j,Broncobacker,1 point,Wed Oct 29 13:58:25 2014 UTC,Wouldnt a enraged Icarium destroy Rake?
Malazan,2km73j,Broncobacker,2,Thu Oct 30 01:59:42 2014 UTC,"I have had both thoughts. Icarium of course is super powerful especially when he is full hulk.  However both Quick Ben and Trull fight an enraged Icarium and while they don't win they can stand. Karsa gets the jump on him and knocks him out.    Rake meanwhile is always at his best.  Cool, collected, brilliant in his power.  Perhaps Icarium could defeat him while super enraged but I have to say that Rake is the all around more powerful guy."
Malazan,2km73j,GuudeSpelur,1 point,Thu Oct 30 14:25:04 2014 UTC,I havnt yet seen the part where Quick Ben and Trull fight Icarium... but Icarium's definitely not enraged when Karsa has a fight with him.
Malazan,2km73j,Broncobacker,1 point,Fri Oct 31 01:12:40 2014 UTC,"Also, he just took on the weight of all the dead in Hood's realm right before the fight and was barely able to stand immediately before fighting Dassem. I think he's got everyone else beat by miles if he's unburdened."
Malazan,2km73j,ElmoTheNefarious,7,Tue Nov 4 16:46:08 2014 UTC,"Rake would obviously have to be up there. Also kalam, even tho alot of his kills tend to rely on stealth I think thats more out of necessity given the situations hes always in going against crazy numbers. He can def go toe to toe with anyone considering his unique combo of power and quickness."
Malazan,2km73j,drae-,5,Tue Oct 28 23:10:34 2014 UTC,"Oh almost forgot Trull. Shame on me. The dude took on Icarium in full blown lifestealer mode! If you take gods/ascendants out of the equation I would put the top 4 as kalam, trull, karsa, and traveler in no specific order"
Malazan,2km73j,ElmoTheNefarious,9,Tue Oct 28 23:16:17 2014 UTC,If you take gods/ascendants out of the equation  traveler   Traveller is a full blown god.
Malazan,2km73j,drae-,1 point,Wed Oct 29 00:08:07 2014 UTC,"Also, wouldn't you consider Trull and Karsa ascendants? They're both in the pantheon, and Karsa basically becomes his own warren."
Malazan,2km73j,Broncobacker,3,Wed Oct 29 00:10:58 2014 UTC,Yeah probably right.I was thinking we see enough of them and their abilities early on tho to consider purely their fighting skills prior to any advantages that come with ascending
Malazan,2km73j,Broncobacker,1 point,Wed Oct 29 00:43:34 2014 UTC,"Karsa becomes his own warren? I missed that.  I'm not sure I'd consider Trull an ascendant, but then again Erikson is so damn cagey about the whole thing that it's hard to say. That said, they're in the Deck of Dragons but I'm not sure that constitutes the pantheon per se."
Malazan,2km73j,ElmoTheNefarious,1 point,Wed Oct 29 00:34:15 2014 UTC,"Karsa is a warren, that's why he is practically immune to sorcery and why the he drags the souls of his victims around."
Malazan,2km73j,docforlife,1 point,Wed Nov 19 02:25:47 2014 UTC,I thought the immunity to sorcery was because the Teblor use otataral to make their bloodoil. Can you point me to some sources in the books?
Malazan,2km73j,SiroccoSC,1 point,Wed Nov 19 02:55:08 2014 UTC,"I only have moi with me, and I am on mobile, so no quote fu from me.   I understood that the forging of his sword involved creating a warren for the souls of his companions. Similar to mappos bag.  Now that you mention it I do recall mention of blood oil containing otataral."
Malazan,2km73j,Notalec,1 point,Wed Nov 19 03:18:44 2014 UTC,"Yeah I honestly never picked up on him being Dassem  just looked it up. Literally just finished my first read of the main 10 books yesterday, haven't jumped into ICE yet so probably not well informed enough for this thread"
Malazan,2km73j,ScottyBeans,2,Wed Oct 29 00:39:56 2014 UTC,"Rake would definitely be up there. I don't agree with Kalam. He's top notch as far as going up against humans/mages goes, but in a hand-to-hand fight he would have no chance against any of the ascendants"
Malazan,2km73j,Aiolus,3,Tue Oct 28 23:12:41 2014 UTC,Idk I think he could hold his own. I remeber there was a line about cotillion not wanting to take him on. But yea i agree he's not on like icariums level. if you're taking all ascendants into consideration it would have to be Rake imo
Malazan,2km73j,iamjoey,1 point,Tue Oct 28 23:33:09 2014 UTC,"Honestly, what we've seen from Cotillion (in Night of Knives and House of Chains) is way beyond anything Kalam's done, as badass as he was at the end of The Bonehunters. He's good, but even as far as assassins go he's not the best. He's better than Pearl, almost certainly better than Cutter and Rallick Nom, and probably on the level of Topper and Cowl, but even Kalam vs. Laseen or Kalam vs. Vorcan would be up in the air and I'm not sure where Apsalar weighs in."
Malazan,2km73j,iamjoey,3,Wed Oct 29 00:18:56 2014 UTC,When Cotillion unleashes his power through the shadow dancer in DOD/TCG........
Malazan,2km73j,PromisedPrince694,2,Wed Oct 29 00:55:21 2014 UTC,Hadn't even thought about that!
Malazan,2km73j,NinjaWombat,2,Wed Oct 29 05:46:45 2014 UTC,"After Apsalar kills all the Claw at the end of The Bonehunters, I think Shadowthrone mentions that even Dancer couldn't have done that. So I'd say that Apsalar is the best mortal assassin we see in the series."
Malazan,2km73j,KBKarma,2,Thu Oct 30 00:09:42 2014 UTC,"But then Cotillion possesses Lostara Yil in DoD and proves once again that you shouldn't take Shadowthrone at his word. Or perhaps Shadowthrone was talking past tense, mortal, not-a-god-yet Dancer."
Malazan,2km73j,Broncobacker,2,Thu Oct 30 00:38:19 2014 UTC,"Kalam is as badass as 'normal' people come, but I think against the bigger players (Karsa, Icarium, etc) he'd get smoked.  Would love to see him fight a CG avowed like Iron Bars, or maybe someone else like Gruntle, etc, to see where he really stacks up.  Sure is good at killing bucketfulls of Claws, though. I don't think Trull would have survived the flight at the end of the Bonehunters"
Malazan,2km73j,Kelset,3,Tue Nov 4 17:04:49 2014 UTC,Sword Fighters:    Rake Icarium Dassem Karsa Tool Silchas   Then you have another list of assassins. Who in a sword fight wouldn't be using their skill set perfectly. Then you have people like Raest who command immense magic which skews things all over the place.   After reading the series and FoD my bet on the two most powerful figures are;   Draconus  Rake   The great thing about Erikson is I wasn't able to tell who could defeat who on any given day.
Malazan,2km73j,Broncobacker,4,Wed Oct 29 13:55:25 2014 UTC,"I think Tool is seriously overlooked by many. I don't remember who said it, but in book one Tool is introduced as having 'no equal in this world'. It's just sad that we never really got to see him fight someone even close to being on his level."
Malazan,2km73j,StormyGesler,2,Wed Oct 29 18:18:02 2014 UTC,Dude he got whooped though by the Seguleh--we definitely have seen him fight people on his level.
Malazan,2km73j,ScottyBeans,1 point,Wed Oct 29 19:10:18 2014 UTC,"Hmmm I can't remember this.. I remember him knocking out the two other Seguleh with the flat of his sword, but I can't remember him fighting the third. I'm nearly approaching MOI in my reread, I need to keep a look out for this."
Malazan,2km73j,KBKarma,1 point,Thu Oct 30 18:39:52 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it happens when they are rescuing Toc from the Pannion Seer's crib"
Malazan,2km73j,KBKarma,2,Thu Oct 30 20:15:46 2014 UTC,"In Memories of Ice, Mok beats Tool. Tool is saved by Kilava and he acknowledges that Mok is the greater fighter. Mok is the Seguleh Third."
Malazan,2km73j,KBKarma,3,Thu Oct 30 02:48:00 2014 UTC,"Are we talking pure weapons skill, or adding in extra powers? Because Icarium is a monster obviously, but he's also using warrens out the wazoo once he gets wound up.  If we're talking pure skill, the top three would probably be Traveller, Trull and Brys? Brys is a tough one because we actually have no basis on which to compare him. He doesn't take on any Seguleh at any point, nor does he cross blades with any of the other big names in the books except for Rhulad.  If we add in total package, Icarium is hard to beat. There isn't a person/thing alive who isn't terrified of him for good reason. This is a guy who has wandered the world for thousands of years, and when he throws a temper tantrum entire civilizations get destroyed."
Malazan,2km73j,lordofsoup,2,Wed Oct 29 00:21:30 2014 UTC,"Karsa murders a god. Then again, so does Traveller. And said other god fights back. And Karsa and Icarium knocked each other out. Urko got in a lucky hit; I think he's not a good fighter, but if he hits you, you're going to feel it for a good long while.  I think the top is Karsa, Traveller, and Icarium. In no specific order."
Malazan,2km73j,lordofsoup,2,Tue Oct 28 22:50:41 2014 UTC,"All your points are good, but what about Skinner? What about the Seguleh number one?  I think there are a lot great people we're not taking into consideration.  Also, Icarium doesn't seem like anything special unless he's in beast mode, so I feel like he deserves an asterisk by his name."
Malazan,2km73j,ElmoTheNefarious,4,Tue Oct 28 23:04:38 2014 UTC,Isn't Rake considered the 1 by the segulah?
Malazan,2km73j,ElmoTheNefarious,5,Tue Oct 28 23:34:24 2014 UTC,"Rake was seventh, iirc. Then he used a Warren to escape and rest because they kept fighting him."
Malazan,2km73j,ElmoTheNefarious,2,Tue Oct 28 23:38:33 2014 UTC,Yup your right
Malazan,2km73j,ElmoTheNefarious,4,Tue Oct 28 23:43:56 2014 UTC,"Rake probably would have been able to become 1st, but I think he just got annoyed by the whole segulah way of living and bounced"
Malazan,2km73j,Broncobacker,2,Wed Oct 29 00:17:45 2014 UTC,I also got that vibe...if by 'way of living' you mean strolling around their Island acting cocky and not understanding why people were attacking him so often
Malazan,2km73j,ElmoTheNefarious,2,Tue Nov 4 17:12:40 2014 UTC,"I can't recall seeing the First fight. And I've not seen Skinner in the main series.  I will give you that point about Icarium, though. I'll add Trull to that list, though, unreservedly. And add Tool in as a close second to them."
Malazan,2km73j,mmSNAKE,1 point,Tue Oct 28 23:09:53 2014 UTC,"Nah about Tool. He's a boss of course, but he says that the Seguleh Third was way more than a match for him. And then there's the Seguleh Second, who was Hood's servant."
Malazan,2km73j,KBKarma,3,Tue Oct 28 23:11:20 2014 UTC,"Hence putting him second. Though perhaps third or fourth would be more appropriate. Apparently, Daseem Ultor is now First, and Mok is a broken man and is no longer Third."
Malazan,2km73j,ScottyBeans,1 point,Tue Oct 28 23:17:05 2014 UTC,Where did you hear that Dassem was the first?
Malazan,2km73j,StormyGesler,2,Wed Oct 29 00:09:51 2014 UTC,"Orb, Sceptre, Throne"
Malazan,2km73j,ElmoTheNefarious,1 point,Wed Oct 29 00:16:11 2014 UTC,Wait I thought Dassem was the First.
Malazan,2km73j,StormyGesler,1 point,Wed Oct 29 02:21:02 2014 UTC,Yeah apparently he is. I'm on Stonewielder so I haven't gotten there yet it OST...

Malazan,2km73j,StormyGesler,0,Wed Oct 29 02:24:16 2014 UTC,Yedan Derryg. Stop forgetting Yedan Derryg. His last stand was flat-out the single most impressive feat of arms in the entire series.
Malazan,2km73j,FreddeCheese,5,Wed Oct 29 00:19:43 2014 UTC,"Yeah... but that was largely the Hust sword. Before that he was good, but he was barely able to handle a handful of Liosan. The likes of Dassem could have handled that with his eyes closed."
Malazan,2km73j,growingshadow,0,Wed Oct 29 01:54:39 2014 UTC,"I'm not really sure how much of that can be attributed to the sword. Also, he took down a Forkrul Assail on his own. That's gotta count for something."
Malazan,2km73j,growingshadow,2,Wed Oct 29 01:58:27 2014 UTC,"Yeah, but I take that as having mostly to do with getting underestimated and the fact that the FA are a bit overrated. There are a bunch of people who take them down.  I'd personally put him at about Brys' level without the Hust Sword."
Malazan,2km73j,MoranthMunitions,3,Wed Oct 29 02:07:22 2014 UTC,"Off the top of my head:  Hood kills 2 like a boss.  Badelle yells 2 to death.  Yedan Derryg takes one down.  2 Kenryllah (or is it Kenyllrah? the tougher ones, anyways) fight one, we don't see the conclusion but presumably they eventually finish it off.  Sechul Lath took the form of a Forkrul Assail, iirc, and Draconus took him down.  And then a bunch of shit goes down in TCG and I don't remember the details. That's all I can remember, any I'm missing?  They're pretty tough. They can shrug off substantial wounds, posses immense strength, move extremely fast, and obviously the whole voice thing. For a mortal human to take one down is a pretty impressive feat. I think you might be selling Yedan Derryg a bit short, but then I can't really remember much detail about how Hust swords work."
Malazan,2km73j,Decstarr,3,Wed Oct 29 02:26:38 2014 UTC,"Kalam with help from Quick took one down as well. And I think that some others die somehow in TCG. Gesler+Bent nearly killed their leader had Gesler not been so sentimental.  As far as what the sword did for Yedan, it seemed to be acting like some sort of super drug or something that pushed him well past human levels of endurance and wouldn't let him rest until all the Hounds and Dragons were dead. I do think that he is awesome on his own, but in more of a Brys or Seguleh sort of way rather than a Rake or Dassem or Karsa sort of way."
Malazan,2km73j,Decstarr,3,Wed Oct 29 03:10:54 2014 UTC,"To be fair, all three you named carry magic swords themselves :P"
Malazan,2km73j,Decstarr,3,Wed Oct 29 03:41:22 2014 UTC,"Rake killed the person who carried his sword (which Yedan probably couldn't even lift), Dassem was literally a god and nearly untouchable before picking up his sword, and Karsa actually helped make his in a manner which no T'lann Imass ever able to do. Their weapons are either secondary or an innate part of their abilities."
Malazan,2km73j,Wizardof1000Kings,1 point,Wed Oct 29 06:45:31 2014 UTC,When does this happen? Can't remember it at all.
Malazan,2km73j,Jester814,2,Wed Oct 29 03:11:26 2014 UTC,On the Road before they get to Kharkanas. He goes off the road and fights some Tiste Liaosan and a Forkrul Assail.
Malazan,2kjiye,BurtMachlen937,6,Tue Oct 28 05:12:54 2014 UTC,"You're right, people hype up Gardens as being some crazy plot maze, but it isn't that complicated. The difficult part for a new reader is that they are just thrown into this strange new world and Erickson stays pretty tight-lipped about explaining a lot of the things that many other writers would give a detailed background on."
Malazan,2kjiye,VordakKallager,3,Tue Oct 28 07:41:27 2014 UTC,"Exactly, I think Gardens actually has one of the easier to follow plots (currently about halfway through The Crippled God).  The only complication comes in trying to figure out how the Malazan universe, especially the magic, works and that clears itself up with simply reading more and figuring it out."
Malazan,2kjiye,handsomesteve88,1 point,Tue Oct 28 19:40:19 2014 UTC,"X-Ray feature in kindle really helped me with Gardens of the Moon. Barely used it in Deadhouse Gates, which I finished today. And about that, ho lee fuc king shit! DG is a roller coaster! I really really recommend sticking with GotM new readers. Your patience will be repaid and some in deserts of Raraku. So many great characters, so much plot explained. My nails are not gonna grow for a while."
Malazan,2kjiye,ohpuic,2,Fri Oct 31 21:25:25 2014 UTC,"The difficulty of the first book is basically the first 3-4 chapters where you're bombarded by concepts totally foreign to you in a very bare-bones expository way. Also the character and place names are bandied about at such a fast rate that even in the prologue you're left reeling, who's who? Who's significant? What's a warren? Who're the protagonists? Whose side is who on? etc."
Malazan,2kjiye,Tayschrenn,1 point,Tue Oct 28 09:10:11 2014 UTC,I am rereading it for the first time right now and gave a whole new appreciation for it. It's wonderfully written
Malazan,2kjiye,copypastepuke,1 point,Tue Oct 28 11:48:25 2014 UTC,"Thats true, he always seems to give you reminders when its been awhile and he knows you probably forgot something. Good guy author. Still, even though the plot isn't all that difficult to follow, the first book still left me with more questions than answers. I think thats what people mean when they talk about it. Thats why I wanted to keep reading though!"
Malazan,2kjiye,crownedether,1 point,Tue Oct 28 15:25:53 2014 UTC,I think the main problem I had when reading the first book we're trying to follow what a Tlan Imass was or a Jaghut tyrant. Also the warrens confused the shit out of me lol. Basically still do in a way.
Malazan,2kjiye,SerBronnofBlackwater,1 point,Tue Oct 28 20:12:15 2014 UTC,"I feel the same way as you, but I think a lot of people are building the book up in the wrong manner.  It's not really the plot or even the characters so much that can be confusing but rather names and vocabulary.  I remember it taking a long time for me to realize Pale was a city.  And Sorry was a person.  Things like that.  Erikson obviously was inspired by Glen Cook for his naming conventions.  Once you're able to identify what each noun he's created identifies the books become magnificent.  There's so much life in these novels it's crazy.  I'm not a huge fan of Erikson's personality as I feel he's a bit pompous but he has every right to be with such great world-building.  Congrats on making it through, I hope you can spread the word about these books in a similar manner as you've described!"
Malazan,2kjiye,ZeppelinJ0,1 point,Thu Oct 30 03:25:53 2014 UTC,I'm about halfway through DG and am listening to the Audiobooks. I had the same fear but really had no trouble following it at all.
Malazan,2kfhbw,mrsegraves,22,Mon Oct 27 02:59:51 2014 UTC,"Tehol and Bugg are my favorite characters in the series. Stick with it, it's hilarious and sets the scene for a lot of the remainder of Malazan."
Malazan,2kfhbw,lykideus,2,Mon Oct 27 03:33:29 2014 UTC,Completely this. The comedy's gold and you're gonna care about these two if you keep reading.
Malazan,2kfhbw,Poser1313,11,Mon Oct 27 04:25:28 2014 UTC,"When Erikson starts entire new plot lines and introduces new characters, it can be a slow start. I think MT puts some people off because of the momentum they've picked up in the first 4 books, which is seemingly lost - but don't get hung up on that. It may seem like a bump in the road but it's a fantastic story, and like many of the others, it's a slow burn. Even if it ends up being your least favourite of all ten, don't skip it. It's setting up one of the major plot arcs of the whole series, and it gets substantially better."
Malazan,2kfhbw,TurboS40,9,Mon Oct 27 11:55:08 2014 UTC,"I'm about 70% into Midnight Tides and it's progressively become more interesting. I was also a bit bored with it at first. Bug and Tehol, Trull, the quirkiness of the Ceda, and Kettle have me thoroughly hooked.   But I also know that this is Trull's whole backstory so I expected to slog through it a bit."
Malazan,2kfhbw,lilpin13,3,Mon Oct 27 03:18:50 2014 UTC,"See, that's the thing. I LIKED Trull in House of Chains but here... He's just so bland. I definitely want to know why he got excommunicated, but I'm not digging the set up so far."
Malazan,2kfhbw,lilpin13,9,Mon Oct 27 04:07:08 2014 UTC,"To me, he's not bland... he's struggling with his own feelings and how they are the exact opposite of what he was taught his whole life. He ""should be"" feeling similarly to how his brothers are feeling but he's doesn't. He's constantly walking on eggshells so he doesn't offend his family and his village and so he doesn't dishonor his family within the tribe (which would be devastating to his family for a very long time, if not, forever). He gets progressively more and more morose, sarcastic, and cynical, leading up to the massive falling out with his tribe.   He's a taunt string about to snap and I'm looking forward to reading event and the fallout.   But I can see what you're saying."
Malazan,2kfhbw,JediMasterZao,3,Mon Oct 27 04:28:43 2014 UTC,He's a taunt string    I think the word you're looking for is taut.

Malazan,2kfhbw,MoranthMunitions,5,Mon Oct 27 14:15:41 2014 UTC,"Trull easily became one of my favourite characters in the series, the book becomes better especially towards the end like all of the Malazan books.  Really a lot of the book is setting the scene for Reaper's Gale, as the entire continent is fairly different to the others which are fairly fleshed out so it just takes a bit of time. After half to two thirds of the way through it's perfectly fine, most of the world building is done and the story seems to come through more."
Malazan,2kfhbw,milk72,3,Mon Oct 27 05:06:09 2014 UTC,See I hated trull in HOC and am halfway through midnight tides and like him WAY more. The story gets good right about where I'm at at the end of book 2.
Malazan,2kfhbw,grixa,1 point,Mon Oct 27 17:56:32 2014 UTC,You have not seen the best of him yet.  Trull gets better and better as a character. I got very attached to him and was one of my favourites for been such a nice and humble badass guy.
Malazan,2kfhbw,absolut696,2,Mon Oct 27 19:00:10 2014 UTC,"Trull is one of the best characters in the series, and the whole Lether storyline ties in later on with a pretty awesome payoff. Stick with it. I'm on my first re-read and just started midnight tides and I'm loving it. I felt the same way as you on my first time reading, I was like wtf a new storyline with new characters? But just trust me when I tell you it's for the best."
Malazan,2kfhbw,conniedarko,7,Tue Oct 28 02:39:40 2014 UTC,"Took me a while to get into that storyline too, but it is definitely worth it. Some of the best characters (as far as I've read) come out of it."
Malazan,2kfhbw,SerBronnofBlackwater,5,Mon Oct 27 03:36:24 2014 UTC,"I felt the same first time around. But I was hooked halfway into it. Loved Brys, Tehol, Bugg and Ublala so that kept me going. Also iron bars later."
Malazan,2kfhbw,AllWrong74,5,Mon Oct 27 03:43:20 2014 UTC,"I didn't like Midnight Tides at all.  I struggled through the whole book.  The only characters I did like were Trull Sengar and Brys Beddict (I'm not a huge Tehol & Bugg fan, which is a blasphemy among MBotF fans).  Slog your way through it.  The book is necessary (and takes place around the time (or just before) the Siege of Pale at the beginning of Gardens of the Moon).  When they come back to Lether in Reaper's Gale it will be far better.  I was really worried I wouldn't be able to make my way through another Lether based book, but RG was a treat to read (plus, it has Beak).  tl;dr: I wasn't a big fan, either.  The book is necessary, so just slog through it."
Malazan,2kfhbw,LegSpinner,3,Mon Oct 27 06:36:46 2014 UTC,"MT actually has some brilliant stuff:   Great dialogue Shakespearean writing (won't elaborate further) Kick-ass fight scenes at the end   Most of all it provides the backbone for almost the entirety of the rest of the series. Can't be skipped, and it will grow on you."

Malazan,2kfhbw,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Mon Oct 27 15:13:58 2014 UTC,The grammar or the stories? My hint was that the story in MT has a parallel with one of Shakespeare's finest.
Malazan,2kfhbw,montaron87td,2,Mon Oct 27 15:38:46 2014 UTC,"I don't particularly like the language in Shakespeare, and I find he typically only delivers interesting content in the first and last acts of a play- everything in the middle is boring filler, akin to an open world game with nothing but fetch quests on the side. I do like Julius Caesar, but even some of the other ones that are interesting plotwise, there is just that huge middle part that is completely boring and unnecessary- I'm looking at you, Macbeth!  That said, if it simply has a parallel with regards to plot, I can dig it. After all, I am a Sons of Anarchy fan and that drew from Shakespeare in plot construction."
Malazan,2kfhbw,Sopp90,3,Mon Oct 27 15:52:45 2014 UTC,"Do NOT skip it. Midnight Tides was my least favorite book as well and by the time I was finished with it I saw how it was all going to come together and now it's one of my favorites. I'm sorry your not liking it, but I implore you to just keep reading. Enjoy the Tehol and Bugg mystery/banter and how Trull's story slowly unfolds."

I found new characters refreshing, I loved everybody's motivations and complex histories, and was amazed when it all finally linked up with other characters I knew.  I feel like everybody should stop posting here when they're like ""man, these characters are weird, I don't like them.""  When you've got the entire series left to finish.  These characters don't just disappear, they grow and change, mature and maybe even die.    If you don't want to read, stop reading.  If you want to keep reading, keep reading.  I'm getting pretty tired of whiners, so excuse my bluntness.  It's like you've never had characters you don't like in a story before, or understood that a story isn't over until the last page reads ""the end.""  ""Does it get any better?""< is the exact type of statement I'm talking about.  So self-absorbed, that the story doesn't live up to your requirements of an ""easy read""."

You made a fuck ton (which is 3.5 shit loads) of assumptions, and then jumped all over /u/mrsegraves for your assumptions.  You're the only person that brought up an easy read.  It's also perfectly understandable for a person to seek assurance that the story picks up, if they aren't enjoying a book at all.  If it doesn't pick up, then the reader is forewarned and can then decide to put the series down, or just slog through the book.  There's nothing whiney about this, regardless of what you want to say.  Your attack was completely uncalled for.  Enjoy the downvote, you're the first one I've bothered to give out in a month or two, but you definitely earned it."

And 90% of the comments are ""Oh man, it's totally worth it, just keep going!""  We're hand-holding when Erikson himself does not.  Also, he wrote that he's finding it tough to read, in a negative connotation. That implies OP is looking for an easier read."
Malazan,2kfhbw,grixa,2,Mon Oct 27 14:07:31 2014 UTC,"Tough to read, as in the book is boring as hell and I'm finding it tough to keep reading because of lack of interest. Seriously, did you even read my post?"
Malazan,2kfhbw,Foliagus,-1,Mon Oct 27 15:18:24 2014 UTC,"I did! I responded to those points.  The series may have downtimes, it's a tough read.   Coming here for a bunch of people to pat you on the back and say ""there, there buddy, it's ok."" as you sniffle, is what I take issue with.  lol you haven't even finished the book yet, and you're complaining about it.  Go ahead, am I wrong there?   Go away, finish the series, you'll come back going ""holy shit, that was so worth it."" Everybody does, barring those too bothered by a single thing they don't like.  Somebody was here just weeks ago whining about Karsa being too vicious for the poster's delicate stomach.   Guess who hadn't finished the series yet, or even the book?  That guy!"
Malazan,2kfhbw,Foliagus,3,Mon Oct 27 15:27:29 2014 UTC,"Ok, that person probably wanted to know if the series stayed that violent, right? If they don't like that kind of violence, then why would they want to continue reading a book or a series where such violence is prevalent? It's totally valid to ask for the opinions of those who HAVE read the books as to the content of those books- it really is helpful to know what sort of content to expect in the future.  I'm not looking for people to pat me on the back. I'm looking for people who felt similarly to how I am feeling about Midnight Tides to tell me how they felt about the book after finishing it. I don't need to finish a book to know whether I like it or not. Case in point: I knew less than a quarter of the way through Catcher in the Rye that that book was complete garbage. After finishing it, I still felt that way. I'm HOPING that Midnight Tides gets more interesting and less all over the place by the end, but as of right now, I am not enjoying it. It would be helpful for me to know whether it becomes more focused, because I don't have a great amount of time to sit down and read books, so I don't want to waste my time with a book I'm not going to enjoy.  As others have said, get off your high horse. If you don't like the way this sub is, then YOU go away. You've been the least friendly, least helpful individual I've encountered here. It seems that YOU are the problem here, not this sub."
Malazan,2kfhbw,grixa,1 point,Mon Oct 27 15:43:14 2014 UTC,"To be fair, violence AND slow starts are hallmarks of this series, so I think it's a fair comparison for u/Foliagus to make.  The fact that you were able to rip through the first 3 books is amazing I offer you my admiration!  I completely empathize with your plight... I tend to take a month to get through the first 25% of each novel, then a couple of weeks for the next 50%, then the last 25% goes by in a few days!  Really, for me, the only novel that I was able to rip through was HoC, but I'm only up to RG now and it's been a slow start as well.  I can understand u/Foliagus' frustrations... readers complaining about slow pacing is a very common theme on this sub because it's simply the style of Erikson's series. It's like complaining that Tolkien's books contain too much emphasis on language and backstory."
Malazan,2kfhbw,Foliagus,1 point,Mon Oct 27 17:52:00 2014 UTC,"I don't mind slow pacing- I love the slow burn (Breaking Bad is a great example of the slow burn)- but I do mind when the slow burn is boring. This book has not started off at all like the past 4 books (which I read all of in less than 2 months). Yes, they had relatively slow build ups, but the build ups were compelling.   He specifically mentioned Karsa's violence, which I think is quite a bit different from the other violence seen up until his introduction (though the Pannion Domin was a nasty bit of reading)- it's just so personal and in your face, with Karsa constantly thinking about doing awful things to people. I completely understand not liking that (I am a huge fan of Karsa, by the way), and it's totally fair to want to know if that is normal for the series, or if it's an isolated incident. If isolated, forge ahead, reader! If not, then maybe the reader shouldn't continue, as they will likely be disgusted with everything that follows."
Malazan,2kfhbw,Foliagus,1 point,Mon Oct 27 18:05:23 2014 UTC,"I had to put down DG a few times based on the nature of the violence and the victims. That was the first time I actually considered giving up on the series. Once I considered that the author might actually feel the same way about the violence, and was trying to impart that specific emotional reaction, I was back in... along for the ride so to speak."
Malazan,2kfhbw,anelusiveginger,-1,Mon Oct 27 18:20:15 2014 UTC,"Haha I await your return, where hopefully you can let us know if it was worth your time.  I can't change your mind about your thoughts, but I can definitely tell you that I disagree with them.  By telling you this, hopefully I dissuade somebody else from using this as a reader's support group, and filling the sub with dull, subjective concerns.  My high horse isn't so high. I didn't come with every little thing that bothered me, to this sub. I decided to ""risk"" it, of my own volition. I figured I didn't want to sound needy, or filled with pathos. It was worth it, in the end."
Malazan,2ke0gn,CotillionTheRope,20,Sun Oct 26 18:38:46 2014 UTC,"“There is something profoundly cynical, my friends, in the notion of paradise after death. The lure is evasion. The promise is excusative. One need not accept responsibility for the world as it is, and by extension, one need do nothing about it. To strive for change, for true goodness in this mortal world, one must acknowledge and accept, within one's own soul, that this mortal reality has purpose in itself, that its greatest value is not for us, but for our children and their children. To view life as but a quick passage alone a foul, tortured path – made foul and tortured by our own indifference – is to excuse all manner of misery and depravity, and to exact cruel punishment upon the innocent lives to come.  I defy this notion of paradise beyond the gates of bone. If the soul truly survives the passage, then it behooves us – each of us, my friends – to nurture a faith in similitude: what awaits us is a reflection of what we leave behind, and in the squandering of our mortal existence, we surrender the opportunity to learn the ways of goodness, the practice of sympathy, empathy, compassion and healing – all passed by in our rush to arrive at a place of glory and beauty, a place we did not earn, and most certainly do not deserve.”   From The Bonehunters."

I like this one because several characters in MT say the first line of this text as a positive quote. I think that's probably why the Eternal Domicile is built with five wings. They know that five wings will buy them a grovel. It's amusing cause if you know the full text, the part they quote suddenly doesn't sound like a very good thing to invoke at all.  It kind of reminds me of the quote, ""blood is thicker than water."" Most people use it to mean family is important. I've heard it written that the full quote is, ""The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb."" It puts a very different spin on things, if that is true.  I suppose I should mention that there's no date given for when this passage was created by Fintrothas, so it's possible the passage was written after shit goes down in RG. If that's the case it wouldn't be nearly as amusing, but I don't see anyway to tell if my interpretation is right or wrong for sure."

'But you have seen all the tracks of men,' said I 'And where the mothers and children have fled Before your advance. Is there naught among them That you might set an old man upon?'  The surgeon among this rook had bones Under her vellum skin like a maker of limbs 'Old one,' said she, 'I have dwelt In the heat of chests, among heart and lungs,  And slid like a serpent between muscles, Swum the currents of slowing blood, And all these roads lead into the darkness Where the broken will at last rest.  Dare say I,' she went on, 'there is no Place waiting inside where you might find In slithering exploration of mysteries All that you so boldly call the best in us.'  And the man with shovel and pick, Who could raise for and berm in a day Timbered of thought and measured in all things Set the gauge of his eyes upon the sun  And said, 'Look not in temples proud, Or in the palaces of the rich highborn, We have razed each in turn in our time To melt gold from icon and shrine  And of all the treasures weeping in fire There was naught but the smile of greed And the thick power of possession. Know then this: all roads before you  From the beginning of the ages past And those now upon us, yield no clue To the secret equations you seek, For each was built of bone and blood  And the backs of the slave did bow To the laboured sentence of a life In chains of dire need and little worth. All that we build one day echos hollow.'  'Where then, good soldiers, will I Ever find all that is best in us? If not in flesh or temple bound Or wretched road of cobbled stone?'  'Could we answer you,' said the sergeant, 'This blood would cease its fatal flow, And my surgeon could seal wounds with a touch, All labours will ease before temple and road,  Could we answer you,' said the sergeant, 'Crows might starve in our company And our talons we would cast in bogs For the gods to fight over as they will.  But we have not found in all our years The best in us, until this very day' 'How so,' asked I, so lost now on the road, And said he, Upon this bridge we sat  Since the dawn's bleak arrival, Our perch of despond so weary and worn, And you we watched, at first a speck Upon the strife-painted horizon  So tortured in your tread as to soak our faces In the wonder of your will, yet on you came Upon two sticks so bowed in weight Seeking, say you, the best in us  And now we have seen in your gift The best in us, and were treasures at hand We would set them humbly before you, A man without feet who walked a road.'  Now, soldiers with kind words are rare Enough, and I welcomed their regard As I moved among them, 'cross the bridge And onward to the long road beyond  I travel seeking the best in us And one day it shall rise before me To bless this journey of mine, and this road I began upon long ago shall now end Where waits for all the best in us   Where Ravens Perch   Avas Didion Flicker"
Malazan,2ke0gn,crownedether,-1,Wed Oct 29 05:10:22 2014 UTC,Am I the only one who just stopped reading these like 3 books in? I am too impatient to get to the story >.<
Malazan,2ke0gn,AllWrong74,-5,Mon Oct 27 16:43:58 2014 UTC,"Honestly?  I only read the pre-chapter stuff by certain authors/books.  Brandon Sanderson, because it's important to the books.  Ender's Game because I like Graff's self-deprecating humor.  That sort of situation."
Malazan,2ke0gn,bcleary,3,Mon Oct 27 06:33:04 2014 UTC,The pre-chapter stuff here is important to the books. I don't know if you've read any but a lot of them either are preludes to future events or references to past events within the universe.
Malazan,2ke0gn,analton,3,Mon Oct 27 16:16:17 2014 UTC,"THIS.  I'm re-reading Gardens of the Moon and just discovered a reference to the Thelomen Toblakai. It has absolutely no reason to be there, but...   ""Thelomen Tartheno Toblakai… find the names of a people so reluctant to fade into oblivion… Their legend rots my cynical cast and blights my eyes with bright glory… 'Cross not the loyal cage embracing their unassailable heart…  …Cross not these stolid menhirs, ever loyal to the earth.'

Your best bet is to ask a question and hope the people in the community start to discuss it.   I mean if you're looking for something like a Tolkien wiki or the Wiki of Ice and Fire then no, you're going to be eternally disappointed. Malazan, unfortunately, doesn't have the same amount of fans as fantasy in the mainstream media. I'd argue that most fantasy series lack the fanbase of ASOIAF or Harry Potter."
Malazan,2ka0fk,bantuftw,11,Sat Oct 25 10:57:51 2014 UTC,"Firstly, please edit the beginning of your post with SPOILERS ALERT! or somesuch.  Some of the answers you are asking about are spoilers for people still on GotM.   What is the difference between a god and an ascendant ? Is there any difference at all ?   Essentially, when people start worshiping an Ascendant, he becomes a god.  It seems to come with a (variable) power boost, but the downside is that the beliefs of the worshipers trap the now-god.  He starts to behave the way they believe, have weaknesses they believe, etc.   Did Shadowthrone and Cotillion not exist until Kellanved and Dancer ascended ? Did they become the ""new"" ascendants/gods ?   Exactly right.  Shadowthrone and Cotillion didn't exist before Kellanved and Dancer Ascended.   It's somewhere mentioned that the Hounds are a thousand years old, or something like that, so I assume that Shadowthrone also 1000 years old, but Kellanved died something like 0-20 years ago, so... what ?   The quick, only slightly spoilerish answer to that is, Shadowthrone Spoiler   And there was the part with Quick Ben doing... something to Shadowthrone (what was that again ? :D) and Shadowthrone recognised Quick Ben (he was a high priest of shadow of something ?). Does their meeting have any significance ? Quick Ben didn't seem to know about Kellanved and Dancer I assume.   Two answers to this.  First, never assume you know what Quick Ben knows and doesn't know, you're almost certain to be wrong.  Second answer, RAFO.   Should I read the novels as well ?   I assume you are referring to the books by Ian C. Esselmont (known here as ICE).  I'm told you really should, if for no other reason than the info gained about the world in his books.  I'm having trouble with RotCG, so I can't answer this well.   but not sure in what order I should read them   Check out the sidebar for this.   Or should I read them after I finished the main series ?   The most popular answer to this usually is to read the Malazan Book of the Fallen (the Erikson novels, not including the novellas), then read the Tales of the Malazan Empire series (the ICE books).   I would interpret them as some kind of portals to some another realm   Yes, and magic use is essentially the mage using the energy of these realms to create spell effects.   and all of those have different ascendants/gods.   Not necessarily   Small thing I noticed, may not even be the case, but I see the word ""tattered"" being used a lot since Tattersail's death/being reborn or whatever. Does the author do this to keep her ""part of the story"". Because everytime I see the word I remember her . :)   I've never seen him mention it (and Erikson is a very methodical writer, he intends just about everything), so it's probably just word association on your part."
Malazan,2ka0fk,AllWrong74,3,Sat Oct 25 11:19:41 2014 UTC,"Thank you for your (quick) answer, one more question came to my mind. What do readers consider to be the best book of the main series ?"
Malazan,2ka0fk,TygettLannister,10,Sat Oct 25 11:26:46 2014 UTC,"That one really falls to personal choice.  A lot of people really like Midnight Tides (my least favorite book in the series).  My favorite was, hands down, Deadhouse Gates.  Then, I got to Toll the Hounds.  The last half of TtH is, without a doubt, the best ending to any book I've ever read (and I've been a heavy reader for more than 30 years).  The last half of DG was the best ending I'd ever read until I got to TtH.  The most popular favorite books (in no particular order) seem to be:   Toll the Hounds Memories of Ice Midnight Tides The Crippled God"
Malazan,2ka0fk,SageOfTheWise,2,Sat Oct 25 11:53:21 2014 UTC,"My favourite was Memories of Ice, since it heavily featured my favourite character Whiskeyjack. Of course I'm still only on Bonehunters, but MoI is one of the best books I've ever read if only for the sheer emotional roller-coaster it took me on."
Malazan,2ka0fk,Foliagus,2,Sat Oct 25 15:40:37 2014 UTC,It really varies from person to person. Mine is either The Bonehunters (6th book) or Toll The Hounds (8th book).
Malazan,2ka0fk,Foliagus,2,Sat Oct 25 16:22:08 2014 UTC,"My favourites were Deadhouse Gates and Midnight Tides, but the last 3 also brought SO MUCH to the series.  Memories of Ice is phenomenal as well, same with Toll the Hounds and Bonehunters/House of chains.  THEY'RE ALL SOO GOOD>  Also, stop asking questions, in my opinion dude.  Keep the surprise up.  Everything will be answered in the end."
Malazan,2ka0fk,Poser1313,2,Sun Oct 26 09:19:11 2014 UTC,I just assumed it was something I missed while reading.
Malazan,2ka0fk,Heavy_Industries,3,Sun Oct 26 10:00:17 2014 UTC,"Nah. This series is infamous for a ""I have no idea what's going on, but it's epic"" first book.  By the time you finish book 3, you have a more solid grasp on what the malazans, and the bridgeburners, represent."
Malazan,2ka0fk,Garph,4,Sun Oct 26 18:10:27 2014 UTC,"Erikson is extremely deliberate with his word choice and sentence structure, so your reading into the use of 'tattered' is totally justified.   As you read on you may also notice the word 'chains' being used every once in a while..."
Malazan,2ka0fk,Heavy_Industries,1 point,Sat Oct 25 16:09:02 2014 UTC,I think he uses tattered to resonate with T'lan meaning broken/shattered/tattered-ish and a part of the story that will be revealed once you get to MOI.

Malazan,2ka0fk,SageOfTheWise,2,Sat Oct 25 15:15:57 2014 UTC,"I think that was my big divide.  I finished 3 and then went ""Well fuck, this is better.""  By the time you get to Bonehunters, and then again at the end, you've said it again twice.  Now I'm re-reading the entire series, which I was never motivated to do, with Game of Thrones.  The sheer depth and complexity, the elaborate constructions, ahhhh."
Malazan,2ka0fk,TisteSimeon,1 point,Sun Oct 26 09:21:31 2014 UTC,"with Game of Thrones.   You mean ASOIAF, or just the first book, which is ""A Game of Thrones"" ?  I've re-read ASOIAF myself and enjoyed it more the 2nd time around. I might do it with Malazan later, or at least GotM, because I had no idea about what was happening a lot of times."
Malazan,2ka0fk,SageOfTheWise,3,Sun Oct 26 09:58:30 2014 UTC,"The level of mystery and unresolved detail is much higher in this series.  Also erikson foreshadows excellently. There's huge details in the last book that were mentioned in gardens, only to have you go ""so thaaaaats what he meant!""  In game of thrones, you get more detail I guess, but there isn't as much of that ""thoughtful planning"", it seems.  I mean, I'm 90% sure that Jon snow is raegar's bastard love child, and so is the general population.  You can't make any assumptions like that in Malazan, haha. Each book will give to you huge revelations, right up until the end.  I meant ASOIAF."

They probably meant to put Meanas the first time. It's more of a correction. Though, technically it's not really incorrect the first time either. I'll let Steven Erikson explain   ""Rashan and Meanas. The names are strangely interchangeable depending on where you are. Seven Cities, for example, has a different take than Quon Tali. Darkness and Shadow are obviously linked, and besides, humans are bad at settling semantic distinctions (cf world religions).""   Steven Erikson - Q and A with malazanempire No 2 (2003)"
Malazan,2k83cq,majiinbuu,2,Fri Oct 24 22:09:49 2014 UTC,Thanks. Sounds all very complicated.  Do you know if there was a re-release of the the book with corrections like that?
Malazan,2k83cq,AllWrong74,2,Sat Oct 25 00:46:00 2014 UTC,"They did release a 10 anniversary edition of GotM. I have it, but i loaned it to someone else so I can't check it. One of the malazan wikis says they used Rashan in the UK trade paperback which came out in 1999. Checking google books, the 2004 US edition has switched it over to Meanas. I'm not really aware of any other specific changes.  I should probably mention there's a few things that are changed slightly later on. One character, Orfantal, changes gender. I'm not sure if they corrected that in later editions, but Orfantal is a female in GotM and is suddenly a dude later on. Erikson meant for him to always be a dude, it was just a mistake in editing I guess.   Trying to make sense of the battle of Pale is a bit of mess too. You'll get some more information about it in later books, which seems to contradict things in GotM. I've read the series and I'm still not entirely sure what went down there. It's hard for me to decide if it's a retcon or the character giving you information is lying or misinformed.   Adjunct Lorn has several strange things going on with her that don't make much sense. I won't really elaborate here though, but if you reread the series you'll probably be like what. I didn't pick up on them my first time anyways cause there's so much other stuff going on, plus getting used to Erikson's writing style.  Overall though, it's not really a huge problem. There's not really any other retcons that I can think of. GotM was originally written as a movie script and then rewritten into a novel. That's probably why it's a little different in some respects to the other books, but it's still a pretty good book."

Your saying that what he was up to will be revealed in time I can accept the usual hidden motives and actions of gods that is par for the course, however he mentions how he believes he acted in the name of justice and set right something that was wrong. So that had me thinking back and I do not recalling him showing up in anyone elses arc or doing anything.

Malazan,2k1v3g,doyouevendownvote,11,Thu Oct 23 00:58:24 2014 UTC,"We all were where you are at one point when we began this series. In this world, there are many, many different races, sub races, traditions, ethnicities, nations, and magic systems, and you're going to be bombarded and it's highly intimidating initially. Do not worry, we all felt this way.  Imagine it's like you've found a historians book and he has written it the way he has because he understands the terms and jargon and definitions of that time and you have to piece together what things mean by context and clues. It's part of the fun of Malazan. There are many, many moments where you will go ""Ah HAH!"" and ""Oooooooh!"" as you piece together different plots and characters from within the book as well as between books.  Gardens of the Moon is generally considered to be the hardest book to get into in the series. It's not bad by any means but Erickson wrote it nine years before starting the rest of the series and it was his first novel and it shows sometimes. Just stick with it.  The maps and character list in the front and the glossary in the back of the book are your friends. Especially the glossary. This enables you to keep track of things when you're feeling a bit lost or can't remember what's what.   Just dive in and just stick with it and let yourself be enveloped. You probably feel like you got dropped into a foreign country with no dictionary and no sense of history of the place and who the heck are all these people!? This is normal! Erickson does not do infodumps and can be heavy on the introspective philosophy. Every chapter you read uncovers a bit more of the Malazan world. Every book starts off with a lot of character development, history of the place they are in, geography, important events, etc. Each book is usually 3/4 buildup/plot and the last quarter is where the ""Convergence"" happens ie: crazy epic action/drama/weepiness/exhilaration.  You'll switch books and sometimes be on an entirely different continent with new characters and situations.  In Book 6 it all starts to come together and all the subplots and main plots weave together through the remaining books to culminate in the Crippled God.  The series is wonderful, amazing, crying into the books good. Its even better on a reread. It's also intimidating as hell. No shame if you put Gardens of the Moon down halfway through with a ""I have no freaking clue what is going on"" feeling. But if you stick with it, and you like it, you'll never look at other fantasy the same way again. It's that phenomenal. Read at least through book 2 or 3. Deadhouse Gates got me truly hooked, but Memories of Ice was the one that made me say, ""Okay, I'm going to be rereading this for the rest of my life and this gets a permanent place on my bookshelves at eye level, and now I'm off to find the hardcovers even though I already have all the mass market/ebooks.""  Sorry if I sound like a fanboy gushing, but I found it to be just that amazing. Welcome to the sub! Ask any questions and post your impressions and if you end up not liking it, no shame at all. No book is for everyone! It is an amazing series lore wise. You could debate about it and go deep into the little details forever. Erickson is an archeologist and an anthropologist and it really shows in his literature.   Just keep reading. You're not supposed to get everything right off the bat. It is much different if you're used to reading lighter fantasy or fast paced literature."
Malazan,2k1v3g,TriscuitCracker,3,Thu Oct 23 01:59:33 2014 UTC,"Dammit, you're making me want to reread the series again; this isn't good for my gpa.  But OP, TriscuitCracker is spot on (and said it much better than I can)-- the books can be very confusing, partly because the characters will speak about things that haven't been introduced (this is most obvious in GOTM because it's the first book), but for me that just gave a level of immersion that made me feel like I was discovering parts (never all) of a world that already existed, not like I was just finding things as the author came up with them.  So, to an extent, try to enjoy being overwhelmed. It really is like you're reading a history of some long-forgotten society or have been dropped into a different world. To help you keep track of what's happened so far, the glossary, the maps and lists of characters, or even a personal notebook might be useful (next time I reread the series I definitely intend on keeping one of these)."
Malazan,2k1v3g,Rnet1234,2,Thu Oct 23 03:49:17 2014 UTC,"the books can be very confusing, partly because the characters will speak about things that haven't been introduced   This, absolutely this! I'm about 400 pages in GotM now, but I haven't read a single a chapter without thinking ""Who are they talking about?"". Like Tayshrenn is talking about a ""she""-person and I'm all like ""Who is he refering to? TELL ME, YOU STUPID MAGE!"" And then a few pages later I go ""AHA!"""

If this is his only motivation it seems fairly weak, Kyle never showed any strong loyalty to the Guard, in fact quite the opposite. Nor has he any particular knowledge of Kazz or insight as to how his return would affect the Guard. Outside of any influence from Stoop's spirit I don't feel this would explain why Kyle would feel it is his responsibility to restore the rightful leader of an organisation he was only briefly involved with and felt no loyalty towards."
Malazan,2k004z,sonofa2,3,Wed Oct 22 16:28:11 2014 UTC,"He is being hunted by Skinner and his group. He wants to not die. That's a pretty good reason to find the actual leader and protect himself. And Kyle is a guardsman. A new recruit, but still a guardsman."

From an interview:   Re: Burn’s Sleep. No, Burn didn’t wake up 1200 years earlier. That’s just when those people started counting via her reference. But it may be that something happened 1200 years earlier that could have been interpreted as Burn waking up. Say like, an earthquake, or a sorcerous conflagration.

There is a chapter intro (whatever it's called) That is from the somewhat distant future when Grub becomes The First Sword. It implies the book is written in the future. Obviously it is a novel but a historically novel written after the fact.

Malazan,2jx19x,sizemore33,2,Tue Oct 21 23:55:20 2014 UTC,Heard a podcast interview with Erickson where he makes the fascinating point that none of the characters go on the typical hero's journey but that he intentionally puts the READER through the hero's journey.  If you have that in your mind as you read you can see that it is 100% true
Malazan,2jw4r1,makisupa79,12,Tue Oct 21 14:48:23 2014 UTC,"Quick Ben is part Andii I think. It is also alluded to that he is a soletaken wolf when he rescued his sister from the goddess of pestilence. Remember also that Shadowthrone was a simple mortal wizard and Cotillion was a mortal assasin. Erikson creates a world where people can ascend through cunning, valor, great acts, etc.  Quick Ben hides himself because his power is a threat to anyone. He is a clever man and prefers working behind the scenes.   Shadowthrone miss super mad at him because of their history. I don't actually believe ST would kill him. Its more that they're two geniuses butting heads."

This was, I thought, the source and cause of Quick's power and knowledge.  EDIT: However, it doesn't explain Quick's supposed Soletaken abilities (although never seen, often alluded to), nor his absolutely incredible ability to pull the strings in the background. His standing among Tehol and Kruppe can't be explained by the flight across Raraku."
Malazan,2jw4r1,Tallain,1 point,Wed Oct 22 08:38:16 2014 UTC,Yep you're right he wasn't part Andii. I guess his descriptions always made me think he were Andii.   I looked a little and am not sure that he absorbed an midi soul either. Though the souls described are typically missing 2 or so.   While looking I did find put that quick absorbed a soletaken priestess of Soliels soul.  As to his abilities they do describe his power as a child and his intelligence. There is a scene where he has made a doll of himself as a wolf and his family as sheep but this could just be a metaphor as his family weren't all soletaken sheep.   Prior to absorbing the souls he was in contention to be the Magi of Shadow. So perhaps as you said the souls made him much more powerful and knowledgeable.
Malazan,2jw4r1,Aiolus,1 point,Wed Oct 22 14:31:33 2014 UTC,One if the souls absorbed was a soletaken priest of soliel named Ullan. If Ben really is soletaken I assume it comes from absorbing that soul.  Moi. P 359 of the bantam edition
Malazan,2jw4r1,drae-,2,Thu Nov 20 21:13:33 2014 UTC,"You're right! It's been a long time since I read MoI. These are the souls that Quick absorbed:   Kebharla, more a scholar than a mage Renisha, a sorceror of High Meanas Keluger, a Septime Priest of D'riss Narkal, the warrior-mage sworn to Fener and aspirant to the god's Mortal Sword Ullan, the Soletaken priestess of Soliel Set'alahd Crool, a Jhag half-blood Etra, a mistress of Rashan Birith'erah, mage of the Serc warren Gellid, witch of Tennes"

Malazan,2jw4r1,Malky,4,Tue Oct 21 15:43:50 2014 UTC,"Did you rad FoD? If so, you will get a strong idea. The names are almost identical, you meet an Andii that trains with a Jaghut, and kind of has a thing with dolls. The soul shifting is said to be Jaghut sorcery, he's known to be part Andii, and is known to be super powerful. Also pretty sure one of his other souls is in FoD as well.  Avoided using names since you only mentioned TCG in your post text."

Malazan,2jw4r1,Gaebryal,1 point,Wed Oct 22 04:20:11 2014 UTC,"QB is a human born in seven cities, he was at one time a high priest of shadow, before leaving, which is why ST wants him dead, because once your in shadow, there is only one way out.  In raraku, he absorbed 12 other souls of mages, with it he got access to their warrens, and possibly some of their memories/knowledge.  One of the mages was a soletaken, which is why fiddler says he has a whiff of soletaken about him, but its never confirmed he can actually shapeshift, id assume he can. its also assumed that korya the tisti andii is one of the souls he absorbed, and likely is where he learned how to soulshift in the first place.   the thing from the andii spire is some kind of scepter for the king/queen of the tistii andii, finding the scepter is mentioned sometime during the fight at lightfall. Its unknown what power it has, and it seems he hid it there for safekeeping after he stole it.  as far as his power, he was always really smart, and obviously a powerful user of shadow, and with the addition of the other warrens, he became even more powerful, and under other names he was a high mage in the empire, id compare him to tayschrenn, maybe a little more powerful.  however something starts to change about the time he is on the boat, and makes the illusion of a wall of fire to scare off the edur.  the Eres in bottle gives him power, makes his illusion real. Sometime around there he starts to ascend if he hadnt already, and so he gets even more powerful.  personally i think his shaved knuckle was that he knew hed reached whatever requirements was needed, and if he died he'd ascend, so when he got blasted by the nahruk, that was his way out, and hes now a full ascendant"

Malazan,2jvg2v,Trianglator,3,Tue Oct 21 09:14:32 2014 UTC,"After killing Kilmandaros Draconus and stopping their plan. He walks off into the sunset. Maybe he goes and finds mother dark, maybe he carries out a new mission, who knows. He seems to be chasing the Errant little. Cut him some slack he lived in a sword for a long time. I think runtime wanted Kilava to kill Trake (Gruntle hated him) l. Kilava is tracked mother and wants to stop Grubtle by killing him before he can bring trade to the mortal plane. Kilava also sends dreams to him which he interprets incorrectly. Gruntle is a tortured man at this point of the story. He is also not terribly in the loop.   3.The Otaral Dragon is anathema to the dragons. Once freed she needed to be killed or trapped again. Quite the tragedy for the Otataral Dragon. Korabas could have destroyed magic as we know it.   Nope Hellian was always a cynical drunk who was touched heavily by luck. It was a mercy killing. Cotillion released him in a Cotillion fashion (assassin). TCG is not a reasonable guy and may not have gone quietly. Also so many layers of agendas. Cotillion got it done quickly. TCGs actions are hated by everyone. Mercifully releasing him back to his world where he was stolen from and chained and tortured was the best option that Shadowthrone, Cotillion, Bridgeburners, etc could come up with. Others wanted to keep him chained and steal his power. TCG was not originally bad, a soul can only take so much presumably.  You don't have to love them or think they're brilliant. Everyone can't love everything that is loved. One of the keys to these books is intensive reading and memorizing.   As for intricacy if you didn't feel it had any consider doing a reread. There are also some Reddit threads about that stuff. I found the work to be incredibly intricate. Many plot points are foreshadowed.  I've written a big chunk here, hope it helped a little."
Malazan,2jvg2v,Aiolus,2,Tue Oct 21 16:16:30 2014 UTC,"I just finished as well. Figured I'd add my questions here instead of starting a new thread. If these are answered in ICE books, point me there instead of spoilers.    What/who is quick Ben? All this info pointing to some big mystery, but unless I missed it, no reveal?  I read 10k pages and the universal douches don't get what's coming to them?! Are mallick rel and korbolo dom seriously still alive and in power? Likewise, the errant is still alive and scheming?  No God of War anymore? If I'm not mistaken, trake, fenor, and half of togg /fanderlay are dead. Was this to symbolize the war to end all wars or what?  Which God were the k'chain chemele worshiping? I don't understand who kalyath was the destraint for. Tiam, korabas, or something else? They showed the shattered dragon skull and had fortresses named after dragons."
Malazan,2jvg2v,makisupa79,2,Tue Oct 21 14:35:54 2014 UTC,"We still don't know who/what Quick Ben is. We may get some more information in the Kharkanas trilogy. Read ICE for more on Mallick and Korbolo. If I remember correctly, the beast gods were put in their place towards the end of TCG with the assertion that humans were always the better hunters and the better wagers of war. I don't think it means that this was the war to end all wars, simply that the beast gods of war were made irrelevant. I forget, sorry. Kalyth, Stormy, and Gesler may have just been representing the K'Chain themselves. I also forget why the fortresses were named after dragons."
Malazan,2jvg2v,emolga587,2,Tue Oct 21 19:52:46 2014 UTC,I'm pretty sure the matrons were there gods(or the memories within)  due to the fact that each matron passed down their memories of the last and so had a collective memory of every matron since the dawn of kchain society. There's a passage in either tcg or dod that discusses it pretty well but I'm at uni atm so I cant find it
Malazan,2jvg2v,DumpTruckJester,1 point,Wed Oct 22 04:13:36 2014 UTC,"What I understand is that quick ben has the souls of several powerful archmages inside him. Its explained when they describe the birth of the bridgeburners in Raraku, I don't remember which book that was though."
Malazan,2jvg2v,Claughy,1 point,Tue Oct 21 19:18:16 2014 UTC,"I can't recall the reasoning for some of those, but here's what I remember:   The Otataral Dragon is the antithesis of all magic and dragons. Thus, they are compelled, by instinct, to destroy it before it destroys them.  Hellian was, if I recall, sober at the time. Since then, she's begun drinking (even more heavily than before) to deal with the fact that her life has just gone to shit. She spends the majority of her screen time drunk out of her head. And she's more easy-going when drunk, from what I can recall. The few times she's sober, she regrets it, and acts more morose.  Because Cotillion is the God of Assassins. He has an image to maintain. Seriously, he's probably more powerful doing that. Also, it's probably to make it kind of vague as to whether they sent him home, or just murdered him.  That will require a reread. Several characters comment on how the Crippled God was dragged down against his will, and has been driven quite mad by his summoning, injuries, and imprisonment. The series focuses on mercy and compassion a lot. Eventually, everyone realises that all of this can be solved by sending the mad bastard home. Or killing him, depending on what happened. Especially since not doing so would give the Forkrul Assail immense power."
Malazan,2jvg2v,KBKarma,1 point,Tue Oct 21 12:05:21 2014 UTC,"About the Crippled God deserving to be set free...he has basically had the whole world and pantheon against him since he was ripped from his world onto Wu and chained for other gods/FA to feed on his power.  He obviously does some terrible, evil things but some of the key characters (Tavore, etc) recognize that this is him lashing out out of pain and desperation to be free.   The desire for freedom is what Karsa can relate to and the affects of pain and loss are what Fiddler, Whiskeyjack, Rake, etc can relate to.  I don't think anyone absolves him for his crimes; I think they come to understand and feel for him.  Similar to how Itkovian tries to redeem the leader of the Tenescowri (can't remember his name) - that guy is horrible but Itkovian still shows mercy.  Also, just from a self-preservation standpoint, let's get the Crippled God's heart away from the FA and let's get him (his presence is poisonous to Wu) away from the planet and let's keep those massive jade statues from crashing into the earth and destroying everything.  But I do agree that Koryk's reaction does make it harder to understand/appreciate what's happening."
Malazan,2jvg2v,sizemore33,2,Tue Oct 21 12:26:40 2014 UTC,which is pretty much why SE puts us in Koryk's head for that scene
Malazan,2jvg2v,cantlurkanymore,1 point,Tue Oct 21 16:38:55 2014 UTC,"And okay I do have to ask, does any one remember the exact moment where everyone decided the crippled god deserved to be set free? Because I'm pretty sure everyone literally hated his guts, and he literally hated everyones guts - crippling people for fun and then they all had a field day of epiphanies (the crippled god included) and decided to work on the same team.    The Crippled god is basically a kidnap victim that is being tortured and maimed by the gods and ascendants so they can use him as a source of power. Kellanved and Dancer decided that it needed to stop and set a plan in motion to do just that. The Rope stabbing Kaminsod was the culmination of that plan."
Malazan,2jvg2v,aleifur,1 point,Tue Oct 21 12:47:43 2014 UTC,"The fate of the Crippled God after Cotillion showed up is left intentionally vague, and it doesn't look like we'll get a definite answer on that.  I think the first instance of a character explicitly saying that the Bonehunters were going to try to free the Crippled God instead of killing him was Masan Gilani near the end of Dust of Dreams:   ‘We’re going to kill the Crippled God.’  Kisswhere shot her sister a wild look. ‘But who’d want to stop us doing that?’  Sinter shook her head. Her face was wretched with confusion.  Masan was eyeing them and when she spoke her voice was flat, ‘You jumped the wrong way, Sinter, like a one-eyed mongoose.’ She drank again, sloshed the skin and then scowled. ‘Should’ve brought two. We don’t think we’re off to kill the Chained One. In fact, it’s those chains we’re after. Well, the Adjunct, I mean. What she’s after.’ She lifted her head and fixed on Sinter’s eyes, and then Kisswhere’s. ‘We’re going to set the bastard free.’   Of course, those making the plans had decided this long ago."
Malazan,2jvg2v,emolga587,1 point,Tue Oct 21 19:45:37 2014 UTC,I'm going to suggest doing a reread.  A lot of what you perceive as being inconsistencies or unexplained are actually explained but you miss it the first time around because you are too busy trying to figure out what is going on.  Doing a reread is mind blowing in that you realize how much is actually laid out right before your eyes.
Malazan,2juhk3,EternalNewGuy,8,Tue Oct 21 01:42:19 2014 UTC,This is pretty hilarious because you've pretty much guessed the major plot threads of half the Esslemont books.

Cutter encounters them in a vision/dream. I'm not sure what he ends up doing. He might do something in ICE's novels, but I don't remember him being active again in the main series.   Who (what?) was the old man in the lighthouse with all the bones? I remember him showing up twice, refusing to give his real name, then never being mentioned again.   That would be Urko Crust, one of the old guard of Kellanved's empire. I know he shows up in RotCG. I can't remember if he shows up in the main series after Telorast and Curdle take possession of his tiny excavated skeletons. Fun fact, I think Toc is related to him by marriage iirc.

Also, after struggling through RotCG I thought SW was actually quite good, if maybe there was a couple of unnecessary storylines.. OST was a bit of a drag, as it had so many characters Erikson wrote about and it didn't feel like it was all there. I liked BaB, but haven't had any time to read Assail yet. Imo the ICE books are worth getting through at least once, for the info if anything. In any case after RotCG it seems like ICE actually got an editor.

As for Gudd, I don't know (I've taken a break half way through Stonewielder) though I think that the Forge of Darkness series (ironically) sheds some light on the situation.  Sort was a defender of the Storm Wall, rather than being a Stormrider herself.  My take on the Nah'ruk is that they had been strengthening for a long time (we've seen some characters stumbling on to their keeps) and that generally it was bad luck that the Bonehunters ended up between both factions.

So the Bonehunters just kind of got in the middle of them and that is why the Nah'ruk attacked. Just wrong place at the wrong time.

Malazan,2jqg1q,Therrester,2,Mon Oct 20 00:11:54 2014 UTC,Get an audiobook! Best thing in the world is to do house chores while listening to some Malazan books :D
Malazan,2jqg1q,VelocityMax,1 point,Mon Oct 20 00:15:05 2014 UTC,They are on sale on audible right now too!
Malazan,2jqg1q,Aiolus,2,Mon Oct 20 22:13:10 2014 UTC,I loved the reread it was incredible seeing all the things that I had missed.
Malazan,2jqg1q,Tayschrenn,2,Mon Oct 20 01:17:07 2014 UTC,Yeah I've been slowly going through the audiobooks and it's basically like reading them anew (I hadn't read them in many years).

Malazan,2jqg1q,AllWrong74,2,Mon Oct 20 18:33:33 2014 UTC,"GotM is a far better book than most people give credit for.  I understand why.  The writing, and just the feel of the book is completely different than the rest of the series.  In addition, it's the first book, so you're so lost, you miss a lot of things, just like your list, here.  All of that aside, it's still got all of what I consider to be the Erikson hallmarks.  I absolutely love the way he depicts sword fights, and there's a good one with Rake in GotM.  The book seriously picks up in the last 33% - 50% of the book."
Malazan,2jqg1q,far2far2return,2,Mon Oct 20 13:17:26 2014 UTC,"I suppose I will eventually reread them.  I am about to start MT for the first time, but, thankfully, I somehow picked up on every point mentioned thus far.  It is cool to look back and see the things you didn't before."
Malazan,2jpyt2,Dodrio,4,Sun Oct 19 20:36:21 2014 UTC,"Well for further reading you should start with Esslemont's series. It's a bunch of stories that take place more or less along side the main series. First book is called Night of Knives, about the night Kellanved and Dancer were supposedly assassinated."
Malazan,2jpyt2,SageOfTheWise,2,Sun Oct 19 21:11:23 2014 UTC,"SE is writing his Kharkanas prequel series right now, but he has stated before that he has plans to write another short series after that, that will pick up with Karsa."
Malazan,2jpyt2,ScaraBandaris,2,Sun Oct 19 21:30:57 2014 UTC,What are the things which seem open ended?  There is the TOR reread. Also asking what you have questions about here can help. Also Google and various Malazan forums.  For further reading Erikson has some off shoots and the Kharakanas trilogy. ICE also contributes to the information about the world and though his books aren't anywhere as good they are canon.
Malazan,2jpyt2,Aiolus,1 point,Sun Oct 19 21:52:17 2014 UTC,Well there was a few things I feel like I missed or weren't explained. Like what happened to Felisin younger? What happened exactly when they Crippled God was killed? What was Kallor up to when everyone was referencing him off being a failure in TCG? What happened to all of the gods that were allegedly going to try to feed off the crippled gods power? Just a million things I feel like I'm just always going to wonder. Oh and what is Grub? What was his point?
Malazan,2jpyt2,Aiolus,3,Sun Oct 19 22:03:38 2014 UTC,"Felisin younger does not resolve in any meaningful way. It was a tangent which could have had an impact that did not (as some tangents don't)   When they killed the crippled God they freed him and this stopped the jade statues from coming to rescue him in what may have destroyed the world.   Kallor. Not sure what you're asking. However Kallor is cursed to wander forever and to fail.  The gods wanting to feed off the crippled god failed to do so   Grub is a bit of an enigma. There is actually a reference in HoC (from a future perspective) about him becoming the First Sword of the Empire. I may be wrong but I believe this is purposefully a mysterious character. As to his point, I thought he was an awesome and funny character, What do you mean point? He was a turning factor in a battle with the K'chain Chenille vs the short tail ones.  Here's the quote from a future perspective about Grub;  ""It was said the captain's adopted child - who at that time was known by the unfortunate name of Grub - refused the wagon on the march. that he walked the entire way, even as, in the first week beneath the year's hottest sun, fit and hale soldiers stumbled and fell.  this is perhaps invention, for by all accounts he was at that time no more than five years of age. and the captain himself, from whose journals much of that journey and the clash in which it culminated is related in detail, writes very little of Grub, more concerned as he was with the rigours of command. As a result, of the future First Sword of the Late Empire period, scant details, beyond the legendary and probably fictitious, are known."" -Lives of the Three  -Moragalle  Hope that gave some information. However one of my favorite things about Malazan is wondering about some open ended things and also doing a reread was really awesome as I picked up many things. Admittedly TCG was a torrent of information. Reread the ending and check some stuff online."
Malazan,2jpyt2,SageOfTheWise,5,Sun Oct 19 22:21:27 2014 UTC,I strongly believe Felisin Younger and the cult of the Apocalypse is setup for the eventual Toblaki series.
Malazan,2jpyt2,Aiolus,1 point,Mon Oct 20 14:43:14 2014 UTC,I could definitely see that. It would be a powerful reunion between Felisin Younger and Karsa. Karsa is gonna be pretty mad at her if they meet up!
Malazan,2jpyt2,SKR47CH,1 point,Mon Oct 20 15:50:53 2014 UTC,"Thank you for the reply, I'd missed that thing about Grub.  I guess a lot of the things I thought of as open-ended weren't actually  more open than most story endings, but this series gave me the feeling that everything would be explained eventually. I think I just need to read the offshoot books and then maybe reread this series."
Malazan,2jpyt2,Quantum_Finger,1 point,Sun Oct 19 22:40:53 2014 UTC,"Felisin younger does not resolve in any meaningful way. It was a tangent which could have had an impact that did not (as some tangents don't)    I never considered that. Thanks for this. This makes the writing even more awesome.   Kallor. Not sure what you're asking. However Kallor is cursed to wander forever and to fail.   His is one of characters that made an huge impression on me. He has truly become wise in all these years, in my opinion."
Malazan,2jmyhc,Dullahan3470,3,Sat Oct 18 21:00:24 2014 UTC,"I didn't like it.  My favorites of ICE were RotCG and OST, which I thought were okay, and the rest were pretty meh.  Assail"
Malazan,2jmyhc,Giotto,2,Sat Oct 18 22:03:08 2014 UTC,"I loved it, though I've also liked ICE's other books too.  I liked OST probably the most, but this one is definitely up there.  Also Kyle's name reveal was perfect. It always bugged me that we have a guy named Kyle in this massive fantasy world."
Malazan,2jmyhc,sonofa2,2,Sun Oct 19 06:21:46 2014 UTC,It's funny that he finally addressed the Kyle thing. You really don't see how that kinda breaks the immersion? Any comparison of Kyle with the other names in the series kinda illustrates it. It's like having some character named Dave.
Malazan,2jmyhc,neonmeate,1 point,Sun Oct 19 08:07:23 2014 UTC,"I can live with or without ""fantasy"" names. No one would have said anything if his name was ""Kaiel""."

Malazan,2jmyhc,Azathanai,1 point,Mon Oct 20 03:55:01 2014 UTC,"I thought it was perhaps his best, with maybe Stonewielder being better.  I liked the setting and story, I thought that he had numerous interesting characters, and I think that it added to the mythology of the world in an even bigger way than his previous works.  Additionally, his writing in it is much stronger than in his earlier efforts."
Malazan,2jmyhc,Errastas,1 point,Sun Oct 19 00:24:25 2014 UTC,It's ok
Malazan,2jjs77,far2far2return,17,Fri Oct 17 20:31:09 2014 UTC,"Well, she was killed. Sometimes, they don't come back.  Also, I think it was relatively clear that Felisen was not supposed to follow a standard character arc. In pretty much every other story that I've read where a character went through the sort of thing that she went through, they would get stronger, more sympathetic, or eventually redeem themselves. Felisen just kept getting more despicable, which is honestly fairly realistic. Not every abused and betrayed teenager comes out stronger, most of them are just broken.  She, and the events surrounding her death, do come up again at various points. But I doubt that you will get what you want."
Malazan,2jjs77,stabro,18,Fri Oct 17 20:45:54 2014 UTC,"I feel like her storyline was wrapped up perfectly. The build up was all in preparation for what Tavore had to do. Watching Felisin get worse and worse and to find that the whole time Tavore was searching for her? It's supposed to break your heart. Not piss you off.   This series is meant to be emotional. You're meant to get invested. Unfortunately, it doesn't always work out the way us readers want. Erikson makes sure that nobody is safe in his world."
Malazan,2jjs77,xolotl92,2,Fri Oct 17 21:07:57 2014 UTC,"When I first read it, I was extremely shocked that this was how her story ended, but as the series goes on it fits very well with the story Erickson is telling.  Really appreciated that part as I looked back."
Malazan,2jjs77,alienangel2,1 point,Sat Oct 18 01:59:15 2014 UTC,"Yeah. The only further closure I could think of was whether Tavore would find out what exactly happened, since my understanding is that Tavore doesn't realize.  I haven't read TCG yet to find out."
Malazan,2jjs77,GPSBach,1 point,Sat Oct 18 17:20:22 2014 UTC,I actually hadn't read to the complete end of the book.  I accept Cotillion's words regarding felisin and felisin younger as a suitable wrap up for her.  I jumped the gun a little.  Thanks for clarifying anyway!
Malazan,2jjs77,MoranthMunitions,7,Sun Oct 19 00:23:35 2014 UTC,Gonna hijack this biddy.  What ever happened to Felisin younger?

Malazan,2jicb6,jhanjria,6,Fri Oct 17 11:53:09 2014 UTC,"You should not visit The Malazan Wiki. It's not well maintained and a lot of things are not properly detailed because the world is huge and leaves a lot to be figured out by you. Finish the 10 books and then visit the Malazan forums (forum.malazanempire.com/index.php?).  And for your enquiry, it's just a way the wiki writes about things, as if in a history book. Read the books and see for yourself. You can ask questions here, people give spoiler free help and for anything else, check the glossary or dramatis personas from the books."
Malazan,2jicb6,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Fri Oct 17 12:10:14 2014 UTC,"Phew, thanks."
Malazan,2jicb6,bayaz,2,Fri Oct 17 14:02:45 2014 UTC,"I've just started Deadhouse Gates, and decided to brave the Malazan Wiki   Oh god this won't end well.  Reads rest  Oh good, you didn't read a spoiler. Everything in the wiki is past tense. Except for things that randomly aren't. The wiki just sucks. Stay away, spoilers are everywhere. Luckily this wasn't one."
Malazan,2jhb9u,fdsfgs71,16,Fri Oct 17 02:29:59 2014 UTC,"Well, do you LIKE complex worlds? Do you like intricate plotlines? Do you like fully realized characters? It does require ""effort"" but if you enjoy that aspect of reading then dive in. If you are typically a light reader who just wants to enjoy simpler fare then it might be too much but you're cheating yourself if you don't at least try the first book, Gardens of the Moon. It also helps if you enjoy fantasy and recognize the various tropes and unwritten rules of the genre In this world, there are many, many different races, sub races, traditions, ethnicities, nations, and magic systems, and you're going to be bombarded and it's highly intimidating initially. Do not worry, we all felt this way.  Imagine it's like you've found a historians book and he has written it the way he has because he understands the terms and jargon and definitions of that time and you have to piece together what things mean by context and clues. It's part of the fun of Malazan. There are many, many moments where you will go ""Ah HAH!"" and ""Oooooooh!"" as you piece together different plots and characters from within the book as well as between books.  Gardens of the Moon is generally considered to be the hardest book to get into in the series. It's not bad by any means but Erickson wrote it nine years before starting the rest of the series and it was his first novel and it shows sometimes. Just stick with it.  The maps and character list in the front and the glossary in the back of the book are your friends. Especially the glossary. This enables you to keep track of things when you're feeling a bit lost or can't remember what's what.   Just dive in and just stick with it and let yourself be enveloped. You probably feel like you got dropped into a foreign country with no dictionary and no sense of history of the place and who the heck are all these people!? This is normal! Erickson does not do infodumps and can be heavy on the introspective philosophy. Every chapter you read uncovers a bit more of the Malazan world. Every book starts off with a lot of character development, history of the place they are in, geography, important events, etc. Each book is usually 3/4 buildup/plot and the last quarter is where the ""Convergence"" happens ie: crazy epic action/drama/weepiness/exhilaration.  You'll switch books and sometimes be on an entirely different continent with new characters and situations.  In Book 6 it all starts to come together and all the subplots and main plots weave together through the remaining books to culminate in the Crippled God.  The series is wonderful, amazing, crying into the books good. Its even better on a reread. It's also intimidating as hell. No shame if you put Gardens of the Moon down halfway through with a ""I have no freaking clue what is going on"" feeling. But if you stick with it, and you like it, you'll never look at other fantasy the same way again. It's that phenomenal. Read at least through book 2 or 3. Deadhouse Gates got me truly hooked, but Memories of Ice was the one that made me say, ""Okay, I'm going to be rereading this for the rest of my life and this gets a permanent place on my bookshelves at eye level, and now I'm off to find the hardcovers even though I already have all the mass market/ebooks.""  Sorry if I sound like a fanboy gushing, but I found it to be just that amazing. Welcome to the sub! Ask any questions and post your impressions and if you end up not liking it, no shame at all. No book is for everyone! It is an amazing series lore wise. You could debate about it and go deep into the little details forever. Erickson is an archeologist and an anthropologist and it really shows in his literature."
Malazan,2jhb9u,TriscuitCracker,4,Fri Oct 17 02:51:30 2014 UTC,This guy
Malazan,2jhb9u,Prof_J,-2,Fri Oct 17 04:44:20 2014 UTC,"I'm sure Erikson would pop an extremely rigid boner hearing that ""never look at other fantasy the same way again"" bit, but that's pretty hyperbolic. Don't get me wrong, I love the series, but he's in no way the be all end all of the genre. It's disrespectful to the rest of the authors writing amazing stuff."
Malazan,2jhb9u,neonmeate,3,Fri Oct 17 08:05:17 2014 UTC,"In my opinion, nothing I've read is as amazing as the Malazan botf."
Malazan,2jhb9u,Foliagus,-2,Fri Oct 17 18:16:30 2014 UTC,That's not a good thing.
Malazan,2jhb9u,neonmeate,2,Sat Oct 18 08:01:25 2014 UTC,"Why's that?  I have 3 bookcases filled with novels, I'm passionate about the stuff."
Malazan,2jhb9u,Foliagus,-2,Sat Oct 18 08:48:41 2014 UTC,"No, passion is great! It's just you should never keep looking for your next favorite. It's out there somewhere."
Malazan,2jhb9u,neonmeate,4,Sat Oct 18 09:42:27 2014 UTC,"You still don't make sense. I never said they were the best ever, I said they were the best I've read."
Malazan,2jhb9u,Foliagus,2,Sat Oct 18 18:43:34 2014 UTC,"Do you have other suggestions? Thus far, I have to agree with Triscuit."
Malazan,2jhb9u,Khilara,7,Sun Oct 19 15:56:14 2014 UTC,"They are fantasy novels. They are the most intricate, deep, and detailed ones that I've ever read, with a unique method of conveying information, but they aren't textbooks. Just read them. You don't get tens of thousands of readers by requiring them to keep notes."
Malazan,2jhb9u,Foliagus,6,Fri Oct 17 02:39:09 2014 UTC,"What triscuit said.  Crying into the books.  The reread is amazing so far, and I'm only just finished the first 2 again.  This is the best thing I've ever read, over George R.R. Martin, Salvatore, The Sandman series, fuck.  Nothing compares to the sheer scope and imagination of the Malazan world.  Oh, and I'd say, if you can read Game of Thrones, you can read this.  It's not so hard, once you finish book 1.  It's just a series that happens to have its best parts LATER, as opposed to earlier. Not that books 2 and 3 aren't some of the brightest, for sure."
Malazan,2jhb9u,ghoulbuns,1 point,Fri Oct 17 06:02:45 2014 UTC,Game of Thrones is child's play compared to this series.
Malazan,2jhb9u,Foliagus,2,Sun Oct 19 03:46:11 2014 UTC,"For sure, but IF you can read game of thrones, you CAN read this. It also has a large cast of characters, a huge world, and many different storylines, just not to the same extent."
Malazan,2jhb9u,ghoulbuns,1 point,Sun Oct 19 05:21:58 2014 UTC,Totally true
Malazan,2jhb9u,mmSNAKE,2,Sun Oct 19 21:39:56 2014 UTC,There is no need to keep notes or having references. If you go slowly enough you should not miss anything substantial. There is also places like this to ask questions for concepts or events that you don't understand.
Malazan,2jhb9u,grixa,1 point,Fri Oct 17 06:23:05 2014 UTC,"is it something that I can follow easily provided I read carefully and pay attention to the text?   Absolutely yes. Every chapter is packed with information but Erikson writes in a way that makes easy to keep track of most things. He always remains the reader of important characters and events from time to time. He also refers to characters not only by name, but also by race, range or title so you don't have to be wondering who they are all the time.  Even if you find it difficult to know what's going on it's worth sticking to it. In fact, it is quite normal at first to be a little lost. But that's part of the enjoyment, too.   However, if you are going to start reading this series, I would recomend reading it at a regular pace. It takes time and commitement. Once you become familiar with the world and the characters you're going to enjoy it a lot.  And, of course, you can ask us here any question or doubt you may have and let us know your thoughts after reading each book."
Malazan,2jhb9u,stabro,1 point,Fri Oct 17 10:43:13 2014 UTC,"Put it like this.  If you read through all the books in the ""correct"" order without taking any significant breaks (months) then you shouldn't have any trouble following the story.  This series is easy to understand if you have it fresh in your mind.    Unfortunately, a lot of people take longer breaks between books and end up having to go back through and read summaries to remember the finer details.  That's fine too, whatever floats your boat.  It's also the kind of series that caters really well to re-reads because of how dense it is, but most of the content that you will notice the second time through are the occasional ""ah-hah!"" moments."
Malazan,2jhb9u,Dullahan3470,1 point,Fri Oct 17 15:08:48 2014 UTC,"I made it through the series purely through reading.  No referencing the index or wiki or maps.  It takes some time to get a handle on it, but I wouldn't say it's really any worse than LOTR or ASOIAF.  The biggest difference is that many pieces of the puzzle don't come together until after several books.  (And others not until the final book)  You'll forget about thinga and be reminded of them later."
Malazan,2jfncs,milk72,8,Thu Oct 16 17:20:16 2014 UTC,"Ok first question... What in the fuck was trull sengar and onrack's entire storyline about? I literally didn't understand a single part. No idea where to start on that one   So you see from the prologue that Trull is a Tiste Edur that was exiled from his people for some reason and chained up in that warren he's later found in. Onrack ends up finding him and letting him go and they travel for a time. Eventually run into more Imass and learn about the threat on the first throne and go their to guard it. You are going to learn a lot more about Trull next book. Hint: This book ended with him saying he's going to tell his life story.   Second... What happened with that whole light/dark/shadow thing and people trying to oust Shadowthrone and cotillion? Did that get resolved?    You mean the thing with Bidithal? Well he was killed so... yes.   Third, what the hell was going on with loric, his dad the god osseric, and every single thing regarding the tiste liosan?   Don't know how to keep answering these really broad questions. What do you mean what was going on? Loric was helping the rebellion. Osseric likes to keep to himself. The Liosan are generally xenophobic jerks.   Fourth, where did apsalar go? And why?   Cotillion had some jobs for her. She wanted to get away from Crokus because she didn't want him to be like her.   Fifth, Cutter? Really? Why not just call yourself Captain Badass and be done with it. What a dumb name   Yeah that's kind of the point. He's a teenager.   Sixth, why did felisen just like die and not even put up a struggle? What's the deal with the goddess and did she get killed or something?   Because she was being controlled by the goddess the entire time, but the goddess was killed right as the duel started so she only had seconds of awareness before she was dead."
Malazan,2jfncs,SageOfTheWise,2,Thu Oct 16 17:49:35 2014 UTC,"Ok that answers some of my questions. Sorry for the broad questions I really just didn't understand anything that happened with trull sengar, loric, and the goddess. A lot went down in that book that just left me scratching my head."
Malazan,2jfncs,SageOfTheWise,7,Thu Oct 16 17:54:41 2014 UTC,"Trull Sengar's story is one of the main parts of the middle third of this series, but it's a story told primarily out of order. So right now with Trull there is going to be a lot of questions. He doesn't really do much himself this book, just gets caught up in other people's plots.  I don't really know what to say about Loric. Been awhile so I don't remember exactly what he does this book, but its mostly just hang around camp, at some point go visit his father right? Helps Felisin Younger and some people escape near the end? Or was that just Heboric?  As for the Goddess. Ok so she is an ancient Imass Spirit. She was the Imass married to Onrack that Onrack cheated on with Kilava. That made her like crazy vengeful, and at some point after the Ritual of Tellan they other Imass decided she was too dangerous and trapped her in the shadow fragment warren in Raraku. Over the centuries she was able to use the warren though to gain power and influence the humans in the region and became the goddess of this religion. Her goal was to wipe out humanity because she saw humanity as the result of Onrack and Kilava's union (it's not really, its more symbolic for her and she's crazy though). She was killed by I believe Claw Assassins that entered her Warren. Been awhile since I read it though."
Malazan,2jfncs,Therrester,3,Thu Oct 16 18:19:44 2014 UTC,THATS what was going on with the goddess? Wow I got none of that. And yea that makes sense and ties onrack into the story more. It seemed like it was korbolo's talons who killed her though.   But yea trull sengar was a total mystery to me. I'm gonna reread the epilogue to see if I can make more sense of it.   And I just didn't quite get why loric was doing the shit he did. What is the connected between the liosan and the goddess/Shadowthrone stuff? And what's the deal with his  familiars or whatever those demon protectors were?
Malazan,2jfncs,TehSyph,5,Thu Oct 16 18:36:06 2014 UTC,"I'll try and explain what happened with L'oric the best I can.  Essentially, the Liosan are xenophobic as /u/SageOfTheWise said. They believe they're top shit and that they're the best of everything. Case and point: they tract down and kill anyone who enters their real/warran (Thyr - the warran of fire/light). They, as a people, live in isolation within their warran. You'll learn more about them in later books.  Now, the Liosan worship Osserc, Father Light, as their god. However, what they don't know is they Father Light actually left them ages ago. L'oric, in order to keep his people at peace, placed a false god in their pantheon, replacing Father Light. Thus, the Liosan falsely worship this demon, while L'oric is off searching for Osserc.  This is where the Liosan plot line kicks in. Back in Deadhouse Gates, Stormy, Gesler, Truth, Felison, Kulp, Baudin, and Heboric follow an undead dragon into a warran of fire on the Silanda. This was the Liosan's warran. Since they hate intruders, they send the 4 horsemen we encounter in House of Chains in order to kill Gesler, Stormy, and Truth.  These four liosan encounter Trull and Onrack, who are on their quest. Shortly after they meet up, they regroup with other Imass (Onrack's original party I believe) and they preform a ritual to get out of The Nascent. This opens a warran into Thyr and while Trull/Onrack escape, the other Imass go and kill the false god; the one L'oric planted.  L'oric, knowing his game's up, panics and finds Osserc, who tells him he's not coming back. If I remember correctly, the two decide that it's time for the Liosan to deal with their own.   However, for the life of me, I can't remember when we last see L'oric in the book. I think he's still with Osserc, since L'oric was injured in the battle against the Goddess, but I'm not 100% sure on that one.  Anyway, that's the Liosan side of things within House of Chains. It'll pick up again in a later book."
Malazan,2jfncs,valorcurse,4,Thu Oct 16 19:00:28 2014 UTC,"To my knowledge, this is generally accurate, however Osserc is not Father Light, he is his son."
Malazan,2jfncs,holyplankton,3,Thu Oct 16 20:43:38 2014 UTC,"Yea, he's to Light what Anomander Rake is to Dark."
Malazan,2jfncs,Aiolus,2,Thu Oct 16 23:22:39 2014 UTC,Thank you so much. Really helps make sense of this
Malazan,2jfncs,thewreckinball,3,Thu Oct 16 19:53:00 2014 UTC,"First off, a description of what a Familiar is would be helpful. A familiar is a creature, usually small like a rat or a raven, that is magically bonded to a mage to the benefit of both the mage and the creature. L'oric had a familiar in the form of a powerful demon that was watching over the realm of Kurald Thyrllan in place of Osserc, who was supposed to be the realm's protector but had been absent for a long, long time.  L'oric's previous familiar had been killed by the Onrack, Trull, and company when they met with the Tiste Liosan. Once that protector was killed, L'oric was tasked with finding a replacement, and since Osserc was unwilling to return to take up the mantle of protector himself, he had to find another willing ""demon"" to bond as a familiar to watch over Kurald Thyrllan.   Also, at this point Trull is supposed to be a mystery, and it is one that the entire next book (and then some) unravels for you, just keep pushing on and you'll understand. This series is chock full of moments of epiphany where a whole lot of information suddenly slides into place and makes sense."
Malazan,2jfncs,MoranthMunitions,2,Thu Oct 16 18:51:10 2014 UTC,"Wow thanks for the help. Really makes me understand what in the hell I just read.  The book was definitely a good read, I just didn't have any connection to trull sengar and his bizarre storyline or with loric and his bizarre storyline. Definitely seemed like a transitional phase into the next stage of the series which will make more sense down the road"
Malazan,2jdmxy,alphatrithetapi,3,Thu Oct 16 01:50:52 2014 UTC,"There was a similar debate in the A Song of Ice and Fire subreddit a while back about names and stuff in titles. Requiring no names in titles ended up making titles very vague and uninformative, making it very difficult to actually figure out what posts were about while browsing and making it nearly impossible to find anything by searching. The mods ended up allowing it, because the way the series is structured meant that details come to light about characters after they die or events happen, characters talk about dead characters all the time, or other such things, and so putting those names into the titles is not a spoiler. An example used is that even though a certain character dies in the first book, another character finds out more information about him in a later book. Thus, a thread titled ""About <that character>... (Spoilers A Dance With Dragons)"" could exist, even though that character died in the first book.   That's just for A Song of Ice and Fire- Malazan is even crazier. Someone's name being in a thread for a later book doesn't mean anything! They could have never died in a previous book, have died but left something behind that someone finds in that later book, died and came back somehow, another character is finding out about something the title character did a long time ago, or any number of possibilities.  For example, Spoilers tBH.  It's still good practice to avoid putting names in titles, but if someone does, it's not really a spoiler.  Edits: Spelling, thought of a better example"
Malazan,2jdmxy,GuudeSpelur,2,Thu Oct 16 03:37:48 2014 UTC,"Ya i guess. The one that got me was the new thread about a certain character in tCG which is on the front page. I may just be over thinking, but  a) it tells me that the character makes it through the situation she's now in, and   b) that the character must ""know"" something big that effects the plot.  Its not a huge deal, but from now on it kinda lessens that character story's impact, and whenever i read about the character i'll be looking out for whatever they might ""know""."
Malazan,2jdmxy,AllWrong74,3,Thu Oct 16 04:20:20 2014 UTC,"But that's the point.  The specific thread you're referring to (How Did Tavore Know (tCG Spoilers)) doesn't tell you that Tavore made it to tCG.  All it tells you is that there is something dealing with Tavore in tCG.  She could die fairly early in the series for all you know.  Or, she could die and come back; or she could have looked to have died, but not actually died.  Literally, the only thing that tells you in a series like this is that there is something dealing with her in that book."
Malazan,2jcbih,conniedarko,3,Wed Oct 15 18:41:29 2014 UTC,"The specifics about the timeline are not important. There are a lot of inconsistencies regarding smaller points, like Karsa's daughters or Harlo's age. Case and point, Gruntle says early in the book that Black Coral happened a year ago, and yet Harlo's 5-6 years old (Stonny was raped during the battle of Capustan).  In regards to Toll the Hounds, all you need to know is that it happens after the events of both Reaper's Gale, and Return of the Crimson Guard. Furthermore, it can be argued that the first three books of Dust of Dreams happen within the time frame of Toll the Hounds.  Other than this general notion, timeline is inconsistent and not important."
Malazan,2jcbih,Therrester,2,Wed Oct 15 19:01:22 2014 UTC,"Furthermore, it can be argued that the first three books of Dust of Dreams happen within the time frame of Toll the Hounds.

First three books sounds about right."

Malazan,2jcbih,SageOfTheWise,3,Wed Oct 15 20:44:11 2014 UTC,"There isn't one, for the exact reasons that are likely baffling you. The timeline doesn't make sense. TTH takes place in 1166. Karsa's original journey where he conceived those kids takes place in either 1159 or 1161 (we don't know because even more timeline issues). So the kids are at most 7. But those kids are not 7, they're definitely older.  Similarly, in the same book, Harlo is 6. He was conceived during MoI, which took place in 1164. Again, makes no sense. There are many of these issues in the series that make putting together a timeline pretty much impossible.   The 'in universe explanation' is that this is a retelling of the tale, and is therefor not perfect. There's even a passage in TTH about how any true history book is filled with inconsistencies, its the ones that aren't you know are fake. out of universe, Erikson just doesn't keep track of any of this stuff and doesn't care to, so these issues happen a lot."
Malazan,2jcbih,SerBronnofBlackwater,0,Wed Oct 15 19:06:28 2014 UTC,The timeline makes me angry a lot. Harlo is a good example of that.
Malazan,2ja09x,Hellzigzag,6,Wed Oct 15 01:55:25 2014 UTC,Most likely because that's what Erikson wanted to do.
Malazan,2ja09x,mgallowglas,3,Wed Oct 15 02:25:23 2014 UTC,"My guess would be that GOTM has 7 because it was written a decade before the rest of the series before he had standardized his ideas for the series (maybe also an artifact of the original screenplay?). The rest were all 4 because that was the new standard, but then TCG was 7 again as a call back to the first book, bringing stuff full circle in a very small way."

(and also, who is the other remaining?).  As I understood the whole thing was mostly planned by Ganoes after he became Master of the Deck, with the Rope and ST ending to back them up because they shared a common goal with the Paran's scions.  Something similar happened with Eres'al, she felt something was needed to be done and found Tavore who was already going toward that path, ending up to somehow team up with her"
Malazan,2j9g41,Sunitsa,2,Wed Oct 15 01:09:37 2014 UTC,ThroatSlitter was the other. Tavore had talon necklace at the end of the book.

And just to warn you, Midnight Tides is on a completely new continent, with Trull's story coming to the forefront and the last big plotlines to be laid out. There are quite a few events that will be alluded to that you have experienced from other characters point of view in other books, so be on the lookout! Lots of ""Ah HAH!"" and ""Oooooooh!""realizations.  I hated Midnight Tides at first because I was like ""Damn it Erickson, not ANOTHER new continent!"" but by the end, it has become one of my favorites. There are characters just like in Seven Cities and Genebackis that will make you laugh, cry and cheer.   Book Six, the Bonehunters, starts to tie it all together. It has characters and plotlines from all previous five books. You have an amazingly epic and weepy ride ahead of you, and I envy your journey for the first time.   Witness."

I must have missed something between Shadowthrone making it look like they had destroyed the Throne and them going back because I thought they had been convinced and decided to go attack something else. What made them return?
Malazan,2iuuhd,Asiriya,3,Sun Oct 12 19:42:09 2014 UTC,"I believe that there are two Thrones that you are confusing together.  Shadowthrones sorcery made the Throne of Shadow look like it was ruined.  This was the throne that was on Drift Avali formerly defended by Andarist with Cutter and Apsalar for a little while. Then the Edur with Icarium turned their sights onto the First Throne of the T'lan Imass, which was at the time being defended by Apt, Minala, Panek,  Minalas adopted children, Trull, Onrack, and the other T'lan Imass whose names I can't recall.  Was this helpful?  Edit: Panek"
Malazan,2iuuhd,ghoulbuns,1 point,Sun Oct 12 20:00:24 2014 UTC,"Book has a good number of actual deaths as well at least. Truth, Heboric (though his spirit gets some action post death), Dujek, Pearl.  I absolutely loved The Bonehunters, my second favorite book overall. The battle at Y'ghatan. Paran vs. Poliel. The entire climax. All so good."
Malazan,2iuuhd,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Fri Oct 10 14:46:07 2014 UTC,"I guess Dujek is a big one, but he is barely a whisper during the story. Probably should have put a spoiler tag on this, whoops."

Malazan,2ism4b,afarana,6,Thu Oct 9 20:59:36 2014 UTC,"Don't force yourself, if it comes to that. DG was kind of hard, as it takes place on a different continent, new characters, and more world details get revealed.   This is still laying framework, so relax and take it in. Don't worry if you don't understand something. You're not supposed to understand. The characters know more than you about their own particular part of the world. No one character knows absolutely everthing (with the possible exception of Kruppe) Have you noticed that the narration is tightly focused on a particular character? Erickson rarely ever pulls fully back in to a neutral omniscient narration.   So, you are left figuring out the whole world through a myriad of perspectives and a colorful patchwork of information. The more you read, the more the tapestry gets filled out.   As the reader, you are privileged to something no person in the Malazan world is capable of. You can see and experience everything from every character. No Ascendant can do that. With Memories of Ice and House of Chains you'll cover some familiar ground again, so it will be come much easier on your brain.   Hang on for Midnight Tides, as you'll get jolted to a different corner of the tapestry. A whole new setting with a few familiar threads.  By the time you get to Dust of Dreams, you'll have a pretty good view of the whole tapestry. There are few more threads and some incredible twists still left, though.   TL;DR  Reading the entire series turns you in to Kruppe."
Malazan,2ism4b,zerro_4,3,Fri Oct 10 01:06:22 2014 UTC,"DG starts slow, but it ramps up really hard once you start book 3 (of the 4 in DG)."
Malazan,2ism4b,montaron87td,2,Fri Oct 10 09:46:23 2014 UTC,"As someone who just finished the series, this definitely happened to me as well, especially in the beginning more so than the end.   My strategy was to use the tools the book gave me (the dramatis personae, etc.) and if that didn't work just keep reading in the knowledge that eventually it will all make sense.   The badassery that occurs throughout basically made up for all the times I felt lost at the start."
Malazan,2ism4b,Poser1313,2,Thu Oct 9 21:37:43 2014 UTC,"I know GotM is supposed to be difficult, but should I still be having trouble in DG?   Yeah certainly. DG is kind of the wall many people hit with this series. I mean with how tough GotM can be, with any other series you'd be like 'well at least I know the plot and all the characters now'. But DG hits the reset button and makes you learn a whole new story. Luckily the series stops doing that after DG.... for a bit."
Malazan,2ism4b,SageOfTheWise,2,Fri Oct 10 01:29:22 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I get confused when people say GotM was hard but loved the shit out of DG. I had a really hard time with DG and didn't like the 7 cities books all that much. They were still top notch, but I much prefer the Letherii or the Geneabackites."

Malazan,2ism4b,AllWrong74,1 point,Fri Oct 10 13:11:48 2014 UTC,"For me, at least at the conceptual level, the Path of Hands was my favorite thing in DG and also in the series so far (just finished MT).

I know these posts are relatively common on reddit, but thought I'd throw my woe-is-me pennies into the pot and see what came back :)  Side note: Started collecting these books when they first came out and got to meet Steven in San Diego for a signing when the hardback for DG came out.  I read the first two and for whatever reason got caught up in other things (college, etc.) but now aiming to actually get through it all.  The Malazan wiki is helping...but damn the spoilers, already read one I didn't mean to.  They should block out the text...  Anyway, thanks again, everyone!  Really appreciate it!"
Malazan,2ism4b,ghoulbuns,1 point,Fri Oct 10 17:24:54 2014 UTC,"Dude I was so confused and overwhelmed during my first reading.  I would say do not give up.   At some point before the books ending you will somehow gel with the style and the possibilities of the world SE has created here.  If you're anything like me, the moment the book ends you will immediately reread it, now that you have some idea of the confines and exciting layers of mythology and mystery that lie in the novels.  I will also say that these books are not made for everyone, though I hope they are made for you."
Malazan,2irmdv,NotTheGodricWhoFled,4,Thu Oct 9 15:39:29 2014 UTC,I just finished TCG a few days ago. I can't wait to reread everything to catch stuff like that.

I sorta thought the same thing. Always some new species or Elder warren to explain something. But, really, it is just that vast. And it all works and fits together once you get the whole picture"
Malazan,2iryas,AladoraB,5,Thu Oct 9 17:29:00 2014 UTC,"First, on NoK, it has nothing to do with the main Malazan books. The only reason people recommend you read it before BoneHunters is because some of the characters and locations present within NoK comes back in Bonehunters. Having already read it, you can read NoK anytime you want. I recommend doing so, it's only 400 or so pages and it's not inherently a bad tale, just poorly written.   It's trickier to determine RotCG and TtH. Do you have to read RotCG? No, most certainly not. However, there's a reveal at the end of Reaper's Gale that provides the perfect segue into RotCG, so it's truly the ideal place to read it. Furthermore, there's a pretty major event that happens near the end of the book that's mentioned in either TtH or Dust of Dreams, so if you want the full impact of it, it's best to read RotCG.   The downside however, is that when you compare ICE's books to Erikson's, they're not as good. They're decent in their own right, but when compared, they fall short; especially the earlier ones.   My personal recommendation is to read NoK, then RotCG, followed by TtH. NoK is a short read; you should be able to knock it out within a couple days. Use that to determine whether you like ICE's writing style. If not, skip RotCG, go with TtH, and come back to his books later."
Malazan,2iryas,Therrester,2,Thu Oct 9 18:08:03 2014 UTC,"I was in your position a few weeks ago. I decided to only read the ICE novels after I'm done with the main series. I'm almost done with Dust of Dreams and I've had no issues. There is...an event...in RotCG that is mentioned in TtH, and another that is mentioned in DoD, but I don't think you need to read a separate book in order to catch up with those stories. If you have no problem fitting things together after the main series, do what I did. If you'd like to get a big picture before you read tCG, read the ICE novels."
Malazan,2iryas,PromisedPrince694,1 point,Fri Oct 10 19:42:10 2014 UTC,I would of read NoK before Bonehunters and Return before RG so I'd read them both before TTH if you think you can cram more characters in your head of course lol. It's hard on a first read to remember everyone
Malazan,2iryas,SerBronnofBlackwater,1 point,Thu Oct 9 17:59:59 2014 UTC,I just read 1-10 and then the ice books. I enjoyed it that way although I know some people read them in a more linear fashion.   Go on to toll the hounds! My favorite book of them all...   I read night of knives before rotcg but it could go either way. NoK is the worst ice book in my opinion but at least it's short.
Malazan,2io8b9,Zingbrit,9,Wed Oct 8 16:29:42 2014 UTC,Training his whole life and epic sword.  The thing I assume is that ascension plays a major factor in the big personalities being so capable.  There is a path to ascension and people can be on varying levels of it I think.  Also the Shake are an ancient order and The Watch is in my view comparable to like a Mortal sword and this may lend ability to the person.  As you mention Kalam I would point out he does things well beyond his mortal kin. Kalam is ascending of course and this lends to his ability. Erikson doesn't ever give an ascension level or power level so it is confusing.  Edit: word
Malazan,2io8b9,Aiolus,2,Wed Oct 8 17:11:09 2014 UTC,I wasn't sure if being the Watch inherently enhanced his abilities in any way. But the idea of scales of ascendancy and such makes sense. I just never got the sense that Yedan was anything more than human.
Malazan,2io8b9,Aiolus,3,Wed Oct 8 18:57:50 2014 UTC,Human and part Tiste Andi.  In the world as we've seen human often do incredible things. Admittedly he does some INCREDIBLE things! I don't think Erikson overlooked the fact that a base human doing these things is absurd and by implementing ascendancy I felt he addressed this. Sort of like the Ta'Vern (spl) in WoT. Also like David Gemmel had a luck based power that certain heroes had begins with an R I think.  My biggest issue is why dragons would ever fly near anyone lol. If I were the Dragon I'd be flying way out of reach and throwing magic Or stuff.
Malazan,2io8b9,Foliagus,2,Wed Oct 8 19:05:22 2014 UTC,"Yeah I feel like dragons should only really have to worry about being attacked by other dragons. Though on the Shore they had to come through the small breach at ground level, which seems like just asking to get their heads chopped off."
Malazan,2io8b9,TMTC,8,Wed Oct 8 19:22:08 2014 UTC,"Why was brys a godly swordsman?  Why was tehol so smart?  Why was paran so wise?  They're all powerful people man, it's a chance thing.  And the hust sword is indicated to be sentient, I'd imagine that helps enormously."
Malazan,2io8b9,Foliagus,5,Wed Oct 8 17:18:59 2014 UTC,"Ya, from what I got I thought the Sword was doing a lot of the fighting for him."
Malazan,2io8b9,Thomo87,3,Wed Oct 8 18:39:20 2014 UTC,"Right, but the things Yedan do in combat seem superhuman. Brys and Tehol just seem like skilled individuals with lots of practice."
Malazan,2io8b9,Foliagus,4,Wed Oct 8 18:55:47 2014 UTC,"Brys wins against a godly defender dude. And tehol resets an entire economic system of a nation.  You're underestimating them and overestimating yedan.  if karsa had a hust sword, he wouldn't have had a hard time versus the hounds.  Didn't he not even have his epic flint sword by then?"
Malazan,2io8b9,tripod-pop,7,Wed Oct 8 19:56:03 2014 UTC,"I believe Karsa also fought bare handed, so there's that"

Malazan,2io8b9,turnpikenorth,2,Wed Oct 8 20:36:26 2014 UTC,"Is it possible that the Beddicts are descended from some form of BA thing? I mean, in addition to the ascendancy; although, I don't remember Tehol ascending to anything other than the rooftop and Emporor."
Malazan,2io8b9,SerBronnofBlackwater,10,Thu Oct 9 02:57:03 2014 UTC,"He seems to have some sort of ancestral memory-  perhaps that also translates to ancestral fighting skills, leading all the way back to when the Shake were still Tiste. In Forge of Darkness, the Tiste had somewhat recently fought a war with the ""Forulkan,"" so perhaps his ancestral skills are uniquely suited to fighting the Forkrul Assail.  Against the Liosan, Hust Swords are OP as fuck."
Malazan,2io8b9,titanemesis,4,Wed Oct 8 17:11:10 2014 UTC,You'll understand more of the Shake and the sheer power of a hust sword after reading Forge of Darkness.
Malazan,2io8b9,ameyp,3,Wed Oct 8 17:14:47 2014 UTC,I'm looking forward to it.
Malazan,2io8b9,ScaraBandaris,6,Wed Oct 8 18:56:07 2014 UTC,"Well the Hust sword is crazy amazing so that's why he does so good on the Shore. As for before, it's never really explained but the Watch is kind of a big deal so I imagine he's been training his whole life."
Malazan,2io8b9,ameyp,1 point,Wed Oct 8 16:38:30 2014 UTC,"As an addition to all the notes about Hust swords being fucking OP: remember Andarist's sword, Grief (once known as Vengeance)?  Unless i'm very mistaken, that too is a Hust sword. And dude, that sword fucked some seriously scary bitches up.  Basically, don't fuck with the business end of a Hust sword."
Malazan,2io8b9,ScaraBandaris,3,Wed Oct 8 20:46:08 2014 UTC,"You're not mistaken, it's Forge of Darkness spoiler"

Malazan,2iicwt,gomesburger,6,Tue Oct 7 01:08:06 2014 UTC,"Names and mythology are tricky and often ambiguous.  Burn's flesh often refers to the earth itself. Recall when Brood broke open the ground with his hammer when Kruppe pissed him off? I'm pretty sure the cracks had tainted blood in them. If it wasn't on that occasion, it was a different one. Warrens can sort of be considered to be parts of the materials that they are associated with. Practitioners of Meanas move through shadows, Quick Ben uses Driss and Serc to move through earth and air respectively in MoI prior to the encounter with the necromancers. Often, the more powerfully present an element is, the more powerful the warren is at that location.  However, the goddess ""Burn"" (as I've interpreted it) can also be a sort of catch-all title for the various earth mother goddesses that different cultures have. They could either be considered different deities or aspects of the same one.  In fact, I can think of at least 3 specific instances where a being is called Burn, and I'm pretty sure they aren't exactly the same being by standard measures."

Malazan,2iicwt,SageOfTheWise,2,Tue Oct 7 15:49:49 2014 UTC,"As the other guy said, there is the one in FoD, and theoretically the current Burn of ""Burn's Sleep"" which is poisoned by TCG is different than the one in FoD, considering ""Burn's Sleep"" didn't start that long ago (relatively speaking) and the way that the goddess is described in FoD. There is also the case of the Mhybe, who is kinda like the ""Burn"" of the T'lan afterlife."
Malazan,2iicwt,GuudeSpelur,2,Tue Oct 7 16:07:03 2014 UTC,"considering ""Burn's Sleep"" didn't start that long ago (relatively speaking)   I haven't read FoD yet, but here's an important thing about Burn's Sleep I stumbled on recently:   Re: Burn’s Sleep. No, Burn didn’t wake up 1200 years earlier. That’s just when those people started counting via her reference. But it may be that something happened 1200 years earlier that could have been interpreted as Burn waking up. Say like, an earthquake, or a sorcerous conflagration. Or the historian fell down the stairs after an all-night drinking binge. Bearing all that in mind, be advised that sometimes things are just made up because they sound intriguing.   Source  So we can't trust anything about the dating system to tell us when Burn was sleeping or awake. Maybe this reconciles the Burn we know about in the main series and the one in FoD?"

Itkovian was definitely a sort of Jesus esque figure but much more than Jesus as he doesn't want or demand observance or prayer or worship. He did it because he's The Shield and because compassion should be given with no expectations. What a character!

He pretty much wanders around telling stories, knocks over a few tables, heals sick people, and then gets killed as a sacrifice for everybody else. Itkovian is literally just Imass Jesus with less powers."

Malazan,2ihqn6,Foliagus,2,Sun Oct 12 00:47:19 2014 UTC,I'm an atheist and was raised Jewish so I may be wrong but Jesus was sent by God who does demand those things. Depending on the variant of Christianity Jesus God and the ghost are a trinity and the same entity.   Jesus did not act on his own behalf if he is a part of the trinity in which case he personally demands worship. If he is seperate from god then he was sent and acted on behalf of one who does demand worship.  Edit: words
Malazan,2ihqn6,Aiolus,3,Tue Oct 7 00:25:50 2014 UTC,Itkovian definitely is T'Lan Jesus.  But did Silverfox create it or did K'rul and Kruppe create it for the Mahybe and the I'mass kind of landed there and were like this is perfect?

Malazan,2ihqn6,turnpikenorth,1 point,Wed Oct 8 18:38:07 2014 UTC,I can't comment on the first part because whenever a Mhybe POV came my mind tended to...wander. however for the second part sure why not!
Malazan,2ihqn6,SerBronnofBlackwater,1 point,Mon Oct 6 22:41:00 2014 UTC,Sort of. I think that Kruppe and K'rul created the world for the Mhybe.   Shield Anvil. Mortal Sword. Different titles. Shield Anvil Itkovian is definitely 'lan Imass Jesus.

Malazan,2igs5v,SerBronnofBlackwater,2,Mon Oct 6 20:34:18 2014 UTC,"So about the events in Dragnipur...it seems as if the forging of the sword had a lot to do with chains, and we all know who to think of when we read ""chains."" Does this mean that he is stronger, now that Dragnipur has been broken? Or is he even weaker?   AFAIK, the Crippled God isn't involved here. He's not directly impacted by the breaking of this sword itself. That's not to say there couldn't be other consequences to releasing those chained inside.   And what was Hood doing? Who did he make a deal with; Shadowthrone and Rake? Quick Ben and Ganoes Paran?   TtH    The Jaghut fought against death, but Hood was not the King of Death at the time. However he was king of something because the Second mentions it. Was he king of the Jaghut? King of the Hold of Ice?   You'll have this answered for you if you read Forge of Darkness. I assume there will be more details in the other books in that trilogy."
Malazan,2igs5v,majiinbuu,1 point,Tue Oct 7 00:35:07 2014 UTC,"Thanks, I thought that it was those three in the prologue!  However I still don't understand what Hood gets out of this deal unless he is just over being King of High House Death; although why anyone would ever get tired of having such a metal title is unknowable to me. Rake gets mummy back and Shadowthrone's motivations will probably be more clear later on."
Malazan,2igs5v,titanemesis,3,Tue Oct 7 00:54:05 2014 UTC,"Just a quick note with regard to the people 'released' by the sword: if there's anything the Malazan books should show you, it's that 'good' and 'evil' are notoriously subjective.   While there are a few clear-cut bastards in the series (obligatory 'Fuck the Errant'), Erikson does a pretty good job of putting conflicts in perspective for both sides (e.g. the Pannion Seer).  What does any of this have to do with Dragnipur's breaking? Well: Rake has been alive a long time. His allegiances and motivations have probably changed a lot since that time as well. So not everyone in the sword is necessarily a twat. Perhaps not even half. And if they were when they went in, they've had a LOT of time to re-think how being a twat worked out for them."

But totally, they've had a lot of time to rethink their lives. Kadaspala...debatable, but I'm convinced he'd be in the Karkhanas trilogy so I have to read that before making a solid judgment on him.  I still don't know if the Errant is one of the clear-cut individuals. I see him as the anti-Bugg. Mael was bored so he went to live among humans; Bugg is usually a nice person, he helps people etc. Errastas...I don't know exactly why he stays around people but he's always been around royalty, I can see him becoming a bit of a tool. But again, I'd have to read the Karkhanas trilogy to see more because I'm sure he's going to be in it. He actually may have always been that way.  Personally, I like to think that Dragnipur is a sort of extreme rehab and it makes you rethink exactly what you did wrong to end up there. Even Draconus seemed changed by it. I can't wait to see what he's up to, I've already started Dust of Dreams."

Malazan,2ifk8o,kerrzo89,8,Mon Oct 6 08:42:54 2014 UTC,"Just one that I can think of straight up was from the beginning DG, it's something you can't remotely make sense of unless you've read HoC. It's at the start of the second chapter, Duiker is witnessing a prophecy by a Semk seer who uses a blind boy as part of his ritual while pretending to be a 'Dosii'.   The boy suddenly threw back his head, words coming from his throat like the grinding of stones. ‘Two fountains of raging blood! Face to face. The blood is the same, the two are the same and salty waves shall wash the shores of Raraku. The Holy Desert remembers its past!’   I just liked that it was straight to the point about the events of HoC, blatant really, unlike most foreshadowing in the series which is pretty cryptic. Though you can actually make sense of the cryptic stuff, this is obvious but you can only understand it on a reread, it's the first big one in the series on a reread, or at least that I found, that was so easy to understand in retrospect but couldn't make sense unless you'd read the books before.  There's little things everywhere though."

Malazan,2idxp6,allthingsfluff,23,Sun Oct 5 20:59:27 2014 UTC,"I would say it is the only fantasy world I have read that compares to Tolkiens Middle Earth in terms of epic scope, history, culture and fascinating people. I would even go so far as to say it is MORE diverse and richly textured than Middle Earth, though perhaps not so heavily documented.   For example the people/races/species in Middle Earth are - on the whole, pretty black & white. As in on one side you have the ""good guys"" and on the other, the ""bad guys."" I know this is an oversimplification but as far as the World of Malazan goes,  you could meet 3 different people on the same ""side"" and get 3 different views.  Throughout the books you get lots of rich history, diverse cultures and diverse landscapes and settings. It is one of the few fantasy worlds that is not obviously heavily influenced by Tolkien. Sure, you have dragons (though even they are not the same thing) but tropes are inverted all over the place!  Realised I haven't really answered your question but the series is so massive that I can't easily answer it. Let me finish with this: After writing the 10 books of the main series and 6 books of the companion series by Ian Cameron Esselmont, Steven Erikson is writing a prequel trilogy which deals with the origins of a bunch of the species, cultures and characters from the main series.  I hope I have somehow conveyed how truly well written the world building is in this series. I also warn you that if you do start to read it, don't expect anything to be handed to you and a lot of things will not make sense for a long time. I truly hope you read these books and fall in love with the superb world of Malazan like so many of us have done.  Edit: Hoods marble balls on an anvil I was gilded! Queen of Dreams bless you!"

While I'd prefer more of both I understand compromises have to be made, a human life is only so long to write these things.   A gross oversimplification but I understand exactly what you mean. :P It is actually one of my only gripes of Tolkien's work. There are hints of that within the history but it was never fleshed out much (whether that be due to his death or never intending to).  I actually JUST made a comment about that elsewhere and it makes me happy to hear. When I want Tolkien I'll read Tolkien, original ideas..whether entirely or simply spins on old ones are much more exciting than people just reworking Tolkien's.  I appreciate the long reply, it definitely gave me some answers I was looking for, even if indirect. While at the moment I don't have plans to rush out and buy all of the books at once I'll definitely be grabbing the first one and testing the waters with it at least. I'm intrigued enough to want to see what it's all about. Rich worlds are few and far between sadly, so it's not something I want to miss out on."

At least Malazan introduced me to the world through action and plot, it doesn't baby you, it's like you're listening to people talk and think about history, and guess what? It isn't written in stone, it's open to interpretation.  This is the greatest series I've ever read, and I've got two bookcases filled with fantasy and science fiction. It's ridiculous. The sheer imagination of the world is astounding, much more reliant upon a non-typical mythos. No dwarves, no elves, but crazy dinosaur people, and weird troll-like warlords, besides the crazy tiste's.  I recommend reading the first two books, it'll get you stuck."

Malazan,2idxp6,SerBronnofBlackwater,8,Mon Oct 6 02:02:48 2014 UTC,"Tolkien and Erikson's worlds are very comparable. Tolkien was more of a linguist, so he had lots of languages. However, Erikson is an archaeologist (or something of that kind).  The world of Malazan is very huge and old. There are dozens of races and ethnicities. There are hundreds of thousands of years of history. The magic system is very intricate.  The series is very different from LotR. You are dropped into the plot midway through. It's like if you started LotR when Frodo is running from the Ringwraiths. You are dropped in and have to figure things out for yourself. There are hundreds of characters and books can have as many as two dozen main characters. The books take place in different places and only start to converge around book six.  However, don't let this be a deterrent. The series is amazing, both in it's writing and worldbuilding. If you like Tolkien, you will defenitely like Malazan. I consider the author, Steven Erikson, second only to Tolkien.  For clarification, Malazan is written by two authors, who created the world together back in the 80s. Steven Erikson is the better author, who wrote the Malazan book of the fallen. This is the main series and consists of ten books. He is also writing a trilogy, and has another planned when he's done that. His friend, Ian Cameron Esslemont (ICE) wrote his own series called Novels of the Malazan Empire. There are six of these, and they act as companions to the Malazan Book of the Fallen, with some of their own characters. I have heard (although I haven't read any of his books), that he is not as good as Erikson, and suffers from trying to imitate him at times.  Tl;Dr: If you like Tolkien, this is the series for you. Top notch worldbuilding, writing, and plots."
Malazan,2idxp6,HumbleAsFudge,1 point,Sun Oct 5 21:20:52 2014 UTC,"I can definitely see why that'd be concerning for some people, but I actually don't mind the midway plot aspect. I'll also probably re-read them 10 times over if I really get into them so while all of the characters and what not might be an issue at first I'll surely adjust.  Definitely interested from the few replies I've gotten so far though. I'll make sure to grab a book at start soonish. You had me at ""The world of Malazan is very huge and old"" haha."
Malazan,2idxp6,Aiolus,5,Sun Oct 5 21:36:42 2014 UTC,"This is definitely a series that demands re-reads.  S..o much of what is going on goes over your head because you are ""trying to figure it out"" on the first read."
Malazan,2idxp6,Aiolus,2,Sun Oct 5 22:28:14 2014 UTC,"Well, I hope you enjoy. I certainly did."
Malazan,2idxp6,Aiolus,5,Sun Oct 5 21:43:58 2014 UTC,"In this world, there are many, many different races, sub races, traditions, ethnicities, nations, and magic systems, and you're going to be bombarded and it's highly intimidating initially. Do not worry, we all felt this way.  Imagine it's like you've found a historians book and he has written it the way he has because he understands the terms and jargon and definitions of that time and you have to piece together what things mean by context and clues. It's part of the fun of Malazan. There are many, many moments where you will go ""Ah HAH!"" and ""Oooooooh!"" as you piece together different plots and characters from within the book as well as between books.  Gardens of the Moon is generally considered to be the hardest book to get into in the series. It's not bad by any means but Erickson wrote it nine years before starting the rest of the series and it was his first novel and it shows sometimes. Just stick with it.  The maps and character list in the front and the glossary in the back of the book are your friends. Especially the glossary.  Just dive in and just stick with it and let yourself be enveloped. You probably feel like you got dropped into a foreign country with no dictionary and no sense of history of the place and who the heck are all these people!? This is normal! Erickson does not do infodumps and can be heavy on the introspective philosophy. Every chapter you read uncovers a bit more of the Malazan world. Every book starts off with a lot of character development, history of the place they are in, geography, important events, etc. Each book is usually 3/4 buildup/plot and the last quarter is where the ""Convergence"" happens ie: crazy epic action/drama/weepiness/exhilaration.  You'll switch books and sometimes be on an entirely different continent with new characters and situations.  In Book 6 it all starts to come together and all the subplots and main plots weave together through the remaining books to culminate in the Crippled God.  The series is wonderful, amazing, crying into the books good. Its even better on a reread. It's also intimidating as hell. No shame if you put Gardens of the Moon down halfway through with a ""I have no freaking clue what is going on"" feeling. But if you stick with it, and you like it, you'll never look at other fantasy the same way again. It's that phenomenal. Read at least through book 2 or 3. Deadhouse Gates got me truly hooked, but Memories of Ice was the one that made me say, ""Okay, I'm going to be rereading this for the rest of my life and this gets a permanent place on my bookshelves at eye level, and now I'm off to find the hardcovers even though I already have all the mass market/ebooks.""  Sorry if I sound like a fanboy gushing, but I found it to be just that amazing. Welcome to the sub! Ask any questions and post your impressions and if you end up not liking it, no shame at all. No book is for everyone! It is an amazing series lore wise. You could debate about it and go deep into the little details forever. Erickson is an archeologist and an anthropologist and it really shows in his literature."
Malazan,2idxp6,mmSNAKE,1 point,Sun Oct 5 22:34:49 2014 UTC,"Thank you for taking the time to reply, and with such a long one! No worries about the gushing. It's how I am with Tolkien when people tell me all they've read by Tolkien is LOTR/Hobbit and I want to yell in excitement about how they haven't even scratched the scratch of the surface. :P  Seeing excitement from others definitely makes it easier to get excited yourself after all!"
Malazan,2idxp6,JestaKilla,2,Sun Oct 5 22:41:53 2014 UTC,Most on genealogy I think. History is a big factor too. There are different languages but they're not explored.
Malazan,2icdc4,DuckDuckFlow,5,Sun Oct 5 07:53:07 2014 UTC,"I can kind of tell you what's up. It's kind of two things, but it can be narrowed down to the result: the tin mirror shouldn't be noticeably losing polish between two days, so there's a high humidity. That and some other environmental factors will make the tin tarnish more rapidly. This is what the captain is referring to when saying that he will ""take advantage"" of it. I don't know anything about sailing however, so I don't know why that makes his boat more likely to have an advantage over the other ships. Maybe it means there'll be more mist in the morning to cover that they're dropping back in line with them before trying to board, or it could be a host of other things, maybe someone with more knowledge on that can chip in there.  It becomes increasingly obvious with hints, but isn't explicitly stated until much later in the book - thus the spoiler tag because I don't want to ruin it for you or anyone else - I guess that's more something you'll probably figure out with a bit further reading, or once you've finished the book read this comment and you'll have a bit of an 'ah' moment.  It's a good pick up that there's something more to this though, there is otherwise I wouldn't have anything to spoiler tag. If you want to, try to read into it a bit more, that section just around there is enough to suss out the ""mystery"" of the Ragstopper, or at least the part pertaining to the story.  Sorry if that's a bit confusing, I don't want to ruin anything, nor make you agonise over it or put you off thinking about it either, I assume that's why a seemingly simple question has no answers yet."

Malazan,2i6t9a,ilikealphabitsoup,4,Fri Oct 3 15:24:53 2014 UTC,I thought I would have had a bigger reaction to Whiskeyjack but Itkovian broke me like Bane broke Batman
Malazan,2i6t9a,Bayakoo,3,Fri Oct 3 15:28:28 2014 UTC,"I didn't really mind that Whiskeyjack died because a) he was old and b) he died because of his own stubbornness.  He was a hero in the strictest sense of the word and a character I loved, for sure, but it wasn't as emotionally impacting as Itkovian's death, or especially Coltaine's.  I love your Bane analogy, by the way.  Perfect way to describe it."
Malazan,2i6t9a,ilikealphabitsoup,3,Fri Oct 3 15:30:57 2014 UTC,I was slicing onions when I read that passage.
Malazan,2i6t9a,Bayakoo,4,Fri Oct 3 15:23:03 2014 UTC,Seriously.  I hardly ever cry when reading but Itkovian's sacrifice was beautiful in how utterly selfless it was and how accepting he was of it.
Malazan,2i6t9a,ilikealphabitsoup,3,Fri Oct 3 15:25:30 2014 UTC,"Also the funeral, with everyone coming. Shudders. His last scenes hit me more than Coltaine maybe because we saw him from his POV it was easier to connect with Itkovian."
Malazan,2i6t9a,SerBronnofBlackwater,2,Fri Oct 3 15:42:33 2014 UTC,"That scene, too, was heart-wrenching.  But with Coltaine I was more heartbroken because he was such a larger-than-life figure who survived against all odds, only to die at the hands of incompetence and betrayal. Coltaine was at first a stranger and a savage, until you learn he was actually a very shrewd and tactical genius who put the fate of those in his charge ahead of his own. Itkovian was a close runner-up, but I personally feel this was a case of witnessing the bigger someone is, the harder they fall."
Malazan,2i6t9a,ilikealphabitsoup,2,Fri Oct 3 15:50:46 2014 UTC,"When he started the whole ""I am not yet done,"" line I figured how his story was gonna end but it still hit hard."
Malazan,2i6t9a,zerro_4,1 point,Sat Oct 4 18:49:06 2014 UTC,"I'd agree in the implication that it seemed as if his fate was written from the beginning.  It definitely set up his death to be immensely tragic as a result, especially since Itkovian was the archetypal hero."
Malazan,2i6t9a,zerro_4,3,Sat Oct 4 22:02:58 2014 UTC,"Warren stuff gets explained more as you go through.  I don't think tCG is from chaos, though. His followers use chaos in conjunction with his power."

Malazan,2i6t9a,sohma2501,3,Sat Oct 4 22:07:32 2014 UTC,"So from my understanding, the Crippled God is not from the Warren of Chaos.  Instead, the Crippled God is using that power from that warren because he is otherwise limited by his chaining.    You are correct that the Dragons are related to the Warrens, but incorrect I believe about K'rul giving birth to them or Mother Dark.  I remember that K'rul made a bargain with the dragons, to divide up the dragons and help limit the damage done by their chaotic nature and their struggles for power.  The Andii think that they were the first beings in creation, the first children of Mother Dark.  That's probably wrong, since it doesn't account for the existence of the Elder Gods nor the K'Chain.  From my impression, it's the K'Chain that were likeliest to have been the first.  Part of the problem is that everyone confusingly mixes the term ""world' where they perhaps mean ""continent.""  Meanwhile there are indeed sometimes people from other ""worlds"" (or dimensions) as we think of them.  The magic(Holds) of the Elder gods seems to run from the power of blood.  The warrens appear to be different because they don't require blood, but that is in reality wrong because the warrens run off K'rul's blood exclusively.    You are correct that Elder Gods existed before K'rul made the warrens.  Unfortunately, the complexity of the relationship between Elder Warrens is furthered by the fact that there appear to be Elder warrens that have somehow become a part of the Warrens.    Warrens are confusing, yeah."
Malazan,2i6t9a,milk72,1 point,Fri Oct 3 21:44:10 2014 UTC,Thanks for all of this. It clears up a lot of stuff. I can't wait to learn more about the Dragons and K'Chain.
Malazan,2i6t9a,sohma2501,2,Fri Oct 3 22:25:50 2014 UTC,"To be honest don't get too worked up about ""understanding"" the warrens. I've read everything by both authors multiple times and I still don't fully get it. Plus there is a lot more about the origins of magic in later books (MT will confound you at first, if you have questions now, just you wait!)  Also there is now 1 book of a prequel trilogy that goes a lot further in explaining origins etc. So you have a heck of a lot of reading to but but by heck it's worth it!"

Stories have different acts so the characters can become what they need to be to face what's to come. The bonehunters needed Yghatan to come together so they can be ready for the next part of their journey."
Malazan,2i4r5z,Aiolus,1 point,Fri Oct 3 00:09:20 2014 UTC,"Right, we had two books in Raraku/Seven Cities and we now have the 14th that respects Tavore and the BH that... are respected too, for surviving? Bonded together because they survived?  I haven't finished the book yet, I've caught glimpses of some BH song whilst checking up names and such so I guess I don't know everything I need to to judge; still at this juncture clearing up the rebellion feels like just some thing that happened. The 14th didn't really do anything, and they're just being shoved around a map until they get somewhere they will, presumably, be useful (let's face it though, they'll land on Lether, be ripped apart by bone lightning and it will continue to be the Fidds and co show).  I just feel like there is a lot of wandering around without much aim, and most of the time when there is an aim one of the twenty other plot strings will intersect, there will usually be some semi-deity involved, and it will that deity that will clear things up, rather than the person we've been following actually getting to have some closure and agency.  Like Green Hands and co. Erickson decided that Felision Younger needed to be Sha'ik Reborn so he slaughters the rest of the group and stops us getting proper payoff from Green Hands getting Otataral. Two confusing POVs where he randomly comes back to become Shield Anvil don't count..."
Malazan,2i4r5z,sthreet,1 point,Fri Oct 3 06:43:57 2014 UTC,"Just to address your last statement about the length and employability of the books.  Yes certain parts are more exciting then others, which I like. The length has never been an issue for me as I've always read really long books, I find it lets me enjoy the story longer and of course means a lot more will explain.  As an example I grew up reading David Gemmel and his books rock. However I can easily read then in a couple days. I also grew up reading the order chaos series by LE Modesitt, these are fairly long and pretty in-depth. Its more like entering an actual world. So both are awesome but for varied reasons.   As to Eriksons representation of the world, I've always found a huge part of history to be a tragic and depressing event. I feel he stays true to what a real history of burgeoning races and peoples would show.   The books is a history and we all know history has tangents which may not be central to everything, but Eriksons convergence and over arching story sure felt connected to me.  Anyways his books don't get any shorter! Read then slowly and read other things while you're reading these if you want to finish them and dislike the length and pace (it's what I do for the WoT series)  A recommendation is The Powder Mage Trilogy. And the oblivious authors like Sanderson."
Malazan,2i3ivh,Renegaides,11,Thu Oct 2 15:28:01 2014 UTC,Eh. I know I'm the huge outlier but GotM is one of my top ones. I just really like Darujhistan and it's characters. Anything set there becomes instant gold for me. My ultimate Malazan blaspheme is that I rate it above DG.

I always pictured Traveller as a tall strictly athletic and completely not bulky type.   I pictured his build to be like 6- 65"" at around 220-250 with a large/deep chest, expansive back, a thicker waist then normal but still somewhat tapered from broad shoulders. Long legs but thick.

Made infinitely more uncomfortable if he is opposed by characters I love.   Destroying civilization is beyond pointless. Maybe Karsa will go and bring Barbarian justice to a distant civilization which is not at all civilized (like Jakura(spl) from BaB). I guess Karsa could exterminate all humans and put the Teblor into the number one role. Being a human myself I am hoping and assuming Karsa will be crushed :-\ :'( :-\    Tldr; I hope it isn't about Karsa destroying civilization. If it is I hope Kruppe/Tehol smashes him brilliantly.

Malazan,2i1l8u,SerBronnofBlackwater,1 point,Thu Oct 2 13:44:59 2014 UTC,"I'm actually way more excited for the Karsa trilogy than the Tiste one. Hopefully it'll not only give us a satisfying conclusion to Karsa's story but also fill in some of the gaps left by the BOTF (although maybe some of those are covered in Esslemont, haven't read him yet but will interweave his books with my ongoing chapter-a-day reread)"
Malazan,2i1l8u,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Thu Oct 2 10:18:36 2014 UTC,"Nah Karsa is Erikson's baby, he ain't in ICE"
Malazan,2i1l8u,SerBronnofBlackwater,1 point,Thu Oct 2 16:08:50 2014 UTC,"I imagine Seven Cities would become involved, or more specifically the Cult of the Apocalypse. Erikson really spent a lot of time setting up that plot and it never really went anywhere."
Malazan,2i1l8u,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Thu Oct 2 14:11:36 2014 UTC,Well I mean Karsa might want to conquer civilizations but I mean he's got like what a couple hundred/thousands Treblor in those mountains? They may be big but I mean they can still die. And dem Malazans be crafty.   I just hope we get more characters from BotF like the Parans or Bonehunters/Bridgeburners.
Malazan,2i1l8u,SerBronnofBlackwater,1 point,Thu Oct 2 16:12:12 2014 UTC,I don't think any/many malazans will be involved as Assail is said to be the last novel of the malazan empire.
Malazan,2i1l8u,SageOfTheWise,2,Thu Oct 2 19:22:53 2014 UTC,"That's not what that meant. ICE's books, going from Night of Knives to Assail, is a series titled 'Novels of the Malazan Empire'. Assail wasn't the last book they'll write about the empire, its just literally the last in that series. In fact ICE is already planning out a prequel trilogy about Kellanved and Dancer's rise to power. The first book is currently going to be called Dancer's Lament."

Malazan,2hyyol,AllWrong74,4,Wed Oct 1 07:43:30 2014 UTC,"About 375 pages into this on my first reread. I am just watching it unfold all over, I got goose bumps just thinking about it!!"
Malazan,2hyyol,JaceQQ,1 point,Wed Oct 1 16:52:57 2014 UTC,I'm 600 pages into TTH. I have such a bad feeling about this book O_O
Malazan,2hyyol,PromisedPrince694,9,Wed Oct 1 18:16:00 2014 UTC,One of us....
Malazan,2hyyol,absolut696,5,Wed Oct 1 12:32:20 2014 UTC,"Heh, don't worry we all felt the same way. Get ready for House of Chains! It's not as intense as MoI, but it has its moments and has plenty of characters you know and love as well as a few new ones, including one you may have read about before in Deadhouse Gates....House of Chains connects several past dots in the series, and you can start putting it all together, plenty of ""Oooooh!"" and ""Ah-HAH!"" moments. Glad you're liking the series! Any favorite parts? Itvokian? Whiskeyjack? Caladan vs Kruppe? Rake being a badass? Quick Ben vs. the necromancers? The WTF of the Tenniscowri? The pure awesomeness of the idea of the K'Chain Che'malle and the Segulah? And poor Toc? Icarium and Mappo's merry adventures?  The drama of Apsalar and Crokus? Fiddler being Fiddler? All of the above?"
Malazan,2hyyol,TriscuitCracker,2,Wed Oct 1 13:09:12 2014 UTC,"so far the 3rd book is my favorite,but new to the series and just finished the 3rd book last night...getting ready to start the fourth book."
Malazan,2hyyol,sohma2501,4,Wed Oct 1 22:51:00 2014 UTC,"So far, Im very much enjoying Kalam and Coltaine (Im assuming he isn't dead forever, what with his giant soul), I feel so bad for Icarium (but maybe I shouldn't), and the whole drama behind Kellenved/Dancer is super interesting. I really can't wait until I'm further along"
Malazan,2hyyol,TriscuitCracker,3,Wed Oct 1 17:04:52 2014 UTC,You're going to love it. And yes you should feel sorry for Icarium. Think of him as the Incredible Hulk of the Malazan world.
Malazan,2hyyol,TisteSimeon,1 point,Wed Oct 1 17:53:00 2014 UTC,"The only issue I'm having is all this terminology that gets thrown around - mostly the Warren names - and just so many characters that show up, seem important, and then disappear (like Mallick Rel in Deadhouse). There's so many names and terms to remember!"
Malazan,2hyyol,itkovian,4,Wed Oct 1 21:12:53 2014 UTC,"Heh. Every time you think Erikson can't mess you up, he does it again. I was a wreck a number of times reading through this series. Heck, DG made me cry on a bus after reading it for the fifth time!!"

Malazan,2hypli,Noshiba6,9,Wed Oct 1 13:29:56 2014 UTC,"So you think that's the big tragedy?   Hoo boy, I both pity and envy what you got coming. Keep reading, and keep us informed, I enjoyed reading your description of it. Thank you!"
Malazan,2hypli,montaron87td,6,Wed Oct 1 11:13:18 2014 UTC,"Man....if you react this way to this particular incident, and yes it was tragic, you're going to drown in tears and your heart is going to leap out of its chest several times over. Just finish DG and come back and post about it. cues maniacal laughter"
Malazan,2hypli,wheeloficeandfire,3,Wed Oct 1 13:12:42 2014 UTC,Yeah...if you think this is bad...I would suggest grief counseling and lots of it. Just to finish the series. Not to belittle your feelings but you gonna need it.

And, there's a part early on when Tool is walking with Envy where it's said that he has his warren tightly around him or something like that and that his usage of the warren is unique because of his role as First Sword and being an outcast."
Malazan,2ht9pw,Murse_Jon,6,Mon Sep 29 18:54:35 2014 UTC,"The Subterranean Press editions of the books contain illustrations. I'm not aware of any site that has them all. Here is one though, Raest vs Silannah.   Edit: Artist is Michael Kormack"
Malazan,2ht9pw,no_social_skills,3,Tue Sep 30 01:53:15 2014 UTC,"Aside from the maps, I would say there really aren't any official images, including covers. Steve and Cam don't really do pictures, and they have talked in interviews about how the book covers are done by other people and don't really match that well with the ideas in their own heads. Even simple things like skin and hair color get messed up on the covers."
Malazan,2ht9pw,ScaraBandaris,1 point,Mon Sep 29 20:12:59 2014 UTC,Well damn. Seeing what some of these badass characters look like (in the authors' heads) would be nice. I guess fan art is better than nothing though. Thanks for the info.
Malazan,2ht9pw,ScaraBandaris,2,Mon Sep 29 23:55:22 2014 UTC,"Yeah, sorry to let you down. Maybe someday we'll get an encyclopedia or something."
Malazan,2ht9pw,cantlurkanymore,1 point,Tue Sep 30 11:55:09 2014 UTC,there's a ton of fan illustrations here. some are pretty decent.  http://forum.malazanempire.com/gallery/  edit: most of the official art is on this site too
Malazan,2ht9pw,PromisedPrince694,1 point,Tue Sep 30 12:53:34 2014 UTC,"I'd like to add that sometimes skin and hair colour get messed up in fan art too. Fan art is generally interesting for this series, but some of it looks way different from how I picture the characters."
Malazan,2hsugu,Murse_Jon,10,Mon Sep 29 16:45:20 2014 UTC,Erikson has stated multiple times that The Black Company helped inspire him and ICE in the creation of this world.
Malazan,2hsugu,Bilbato,4,Mon Sep 29 17:03:40 2014 UTC,"This. It's in the foreword to book 4, isn't it?"
Malazan,2hsugu,Foliagus,3,Mon Sep 29 17:19:08 2014 UTC,"Something like that, or in one of the interviews he has given. I think I've seen him state that in a few different places, so i don't really know off the top of my head."
Malazan,2hsugu,Bilbato,4,Mon Sep 29 17:25:40 2014 UTC,And book 1. Basically every time I've ever seen him talk about his influences The Black Company is the first thing he mentions.
Malazan,2hsugu,ElmoTheNefarious,7,Mon Sep 29 21:59:56 2014 UTC,Reaper's Gale is dedicated to Glen Cook.
Malazan,2hsugu,theloman,5,Mon Sep 29 19:51:16 2014 UTC,The last 4 books to Black Company got weird and kinda 'meh'. MBotF goes full speed all the way to the end.
Malazan,2hsugu,Rummy9,5,Mon Sep 29 21:36:09 2014 UTC,"Also, as it is your first time reading this series, I would recommend with finishing the main 10 book series by Erikson. At which point, then go on to the side novels. As the main 10 books are the meat of this world. The rest are just filler and help to flesh out the rest of the world."
Malazan,2hsugu,Bilbato,5,Mon Sep 29 18:27:01 2014 UTC,"This. I would read the main 10 books, then go back and read the side stories. I think it's just much better that way. On a reread I'm going to do the chronological order though, just for a change.  Glad you like it! Remember, the glossary in the back of the book and the Dramatis personae are your friends. If you have any questions or comments please post them, we love living vicariously through first timers and we'll keep it spoiler free.   It only gets gloriously better."
Malazan,2hsugu,TriscuitCracker,1 point,Mon Sep 29 18:33:45 2014 UTC,"I would recommend the opposite of this.  Read all the novels in publishing order.  i see people give the advice of OP a lot, but, I for one, am glad I didn't listen to them.  To each their own, I guess, but for the record, Erikson recommends publishing order, which is why I read it that way my first time."
Malazan,2hsugu,turnpikenorth,3,Mon Sep 29 21:46:34 2014 UTC,"You realize that reading the main 10 books in order, and then moving on to the ICE books is effectively the publishing order? And for the main plot that is Malazan Book of the Fallen, the ICE books add next to nothing, and just means that a new reader will be more confused about whos doing what, and where, and why are they reading about all this other stuff that doesn't add to the main story and will just make them more confused in an already highly confusing series."
Malazan,2hsugu,Bilbato,2,Mon Sep 29 22:05:33 2014 UTC,"Oh, I thought the old side bar order was publishing order.  That was the order I read it in."
Malazan,2hsugu,turnpikenorth,2,Mon Sep 29 22:10:56 2014 UTC,"The old sidebar was the Chronological reading order from what I can recall, which is not the published order."
Malazan,2hsugu,Bilbato,2,Mon Sep 29 22:15:53 2014 UTC,Then that is the order I recommend.
Malazan,2hsugu,turnpikenorth,1 point,Mon Sep 29 22:19:39 2014 UTC,"Maybe if a person is on their reread of the series I can understand interjecting the ICE books with the main series. But for a first time reader of the series, I would say thats a bad idea. Go read the ICE books once you finish the main 10. But first time, no. The main 10 are complex and confusing enough that you don't need to add the ICE books which do not add anything to what happens in the 10 books of Malazan Book of the Fallen."
Malazan,2hsugu,Bilbato,1 point,Mon Sep 29 22:22:33 2014 UTC,"That's a common enough opinion, I'm just saying for my first time reading the series that was the order I read it in, and I am glad I did."
Malazan,2hsugu,turnpikenorth,1 point,Mon Sep 29 22:29:08 2014 UTC,I read the books in Chronological order up until RG then I finished the main series then Stonewielder and B&B after TCG.  I think that ordering is fine.  The series is not THAT confusing.
Malazan,2hsugu,theorybird,1 point,Tue Sep 30 06:22:51 2014 UTC,"Chronological order is effectively publishing order, between GotM and tTH anyway, after that there's way too much overlap between all of the ICE books and DoD/tCG with the timelines. The old sidebar order was pretty much publishing if you didn't take into account FoD and there is some interlinking between the Erikson and ICE books if you read them in that order for that reason."
Malazan,2hsugu,MoranthMunitions,2,Mon Sep 29 22:53:26 2014 UTC,"The recommendation may be obvious to most, but it wasn't to me.  I will definitely check it out, thanks!"
Malazan,2hsugu,DrinkyDrank,2,Mon Sep 29 17:39:54 2014 UTC,Am I the only one that couldn't get through the Black Company books? I couldn't even get a third of the way into the first one. The style just threw me too much.
Malazan,2hsugu,Amondrask,2,Mon Sep 29 20:00:10 2014 UTC,"Your not alone. I acknowledge they are obviously  good books, personally I just can't get into it. I've tried several times."
Malazan,2hsugu,TriscuitCracker,3,Mon Sep 29 21:29:46 2014 UTC,The series gets better and better! It is similar to Black Company and is better in my opinion. Also the Korbal Boach and Bauchelain novellas are not necessary but the ICE novels are certainly more pertinent to the world. He deals with a lot of characters like the Crimson Guard who Eriksson barely touches on. There is a good reading order online to slip in some ICE books to go well with the timeline. If memory serves you'd read the first ICE book after Midnight Tides.
Malazan,2hsugu,SerBronnofBlackwater,2,Mon Sep 29 17:11:31 2014 UTC,"I will look that up, thanks. That kind of sucks about the crimson guard not getting much screen time, the Prince seems like a badass!"
Malazan,2hsugu,SerBronnofBlackwater,3,Mon Sep 29 17:34:26 2014 UTC,Well they don't get any screen time in Erikson but they are in ICE a lot.

Malazan,2hsfy5,Cibfx,4,Mon Sep 29 14:18:06 2014 UTC,"Well, if you want those feelings of disorientation back, then I guess you can look forward to RotCG and SW. Honestly I really didn't like them. You can see interview after interview with Erikson or ICE talking about those books and how ICE isn't trying to be Erikson and you shouldn't go in expecting it to read like Erikson, but holy shit I swear those books are just trying really really hard to emulate Erikson and generally failing. They have tons and tons and tons of plotlines, but many of them feel so forced and don't bring anything to the table beyond 'well this is like Erikson right?'. Or he'll go really far out of his way to make things more ambiguous and confusing by not telling you who the characters are in a scene and just having them be 'unknown figures' or some such because 'hey this is confusing like Erikson right?'  If its any consolation I'm in the minority I believe, most people enjoy RotCG and SW a lot more. At least NoK was it's own style, and didn't overstay its welcome at its like 300 page count. And as you pointed out, there is Temper, pretty much the only good original character ICE wrote. The Y'Ghatan section, while small, is just really good writing on ICE's part that I've never seen him do since."
Malazan,2hsfy5,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Mon Sep 29 14:32:38 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, nice to hear 'the other view' on Malazan's disorientating world."
Malazan,2hsfy5,SageOfTheWise,1 point,Mon Sep 29 16:01:15 2014 UTC,"I've been reading through Orb Scepter Throne for a bit now, and I think it's his best one. Primarily because he's working almost entirely with established Erikson characters so you're more invested as a reader."
Malazan,2hsfy5,SerBronnofBlackwater,1 point,Mon Sep 29 16:15:11 2014 UTC,"I disagree. ICE is a little more fast pace in terms of action and such but is no means worse. He's got a different style which I can appreciate. I love his characters too like Kyle or the Crimson Guard (Shimmer, Iron Bars, Blues, ect.). Only ICE novel I remember not being too much a fan of was B&B."
Malazan,2hsfy5,SageOfTheWise,2,Mon Sep 29 17:18:58 2014 UTC,"See Kyle would probably be my quintessential example of terrible ICE character writing. He doesn't do anything in RotCG at all, and he's the closest thing to that book's main character. Things just happen and he happens to be there to observe them. He actually became a 'better' character in SW when he was turned into a side character with no PoVs (actually I think he had one at the beginning but that was it).  I mean Iron Bars is decent, but when I think of what was cool about Iron Bars it's pretty much all from Erikson's books. His Segulah encounter in RotCG was good, but that's about it. The rest I pretty much can't remember anything about character wise, just what there roles in the plot were. That's pretty much the issue with most of ICE's writing to me, almost none of the characters are memorable to me as characters, it's just like 'oh he was the one that did this' and stuff."
Malazan,2hsfy5,SerBronnofBlackwater,1 point,Mon Sep 29 17:27:01 2014 UTC,That's fair. I mean I loved Iron Bars in Stonewielder when he was champion of the wall. I like his writing and the way he handles characters but that's just me.
Malazan,2hsfy5,Aiolus,1 point,Mon Sep 29 17:41:09 2014 UTC,ICE did Iron Bars such a disservice.  He's Iron Bars! He can punch through foreheads. Erikson instilled such epic mystique about Iron Bars for me.
Malazan,2hsfy5,TriscuitCracker,3,Fri Oct 3 01:50:36 2014 UTC,"He's not as good as Erickson, but he's perfectly fine. I read it simply for the backstory of other characters, and all the interesting Malazan folklore. I love connecting the dots between characters and books. My favorite ones so far is RoTG and OST. Haven't read Assail but looking forward to finally getting to see what's going on over there."
Malazan,2hsfy5,erotic_hercules,1 point,Mon Sep 29 18:31:22 2014 UTC,"Completely agree, so much hate here for his works! They are cool stories that add the the overall feel of the world and give insights as to whats going on around the world, mostly at the same time in the timeline as major events covered in Ericksons! I just finished up Assail and there is quite a bit about ships and voyages, I honestly could picture what was going on and you could feel the stress in certain situations it was good, you should read it up!! (plus you get to hear kyles real name! :P)"

If you go to the official forums, there is a lot of arguing about whether ICE is worth reading or not.   I would say definitely read them as they flesh out the world wonderfully, take you to new places and progress certain characters. If you go into them expecting them to be SE v 2.0 you will be disappointed. There is no doubt that SE is a better writer than ICE but you will miss out on some great characters and stories by missing them (wait til you meet Manask and Ipshank in SW!)   As for Kiska, I agree with you. She is a whiny annoying cow and I wanted her to die so badly. Having said that,  she is worse in NoK than any of the other times you see her (I didn't hate her nearly as much in OST but then like I said I didn't like that book nearly as much anyway...)  NoK is not his best work but it is a great little story that doesn't take long to read (and is a nice breath of fresh air if you read it after MT, which is kind of where you should read it...)"

ICE is canon and as such has to be read or surmised if you love Malazan stuff. Plus supporting him is fine, he helped create the world in game form."
Malazan,2hsfy5,TisteSimeon,1 point,Fri Oct 3 01:56:12 2014 UTC,Yeah I liked BaB. It was an oppressive and surreal setting and he wrote it very well.
Malazan,2hsfy5,skatelight,1 point,Fri Oct 3 09:11:32 2014 UTC,"A little late to the party, but I just finished it today.   I wanted to like Kiska, but couldn't. At first it seemed like she had potential but by the end of it she was just a poorly written brat. It seemed to me that the only purpose she served was as a way to introduce Tayschrenn's involvement in the story and connect some of of he dots for readers who hadn't already figured it out on their own. Both of which could have been done without her.   I do have a question about her though. How old is she supposed to be? I figured mid to late teens, but her behavior suggests younger.   All in all, I thought it was okay. I liked the pace, and I liked Temper. Didn't like Kiska or the way ICE wrote Shadowthrone. I'll still read the rest of ICE's books."
Malazan,2hsfy5,Aiolus,1 point,Thu Oct 2 23:11:00 2014 UTC,I'd say she is between 15-20 no younger no older.

Malazan,2hsfy5,skatelight,1 point,Fri Oct 3 09:10:21 2014 UTC,"That's true. His mannerisms and the way he spoke just seemed different, which is understandable given the difference between Erikson and ICE's writing styles. I think ascension would cause some changes in behavior, personality, etc."
Malazan,2hsfy5,Aiolus,1 point,Fri Oct 3 12:45:28 2014 UTC,"Temper! The only good character ICE has ever written.  Its quite a slog! Wait till BaB good lord. Admittedly I just bought Assail and haven't read it yet, so scared it will be terrible.  NoK is my favorite book from ICE and then I guess RotCG, so baffled that he could take an epic group like TCG and make it meh.   The books are canon and thus worth reading but don't go in expecting really good books or you will be disappoint.  I have heard mixed reviews on Assail so don't have too much hope but I have some. He has to get better eventually!"
Malazan,2hsfy5,wastedcleverusername,1 point,Fri Oct 3 01:48:37 2014 UTC,"NoK is really rough, ICE gets a lot better as a writer as he goes on. RotCG is a bit better but still has hiccups, I think it's around Stonewielder he gets a lot more readable."
