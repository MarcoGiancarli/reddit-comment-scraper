AsianBeauty,3e39ly,hooversmom,3,Tue Jul 21 16:57:38 2015 UTC,"The CosRX toner is actually correct for actives. The point of a low pH toner is to lower the skin's pH immediately after washing so you can skip wait times to naturally bring your skin's acidity level back to normal. This way when you apply your actives, they have the correct environment to do their magic and aren't hindered by a high pH barrier."
AsianBeauty,3e39ly,sewsewsewyourboat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:26:07 2015 UTC,"Oh awesome! Thanks for clearing that up, I was confused since there are difference opinions while I was lurking around. But now it all makes sense :D"
AsianBeauty,3e39ly,vip0802,2,Tue Jul 21 17:51:29 2015 UTC,"I also think a list would be really helpful.  The only 2 pH adjusting toners that I know of are the Mizon AHA & BHA Daily Clean Toner, which is hard to get because it's either sold out or way overpriced on eBay, and Cosrx AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner, which has mixed reviews."
AsianBeauty,3e39ly,Eletas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:57:14 2015 UTC,"I'd be glad to help with this! Everyone, pH test your toners haha"
AsianBeauty,3e39ly,dinosaursandunicorns,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:59:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree about the mixed review for Cosrx. And Mizon's toner seems so scarce these days.. I can't wait to see their new formulation! Hopefully it's worth the wait."

As a blogger I want to make sure that people I link to a site are going to be treated just like me (really well, ideally!) or else I'll feel really bad/look shady/all sorts of other badness.  Stories like these and my own recent CS exchange with Glow Recipe about a product are making me feel fuzzier toward them. Yay!"
AsianBeauty,3e2ydg,MarillaV,7,Tue Jul 21 18:53:54 2015 UTC,"So glad they fixed the issue and went above and beyond.  It is so rare these days.  I think you were the one who told me about the Whamisa foaming cleanser?  Anyway, I love it so much.  I also bought the body butter and shower gel set.  I love the body butter especially. Glow Recipe is definitely my Whamisa dealer. :)"
AsianBeauty,3e2ydg,MarillaV,3,Tue Jul 21 16:44:22 2015 UTC,"I love the cleanser, so it may very well have been me.  When I discovered it was the right pH I was ecstatic.  I'm so glad you love it.    I bought the body butter and shower gel too!  So good.  I may have also just purchased the body lotion they just started carrying (which they emailed to let me know about.)  It comes in a giant bottle.  I am all about giant bottles of things I love."
AsianBeauty,3e2ydg,MarillaV,2,Tue Jul 21 16:56:33 2015 UTC,"Yep, a creamy foamy cleanser at the right pH?  Come to mama!  Thanks for the tip. :)  Off to add the giant body lotion to my cart, along with the facial oil.  I ""need"" both of these."
AsianBeauty,3e2ydg,evil_doctorporkchop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:01:11 2015 UTC,"Obviously!  By the way, the facial oil is particularly lovely layered onto a face misted with a mist like the Whamisa one.  The oil seals in all that lovely hydration.  (I'm trying to level up in enabling.  How am I doing, lol?)"
AsianBeauty,3e2ydg,pdxbeautiful,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:34:21 2015 UTC,"Haha, you are an A+ enabler my friend!  But I am one step ahead of you on the mist, already have the rose one, lol.

AsianBeauty,3e2ydg,kuro_nya,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:51:58 2015 UTC,"That Tatcha mist... if it weren't painfully small AND agonizingly expensive, I would be all over it (this is actually my complaint about the Whamisa mist too.)  But I go through mists like tap water so I want a huge bottle and something cheap enough that I can buy it every month without crying.  Final tip: Tanaka massage with the Whamisa oil and mist is heaven."
AsianBeauty,3e2ydg,kuro_nya,5,Tue Jul 21 20:13:08 2015 UTC,"I feel you on the Glow Recipe love. They let me return something that I had used past their allotted return date after I explained that I had an allergic reaction to it. One of their cs reps kindly emailed me a return label without any hassle and went on to suggest other products I could exchange it for that would be compatible with my skin type.  I will gladly pay extra for excellent customer service and it also helps that they carry Whamisa, which I have been loving so far after trying out their toner, pH friendly cleanser, and lip balm."
AsianBeauty,3e2ydg,kuro_nya,3,Tue Jul 21 15:55:57 2015 UTC,"I hear you on the Whamisa love.  My skin loves it.  If you're into oils, the Whamisa facial oil is really nice and light.  Smells good and comes in a really thoughtful bottle."

AsianBeauty,3e2xx7,_endimion,4,Tue Jul 21 15:38:29 2015 UTC,Sounds pretty scary if Sidmool has to demand that they not sell it ><
AsianBeauty,3e2xx7,MeanHannah,8,Tue Jul 21 15:41:07 2015 UTC,"It's probably just Sidmool cracking down on unauthorized sellers.  Maybe they are ready to launch their own global site and test the international market beyond Japan, China, and Australia."

AsianBeauty,3e368s,LatescoErgoSum,2,Tue Jul 21 16:54:51 2015 UTC,"I got Scinic All in One Honey and CosRX BHA Blackhead from Jolse on Amazon. The honey AIO was selling for more than the snail AIO on Amazon from some time, so now it's down and I grabbed it.  But they also have Scinic AIO Snail which I have and love.  Jolse sells on Amazon too."
AsianBeauty,3e368s,Nekkosan,2,Tue Jul 21 17:10:02 2015 UTC,Skinfood is a fun inexpensive brand.
AsianBeauty,3e368s,Eastclare,3,Tue Jul 21 17:14:03 2015 UTC,"What I started with:  • some good sunscreens  • moisturizers (mizon snail recovery gel, suhada shizuku pack gel)  • aaaaaaall the sheet masks  • actives! start with some vitC (OST C20 is the forever popular here), maybe the cosrx bha blackhead power liquid (-:  I would recommend just staying a few days checking the sub, working your way through the sidebar, and checking skincare routines when they are posted, and looking through blogs! :3"
AsianBeauty,3e368s,maarowak,2,Tue Jul 21 17:14:54 2015 UTC,"Fun: Sheet masks! I am very fond of the Innisfree ones, but that's more because they fit my face really nicely than for anything else. The tea tree flavor is amazing on my (also oily and acne prone) skin when it's being crabby. Something with an ""out there"" ingredient you wanna try - snail, bee, starfish, whatever. I've heard great things about Benton's Snail Bee line, but haven't tried it myself yet. Next haul... :P Also, mists are freaking amazing if it's summer where you are. I've got one by the Face Shop (don't have access to my purse right now to double check the name) and it's lovely for keeping my face (and my temper) cool.  As far as fun makeup, scout around to find one of the threads that pop up about ""Post your bb cream shade!"" and control-f your MAC shade. Cushion foundations are my favorite thing EVER - I'm about a NW15/20 and Etude House's Precious Mineral Any Cushion in W13 is a pretty darn close match. Also, lip tints are pretty cheap and awesome - I've got some by Peripera in my cart for my next haul."
AsianBeauty,3e368s,flibberty-gibbit,3,Tue Jul 21 19:04:54 2015 UTC,"I would recommend Mizon Snail Recovery Gel Cream (it's less than 5 bucks plus free shipping on Mizon products on roseroseshop!), COSRx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid, COSRx Galactomyces White Power Essence or Missha First Treatment Essence, and Sum37 Miracle Rose Cleansing Stick.    For masks:  My Beauty Diary masks are inexpensive and fantastic; also Innisfree It's Real Squeeze masks are inexpensive and most formulations are pretty good (esp good:  Green tea, Rice, and tea tree), and It's Skin masks are nice too.  Avoid Missha sheet masks like the Plague.  I don't really have any makeup recommendations other than BB creams... (Skin79 is my bae).  Have fun and post a pic of your haul!!"

AsianBeauty,3e368s,honeybeehoney,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:21:26 2015 UTC,"It depends on your skin tone.  Green is the lightest (it's a #13) and least moisturizing, but still silky and smooth.  I'm using the Hot Pink now which is a #21 tone with a lot of pink undertone.  It is perfect for my uber pink fair skin, and it's nicely rich and moisturizing.  I usually flip back to the Green in the winter when my skin is more fair.  Try the Orange if you're fair with yellow undertones, and Bronze or Purple if you have a darker skin tone with yellow undertones.  VIP Gold is similar to the Hot Pink but with a more neutral undertone.  The Snail formula also has a slight yellow/beige undertone but has a lovely texture.  I've not sampled any of the other formulas.  I would recommend finding a mixture of samples from a seller on ebay to try out the different formulas.  I gave up foundation forever when I met Skin79!"

AsianBeauty,3e2e44,soups49L,3,Tue Jul 21 13:03:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this! I like your picks: all good brands and products that we don't hear much about on here. I was definitely interested in both the Mamonde Rose and Jasmine Sleeping Masks, but after reading your mini-review, I went to check the ingredients again only to realize neither will work for me. I'm pretty bummed as the jar look oh so pretty and I really want to try something from Mamonde.  I'm fascinated by stick essence. I had no idea it was even a thing. In fact, I want all of my skincare products to be available in stick form like the MRCS. It would make traveling that much easier when you use a hundred products. I'm glad you were able to make it work for you. And I give my cosmetics I whiff all the time especially when they smell as good as Guerlain Meteorites do.  The packaging for the TCFS Jean Georges Llong both intrigues and repels me."

AsianBeauty,3e2e44,cyraenica,3,Tue Jul 21 16:58:50 2015 UTC,"I really like the Miss Flower & Mr Honey essence stick. I've been getting dry, flakey skin in my T-zone this summer and I ordered it with the intention of using it as a final occlusive during the day (after reading /u/Sharkus_Reincarnus mini review of it).   It's been working wonderfully - and I can keep it in my purse to slap on during the day if I start to see any flakes develop. It sinks in to my skin right away - I really think this is a product for dry skin, because I'm not getting any of the sticky-ness you're experiencing."
AsianBeauty,3e2e44,Sharkus_Reincarnus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:37:03 2015 UTC,I'm curious! How do you apply the essence stick? It's such an unusual product that I always want to know how other people use it.
AsianBeauty,3e2e44,Chihana,3,Tue Jul 21 19:23:31 2015 UTC,Thank you for this. I'm very interested in the stick maybe for an under eye sleeping treatment?  Can you use the sunscreen on your chest or arms or hands or something?
AsianBeauty,3e2e44,Chihana,2,Tue Jul 21 13:48:58 2015 UTC,I'm using up the sunscreen on my legs. It's a lot less conspicuous there. Haha.

AsianBeauty,3e2e44,canuckinexile,2,Tue Jul 21 14:19:01 2015 UTC,"Wow, love these mini reviews.  I was interested in the Mamonde and Banila for the same reasons.  Sounds like the sleeping pack is a win :)"

It smells so good.  I also use it at home when I am very dry between my moisturizer and sleeping pack for extra oomph.  I don't remember who, but someone on here said to use it as a highlighter under a bb cream and you definitely can.  So it is definitely useful and pretty.  I have been thinking about that Mamonde pack, it sounds right up my alley.  Anything with roses and honey is going to be my jam.  I can wear it at night with my Rose Barbare perfume and be completely saturated in roses and honey!  It sounds sinful..."

But really, I wanted to give you a gold star for figuring out how to actually order the fucking samples. I tried, repeatedly, and it just would not work for me. So I gave up, because the frustration of the ordering process coupled with the other stuff you mention made me ragequit the site."
AsianBeauty,3e37sy,LatescoErgoSum,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:49:05 2015 UTC,"I... I think I've done it correctly. I just poked at the samples I wanted like choosing things at the end of a check-out. Looking at my cart, the only dollar amount I see is the $25 for the sampler bag. O_o Hope that's right."
AsianBeauty,3e37sy,ellumina,3,Tue Jul 21 16:53:42 2015 UTC,"Yup that's right! And if you can, use mobile Ebates (8% back) or regular Ebates (4% back). It gives you the % back on your order before the discount, aka $125, so it'd give you $10 back on mobile.   EDIT: JK I think it's 4% on mobile today too. It was giving 8% yesterday ><"
AsianBeauty,3e37sy,MarillaV,5,Tue Jul 21 16:55:13 2015 UTC,"Or you can just order 5 of the Dr Jart masks and call it a day like I did.  Haha.  I love Dr Jart, so I am fairly hopeful regarding these masks.  I am toying around with perhaps ordering another bag with some Ren or Ole Henriksen, it is a good deal.    For those of you struggling to make this deal work, you have to use the desktop mode or use an actual desktop computer.  It won't work using the app or the mobile site.  Have fun!"
AsianBeauty,3e37sy,MarillaV,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:06:00 2015 UTC,"I think I've seen Ole Henrikson's stuff mentioned here before, hence it finding its way into my cart. I might've had a sample of something else in the line previously and been turned off by the smell, but if it works, I'll deal."
AsianBeauty,3e37sy,MarillaV,3,Tue Jul 21 17:08:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that Truth Serum has a pretty devoted following.  I have used it before and it does work, it just doesn't give me that L-AA level of brightness.  But it is definitely way less finicky than L-AA and easier to use.  I was thinking for traveling it would be nice to have the Truth Serum instead of wrangling my L-AA serum, which is frankly a pain."
AsianBeauty,3e37sy,sakana-no-ko,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:12:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah... I'll probably scrape up the money to buy this. >.> I really would like to introduce something reliably brightening into my routine.  Edit: Also, I think I'm jonesing for receiving packages of pretties in the mail... (ihaveaproblem)"
AsianBeauty,3e37sy,MarillaV,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:28:06 2015 UTC,It is definitely brightening and much easier to use and doesn't oxidize as quickly as L-AA. I love getting Sephora packages especially since you get free samples with each order and I almost always find some Beauty Insider rewards I want.
AsianBeauty,3e37sy,ellumina,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:49:12 2015 UTC,Does the Truth Serum need a wait time like L-AA does? I'm so done with a 40 minute morning routine all because of Vitamin C
AsianBeauty,3e37sy,MarillaV,2,Tue Jul 21 18:47:22 2015 UTC,"I am pretty sure no wait time, since it uses SAP if I remember correctly.  No wait time is a huge bonus, but I am committed to the brightening power of L-AA!"
AsianBeauty,3e37sy,evatronn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:55:43 2015 UTC,Would it be ok to use the Truth Serum in the mornings and an L-AA at night? I never do Vit C in the morning because I've got no time for that! A Vit C in the morning with no wait time sounds like a dream.
AsianBeauty,3e37sy,MarillaV,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:08:41 2015 UTC,Hmmm...I think you hit a saturation point with Vit C pretty easily.  Maybe you could do Truth Serum one morning and L-AA the next night?
AsianBeauty,3e37sy,evatronn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:21:08 2015 UTC,"Are you me? I did this after spending way too much time figuring out the price per oz/ml per product and if each item could best the Dr. Jart mask price. (Sadly, they did not. Only the Ren and Ole Henrikson came close at $19 and $18)"

AsianBeauty,3e37sy,onelifetolive1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:47:32 2015 UTC,"I thought $25 was high for the very small size of some of these samples. Especially with a serum or such, one use isn't going to tell you anything about how it works for you. I've received samples with my 100 pt gift of a lot of these anyways and wasn't impressed."
AsianBeauty,3e37sy,endlesslazysunday,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:12:27 2015 UTC,"I looked at the full-size prices of the things I was interested in, and I just cannot get behind spending that much money for things I can get cheaper for the same size or larger with AB stuff. Can't do it. As much as I want to buy interesting new things and try them, I can't drop that much money."

My Beauty Diary Black Pearl, the classic hydrating, plumping, brightening wonder.  9. My Beauty Diary Imperial Bird's Nest, just like Black Pearl but with more intensive brightening and moisture.  8. Etude House I Need You, Vita Complex! Brightens amazingly well and leaves my skin looking translucent in the morning.  7. Tony Moly Pureness 100 Sheet Mask, Placenta. Love the super-clingy fit and comfort of the thin cotton mask sheet and the nice firming results.  6. The Face Shop Real Nature Mask, Kelp. I adore all things seaweed (almost) and this one makes my face feel fabulous.  5. Tosowoong Pure Propolis Mask Pack. Wonderfully brightening and firming.  4. Tosowoong Pure Deep Sea Water Mask Pack. Like the propolis, but even more hydrating!  3. Freeset Donkey Milk Aqua Gel Mask Pack. Oh my Lord, this makes my face like juicy porcelain or something.  2. Banila Co. Miss Flower & Mr. Honey Hydrogel Mask. This one is like covering my face in a sheet of fragrant honey heaven.  1. Whamisa Organic Flowers & Aloe Vera Fermented Hydrogel Mask Sheet. There pretty much are no words to describe this mask. It smells amazing and when I take it off, I'm literally like ""WTF is that really my skin?"""

AsianBeauty,3e0suy,Sharkus_Reincarnus,5,Tue Jul 21 03:17:38 2015 UTC,It was my first Memebox order too (and I nearly lost the plot when I saw they were based in San Francisco).  The mask I tried last night was the Whitening mask. I could not believe how well my skin looked this morning. And with all the love for the Aqua mask in this thread I can't wait to try that one too!

AsianBeauty,3e0suy,Sharkus_Reincarnus,3,Tue Jul 21 10:17:49 2015 UTC,"As usual, great review! That ingredient list looks phenomenal. I may or may not have just run to the Internet like a crazed addict and purchased a set of the healing kind.  You've been horrible for my wallet this month, just so you know! Can't wait for theTosowoong post, i've been using their stuff for a few months now and there are some real winners in that line. The enzyme wash is probably one of my favorite things.  I'm sorry about the UTI, there's no discomfort quite like it. About two years ago I would get them chronically, horrible feeling. I hope it resolves itself soon."
AsianBeauty,3e0suy,Tin_cup_chalice,2,Tue Jul 21 10:33:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks <3 I'll be all right after tonight. I have awesome insurance, so I did a 10pm call to a nurse and have a prescription ready to go first thing in the morning.

AsianBeauty,3e0suy,xcdo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:36:57 2015 UTC,"Definitely not the Tony Moly because are Sephora prices. Let's see...(I may or may not be taking this as an excuse to browse through their mask section and see if anything catches my eye):   Leaders coconut gels (Brightening, Balancing, Moisturizing, Lifting, the ones with fruits or veggies too; there's a 10-piece value set for $25) Freeset donkey milk of course! Botanic Farm (the hydrogels are kind of wonky, they're dry and stiff, but the results are really nice) SNP (love the Bird's Nest, though they are kind of perfumey!) Give the TCFS Aroma Garden set a pass. It's absolutely beautiful but the sheet masks are very bleh. Give the Skin Factory ampoule masks a pass, the mask sheets are godawful, papery and won't cling They have the Banila Co. Miss Flower & Mr. Honey hydrogels in stock! Buy buy buy Their price on the Benton masks is decent!"

AsianBeauty,3e0suy,SINGLEBROKEFEMALE,3,Tue Jul 21 03:38:41 2015 UTC,"Ooooo okay now I want to give them a shot. I always see them when I go get sheet masks, but I never bothered cos MBD Imperial Bird's Nest gives me life. I have been eyeing the My Scheming snail masks though."
AsianBeauty,3e0suy,redpandapanda,5,Tue Jul 21 04:39:53 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I loved MBD but I've converted to silk masks. I just love the fit and feel! But yeah if you're looking for moisture, MBD Imperial Bird's Nest is uh-mazing... The snail one's nice! Kinda slimey as to be expected though."
AsianBeauty,3e0suy,SINGLEBROKEFEMALE,3,Tue Jul 21 05:15:54 2015 UTC,"I love love love looooove the My Scheming snail masks. SO much essence and so thin that it looks like I am wearing nothing! It brightens up so well and the next day, my face just looks so bright and happy."
AsianBeauty,3e0suy,izzvlogs,2,Tue Jul 21 06:50:05 2015 UTC,"It's weird because for me, I liked the regular bird's nest more. I got a nice touch-feel to my face.

I use masks a lot and sometimes don't always pay attention to what they are doing for me."

AsianBeauty,3e0suy,redpandapanda,2,Tue Jul 21 18:22:06 2015 UTC,I'm going to try those next.  Question:  are the masks you My Scheming masks bigger than the MBD masks? The MBD masks only cover like half of my forehead lol.

AsianBeauty,3e0suy,SINGLEBROKEFEMALE,2,Tue Jul 21 14:46:56 2015 UTC,Snail eyes! <3
AsianBeauty,3e0suy,beautyforbrekkie,21,Tue Jul 21 15:35:58 2015 UTC,"What annoys me is that they list the price for some masks in a box (My Beauty Diary at $12 ), but list the price for a single mask for others (Sephora Mask at $6, but this is just for 1 mask =_=).   I don't think I can say I really love 10 masks, but these are my top 5 masks that I ALWAYS have at least a box of around.  1.My Beauty Diary Black Pearl [New 2015 edition; the only thing I didn't like about the old masks were the chin cut, but the new version takes that away and implements a super thin cotton sheet that is more saturated than before. My skin is combo with some sensitive spots, and it loves this mask.]  2.Leaders Insolution Brightening/Mela-tox [This has an amazing fit and the serum feels like a cooling gel. Brightening powers are better than the My Beauty Diary, but it is not as moisturizing as MBD].  3.Innisfree Skin Solutions Total Care [Ingredients list is great. Niacinamide is #4 on the list! Very soaked mask that gives your skin a nice glow. I usually use this in the mornings if I decide to do two masks in a day. Also when Innisfree has their Buy 10 get 10 deal, it is the best mask for the price. I find their Skin Solutions to be much better than their real squeeze masks. I also love the fact that they use unbleached cotton masks...something about it seems so pure]  4.Innisfree Skin Solutions Trouble Care [Another skin solution mask with a great ingredients list. Main ingredient here is propolis, which is great healing skin damage and calming down acne spots. While the concentration is not too high, this mask is also a favorite of both my siblings who have super sensitive skin. The mask smells like sweet honey too. This is also something I love about Innisfree masks....their scents rarely ever smell artificial].  5.Leaders Insolution Aquaringer [Same great fit as the melatox, but this one is THE ultimate mask if you are looking for hydration. I swear this mask can plump up any dry face. The reason why I didn't put this up higher is because most mask hydrate well, and the other options were less expensive. The melatox, obviously, an exception haha]  This list is obviously biased and my personal opinion, so take my claims with a grain of salt haha. Also, no hydro-gels, because I honestly much prefer regular sheet masks."

Pretty standard, pretty effective, good for the price.   And then once in a while I'd splurge on a skii mask. Super expensive, the fit sucks, and the thickness of the mask is blech, but also dripping with that fermenty goodness, and still probably the most effective mask I've tried thus far.

But for me, if the fit is terrible or there isn't enough essence to stay on my face, that's a fail. I am also sensitive to fragrance and high alcohol in a mask which just make some automatic 'no's'.

AsianBeauty,3e0suy,girlpeeg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:23:04 2015 UTC,"Hnnnghhh... so many things to add to my list of things to try... >_<  Random sheet mask-related question while all you lovelies are talking about them: Does anyone else have issues with the essence on a mask sort of... dribbling down toward the neck area? It kind of drives me crazy when it happens to me. I've only been using the TonyMoly I'm Real! masks that I got off Amazon to try a variety to see what works, but it seems to be a pretty common thing. Any ideas?"
AsianBeauty,3e0suy,johnnyfever27,2,Tue Jul 21 14:54:30 2015 UTC,I think that's normal with cotton/silk masks.  I just don't wear any shirts I mind getting essence on when I'm masking.  If a sheet mask doesn't drip a little then it probably isn't saturated enough to do much for your skin in the first place.    If it really bothers you try hydrogel masks.
AsianBeauty,3e0suy,girlpeeg,2,Tue Jul 21 15:20:22 2015 UTC,"Really, it's just a minor irritation at this point. It's not like it's saturating my shirt or anything. Just a little ""why the hell is there stuff dripping down my chin?"". I usually just kind of rub the essence into my skin where it's fallen and call it good."

What I've found with many sheet masks is that if you refrigerate them, the essence thickens up enough that it's less drippy. Usually. I have a few that are so watery this doesn't help, but for most of them it does, even MBDs."
AsianBeauty,3e0suy,CatsandPotatoes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:38:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, I definitely have this problem if the sheet mask is loaded with essence. I either kind of wipe it off with my finger and put it where the mask has dried a bit(usually the upper lip part) or put a tissue-bib on. :p"

AsianBeauty,3e0suy,Gdansk19,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:11:02 2015 UTC,I'm really hoping the $100 masks were ones that came in a pack of ten! There's no way I could spend $100 on a single mask. Well.. Unless it got rid of my dark spots and solved all of life's problems.
AsianBeauty,3e0suy,dsqq,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:46:23 2015 UTC,"I love pretty much any mask with a creamy/milky essence. Mamonde Flower Essential in Rose is pretty great, one of the only masks I've rebought so far. I just tried the Etude House I Need You, Green Tea mask and that was very nice. I like Innisfree masks.   I love sheet masks and I think using them consistently helps my skin, but I've never used any mask that totally wowed me with the immediate effect it had on my skin. And I say this having used some masks that people rave about, like MBD Black Pearl and the Whamisa hydrogels. Yes, some essences smell better, or feel nicer on the skin, but I've never noticed my face be anything other than well moisturized and smooth after even the nicest masks. I've tried some cheap masks that weren't great, and I could tell the difference between those and better quality ones, but still... nothing has made me look at my face after and go ""whoa!"". Am I missing something?"
AsianBeauty,3e0suy,MiddleearthFirefly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:25:38 2015 UTC,"I'm totally new to this but think a lot of it has to do with what works for your skin vs another. (I've been doing a lot of reading in the last few months...thank heavens for bloggers like Cat Cactus and Auntie Snail among others!) For some people the Benton Snail Bee Content Mask is their saving grace but for me it's not my HG. I go back to it for sure and I'll always keep some in my stash but it wasn't the WOW factor for me.  Of course like I said...I'm really to new to this and still figuring out my routine! (And summer had to come along and change the game when I thought I was getting close. Le sigh). I also like the Innisfree Berry Hydro Gel, and Missha Real Essential Multi-Vita for making my face brighter and evening out skin tone.  In summer I have to scale back moisturizing or else my skin gets super oily so I am taking note of a lot of these masks people are taking about and figuring out where I can slot them in my routine. The one that is my absolute LOVE so far is by Mask House, the Herbal Brightening Mask. Oh dear lord did that make my skin happy, bright and just filled with good things.  Did one last night and my skin still feels plump, brightened, moisturized, and evened out in skin tone, reduced some breakouts that were starting etc without sending my skin into oiltown.  Unfortunately hard for me to get my grubby hands on here in Canada without crazy shipping expenses."

AsianBeauty,3dzyjg,MakeupAsker,3,Tue Jul 21 02:16:37 2015 UTC,"Sending positive thoughts your way! It can be so easy to put off getting stuff like that checked out since it seems so benign at first.  A couple of years ago my mom had a small patch of what she thought was dry skin on her neck beneath her jaw line, about the size of a dime. Sometimes it would look at little rough and flaky, other times a little red. She just kept putting lotions and hydrocortisone cream on it. Her GP sent her to a specialist who diagnosed her with basal cell carcinoma. She had to have the lesion excised and a chemical treatment on her face as she had abnormal findings there too.  This diagnosis convinced my dad to go to the doctor and get a couple of questionable spots looked at that he had been ignoring. He was diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma too.   I'm thankful that both of my parents were diagnosed with this, which sounds odd, but my dad is very stubborn and refuses to go to the doctor to get things checked out. But since he knew he already had issues w/ basal cell, he agreed to get a weird mole checked out that just popped up one day. Turns out, it was melanoma. And well, we all know what happens if melanoma is left unchecked.   I'm sorry, I know this post is already long, but I just want to THANK THIS SUB sooooo much. After reading so many of your reviews/comments, I was able to find a couple of SPF 50+ Asian sunscreens that my mom, sister, and I can use everyday that are wonderful and non-greasy. My father still uses western sunscreen, but I'll convert him eventually!  So thanks for being so awesome and helpful, guys! :)"

I'm sure everything will work out, I just wouldn't have put off seeing a professional so long if I had any inkling it was anything significant."

Thank goodness you found out now, and soon it'll hopefully be a distant memory. I know those biopsies are never fun.    I definitely second going to the derm, at least once a year for a full body skin check.    So many people do not. So many people insist on tanning and/or not wearing even a minimal SPF. I don't get it. I watched my mother die from melanoma and still people tell me I'm being extreme about sunscreen and general skin safety. Like they know it's something that can happen but somehow think they are immune? Ugh. If only everyone were as diligent as the members of this sub, a lot of late stage skin cancers would be prevented."

While everyone is being paranoid, but don't forget spf on your lips as well guys, especially if you are prone to getting moles.

AsianBeauty,3e1tx3,nosehaaaair,12,Tue Jul 21 08:36:59 2015 UTC,Are you sure they are hairs? When my SF's were really bad it definitely looked like I had hairs on my nose but some quality time with BHA soaked in a cotton pad sitting on my nose revealed them to be just gnarly SF's.
AsianBeauty,3e1tx3,kuro_nya,4,Tue Jul 21 11:57:07 2015 UTC,Wow I didn't know it was okay to do this
AsianBeauty,3e1tx3,_endimion,4,Tue Jul 21 13:22:53 2015 UTC,how long did you leave the cotton on your nose?
AsianBeauty,3e1tx3,Sushisando,6,Tue Jul 21 15:04:11 2015 UTC,"hmmm, about 5-7 minutes?  I use cotton pads like this pull them apart in half, soak in BHA (currently using COSrx Black Power liquid) and just let it sit on my nose.  My SF's are worse on the sides of my nose and they grow long filament like ""hairs"" along the tip.  However a few days of this treatment causes them to vanish.    In fact when I started doing this they were really really bad, like to the point that my boyfriend called me out on having a hairy nose.  I hadn't gotten a strong BHA yet so I used my Benton Aloe BHA toner in this way 2x a day for almost a week since it was such a weak concentration of BHA and it eradicated 80% of all the SF's and definitely got rid of the ""hairs"".  Since that first treatment and with the addition of COSrx I haven't gotten any hairs, just smaller SF's on the sides of my nostrils that respond very well to the soaked cotton pad trick."
AsianBeauty,3e1tx3,kuro_nya,3,Tue Jul 21 15:42:56 2015 UTC,"thank you for the detailed response, i am going to try this tonight. my SFs are taking over; i even did the reduce pore size routine from 50 shades. maybe i will try this first and then do the routine again."
AsianBeauty,3e1tx3,Sushisando,6,Tue Jul 21 15:45:38 2015 UTC,50 shades has an associated skin care routine? Wtf. Is there a cookbook too haha
AsianBeauty,3e1tx3,sakana-no-ko,6,Tue Jul 21 15:50:27 2015 UTC,"ahhaha, 50 shades of snail. i should have been more specific. :) but for real - i saw a 50 shades of gray bracelet that was a small set of hand cuffs."
AsianBeauty,3e1tx3,Sushisando,4,Tue Jul 21 15:57:02 2015 UTC,lmao oops I'm so embarrassed. I even read that blog and I still misinterpreted :)
AsianBeauty,3e1tx3,sakana-no-ko,3,Tue Jul 21 16:17:22 2015 UTC,"No problem! Let me know how this works for you, I'm really curious!"
AsianBeauty,3e1tx3,kuro_nya,2,Tue Jul 21 16:00:53 2015 UTC,"trying it tonight, will report back"
AsianBeauty,3e1tx3,Sushisando,8,Tue Jul 21 16:06:58 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean. I have ""hairs"" coming out as well. It's not really hair of course, but especially after applying mineral powder it look pretty darn like it!! For me a 'here and now' fix is oil massage. I cleanse/massage my face with 100% argan oil (the same I use for my hair) 2-3 times a week. I'm sure you can find lot of AB oil cleansers that does the trick as well. I also use a BHA exfoliant every day. If you are really dying to get some deep cleaning done try this method. I haven't done it yet as I'm still waiting for my clay mask. But not so long ago there was a post about it here and it seems to help a lot of people.  NEVER use porestrips. They may fix your problem for a day but they only make it worse in the long run!"
AsianBeauty,3e1tx3,DanishLikeThePastry,4,Tue Jul 21 12:32:11 2015 UTC,You are supposed to have hairs in your hair follicle.  It's the follicle sticking out that bothers most people. You can have stringy white stuff comming out of it tha can be squeezed out - that is the follicle. A hair wont come out and is meant to be there.  BHA helps the most and for some oil cleansing.
AsianBeauty,3e1tx3,Nekkosan,2,Tue Jul 21 14:32:26 2015 UTC,Using acids and oil cleansing has helped a lot of people with bad sfs!!

AsianBeauty,3e1vgq,tanoshiiki,4,Tue Jul 21 08:59:06 2015 UTC,"Just test them when you're there. Honestly, all peeling gels are functionally the same. So long as it balls up properly on your skin (some will and won't depending on how oily you are) then it's good."
AsianBeauty,3e1vgq,Renoe,3,Tue Jul 21 10:41:03 2015 UTC,"I have all three, plus a green tea peeling from Santa Marche (awesome) and a honey peeling from Stream and Country (very nice!), and of course the famous Cure dupe - Pure peeling gel. Honestly, after using all of them, there is just no point to spend extra for Cure. If anything, go with ettusais peeling milk. But the bottle is small, so  it actually works out as pretty expensive if you compare it by volume. (I go through a lot of peeling gels, because I use them as body exfoliators as well)."
AsianBeauty,3e1vgq,2catsinjapan,2,Tue Jul 21 11:35:08 2015 UTC,"Hmm, now that you mention it, on a per unit basis the Ettusais would actually be more expensive!  IIRC, Cure is usually never on discount Y2700/250g = 10.8 yen per gram.  Not sure if Ettusais is sold below list price, but at list price Y1404/125ml = 11.232 yen per ml. I have a feeling Ettusais is sold below list price, but it only becomes cheaper than Cure when it's Y1349 or less per bottle.   Just to throw in the DetClear, at list price Y1296/180ml = 7.2 yen per ml -->  cheapest!  All prices include tax.  If I was just comparing prices, I have Daiso Water Pack Jelly that I got for 105 yen for 50g (2.1yen/g, so it's extremely cheap). I haven't used this one yet, but have heard this one doesn't really work and I want something that works."
AsianBeauty,3e1vgq,vickary,2,Tue Jul 21 12:24:44 2015 UTC,I haven't tried any of the others so I can't compare but I use the DetClear Mixed Berry version. I usually use it in my once-a-week 1000 product facial/spa evening and it does what I expect it to do and smells pretty nice.
AsianBeauty,3e1vgq,aopanda,2,Tue Jul 21 10:12:26 2015 UTC,"The best thing about that DetClear at the moment is that it comes in cute MyMelody packaging, haha! ^_^"
AsianBeauty,3e1vgq,strychninesweet,2,Tue Jul 21 10:29:12 2015 UTC,"Go to Don Quijote and test the gels out on your arm. They have a huge selection and always testers (the only one I haven't found there is the Cure gel actually haha)  I use the Santa Marchè green tea peeling (¥1200). It does its job and smells decent, but takes a while to ball up properly (maybe because my skin isn't oily)"
AsianBeauty,3e1vgq,imhereforfruits,2,Tue Jul 21 12:44:43 2015 UTC,"I have DetClear and it's alright. Like /u/musicalhouses said, it's nice as a basic, very gentle physical exfoliation, but I didn't notice any amazing, glorious effects from using it. It's one of those things I remember to use from time to time, not something that has a solid place in my routine. It's nice and solid for the price, but I wouldn't repurchase it simply because I personally don't need it.   Hope this helps!"
AsianBeauty,3e1vgq,musicalhouses,2,Tue Jul 21 13:43:58 2015 UTC,"I have the Detclear one and I believe that they're all the same and that they're not that interesting products. If I have a lot of flakes on my skin, it will help with my makeup application and things like that so on some instances I was happy to use it but most of the times I find it useless and kind of regret buying it. It's nice because it's really gentle and won't irritate your skin, but it won't have any magical effects on your skin or your acne. Just get the cheapest if you really want to try it :)"
AsianBeauty,3e27rs,MollyFi,7,Tue Jul 21 11:45:12 2015 UTC,Sulwhasoo Overnight Vitalizing Mask seems very rich and creamy to me.
AsianBeauty,3e27rs,epipin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:44:27 2015 UTC,seconding! i've got extremely dry skin and the sulwhasoo one is the best sleeping pack I've found so far. I used to use it as a regular cream when my skin was really freaking out.
AsianBeauty,3e27rs,pokeiman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:51:34 2015 UTC,"The SulWhasoo Concentrated Ginseng Cream is really thick. It is the thickest most moisturizing thing I have. It's not a sleeping pack though. I bought the 30 sample packs on Amazon.   I like Dr. Jart's Ceramidin Cream , but not buy it's self.  Ceramides might be something you'd like.   I notice Holika has a Cera line and makes a Cera Ultra Sleeping Mask , although the Cera Ultra Super Cream promises 72 hours of moisture but be better.    http://www.holikaholika.com.my/holika-holika-skin-good-cera-ultra-sleeping-mask/"

Sulwhasoo's ginseng oil is a great product to layer under a sleeping pack when your face is really dry. Layering an oil under moisturizer and a sleeping pack got my face through a horrible winter.  SU:M 37 make a very nice and very comparable sleeping pack."
AsianBeauty,3e27rs,bbyah,2,Tue Jul 21 13:21:15 2015 UTC,"Ladykin Dark Vanpir repair cream is one of the thickest, most buttery creams I have. It's not exactly a sleeping pack, but sometimes I use it as one. Might be worth a try!"

Seriously.   I'm on accutane right now and my skin is super dry and dehydrated and I wake up with super comfortable smooth skin. I used Aquaphor all over my face as well and it was very nice but much more uncomfortable. I also like the feeling of the cold ponds cream, very soothing.   I've also cut out the foaming cleanser part in my routine and this has helped a lot. I use a makeup remover and the oil cleanse and my skin feels so clean but much more moisturized. I recommend trying this if you haven't already."

It always left residue on my oily skin that I had to wash off in the morning, which not even all the sleeping packs I've tried actually did.  The Ladykin Dark Vanpir Cream is also kind of a winner for that, which is at least partially because there's a ton of coconut oil in it."

I've also tried Sulwhasoo Overnight Vitalizing Mask and Tony Moly Appletox Honey Cream and they aren't that moisturizing but superb for brightening. I was using the Tony Moly cream under the Mizon S-Venom. Other creams that are quite moisturizing but not as much as the venom are Sulwhasoo Essential Firming Cream, Etude House Collagen Moistfull Cream, Etude House Super Collagen Moistfull Cream, Etude House Collagen Moistfull Sleeping Pack."

AsianBeauty,3e376w,girlpeeg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:50:07 2015 UTC,"I have the same/similar skin type to you! What do you have in your routine right now, and what's your biggest concern that you'd like to address first?   The Snail Recovery Gel Cream was actually my first AB product, and I really like it a lot.  It's not super miraculous, but it is basically dirt cheap and it's a really good light layer of moisturizer/occlusive.  I use it exclusively during the day as my moisturizer since it's hot where I am right now and it's very light, and I use it as my last layer before my sleeping pack at night.  It's been good enough to me (in terms of helping keep my skin nice and non-problematic, as well as helping with recovery times for breakouts) that I bought a backup when I was about halfway done with my first tube.    Another Mizon product that I really love is their Good Night White Sleeping Pack, which focuses on brightening and moisturizing.  I also have the Innisfree White Tone Up Sleeping Pack, but I find the Mizon one to be slightly lighter/thinner since it's more of a light cream texture compared to Innisfree's gel-like texture.  I've been using it on the summer nights that have been particularly hot (I don't have AC) and I don't need the excessive hydration I get from the Innisfree.  A plus is that the brightening agents in the sleeping pack should help a little with acne scarring!"

AsianBeauty,3dzrzq,xcdo,3,Mon Jul 20 21:18:06 2015 UTC,"Really interesting! I bought my first cushion a month and a half ago  and feel like I'm already beating it to death trying to get the makeup out. The top of the sponge seems almost dry, but if I move it around I can see there's still a bunch of makeup underneath. Did flipping it help? I'm worried it'll just make a mess!"
AsianBeauty,3dzrzq,BikramCat,5,Mon Jul 20 22:33:01 2015 UTC,"If you flip it over with a tweezer, it's a little cleaner than using your fingers! Usually the BB cream distributes to around the edges, so you may also have to ""scoop"" some to put in the center on the top!   I had to flip mine after about a month, so I would definitely try!"
AsianBeauty,3dzrzq,Chihana,2,Mon Jul 20 22:52:23 2015 UTC,Flipping works great for me. It's almost like a new cushion.
AsianBeauty,3dzrzq,Pickypii,2,Mon Jul 20 22:47:21 2015 UTC,I also store mine upside down. I like to imagine it helps :D
AsianBeauty,3dzrzq,ababay1,2,Tue Jul 21 06:41:44 2015 UTC,That's actually ingenious and probably does /something/. I'll try that once this new one has been used up a bit!
AsianBeauty,3dzrzq,ababay1,3,Tue Jul 21 18:28:48 2015 UTC,"I find that the 'top layer' that makes it look so different and moist is usually just excess product sitting on top of the sponge and after one or two uses it goes away, leaving my sponge looking the same as your three month old version despite there being product left."
AsianBeauty,3dzrzq,casual-fribsday,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:16:16 2015 UTC,"It does look a little bit the same (I agree with the excess product on the top), but I don't need to push as far with the newer one vs the older one - I was really holding it down to get the product at the bottom when I was using up the last of my three-month one!"

AsianBeauty,3e26sh,RoseTyler00,3,Tue Jul 21 11:33:02 2015 UTC,My Beauty Diary is a good entry level mask (I feel like they should come with a warning that the first one is free) and they have a wide range of 'flavours' in order to find at least one that works for your skin type and what you want to accomplish.  Black Pearl and Imperial Birds Nest tend to be the two that work for the vast majority of skin types.

If you want to try a bunch of different masks a subscription to something Mask Maven or Mask Genie might be nice [Shipping can be a bit expensive, but it is free / reasonable if you're in the US].  The frequency you use masks depends on your time schedule and skin needs. I only do a sheet mask once a week, it is just a time consuming process for me. I do eye patches more frequently though, which is something you might be interested in."
AsianBeauty,3e23px,pooka4eva,3,Tue Jul 21 10:52:12 2015 UTC,"I would get Mamonde sheet masks. A bit luxury, packed with essence (don't dry out for upwards of an hour), and very relaxing to wear. They have a nice fit and material.  Also I'd go for a soothing one instead of hydrating because not everyone wants hydration."

AsianBeauty,3e23px,Sirah81,2,Tue Jul 21 13:57:38 2015 UTC,"Well, the sky's the LIMIT! MBD was my first sheet mask brand and I think it's such a solid choice to intro to new maskers. A box will do you right for a big group of girls - probably get the sampler pack with 10 diff ""flavors"" so it's more fun that way. Innisfree are also pretty good to intro to new maskers."
AsianBeauty,3e23px,Sirah81,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:52:35 2015 UTC,"I was going to (reluctantly) dive into my personal stash and bring out some MBDs and Innisfrees.    Is it crazy that I only want to buy new ones for this trip, though?  Like all that time you spend curating your collection (using up the ones you don't like, but you don't necessarily want to make them use THOSE, right?  and saving all the ones that you love....)  I did just pop into the mask shop in KTown and picked up a stash of Mamonde masks, as per /u/aopanda's suggestion.  Maybe I should have added some more Innisfree...."
AsianBeauty,3e23px,isabel_in_nyc,2,Tue Jul 21 17:04:34 2015 UTC,"I say, give your friends some good options (by adding in some Innisfree) and you can keep the ones that they dont end up using. Is that win/win? (I just walked by the Mask Bar today too!) I shoulda just met up with ya to personal shop LOL. I know what you mean, I use the crappier/cheap masks first as an ""everyday"" mask for basic hydration and treat myself to a more expensive mask on the weekend or when I particularly feel bad. I wouldn't want my friends trying the ""bottom of the stash"" masks because I'd want them to actually feel good effects. Mamonde seems like an excellent choice and starter mask to give to your buds!"

Aloe, snail, pearl, green tea etc are good."
AsianBeauty,3e2emp,ghangiskhan,2,Tue Jul 21 12:55:53 2015 UTC,"If the shade is just a tad too light you could mix a little bit of your darker foundation in the cushion. The innisfree long wear cushion #23 has perfect undertone for me but it makes my face a bit dull so I throw 2-3 pumps of Skin79 Orange in and voila, perfect match :)"
AsianBeauty,3e2emp,weebat09,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:30:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I was really hoping there were cushions made in slightly darker shades.    I have a Bobbi Brown foundation I've used with my Missha cushion, but I think it's a little heavy for mixing with the lightweight Etude House :/.   But thank you!! I'll take a look at this Skin79 for mixing :) Thanks!"
AsianBeauty,3e2emp,weebat09,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:35:23 2015 UTC,"Oh I don't think Skin79 makes a shade that dark.   I have neither Etude House Cushion nor the Laneige Cushion but I believe this review might be helpful for you.      There are only three shades available and I have W24 Honey Beige which is the darkest shade. Interestingly, W24(Etude House) is lighter than #21(Laneige) so Laneige wins in terms of shade range."

AsianBeauty,3e36sy,slothsleep,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:33:13 2015 UTC,"It also helps any blemishes heal faster, brightens and softens really well. I first used it last winter and it softened my wind-and-cold-roughened skin right up! I didn't figure I needed it as much in the summer but now got a propolis mist anyway and it made my skin noticeably softer again."
AsianBeauty,3e36p0,ilchdk8,7,Tue Jul 21 16:37:23 2015 UTC,"The white goopy patches sounds like your skin was clumping the snail cream (since you weren't cleansing it off) over the few days you used it, and the sweating from the run + humidity just brought it all together in large clumps of pilled product. If you want to avoid your cleanser, maybe you could take a soft wash cloth (like one made for babies or a micro fiber cloth) and use that on your face in the shower."

AsianBeauty,3e2e24,Asyrol,4,Tue Jul 21 12:50:16 2015 UTC,I think you'd be better off seeing a dermatologist as they'd probably be more qualified to give recommendations for a skincare routine - most of my friends have gone to the National Skin Center. I've heard horror stories about facial salons - this story is a good example.
AsianBeauty,3e2e24,little_green_men,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:47:41 2015 UTC,"What you need is a dermatologist and not an aesthetician.   I recommend Dr Phay Ken Lin (Specialist Skin Clinic). She's more conservative and cautious in her treatments which I like and she takes time to answer your questions. She also feels less commercial. They do have their own line of products but I've never tried them so I wouldn't know.  Your skin also needs time to acclimate itself to the hot and humid weather (with blasting indoor AC). When I was still living in Singapore, I washed my face at night with a gentle soap (Hada Labo, white bottle or just use the Simple Cleansing Gel) and then use a sheet mask (I wash off at the end) and that was it. Sometimes I use the Hada Labo lotion(toner) sparingly.   Another thing that would really help is to put all your skincare except the cleanser in the fridge.  *Edit to add: I never wear makeup in my everyday life in SG. It's too hot for that shit."
AsianBeauty,3e2e24,dsqq,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:04:11 2015 UTC,"You may want to post this to /r/singapore for them to give you recommendations! From my experience, aestheticians are not heavily regulated in Singapore; it isn't seen as a medical service. Also, do give your skin some time to adjust, but if it's really bad, then do go to see a dermatologist.

AsianBeauty,3e0chw,Eletas,8,Mon Jul 20 23:54:29 2015 UTC,"Have you ever wondered how King Kong takes such great care of his skin? Well, here’s the answer to that and part of the reason dermatologists hate him. One of Mizon’s lesser known lines, the King to the Kong line features a full on liquid cleanser, oil cleanser, toner, cream and a gel cream, all boasting enormous sizes which would only be fit for someone like King Kong.      The Moist King’s Berry Cream is no exception, with 160 mL of what I would only be able to describe as a ‘cottage cheese’ like product encased in a tin container. Besides its seductive packaging, this product is thick and even then, I would consider it an understatement to call it just that. Its creamy texture makes it hard to spread around, as you’ll see in the pictures, but from that, I can say that it’s very moisturizing and slightly brightening. This is moisturizing to the extent that I can only recommend it to those with drier skin types, as opposed to oilier skin types, such as myself. It reminds me of the Benton Steam Cream, to some degree, which I was not a huge fan of. It might be a tad bit hard to see, but there are some tiny beads in the cream which melt as soon as you rub them into your skin and are supposed to assist with the moisture. As for the scent, which I know some people take into consideration, it’s most definitely there and is more of an herbal nature.      Now, let’s talk ingredients. As the claims mention, it’s supposed to be good for whitening and anti-aging. Particular ingredients that stand out include olive oil, niacinamide, cetearyl alcohol and sodium hyaluronate. Simply from the ingredients list and from usage up to now, I mainly consider this to be a moisturizing cream, as opposed to one intended to deliver effects.      Overall, I would definitely recommend this product for those who need that extra pump of moisture in the form of a thicker cream, which does fully absorb rather quickly (~1 min). I’m a fan of the size and the moisture boost that it gives, but I just can’t get past the thickness, which pushes my skin off the edge and makes it that much oilier. I’ll have to designate it as part of my Sleeping Pack Team, along with my Sidmool Royal Honey Peptide Deep Moisture Pack, as it seems to be a better fit there.      Off-note: That comb was actually a sample from RRS, when I kindly asked them in the drop box to include some samples. Not my exact definition of samples, but I'll roll with it since I could use a new comb. I'm not a huge fan of pink, but my girlfriend loves this. She loves the fact that there is finally ""something useful"" which she can use to groom my hair, so maybe I'll have a new hairstyle soon haha.     Summary Table:       Product Price Volume Ingredients Claims Effects Repurchase?    Mizon King to the Kong No. 1 Moist Berry Cream $14.22 160 mL COSDNA Wrinkle-care; whitening; strong moisturizing power Highly moisturizing; slightly brightening Probably not, unless if my skin type changes drastically"

It's so odd how it's crammed full of such random heavy moisturizing stuff and really lacking in some of the better ingredients. I mean... you really hit the nail on the head with this one.  I guess if someone is looking for a heavy cream that will sink in, moisturize and... not... form an occlusive barrier(?!) this is for them?  Regardless! Thank you for the awesome review. I hope you do more. Your posts are fantastic."

AsianBeauty,3e1m4o,hooversmom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:31:51 2015 UTC,Last time I was in the downtown T&T (about 2 months ago) they definitely had all kinds of MBD and some other brands including My Scheming! I surprisingly had good self control and didn't buy any because my stash was very sizable but I'm coming back in a few weeks and I'll be sure to grab some then! So it's also possible that they have Lovemore now maybe. Fingers crossed!

AsianBeauty,3e0bd7,thiswilldonicely,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:46:06 2015 UTC,I assume that you like the toner since you're restocking it? Do you mind giving a mini review? I've been eyeing it lately.
AsianBeauty,3e0bd7,thiswilldonicely,2,Tue Jul 21 00:33:23 2015 UTC,"I like it, it does have alcohol in it but my skin can handle it. I use it for a pH adjuster and it does the job. It's unscented which is a big plus for me, kind of smells like witch hazel. I'm not sure about making pores look smaller, I don't really have large pores but it doesn't adversely affect my skin at all, basically it feels like wiping my face with water. I also use it after my actives wait time since my AHA makes me feel sticky."
AsianBeauty,3e0bd7,Lena_Meow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:10:15 2015 UTC,Awesome thanks. The description says something along the lines of sebum control and the main reason I'm interested in it is to help with sebaceous filaments. If you have/had those does it help at all?
AsianBeauty,3e0bd7,ivorydolphins,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:15:11 2015 UTC,Pbi I use it an it's pretty nice. I use it before my actives so I can't really say if it's shrinking pores or the actives are. Lately I use it even if I don't use actives just to adjust the ph of the skin. In this humidity this is helpful I think. It does have alcohol and if you're at all sensitive to it then don't use it.

AsianBeauty,3e26oi,aopanda,2,Tue Jul 21 13:47:53 2015 UTC,"For me even before I'd purchased any AB products I noticed a massive change in my skin just from getting out of the western mindset that one moisturizer should be all you need to keep your skin hydrated. I started paying attention to the AB concepts of layering several serums, essences, moisturizers etc, and choosing multiple products with ingredients designed to target your own specific skin concerns. My skincare routine got significantly longer.. but within a month my skin had stopped looking dull, and my previously dehydrated skin had some serious glow!"

Both of these products are in lipstick tubes but feel and apply like a balm :)"
AsianBeauty,3e146r,moxymoxy,7,Tue Jul 21 03:44:18 2015 UTC,"I guess you have to decide for yourself if it is. I didn't purge very much at all when I first started. However, I've never had much of an acne problem.   I credit active use with my newly tiny sfs. Also, I used to think I had normal skin and an oily t zone. But I clearly don't. Proper hydration and actives took care of that oily t.  So for me...risk was worth it. But like I said, you'll have to decide for yourself whether it's worth the breakout you might have to deal with. The thing with purging though, is it's temporary and for long term reward. My two cents"
AsianBeauty,3e146r,prettybeakers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:54:04 2015 UTC,Thanks for your comment! It's a little difficult to gauge how bad purging can be when it's more likely that those with very negative experiences will create posts seeking for help so it's good to know that it can also be a relatively painless transition.
AsianBeauty,3e146r,Kalika_22,3,Tue Jul 21 04:03:10 2015 UTC,"I did purge but I'd rather have that gunk out instead of in.  And of course I recovered, it was just some pimples."
AsianBeauty,3e146r,makemeover7,3,Tue Jul 21 14:33:05 2015 UTC,"I have never purged with ahas or bhas. It is really ymmv, and It can't hurt to test it on a cheek a few times ( or even a while) to see if you like the results before using it on your entire face. That doesn't guarantee you won't purge in another area, but if that testing spot starts to look fabulous then at least you know any purge will be worth it in the end. JMHO"
AsianBeauty,3e146r,ivorydolphins,2,Tue Jul 21 03:56:02 2015 UTC,"Oh good point about the spot testing to see if it's worth it! This may seem obvious but I've never really seriously spot tested something before (my skin is not very sensitive): should I spot test somewhere like my cheek, nose, or chin where I am most likely to breakout or somewhere more inconspicuous like my forehead (usually covered by bangs)."
AsianBeauty,3e146r,AgnieszkaXX,3,Tue Jul 21 04:09:08 2015 UTC,"Although I'm not on chemical exfoliants I am on accutane which has made me break out worse than I have in months. After keeping a strict face care regimen with mostly AB products and retinoids I had almost no acne. Some spots here and there but my dermatologist suggested accutane to ""finish it all off"" since I had horrible hormonal cystic acne at one point. I also scar super easily and have a lot of hyper pigmentation but it's not a big deal to me as that can always be treated. For me, I rather have this vs acne.  It's really up to you. You may not really purge hard, I know many people who only notice slight purging and most pigmentation can be probably be treated slowly over time. When I am done with my accutane I am excited to hope on the Cosrx BHA/AHA band wagon :)"
AsianBeauty,3e146r,vanityrex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:38:01 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reminder that purging effects/ hyper pigmentation is reversible. I think I just have this crazy thought in my mind that if I start purging it'll be like going through puberty/teenage acne all over again.   Good luck with kicking the acne. I hope we all have good success on the band wagon.
AsianBeauty,3e146r,vanityrex,3,Tue Jul 21 05:15:36 2015 UTC,"I think purging is something that can be really subjective to your own skin. When I subjected my face to the full 3 actives, there was no purging.  However when I used BHA on my body, my chest and back did have purging. You need to judge the likelihood of you possibly purging, and in the beginning, take it slow so as to let your skin acclimatize AND drag out purging.  If you are worried about SF's, you may have to do double duty on the sunscreen, and possibly invest in a sun visor or parasol. I use a normal baseball cap and silver lined umbrella and that's okay for me. You have to see what you are okay with, in terms of glow, cost and convenience."
AsianBeauty,3e146r,isaretha,2,Tue Jul 21 04:57:23 2015 UTC,Oh interesting about the SF's and needing to double up on the sun protection. I'm pretty new so I haven't heard about this before. Would you mind explaining the reasoning? Thanks for the tip!
AsianBeauty,3e146r,joutie,3,Tue Jul 21 05:18:24 2015 UTC,"I didn't really experience any purging with the first BHA I tried but I switched to a stronger one about a month ago and holy starfish I was not prepared for what happened. I had to duck into the bathroom every 2-3 hours when I was at work to reapply makeup so my face didn't look nasty. After three days, things calmed down a lot and wasn't nearly as bad."
AsianBeauty,3e146r,Aero5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:07:32 2015 UTC,Oh man sorry that happened to you. But now you've got me thinking that if I take the plunge I should start my actives on a Friday so if things go badly I can have the weekend to be a hermit while things hopefully calm down.
AsianBeauty,3e146r,joutie,3,Tue Jul 21 05:28:13 2015 UTC,"Or maybe start using the actives every 2-3 days instead of every day. I don't know if the purging started immediately... it may have been day 2 or 3 when it started getting really bad. Maybe start right before a long weekend? Also, I don't know if purging is something other people notice as much as you. I had a friend who went on accutane in college and had terribly purging for awhile. None of us even noticed until he pointed it out!"
AsianBeauty,3e146r,Aero5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:33:28 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried actives yet either, but I've often read that you should try using them only every 2-3 days at first!"
AsianBeauty,3e146r,lackingagency,2,Tue Jul 21 11:36:53 2015 UTC,"I'm having the exact same problem! I'm on the fence whether I should use an active to get rid of the CCs on some parts of my face. I'm extremely scared that the purging will cause my skin to freak out and I'll develop acne from there or something. Not very rational train of thought :(  Now I'm leaning towards just going for it though, because I'm probably just being irrational about it!"

As a first cleanser at night, the value is hard to beat. Even if for some reason your face doesn't agree with it, you're out almost nothing, and a friend will probably be able to use it. The green tea calming cleansing cream has nice ingredients.   And there might be better out there, but for just shy of $10, their Pure Moisture Gel (cosDNA) is quite a nice pick-me-up for tired, dull dehydrated skin. Those would be my two picks if I had a few bucks lying around and I wanted to try the brand out."

AsianBeauty,3e0gih,rosycat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:58:24 2015 UTC,It's somewhat sticky but I wouldn't describe it as thick although it's not super liquid. I feel it about as sticky as the Mizon snail gel. I don't do much wait time so I just continue my routine and my face dries after like 2mins. No lingering stickiness. Did you store it somewhere that isn't room temperature? Also check the manufacture date.  I could send you a PM tonight with some photos of mine to see how it compares to yours if you'd like.

PO Effector ampoule: Left a nice satiny finish, but I couldn't notice any lasting results.   365 Sherbet something-or-other spray sunscreen: AVOID. Sticky, refused to dry down, left me greasy and smelled cloyingly sweet. And the bottle lasted no time at all."

I'm planning on getting the light pink version of it when I run out of my current blusher.    The PO effector is also one of my favorite products for oily skin. It states it's for enlarged pores but I felt it did a pretty good job at minimizing oiliness overnight too.  I also got their strawberry cookie and cream hand cream, and it smelled pretty awesome. Will definitely add to my future haul when I run out of my current products."

AsianBeauty,3e0gih,AbominableSnowbunny,2,Tue Jul 21 05:22:27 2015 UTC,"After my postpartum breakouts, I was suffering dry/oily/irritated/acne all over my face and I needed something to sooth it quick.  My masks were irritating me at the time and I never had the multi step beauty routine before.  Knowing aloe could sooth my skin,  I got to try their aloe serum.  After loving how soothing it was I got the whole aloe line,  including the body/face mist.    I have a few backups but after I run out,  I probably won't rebuy them.  They are a step up my previous toner and moisturizer but I'd want to try others and compare first.  They are soothing though, great for the summer! The smell is relaxing to me.  Not very moisturizing,   so if you have dry skin you will probably need something more.   I have the: Aloe toner Aloe serum Aloe emulsion Aloe cream Aloe body and face mist  (contains alcohol so I use it only for my body)"
AsianBeauty,3e0gih,unluckyotter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:45:34 2015 UTC,I guess I should also add that they did help calmed down most of my irritations but it was the snail that completed the closed comdones.
AsianBeauty,3e0gih,unluckyotter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:47:40 2015 UTC,I have their powder mist and I wish I'd just gotten the Tonymoly Pocket Bunny Sleek.... The It's skin one is too drying and wants to smell refreshing but really errs to the side of sanitizer. It does mattify after the mist dries and patting my face makes it happen quicker but unless I feel really self-concious of my current oil condition I don't really reach for it that much.
AsianBeauty,3e0gih,Sirah81,-6,Tue Jul 21 16:12:01 2015 UTC,"Not impressed with this brand. The ONLY thing they have going for them is their Prestige Creme D'Escargot line or the Red Ginseng line where the ingredients list actually has a lot to offer and has minimal fillers/alcohol/preservatives. Their Power 10 Effectors in the little ampoules are cheap for a reason, because they don't really work. Granted I havent used these, but that's because no one's really raved about them. edit: comments below better convey my thoughts."

I posted a better explanation of why I had that bias that they ""must not work"" to the other commenter and I basically had a mixture of personal experiences as to why I thought that way but OP should definitely look at reviews from users with similar skin types to explore It's Skin (◠‿◠✿) Now that I did some extra research, the Black Label one looks pretty good ingredients wise!"
AsianBeauty,3e0gih,cecibeautytherapy,6,Tue Jul 21 14:45:04 2015 UTC,"Really now? I've read a ton of people using them in this sub. The VC, LI, and WH seem to be particularly popular. Just because you haven't tried them or read about them doesn't make them bad."
AsianBeauty,3e0gih,YAYkitties,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:28:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry I realize how my comment was not written in the best way to convey my exact thoughts. I have not seen raves about these on this sub because I don't go on reddit everyday but I was on another forum and someone had asked about the Power 10 line and no one really recommended it to the OP. That's just my own bias from that one experience because I wanted to learn more about the Power 10 line as well since yes, they ARE affordable and yes, they DO look promising to deliver! OP asked what's our experience with this brand, and the above and below was my experience.      I'd glance at the ingredients list if I haven't tried a product before and I remember seeing some acne triggers on cosDNA on the YE (the pH adjusters) so that was my personal preference to not have any acne triggers in a potential purchase. Although I did look at the Black Label just now and it has Sodium Hyaluronate as its second ingredient and Niacinamide as the fifth! That looks good! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧       Another bias I had was from reading this list made by a redditor here where the first few ingredients were basically NOT fillers. I had looked at this list a long time ago and I had chuckled at how It's Skin only had two products that didn't have fillers listed as the first couple of ingredients. And my bad, I thought the two products were Creme D'escargot and the Red Ginseng but one of the products was the ""Power 10 Formula Propolis"". (Hmm, why isn't the most popular snail line there?) So yes, I recalled some wrong information there - very sorry! (⊙﹏⊙✿)      So it's just my mixture of experiences of what I've seen so far that made me think ""oh, they must not work"". Of course, OP, I would look to the reviews from actual users with similar skin types as you to make the best judgement on what you should explore with It's Skin. (◠‿◠✿)"
AsianBeauty,3dxa63,kefz,23,Mon Jul 20 08:17:50 2015 UTC,I recently got into AB and have been really happy with the results so far. I wanted to share the magic with my closest friends so I made them a sampler pack! I was heavily inspired by /u/angry_cookie's introduction parcel and included /u/picoprince's skincare diagrams to help them navigate through how to use the products.  I bought most of the samples from RRS and filled the rest of the bag with misc. samples I've received from various orders. I put the full product list in the image description if you were curious. The samples I bought include: Too Cool For School Pumpkin Sleeping Pack TonyMoly My Little Pet: Wrinkle Line Patch Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence Etude House Blending Sleeping Cream (Rosehip) Benton High Content Mask My Beauty Diary (Mexican Cactus) Nature Republic California Aloe Sun Block

AsianBeauty,3e1yh7,-elen,4,Tue Jul 21 09:39:18 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend to stop everything except your sunscreen and cleansers. Try switching to only one of your Cetaphil or Bodyshop cleanser, insted of alternating. That way, if one of the cleansers if the culprit, you'll identify it. If you used one of the two before starting your routine, keep that one and ditch the other (for now).  Make sure you use the cleansing oil correctly: massage dry (<2min), massage wet (<2min) until it's all milky white, rince it all off until the water dripping off your face is so clean, you could drink it.  When your skin is back on its feet, re-introduce your products one at a time, for at least 1 week each (ideally, 2 weeks). If you really can't wait that long, try introducing the Wonder pore on one side of your face, and the Missha essence on the other side.  Personally, if I had to shove a culprit on the pyre right now, I'd point at the Wonder Pore. You skin sounds dehydrated and Wonder Pore is terrible for that."
AsianBeauty,3e1yh7,herezy,-1,Tue Jul 21 12:35:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your advice . I will follow it wisely ┗(＾∀＾)┛  Quick question , why do you thin the wonder pore would be the culprit? I actually thought it would most likely not be that because I only found Butylene Glycol which is mildly comedogenic. I thought it would be the rice cleansing oil because of the Isopropyl Myristate which is actually highly comedogenic. (?)  Also do you massage dry then pour some water on your face and massage again for the ocl?"
AsianBeauty,3e1yh7,herezy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:34:50 2015 UTC,"I'd suspect Wonder Pore because it's very harsh with the denatured alcohol, and it's made worst by the fact it's a leave-on product. Some people handle it very well and get great skin from it; others' skin freaks out, breaks out, goes into oil-production overdrive.  It could be the cleansing oil. I'd just think it's less likely because it doesn't stay on the skin very long, and cleansing oil are specifically made with emulsifiers in order to help rincing every traces off.  And yeah, massage dry first (no water on face nor fingers). Then, add a tiny bit of water and massage again. Make sure you whole face turns milky white. I personally like to wet my fingers instead of my face, but whatever you prefer. Just make sure to rince all of it off very well."
AsianBeauty,3e1yh7,herezy,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:16:43 2015 UTC,"Okay, that makes more sense. Do you have a particular cleansing oil that you would recommend?   Thanks for your advice :)"
AsianBeauty,3e1yh7,Tin_cup_chalice,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:35:04 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried a lot, and I don't really see much differences. I've tried the Innisfree apple juicy (which has a very strong chemical apple candy scent; you hate it or you love it), Etude House real art (the light one, I think), plain mineral oil (works ok but a real b*** to rince off), makeup remover (swipe it, but omg don't massage it in! The pimples....) Right now I use that Faceshop one because I got it for free (Hello Jolse!). It's ok.  I'd l ike to try Innisfree green tea next, because I use their green tea sleep pack and I love their very strong chemical green tea smell."
AsianBeauty,3e1yh7,aopanda,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:55:20 2015 UTC,"ok, thanks again! I'll go on with the Faceshop one until I find out if it actually helps."
AsianBeauty,3e1yh7,Tin_cup_chalice,2,Tue Jul 21 20:32:50 2015 UTC,"Hi there, I am not an expert by any means but I had some similar skin texture issues.  It sounds like it may be closed comedones, purging or maybe a slight allergic reaction. Which products are new to you?  It could be any number of sensitivities. For example, Cetaphil really freaked my skin out, even though it does beautifully for a lot of people, same thing with the Anthelios.  Conversely, I love the rice cleansing oil as it is the only thing that doesn't break me out...not so for other people. With all of this YMMV and you have to pay attention to how your skin reacts to each individual product.   If you could give a little more description as to your skin type, which products you have introduced, whether you have patch tested and also where the bumps are, it might be helpful in terms of giving advice."

AsianBeauty,3e1yh7,Lisendral,-1,Tue Jul 21 20:42:39 2015 UTC,"I have used the Cetaphil cleanser before it is definitely not that. I am not sure about the Anthelios but it's already gone now and I am looking for a new sunscreen at the moment.    As for the extra info , I am pretty sure my skin type is combination dry during the winter and combination oily during the summer. ( does that exists ?) Basically I always have blackheads even if my skin is dry/dehydrated. Some milia now and then but nothing more. I usually don't put a lot of stuff on my face and everything except for the cetaphil cleanser is fairly new. I did the mistake of introducing all the products at once and without patch testing so there you go kids! (━┳━ _ ━┳━) The bumps are concentrated around my cheeks just below the cheekbones and the only thing that had helped was the vanpir dark repair cream by Ladykin which I used to put before I went to sleep (when I would wake up they wouldn't be obvious neither to the feel or the eye). Unfortunately, I'm out :')  Hope that helps !"

I have tried the History of Whoo Whitening Seol Whitening Line.  I really liked it but it's VERY expensive - so I bought the travel size set on ebay or tester korea.  The only extensive reviews I could find on this line is from the blogger joseibi (w/ impressive before/after photos) - reviews are from 2011: http://www.joseibi.com/product-line-review-the-history-of-whoo-gongjinhyang-seol-with-before-after-pictures/  I really like from the Su:m 37 White Award Line:  Lotion & Luminous Treatment (fragrance is pleasant to me).  The same blogger Joseibi also reviews this line: http://www.joseibi.com/product-line-review-sum37-white-award/ The comments (many) are very helpful for both History of Whoo & Su:m37 Whitening Lines.  The blogger Joseibi has DRY skin.  I found a few reviews here and there, but I'm surprised there aren't more extensive reviews like Joseibi's.    Sulwhasoo Whitening line is mentioned in her blog but she found it to be not as effective (but YMMV).  I tried the Sulwhasoo Whitening Line but I found it less effective for me as well.

It's rather unpleasant. If your rub it in, it doesn't get an even coating. UV imaging shows huge gaps in application done any other way with spray-screens. I'm... I'm so sorry. :("
AsianBeauty,3dy8bs,MarillaV,3,Mon Jul 20 20:09:03 2015 UTC,Party pooper!!!

I'll try out the patting method today.
AsianBeauty,3dy8bs,MarillaV,2,Tue Jul 21 00:57:37 2015 UTC,Could we use a cushion (clean obvs) and pat it in that way?  Would that work?

AsianBeauty,3dy8bs,MarillaV,5,Mon Jul 20 16:31:12 2015 UTC,"Typically, spray on sunscreens need to be massaged into the skin after it's sprayed on to help even out application and let the product absorb. Sorry :(  Edit: autocorrect, damnit."

AsianBeauty,3dy8bs,lovechatting,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:03:51 2015 UTC,Most aerosol sunscreens don't require rubbing in actually. Just buy one that doesn't have it in the instructions. I've been using them for a few years and they've worked just fine (I'm borderline albino so I would know right away if it wasn't working). I've never found one that I've been willing to use on my face though. This product could be a miracle.

I currently sub to Mask Maven and did a 6 month sub. At first the bags SUCKED (if you're a little more advanced on the kbeauty curve). It was random, there was no theme, the masks were cheap and I would've have drooled over them if I saw them over at instagram. BUT 4 months on the subscription, I noticed they have improved on selection and put more unique masks in the recent July bag. I say that NOW would be a good time to sub to it since the first 3 bags were experimental and they improved on mask maven since customers gave feedback on what they thought about it. I personally will not continue after my 6 months is over because I have too many masks and need to ""shop my stash""."
AsianBeauty,3dzafy,cecibeautytherapy,4,Mon Jul 20 19:51:21 2015 UTC,"I used to get the monthly bag but, it stopped working out for me.

AsianBeauty,3dzafy,cecibeautytherapy,2,Mon Jul 20 19:34:01 2015 UTC,The bonus mask i got for committing to the 6 month subscription was shitty - a 3W Clinic mask worth literally 17 cents if I wanted to get it through RoseRoseShop (but of course I will NEVER willingly buy 3W Clinic masks voluntarily). I see these masks every month and roll my eyes. EDIT: Just want to mention that July's bag was the first month I didn't get these 3W Clinic or Baroness masks at all. I hope the improved Mask Maven stays that way.

AsianBeauty,3e0wqd,loomets,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:52:20 2015 UTC,You are correct.    BUT you also need to reapply if you sweat while using non-waterproof sunscreen. So some people might need to reapply sooner than later.

Usually if I'm outdoors outdoors, I skip any face makeup and only opt for eyeliner so I can reapply sunscreen.   Generally I think that if you're inside and not in direct sunlight, you should honestly be okay with not touching up throughout the day.   Someone reviewed a sunscreen mist today for reapplication, which sounds like a good option as well."

AsianBeauty,3e0wqd,cowjuice,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:13:18 2015 UTC,"I only wear BB Cream in the daytime, so I just slap more sunscreen on top. As long as I cleanse well at the end of the day, it hasn't caused any problems.

I have tried every remedy that people have recommended, and it was all for naught. What I am doing now is cleansing the area, swiping with Étude House Wonder Pore, then a Stridex red pad, wait 20 minutes, then a St. Ives pad (AHA), wait 20 minutes, and then my Belitae or DIY Vitamin C serum, and wait 20 mins. After that I put a bit of Tony Moly Snail gel in the big jar on, and I call it a day. I use the Vitamin C twice a day, and I do that AHA/BHA every other day (I'm trying to remember to do it). I also wear Sun Bears sunscreen or the Biore Perfect Milk on the scarred area. Both my husband and my best friend are astounded on how much my scars have faded just in the last 60 days.

AsianBeauty,3dz859,geekinheels,8,Tue Jul 21 02:09:27 2015 UTC,"I got two of these last week and promptly opened one to try it. These are just seaweed leaves cut into a mask shape and covered in some sort of essence. The Whamisa masks look like they're a hydrogel made from kelp, these are just straight-up kelp. And they smell like ocean- not the good kind of ocean, but like fish poop ocean. The essence was okay, but not worth sitting with slimy, fishy leaves on my face for 20 minutes. Worst mask experience ever, 1/10.  Edit: Seems like the Whamisa masks are also pure kelp, but of a much thinner variety. And probably not from swamp ocean. Also, I just remembered the nose portion wasn't cut evenly- one side was cut way longer, like the cutter slipped somehow.  Edit edit: OMG, these might be fish people masks. Did I unwittingly help an old one arise? I said some unintelligible words while I wore the mask, I can only hope it wasn't Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn"

They're pieces of sea kelp too, but each piece is supposedly carefully vetted to fit their standards of thickness, texture & consistency. (Here's an Instagram video from the Whamisa factory: https://instagram.com/p/3sMuNLA9xI/?taken-by=sarah_glow ) And I dunno if it's just me, but the 2 Whamisa sea kelp masks I've tried both smelled like kelp, but it wasn't unpleasant. It smelled like a refreshing version of Korean seaweed soup to me! Now I'm really interested in trying the TM version to see how they compare!"
AsianBeauty,3dz859,Sharkus_Reincarnus,3,Tue Jul 21 00:26:14 2015 UTC,"Ah, these are definitely not in the delicious, tasty, seaweed soup territory. The mask was as thick as the kombu I use to make dashi, but smelled like it had already been steeped with bonito fish."
AsianBeauty,3dz859,cata_tonic,2,Tue Jul 21 05:42:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks! The sea kelp pieces are definitely NOT THE SAME QUALITY. I guess 1/4 of the price = 1/4 of the quality. So curious to try the Whamisa now, I wish Glow Recipe has a store in NYC so I can just pop in and grab one! And yepp! I've seen that video too!"
AsianBeauty,3dz859,Sharkus_Reincarnus,4,Tue Jul 21 15:56:23 2015 UTC,"FWIW I used the Whamisa version last night and it, too, is just two sheets of kelp cut into mask shape."
AsianBeauty,3dz859,lovechatting,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:09:04 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay. Are the Whamisa masks thick though? Cause the TonyMoly are like beach nightmare seaweed. Like kombu vs wakame, where kombu is thick and tough, where wakame is thin and light. If that makes sense?"
AsianBeauty,3dz859,melodymodes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:06:48 2015 UTC,"I found the ones I used to be manageably thin, though in my experience consistency can be an issue with this kind of all-natural product, so I don't know if that's something to be expected of all of them :)"
AsianBeauty,3dz859,sheetmasker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:15:48 2015 UTC,You can tell from the close up of my masked face the the TM one is more rubbery and wrinkly compared to pictures I found on the Wham-bam. It's definitely not as thin (or of higher quality sea kelp?) than Whamisa's. This probably makes the Whamisa mold a little better to skin and get the essence to absorb better.
AsianBeauty,3dz859,lovechatting,4,Tue Jul 21 15:54:17 2015 UTC,"Yea, from other Whamisa photos, they look more hydrogel-like but still created the same tenting around the nose and they looked rigid still so I couldn't 100% be sure if they made a sheet mask blended with hydrogel-like properties? It looked nothing like the packaging. I TOTALLY AGREE That the smell was VERY turtle-y-sea-poop-monkeys type of smell which is why it's not a repurchase for me because I want my masking time to be ""spa-like"" and relax, not the ""suffer for beauty"" type of experience."
AsianBeauty,3e14yc,ivorydolphins,2,Tue Jul 21 03:51:13 2015 UTC,"May the spirit of the haul go with you!  I don't think they will interfere with Accutane, but maybe you should leave this up so users can chime in? I have not used Accutane before so..."
AsianBeauty,3e14yc,AgnieszkaXX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:46:15 2015 UTC,Thank you! I think you're right :) I'm excited to try them
AsianBeauty,3e14yc,annusjka,2,Tue Jul 21 13:02:40 2015 UTC,"I'm on accutane and I just started using Cosrx Galactomyces 95 White Power Essence. It stung slightly the first time I used it, but it was only that time. I have only used it for about a week, so I can't say if it's doing anything yet, but I'm going to keep using it."
AsianBeauty,3e14yc,cococolon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:03:35 2015 UTC,"Accutane buddies! Glad it's working for you, I thought it would be gentle enough since I don't have too much sensitivity right now. I wanted to use something to help my skin along during my course :)"
