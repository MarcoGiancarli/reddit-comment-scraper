teefies,3durye,mrrrrrrrow,6,Sun Jul 19 17:58:40 2015 UTC,Did you have to sedate?
teefies,3durye,the-cheat,7,Sun Jul 19 18:06:04 2015 UTC,"Yes. From what I understand, cats tend not to tolerate teeth cleaning. A brush, maybe, but if there's actually tartar buildup, they put them under anesthesia. He was very sneezy the day after."
teefies,3durye,the-cheat,2,Sun Jul 19 18:09:39 2015 UTC,Ok so then it sounds like this would only make sense if it's going to soon necessitate extraction
teefies,3durye,phome83,2,Sun Jul 19 18:16:21 2015 UTC,"Basically, yeah, but depends on what you mean by ""soon."" My cat was between stage 2 and stage 3 advancement (out of 4). I was advised that I could put it off a few months (which I did, to save up for the ~$500 procedure), but at stage 3 and 4, extraction is much more likely. At stage 1 and 2, it's much more likely to be reversible.  There's more info on types of dental disease, stages, and preventative measures here."
teefies,3durye,Azumia,3,Sun Jul 19 18:26:50 2015 UTC,"Whats the while procedure consist of?    Is it an overnight stay?  Do they need to ear special food afterward, in assuming there would be some discomfort eating normal dry food?    Also, minus brushing, whats the best way to avoid this problem?"
teefies,3durye,phome83,4,Sun Jul 19 22:55:52 2015 UTC,"My cat just had a dental cleaning back in April, so I can answer this!  Generally they do blood work beforehand to make sure your cat is healthy enough for anesthesia.   In my cat's case, I wasn't allowed to feed her after a certain time the night before (I believe it was 10 or 11pm), and then had to bring her in around 7am. They did a quick check-up to make sure there was nothing wrong with her.   They put her under anesthesia and started the cleaning and took some x-rays (something they can't do when they're awake). They called me about 40 minutes in to let me know that two of her teeth needed to be extracted due to tooth resorption. Sometimes that can be tricky, but in her case, both teeth were small so it was easy.   The actual procedure only took about an hour, and they were able to trim her nails super short and even brush her really well while she was still under. They kept her for a few hours while she recovered from the anesthesia. Because she had teeth pulled, I was given pain medication to give for a few days. In rare cases, they'll give antibiotics, but my vet told me she'd only ever had to do a few times.  I brought her back for a follow-up appointment a week later so they could make sure that the stitches looked okay, and that was pretty much it. She already eats wet food, but I had to break her treats up into little pieces for a week. If your cat eats dry food, you'll definitely need to switch him to wet food afterwards, at least temporarily.   As for avoiding the problem, dental treats are great. Some are better than others; My cat loves the Greenies dental treats. Also, one would assume that dry food is better for their teeth than wet food, but this is actually incorrect! My vet told me that dry food basically turns into sugar and sits on their teeth, which is not good.  Sorry for the novel, but I hope that this was helpful!"
teefies,3durye,Azumia,2,Mon Jul 20 03:15:51 2015 UTC,"No need to apologize.    A lengthy explanation was what i was looking for, thank you very much.  Also, if you also dont mind me asking, what was the price you paid for it all to be done?  The two extractions must have hiked the bill up a bit, but at least ill know a ballpark figure.  Thanks again for the info!"
teefies,3durye,kit_is_my_kat,2,Mon Jul 20 04:17:21 2015 UTC,"The original estimate was $530, but due to the extractions, it ended up being $800. My cat's left eye waters a bit (she was really sick as a kitten and her eyes were almost crusted shut when I adopted her), so they flushed her tear ducts while she was under anesthesia to see if a clogged tear duct was causing the problem, and that's included in that price as well. That was $60.   A long acting pain injection (Buprenorphine - can sometimes cause cats to be SUPER restless and not sleep, which happened with my cat) and a separate pain medication for me to give her at home was included in that $800. However, I paid another $30 for some Gabapentin because my cat ended up being super sensitive to the original pain medication (Onsior). Onsior is generally tolerated really well because it's made specifically for cats.  For some context (since prices differ everywhere), I live just outside of Portland, OR and my vet is one of the pricier ones in the area."
teefies,3durye,Palewisconsinite,4,Mon Jul 20 10:45:09 2015 UTC,"Yep, what /u/Azumia said, essentially. My cat didn't need extraction but he does have to take a course of antibiotics for gingivitis, which we give him orally through a syringe. I dropped him off in the morning and picked him up after work. Other than being a little disoriented and sneezy, he recovered just fine."
