A convicted murderer and an illegal immigrant wasn't deported after his 17 year sentence. He was released directly back into society. If he had been deported, 25-year-old Norwich resident Casey Chadwick would still be alive.

This, though federal law generally bans the IRS from sharing such data.   Confidential to whom? Under which cases is sharing this data not banned? Is this one of them?

It's not like if a child runs into his parents having sex, that it's suddenly traumatised for life. And they'll most likely see animals having sex at some point too, while humans are just animals, mammals too, there's no difference.  I would rather raise my children educated about sex and that they randomly witness people having sex several times while they're young, to grow up to be responsible about sex than not educating them & shielding them from it for them to be clueless and risk of teenage pregnancy & other shit because they weren't educated & weren't responsible about it. Anybody's kids will have sex at some point. I would rather have my kid grow up to have responsible sex on for example 15y of age than unreponsible and somewhat unknowing at 18y."

I don't care for the flag but have never wanted more to display one to combat the idiocy of this entire situation.  Mentally unstable man shoots up a black church in the name of race and all the sudden the flag is a symbol of hate.   Plenty of racists have guns. 99% don't go shoot up a black church or kill blacks in any other way.    You may not like the flag but if this is allowed its only a matter of time before someone tries to ban what you enjoy.   This is what our society has come to and we continue to allow it.    In my opinion, this culture of political correctness is directly responsible for event like this.  Everyone has to be nice and say positive things to people, every kid ( regardless of their abilities or lack there of ) gets a trophy and a prize, everyone has to be made to feel special.  And as soon as you don't it's unfair and the crying begins.   Kids are not made to strive for anything. They are given everything and excuses are made for their inabilities instead of being told to find something else you are good at. Then these people get depressed and are given meds that are known to cause suicidal thoughts and disconnects with other people. Then they grab a gun and go do this.  We are raising weaklings and are completely accepting to it.   I'm sure there are legitimate reasons to do away with this flag but this isn't one of them.

He flamed the tensions in Germany to rise to power and used it to cause great harm to many nations and many peoples, and the swastika symbolized that. The confederate flag came to symbolize the oppression, suppression and dehumanization of a few groups: mulattoes, blacks and native Americans. They wished to carry on their way of life, socio-ethnic class system, and sustain an agrarian economy based on cheap/free labor (aside from initial costs of purchasing a slave). This may be oversimplifying, but you get my point.

For ages I thought the south was a backward area of racism and stupidity until I visited and loved the bejesus out of the place & people. My point is that simple people focus on brand image because they are stupid (me).

Some that are racists and some that aren't.   The general attitude in all of these places is friendly and fun loving. It took me a long time to wake up to the fact that just because you fly a confederate flag, doesn't mean you harbor hate or ill will toward another group of people.    Also, unless you live in the south you may have never seen this, but we have plenty of black men in jacked up pickups flying the confederate flag.

And while you point out it's ranked ""highly developed"" in the HDI, you have to remember that is still relative.  It is ranked 71st out of 187, or just over 60% of the worlds countries.  There is a difference between ""relatively well off compared to a lot of awful places in the world"" and countries comparable to the US.  The US has 5x the GDP per Capita and is in the top 5 HDI.  It's rich, not just not-poor.  Mexico (and I would argue China) is the odd man out in that table.  I'd also take issue with Politfact's representation of stats.  Small sample sizes can be entirely misleading; if there is only one shooting, it is difficult to tell if casualty rate is low, average or high.   The real takeaway from the chart is that the US has over 100x the rate of mass shootings and (much) less than 100x the population.  It can be said that the US is the only place where it is a semi-regular occurrence (~9.5 per year; once every 5-6 weeks on average).  Basically, lumping everyone together who has a higher casualty count per capita only gives us data for 4 shootings while the US establishes a nice bell curve of 133 incidents.  If you look at the overall homicide rate to get a more smoothed out figure for lethal violence, the US's rate is 2-5x everyone else (except Mexico, which really doesn't belong)."

Why can't we expect the same with guns?  I am not saying start making a list of who owns guns.

For some reason we just can’t come out and talk about race or should I say color of skin. I understand what NAACP stands for but what I don’t understand is that you must be only black to represent people from the NAACP. I thought what we want is a colorless society so a person is seen not by their color of their skin but by their accomplishments and deeds? Does it really matter what he skin color appears? The bigger question sir, does Dolezal have any color or is she colorless maybe it’s that she doesn’t have enough color.

She lied she is gone but what does her skin color have to do with her Job? Please read what he wrote and tell me that is not racism. There is no reverse racism just racism. Let's drop the fake metaphors and get down to the real issue that we just can't seem to talk about. Racism is a two way street and we need to stop it from both directions. If only African American people can represent and work for the NAACP is to denigrate the work of all the other people who were not black who marched, worked and died in our fight for civil rights. There is some people of statue who have brought some clarity and sanity to the discussion but we need to point out and stamp out racism from all parties. Just because you are of African American decent you can't say that what ever they may say is not racism. Racism exists with both sides of the fence without stamping it out on both sides of the fence it will never end. A quid pro quo does not work in this arena. Mr. Carphart needs to call a spade a spade and walk the walk while talking the talk! If we let that slide bye then why try at all?

USNEWS,393ced,pal25,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:39:37 2015 UTC,"Teen births   ""The decline in teen birth rates in the United States has been well-documented. A comprehensive understanding of teen childbearing requires an understanding of the other two pregnancy outcomes, namely induced abortion and fetal loss. The data on teen pregnancy are not as current or complete as the data on teen births. Looking at national trends through 2009, teen pregnancy rates have also fallen, as reflected in declines for the two largest components, live birth and induced abortion (12). From 1991 to 2009, the pregnancy rate fell 44% (to 65.3 per 1,000 in 2009) and the birth rate dropped 39% (to 37.9). The birth rate has continued to fall through 2013. The teen abortion rate fell 56% in the 1991–2009 period to 16.3 per 1,000, but it has actually declined 63% since its peak in 1988 (43.5). Trends in teen birth rates have thus roughly paralleled the trends in teen pregnancy rates since the early 1990s (12)"""

Anyhow, on my two days in the canteen I noticed that the Red Cross was charging people for supplies - an example being $1 for a bottle of water (we were giving bottled water away for free), $3 for a blanket, etc. If that's not bad enough, the Red Cross didn't feed their volunteers without charge. Many of the Red Cross volunteers came to our canteens to eat - which we had no issue with at all, and nothing we ever did cost anyone a penny.

USNEWS,345m0t,CombustionJellyfish,2,Tue Apr 28 19:06:40 2015 UTC,"Your math approach is off.  If you just divide every age group by 2 to compute their household percentage you'll end up with a total population of 50%.  If you look at the Age of Householders (HH3), the 65+ segment is 23% of households.  The 55+ set, where dual retirement starts to trickle in, is 42%.  No matter how you slice it, the overwhelming majority of households not working is due to retirement.  So, if every household over 65 was able to retire, and they alone were the only households where no one worked, the rate would be even higher than what the article reports."
USNEWS,345m0t,upsidedownfunnel,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:41:41 2015 UTC,I honestly was not trying to insinuate that most of that 20% are retired. I was just trying to say that the statistic is misleading. I'd assume there are some under 65 that are retired and some over 65 still in the workforce. I also assume that the number of couples over 65 are even less. Overall I'm sure a significant number are legitimately unemployed. It's important to note that this isn't a new development either. The numbers have been similar for years.

A study by Cardiff University academics, funded by the BBC Trust, was published in August 2013, examining the BBC's coverage of a broad range of issues. The data showed that the Conservative Party received significantly more airtime than the Labour Party.

There is no senseless mass murder in the movie and the opening scene is Chris Kyle telling a Marine that mocked his killing of a woman and child that was coaxed into attacking other marines to ""Shut the fuck up"" with a disgusted and angry demeanor.

These pressure groups are trying their best to do the opposite and create chilling effects on speech that threatens the status quo or their narrative of it. They, not those who dare to present challenging (and even sometimes wrong) ideas, are unworthy of a place in academia.
