Repsneakers,3e1x8h,wutisthisthing,4,Tue Jul 21 13:12:50 2015 UTC,They look amazing but the suede around the toe will always bother me. When you look at the authentics they don't look all that different http://i.imgur.com/BUaHo69.jpg but reps look more square rounded than oval rounded to me
Repsneakers,3e1x8h,kkuroba,3,Tue Jul 21 14:37:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reviews, guys, I was really close to ordering these...  but does the swoosh look kind've weird to anyone else? (http://imgur.com/ra0J0Us.jpg)  Here's the retail for reference: http://cdn.solecollector.com/media/up/2014/02/images/nike-air-yeezy-2-red-october-era-05.jpg  And the old UAs seemed to have these down perfectly: http://imgur.com/o1i6dO4.jpg  The colors seem a little too dark to me too on these updated ones, but you guys are probably right in that it's just the lighting.  I ended up copping the older ones for 225 from a user on here - can't wait to see them in person :)"
Repsneakers,3e1x8h,SNSDsunny,2,Tue Jul 21 13:44:54 2015 UTC,It's the lighting. I took that pic in sunlight.  So it's the way the sun is hitting the swoosh/pyramids.  Look at this pic that I took in the shade http://i.imgur.com/rvBMlJi.jpg
Repsneakers,3e1x8h,yeezy2nyc,3,Tue Jul 21 13:52:43 2015 UTC,"For me the swoosh concerns aren't just the lighting though, here's another upclose comparison with similar lighting.  Updated UA RO: http://i.filmot.org/ra0J0Us.jpg Old UA RO: http://i.filmot.org/OyRG4a0.png  Maybe it just doesn't look as precise to me, I dunno, I'm kind of nitpicky"
Repsneakers,3e1x8h,SNSDsunny,4,Tue Jul 21 14:02:22 2015 UTC,I know what you mean. The swoosh is supposed to set in a little more into the triangles. They got this right on the old UA. Not sure if these are as set in as it is supposed to be.

Repsneakers,3e1x8h,TheGlueScent,2,Tue Jul 21 16:13:07 2015 UTC,I guess that's how it is when a lot of Italy's industry is fine goods that there are countless reps of.
Repsneakers,3e1x8h,CheckMyBrain11,2,Wed Jul 22 03:02:54 2015 UTC,France and Italy are probably the only EU countries that will sue you when you buy knockoff goods (especially if the goods have these countries' copyrights or if the brand originated from them.)

Repsneakers,3e2nk1,04andrew22,2,Tue Jul 21 14:15:15 2015 UTC,Notice how the outsole on the main picture doesn't match the rest of the pics. See how the outsole is so much of a brighter green than the main picture? Honestly these look exactly like the SMP's that I which are very nice but you would definitely be overpaying at $219.   Perfectkicks lost a lot of credibility with me when they said that these solars are UA (not to mention how they lie and say they have exclusive rights to certain UA shoes):  http://www.perfectkicks.net/index.php?main_page=popup_image_additional&pID=76699&pic=6&products_image_large_additional=images/Authentic+Air+Yeezy+2+Solar+Red+RESTOCK+100pairs_07.jpg  Look at those scales?

Repsneakers,3e19x5,Akuma201,-1,Tue Jul 21 07:38:26 2015 UTC,"eh, if you really wanna save money get the 4th. but overall, i'd recommend the 6th. fixes pretty much everything wrong with the 4th batch (low quality suede, fixed strap, sole color, higher quality zipper)  i don't think all 4th batch boosts rip on foot. i haven't heard a case of that happening in like 2 months. i think it was just people mistreating/struggling to actually put on the shoes being they're quite snug once you zip them up. nonetheless, i've never heard of a single 6th batch pair ripping on someone. both of them are honestly pretty flimsy around the toebox area where people reported them ripping.   i have a 4th batch pair (bc i ordered them the second david put them on the site. bc i was hyped) and honestly wish i would have just waited lol  the differences are overall pretty minuscule to most people though. so maybe i'm just over analyzing it.  if you were talking about the lows and i typed this out for no reason, i'd say just get the cheaper ones cuz the newer batch is still pretty fucked up."

Repsneakers,3e19x5,ReMixedNYC,0,Tue Jul 21 06:06:53 2015 UTC,"you can see geos floating around $300-$400 on sale, but they're consistently some of the worst colorways and/or in ridiculous sizes, eg the silver geos."

Repsneakers,3e0so5,imaqdodger,2,Tue Jul 21 02:06:07 2015 UTC,I believe any rep with boost technology is going to be comfortable.. maybe not on the level as real ones but more comfortable than other reps.
Repsneakers,3e0so5,Equilibris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:51:31 2015 UTC,I bought a pair of ultra boosts recently. WELL worth the investment. I cant say a rep pair is any less comfortable. I work on my feet 9hrs a day in the fitness and fashion world. ultra boosts are the most comfortable shoe to me so far. I have had lots of flyknit racers and trainers and other lunar sole sneakers. These are much better for a long day.   I am debating though on getting a rep pair of the whites or grey ones just because the silhoutte is perfect imo. I just am curious to how comfortable on a scale of 1-10 are they compared to real ones.   You can get authentics for under 150 if you have a coupon or code thats what I did and did pick up in store option.
Repsneakers,3e0so5,Disney_Dad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:13:55 2015 UTC,Saw a couple pairs on eBay for about $140 so I was thinking of that
Repsneakers,3e0so5,Appogee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:23:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know that getting Pureboosts/Ultraboost shoes will fix your issue. When I was working 5-6 hour shifts for retail (as a college student, that's a long time in my book) even my retail Pureboosts didn't really completely get rid of the pain of just standing for so long. I'd say you should try running shoes before you try Pureboosts. I'm talking real running shoes, like Brooks Glycerin 13s or like Asics Gel (Nimbus/Kayano) series shoes. Not your Nike Free labeled running shoes. If those GLVs aren't cutting it for you, idk. I just got my Volcano pair (first GL reps for me) and I'd say they're surprisingly comfortable. That being said, I think retail Pureboosts are more comfy, but it's pretty darn close.  You should also try out the Lunarglides, it's a nice balance between the plush of Lunarlon and firmness of just normal dualfusion. (Unless they've changed it in the Lunarglide 7)"
Repsneakers,3e0so5,lee714,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:14:49 2015 UTC,"You should try wearing insoles, by Dr. Scholl. Cheapest method."
Repsneakers,3e0so5,malochico1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:28:17 2015 UTC,"so i actually took this route.. found pure boost for $49.99 at finishline and also added insoles to it...so far the most comfortable shoes i have owned.. currently own nike air max reps 2014 and following originals 2 roshe, free run and chuck taylors. havent tried ultra boost yet but really thinking about buying those from david. i work 10 hour days and standing most of the time."

Few people have properly taken initiative to establish a bridge with perfectkicks and this sub.

Leaving them outside on the grass or in a puddle could possibly work if I'm understanding the chemical process correctly. I wanted to try it but I don't feeling like spending 300 just to experiment.

Repsneakers,3dvyeq,thezow,2,Mon Jul 20 00:18:52 2015 UTC,"$200 per autograph, I think you can get reps for like $50 though."
Repsneakers,3dvyeq,RichterFry,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:18:10 2015 UTC,I ordered a pair and they should be here today
Repsneakers,3dvyeq,AJXXI,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:50:00 2015 UTC,"Well I did order some from David. Got the QC pics but they just don't look right to me. I'm not an expert on spotting 'flaws' and what not but they certainly don't look new to me either and I'm not even sure if they are the version I ordered (the latest updated / same as perfectkicks). The mudguard on the left shoe looks wonky af and the suede just looks used and discoloured?. I'm wondering if they attempted to bait and switch me, I dunno :(  maybe I'm just seeing things.  Anyway I rejected them immediately and had a Skype with David who said there is no stock (it did not say this on the site it shows in stock) and offered me the last pair of US 8.5 (I am a US 8). I rejected this too as they would be too big and I am now waiting for confirmation of a refund.  Here are the QC pics  https://imgur.com/a/46FYN"
Repsneakers,3dvyeq,thechicco,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:27:45 2015 UTC,"That pair I probably would have rejected, but the suede looks fine to me. The left shoe is like bent sideways kinda also. I'm not too picky when it comes to this version of them because from what I've seen they look identical to the authentics, or at least they are far better than any previous batch so that's why I like them"
Repsneakers,3dvyeq,thechicco,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:41:26 2015 UTC,"Yeh I can't really see properly due to the lighting but the left shoe is just massively off, bent as you say."

Repsneakers,3dumrc,matt2nyy,3,Sun Jul 19 18:50:47 2015 UTC,"honestly the build quality/QC is ass. I had 2 pairs and I struggled to sell the one pair because in the factory they had basically ruined the one side with glue, this is a pic of the shitty pair and the pair I'm going to upload photos of, obviously the shitty pair is at the top. It looked even worse in person. the glue had caused the material to not be as smooth as the good pair, so even when these reps are released, aslong as they aren't completely wrong, it can be blamed on that.  http://i.imgur.com/NaSH3Wk.jpg"

Repsneakers,3douen,yung-nivek,10,Sat Jul 18 03:46:12 2015 UTC,"Lol, it's just naturally tanned leather. All they do is use minerals/vegetables to tan the leather, and then don't apply any chemicals to leave it raw. That way it patinas as you use it."
Repsneakers,3douen,RelaxAndRawr,3,Sat Jul 18 03:58:53 2015 UTC,"I used to work a lot with leather , and it looks to be just veg tanned or something similar. Nothing groundbreaking lol really common actually"
Repsneakers,3douen,Evotee,2,Sat Jul 18 04:28:09 2015 UTC,yea the whole point of henders is thick veg tanned leather
Repsneakers,3douen,zootam,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:45:01 2015 UTC,"Yep , still don't understand why they cost so much , craftsmanship sure ,  but materials themselves can be had for quite cheap"
Repsneakers,3douen,Evotee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:54:10 2015 UTC,"its the hype  same as any other ""designer""  i'd bet you could get quality reps for $200-$500"
Repsneakers,3douen,zootam,2,Sun Jul 19 01:55:27 2015 UTC,"Lol, it's moreso the craftsmanship than the hype. When you don't outsource your production to a third world country, the cost of production goes of up significantly. Most designers used to be made in house. But companies like Burberry, Louis Vuitton, and other lower end luxury designers have gone abroad and jack up prices even though their quality has already gone downhill. Hermes, Bottega, and Chanel which are at the top of the luxury brands all keep their production in the country of origin.   Having to make sure that their artisans have a fair wage will absolutely pass the cost of production onto the consumer. So really, the price is justified not just in the quality of materials, but really the craftsmanship and ensuring that your employees get a livable wage.  Think about how limited the numbers are for Hender Scheme. Think about how their sizing is all extremely limited. They don't have too many options, because they don't have the skilled labor to produce these pieces in every living size, nor to drive the price down so much that it's going to be within the lower end luxury price range."

Repsneakers,3douen,zootam,4,Sun Jul 19 02:00:56 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't that logic apply to any expensive shoe you pay for? And the point of raw leather is that it is meant to get marked up, to give it that worn in look."
Repsneakers,3douen,RelaxAndRawr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:33:50 2015 UTC,"Lol, if they could reproduce them for 200-500 that would be unreasonable? Even though people are paying within that range for rep yeezys?"
