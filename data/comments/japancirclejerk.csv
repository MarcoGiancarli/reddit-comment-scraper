On the other hand, I'm not going to cry ""racist"" because he doesn't know English and won't take reservations in English. People in that thread are harping on that and it's really messing up my わ。"

For free. And one with the hotel I worked at, and only had to pay for drinks. His stuff was not as good as I have had at some other places.

Apparently, ""外人 don't understand sushi"", so if he has to put up with them, he expects the 日本人 with them to deal with their 外人ness.   So, whenever foreigners came asking us to make reservations, we would  just tell them it was fully booked, and make them a reservation at a better place."

My submission was mostly based on the comments that were something similar to ""He doesn't speak English! He's racist against foreigners!"" Meaning that their opinion of his racism is based on his inability to speak English.  From what I've read you've got a less than 50% chance of booking at that restaurant depending on which staff member you talk to and if a hotel concierge is calling for you. So yes, I concede that he may be xenophobic but not for the reason ascribed."

japancirclejerk,3dwuzj,Teamonsterggg,17,Mon Jul 20 07:02:04 2015 UTC,"/unjerk  The people here are probably the people enjoying Japan the most, free from the self imposed burdens of either being a Cultural AmbassadorTM or getting microagressed by the school cafeteria lady who was blown away by our お箸スキル. We're the few who don't take living here like some important mission and can actually just enjoy it for what it is."
japancirclejerk,3dwuzj,SoKratez,13,Mon Jul 20 07:14:22 2015 UTC,"In honesty, the people who are enjoying Japan the most probaby are not posting daily to an internet forum about Japan. I find it quite entertaining though so perhaps it is different strokes for different folks"
japancirclejerk,3dwuzj,Teamonsterggg,8,Mon Jul 20 07:41:22 2015 UTC,You can enjoy Japan just fine and still have enough time to talk about it online.   I can't speak for other people but I view this as my water cooler. I come here when I've got 5 minutes to myself and want to think about something other than work.   When I had a job with more adult human interaction I pretty much had similar conversations to people face to face. I don't spend time here when I'm busy or have something better to do. Plus every now and then I get to help people out.
japancirclejerk,3dwuzj,JonesBlows,5,Mon Jul 20 08:08:46 2015 UTC,"Well yeah like I said, different strokes. Ill be entirely honest though and say it is my water cooler also, but that Id probably prefer to have more chance to bitch and moan in real life. So in that sense, it is a kind of friend substitution. I might be wrong though, and just genuinely enjoy this kind of interaction. It might jist be it being a newish thing that gives it stigma."

Circlejerk subs are meant to make fun of things that are common on reddit by parodying them. This sub just links to other posts to say ""LOOK HOW DUMB GO GET 'EM"".   Low effort, and annoying to people who don't know enough about jcj to ignore it, 'cause you guys are impossible to placate."

Sometimes it feels like cjc is where people go to psych themselves up to go be assholes, while knowing they have their pals behind them for security.   Cjc recently linked to a month-old post in an obscure support/humour sub I love, and again were being dicks over nothing, so right now I'm probably the bitter one to be honest."

japancirclejerk,3dwuzj,AstaraelGateaux,7,Mon Jul 20 05:36:40 2015 UTC,"Because it finds humour in other ways than some assholes making fun of people and patting each other on the back.   This sub is like that big group of kids at school. There are a few genuinely funny people, who tend to overlap with the ""fairly decent"" category. But then their little gang attracted a whole bunch of stupid unfunny assholes who have no friends anywhere else, who try to be ""part of it"" by jumping in like ""LOOK I FUCKING #TOLD THAT WEEB WHO WANTED TO COME TO JAPAN HAHA FUCKING WEEK I'm funny I'm part of the gang right guys??""   I mean seriously, sometimes it seems like the most benign comment will get jumped on. ""Oh I quite like Japan, it's really nice."" ""WTF WHY DO YOU THINK JAPAN IS NICE IT'S NOT FUCKING NICE IT'S EXACTLY LIKE EVERY PLACE IN THE WORLD. BET YOU COME OVER AND FUCKING EMBARASS YOURSELF READING YOUR DUMB MANGA YOU FUCKING WEEB.""

That's bullshit. Either everything is fair game for humour, whether you like it or not, or nothing is.  I prefer the people that are offended by everything, at least they are consistent."
japancirclejerk,3dwuzj,AstaraelGateaux,4,Mon Jul 20 06:23:56 2015 UTC,"What you guys do is funny, until it spills out onto other subs.

Brigading/thread derailment/personal attacks (why is stalking a users history so common practice here? Srsly?) is just cringey.   But yeah I guess this sub can be good or bad, to my tastes.

If reddit didn't want that information public they wouldn't make it public. Absolutely doxxing someone in real life is horrible, and should result in a public banning, but if you don't want to be judged for what you write, don't post in a public forum.  The same goes for me or anyone else.  Re: The ""main"" subs. There are mods there that are quite ready with the ban hammer to anyone that get's out of hand.

japancirclejerk,3dwuzj,AstaraelGateaux,4,Mon Jul 20 06:45:30 2015 UTC,"You can stalk people in public places. By your logic would it be normal and healthy to follow someone from their house to their work every morning, as long as they took public roads? If you are having an argument with someone (which people on cjc do often) you should be able to attack their arguments and not their post history. Going back through their previous posts to argue with them more is just very strange, to be honest.   Stuff doesn't have to be against the rules to be cringey and dickish. Saying ""it's not against the rules!"" isn't much of a defence. I'm not claiming anything is against the rules."

Especially when everybody and their fucking brother is posting from behind a netnym anyway. I don't understand how the fuck anybody acts surprised or violated that others can see stuff they have publicly posted, and all the more so when nobody has any fucking clue who they are anyway.  Since I first got online in 1997, I've posted under my real name. Anybody who wants to ""stalk"" my fucking posting history can do it here, or any of a number of other places quite easily if they're that bored.

Oh well, just gonna post it here:    People walk so fucking slow on the street. Since I am a tall gaijin, I walk a lot faster. Unfortunately, the entire infrastructure is build for old people. That spooky skellington 120 year old crippled up motherfucker I passed two seconds after the light turned green, she reaches the next light as it turns green. And I've been standing here, waiting for about an hour. 2fast4japan  Also,  I brought my expensive smoking to Japan, but I am not allowed to wear it anywhere. ""No smoking, 1000 yen penalty"" it says all over the city.   You are not allowed to take pictures of children.  The foooking sidewalk is more uneven than the Himalayas. You basically play Russian roulette with every step you take. Do you smash down into a hole in the ground or do you stumble because it suddenly goes up? Or is it just flat? Talking about flat, wearing flat sneakers here is difficult enough. Wearing heels is borderline impossible. Almost all females wear heels here anyway, so maybe that's why they walk so slow.   You never win anything in the vending machines. Fuck those.   Stores and trains are too cold.   Everything is in Japanese.   The tap water smells and tastes like shitty chlorine pool water.   All parks and mountains are privately owned and you need to pay an entrance fee because fuck you and everything you stand for.   Everything is too small. I'm just trying to buy manga in book off, and of course I brought my trusty gaijin backpack. Everybody was trying to sneak past me and I often knocked books and merchandise on the floor. Shitty infrastructure.   Talking about infrastructure... What is up with the lack of sidewalks and .. well, bicycles riding on the sideWALK?   All bicycles are shitty, old, rusty bicycles from the 40's. They screech and make your ears bleed every time they move.   All drinks ard carbonated, and carbonated drinks in Japan tend to lose all their cool bubbles and shit 2 minutes after you open then. Yes, even Coke.   Cup noodles don't come with boiling water. Then how am I supposed to eat them?  Talking about cup noodles.. I often get a plastic fucking fork when I buy food at supermarkets or a konbini. Ohashi tsukaemasu yo! Stop the racism.   Taxis will mow you down and you are expected to run across the street even when the light is green and you have the right of way.   Stores make their fucking baIto JKs yell about their new amazing sale for like 12 hours a day, every day. Sometimes there are multiple stores like this next to each other and it's impossible to even hear your own thoughts over the teenage school girl moaning.   People will say ""HARRO!!!"" to you when you walk past them, and they will ask where you come from.   Most alcoholic beverages are either bullshit 3% cans of fruit juice that will get the average JK drunk in 20 minutes or beer. Or sake.   You get a billion plastic bags and even more coins every time you buy something.  Everybody you talk to are busy when you need then to do something for you. They promised to show you around when you come to Japan, but they were just bullshitting you.   Everything is noisy. Especially those pedestrian walk across the road when light turns green things. DOOT DOOT. DOODOO DOOT!   Girls call you kakkoii, not because you ARE kakkoii but because you are white.   It's impossible to find licorice, dark rye bread and other candy here.  Talking about candy... All sour cream and onion chips are actually either norishio (seaweed and salt) or wasabi flavored. You will get fooled a lot, trust me.   You need more?"

According to Wikipedia, the leaf blower was invented in Japan, but as a tool to apply pesticide, not for blowing leaves. Leaf blowers are absolutely ubiquitous in my part of the U.S., and besides the noise I'm not too keen in inhaling the brake dust they kick up. Japan has a reputation for generally being suprisingly clean. Are leaf blowers widely used there? Or do they sweep up all of those cherry blossoms with old school broom technology? Another nuisance (which can really wreck your quality of life) is living near people who let their dogs bark in the middle of the night. I would hope that wouldn't be much of a problem in an apartment complex, but what about areas where homes have a ""yard""? (Anything fenced in which the dog might spend time in during the night.) How common is dog ownership anyway? What about people stomping around on the floor above you in the wee hours? Noisy garbage trucks early in the morning? What are the nuisances of daily life in Japan?"

It looks kind of cool and futuristic, but also a bit old fashioned and traditional. There are a lot of people walking about the area and there are many cars on the street.  I think there are also many signs around, but I can't be sure since I can't read kanji to save my life, and I may just not be noticing most of the English signs (ROMAJI, for any dumb, slow-witted fucktsticks out there).  Anyone have a clue where my dream is taking place in Tokyo? It may or may not exist, but, if it does, I think there was an escalator somewhere, and I distinctly smelled a Pizza Hut meatlovers pizza with extra cheese.  Any ideas?"

When I first came to Japan I used to think that guys who had been here twenty years or so must know everything about Japan. As time went on, I came to realize that the amount of time a person had lived here in and of itself doesn't mean jackshit and no one should ever be impressed by how long someone has been here; there are just too many examples of people who have been here for decades and who are essentially as clueless, uninformed, unaware, and uninquisitive as they were the first day they got here. Similarly, one shouldn't be automatically dismissive of those who haven't been here very long.

japancirclejerk,3dflq6,mankohound,6,Thu Jul 16 04:01:38 2015 UTC,"From op:   Hi, I'm a Chinese born in the US. I am curious as to how I should choose a Japanese name for when I visit Japan for studying abroad etc. (I am also considering living in Japan, but that decision is still a bit far to make.) My Chinese name is (surname) 李 (given name) 尚彬. In my given name the character 尚 is passed down the family, so the most important characters are the first and last characters. I've read about On-yomi and Kun-yomi pronunciations, though neither sound like great ways to choose a name. Anyhow, I decided to look up some of the characters in my name but the results only confused me:   http://imgur.com/qZpL0e5,kr95Wod   How can one character represent multiple given name/surnames o.o? Could you guys help me out? Thanks in advance!   also   I don't know what my motive has to do with answering the question... but the reason why I'd like to have my own Japanese name is because it is more fun that way. I am aware that I can choose a simple method to make things easier, but I'm just curious as to how 李 can represent multiple surnames in kanji."

japancirclejerk,3dflq6,kabajingai,3,Thu Jul 16 03:27:30 2015 UTC,OP - you have just lectured a Chinese person on what Chinese characters are...  Congratulations on your absolutely stupidity. Its brought a smile to my face this morning.   Love from the arse-end of China....  xx
japancirclejerk,3dflq6,pixiebeegarden,7,Wed Jul 15 22:59:02 2015 UTC,"Except OP is American, and clearly doesn't know what kanji are.  Please correct my mistakes as I'm happy to admit I'm wrong."
japancirclejerk,3dflq6,pixiebeegarden,5,Wed Jul 15 23:35:52 2015 UTC,"I think it's going to be kind of weird to anyone who didn't grow up with two names (and I agree that OP doesn't seem to understand how kanji works in Japan), but what he's asking is actually somewhat common among those with names that have Chinese characters, even if they were raised in the West with a separate western name.  The reason I have a western name (and why my parents took on western first names) is because my parents felt that assimilation was important, and that you should have a name that locals can pronounce (unlike some of my childhood friends who have impossible to read Taiwanese-based names).  They thus encouraged me to just use the Japanese reading of my Taiwanese name in Japan (which my grandparents also did when they grew up in Japan), because as far as they were concerned, my Taiwanese name was just as much my legitimate name and would probably be more approachable in Japan.  Luckily for me, I never really liked my US passport name anyway, and was already using my Taiwanese name in most non-English speaking circles.    Again, as I said in the thread, this doesn't mean I think you should be picking random local names just because you moved to a country, especially if you don't come from a culture that believes in localizing names."
japancirclejerk,3dflq6,hachihoshino,4,Thu Jul 16 00:02:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input.  Perhaps I am missing something here but don't kanji operate the same way in Chinese and Japanese? My (limited) understanding is that the pronunciation changes with the context in Chinese as it does in Japanese.  If OP doesn't understand that about his own culture, why is he trying to translate his name via google, and then being so completely mystified by the multiple readings?"
japancirclejerk,3dflq6,hachihoshino,8,Thu Jul 16 00:20:41 2015 UTC,"In Chinese, pronunciation tends to be more fixed (relatively few characters have multiple pronunciations, though you may have some tonal changes), but the pronunciation does change with dialect. In Chinese names, we tend to be more attached to the characters in the name and not so much the sound, whereas, the sound of the name is a huge consideration in Japanese names (and thus you sometimes get strange use of kanji in names here and some rather odd names)."
japancirclejerk,3dflq6,Legal_Rampage,2,Thu Jul 16 00:31:27 2015 UTC,Cool. Thanks for the info! TIL.
japancirclejerk,3dflq6,Legal_Rampage,5,Thu Jul 16 00:51:49 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I haven't studied much Chinese, but from what I understand of the basics, that's not how Chinese works. One of the things which makes the much larger number of hanzi in Chinese manageable is that their pronunciation is consistent - a single character is pronounced in the same manner (slight inflections aside) no matter where it turns up.  The larger number of characters also means that many characters which have a whole lot of meanings in Japanese are more specific in Chinese; over the years Japanese gradually merged a bunch of similar characters together into one character with a ton of nuances.  It's not unreasonable at all for a Chinese person with no experience of the Japanese language to be confused by multiple readings for one character. I had exactly this conversation at one point with an ex who was British Chinese and perfectly fluent in Cantonese; he asked me out of interest how his name would be pronounced in Japanese, and was seriously thrown by the idea that there were multiple possible pronunciations of the characters."

Teller probably could have chosen his words better, but somehow I suspect that even if he'd just smiled and did ""Japan huh? Heh, wasn't expecting that!"" ol' Debito would be offended already.  Debito meanwhile definitely should have just handled it with humor. ""I get that a lot"" or even an educational ""People seem to think it's impossible to naturalize to Japan but actually it's not that hard"" or whatever, let the teller say ""huh. Didn't realize, that's cool"" and gone on with his day. But of course he can't do that, because... well, he's Debito.

If someone in JAPAN had complained about his ID when he was there speaking to them in Japanese (with his foreign accent!) then he might get some more sympathy.

japancirclejerk,3dbctx,KafkaDatura,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:50:20 2015 UTC,"Nope.    What time period does hair testing cover?    The typical length of head hair tested is 1½ inches from the root end. Since the average growth rate of human head hair is approximately ½ inch (1.3 cm) per month a hair analysis covers an approximate 90 day time frame. This time frame is an approximation only since an individual’s actual hair growth rate may vary from the average.   So, if you've got shoulder length hair, you've got around 3 years of hair growth for them to test should they feel like it."

Physical dependence on a substance i.e your exhibition of withdrawal symptoms can present themselves even when you use a substance acutely.   If you're talking about addiction, that's a whole different ballgame, in which individual cortical differences/mental health histories/ history of environmental factors/stress etc. must all be taken into consideration. I don't buy the whole notion of people falling into addiction because they were morally fallible and ergo deserve it. For any given substance, depending on how their reward system is wired, 20% will become mired in addiction to the substance regardless of the dosages involved.   But, whatever floats your boat man. Let's all go back towards the 1930s - 1950s social policy and treatment of drugs. Don't come crying to me when your pharmacist prescribes you a selective CB1 agonist/5HT2AR antagonist compound, for whatever chronic pain you develop later down the line and you're paralyzed by the term Cannabinoid.

japancirclejerk,3d9ppl,drinktusker,3,Tue Jul 14 17:10:57 2015 UTC,/unjerk  Does anyone have any statistics for nationwide performance on things like TOEFL/TOEIC prior to the JET/ALT program and what they're like now?  I sincerely believe the JET program has made a difference in Japan...just not in the area of English education.
japancirclejerk,3d9ppl,mike_cash,5,Tue Jul 14 22:00:47 2015 UTC,"It was never actually meant to help English education, not really. The whole point was to make foreigners less exotic and scary by putting one in every classroom full of inaka kids who would otherwise never interact with one; with a side-benefit of providing loads of foreign graduates with experience of Japan and thus extending the country's overseas promotion and soft power efforts.   English education was waaaay down the list of considerations. It's only in recent years that the country has started fretting over its shitty English abilities and begun to see JET as a potential resource for improving that, though the policies to change the role of the programme and orient it more towards English education haven't been devised as yet - we're still in the ""throw more cash at it and see what happens"" phase."
japancirclejerk,3d9ppl,hachihoshino,2,Wed Jul 15 03:00:25 2015 UTC,I certainly give them full credit for exposing inaka kids to foreigners. The difference in the way kids out in the sticks react to foreigners is like fucking daylight and dark compared to what it used to be.

japancirclejerk,3d9ppl,mike_cash,2,Wed Jul 15 03:08:51 2015 UTC,"No, but I read a research the other day when figuring out how to bash Japanese English education that showed Japanese teachers are more willing to do communicative-based English lessons when an ALT is in the classroom rather than their shitty grammar-translation shtick. This was a very small and limited study though.  Gorsuch, G. (2001). Japanese EFL teachers: perceptions of communicative, audiolingual and yakudoku activities: the plan versus the reality.

japancirclejerk,3d9ppl,notadialect,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:43:12 2015 UTC,"Yet we never seem to hear ALTs talking about doing those activities, only about how their JTEs don't want them there."
japancirclejerk,3d9ppl,mike_cash,3,Wed Jul 15 04:24:52 2015 UTC,"I would say I do speaking and structured communication activities in a little over 3/4 of my classes. The other 5 classes I dont do such activities which is with the same teacher.  People just bitch about it, but to be honest, if a teacher asks you to make an activity make it good. I'm sure the people who bitch generally suck balls at the job. People think good and fun are the same, but that's bullshit. Good can be fun but it isn't such a close relationship as fresh off the boat round-eyes think it is."
japancirclejerk,3d9ppl,notadialect,3,Wed Jul 15 06:09:05 2015 UTC,I was sort of wondering if there was some correlation between ALTs who say their JTEs don't want them in the class and just how shitty that particular ALT might be. We only ever get to hear the ALT side of the story.
japancirclejerk,3d9ppl,mike_cash,2,Wed Jul 15 10:32:15 2015 UTC,Its because they either hate it or they think theyve developed some kind of unique style and dont wanna share. I think that people get paranoid here that someone will take their amazing ideas and get famous on the back of it.
japancirclejerk,3d9ppl,Teamonsterggg,2,Wed Jul 15 08:57:23 2015 UTC,"It'd be a major surprise not to see improvements on those scores over 20 plus years, but that doesnt measure the effectiveness of ALTs really.  The TOEIC and TOEFL are shit measurements anyway, much like the JLPTs. At my baito, the management like placing students on their TOEIC scores and they end up very out of their depth, and leave disheartened. It is misleading and that is putting it mildly.   My own guess would be they could scrap the ALT programme if the Japanese teachers were not quite so problematic themselves."

It's the same reason I don't hang out with language school students, they are so boring and babied by their respective schools. Foreign exchange students are generally a different case.

I've been in 2 ALTs companies so far. 1st roster : mostly male in their late 30s to early 40s. 2nd one : mostly female from late 40 to early 50s.   And yet, I keep reading that ALTs are young English native in their early 20s getting the fun of Japanese pussies - and just realized that a part of the JET programm actually consist of ALT work in that specific demographic.   Maybe the Jet ALT are the loudest over social media? No idea. But looking at numbers, they certainly are not representative of the job, as most of their profiles would never get hired by a private company ."
japancirclejerk,3d8f64,KafkaDatura,2,Wed Jul 15 00:58:54 2015 UTC,I know almost every ALT in my prefecture and I can assure you that more than 90% of them are under the age of 30. Most came when they were in their early 20s. Most of them are still in their early to mid 20s.
japancirclejerk,3d8f64,KafkaDatura,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:52:23 2015 UTC,"Are they JET ?   I wonder how those things work, maybe it's on the BOE level? No idea. My first contract I was 31 and I was one of the, if not the youngest of the ALT team. This year, only one guy is in his 25s, but married with a kid which adds up a bit of age I guess.   In the end, more surprising than the age disparity is the level of geographical concentration. I was always wondering why ALT were so much seen as, really, 20-something young prick enjoying his time."
japancirclejerk,3d8f64,SoKratez,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:07:23 2015 UTC,It's a mix. I don't think it is BOE level because there are some people in their 30s and atleast one or two above 40.

japancirclejerk,3d76c5,MercurysMessage,5,Tue Jul 14 03:32:32 2015 UTC,"to be safe:    I'm mainly curious about if my hairstyle could have any bearing on my interactions with a) Japanese women, and b) Japanese employers. I have hair that's light brown and curly (slightly lighter and curlier than actors Jesse Eisenburg and Andy Samberg). It is virtually un-stylable (even with large amounts of gel and/or spray), grows upward and outward rather than down, and gets slightly curlier in humid climates like Japan. The only thing I can really effect is how long I choose to grow it (it never really looks neat or tidy but less noticeable relative to my face or body when it's shorter) I understand that with pretty much anyone who notices me I will stick out as a goofy-looking foreigner, but when it comes to the length/volume of my hair how big and wild should I let it get? I have no idea what the preferences of Japanese women who like foreigners might be and I'm not really sure what the expectations for neatness employers might have. Do you think I'd be best off getting my hair cut frequently to try and look slightly more normal, or am I best to embrace the appearance of the Jewfro? Thanks for your insights and advice!"

Due to low fundings, the landlord permitted me to rent a portion of the basement ""9 feet x 10 feet. The basement is a vast emptiness of cement which the landlord drew outline borders with chalk (Although he did say I could expand slightly). The flooring is cement(or concrete, I'm not sure).   I spent about $30 making a 9 feet by 9 feet platform: 4 Parallel 2"" thick planks of wood on the floor topped by a 5x9 feet plywood and 4x9 feet plywood. I have ordered a futon and a covering from shop.matsustore.com after reading other subreddits stating how great they were and comfortable. and I've bought a cubby from ikea to fit 1x9 feet. Note: If you have any advice to any of the items I've purchase, I'll gladly take it into considerations; particularly the tatami/goza/bamboo mat and Futon choice.  Question 1: Can I place Tatami Mats on top of plywood? Would it be damaged by doing so? This is for the future if I've come to like Tatami Mats. My work and college are near the apartment, so when I save enough money to splurge, then I will purchase tatami mats.  Question 2: For now, would Goza Mats suffice on top of the plywood for comfort on the futon and studying/work? Do Goza Mats have the same effect on humidity and temperature as Tatami Mats?  Question 3: Could I use a Bamboo Rug instead of goza mat? I would like the same function as a tatami mat and comfort on a futon and studying. Would bamboo mat be equivalent to a goza mat or tatami mat?  Forgot to mention I am still in the USA without capabilities to go to warehouses and purchase things. Everything will be bought online. Thank you in Advance. Sorry for bad grammar and/or formatting. I am new to reddit usage."

Indeed, I do have the funds for moving into a better apartment--probably a $1300 a month would be easy to sustain in-- but I've been sleeping on the floor for 4 years, and the $25 a month is hard to pass when that includes a great kitchen and a shower. The basement is not an issue as there are windows which bring in sunlight along with ceiling lights and fan. It is also quiet in the basement as a door and a hallway separates the furnace from the basement area. I don't need a lot of space to do my work and studies.

Developed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development and published by Nintendo, it was released in all regions in November 2011. The game makes use of the Wii MotionPlus peripheral for sword fighting, with a revised Wii Remote pointing system used for targeting.   A limited-edition bundle featuring a golden Wii Remote Plus was sold coinciding with the game's launch; the first run of both the standard game and the limited-edition bundle included a CD containing orchestrated tracks of iconic music from the franchise in celebration of its 25th anniversary.

japancirclejerk,3cyuat,TheSimonToUrGarfunkl,16,Sun Jul 12 02:18:27 2015 UTC,"Japan has however passed a new law going into effect 2017 that states that foreigners are only permitted to appear in public if their foreign face is properly covered with a horse mask. This is actually to enforce equality since no one will be able to tell they're foreign anymore (Japanese people can wear horse masks, too, you know).   Never thought I'd see our fav ginger trolling her own weeb viewerbase. The responses to this are priceless.   I couldn't find any information on this on the web? Really confused. If I went there on holiday would I have to? Wow is this really true? I am very surprised by this. Is this foreal??? I wanted to visit so badly but now I don't know.... Please say this is a joke lol Why horse, couldn't they put on other masks or like some type of makeup I really, really, really hope that this is a troll. If it isn't, I'd be very mad at Japan. It's like Saudi Arabia forcing women who come into their country to wear hijab! I really hope this is false...I don't really think this is funny. WHAT? why horse mask? I want to wear kimono too TT  but i don't have any horse mask I feel that foreigners would be upset about this. It would be inconvenient to see the sites, eat food or speak to others with a mask on. Moreover if foreigners are forced to wear them wont Japanese people be able to single them out as ""the-one-in-the-horse-mask""?  Not trying to pick a fight or anything. Just my opinion. If that is the case they will lose foreign investment and investor because that would a slap in the face and it can be taken as an insult so the Japanese people better rethink what they are doing May I ask if you could do a video explaining further about this topic? Seeing as I would love to go to Japan when I'm older, the new law concerns me a bit. Thank you!   I think this is the first sign she's starting to get tired of her shit-ass weeb viewers.

Then basically defends it and talks about other plastic surgery mods. I wouldn't doubt she has had a lot of work done on her face as well.   Great, so some guy gets to marry that (お金もちだけください！）and have fucked up looking kids."
japancirclejerk,3cxw9u,throwaway2957108,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:48:47 2015 UTC,Unless she had a ton of work done (and it seems obvious she's had her eyes/nose done in addition to the grapefruit halves she's had bolted onto her chest - hopefully she didn't go the full jaw shave/reshape thing) she started out as a moderately to very attractive girl.  The biggest problem with the bolt ons is they don't fit her frame at all (she's on the super low end for body fat and needs to do some squats cause she's got a bad case of Asian girl's ass).
japancirclejerk,3cxw9u,bulldogdiver,2,Mon Jul 13 00:47:27 2015 UTC,"she started out as a moderately to very attractive girl.    See, you would think that.

Even if she looks good now, I sure as hell wouldn't want to put up with her bullshit. At least she is outward about her appearance in that every guy knows she had plastic surgery done. If I were at the top of Chinese society and had my pick, you bet I would pick a naturally beautiful girl, rather than a fake plastic doll that I have to question, ""Is her face even real?"" Not good for my future kids."

japancirclejerk,3cwp3o,chunter16,14,Sun Jul 12 02:18:32 2015 UTC,"It's because all Japanese are hentai. The voice actors are hentai too. Now Japanese people are so hentai, they don't even have sex with each other anymore"

japancirclejerk,3cwp3o,ternite,11,Sun Jul 12 01:57:28 2015 UTC,"OP:   I was thinking to myself how most porn has terrible acting on anything besides the sex. If there is any story whatsoever, it usualy comes out as cheesy and totaly fake, no ""suspension of disbelief"" is archieved.  Then I remembered about hentai, where english dubs are even worse than live action porn, but the original in japanese always sounds authentic.  Then it got me wondering if the reason for that might be because I cant speak japanese at all. So, for all the japanese-speaking-hentai-loving out there: is voice acting in hentai usualy good, or does it sound totally fake like most porn?  Do hentai voice actors/actresses earn good money, comparable to normal anime voice actors? Can they easily get non-adult anime gigs normaly or is it like, once you voice hentai you are shunned and cant get work in normal anime? Is hentai voice acting a taboo?  Also, please let me know if im breaking any rules, should have taged this NSFW or should have posted it elsewhere."

japancirclejerk,3cwp3o,ternite,5,Sat Jul 11 12:50:25 2015 UTC,"Abandon all hope ye who enter.  Voiceover work in any country is one of those desirable, creative professions that pays poorly unless you get a large volume of work. Therefore, if you watch enough anime you'll see that you're hearing the same voices over and over again, even after many years of material. Adult work is just another gig."
japancirclejerk,3cwp3o,methodone_clinic,3,Sat Jul 11 14:55:17 2015 UTC,"Nice. This does answer half of my post. How about the quality of acting, though? Is it good? Is it worse on hentai than on regular anime?"
japancirclejerk,3cwp3o,ternite,2,Sat Jul 11 15:29:04 2015 UTC,Comparative logic would seem to dictate that if both hentai and anime both use a similar pool of actors then both hentai and anime would have similar voice acting!  And at least in the case of anime Japanese voice actors vs. English voice actors the Japanese is always better. This is because voice acting in Japan is a pretty legit career whereas the voice actors for English dubs are usually pulled from a random Community College's theater department and are hired very cheaply. Then you get to hentai and due to the puritanical nature of Western Society no one but porn stars will touch hentai. So to finally answer your strange question: Japanese voice acting is always better than the English dubbing regardless on genre.
japancirclejerk,3cwp3o,nnubiletus,3,Sat Jul 11 15:42:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, that does make sense, and I did kind of figure that already, but I could just speculate or I could ask people to see if I can get an answer from people who know more than me and are not speculating. Thanks for the reply."

There are far too many people who come to Japan who appear to lack even the most basic understanding of humour, irony, and how to behave like an adult; like those humourless fucks over in /r/JapanTravel, who worship the meat of the clown more than would be considered healthy in most circles, for example.  After considerable analysis, JCJ is a psychological mode of conditioning certain Japan aficionados towards becoming human beings, and integrating them into society at large. Not everyone makes it; but those that do, find that that see the world in a more balanced light. The failures and dropouts too find that they have learned a valuable lesson; some of them even settle up their affairs in good order before retreating to their place of origin to contemplate the life lessons learned from their valuable experiences here. The lost and the damned simply disappear into the night, along with one or two ice creams from the freezer, never to be heard from again."

I've worked for 2 months as an ALT.  The only thing that makes my job worth it, is that I can make my own games, activities, and teach the way I want to teach. I don't let others tell me how to do my job. Because unlike most people that come here, nobody wants to actually take this job seriously.   Someone has a bit of a messiah complex. ""I've only been doing this for 2 months, but I am GOD. No one shall help me with their stupid advice.""  EDIT Further evidence of OP's messiah complex:   Wow. Lol, ya'll take this one comment and assume the worst. I've read through most of your comments thus far and of course you are mixing up what I said with something else. To all those that are using the excuse "" adjusting to real life/ adulthood etc"". I've probably been working longer than you. Probably better at the same job than you too. I find it funny how those getting all pissy about little things. I was merely annoyed at the fact he heard a couple students not say "" apple ZU"" .. I walk around the room when words are being said. So everyone from any corner can hear me and I can hear them. Ya'll cute for getting pissy. Keep it coming.

They got no co-workers to call them out on their bullshit, and denial that they aren't wasting their time in a job where almost no-one actually wants them there.  The teachers don't want them, most of the students couldn't give a shit about their lessons, everyone on the internet makes fun of them, and they are probably posted in some inaka hell hole where they can't live out their dreams of getting a job a video game company or scouted as a model."

japancirclejerk,3cqt33,Teamonsterggg,5,Fri Jul 10 02:10:16 2015 UTC,"It's a defense mechanism. It is quite common for new teachers (without the right training or guidance) to either get over-confident or to just get frustrated and to say ""well this is a load of bullshit anyway"" and spend their time messing about.  This is amplified by being isolated here. A lot of people here say stuff like ""but I actually take it seriously, unlike most other ALTs"".

It makes people know there is a world outside perhaps.  I tend to get more from not being a sycophant. I think as a foreigner especially, you are free to have your own opinion. I do it every chance I get and while I get some stick back, it is better than trying to just fit in I think.   Also, these kids could do with learning about this stuff, for sure.

japancirclejerk,3cnkqn,SuperchargedJesus,29,Thu Jul 9 08:10:56 2015 UTC,"Handy checklist for walking like a native:   Quickly dart out of any doorway onto the sidewalk without watching for traffic or stopping When taking corners, always go for the inside of the turn, regardless of any markings on the ground indicating pedestrian flow Bury your face in your phone to let others know you're a serious walker If you get distracted by something or realize you're going the wrong way, stop as abruptly as possible and just stand absolutely still for a few seconds or minutes, while pondering your own existence and the very meaning of life itself If you notice any form of moisture gently wafting from the sky, open your umbrella before any icky water touches your skin When the moisture has completely ceased, your umbrella should remain open for at least a few more minutes until you're absolutely sure no more icky moisture may touch you After collapsing your umbrella, be sure to swing it around you in a way as to potentially strike anyone walking in front, next to, or behind you; mix it up for shits and giggles When walking with anyone you're having a conversation with, be sure to walk side-by-side and plow through any oncoming pedestrians--this works best in groups of three or more After reaching your destination with said group, form an impenetrable circle while facing each other and be as obnoxious as possible while fully obstructing any nearby entrance or pathway Walk slower than anyone around you to show how humble you are, while gently weaving in front of anyone who tries to pass you Walking up and down a flight of stairs can be hard work, so take a well-deserved break directly at the top or bottom of them; this is even more helpful to those around you, especially when it's crowded, so that all those around you may take a little break at the same time All that hard walking is sometimes rewarded by moving walkways, which should be fully utilized and enjoyed by camping out on them in such a way that you can obstruct any passage around you; be creative! Crosswalks at unsignalized locations are merely decorative, so don't burden yourself to use them when crossing; all drivers here are clairvoyant enough to know when and where you will cross the street, wherever you choose that to be For ladies with handbags the size of fully mature pot-bellied pigs (and the hip, metrosexual men who tote them as well), carry ones that are as sharply angular as possible and as heavy as your shoulder can physically withstand; this will protect your flank from being overtaken by any other pedestrians Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo was ultimately due to inadequate protection of his flank, so, with your free hand, swing it out at as far of an arc as possible in a repeating, sweeping manner to dissuade any would-be deposers from usurping your sluggish sidewalk position     EDIT: Thank you for the addendums; I will incorporate them into the list with a few more of my nuggets of walking wisdom."

japancirclejerk,3cnkqn,cubebreak,2,Thu Jul 9 12:01:55 2015 UTC,"Don't be silly, there aren't any rules about wiping your ass.

Both the points he's making and the language he's using to do it are very, very at odds with the discussions of race and race-sensitivity I encountered in London. I'm generally a bit disturbed about how the highly charged, confrontational and aggressive politics of race from the USA are seeping into discourse elsewhere - I understand why America is like that and even why it's needed, to a degree, but it's seriously unconstructive in other cultural and historical contexts."

japancirclejerk,3ck7bc,Teamonsterggg,15,Thu Jul 9 11:24:58 2015 UTC,"Anyway, flash forward 4 years to the birth of our son in 2013. Initially, things were wonderful. Whatever hormones the pregnancy triggered worked wonders on my wife and she became super-affectionate woman. All she wanted to do was take care of me, cook for me, do cleaning, etc.    Ah yes, hormones made his Japanese wife into the subservient housemaid he wanted!  I mean, wifey is abusive and the kid needs to be away from her, but I'm pretty sure the warning signs were there before kiddo came along."
japancirclejerk,3ck7bc,kabajingai,11,Wed Jul 8 15:58:44 2015 UTC,"She's probably very attractive and the OP isn't. I'll spell this now out for you guys, if you ever meet a fit girl in Japan and she doesn't have a boyfriend or even had a history of a long-term boyfriends - she is either fucking crazy or a workaholic.   My ex was the same. Absolutely fucking stunning but she had a history of short-term guys. It became obvious why that was the case. She had a really wicked temper on her and came from a really shitty background. (Dad was an abusive alcoholic and the parents split up when she was a kid.)   Despite all that, I was glad we broke up. Because I kinda cringe to think what would have happened had I married her and had a kid together.  I think the OP in this post is your stereotypical long-term Japanophile eikaiwa burnout. Fair enough if he accidentally knocked this chick up and was guilt-tripped into marrying her. But he made the conscious effort to marry her and have a kid despite the obvious warning signs. That's why I'm struggling to feel any real sympathy for him."

I feel sorry for the kid.  But there was a comment in that thread that was pretty good I thought, basically both of them had some silly stereotypes of each other and thought moving to the other country would solve all of their issues.

The hours are long, which I knew going in and really don't mind, but the problem is the sheer workload. Tons of lesson prep required, grading, student comments, and a plenty of other things. Not to mention several special events every month that take away precious prep time. Also, the director is a bit crazy/stupid. Literally the type to scold you for not doing something and then the next week scold you for doing it. I could go on for hours complaining about the director and some of the other staff. When I got here, the other foreign teachers gave me the heads up on how shitty things have gotten over the past 6 months. The problem is, there is no way in hell she will give me a letter of release. Others have tried and she makes their lives hell for even considering leaving. If you do quit, even with the required 3 months notice, she WILL NOT give a letter. The thing is, I like teaching. I like what I'm doing and feel better about myself than I have in years. So I'm looking into Japan. What is the likelihood of leaving a job here and going to Japan? Has anyone done this? What are the logistics like when skipping visas like that? Any advice would be appreciated."

japancirclejerk,3chlm4,Rickenbacker4001,30,Tue Jul 7 23:41:41 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why you wouldn't raise your kids bilingual if you could. It's probably better for their future. Maybe their language skills will be behind their peers, but that usually clears up around pubescent age."
japancirclejerk,3chlm4,notadialect,18,Wed Jul 8 01:28:50 2015 UTC,"There's a meme in Japan that bilingual kids struggle at school because they don't progress far enough, fast enough in Japanese due to splitting focus with English, and it holds back their progress.  It's bollocks and has been disproven time and again by proper studies of bilingual kids (on the contrary, bilingualism is generally really good for kids' academic and mental development), but I've heard it a good dozen times from different parents here.   That said, if you're a household that always speaks Japanese at home, raising a kid bilingual is going to be nigh-on impossible - you can't get small children to acquire language just by forcing yourself to use it around them (which makes an ass of the middle class parents, mine included, who insisted on randomly speaking bits of French or Spanish around their kids in the hope they'd magically pick it up), it has to be something that's naturally present in their environment. Foreigners who move to a new country and actually learn the language of that country pretty fluently tend to have serious trouble getting their kids to learn their mother tongue, because there's no need for it in the home environment."
japancirclejerk,3chlm4,hachihoshino,4,Wed Jul 8 01:34:33 2015 UTC,"That said, if you're a household that always speaks Japanese at home, raising a kid bilingual is going to be nigh-on impossible - you can't get small children to acquire language just by forcing yourself to use it around them   How is it possible to raise bilingual kids, then? L1 in the world around them and nothing but L2 at home or...?"
japancirclejerk,3chlm4,hanasanakattakoto,8,Wed Jul 8 03:46:20 2015 UTC,"That's usually how it works, yeah - predominantly L1 at home, and L2 at school / with friends / etc. It helps a lot to have parents who are moderately fluent in both L1 and L2, otherwise you do risk the kids' linguistic development in the ""outer world"" language being stunted early on, although most kids will catch up on it quickly afterwards. Most bilingual kids are second-generation immigrants whose families speak their native language at home, but are surrounded by the language of their adopted country outside the home."
japancirclejerk,3chlm4,hachihoshino,3,Wed Jul 8 03:50:56 2015 UTC,"Often one parent speaks their L1 and the other parent speaks their L1. So if one parent speaks English and the other Japanese and they live in Japan, the child has one parent speak primarily English, the other primarily Japanese, and Japanese would be used outside the home. So supplemental instruction needs to be used for the non-dominant language to promote literacy, but the dominant language will have formal instruction so it shouldn't be a problem."
japancirclejerk,3chlm4,notadialect,2,Wed Jul 8 03:55:51 2015 UTC,"it has to be something that's naturally present in their environment.   Mostly this is true. But, I have a seven year old private student who is highly proficiency in English only having studied with Kumon. She might be an exceptional language learner, but I think it's pretty fucking fantastic that her mom gave her that chance even though she doesn't speak English herself.  Working on turning the kid's passive knowledge into active knowledge."
japancirclejerk,3chlm4,notadialect,8,Wed Jul 8 02:05:32 2015 UTC,"Pretty much all kids are exceptional language learners - that's why language learning should start early.  I'm drawing a distinction between what you're talking about - achieving very early proficiency in a second language - and ""bilingual"" in the sense of genuinely being brought up with two languages which you speak equally. Bilingual kids don't have a ""second language"", they have two first languages. Both of these things are great in their own right, but bilingualism is the one that seems to have the biggest positive impact on academic / intellectual development (and which, perversely, is considered to be bad and worrisome by some Japanese parents)."
japancirclejerk,3chlm4,hachihoshino,3,Wed Jul 8 02:08:35 2015 UTC,I see what you are getting at. And yea... The parents probably saw it on TV by some quack Japanese child motivational speaker who graduated from Tokyo university with a degree in chemistry.
japancirclejerk,3chlm4,notadialect,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:11:37 2015 UTC,"Yep. There is that whole critical period thing. After that, any language that you learn isn't encoded in the same region as your natural language, but on the periphery of the broca's area. You can usually have more than 2 language occupy, and there seems to be a thing where overlapping grammar structures are easier to encode when learning another language down the road, when compared to native/whatever critical period language acquisition goes on.   What that'll probably translate into is the need to expend more mental resources/energy in order to access those areas for whatever ""formally"" learned language on the periphery of the broca's area then when you speak in your native tongue, where it all just comes out more or less on its own. There's that minor mental pause that you do take in order to process, or atleast I feel like that's how it is when I try to speak whatever language, but then again I'm probably just too gai. After all I was originally synthed in Germany before being Synthed in Japan.    If anything, learning a foreign language during this critical period, should have similar effects as learning an instrument as a kid, getting exercise, and also having good nutrtion centered around adequate vitamin intake, DHA/Omega 3 consumption, etc. Well all of this is important, it certainly couldn't hurt, and kids are way more capable of processing information than we give them credit for."
japancirclejerk,3chlm4,Amphetaminechan,2,Wed Jul 8 04:46:05 2015 UTC,"I love this though.  My 2 younger children speak fluent style native German.  My oldest has a much larger vocabulary but he is definitely not a natural speaker like his brother and sister.  And your right.  I still remember when my children realized that they knew 3 languages instead of one really big one.  It was also difficult to explain to people that they couldn't translate for me, it didn't work like that for a while (I think 7-8 was when they realized they could say the same thing 2 ways although listening to them pick and choose which word best fit what they were trying to say was awesome. )"
japancirclejerk,3chlm4,bulldogdiver,2,Wed Jul 8 06:09:07 2015 UTC,"Kids' brains are amazing. They're insanely rapid and flexible little information absorption and pattern recognition engines - sitting in the middle of a data-rich environment just soaking everything up, matching patterns and assigning meanings to them, so certain forms of visual stimuli are pattern-matched as ""mum"", ""dad"", ""dog"", ""cat""; certain forms of audio make up words and then sentences; and then there's the whole other layer of symbolic and abstract patterns of meaning that join everything together. It's kinda fucking crazy that you can basically take a brain that's blank and doesn't know how to do anything except identify and match patterns, and five years later you've got a tiny person with whom you can have a conversation.  I'm not a parent and I'm not sure I ever will be, but I think getting to watch and participate in that process must be pretty fucking incredible."

japancirclejerk,3chlm4,mike_cash,3,Wed Jul 8 03:22:10 2015 UTC,"Ditto for my child. She speaks English ""well"" -- much, much better than most Japanese that know it as EFL, but I wouldn't call her English native or even ESL. Her first language is Japanese, and while she can use English, she prefers not to unless she has to (like when she travels overseas or talks to her grandparents). Do I wish it was better? Yes, of course. But am I willing to sacrifice her native Japanese ability (or academic ability) to obtain it by sending her to an International School? No. And that's simply because she wants to live and work and be successful in Japan.  You can get away with speaking accented / sometimes-unnatural / imperfect English when doing international business (because speaking it as a second / foreign language for ""doing business"" is normal and accepted).  However, speaking accented / imperfect Japanese† and succeeding / getting to the top in Japan†, while it can be done (obviously), is much harder.  † Same applies to other languages other than English: Mandarin in China, Korean in ROK, Russian in Russia."

Italy, say, whom he meets in Japan and hears ""I'm Italian"" with an Italian accent and Italian passport.  Because I don't for an instant think that he wouldn't have the ""wait, what?"" moment.  All the ""gotcha!"" attempted counterexamples in the thread are conveniently people who supposedly look ""foreign"" who are presenting LOCAL ID.   And of course right there in the thread he assumes all kinds of things about the Korean-background guy and thinks that's just normal to assume that guy is an ""other."" Because Debito is a white guy from the US, despite what his current passport says.  Also for a bunch of people who whine on about how Japanese exceptionalism, they sure do engage in a lot of ""only Japan is this [bad horrible thing]"" constantly, don't they?  It's a bank. Already showing a foreign ID from a country that doesn't share a nearby border is going to get you some extra scrutiny just because any given teller has probably never seen an ID like yours before (or if so, only very rarely) and so they have a harder time determining that the ID isn't fake.  You ever try showing a foreign passport to get into a US bar? Doesn't even matter if you ""look right,"" you get extra screening just because the ID is unusual.   If someone in Japan was bitching about his ID he'd have a better complaint.   Gotta love the little side-swipes about how surely it's only Asian background people in the US and Canada who are racist and have ideas about what ""real Canadians"" and ""real Americans"" look like.

Everyday, we have to speak, think, read and write in a foreign language, may it be English, Japanese or both. While English isnt as taxing as Japanese on my brain anymore, its still using more energy than if I would speak in my native language. Also, its refreshing to be able to express yourself in a language you are very comfortable with. Also, French culture is very different than ENglish/American/Japanese one, we have different issues adapting to the realities in Japan. We tend to be more open about our feeling, express them clearly and strongly, etc. Being able to share our experience with fellow French speakers feels amazing. That, and so strange to speak English to someone whos main language is the same as yours. Think about it a second, when you meet an american person, do you speak with him/her in Japanese or in English? Yea, I thought so. English is the most common language spoken here, and it also happens to be your main language. you are lucky, but dont act up because we also speak in our main language and you dont understand.

You want to get together with other French-speakers and blather on about poutine or 30-hour working weeks for a while, fuck it, be my guest - the problem I have is with the anti-social, passive-aggressive and downright fucking rude behaviour of French people in mixed company. Somehow Germans, Italians, Spanish, Dutch, Koreans, Thai, Russians etc. all manage NOT to be shitheads about this, and I doubt any of them are any less keen to speak their mother tongue.  Incidentally, if I'm speaking to an American in mixed company where the primary language of most speakers is Japanese, we'll speak Japanese (assuming he can), because that's how communication works - you don't shift into a language that half the participants in a conversation can't understand just because it ""feels good"", you selfish miserable cunt."

To you, this is being a cunt, selfish asshole move, etc. That is fine, that is how you interpret it. Why do you think it is only French speakers that do that? Its a cultural thing, not the fact that we are asshole, but the fact that we dont see it as being rude.  In Europe, French is spoken by many people, and most countries offer French as a second or third language. French speakers in Europe are a bit like Americans in America. They are used to be one of the dominant language, and there is usually an expectation that people dont have some knowledge of the language. Also, to me, it isnt strange to hear people communicate to each other in French if its both their main language. I will be careful in the future to not make this faux pas. In Japan, if you win 100-0 in a soccer game, its rude to stop trying to be nice to the weak team. In Canada, its rude to keep trying to score more to humiliate the other team. It would be akward, and somewhat pretentious and kinda weird to me to speak to another french speaker in a different language.   According to you, only French people do that, so it might be something in the French culture, and I am sure they dont mean to be mean."
japancirclejerk,3cd49e,Toktogul,3,Tue Jul 7 03:57:21 2015 UTC,"In Europe, French is spoken by many people   So is Russian and German. And English is spoken by even more people. I know that what I'm about to say probably has little to do with the original post, but I can't help myself; It is true that French used to be a dominant language, however now English dominates. If you want to speak with another European from another country, French will be the default language only between those from countries where French is/used to be an official language. Likewise with Russian, the countries of the old Soviet union can use that with much success. And Germans can with some luck speak their own language with many people due to the pressure in some countries to learn German during/after the WWII. For everyone else, English will be used. In my country, and at least most other countries up north in Europe English is the 2nd language, and then we have the choice between French, German and Spanish as 3rd languages.  Like I said earlier, what I wrote here has little to do with the original discussion. There were just some points in your comment that compelled me to mention these things, and I have no real point to come with other than French no longer being particularily dominant in Europe any more compared to other languages."
japancirclejerk,3cd49e,Pinkspeakermusic,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:23:15 2015 UTC,"I agree totally with your point, i didnt say otherwise. The main thing though is that French people kept that mentality of superiority when it comes to language the same way Americans act in North america. While other european countries learn 2-3 languages, French people in general wont even bother to get a decent level in English. The english education is poor, the interest in learning other languages is lower than any other country in Europe. I am not saying no french are billingual, just that they are, for the most part, the most unilinguql people of europe, because they are still think they can get away with only speaking french, which is kinda true. if you travel through europe, you wont have any trouble finding people that speak french to help you out. its not the dominant language anymore, but the mentality stayed, it will change soon, it is on its way out, but nonetheless still present."

japancirclejerk,3cd49e,Serps450,2,Tue Jul 7 05:07:16 2015 UTC,"I defend them, because I feel like one of them. In North America, French Canadians are alone in a see of British decendants sea. We share a lot in common with French people, linguistically, historically and also cultualy. I prefer French movies, I love French music, I am hot tempered, I express myself like a true Frenchman, I am more socialist and less conservative than americans/English canadians, I love to flirt with woman in a very French way haha. I dont know, I dont feel like we are two different people, and in Japan, we definatly have more in common than anybody else coming from any countries  in the world, even including Belgium."

japancirclejerk,3cd49e,greenl2ght,4,Tue Jul 7 06:36:19 2015 UTC,"You just don't understand. French is absolutely unique. Not only is every single person in the Americas of British descent, but French people share a unique connection, not unlike the Borg, that no one can understand. Not countries like Australia and England that diverged more recently, nor people like two an Israeli Jew and an American Jew that have a bond some people might consider a bit tighter than just happening to speak the same language."

japancirclejerk,3cd49e,Toktogul,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:07:30 2015 UTC,What I can't understand is what makes French unique among the thousands of other languages and cultures. Or why French is somehow the only language where this happens (it's not). Or why French Canadian and French are the same culture (they're not).
japancirclejerk,3cd49e,Pennwisedom,2,Tue Jul 7 22:16:22 2015 UTC,"french culture is the only thing that unites us french canadian in quebec province. we preserved our language, our culture, and history for 400 years, against all odds. The british colonized us, they tried to force us to switch to English, we stayed strong, and kept it alive. its quiet an amazing feat, we are proud to speak french and share this amazing history with france. when i look around me, in north america, I can tell that we are closer to France and european, in many ways.

Although it is GABAergic due to its general promotion of glutamate influx, when you agonize these receptors for long enough, these receptors tend to down regulate, and with a constant cascade of glutamate, the proteins required to transform glutamate to GABA become depleted, leading towards its metabolism vis 2ndary tertiary pathways, formaldehyde etc.  Tldr, lay off the booze, if you need to booze then NAC as your pregame, drop some ibogaine, psilocybin, or ibogaine. A bdnf promoter such as semax or someshit. NMDAR antagonism can help with NMDAR induced toxicity, might want to go with memantine.  Other thwn that diet and exercise, weight liftings give you mad gains, not only for your body, but your mind. Also plenty of sleep, melatonins great for it, supplelemntation with it as you age is recommended as it tapers greatly after late 20s. Its a great anti oxidant and anti inflamm as well.

japancirclejerk,3c9lu3,JonesBlows,7,Mon Jul 6 04:15:37 2015 UTC,From OP:  So basically im leaving my house for good in 4 months. I have a serious girlfriend in Japan which is why i would like to make the transition to there. Basically i have no college degree about 70k in cash and 4 years of no firing general work experience. Im 21 and pretty much just did full time work and flipping(this actually was the majority of money as the full time work just paid most of my bills). I speak Spanish and English fluently. I figured i could probably teach English and maybe flip in japan after sometime getting settled but we don't want to get married right now due to strict traditional family culture. My question is do i have a snowball chance in hell getting hired because of my lack of education. Due to my own culture i wont be getting any help from either family but this im ok with. In short this part means i cant rely on my gf's family for employment so im going to have to rely on sponsorship and her family isnt gonna let me marry until i can show i can sustain a job and a living space here in japan. So as you can see im in a tight squeeze and its messy but shes 100% worth it and I'll do whatever it takes to do it as i have shown her family before the first time i went to japan on a dimes notice. The big reason im asking here is because i don't really know the legal details of living there and im finding up and downs of this from Google. Ill provide anymore details needed and im not looking for opinions i just need facts so i can start now. Ill be going there again when i move out for a 1 month vacation but after that's up i need to find some where to live and id rather live there with her then move back to the states. I figure I cant keep renewing my tourist visa so i cant do resale so yea.. I also thought maybe if i go really professional maybe i would get my way into teaching English but from what i read this would still require me to have an education even if the company agrees to sponsor me. This i don't know as i read you can and cant so im not sure but if i can that would be awesome. I really need help with technicalities of this but im willing to put in any effort if there is a way. Thank you and any and all help is greatly appreciated. Edit* Thanks for the help was looking for hopefully multiple ways so i could make it more flexible but i got my option! Will take down now.*

You can suck dicks. How about them apples?   The big reason im asking here is because i don't really know the legal details of living there and im finding up and downs of this from Google.   If you are too dumb to google something, you're too dumb to get a real job. Go kill yourself.   Ill be going there again when i move out for a 1 month vacation but after that's up i need to find some where to live and id rather live there with her then move back to the states.   She's probably getting railed by all colours of cock while you're doing menial work in the U.S. of A.    I figure I cant keep renewing my tourist visa so i cant do resale so yea.   What does that even MEAN??   I also thought maybe if i go really professional maybe i would get my way into teaching English but from what i read this would still require me to have an education even if the company agrees to sponsor me.   Judging by the way you write, I don't think any job involving English is a good choice for you.   I really need help with technicalities of this but im willing to put in any effort if there is a way.    Go to university; get a degree; and learn to use English correctly."

Not exactly sure how you'd have 70k in cash after either of those two..... Or maybe flipping as in purchasing something at a whole sale price and selling piecemeal for a substantially higher price to anonymous people on the internet.
japancirclejerk,3c9lu3,nazicumfarts,5,Mon Jul 6 05:15:48 2015 UTC,He can get a job holding one of those Model Room signs on street corners! I'm sure they'll sponsor him for that.

japancirclejerk,3c9lu3,bulldogdiver,10,Mon Jul 6 07:06:25 2015 UTC,"The best part is he made it ""flipping houses""  - so how many houses is he going to be able to buy for 70k?  And how is he going to sell those houses?  Because the Japanese property market is one of the least liquid that I know of, never mind that nobody wants a used house they want a new one.  And what's the #1 rule of real estate that he knows nothing about?  Oh, and I'm sure he'll say ""I'll use the 70k for a downpayment and get a mortgage for the rest"" - like how without a job, visa status, and stability?"
japancirclejerk,3c9lu3,Legal_Rampage,5,Mon Jul 6 07:38:13 2015 UTC,Pretty sure the only flipping he'd be able to do here is of the hamburger variety.

japancirclejerk,3c9lu3,chunter16,4,Mon Jul 6 14:35:33 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that's exactly what he means, so he thinks all countries have similar real estate markets and that his reselling skill will transfer anywhere. He has no idea that a country where the real estate market has been stone dead since 1990 will think of him as a weird vagabond with no real career, although it was spelled out for him in about ten comments."

The fact is, looks and personality are important to everyone and in many situations looks can win out because it's the most obvious thing right there in front of your face.

japancirclejerk,3c9hrw,pintita,6,Mon Jul 6 03:48:57 2015 UTC,"Because after 4 years of high-school Spanish they can order some enchiladas and talk with some amigos, so I mean, how different could learning Japanese be?"

On the other hand, ""Where to buy headphones in Japan"" is a really really bad question. Japan is a huge country. 1 Very few people know where Sasebo IS let alone what stores they have. All we know about Sasebo is Nevada-tan.  Next time, be specific. Try ""What's a good electronics store near Sasebo for headphones?"". You wouldn't have gotten a negative response to that one."

It's not a question of ""sharing knowledge,"" as you say, but making fun of a stupid question.  Suck it up.  By the way, do you know where I can buy shoes?  My shoes wore out years ago and I don't know what kind of store I need to go to to get some."

Travel times by car can be weeks long to get from one end of the country to another, days by train, and a full day from one end to the other by air. That's actually in the air, not counting time spent getting to and from the plane. It's also one way. In Japan, you can basically get anywhere in the country as a daytrip (or at most, like, a one night overnight trip once you factor in the return trip). That's how important the physical scale is here."

I had seen too many people overly reliant on them to the point that they couldn't interact with Japanese people without constantly halting everything so they could look up Every Fucking Word and had seen so many Japanese students with well-worn dictionaries looking up words they had looked up, highlighted, and annotated a zillion times already without retaining the info. I didn't want to fall into that shit.  Plus the one time I did go out armed with a pocket dictionary ready to take on the world it went like shit. I wanted to buy batteries, so at the shop I looked up 'battery', read off the word, and generated nothing but confusion. Turns out the dictionary was an incredible piece of shit that never should have been published. It was nothing but romaji translations with no amplifying information. It didn't distinguish between dry cell batteries, car batteries, the crime of battery, a group of artillery pieces, etc.  So I gave up on the fucking things and decided that I was not going to go through life in Japan leaning on a crutch.

Unfortunately weebs have hijacked this to try and cheat their way to 上手さ -- thinking that all it takes to achieve an enlightened status of fluency is to copy and ape methods you read about on the internet, and by becoming an even bigger socially-retarded dork than you already are...    Its like someone learning to drive by constantly playing Gran Turismo and then thinking they can become Lewis Hamilton.

Of course this hippy piece of shit has a diploma in Japanese, lived in Japan, and considered himself a pickup artist.  Some choice comments from the article:  In his profile, Cy Walsh describes himself as a cocktail bartender, originally from Geelong, with a diploma in Japanese.  He says he has lived in Australia and Japan, and visited Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam and the Amazon jungle.  He describes his “current mission” is to “prepare myself financially, spiritually and linguistically for the adventure of my life”.  He lists his interests as yoga, meditation, surfing, cross fit and learning to play guitar.  Between April and July, 2009, Cy Walsh maintained another Wordpress blog entitled “More than a Man: words may show a man’s wit but actions his meaning”.  “I am a 20 year old Australian aspiring pick-up artist with a passion for Asia, Asian girls and learning Japanese,” he wrote.  “When I’m not studying Japanese I’m with friends, building my social circle or out sarging (sic) Asian college girls in an attempt to expand that circle.”"

They ought to call it the ""wallow"" method, since all they're doing is wallowing like pigs in the figurative shit of anime/manga and eating Pocky until their mothers yell ""sooooiiiieeee!"" and drag them forth from their sty."

If anything, I'd call it common practice to do so.   Is it even legal to void an offer after it has been signed like this? Especially when the guarantor requirement was never mentioned beforehand.   Depends on what is written in the contract. The guarantor was probably never mentioned because it's so fucking obvious.   Am I right in thinking running for the hills is the best strategy at this point?   Well, since they don't give a fuck enough about you to give you a better deal, it probably means that they don't really think you're worth it, and couldn't give a fuck if you came or not.

If you show up and say ""Your Mickey Mouse laws don't apply to me, for I am CHARISMA MAN!"", they're not nearly as sympathetic.

japancirclejerk,3bkduj,bulldogdiver,2,Tue Jun 30 02:02:13 2015 UTC,It's kinda like a arcadey style flight sim MMO.

It's a grind fest if you don't pay money but you don't have to pay a cent if you don't want too.   I wouldn't recommend spending a lot of money if you decided too.

Suggest playing the arcade mode for the first 2 tiers of planes then jump into realistic. Arcade mode sucks beyond the early shit storm of biplanes turn fighting.   Once you get to Tier 3 you're hitting the 1942~ era of planes where tactics play more of a role so it's realistic mode lets you take advantage of that stuff while still keeping it arcadey.   If you download it Pm your IGN we can go flying together. Of course I only fly out in Japanese planes because I'm so fucking 内人

japancirclejerk,3bkyrj,JonesBlows,24,Tue Jun 30 03:04:26 2015 UTC,Japanese transportation is very harmonious because of Japanese concepts of honor and respect coming from the samurai and code of bushido. If you don't think it is harmonious that is because you don't have a proper Zen understanding of the importance of the rituals. I bet you don't even know you should close your eyes as you smile at your fellow travelers and occasionally mutter 'daijoubu daijoubu' to yourself. You probably even squat on the sidewalk like a foolish elementary school child and are scolded for it by people saying ウンコ座り!うんこ座り! but you do it anyway because you don't speak kanji and are a harmony destroying gaijin.

japancirclejerk,3bkyrj,Raugi,6,Tue Jun 30 05:43:43 2015 UTC,It ensures that everyone is pissed synchronically or something.
japancirclejerk,3bkyrj,Tannerleaf,9,Tue Jun 30 07:29:07 2015 UTC,"The most harmonious way to negotiate these is best demonstrated here.  Comment preserved for posterity:    In Japan, riding on the sidewalk is technically not allowed, but almost everyone rides on the sidewalks because it makes for a more harmonious system overall. Some cities are starting to build on-road bike infrastructure (bike lanes), but it's usually only along a single stretch of road (i.e. not a full network). Even when present they're not well utilized, partially because they double as a parking lane (whether that is legal or not I don't know, but it's certainly not enforced). There are also some multi-use paths where bikes are intentionally guided toward a wide sidewalk (sometimes they mark it so that bikes are on one side and pedestrians on the other, but pedestrians usually ignore this and walk on both sides, so bikes end up every which way anyway). Keep in mind that most cyclists in Japan are normal people wearing normal clothes (skirts, suits, and heels included), not wearing helmets, and riding slow, heavy shopping bicycles. Some even have ""car seats"" for kids on the handlebars and/or on the back rack. Also keep in mind that on side streets there are no sidewalks at all, so everyone ends up in the street, some of which are wide enough to allow two cars to pass, some are too narrow to even let one car through. Obviously driver speeds are very low in these cases, especially since these narrow streets are often accompanied by blind curves and intersections. The main conflicts occur on major arterials, which depending on the city can be extremely important transit routes for all modes of traffic because side streets in cities like Tokyo may only run for a few blocks before abruptly curving in a whole new direction, ending in a T, or worse, a dead-end. Besides being incredibly inefficient, you can find yourself heading in the wrong direction without even realizing it. Fortunately most travel over 1 mi in Tokyo is done via public transit, so as long as you can make your way to/from the station you're in the clear, but I tried to do some bike rides around the city just for fun (in the days before phones with built-in GPS with verbal commands) and I'd have to stop every 1/2 miles or so to pull out my phone, figure out where I was, and memorize the next half-dozen twists and turns required to go the next 1/2 mile. In Tokyo, many of the arterial streets are too crowded with vehicles and pedestrians to even think of riding your bike except during off-hours."

The wheezing, decrepit fucking husks of humanity currently in their sixties or so? No way in hell they're going to live as long as their parents did after an entire lifetime of overwork, chain-smoking and living off a diet of shit beer and fatty food.  The stats are still going to look a lot better than any country without universal healthcare etc., though."
japancirclejerk,3be1ll,bulldogdiver,15,Sun Jun 28 10:24:23 2015 UTC,"/unjerk actually there is a sizable data set that shows that growing up/living in a time of famine and scarcity drastically slows down the aging process in cells.  They essentially go into a sort of suspended animation from an aging standpoint.  That's why all the people who were growing up during the famine years at the end of the war are living so long.  Hell, Dr. Nakamatsu might be onto something."
japancirclejerk,3be1ll,mellowmonk,3,Sun Jun 28 11:37:29 2015 UTC,"the people right now setting longevity records ... were born in the late Meiji and Taisho eras.   So true. Not only did they grow up exercising more (walking and biking) and eating healthy diets, but considering when Japan industrialized, they were exposed to almost no agrochemicals and god-knows-what-else in the womb.   Another big factor is psychological/emotional: They enjoyed relatively intact family ties through their whole lives -- having the eldest son stay at home after marrying, etc.   That kind of extended-family life isn't always easy, but there's a lot less boredom and loneliness, and there's the practical benefit of having others under the same roof who will notice health problems sooner rather than later.  Finally, there are plenty of at-home and outside-the-home activities and services available to seniors in Japan. (My in-laws, now in their 80s, are availing themselves of them greatly in their rural home.)   Whereas the kind of isolated, urban lives being led by their kids make this kind of sad, early end a lot more common."

They don't even have a native word for ""privacy"" because they didn't have the concept until it was introduced by foreigners. You also have to follow the chain of command. If she's older and has been there longer, idk, maybe you gotta put up with her shit. Maybe, if you rock the boat they'll start to think everyone was getting along better before they hired me, and I'll end up homeless.

japancirclejerk,3b9j15,DouglassMacArthur,9,Sat Jun 27 02:26:26 2015 UTC,"From OP - With added line breaks for jerkability  So I guess you should know, that I'm new at this company and I'm relatively young and my coworker is older and has been here longer.  Now, this is a person I think others view as fun and I can see why. On top of that, her husband is American so I often sense that she tries to go out of her way to appeal the the non-Japanese in our company but I find her efforts superficial and I think she isn't very sensitive to our actual values.  For one example, my first day she relentlessly compared me to an American celebrity. A not particularly attractive one. Everyone she introduced me to, pointing that out was the first thing she said as well as telling them to call me by that person's name even though I asked her politely more than once not to.   And this has gone on for almost a month I let it slide but then today she grabbed a bag that I always carry with me. She said why do you have this? You're like a girl.   Then she pulled it away unzipped it and took out my prescription medications and started reading the labels out loud. She said what is this? Why do you need this? You're young.   I kind of just froze out of dumbfoundedness. I'm debating whether I want to report this to HR. If it was 2 Americans in an American company, for sure I would do so but as an American at a Japanese company, I get the feeling that it would get back to her and make things awkward and worse for me.   Should i pull her aside and talk to her privately? I'm really not sure what I should do to nip this in the bud. If we were in school or a company where I had some job security, I'm the kind of person who would just berate her until she either cried or quit but I'm trying to go with the flow of office politics.   I'm not used to being a pushover.  tl;dr Japanese lady rifled through my private things and I don't like it."

Tell her that as an extension of unconditional defeat, she has to be your geisha waifu or else you will bring her father before the Hague so he can be tried as the war criminal that he is.

The Japanese government, propping up (with oodles of taxpayer cash) a pointless industry that produces vastly, vastly more whale meat than Japan consumes, then lying about it being ""scientific research"" to justify the whole thing? Cunts.  The whalers, sailing halfway around the world to fire explosive harpoons into giant sea creatures that no fucker is even going to eat? Cunts.  Sea Shepherd, shining lasers onto the bridges of boats, doing stupid, dangerous things and then bleating like sickly lambs about how terribly victimised they are by the people whose livelihoods they're trying to disrupt in hare-brained ways?

japancirclejerk,3b1ltw,hachihoshino,11,Thu Jun 25 07:33:28 2015 UTC,"As much as I'd like to agree with you (I'd personally prefer if they didn't whale especially since they kill a number of highly endangered whales every few years like Fins - although they did get the first evidence of a Fin/Blue hybrid).  The ""scientific research"" they are carrying out is research to support the reinstatement of a commercial harvest.  Which is what the IWC was put in place to do (the moratorium was only on commercial whaling and was only supposed to be in place until the whale stocks could recover to the point where a commercial harvest was again an option).  The Japanese have been collecting this data for years and the data supports the reinstatement of a commercial hunt with reasonable quotas.  And the IWC (which has since been stacked with anti-whaling nations) continues to go against the recommendation of it's own scientific board and block the reinstatement of a commercial harvest."

Granted I'll admit I get vast majority of my news about this in Japanese but it's always surprised me that when people talk about this issue near me (in the US) people seem to have no idea that the IWC was originally all about figuring out how to reinstate commercial harvesting.  People now seem to have this idea that IWC is all about ""save the whales because they're intelligent aliens from space"" or something."

People are hard-wired to rally around symbols and treat them as validation and confirmation of their in-group status; that's why stuff like flag-burning or whatever gets people's panties wedged in their cracks, it's why bullshit racist symbols like the swastika and the Confederate flag live on decades after the movements they represent were defeated.  Take away people's symbols (not necessarily by censorship, but just by making them deeply socially unacceptable) and you make it much harder for them to display their membership of a (racist, fucked up, nasty) group, and in doing so to reinforce the bonds and confirm the ""okay-ness"" of that group for other members.  Fuck all of this applies to the Japanese Naval Ensign though. It's ancient, vastly more widely and officially used than something like a swastika or a confederate flag, and while the uyoku dickheads love it, it's not theirs, any more than the English flag belongs to the EDL."

For fuck's sake, I bet most of the posters in that thread are the kind of cocknozzles that believe temples throughout Asia that have used the swastica for thousands of years can't employ it anymore because ""Hitler ruined it"". Yeah, we should ban anything and everything, up to and including ancient culture that predates every modern nation, because it fucking makes you, a nobody who has nothing to do with fuck all, uncomfortable."

You know, despite the risks, I could almost understand someone who lives here wanting to toke up once in a while, but I really can't understand someone travelling here, presumably for a week or two, who can't go that fucking time without weed. Potheads are the worst 'cause atleast where alcoholics know they're fucking addicted, potheads get all preachy about their drug of choice and how it's not a real addiction or it's just fun, maaaaan.. Just try see if you can go a week without it (while traveling to a foreign nation with incredibly strict drug laws) and function like a normal human being."

Also, yeah, some alcoholics and smokers can't see their own addiction, but re-read my comment: they don't get preachy. Smokers never deny cigarettes cause lung cancer. Alcoholics never argue that liver cirrhosis is actually good for you. Potheads are the only people that will rush to say how positive their drug is for you.  Also, I'm a dick.

She’s adventurous, spirited and athletic.  The danshi is pretty much the same — this is the boy who’s honorable, strives to be the captain of the yakyūbu (野球部, school baseball team), who thinks there’s something dasai (ださい, tacky) and disgraceful about hanging out with girls. He’d rather die than be caught shopping with his mother, but at home he’s a good son, occasionally washing the dishes without being told 56 times. He’s fascinated by bugs and dinosaurs and thinks of becoming a konchūgakusha (昆虫学社, entomologist) and at some point during his school years, went by the nickname of hakase (博士, professor). He will go for days, even weeks, without speaking to that lovely joshi sitting several desks ahead of his, because he’s convinced that talking to her outright is “chō kakkowarui (超かっこわるい, ultra uncool).” And the Japanese male has an unshakable conviction that every danshi is his own hero. Ore, danshi dakara (俺、男子だから, I’m a danshi) has now become the self-explanatory line that excuses an unwillingness to commit to a relationship or a preferance for solitary weekend bike rides, leaving the wife and children to fend for themselves.   That is... a rather specific definition."

japancirclejerk,3azz9n,greenl2ght,3,Thu Jun 25 12:58:20 2015 UTC,"Sakurajima:       Sakurajima (Japanese: 桜島, lit. ""Cherry Island"") is an active composite volcano (stratovolcano) and a former island in Kagoshima Prefecture in Kyushu, Japan.  The lava flows of the 1914 eruption caused the former island to be connected with the Osumi Peninsula.   The volcanic activity still continues, dropping large amounts of volcanic ash on the surroundings. Earlier eruptions built the white sands highlands in the region. As of March 2014, the volcano is under a Level 3 (orange) alert by the Japan Meteorological Agency, signifying the volcano is active and should not be approached. It is currently one of three volcanoes with this status.   Sakurajima is a composite mountain. Its summit is split into three peaks, Kita-dake (northern peak), Naka-dake (central peak) and Minami-dake (southern peak) which is active now.

This is a tough one, since I can agree with both sides of the argument. On many other Japan subs, this type of language would not be acceptable (hence, his many bans). However, for this sub, I strongly value the hands-off, seemingly no rules approach.  My fear is that if some language and behavior starts to get regulated and/or banned here (however offensive and incendiary it may be), JCJ will eventually lose whatever relevance it has.  I do not condone the use of highly offensive slurs -- but that's in regards to my own language use. That being said, if other people use language I do not agree with, I can and do choose to just move on. I have enough else going on in my life that it's not worth getting trigiggered by the wharrgarbl of some dude I don't even know.  As offensive as NCF's language may sometimes be, I do not for one minute think he is a racist. I accept that his purpose is to shock, offend, and make people uncomfortable. On that front, I'd have to say, bravo, mission absolutely accomplished.  Sorry for my somewhat ambiguous answer, but, to paraphrase /u/drinktusker, I guess I don't really care that much either way."

People equate using racial slurs with being a racist. I'm not a racist. I know it makes people uncomfortable when they see someone writing words like faggot or nigger. That's why I use those words.  I'll even use the old cliche, ""I have black/gay friends"". I do. Do I use those words in front of them? Yes. I call my gay friend a faggot all the time, but he likes it. I say the word nigger in front of my black friends, but never like calling someone a nigger. But, in general conversation, yeah. Saying ""the n-word"" is just putting the word nigger in someones head anyway.  Anyway, if anyone thinks I'm actually a racist, they're fucking stupid. As stupid as niggers , hahahaha (joke).  People shouldn't be offended by fucking words. You just give them more power that way.  I am for free speech, that means even for things I don't agree with or like. If I don't want to see them, I stay away.  Anyone who thinks someone saying the word nigger is a racist is stupid and naive. Black people get away with saying it all the time. Fuck, Obama said it today. Would everyone have been so okay about it if Bush had said it? No. Why? Because he's white.   So, really the word isn't bad at all, but who says it is bad. So, it's fine when a black person says it; but bad when a white person says it. Wait a minute! Someone isn't allowed to do something because of the colour of their skin?!  Isn't that racism?"

It sounds juvenile, like a middle school kid who just discovered swearing. Anyone can string together a bunch of slurs; I find it funnier when people are subtle and well-spoken.

I get that he is a bitter alcoholic with a sad backstory of being in an abusive relationship with a psychotic Japanese woman, but this doesn't exactly make him a unique snowflake: the entire Roppongi backstreet dive industry is built on people like him. Except if I wanted to hear the rants of undersexed bitter disabused expats, I can go back to serving them whisky in a shitty Roppongi bar.  There's a fine line between jerking and being an actual homophobic racist misogynist arsehole, and he is so far beyond that line that you can barely see him on the horizon.

I think you're confusing social justice and political correctness (but that's kinda par for the course on the internet now, sadly), though. Social justice doesn't have much to say about people being rude and silly, and only gives two fucks when that crosses over into actual hate speech or provocation.   Social justice as a concept was around a century or two before aggressive ""call-out"" political correctness shit started on Twitter and will be around for centuries after we forget what Twitter was. At least I fucking hope so, because if not we're fucked as a species."

Germany has done a pretty good job of squaring away its war memory with the basic idea that ""Germany was the first country to be conquered by the Nazis"" - which is a useful way to look at history because it means you can sit the war responsibility of Germany alongside the fucking awful suffering of the German people during the war, without wrapping yourself up in knots reconciling the two things.  Japan has failed miserably at this; the situations aren't exactly the same but the essential factors (the perversion and eventual suspension of democracy by a fascist elite, the brutal suppression of dissidents within the country, and so on) are broadly similar, so you could explain history in a meaningful way by making Japanese Imperialists into the aggressors against the Japanese people as well as the rest of the world.   Except, oh fuck, /u/DouglassMacArthur let all the Japanese Imperialists out of prison so they could found the LDP, and now their grandkids run the country, and /u/AbeShinzou cries and shits himself if anyone mentions that his granddad was a brutal fucking war criminal, so fuck that idea, let's just have another committee to ""re-examine"" the historical facts and sort-of not-decide that Japan sort-of didn't do anything wrong.

japancirclejerk,3art9l,dasheea,2,Tue Jun 23 15:49:32 2015 UTC,"It's absolutely not, in the context in which it's presented. They're not saying ""the Nazis came from nowhere and made us do awful stuff""; there's no attempt to sugarcoat the populist nature of the Nazis' rise to power. It's a useful way to reconcile the victimhood of many ordinary Germans with the absolute culpability of the German state and the German people as a whole (as distinct from as individuals).  Japan really, really needs that distinction to be reinforced in its education. Way too much discussion of anything wartime in Japan ends up with a hugely over-simplified victim narrative, or with immense discomfort at taking responsibility for wartime actions because people aren't taught to separate personal culpability from state/group culpability."

japancirclejerk,3arc5r,itazurakko,2,Tue Jun 23 00:40:01 2015 UTC,Tamil is actually the root of all big musical production numbers.
japancirclejerk,3arc5r,TheMonsterIsZero,9,Tue Jun 23 03:38:13 2015 UTC,"From OP  It just makes no sense. Consider the sentence, ""John throws the ball."" The subject comes first, then we have our verb, and finally we get the direct object. It makes sense, and all the information is presented in order from most important to least important. Not only that, the verb gets conjugated thus making it agree with the subject which makes the sentence easier to understand, and we also have a definite article which provides even more clarity. Let's look at the Japanese version. Jonnwa booruo nageru. First of all Japanese utterly ignores the fact that word order exists and just uses particles or ""noun conjugations"" which is just stupid. Word order exists, so it should be used to convey information, but Japanese doesn't do this. Not only that, ""noun conjugations"" are also stupid and add unneeded complexity. Furthermore, by placing the verb at the end, you completely remove the listener's ability to construct the sentence as you go along. Instead, you have to wait all the way to the end and then you can finally start to figure it out. All in all, it's a load of cat shit. Why does Japanese have to be like this. It's just idiotic. I really want to understand this language, but it's unbelievable how much crap I'm going to go through. Are there any secrets to dealing with this? The only real reason I feel like I'm still bothering learning this language is so I can finally enjoy Japanese culture and media, but it all just seems so far away. Maybe in a year I'll finally be where I want to be. Any advice? Some inspiration would be awesome."

Whenever we were due to get new people on the ship, we would first get administrative radio messages, copies of which came to my workspace. The ship was only 532 feet long and there were only about 400 people, so you know everybody and it is guaranteed you'll run into the new people within a day or two of their arrival. Everybody has their last name on their uniforms, so verifying which new guy was my target was never a problem. I would pass the new arrival in the passageway or see him on the mess deck, and just ever-so-casually say, ""Hey, Carl"" (or whatever it was) and keep right the fuck on stepping. The look on their faces was priceless, as they tried to process just what previous school, ship, or duty station it was they knew me from. I'd keep on doing it every time I saw them.

My grandfather spent most of WW2 behind German lines and despite having a chequered career afterwards which took in some of the roughest parts of the world, he maintained to the very end that the French resistance fighters he liaised with were the toughest, most uncompromisingly brutal and downright fucking scariest bastards he'd ever known.

If I remember rightly in 1940 their offensive only went about 10km and then they camped out behind the maginot line. If they had pushed on they could have defeated germany there an then. This gave Nazi germany plenty of time. Although I guess hindsight is a wonderfull thing.  Also Im not surpirsed that the resistance were tough guys, youd have to be to volunteer for that. But they were in the minority, especially in Vichy france. I would assume polish, czech ect. all resistance would be ruthless bad motherfuckers!   edit. I remembered some more!

One affects my life monthly, the other either helps out us foreigners in the long run or lets me have a laugh when they go full Debito.  My friend who is N1 at Japanese once told me a story of going to a bar, getting the X and told ""no gaijin"". He showed them his naturalization card, said in perfect Japanese that he was not a gaijin, and still got told ""no gaijin sa-ri"" in broken English. He just laughed it off and left because he's a jolly fellow, but if it were a lesser person like me I might have had a bit of a Debito rage."
japancirclejerk,3acbo7,ObscurusXII,7,Thu Jun 18 23:53:50 2015 UTC,"It does suck, but it's a massively overblown problem. You HEAR about this stuff once in a while, and I don't think anyone thinks it's acceptable, but not being allowed in a restaurant or being allowed to take surf lessons or rent a DVD is not exactly being lynched, called racist slurs on the street or public transport, or being attacked.   It's nearly always spoiled white people who are complaining A LOT about this type of stuff, and it's because they've always been on the other side of ""racism."" It borders on disrespect to real victims of racial abuse to even complain about this kind of thing.   Again, I in no way support those businesses, and it pisses me off a lot when people say or do racist stuff cause they don't know how to act around foreigners, or don't like them, but getting all upset about it is ignoring the context and relative harmlessness of those acts when compared to the absolutely fucked up shit that goes on daily in our countries of origin.  Edit: I meant your countries of origin. I am true 内人. Glorious 日本 is my home of origin. I know because they let me rent DVDs here."
japancirclejerk,3acbo7,SoKratez,18,Fri Jun 19 00:44:33 2015 UTC,"Further unjerking/  I get that, but I think there's a lot of unnecessary ""too cool to be bothered by it"" attitudes here. The overwhelming attitude seems to be, when faced with an injustice (one, admittedly, far less serious than other places in the world, but an injustice nonetheless), the proper response is to act like nothing happened, lest you get called a Debito. I think that DVD guy jean had a right to be indignant and pissed, and I think he at least tried to make a positive change, where too many of us would do nothing or mutter bitter complaints into a pint at the local gaijin bar. Granted, the sign was a bit much.. and going to another store just makes more sense... but still. He cared and did something.  Is complaining about this type of discrimination really that overblown? The only places I actually see people complain about it is TheJapanTimes or maybe occasional venting over at /r/japanlife. Maybe my social circle is particularly well-adjusted, but I feel like here I see more gaijins complaining about gaijin who complain about racism than actual gaijin complaints about racism."
japancirclejerk,3acbo7,ObscurusXII,7,Fri Jun 19 00:15:46 2015 UTC,"Haha fair call. I can't speak to your experience, and you're right that the relativity thing doesn't mean that what happened was not unjust. There is a really weird overblown sense of ""justice"" among the gaijin community though, especially in a certain group of them. The reason I said to think contextually is not because these acts are ""less unjust"" but because in the grand scheme of things it's just such a silly thing to waste your time on. Like what is going on in this guys life that he's cool to waste a day and all the stress of the conflict over a DVD that he could easily get anywhere else? Obviously he's a pretty bored guy, or one of those weirdo justice freaks (Debito).   I'm all for improving Japan, but how about finding a cause which isn't ridiculous? People who do stuff like this are usually on the prowl for anything to get offended about (not unlike me looking for jcj posts). Debito is used cause he just provides such a useful embodiment of it. Everything is racist to him, and everything is about his race and minority status. There's no point where he steps back and goes ""maybe I'm just a piece of shit,"" or, ""actually it's just a fucking DVD that is readily available everywhere else."" In the thread someone (edit: /u/frmDaNorthSide) made a simple but brilliant point too. Why the fuck would you give this guy your money?   It obviously has nothing to do with the act, but all about BEATING this guy, and teaching him a lesson... That's not helping any cause.  Any of us who have spent time in Japan should know that what he did might work in other countries (seems a lot of commenters sucking the guys dick in the original thread aren't living here), but is not gonna change anybodies mind here. That store owner isn't going to suddenly realise the error of his ways or open rental policy to people from all walks of life. He's gonna let this really annoying guy who makes him look bad rent some DVDs, then continue on as he always has.   The guy isn't providing a public service, he's winning a personal battle. Nothing wrong with that. He was wronged and he got what he wanted. That's fine. Making it out like he did the community a service is absolute bullshit though. If anything he made that guy hate foreigners more.  Im not saying COMPLAINING about discrimination is overblown, I'm saying that the EXISTENCE of discrimination is overblown. Racism in Japan exists, but it's not that bad compared to almost any other country I can think of.  Most of us have never experienced ""racism"" in Japan, yet we all know the stories and hear about it fairly frequently through reddit and the media. That's what I meant when I said it was overblown.

japancirclejerk,3acbo7,bukkakesasuke,2,Fri Jun 19 01:56:48 2015 UTC,"Racism in Japan exists, but it's not that bad compared to almost any other country I can think of.   Really? I can't think of many first world countries where people get openly turned away for their race, especially for things like DVDs.  Yeah there's worse problems and comparisons to lynching and segregation are fucking stupid, but why should we be mad some people want to address the problem?"
japancirclejerk,3acbo7,omae_mona,5,Fri Jun 19 02:15:57 2015 UTC,"Really? I can't think of many first world countries where people get  openly turned away for their race, especially for things like DVDs.   Really?  The guy found one store with a jerky owner.  You seriously believe there are any first world countries where there is not a single racist shopkeeper who does this?  Please tell me which country has managed to develop such an amazing asshole-free culture."
japancirclejerk,3acbo7,bukkakesasuke,3,Fri Jun 19 02:20:07 2015 UTC,"I never said that. And I don't find your argument so convincing. It's not just one asshole in the sea of gloriously perfect nippon.  I've also experienced this kind of thing and other people even here have brought up that they've received the X, though they're true naijin so they just didn't care. So obviously it's not an exceedingly rare occurrence."
japancirclejerk,3acbo7,omae_mona,3,Fri Jun 19 02:39:46 2015 UTC,"There are numerous and famous psychological studies that show, for example, that people who watch a news broadcast mentioning a horrific crime will temporarily believe their country's crime rate is significantly higher than people who did not watch the news broadcast.  This psychological delusion is exactly what is happening to you, and it is one of the main delusions affecting Debito and his followers.  You frequent message boards that are specific places people come to vent about these issues. You don't frequent message boards where people talk about all the normal interactions they have had with shopkeepers, and you don't frequent equivalent message boards for foreigners in other countries.  And I'm certain you haven't done a statistical analysis  of racist shopkeeper incidents using actual data.  Your statement ""it's not an exceedingly rare occurence"" is completely unfounded and delusional.  Your statement ""I can't think of many first world countries..."" is certainly true.  I am sure it's true that you can't think of them. That is because you have not actually studied the data and you're just reacting to the big glaring post that is in front of your eyes on Reddit."

As the other guy said shit like this is incredibly rare in reality, and here easily rectifiable by going to a damn Tsutaya if you need a DVD in 2015 for some reason. Going full Debito and loudly protesting in front of some grumpy ojisan's shop with a comical sign because your feels were hurt is 100% tumblrina behaviour."
japancirclejerk,3acbo7,Washiki_Benjo,9,Fri Jun 19 07:18:30 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I agree this shit is quite rare. I just think the blasé reactions of ""meh, you weren't lynched so what's the problem?"" aren't any better. It's oddly しょうがない of everybody."
japancirclejerk,3acbo7,mike_cash,9,Fri Jun 19 07:40:57 2015 UTC,"But also, part of the problem is weebs without language skills. Everything that happens to them gets filtered through a Debimeter and quantified into micro-aggressimeters.  Honestly, if it were me (though why anyone still rents physical media at all is way beyond me), I'd have just done the Japanese solution:  ask to speak to the boss. Mellow pow wow, express understanding of his opinion, express my ""sadness/disappointment"" at his position and move on.  Problem solved and no self-serving internet, ""I wanna be a meme"" showboating.[  Maybe he (and most other weeb dorks in japan on the internet) should spend more time hitting the books and talking to real people than watching DVDs"
japancirclejerk,3acbo7,bukkakesasuke,4,Fri Jun 19 01:53:18 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on this. Maybe it's a generational thing with people who grew up in the internet and living their lives on social media.  I have many times perceived that I was being treated differently by some random stranger... most typically at a cash register for some reason...but I talk to the person, talk to the manager, or something like that, handle it with no fuss and never even mention it online. I've never had a situation that calmly talking to a manager or in very very rare cases ending up on the phone with someone at their corporate headquarters hasn't solved.  There are still minor instances taking place here, most on an individual level rather than anything condoned by management, but very few of them rise to the level of needing to go online hoping to go down in gaijin history as our version of Rosa Parks. We ain't that oppressed and speaking from the perspective of someone who has been here more than just a little while and who very early on broke out of the place Japanese society expected to find anyone like me....we've never been that oppressed. I've firsthand seen major changes in the way Japanese society perceives us and treats us and daily life here as a gaijin is a fucking walk in the park compared to what it used to be. (Buy me a beer and I'll tell you how different things were when I started driving trucks for a living here compared to how they are now). Still, even then it wasn't as bad as the whiny-assed SJW current generation seems determined to think it is now. Should individual acts of being treated differently be addressed? Certainly. Do they all call for immortalization on the internet? Fuck no."
japancirclejerk,3acbo7,Pennwisedom,3,Fri Jun 19 02:10:55 2015 UTC,Is it really rare?  In my corner of the inaka I can't enter a quarter of the bars. My black bud even less. Maybe it's rare in Tokyo or wherever you guys live.  Nothing will change if people just ridicule anyone who mentions it and lumps all complaint about it with Debito.
japancirclejerk,3acbo7,bukkakesasuke,2,Fri Jun 19 03:29:57 2015 UTC,"I think that's probably true of any country. The further away you go from major cities, the more xenophobic the population gets."
japancirclejerk,3acbo7,Pennwisedom,3,Fri Jun 19 05:28:51 2015 UTC,"Definitely, but I just can't think of any first world country where it's incredibly common to be turned away from places blatantly for your race, even in the countryside. Especially at places like DVD rental places and restaurants.  Like I said, I don't think it's a huge deal, and not comparable to segregation or lynching or anything else that shitty Debito wannabes say. But to pretend like it's not a problem either and ridicule anyone who feels like addressing it is also kind of ridiculous."
japancirclejerk,3acbo7,mike_cash,3,Fri Jun 19 02:38:17 2015 UTC,"No I can't either, I think you're right. At least here they just grumble about how the blacks / mexicans / jews / misc are ruining this country, but they still sell you a 2 liter Mtn Dew some Lays and $10 of Unleaded on Pump #4."

I didnt know about any racism in Japan until about 3 or 4 months here when I had settled into my first proper job, which involved ridiculous commuting hours and a split-shift and was also when I got my first pocket wi-fi (and discovered the gaijin pot forum). I was surprised because of how easy it all was to work here along with long periods of time doing essentially nothing, and the devil makes work for idle hands and all that.  I've got money on it being some bollocks someone made up, throw away account and all.  Does he use his real name in his usual one or something? Worried he will be banned from all DVD shops in his surrounding area?   Most of this shit is entertainment at best, possibly gossip-fodder. I reckon quite a lot of people are just a bit bored a fair amount of the time! These forums go very quiet at the weekend.

Then the mods here or the sub could have admin action taken against it.  There is a reason why other circle jerk subs have had to enforce strict np link posting policies and non interference moderation rules, and it's to protect their own survival.   For the record I like jcj, there is some acerbic gold here and some cutting insight, as well as some out and out just plain idiots as bad as the ones they criticise in their own ways, but reddit is not 4chan, and jumping into someone else's space to influence it is not the point of this site."

japancirclejerk,3a4wfy,mustainerocks,23,Wed Jun 17 06:36:17 2015 UTC,"Saw this article and considered posting it here. I really want to put this silly ""nod"" subject to sleep. First, let's talk about the author who word-vomited this ""article"" out here.   James is an experienced ALT who runs a blog and does freelance translating. He has found that fun is the driving factor in determining the success of foreigners in Japan, inside and outside the classroom.   So, this dude looks like he is in his 40s and his greatest achievement is being ""an experienced ALT"" (how does one get such a title?). The fact that he determines his own identity as a ""gaijin"" means I already don't like him, but even more difficult to tolerate is how he seems pretty set on making himself ""the cool gaijin."" The guy who obviously tries very hard to come off as having fun. The type who makes up schedules in 5-minute blocks to drinkings events (but doesn't drink). Sometimes we don't need ""fun icebreakers,"" Jimmy, we need another round of beer.  This dude's outlook seems to be, ""We should all take the time, every time we see another foreigner, to fucking stop and talk and make each other happy and fucking jerk each other off, 'cause hey, life is hard as foreigners, and if you've got to get to work or you're running late, you're just trying too hard to be Japanese. Guys who want to make sure they catch the right train or get shopping done asap: sorry, you're just a bitter gaijin. You need to have fun and say hi to complete strangers (not Japanese, though), several times a day.""  This kind of, ""Hey, just chat to randoms you bump into at the train station! It'll be fun!"" idea, for some odd reason, reminds me of cops who do anti-drug programs for kids. They try to be friendly and cool and relate-able, but it comes off as a bit cringey when you watch it as an adult. Except, while with that there's the chance now that some kids won't become crystal meth addicts, here, it's just a cringy, ""how not-Japanese are we?"" race to the bottom.   Let me buy my 7-11 bento and Asahi beer and go about my regular day without dragging me into a conversation about how convenient the convenience stores here are or some inane shit. Just say no."

The fact is if Im out, Im either going somewhere I need to go or Im on my way home. If Im in a pub thats the time to start bothering strangers, but I do like to smile at gaijin just to see if it bothers them"

I get accosted by old Japanese people way more often. Today even."
japancirclejerk,3a4wfy,NotaCuban,2,Wed Jun 17 08:50:28 2015 UTC,"I get accosted by old Japanese people way more often. Today even.   There's this middle-aged Japanese man who drinks at some kind of bottle shop/pub hybrid on my walk to the station, and he somehow knows my name. He says it, and gives me the creepiest fucking smile. He was drinking with some white guy I'd never seen before in my life, also middle-aged, so I don't think he learnt my name from him. Anyway, if you hear about a white guy being cannibalised in some old dudes bathtub in Kyushu, I guess I got famous in Japan, and all my gaijin dreams came true."

japancirclejerk,3a4wfy,mike_cash,6,Wed Jun 17 08:12:55 2015 UTC,"Pre-bubble, gaijins even in Tokyo were known to wave across major thoroughfares to other gaijins they had never even met. One could ride the Yamanote Line and many times not see so much as even one other foreigner on the train. Such was the thinness of the gaijin herd on the ground. People didn't get their asses up in the air if another gaijin nodded or spoke to them.  Then in the period between 1985-1987 (or right along there) the gaijin population jumped about 500% (coinciding with the large shift in the exchange rate) and the way  gaijins started acting toward each other changed remarkably."

I live on it and have seen a group of shougakuseis where the teacher actually let the students sit in the priority seats. It wasn't rush hour, but the teacher made no conscious effort to move them when an elderly passenger got on. When I used to have crutches, I would have to jump around and try to regain my balance every time the train swayed, but no one really ever offered their seat to me. I also once was standing by the doors with my arm in a sling and a woman ran onto the train and shoved me really hard so she could get on. I've also had a man lean on my arm during that same injury so I had to tell him to please get off my arm as it's injured. TL;DR - Japanese people are nice as a collective, but as an individual, most are selfish assholes.    Shougakuseis. Why???? Are little kids so different than old people? Trying to control a bunch of little asshole brats is tough work, let them use that area imo. This woman gets serious injuries... a lot. Wonder why...?

japancirclejerk,3a1qo9,Legal_Rampage,8,Tue Jun 16 22:11:37 2015 UTC,"Story time!  In a former life, I was an English burger flipper in rural Inaka-shi. One day, I was walking down the main street and two non-Japanese dudes on bicycles were riding towards me. These were no ordinary dudes since their bikes were mountain bikes, they were wearing slacks and dress shirts with ties, and they had on helmets. I think you know where I'm going with this.  When they came up to me, they asked if I was American. I confirmed that I was and they said they were, too (from Hawaii). We shot the shit back and forth for a while, when the inevitable question came up:  ""Have you ever heard of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints?""  Without skipping a beat, I replied, ""Oh sure, you mean Mormons.""  ""... Yes, we are also known by that name as well. Anyway, we have a church in town, so if you'd like to stop by sometime, you'd be more than welcome to!""  I then deployed my Anti-Missionary Neutralization System by saying the words, ""Sorry, I'm Catholic."" Not really a Catholic, but it works every time.  ""...Oh. I see. Well... have you found a church yet?""  Ooooo, countermeasures deployed, eh? Not a bad one, too; caught me a bit off guard. ""Uh... no, not yet, still looking around for a convenient one.""  ""Well, if you don't find one right away, you're always welcome to come to our church anytime!""  ""All right, thanks man. See you guys later!""  And off they rode... about 10 feet to their next target, an unsuspecting Japanese person behind me.  Later I found out through one of my students that what the Mormons do in Inaka-shi is offer free ""English lessons"" at their church. My student told me when he started going and he said it was all right.  A few weeks later I asked him again how those free lessons were going. He told me that he had stopped going and I asked him why. It turns out they distribute reading material to the ""students"" filled with religious propaganda and religion backstory lore. The students would read the material and then be asked questions like, ""Who can tell me what year Joseph Smith received his first revelation from the angel Moroni?""  My student got tired of that kind of shit and just stopped going. Even for free, that was too much of a price to pay!"

japancirclejerk,3a1qo9,SuperchargedJesus,10,Thu Jun 18 03:46:03 2015 UTC,"From OP:  I'm not sure what the right word is, but I belong to an independent Christian Church. No one is over us telling us what to do. My wife and I decided we wanted to be missionaries to Japan because there are so few Christians, so we moved here. I'm not sure if that answers your question? Some Christians do go door to door, but I know that a lot of people don't like that (as some of the comments here show). I plan to build relationships with people, through language school, possibly teaching English, other hobbies, etc. and invite people to study the Bible with me if they are interested.  In other words a bunch of bored housewives are going to sign uo for ""This is a pen"" and going to receive ""This is a sin"" instead."
japancirclejerk,3a1qo9,nazicumfarts,5,Tue Jun 16 15:32:07 2015 UTC,He wants to help people study the bible? Does this invalid realise that the bible was written 2000 years ago by a bunch of illiterate farmers then translated several times and reinterpreted every 20 years or so to fit into society otherwise Christianity will be sent into purgatory?   As gods only son(also in a way God himself too) I saved everyone on earth from my fathers and my own suffering by sending my only son (and myself?) in order to allow everyone to sin until pigs fly.   The only sin I do not forgive is the nearly dead old man who smells of egg sitting next to me on the train.

Or that I would ""pretend to teach people English""? I took TESOL courses and am certified in TESOL. I plan to teach real English, not the pretend kind.  I enjoy learning Japanese and think I would enjoy teaching English.   I'm not sure why you think you know me. I don't know much about you, but your post definitely sounds ""anti Christian.""*"

Why does there have to be an ""instead""? Why can't I promise to teach them English and do it well AND invite them to study the Bible sometime outside of class if they're interested?   My Japanese teacher invited our whole class to go to a concert with her one weekend. I don't think anybody felt abused. I wish I could have gone. It sounded like fun.  ""You are essentially no different from the sleaze bags that...

Looked down the belt and sure enough, there's a family eating a few tables down, and mom and dad either haven't noticed, or just give zero fucks about, the fact that their toddler daughter is standing up on her seat and leaning over the conveyor belt, and calmly and quietly stripping any fish she likes the look of off the nigiri and stuffing it in her mouth. She's having a great time. Meanwhile the staff are getting increasingly stressed by constant customer complaints about missing fish on their sushi and 申し訳ないing the fuck out of the place, and can't for the life of them pin down what the fuck is going on.

If you don't see it, replace ""Japanese"" with ""White"" and see how ridiculous it sounds.   Secondly, articles on the internet are really not a good source of information because people who don't feel the need to complain about it don't write counterpoint articles.

If you want to get specific, I shall permit the use of Jap. You must heed caution when using this term, as your locale may dictate the use of a different taxonomical name in accordance with the habitat of these indigenous peoples. If you wish to use the full name instead of the abbreviation, you should use the term Orientalis Japonica. There are also Orientalis Gookus, Orientalis Cognata Brunneis, Orientalis Vietcong, and Orientalis Chinaman.   Orientalis Chinaman has a particular truculent disposition. They are the most bellicose of the bunch, as given by their lack of critical thinking in their ill-fated adoption of Godless Soviet Communism and the T-34-85. Orientalis Japonica has made great strides as a species and is gradually learning under our tutelage, but their reliability as an ally is suspect at best.

Thomas joined the International Federation of Competitive Eating in 2003 and quickly rose to the top of the ranks, beating competitive eaters such as Ed ""Cookie"" Jarvis and Eric Booker. The 98-pound Thomas is the number four competitive eater in the United States. Her nickname ""The Black Widow"" refers to her ability to regularly defeat men four to five times her size.  While the size of her stomach is only slightly larger than normal, her skinny build is perhaps her biggest advantage, allowing her stomach to expand more readily since it is not surrounded by the ring of fat common in other heavy eaters.  She holds records in over 25 eating competitions,  and in December 2008, she set the world record for fruit-cake eaten in 10 minutes.

Don't buy someone elses idea of automotive engineering, because there is a pretty good chance they know a lot less than Honda about putting together a reliable car.

This is less a comment on weird Japan than an indictment of what has come to be considered service in the rest of the world.
japancirclejerk,39rf7w,bulldogdiver,3,Sun Jun 14 00:53:33 2015 UTC,"OPs story, I thought I'd post the original here and comment throughout the day because I'm sick in bed and there is so much jerk content.   ""Jumping on top comment to answer everyone's questions (that I can--while on commercial break--GO BLACKHAWKS!).   I decided to go to Japan spur of the moment. Just quit my job and had some time off before starting a new one. Then, the yen to dollar value was right at 122. I think in 2012 it was around 70-80. The cost of Japan now is about the cost of a midwest American city. Every meal I had (outside the Kobe meal) was about $6-10. There are obvious enclaves where you'll be sucked into the touristy areas and are paying for that. I wanted none of it on my trip.  My first day in Tokyo, I walked 15 miles. I went into back neighborhoods and tried to get lost as best I could. Japan is about the places OFF the grid. You can turn down an alley and find the most amazing places. The more we got off the grid, the better our experience. Especially in Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto. Every turn down a new street was a completely new experience. That okonomiyaki joint was a fluke. It was about 150 square feet total. The first night we had the okonomiyaki at a restaurant outside our hotel for triple the cost. All I can suggest is to get off the beaten path. Use Lonely Planet as a guide, but for only the touristy places you WANT to see. To get there, find your way. It will completely change your experience.  As far as safety, there are 3 crimes per year per 10,000 residents. That compares with St. Louis' 800+ per 10,000 residents. I would like to think that those 3 crimes/10,000 residents in Japan were executed by tourists. No one locks their bikes. $2000 bikes just sitting around. I've never felt safer in my life. Japan is wonderful.   Every restaurant in Japan has pictures and plastic models of what they offer. You aren't going to be surprised. I ate tons of sushi and variations of meats on sticks. Heart, liver, gizzard, etc... it's all simply fantastic. Your digestion will change for the better. Trust me on this. I never felt healthier, more energized, and more alive than in Japan. I think it was the amount of fresh fish I was eating. Our last night in Japan, we walked into this joint in Kyoto and, I hate saying this because it's embarrassing, but I almost cried at how amazing the food was. The sushi just melted in my mouth. Every piece was simply divine. For 3 people, it was $80--including 6 beers.  Some are curious about the Kobe pricing. I think it was about $140. 350 grams of Kobe, soup, salad, veggies. I could have gone for the 220 grams of Kobe, but it was something I'd wanted to do for over a decade. I've spent more in a night out in Chicago, so there was no point for me to skimp on an experience this important to me. I did a lot of research before I picked this restaurant. Regarding the camera, yes, it's a crappy camera, but my Canon is really large and I was trying to pack light. We got HD pics on our cell phones, but I just didn't upload those.   There are a lot of other foodie experiences that I had in Japan, but sometimes it's a little overwhelming to sit through so many food pictures at once. On a side note, Japan is an amazing culture. They cut off their borders from cheap labor, so everyone is employed. 70-80 year old men worked all the time. Some in business, some directing busses. Older people are well respected and the youth are not seen as a commodity as in the US. Older people exercise in parks every morning (remnants of WWII era?) and stay fit as much as they can. They don't seem to shun them the way we do in America. They embrace them. There is a respect within the culture that is amazing. I think America is an amazing melting pot, but when an entire culture is directed through the same morals and principles, it's a well-oiled machine. Japan has it's own economic issues, but commercialism is not the central focus, and it's refreshing.   Final note: how we don't have a rail line similar to Japan's is mindblowing. They've had it since the 1960s, and it bridges the nation. Imagine riding a rail line from Los Angeles to San Fran in just 2 hours at a cost of $40-50. Or from Chicago to NYC...   I could go on for hours about my experience, but this is a food subreddit. If you go, just try to get lost. I tried everyday to get deeper and deeper off the beaten path, and when I did, I was blown away at every turn. A truly amazing and special place."""

Older people exercise in parks every morning (remnants of WWII era?) and stay fit as much as they can.    Yes, basically anything in Japan that happens today is relatable in someway to the war.    Arigato Gozaimasu is all you need to know. It's a more formal way of saying thank you to someone who serves you or does something for you. Everyone is so nice about your not knowing Japanese.

About English menus... I'd say most of the cheap places I eat on vacation don't have English menus because it's all about buying a ticket at the door from the vending. Yes, I'm cheap. Plus those places don't care if you eat alone and read."

This is annoying cos it was said by a Korean. If she isnt especially hot shit then she has a much better chance of finding a proper career in Japan than in Korea. It is even more nepostic and competitive. More to the point it is probably an even fucking less free-thinking environment to work in.  If she thinks office workers in Korea just walk around saying whatever comes to mind then Im more Korean than she is. If she goes home, she is likely to become a housewife in a matter of 5 or 6 years, and that will be from choice over her shitty employment options.  Also, my (Korean) gf has a role in recruitment for a large firm here, and she can clearly distinguish the difference between a cultural mismatch and not being able to adapt to a professional environment.

One would be tempted to think that times might even be a changin' if more guys are holding off on relationships.  Unless it's easy for Japanese men in their 40s and up to take their pick of anything under 35 as a rule (maybe it is for all I know!).  Wouldn't it follow that things might eventually balance themselves out, and people start dating at a later age in general?

Specifically, a ring I have dubbed ""The KY Crew.""  KYC members are, more often than not, joyless cunts that cannot abide any criticism of Japan, lest her Glorious Honor be sullied. These tireless, stalwart Defenders of Nippon are quick to counter any comment critical of Japan with pointless ""whataboutisms,"" slow to understand a wide array of witticism, and, although typically highly intelligent, KYC members seem to have an all-around overly inflated sense of social competence.  Back when I started frequenting the J-boards about a year and a half ago, the climate seemed much different. Any comments that did not heap weebish praise upon Japan were generally downvoted to hell and few took any chances for expressing any opinions and annoyances counter to that.  Gradually, though, a few started to chip away at that and began to gain some support, paving the way to where we are today. Although some push the boundaries farther than I'm willing to, I respect them for saying what they want to say. There was some push back recently when Japanlife's mods changed, but that one dude got royally knocked out for trying to reestablish KYC hegemony."

Reddit's pretty clear that they're removing subs that do organised, co-ordinated harassment campaigns against people, not meta subs; all the circlejerks are intact, as are the various WhateverInAction subs, which make this sub look like knitting circle Sunday down at the vicarage.  Downside of removing /r/FatPeopleHate is that seeing it in a user's regular subs was a great signpost of someone being a complete fucking cunt. Now we've only got /r/RaisedByNarcissists and /r/KotakuInAction and /r/CoonTown and... Oh, hang on, we're not going to run out any time soon, are we?"

It's not a hugbox - I've got no problem whatsoever with subs that are genuinely just being supportive of people who have gone through some shit, ""hugbox"" or not. It's actually more like a circlejerk, full of kids who haven't got over their teenaged dislike of their parents or the early adulthood shock of realising that your folks are flawed human beings and not Disney characters, all riling each other up into increasingly antisocial and nasty responses to relatively everyday family shit.

japancirclejerk,39dbsp,xwatchmanx,0,Thu Jun 11 04:40:47 2015 UTC,"Well, first off, thanks for the civilized response. When you sort of lumped /r/raisedbynarcissists in with /r/fatpeoplehate (not saying that was intentional; that's just what it looked like to me), I feared the worst in your pending response.  That said, no offense, but how much time have you actually spent there? I've only been a part of that sub for a few months (since March, I think), and the vast majority of the threads I've seen there outline very clear and specific abusive actions from their parents. I don't see how parents threatening to kill their children, discrediting their achievements, stealing/destroying belongings and money, and of course the obvious physical beatings, etc are ""ill-defined and vague"" examples of abuse or are ""relatively everyday family shit.""  Also, what ""awful shit"" do they do to their parents and circlejerk about? 99.99% of the things they do have to do with going ""no contact"" with their parents, and that's usually after repeated warnings that they would do so if their parents wouldn't respect their personal relationship boundaries. That's not even something awful they do ""to"" their parents, it's something they do for their own quality of life. Toxic relationships should be ended, even, or maybe especially, if it's with your parents. Beyond that, the sub has rules about not advocating violence against anyone, even jokingly, and has oftentimes posted PSAs saying that ""no contact"" isn't always the way to go, and it's not cool to pressure people into doing it when they don't want to.  As for the one-sided thing... I mean, it's a subreddit about people sharing stories about their abuse. Of course you're only going to hear one side, and of course they could be lying/exaggerating about it. But you could say that about literally anything someone says regarding a conflict, especially on the internet. There are rules asking people not to discredit the abuse someone claims to have faced, but there's a reason for it: That being that many of the abused have gone their whole life having their experiences and words discredited, and the sub needing to be a safe place away from that because of how damaging and invalidating it is. And that's what I was talking about when I said that it's a hugbox (maybe I'm using the wrong terminology here).  Sorry for the long post. I imagine we'll have to agree to disagree, but I'm invested enough in the topic that I felt it was important enough to warrant the discussion.  Tl;dr I've been part of the sub for a few months and don't see what you see at all. The things they do ""to"" their parents are simply limiting/cutting contact for their own QoL, and the one-sided hugbox/circlejerk nature of it is necessary as the nature of the subject the sub deals with. And if these people's stories are to be believed, they're dealing with very real abuse.  PS: I'm afraid I have no idea what JCJ is. Please enlighten me?"

I've browsed through a couple of pages of top-ranked threads on a few occasions when a regular /r/RaisedByNarcissists poster comes and makes a fucking arse of themselves on one of the subs I actually read, and the strong impression I got was of teenagers (and adults who should know better) posting one-sided screeds about their horrible, horrible parents and airing pretty ordinary family drama in public, to a chorus of ""oh yes, they're so terrible, you should cut them out of your life etc etc"" responses and not a single moderating note of sanity.  An enormous number of those threads were pretty much full of people who fit into the old adage; if you meet one asshole in a day, that's unlucky. If you meet two assholes in a day, that's really unlucky. If everyone you meet is an asshole... Maybe the problem is you. It's telling that hardly anyone in there had problems that stopped with their parents; their WHOLE WORLD was full of assholes, and if that doesn't make you start wondering who the real asshole in the story is, I've got a bridge in Brooklyn I'd like to sell to you...

A lot of people at the games seem to be there just to be part of a group, and sing and cheer along with that group.  From observing the behaviour of the crowds at professional sports here,  I would say that the clubs owe their existence to people who love the mikoshi action in summer.  For some people, the brief summer mikoshi fun simply isn`t enough.  They want to experience that kind of group activity more often, and perhaps the only place they can go for that is to the baseball or soccer."

That being said I though OP wasn't a bad person he just wanted to help. What he meant was that if you watch Japanese tv than you already know a bunch of words without knowing them so watch anime and get them into your brain as soon as possible. As silly as it it is to hear his heart seemed to be in the right place. I don't think he deserved to get his thread reposted here.

Hell, I've been on the receiving end a couple times due to some pretty embarrassing otaku shit.   It made me realise what is fucking weird to talk about and what is unacceptable behavior. The fact that people can downvote and bully is actually one of the reason why that subreddit is one of the best forums for learning Japanese. Have you tried joining Facebook language exchange groups? No downvotes, and you get kicked if you are an asshole. Guess what, it's full of Indian fuckers who send pictures of roses and post shit like ""thnk you for cmmnt frnd, i apprecite vry mch thx. I look for japanese frnd, maybe grlfrnd or life partner?""  Is that what you want? Society, the real world, is a pretty rough place. People gotta be able to take a few hits and continue. If Apu from India wants to study Japanese and comes to /r/Learnjapanese and gets shut down and bullied due to his shit posts, then.. Great! Let's be honest, he was probably too lazy and stupid to learn the language by himself anyway if he posts stupid shit like the aforementioned quote. Then we, the serious learners, can have a place to ask questions and talk about the actual language.  Let's say I want to study Chinese and I go to the Learn Chinese subreddit and ask: ""Hurr, can't I just use my kanji knowledge and skip learning the characters?"", I will probably get laughed at, downvoted and bullied. But hey, then I learn a valuable lesson: I'm fucking wrong and I need to research my shit.  Why do some people have a hard time seeing this? If you are motivated and have the brain capacity to say: ""Oh yeah, maybe I made a stupid post"", you might actually learn something. Or you can be sad that some internet bullies made fun of you, but are you really that fucking sensitive?   Your account is probably just a big joke, considering your username and all that.. But hey, whatever. I figured that you might actually be serious."

I have minimal job experience in america as it is, a year at a restaurant, a 4 month medical office internship and a day working election polls. Would it be difficult for me to get a job assuming I took the two years to become proficient in Japanese?

I live in London at the moment.  Translation: I'm a wanker.  I'm discussing a job opportunity in Tokyo. The job itself looks good on paper, the pay is adequate by both UK and Japanese standards and would allow me to maintain the same, rather decent, life stile as in the UK, as some research into the cost of living in Tokyo shows.  I've been recruited to work at a Shane's in Tachikawa.  I have moved around in my life and changing countries doesn't scary me, neither does learning a new language.  I went to Ibiza once. And learning a new language doesn't bother me, because I never bothered to learn English in the first place.  However, I wouldn't want to be lonely in Japan (or other places for that matter) :-).  Are hookers expensive?  So, what do you think are my chances of both short and long term dating reasonably attractive girls, Japanese or otherwise?  Will the hookers stay over?  I'm a rather average looking white guy, late 30-s, work out, physically good shape, don't drink or smoke.  I'm English, so I'm pale, balding, with terrible teeth, and I'm too boring to have a beer and meet some girls in a club.

I'll occasionally point out politely that someone's smoke is going right in my face and ask them to hold the cigarette elsewhere - but ex-smokers can never leave it there, they have to go OFF and rant about how it's disgusting, tell everyone within earshot about passive smoking cancer rates, and moan about the whole incident for hours afterwards.

japancirclejerk,38tdb6,nazicumfarts,9,Sun Jun 7 02:22:48 2015 UTC,"Serious answer? The way to become a comic book artist is to submit your work to open-entry contests, countless times, until you win an assistant's slot, and then work your way up. (And once you get that assistant's job? Don't go trying to be a TV star on the side and then QUITTING because you can't hack the hours and you want to just ""do your own thing."" The industry doesn't work that way).  Odds of being able to do that without speaking regular Japanese? VERY SMALL.   The contests are advertised in microscopic ads in the comics magazines, which you need to read on the regular, and you will be competing with people all over the country. Assuming you had someone translate all of your submissions, the office is not going to want to hire you if you can't deal with the language enough for a day to day gig. If you're filling in scenery and whatnot? Maybe. But that is not going to be publishing your own stuff, and if by some miracle you got that sort job, you better start learning ASAP.  Additionally: You will need to be able to write stories that people want to read. Odds of being able to do that without speaking regular Japanese? MINISCULE. In particular, no regular people really care to read about what some foreign person thinks of Japan.   So - can a foreign person become a comic book artist? Sure, I don't see why not. But they key point is, being a foreign person is not going to be any sort of ""unique angle"" to get you into that industry. If you can't compete on regular terms with the vast masses of applicants, you won't get anywhere. Standards will not be lowered for you because you have some precious ""foreign angle"" or whatever these people are constantly fantasizing about.  This isn't unique to comics either. You want to get a ""regular job?"" Fine, become bilingual (seriously bilingual, as in you can read anything) and then go to places like the Boston Career Forum. People do this every damn day. Or hell, go visit Japan and find the want ads. People do it. But the point being, you have to compete with regular educated adults. And these people who post as if reading the newspaper is some Mt. Everest that no non-superhuman can ever do, are not going to be able to do it.  People keep wanting there to be some magical low-standards category for foreign expats to get ""regular jobs."" It's just not that way. Why should it be that way?  I do read comics. I can't draw my way out of a paper bag, however.   I suppose if I were to think of some comic that might actually get readers, with a specifically foreign angle, it would be some comic set in the US (or whatever foreign country), using regular Japanese story conventions (so it's easy to read), in regular Japanese (again, so it's easy to read) but from an informed insider point of view so the reader gets some idea of what it's like to live whatever the story is, in the US or wherever. It will not be ""wow, Japan!"" (If you want to draw THAT, the US is your market.)  Set some story in a US high school, maybe, involving a mass shooting perhaps, but with a nuanced story behind it. I'd read that if the story was nuanced enough with some good mystery too.   But then you'd need to come up with a few pages of a somewhat self-contained scene from this with a good hook, and submit it to all those countless contests. Or just write a regular story and don't have any foreign angle, just as well.  Went on way too long, I blame the beer."

It just made it all the more frustrating to read about her quitting.)  She was famous to some extent... among expats in Japan and weebs in the US. That includes the TV thing.   People too often confuse ""big name among the expat and weeb community on the English speaking internet"" for ""known in Japan"" when they are two completely different things. See also: Debito."

So, basically, there is a irrational mindset that I have concerning Japanese women and foreign men, and since I am new here I am not sure if this is the proper place to post this, (if it is not, please direct me to the right place.) but since this has to do with being in Japan and living here I thought it would be okay.  Basically, I harbor deep resentment (almost hatred) for any white man dating a Japanese women (not just white men.) What I mean is, if I see you on the street, I will give you a stare that would strip paint and start thinking about beating the crap out of you. (Of course I would never do such a thing, ever in reality)  Before, I just chalked it up to pure jealously (that I do not have a Japanese girlfriend and so I hate others that do) but it seems to have gotten worse now.  I refuse to watch ANY TV Shows/movies/Youtube series where that is depicted at all. For example, I harbor hatred towards several Jvloggers because they have Japanese wives.  I know this mindset isn't good or rational and I want to do what I can to lessen or hopefully get rid of it, but I just can't. Weirdly, this syndrome (if you can call it that) started after I arrived. Before I got here, I didn't care.  Please help. Thanks.   I've seen these kinds of dudes giving me dirty looks.

japancirclejerk,38m828,nazicumfarts,9,Fri Jun 5 03:15:52 2015 UTC,AA only helps if you're an alcoholic.  I'm a drunk.  There's a big difference.
japancirclejerk,38m828,bulldogdiver,7,Fri Jun 5 03:31:22 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Alcoholics are boring and go to meetings and shit, whereas everyone loves an affable, sodden drunk"
japancirclejerk,38m828,pintita,3,Fri Jun 5 03:59:07 2015 UTC,How can you not love an affable sodden drunk?
japancirclejerk,38m828,bulldogdiver,5,Fri Jun 5 04:39:43 2015 UTC,"There is also a weird cult like aspect about it, which makes it extra scummy because they're not just preying on idiots - like a proper cult - but people who are trying to make major changes in their life. And instead of getting serious help for whatever problems are at the root of things, they just get a wheelbarrow full of cult nonsense."
japancirclejerk,38m828,Moar-ANKO,5,Fri Jun 5 04:20:43 2015 UTC,In my wayward youth I had to attend AA for a few months to help avoid prosecution.  This is what I learned:   those people have self control problems they have invariably traded one addiction (drinking) for another (usually smoking - sometimes sex) girls who consider themselves alcoholics really like to fuck
japancirclejerk,38m828,bulldogdiver,3,Fri Jun 5 04:34:10 2015 UTC,"In regards to one and two, in my experience those people usually have serious underlying issues that contribute to the addiction. Which is why I have a particular distaste for AA. From my understanding, the organization more often than not causes the people with actual issues to implode in self judgement and guilt.   Squeaky desk chair psychology aside, well done on number 3"

japancirclejerk,38m828,nazicumfarts,2,Fri Jun 5 05:16:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, AA is considered ""faith-based,"" since you have to believe in a higher power.  A while back I worked as a probation clerk at a courthouse for all the drunk drivers trying to avoid jail time. The official term we used for that requirement was, ""sober support,"" since not all of those groups are faith-based.  Perhaps needless to say, but almost all offenders on probation are repeat customers. Business was booming!!"

Regarding your question, Japan (or Nippon) has a long varied history regarding onani (オナニ). Back in feudal days, the ritual of onani was undertaken mostly by prepubescent boys between the ages of 11-19, and sometimes as young as 9 years old.   This ritual is still very common in todays society, though has developed to become more attuned to the needs of society and often includes woman helping men, men helping men, and organized groups working together to accomplish a unified goal of ruining a womans career and life.   Hope this helped!"

If you don't mind my asking.... If we were to stage a sea to land invasion on the Jap main land, will the Japs all commit ritual suicide?

japancirclejerk,38g81j,TheLonelySamurai,4,Sat Jun 6 19:10:01 2015 UTC,"Okay, so this is a bit of an /unjerk post, but...  I'm mostly talking about the endless stream of shitty articles about Japan which try to use a half-baked understanding of samurai honour blah blah to explain stuff about modern Japan. Tons of articles about Japanese industry, economy, society etc. start out with an intro wittering about Bushido or something, and without exception they're pointless, ignorant ramblings written by some moron who's spent a couple of years here, never learned the language and spent most of their time sat in the FCCJ lounge listening to received wisdom from equally ignorant morons.  What you're talking about is actual historical study of samurai customs and culture in earlier eras, which is quite different.  But...  A lot of that - probably the vast majority of that - is total shite as well. Probably the only social group in history who have had more total bullshit written about them than the samurai are the European medieval knights... And there are big parallels for the reason WHY most of that ""popular history"" is bullshit, too. Knights were vicious warlords carving out fiefdoms however they saw fit, but their descendants in more peaceful times, who had become rulers of nations and aristocrats, needed to invent a history that made their ancestors more respectable (""because my grandfather murdered every other fucker and raped their daughters"" isn't a good answer to ""how come you're the Lord of this area and not me?"", even if it's actually true). So they took the idea of ""knightly chivalry"" which was actually just a basic, barebones and quite barbaric code of war conduct, and fluffed it up until it looked like knights had all been gentle and moral and poetic and honourable, when in truth they'd been NONE of those things.  The Bushido code is exactly the same thing for samurai - in fact, the ""fluffing"" of the bushido code into its modern version happened in the early 1900s and drew very heavily on the European fictions of knightly chivalry. The big difference is that the bushido code wasn't an attempt to make brutal warlords look more civilised; it was an attempt to make fat, lazy bureaucrats look more like warriors. One of the first things Tokugawa Ieyasu did when he took over was to ban the samurai from living in the villages they ""owned"", and force them all to come and live in the castle town of their desmene (or in Edo with their lord, for six months at a time). From then on up until the abolition of the samurai class at the Meiji Restoration, the samurai were not warriors; they did some basic martial training, sure, but their weapons and armour were all for show, and they actually spent most of their lives working as bureaucrats and civil servants in their daimyo's castle offices, in Edo or as liaisons with the merchants in Osaka. Only a handful of samurai in service to the Tokugawa actually functioned as real ""warriors""; everyone else was a fat lazy civil servant, and they mostly ended up in enormous debt to the merchants as a result of their fat, lazy lifestyles.  As for the Sengoku era, sure, they were warriors then - but like the knights of Europe, their ""moral code"" was an invention of later generations who wanted to imagine that their ancestors fought in great, honourable wars, and not horrible clusterfucks of utter brutality and viciousness, as was actually the case.  They were definitely into some properly kinky shit though, the culture of enthusiastic bumming of everything that moved (and probably some things that didn't) persisted in the samurai class right through to the Taisho era."

Ah, that explains a lot, and yeah I think you might have just given me PTSD. This seems to be a really common thing.  ""Like the honourable samurai of old...let me tell you about Japan's modern sanitation jobs!""  As for what you wrote:  Believe it or not, I actually know most of that, which makes me feel like I've been doing at least something right! :) I know we're in a post talking about ""Really True Japanese Cultural Specialist Neck_BeardyTM"", but I've actually been very interested by, I guess what you would consider ""true"" history. The shinobi come to mind, and how they've been twisted by modern culture into something they were not. I never lost track of the barbaric nature of Ancient Japan(well, pretty much any ancient culture in which warfare features prominently), and the romanticising of the samurai during peaceful times. The bushido code does play a part in how willing they were to commit homosexual acts, and it seems unique, much like ancient Greek/Roman cultures in that they actually had a creed of sorts that not only permitted, but promoted pederasty (although Japan was more lenient on older homosexual men as well, provided they followed the arbitrary social rules(in public at least) of the older person being the penetrator). That's not to say the bushido code is somehow this romantic, sprawling thing, it just ties into some cultural notions of why they were how they were, in terms of sexuality.  However...yeah, pretty much most of the people modernly thought of as ""samurais"" were, like you mentioned, pretty much just civil servants. Which probably contributes to why they had so much time to fuck absolutely everything in existence, and then make up fantastical things to write and draw about fucking other people.   and not horrible clusterfucks of utter brutality and viciousness   That pretty much sums up the Sengoku era. Extremely fascinating history, with wonderfully interesting historical figures (Date Masamune, I can't quite figure out if he was eclectic or outright had a mental disorder, some of the stunts he pulled in front of Toyotomi Hideyoshi...), but it ultimately comes down to a fractured land fighting itself over and over.  If you have any good history books to recommend (in English, my Japanese is...nonexistent at best, I'm just starting out) that you feel shows Japanese history in a more measured, true light, I'd love to get some recommendations! Right now most of my knowledge comes from directly reading the few available academic publications on ancient Japanese sexuality, and studying daimyos lives individually, along with your usual ""primer on ancient ____"" type books."

In terms of security and gender equality, the GoJ has taken adequate steps to identify and prescribe best practices in order to deal with any issue that may come to arise. Gender Equality and Sexual Harassment has been one such topic that has been extensively surveyed in the 国内安全委員会、文武科学省（ノット・ア・タイポ）,   Much in the spirit of the Reconstruction of Fukushima and any corresponding anxieties that may arise regarding the issue, we strongly urge citizens to report to their municipal city hall in order to receive resources that have been made available regarding Wellbeing and Happiness.  I have been told that The Agency on Internal Affairs and the Agency of Health, Labor, and Safety will release a poll in which constituents will be asked to vote for their favorite mascot that will eventually head the front of the policy.

This broke when I didn't do anything out of the ordinary at all. I'm not gonna fix this, it's the landlord's problem! Where is the phone??""  ...neither of these scenarios involve the tenant trying to fix it himself with some advice from Mr. Reddit-san.  I was wondering just how this is a Japan problem, but in 100% seriousness I suspect being afraid to call the landlord due to worries over language issues might be part of it. I know that many landlords worry about this from the other side when considering renting to foreign residents both in the US and Japan (and so speaking to the landlord or agent in regular English/Japanese as appropriate for the locale when you're inquiring about the place can go a long way toward smoothing those wheels)."

The name was the result of a brief brainstorming session, which started with Keith's exhorting his team to ""use their imagination"" (Fantasie in German), to which one of his salesmen, Joe Knipp, immediately retorted ""Fanta!""

I remember being N2 level. My Japanese wasn't ""alright"", it was borderline disastrous, just about allowing me to navigate through basic day to day life but utterly failing me for anything remotely complex.  Now I've got N1, I read Japanese academic papers and primary sources for my research work, chat to my supervisor in Japanese about what I'm doing, and so on; and I'm just about willing to say I'm ""alright"". I'm definitely not fluent. I have a dictionary app open on my laptop and my phone all the time; I regularly stumble into conversational topics where I suddenly realise there's a huge fucking black hole in my vocabulary. I'd cope in a job that required me to speak Japanese, but ""cope"" is a kind word and I'd be functioning way below capacity and probably seriously bothering my co-workers with my inability to communicate efficiently. I'll get there, but it'll be another couple of years at least before I hit a point where I'd be happy to say ""yeah, I could work at a fully professional level in a Japanese language environment"" - by that stage I'll be years past N1.  So I'm constantly amazed by people going ""yeah I think I'm self-assessed N2, I could totally manage in a work environment"". What the actual fuck? HOW the actual fuck?   Bet half of them would also be the first guy to roll their eyes and complain loudly if an immigrant with a sometimes-patchy grasp of English joined their American workplace, too."

You'd utterly struggle to take customer orders, understand instructions from managers, all sorts.

Still is, because he's failed the N2 twice because he feels his speaking skill makes up for his lack of mastery of anything.   His speaking strategy is to look up a word in the dictionary, mangle the pronunciation with his Yorkshire accent (which he claims is accurate) and then repeat the word at varying volumes and speeds just that word while pointing at his hand. Then he gets confused when people haven't a fucking clue what he's on about. But it's all their fault because he's got the N3 and officially お上手.  That is also how communicates with his wife and child."

japancirclejerk,38anif,Aurigarion,2,Wed Jun 3 07:56:24 2015 UTC,N1 is only equivalent to B2 in CEFR levels (B level being intermediate). Yet people treat it like the top level of fluency.
japancirclejerk,38anif,Mapariensis,2,Wed Jun 3 09:33:24 2015 UTC,"I mean, I have N1 and a job that requires me to communicate entirely in Japanese, but I sure as hell wouldn't call myself fluent even now (I took the test like 2.5 years ago(?). I also mostly took it because I'm weird and like standardized tests.).  The problem is that a lot of Japanese learners are self-taught, so they're extra susceptible to the Dunning-Kruger effect because they have no frame of reference. Also there's somehow this idea that each of the N-levels is evenly spaced, so if you're at N3 you're halfway between N5 and N1...whatever the hell that works out to. You wind up with people saying things like ""I know all my hiriganas and I've got like 80% of my kataganas, but I've learned at least 1000 kanjis in anki so that's like halfway there. (5 + 1) / 2 = 3, so I'm N3."""
japancirclejerk,38anif,pintita,3,Wed Jun 3 07:05:22 2015 UTC,"The problem is that a lot of Japanese learners are self-taught   THIS. This also means that, when they speak Japanese, it's with a tutor or conversation partner they regularly meet with, and when they watch Japanese media, it's a program they've chosen that they're already familiar with (cough anime cough). Watching a children's cartoon with a familiar plot and getting the gist of it is entirely different from, say, listening to a political discussion and understanding the main arguments, but Japanese learners will do the former and say, ""Yeah, I can pretty much understand spoken Japanese.""  They end up understanding everything in an environment of their own creation."
japancirclejerk,38anif,hanasanakattakoto,2,Wed Jun 3 08:11:31 2015 UTC,"Add to that the fact that many Japanese learners are generally intelligent and used to picking things up quickly, and you get people who skim through Genki, don't immediately run into any ""wtf does this mean"" moments, and assume that because they understood the text of the book they also understand the content of the book.  And then there's the standard e-peen measuring, too: ""I know 15,000 kangi."" ""I learned hiriganna in 45 minutes."" ""I'm pretty much fluent because I memorized the little list of fish placard at my local o-sushi restaurant. (I tried talking to the owner in Japanese, but he didn't understand me; I must have been too ojouzu for him.)""  Learning something requires the humility to admit that there's stuff you don't know. If you can't manage that, you'll just show up to the race and immediately congratulate yourself for running a marathon."
japancirclejerk,38anif,hanyonkyu,1 point,Wed Jun 3 08:22:46 2015 UTC,"My situation is kinda similar. Have N1, still got a helluva long way to go.  There's also a guy in that thread who claims that getting N1 somehow made him qualified for a translation job. I obviously can't judge whether he actually is or isn't, but that really doesn't follow.  N1 certifies you as ""able to understand Japanese in a variety of circumstances"". That's it. You can literally ace the test on ""passive"" ability alone. N1 is absolutely worthless for assessing speaking/writing ability, i.e. actual proficiency.  It's kind of like a black belt in martial arts: ""Congratulations, you're past the beginner stage. Now get to work."""

japancirclejerk,386m1j,ObscurusXII,4,Wed Jun 3 04:33:13 2015 UTC,"I’ve done quite a bit of writing on Japanese culture as my major is History with a minor in Cultural Anthropology and a concentration in the field of East Asian studies. Japan constantly mesmerizes me in the way in which it melds the modern and the archaic. It is a land that is constantly changing and adapting, but unlike so many other societies it, for the most part, doesn’t release it’s grasp on it’s history and it’s culture. When you think of Japan you usually get one of two images; of either the ultra modern cities like Tokyo with it’s bright lights, video arcades, otaku, and businessmen, or you think of the Shrines that dot the land and the age old tradition of the tea ceremony. The two don’t exist separately in Japanese society though, they exist side by side and often within one another. That’s one of the things that truly amazes me about Japanese culture. It’s reverence for history and it’s continued practice of the culture of the past. I feel like this video captures that essence nicely by juxtaposing the elements of Japanese society that make up these two distinct views of Japan and melding them together. The imagery, tone, and accompanies verse also has a ton to say as well that I won’t even go into about the nature of the society of which it is capturing.   What a pretentious fucking wanker."

Post holiday blues- wanting to be back in Japan Accidentally saying hai and nodding your head when someone asks you something Coffee boss, milky tea, green tea and pocky cravings. Knowing the difference between Chinese and Japanese restaurants just from the look of them. Wanting to correct people with how they say the cities. Wanting to ride your bike to work Getting nostalgic every time you see a convince store, but hen being sad because it's expensive and only for petrol Seeing cheap Narita flights Getting excited every time you speak to another Japanese person.

japancirclejerk,37y15n,SoKratez,11,Mon Jun 1 00:17:44 2015 UTC,"Original comment:   As for eating out, the great majority of traditional meals are served with all the food separated (i know there's a word for this style...)... plate with fish and veggies, miso soup, bowl of plain rice, saucer of pickles, etc. In other words, it's easy to just... not eat that rice. Personally I'm sick of eating rice everyday for school lunch (I'm an ALT) and I don't even bother ordering this type of ""setto"" meal. If you're feeling too wasteful then just tell them to hold the rice. I also order ramen with no noodles. This sounds crazy, blasphemous, but it's the best damn vegetable soup I've ever had. (Skipping out on the noodles isn't a health concern... they just don't do anything for me.) I'm also on a low-carb diet, though I'm not too strict about it. Unfortunately Japanese cuisine culture is entirely situated on what main carb you're eating (rice, bread, pasta, noodles, etc.), whereas Western cuisine is centered around the main meat or protein. So it's difficult to eat out without requesting a few adjustments. You can also try cooking ""yakisoba""... without the noodles. Which basically amounts to stir-fried meat and veggies, but these are generally accessible and cheap. I do this 3-4x a week. It's all about mixing it up with what sauces you use. Those sweeteners are definitely available. This is just me, but I find it better to indulge in the real thing, with moderation. Watch out for alcohol. I dunno about student life in Japan, but it can sometimes be hard to refuse more beer, for many reasons."

japancirclejerk,37wu4f,carasson,10,Sun May 31 01:43:50 2015 UTC,"Actually, a major aspect of Japanese culture is fatalism. We like to sit here on Reddit and talk about how calm and orderly they are in an earthquake, but a big part of that is that Japanese culture teaches people to quietly take any hardship in silence - from bullying, to illegal treatment from employers, to dying in an earthquake. Who cares, there's nothing you can do about it. Accept it silently.  And go ahead and call that ""ethnocentric,"" but I do live in Japan, and I can absolutely assure you that the culturally conditioned response to hardship and complaint is, ""Well, there's nothing I can do about that.""  Not to be a dick. Not to be ethnocentric. But cultures have two sides to their coins. On the one hand, yes, Japanese people are calm and orderly, nonviolent and nonconfrontational - they are well-organized and don't complain. That's great, and it makes them strong. When Japanese people put their mind to something, very little can stop them accomplishing it.  But they are all of these things at a cost - they are not particularly passionate, they strive for growth but not change, they don't always care about the people around them, and they are happy to let the people commit all kinds of petty crimes without reporting or confronting them.  One thing about all those crowds of calm, orderly people you see - one reason for that is, when Japanese people do commit crimes, people don't report them and they don't confront the criminal in question. That's a big part of the order - there's tons of petty crime happening in Japan all the time. It's constant and blatant and unrepentant. Running red lights, illegal gambling, gropers on trains, sexual harassment, labor law violations. Japan is just plain rife with crime, and yet it is a nonviolent, calm, orderly society. Why? Because Japanese people are happy to let criminals commit crimes. They don't confront them, they don't start fights, they don't call the cops.  A groper on a train in Tokyo won't cause a scene. The woman will stand there, silently, accepting it. The people watching will look the other way. In New York? A man gropes a woman, she starts a fight, she slaps him. The people on the train shout at him. We look at that and say, ""Oh, Americans are so violent. Americans are so unruly. Japanese people are so peaceful and calm.""  That's not ""ethnocentrism."" That's a pros and cons list. America: people look out for each other; the result is an unruly society willing to commit violence, often to protect other people. Japan: people look the other way when petty crimes occur in order to maintain a peaceful and calm society, unwilling to commit violence even in self defense. Can we honestly say if one is better than the other? Can we not honestly and openly say, ""Hey, I personally prefer a society where people are willing to fight for strangers' safety""? Is that ethnocentric, or is that just weighing your options?  As an immigrant in Japan, there are days where Japan doesn't work for me, and I want to go home. I'm tired of living in a country where traffic laws have no meaning. I'm tired of being surrounded by constant, blatant crime. Japan is wearying if you live there. Peace, calm, order - none of that is free.  The irony here is - it's more racist and more ethnocentric to sit there and pretend that the Japanese don't have problems in their society. There is no such thing as a superior culture. Fetishizing a culture is no better than demonizing it."

Hokkaido: With the Crusader out of the country, police had to take up his slack and in 2014 received 378,000 calls.

First see what you want to try and then search for restaurants in the area. When youre abroad you should always plan what you eat well in advance. its probably better to not know any Japanese when you come here than 5/6 phrases. You wont understand a fucking thing anyone says to you. if youre on a tight budget, dont be so precious about where you take a shit. Just get on with it. Youre on holiday, having a nice spacious shit shouldnt be priority. Try having a cheap holiday in Europe and then get back to me on how the hotel here was. might be beyond help with the girls to be honest. Ive never, never met a girl anywhere just walking around on the streets except for the bordeline or actually mentally ill, or girls who were trying to rob me eg- on Las Ramblas in Barcelona. Ive had some success with locals abroad before though and it always came down to   A) consuming alcohol or some kind of mind-alterer that facilitated it (eg coffee or absinthe).   B) Acting like a prick walking around talkig to everyone and dancing stupidly  C) Not being even slightly picky  D) going to THE cheesiest and sleaziest bars and clubs until very late.  It is my firm belief that no one has ever really met a sex partner just walking down the street   ps - nothing wrong with hotto motto"

How well is it accepted in other countries? Why is it looked down on?  What are your opinions on people who actually want to teach English abroad and aren't doing it with some ulterior motives?  I'm asking these questions because I'm soon to be entering college and I'm interested in teaching abroad as a means of experiencing new cultures and travelling, as I have a passion for the English language and travelling so it seemed like a great career path (Does that count as a scummy ulterior motive?) to combine the two.

Do you? People will take what they can in the end. Im a bit qualified and have 8 years or so experience and I try, but in the end Im not sure how much extra this gives my students as I dont have my hands on the curriculums and the means to make a difference. One thing that bites quite hard is that unless you have the skills and the actuality of producing the courses and overseeing everything in your classes, you dont make such a difference as the next man.   Another point is, the stigma is not just about these teachers but the racism in general around the world. Once you get started teaching English you will see. English represents multi-culturalism and ethnic diversity, and you will be amazed at how many people oppose this. Ive seen it in Europe, Ive seen it in Korea, Japan, China and the UK. That we can move to any country and teach represents the sway of multiculturalism and Japan in particular is not so on board. That is not right or wrong, it is just the connotations that English has now as a language.   Not everyone wants a multicultural world, and if you teach English abroad you will be in the middle of this battle."

There is some hate around the net but not that much in real life. Most people I interact with want to learn so they appreciate the help.   For a career, I think Japan isnt the best place to start. The attitude towards English can be very narrow so you might find it hard to find opportunities to experiment and develop. Most of what you teach is decided by someone else so you wont be getting the proper room to develop. This is contrast to Europe or even many places in Korea where they will let you do your own thing  I''d try it out before taking it ass a full-on career path. Getting your state qualification might be better, because you can work at home and abroad.  There  are a lot of International Schools around that you could work in and get paid well in. Furthermore,  if you have your state teaching qualification then it is very easy to transition into ESL if you want because the barriers for entry are extremely low."

Wine peaks in quality somewhere around the ¥2000 to ¥4000 range; after that it costs many, many thousands of yen to get a tiny, fractional increase in quality. For whiskey it's a range between ¥10,000 and ¥20,000, near the bottom of that range more often than not; although if you're going to mix drinks with it (instead of drinking it neat or on ice), ¥5000 to ¥8000 is more like it.

When you hear ""language"" sounds that you can't identify, you tend to default to attempting to interpret them in your native language.  For a fun experiment, try going to a place with a lot of foreigners and listening to people who are a bit too far away to hear. They'll probably sound like they're speaking English and you could understand if you were closer, but when you get closer they're actually speaking Russian or something."

I don't believe in any god, but unless someone directly asks me about religious beliefs, why the hell would I bring that up in conversation? ""Check me out, I'm so cool and nonconformist!

japancirclejerk,3764iy,XiamenGuy,12,Mon May 25 23:44:40 2015 UTC,Was there any indication she was going to be such a psycho? How long did you date before marriage?
japancirclejerk,3764iy,Gekusu,13,Mon May 25 05:33:18 2015 UTC,"For about a year and a half when she was in England. She was normal then. She said that if we were going to get married, we'd have to live in Japan. So I ended up here."
japancirclejerk,3764iy,Gekusu,7,Mon May 25 05:45:20 2015 UTC,So when did she start showing the craziness? Was it little by little or did a floodgate open up?
japancirclejerk,3764iy,bulldogdiver,44,Mon May 25 05:48:14 2015 UTC,"After about 3 months of marriage. I didn't speak a word of Japanese, and she just said to me one day ""why do I have to speak English? This is Japan"" and never spoke a word of English to me again.  That was probably one of the only good things she did for me. Because after another 6 months of arguing with her almost every day, my Japanese was near fluent."

japancirclejerk,3764iy,Vampyrebyte,6,Mon May 25 23:45:55 2015 UTC,I dated a girl for a few months that was something - fuck if I know what.  I did find out that long island iced teas will counteract the mood stabilizing effects of lithium and that it's probably not a good idea to stay with a girl who can knock back 4-5 of them in an hour at 120lbs and still be perfectly functional.  That one ended when she broke up with me then put a brick through the back window of my car when I didn't try to get back with her (and that was before I started dating her lab partner).
japancirclejerk,3764iy,Diamond_Sutra,5,Mon May 25 22:10:48 2015 UTC,"lol.  My ex-wife decided that while I was driving 75/mph down the interstate in the middle of a very busy city it was an awesome time to  attempt to beat the shit out of me.  She came over the seat doing that one, and it's the one time I just about hit a woman full-force to knock her out.  Yeah, drinking and mood stabilizers (and throw in some recreational drugs like cocaine) don't really fucking mix."

I wasn't singled out until now, but this behavior is absurd, childish and over the line.

Do you not see anything wrong with that behavior?  There are tons of complaints about you, but I'm sure instead of own up to any of them, you're going to point out something you didn't do.

I majored in Japanese and while there were some shocking weebs there, they were in the minority and dropped out early. (Thinking back, I reckon the university structured the courses to filter them somewhat; the language classes started out VERY fast and intensive, there were compulsory classes on ancient history, linguistics and classical literature; all the classes touching in any way on pop culture were in the last year of the course, when students could work with untranslated sources and any weebs were long gone.)  Most people who stuck to the course seemed to have a strong interest in Japan based on some personal connection, a specific hobby (not just a pop culture interest) that they were working on turning into a career, or a genuine academic interest. It was a good group of people with diverse interests (and actual social interaction skills) - a few years on I still meet up with a fair few of them for beers on a regular basis in Tokyo, and others each time I go back to London.  Having said that, that's one university - no idea what the Japanese courses at others are like, and god knows I've seen enough horror stories online."

japancirclejerk,36mme1,kappanjoe,1 point,Wed May 20 16:37:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah - to be honest, I'm automatically suspicious of a language programme that doesn't have a year abroad as a requirement for everyone. Ours sent everyone to Japan for their third year; I believe all our other language degrees also had in-country study requirements. Even after weeding out the weebs early on, there were still a handful of people who finished their year in Japan and came back essentially going ""yeah, that's quite enough of that for me thanks"" - but I didn't get the impression any of them were culture shocked because Japan wasn't like a manga or whatever, rather that they just decided it wasn't somewhere they wanted to live, which is fair enough. All of those guys seem to be doing fine in various jobs / post-grad positions around Europe now.  I think a lot of schools dodge the ""writing in Japanese"" aspect, which is a huge shame. I actually hated the amount of writing we had to do - two years having to do hand-writing drills for the first thousand kanji, mandatory composition classes, etc. - but damned if it hasn't been insanely useful since then. Even little things like all our language teachers insisting that we write in Japanese and use proper keigo when emailing them from second year onwards, which seemed hugely annoying at the time, has turned out to be very useful later on.  In general, it probably helps a lot that in the UK (and Europe at large) university is not remotely as expensive as in the USA; in some European countries it's free, in others (like the UK) it's relatively cheap and funded through a pretty generous system of student loans and grants. Dropping out still sucks, but doesn't ever risk leaving you saddled with large debts you can't afford. Plus, a lot of good universities will let you drop ""sideways"" instead of out; at ours, people who couldn't hack the BA Japanese course tended to drop into a much less rigorous Japanese Studies course which was only three years long, didn't send people on a year abroad and only covered a fraction of the language classes done in BA Japanese.  I don't know anyone who actually graduated in my year and regrets their choice (I'd imagine there's plenty of regret among those who dropped) - plenty would criticise some of the structure or material of the course, but doing it overall seems to have been pretty rewarding, even for the people who ended up working in totally unrelated fields."

Taking out 15k to go abroad for a year and study Japanese with a bunch of other Americans seems like a horrible idea to me.   Yeah, I have no idea how this would work financially for US universities (I'm still consistently amazed that US university works on a financial level for anyone at the best of times, though). For us, the year abroad was actually cheaper for most students than a normal school year; you only had to pay half fees (which are low to begin with) to the UK university, all fees in Japan were waived by the exchange agreement, and accommodation and living costs in a university dorm in Japan are far cheaper than accommodation and living costs in central London.  The financial aspect might explain why we had so few Americans on my study abroad year, I guess. The American students were outnumbered by the Brits alone, let alone the other Europeans - with all the westerners combined being dwarfed by the number of Koreans and Chinese. Made for a good learning environment actually, there were a ton of people there who didn't speak English and therefore the common language for people who wanted to socialise with a reasonably broad group (even among the other exchange students) was Japanese."

I think this actually applies to a lot of majors. I'm a photography major and when we did our 101 course, the first class was all about the different modes on a camera, but starting with the second class shit got serious and you had to hit your mark on a weekly basis. Even missing one little instruction in your shots would fuck you over. It wasn't too bad, but the teacher was stern about it and all of the ""uncle bob's"" immediately dropped the course after the second class. I've only seen 4 people from that class show up in any of my later courses, and I'm convinced they were the only ones who didn't switch majors. At the end of the day I guess it's to help decide or show who is actually serious about the major they chose and who is still trying to get their act together."
japancirclejerk,36mme1,Wazard,1 point,Thu May 21 04:11:48 2015 UTC,Why would you major in Japanese rather than a major more relevant to your future career?
japancirclejerk,36mme1,neyev,5,Fri May 22 04:25:59 2015 UTC,"Me personally, or people in general?  For me, I was entering university in my late twenties with a perfectly good career already up and running; I wanted to take a few years out of it to get a degree and experience university while I was still young enough to enjoy it. (As it happened, I ended up changing direction in life somewhat based on that experience, but the point is that I wasn't doing the degree for career reasons.)  For others, well, in the UK at least, unless you're in a STEM field or planning a specific career that requires university-related professional qualifications, the subject of your degree is vastly less important than the quality of the institution you attended and the grade you achieved. A four-year degree from a good institution says ""I spent four years focused on something, did well and developed a good basic set of analytic and presentation skills"" - whether the subject involved was Japanese, anthropology, politics, geography or anything else barely matters to employers. If anything, a BA with a strong focus on a modern language is a plus because it gives you an extra marketable skill over and above your basic four-year degree.   Very few people who study a BA end up working in a field related to that BA; so there's absolutely no harm studying something that you're interested and engaged with, and you'll probably get better grades as a consequence."

In terms of getting a job, I get that you have flexibility regardless of degree, but surely you would be more competitive if your major is directly relevant to the jobs you are applying for."
japancirclejerk,36mme1,neyev,2,Wed May 20 19:33:47 2015 UTC,"I think you're misunderstanding the nature of the majority of jobs, which don't require specialist knowledge from third-level education, but do require some of the skills acquired on a general good-quality degree.   You're possibly also misunderstanding university education, to some extent. There's an enormous mistake a lot of students make, where they graduate and think ""I just learned so much about (geography / history / literature / politics)"" - which completely ignores the fact that an undergraduate degree doesn't really teach you much at all about the subject involved; it gives you a broad basic knowledge, at best. What it's designed to teach you are the skills you need to research, analyse, formulate arguments and present them in written and spoken form. The subject is just something to hold your interest while you learn and apply those skills; if the course does its job, you should come out at the end with a host of skills that can be applied to any subject or job, not just a brain full of knowledge about Geography that is rendered instantly useless if you get a job unrelated to Geography.  This is a big part of the reason why university professors despair so much at governments and students pushing them to be more ""vocational"" - they understand that if they actually changed undergraduate degrees to be more like job training, they'd be short-changing their students by swapping the very general, broadly applicable skills you learn at university now for a much narrower set of skills that will totally fail you if you don't get a job in your specific field.  Ugh, I'm unjerking way too much in this thread. Though it probably says something that we're having a better discussion of this in JCJ than I've ever seen in /r/Japan."

Most of the kids in my classes were either Chinese exchange students, Korean exchange students, or heritage speakers. I think my last language-skills oriented class had two white people, and both of us had lived in Japan for extended amounts of time.   I guess most of us were just serious students by then? I think I could count the students who drank at all in there on like one hand. Even the ones who did drink kept it under control with one exception.    Also, in most programs it's like 80% culture/history/politics/economy and 20% language so basically you will still need subtitles to watch your favorite anime after you graduate.

Did my degree there; first year was full of weebs who had dropped out by Christmas. By the end of fourth year we were down by about 60% and pretty much all those who graduated were pretty solid (both in terms of personality, and at the language).  Every September there'd be a new influx of morons wearing cat ears and Naruto headbands to lectures, though. SOAS makes you pass two years of intensive Japanese before they'll let you take a year abroad there, which is actually kinda great (you can dive in and communicate pretty well which puts you way out in front of most people studying abroad), but I'm willing to bet that half the reason is that this way they get to force the awful weebs to drop out long before they have a chance to get to Japan and embarrass the school."

""well during my last btec foundation, I only ever wrote one essay, and I am trying to study something to get away from art and hopefully send mylife in a more meaningfull direction.""  anyway it clearly wasnt going anywhere, I applied again for a BTEC at a shity local ghetto colledge and showed up two weeks late for my BTEC interview, and the person was like ""oh I read that your applying for a BTEC to study japanese, we would prefer to have students who are motivated to excel in the world of arts.""

I got invited for an admissions interview with one of the senior professors which ended up being a very informal and pretty interesting conversation about Japanese literature, got a letter in the post the following week making a formal offer of a place from the following September. I guess they liked the work history on my CV enough to waive the qualifications requirements, or something.  Bloody glad they didn't want me to run off and get a GCSE in Japanese or something daft like that first. I mean, their Japanese BA starts from teaching the hiragana and katakana (admittedly giving you two days to learn each set, which I recall each time someone on LearnJapanese posts ""I've been studying Japanese for three months and I know almost all the hiragana, what should I learn next?""), so wtf would the point of doing pre-study be?"

Too many people think learning Japanese is memorizing words and kanji one after another, when in reality you'll need to sit down, figure out why particles work the way they do, how to put a sentence together, etc. You need to be able to make sentences on the fly, and the best way to learn that is to talk to Japanese people. Actually talk."
japancirclejerk,36gfa9,ass_fungus,1 point,Tue May 19 17:52:02 2015 UTC,"Haha, that makes sense. Do you have any resources you trust especially?   I utilize Tae Kim's guide, but I usually get lazy after a week and let it fall to the wayside. You're right and I have to bite the bullet."
japancirclejerk,36gfa9,meikyoushisui,3,Tue May 19 17:54:55 2015 UTC,"Do you have any resources you trust especially?   Nope. Consistency is the most important, regardless of resources."

japancirclejerk,36gfa9,Aurigarion,2,Wed May 20 10:16:31 2015 UTC,"We generally recommend the Genki textbook series over at /r/LearnJapanese. Anki is designed to help you retain information you already learned; textbooks are designed to teach you new information and give you ways to practice using it. Anki's a good tool, but you're trying to hammer a nail using a wrench: you can probably do it eventually, but it'll take forever, you'll hate the process, and you'll probably mess up the nail anyway."

I mean, I guess having some idea of how many words you know can help you figure out which textbook to study from next, but I doubt this could be accurately measured, or that there'd be a tangible difference in 1500 words vs. 1600 words. IMHO it's just a way beginners can keep themselves motivated rather than any meaningful metric."
japancirclejerk,36gfa9,Antacid258,2,Tue May 19 08:28:31 2015 UTC,"Well if all you've done is study in Genki workbooks and have zero contact with culture or real people, the book's index probably has a count."

Turns out he didn't just quit the hike, he went back to America as well.

Tokyo is just, Tokyo, Shinjuku is not a suburb. And kill your family, when his living next to the man of madness would bury them in the backyard, suburbs is like the United States. No, so instead of Tokyo, it is foolish foreigner! :)  Do you know the Tokyo Metropolitan Government? It is in Shinjuku."
japancirclejerk,36cmqb,mashupXXL,3,Tue May 19 02:58:56 2015 UTC,Tokyo is so scary. So many guyjeans and crimes. I am happy to live in the real Japan with tatami and wabisabi.
japancirclejerk,36cmqb,itazurakko,2,Tue May 19 03:40:03 2015 UTC,Whatever that is it sounds adorable.
japancirclejerk,36cmqb,banjjak313,5,Wed May 20 10:32:59 2015 UTC,"Is there really a think as hotel curfews?   There are at youth hostels and some similar ""backpacker"" type places (often they'll kick you out during the middle of the day, too).  From the post he doesn't seem like the usual youth hostel patron, on the other hand some people go there for the cheap, cheap, cheap accommodations (and drink like fish and get rowdy) so who knows.  (I see someone mentioned Taito-ku, yep.)"
japancirclejerk,36cmqb,iago185,3,Mon May 18 13:52:42 2015 UTC,"I've stayed in a cheap-ass dorm-style hotel in Minami-senjuu that had a curfew. Also the owners wife would hold a ""hula party"" in the lobby on wednesdays where she danced hula.  Minami-senjuu."
japancirclejerk,36cmqb,Legal_Rampage,5,Mon May 18 14:08:47 2015 UTC,That whole area is shady. It literally seems to exist for people like me who are too broke for real lodging and drunken old men. Everyone there was 65+ and drunk or a tourist from rapeLandgaikoku-ville.
japancirclejerk,36cmqb,fotoford,3,Mon May 18 16:31:42 2015 UTC,Also I hear it's all run by Koreans
japancirclejerk,36cmqb,nazicumfarts,2,Mon May 18 16:47:50 2015 UTC,It literally seems to exist for people like me who are too broke for real lodging and drunken old men   Really? Exactly how much do drunken old men cost?
japancirclejerk,36cmqb,GeorgeForemanGrillz,2,Mon May 18 16:45:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly how much do drunken old men cost?   If you have to ask, you can't afford them."
japancirclejerk,36cmqb,ForeverAclone95,2,Tue May 19 03:03:10 2015 UTC,"First time I came to Japan, I stayed in a hostel that locked its front door and closed the front desk at midnight.  You could still get in through a side door with a touchpad code.  I'm starting to think OP is so dim, he wouldn't be able to remember such a complex entry procedure."
japancirclejerk,36cmqb,44815425,1 point,Mon May 18 14:15:09 2015 UTC,Big hotels usually have a curfew so to speak of no visitors after 0 or 1am.  Smaller shitty ones probably have one where even guests have to be in before a certain time.

japancirclejerk,36cmqb,neyev,6,Mon May 18 21:31:08 2015 UTC,Many mangas depict of this happening to the main character of it.
japancirclejerk,36cmqb,nazicumfarts,5,Mon May 18 17:28:34 2015 UTC,That's why I love the mangas.  They teach me the beautiful culture of Japan.

japancirclejerk,36cmqb,bulldogdiver,7,Mon May 18 10:59:07 2015 UTC,You should work on your endurance. It usually takes me at least 4 strokes until I finish.

japancirclejerk,36cmqb,xelested,4,Mon May 18 14:28:04 2015 UTC,"/unjerk You know, I have 2 colleagues that were coming to Japan.  They had a guidebook that warned them not to go with the African touts into their bar and explained exactly what the scam was.  They asked me if it was true and I confirmed it for them.  What did they do?  Got drunk and followed some Nigerian tout into a bar.  When they went to leave apparently they were met by half of Nigeria and frog walked to an ATM to max out their withdrawl. /rejerk  HAHAHAHAHA DUMB ASS TOURISTS!"
japancirclejerk,36cmqb,iago185,3,Mon May 18 15:58:17 2015 UTC,So... wait.  Are you saying that it's really a scam?
japancirclejerk,36cmqb,Chiafriend12,4,Mon May 18 20:46:07 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess technically it's strong arm robbery, but the whole ""2000 yen for free drinks and look at naked girls"" thing the touts try to hit you with is totally a scam."

japancirclejerk,36cmqb,hachihoshino,4,Tue May 19 04:19:07 2015 UTC,This is probably the first thing they tell you to watch out for.  There's even a state department warning for that shit.

japancirclejerk,36cmqb,fotoford,6,Tue May 19 00:43:25 2015 UTC,"First of all, there is Yakuza backing and no hard evidence of wrongdoing. Also, they do get shut down, but then change location and reopen."
japancirclejerk,36cmqb,Legal_Rampage,6,Tue May 19 00:50:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for the most part these places skirt just inside the limitations of the law. There's no law against charging fucking ridiculous amounts for drinks in a bar where women smile at you with dead, glassy eyes and suggest that you buy more and more booze; it's a scam that relies entirely upon the mark being a fucking moron, and the law generally doesn't intervene to stop people from being monumentally stupid.  When they overstep into doing shit like drugging people's drinks, they generally seem to get shut down after a while - although they can carry on a reasonable amount of time off the back of so many of their marks being married dudes who'd rather take the financial hit than get embroiled in something legal they won't be able to hide from their wives."
japancirclejerk,36cmqb,fotoford,3,Tue May 19 02:13:50 2015 UTC,"I was stunned but this seemed like the police and thugs of this town work together to pray on the tourists anyone dumb enough to walk into the trap, Japanese or gaijin.    FTFY"
