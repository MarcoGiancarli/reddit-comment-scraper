googleplaydeals,3dyy3d,sepmarcos,6,Mon Jul 20 17:47:52 2015 UTC,"I bought the app a while ago, while i dont notice a difference between the free version and the Pro. Supposedly it auto updates but have never seen it do so. Every time I open the app there is a new update.   It does support the developer and thus felt like buying the app. If anyone knows what the PRO version actually does, please let me know."
googleplaydeals,3dyy3d,spyder173,2,Mon Jul 20 21:25:37 2015 UTC,"I think the ""Smart install"" thing is a pro feature."
googleplaydeals,3dyy3d,iWizardB,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:56:06 2015 UTC,"t does support the developer   It does not support the real developer of Busybox, Bruce Perens. The price seems a tad high when somebody else did most of the work."
googleplaydeals,3dyy3d,hughk,2,Tue Jul 21 06:31:34 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's kinda messed up"
googleplaydeals,3dyy3d,spyder173,4,Tue Jul 21 12:35:13 2015 UTC,"Bought this a while ago, still have little to no knowledge of whether updating it helps but I like to anyway."
googleplaydeals,3dyy3d,phillibl,2,Mon Jul 20 19:21:52 2015 UTC,[US] Confirmed.
googleplaydeals,3dyy3d,firestorm69,0,Mon Jul 20 17:57:58 2015 UTC,Worth it just to shut up that damned update notification.
googleplaydeals,3dq5jo,sepmarcos,4,Sat Jul 18 10:44:50 2015 UTC,Not a very good name. Reminds me of an infamous internet photo
googleplaydeals,3dq5jo,theMTNdewd,17,Sat Jul 18 14:59:31 2015 UTC,I think that's half the joke.
googleplaydeals,3dq5jo,Mik0ri,3,Sat Jul 18 15:27:58 2015 UTC,"I think that's at least 89% of the joke, if not 97%."
googleplaydeals,3dpvue,rhcp88,6,Sat Jul 18 07:58:37 2015 UTC,This is a REALLY cool album. Great find!
googleplaydeals,3dpvue,Knotfloyd,6,Sat Jul 18 10:39:38 2015 UTC,"meh, pedestrian at best."
googleplaydeals,3dpvue,vmont,2,Sun Jul 19 04:19:52 2015 UTC,I see what you did there.
googleplaydeals,3dpvue,s15274n,4,Tue Jul 21 16:27:37 2015 UTC,"You two better not be shills, because you convinced me to buy it."
googleplaydeals,3dpvue,bag_of_oatmeal,5,Sat Jul 18 21:01:46 2015 UTC,"not at all, this is one my faves of 2015.  i already own it physically but bought again for convenience and its a buck.  she's great."
googleplaydeals,3dpvue,msw141,3,Sun Jul 19 00:03:23 2015 UTC,I can vouch. Its really great!
googleplaydeals,3dpvue,grizzoverde,3,Sun Jul 19 03:33:45 2015 UTC,"wow, this is a great album."
googleplaydeals,3dnbfe,PeaceTheAssassin,6,Fri Jul 17 17:44:08 2015 UTC,thanks! this should be fun to watch a bit of.
googleplaydeals,3dnbfe,Waddles77,7,Fri Jul 17 18:15:55 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! Not a short either; I hadn't heard about it up 'til now, but it's 74 minutes long. I'll catch it in a little bit."
googleplaydeals,3dnbfe,zires,7,Fri Jul 17 20:18:46 2015 UTC,"Chromecast is awesome because of this. I called my son, said I'm going to play a Tom and Jerry movie, he ran over. He's watching as I type."
googleplaydeals,3dnbfe,karma_nder,4,Fri Jul 17 19:21:05 2015 UTC,Awesome!
googleplaydeals,3dnbfe,thirdstage,6,Fri Jul 17 20:20:57 2015 UTC,"These little deals are amazing! Just hey, here's a $3 movie rental on us! Not the biggest blockbuster, but hey, my son will enjoy it!"
googleplaydeals,3dnbfe,edhere,5,Fri Jul 17 21:03:04 2015 UTC,This deal is also available in Canada.
googleplaydeals,3dnbfe,kansas21,5,Fri Jul 17 21:39:53 2015 UTC,Thanks. My kids liked it. I was in and out of the room but I watched most of it. Fun movie.
googleplaydeals,3dma7s,thirdstage,7,Fri Jul 17 12:38:40 2015 UTC,$9.99 in the US.
googleplaydeals,3dma7s,rebelbanker,5,Fri Jul 17 12:50:08 2015 UTC,OK serious question... would a proxy work?
googleplaydeals,3dma7s,Sate_Hen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:30:23 2015 UTC,"Just tried with a CA VPN server and it didn't work, still showed UK prices, but that was on my phone not sure if PC would be different"
googleplaydeals,3dma7s,amongstthewaves,3,Fri Jul 17 21:55:29 2015 UTC,"I'm disappointed it's not going on in the US, but I suppose I should be glad the Canadians are getting a good deal for once."

googleplaydeals,3dnbl0,sepmarcos,2,Fri Jul 17 17:45:08 2015 UTC,Seems interesting. Anyone switched from Nova prime and is happy with it?
googleplaydeals,3dnbl0,saberplane,2,Sat Jul 18 04:13:50 2015 UTC,Its just flashy but severly limited.
googleplaydeals,3dnbl0,Neuropsychosis,2,Sat Jul 18 12:26:34 2015 UTC,I got it for free awhile ago and hated it.
googleplaydeals,3dnbl0,dachuggs,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:03:10 2015 UTC,Thx both. Won't waste my money then.
googleplaydeals,3dkxax,sepmarcos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:40:13 2015 UTC,This game which I played a lot when I was 17 came out 17 years ago. I'm old.
googleplaydeals,3djxj7,matyifkbt,5,Thu Jul 16 21:40:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know why Dora is on the thumbnail,  the game doesn't have anything to do with her. The player controls an anthromorphic dog in a spacesuit and the galaxy he is in has lots of interactable aliens and objects. I downloaded it and my 4 year old loves this game. Can't go wrong when it's free."
googleplaydeals,3dkxon,sepmarcos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:43:36 2015 UTC,Brought bluetooth multiplayer is awesome!
googleplaydeals,3dj59v,lost_in_trepidation,7,Thu Jul 16 18:14:17 2015 UTC,One of my favorite movies ever.  So funny.
googleplaydeals,3dj59v,rhcp88,7,Thu Jul 16 18:15:43 2015 UTC,Meh. $4 is the most I'd pay on a discounted piece of media. But appreciate the contribution nonetheless
googleplaydeals,3dj59v,DrLipschitz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:01:50 2015 UTC,"Great movie, my favorite of the trilogy. It's on Netflix, in the US at least."
googleplaydeals,3dj59v,TheIrateSPider,2,Fri Jul 17 07:29:45 2015 UTC,Trilogy?
googleplaydeals,3dj59v,PhoenixBlack136,3,Fri Jul 17 13:47:54 2015 UTC,"The unofficial ""Cornetto Trilogy"" of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and The World's End."

googleplaydeals,3di5nf,sepmarcos,3,Thu Jul 16 13:45:26 2015 UTC,Any good with touch controls?
googleplaydeals,3di5nf,CRCasper,10,Thu Jul 16 21:35:39 2015 UTC,It's not bhaaaaaad.
googleplaydeals,3di5nf,DrFatz,3,Thu Jul 16 22:34:24 2015 UTC,How's it run?
googleplaydeals,3di5nf,MoreThanAverage,15,Thu Jul 16 18:03:28 2015 UTC,"On all four legs, but that's not important, right now."
googleplaydeals,3di5nf,NoFaQ,3,Thu Jul 16 19:39:51 2015 UTC,"Either way, I played it on PC and I can say that this game is the GOAT"
googleplaydeals,3di5nf,MoreThanAverage,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:59:03 2015 UTC,"On my ME176CX, kinda crappy. I picked it up last sale. It's playable, but only just barely. I think it's ram hungry.  On the other hand, it's literally almost as good as the PC version."
googleplaydeals,3di5nf,JonWood007,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:38:54 2015 UTC,"Runs pretty great on my Nexus 5 (SD800) and Shield Portable (Tegra 4) - a few frame skips here and there but overall very well, so anything released in the last few years should be fine."
googleplaydeals,3di5nf,drunkenAmoeba,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:33:35 2015 UTC,"The game runs OK on my S6 Edge, which is a very powerful phone.  It could use more optimisation I think."
googleplaydeals,3di5nf,william1134,-3,Mon Jul 20 13:35:57 2015 UTC,I know I'm going to be downvoted. But I wouldn't want this piece of crap for free.
googleplaydeals,3di5nf,iambutternumber,3,Thu Jul 16 20:45:45 2015 UTC,"I bought it last time it was on offer, and played it a few times. Not gone back to it since. So that tells you what I thought of it."
googleplaydeals,3di5nf,JonWood007,2,Thu Jul 16 20:48:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah goat simulator isnt known for its replay value. It's a good game to play for a couple hours, get a few laughs, and then never touch again."
googleplaydeals,3di5nf,jonosaurus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:39:43 2015 UTC,"yeah. i bought it release day for pc, haven't played it since."
googleplaydeals,3dkwo0,sepmarcos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:34:47 2015 UTC,Anyone know if this works on Android TV?
